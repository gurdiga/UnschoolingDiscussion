<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137728247">What a fun afternoon!  My 5 yr old daughter, Lauren, was playing with a fork <br/>
today.  As I was watching her, I noticed she was figuring out how to balance <br/>
the fork on the edge of one finger.  Moving it back an forth so that it was <br/>
closer to the tongs, where the weight was.  She finally got it and ran over <br/>
to show Nicholette, almost 7.  Nic was impressed and decided to grab her own <br/>
fork and try it.  It worked!  I just sat quietly observing and smiling with <br/>
pride. :)<br/>
<br/>
Ethan, 35 months, walked in the room and Lauren showed him how it worked.  <br/>
Well, he decided to grab a stick and try it with a stick instead.  So cute, <br/>
watching him try to balance it at the end, as they were doing with the <br/>
forks.  Of course, the stick was fairly evenly balanced at each end, so he <br/>
had to try it in the middle.  He figured it out after several tries on his <br/>
own.  Finally, it was Ethan that decided to show me this new trick.  He <br/>
balanced the fork, the stick and tried a big earth digger truck, but it was <br/>
too heavy for his little finger to hold. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not wanting to give up the secret just yet, I asked the kids if they wanted <br/>
to go outside and see if the same thing happens with bigger objects and <br/>
people.  Nicholette chimed in that, &quot;OH YEAH!!!  The see-saw!!!&quot;  I love it <br/>
when they have those light bulb moments. &lt;bg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So, we played on the see-saw for well over an hour.  Trading positions with <br/>
heavier and lighter members of the family to see how we could balance it <br/>
evenly in the air.  The kids thought it was so funny that three of them <br/>
could sit together on one end but only Mommy was on the other. LOL!  <br/>
Suddenly, it occurred to Lauren that she had a name for this <br/>
phenomenon...BALANCE!!!  &quot;MOMMY!!  We can all balance the see-saw together!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We talked about why they thought it wouldn&#39;t work with just one person on <br/>
one end and no one on the other.  Why Mommy could sit on one end but three <br/>
of the kids sat on the other end to make it balance.  We talked about weight <br/>
and force and how they effect the see-saw, but in very simplistic terms.<br/>
<br/>
All this led into a discussion on catapults, which we had just watched a <br/>
show on PBS about this morning.  Suddenly, the show, of which they had <br/>
little interest in this morning, became real and alive for them!  Nicholette <br/>
made the connection that the swinging catapult had to be balanced in order <br/>
to &#39;throw&#39; the ball.<br/>
<br/>
So, tomorrow we are going to make catapults to throw water balloons at each <br/>
other...Nic&#39;s idea &lt;bg&gt;.  I suspect there will be an &#39;un-lesson&#39; in that as <br/>
well!<br/>
<br/>
What did you do today???<br/>

&lt;&lt; What did you do today??? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer, I liked your see-saw story!  If it&#39;s one where they can sit <br/>
anywhere, they can mess with where the position people, too.  (probably they <br/>
already have done that! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, Kirby&#39;s at the new X-Men movie with a guy who works with him.  <br/>
Then he&#39;s going the the anime club meeting, which meets late after the comic <br/>
book shop closes.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty and Jeremy (another homeschooler) are in the back yard fencing.  Jeremy <br/>
got fencing equipment for his birthday.  There&#39;s no moon and it&#39;s dark, so <br/>
Keith groused some about safety, but we have some floodlights, not great <br/>
ones, and after Keith coached them a bit, Sadie (former homeschooler, now <br/>
fulltime college student) is out there &quot;marshaling.&quot;  Holly was on the swings <br/>
watching, but is inside watching the Simpsons now.  Joey (homeschooled, kinda <br/>
lives quietly in the shadows at our house a lot, but was at a family dinner <br/>
tonight because a cousin came to town) is outside watching.<br/>
<br/>
An hour ago, Holly and I were at a fabric store buying cloth for a new top <br/>
for the little medieval tent she&#39;s using Memorial Day.  We found something <br/>
good for $1.97 and it turned out to be half price.  Woohoo!  It&#39;s an old <br/>
tent, top is worn, sides are fine, faded black.  Got faded-black and <br/>
not-so-white striped stuff which will look wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Two hours ago, Keith&#39;s best friend Bob was here.  He brought a banjo for <br/>
Marty to borrow to see if he wants to pursue that as an instrument.  Only bad <br/>
thing is Marty&#39;s a lefty.  So he can either learn to play it right handed, or <br/>
we can spend big bucks for a left-handed banjo.  But for now he can at least <br/>
look at some chord charts and picking patterns and get an idea of the <br/>
situation.  And maybe he&#39;ll be one of those guys who can just do it.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby worked today.  Before he went to work (still working backwards), the <br/>
rest of the family went to Gardu√±o&#39;s, a nice New Mexican restaurant, for <br/>
Holly&#39;s 11-and-a-half birthday lunch.  We had a really good time.<br/>
<br/>
Before that, Holly had been off with other friends who were in a dance <br/>
recital.  She had left the house at 8:10 and got back at 12:30.  Marty hadn&#39;t <br/>
gotten up til noon.  Kirby was up going through some of the stuff from his <br/>
room-cleanup.  Packed three boxes of detritus into one box and stored it in <br/>
his closet.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in there Holly and I went to the grocery store, Marty and I had <br/>
breakfast together, Keith and Holly and I had sandwiches together on homemade <br/>
bread, talked about the return of Hulk Hogan (as Mr. America, with a mask), <br/>
and about a card game Kirby had brought out that he had told me about, called <br/>
&quot;Gother Than Thou.&quot;  Very humorous cards.  <br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow morning Keith, Marty, Holly and Sadie are going to Edgewood to help <br/>
clean up the site where we&#39;ll all be camping Memorial Day weekend.  A couple <br/>
of thousand people (or a few hundred fewer), medieval village for a long <br/>
weekend. This is the thirtieth annual Grand Outlandish Tournament.  I totally <br/>
missed the first two, went for a few hours of #3, attended full-blown #4, and <br/>
organized and ran #5.   Tired and old now, I&#39;ll organize the kids&#39; clothes, <br/>
camp food and schedule and make sure all the necessary kitchen equipment is <br/>
out there, but will probably day trip.  <br/>
<br/>
Each kid will have an individual medieval-style tent.  Kirby&#39;s and Holly&#39;s <br/>
are revivals (new frames and ropes) of a couple of basically arming <br/>
tent/storage room things, tall enough to stand in but not huge. Center pole, <br/>
hanging square frame at 5&#39;, and four corner ropes.  Holly&#39;s will have a new <br/>
roof.  Marty will be in a new tent and new design to us.  No center pole, two <br/>
poles and two ropes.  10&#39; on each side at the bottom, room to stand just <br/>
right in the middle.  It&#39;s a Viking tent thing based on making a tent with <br/>
two oars and a sail.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, it&#39;s very unlikely to rain in New Mexico in May at that elevation.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  After sandwiches, Keith and I went through the four songs we&#39;re doing <br/>
for a friend&#39;s wedding in two weeks.  We&#39;re playing recorder, by ear/memory, <br/>
for Bride&#39;s entry, candle-lighting ceremony, recession, and the intro of the <br/>
bride and groom at the reception.  And we talked about the progress on the <br/>
three tents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025671452">Wow Sandra, that sounds like a packed day!  I often wonder what it will be <br/>
like with 7 teenagers in the house, all wanting to do their own things!  I <br/>
think there will be a strong need for growing extras of everything...arms, <br/>
legs, ears...an extra brain might not hurt either! LOL<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, our see-saw is a plastic Little Tykes alligator.  They can <br/>
sit in the middle, but it has a wide, deep base, so no balancing act there.  <br/>
I told Chris, my husband, that he needs to help us build a *real* see-saw <br/>
when he gets home at the end of the month.  Poor guy, I have so many <br/>
woodworking projects in the works for him!  I really want to go buy tools of <br/>
my own (he has to take his when he goes on trips) and learn to do woodwork <br/>
with the kids.  We&#39;ll be moving soon and the kids and I have come up with <br/>
great, though ever changing, plans for a wooden swing set and playhouse.  <br/>
The playhouse seems like a doable first project....four walls, a roof and a <br/>
floor!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had HUGE thunderstorms for the past two days.  One thing I do like <br/>
about Texas is May.  We usually have wonderful storms!  Yesterday, we had <br/>
hail the size of baseballs!!  Another great lesson!  The girls asked all <br/>
about lightening, thunder, why ice falls when it&#39;s over 80 degrees outside.  <br/>
It amazes me sometimes that they even think about those things...the ice <br/>
falling in hot weather.<br/>
<br/>
Today, when the thunderstorm came through, they were all thrilled, rather <br/>
than scared!  Our electricity blinked out a few times and they all hoped it <br/>
would go out so we could get out the candles and flashlights. &lt;bg&gt;  I got a <br/>
bright idea and secretly shut off all the breakers, which sent them into <br/>
screaming fits of joy and laughter!  We made shadow puppets on the walls and <br/>
scarey faces in the candle-light.  BIG problem though!  DOH!  I forgot <br/>
dinner was in the oven! ROFL!!!  Not to spoil the secret, we made sandwiches <br/>
an stuck the lasagna in the fridge to finish cooking tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really been a great day!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723419821">&lt;&lt;What did you do today??? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Today I bought a push mower ~ the kind without a motor.  I decided it&#39;s my <br/>
exercise program for the summer.  (As I live on a hilled corner, I&#39;m gonna be <br/>
BUFF!!:::flexing biceps:::)  While I was experimenting with the green stuff <br/>
in the front lawn, three different adults stopped their cars to offer me <br/>
their lawnmowers!!!  Meanwhile, all the kids who noticed wandered over to see <br/>
what the heck that lady is doing &lt;bg&gt;  &quot;I&#39;ve never seen one of those before, <br/>
can I try?&quot;  &quot;SURE!&quot;  Most were too short to make it work effectively, but it <br/>
was amazing to see them all give it their best shot: adjusting the angle of <br/>
the handles to ensure the wheels are turning, thinking about the clumpy weed <br/>
patches [convinced I was wrong about it not working well on them] and going <br/>
over and over the spots.... then all the really grassy parts were done and <br/>
the kids went home, the weeds are still 6&quot; taller than the mowed grass, but <br/>
it was one heck of a time :)  <br/>
Meanwhile I was caring for a friend&#39;s 2 yo, who was very sad for his mommy... <br/>
he cracked up when he saw me head for the weedy patch with the lawn mower (at <br/>
full run!), soon he was pushing Hannah&#39;s baby stroller over the grass calling <br/>
&quot;help you, help you!&quot;  sooooo sweet!  <br/>
Great day! :)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919256629">Ahhh!  That does sound sweet!<br/>
<br/>
When I was a little girl one of our elderly neighbors used a push mower.  I <br/>
remember thinking it was SO cool!  (Kind of like my kids with my old 33 <br/>
records, LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
What a GREAT idea for productive exercise.  If our yard weren&#39;t so darn big, <br/>
I might try that myself!  I just can&#39;t imagine pushing that sucker over half <br/>
an acre of giant weeks in 110 degree weather.  I do well to even follow the <br/>
self propelled (does that pertain to mowers??? &lt;bg&gt;) one we have now!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for sharing your day!  I&#39;m seriously considering a yahoo <br/>
group for things just like this.  Something to inspire unschoolers on those <br/>
doubtful days and something to enjoy reading and sharing everyday.  It seems <br/>
like the only examples out there for new unschoolers to see as evidence of <br/>
kids learning is through reading stories...how unschoolers learn to read, <br/>
etc...  I know so many people hear ideas of what *could* be done in an <br/>
unschooling situation that constitutes math (or whatever) like shopping with <br/>
Mom, but actual accounts are hard to find.  For me anyway...am I missing <br/>
something??  Would anyone here be interested in that sort of thing?<br/>

love it if you would start a yahoo group like that!  I am a fairly <br/>

been on an unschooling journey for a couple of years.  We started out <br/>
sort of &quot;schooly&quot; two years ago, but are way more relaxed now.  We <br/>
live in Ohio and raise grass-fed meats on our farm. I have been <br/>
enjoying this list, although it&#39;s a little hard to keep up with all <br/>
the posts, I think I&#39;m starting to get the hang of it now.  Anyway, I <br/>
LOVED your post about your unschooling day, and would really like to <br/>
hear lots more like it.  So, please keep me informed if you do decide <br/>
to start a group like you mentioned.<br/>

My brother is a lefty, and plays guitar(acoustic) for a living.  He <br/>
now has to buy left handed guitars because he has to plug them into <br/>
the sound system, and he needs the controls on the top of his guitar <br/>
so he can adjust volume and things easily, in the middle of a song, <br/>
but for the first few years of him playing (before doing it in <br/>
public) he always had a right handed guitar that he strung reversed.  <br/>
I was wondering why a banjo couldn&#39;t be the same.<br/>

What did you do today???&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Great story about the seesaw!  It figured in our day as well ... but a bit later.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Alyssa (just turned 9) decided she wanted to learn how to ride her bike.   Previous summers she had made some attempts with her training wheels off, but got frustrated and scared and asked for them back. So last night out we went and Rocco tuned up the bike (which is now decidedly too small - oh well) and off she went.  She asked me to help, and promptly got frustrated, but I soon managed to unobtrusively disappear so she could figure it out in peace.  I went to the garage and practically cleared it out for an upcoming yard sale my Mom is having!  During the next hour and a half she kept at it, up and down the sidewalk.  When she finally came in she said she worked at it but didn&#39;t feel much further ahead, but it was said very matter-of-factly, not frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this morning she got dressed and went back out to her bike.  Michael (5) decided he wanted his training wheels off as well.  In fact, as I was gazing over the situation, he had already pulled out the wrapped up wrench set and said &quot;Here you go&quot;!  LOL Unfortunately one side was very tight and we had to leave the lubricating oil on to soak in. About an hour or so later, as I was quickly working my way through my backlog of emails from here, she came in and announced she could now ride a bike.  I went out to see her ride ... I must say, she was pretty good!<br/>
<br/>
During the afternoon she was searching ebay for stuff and found a big box of Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans which she bought with some of her birthday money.  She asked me to spell a few words for her - since searching mis-spelled words wouldn&#39;t work very well!  Joseph (11) was up and playing his gameboy, researching stuff on the internet, and hanging around.<br/>
<br/>
I emailed Rocco back at work about a discussion we&#39;ve been having.  I had sent him a blurb a couple days ago about the discussion here on leading busy, interesting lives and he had replied about not really being interested in being &quot;busy&quot; in the goal-oriented, materialistic sense he felt many North-Americans pursued.  I replied that I hadn&#39;t meant that at all and that the suggestions he had given were wonderful ways to keep &quot;busy&quot;, as opposed to &quot;fast-paced&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Rocco managed to get home relatively early and Michael accosted him to remove the second training wheel and then Alyssa asked to build the teeter-totter (seesaw) she and Rocco had designed on paper last night.  Next time I stopped by the front door, Alyssa and Michael were seesawing!  They added handles (so Michael didn&#39;t go flying), and stabilizers so it didn&#39;t roll off the buckets being used as the fulcrum.  <br/>
<br/>
Then Alyssa asked if we could order pizza and have a Mario Party night.  We decided to go ahead so I put the steak back in the fridge for tomorrow and Rocco picked up a pizza.  We all sat downstairs and munched pizza and Rocco and the kids played Mario Party 4.  Joseph put his player on computer mode and was still researching on the computer downstairs and playing his gameboy but often came over to comment on the mini-games etc. I sat with them and was reading my copy of The Out-of-Sync Child book ... interesting.<br/>
<br/>
When the game was over, Alyssa asked if I could read some more of the Harry Potter Goblet of Fire book (our 4th time through) and she added &quot;to celebrate my being able to ride a bike&quot;. I just know she threw that in to try to keep me awake longer! LOL  So I got Michael set up for bed in his room watching one of his Scooby Doo tapes (he&#39;s not interested in hearing the book again and again!) and I read a couple chapters to Alyssa and Joseph in her room - she also just bought a heated throw blanket with some of her birthday money - cozy!  And Rocco had some alone time to pursue his interests.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, a pretty cool unschooling day, I think.<br/>
<br/>
And tomorrow we&#39;re going to Kortright, the local conservation centre, for the Four Winds Kite Festival.<br/>

sucker over half an acre of giant weeks in 110 degree weather. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always had an old fashioned push mower. The trick is to mow <br/>
regularly and keep the lawn healthy and NOT overfed. Then the mowing <br/>
is kind of fun. I usually take care of it here and work up a good <br/>
sweat. Of course it&#39;s possible to avoid the hot weather by mowing in <br/>
the early morning or evening here. I&#39;m sure it would be differnt in <br/>
those humid areas. :-P<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852266052">We had a similar experience with Nicholette last year with her bike.  She <br/>
just decided she was too old for training wheels and asked her Dad to take <br/>
them off.  She was very frustrated that she couldn&#39;t just jump on and take <br/>
off.  She didn&#39;t ask for the training wheels to be put back on, though.  For <br/>
days, she would come in crying because she couldn&#39;t ride without them.  <br/>
Biting my tongue, I decided not to offer to put them back on.  We played <br/>
&#39;hot lava&#39;, which was a game we made up on the spot and changed as we went <br/>
along.  Basically, we would all sit on our bikes and try to keep our feet <br/>
off the hot lava...the ground.  It was really hard at first for her but she <br/>
soon decided she was going to last longer than I could with our feet up.  <br/>
She made the rules that we had to start with our whole feet on the ground.  <br/>
But since it burned to have hot lava on our feet, we could life our heels <br/>
up.  Each step was a count to three.  Next, we could only use our toes, <br/>
until finally, we could only balance on our big toes!  By the end of the <br/>
day, she was riding on her own without training wheels!<br/>
<br/>
She played hot lava with Lauren (5) and Hannah (4) last month and they are <br/>
both training wheel free now!  She is SO proud! :)<br/>

Cool game!  That&#39;s how Alyssa started out yesterday, just trying to balance.  I think it also gave her confidence that she could catch herself when she did lose her balance. I&#39;ll definitely mention the game version to Michael.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  he always had a right handed guitar that he strung reversed.  <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering why a banjo couldn&#39;t be the same. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Five string banjos have the fifth string on top, with it&#39;s own tuning key <br/>
five frets in, and the way it&#39;s played is that&#39;s another &quot;bass&quot; string (sort <br/>
of, although it&#39;s a higher note).  If he played it upside down he&#39;d be <br/>
playing bass with his little finger (wouldn&#39;t work).<br/>
<br/>
Even a lot of guitars can&#39;t just be restrung without reversing the head part <br/>
where the strings lie (which tends to have notches just the size of the <br/>
strings, fatter on the low end) and the bridge, too.  Your brother probably <br/>
knew how to switch the guitar around, or happened to find one where that <br/>
wasn&#39;t an issue.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s fairly ambidextrous so maybe it won&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a picture of a five string there (too fancy, but I didn&#39;t find a <br/>
plain one in the short time I gave myself &lt;g&gt;)  <br/>

<br/>
Yes.  The strength is holding a whole chord for sometimes a long time, so <br/>
that&#39;s harder than the one finger at a time of a cello or something.  And the <br/>
finger picking is more precision-based, so there&#39;s the dumb strong hand <br/>
(left, in my case) doing chords and the nimble, clever hand (right, for me) <br/>
doing the &quot;don&#39;t miss that string, you only have one chance&quot; stuff.<br/>
<br/>
There was a time (hundreds of years back) when recorders were manufactured <br/>
for either right or left handed players, with the bottom hole being on both <br/>
sides, and you just stuffed the one you weren&#39;t going to use with wax.  Not <br/>
everybody plays a right handed model.  Lots of holes have been moved to be <br/>
more accessible to right-handers.  But on that, the slow strong hand is on <br/>
top, holding it still.<br/>

We just sort of went through the same break through with our almost 5 <br/>
year old :)  He has been trying to learn to ride a bike for a while <br/>
(with training wheels) but never could get it, and never lasted more <br/>
than a few minutes, I am talking over a year here.  We never really <br/>
pushed it,  but suddenly he got on and with a few pointers took off.  <br/>
Now he is a little pro.  Goes back to what everyone says about the <br/>
right timing and something clikcking in the brain.  I was just <br/>
telling hubby today, I think he had that click.  I am happy we never <br/>
pushed.  What huge benfit would it have made for him to struggle to <br/>
ride.  Instead, his quick success only is a boost to his <br/>
confidence...Yeah!!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Last night Alyssa (just turned 9) decided she wanted to learn how <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to ride her bike.   Previous summers she had made some attempts with <br/>
her training wheels off, but got frustrated and scared and asked for <br/>
them back. So last night out we went and Rocco tuned up the bike <br/>
(which is now decidedly too small - oh well) and off she went.  She <br/>
asked me to help, and promptly got frustrated, but I soon managed to <br/>
unobtrusively disappear so she could figure it out in peace.  I went <br/>
to the garage and practically cleared it out for an upcoming yard <br/>
sale my Mom is having!  During the next hour and a half she kept at <br/>
it, up and down the sidewalk.  When she finally came in she said she <br/>
worked at it but didn&#39;t feel much further ahead, but it was said very <br/>
matter-of-factly, not frustrated.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, this morning she got dressed and went back out to her <br/>
 </span></blockquote>bike.  Michael (5) decided he wanted his training wheels off as <br/>
well.  In fact, as I was gazing over the situation, he had already <br/>
pulled out the wrapped up wrench set and said &quot;Here you go&quot;!  LOL <br/>
Unfortunately one side was very tight and we had to leave the <br/>
lubricating oil on to soak in. About an hour or so later, as I was <br/>
quickly working my way through my backlog of emails from here, she <br/>
came in and announced she could now ride a bike.  I went out to see <br/>
her ride ... I must say, she was pretty good!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; During the afternoon she was searching ebay for stuff and found a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>big box of Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans which she bought with <br/>
some of her birthday money.  She asked me to spell a few words for <br/>
her - since searching mis-spelled words wouldn&#39;t work very well!  <br/>
Joseph (11) was up and playing his gameboy, researching stuff on the <br/>
internet, and hanging around.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I emailed Rocco back at work about a discussion we&#39;ve been having.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had sent him a blurb a couple days ago about the discussion here on <br/>
leading busy, interesting lives and he had replied about not really <br/>
being interested in being &quot;busy&quot; in the goal-oriented, materialistic <br/>
sense he felt many North-Americans pursued.  I replied that I hadn&#39;t <br/>
meant that at all and that the suggestions he had given were <br/>
wonderful ways to keep &quot;busy&quot;, as opposed to &quot;fast-paced&quot;.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Rocco managed to get home relatively early and Michael accosted him <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to remove the second training wheel and then Alyssa asked to build <br/>
the teeter-totter (seesaw) she and Rocco had designed on paper last <br/>
night.  Next time I stopped by the front door, Alyssa and Michael <br/>
were seesawing!  They added handles (so Michael didn&#39;t go flying), <br/>
and stabilizers so it didn&#39;t roll off the buckets being used as the <br/>
fulcrum.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Then Alyssa asked if we could order pizza and have a Mario Party <br/>
 </span></blockquote>night.  We decided to go ahead so I put the steak back in the fridge <br/>
for tomorrow and Rocco picked up a pizza.  We all sat downstairs and <br/>
munched pizza and Rocco and the kids played Mario Party 4.  Joseph <br/>
put his player on computer mode and was still researching on the <br/>
computer downstairs and playing his gameboy but often came over to <br/>
comment on the mini-games etc. I sat with them and was reading my <br/>
copy of The Out-of-Sync Child book ... interesting.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; When the game was over, Alyssa asked if I could read some more of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the Harry Potter Goblet of Fire book (our 4th time through) and she <br/>
added &quot;to celebrate my being able to ride a bike&quot;. I just know she <br/>
threw that in to try to keep me awake longer! LOL  So I got Michael <br/>
set up for bed in his room watching one of his Scooby Doo tapes (he&#39;s <br/>
not interested in hearing the book again and again!) and I read a <br/>
couple chapters to Alyssa and Joseph in her room - she also just <br/>
bought a heated throw blanket with some of her birthday money - <br/>
cozy!  And Rocco had some alone time to pursue his interests.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; All in all, a pretty cool unschooling day, I think.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And tomorrow we&#39;re going to Kortright, the local conservation <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See saws are great! What a fun day you had!<br/>
<br/>
 I often read these emails looking and searching for what others do with <br/>
their children. We do a lot with the kids but sometimes I find it difficult <br/>
to beak down the days when asked.<br/>
<br/>
The past few days I have been asked many questions about Homeschooling and <br/>
Unschooling. Our son was asked by a neighbor the other day what he does all <br/>
day, he explained it so much better than I would have.  I also have a friend <br/>
looking into HS so she has been wanting to know about our days.<br/>
<br/>
Let me give this a shot.<br/>
Dustin our 11 yr. old taught himself how to skim board. He wanted to surf but <br/>
the water is still a bit cold here. We attended a HS meeting, the kids played <br/>
and had a blast. Dustin went to see X2 the X Men Movie last night with his <br/>
dad.  He wanted to tell me all about the movie last night but they got back <br/>
at 12:30 and Dad said to tell me in the am.  So im in bed this morning and I <br/>
roll over and there he is &quot;Mom do you want to hear about the movie now,&quot; lol <br/>
too funny <br/>
 Today we went to the dump, we have a very small dump it is more like three <br/>
trailer sized dumpsters. There is a free-be barn at our dump where you can <br/>
get or drop off books, desks, bikes, toys etc.. Our little one Cassidy likes <br/>
to find treasures, she has a good eye for cool toys.<br/>
After that we picked up two ride toys at a yard sale dropped them off at <br/>
home, took out our Brittany pup one more time, then off to Best Buy to look <br/>
for another VCR for Cassidy.<br/>
<br/>
Dustin went ahead to Best Buy to play video games and Cassidy, Nicholas and I <br/>
went to Old Navy. My little girl is three and is such a sweetie, sometimes I <br/>
have to look twice at her to make sure she is still 3.  She handed me a <br/>
bathing suit today and she says Mom I&#39;ll take this one it will look &quot;weally&quot; <br/>
good on me. She loves to shop!<br/>
<br/>
 Then to Best Buy to meet Dustin and search for a VCR with Auto repeat.  <br/>
<br/>
We came home the kids played with their new found ride toys, Jumped on the <br/>
trampoline and Collected rocks (Cassidy collected and the puppy chewed).  <br/>
Later Dustin and I went to Stroudwater Books. They are closing so we searched <br/>
the entire store for a good deal. Spent a good hour and a half there. He <br/>
choose a book on Navy Seals and 1001 commonly used Spanish words. He wants to <br/>
learn Spanish but really wanted audio tapes he is convinced if he plays them <br/>
when he sleeps he will learn it.  <br/>
<br/>
We then went to Goodwill, where we stumbled on a VCR for Cassidy, a CD tower <br/>
for Dustin and a VCR tape drawer.  I love this store they always have <br/>
something I am looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Our last stop was to the grocery store. Dustin loves to tell people he is <br/>
Homeschooled (He says HS but explains Unschooling, people here only know one <br/>
term) so tonight he is at the register and somehow finds a way to slide it in <br/>
there. I think tonight he said something about no bed time. Lol That got the <br/>
clerks attention. ( I did add to the conversation that he has no bed time but <br/>
is asleep usually before 11 and up at 7-8) Well to make a long story short he <br/>
answered all her questions with pride and as we walked away we could hear her <br/>
talking to the next customers in line. I didn&#39;t catch all of it but I could <br/>
hear her saying how great a kid he was and how cool it all sounded. I didn&#39;t <br/>
think he herd her but when we got out side he said Mom did you hear her! I <br/>
said yeah I did.  So he made sure he brought his cart back in the farthest <br/>
door so she saw him returning the cart. That made his night.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home we herd the about the Man in the Mountain breaking away in NH <br/>
and discussed some of the history behind it all. The rock face is no more a <br/>
great piece of NH. I would imagine people will still visit but if they never <br/>
saw it in person sad to say they never will....<br/>
<br/>
Today was more running than life I think.<br/>
