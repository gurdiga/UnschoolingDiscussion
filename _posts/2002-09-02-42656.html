<div id="ygrps-yiv-118379451">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I know one is suppose to wait a while before an intro but I figured with the <br/>
topics going on now, this was a perfect time.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Mary and for the sake of not getting confused, I&#39;ll go by Mary B <br/>
as I have seen at least one other Mary.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a mom to 4 kids. Our oldest at 16 attends a private school and has no <br/>
interest in homeschooling and at this time would probably be better staying <br/>
in there. She does quite well in the system and we just keep saying, only 2 <br/>
more years when it really gets to us!!!<br/>
<br/>
Next is our son who is 7, a daughter at 6 and another daughter at almost 2. <br/>
My husband and I have known we would homeschool since our son was 2. That&#39;s <br/>
when we joined the local support group and I found a great mentor who was a <br/>
total unschooler raising 2 older children. I was hooked and never looked <br/>
back. By the standards of my local group, we&#39;re quite radical in unschooling <br/>
but it works so very well for us all. My husband is totally supportive and <br/>
never questions my decisions. He knows how very thoroughly I look into <br/>
something before I decide. Whether it&#39;s the unschooling issue or the non <br/>
vaccinating one. I have total support from him and he&#39;s always here for me <br/>
and the kids.<br/>
<br/>
My mom, an ex school teacher who lives in an adjacent MIL quarters, is a <br/>
great &quot;teacher if you will&quot; for the kids and also totally supports us. <br/>
Seeing what goes on with our oldest in school these days certainly helps!!!!<br/>
<br/>
My in laws on the other hand are a handful indeed and sadly we have <br/>
distanced ourselves from them due to necessity. My sanity and that of our <br/>
kids! My MIL comes around once a week and asks how school is going and I <br/>
just say great. She has no desire to really understand and I&#39;ve offered many <br/>
times. She doesn&#39;t understand why school isn&#39;t good enough for our kids when <br/>
it was fine for everyone else in the family. The non vaccination issue is a <br/>
whole other story. My 2 SIL&#39;s are pretty much the same and well, the <br/>
comments just got to be too much. Our kids don&#39;t need that kind of <br/>
interrogation and negativity. One SIL has said all the homeschool kids she <br/>
knows are sneaky, (she&#39;s an office manager in the public school system) and <br/>
the other one just plain out called us weird. Doesn&#39;t understand why I don&#39;t <br/>
farm my kids out to other people. And yes she actually said that. They <br/>
pretty much blame me, God knows my husband has no mind of his own. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I stay away and keep our kids away and my husband stays away for the most <br/>
part too. We are happy and very secure in our unschooling ways. We are very <br/>
relaxed and our children are thriving. Our oldest is amazed at what the <br/>
younger ones know as she never really sees us do school stuff with them!<br/>
<br/>
Our kids are now reading on their own and interested in geography and <br/>
science and our son is extremely good in math. The baby is trying to count <br/>
and do her alphabet, not in order of course but she tries so hard to keep up <br/>
with her brother and sister!<br/>
<br/>
Our days are full of play and outside fun and pets and field trips. And <br/>
sometimes just computer games and reading and board games. I can honestly <br/>
say that so far, I have never had any doubt of what our kids are capable of <br/>
and never a doubt that we haven&#39;t made the right decision. Unschooling for <br/>
us is the only way to go and we are totally at ease with it all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to be here and share ideas and to listen and possibly ask for help <br/>
when needed.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>
<br/>
