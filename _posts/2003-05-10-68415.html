<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954400899">Have your kids gone?  Haleigh and I would love to hear about it!  She&#39;d like <br/>
to go next year.  She&#39;s begging to go this year but I&#39;m not sure how I feel <br/>
about it just yet.  I&#39;ve read the website front to back but I&#39;d really like <br/>
to hear from someone who&#39;d been there, or who&#39;s child has been anyway. :)<br/>
