 </span></blockquote>Those Yu-gi-oh cards are pretty consuming.  I know that my husband would <br/>
prefer that I not talk to him about my horses all the time, buying stuff for them, <br/>
brushing them, even calling him at work to tell him something horsey that <br/>
needs to be picked up. I have even woken him up at early in the morning so I <br/>
could ride or fix a fence. However, they are my fun thing to do, I learn a lot <br/>
from them, patience, kindness, how to be quiet, fixing tack, ( I have yet to <br/>
learn to stay on when they buck) carpentry, loading h ay so it stays on the truck. <br/>
He knows how much pleasure I get from them and he goes along with me, helping <br/>
any way he can, and I am 40!!!!!!<br/>
I also had a hard time with the constant &quot;Guess how many attack points this <br/>
one has mom?&quot; stuff, but he really loves those cards and that game. I took him <br/>
to  a local gaming store to try dueling with a group that meets there, but he <br/>
was not comfortable trying. So we look at them together and talk about them <br/>
always.My son is 8 by the way.  I used to hate all things like that, pokemon, <br/>
digimon etc. Now I talk to him about it and look at it and it is interesting. <br/>
My mom has many times scoffed at my horse interest, in fact when I  was a kid <br/>
she would not let me have lessons or visit horses, and I lived and breathed <br/>
horses as a child.Drawing them, reading about them , pretending to be them . It <br/>
took till now to have them for myself. You know what, I am still completely <br/>
entranced by them.She still thinks it is stupid.She tells me how much she hates <br/>
horses and it still makes me feel like that frustrated little kid.<br/>
Take a deep breath and watch a yu-gi-oh show, it&#39;s not so bad and gives you a <br/>
common ground of communication. I learned that here, and at Sandra&#39;s website.<br/>

your son is showing you how important you are to him.  He wants to share <br/>
with you something that excites him.  This is a special time, and you are a <br/>
special person to him.  I would take his waking you as a compliment.<br/>
