The worst sexism my kids have come across is in books for kids, I think.  The <br/>
Happy Hollisters, The Boxcar Children.  Sometimes they&#39;ll ask a question in a <br/>
historical movie, &quot;Why doesn&#39;t she just do...&quot; whatever and I&#39;ll talk about <br/>
how very recently most women have had any rights and choices.   I stop and <br/>
comment sometimes on books that say &quot;You boys go and find wheels while the <br/>
girls make lunch&quot; or whatever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858018206">Right! The Little House books have a lot of sexism.<br/>
Plus Ma is really prejudiced against Indians. Pa<br/>
isn&#39;t, but my kids really think Ma is a bigot. :) Even<br/>
in Little Women, Jo is such a &quot;tomboy&quot; just because<br/>
she&#39;s independent and smart. But it&#39;s good, as long as<br/>
parents talk to the kids about it, for the kids to see<br/>
how people used to think about women. Juli<br/>

than any of the Roger Moore ones anyway!  but still I know what <br/>
you mean...  I really don&#39;t know...  I find this very tricky cos I was <br/>
extremely sensitive to sexual stuff (even just snogging) on the telly <br/>
when I was little, in fact so much so that if i&#39;d been referred to a <br/>
child-psych which the school asked my mum to do when I was 6 or <br/>
7, I think they could have thought I had been abused...  but I have <br/>
no memory of ever being sexually abused...  just &#39;aware&#39; from a <br/>
very young age...  I also became active relatively early...  I don&#39;t <br/>
know, I think it&#39;s one of those individual things again.  Now the <br/>
image of women protrayed is a whole other issue, and I don&#39;t have <br/>
boys so I really don&#39;t know about that...<br/>

Now...I don&#39;t have any of those in my house anymore. However, I do have Christian romance novels and recently picked one up about Australia...with four stories in it that intertwine with 4 women who end up being related to one another in some form or another. Its really interesting and Naomi has read a little bit of it. She&#39;s not a heavy reader right now although she does know that the books are there for her pleasure when she wants to read. She is more the active type now that its spring lol!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404029826">I think worrying about whether old books are sexist or racist or<br/>
whatever-ist is no different than censorship and book banning.  We read what<br/>
we want to read and then discuss it in the context of when it was written<br/>
and what has changed.  All books are a form of history and are a way to look<br/>
at how folks lived in the era in which the books were written.  Authors are<br/>
inclined to give more clues to what was really going on than what you<br/>
generally find in history books.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203758770">excellent point, April. Some may choose these roles but in the past there was not always a choice. A lot of modern children&#39;s literature has lots of fractured families and disrespectful people. Sometimes the gender roles aren&#39;t nearly as bad as the rudeness. <br/>
