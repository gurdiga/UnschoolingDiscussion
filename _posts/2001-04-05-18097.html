<div id="ygrps-yiv-518224027">I&#39;ve had so many responses (both here and in email) to<br/>
my post about my dd that I need time to process it<br/>
all. So thank you all very much, but I might not<br/>
answer right away. By the way, she woke up in a<br/>
fantastic mood this morning. I&#39;d left a note on her<br/>
bed last night, and this morning she gave it back to<br/>
me with a note saying she wanted to talk about it<br/>
while we garden, which won&#39;t be today because it&#39;s<br/>
cloudy and cold. And the back of the note was covered<br/>
with X&#39;s and O&#39;s. :) Juli<br/>

I&#39;m all sniffly and teary eyed. What a great daughter<br/>
you have and sooo wonderful for you (and her) that she<br/>
wants to talk about it! That is so fantastic and I&#39;m<br/>
so glad you got so many replies from this list asie<br/>
from mine, in which I got so carried away typing and<br/>
not thinking beforehand, that I forgot to say anything<br/>
about hugging, or praying, or thinking about you and<br/>
dd, etc. I meant to really. :)<br/>
I am not the most thought out person. <br/>
I hope everything works out lovely and I got all warm<br/>
and fuzzy with the x&#39;s and o&#39;s thing. too sweet. Don&#39;t<br/>
you LOVE kids?????<br/>
Keep us informed.<br/>
