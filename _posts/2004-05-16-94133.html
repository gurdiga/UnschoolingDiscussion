&lt;&lt;I think if we never brought up our needs our kids wouldn&#39;t get a chance to<br/>
see us as whole human beings all interacting in this creation that is our<br/>
family.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that one of the reasons my kids are so sensitive to my needs is that <br/>
I&#39;m sensitive to theirs.  It really is a reciprocal thing.  The other day <br/>
Emily was using the computer while I was in the kitchen, and she asked me to fix <br/>
her a cup of coffee.  I was really tired...and a huge part of me wanted to say, <br/>
*Fix it yourself.*  But I remembered that Em is quick to get me coffee <br/>
lately...so I made hers w/a smile!  If it works on a *set in her ways* mother like <br/>
me, I know it works on my kids.<br/>

Sometimes I&#39;m too too tired to go out at 10 pm to get some<br/>
candy that he wants.  We&#39;ll discuss the options like creating something else<br/>
or eating what we&#39;ve got in the house. I&#39;ve noticed a trend these days that<br/>
he&#39;s accepting of my limits more.<br/>
=====================<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to jumpoff from there.  He WILL accept limits more as he knows <br/>
they&#39;re thoughtful/compassionate/respectful of him.  But aside from the good part <br/>
of the statement above, I want to move toward what might be a misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
Letting kids have their choice of what&#39;s in the house, or letting them pick <br/>
things at the store are natural parts of everyday life.  Going out after dark <br/>
to get something someone craves isn&#39;t, unless people were restless and wanting <br/>
to get out anyway, or needed to pick someone up from a movie or a friend&#39;s <br/>
house, or whatever honest out-of-house reason there might be.<br/>
<br/>
The only things people should really be expected to go out for after dark, I <br/>
think, are necessities like toilet paper, maybe milk, drinking water if they <br/>
have bad water and no filter.<br/>
<br/>
I have two or three times gone out with Holly, walking to the Texaco just for <br/>
candy or the walk.  We could&#39;ve driven, but it was more the nighttime <br/>
adventure than the candy bar.<br/>
<br/>
If one of mine says &quot;I wish we had M&Ms&quot; I&#39;ll say &quot;Put it on the list and <br/>
I&#39;ll get some tomorrow.&quot;  (or if groceries were just bought, &quot;next time&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My kids can have what they want&quot; (which gets said a lot by many longterm <br/>
unschoolers) doesn&#39;t mean &quot;... in the whole earth, any time of the day or night.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t limit my kids&#39; video games&quot; does NOT mean &quot;I buy them every game and <br/>
system that comes out.&quot;  It means the parents aren&#39;t forbidding or timing or <br/>
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
And if we say &quot;Whatever&#39;s in the house, they can have,&quot; some newer readers <br/>
seem to smugly determine just never to have candy or video games in the house.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a balance.<br/>
<br/>
The extremes aren&#39;t so good.  Neither deprivation nor crazily trying to <br/>
provide everything a child has ever seen or imagined is going to work.<br/>

<br/>
Hell, I don&#39;t go out for ME at 10:00 for candy I want!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not an &quot;all or nothing&quot; thing going on here! I&#39;d be happy to get him <br/>
a Snickers bar tomorrow or the next time I&#39;m out shopping, but I&#39;m not going <br/>
out for every whim. There&#39;s a MUTUAL respect here! The boys wouldn&#39;t expect <br/>
that of me, but they know that I&#39;d be happy to run out to get medicine if they <br/>
needed it. Reese&#39;s cups, as good as they are, don&#39;t qualify as a need! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
