<div id="ygrps-yiv-322540871">I had a thought on this too.... Menonites are one of the truest Christian groups around I think, as their entire lives revolve around serving God, and they do NOT believe in spanking. Their biggest parenting belief is that no baby or child should ever cry. <br/>

   I hope that I am not throwing cold water on your idea of the<br/>
Mennonites but we lived around 4 groups of them and I never heard any of<br/>
them say they did not believe in spanking. In fact Train Up A Child was<br/>
making the rounds there. I know that children were spanked as we had<br/>
discussions on it...albeit rarely as they are very private people.<br/>
  About their children never crying...I did not see that either. They are<br/>
&quot;taught&quot; very young not to cry loudly.<br/>
They do cuddle and take time for their children probably more than the<br/>
norm and are for the most part gentle and loving but there is still &quot;do<br/>
as you are told&gt;&quot; The feeling of community is very strong and if you do<br/>
not abide by the community rules the alternative can be more than most<br/>
can handle.<br/>
  As for them being the truest christians around (my wording not yours)<br/>
may come from our looking in at a group of people that we rarely get to<br/>
see behind closed doors.<br/>
  They have there fair share of in fighting and petty problems...they are<br/>
just as human as you and I.<br/>
One of the things I always thought interesting is they do not tell their<br/>
children when a new baby is expected. They still keep it between the<br/>
adults. Where as &quot;english&quot; (as we are called) are so excited we tell the<br/>
postman, librarian and the store clerk.....we do live in different<br/>
worlds.One not always being better than another , just different.<br/>
<br/>

This is from my neck of the woods though in Tn. and Ky.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-883216406">Hi Sharon,<br/>
Where &#39;bouts in TN? The Mennonite group I personally know and spent a good bit of time with is in Lobelville (sp?). Over a 3 yr time period, I occasionally worked with them, ate with them, ran errands for them, took care of animals with them, and once helped with a barn-raising. I was fortunate to have had friends who were well-known and trusted in the community, and they accepted me quickly. I made quite a few good friends while I was there. Their way of teaching the children to behave was that when the child did something &quot;unacceptable&quot; everyone (including other children) would turn their backs or otherwise ignore the child until he/she quit whatever it was. The mothers carried their babies in slings everywhere until the child was old enough (usually around the age of 2 or 3) to follow and keep up, and then the boys usually went with their papa, while girls stayed with mama. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I picked up on that not telling about new babies too, and actually had a very hard time telling others about my first two pregnancies! <br/>

And you probably weren&#39;t the only baby she spanked.  <br/>
And if your parents had objected, someone might have mentioned &quot;Satan.&quot;<br/>
