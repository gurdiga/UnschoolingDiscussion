<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199979203"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have a lot of the same ideas as you about our family working together to<br/>
&gt; keep things in some semblance of  &quot;decency&quot;.. ( as far as housekeeping,<br/>
&gt; laundry, cooking, yardwork, etc)   I know that most folks here dont agree<br/>
&gt; with parents asking thier kids to pitch in..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. I think very few here would hesitate a moment<br/>
before asking their children for help, with housecleaning or other projects.<br/>
<br/>
If the house bothers me, I clean it. :) My angst about disorder, my problem<br/>
to solve it.<br/>
<br/>
If I want help with cleaning, I ask for help, and have yet to have either my<br/>
husband or my children say, &quot;No, I won&#39;t help you.&quot; Sometimes I have to wait<br/>
for help, which is reasonable enough if they&#39;re in the middle of something<br/>
else when I ask.<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t do is consider my stronger preference for orderliness to be<br/>
morally superior to the less-strong preference of the rest of my family. If<br/>
you take the &quot;these slobs won&#39;t help me achieve any kind of decent living<br/>
environment!&quot; out of the equation, and just be one member of the family<br/>
asking others for help with a project, I think housework becomes less a<br/>
mountain and more a molehill.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As a child, I was made to do yard work. I HATED it. Couldn&#39;t stand the sight <br/>
of a rake or a pine cone! I made the decision THEN that I wouldn&#39;t require MY <br/>
children to do yard work.<br/>
<br/>
After Cameron left school, there was certainly more time for him to &quot;do&quot; <br/>
things in the yard: building and painting a fence, planning/planting a <br/>
garden, handweeding, raking, mowing, etc. Ben thought I should make him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d ask for help. He&#39;s say, &quot;Do I HAVE to?&quot; I&#39;d cheerfully say, &quot;Nope.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
A few months passed. One day he asked why I didn&#39;t MAKE him do things. All <br/>
his friends&#39; parents made them do yardwork. I said that I only wanted him to <br/>
help if he WANTED to help. Being MADE to do yardwork would only make him hate <br/>
it. Doing it because he liked having a beautiful yard or to relieve me of <br/>
some of the labor or for physical release or pleasure---those would be good <br/>
reasons. <br/>
<br/>
I do things for him all the time that I wouldn&#39;t chose to do for others <br/>
because I love him and I want to do for him. When he was ready, I&#39;d love for <br/>
him to join me. But not until then.<br/>
<br/>
A few months after that, I was in the garden picking up pine cones. He joined <br/>
me. The next time he helped rake (took HALF the time it would have if only <br/>
one of us had been working alone). &gt;We get a lot of talking in then too.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Since then, if he sees me in the yard (or if I say that I&#39;ll be in the yard <br/>
working), he&#39;ll come out and help. He almost always does dishes that don&#39;t <br/>
get done the night before (especially if I&#39;m gone in the morning). <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s understanding that we ALL have the right to say no. The last <br/>
weeks before the conference last fall, I was a basket case and ignored the <br/>
house and yard. Both boys and my husband pitched in to a degree they don&#39;t <br/>
usually. They saw that I NEEDED help. We&#39;re a team, partners. But to us that <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that we all MUST do certain things; it means we do things we <br/>
might not like to do because we want to. It makes a loved one&#39;s life easier <br/>
or sweeter or cleaner or more beautiful. Because we WANT to.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Because I said so&quot; is a crappy reason to do ANYthing!<br/>

REALLY, she can do it. Just like anything else. You can do anything you want <br/>
to. How bad do you want it? Bad enough to do something about it? Really? Do <br/>
it.<br/>

housekeeper.  My younger sisters had the same mom and they are good <br/>
housekeepers.. They think my house is ungodly nasty.   But, personally, I <br/>
think they keep such clean houses just to please my folks, cause they know my <br/>
folks are disappointed in my housekeeping.  They really hate it too, but they <br/>
do it because they were taught &quot;thats what wives/mothers do&quot;  by my mothers <br/>
role modeling.  And guess what, my oldest son thinks the same thing.. &quot;But, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-223383153">Okay,<br/>
<br/>
but what do you do about family members who care but aren&#39;t willing to do<br/>
the work? They don&#39;t like the mess but don&#39;t pick up the broom because it<br/>
isn&#39;t their stuff or it isn&#39;t their job?<br/>
<br/>
FWIW I am the slob from birth child; messy desk, messy room, disorganized<br/>
(but cleaning up makes it harder for me to find stuff...really!) I have<br/>
tried fly lady, and frankly...well put her name together to get a different<br/>
idea!  But someone has to do the work sometimes, or we would have no dishes,<br/>
radishes would grow from the floor etc. etc. And we can&#39;t afford a cleaning<br/>
service.<br/>
<br/>
DH does pitch in, he washes clothes (up to me to put them away.)<br/>
<br/>
Really, I need a felix unger....<br/>

I do think kids can pitch in and be asked to pitch in....<br/>

be well,<br/>

the house it too messy.  He wants it clean, and he expects me to do it.  He <br/>
does keep his own room clean and kinda sorta takes care of HIS dog.. ( <br/>
maybe40% of the time)..<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I was an only child. My dad owned his own business and when my mom did work, <br/>
she taught at the same school I went to. Our hours were always the same. <br/>
When I got older, she didn&#39;t work. I really didn&#39;t have to do much. I was <br/>
catered to a lot. I would set the table for 3 and help dry the dishes most <br/>
times. I never made my bed or washed or cleaned or cooked. I could sleep as <br/>
late as I wanted and my mom would be outside cutting our huge backyard. When <br/>
I left home at 18, I lived with 3 other girls. One girl decided to be the <br/>
cook as she had been doing do for her mom and younger sister all her life. <br/>
She was an awful cook and I figured I couldn&#39;t do any worse. I asked if I <br/>
could try and took over from there. I ran that apt. like a captain. Our apt. <br/>
was always clean and we at better than everyone else. Most days I was <br/>
cooking for 6-8 people. (I was going to a tech school)<br/>

Never looked back and now I&#39;m a cleaning freak. It&#39;s one of the things I do <br/>
best. Never had to do it when I was young and now it&#39;s like a life&#39;s <br/>
mission.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I truly believe that it&#39;s a CHOICE. If someone really WANTS a clean house, <br/>
REALLY, she can do it. Just like anything else. You can do anything you want <br/>
to. How bad do you want it?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bad enough to alienate your children and husband to get them to do it?<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend whose room was always clean.  Her mom used to spank (whip?) <br/>
her with an extension cord each week if it wasn&#39;t done up to the mother&#39;s <br/>
specifications.  Even though my mom rarely made me do things I wasn&#39;t willing <br/>
to do, I had more secondary trauma from DiAna&#39;s mom&#39;s attitude about <br/>
cleanliness than any kid ought to have.   I was afraid to sit on the bed in <br/>
that room.  Mostly, DiAna would come to MY house to hang out.  Where the bed <br/>
might not even be made.<br/>
<br/>
And I personally would rather have my kids&#39; friends come over here than to <br/>
make my own kids feel unwelcome.<br/>
<br/>
This is stream of consciousness and not directed at anyone on this list.<br/>

&lt;&lt; when I no longer had to clean.<br/>
My best friends mom was just like yours, Jen never had to lift a finger, not <br/>
even put her clothes away. She is the neatest person I know. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Chris Krohn&#39;s mother put his clean and folded clothes in his drawers for him.<br/>
Even when he was a teen, though, he would wax his mother&#39;s car---REALLY wax <br/>
her car--because he wanted to.  He would do heavy yardwork for her without <br/>
being asked.  He would ask if there was anything he could do, because he felt <br/>
indebted and she never made him do anything.<br/>
<br/>
He is THE most organized male adult I know.  He is organized, artistic, <br/>
efficient... <br/>
AND he&#39;s heterosexual!  (For those of you who already thought, &quot;uh, huh...  <br/>
it&#39;s estrogen!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
He married Pati who was once my roommate.  She was the WORST sloppy roommate <br/>
I ever, ever had.  And one of the few sloppier than I am.   But when she had <br/>
her own place she was making full payments on, something snapped and she <br/>
became really tidy.  Like housekeeping became her hobby.<br/>
<br/>
She married Chris and they have the cleanest cars and house of any couple I <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
No children; that helps.<br/>
