&lt;&lt; He might not still attend church,<br/>
but he still believes the earth is only six thousand years old and that<br/>
humans have the God-given right to do whatever they want to it, and that<br/>
Jesus is going to swoop down at any minute and make it all better.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m surprised Lady Byrd Johnson did so well with her beautify America <br/>
campaign!  <br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid in Texas in the 50&#39;s, there were dumps EVERYWHERE.  It <br/>
seemed every kid was in walking distance of a pile of old bedsprings, <br/>
appliances, and a car or two (plus steel beer cans, tons of broken glass, <br/>
rotting gross paper or carboard with centipedes and all kinds of bugs and <br/>
spiders).    I&#39;ve told my kids people used to just throw their trash out the <br/>
windows.  I remember the sides of the highways (all those two-lane state <br/>
highways there used to be in West Texas and New Mexico that I spent so much <br/>
time on in the back of a couple of old Ford stationwagons) would be GLITTERY <br/>
from broken glass.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago we got some old Howdy Doody episodes from Netflix and watched <br/>
them.  The best parts were the Twinkie ads, and the last moment of the show.  <br/>
&quot;Remember kids....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One was &quot;Tell your parents you want to go to Sunday School this Sunday.&quot;<br/>
One was telling the kids to take a paper bag the next time they rode in an <br/>
automobile, so that people could put trash in the bag instead of throwing it <br/>
out the window!<br/>
<br/>
That was news, but probably the start of people my age saying NO to parents <br/>
who casually chucked stuff out.<br/>
<br/>
Yet I was taught by relatives and at church that Jesus was coming soon, it <br/>
might be today.   So too much concern for the future was definitely seen as a <br/>
lack of faith in the return of Jesus.  All that was important was our souls <br/>
and our faith.  The rest was God&#39;s to clean up by fire.<br/>
