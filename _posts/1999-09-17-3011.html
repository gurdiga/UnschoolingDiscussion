<div id="ygrps-yiv-956931650">Hi Rachael,<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re talking more overall stress than burnout.  Either way, <br/>
 it&#39;s no fun.  Life is a <br/>
balancing act and unschooling is no different.  I know many families <br/>
where both parents work and they homeschool.  It involves some <br/>
creativity and juggling,  but it can work and work well.  A lot of <br/>
unschooling families seem to gravitate towards working at home or <br/>
owning their own businesses.  That makes it a little easier to mesh <br/>
the unschooling lifestyle with work,  but it isn&#39;t possible for <br/>
everyone.  Now,  that said,  I personally have not worked and <br/>
homeschooled.   I worked part-time when my kids were little and again <br/>
when they were both in school.  What I discovered is that I am just <br/>
not very good at juggling my time and energy.  I get very involved in work and <br/>
neglect my family or visa versa.  I admire people who do it.  I&#39;m <br/>
just not very good at it, and I accept that it&#39;s not one of my <br/>
strengths.  Sometimes it&#39;s tempting when things are tight <br/>
financially,  but I usually find another way out.<br/>
<br/>
As far as unschooling and working in the schooled world - my husband <br/>
does this every day.  He&#39;s a college professor.  Sometimes it&#39;s <br/>
frustrating for him,  but I think his students have benefitted from <br/>
our unschooling.  He knows so much more about learning styles and <br/>
understands why some kids are so unprepared for college.  He&#39;s doing <br/>
his part to try to make some changes.  The politics sometimes make it <br/>
hard,  but he tries to remember why he&#39;s there.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be afraid to try some different solutions and see what works.  <br/>
Unschooling shows us that there is more than one way to solve a <br/>
problem and that it&#39;s okay to start down one path and then veer over <br/>
onto another.<br/>

Diane,<br/>
Thanks for the reassurance.  I myself am not having the problems of the roads <br/>
I have choosen as much as the hubby-- he is feeling kind of overwhelmed by <br/>
having to work at a job he hates to support a family that is draining , <br/>
physically and emotionally (we have a toddler, enough said), and even though <br/>
he doesnt want to feel it, he feels like maybe he chose the wrong path, maybe <br/>
this isnt what is going to make him happy, and what should he do about it now <br/>
that hes got two kids and a wife, you know?  I am glad tht he is dealing with <br/>
it all homestly, but its hard for him to see us at home learning and having <br/>
fun, and he cant be a part of that 11 hours out of the day.  I feel this way <br/>
sometimes as do a lot of people I think, but its really giving my husband a <br/>
hard try, if you knwo what I mean.  I thought I owuld get that unjobbing <br/>
book, maybe that would hlep him break out of the rat race he hates so much-- <br/>
got any ideas for me to hlep him get unjobbed?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428293964">I sympathize with you Rachael.  Having a husband unhappy at work can <br/>
really be trying.  We&#39;ve been there.  Sometimes it just helps to keep <br/>
talking about what&#39;s really important to you as a family.  Realizing <br/>
that work isn&#39;t everything makes a big difference.  Good luck with <br/>
unjobbing.<br/>

I can definitely relate.  My husband really hates his job.  It creates <br/>
tension that my son and I are having so much fun and living in so much <br/>
freedom.  I try to compensate by catering to my husband a lot in the evenings <br/>
and on weekends.  (Not easy when son wants dad to do everything for him.)  <br/>
The ultimate solution is for dh to get a better job, or for me to get one.  <br/>
We&#39;re working on it, a tiny bit at a time.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is definately our situation.  My dh is trying to start a business, and <br/>
he goes to school too, so he is busy.  Hopefully this business he is starting <br/>
(powerwashing) will allow him to quit in the spring.  I know exactly what you <br/>
mean about you and your son being so free and having so much fun, and him at <br/>
work, hating it.  That is so much like us.  When we talked the other night, <br/>
he said he sometimes wished we could put them in school so that he and I <br/>
could have a day off.  Maybe we need to hire a babysitter instead.  I am <br/>
actually working now, three nights a week, aiting tables, which I like (free <br/>
food is nice too!), and that helps to take the pressure off.  But it is hard, <br/>
to watch them be so unhappy.  I cater to my husband too, but I wonder if I <br/>
should.<br/>
