<div id="ygrps-yiv-568929280">I believe Leo answered this in another post:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t have relationships with all the other people I<br/>
disagree with.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the saddest thing I&#39;ve read so far.<br/>
I guess that just sums it all up doesn&#39;t it.<br/>
<br/>
Today, we are going to Earth day activities with a good friend of <br/>
ours. She is a devout Christian, supports president Bush and the <br/>
Bible. We totally, completely disagree and we both know it. But we <br/>
love each other like sisters. She doesn&#39;t try to change me, and I <br/>
don&#39;t try to change her, we ACCEPT each other with all our glorius <br/>
differences and focus on the things we both love...which is a lot.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re meeting up with other unschoolers downtown, one family very <br/>
new age, another Mom is atheist with children that range from belief <br/>
in paranormal to one that leans to Buddhist. Our homeschool group is <br/>
immensely diverse. We have friends that are public school <br/>
supporters, one great friend I have is a teacher. She&#39;s also a total <br/>
hippy mama and I love her dearly. The kids that hang out with us are <br/>
mostly public schooled, they also happen to be mostly African <br/>
American. I have friends that are ardent vegans, non-violent, new <br/>
age types. I have friends that are conservative, friends that range <br/>
from lawyers to doctors to artists to writers and those that serve <br/>
in the military. One of our favorite unschool families is serving in <br/>
Turkey right now, adamantly opposed to Bush and the war, yet serving <br/>
in the military and living joyful unschooling lives.<br/>
<br/>
The point?<br/>
My life and my childrens lives are extremely rich because of the <br/>
diverse group of friends we have. My children have learned to try <br/>
and see issues from many different viewpoints. They are very <br/>
comfortable around MANY types of people with all their varying <br/>
beliefs.<br/>
We learn so much from all these diverse friendships. Another cool <br/>
thing is when a topic comes up, we always have a friend to call to <br/>
get more information. From metal sculpture to tie dye, to computer <br/>
programming, laws, medical information and building. We can easily <br/>
join drumming circles, visit the EPA, record music in a studio or <br/>
get help with our computer. That&#39;s just a small sampling of the <br/>
skills that our friendships surround us with.<br/>
<br/>
Tolerance is important. <br/>
I don&#39;t tolerate idiocy or stupidity very well. But I can tolerate <br/>
other views, as long as they aren&#39;t trying to shove something down <br/>
my throat repeatedly.<br/>
It would behoove you to learn tolerance for your child&#39;s sake.<br/>

I guess Leonor&#39;s problem was that she defined everyone else as stupid, or an <br/>
idiot. <br/>
So she couldn&#39;t tolerate anyone.<br/>
