<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590724190">The other day I had heard a story (or read a story...who knows where I got<br/>
it..haha) but anyhow, it peeked my interest in something.  I was wondering<br/>
if there was a list of video games and computer games where it notes what<br/>
most &quot;school&quot; families would consider the games benefits.<br/>
<br/>
For example, it would say something like this:<br/>
<br/>
Neopets<br/>
(Writing, reading, math, reasoning, and so on)<br/>
<br/>
I thought if it does not exist, then it that it would be a fun to come up<br/>
with one and post it somewhere for the critics.  When my husband and I began<br/>
our &quot;video and computer games aren&#39;t bad&quot; detox, that information like that<br/>
would have helped Dave and I.<br/>

That would be so over-simplified, though, and not give some of the  <br/>
deeper advantages of playing so hard with something that has  <br/>
limitations and secret corners of the programming maybe no one the  <br/>
kid knows has found, and like that.<br/>

As usual, it&#39;s more toward the philosophical and expansive than the  <br/>
simplified list-stuff (except the now-becoming-outdated list of games  <br/>
with strong female leads).<br/>

Scholastic Books has a computer games subdivision.  We ordered many  <br/>
things from them many years back.<br/>
They&#39;re glad to deal with homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Ah... I went to look, and it&#39;s been reorganized.  But maybe you can  <br/>
look there and see what you find:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://shop.scholastic.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?">http://shop.scholastic.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?</a> <br/>
storeId=10101&catalogId=10004&langId=-1&categoryId=13691&viewParam=Depar <br/>
tmentTopLevelCategory<br/>
<br/>
You might have to put that address back together.<br/>
Or just go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://scholastic.com">http://scholastic.com</a> and poke around.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s a very detailed analysis of every puzzle on Zoombinis.  I  <br/>
think it&#39;s linked form my videogames page.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I never had to detox over video games.  My wife and were playing video<br/>
games long before our kids came along, so for us it&#39;s something we do<br/>
together.  Some families might prefer board games, while we like to<br/>
sneak around the jungle and shoot at each other.<br/>
More along the lines of the question asked, though not quite, my son<br/>
got a real boost the first time he beat me at a game.  I&#39;ve used that<br/>
as an example to him when he felt something might be too big a<br/>
challenge or too hard for him.  After many attempts at riding his bike<br/>
for example, he complained that it was too hard.  I could tell that he<br/>
wanted to figure it out, and I could see that he was on the verge of<br/>
that click where the balance and speed all come together.  So I<br/>
reminded him of the time when he never beat me at Tony Hawk.  Then he<br/>
began to beat me pretty regularly and actually made me work at it. <br/>
All he had done, I reminded him, was to keep trying, to keep doing his<br/>
best.<br/>
Right now, it&#39;s cold and a little ick outside.  He&#39;s got all day to<br/>
confront his current video game interest, Twisted Metal 4.  His goal<br/>
is to beat the game with individual characters in order to open the<br/>
films about each character.  So maybe he&#39;s learning to set goals, to<br/>
follow through and to work hard for something you find valuable.  Or<br/>
maybe he just loves blowing things up.<br/>
For me personally, there isn&#39;t really any &quot;learning&quot; more important<br/>
than the fun I have playing video games with my son or my wife.  Buy<br/>
extra controllers and multiplayer games.  Parents should take their<br/>
own turn playing the games.  That&#39;s the best experience in<br/>
understanding them.</div>
