<div id="ygrps-yiv-380885216">Hi, neighbor Kathie!<br/>
<br/>
	I&#39;m in Moncks Corner. My daughter is 16; just pulled her out of public<br/>
school in May. We&#39;ve been unschooling since and will continue to do so.<br/>
It&#39;s new for both of us!<br/>
<br/>
	No, I&#39;m not with a support group. There is one that meets monthly at<br/>
our church (First Baptist), but I&#39;m not interested. Everyone around here<br/>
looks at me like I&#39;m crazy when I mention unschooling. That support<br/>
group has nothing we need. The families in our church (and most others<br/>
around here) are homeschooling young/younger children and are using<br/>
strictly Christian curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
	Have you found ANY kind of an unschooling community here in the<br/>
Lowcountry? <br/>
<br/>
			Peace,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
