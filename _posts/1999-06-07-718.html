<div id="ygrps-yiv-55982625"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;Is there anyone on the list who is completely unschooling?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are with Dana, the 3 yo.  I like to consider us radical unschoolers, but if she ever desires something different, I will assist her in anyway she requests.<br/>
