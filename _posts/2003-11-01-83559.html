<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604811310">I am feeling so sad right now.  You know, the decisions we make as <br/>
parents affect so much more than ourselves and our immediate <br/>
families.  They affect other people too -- parents of our childrens&#39; <br/>
friends, for instance, especially those who don&#39;t parent the same way <br/>
we do, and then divisions happen.  I&#39;m watching an old friendship <br/>
die, and a potential one wither, and it makes me very sad.<br/>
<br/>
We have always practiced what I call respectful parenting.  We have <br/>
tried our best, over the years, not to be authoritarian in any way, <br/>
but to engender an atmosphere of mutual respect in our home.  As a <br/>
result, we have often allowed our children to make their own <br/>
mistakes, and then helped them to learn how to maturely face the <br/>
consequences of their actions.<br/>
<br/>
Well, my dd, Nikki, is now 18 and is off at college.  We were unable <br/>
to get her on-campus housing, so against our initial instincts, <br/>
rented her an apartment near campus.  Her best friend attends the <br/>
same school, and got on the dorm list early enough.  We adore this <br/>
girl -- she is almost like a second daughter to us, and we have made <br/>
good friends with her single mother, though we have sometimes quietly <br/>
questioned her parenting style.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, a month ago our dd informed us that she wants to have her <br/>
boyfriend move in with her.  Surprisingly, I wasn&#39;t as distressed by <br/>
the news as I always imagined I might be.  I figure, if she&#39;s going <br/>
to be sleeping with a long-term (almost a year) boyfriend anyway, why <br/>
not be honest about it?  I really would prefer that she not make this <br/>
decision at this time -- I wish she&#39;d waited awhile, but the fact of <br/>
the matter is that she&#39;s in this intense relationship, and things are <br/>
going to happen no matter what we say or do.  We&#39;ve talked about <br/>
staying focused on priorities and about self-protection, and about <br/>
all those other things, but basically this is her decision.  Yes, we <br/>
are paying her rent, but if we refused to allow this, he&#39;d just be <br/>
there all the time anyway.  What are we going to do -- put her into a <br/>
chastity belt?  Even if she were in the dorm, they&#39;d be finding <br/>
ways.  I was 18 once, too.  I remember.  I figure that we got 18 <br/>
years to help her to develop an internal moral, ethical, <br/>
psychologically mature compass (or to begin to).  Now she&#39;s got to <br/>
figure it out on her own.  And we&#39;re here to help, support, and love <br/>
her as she stumbles through it.<br/>
<br/>
I just found out today that her friend&#39;s mother has pronounced Nikki <br/>
a slut, and has forbidden her daughter to have anything more to do <br/>
with her.  (Yeah, like that&#39;s going to happen.) What makes me so sad <br/>
about this is that last year, when her daughter had a miscarriage <br/>
after an unplanned pregnancy, we stood by Nik&#39;s friend and loved her <br/>
through the trauma of it all.  We have encouraged and supported her <br/>
as her mother has called her fat, has refused to get her help for <br/>
learning disabilities in school, has grounded her for bad grades, <br/>
blah, blah, blah.  And she has the nerve to call my daughter a slut <br/>
and to write her off, just like that, after all these years of <br/>
supposedly caring for her too?<br/>
<br/>
We had something similar (in a way) to this happen recently to my <br/>
son, too.  He&#39;s 15, still at home, very independent thinking.  He <br/>
played a joke at a party a couple of months ago, patterned on <br/>
something he&#39;d seen on a stupid TV show that he likes to watch -- I <br/>
think it&#39;s called *Jackass.*  Just silly juvenile stuff, but actually <br/>
pretty funny, I thought, when he told me about it.  He sniffed dried <br/>
mustard as a stunt.  He didn&#39;t do it to try to get high or anything, <br/>
he was just being silly.  He&#39;s 15.  Wrong.  The parents of the boy <br/>
who was hosting the party are traditional school-at-homers, and <br/>
they&#39;ve decided that my ds is a bad influence on their precious boy --<br/>
 will lead him off into a druggie lifestyle or something.  He is no <br/>
longer welcome at their house.<br/>
<br/>
When in the WORLD did I become such a bad parent?  I have two <br/>
children who love and respect me and their dad, who are responsible <br/>
and fun to be with.  They care about themselves, others, and the <br/>
world they live in.  They have hopes and plans for the future.  They <br/>
dream big.  And they think for themselves.  They are independent.  <br/>
Have wild senses of humor. (MUSTARD?!)  They have seen love modeled <br/>
in their home and believe that they have the right to experience that <br/>
sort of love, themselves, and are not afraid to take a risk, to go <br/>
after it.  I happen to think they&#39;re pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
How is it that, by choosing this path of respectful parenting, I now <br/>
am having to cushion my loving, fresh, free children from the <br/>
criticism of a world that says there&#39;s something wrong with them?<br/>
<br/>
Grrr.<br/>

************************************<br/>
And you&#39;d put her in the position of having to lie to you about his being <br/>
there.  At least she was honest enough to let you know what their plans are.  <br/>
BTW, my 19 yo is living with her boyfriend also, has been for almost a year now.  <br/>
Like you said...what are you gonna do?<br/>

<br/>
Jealousy and dismay.  Lashing out in vague frustration and pain.<br/>
Breathe and let it pass.<br/>
<br/>
Her friend won&#39;t be impressed with her mother&#39;s attitude.  Let her see a <br/>
better one from you!<br/>
<br/>
Did you help her through a miscarriage of a pregnancy her mom didn&#39;t even <br/>
know about?  If so, you WAY have the upper hand in all things social and moral, <br/>
and you can sleep peacefully.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The parents of the boy <br/>
<br/>
who was hosting the party are traditional school-at-homers&gt;&gt;  DOH!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They care about themselves, others, and the <br/>
<br/>
world they live in.  They have hopes and plans for the future.  They <br/>
<br/>
dream big.  And they think for themselves. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then they must know already that some people are not as thoughtful as they <br/>
are.  They just need to learn to step around them and keep on going.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How is it that, by choosing this path of respectful parenting, I now <br/>
<br/>
am having to cushion my loving, fresh, free children from the <br/>
<br/>
criticism of a world that says there&#39;s something wrong with them?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to cushion them.  You, too, just need to let some friendships <br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
I went all through my 20s childless, and had friends who were no longer <br/>
interested in hanging out with me once I was pregnant.  I understood that.  I went <br/>
through toddler-days with some of the remaining friends who seemed to figure <br/>
if they stuck around four or five years my kids would be big enough and in <br/>
school and our adult friendship could get back to hours of hanging out without <br/>
kids.  They eventually wandered off.  I had a friend who used to think a lot like <br/>
I did, and had kids when I did, and when it became apparent I wasn&#39;t going to <br/>
say &quot;good idea&quot; about her negativity regarding children, she went away.   <br/>
<br/>
In every case in which I&#39;ve &quot;lost a friend,&quot; what I was losing was a critic, <br/>
an obstacle.<br/>
<br/>
The friends I&#39;ve gained by maintaining my integrity are better than those who <br/>
would have demanded I compromise it to keep them in my life.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Good advice, breathing and letting it pass, but losing a friendship hurts, <br/>
and my dd is hurting too.  Just life, I suppose.  We are both confident in <br/>
our <br/>
positions on this, though.  Not feeling insecure or inferior.  It&#39;s a <br/>
blessing <br/>
to see my Nikki handling it so well. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But her friend is at the edge of being grown, and her  mother can&#39;t really <br/>
tell her who to hang out with any more now that she&#39;s not living at home.  There <br/>
will be a few more years when the mom THINKS she can, but every such <br/>
statement is likely to backfire entirely.   So in just a few years (two?  three?) <br/>
you&#39;ll have two individual relationships.  No, three apiece!  Your daughter will <br/>
or won&#39;t have a relationship with her friend, and the friend&#39;s mom.  You; same. <br/>
 Other friend will  have a worse or better relationship with you, Nikki, and <br/>
her own mom.  But the days of &quot;mother may I will be over very soon.<br/>

Same here. I wrote an email last night asking the list about loosing friends <br/>
and feeling as if we have grown apart. I deleted it....  I know that my friend <br/>
and I have become distant and though we talk daily we have two very different <br/>
parenting styles. <br/>
I have allowed my disagreement in hers style to be ignored because I <br/>
respected her so much and felt she was a better parent than I at times. I have come to <br/>
realize that all the trips they take and money they spend doesn&#39;t mean a <br/>
thing when they spank and ruin the fun.<br/>
<br/>
I talked to my husband about it last night and he too is very uncomfortable <br/>
with their parenting style. I told him I will allow it some more time but I <br/>
wont be calling as much as I have been.<br/>
