<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699601880">Thank you everyone. This discussion has made me think. I never really<br/>
placed an importance on the whole issue. I just figured if he was<br/>
interested that week, he could help with &quot;his&quot; chores (trash,<br/>
room...)and earn some money, or not do it at all and not earn the money.<br/>
I had never been very consistent with it. As a child I never had chores<br/>
and never had an allowance, so I figured it would be neat to try. He<br/>
hasn&#39;t been very interested in it at all, so maybe we can let it go. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my son to be prepared for the world by torturing him<br/>
either. And, his room and play area gets very messy before I ask him to<br/>
help clean it up. I usually only ask when I am cleaning the floors and<br/>
need the space empty! <br/>
<br/>
I do appreciate the fact that the list challenges my comfort zones. I<br/>
guess we are just not ready to do the money thing until I am able to let<br/>
go of the attachments to it. And all the &quot;schoolish&quot; ideas buried deep<br/>
in my brain. All the preparedness garbage I have lived through. I AM<br/>
trying to be more comfortable with letting go and letting my kids do<br/>
their thing on their own to learn what they will. <br/>
<br/>
Keep it all coming...PLEASE..challenge my beliefs and what I do! I know<br/>
nothing! <br/>

You get in first, then get used to it. Jump in Annette! Once you do the money thing you&#39;ll find your attachments fade pretty fast. :)<br/>
