<br/>
I have a basically-only child (2 half-siblings living 2000 miles away and<br/>
15 and 17 years older). She&#39;s always spent a lot of time with other kids,<br/>
of all ages, in large and small groups and one-on-one. She also spends a<br/>
lot of time by herself... it seems to have peaks and valleys, but a day<br/>
when she doesn&#39;t play with or do something with at least one other kid<br/>
(between the ages of 2 and 17) is rare. When she was younger, like 3-5,<br/>
it happened with a little more frequency, but she would play with the<br/>
school kids after school most days. <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry about how much other people seek out or arrange - just<br/>
about what works best for your kid. One of Rain&#39;s closest friends now (2<br/>
yrs younger) did not want to have anything to do with other kids until<br/>
she was around 4 (luckily, she got a sister a few months later).<br/>
<br/>
Also, have you gotten active with a local homeschool group? None of the<br/>
groups I&#39;ve been part of have had age limits, and kids that grow up<br/>
within that community seem to have the easiest time dealing with the<br/>
&quot;everyone else is going to school but me&quot; thing. There always seem to be<br/>
nice ultiage tribes of kids roaming the parks, at least with good hs<br/>
groups....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153395170">I also have a practically only child (13yo half bro visits once a <br/>
week).  My daughter is 5 years old.  For the past year she has craved <br/>
sooo much social contact with other kids, that I&#39;ve had a hard time <br/>
fullfilling her wishes.  She said she wants to go to school, so I put <br/>
her in kindergarten.  I found a &#39;good&#39; one, open and arts-integrated, <br/>
no formal learning this year.  Still, it&#39;s a school, and don&#39;t like <br/>
her having to be around 21 other kids 3 hours a day.  I think it <br/>
should be a child&#39;s choice to go to school or not, so though I want <br/>
to unschool her, I struggle with the decision.  <br/>

better than social time with other kids.  I know parents who <br/>
homeschool and don&#39;t expose their children to other adults, and their <br/>
children are socially retarded.  Look at kids who&#39;ve spent there <br/>
childhood in daycares around other children.  I know I don&#39;t want my <br/>
daughter acting like them either. <br/>
<br/>
I am starting to question the value of her having lots of time with <br/>
kids her age.  I think I pushed her into it when she was 3, thinking <br/>
she needed to have peer friends, and now I regret it. I wish I had <br/>
encouraged her to enjoy being by herself more at that age. I think <br/>
it&#39;s great that she&#39;s outgoing, but I see that she tries too hard to <br/>
impress her friends and is not discovering who she is.  I am slowly <br/>
changing her mind about school (I can&#39;t imagine she&#39;d like spending 7 <br/>
hours a day there next year)  and trying to find a small group of <br/>
homeschooled children for her to play with.    <br/>

My first was an only child for 9 years. Not only was I not familiar with <br/>
babies in general, but I had no friends who had kids her age. All my friends <br/>
were older and had started much younger having kids. So Tara was pretty much <br/>
alone with just adults for her first 4 years. The result was a very vocal <br/>
and mature child at a very young age. By the age of 2, an adult could <br/>
actually sit and have a conversation with her. I mean a real converstation. <br/>
When I would take her to a rare occasion where there were other little kids, <br/>
she would refuse to play with them. Always said they did stupid stuff that <br/>
she wasn&#39;t interested in. I took her everywhere with me, but again she was <br/>
only around adults. She had one cousin 10 months younger that she played <br/>
with at the most, once a week.<br/>
<br/>
When I had to send her to preschool, she was teachers pet and refused to <br/>
play with the kids. She still tells horror stories of how awful it was. She <br/>
never really hung out with kids until like 3rd grade. She considered herself <br/>
a nerd until like 6th grade. Then she started going straight to the I want <br/>
to be grown up stage. Pretty sad. Now she&#39;s great and very social but she <br/>
missed a lot of being a kid. I&#39;m sure some of it was just her personality <br/>
but a lot of it was also me screwing up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717069659">We have had several only children be regulars at our house over the years.  <br/>
One current one is an only and very introverted.  He doesn&#39;t mind being the <br/>
only at his house most days.  And when he&#39;s here he&#39;s not the guest of any <br/>
one particular person.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re the parents of an only, don&#39;t feel you have to reciprocate hour for <br/>
hour (or maybe at all) if your child visits families with several.  For me, <br/>
having four instead of three is not much change.  And often my kids will <br/>
behave better if we have company (especially when they were younger) than if <br/>
we don&#39;t, so the borrowed kid was a catalyst for more civilized interactions, <br/>
and it was someone else to play multi-player games with and so on.  But if <br/>
his mom took all my three, the difference for her between one and FOUR is <br/>
huge.<br/>
<br/>
So don&#39;t feel bad if a larger family has your only over a lot.  It&#39;s probably <br/>
good for their family too.  Sometimes his mom sends $20 for food, and <br/>
sometimes she sends real food!  Sometimes nothing, sometimes we watch the <br/>
poodle too, sometimes he&#39;s here a week.  No problem.<br/>

I hear this all the time from parents of Tara&#39;s friends and also from other <br/>
friends of mine that I let their kids come over. Sometimes Tara will have <br/>
2-3 over and then one for the younger ones will be here. People always think <br/>
it must be so disruptive to me having so many around. Like you said, what&#39;s <br/>
the big deal? Having 2-3 extra when I have 4 already is not much of a <br/>
difference. Of course I would never expect them to take all of mine. <br/>
Actually, I get more done when friends are over. They keep each other <br/>
busier! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>

Rain spends a lot more time visiting friends than they spend visiting<br/>
here, and it&#39;s always been this way. It just seemed to work out better -<br/>
most of her visits are with *families* of kids, even if one is her age<br/>
and they do most stuff together, the other siblings are generally part of<br/>
at least some of the interactions, and when we just invite the one kid<br/>
over they both often miss the sibling - if I take Rain and a friend out<br/>
for ice cream, they&#39;ve always wanted to buy one for the sibling left at<br/>
home. Sometimes it is nice, though, so they can just closet themselves<br/>
away and play long uninterrupted imagination games for hours. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it seems like the more kids you have, the harder it is to pack<br/>
them all up for a visit, and the more stressed I get when they&#39;re here,<br/>
to be honest. I&#39;m used to certain levels of actvity and noise and chaos -<br/>
we had a party here a few weeks ago with 50+ unschoolers of all ages<br/>
(spread out over the 3 houses and a few tents on the farm) and while it<br/>
was great fun, I also felt frazzled most of the time, and had to keep<br/>
ducking out for some quiet interactions with my anti-social friend and<br/>
the ball games. I&#39;m really more of an introvert, and Rain right now seems<br/>
much more extraverted.<br/>
<br/>
I try to do other things - bring food, buy pizza, babysit at their house,<br/>
run errands - that are easier for me. <br/>
<br/>
And lots of people tell me how wonderful Rain is, and how much they love<br/>
having her over, and that makes me feel really good. I have one email<br/>
friend who I&#39;ve known for almost 7 years now, who apparently knew a lot<br/>
of only children who didn&#39;t play well with younger siblings, and she<br/>
assumed that that was typical, and never seemed to believe me when I said<br/>
Rain wasn&#39;t like that. We&#39;ve gotten together a handful of times in person<br/>
now, and the last time she told me that her girls (Rain&#39;s age and a few<br/>
years older) had told her with some amazement that Rain really *was* good<br/>
with younger kids. She had played a game of chess with their younger<br/>
brother, and had spent most of the rest of the day with a friend&#39;s 2 year<br/>
old on her hip. So that felt good... and there were times when she handed<br/>
me the 2 yr old and quietly mentioned that they were trying to play<br/>
pollies and they were too little for E to play with, and I was happy to<br/>
take her out to collect eggs for half an hour or so. I sorta like having<br/>
a 2 yr old sometimes, too..<br/>
<br/>
This got long and off-subject and sort of braggy, and I&#39;m sorry... I<br/>
guess this is a skill she has that I&#39;m really proud of, something many<br/>
people told me she wouldn&#39;t be good at, so I had to mention it.<br/>

<br/>
Was she used to &quot;school kids&quot;?<br/>
Because we&#39;ve found homeschooled kids don&#39;t seem to care how old the others <br/>
are, but kids in school are way hesitant to associate with those &quot;below them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty has been hanging around with a guy who&#39;s a senior in high school.  <br/>
Marty would be an 8th grader if he were in school.   But because Marty is NOT <br/>
an 8th grader, the older kid can socialize with him fine. &lt;g&gt;  (Also they met <br/>
because of Kirby and the gaming shop, so it slowly became a non-issue.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-This got long and off-subject and sort of braggy, and I&#39;m sorry... I<br/>

<br/>
It didn&#39;t seem off subject to me, but a really good point to make about <br/>
homeschooled kids in groups of varied ages.   <br/>
<br/>
Marty broke off with one friend because Marty couldn&#39;t stand the way the boy <br/>
treated his younger brother, and when Marty tried to include the younger one, <br/>
the older one would be meaner still.  So Marty quit going over, and finally <br/>
asked me to tell the Grandmother (who was raising them) why.  Another similar <br/>
situation came up, but Marty was older (8 the first time, 10 or 11 the second <br/>
time) and just talked to the boy himself, and sometimes when he&#39;s there, he <br/>
just plays with the younger brother all on his own.<br/>

I know they had one only-child friend who always tried to exclude younger<br/>
brother, and I think, from things she&#39;d said, that she felt some sense of<br/>
loss about how her relationship with her oldest child changed after she<br/>
had more children, and so she tried really hard to convince herself that<br/>
having siblings was The Best Thing That Could have Happened to this kid.<br/>
And it probably was a really good thing for her, because she was and<br/>
still is the type of kid who is very introverted and doesn&#39;t make friends<br/>
easily, and having siblings gave her a ready-made safe group of people to<br/>
hang out with while she gained some confidence in herself. And they all<br/>
love each other and are very close and have fun together, I&#39;m not saying<br/>
having lots of kids isn&#39;t a good thing... but I think there&#39;s also a loss<br/>
of the old whenever you add something new.<br/>

Rain is an only child basically by accident, which is fine, it&#39;s worked<br/>
out for us, but it wasn&#39;t by design. I&#39;m the oldest of three, and I am<br/>

wanted to go horseback riding,which meant we were limited to 9 guests<br/>
because that&#39;s how many horses they had. Usually we&#39;d invite whole<br/>
families to her parties, but this year I told her that we wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
able to invite 9 people plus all their younger brothers and sisters, it<br/>
had to be just 9 people. We were okay with the first few kids, because<br/>
their siblings were babies at the time, and then we got to her friend<br/>
Annie and Annie&#39;s 5 yr old brother, Joe. I reminded her that we were just<br/>
inviting friends, not little brothers, and she told me quite firmly that<br/>
Joe was not a Little Brother, he was Friend Too. Mea Culpa. I learned...<br/>

friend who I&#39;ve known for almost 7 years now, who apparently knew a lot<br/>
of only children who didn&#39;t play well with younger siblings, and she<br/>
assumed that that was typical, and never seemed to believe me when I said<br/>
Rain wasn&#39;t like that. We&#39;ve gotten together a handful of times in person<br/>
now, and the last time she told me that her girls (Rain&#39;s age and a few<br/>
years older) had told her with some amazement that Rain really *was* good<br/>
with younger kids. She had played a game of chess with their younger<br/>
brother, and had spent most of the rest of the day with a friend&#39;s 2 year<br/>
old on her hip. So that felt good... and there were times when she handed<br/>
me the 2 yr old and quietly mentioned that they were trying to play<br/>
pollies and they were too little for E to play with, and I was happy to<br/>
take her out to collect eggs for half an hour or so. I sorta like having<br/>
a 2 yr old sometimes, too..<br/>
<br/>
This got long and off-subject and sort of braggy, and I&#39;m sorry... I<br/>
guess this is a skill she has that I&#39;m really proud of, something many<br/>
people told me she wouldn&#39;t be good at, so I had to mention it.<br/>
