<br>I guess I&#39;d try to think of this like any other unschooling thing -- support it, facilitate it, create the environment that allows the child to explore and learn.
<br>
<br>With that in mind, I guess I wouldn&#39;t worry much about my own personal &quot;beliefs&quot; or lack of them -- I&#39;d try to put myself into &quot;learning&quot; mode along with him. 
<br>
<br>I wouldn&#39;t limit learning about spirituality or religion to booklearning, though. Talking to people involved in specific relgions or spiritual paths, visiting locations such as temples, religious retreats, churches, meditation classes, watching movies that have spiritual themes? I don&#39;t know - just some ideas.
