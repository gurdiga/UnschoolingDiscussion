<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819801229">I just joined the list. Hi!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 3 and I just read How Children Learn. I&#39;ve always <br/>
tried to express my belief that the process of &quot;teaching and <br/>
schooling&quot; is ineffective and not really how learning happens, and <br/>
this fine book has given a clear exposition to my suspicions. <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that much of what we need to do is suppress the <br/>
inclination to teach. Sometimes it gets into fuzzy territory and I <br/>
wonder which side I should err on. I know there is no &quot;answer&quot; but I <br/>
would like to hear some thoughts on the matter. Here&#39;s what I mean...<br/>
<br/>
The other day we were on the computer. She asks me how to spell words <br/>
and I tell her the letters and she types them out. Occasionally she <br/>
types a wrong key.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do at that point?<br/>
Hit delete and type the corret letter?<br/>
Say &quot;oops&quot; and hit delete and wait for her move?<br/>
Hit delete and say the letter again?<br/>
Just say the next letter and see if she notices?<br/>
Just wait and see what she wants to do?<br/>
Other?<br/>
<br/>
{Yes I know I think too much.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ask her what she wants you to do about it and then follow her lead.  As she <br/>
learns, what she wants you to do about it will change.  I remember how tortuous <br/>
it was for my youngest when he was about that age, and he had to start over <br/>
or use the backspace key.  He had to learn how to do it.  He had to learn the <br/>
entire concept of what erasing and backspacing was all about, and about making <br/>
mistakes and why he might want to make it just right.  The hunting and pecking <br/>
was a slow process (and writing letters, too) and he rarely looked at the <br/>
screen until he was done, so he didn&#39;t see his mistakes.    <br/>
<br/>
To tell the truth, at 3 he wasn&#39;t concerned much about whether it was &quot;right&quot; <br/>
or not.  At some point he moved on to scribbling through a letter if he <br/>
didn&#39;t think it was right (when writing), or asking me if &quot;they&quot; would know that <br/>
this was an &quot;s&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Mostly what I did was ask him if what he wanted me to do if he messed one up. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
{Yes I know I think too much.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I use the multipurpose &quot;Tell me if you need help!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At three, if she knows the letters and sees she&#39;s made a mistake, she can ask <br/>
for help.  If she doesn&#39;t know she made a mistake, then it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
So of your options, I&#39;d say &quot;Wait and see what she wants to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a program which speaks the word if she&#39;s right or something spiffy, <br/>
she&#39;ll get feedback from that of the error and will ask for help, probably.<br/>
<br/>
I let most of my kids&#39; writing and spelling errors lie, unless I know they <br/>
need what they&#39;re writing to be as perfect as possible.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly wrote &quot;sood&quot; for &quot;should&quot; last night, and I might show her today how to <br/>
spell &quot;should,&quot; for two reasons:<br/>
<br/>
She highlighted that line in an instant message and said she saved it for me <br/>
so I could help her get together with her friend.  The line was <br/>
<br/>
&quot;we sood get r moms to talk and get together that way&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She knows how to spell &quot;are,&quot; but was shorthanding it.<br/>
<br/>
Second reason is that yesterday the said she was going to name her kids all <br/>
one-syllable names but spell them with at least six letters, all kinds of <br/>
silent combos.  I told her that was mean to do to poor little kids.  We laughed <br/>
about it.  So to point out that the one-syllable &quot;should&quot; has six letters will <br/>
tie in with yesterday&#39;s conversation, and she&#39;ll probably remember it forever. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s 11, though.  With a three year old I think I&#39;d gauge their mood and <br/>
interest, and maybe just correct one thing per session, or if they asked.<br/>

bows to the light within you.&#39; In other words, beyond our achy bones,<br/>
our tired feet and our multi-colored real life soap operas, lurks a<br/>
dimension that is more than the body, the persona, the ego and all the<br/>
&#39;trappings and the suits of woe&#39; as Hamlet would say---a dimension where<br/>
there isn&#39;t a &#39;you&#39; and &#39;me&#39; but rather a synergy that is more than all<br/>
that, a space for the eternal to rest within the temporal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481093531">I&#39;m haveing a bit of a problem, and was hoping that someone may be able to offer a little help, advice, direction...<br/>
<br/>
I am very much commited to unschooling my boys and I know that one of the best examples that I can show them is to follow my own passions and dreams. This is really where I&#39;m having the problem. I have things that I am interested in, things that I want to do, and learn about, see and explore. I have the desires and I can begin, but it seems as soon as I start to really enjoy and get into something, I start to here these voices, voices of my parents, teachers, guidence counslers, asking me where this is all going to lead, is it essental to my future and will it make me money. I start to doubt myself and look at what I&#39;m doing as something silly and not worth while. I see all the things I should be doing, laundry, dishes, and feel guilty for looking into something just for the fun of it.<br/>
<br/>
I know I need to get past this, I just really don&#39;t know how.<br/>
<br/>
I come from a family that has put worth only on the things in life that get you higher up the ladder of sucess. Free time was used to pursue things worth while in my parents eyes. If it didn&#39;t take you somewhere or give you something to go further up. You didn&#39;t do it. Money has always been the MOST important thing to my parents and if you didn&#39;t have the desire to have more, then there is/was something wrong with you.<br/>
<br/>
I have managed to get past some of this, but it&#39;s been 26 years of being told how to be, and it is so at odds with where my heart tells me I need to be.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for listning to this long ramble. Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>

That might help. <br/>

It might not.<br/>
<br/>
You could look up the tuition at some private schools in your area to see how <br/>
much money you&#39;re saving by homeschooling!  Or at least figure out the cost <br/>
of public school fees, clothes, special school supplies, uniforms, gym stuff, <br/>

some years, at $450 or so.  I was amazed.<br/>

I&#39;d love to tell you the date or the reference to the study or something<br/>

I spent most of my life feeling at odds with myself.

I decided to become the person I had always been, deep inside. I started wearing chunky jewelry, wild makeup and funky hairstyles. It helped me believe in the vision I had of myself, and act out in ways that matched the look. <br/>

Have you looked into mandalas or henna designs?<br/>
<br/>
Most of the fractals that we found, when we were looking into our wedding tatoos, were to big and really hard for the artist to do. <br/>
<br/>
We found that mandalas and the different henna designs were a good substitue for the fractals, and easier for the artist, and the wallet. ;^)<br/>
<br/>
I think I might have some of the images we were looking at saved, if you want, I can see if I can pull them up.<br/>

Oh yah... we are saving a bundle, the closest preK day care type thing is sooooo expensive, my mom still owes them money from having my little brother there years ago, he started 5th grade this year.<br/>
<br/>
And the lists of items they need to have in class is long and expensive. The local kindergarten&#39;s list is almost a long as the highschool list, and very few items on it are fun, like crayons, glitter glue, stuff like that.<br/>

It&#39;s funny, I got it off a coffee cup that my dad got for me(and it broke a few days after I set up my sig line), and it&#39;s his voice that I hear the most. I know that he&#39;s been going through a lot of personal growth and letting go of stuff lately. We don&#39;t live near each other and we don&#39;t get to talk much. He&#39;s the only on in the family that is fully supporting us in not just homeschooling the boys, but unschooling, he gets it.<br/>
<br/>
I think I need to get to know who he is now, not who is was when I was a kid.<br/>

I had kinda found myself during highschool, mostly because I never went and instead hung out at the collage next door to the high school and at coffee shops talking to anyone and everyone about life.<br/>
<br/>
But when had Jaiden I decided that moms don&#39;t dye their hair or where funky clothes, or spend time talking to odd people about life. Not sure where this idea came from, but it came and it stuck for years. I&#39;ve been trying for the past 6-8months to break out of this place that I built up, but it&#39;s hard, I isolated myself for so long that I don&#39;t really remember how to be in the world.<br/>

for me! <br/>
<br/>
I never really sat and thought about it until more recently, but I guess I <br/>
have done the same thing. Meaning that I don&#39;t dress anything like who I am or <br/>
what I like. I dress in what fits and very &quot;mom-like&quot;. Before I had the twins <br/>
and especially in high school, I was a serious tomboy. I lived at the beach, <br/>
skateboarded everywhere and if something wasn&#39;t torn, I didn&#39;t wear it. Kass is <br/>
critical like me and really questions everything, she dresses nothing like I <br/>
did, until I got to college. Kree is a tomboy and dresses exactly like I did in <br/>
high school. Skulls on everything, the bigger and baggier the better. Rather <br/>
wear boxers than girly undies. The difference is I didn&#39;t get to dress like <br/>
that until I was in high school and rebelled (which by the way, was my BIG <br/>
rebellion). They get to be who they are now. I don&#39;t know if watching them brings <br/>
me to a place that I loved and now miss about myself, or if it just strikes me <br/>
as weird, that although they are so different, they are both like me in many <br/>
ways. I wonder often if I got to be the size I was then and I actually dressed <br/>
the way I loved, if they would just die of embarrassment at a mom who feels so <br/>
at home in &quot;Hot Topic&quot;. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
