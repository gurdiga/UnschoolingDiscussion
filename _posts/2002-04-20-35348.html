Of course we aren&#39;t doing the same things, but we are interested in <br/>
supporting and discussing what unschooling is and is not.<br/>
Lessons are not unschooling, unless the child actually wanted <br/>
it....but kids that are unschooled see the whole world as learning <br/>
and don&#39;t typically see lessons as the best way to get info. they <br/>
need.<br/>
As you journey along, you will see that they can actually impede the <br/>
learning process.<br/>
Now if lessons is how you do things, that is totally your <br/>
business...I won&#39;t disparage that. And trading lessons with another <br/>
family may be what you&#39;re looking for.<br/>
But in an unschooling context, this isn&#39;t necessary.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you  mean &quot;here we go discussing &gt;unschooling again&quot;?<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ll do that as long as the list lasts!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I meant here we go again, instead of giving her answers to her actual question, we get to hear once again the definitions of &#39;un-schooling&#39;  instead of offering actual suggestions about how to go about what she was asking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I doubt you mean to suggest that doing &gt;lessons and discussing how to trade <br/>
&gt;doing lessons with another family is a good &gt;topic for the unschooling list, <br/>
&gt;or a topic on which someone will get &gt;teaching-oriented advice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would not suggest such a thing, nor would I suggest to anyone that anything they ask about is not a good topic, because all questions are valid, except those left unasked.  Life is learning, and we dont find out the answers until we ask the questions, ofcourse my response directly to her would have been a bit more constructive, such as explaining to her how we go about learning math in my unschooling household, not criticizing her choice to ask a question on this list.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Perhaps she is quite happy with how she is doing this. Perhaps her daughter <br/>
does enjoy it, and perhaps it doesnt matter one way or the other what she <br/>
calls it...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think it matters on an unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Her household doesnt live on this list, and frankly I dont choose my words to &#39;fit&#39; anyone elses ideas or use words that others think are more appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
If people say&lt;&lt; If you don&#39;t do lessons, then it does not apply<br/>
  to you.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
or<br/>
&quot;If your kids go to school every day, then it doesn&#39;t apply to you&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;then I bet someone is going to say &gt;<br/>
&gt;something about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ofcourse, and suggesting ways in which math is more naturally learned as opposed to lessons is a wonderful response. Not exactly what was done tho was it? I believe her statement was meant to say just that, if my question doesnt apply to how YOU choose to unschool then no response is necessary. Ofcourse there will always have to be these lil comments wont there?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And I don&#39;t think &quot;Look out<br/>
&gt;here we go again..&quot;  would be a useful &gt;comment when they do.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No its more useful to pick apart why they chose to call it a lesson, when in fact it was an actual lesson book she was learning from.  My comment was intended to do just exactly what it obviously did.  Now if we are done snipping, can we get back to the discussion?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151667781">Does anyone actually KNOW if this child asked for this lesson book or not? or is it just a typical practice to jump the second this word lesson is &#39;spoken&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously whatever I have to say on this issue is going to get feathers ruffled, I have accepted this, or I wouldn&#39;t still be here.  There is some fantastic information, for the most part. I am saddened however to see the degradation of topics, when a person comes up with a question about how to get a &#39;lesson&#39; across, I would be the first person to give examples of how we learn in our home without the need for lessons or workbooks, and also plenty of examples where my children choose to use them, ask for them when we are in a bookstore, and guess what folks .. I don&#39;t say to them &quot;ohhh heaven forbid NOOOOOOO we are unschoolers, its a horrible thing to learn from a workbook or lesson book....bite your tongue child&quot;  I happily purchase the book for them and let them mess around with it if they wish.<br/>
<br/>
No one has a clue if this was the situation or not, just alot of assumptions, and the usual high horse comments and criticisms.  That is what I was referring to.  <br/>
<br/>
And this is the last I have to say on the subject.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081461132">Perhaps she is taking the first steps to unschooling.  Perhaps with<br/>
encouragement they will come all the way over the bridge to unschooling.<br/>
Perhaps answering those kinds of questions with support, explanations and<br/>
encouragement instead of &quot;you aren&#39;t an unschooler, good-bye&quot; might bring<br/>
them a step closer.  Perhaps an explanation of deschooling for both parent<br/>
and child would have been more helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, just perhaps we could all just let the one liners go and not feel<br/>
like we have to start the whole defend a particular definition of<br/>
unschooling AGAIN.<br/>
<br/>
IF one reads the posts from Sharon from the beginning to the most current<br/>
(not necessary those that have appeared lately since Yahoo is off and<br/>
running arse backwards again!), you would see what I see, big steps from the<br/>
original posts which were very hser-ish to more and more seeing the benefits<br/>
of unschooling.<br/>

&gt; are just going to say &quot;hurray for you&quot; to anyone coming here?<br/>
&gt; I think we need to remember that this is an unschooing support and<br/>
&gt; discussion list. Otherwise let&#39;s just invite a bunch of ps&#39;ers,<br/>
&gt; teachers, whomever and say &quot;yay for everyone&quot;.<br/>
&gt; When something flies in the face of unschooling it needs to be<br/>
&gt; pointed out.<br/>
&gt; Not because anyone is saying that they shouldn&#39;t do things their way,<br/>
&gt; but some things aren&#39;t conducive to unschooling and thank GOODNESS<br/>
&gt; people were willing to point those things out to me!!!<br/>
&gt; If a person doesn&#39;t want to hear how their ideas do/do not help with<br/>
&gt; joyful unschooling they can ignore the advice given.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s detrimental to this list to act like anything we do as parents<br/>
&gt; or homeschoolers is just fine and have all of us stick our heads in<br/>
&gt; the sand and not respond with ideas and advice when something smacks<br/>
&gt; of school mentality.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154409819">Just in case anybody remembers, until about a week ago, I kept workbooks out <br/>
of reach of my children, believing they were too young to reach for them and <br/>
not &quot;destroy&quot; them.<br/>
<br/>
After a considerable amount of angst and self-reflection, I put them on the <br/>
accessible bookshelf.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (2) scribbles in them whenever she likes.  And I don&#39;t mind it <br/>
anymore!  <br/>
<br/>
My son (3) actually works in them in the manner in which he is &quot;supposed&quot; to. <br/>
 And I don&#39;t mind that either!<br/>
<br/>
I think I am experiencing an &quot;unschooling breakthrough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(I have also just stopped listening to what I think the children &quot;need&quot; to <br/>
participate in, and started listening to what the &quot;want&quot; to participate in.)<br/>

<br/>
Letting them mess around with it is not what was being discussed, it seemed.  <br/>
It was &quot;doing lessons.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;No one has a clue if this was the situation or not, just alot of <br/>
assumptions, and the usual high horse comments and criticisms. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Having read all of the posters writings here up to that point, I felt I had <br/>
more than just assumptions.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;High horse comments&quot; is an insult, and not productive.  Please discuss <br/>
unschooling and not other people.<br/>

Not everybody necessarily has the same goals.  I thought that was one of the<br/>
big reasons for unschooling.<br/>

You said  &lt;&lt;, unless the child actually wanted<br/>

Perhaps I should say...&quot;No Chaelene, you can not do workbooks, that would<br/>
look like formal education and that is a no no no, then we would not be<br/>

&gt; &#39;I don&#39;t expect that everybody here is doing the exact same things<br/>
&gt; with their<br/>
&gt; unschooling or anything else. So if you can&#39;t relate to what I am<br/>
&gt; saying or<br/>
&gt; asking,,,I can surely relate to that&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course we aren&#39;t doing the same things, but we are interested in<br/>
&gt; supporting and discussing what unschooling is and is not.<br/>
&gt; Lessons are not unschooling, unless the child actually wanted<br/>
&gt; it....but kids that are unschooled see the whole world as learning<br/>
&gt; and don&#39;t typically see lessons as the best way to get info. they<br/>
&gt; need.<br/>
&gt; As you journey along, you will see that they can actually impede the<br/>
&gt; learning process.<br/>
&gt; Now if lessons is how you do things, that is totally your<br/>
&gt; business...I won&#39;t disparage that. And trading lessons with another<br/>
&gt; family may be what you&#39;re looking for.<br/>
&gt; But in an unschooling context, this isn&#39;t necessary.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Alright then how about these comments as being useful...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Do you  mean &quot;here we go discussing &gt;unschooling again&quot;?<br/>
&gt; &gt;We&#39;ll do that as long as the list lasts!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I meant here we go again, instead of giving her answers to her actual<br/>
question, we get to hear once again the definitions of &#39;un-schooling&#39;<br/>
instead of offering actual suggestions about how to go about what she was<br/>
asking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I doubt you mean to suggest that doing &gt;lessons and discussing how to<br/>
trade<br/>
&gt; &gt;doing lessons with another family is a good &gt;topic for the unschooling<br/>
list,<br/>
&gt; &gt;or a topic on which someone will get &gt;teaching-oriented advice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would not suggest such a thing, nor would I suggest to anyone that<br/>
anything they ask about is not a good topic, because all questions are<br/>
valid, except those left unasked.  Life is learning, and we dont find out<br/>
the answers until we ask the questions, ofcourse my response directly to her<br/>
would have been a bit more constructive, such as explaining to her how we go<br/>
about learning math in my unschooling household, not criticizing her choice<br/>
to ask a question on this list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Perhaps she is quite happy with how she is doing this. Perhaps her<br/>
daughter<br/>
&gt; does enjoy it, and perhaps it doesnt matter one way or the other what she<br/>
&gt; calls it...&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I think it matters on an unschooling list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Her household doesnt live on this list, and frankly I dont choose my words<br/>
to &#39;fit&#39; anyone elses ideas or use words that others think are more<br/>
appropriate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If people say&lt;&lt; If you don&#39;t do lessons, then it does not apply<br/>
&gt;   to you.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &quot;If your kids go to school every day, then it doesn&#39;t apply to you&quot;<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &quot;If your kids are committed to doing ABeka, this it doesn&#39;t apply to you,&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;then I bet someone is going to say &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;something about unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ofcourse, and suggesting ways in which math is more naturally learned as<br/>
opposed to lessons is a wonderful response. Not exactly what was done tho<br/>
was it? I believe her statement was meant to say just that, if my question<br/>
doesnt apply to how YOU choose to unschool then no response is necessary.<br/>
Ofcourse there will always have to be these lil comments wont there?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;And I don&#39;t think &quot;Look out<br/>
&gt; &gt;here we go again..&quot;  would be a useful &gt;comment when they do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sandra<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No its more useful to pick apart why they chose to call it a lesson, when<br/>
in fact it was an actual lesson book she was learning from.  My comment was<br/>
intended to do just exactly what it obviously did.  Now if we are done<br/>
snipping, can we get back to the discussion?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254704502">What I said was that Chaelene enjoys doing workbooks sometimes because she<br/>
says they are like puzzles or games.  I have only gotten her the fun ones<br/>
with the stickers and different activities included.<br/>
<br/>
I use words like *lessons*,  *education* and things of that sort simply<br/>
because I have not  &quot;learned&quot; new words that fit more neatly into what I am<br/>
doing now.<br/>
<br/>
I have had enough posts come to me from people who are positive that the one<br/>
or two negatives are certainly not worth my concern.<br/>

&gt; Does anyone actually KNOW if this child asked for this lesson book or not?<br/>
or is it just a typical practice to jump the second this word lesson is<br/>
&#39;spoken&#39;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Obviously whatever I have to say on this issue is going to get feathers<br/>
ruffled, I have accepted this, or I wouldn&#39;t still be here.  There is some<br/>
fantastic information, for the most part. I am saddened however to see the<br/>
degradation of topics, when a person comes up with a question about how to<br/>
get a &#39;lesson&#39; across, I would be the first person to give examples of how<br/>
we learn in our home without the need for lessons or workbooks, and also<br/>
plenty of examples where my children choose to use them, ask for them when<br/>
we are in a bookstore, and guess what folks .. I don&#39;t say to them &quot;ohhh<br/>
heaven forbid NOOOOOOO we are unschoolers, its a horrible thing to learn<br/>
from a workbook or lesson book....bite your tongue child&quot;  I happily<br/>
purchase the book for them and let them mess around with it if they wish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No one has a clue if this was the situation or not, just alot of<br/>
assumptions, and the usual high horse comments and criticisms.  That is what<br/>
I was referring to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And this is the last I have to say on the subject.<br/>

Do whatever you choose in your home. That&#39;s not my business.<br/>
But when you bring information to an UNSCHOOLING support list I WILL <br/>
give input about unschooling.<br/>
If you don&#39;t want input on unschooling (no, not ps, not <br/>

<br/>
By your responses it seems you are concerned.<br/>
I don&#39;t understand why it is taken as negativity when someone <br/>
question why you would want to &quot;trade lessons&quot;. You cited specific <br/>
subject matters and asked if it was a good idea to trade with another <br/>
parent.<br/>
My advice was that this line of thought may be impeding a bubbly, <br/>
joyful unschooling method.<br/>
I did not tell you to do it my way...I was answering in support of <br/>
unschooling which is not exactly lesson oriented.<br/>
It&#39;s not just your wording of thoughts (which is all we have to go on <br/>
by the way) it was the idea itself being discussed.<br/>
Why do you take that as negativity?<br/>
I am not telling you how to do anything. If you are happy, your <br/>
children are happy....great!<br/>
But you came to an unschooling list and asked if you should trade <br/>
lessons with another parent.<br/>
I did not say &quot;put away the workbooks&quot;....they are a valid option for <br/>
anyone that is interested. Just as TV, games, books and the entire <br/>
world are options.<br/>
Why are my words getting so twisted?<br/>
What do you want from this list?<br/>
Did you want me to say &quot;YES, trade lessons in math for lessons in <br/>
history with another parent&quot;?<br/>
Because if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for, I can&#39;t help you.<br/>
If you&#39;re truly interested in hearing what has worked for other <br/>
families that have been unschooling, I&#39;m happy to help.<br/>
I am truly curious what kind of answer would have been deemed <br/>
appropriate.<br/>

&gt; Perhaps she is taking the first steps to unschooling.  Perhaps with<br/>
&gt; encouragement they will come all the way over the bridge to unschooling.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps answering those kinds of questions with support, explanations and<br/>
&gt; encouragement instead of &quot;you aren&#39;t an unschooler, good-bye&quot; might bring<br/>
&gt; them a step closer.  Perhaps an explanation of deschooling for both parent<br/>
&gt; and child would have been more helpful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps, just perhaps we could all just let the one liners go and not feel<br/>
&gt; like we have to start the whole defend a particular definition of<br/>
&gt; unschooling AGAIN.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; IF one reads the posts from Sharon from the beginning to the most current<br/>
&gt; (not necessary those that have appeared lately since Yahoo is off and<br/>
&gt; running arse backwards again!), you would see what I see, big steps from<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; original posts which were very hser-ish to more and more seeing the<br/>
benefits<br/>

&lt;&lt; Whatever!!  Does that change it or does it just make it easier for YOU to<br/>
deal with?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Until the parent/teacher/facilitator&#39;s understanding of the differences <br/>
develops, school is still there.  <br/>
<br/>
It makes it easier to see and understand and feel and trust the difference if <br/>
you change terminology to match philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
If in cases of &quot;I taught him...&quot; I change my thinking and speaking to &quot;He <br/>
learned...&quot; than the focus is on my child.  And very often he learned without <br/>
a bit of input from me.   He had input from someone, maybe, but the important <br/>
thing is &quot;He learned.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am not going to *avoid* those words just<br/>
because you have problems dealing with them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about anyone else here.  If I had never been born or if I was still <br/>
teaching public school and had never had children, the fact that words DO <br/>
have power and they DO shape thought would still be true.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   &lt;&lt;Some of us do help them do lessons, some children enjoy the<br/>
&gt;   workbooks and things of that sort.  Chaelene just finished one on telling<br/>
&gt;   time and enjoyed every page.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If she&#39;s having sufficient fun, why don&#39;t you consider it playing instead <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt;   &quot;doing lessons&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its a good question -- why do we call it &quot;lessons&quot; if the kid is having fun <br/>
doing a math workbook (my youngest does this - she sits up all NIGHT doing <br/>
math workbooks sometimes)? Then we call it &quot;playing&quot; when the kid is doing a <br/>
puzzle or playing a board game? They just aren&#39;t that different IF the kid is <br/>
having a good time. It is like distinguishing between doing vocabulary lesson <br/>
worksheets and a good crossword puzzle. If either one is fun and the kid <br/>
wants to do it and initiates it or jumps on the idea, then what&#39;s the <br/>
difference? Why call one a lesson and the other play?<br/>
<br/>
I think it is just because we often still think of things that look like <br/>
school as &quot;lessons&quot; and things that look like what most kids do after school, <br/>
on weekends, and during vacations as &quot;play.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
One of the major points of unschooling is not separating learning into <br/>
&quot;lessons&quot; versus &quot;play.&quot; <br/>

- it is going to come up over and over because that is what the list is <br/>
about.<br/>

side of beef that they should not remind me that eating beef is not <br/>
vegetarian? They should just help me find what I want?<br/>
