We are in Crofton.  DH has an appointment in Ellicott City which is <br/>
45 min. north west of here.  He can drop us off in Baltimore and I <br/>
think we can take a Marc Train into DC.  We are determined to be <br/>
there.<br/>

How old are your kids Pat?  2 girls right?<br/>
I have Carly 11, Sam 8, Jack 5 and Jamie almost3.<br/>
Our picture is in the photos section here. (I posted that in another <br/>

Allison is 12 and Virginia is 10.<br/>

I hope the hard frost we had recently has not spoiled the cherry <br/>
