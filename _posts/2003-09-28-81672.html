<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042076019">Good Morning,<br/>
We need advice, guidance...help! Trinity Repertory Company ( a nationally acclaimed professional theater) stages &quot; Christmas Carol&quot; every year. It is always done by a different director.<br/>
Brianna has &#39;studied&#39; theater for years w/ &quot;The All Children&#39;s Theater&quot; (ACT)  ACT is a very slow and easy &quot;let the kids have fun&quot; sort of place, in fact, one season there was an instructor that demanded rehearsals, etc and she was canned. Brianna has always taken theater very seriously.<br/>
She has been in various productions and done well in them.<br/>
This past summer she was in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; - she was the narrator and she was excellent!<br/>
<br/>
Last year she auditioned for Annie at Trinity Repertory Company. She made the first call back - but at the second they wanted her to dance (she hasn&#39;t had lessons and I&#39;ve been unable to afford them). She didn&#39;t make the cut. She was very sad...for awhile, but, I thought, okay.<br/>
This past week, she received an e-mail for auditions for &quot;Christmas Carol&quot; <br/>
Her audition is for 1:45 this afternoon.<br/>
She has to sing - she&#39;s okay w/ that - while she hasn&#39;t had lessons, she has a very pleasing voice and can sing rather well.<br/>
She has to tell a joke - she&#39;s okay with that.<br/>
<br/>
The Problem???<br/>
Last night she was so nervous about &quot;failing&quot; she was crying at almost midnight!<br/>
She says she wants to get called back. She was all cuddled with me crying &quot;What if they don&#39;t call me back?&quot;  &quot;What if I don&#39;t make it?&quot;<br/>
We talked about how her being in the role would be; we talked about what she would do, how she would feel - if she doesn&#39;t gat a call back. <br/>
I pointed out that many, many actors get &#39;no call backs&#39;<br/>
Also - this part would seriously impact our lives - she would be tied up during a great fun, very busy time of year....<br/>
and once she&#39;s in -if she does get a part  then she would have to stay in - or else lose any future chance of participating w/ Trinity Rep.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s sleeping right now.<br/>
I&#39;m rather torn....do I think she is a good actress?<br/>
yes.<br/>
Do I think she can sing well enough?<br/>
Yes<br/>
Do I think she&#39;ll make the first cut and get a call back? <br/>
Yes.<br/>
After that....I just don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
If she gets the part - I don&#39;t think she would want to miss all she would miss (fun stuff) and I think she would feel guilty over what we would have to do to arrange this - some of the performances are when we are supposed to be working - so I&#39;d have to arrange transportation, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Help.......<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452254910">If she wants to do it I would let her run with her hopes and dreams. I would <br/>
just make sure she knows the commitment (depending on her age she may already <br/>
know).  Sounds like a great opportunity and an interest of hers.<br/>
<br/>
A side example: I have a sister with a little girl who is now 11. She has a <br/>
voice that puts many professional singers to the bench. She has always wanted <br/>
to do try outs and auditions. She has made several tapes. The kid can sing <br/>
beautifully. The problem is my sister doesn&#39;t wont to be bothered with the <br/>
commitment but also knows she will be successful and wants her to wait a few years to <br/>
get her schooling down.  When I call often times her DH is on line looking up <br/>
audition dates and information but never tells her Mom she wants to go to one <br/>
often enough.<br/>
<br/>
This is an extreme situation as Unschoolers listen much more than PS parents <br/>
but sometimes they just dont show their dreams enough for the parents to see <br/>
how big.<br/>
<br/>
If she does make it you will have the joys of a child and maybe a tape to <br/>
remember for both of your lives. She will always remember the goods and the bad-s <br/>
of making it. Memories of Mom supporting her rather than saying no with fair <br/>
much better for years to come.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225770727">Hi,<br/>
Brianna & I had a talk today....she explained that she wanted to be on stage - BUT - she wasn&#39;t prepared to give up so many hours and so many days (and nights) for a small role in Christmas Carol.<br/>
She would have been tied up from Oct 29 - Dec 27.<br/>
She would have missed;<br/>
Tuesdays at Purgatory Chasm<br/>
Friday Ice Skating<br/>
The Winter Dance Social<br/>
The night-time hayride<br/>
her planned parity for my birthday would have had to be postponed<br/>
her birthday party would have had to be postponed<br/>
our hoped for trip to Florida (or somewhere we both want to go!!) would be postponed<br/>
<br/>
the list goes on......<br/>
<br/>
I think the idea here - dressing in Dickensian clothing and caroling would be good. I&#39;ll offer her the suggestion as soon as she returns from her friends home.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Janis<br/>

<br/>
I remember not getting a part because the actor was already cast before my <br/>
call back and I was too tall for him.  *shrug*  The director had to make the <br/>
call to grab the guy who was a better actor, for the bigger part, and &quot;settle&quot; <br/>
for the other actress.  ( hey and people wonder why actors have big egos!!  we <br/>
have to develop them to deal with rejection! I was obviously the better <br/>
actress!!!  lol )  <br/>

I hope that helps her feel better.  ((((BRIANNA))))<br/>

If you like traveling:<br/>

Galveston, Texas does &quot;Dickens on the Strand&quot; every year in early<br/>
December. Locals and visitors dress in Victorian clothing, or as<br/>
specific Dickens characters. There are &quot;Victorian&quot; crafts, roast<br/>
chestnuts from little carts, daily parades, and a costume contest with<br/>
various categories. Local kids dress as urchins and run around begging,<br/>
or trying to pick pockets - then get caught by the constable. One year<br/>
we had the Budweiser Clydesdales. People were lining up to see them.<br/>
Perhaps it was unfortunate that when we entered the stable, the horses<br/>
were all facing to the back of their stalls. There are various<br/>
performances both in the local theater, and on street stages, and<br/>
carolers. My mother and father used to portray the Pearly King and Queen<br/>
- cockney characters with their clothing decorated in buttons in the<br/>
parades.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-106202482">Hi Robyn,<br/>
Galveston&#39;s a bit far to go. She&#39;s actually okay now - she decided not to go to the audition based on what she would have to give up if she was given a part.<br/>
She looked at the situation and made a decision. I like  the way she did it. We talked about it...I tried very, very hard to not give her any signals or anything....<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s upset now because she witnessed a fight between the boy up the street and her friend, Crystal. Crystal can&#39;t/won&#39;t tell her mom, so she&#39;s coming over tomorrow to talk to me about it.<br/>
