family, that this statistic doesn&#39;t surprise me. None of them have ever<br/>
picked up a book and read it. They have no books or newspapers in their<br/>
houses. I sincerely doubt that most of them are able to read at a 4th or 5th<br/>
grade level (despite having passed those grades). DH himself, though a<br/>
brilliant man and successful businessman, is barely literate (not able to<br/>
write a coherent and grammatically correct sentence to save his life, cannot<br/>
spell even basic words) and never had read a book cover-to-cover before<br/>
meeting me. Of course, he managed to get passed from grade to grade and<br/>
graduate high school though.<br/>

Sadly, I would bet that the statistic of 60% of Americans being like this is<br/>
pretty accurate. These people I am talking about are not poverty-ridden in a<br/>
ghetto. They have access to fine schools, libraries, etc. They have<br/>
disposable income. They are average Americans. They just aren&#39;t literate (by<br/>
which I mean they can read by sounding out words, but they can&#39;t read for<br/>
meaning and comprehension, and cannot write at a level to be easily<br/>
understood).<br/>

probably not quite, true, I bet that *many* of my college students have<br/>
never read a book not assigned, after maybe 3rd or 4th grade when reading<br/>
books is lots of fun.  I live in a lower income apartment complex where<br/>
many of the people fall into the working poor or underclass, and I know<br/>
for a fact that they never read for pleasure.  They read the manuals that<br/>
will help them fix cars and motorcycles when they need to; they do<br/>
something with newspapers (I guess get them for tv listings) because I see<br/>
them on doorsteps, but I know after spending a lot of time socializing<br/>
with them that they don&#39;t read for pleasure.  In fact, the few times we&#39;ve<br/>
takend neighborhood kids to the library with us, it has always been the<br/>
first time they&#39;ve been to the public library.  The bookmobile used to<br/>
come here every other friday, but stopped because only my family used it,<br/>
and we go to the main library at least once (usually 3) times a week and<br/>
make at least monthly excursions to two other branches, and the bookmibile<br/>
guy knew that;)  No one else used it, ever.  But in general, at many<br/>
income levels, many people do not read for pleasure.  My brother doesn&#39;t.  <br/>
My sister doesn&#39;t.  Both are professionals and I bet neither read more<br/>
than a book a year, if that, and always for specific information.  My<br/>
mother only recently started reading for pleasure.  I don&#39;t ever remember<br/>
her sitting down and reading a book when I was a child.  I&#39;m the anomoly<br/>
in my family.  I read several books a week.  And when I started crawling<br/>
as a baby, I crawled right to a bookshelf.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to me to hear of families with no books. My mother is the <br/>
oldest of 9 children and everyone has books in their homes although they had <br/>
to scrape by growing up. My grandparents grew up during the Depression as <br/>
well, but they read newpapers, magazines, fiction and non-fiction. They <br/>
weren&#39;t available to them in the old days, but as the family has prospered <br/>
they have acquired them. My grandfather got his GED in his 60&#39;s, after his <br/>
retirement, because he had to drop out of school around the 6th grade in <br/>
order to help support the family. In his 70&#39;s he got a B.A. in religion.<br/>
They never had great access to libraries or even bookmobiles because they <br/>
live in a very rural area. However, knowledge has always been seen as the key <br/>
to financial power and books have been seen as the great equalizers, making <br/>
the knowledge available to the masses.<br/>

Candice...this was the same for my parents and grandparents. They were<br/>
farmers during the Depression. Reading was a luxury to do done after a full<br/>
day of chores. But they still did it. My dad says his mother was like a<br/>
walking dictionary...if they needed a word spelled they just asked her and<br/>
she&#39;d rattle it off. She was just an average farmer&#39;s wife with a turn of<br/>
the century public education...but how many people in this day of<br/>
spell-check could spell nearly any word in their head? Still my dad doesn&#39;t<br/>
read for pleasure. Not his cup of tea. He&#39;s mechanically inclined and would<br/>
rather read a car manual.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174098978">I really don&#39;t understand why some folks do and some don&#39;t because it has<br/>
nothing to do with income!  We live in an &quot;economically depressed&quot; area and<br/>
my great-grandfather homesteaded.  He saved and scrimped and would send to<br/>
SF to have books shipped in.  My grandfather was a logger and worked a tramp<br/>
steamer but always saved to bring books home to his kids.  I grew up in the<br/>
projects and my mother bought every door to door, pay $1 a week book set and<br/>
stories on records deal that came along.  We all had library cards as soon<br/>
as we could look at picture books.<br/>
<br/>
Even now, up here the library is filled with folks of all walks of life.<br/>
There are usually a dozen or so &quot;street&quot; people who are there and they are<br/>
reading, not just hanging out so they can be somewhere warm.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where they got their numbers, but it sure wasn&#39;t around here!<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t know where they got their numbers, but it sure wasn&#39;t around here! <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was some of my point too.  In my experience, such a figure could NOT be <br/>
true.  For one thing, they didn&#39;t say &quot;adults,&quot; they said &quot;Americans,&quot; and at <br/>
least in school kids have read books.  So I&#39;m guessing that figure meant <br/>
&quot;once they get out of school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And school has turned more kids OFF books than any one thing ever has, I&#39;m <br/>
sure, with their forced-march reading and their book reports and grades.<br/>
<br/>
But in any case, I hang around with all KINDS of people who read books,and <br/>
although I have been in some houses without books, I&#39;ve been in more with.<br/>
<br/>
And my main objection is the emotional intent of any statistic which is <br/>
intended to shame people but which has no possible basis for validity.  <br/>
<br/>
Would it be based on book sales?  Reports of social workers?  (They only deal <br/>
with a certain element of the population.)  Are carpet layers being called on <br/>
to surreptitiously count books and heads and report who&#39;s reading?  <br/>
<br/>
My mother-in-law has one single floor to ceiling bookshelf in her house.  She <br/>
has mostly her nursing school books from the 40&#39;s, encyclopedias, some old <br/>
reader&#39;s digest novel things, and lots of church stuff.  But she has ALWAYS <br/>
read the latest mysteries and Michener stuff because she checks books out <br/>
from the library, one at a time, has one on request, takes one back, checks <br/>
one out... How would that show on anyone&#39;s stats?  If libraries are the <br/>
source of the statistics, then I don&#39;t read enough to count.  I checked out <br/>
the autobiography of the Dalai Lama two years ago and kept it too long.  <br/>
<br/>
Had the statement been qualified or had a citation (according to x-source, <br/>
perhaps as many as 60% of Americans have never read a book) I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
squawked, but ANY statement such as &quot;60% of Americans have never read a book&quot; <br/>
needs more information.  Are they counting pre-readers and infants?  The <br/>
severely retarded?  Where did the numbers come from and why?    One bad piece <br/>
of information taints a whole article as much as stupid questions taint a <br/>
test.<br/>
<br/>

  Librarians Ignore the Value of Stories<br/>
<br/>
  By WAYNE A. WIEGAND<br/>
<br/>
   At the beginning of a course I teach to all first-semester<br/>
  students at the University of Wisconsin at Madison&#39;s School of<br/>
  Library and Information Studies, I run through a litany of<br/>
  statistics: There are more public libraries in the United<br/>
  States than McDonald&#39;s restaurants. Americans make 3.5 billion<br/>
  visits to school, public, and college or university libraries<br/>
  every year -- three times more than visits to the movies.<br/>
  Children and young adults go to school libraries 1.7 billion<br/>
  times during the school year -- two times more visits than to<br/>
  state and national parks.<br/>
<br/>
  When Americans go to the library, I tell my students, they are<br/>
  usually looking for stories to read. They want material that<br/>
  inspires them or affirms their identities, written in the<br/>
  narrative form that years of reading have made familiar --<br/>
  from the latest Danielle Steel novel or Harry Potter and the<br/>
  Goblet of Fire, to nonfiction like Mitch Albom&#39;s Tuesdays With<br/>
  Morrie, Frank McCourt&#39;s Angela&#39;s Ashes, or Tom Brokaw&#39;s The<br/>
  Greatest Generation. A 1998 survey by the American Library<br/>
  Association showed that two-thirds of Americans use a public<br/>
  library at least once per year, and of that number 80 percent<br/>
  (about 145 million people) go there to check out a book.<br/>
<br/>
  Fortunately, scholars in the humanities have been studying the<br/>
  subject of reading stories for the past 25 years, from a<br/>
  variety of perspectives -- including literacy studies,<br/>
  reader-response theory, ethnographies of reading, the social<br/>
  history of print, and cultural studies, which examines how<br/>
  people &quot;read&quot; nonprint material like the videos and compact<br/>
  disks that libraries also circulate by the millions. Those<br/>
  scholars analyze who reads what stories, and why, by focusing<br/>
  on the complex ways that readers from various cultures use<br/>
  what they read in their daily lives.<br/>
<br/>
  Statistics clearly demonstrate that many people rely on<br/>
  libraries for their stories, and generally, librarians know<br/>
  what gets checked out. Unfortunately, librarians have little<br/>
  knowledge of why people read what they do. As a result, they<br/>
  lack a deeper understanding of how libraries already serve<br/>
  readers, and they miss evidence that they could use to<br/>
  convince state legislatures and other sources of financial<br/>
  support that spending money on stories is important. They also<br/>
  are often unable to help patrons find just the right story to<br/>
  read, nor do they develop enough programs -- book clubs, for<br/>
  example -- to connect readers to one another.<br/>
<br/>
  Part of the blame for that tremendous professional oversight<br/>
  belongs to library and information-science programs, which<br/>
  have generally ignored the literature on reading and -- except<br/>
  for children&#39;s literature -- traditionally undervalued the<br/>
  reading of stories.<br/>
<br/>
  As a historian, I think I understand how that oversight<br/>
  evolved. Michel Foucault argued that centuries ago, the new<br/>
  order that we now call modernity separated people&#39;s experience<br/>
  of daily life into work and leisure. Over time, we came to<br/>
  think of information that answers questions related to work,<br/>
  or helps people become informed citizens or intelligent<br/>
  consumers, as especially important; we labeled it &quot;useful<br/>
  knowledge.&quot; In a library, people usually get that kind of<br/>
  information at the reference desk, with the help of a<br/>
  librarian. We consider reading stories, however, an activity<br/>
  of leisure, and we underestimate the value of the information<br/>
  that stories contain.<br/>
<br/>
  Evidence of that bifurcated thinking abounds in U.S. library<br/>
  history. For example, the Public Library Inquiry of 1949,<br/>
  supported by the Carnegie Corporation, concluded that public<br/>
  libraries ought to minimize their practice of supplying the<br/>
  popular reading that nearly three-quarters of their users<br/>
  desired, and concentrate instead on a smaller but more<br/>
  influential combination of &quot;serious&quot; readers, community<br/>
  leaders, and students of adult education who used public<br/>
  libraries to obtain useful knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
  That same kind of thinking is evident in library schools.<br/>
  Today, most educators in library and information-science<br/>
  programs are convinced that their profession&#39;s chief<br/>
  responsibility is to give patrons access to useful knowledge.<br/>
  Further, because the curricula are increasingly driven by the<br/>
  technologies that do such a good job of manipulating that kind<br/>
  of information, many professors seem to feel that if a<br/>
  computer isn&#39;t involved somehow, the material in question<br/>
  can&#39;t be information.<br/>
<br/>
  In library schools, basic texts that students must read for<br/>
  core courses include little or no coverage of the recent<br/>
  literature on reading. Doctoral students typically investigate<br/>
  topics connected to new technologies. Advertisements for new<br/>
  professors almost always emphasize teaching skills and<br/>
  research expertise in information technologies; they almost<br/>
  never mention the need to develop an understanding of the<br/>
  information that millions of Americans find in the stories<br/>
  they get from their libraries. Some library schools have<br/>
  eliminated story-centered teaching positions and courses --<br/>
  like children&#39;s librarianship.<br/>
<br/>
  Even critics of current thinking can&#39;t seem to venture outside<br/>
  the box. For example, The Chronicle published nine letters to<br/>
  the editor in its May 12 issue that sought to debunk or<br/>
  clarify an April 7 article titled &quot;In Revamped Library<br/>
  Schools, Information Trumps Books.&quot; None of the letters cited<br/>
  the library&#39;s primary role as a reading institution. Instead,<br/>
  what united the correspondents was their belief that libraries<br/>
  are more than just books.<br/>
<br/>
  The narrow vision of library professionals was made<br/>
  particularly obvious in 1996, when the Benton Foundation<br/>
  issued preliminary findings of a study on what the public<br/>
  thought of leading librarians&#39; visions of the future for<br/>
  libraries. The investigators reported what they had found to<br/>
  representatives of the 18 institutions that had commissioned<br/>
  the study, which included four library schools.<br/>
<br/>
  Among the findings was that a focus group of suburban<br/>
  public-library users had collectively identified as their top<br/>
  two public-library services &quot;providing reading hours and other<br/>
  programs for children&quot; and buying enough popular titles so<br/>
  that patrons could, as one member of the focus group put it,<br/>
  &quot;get the book that everybody is reading right now.&quot; The<br/>
  investigators concluded that the public did not &quot;understand<br/>
  what goes on in the library other than taking out books.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  As far as I can tell, neither the investigators nor the people<br/>
  they reported to connected the study&#39;s findings to the<br/>
  literature on reading. Referring to the work of scholars like<br/>
  Janice A. Radway on romance novels, George N. Dove on<br/>
  detective stories, Henry Jenkins on science fiction, or<br/>
  Matthew Pustz on comic books might have made it clear that<br/>
  members of the public understand that taking out books is the<br/>
  most important activity that happens in the library. Instead,<br/>
  the library leaders planned to change the public&#39;s perception<br/>
  of libraries.<br/>
<br/>
  I hope that no one reading this essay concludes that I am<br/>
  against technology. Not at all. Professional librarians -- and<br/>
  the programs that educate them -- certainly have to tap the<br/>
  potential of information technologies in serving their<br/>
  patrons. But the contrast between the statistics on what<br/>
  Americans do in libraries and the near-total absence of<br/>
  attention to reading in library schools across the country<br/>
  shows that we aren&#39;t teaching future librarians nearly enough<br/>
  about the activity that is most central to librarianship.<br/>
  Rather than restricting the definition of information to what<br/>
  technology can provide, we should greatly expand the focus of<br/>
  library schools.<br/>
<br/>
  In the next year, nearly 5,000 new graduates of programs<br/>
  accredited by the American Library Association will get jobs<br/>
  at public, school, and academic libraries whose patrons use<br/>
  them chiefly to get reading material. The vast majority of the<br/>
  new librarians will eventually learn who reads what stories,<br/>
  but they won&#39;t understand why, in spite of the abundant<br/>
  literature that addresses that question. Worse yet, they will<br/>
  have been schooled to think that understanding why millions of<br/>
  their patrons read stories is none of their professional<br/>
  business. What a shame.<br/>

<br/>
I agree that this is an important question to ask.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who reads no magazines ever, of any sort.  But he watches the <br/>
news like a soap opera.  If I read Newsweek and Time, he will still know more <br/>
of what&#39;s going on than I do, and his information will be more current.<br/>
<br/>
Is the medium more important than the message?<br/>
<br/>
Someone who asks intelligent questions and really listens to the answers can <br/>
learn more than someone who skims eyes across lines of print for years <br/>
without actually applying that information or assimilating the ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I think the over-rating of reading in and of itself, the glorification of <br/>
reading, is a school-connected thing in this day and age.  Certainly 400 <br/>
years ago it was *THE* way to learn, and even now in English universities <br/>
students are said to be &quot;reading in history&quot; (not studying or majoring).  I <br/>
won&#39;t argue the history of the glory, but the current emphasis on reading <br/>
over and above other methods of receiving information is hanging on the thin <br/>
and stretching line.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re reading this right now, has it occurred to you that most people in <br/>
your life would consider it and you more valuable if you were reading the <br/>
same words in a bound, paper book than in pixels-on-light on a computer?<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a problem with the whole deal.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   By WAYNE A. WIEGAND<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is an interesting article, but he doesn&#39;t really get much into <br/>
what the value of stories actually is.  I&#39;m curious.  My dh and I have <br/>
hashed this out a few times.  He is constantly reading but reads <br/>
only non-fiction that he carefully selects as worth his precious little <br/>
time.  He sets goals for himself on what he&#39;s going to learn.  I <br/>
respect this, but I am a more eclectic reader.  I read plenty of non-<br/>
fiction, but I do love a good story.  Dh has a hard time disguising his <br/>
disappointment that I would choose to waste my time this way (to <br/>
his credit, he does try).<br/>
<br/>
A few of the arguments I&#39;ve given him are that fiction inspires me, <br/>
that it opens up my eyes to new worlds, new perspectives, new <br/>
ideas, that it relaxes me and gives me a little vacation from my <br/>
every day world.  His answer is that he gets some of the same <br/>
results from non-fiction while learning much more and can get the <br/>
rest of the results in far less time by watching the occasional movie.<br/>
<br/>
This argument a big deal because we each do what we want to do, <br/>
but I am bringing this up because I do see his point to some extent.  <br/>
I am wondering what some of your answers would be to the <br/>
question &quot;what are the value of stories?&quot;<br/>

been accepted into one of the Oxbridge colleges because he was so<br/>
intelligent.  He was also functionally illiterate because of severe<br/>
dyslexia.  I know of many children up to the age of 12 who do not read but<br/>
because their parents read to them or they listen to tapes they would be<br/>
considered to be &quot;well-read&quot; .  Literacy is a convenience for those who hand<br/>
out written instructions to classes but it is not a sign of intelligence.<br/>
It also brings up the point of what constitutes an education? If an<br/>
education is meant to prepare one for life in the society in which one<br/>
lives, reading can be pretty far down on the list of objectives.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; only non-fiction that he carefully selects as worth his precious little<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I immediatly related to this statement but for a completly different reason.<br/>
I find that I get so little time for reading these days that I keep going<br/>
back and reading the same stories over and over.  I don&#39;t want to waste my<br/>
time on something I may not like. :-)<br/>
I have recenlty started a reading group for older home-ed kids (10s and up)<br/>
around here. There are only two who come (and one of them is my daughter)<br/>
but even in the few weeks we have been discussing books I have been amazed.<br/>
Because it is a small group, because there is no agenda, ie questions to<br/>
think about, the discussions are really cool.  We begin to discuss a theme<br/>
or situation in the book and they are making connections with tv shows, or<br/>
things that have happened to them or other books. For example when we read A<br/>
Wizard of Earthsea they compared Ged and the shadow to an episode of Deep<br/>
space Nine where different aspects of a character were embodied in the other<br/>
characters.  They compared Ogion the old wizard to Obi Wan in Star WArs.<br/>
They compared one character who was a bit of a bully with a child that we<br/>
all know and tried to figure out why he acts the way he acts. So when you<br/>
say<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would say you are spot on.<br/>
<br/>
But there are also different ways of reading stories.  Entertainment is a<br/>
biggy and there is no problem with that. But we can also read and then use<br/>
other parts of our brain to figure things out. We have to make connections<br/>
and sense ourselves when we read fiction.  sometimes when we read<br/>
non-fiction, it is all spelled out for us and there is no creative thinking<br/>
needed. But then there  is non-fiction that again encourages us to figure<br/>
things out and make connections so that our understandin goes deeper.<br/>
Perhaps it is not the difference between the type of reading material that<br/>
is so imprtant but out different intentions in what we get from the<br/>
material. It sounds like you and your husband generally have similar goals.<br/>
<br/>
His answer is that he gets some of the same<br/>

identifyable value?&quot; If we decide on a value, does that mean people who read<br/>
for different reasons are wrong?  Of course not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree! Deirdre, you could also point out to your husband that many great<br/>
scholarly and religious traditions have been passed down through the ages<br/>
via stories, not to mention genealogies, epic poems of many cultures, and<br/>
oral history. Someone posted the other day about the value of reading and<br/>
the Bushmen of the Kalahari. I accidentally lost that post before I could<br/>
respond, but she was absolutely right! The history of the written and<br/>
printed word is relatively brief - and the history of large numbers of<br/>
people having access to written matter (either physical access to it, or<br/>
even possessing the ability to read) is even shorter and more geographically<br/>
confined. The days of the Renaissance man are rapidly passing us by. The<br/>
much-hyped &quot;information age&quot; is here, and none of us can hope to know it<br/>
all. I think the real risk these days is in suffering from an information<br/>
overload without having enough time for contemplation of what we know. I&#39;d<br/>
tell your husband that it&#39;s not the number of facts you know that matters,<br/>
it&#39;s how you understand them. And if stories are the way to greater<br/>
understanding for you, then that is fine.<br/>
<br/>
What I meant to reply to the Bushmen post was that I started reading &quot;In<br/>
Their Own Way&quot; by Thomas Armstrong and he had some very interesting things<br/>
to say about multiple intelligences. There is clearly an intersection<br/>
between innate learning preferences and abilities, culture, and the child&#39;s<br/>
individual environment. Parents all over the world prepare their children to<br/>
be successful (as in well-adapted) members of their own cultures. I think<br/>
you can help a child develop the coping skills they&#39;ll need in a particular<br/>
environment without destroying their individuality. Literacy may not say<br/>
anything about a person&#39;s intelligence, but there is no question that it is<br/>
an important skill to have if you are living in a modern, industrialized<br/>
society.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144384601">My 8yod is just beginning to read.  However, her comprehension skills are <br/>
wonderful.  We listened to an audiotape of &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot; <br/>
recently.  Yesterday, she saw someone take out the videotape at the library <br/>
and began to tell her about the story.  I had to stop her before she gave <br/>
the whole story away.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I love to read for pleasure and for information. But<br/>
&gt; &gt; does being able to read or reading a sign of<br/>
&gt; &gt; intelligence? I don&#39;t think so. I think the Kalahari<br/>
&gt; &gt; bushmen would disagree.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Peace,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Good point Samantha!  There was a case last year of a 15 year old who had<br/>
&gt;been accepted into one of the Oxbridge colleges because he was so<br/>
&gt;intelligent.  He was also functionally illiterate because of severe<br/>
&gt;dyslexia.  I know of many children up to the age of 12 who do not read but<br/>
&gt;because their parents read to them or they listen to tapes they would be<br/>
&gt;considered to be &quot;well-read&quot; .  Literacy is a convenience for those who <br/>
&gt;hand<br/>
&gt;out written instructions to classes but it is not a sign of intelligence.<br/>
&gt;It also brings up the point of what constitutes an education? If an<br/>
&gt;education is meant to prepare one for life in the society in which one<br/>
&gt;lives, reading can be pretty far down on the list of objectives.<br/>
&gt;Peace<br/>
