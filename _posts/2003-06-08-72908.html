&gt; I originally thought the boy was waving the stick *at* the two year <br/>
&gt; olds and wouldn&#39;t respond to verbal input, hence my position that I <br/>
&gt; would take it.<br/>
&gt; If he was just playing with it in a dangerous way, and was open to <br/>
&gt; the suggestion to move the play elsewhere, then I think taking the <br/>
&gt; stick away would be totally unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, same here.<br/>
I thought safety was the issue and the boy was not being reasonable about <br/>
moving it elsewhere.  Sounds like he&#39;s a very active boy that inadvertantly <br/>
annoys people....he doesn&#39;t have a chance! Poor guy.<br/>

&gt; until you eat all your food.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My Dad saw Jared loading up a dish of ice cream while dinner was cooking, on <br/>
one of his visits down here.  He said &quot;Jared, your Mom won&#39;t want you to have <br/>
that right before dinner.&quot; Jared said that Mom didn&#39;t mind. My Dads instant <br/>
response was &quot;Jared, you&#39;re fibbing me&quot; to which I replied (from the other room) <br/>
&quot;He&#39;s FINE Dad&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
And My Dad is an incredibly cool parent in SO many ways. He does not believe <br/>
in spanking or shaming, but he still has some old fashioned responses to food <br/>
issues.<br/>
I explained my position on the food thing, he seemed amused. But I think it <br/>
helped open another door when he saw Jared eat dinner with the rest of us!<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;&gt;In fact, our kids have been taught (yes, taught) to say &quot;Thank you <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;for the food. May I please be excused?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids have too. Without anyone making them.<br/>
They hear my dh thanking me for a meal all the time. He truly appreciates <br/>
someone cooking for him since he doesn&#39;t like to. And my kids truly appreciate <br/>
it.<br/>
It&#39;s all about trust. <br/>
I totally trust that they will pick up on gratefulness if we are acting <br/>
grateful.<br/>
I totally trust that they WANT to fit into this world, and with a gentle <br/>
reminder they will figure out different manners. <br/>
I don&#39;t have to &quot;teach&quot; coercively with manners any more than I have to with <br/>
math or any other real life learning.<br/>
