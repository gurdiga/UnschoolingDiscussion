&lt;&lt; There&#39;s a political connnection with this person, militarily speaking, so I<br/>
can&#39;t really do that without my husband hearing about it, and then there&#39;d<br/>
be trouble.  Not from him to me, he&#39;d agree!  But between the guys.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I understand.  Forgot about that.<br/>
<br/>
I told off a neighbor yesterday .  Very gently gave him a piece of advice, <br/>
actually, and he started yelling at me!  Imagine. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had walked out into the vacant lot behind our house where he had just <br/>
yelled horribly at a boy about ten years old and told him he was a dumb ass, and to <br/>
get the hell away from him.  It had to do with the boy not following the <br/>
dad&#39;s bad directions which, the dad imagined, would have gotten a kite in the air <br/>
on a windless day.<br/>
<br/>
The tone of voice was really horrible.  There was another, younger boy, still <br/>
holding the kite and looking none too hopeful but still following his dad&#39;s <br/>
worthless directives.  I walked over to the dad and said something (SOFTLY) li<br/>
ke &quot;If you call your kid dumbass, he&#39;s going to be really unhappy and it won&#39;t <br/>
make him a good kid.&quot;  Kind of awkward, but there it was.  He said it was none <br/>
of my business.  I said it wouldn&#39;t have been, if I couldn&#39;t hear it all from <br/>
my yard, and he should be nicer to his kids.  I was standing close enough for <br/>
him to hit me, and he was thinking about it, but he had the kite string in <br/>
his hands.  <br/>
<br/>
His wife was there, looking like a total blank, poor woman, and the kid with <br/>
the kite was too far away to hear, but he and probably six neighboring houses <br/>
could have heard the dad yelling at me.  I didn&#39;t take off just yet.  I told <br/>
him if he didn&#39;t like what I was saying, imagine how his KID must feel being <br/>
called a dumbass.<br/>
<br/>
Then I figured I could do as much as I could do and when he yelled after me <br/>
&quot;Mind your own fucking business,&quot; I said &quot;Then keep it out of my yard. I don&#39;t <br/>
want to hear it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly had been going through my old clothes and wearing things I had when I <br/>
was in my teens and 20&#39;s.  I was a scrawny kid and pretty small until I started <br/>
having kids.  After kids, I didn&#39;t small-up again.  So he called me a name I <br/>
had never been called.  It didn&#39;t really hurt my feelings, it just made me <br/>
realize why his kids are so horrible to my kids and every other kid who passes <br/>
their house.<br/>
<br/>
He yelled, after I was twenty yards away, &quot;FAT ASS!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t sure I heard him right.  I hadn&#39;t heard an insult like that since <br/>
elementary school, and it had never been directed at me.  I got to the gate of <br/>
my back yard and he yelled the same thing again louder.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t stop smiling.  What a doofus!  <br/>
<br/>
And I realize that it&#39;s probably that he himself was abused probably MUCH <br/>
worse than the verbal stuff his kids are doing, and he&#39;s probably feeling really <br/>
responsible and a good parent because he&#39;s stayed with his wife, he got them a <br/>
house in a decent (not fancy) neighborhood, and it even has a swimming pool <br/>
(where the kids are yelled at ALL the time), and he&#39;s still at home taking care <br/>
of his kids and not run off or in prison.  (Just guessing, again, at his <br/>
possible mindset.)<br/>
<br/>
And when he was yelling I was thinking a horrible level of thought, a <br/>
probably instinctive thing beyond conscious sensible thinking.    I was thinking  <br/>
&quot;Keith could take him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Still amused, but starting to feel sorry for the guy, I went up to the front <br/>
of the house and saw that Keith had returned from his five days in Colorado.  <br/>
I told him he had just missed my altercation with the neighbor.  I&#39;m sure <br/>
Keith was glad to hear that.  :-/<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;You could take him in a heartbeat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure Keith wasn&#39;t so glad to hear I had even imagined the possibility of <br/>
such necessity or opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
So the worst is they&#39;ll throw crap into our yard or be even meaner to the <br/>
kids, I guess.<br/>
The best might be that the dad will be quieter and the kids will realize that <br/>
someone does think their dad&#39;s too mean besides them.<br/>
<br/>
He WAS out trying to fly a kite, and maybe he&#39;s just not smart enough to know <br/>
you do truly need wind.  Maybe he wanted to watch TV but had promised the <br/>
kids and was keeping his promise.  It had been REALLY windy the day before and <br/>
maybe that&#39;s what inspired the kid to get a kite out. Maybe he was hoping wind <br/>
would come.  But his fury was so huge and so aimed straight at his child&#39;s head <br/>
that I couldn&#39;t just watch that boy walk sadly home under the umbrella of <br/>
that insult.  <br/>
<br/>
And I realized his dad was just of limited thought and vocabulary when the <br/>
best he could think of to say to me was &quot;fatass,&quot; and no wonder his children are <br/>
so hurtful and mean to other kids.  I guess they&#39;ll be nicer, even, to their <br/>
own children, maybe.  But how many generations will it be before someone is <br/>
smart enough or brave enough to change that pattern?<br/>

&lt;&lt; I told off a neighbor yesterday .  Very gently gave him a piece of<br/>
advice,<br/>
 actually, and he started yelling at me!  Imagine. &lt;g&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m impressed often. But I was inmpressed twice while reading<br/>
your story.<br/>
First, that you opened your mouth and said something about how the father<br/>
spoke to the child. I have heard similar things and haven&#39;t had the guts to<br/>
say something to that person. I&#39;m not sure if you know him or not. If it&#39;s<br/>
someone I know, I will say something. But just a neighbor or someone out in<br/>
public, I just can&#39;t seem to find the words.<br/>
<br/>
Then I was impressed again when you kept your mouth shut. I think that<br/>
impressed me more than the first one. I couldn&#39;t have just walked away like<br/>
that. Okay, I guess I could have, I would have chosen not to. &lt;BG&gt; And I<br/>
would have had a really hard time keeping Joe out of it. So good for you<br/>
both.<br/>
<br/>
I need to manage my mouth better. I&#39;m going to remember this story.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t even know his name.  He came to my door a couple of weeks ago with a <br/>
found puppy they&#39;d been keeping for nearly a week.  Someone had told him it <br/>
might belong behind him, and we were home so he checked with us first. I thought <br/>
it belonged to Jerry  next door, but I wasn&#39;t sure, so I took it in and asked <br/>
him if it was NOT our neighbor&#39;s did they maybe want to take it back and keep <br/>
it and he said yes.  I introduced myself and I even gave him a business card <br/>
so he would have my phone number in case that puppy got out again or anything. <br/>
 He didn&#39;t even think to tell me his name at the time, though it was a <br/>
pleasant exchange and he had three kids with him that day.<br/>
<br/>
It was my neighbor&#39;s puppy.   My kids confirmed it.  A tiny pit bull puppy.  <br/>
It spent several hours having a great time at our house before we had to <br/>
return it to its depressing back yard.  It will get grown and be a grown pit bull <br/>
in a depressing back yard it can obviously escape from.  I&#39;m no longer keen on <br/>
returning it if it gets out now.  <br/>

<br/>
Well I did shouting back at him to keep it in his own yard or it WAS my <br/>
business, so it wasn&#39;t quite a model of personal composure.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And the more I think about it the more I think he probably DOES think he&#39;s <br/>
being a good dad not to whip them with a belt (or whatever his upbringing was).  <br/>
And maybe he&#39;s just from a long line of mean.<br/>
