<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248273280">I had a terrible dream when I was pregnant with my secon daughter that I <br/>
woke up and found her head floating in my fish tank.  Hillary was stillborn <br/>
a few weeks later.  It&#39;s been 11 years and I haven&#39;t been able to stand the <br/>
sight of fish since.  My kids have been begging me for fish for years and I <br/>
finally gave in.  We somehow acquired another cat, two guinea pigs, 3 <br/>
goldfish and two snails in a matter of 3 days time.  (My willpower is <br/>
failing, huh? lol)<br/>
<br/>
Just my luck, one of the dang fish croaked today.  I can&#39;t win!<br/>
<br/>
I had other rather fascinating dreams during my pregnancies.  Not many of <br/>
which were bad.  I did dream once that I was in Vegas and gambling while in <br/>
labor and seven babies popped out of the machine when I hit the triple 7 <br/>
jackpot.  I was pregnant at the time and we were actually in Vegas on our <br/>
honeymoon.  Fortunately, several months later I had only one little girl. :)<br/>
<br/>
Never did hit that jackpot. :(<br/>
