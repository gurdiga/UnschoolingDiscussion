&gt; be quiet and let other kids try since they knew I already understood the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can really relate to this.... I spent so much time at the headmaster&#39;s <br/>
office for &quot;talking too much&quot;  I spent so much time in comprehensive school <br/>
(high school to Americans) writing lines (&quot;I will not disrupt the class by <br/>
talking so much)&quot;, so many hours sitting outside the classroom for &quot;talking <br/>
too much&quot;, many report cards that said &quot;Dawn talks too much and dispruts <br/>
other people: (even though I got A&#39;s and B&#39;s and refused to do homework) ... <br/>
my recollection of school is that you have to shut up and do as you are told. <br/>
 So why with all my talking didn&#39;t they encourage me to take a job where I <br/>
talk a lot?????  Surely all the teachers couldn&#39;t have been blind to see <br/>
where my talents lay?  I guess so because when I talked about becomming an <br/>
actress, journalist or working on the radio they laughed and said I ought to <br/>
become a nurse......  Many years later I became an actress, a writer and I <br/>
work on radio across America.... Seems I found my natural way and talents <br/>
without the help of school.  I often wonder how much sooner I would have <br/>
found it had I not been instituionalized and told to become something I had <br/>
no interest in...... (I didn&#39;t become a Nurse... but spend many years <br/>
floundering around until I discovered my passion in life)<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

<br/>
Stories of what hurt children in school are truly, truly sad.  As a student I <br/>
was getting the gold stars other kids would loved to have had, and soon I no <br/>
longer cared about them, and they got me not one speck of joy, but if some of <br/>
the other kids had gotten them their mother would have made them a special <br/>
dinner and they would have gone to sleep smiling.  And as a teacher I <br/>
inevitably contributed to those kinds of failure moments.  Usually I tried to <br/>
do what I knew was right, but people get tired and grouchy, and there are <br/>
grades required by the state, and some people sleep through and get A&#39;s and <br/>
some try hard and get C&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I put up an apology to my students.  I have no idea if any of them will ever <br/>
find it.<br/>

It&#39;s the apology to my students.  I had six years worth of more or less <br/>
(mostly more!) 138 or so kids a year, with about 100 repeats after I switched <br/>
from 7th to 9th, so guess I had... (here comes real-life algebra) over 900 <br/>
students.  Sometimes some of them were having a really good time.  Often I <br/>
was having a really good time.  But there are dark pockets of bad temper, <br/>
unhappy kids, meanness between kids that I wasn&#39;t clever enough to divert <br/>
(some I tried)...<br/>
