<br/>
&quot;Listen, strange women lyin&#39; in ponds distributin&#39; swords is no basis for<br/>
a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate<br/>
from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh, but you can&#39;t expect to wield supreme executive power just because<br/>
some watery tart threw a sword at you. &quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908499701">Deb, I just joined this group and the first message I read -- yours --<br/>
 made me laugh out loud. I haven&#39;t seen that Python flick in years. <br/>
My favorite scene was the parade of chanting monks appearing over a <br/>
hill, smacking themselves in the foreheads with stone tablets. I <br/>
think that&#39;s an interesting statement about organized religion. <br/>
Thanks! - Gordon<br/>

 </span></blockquote>ROFLOL - just as I opened this email, the very scene you indicate here is playing on our <br/>
TV! Is that too ironic? I didn&#39;t even know the movie was being referenced here when I <br/>
checked it out the other night. Serendipity!<br/>
<br/>
My favorite scene is the reading of the Book of Armaments!<br/>

That&#39;s my favorite. Delicious irony. :)<br/>
<br/>
The first time I saw this movie was for my thirteenth birthday. It was new and in the <br/>
theaters and a gaggle of my friends and I went to the movie and then back to my house <br/>
for cake and ice cream. We were positively sauced on laughter and couldn&#39;t stop the punch <br/>
drunk poking and teasing. One of the best birthday parties of my life. :)<br/>
<br/>
So much fun to watch with the kids today. And after reading Chaucer and Middle Ages <br/>
books together, we laugh even harder.<br/>
<br/>
And talk bout stimulating conversations! All those political gags lead to many a fruitful <br/>
conversation about the conditions of the worker, don&#39;t you know! ? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

My mom told me when I was a kid that there was never much difference  between <br/>
presidential candidates, so vote for the better looking one because  you&#39;d <br/>
have to look at him every day.  HA!  I know how to turn off the  TV and not get <br/>
the newspaper.  I don&#39;t get Newsweek anymore, I get  People.  I can look at <br/>
Brad Pitt and not George the Younger.<br/>
