 </span></blockquote>We were at a family reunion today (my side of the family) and I spoke to my <br/>
cousin who is a lawyer. This is what he had to say about the situation. We <br/>
could get a restraining order against mommie dearest, we could compel her to <br/>
tell us who she took the kids to see, and we could possibly sue her for all <br/>
sorts of things including, but not limited to; misrepresentation, slander, <br/>
maleficence, psychological damage, and so on. The problem is that it costs <br/>
money, and its not like she has bundles. My cousin and I decided that it <br/>
isn&#39;t worth it to put a restraining order against her, it would just cause <br/>
strife amongst family that we do get along with, and it could, possibly, make <br/>
things between Darin and I difficult. We aren&#39;t going to sue her, because of <br/>
the a fore mentioned too much time and effort for too little result. My <br/>
cousin IS going to help me take her to court to compel her to tell us who she <br/>
took the children to see, and he says that she will probably tell us before <br/>
we ever get to court. And we are going to put a __ (I can&#39;t remember what it <br/>
is called?) order out to keep any test results from her, regardless if they <br/>
are good or bad. As for the psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist, LMSW or <br/>
whom ever she took the kids to, we are going to wait and see who it was, what <br/>
she told him, and exactly what tests were given. <br/>
Honestly, if she outright lied to him, and said something like she is their <br/>
legal guardian or something, then I can forgive and forget. To me it will be <br/>
enough to know that HE knows he was duped. IF, that is the case. <br/>
Anyway, my cousin and I are meeting at his office Tuesday and we are going to <br/>
try and straighten this all out with a phone call first. So thanks to you all <br/>
for your advice, and your rage too! &lt;g&gt; It really helped!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342677868">Maybe because my dh works with attorneys...but I think the idea of a good<br/>
letter from an attorney is often enough to convey a few messages....one<br/>
being that you have counsel and are not afraid to use it.  This letter would<br/>
best be directed to the &#39;tester&#39;  who is likely some professional who will<br/>
get the message about the potential (legal) liability.    Of course,  you<br/>
still have the detective work of discovering who did the testing.<br/>
I wish you well in this!<br/>

I think this is a GREAT move Nancy!! I totally agree with you on not sueing, <br/>
that is above and beyond what would benefit everyone. But pursuing this <br/>
avenue is a great way to deal with a difficult situation (in my humble <br/>
opinion :)....<br/>
The MIL will know you aren&#39;t going to lay down and let her walk all over you, <br/>
your views and do whatever the H*** she wants to your kids behind your back.  <br/>
I certainly don&#39;t think she has any right to the test results either.<br/>
Good for you for pursuing this in such a balanced way.<br/>

This sounds great!<br/>
<br/>
As much as I like to vilify lawyers, isn&#39;t it great to have one in <br/>
the family? Makes a world of a difference. It&#39;s like having an envoy <br/>
from the Dark Side; but one you can trust :-)<br/>

involved.  Does she know that the lawyer is a cousin?  Even better if she <br/>

an interest in my family at all. Never comes to anything I have invited her <br/>
to, never asks how anyone is doing... Oh well her loss. <br/>
