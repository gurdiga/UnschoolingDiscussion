means is used for the death penalty, that the death certificate reads [cause <br/>
of death] [Homicide]. Are they absolved? I guess that depends on their <br/>
personal ideals, views, morals... State sanctioned homicide? Yes. Legal? Yes. <br/>
Is homicide legal? No. Good debate for (or against?) the death penalty <br/>
~Nancy who really doesn&#39;t want to debate the death penality. :o)<br/>
