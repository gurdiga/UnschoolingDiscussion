<br/>
I sure do know Frances and Peter - they live about half an hour away, and I<br/>
see and talk to them quite often! They are neat people. I also live next<br/>
door to Peter&#39;s sister! Wow - how about that!<br/>

Tell her I said Hi!  Our daughters are key-pals (more like the Moms are :o)<br/>
 and we write back and forth often.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to meet you!<br/>

&lt;&lt; &quot;It is impossible for a family to isolate themselves from the world<br/>
<br/>
around them.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s true, isn&#39;t it?  <br/>
So what&#39;s the problem! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I liked this phrase:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; there was nothing in the Education Act that said children<br/>
<br/>
could be physically uplifted and made to go to a school. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Generally, it&#39;s not unusual English, but that phrase was cool.  I like <br/>
uplifting things.  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I liked this one too, for logic purposes:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&quot;These kids aren&#39;t getting their legal right to an education,&quot; Mr Eve <br/>
said.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of rights people aren&#39;t forced to exercise.  How oddly that <br/>
was put.<br/>
