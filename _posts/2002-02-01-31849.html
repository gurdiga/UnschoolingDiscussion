<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038024350">I wanted to introduce myself.  My name is kama and I am thrilled and <br/>
proud to be back in the loop.  Our family has homeschooled for three <br/>
years (some 13 and daughter 11).  Last fall our children determined <br/>
that they wanted to go to public school again......with dreaded and <br/>
reserved acceptance we supported them in their return to the kingdom <br/>
of tyrrany (my thought anyway).  That was in September and by end of <br/>
November my son started sharing his thoughts of the public <br/>
system.  &quot;I can&#39;t believe that we are there for seven hours&quot;,  &quot;I <br/>
can&#39;t believe that it takes us forever to do anything&quot;, &quot;I am tired <br/>
of waiting for everyone and everything&quot;, &quot;they keep us all in one <br/>
place&quot;, and &quot;they even have a fence around everything to keep us <br/>
there&quot;.  Through this process our son made the choice to leave the <br/>
system and return home and to the world.  I felt very proud and <br/>
excited that he had come to a place in his own heart and mind to <br/>
allow himself to re-enter and re-connect with what was important to <br/>
him.  My daughter has decided to finish out the year in Public school <br/>
and then buiy out of the system.  Anyway, it felt scary to allow that <br/>
part of the process to happen but the self motivation, self <br/>
assurance, and self knowledge that my children have obviously carried <br/>
them through.<br/>
<br/>
Long introduction but I wanted to share my moment.  Hope to be <br/>
posting, sharing, living, and learning with all of you over the next <br/>
part of our journey.</div>
