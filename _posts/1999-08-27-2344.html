place to at all, not just school, but medical things, dance lessons,<br/>
relationships with others, etc.  At the same time they ignored my pleas to<br/>
get involved in things that I was interested in or my feelings about things<br/>
they were forcing on me.  I hated them for it, and they taught me to hate<br/>
myself for &quot;never being able to finish anything I start.&quot;  The used to tell<br/>
me all the time when I was a child that I &quot;Never do anything right&quot; or<br/>
&quot;Fail at everything I try&quot;  or &quot;Just do not try hard enough.&quot;  I still feel<br/>
like a failure and am just now learning to grow and see beyond my parents<br/>
false expectations and pronouncements.  <br/>
<br/>
Even if I might have enjoyed something for myself, I often failed anyway<br/>
due to feeling forced, choiceless, coerced, etc.  Like when they forced me<br/>
into college at 16 even though I told them I was not ready.  It was either<br/>
that, or they were going to kick me out of the house.  So I went.  I did<br/>
get A&#39;s in several subjects that I really enjoyed, but others I just<br/>
stopped going to and took a failing grade.  I would have been much more<br/>
successful had it been my own choice or had I any options.<br/>

Wow, Nanci, this brings back a lot of bad memories.  I was a youngster when I <br/>
graduated from h.s. (16) and I BEGGED my parents to let me stay home for at <br/>
least another year and work (I had a good job that I liked) and take a couple <br/>
of classes at a community college.  Because although I was bright and got <br/>
good grades, I had NO idea what I wanted to do with my life.<br/>
They absolutely refused.  Instead, they opted to pay for a high-price <br/>
freshman year at a private school where I proceeded to pretend like I was <br/>
older than I was, collect as many boyfriends as I could, go to as many <br/>
parties as I could, sleep in as late as I could, etc., etc., etc. <br/>
I wasn&#39;t consciously trying to punish them, I don&#39;t think.  But, I felt like <br/>
I was almost giving up...kind of saying:  well, if people won&#39;t take me <br/>
seriously, I guess I won&#39;t be serious!<br/>
It took me a long time to get to the point where I trusted my own desires and <br/>
needs...in fact, I struggle with it on a daily basis.<br/>
Thanks for sharing...<br/>
