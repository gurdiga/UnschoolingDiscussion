<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209263387">Thanks to everyone for your help with my Renaissance questions.  If you all <br/>
remember, I didn&#39;t know whether or not ds should dress for it.  Well, we took <br/>
the complete costume and when we got there, ds wanted nothing to do with it. <br/>
LOL Once during the duelist shows, he wanted it on so we went to the truck <br/>
and put it on him.  They let us come in with the sword without a problem.  Ds <br/>
got up on the stage after the guys finished and had a duel with one of them.  <br/>
Luckily, he wanted it off right after and dh took it back to the truck, cause <br/>
it started pouring down rain.  We were all soaked and ds fell in the mud.  <br/>
All in all, we had a great time, but it was way too expensive to go twice.  I <br/>
wanted to share some pictures of my little knight with you all.  They were <br/>
taken just recently and not at the festival or I would have shared them <br/>
sooner.  I hope you enjoy them and thanks again for your help.<br/>
