 <br/>
What age (and school history) are you talking about?<br/>
 <br/>
I find myself taking breaks every now and then----still. It&#39;s during those  <br/>
times that I often seem uninspired and dull. It&#39;s usually preceded by or  <br/>
followed by intense creativity. As if I&#39;m either relaxing after  working really <br/>
hard---or saving up and meditating on what&#39;s next. Usually lasts  two-three <br/>
months, but then I&#39;m back to my old, high-wired,  whirlwind, manic self! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Want to give us more info?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would have thought it was this but it seems different. This is a kid who is having a hard <br/>
time remembering weekly rehearsals, the right times to get to his job, keeping up with any <br/>
relationships even when he really wants to and is essentially just working and playing a lot <br/>
of cards and X box. He expresses being overwhelemed at times - like he is unable to know <br/>
how to sort out his life.<br/>
<br/>
Yet from an onlooker&#39;s perspective, I don&#39;t see what is so difficult to juggle. His life is <br/>
pretty simple. So I want to understand. I have considered the possibility of ADD.<br/>
<br/>
Years back, he used to read voraciously, played sports, studied languages, built things, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a great kid in the ways that matter most. But I&#39;ve watched him pull in. I see less of <br/>
that curiosity and initiative now than I saw in years past. It seems that he is simply in a <br/>
cycle of work and cards and sleep.<br/>
<br/>
And has been for months.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m looking for some wisdom, experience. I sort of imagined that with increased <br/>
space and time in his life, he&#39;d naturally be expanding his horizons, not honing in on one <br/>
thing and mostly as a passtime. It&#39;s that he&#39;s 17 and I wonder where he&#39;s going... and if I <br/>
need to be concerned.<br/>
<br/>
Blech. Not saying this very well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-22343898">He has one rehearsal a week on Saturdays and has missed it twice in a row.<br/>
<br/>
And his work schedule is less than fifteen hours a week. (He&#39;s been early by hours many <br/>
times because he wrote the wrong times down - so far never late)<br/>
<br/>
He plays cards three times a week in the evenings.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought an actual break down of times might help. :)<br/>

<br/>
Did you used to remind him, when you had to drive him?  Is this a new <br/>
task for him?<br/>
<br/>
I remember reading a theory that as kids grow their brains completely <br/>
reorganize themselves a few times, every 3 or 4 years, I think.  Maybe <br/>
his brain is temporarily scrambled?  (Like a closet when you have <br/>
started to clean it by dumping everything out.)  Or maybe hormones are <br/>
affecting thinking power.  (Did you ever feel like your brain was <br/>
exceptionallly fuzzy when you were pregnant?  Maybe there are other <br/>
shifts in life that can affect brain function.)<br/>
<br/>
In an elderly person I would possibly suspect a side-effect from <br/>
medication, but it&#39;s unlikely that your son is taking anything.  (A lot <br/>
of &quot;senility&quot; seems to be due to medicine or interactions of multiple meds.)<br/>

Growth spurt?  Depression?  Performance anxiety?  Rebellion?  Terror?  <br/>
Being temperamentally more of a follower than a leader?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-464868786">Maybe it&#39;s not regression.<br/>
I mean...<br/>
Unless you had predicted a growth curve and a vision of how a 17 year old <br/>
should be, he can&#39;t &quot;regress.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We talk about who needs to be where the next day, and then in the morning <br/>
there are reminders. Or whoever&#39;s up double checks that others are up on time.<br/>
<br/>
The other morning I woke up lateish, 9:30.  I knew Kirby had a 10:30 meeting, <br/>
and so I got up to come and make sure he was awake.  He was already up, and <br/>
Marty&#39;s alarm was going off.  But Marty was in the shower.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of them needed me, but I would&#39;ve been fine with helping them, waking <br/>
them up, reminding them.<br/>
<br/>
I think some parents (probably not here, but I&#39;m thinking of relatives of <br/>
mine) kind of entrap their kids and say &quot;serves you right&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not going to <br/>
wake you up&quot; or whatever.   I still make sure Kirby&#39;s gi is clean before the <br/>
days he goes to karate.  Sometimes he washes it and sometimes I do, but if I <br/>
don&#39;t see it hanging up, I&#39;ll mention it.  I do the same things for my  husband <br/>
and he&#39;s way grown.<br/>
<br/>
-=- This is a kid who is having a hard <br/>
time remembering weekly rehearsals, the right times to get to his job, -=-<br/>
<br/>
Can you write all that on the public/family calendar?  We have one of those <br/>
big wall calendars from the office supply, and anyone&#39;s appointments and work <br/>
schedules and poker parties and stuff go on there, so we can all help each <br/>
other out.<br/>
<br/>
For social stuff, I coach, even the big kids. I&#39;ll ask how it&#39;s going with <br/>
one particular friend or another, or suggest they invite someone over I haven&#39;t <br/>
seen for a while, and sometimes they say &quot;Oh yeah, we should really do <br/>
something with him.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you ever tried to focus a pair of binoculars?  Everything is <br/>
blurry and you have to readjust and readjust and take the binoculars <br/>
away from your eyes to make sure you are pointing in the right <br/>
direction and then put them back and adjust again, until suddenly <br/>
the bird 200 yards away that you wanted to see is practically <br/>
sitting on your nose and everything else is peripheral.<br/>
<br/>
My kids used to be so interested in EVERYTHING, and flitted from <br/>
interest to interest so fast I could barely keep up.  As they have <br/>
gotten older, their interests have narrowed, but gone deeper.  <br/>
Sometimes it seems like they aren&#39;t interested in anything, but then <br/>
they pick up a few of the things again and go deeper still.<br/>

 <br/>
Do you think that your son could still be deschooling or decompressing?<br/>
 <br/>
Since you&#39;ve only been unschooling since 2003 and he has been doing sooo many things.  Maybe some of those things are things that he thought were expected from him?  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I remember you talking about his job at a  Starbucks a month ago or so.  How you were a bit disappointed in his mention of maybe wanting to work there for an extended period of time.   I think even those bits of feelings from us come across and it takes quite a while for our kids to shed those expectations.   For them to make decisions based only on their own desires, not ours.<br/>
 <br/>
He might just need time to figure out what he truly wants.<br/>
 <br/>
Just a thought.  <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
PS.  I also think the idea of a calendar of some sort is a good idea,  yet it sounds like he needs to decide whether he really wants to be doing those things or not. <br/>

We meet daily for now to just go over his schedule/calendar to help him remember so that <br/>
it &quot;sticks.&quot; It only takes ten minutes or so, but it is really necessary - we go over schedule, <br/>
money - what to spend or save and why, and stuff he needs to do that he hasn&#39;t scheduled <br/>
yet (like the dentist or oil change). I don&#39;t mind doing that with him, either.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know. Probably too hard to express in email. We are really for him, you know? I just <br/>
don&#39;t feel completely at ease with what I&#39;m seeing/observing and can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s me or <br/>
him. He expresses a feeling of being easily overwhelmed and withdraws to cope. I guess <br/>
I&#39;m wondering if that is a symptom of something like ADD or something else. I don&#39;t want <br/>
to miss a clue if that&#39;s what I&#39;m seeing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-756477046">I think there is something natural that frequently happens with kids <br/>
around age 12 or 13 where they&#39;re less like &quot;learning sponges&quot; - no <br/>
longer in the &#39;fact-gathering&quot; stage and less totally interested in <br/>
just anything and everything and far more selective. ALSO - they can <br/>
become far more focused on social relationships - spending hours on the <br/>
phone or IMing or emailing or just &quot;hanging out&quot; or reading books about <br/>
young adults and teens and so on.<br/>
