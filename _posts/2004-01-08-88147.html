*************************<br/>
I particularly like one of his older books called &quot;Hart&#39;s Hope.&quot;  It has a fascinating and weird mythology and great moral ambiguity running through it.  I like almost everything that he has written (haven&#39;t yet read some of the shadow series) and didn&#39;t like his horror novel (called the Box or something like that). <br/>
