<br/>
Could you e-mail the address again but break it apart so Yahoo doesn&#39;t <br/>
lop it off.  Pretty please.<br/>
Also, do you have a web address for it?<br/>

It makes chemistry possible WITHOUT the  emphasis on the math part of it.  When your child finishes this (at his/her own pace) they will have equivalent to 1st year college chemistry.  It&#39;s really good.  We got it a couple of years ago and then lost it (it&#39;s a hypertextbook) because of computer problems so I emailed Merlin and we downloaded it again.  He also sent us Astronomy as a sort of bonus the second time because he no longer offered the test that went along with the Alchemy program which we had originally bought.  I think the Alchemy is $40. for the entire program.  (The Astronomy is also really good! though I don&#39;t know the cost of it.)This is all on the computer so if they like science and using the computer then they will probably love this. <br/>
I&#39;m not preaching textbooks and structured learning here.  Just making it available to them to use as they would like.<br/>
Are any of you familiar with this program?<br/>

  Hi,<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;Could you e-mail the address again but break it apart so Yahoo doesn&#39;t <br/>
  &gt;lop it off.  Pretty please.<br/>
  &gt;Also, do you have a web address for it?<br/>
   I think the web site is www.synapses.ndirect.co.uk but you can type in Merlin&#39;s Academy of Alchemy in the search bar of your browser and that will get you there.  I think I originally found this by typing in Chemistry in my search bar.<br/>
  This is, BTW, designed exclusively for homeschoolers.  It is really great the way it is set up. It was created by a Dr. Jamie Love and he says that a child of 14 can easily master this course.   My ds started it at 12.  He has never finished it but still goes back to it and enjoys it.<br/>
   <br/>
  The email address as I have it is  (without the spaces) <br/>
  merlin @ synapses .co. uk.  <br/>
  The Astronomy program is absloutely wonderful!  It has sky maps sites and all sorts of great web sites that it includes in the study. If you have a child that&#39;s turned on by this subject this program&#39;s a MUST!<br/>
