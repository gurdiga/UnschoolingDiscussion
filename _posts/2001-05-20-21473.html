<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The reason kids look forward to going to public school is the <br/>
&gt; overwhelming propaganda and cultural machine that makes sure kids get <br/>
&gt; excited about it. Maybe you could talk to your daughter about her <br/>
&gt; specific concerns - what is it exactly that she wants from school. <br/>
&gt; More time with friends? Different crafts and opportunities to learn? <br/>
&gt; Riding a bus?? All of these things are things that you can arrange <br/>
&gt; for her without also burdening her with school.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For me, school is a place where  the magic that lives inside each <br/>
&gt; child is methodically extiguished. I want to keep the magic alive for <br/>
&gt; my children as long as they want it to burn.<br/>

age, girls especially,  completely bored with the homelife, and of course<br/>
dear old MOM.  I saw this in a five year old that babysat for a couple of <br/>
hours.<br/>
A few hours of being included in our homeschooling projects, she didn&#39;t<br/>
want to go home. <br/>
Her MOM couldn&#39;t understand the concept of homeschooling, nor did she-<br/>
nor would she have the gumption to even contemplate the idea. So, I gathered<br/>
MOM was needing a break from her also, and she was ready for her daughter to <br/>
go to kindergarten.<br/>
 <br/>
I think that if a child has an older sibling that goes to school, its almost<br/>
a give that they are conditioned early on.  By the time they are of age,<br/>
they have seen so many great things, plus being able to go somewhere<br/>
every day besided home is great....<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter went to PS, I sure didn&#39;t come close to teaching her<br/>
much at home, nor did I give her the attention I have recently come to<br/>
know through HS. And I wish I could go back and do it over.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess, sometimes one needs a good shake up much like what happened to<br/>
me with my LD son. Theres nothing like having the PS system turn your<br/>
child into a complete emotional mess. Had I been able to see into the <br/>
future a few years ago, I would have never put him through PS. NEVER!<br/>
<br/>
Through all the tribuatlons we have encountered, I understand both sides,<br/>
and respect the choices others make regarding the HS vs. PS issue.<br/>
