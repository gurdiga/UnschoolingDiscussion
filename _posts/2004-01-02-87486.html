<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149195684">&quot;I never knew that parenting could be like it is in my house.  I thought<br/>
there <br/>
was always an innate sense of distrust and it was a crap shoot whether you <br/>
even LIKED, much less loved your own child.&quot;<br/>

Oh, no! Now I am going to have to start keeping some Glena quotes also!<br/>
Beautifully put, Glena.<br/>
Aloha, Lee<br/>
