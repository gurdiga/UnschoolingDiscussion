&lt;&lt; I think in my house, it is important that our children learn no and learn <br/>
 how to handle the no&#39;s. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would have agreed with you not too long ago. No can do now!  Here&#39;s the <br/>
problem with no...it does not lead to creative thinking, it shuts doors <br/>
without a continued dialogue.<br/>
I think the most important thing when my children want something (often it&#39;s <br/>
not got anything to do with cost) is helping them figure out creative ways to <br/>
do it.<br/>
Maybe there is an obstacle in the path right now that prevent us from doing <br/>
said activity today, that&#39;s where the later comes in.<br/>
And I agree that following up and making it true is very, very important.<br/>
Later should not mean no.<br/>
If there is something they want to do that we don&#39;t have the money for, we <br/>
can write it down and start putting money in our &quot;family fun jar&quot;.  If it is <br/>
an item I truly can not afford, I help them figure out ways to creatively <br/>
attain said item.  There is barter, selling used items and a number of other <br/>
ways a person could acheive the things they truly want.<br/>
Sometimes when there is an obstacle and we dialogue, they decide it wasn&#39;t <br/>
that important all on their own.<br/>
No shuts doors. Let&#39;s figure out how to do that opens doors.<br/>
If the desirable outcome is going to hurt another person, then it&#39;s fairly <br/>
easy to point out the other side of it and come up with an alternate <br/>
situation that would appease the desire and not harm or upset another person.<br/>
My kids know that I will try to figure out ways to help all of us attain the <br/>
things we desire. This often means they have to work for goals or get <br/>
creative with their time and money, I don&#39;t see how that could ever be a bad <br/>
thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139874781">My mother in law said in these words years ago  &quot;You need to frustrate them <br/>
so they&#39;ll learn how to deal with frustration.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Right... so THAT is why she was so mean to her kids!  For their own good!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There frustration naturally occuring in the world.  I don&#39;t need to create <br/>
any so they can practice.<br/>
<br/>
They  might get broken bones someday too, but breaking their fingers for them <br/>
now so they&#39;ll learn to deal with bigger broken bones someday makes NO sense. <br/>
 It just adds more pain to potential pain.<br/>
<br/>
Creating frustration adds more frustration to more-than-likely <br/>
much-frustration.<br/>
<br/>
Modelling &quot;yes&quot; teaches them to be kind and helpful.  Modelling &quot;no&quot; doesn&#39;t <br/>
add joy or trust or hope or compassion.<br/>

have to learn to deal with. Whether it is something that costs way too much <br/>
that just isn&#39;t worth it. And yes I do know what toys are worth it and what <br/>
my kids will really play with. After 4 of them, I know all the ins and outs <br/>
of what looks good and what really is fun. But at the same time they do have <br/>
their own money and my no means no I won&#39;t but you can save and get it. And <br/>
sometimes they have and found out that it wasn&#39;t worth it at all. Then there <br/>
are just no&#39;s as to what the rules are in this house and what you can do and <br/>
what you can&#39;t. I guess it&#39;s just a matter of what works for different <br/>
families. At the same time, we are very careful to not say no to things <br/>
before we think about it.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But Mary B, THOSE kids aren&#39;t told &quot;yes&quot; for the same reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have many &quot;no&#39;s&quot; in my life. I just don&#39;t set myself up for them. I <br/>
may have problems to solve (as Ren pointed out), but RARELY am I beset with <br/>
&quot;no&#39;s&quot;. I don&#39;t set my children up for a bunch of &quot;no&#39;s&quot; either!<br/>
<br/>
If I can&#39;t afford a new pair of jeans, I won&#39;t go looking at them---I&#39;ll wait <br/>
until the day after payday. I just don&#39;t GO places where I&#39;ll be tempted. <br/>
<br/>
If I don&#39;t have the money, we don&#39;t go &quot;window shoppping&quot;. If I can&#39;t afford <br/>
a bunch of junk from the grocery store, the boys stay home---but I&#39;ll always <br/>
bring them Reese&#39;s or M&Ms home.<br/>
<br/>
Children who are not allowed anything are always wanting----wanting more than <br/>
just material things too. Attention-starved children would much rather have <br/>
their parents&#39; attention, but will make do with &quot;stuff&quot; if they can. THOSE <br/>
are the children I think you&#39;re referring to. They&#39;re ASKING their parents <br/>
for something because they want the love and attention. Children who are <br/>
&quot;smothered&quot; in attention and love and generosity and kindness don&#39;t show that <br/>
&quot;neediness&quot; that you&#39;re seeing.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to look at it in a different way: WHAT are they crying for <br/>
---those kids that you say always hear &quot;yes&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Mine don&#39;t cry for either.<br/>

&gt;&gt;house.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So what do you think would happen if your kids could have dessert when they <br/>
chose to? Or stayed up later than &quot;bedtime&quot;? Or got something just because <br/>
they wanted to check it out, but didn&#39;t really need it? Those are all things <br/>
I get to choose for myself, and I&#39;m a pretty okay person I think. My kids <br/>
too. They get to make those kinds of choices all the time. They&#39;ve learned <br/>
to make some pretty good choices for themselves, their bodies and their <br/>
family. We&#39;ve all made mistakes along the way, but that&#39;s part of the <br/>
learning process.<br/>
<br/>
The question about being out in a thunderstorm has come up here many times. <br/>
We get some wicked lightning here in the west. My answer is not &quot;No you <br/>
can&#39;t go swimming&quot;. It&#39;s more like &quot;Lightning is dangerous, especially if <br/>
you&#39;re in the water. Let&#39;s wait till it stops to get back in the pool.&quot; My <br/>
kids have become accustomed to me working with them to get to what they <br/>
want. They&#39;re pretty reasonable about waiting. Maybe it&#39;s semantics, but <br/>
maybe it&#39;s about being mindful of how we speak to our kids.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;ve seen plenty of kids who never get the no&#39;s and don&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>really like what I see.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What kind of things are you seeing? I like yes better than no and think my <br/>
kids are pretty reasonable people. They&#39;re also pretty good at taking other <br/>
people&#39;s feelings into consideration. They like to find ways to surprise and <br/>
please their friends and family. I like what I&#39;m seeing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;We all have them to deal with and if they are comparable to age, I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;&gt;see a problem with them at all.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But too many times we put roadblocks up for our kids that don&#39;t really need <br/>
to be there. It&#39;s not comparable to age. It&#39;s what adults had done to them <br/>
and think they need to do to their kids. We&#39;ve all broken out of the idea of <br/>
school being one of those things kids just &quot;have to&quot; endure. What about all <br/>
those other no&#39;s that seem so necessary for good character development? <br/>
Maybe they are also worth examining.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Again, that&#39;s my husband and me and our kids in our house.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We all do what we think is best for our family. Sometimes it helps to look <br/>
at our srongly held beliefs though. I&#39;ve tweaked a few of mine over the <br/>
years and my kids have been my best teachers.<br/>
<br/>

really like what I see.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve decided you&#39;ve seen plenty, I guess you don&#39;t want to see mine or <br/>
those I know well.  You&#39;d be impressed.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;No one said to frustrate the kids.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  My mother-in-law did.  Lots of &quot;experts&quot; have.  Homeschoolers sometimes <br/>
do.  Even if the exact phrase doesn&#39;t appear, the sentiment does.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But yes you can have the dessert you want <br/>
when you want it &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; dessert.  My kids can have whatever food they want when they <br/>
want it, and they not only don&#39;t abuse the privilege, they rarely eat candy <br/>
or cookies at all.  I threw some cookies away yesterday for just being too <br/>
old.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;yes you can stay up late if you want &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My  kids don&#39;t have bedtimes, but I got up this morning and the house was <br/>
dark, the computers were turned off, the animals had been fed, and three <br/>
teenaged boys were in bed.  <br/>
<br/>
There are some principles which don&#39;t change from family to family, but are <br/>
true of humans in general.   And I truly believe that too much &quot;no&quot; destroys <br/>
the happiness that can be between parent and child.  I&#39;m positive that ALL of <br/>
us know dozens of people who heard too much NO for every one who MAYBE didn&#39;t <br/>
hear it enough.<br/>

:-(  in which I talked about saying yes with our time and attention. When I <br/>
say yes it&#39;s not just about material goods. My kids aren&#39;t really outrageous <br/>
in their requests. I also say yes to being and doing with my kids. Yes we <br/>
can make that, yes I&#39;ll watch that video with you, yes you can create goop <br/>
in the kitchen, yes I&#39;ll play Baries or legos or whatever.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858192485">I don&#39;t think it is so much not saying no as to why<br/>
you are saying it.  If you are saying it to protect<br/>
maybe, but if you are saying it more than yes than<br/>
maybe it is control and not protection.  Such was the<br/>
case in my house.<br/>
<br/>
I was brought up to believe if you had control over<br/>
your kids you were a good parent.  Well, that only<br/>
works so long.  When you have them home 24 hours a day<br/>
the whole dynamic changes and eventually the control<br/>
thing doesn&#39;t work.  No don&#39;t put your feet on the<br/>
furniture, no don&#39;t eat before dinner (even though you<br/>
maybe hungry), no don&#39;t watch that no don&#39;t do this.  <br/>
<br/>
You have to find another way to deal with the family<br/>
and that way is pure and simple treat your children<br/>
like people and like you like to be treated.  Give<br/>
them the same control over their lives as you want<br/>
over yours and the no will gradually decrease and the<br/>
yes will gradually increase.<br/>
<br/>
I find if I have to say no to explain to them why I am<br/>
saying no.  It is not lack of saying no that causes<br/>
kids to be mean it is lack of respect and lack of<br/>
attention and lack of unconditional love.<br/>

benefit from learning these things too.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have become pretty savvy consumers after a few trials with buying <br/>
crap. They&#39;re pretty good at spotting advertising gimmicks and trendy toys. <br/>
And sometimes I&#39;m not the best one to determine (for them) what is crap <br/>
anyway. The things I think are dumb might get played with a lot. The kids <br/>
find some use in it that I couldn&#39;t see.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking, I say yes to my kids and yet they still don&#39;t ask for all <br/>
that much. Maybe it&#39;s like the lottery. If kids are used to getting 15 no&#39;s <br/>
for every yes, they just keep playing the game to get to the one time they <br/>
get the yes. My kids don&#39;t have to play that game. They truly don&#39;t ask for <br/>

have many adult friends that agree on what constitutes a &quot;quality&quot; item for <br/>
every child.<br/>
Some of the &quot;quality&quot; items bore my kids to death. And some of the schlocky <br/>
stuff that I wouldn&#39;t touch they have enjoyed.<br/>
The schlocky stuff that breaks easily is a great lesson in consumer awareness.<br/>
If I had controlled everything my kids bought, or even a large portion of it, <br/>
I don&#39;t think they&#39;d be the savvy consumers they are.<br/>
Think of it like this, how much money will a person spend on curriculum to <br/>
teach a lesson?<br/>
The &quot;curriculum&quot; I use is totally hands-on, uses real money, involves <br/>
real-life math, product comparison and gives AMAZING results. The cost for <br/>
this &quot;curriculum?&quot;<br/>
Well, it&#39;s hard to say, because it varies according to budget and so <br/>
on....but I bet I spend less by giving my kids money and access than <br/>
many,many homeschoolers do on prepackaged curriculum.<br/>

&gt;But Mary B, THOSE kids aren&#39;t told &quot;yes&quot; for the same reasons.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well neither one of us could really say what those reasons are.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Children who are not allowed anything are always wanting----wanting more <br/>
&gt;than<br/>
&gt;just material things too. Attention-starved children would much rather have<br/>
&gt;their parents&#39; attention, but will make do with &quot;stuff&quot; if they can.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes you are right but I do know of children, as far as I can see that do get <br/>
attention and love but always want the stuff too. When they always get it <br/>
they get use to wanting it and having it. Not all kids and certainly I can&#39;t <br/>
understand the circumstances surrounding it all either. I just can&#39;t say no <br/>
to ALL no&#39;s.<br/>

The schlocky stuff that breaks easily is a great lesson in consumer<br/>
awareness.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some of my daughter&#39;s (2 1/2) favorite things to play with are fast food<br/>
toys, especially ones that are figures of some kind. They all get mixed<br/>
up together in one &quot;universe&quot;. 2nd favorite - vehicles. Actually these<br/>
things are remarkably durable, and sometimes they are beautiful too -<br/>
remember the Madame Alexander dolls from McD earlier this year? Jayn is<br/>
always asking me to make a story about ..(lists dolls names)...which she<br/>
then takes over after only a few words. And you don&#39;t have to buy the<br/>
&quot;food&quot; to buy the toys at the drive-through windows. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well we really don&#39;t have a set bedtime here NOW and my kids get to eat <br/>
desserts pretty much when they want NOW and they spend their own money on <br/>
what they want. But the 2 year old doesn&#39;t get to stay up when she wants and <br/>
has to take a nap if she doesn&#39;t want, at least sometimes and she doesn&#39;t <br/>
get to consume a half a bag of MM&#39;s either. And when dinner is just 30 <br/>
minutes away, the others are told no to having a snack. And my 16 year old <br/>
does have a curfew and is told no to staying out until 3 in the morning. The <br/>
no&#39;s here always come with an explanation. But when it&#39;s thundering and the <br/>
kids would want to go out, I give the same explanation you do, the no just <br/>
comes first. I don&#39;t see a big deal in saying no at certain times. I&#39;ve said <br/>
it plenty to my teenager and lucky for us all, she has learned to say it <br/>
pretty often herself. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>

that doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t enjoy it. And sometimes the really great <br/>
looking stuff is crap. I&#39;m just saying that I KNOW this by now. And when <br/>
they were younger, we chose things together and yes they did find out for <br/>
themselves the hard way sometimes. But also when they were younger I let <br/>
them choose when I knew better, they didn&#39;t remember the lesson and we were <br/>
stuck with wasted money on things no one really wanted. So at cetain ages I <br/>
make the choices or should I say guide their choices so no one blasts me as <br/>
being controlling. I don&#39;t control everything they buy past a certain age <br/>
and now they are savvy consumers too. I just can&#39;t see letting a 2 year old <br/>
have the same choices my 7 year old has. I&#39;m sure someone will say why not <br/>
but it just doesn&#39;t make good sense to me in my house with my kids.<br/>

family life. I just find it hard here to have people question what I haven&#39;t <br/>
asked for when I&#39;m totally comfortable with it. Not meaning you in this <br/>
case. A good discussion about what works for others and what their <br/>
experiences are is one thing. Questioning what works for one family is <br/>
something else. Again not you, I&#39;m being general here. Just finding that one <br/>
small statement from me has gotten so big. And okay, I do like the last <br/>
word!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt;them<br/>
&gt;no about anything?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The no&#39;s directed at them was before when they were younger. I did know what <br/>
they liked and saw them spend money on things very disappointing. At that <br/>
time, they didn&#39;t learn and would go for the same kind of stuff the next <br/>
time. I would remind them about the lesson from before and in my way say no, <br/>
without saying &quot;&quot;no you can&#39;t have it.&quot; At the same time, being prepared to <br/>
actually say no if they insisted. I can probably think of one or two times <br/>
when that happened between the two kids I&#39;m speaking of. I stood my ground <br/>
because it was important to me and they forgot all about it when they found <br/>
something else. To me, that no wasn&#39;t damaging.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But first you said that you know exactly what your kids will want and <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ren<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I don&#39;t know where that came from!! Yes I said I know my kids and what <br/>
they like and yes I do know what will be played with and what won&#39;t. I&#39;m <br/>
talking about my 6 and 7 year olds. There is a point where that will all <br/>
change. So long term, I think not.  I just know how to help guide them in <br/>
their choices. And no I don&#39;t make the final say on things now. When they <br/>
were younger, yes I did. Hasn&#39;t seemed to hurt them any.<br/>
<br/>
As far as them asking for things that aren&#39;t up to my standards, you totally <br/>
lost me on that one. I have no &quot;standards&quot; it&#39;s just I know junk when I see <br/>
it! And now, those two children do too as well as the older one. The baby <br/>
will learn in her time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-11626116">I guess I would ask why a kid would have to learn about frugal shopping<br/>
in one &quot;lesson&quot;.  We don&#39;t expect our babies to talk in full sentences<br/>
when they utter their first sound, or run like gazelles when they first<br/>
pull themselves to their feet.  Why would a child be expected to know all<br/>
the secrets of smart shopping and getting a good deal after one or two<br/>
unhappy purchases? <br/>
 <br/>
And why would a child need to learn exactly the parents idea of a good<br/>
buy or a right toy.  Why isn&#39;t that a thing a person can figure out for<br/>
themselves?  Why would my husbands idea of the kind of shoes I should<br/>
wear, for instance, be somehow more right than my own? . ( he would pick<br/>
pointy, spikey, hooker shoes and I choose leather-free birks... so there<br/>
ya go.) <br/>
<br/>
I think if we can trust that kids will learn to read and write and<br/>
understand math just through exposure and experimenting and experience,<br/>
we could trust that same learning process when it comes to smart shopping<br/>
and healthy food choices and hygiene and all of life,  really.     <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently had this discussion with someone else, so it&#39;s been on my<br/>
mind some.  <br/>
<br/>
My son is ten.  He&#39;s a really nice boy, helpful and kind and generous. <br/>
He takes good care of himself and looks after our critters.  He&#39;s never<br/>
had a bed time or TV or game restrictions or food restrictions.  If he<br/>
wants cookies right before dinner he&#39;s welcome to them.  Only he can know<br/>
how hungry he is or whether he can comfortably wait until the food is<br/>
ready.   He stays up late some nights and always takes care of things<br/>
before going to bed, lets the dogs out one more time, brushes his teeth,<br/>
turns off the lights, etc.  He&#39;s healthy.  He&#39;s never had a cavity.  He&#39;s<br/>
not over weight.  <br/>
<br/>
Today we were shopping in another town.  We live in a rural area where<br/>
there&#39;s no real shopping and trips to another town come when we can<br/>
afford the gas and have a good reason to go.  Dylan had $40.00 with him<br/>
that he&#39;s been saving.  We went to Wal-mart, K-mart, the mall... he<br/>
didn&#39;t spend any of his money.  He looked at dinosaurs and Lord of the<br/>
Ring toys, he looked at Harry Potter stuff and Legos and games for his<br/>
Gameboy and Playstation.  He didn&#39;t find anything he wanted to spend his<br/>
money on.  We&#39;ve never told him how to shop, or what to buy.  Yes, he&#39;s<br/>
made some choices that he was unhappy with later but then so have I.  He<br/>
knew I had limited funds today and offered his money if I needed it.<br/>
( all together now, aawwhhh.)<br/>
<br/>
We believe in the power of yes.  Yes you can eat that, yes you can watch<br/>
that, yes you can stay up late, it all translates into yes we believe you<br/>
are smart and responsible and good.  And he is.  (did I mention he&#39;s also<br/>
cute?&lt;g&gt;) <br/>
<br/>
This is more discussion on a topic that you&#39;re probably tired of, but<br/>
it&#39;s been on my mind lately how some unschoolers believe in natural<br/>
learning as it applies to academics but not as it applies to life.  I&#39;m<br/>
not sure how we can logically separate the two.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand your post completely Deb, beer or no beer!!! I believe in the <br/>
power of yes too. And now we have no set bedtimes, although the little one <br/>
gets like a bear if I wait too long so once again I set a limit without <br/>
really saying so to her. It works for us.<br/>
<br/>
The kids pretty much do eat what they want when they want it unless once <br/>
again I&#39;m cooking something special for a family dinner and I tell them to <br/>
wait. And I don&#39;t actually say no, I tell them it&#39;s almost time for dinner, <br/>
can&#39;t they wait. The answer is always yes.<br/>
<br/>
They watch TV feely and play games freely and now buy stuff they want and <br/>
many times come home with nothing. It&#39;s been years since a toy has been <br/>
bought and set aside because it&#39;s not what they thought. I just don&#39;t see <br/>
why they would have to buy things more than a few times when once or twice <br/>
of me redirecting them gets the same end result. Again it has worked for us.<br/>
<br/>
I believe it&#39;s perfectly fine to try things differently depending on the <br/>
family and I also believe that many times we can end up with the same result <br/>
with many different ways of getting there.<br/>
<br/>
My children are also incredible. They&#39;re thoughtful, understanding, kind, <br/>
honest, responsible, happy healthy kids. And pretty darn cute themselves. <br/>
Once again I just see what works here for us. And one really never knows <br/>
exactly what goes on in someone else&#39;s life. We&#39;re not all perfect and <br/>
neither our the kids. We all do the best we can and when we know better, <br/>
hopefully, we do better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-280141737">I agree with this, too, up to a point. But it&#39;s also important to <br/>
remember that reality gives plenty of no&#39;s so the parents don&#39;t really <br/>
have to supplement them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t have a <br/>
&gt; problem with saying no as long as it&#39;s not more than once in awhile.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the discussion isn&#39;t really about saying yes or no. It&#39;s about being<br/>
your children&#39;s advocate. It&#39;s a mental shift from being their guardian to<br/>
being their companion in their journey through life.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you have problems with what you&#39;re doing, this mental shift won&#39;t<br/>
make much sense and the discussion will probably seem pointless. Why<br/>
*should* anyone stop doing what works?<br/>
<br/>
(One reason might be that it&#39;s always healthy to question our certainty! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
*Maybe* as the discussions come up again, you might see something in your<br/>
family dynamic that you&#39;d been unconscioulsy uncomfortable with but had just<br/>
accepted as the way things are and you&#39;ll say &quot;Oh, that&#39;s why that&#39;s<br/>
happening!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But until/unless that happens it won&#39;t make sense for you to go beyond &quot;You<br/>
do what works for you and I&#39;ll do what works for me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes you are right but I do know of children, as far as I can see that do get<br/>
&gt; attention and love but always want the stuff too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Observation is one of the ways we learn to parent beyond what our parents<br/>
modeled for us. We may see a certain method of parenting and like or not<br/>
like the results but observation often only gets us the surface. We can&#39;t<br/>
see and understand the dynamics of the whole situation.<br/>
<br/>
Being able to dig beneath the surface is one of the valuable things I&#39;ve<br/>
found among this group of people. (It&#39;s also one of the things that makes<br/>
some people uncomfortable with this list too!) I think the discussions often<br/>
come off as &quot;My way&#39;s right and your way&#39;s wrong.&quot; That isn&#39;t the intent.<br/>
(And I suspect there are eyes rolling at that ;-) The intent is to help<br/>
people question why they&#39;re doing what they&#39;re doing. The discussion helps<br/>
people get beyond &quot;This is what works for me.&quot; (And especially if &quot;this&quot;<br/>
involves control then the practice *will* get discussed! ;-) If someone<br/>
does&#39;t want to question why they do something, then it&#39;s best not to bring<br/>
something up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Questioning what works for one family is<br/>
&gt; something else. Again not you, I&#39;m being general here. Just finding that one<br/>
&gt; small statement from me has gotten so big. And okay, I do like the last<br/>
&gt; word!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, you won&#39;t be able to offer tantalizing family dynamics that the people<br/>
here love to discuss *and* have the last word ;-) It&#39;s like holding up a bag<br/>
of Oreos and then saying no one can even ask to have some ;-) Basically<br/>
anything brought to the list becomes fodder for discussion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503217794">I thought about unit studies. I decided we&#39;re doing unit studies <br/>
here--that last exactly as long as we want them to. I was at the <br/>
doctor&#39;s office the other day with dh, and the nurse asked why my 2 and <br/>
4 year olds weren&#39;t in school. I said &quot;Thay&#39;re BABIES!&quot; She said &quot;My <br/>
4-year-old is in kindergarten.&quot; I thought later I should have said <br/>
&quot;We&#39;re doing a unit study on the healthcare industry right now.&quot;<br/>
