&lt;&lt;  they&#39;d also have to<br/>
believe you&#39;d protect them from others limiting them, i.e, you would not<br/>
have a different set of rules at your parents house). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When we go to Keith&#39;s mom&#39;s and she has candy out she can say &quot;no candy until <br/>
dinner&quot; to my kids and make it stick, because we&#39;re at her house and it&#39;s her <br/>
candy.  If I have candy in the luggage or in the car, they can have some of <br/>
that.  Last time we had pretzels to tide them over.<br/>
<br/>
What didn&#39;t work at his mom&#39;s house was her telling Marty he couldn&#39;t have <br/>
dessert because he hadn&#39;t finished everything on his plate.  I said &quot;Marty, <br/>
you can have mine,&quot; and I slid the little raisen/carrot/mush/something over <br/>
to him without even looking at the mother in law.  Because she couldn&#39;t keep <br/>
me from giving my dessert away.  I had &quot;earned&quot; it.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t try to apply my  practices at someone else&#39;s house, nor would I <br/>
want them applying their practices at my house.  If I offer juice to a bunch <br/>
of kids I don&#39;t want to say to one, &quot;Except you, because it&#39;s not organic.  <br/>
You can have filtered water.&quot;   I don&#39;t offer things I know are allergens to <br/>
one of the kids there.  When the lactose-intolerant crowd is over, I don&#39;t <br/>
make ice cream sundaes or milk shakes.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t turn off the TV because another kid&#39;s family doesn&#39;t watch TV.  If <br/>
that child wants to watch TV, it&#39;s fine with me.  If she chooses not to, <br/>
there are tons of other things in the house to do.<br/>
