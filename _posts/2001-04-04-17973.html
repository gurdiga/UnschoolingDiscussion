&lt;&lt; For 4th grade in a private school, at the science<br/>
fair, I made this example of how electricity is<br/>
transformed...ran the wire, and hooked up the light<br/>
switch, etc. Cuz dad did it, I thought it was cool,<br/>
and didn&#39;t even realize I was using my brain when I<br/>
went to work with him. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My dad was a welder, mechanic, steel building contractor sometimes, and <br/>
worked for a mining company.  I went to work with him a lot---not for full <br/>
days, but when he had to go fix something or do something and it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
too long.  If it was a long time, I&#39;d hike in the hills behind the plant (a <br/>
smallish building with machinery to grind and sack mica, which was used to <br/>
add to paint, he said.  Paint for military uses, I heard later.  Maybe for <br/>
heatproofing stuff?  I don&#39;t know), which was on pueblo land in Pojoaque, <br/>
north of Santa Fe.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in college I took a technical writing course and they asked us to <br/>
describe one of a short list of thigns.  One was &quot;blow torch.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
So I did a paper on how the nozze of an acetylene welding torch works, what <br/>
it looks like inside, what the valves do and how to balance the oxygen and <br/>
acetylene, and the guy looked at it hard and kept turning pages, and said &quot;I <br/>
meant one of those little blow torches they sell at K-Mart.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I said, &quot;WHAT little blow torches?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When your dad has welding equipment in his truck at all times, you don&#39;t HAVE <br/>
a little blow torch at your house. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My husband is an engineer at Honeywell.  Holly has never seen where he works. <br/>
 The boys can vaguely remember some family open houses when they were little. <br/>
 It&#39;s a big security situation, and we can&#39;t go in, and his descriptions of <br/>
what he does are mega-boring.<br/>

<div><font face="Pooh">Oh my goodness. My dad was a dispatcher then a supervisor 
for the dispatchers at the sheriff&#39;s and city police station in Tacoma 
Washington. I remember when they had it at the county-city building before they 
moved it out by Costco in another area of the city. Because of my deafness, our 
city was the first to have a TDD installed at the police department, even before 
Seattle! and that was when I was all of 12 years old. My two daughters got a 
chance to see where Papa worked before he retired. It was really cool. Dad was 
able to show us the new computers they put in for the enhanced 911 calls that 
also shows your address and phone number when you call them. I don&#39;t know if 
Missoula has an enhanced 911. Its a much smaller town than Tacoma! </font></div>

<div><font face="Pooh">Since I don&#39;t work, Naomi has learned from areas around 
her. There is a coffee shop at the bus station here that she has learned how to 
serve customers at and make change at the cash register (she was only allowed a 
few times, she can&#39;t do it anymore now...because our friend could get fired for 
that)...but Naomi learned how to count cash money and figure out how to give 
change without using the machine to give the answer for her. She also likes to 
bag the groceries no matter where we go. So she does do the job for the baggers 
&lt;G&gt;. She is learning how to bag the groceries properly (I learned on the 
air force base in Mtn. Home, Idaho when I worked as a bagger there years ago).

I taught some  summer classes to  college-age ESL<br/>
students for a while, because the director thought it<br/>
would be GREAT if I brought the kids. She felt like<br/>
she was getting three English teachers for the price<br/>
of one. And truly, they were like aides in the class.<br/>
The students loved them. And IMAGINE what they learned<br/>
from the students, who were from all over the<br/>
world!Then there came a new director, and he said they<br/>
had to stop coming because it wasn&#39;t professional.<br/>
Needless to say, I told him to by all means find<br/>
himself a more professional instructor. Dh was<br/>
furious. He felt the guy was giving men a bad name. :)<br/>

  or<br>there&#39;s something he really needs to concentrate on.<br><br>I taught 
  some&nbsp; summer classes to&nbsp; college-age ESL<br>students for a while, 
  because the director thought it<br>would be GREAT if I brought the kids. She 
  felt like<br>she was getting three English teachers for the price<br>of one. 
  And truly, they were like aides in the class.<br>The students loved them. And 
  IMAGINE what they learned<br>from the students, who were from all over 
  the<br>world!Then there came a new director, and he said they<br>had to stop 
  coming because it wasn&#39;t professional.<br>Needless to say, I told him to by 
  all means find<br>himself a more professional instructor. Dh was<br>furious. 
  He felt the guy was giving men a bad name.
