<div id="ygrps-yiv-426499365">Marcie,  After reading your post, I want to share that I ,too, was a teacher. <br/>
 I know exactly what you are saying about being able to change.  I want to be <br/>
able to trust the kids,too, but it is very difficult.  It is as if we, the <br/>
ex-teachers , need the de-schooling.  All the yrs as children in schools, <br/>
then college, then teaching in the schools adds up to alot to shut out of a <br/>
person&#39;s mind, no matter how much other philophies make sense.  I have read <br/>
Holt, and agree with most everything I have read.  He,too, was a teacher; <br/>
however, I don&#39;t think he was a parent.  My point is that living with <br/>
children 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, is different than being with them for <br/>
prescribed hours each day.  When I taught, I was not a parent.  When I became <br/>
a parent, my ideas about educ. did change radically.  I cannot fathom putting <br/>
my kids in school, and I know homeschooling is definitely the best for <br/>
children, but I, too, find what works for me- at least for now- is a blending <br/>
of sorts.  I encourage  and offer ideas, and at times I fight the frustration <br/>
of having ideas rejected, and the &quot;teacher&quot; in me wants to rear up and &quot;take <br/>
charge&quot;.  This is why I am researching other ideas like  C Mason , and Samuel <br/>
Blumenfeld.  I don&#39;t know how much of it I may use, but I am open to learning <br/>
as much as I can about it all.  What each family ultimately feels most <br/>
comfortable  with in the long run, is what will matter most, and that&#39;s what <br/>
I&#39;m trying to keep in mind.                                                     <br/>
