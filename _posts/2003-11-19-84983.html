<br/>
We have been holding meetings of our Ohio JSA chapter of home<br/>
educated teens for the past three years. With some members who have<br/>
moved or gone on to college, and others who have gone back to high<br/>
school, our chapter needs new teen members. And as we enter this<br/>
exciting presidential election year, here is a great opportunity to<br/>
participate in our government, hands-on. I mean, how can we change<br/>
anything if we are not willing to participate? As JSA says, democracy<br/>
is not a spectator sport.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been our chapter advisor and have attended most JSA events in<br/>
our region. I have to say that from what I have observed this is a <br/>
great group of teens. They cover the entire political gamut, from  <br/>
anarchists to arch conservatives! For those intending to go to<br/>
college, this is an excellent activity that looks really good on<br/>
college and scholarship applications, too. Plus, it presents an<br/>
opportunity to meet lots of other teens, to socialize, to meet<br/>
important people in local, state and national government, to practice<br/>
public speaking, and to learn hands-on how our government really<br/>
works.<br/>
<br/>
Our district holds its spring session in Columbus, OH, right in the<br/>
State Legislature, for Spring State and part of the Summer Symposia.<br/>
The other parts are held at Ohio State and University of Cincinnati.<br/>
Then our region&#39;s Fall State is held in Cincinnati (will be<br/>
elsewhere for other parts of the country, of course), and in February<br/>
we journey to our U. S. Capitol for Winter Congress in Washington,<br/>
D. C. These are all such great opportunities for teens to participate<br/>
in this totally teen-run group and all its great acitivities. I<br/>
really want to encourage others to investigate these programs, start<br/>
their own home ed chapters so that home educated teens have a voice<br/>
in U. S. politics. If you live in our district (Ohio, Tennessee, West<br/>
Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana) please get in touch with me. And<br/>
everyone interested can visit the JSA web site to learn more about<br/>
JSA in their region of the country.<br/>
<br/>
During the year local chapters meet for various activities: debates,<br/>
thought talks, mock trials, caucuses, and lots of fun, the chance to<br/>
meet with other teens from all over the region. Founded in the<br/>
1930s, this is a nationwide non-profit non-partisan high school age<br/>
political group. We are looking forward to a most interesting year<br/>
leading up to next year&#39;s presidential election. Email me if you have<br/>
questions. Next big event in our part of the country is Fall State,<br/>
this weekend in Cincinnati, then Winter Congress with a trip to<br/>
Washington, D.C., in February. For more info on the Junior State of<br/>
America, a division of the Junior Statesman Foundation, go to:<br/>
http://www/jsa.org The server seemed to be down this morning, but<br/>
you can also phone JSA headquarters in California at: 800/334-5353 or<br/>
650/347-1600.<br/>
<br/>
Now, of course this is not the only way to get involved and learn <br/>
more about politics, about how our country is run.  Plenty of hands-<br/>
on opportunities out there, especially this next year.  But this is <br/>
one that I know about that might work for some teens.  I know it <br/>
could use far more home educated teen involvement, especially <br/>
unschoolers, and is very open to us.  Check it out.<br/>
