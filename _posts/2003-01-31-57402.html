a &quot;scientific level&quot; at the time. (Some seizures are like this. The <br/>

and 5.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115161591">As far as neuron damage,  I&#39;m wondering if the damage would be more in toddlers like 3 yr olds and younger.   If the child only had a TV to sit in front of and had no other interaction/stimulation.  <br/>
 <br/>
The extreme examples,  I would think.<br/>
