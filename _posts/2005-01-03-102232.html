<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661599343">Pam Sorooshian stayed with me a couple of nights after the second Live and  <br/>
Learn Unschooling Conference. She was a delightful guest: easy and  <br/>
agreeable----no trouble at all!  After this discussion, wrote me this note. <br/>
 <br/>
It feels a little tacky (to me) to be posting this on a public list, but I  <br/>
wanted to show how good a note like this can make someone feel. I asked whether <br/>
 I could post it here so that others could see what a nice thank you would <br/>
look  like.<br/>
 <br/>
It certainly made my day. <br/>

&gt; South.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; probably a bit more &quot;expected&quot; down  here----we&#39;re kind of old-fashioned<br/>
&gt; compared to the rest of the country!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well - in that case -- I owe you one!<br/>
<br/>
Kelly you are  the best hostess I&#39;ve ever met - I LOVED staying at your <br/>
house and I REALLy  appreciated you taking me all over the place and <br/>
letting me learn all about  your absolutely wonderful state. I had a <br/>
blast and want to go back. A lot.  It was so interesting and new and <br/>
different and I liked every single thing  about it. I really liked <br/>
meeting your family and really LIKED your family a  lot. And thank you <br/>
so much for introducing me to Christian  and taking  me to his house <br/>
because that was the chance of a LIFETIME and I still think  about it <br/>
all the time - just found the business card he gave me, in a pocket  of <br/>
my suitcase, and I got all happy just thinking about his house and his  <br/>
work!  I enjoyed the library and the state museum. I really liked  <br/>
driving all over and seeing different neighborhoods and different kinds  <br/>
of landscape. I had fun sitting in your kitchen playing cards. I had <br/>
fun  sitting in the other room with Cameron on the computer and me <br/>
reading a book  and just having a little bit of chat with him. I loved <br/>
getting to go to  where he was working. I had fun watching Ben with <br/>
Duncan and seeing the  shining light in your adorable little and big <br/>
boys&#39; eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - did I  mention that I liked the food too? The barbeque at your <br/>
house was especially  awesome.<br/>
<br/>
You have a real knack for making people feel comfortable and at  home <br/>
and treated like a queen at the same time!!!  And you did all that  <br/>
AFTER you&#39;d just put on a fabulous conference and you must have been  <br/>
completely exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
So - thank you so much!!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a  thank you note writer - never have been. If I have to FIND <br/>
cards and pens  and postage and get it all addressed and mailed - it&#39;ll <br/>
never get  done.<br/>
<br/>
But I just thought, maybe I never really told you how much I TRULY  <br/>
enjoyed myself that week and how much I appreciate it!!<br/>
<br/>
Come to  California - let me reciprocate,  okay?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031828992">I usually travel with a little box of blank note cards so I can <br/>
write out thank you notes if we are staying with people, or I can <br/>
write someone a short hello while we are traveling. <br/>
I almost always leave a thank you note tacked up on the fridge or in <br/>
their mail box on the way out. Most people seem to appreciate them.<br/>
<br/>
Something else that is fun to do as a thank you, is to take photos <br/>
while you are staying with someone, and then, when you get home, <br/>
send them one or a few in a frame(some frames have multiple slots). <br/>
I&#39;ve only done that a couple of times, but I got the idea from <br/>
someone doing it for me. I REALLY appreciated it, so did the people <br/>
I did it for. Especially since I was able to get a couple of shots <br/>
of the mom with the kids. It seems like it&#39;s usually the moms that <br/>
are HOLDING the camera, so they don&#39;t get too many photos of <br/>
themselves with their kids. :)<br/>
