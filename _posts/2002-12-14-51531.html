<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186019942">Not only did we get the sociology of education, we had an entire course <br/>
on classroom management -- a course that takes the word boring to new <br/>
places. One of the more interesting courses was the Philosophy of <br/>
Physical Education. You may laugh, but it was fascinating. We also <br/>
learned a lot about different philosophies of educating children, and <br/>
the professor was very open minded. We had to keep a journal, which I <br/>
still have. Here&#39;s two quotes from that class:<br/>
<br/>
* &quot;Entertain them hugely while educating them gently.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
* &quot; A true leader becomes progressively unnecessary.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should send Dr. Kelly a thank-you. She was one of those rare <br/>
teachers who want you to think, think for yourself, and expand how you <br/>
think. Just think - I learned a lot of about unschooling while in a <br/>
teacher education program (but then, that was the seventies.. perhaps <br/>
times have changed. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi Susan.  I took my first education foundations class two years ago<br/>
&gt; &gt; and we discussed John Holt and unschooling for about 5 minutes.  My<br/>
