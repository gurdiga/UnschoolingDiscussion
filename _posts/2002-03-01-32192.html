<div id="ygrps-yiv-528479757">Hi Sara,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;he&#39;s been resentful of his sister since she was born.  So I thought school<br/>
&gt;might give him something all his own & feed his outgoing social nature.  I<br/>
&gt;hoped we&#39;d see an improvement in his negative behavior. He was behind<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can completely relate and have many times questioned my choice to keep the <br/>
kids home when they seem so unhappy. My oldest sounds similar to your son. <br/>
She is also 7. We have 3 kids 7,5,2. It seems my oldest has a negative first <br/>
reaction to many things. I have found the more I push her out in the world <br/>
the more negative she becomes. So I treaat her very baby like, hold her when <br/>
I can, spend time one on one. Now my baby is 2 and you have a newborn who is <br/>
your primary focus. Do you have 1 close friend who your kids enjoy spending <br/>
time with? Now is the time to ask for help so you can focus on the sweet <br/>
baby with a difficult nursing situation.<br/>
<br/>
As for money, we have always just gotten by, short most months. Something <br/>
that helps us is that many things can be borrowed from libraries, and thrift <br/>
stories hold many treasures. Kids as young as ours really do not need to own <br/>
much. The internet can lead to many great conversations. We rent tapes from <br/>
the library too, like beginning watercolor, then let the kids go. Also, when <br/>
relatives ask what you need be very specific. If you really need storage <br/>
boxes instead of another plastic toy, say so.<br/>
<br/>
Now is also a time for your partner to get closer to the 2 older kids. They <br/>
get their cups full from a loving person and the burden does not weigh on <br/>
you. Oh, I let my kids sleep with me while baby is on my other side. <br/>
Something about that night time cuddle helps a ton. And it is not your <br/>
responsibility to make your little guy happy, though in hurts a ton to see <br/>
them unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
I have been tired, burned out from kids off and on during the 7 years I have <br/>
been a mama. I know reaching out to other like minded folks makes a <br/>
difference. I wish you well, rest, and peace in your home.<br/>
<br/>
Mary<br/>
