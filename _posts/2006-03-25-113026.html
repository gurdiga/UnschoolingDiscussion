The best way to find answers to things like this, if you have your  <br/>
home library close at hand, is something like Fowler&#39;s Modern English  <br/>
Usage.  It&#39;s probably easy to come by at used book stores, or cheap  <br/>
from Amazon (checking... Oooh!  They have a hardcover of the 1937  <br/>
edition for $6.27.  And used paperbacks of a pocket version from $1.94).<br/>

words and &quot;usage.&quot;<br/>

I was told by a teacher I trusted long ago that in American usage (I  <br/>
don&#39;t know which way Canadians lean on this one), &quot;grey&quot; was poetic  <br/>
now, and had to do not with color, but with mood and feeling and  <br/>
weather.  &quot;A grey day&quot; was okay, to describe the appearance and  <br/>
feeling of a subdued or sad day, but a crayon or a bucket of paint  <br/>
would be &quot;gray.&quot;  Maybe, I guess, a day where the sky was quite  <br/>
overcast but people were happy would be &quot;gray&quot; and not &quot;grey.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OOOH!  The Wikipedia site has some great useage notes!!<br/>
Grey is a good color to wear during lent it says, because it&#39;s the  <br/>
color of ashes.  COOL!<br/>
And brains are referred to as &quot;grey matter.&quot;<br/>
So there are phrases in which the -ey spelling is particularly used.<br/>
<br/>
No simple answers, but if you just want to say what color a couch or  <br/>
wallpaper is, without emotionally coloring it (oh!  Good Freudian  <br/>
slip, if Freud had been an interior designer), &quot;gray.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-80390995">Oooh. This one bit me in fourth grade. I read voraciously and had just  <br/>
finished reading a book about a &quot;grey&quot; horse when this word came up on a  spelling <br/>
test. I got it wrong (I think it was the only one I missed), went and  <br/>
double-checked my book, and there it was in black-and-white. I briefly thought  of <br/>
taking the book to the teacher and arguing my point, but I figured I knew the  <br/>
answer I get and it wouldn&#39;t change my grade, and I think of it every time I  <br/>
spell the word to this day! It also helps me to rein myself in when I want to  <br/>
correct my 6 year old&#39;s &quot;unique&quot; spellings. Some times I *just* want to say,  <br/>
&quot;You know, its usually spelled ____.&quot; But spelling is not always so  <br/>
black-and-white... there are so many shades of GREY! :~)<br/>

<br/>
When I was little I lived in Texas, where my name had five  <br/>
syllables.  Well now at &quot;Sandra Dodd&quot; it has three in most dialects  <br/>
and accents, but my Papaw (grandfather on my mom&#39;s side) called me  <br/>
&quot;Sandra Lynn&quot; and not only did the dipthongs turn it into five  <br/>
syllables, it took a long time to say it in his slow way of  <br/>
speaking.  Kind of &quot;Say-an-druh Leeyun.&quot;<br/>
Some of the older people in SE New Mexico still talk that way too,  <br/>
but we moved to Northern New Mexico when I was six, and my name sped  <br/>
up and shortened.<br/>

town!  Maybe Albuquerque!  (which was exotic to me in those days, for  <br/>
sure).  Maybe just Santa Fe, but still...<br/>

<br/>
  Better linguistically than hormonally!<br/>
<br/>
  When I was in Jr. High, we did the play &quot;Lil Abner&quot;.  I was a Dogpatch<br/>
girl...(kind of a hillbilly courtesan...) and there was a part of the<br/>
dialogue that I&#39;ve not forgotten:<br/>
  DaisyMae:  But Granny, we just wants to broaden our horizons!<br/>
<br/>
  Granny:  Your horizons are broad enough already!  Particularly yours!<br/>
<br/>
  I had NO IDEA what this meant, but the audience always laughed.  Come to<br/>
think of it, the girl playing Daisy had a pretty good grasp on the physical<br/>
aspect of puberty...<br/>
<br/>
  Tami, whose own horizons have broadened significantly since Jr. High-- in<br/>
lots of ways!<br/>
