<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062110972">Hi folks...<br/>
I hope this post doesn&#39;t bother people, but I was trying to think of a place <br/>
where there were creative people who would get what I need for some <br/>
brainstorming, and you are it.<br/>
<br/>
My best friend lives in CT with her husband and kids, Liam, 4, and Nick, 13. <br/>
Nick and my son Julian were born 4 days apart, and are like brothers. Nick <br/>
was in the public schools and hated it, and a while ago I discovered that a <br/>
Sudbury Valley School was being planned in their area, in New Britain. (For <br/>
those who are not familiar with this model, Sudbury Valley Schools are kind <br/>
of Unschooling schools. The kids have the freedom to learn when and as they <br/>
wish, with support of staff when they want it. The kids are also hugely <br/>
involved in the actual running of the school. ) They got involved, and Nick <br/>
has been attending, deliriously happily, for the past year. Their web site is <br/>
here:<br/>
<br/>
However, the school is now struggling. They need more students if they are <br/>
going to survive next year. Nick does not want to homeschool, but if the <br/>
school closes he&#39;ll probably end up back in the public schools for high <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
So, my questions. First, do you know anyone in the Hartford/New Britain area <br/>
who would be interested in a Sudbury Valley School? Second, do you have any <br/>
ideas about how and where they can market? Where do you find parents who <br/>
might &quot;get it?&quot; and trust their children?<br/>
<br/>
If this is inappropriate, please let me know. People are welcome to respond <br/>
to my e-mail directly. I just think you&#39;ll be a great source of wisdom, since <br/>
you already trust your children.<br/>
<br/>
