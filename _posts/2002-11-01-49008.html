<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251223889">Ok, I have a question for all of you who have read The Continuum Concept.<br/>
<br/>
Does the book include what to do for the masses of people who weren&#39;t raised in the way that she sees as good/healthy?<br/>
<br/>
I went to Amazon and Leidloff&#39;s website to figure out if it actually talks about that and I couldn&#39;t find it.  <br/>
<br/>
I do want to read it, but if it doesn&#39;t have any solutions for me in how I can help heal myself and my kids from not knowing about it,  attachment parenting and such, I think I&#39;m going to be disappointed.  Maybe there are other books or resources out there, if this one doesn&#39;t have it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What do you all think?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

What do you all think?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s never too late to have a happy childhood.&quot;  I think that statement has <br/>
some real truth to it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not too late to see that even today, now, your children are learning <br/>
from what  they see adults doing, and that there are many REAL things, adult <br/>
things, that you could cut them in on and let them help with, or hang around <br/>
and watch at least.<br/>
<br/>
You can explain to them that you wish you had done different when they were <br/>
little, and why.  And that will affect the way they raise their own children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277721224">I think the book would be a help to you.  It was a help to me with <br/>
some emotional healing that I had to do.  <br/>
<br/>
The only caution I give with the book is that it is very heavy in <br/>
evolutionary theory, so any Christian who believes in creation has to <br/>
be willing to look past that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596685300">Hi Kelli<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m struggling with the same effort.  I joined the tcc list and found<br/>
the discussion is mostly amongst those with very young children/babies<br/>
(so not quite so relevant to me) but they are discussing how to apply<br/>
the concepts in the modern world.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t yet found a way to heal me or mine from lack of continuum.<br/>
