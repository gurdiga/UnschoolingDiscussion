<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611028740">Well ladies and gentlemen, the curfew has been lifted. When I went in and <br/>
told Tara, her face lit up like a 4 year old on Christmas morning. Then she <br/>
looked kind of scared almost. When she asked what time she should be in, I <br/>
told her the curfew was lifted. So she said she knew but what time did she <br/>
have to be in??!! I explained that there was no longer a curfew and she was <br/>
dumbfounded. She said she was scared now because what if she comes in at <br/>
1:15? And I said no problem because you won&#39;t be late. She just promised me <br/>
I could trust her, which I said I knew and that&#39;s why I was doing it. Then <br/>
she asked if I told my husband yet and I said not yet and she said he would <br/>
kill me!!! We usually disagree on most matters concerning her. But since she <br/>
came from my loins, I always win. Maybe not fair but it works for us!!!<br/>

She may come in late, to guage your reaction. I would try to not react.<br/>
Also, does she have a way of calling you when she is out? A cell phone or<br/>
walkie talkie? Also, I think she could still let you know where she is<br/>
going, who she&#39;ll be with and about what time to expect her with a call if<br/>
she&#39;ll be later. This is safety.<br/>

Kirby was in before 10:00, but it was a.m.<br/>
<br/>
If you and your husband are NOT in agreement about such things, I recommend <br/>
maybe telling her the no-curfew situation holds as long as she doesn&#39;t abuse <br/>
it.  And abusing it could be not letting you know where she is, not being <br/>
there when you wake up, stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
I knew where Kirby was and had a pager number and a cellphone number.  The <br/>
first several times he was out all night I found e-mail from him in the <br/>
morning telling where he was and what had happened.  So his leash gets longer <br/>
every time he acknowledges there is a legal requirement and moral and social <br/>
reasons for me to know where he is.<br/>
<br/>
But he started from little-kid-dom and not as a teen.  <br/>
