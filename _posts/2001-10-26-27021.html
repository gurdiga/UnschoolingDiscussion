<br/>
Maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, it&#39;s starting to appear, once again this is the result of our <br/>
government&#39;s selfishness and callous treatment of other nations&#39; people.<br/>
<br/>
If there is any truth to what&#39;s below, then the terrorists knew something we <br/>
didn&#39;t know, which wouldn&#39;t surprise me.<br/>
<br/>
The war in Vietnam was not our sympathy for poor locals, was it?<br/>
And was it to stop the advances of communism?<br/>
(Communism seems to stop it&#39;s own advances pretty well.)<br/>
<br/>
Could EVERYTHING below be a hoax?  Is it informational terrorism?<br/>
(Is any of it false?)<br/>

&gt;Date: Thu, 18 Oct 2001 17:31:22<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;*************************************************************<br/>
&gt;&gt;A compilation of disturbing facts, also reported by the highly respected <br/>
&gt;&gt;BBC.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;****************************************************************<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Foreign Press Reveals Colin Powell Negotiated Afghanistan War Months <br/>
&gt;&gt;Before<br/>
&gt;&gt;Suicide Air Attacks:  Motive is Oil Profits for Multinational War Partners<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The BBC and an Indian news agency in separate stories, one month before <br/>
&gt;&gt;and one<br/>
&gt;&gt;shortly after the suicide air attack on America, have presented the most<br/>
&gt;&gt;horrendous picture to date regarding the true nature of the terror in NYC <br/>
&gt;&gt;and<br/>
&gt;&gt;elsewhere: Prior knowledge.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Those backing President Bush&#39;s request for a coalition had better make<br/>
&gt;&gt;certain they are getting their fair share of the spoils of war, a war<br/>
&gt;&gt;arranged months before the suicide air attacks against the US.  A pact for <br/>
&gt;&gt;war<br/>
&gt;&gt;against the TalSE Asia Oil Pipeline, which <br/>
&gt;&gt;cannot<br/>
&gt;&gt;take<br/>
&gt;&gt;place with growing political and religious upheaval in the region at the <br/>
&gt;&gt;hands<br/>
&gt;&gt;of the Taliban.  Iran is thought to be a covert member to the pact.  The <br/>
&gt;&gt;combat<br/>
&gt;&gt;was initially slated for mid October, which would seem to account for <br/>
&gt;&gt;warnings<br/>
&gt;&gt;that preparing for war will take time.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The problem is that the ONLY logical pipeline route runs for nearly a<br/>
&gt;&gt;thousand miles along the Afghanistan border with Iran and Pakistan, <br/>
&gt;&gt;(largely so<br/>
&gt;&gt;close as to be visible from the border).  This route would seem to provide <br/>
&gt;&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt;US with the bestt serving the same oil<br/>
&gt;&gt;fields<br/>
&gt;&gt;in northern Iran and points south, preventing China from obtaining a <br/>
&gt;&gt;defacto<br/>
&gt;&gt;monopoly holder on oil supplies for SE Asia.  The Chinese began <br/>
&gt;&gt;negotiating that<br/>
&gt;&gt;project in 1997, causing a great deal of consternation for the Clinton<br/>
&gt;&gt;administration and major US oil companies who stood to gain little in the<br/>
&gt;&gt;project.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;However, the Taliban are fomenting both religious and political <br/>
&gt;&gt;instability in<br/>
&gt;&gt;the region between Iranian and Pakistani Shiites and Taliban Sunni Islamic<br/>
&gt;&gt;sects, with notable success.  This unrest makes impractical the financial<br/>
&gt;&gt;investment and international cooperation required to construct the <br/>
&gt;&gt;pipeline.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The solution was apparently to be death warrants for both the Taliban <br/>
&gt;&gt;leader<br/>
&gt;&gt;Mullah Mohammad Omar, and capitalistic terrorist Osama bin Laden, who had<br/>
&gt;&gt;apparently grown too profitable and too strong for his former CIA masters <br/>
&gt;&gt;to<br/>
&gt;&gt;control.  Destruction of the Taliban was imperative, but political needs <br/>
&gt;&gt;would<br/>
&gt;&gt;not permit a simple solution.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;For Pakistan and India, long bitter rivals, to partner would require only<br/>
&gt;&gt;sufficient profits to make peace between them more palatable.  However,<br/>
&gt;&gt;Pakistan required a significant motive beyond profits to risk internal<br/>
&gt;&gt;conflict due to its nation&#39;s divided religious and political landscape, <br/>
&gt;&gt;all<br/>
&gt;&gt;intertwined with allegiances to the Taliban.  There needed to be an <br/>
&gt;&gt;extremely<br/>
&gt;&gt;irresistible reason for the nation&#39;s leadership to back/support military <br/>
&gt;&gt;action<br/>
&gt;&gt;against what their own citizens considered a virtual spiritual ally.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;In like manner, Iran required an irresistible reason to publicly support <br/>
&gt;&gt;with<br/>
&gt;&gt;vocal blessings American interests in any such action, and at the same <br/>
&gt;&gt;time,<br/>
&gt;&gt;needed a way to salve bitter wounds between the two countries which would <br/>
&gt;&gt;allow<br/>
&gt;&gt;future joint financial ventures.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;In similar manner, the United States needed a very powerful and <br/>
&gt;&gt;irresistible<br/>
&gt;&gt;reason to mobilize America into supporting such a war, a war which would <br/>
&gt;&gt;be<br/>
&gt;&gt;extremely difficult to prosecute, as the Soviet Union could testify of <br/>
&gt;&gt;first<br/>
&gt;&gt;hand, having found the Soviet-Afghanistan war to be their &#39;Vietnam.&#39;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The logical solution which would indeed provide irresistible reasons for <br/>
&gt;&gt;all<br/>
&gt;&gt;concerned, would now seem to be the horrific terror campaign against NYC <br/>
&gt;&gt;and<br/>
&gt;&gt;Washington DC.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Separately, it seems, one of the terrorists was seen by Mossad agents to <br/>
&gt;&gt;have<br/>
&gt;&gt;consulted with Iraqi intelligence operatives prior to the attack, a matter<br/>
&gt;&gt;passed to CIA as a warning that perhaps Iraq and Afghanistan were <br/>
&gt;&gt;partnering.<br/>
&gt;&gt;  US Intelligence confirms this event but claims it was not because the<br/>
&gt;&gt;terrorism was sponsored by Iraq, a matter not evident to Mossad, yet CIA<br/>
&gt;&gt;seems to know.  Indeed, the conference was likely for the personal sale of<br/>
&gt;&gt;information regarding the truth of the coming attack, which in part <br/>
&gt;&gt;accounts for<br/>
&gt;&gt;Iraq&#39;s somewhat evenhanded statements on the disaster, as well as those of<br/>
&gt;&gt;Libya.  Both nations would now seem to be jointly blackmailing US <br/>
&gt;&gt;intelligence<br/>
&gt;&gt;for a slice of the action and continued safety -- in exchange for kind <br/>
&gt;&gt;words and<br/>
&gt;&gt;a hands-off policy towards the looming military action.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The attack comes in the wake of revelations by author James Bamford in his <br/>
&gt;&gt;book<br/>
&gt;&gt;Body of Evidence of a secret plan for US military intelligence <br/>
&gt;&gt;cooperatives to<br/>
&gt;&gt;commit acts of terrorism against American targets... blow up buildings, <br/>
&gt;&gt;shoot<br/>
&gt;&gt;down civilian airliners, blow up American war ships, and assassinate <br/>
&gt;&gt;American<br/>
&gt;&gt;citizens... for political gain.  Operation Northwoods was signed off by <br/>
&gt;&gt;all five<br/>
&gt;&gt;Joint Chiefs of Staff under the Kennedy administration as a way to foment <br/>
&gt;&gt;public<br/>
&gt;&gt;support for a war against Cuba, who would be blamed for the terrorist <br/>
&gt;&gt;acts.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Rejected sternly by President Kennedy, which may have contributed to <br/>
&gt;&gt;reasons<br/>
&gt;&gt;behind his assassination, this Reichstag fire approach to political gain <br/>
&gt;&gt;may<br/>
&gt;&gt;have been the model for September 11, shifting the blame this time to the<br/>
&gt;&gt;Taliban homeland.  What would make a more irresistible excuse for war?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;In light of these revelations, American media needs to decide if it will<br/>
&gt;&gt;continue to ignore truth and the principles of journalism for its <br/>
&gt;&gt;preferred<br/>
&gt;&gt;role<br/>
&gt;&gt;as Fourth Estate PR spokesperson of government.  Will they tell America <br/>
&gt;&gt;these<br/>
&gt;&gt;facts or hide what the rest of the world already knows through news <br/>
&gt;&gt;agencies<br/>
&gt;&gt;which have no such loyalties?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Will American politicians find themselves being asked by their <br/>
&gt;&gt;constituents if<br/>
&gt;&gt;they knew in advance of this death pact, and have the blood of innocents <br/>
&gt;&gt;on<br/>
&gt;&gt;their hands as coconspirators, or will they demand a full accounting of <br/>
&gt;&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt;facts before signing off on the blood lust boiling over as result of this <br/>
&gt;&gt;war<br/>
&gt;&gt;plot?<br/>

Those are strong words, Cindy. But very honest and thought provoking. <br/>
I think every American should be reevaluting their ideas on <br/>
patriotism, why they are participating in it, and what is their <br/>
message when they do.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, have been uneasy seeing the mass surge of patriotism, flags <br/>
everywhere you look. I have purposely chosen to (once again) go <br/>
against the norm. We&#39;re practically the only one on in the <br/>
neighborhood without a flag billowing in the front yard, on our car, <br/>
on our person, etc. But I will step up to the challenge and argue <br/>
with anyone who says I am being un-American for my lack of supposed <br/>
patriotism. I am who I am first. I question things, even things &quot;my&quot; <br/>
government is doing. I don&#39;t think that is un-American. I think that <br/>
is being a true American - a free thinker.<br/>

little harder when he makes a statement referring to the Afghanistan border <br/>

one side of Afghanistan, which runs on down between Iran and Pakistan to <br/>

People become attached to places for all kinds of reasons. Many people are stuck living under various governments who they may or may not agree with. Free speech and thought are what it means to be living in a democratic society no? <br/>
<br/>
&quot; Who moved out of this country as a result of the Vietnam war?&quot;<br/>
Teri<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the numbers, but there are very many conscientious objectors, draft dodgers and deserters, who left the US during the Viet Nam war, and now call Canada home. What if &quot;they&quot; made unschooling and home schooling etc...illegal. Would you be looking for a new place to live? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-986307540">This country was founded on violence and it continues till today.  Running<br/>
around singing its praises isn&#39;t going to make it better, just the reverse.<br/>
<br/>
Now, more than ever, it is time to stand up and make this sorry excuse we<br/>
have for a government accountable in every way shape and form!<br/>
<br/>
And, just a note, there are lots of people leaving and for countries that<br/>
are as good and some feel are actually better.<br/>
<br/>
This country needs lots of work to be the best.  For starters they (meaning<br/>
the idiots in DC) need to get their noses out of other countries businesses.<br/>
The current problem is the direct result of that interference in other&#39;s<br/>
business!  Who do you think trained, supplied and financed the Taliban to<br/>
begin with?  We are now reaping the results of interference in another<br/>
country&#39;s politics!<br/>

<br/>
If you all read the declaration of independence you will see that this is the America I love.  It has gotten lost, we, as a country have forgotten what has made us great.  That is the America I am proud to live in.  That is the America I want to teach my kids to love.  Think what al our forefathers fought for...we need to defend that.<br/>
<br/>
We have so many freedoms versus other countries, these are the things I think of when I think of living somewhere else.  We have taken for granted all our priveleges.  I guess I mean for us to get back to the basics.  Compare what we have to what other countries have.  Then make America what you want.  <br/>
<br/>
Be glad that you can complain about our government.  Be glad that you can pray to your own god.  Celebrate what makes America great and change what you don&#39;t like.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364712795">If they get the other law pushed through behind closed doors, complaining<br/>
about the government will become illegal!  As it is, the one they just<br/>
pushed through has more or less taken away all one&#39;s rights to privacy.  It<br/>
no longer takes a &quot;local&quot; as in state judge to sign a search warrent or wire<br/>
tap warrent.<br/>
<br/>
For those that think the &quot;grandfather&quot; clause is anything more than a big<br/>
pile of what a bull leaves behind, check your history books to see if any<br/>
law with a grandfather clause has ever lapses when it was suppose to be<br/>
grandfathered out!  AND, contrary to all the hot air the politicians are<br/>
pushing out, all parts of that new law do NOT have a grandfather clause.<br/>

rest of the world &quot;United We Stand.&quot;  Personally I&#39;m not to fond of all the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126441267">Well, they have told the media that they aren&#39;t going to give them<br/>
information except on a &quot;need to know&quot; basis which translates to &quot;we are<br/>
going to sanitize the information before you get it&quot; and &quot;we are only going<br/>
to tell you what we want you to know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For those that aren&#39;t old enough to remember the hysteria following the<br/>
McCarthy era, let me tell you a little about what happens.  For example, my<br/>
grandfather was a union organizer and Communist.  That meant that all of my<br/>
family on that side was on the Red List (that is what the CIA and Feebs<br/>
called the files they kept) which meant, for example, that my uncle couldn&#39;t<br/>
get his bar card to practice law.  It also meant that all of us to this day<br/>
are still on that list.  I happen to have several notation on my<br/>
file--Berkeley, Alcatraz, SLA and, horror of horrors, Indian!  And, yes I<br/>
know the file is there because I was dating a high level DEA agent back in<br/>
the 80s and he was informed that knowing me could be detrimental to his<br/>
career and he was shown the file.  Why, I had the audacity to go to school<br/>
with AND go to slumber parties at the home of Nancy Ling Perry who was a<br/>
real &quot;evil doer&quot; and became a member of the SLA!  And, naughty, naughty, I<br/>
raised hell at some protests in Berkeley!<br/>
<br/>
I got a call from him a couple of months ago to tell me that all those old<br/>
files were being dusted off because of the SLA trial in LaLa Land.  I can<br/>
just image what is happening now with those files and the new ones they are<br/>
opening!<br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me, any history buffs out there?  Anyone else see the<br/>
similarities between Hitler and Dumbya?  The same retoric about &quot;evil&quot; in<br/>
our midst???<br/>

&gt; our loss of civil liberties will go.   I remember the 60s and the Nixon<br/>
&gt; years where the FBI and the CIA did a lot of underhanded intimidating of<br/>
&gt; protestors and others those in power labeled as enemies.  Will this new<br/>

&gt; violence in this endeavor?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713796922">Vietnam was a French colony.  The war originally started because once again<br/>
we had to play the great rescuer and help our good buddies keep folks in<br/>
servitude.  The politicians used the oil thing as an excuse.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to our need for cheap oil.  BS!!!  Pure unadulterated bs being fed<br/>
to the American taxpayer!  The U.S. uses 56 billion gallons of diesel each<br/>
year.  It takes 1 barrel of crude to make 10 gallons of diesel.  We imported<br/>
140 million barrels of crude in 2000.  Not withstanding the other things we<br/>
get from a barrel of crude, if we changed over to biodiesel, not only would<br/>
we come close to stopping our dependence on imported oil, we would reduce<br/>
diesel created polutants--sulfur by 100%, soot by 70%, carbon dioxide by<br/>
100% and nitrogen by 30%.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to do a thing to a diesel engine to use biodiesel.  The<br/>
engines last longer and you get better mileage.  Oh, and it would reduce<br/>
landfills and other waste disposal problems as you can reuse all the fry oil<br/>
that restaurants use!<br/>
<br/>
We currently spend $5.7 billion on farm welfare.  If all those fallow fields<br/>
were put to work growing soybeans and corn, we could cut the farm welfare in<br/>
half.<br/>
<br/>
If the government got over its false paranoia about hemp, places such as the<br/>
reservations where little will grow could become self-sufficient as hemp<br/>
literally grows like a weed (hence the nickname for its cousin) anywhere.<br/>
AND, it burns even cleaner and produces better gas mileage than other<br/>
biodiesel fuels.<br/>
<br/>
We have the means, but our government is in the pockets of folks that don&#39;t<br/>
want the price of gas to go down.  Biodiesel at the most would cost $0.99 a<br/>
gallon once sufficient refineries were developed.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the other thing they don&#39;t want the average taxpayer to know, you can<br/>
make biodiesel in your garage!<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually I think they are trying.  I heard on a news report today that<br/>
&gt; Lockheed Martin has been awarded a huge contract - one of the largest<br/>
&gt; in history.  The business reporter said that was very good news for<br/>
&gt; the defense sector since Lockheed Martin will have to sub out some<br/>
&gt; of the work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As I was driving today, I also recalled that one of yesterday&#39;s news<br/>
blurbs<br/>
&gt; (I only do blurbs since I can&#39;t take any more than that!) was from either<br/>
&gt; Cheney or Rumsfeld and that they didn&#39;t think it likely that they would<br/>
&gt; actually be able to capture Bin Laden.  Which after reading the forwarded<br/>
&gt; article from Sandra seems to support some of that article&#39;s claims.<br/>

We met at the home of a schoolmate (who had moved in from NYC--suspicious all <br/>

school (more arts than politics, by far).  Her mom was working on a newspaper <br/>
called El Grito del Norte, which turned out to be funded by or related to or <br/>
something, communists.  So for having bee at a meeting at Tessa Konigsberg&#39;s <br/>
house (she later took her mom&#39;s name, Martinez, to blend in in Espanola <br/>
better), we got &quot;files,&quot; and the school was warned to watch us.   <br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t take much in those cold-war days.<br/>

Tessa&#39;s family did go to Cuba every summer to pick coffee or cut cane or <br/>

&gt; &gt;For those that aren&#39;t old enough to remember the hysteria following the<br/>
&gt; &gt;McCarthy era, let me tell you a little about what happens.  For example,<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt;grandfather was a union organizer and Communist.  That meant that all of<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt;family on that side was on the Red List (that is what the CIA and Feebs<br/>
&gt; &gt;called the files they kept) which meant, for example, that my uncle<br/>
couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;get his bar card to practice law.  It also meant that all of us to this<br/>
day<br/>
&gt; &gt;are still on that list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Gee, I wonder if I&#39;m on it.  My dad couldn&#39;t get the right security<br/>
&gt; clearance from NASA for a job he was doing for them in the 60&#39;s.  His<br/>
&gt; crime?  He had gone to a Leadbelly concert way back when that was a<br/>
&gt; fundraiser for some left wing group.  He was also on the board of<br/>
directors<br/>
&gt; for the Berkeley food co-op.  Pretty nasty stuff.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
The lists go beyond ridiculous!  Hubby&#39;s father came here from Italy.  In<br/>
Italy at the turn of the century everyone was a Fascist.  It didn&#39;t mean a<br/>
thing &quot;there.&quot;  DH&#39;s father fought in WWII even though he didn&#39;t have to<br/>
(age and sole support of his mother), was discharged on a medical from<br/>
injuries.  But they are still on the list because of the politics when they<br/>
came over.<br/>
<br/>
Ex-hubby&#39;s family is on it because his grandmother&#39;s brother was Mafia.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is time our government got a life, a real life!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; That was crazy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We met at the home of a schoolmate (who had moved in from NYC--suspicious<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; on its own! &lt;g&gt;) to get her mom&#39;s advice about an underground newspaper at<br/>
&gt; school (more arts than politics, by far).  Her mom was working on a<br/>
newspaper<br/>
&gt; called El Grito del Norte, which turned out to be funded by or related to<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; something, communists.  So for having bee at a meeting at Tessa<br/>
Konigsberg&#39;s<br/>
&gt; house (she later took her mom&#39;s name, Martinez, to blend in in Espanola<br/>
&gt; better), we got &quot;files,&quot; and the school was warned to watch us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It didn&#39;t take much in those cold-war days.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tessa&#39;s family did go to Cuba every summer to pick coffee or cut cane or<br/>
&gt; something.  And so we were consorting with the friends of the enemy.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; For those that think the &quot;grandfather&quot; clause is anything more than a big<br/>
&gt; pile of what a bull leaves behind, check your history books to see if any<br/>
&gt; law with a grandfather clause has ever lapses when it was suppose to be<br/>
&gt; grandfathered out!  AND, contrary to all the hot air the politicians are<br/>
&gt; pushing out, all parts of that new law do NOT have a grandfather clause.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Don&#39;t you mean a &quot;sunset&quot; clause?   &quot;Grandfather&quot;  usually involves exceptions<br/>
to a  new policy or new law based on already existing situations or grandfather<br/>
was allowed to own land, or keep livestock before area zoned,<br/>
or..................<br/>
