 </span></blockquote>Now see, I didn&#39;t know that!  That is good to know.  My grandma <br/>
designed her own house and actually had that drawer put in (it was <br/>
beneath the stove top, not up high).  I just thought it seemed kind <br/>
of messy -- but was fun.  The flour didn&#39;t all stay in the drawer <br/>
when you opened and closed.  I don&#39;t know that it had a metal <br/>
liner.  I can&#39;t remember her cleaning it out either. Just put more <br/>
flour on top.  She was famous for baking about 100 pies on a weekend <br/>
for her church bazarre, and people ordered them ahead of time.  The <br/>
pies often exploded in the oven, and she just kind of scraped that <br/>
off and put in another pie!  My dad had to put in a couple different <br/>
ovens over the years.  We lived with her for three years, and she <br/>
did vacuum occasionally (she insisted on wool carpets, because the <br/>
stains came out better she thought -- and I think she replaced <br/>
carpets maybe 3-4 times in 20 years) as I recall, but I don&#39;t <br/>
remember much in the way of dusting or deep scrubbing or anything.  <br/>
Kitchen floor pretty dirty most of the time.  We never got sick or <br/>
anything, still don&#39;t, so maybe she enhanced our immunity!  She was <br/>
pretty uninterested in housework, I think.  She was more likely to <br/>
be in the garden or making something in the kitchen sink.  All the <br/>
hobbies she had seemed pretty messy.  It&#39;s the same with my mom, <br/>
though my mom is tidier and how her house looks is more important to <br/>
her when guests come over.  I don&#39;t think my grandma was as <br/>
concerned about what other people thought really.  My own <br/>
housekeeping style is not great.  I struggle with it, though, as I <br/>
would actually like a cleaner house.  I&#39;m just not willing to take <br/>
that much time away from things I am actually interested in.  I <br/>
figure if I am cleaning house, I am not doing other things.  The <br/>
thing is, if you are not naturally neat, and have not developed <br/>
tidiness habits, you don&#39;t tend to put things in their place and <br/>
clean up after yourself the minute you do something.  You wait until <br/>
the mess is huge, and then it seems like too much of an undetaking.  <br/>
I have watched people with clean houses, and I know they put <br/>
everything back right after they are done.  And everything has a <br/>
proper place.  They also wipe down the table and get right to the <br/>
dishes.  They don&#39;t leave one in the sink.  That, to me, takes an <br/>
entirely different type of personality than I was born with or would <br/>
take the time to develop.  So, I suffer with messiness around me.  I <br/>
also don&#39;t have things set up in the house to make it easier.  Where <br/>
things are changes depending on when I was using them last!<br/>
