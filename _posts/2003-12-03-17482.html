<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260503763">I have been asked to sit on a panel for a homeschool support group meeting.<br/>
The panel will consist of people who use various styles to homeschool,<br/>
school-at-home, unit studies, eclectic, and me.  The audience will consist<br/>
of primarily &quot;Christians who homeschool for religious reasons/who believe in<br/>
wifely submission/who control all aspects of their children&#39;s lives.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is set up for a few minutes presentation by each panelist followed by<br/>
questions.  I am pretty good at being able to frame things in such a way as<br/>
to not sound accusatory but would appreciate any wisdom from others.  I<br/>
thought it was just such a wonderful thing that an unschooler was even asked<br/>
to participate at this meeting that I want to go to the trouble of placing<br/>
myself in harm&#39;s way as it were.<br/>

<br/>
Hostile crowds can be rough, and a hostile rest-of-panel is a possibility too.<br/>
<br/>
I would prepare some pre-written statements that could act as time-release <br/>
thought-changing packets.  Something non-offensive but profound.  And try to get <br/>
them out there at some point.   Things like maybe &quot;Many families find that as <br/>
they relax about expectations, children meet them anyway.&quot;  or &quot;Without the <br/>
freedom to choose, they can&#39;t choose to be good.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263518727">Wow, I don&#39;t envy that opportunity.<br/>
Do you think it would help to start by citing success stories you know and<br/>
then back tracking to &quot;how they got to be so great &quot;.?    By success of<br/>
course I mean your definition - harmonious families, independent kids,<br/>
strong happy teenagers, or maybe moms who homeschool without burnout.<br/>
Doubtless the attenders are going to come with lots of different ideas about<br/>
what they are trying to accomplish by homeschooling.  Clarity about what you<br/>
consider successful homeschooling will help people understand where you are<br/>
coming from.<br/>

There&#39;s a parenting book,  &quot;Whole Child, Whole Parent&quot; by Polly Berends,<br/>
and it has a chapter on freedom where you might be able to find something<br/>
helpful.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a spiritual book so what you find there shouldn&#39;t offend any of your<br/>
listeners. <br/>

Good idea.  <br/>
<br/>
She quotes the Bible, but she quotes other religious works too.<br/>
<br/>
I love that book.<br/>
