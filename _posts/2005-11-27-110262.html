If there  wasn&#39;t a bedtime for adults only a bedtime for children I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t go  there in the first place. I doubt we&#39;d go to stay in most <br/>
peoples houses  though, too many illogical rules. <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m guessing  from my experiences that grandparents, for the most part, <br/>
aren&#39;t used to having  lots of people in their home and the loudness (even if to us <br/>
it&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; and  not really loud at all) and all the extra activity is <br/>
enough for them to want a  quiet, not moving around time near the time they go to <br/>
sleep.<br/>
 <br/>
I spent years dodging around the rules of the grandparents, but only the  <br/>
things that were easy and respectful, not making them eat those horrible bright  <br/>
red honnee weenees &quot;that ALL kids love&quot; was not going to happen.<br/>
 <br/>
When it became more of an issue, we got a hotel, that helped ease a lot of  <br/>
times with grandparents.  They weren&#39;t constantly bombarded with all kinds  of <br/>
stimulation and activity that they weren&#39;t used to (no matter how normal or  <br/>
exemplary we think it is).  <br/>
 <br/>
EVERYONE got a break and we were able to come together for meals or other  <br/>
activities that made things much more pleasant for everyone.<br/>
 <br/>
I also found that IF you aren&#39;t actually &quot;living&quot; in their house but merely  <br/>
there for one activity or the other (such as a shared meal or visiting time)  <br/>
grandparents are way less likely to feel they can demand certain things from <br/>
the  children.<br/>
 <br/>
That won&#39;t solve all the worlds ill tempered grandparents and just  downright <br/>
think they know best ones either, but it will help to make things a  bit more <br/>
peaceful and the children almost always have a much much better  time.  <br/>
Hotels are an adventure all in themselves, so having to &quot;put up with  the old <br/>
people&quot; if that&#39;s how it is, seems much better in a lot of ways.<br/>
