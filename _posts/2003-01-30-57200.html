&gt; Well the thing here witht he noise is not really being a bother to my<br/>
&gt; husband. He spends a lot of time on the phone, and it&#39;s his clients that<br/>
&gt; would be bothered by it. Not sure it will sound very professional.<br/>
&gt; He will definitely have another business line and we would be putting the<br/>
&gt; &quot;office&quot; in our bedroom. That&#39;s really the only place for it. The<br/>
&gt; office/library/computer room is all open and not an option. We really have<br/>
&gt; no other room on our house. The bedroom is plenty big enough for it. We<br/>
&gt; would just have to take out the couch that&#39;s in there now. Thing is, our<br/>
&gt; bedroom is right by the playroom and other bathroom and at the end of the<br/>
&gt; hall. (there goes those soccer games again!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You might be able to do some additional soundproofing between your bedroom<br/>
and the rest of the house. Can you trade out the playroom with a bedroom<br/>
(even if it&#39;s smaller) so the playroom noise is further away?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know what to do about the soccer games. &lt;g&gt; Maybe your dh and kids can<br/>
reach an agreement to have a set soccer game in the hall every day during<br/>
&quot;lunch hour&quot; ;)<br/>
