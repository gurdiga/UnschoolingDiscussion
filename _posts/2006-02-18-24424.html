The link is to humorous commentary by this guy:<br/>

It&#39;s interesting, it&#39;s anti-unschooling, but in a light way.  There  <br/>
seems to be no way to leave a comment.  And what&#39;s even more  <br/>
interesting, the article is nearly a week old and no one mentioned it  <br/>
before. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29521902">My mom told me yesterday that she saw the CNN piece on unschooling.  I read <br/>
the blurb on-line, but can&#39;t find a link to viewing it.  Does anyone know of <br/>
one?<br/>
<br/>
She thought it was a negative piece because the kids slept until 11:00 and <br/>
didn&#39;t get dressed right away after they did get up.<br/>
<br/>
From the link just sent:<br/>
&quot;Besides, I would think anyone allowed to get up at 11 and do whatever he or <br/>
she wanted every day would have it pretty tough when it came time to get a <br/>
job. The world can only use so many newspaper reporters.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny that my mom also grabbed onto that detail - the &quot;sleeping in&quot; - <br/>
since she was a nurse and spent the majority of her career working <br/>
non-nine-to-five hours, including plenty of night shifts!<br/>
<br/>
My husband, who is not anti-unschooling but not totally there either, also <br/>
complains that the kids should get up earlier.  I guess it&#39;s because of the <br/>
myth that people who get up earlier get more done in their waking hours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866350029">Sorry for the mysterious link, I often e-mail on the fly.  I didn&#39;t find it humorous but laughable and uninformed.  You can comment on his blog, which I did and encourage others to do.  The piece is from a regional version of the less prestigous of the Boston newspapers, so it&#39;s not surprising that few people saw it.  I also have a link to the original network piece if anyone missed it and is interested.<br/>

 2. on the right side, midway down the page is a section titled<br/>
	WATCH VIDEO (in red)<br/>
 3. use the pulldown menu next to Select and find &quot;Education&quot;<br/>
 4. then on that list you will see &quot;The &#39;unschooling&#39; movement<br/>
