&gt;That&#39;s a great answer that really hits home with me... I was reading all the<br/>

&gt;will be a thing of the past and not important at all.... Afterall reading a<br/>
&gt;book doesn&#39;t in anyway prepare you for the realities of life.  Life skills<br/>
&gt;and living are far more important in a job... Of course I also believe that<br/>
&gt;working for oneself is the only way to go in life and I know many of you<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t believe that, for whatever reason.  I think that now I live outside the<br/>

out there have many zero requirement/zero prerequisite programs.  I&#39;m a <br/>
graduate of The Evergreen State College in WA, I never took a lick of <br/>
math.  Same for Reed in Oregon and I believe for Hampshire in MA.<br/>
And remember, the great majority of the children we are raising are going <br/>
to get their jobs through INTERNSHIPS, not college degrees (since <br/>
internships train you specifically for the job as you need the skills, <br/>
where as it takes a Masters degree to have a professional career these <br/>
days) and they will aquire the skills specific to the job&#39;s the love.  If <br/>
they happen to be in love with a math field job, chances are they will <br/>
ALREADY have aquired the math they need for the job.  Grace Lewellyn goes <br/>
into this a bit in The Teenage Liberation handbook :)<br/>

We&#39;ve got to give kids independent time right away because that is the key <br/>
to self-knowledge, and we must re-involve them with the real world as fast <br/>
as possible so that the independent time can be spent on something other <br/>
than more abstraction. This is an emergency, it requires drastic action to <br/>
correct - our children are dying like flies in schooling, good schooling or <br/>
bad schooling, it&#39;s all the same. Irrelevant.</div>

&lt;&lt;  I ended up dropping all my classes that sememster because I <br/>
 was working and then became pg. My point is that even though your <br/>
 child may not be interested in the higher math now the time will come <br/>
 when they will need to know it and they will learn it out of desire <br/>
 to move on. Not because they are told they have to or because they <br/>
 are told that life will not be the same without it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
well that sounds like the way it is here too... as far as colleges are <br/>
concerned... you have to pass a basic skills test in order to be able to take <br/>
college math/english... so if you fail the math part, you are put in remedial <br/>
classes for 0 credit until you can pass the basic skills again... problem <br/>
with that is...it&#39;s costly and time consuming... but you&#39;re right... if you <br/>
need it, if you want it, you&#39;ll get it ... by hook or crook... <br/>
<br/>
one of my biggest contentions with traditional schooling is the shoving of <br/>
math in every orifice to kids whether their ready or not... and that applies <br/>
to reading too... and i guess all subjects for that matter... i think it&#39;s <br/>
stifling to education... that&#39;s one of the primary reasons i am homeschooling <br/>
my daughter next year...</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think I have an answer for this one. When I was in high school I <br/>
&gt;  didn&#39;t get past intro to algebra. In fact I didn&#39;t even understand <br/>
&gt;  what it was that they &quot;taught&quot; me in intro to algebra. I took that <br/>
&gt;  class my sophomore year and was able to get out of taking math the <br/>
&gt;  remainder of my high school years by taking Cosmotology my Jr and Sr <br/>
&gt;  years. When I took math in college, about 4 years after I graduated, <br/>
&gt;  I was placed in the lowest level of math (3 levels below college <br/>
&gt;  credit algebra). What is interesting is that the whole sememster I <br/>
&gt;  spent the class doing the assignment that was given at the start of <br/>
&gt;  class and due the next class. I almost never listened to what was <br/>
&gt;  said. I just did the math. I think that part of my problem in high <br/>
&gt;  school is that I wasn&#39;t mature enough to understand what was being <br/>
&gt;  taught. The equations just didn&#39;t click. I also didn&#39;t understand <br/>
&gt;  what algebra had to do with me and my life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like this post and can relate both as a &#39;drop-out&#39; and as a homeschooling <br/>
parent.<br/>
<br/>
My experience is a little different.  In Jr. High I challenged the 7th grade <br/>
math class as being too elementary for me.  I&#39;d already been exposed to the <br/>
material presented in the 7th grade text and insisted they find me an <br/>
appropriate class to attend.  (I still chuckle about the whole thing because <br/>
I really set the whole school district on their ear with this one!  They were <br/>
not willing to think outside the little box they put me in and I wasn&#39;t <br/>
willing to stay in my little box like a good little girl...heheheh)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I finally told them I&#39;d be willing to take the end of year final.   <br/>
If I passed, they could put me into the 8th grade class (pre-algebra) and if <br/>
I didn&#39;t pass, I&#39;d willingly attend the 7th grade class for the rest of the <br/>
year.  (kinda sad that as a 12 yr old I had to give the adults a solution).  <br/>
They were certain I couldn&#39;t do it and accepted the challenge.  So, I was the <br/>
first 7th grader to attend the pre-algebra class in that school district.  <br/>
<br/>
Did fine in algebra courses, but when I got to geometry, I could not get it.  <br/>
Now, it didn&#39;t help that the local jr. high didn&#39;t teach geometry, but <br/>
required a math class in 9th grade.  So, they bussed me to the local high <br/>
school for geometry.  The schedule was such that I arrived at class late and <br/>
had no opportunity to discuss the materials with the teacher before I had to <br/>
be back on the bus and back to the jr. high.<br/>
<br/>
I dropped out of high school in my sophomore year.  Got my GED at age 20.<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward 20 years.  I decided I wanted to go to college and the major I <br/>
was interested in involved heavy math and science.   When I tested, I had to <br/>
take a remedial class before I was ready for the college level courses in <br/>
math.  Once I got over the personal &#39;humiliation&#39; and got started in the <br/>
class I loved it!  I discovered that I had not understood the algebra classes <br/>
I had taken as a teen, in spite of my straight &#39;A&#39; status.  I aced the <br/>
remedial class and went on to more college math with continued success.  When <br/>
I got to Trig and Geometry, I had no trouble understanding the concepts.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I just needed a bit of maturity and better opportunities to thrive in <br/>
the math classes.  I&#39;ve been told by more than one professor that I seem to <br/>
have an instinctive ability/talent.  I love it!  (a bit of a brag here, if <br/>
you&#39;ll excuse me...when we moved and I had to withdraw from science courses <br/>
because of the distance, my science teacher strongly encouraged me to make a <br/>
point of returning to college/science.  She cried that I was leaving.  <br/>
&lt;smiles&gt;  That felt good, but isn&#39;t the point.  Thanks for my moment to <br/>
publicly pat myself on the back...&lt;bg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
So, when the math is needed and the desire is there, it will be learned!  <br/>
Relax.<br/>
<br/>
(yeah, I realize I appear to be &#39;forked-tongue-ed&#39; on this one, since I use a <br/>
math textbook.  BG  But the point is still the same, relax and do what is <br/>
best for you and your child.)<br/>
