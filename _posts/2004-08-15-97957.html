over and over, and I have to say I am in awe of the patience that some <br/>
wonderful list members have in discussing these ideas over and over again <br/>

Parents WOULD justify it that way, if they defined peace as freedom from <br/>

The news? <br/>
Oh... that they would want to watch.<br/>
<br/>
They rarely watch the news.  I get tired of the barrage of dead baby stories. <br/>
 Babies have always died, but I shouldn&#39;t have to have more stories than of <br/>
the actual women I know whose babies have died.  Not every family in the state <br/>
and lots from other places.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The goal of the list isn&#39;t peace. Nor is the goal to provide a forum for<br/>
anyone to say anything they want. The goal of the list is useful unschooling<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s implied when someone signs on a list that the list owners will supply<br/>
what the list says it&#39;s about. People don&#39;t want to sign onto a list about<br/>
cats and have endless debates about dogs, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
This is a large list and has been going for over 5 years. The list has been<br/>
derailed into useless debates that don&#39;t help anyone unschool countless<br/>
times. Understanding the common factors that caused those derailments helped<br/>
us come up with the list rules. When someone posts in a way that violates<br/>
the rules then their post is sent back so they can revise it.<br/>
<br/>
And the list has been *much* more useful for people who want unschooling<br/>
information since the rules were implemented nearly a year ago.<br/>
<br/>
While it would be satisfying for those involved in a disagreement to be able<br/>
to hammer out every disagreement they have on the list, members expect the<br/>
list to be about unschooling and trust the list to supply that. For those<br/>
who didn&#39;t experience the nonunschooling debates that stretched on for<br/>
several days and filled up people&#39;s boxes with hundreds of emails, it isn&#39;t<br/>
fair to second guess why the list is run as it is.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to continue a debate on another list, they&#39;re free to<br/>
create one and announce it here.<br/>

<br/>
Since I read Fast Food Nation, I have some images in my mind about the <br/>
meat processing industry.  I wouldn&#39;t share them here because:<br/>
<br/>
a) they aren&#39;t likely to help anyone unschool more happily or more <br/>
effectively<br/>
<br/>
b) they are stomach turning, and I know from experience that some people <br/>
read the list while eating their breakfast or while nursing their <br/>
babies/toddlers.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this list is not to persuade people to stop eating beef, <br/>
even if some posters would like to accomplish that goal. <br/>
<br/>
[linking up to another part of this discussion]<br/>
<br/>
I think the &quot;where do you draw the line&quot; question is too vague to <br/>
successfully answer, unless it is narrowed down to be more specific.  <br/>
Generally we find hypothetical abstract discussions are not particulary <br/>
helpful to parents reading here.  This list is intended to help parents <br/>
deal with specific situations they are facing by sharing specific <br/>
suggestions based on experience.<br/>
<br/>
**Censorship is engaged in on this site.<br/>
Many members are unaware of rebuttals being refused and that some<br/>

<br/>
Anyone who has been on this list long enough to have gone through some <br/>
long flame-wars, some of them off-topic, is aware that the list <br/>
converted from being an unmoderated list to a moderated one.  This was <br/>
openly discussed at the time, and can be found in the archives. I <br/>
understand that the purpose of moderating the list is to prevent <br/>
disruptive, off-topic discussion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872675401">***Censorship is engaged in on this site. ***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not censorship.  It&#39;s a list you can join or leave at your choosing<br/>
and it exists for the purpose of discussing unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a secret that this is a moderated list.  <br/>
There are posting policies to keep the list focused on unschooling and to<br/>
keep it helpful.   This is from the list posting policies:<br/>
<br/>
~&quot;Our goal is to make the list as useful as possible for those seeking to<br/>
deepen their understanding of the unschooling philosophy. To do that, all<br/>
new list members are initially moderated to prevent spamming and catch<br/>
posts<br/>
that could disrupt the list. People will also be moderated if they<br/>
disrupt<br/>
the usefulness of the list. Potentially disruptive posts will be returned<br/>
for revision.&quot;~<br/>
<br/>
Every single person who joins the list gets a copy of the posting<br/>
policies.  They are in the files section of the group&#39;s home page.  They<br/>
have been posted to the list on several occasions over the last year.  <br/>
<br/>
***Many members are unaware of rebuttals being refused***<br/>
<br/>
Rebuttals are not refused unless they conflict with posting policies. <br/>
It&#39;s ok to disagree on this list.  It&#39;s not ok to get personal or stinky.<br/>
  That&#39;s in the posting policy too.   Stick to discussing the ideas being<br/>
expressed, not the list, not the posters.   Rebut all you want and be<br/>
prepared to be questioned about your position.  It&#39;s pretty simple.<br/>
<br/>
***and that some posts have portions deleted without the author&#39;s prior<br/>
consent. ***<br/>
<br/>
You are mistaken.    No post has ever been altered or edited by a<br/>
moderator.   Any change to a post is done by the author even if it is<br/>
just to trim extraneous text.   Sometimes a poster will include an entire<br/>
digest in their reply, or quote entire posts when they&#39;re only responding<br/>
to one or two ideas.  We don&#39;t even trim the extraneous text, we&#39;ll<br/>
return a post to the author to do that.   As far as I know there is no<br/>
feature at Yahoo that would allow anyone to edit or alter a post from<br/>
someone else.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has not happened to you personally but you&#39;re so sure it happened <br/>
that you post it on the list as a fact? Now we get to spend list time <br/>
explaining, again, the actual list policies and how we moderate.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the facts:<br/>
<br/>
Only new people or those who have been disruptive in the past are <br/>
moderated. People are taken off moderation when they&#39;ve posted a while <br/>
and are clearly going to contribute to the list, not obstruct its <br/>
purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Moderators either approve posts or send them back to the person - we <br/>
don&#39;t edit them, ever. NEVER has a post had portions deleted by us, <br/>
with OR without the author&#39;s consent. We sometimes suggest to the <br/>
poster that they delete something and repost - it is up to them to do <br/>
it or not.<br/>
<br/>
Rebuttals are not &quot;refused.&quot; And I think that is evident from what you <br/>
do see on the list.<br/>
Some people have trouble distinguishing between disagreement with an <br/>
idea versus attacking an individual - those posts are returned with an <br/>
explanation.<br/>
Some people have trouble getting quickly back to unschooling when the <br/>
topic veers away - we are fairly lenient on that - we usually suggest <br/>
it on the list and wait for it to go back, but at some point we&#39;ll <br/>
start sending them back and ask people to return to unschooling <br/>
discussion.<br/>
Sometimes people continue to belabor a point with dozens of emails, one <br/>
after another,<br/>
<br/>
We USE our posting guidelines extensively - we often refer to which <br/>
posting policy is being violated when we return their post. Please read <br/>
them if you&#39;re wondering what kind of moderating happens on this list. <br/>
No secrets - up front and as clear as we can manage.<br/>

<br/>
-=- Censorship is engaged in on this site. -=-<br/>
<br/>
No, it is not.   Go and read about censorship and what it means.  You have <br/>
the freedom to form a discussion list and have as many or as few rules as you <br/>
want.  Go do it.<br/>
<br/>
You have the freedom to publish a newspaper or magazine.<br/>
You do not have the freedom to force someone else&#39;s newspaper or magazine to <br/>
publish what you write.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Many members are unaware of rebuttals being refused and that some <br/>
<br/>
posts have portions deleted without the author&#39;s prior consent. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Wrong.<br/>
Either a post is returned to the author, or it is let through.  People aren&#39;t <br/>
editing posts.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Certainly this disavows any claim to freedom of choice and freedom of <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Very incorrect.  Your knowledge of freedom of choice and freedom of speech is <br/>
very limited.<br/>
<br/>
No one forced you to be here, and no one is preventing you from publishing or <br/>
offering a discussion forum of your own.  If you choose to publish, no one <br/>
will force you to publish what you would rather not.  If you start a bulletin <br/>
board or yahoogroup, no one will force you to let people post whatever they want <br/>
regardless of your original intent.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This has not happened to me personally. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Nor have they happened to others, and so you should not have made the claim.<br/>
<br/>
I was gone all day with Marty and Holly, we had a great time, and I&#39;m sorry <br/>
to come back to nonsense.  Maybe other moderators or list owners have already <br/>
responded, but at the risk of being redundant, you can go to yahoogroups.com <br/>
and read the description and policies of this group, or you can read them here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/info">http://sandradodd.com/lists/info</a><br/>
<br/>
which exists because it can be reached with a click, unlike the files <br/>
attached to home pages of yahoogroups.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have read those policies, either stay on the list and regard them, <br/>
or send an e-mail to <br/>
