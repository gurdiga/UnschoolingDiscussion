<br/>
i think the hardest part would be getting a job and a client base.  as a society<br/>
we really rely on those &#39;pieces of paper&#39; to help us evaluate the quality of the<br/>
persons knowledge in the field in which we are hiring them.<br/>

<br/>
The peice of paper only tells us the person has jumped through the hoops<br/>
and passed a test, not the quality of their knowledge.  So, it tells us<br/>
something, but not much.<br/>
<br/>
My Mom attended Nurses Training in the 50&#39;s.  It really was an<br/>
apprenticeship - they worked in the hospital right from the beginning and<br/>
until graduation.  Those who didn&#39;t like it dropped out the first year. <br/>
Now in most college programs, you don&#39;t do your practical experience<br/>
until junior or senior year.  If you find you don&#39;t really like the work,<br/>
you&#39;ve already got so much invested it&#39;s difficult to change paths.<br/>
<br/>
Her training was free - she received a stipend in exchange for the work,<br/>
had to live in the dorm, and students weren&#39;t allowed to marry.<br/>

Snowflakes are on of nature&#39;s most fragile things,<br/>
but just look at what they can do<br/>
when they stick together.<br/>
