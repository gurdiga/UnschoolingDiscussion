<div id="ygrps-yiv-895741147">Hi Randy<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list. You asked:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  How<br/>
&gt; *does* one know if our children are developing and learning as they should?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It certainly is a question I have asked, and worried over. But after a while I<br/>
realised that there were other questions I had to answer first.<br/>
<br/>
The number one thing, IMO, is to decide how you would like your child to develop<br/>
and what you want your child to learn. That sounds obvious, but it wasn&#39;t to me.<br/>
I took my 5yo out of school after 7 weeks, knowing it wasn&#39;t right for us, but<br/>
for years struggled with different ways to teach / get him to learn the same<br/>
sort of things school taught - and worried as to whether he was &lt;developing and<br/>
learning as they should&gt;. Which, of course, meant that what I was reading  - and<br/>
believing - about unschooling wasn&#39;t happening because I always had this agenda<br/>
of having him &#39;develop and learn as he should&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been 13 1/2 years now. My son has a job and has left home and is doing<br/>
fine. I have 3 more sons (16,12,9) and I still struggle with the &#39;shoulds&#39;, even<br/>
though my &#39;shoulds&#39; have changed. I still catch myself worrying about math,<br/>
science, writing, reading, even though I tried to banish them to the bottom of<br/>
my list a long time ago.<br/>
<br/>
An example. Reading. I have worried about it for years. #1 learned to read at 9<br/>
1/2.  #2 learned at 8 1/2. I worried a lot, in spite of all the reading I had<br/>
done on this subject. #4 learned at 4. I thought I&#39;d come to terms with it. All<br/>
3 of them learned pretty quickly once they started. They really do learn when<br/>
they&#39;re ready. I stopped worrying about the shoulds of development and learning.<br/>
I thought. #3 finally learned to read just before he was 12. He still hates it.<br/>
He&#39;s still not reading as well as a 12 yo &#39;should&#39;. He doesn&#39;t want to read. He<br/>
won&#39;t read. I really wish I had never found out what he &#39;should&#39; be able to do.<br/>
He IS making progress, and that&#39;s what I &#39;should&#39; focus on.<br/>
<br/>
Now if you think about it and decide that you want your kids to be &#39;average&#39; or<br/>
better in ordinary old school subjects, and it is important for you to know,<br/>
then go get them tested. Then you&#39;ll know. But remember that once you know what<br/>
they &#39;should&#39; be able to do, and where they stand in relation to that standard,<br/>
your relationship is changed. Inevitably. Irrevocably.<br/>
<br/>
 We feel that values/feeling states like responsibility, self-esteem, happiness,<br/>
honesty etc. are more important than traditional subjects like math, science<br/>
etc.  By testing, and gaining that knowledge we have damaged his self esteem,<br/>
and our relationship. Not lots, I hope, but a little. Yes, I would like him to<br/>
read better, but I already knew from observation that he was improving. And IMO<br/>
any parent can see by observation if their child is learning. I believe that if<br/>
they are progressing, and are getting the encouragement they need then they are<br/>
developing and learning as they should. Why bother about what the average or<br/>
norm is? I feel I failed my son by testing his reading just because I gave in to<br/>
conditioning and worried about whether he was developing and learning as he<br/>
&#39;should&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am just saying that we were very concerned when we started this process<br/>
&gt; several years ago about how we would know that our children would be able to<br/>
&gt; compete in the next century with their peers from around the world.  So we<br/>
&gt; educated ourselves about what *they* say our children ought to know.  And we<br/>
&gt; have kept a close eye to make sure that our children are measuring up or<br/>
&gt; exceeding these standards educationally.  This gives us a certain level of<br/>
&gt; comfort we that we felt we needed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A while back our then Minister of Education here in New Zealand made a statement<br/>
about ensuring that all children were up to average! I laughed at this, of<br/>
course, but it did make me think. It seems like all of us want our children to<br/>
be average or better. That, of course, is an impossibility. So setting that<br/>
expectation, is setting at least some children up for failure. So I thought,<br/>
what&#39;s the answer? The answer for me is to make sure that I put their self<br/>
esteem and happiness before academic achievement. That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t<br/>
think it&#39;s important for them to learn to write, compute etc. It&#39;s just not the<br/>
be all and end all, and not even near the top of my list (except when I slip<br/>
back into the old conditioning).<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long - this subject has been / is one of my hardest battles<br/>
with myself!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616383762">I appreciate your post and your sharing and I agree with you mostly on the<br/>
testing thing.  I am not concerned about how my children compare to other<br/>
children academically.  I am concerned about how they are doing in relation<br/>
to how I think they can do, and how all that plays into their self-esteem.<br/>
Testing just seems like a way to compare children to each other just so<br/>
&quot;they&quot; can say whether a particular child passes or fails at something.  We<br/>
do not believe too much in failure around here and we certainly do not<br/>
subject our children to this kind of comparisons.  We do use questions and<br/>
reviews which could be called tests I suppose.  But these are only for us to<br/>
know how to help our children in areas we think might be important.  They<br/>
look forward to them as learning opportunities because they know there is no<br/>
negative stigma associated with them (no grades or pass or fail nonsense).<br/>
And while love and approval and many other important fundamentals play an<br/>
important role in a child&#39;s self-esteem, we think achievement does also.<br/>

has been criticized for this.  There&#39;s even a social club at the <br/>

Dh&#39;s brother is a diesel mechanic.  School was not fun for him!<br/>
Now,  he has his own very successful <br/>
business and can take apart and fix any kind of engine.  Still,  he <br/>
often struggles with feeling inferior because of the way society <br/>
views him.  He wasn&#39;t successful in school and it haunts him.<br/>
It&#39;s so sad that something so unsuccessful as public education is <br/>
society&#39;s measuring stick.<br/>

     I agree with so much of your post!  The whole concept of &quot;competing&quot; <br/>
bothers me because inherent in it is the fact that some will have to be <br/>
assessed as inferior for others to be average or superior.  Also, I feel that <br/>
many of our societies are too focused on competing rather than working <br/>

person who used to be in fire protection when he was in the Air Force and now <br/>
is a tile setter.  He can do almost anything related to construction and is <br/>
planning to build our home next year.  Yet I used to feel that he was kind of <br/>
lacking because he didn&#39;t share my more &quot;intellectual&quot; interests. (I am <br/>
embarrassed to admit it but it&#39;s the truth.)  My kids each have their own <br/>
interests and apptitudes as well.  All of us find certain interests we share, <br/>
which makes it nice, but I have stopped trying to make my kids and husband <br/>
have all of my interests.<br/>
     There are so many skills that are necessary for a society.  Yet many of <br/>
us want it to be someone else&#39;s kids who grow up to: put up drywall, lay <br/>
tile, deliver mail, maintain and repair autos, cut hair, etc.  This way of <br/>
thinking seems exploitive to me.  We do want SOMEONE to do these things <br/>
because they are badly needed.  But if we don&#39;t value these jobs and think of <br/>
them as undesireable, it seems like we are using these people.  Does this <br/>
make any sense?  <br/>

&lt;&lt; It seems like all of us want our children to<br/>
 be average or better. That, of course, is an impossibility. So setting that<br/>
 expectation, is setting at least some children up for failure. So I thought,<br/>
 what&#39;s the answer? The answer for me is to make sure that I put their self<br/>
 esteem and happiness before academic achievement. That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t<br/>
 think it&#39;s important for them to learn to write, compute etc. It&#39;s just not <br/>
the<br/>
 be all and end all, and not even near the top of my list (except when I slip<br/>
 back into the old conditioning). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I was thinking of all this recently as I watched my talented son draw. He <br/>
can read well, he can write but hates too and struggles with it. For now <br/>
basic math is a challenge but he likes and does well in geometry. His passion <br/>
though for now is drawing. I was afraid he had lost this when he was in <br/>
school. There was so little time for him to follow his desires that his <br/>
artistic talent which is one of his greatest assets was being pushed aside. <br/>
He was becoming convinced he was a failure because he couldn&#39;t do some of the <br/>
school stuff as fast as others. The shame of it was that few of his school <br/>
mates has his talent for drawing. His talent did not show at school, but his <br/>
failure did and was affecting all of him.<br/>
    So do I let him follow his desires or do I cram multiplication at him?  <br/>
How hard this is when I have been conditioned to believe there is ONE right <br/>
way. So I take two steps forward and one back again. I may get there yet.LOL<br/>

We need to take this discussion out of just our unschooling world, but into<br/>
the homeschooling world and beyond.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tired of meeting homeschoolers who think I&#39;m trying to outschool the<br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
A mom and her 14 year old son sat in my home today.  Mom thought I was going<br/>
to come into her home and homeschool her son for her...... she never really<br/>
recovered from the shock that that wasn&#39;t going to happen, but her son..<br/>
eeewwww boy. That child caught a whiff of something different and by the<br/>
time he left my house he was thinking at the speed of light.  He wants to be<br/>
a mechanic, and here I was talking about physics and cultural changes that<br/>
came about because of the assembly line and computer technology and what he<br/>
needed to be open to as he matured.  And how not cowing down to all those<br/>
powers that be who tried to force him to just *do the work* would be the<br/>
most important thing he&#39;s ever done.  When I talked about how strong he must<br/>
be to resists all that crap (although I didn&#39;t use that word today) from all<br/>
those adults last year, he got it.  When I told him that if he could<br/>
remember what it felt like to hold his ground during that time and show his<br/>
future children how to do that, we&#39;d get out of this mess we&#39;re in where<br/>
kids are killing each other at school.  Boy did he get that one.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if ya&#39;ll just keep typing your hearts out about these matters, we&#39;ll<br/>
build a resource that&#39;ll help change the world.  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055917274">What you say is so true, Lisa.   My dd&#39;s passion is animals--mostly horses <br/>
and dogs, but anything that lives will do.  She and a friend did a <br/>
project--figuring how much is would cost to care for a horse for a year--they <br/>
figured out one time costs(tack, barn, fencing, the horse etc), and ongoing <br/>
costs ( feed, vet, farrier, etc). they compared costs of local tack and feed <br/>
shops and mail-order catalogs.  They averaged feed costs. They were amazing!!!<br/>
  Sarah(my 11 yo dd) got her own dog last year. She was a rescue dog from the <br/>
SPCA and was afraid of everything. she hid her food. she backed out of rooms. <br/>
She cried when she was touched. She was afraid of her collar and leash. she <br/>
was quite literally afraid of her own shadow. In the beginning Sarah hand fed <br/>
her until she&#39;d eat on her own, she slept with her until she was able to <br/>
sleep on her own(attachment dog parenting!!). In 4H Sarah took the dog <br/>
obedience project with her dog, and they place first in their class at the <br/>
county fair.  Sarah can tell you everything she has learned about Tibetan <br/>
Terriers(her dog&#39;s breed), she can tell you what she has found to be <br/>
effective in working with abused animals(we have 3 SPCA dogs).  She has had <br/>
the time to explore her passion and to live it.  Sarah and her dog are a <br/>
testiment to the power of unconditional love, and to the time to just *be*.  <br/>
 Now she and her friend are learning about dog agility--measuring and setting <br/>
us agility courses, etc.    *This* is relevant learning<br/>

animals and I nurture her passions as well. I , too, think that the time we<br/>
