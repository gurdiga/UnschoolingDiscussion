This is what I&#39;ve done. I ran Casey&#39;s Brownie troop with all homeschoolers <br/>
and this year we&#39;re forming a new Jr. Girl Scout troop with a mix of kids. <br/>
We have a meeting in the very beginning and I ask them what they&#39;d like to <br/>
have happen with the troop. When it was just little 6 year old Brownies, I <br/>
asked kind of general questions like would they like crafts at meetings, <br/>
lots of time to run around, games, field trips...? I&#39;m sure now that I&#39;ll <br/>
have an older troop of girls, they&#39;ll be able to help plan the actual <br/>
activities even more.<br/>

I guess if I couldn&#39;t be a leader for Casey&#39;s troop, then I&#39;d just be a big <br/>
mouth in whatever troop she was in. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;d try to help when I could and get <br/>
my ideas in there when possible. I&#39;d also play it meeting by meeting, <br/>
leaving it open for Casey to stop if she didn&#39;t like it anymore. Just doing <br/>
the badges at home as an individual member can be fun too. Casey did that <br/>
for her last year of Brownies.<br/>

Three of my sons did that last year with Boy Scounts. We couldn&#39;t get to meetings so we did the badges at home.They had great fun - and weren&#39;t looking for extra socal contact so didn&#39;t miss the group things...Leonie W. <br/>

couldn&#39;t care less about doing the badges &lt;g&gt; It helps that her leader is<br/>
an unschooling mom.... and to be honest, a lot of the badge stuff looks<br/>
kind of dippy.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re fine with girl scouts because it is an inclusive group, and the<br/>
policies against homophobia and religious discrimination are clearly<br/>
spelled-out. My daughter, at least, wouldn&#39;t have participated otherwise.<br/>
This isn&#39;t true of boy scouts, though...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My dd is the same way.  Her leader is a homeschooler and knows we are <br/>
unschoolers and is very relaxed about what the girls do.  They can <br/>
work on badges on their own and present what they&#39;ve done to get the <br/>
patch, or not.  They also do some group badges that usually take the <br/>
year to complete.  <br/>
My dd worked on one on her own and I kinda nudged her through it.  <br/>
She was glad she did it, but has never worked on another one.<br/>
We both felt that there was fun stuff to do to get the badge, but <br/>
some pretty &quot;dippy&quot; stuff too.<br/>
