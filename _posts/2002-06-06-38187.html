I don&#39;t have any idea how old your kids are, but your suggestion of leaving<br/>
when they are asked to leave seems fairly reasonable to me.  Would it be<br/>
possible to compromise a bit more -- perhaps feeding the kids before the<br/>
parade, so that you could spend an hour or so with them, and then go back<br/>
down to the party, assuming they are old enough to be left in the room alone<br/>
to sleep?  Most adult parties tend to go long enough that you wouldn&#39;t miss<br/>
it all if you left and came back.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, if your children are too little to be left alone, someone is<br/>
going to have to stay with them, and you would be the natural choice rather<br/>
than your husband, since it&#39;s his father&#39;s party.  (Or maybe spending a<br/>
night on a sofa bed at a fancy hotel would thrill your kid&#39;s favorite<br/>
babysitter.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, they are not.  I have in-law problems sometimes, and I try, when<br/>
possible, to take a deep breath and consider whether I care enough about<br/>
*this* (and only this) issue enough to make a fuss.  If so, there&#39;s nothing<br/>
wrong with standing against it.  However, sometimes it&#39;s worth going along<br/>
with an idea I&#39;m not crazy about for the sake of family peace.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts.<br/>
