<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000146143">Linda, they don&#39;t have quite that rigid philosophy at Sunbridge College as<br/>
they are trying to bring it to kids in the ps system and are doing it<br/>
successfully in the inner city so I would imagine hschoolers could<br/>
incorporate some of what they do understand and can relate to (or spend<br/>
money trying to find someone to teach it!) The ps teacher trainer was a<br/>
trained Eurythmy teacher who decided to bring this way of learning to the ps<br/>
school they had the funding for it in the inner city and apparently it has<br/>
made a big difference there. I think Detroit but I could be wrong. I forgot<br/>
her name and the city but they were also doing it also in Manhattan but can<br/>
try and find my notes. It was a real eye opener as to how music and rhythm<br/>
and movement can be used to develop the mind and body at the same time. Even<br/>
though it was obvious that her training was quite extensive it seemed to me<br/>
that anyone with a music, movement or dance background could really pick up<br/>
on it and use it with their children. Even on the most elementary level. I<br/>
dabbled in all the Waldorf stuff they taught esp. storytelling and painting<br/>
so I didn&#39;t pay as much attention but the songs I learned from that<br/>
wonderful teacher are still in my brain.<br/>
The concepts of integrating the whole person to teach or learn are<br/>
fascinating to me. When I went to college @Lesley Graduate school I did<br/>
study Integrating the Arts into the Curriculum. It has always been important<br/>
to me. It certainly doesn&#39;t have to be limited to a Waldorf subject such as<br/>
Eurythmy. Mara&#39;s example just reminded me of what I had seen/experienced<br/>
when I was there. Are there any Eurythmy teachers who would work with<br/>
hschoolers to your knowledge? I am sure they are in high demand.<br/>

wanted to follow a waldorf education at home that I would go with what<br/>
Live!Education is offering instead of Oak Meadow.  I hadn&#39;t seen what they<br/>
were doing as Emma hadn&#39;t been interested in any structure and we&#39;ve let her<br/>
pursue her own interests mostly.  She is such a strong, creative and<br/>
imaginative child.  I feel that those early years with a strong waldorf base<br/>
is what really contributed to all this in her.<br/>
