<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851418536">Well, I&#39;m finally caught up with my e-mail. It took me 4 days. I just love <br/>
this list.<br/>
I was delighted to see Sandra Dodd on the list. Sandra, if you&#39;re reading <br/>
this, I just want you to know that you introduced me to the idea of <br/>
unschooling. I had just made the decision to homeschool my children and I <br/>
read an article that you wrote in HEM.<br/>
It was titled &quot;An Interview with Sandra Dodd&quot;.It was in the Jan./Feb. 1998 <br/>
issue.<br/>
I know this because I made a copy of the article (it was a library mag.) and <br/>
hung it on my frig. so I could read it often (which I did). It was a source <br/>
of encouragement to me. I especially liked when you said &quot;Try not to learn. <br/>
Don&#39;t try to learn&quot;. <br/>
I really believe that we learn some of the most important things in life just <br/>
by talking to people and sharing our lives with others.<br/>
I have enjoyed reading EVERYONE&#39;S posts. Keep posting, everyone!<br/>
Mary Ellen.</div>

Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Wow.  A photo of me.  On someone&#39;s refrigerator, somewhere.  (Where is your <br/>
refrigerator?)   Oh, and words too.  My words, on someone&#39;s refrigerator.  <br/>
*Sigh...*<br/>
<br/>
That makes me feel really cool.  I think I&#39;ll go prance around my yard and <br/>
water trees or pull weeds or something with this happy-dance energy.<br/>

much the same way. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
Thanks from here too Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
I just got home from my dd&#39;s end of the year awards ceremonies, where I<br/>
answerred many interested parents&#39; questions regarding our plans for next<br/>
year. I could kick myself for ranting a bit about the lack of notice given<br/>
for events like this, bla bla bla. I did manage to talk a little about<br/>
homeschooling though~more confidently than I expected.<br/>
<br/>
When I arrived home , however, I just collapsed into a ball of angst. I<br/>
can&#39;t believe how terrified I am, and didn&#39;t even realize it until today!<br/>
We&#39;ve done this before-so why am I turning myself in knots?<br/>
Lack of support? Sure, but we&#39;ve always had that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know. I do know that I came running to the computer, intending to<br/>
read about unschooling/homeschooling until&#39; my eyes fall out today.<br/>
Well, that or take a nap. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 What you did girl, was run to the puter for support!!  Hey, that&#39;s what the <br/>
list is for, yes?  You just wait, by the end of the day you will be up and at <br/>
em!  There are sooooo many cool things to do, and you don&#39;t have to do <br/>
anything!  Except, I have to go collect my caterpillars before the birds get <br/>
them,  I am bound and determined to have the boys see this butterfly process, <br/>
somehow we killed the last pillars we had, so sad!  But, that is all I HAVE <br/>
to do and they will enjoy and learn.  <br/>
Smile, take a nap and enjoy!<br/>

Thanks Teresa.<br/>

Hey, We have two caterpillars outside on the parsely of all things.<br/>
<br/>
That might not sound strange at first, but when you consider that we lined<br/>
the entire fence with &quot;Butterfly Attracting&quot; plants , well.......<br/>

equipped with three pillars.  We were so excited, brought them in, put them <br/>

died, just flat died!  I was more upset then the boys.  So now we start <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-197453085">I&#39;ve had the same luck (or lack of it) with frogs:  we bought a cute little <br/>
habitat called &quot;surf frogs&quot; (had a surf board, little beach hut...). Got the <br/>
tadpoles (2) , they started turning into frogs (actually came out of the <br/>
water) then they died... Each of them did this at different times, so I know <br/>
it wasn&#39;t a disease or something...<br/>
Heck the last tadpole survived the car trip from Indy to NH (16 hours)...we <br/>
stayed at a hotel, and in the morning we cked on it and it sprouted front <br/>
legs overnight!<br/>
