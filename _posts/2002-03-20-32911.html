<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141540166">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve started a new group called eTribe.  Here&#39;s the <br/>
intro & subscription link. (hope it highlights the link)<br/>
<br/>
Are you an attachment-style parent or unschooler who <br/>
doesn�t want to be limited by those labels?  Are you <br/>
doing your best & still falling short of your values?  <br/>
Do you struggle with balancing your ideals with the <br/>
challenges of real life?  We need to heal our own <br/>
unbondedness; we need role models; we need support; we <br/>
need our tribe!  This list is for parents at any stage <br/>
of the game (including pregnancy.)  If you�re <br/>
interested in any of the following as it applies to the <br/>
family please share your thoughts & experience with <br/>
us:  Homeschooling, Unschooling, Breastfeeding, <br/>
Extended Breastfeeding, Baby-wearing, Co-sleeping, <br/>
Vegetarianism, Veganism, Raw-Foodism, Homebirth, <br/>
Unassisted Pregnancy & Childbirth, Non-violence, <br/>
Alternative/Natural Healthcare, Self-sufficiency...<br/>
