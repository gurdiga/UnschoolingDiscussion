&lt;&lt; How did you make reading available to your boys to<br/>
learn on their own?  I know you had a more than subtle<br/>
influence!!   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Y&#39;know, I&#39;m not Helen, but they publish a magazine out of their house, pretty <br/>
much, and so words are flowing in and out, and not just fluff-words, either, <br/>
but life-altering words.  How could those boys NOT have reading available?  <br/>
And is that a subtle influence or is that an overwhelming flood of &quot;reading&quot; <br/>
in which others are paying money to share?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My seven year old is<br/>
not reading yet.  He understands how it is supposed to<br/>
work, but it just isn&#39;t fun for him.  He doesn&#39;t even<br/>
want to read directions for things that he wants to<br/>
make! yet. He seems so resistant,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let him be seven.  Pressuring him in any overt or subtle way will make it <br/>
more and more un-fun for him until the point that he could resist reading <br/>
forever.<br/>
<br/>
I was with Holly at tryouts for a musical.  That&#39;s not a lower-class ignorant <br/>
environment; we weren&#39;t at a biker pool hall.   A perfectly normal looking <br/>
grown white male said to the women he was talking to, &quot;I don&#39;t read anything <br/>
I don&#39;t have to read.&quot;  He meant it.<br/>
<br/>
There are some very bad things school does.  One is make reading a chore, a <br/>
chance for failure, something you can do late, or wrong, or badly.   If moms <br/>
aren&#39;t careful, they can reproduce that result at home.  Don&#39;t.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Sandra.....thanks for the warning.  My home is<br/>
filled with words, too.  Though I don&#39;t produce a<br/>
periodical.  Books are everywhere...My older boys read<br/>
so young, as did I (4), of, anyway......I did need<br/>
reasurrance that everything is fine.  Roy really<br/>
enjoys the interaction of being read to. I escape into<br/>
literature, he has no desire to escape. He has such a<br/>
large oral vocabulary that I expected him to just be<br/>
reading too ( the subtle influence you mentioned. <br/>
I&#39;ll try to not be too pushy while still making print<br/>
available......which it is.  Lots of it!!  He does<br/>
write messages to friends and relatives, and has the<br/>
rudiments.  I&#39;m sure the joy of reading will blossom,<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
It is good to hear of others experiences.  Now I&#39;m not<br/>
in such a vacuum.<br/>

<br/>
I understand.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re used to reading first, and then vocabulary learned (we think, we have <br/>
been told) from reading.<br/>
<br/>
Kids can learn all KINDS of fancy language from the air, from talking with <br/>
adults, from watching movies.<br/>
<br/>
Forty years ago kids were NOT talking with adults or watching movies.  Kids&#39; <br/>
books were awful, crummy line drawings or badly-colored sketches (even in <br/>
science books photos were rare), and now children are surrounded by cassette <br/>
tapes of all KINDS of stuff, videos, news shows with great color video (not <br/>
just a guy sitting reading AP wire stories to a camera, as much of what we <br/>
saw as kids was)--<br/>
<br/>
Reading is not as crucial now as it used to be.  It is neither the only nor <br/>
the best way to get information of many kinds.  Reading Newsweek and Time <br/>
involve a goodly amount of reading the photos and maps and charts.  <br/>
<br/>
Because school didn&#39;t praise those skills and give us high marks for <br/>
reporting what we SAW on the news or what we learned orally from parents on <br/>
the way to school (must be in a newspaper or magazine, or from some <br/>
ten-year-old library book to be &quot;real&quot;), we tend to forget ourselves <br/>
(speaking for myself and other moms this has come up with) how huge the flow <br/>
of information is that our kids are swimming in!<br/>

learning in First Grade was that handwriting was too hard and that he<br/>
didn&#39;t like math.  (Prior to that he had been enthusiastic about both math<br/>
and using a pencil.)  This is the kind of stuff that I think schools and<br/>
imitations of school methods are best and teaching.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-569860160">Dear Sandra<br/>
You present some interesting points of view. Thanks.<br/>
It is refreshing to look at things from a slightly<br/>
different perspective.  <br/>
<br/>
However sometimes this highlights for me just how<br/>
isolated my child and I have actually been. I&#39;m afraid<br/>
I&#39;m guilty of having been a bit of a hermit for quite<br/>
a while.  As a result we have been able to (mostly)<br/>
avoid the huge swamp of media madness. We subscribe to<br/>
several periodicals, several book clubs, visit the<br/>
local library at least weekly, watch the local and<br/>
national news (with a large dose of salt) two or three<br/>
times/wk, and write to friends and relatives. Once or<br/>
twice a year we see some of the relatives.....my older<br/>
sons more frequently. I have belonged to some other<br/>
lists of personal interest which relieved that<br/>
(voluntary) isolation, somewhat.  Now there is this<br/>
lovely list. <br/>
<br/>
But we don&#39;t receive Time or Newsweek, nor do we &quot;go<br/>
out&quot; socially.  It just isn&#39;t available, here.  No, my<br/>
youngest one&#39;s verbal skills have been learned at<br/>
home. <br/>
<br/>
He is growing at a different pace than his older<br/>
(adult) brothers, and as you and others have<br/>
suggested, I just need to let him develop at his own<br/>
speed.  Which is perfect for him.....and me!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, Sharon<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I must have missed this message somehow, and just caught it here on <br/>
Sandra&#39;s wise reply. We &quot;made reading available&quot; simply by always <br/>
having lots of stuff around to read, which we&#39;d have done whether we <br/>
had kids or not because we&#39;re both reading addicts. And we never <br/>
really went out of our way to have children&#39;s books or <br/>
age-appropriate books for the kids - although we definitely had lots <br/>
of them, everything from Dr. Seuss to those Disney movie tie-in <br/>
books, and probably every &quot;Little Golden Book&quot; ever published, and <br/>
entire sets of classics, kid-type encyclopedia sets, etc. But those <br/>
are interesting to me, too, which seems like a good standard for <br/>
whether or not to have a book around. A couple of weeks ago I read <br/>
two supposedly children&#39;s books in one night, both biographical <br/>
fiction, those &quot;diaries kept by pioneer children&quot; type books, because <br/>
they were well-written and quite interesting.<br/>
<br/>
We just always assumed the kids would read pretty much the same books <br/>
we did, only until they got old enough to actually read them they&#39;d <br/>
just look at the pictures. Which they did. They&#39;d always ask us about <br/>
photos and drawings and artwork that interested them, and we&#39;d either <br/>
explain what it was, or read the caption or a bit of text about it. <br/>
Around here, books never had that weird &quot;mystique&quot; some people seem <br/>
to associate with them. They were just another tool, like a hammer or <br/>
the computer, and the kids used them with ever-increasing skill and <br/>
understanding.<br/>
<br/>
One thing we did have lots of - and which probably helped them all <br/>
learn to read - was books on tape. Not just the little storybook/tape <br/>
sets, although we had dozens of those, but audiobooks on a vast range <br/>
of subjects. We have hundreds of them now, with their own <br/>
floor-to-ceiling bookcase, and the favorites have had their cardboard <br/>
cases taped back together numerous times. For us, our frequent road <br/>
trips were just good reasons to buy more audiobooks!<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, daughter Jody (21) was looking for a book on <br/>
herbs just yesterday, combing the bookcases here by my desk, and at <br/>
one point she stopped and thanked me for having so many good books <br/>
around, saying that it was like having her own private library to <br/>
come to when she wanted to know something. Yeah.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
The contents of your home seem similar to mine.<br/>
<br/>
Excepting the audio-books.  In a past life, I worked<br/>
with blind people, and we used LOTS of audio<br/>
materials. I do have a few audio books, and have had<br/>
more, which I have passed along to my daughter-in-law,<br/>
perhaps I should have kept them. I get them for my<br/>
husband in his authors and subject matter. Ones that I<br/>
have listened to (in the car..alone...everyone else<br/>
likes other stuff) that seem to be of no interest to<br/>
anyone else, I&#39;ve donated to the library.  Where as<br/>
printed books I can barely bear to part with! Though I<br/>
have passed many along to my adult children and my own<br/>
siblings. Books are truly gifts from my heart. My<br/>
husband wants me to clear out my friends and advisors<br/>
(books)as they seem to be so much clutter to him.  And<br/>
I have been culling some. Perhaps that is a subtle<br/>
GENDER RELATED negative influence?  Train of thought<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m going to mull this over a bit.....I suspect there<br/>
is more of this sort of background noise. <br/>

words.  And I would write things down for them to copy.  I&#39;d put sticky notes <br/>
with names of things on them and they&#39;d stick them on the things for fun when <br/>
they were little. Kind of a rearranging game.  Holly likes flashcards <br/>
sometimes, for a little while, sorting those she can sight read from those <br/>
she has to sound out.  But she does it with other stuff too--signs as we <br/>
drive or whatever, just reading out the words she can sight read.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just gradual and treated like a fun thing.  Just like recognizing birds <br/>
or different breeds of dogs, or different neighborhoods or towns (is this <br/>
still  Nob Hill?  where does Fairview start?).  It&#39;s categorizing and naming, <br/>
as lots of other things are.<br/>

since birth, reading Dr. Seuss and Golden books constantly.  I tried <br/>
phonics flash cards, too, but she just wasn&#39;t interested in reading <br/>
for herself.  She did love to hear me read, so I read all the little <br/>
house books, the Mary Poppins series, Caddie Woodlawn, the Wizard of <br/>
Oz series out loud to her.  The neighbors got a kick out of seeing us <br/>
in the back yard in the summer, me reading out loud and Kate in the <br/>
pool, running to see the occassional picture.  Then last summer we <br/>
started Harry Potter.  We BOTH loved the books and would read until my <br/>
voice gave out.  It seemed like every chapter left you hanging!  She <br/>
finally took over and began to read so I could have a rest.  First it <br/>
was a few paragraphs with prompting help when she got stuck.  Then it <br/>
extended to pages and finally she could read just about anything she <br/>
wanted to, including signs and emails (over my shoulder!) and any <br/>
children&#39;s books, directions to get (Absolutely Free!!) stuff through <br/>
the mail.  Once she started, she couldn&#39;t be stopped.  I guess it just <br/>
takes something they really are interested in to get them going...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Cheryl --<br/>
<br/>
My son learned to read last year.  When he seemed ready to me we used the<br/>
first set of Bob books.  He was able to read the first two, very slowly,<br/>
but with satisfaction.  After that we used the Between the Lions TV show. <br/>
(It was on 5 mornings a week, so I just kept turning the TV on and<br/>
sometimes he would wander past and enjoy it  I also taped some episdes and<br/>
played them when he asked for them.  We also used a couple other phonics<br/>
shows taped off of PBS.)  He read a lot of road signs, as his reading<br/>
capabilities developed.  He was really focused on that for many weeks. <br/>
Either before or after we got the Bob books, he invented a game with his<br/>
Pokemon poster where he would read the first three letters and I would have<br/>
to guess which Pokemon it was.  This whole game was his idea.  (OK, it was<br/>
my idea to hang up the poster that had names and pictures paired together.)<br/>
 He also played the spelling game on the Arthur&#39;s reading race CD, but he<br/>
mostly used the &quot;cheat&quot; feature on it.  Still, it was exposure to spelling.<br/>

The path for every kid will be different.  The materials that each kid may<br/>
like to work with may be different.  My kid didn&#39;t like books much at the<br/>
pre-school stage, so memorizing Hop on Pop and learning from that (which<br/>
seems like such a natural method) wasn&#39;t gonna happen for us.<br/>

wanted to, including signs and emails (over my shoulder!) &gt;&gt;<br/>

Yes, THERE is the true test of reading, if a kid can silently read over your <br/>
shoulder quickly enough before you close the instant message that they can <br/>
quote it back to you and ask what you were talking about.  eeek!<br/>
<br/>
My oldest two can DEFINITELY read now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For all of you who have always unschooled your kids, I&#39;m curious about the <br/>
&gt; mechanics of how they learned to read. Did they pick it up on their own <br/>
&gt; from <br/>
&gt; having watched and listened to you, or did you use some sort of program <br/>
&gt; when <br/>
&gt; they indicated that they were ready? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Cheryl,<br/>
<br/>
Lelia, my daughter picked it up on her own pretty m uch. . . we did not use <br/>
any program, but just read out loud, and it just came to her. . .just by <br/>
being immersed in it I suppose.<br/>
<br/>

My life has been a turmoil lately.  Anyway...this post hit my button because <br/>
my SIL was just here talking about her 7 yo boy over the weekend.  He&#39;s very <br/>
bright, but not in the &quot;school-defined way&quot; (her words) and he&#39;s naturally <br/>
adept at Math.  But she was telling me how he has learned to &quot;hate&quot; Math <br/>
because it has become synonomous(sp?) with &quot;timed test.&quot;  Turns out this <br/>
teacher is having the kids take timed addition and subtraction tests with the <br/>
goal of getting 30 correct in one minute.  At first grade????  I was <br/>
incredulous!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-531805089">Just adding to Helen&#39;s great reply.  Most of you probably already do this, <br/>
but one way we&#39;ve made reading available to our kids is to put reading <br/>
material in the bathroom.  We just got three boxes of old National Geographic <br/>
magazines from a library giveaway and my 12 yob (who is not an avid reader of <br/>
anything else except farming mags) will lock himself in the bathroom for an <br/>
hour at a time.  Of course, this is sometime inconvenient for others, but <br/>
hey, he&#39;s reading and getting that pre-teen &quot;privacy time&quot; at the same time!<br/>
