Thanks very much for the reminder!  We have always unschooled here in our house.  One daughter age nearly 12.  With September coming up somehow in her mind she has started thinking *school* though we&#39;ve never done that here!!  She says, maybe I need a curriculum....AAAhhgghhh!!!  She does see school children at some of her activities and I am thinking that somehow the school mentality, energy is seeping into her ideas...what else could it be?  A few of these children are going to private schools, skipped grades and are in *gifted* classes.  Alot of the conversation is spent on trying to understand how my dd can possibly learn anything!  Anyway, Joel thanks for the reminder of why the heck we&#39;re doing this.<br/>

&gt; I think it is a potential way of extinguishing the love of learning which is<br/>
&gt; at the heart of<br/>
&gt; unschooling.  Pointing out the educational aspects of something is confused to<br/>
&gt; begin with as is<br/>
&gt; pointed out below i.e.  everything is educational.  The setting of<br/>
&gt; &quot;educational&quot; priorities is<br/>
&gt; something that the learner and the world, interacting together establish.<br/>
&gt; obedience to authority is one of the main underpinnings of our consumer<br/>
&gt; /consuming society. </span></blockquote></div>
