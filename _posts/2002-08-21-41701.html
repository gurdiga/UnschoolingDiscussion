&lt;&lt; I would love any thoughts and comments on the value of video <br/>
games from you all. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Among other things (you might search the archives of this list, or of <br/>
www.unschooling.com, for discussions), please read this by Kathy Ward:<br/>

Kathy and her husband and children were Christian fundamentalist (at a very <br/>
cultlike level at one time) and they went from allowing VERY little to giving <br/>
their kids free reign to choose their own music, friends, entertainment, <br/>
hobbies, etc.  So read her opinions in light of that change of lifestyle and <br/>
belief.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that Dan and Jocelyn Vilter will put up some of their information on <br/>
video games soon, and I&#39;ll let you know when that&#39;s online to read.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you for sending this, Sandra. I read this, and Mary&#39;s article and the article with Dr Deutsch on the TCS sites. I think they will be very helpful for my dh, who worries about the time our boys spend playing computer games...I kind of feel that it ( the effect of these electronic attractions)  really depends on what we bring to the meduim - TV, vidoes,  computer games and so on - in our house these seem to  stimulate a lot of discussion and  debate and lead to many issues and follow ups and connections ...Leonie<br/>
