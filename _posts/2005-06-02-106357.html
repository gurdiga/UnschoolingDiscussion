<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459248418">Sophie is the baby (two years old) where Holly&#39;s staying.   This is the end <br/>
of an IM we had going for a while.  I thought for those who  wonder how it is <br/>
with 13 year old girls being far away, this might be  soothing.  Tam is Tam <br/>
King, who&#39;s 15 and  I was her transportation for  a dance recital mid-day today; <br/>
she and her youngest brother, Malcolm, who&#39;s 11,  are here.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
SandraDodd:  Tam did a flash cartoon but I don&#39;t have the  address for it <br/>
yet.  She&#39;s doing some kind of correspondence school and is  doing that as a <br/>
project.<br/>
HollyLynnDodd: <br/>
oh that&#39;s cool, are they  still over there?<br/>
HollyLynnDodd:  I&#39;m tired I think I&#39;ll go  sleep pretty soon here<br/>
HollyLynnDodd:  i&#39;m &#39;tard *is what Sophie  says*<br/>
SandraDodd:  Okay<br/>
SandraDodd:  Yeah.  Kirby and some  guys just left, but Tam and Malcolm are <br/>
still here<br/>
SandraDodd:  Vincent went with his mom to  Santa Fe and then they were going <br/>
to stop by Albuquerque Academy, where he&#39;s  going to school next year for <br/>
sure.  :-/<br/>
HollyLynnDodd:  what guys? can you name  them?<br/>
SandraDodd:  He&#39;d rather do Prep, but his  dad wants the other.<br/>
HollyLynnDodd:  not sandia prep? hhow  sad<br/>
SandraDodd:  Dylan<br/>
Cameron<br/>
Kirby<br/>
<br/>
are going to meet<br/>
Marty, Ryan  and Leif at<br/>
Fuddrucker&#39;s at coronado<br/>
HollyLynnDodd:  thank you, it makes me feel  good knowing those kind of <br/>
things... I&#39;m not sure why<br/>
SandraDodd:  Same reason it helps me to  know where you are and what you <br/>
bought and where you sat in the bus, I  guess.<br/>
HollyLynnDodd:  yeah, prolly<br/>
HollyLynnDodd:  good night<br/>
SandraDodd:  Good Night!  I love  you.<br/>
HollyLynnDodd:  i&#39;m going to go sleep in my  bed that&#39;s right by Jazzy&#39;s and <br/>
right near all my stuff and pretty nice and  cozey. <br/>
HollyLynnDodd:  Love you  too<br/>

having a great time?  How do you feel?  I look forward to times when my sons <br/>
venture further out in the world but I fear it too.<br/>

-=-I would never know you were so far apart. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
I love IM and e-mail.  And failing those, she has been loaned a  phone for <br/>
the duration of her stay and compared to any other time in the  history of the <br/>
world, transatlantic calls are cheap.  IM is cheaper, and  I can save it.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 -=-Is she having a great time?-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Seems to be.  I&#39;m documenting lots of it here:<br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/england_">http://sandradodd.com/england_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/england)">http://sandradodd.com/england)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
  -=-How do you feel?-=-<br/>
 <br/>
At first I really missed her.  I&#39;m still restless and I walk into  her room <br/>
and look around, feed her rats, look out her window, wonder what  she&#39;s doing.<br/>
 <br/>
A couple of times I&#39;ve been jealous, but I&#39;m having a good time here,  <br/>
getting tons of cool stuff done in the yard, hanging out with Marty and Kirby  more <br/>
than I would if Holly were here, and having a good time with Keith.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m super happy for her to be having this experience, though.  It  will give <br/>
a big boost to her thinking in all kinds of areas--language,  geography, <br/>
history, interpersonals, art, architecture, parenting, the  difference between <br/>
herself at home and herself out and about (if any, and in  what ways she might <br/>
have perceived differences).  She&#39;ll never forget and  these things will be part <br/>
of her view of herself and the world as long as  she lives.  Very, very cool.<br/>
 <br/>
It might be rough when she gets back.  She could be angsty,  frustrated, <br/>
feeling smaller, missing things, being exhausted and not  recognizing it.  Or she <br/>
could be none of that, and just slip right back  into her Albuquerque days and <br/>
ways.  Every weekday all summer they serve  free lunch in the park near here <br/>
(lots of city parks).  She&#39;ll probably  go and develop a routine there, catch <br/>
up with some of her summer friends, meet  the lunch lady, see who&#39;s got new <br/>
puppies they&#39;re bringing, etc.  She&#39;ll  play a lot of Halo 2 to make up for lost <br/>
time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-221204805">I&#39;m glad friends of ours decided to move to England and have enough room to  <br/>
host Holly!  We lucked out.  <br/>
 <br/>
The first time I went to England it was to stay with a family I knew from  <br/>
Albuquerque, too.  The dad was a folksinging friend of mine, who was also  one <br/>
of my English profs and he went to Cambridge for a sabbatical to research  Ben <br/>
Jonson and had a house and said I could come visit.  I said &quot;I&#39;m going  to.&quot;  <br/>
He said, &quot;I believe you will!&quot;   I was in my mid twenties,  borrowed money <br/>
against my meagre teacher&#39;s salary, and went that summer.   Took a year to pay it <br/>
off, but it was worth it.<br/>
 <br/>
Without a house and friends to go to, I would&#39;ve had no idea how to go  about <br/>
it and could&#39;ve probably only stayed a really short while.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve got the same luck. My aunt is married to an Italian an lives in<br/>
Italy. I visted her twice when I was in my twenties.<br/>
<br/>
Almost all my traveling happened during my twenties and I always tied<br/>
my trips to people I knew who lived there. To me, the best way to<br/>
really get to know a place is through living in someone&#39;s home (not<br/>
staying in hotels, though if you have to, you have to).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I was in my mid twenties,  borrowed money <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; against my meagre teacher&#39;s salary, and went that summer.   Took a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>year to pay it <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; off, but it was worth it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are taking our family of seven to Italy this summer to stay with my<br/>
aunt&#39;s family. We decided three years ago that even if we couldn&#39;t<br/>
save enough, we&#39;d put the rest on a Visa and pay it off over time. I<br/>
knew that if we let money stop us, we&#39;d regret it years later. The<br/>
amazing thing for us (and we do not earn very much) is that once we<br/>
put our minds to saving, we not only saved alot but people who love us<br/>
in our family donated to the cause.<br/>
<br/>
We leave for an 18 day trip to Italy on July 2.<br/>
<br/>
This is the most money we&#39;ve ever spent on education. &lt;g&gt; Better than<br/>
college.<br/>

<br/>
So...<br/>
Y&#39;gonna keep a website or a blog of this thing? &lt;g&gt;  Then we can  all <br/>
vicariously peek at Italy and a big family experience.<br/>
 <br/>
(If you want to spend all your time being right there instead of  documenting <br/>
it, I&#39;ll totally and entirely understand.)<br/>
