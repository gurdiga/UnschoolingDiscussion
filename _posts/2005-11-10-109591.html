<div id="ygrps-yiv-175665243"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; -=-Reading is a code that needs to be decifered.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. <br/>
And only the reader can decipher it.<br/>
<br/>
Does spelling matter?   Would word history help?<br/>
<br/>
Cipher is from the Arabic word for zero, and has been in English for a long, <br/>
long time.   &quot;To cipher,&quot; meaning to do arithmetic, is a word even my <br/>
grandfather used, who was born in 1898 and lived in Texas.   But why a &quot;ph&quot; and not an <br/>
&quot;f&quot;?   Because it came through Greek.   Some Greek mathematician discovered <br/>
the idea from Arabic, wrote it down in Greek, and it came to other European <br/>
languages from that.   &quot;Ph&quot; words in English are always from Greek.<br/>
<br/>
To decipher something (like reading) means to figure out the patterns.<br/>
<br/>
A parent cannot decipher words for a child.   Only the child can decipher <br/>
written language.   You can help!   You can help LOTS of ways.   One way would be <br/>
to gain an interest in the words you use yourself, and stop once in a while <br/>
to examine one, its history, why it means what it means.   <br/>
<br/>
Holly wrote before she could read too, and she cared about spellings and the <br/>
easiest way to explain to her why some spellings seem screwy was to tell her <br/>
WHY they were that way.    &quot;Two,&quot; for example, has a &quot;w&quot; because it was long <br/>
pronounced.    Still old folks in Scotland and ballad lyrics will sometimes have <br/>
&quot;twa&quot; and those who like Shakespeare will know &quot;in twain&quot; (as Gertrude&#39;s <br/>
heart is broken, for example, or rather cleft--a little rougher than just broken, <br/>
and related to &quot;cliff&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Other &quot;two&quot; words where the &quot;tw&quot; sound remains include <br/>
twins<br/>
twine<br/>
between (in the middle of two)<br/>
twixt (same meaning)<br/>
twenty<br/>
twelve (OLD word we can&#39;t take down into parts anymore, but two-and-ten, <br/>
somehow, since before English was even a language)<br/>
twilight (two lights)<br/>
<br/>
Playing with words makes them come to life.<br/>
<br/>
The history of England, of math, of writing, of counting... all clued above <br/>
and in all the histories of words.   Any portal into the universe is as real as <br/>
any other.   If an interest in language or butterflies or patterns or water <br/>
creates connections for that person to anything else in the world, that can <br/>
lead to EVERYTHING else in the world.<br/>
<br/>
A parent cannot decipher the whole world for her child, but she can help him <br/>
begin to decipher it.<br/>

Twa-/twi- can also mean cut, too, though, so maybe halflight.    The half and <br/>
half of day and night, though.   Between day and night.    <br/>
