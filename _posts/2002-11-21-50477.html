 </span></blockquote>My children had a &#39;throwing rocks through windows&#39; stage of learning. They<br/>
learned to be more careful and take better aim so the rock would actually<br/>
make it to the pond via the air rather than the glass. We also had the<br/>
melting candles on the carpet experience. So.............they again learned<br/>
to be more careful. Now the &#39;parent led relaxed schooling&#39; people would tag<br/>
that math and science I guess. We just call it living. Is the window<br/>
expensive to replace? Yes. But what does that have to do with anything? It<br/>
was an accident. Life is filled with lots of things including accidents.<br/>
Last month my husband was playing with the kids and guess what? He threw a<br/>
football and you guessed it....glass shattered. I guess this was HIS math<br/>
lesson for the day........he learned how many feet from the roof that window<br/>
really was!<br/>
<br/>
My point: it is a misconception to think that parents of unschoolers<br/>
typically hide their heads in the sand while their children intentionally<br/>
cause harm to themselves, to others or to &#39;things&#39;.<br/>
