<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155396727">When I was(still am) with my life mate, we called them because of his son <br/>
was beaten with a belt,(by his mom), my daughter had been finger painting <br/>
nude (she was at that time 9 months) and had blue green purple paint on her, <br/>
while the lady was there, all she did was look at her and when I finally <br/>
asked why she said &quot;I am looking at the MARKINGS on her&quot; I said &quot;she has <br/>
been finger painting&quot;, and she said &quot;What in the nude?&quot; I said &quot;oh you do <br/>
that too?&quot; she said &quot;I don&#39;t have children, but if I did, they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
paint in the nude!&quot; and then I said &quot;How sorry for you!!&quot; I am ok with <br/>
nudity, in our family and when mine were small they were always naked, my 7 <br/>
yo dh takes her shirt off in the summer because at this age she and can get <br/>
away with (no boobs yet), so this whole article really made me glad I live <br/>
in a small town and most of our neighbors know us. (At time of painting <br/>
issue we lived in Houston TX, now we live in In).<br/>
Tami<br/>
<br/>
P.S. In case you are wondering, we did get a protective custody of my LM <br/>
son, but the judge overturned it because we were not married, so I guess in <br/>
his eyes it was ok to beat a child, but not to live with the one you <br/>
love!?!? I have yet to figure out mainstream society!!!<br/>

Just in the interest of looking from a different angle........it is possible the<br/>
&quot;observer&quot;  was not so much upset by the sight of a naked toddler but rather not<br/>
quite sure how to react to seeing unknown naked toddler being chased by unknown<br/>
adolescent male.<br/>
