<div id="ygrps-yiv-740863482">I forgot I wanted to tell you guys that my friend did decide make the  big <br/>
splurge and take her son to London for the Led Zeppelin concert.  Isn&#39;t  that <br/>
cool?!<br/>
 <br/>
Funny other thing though, when she read the advice I sent her she also  saw <br/>
the posts about the gun, and instantly messaged me asking if Sam  still needed <br/>
one.  Turns out that same son has a big  collection of them.  So, the <br/>
connection was there but I just didn&#39;t  think to make it.<br/>
 <br/>
So, just so we don&#39;t miss out on another valuable connection by not  asking <br/>
-- anybody happen to have any ideas of other fun things to  do in London with a <br/>
15-year old weapon-collecting Led Zeppelin fan?<br/>

  The Tower of London houses an armory which is awesome. It also houses the Crown Jewels, and not too mention the gory history of the place. Well worth a visit.<br/>
