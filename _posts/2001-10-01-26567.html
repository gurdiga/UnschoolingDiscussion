&gt; Does anyone know of a kid-safe cat repellant?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, We call ours &quot;the dog&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, though, it&#39;s hard to convince stray cats to stay away. Get rid of<br/>
the dirt area and get a covered sandbox, try some of the &quot;off&quot; type spray<br/>
you can get at the pet supply stores (which never impressed the strays in<br/>
our neighborhood, but maybe impresses some). I have also *heard* of a sort<br/>
of automatic sprinkler system that is a motion detector (the water goes off<br/>
for just a minute or so), but have never met one personally, which would<br/>
work great.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a fan of stray cats, who can carry disease, including rabies. Live<br/>
animal traps are available for borrowing at some humane societies, and you<br/>
can then turn in trap-and-cat and check out another one and repeat the<br/>
process until they&#39;re gone.<br/>
