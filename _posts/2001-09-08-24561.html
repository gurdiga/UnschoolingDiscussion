Can unschooling be structured?<br/>
<br/>
                    It depends on what you mean by structure. Imposing<br/>
external structure<br/>
                    onto the learner, by specifying materials and<br/>
methods, is not unschooling.<br/>
                    A person creating structure to suit his or her own<br/>
purpose, that is<br/>
                    unschooling. Some people are by nature methodical,<br/>
and we want our<br/>
                    children to respect and work with their own internal<br/>
rhythms. Our job as<br/>
                    parent is to help them create what they need. For<br/>
example, it is entirely<br/>
                    possible that one child will learn everything in a<br/>
more relaxed, free<br/>
                    flowing way, except for one sucject- perhaps history.<br/>
With history that<br/>
                    child may want a time line and a access to materials<br/>
in chronological<br/>
                    order. If it works for the child and is created at<br/>
the behest of the child,<br/>
                    then structured, methodical learning is also<br/>
unschooling. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771698414">I don&#39;t feel like going back to look at the old posts.  I think I read them<br/>
all, but correct me if I&#39;m wrong, because I have a hard time remembering who<br/>
said what.  Did you say that you have a certain amount of time when your<br/>
kids have to do certain things?  With the understanding that they can choose<br/>
exactly how to fufill those requirements?  If so, *I* do not consider that<br/>
unschooling, and I don&#39;t think the passage quoted from unschooling.com backs<br/>
it up either.  If a child said, &quot;I really want to become a better writer.<br/>
Can you help me get on some sort of a schedule so I can practice?&quot; and the<br/>
parent put a system of time to be spent writing in place, that would be<br/>
unschooling.  If a parent says, &quot;My child needs practice writing.  I will<br/>
set aside some time, but they can write whatever they want.&quot; that would not<br/>
be unschooling.  There are many people on this list who don&#39;t believe that<br/>
unschooling can or should be defined.  I disagree.  It means something.<br/>
Should someone who disagrees with me be on the unschooling board?  Of<br/>
course.  There&#39;s no law that says we all have to agree, and we wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
much to talk about if we did.  ~Rue<br/>

vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom and several outside chores.  Of course<br/>
that list came about because my dear husband can&#39;t leave things be until<br/>
the kids do them.  He would wash the dishes, I would get mad because they<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No that&#39;s not quite what was said about the &#39;school&#39; stuff.  I think it<br/>
was something like, &quot;I want to start college classes next semester, what<br/>
do I need to do to get ready.&quot;  From there we worked out some things she<br/>
should do to &#39;practice&#39; for what will be expected of her in college.  She<br/>
has the option to not do some of it.  If she does not do any of it<br/>
(including the weeks chores) then she looses some autonomy.  Not because<br/>
she didn&#39;t do her &#39;schoolwork&#39; but because she didn&#39;t do ANYTHING.  The<br/>
job sheet is pretty specific on chores but very nonspecific on other<br/>
things.  If nothing she did in the entire week fit any of the categories,<br/>
she has a problem and needs to look at it.  We also wave the list if she<br/>
is doing something else that is cool but doesn&#39;t fit the list or if we<br/>
are out of the house too much.<br/>
But the list itself is more a way to watch her symptoms than an effort to<br/>
control her.  She is just coming off a serious allergy attack that we<br/>
noticed because her functioning levels dropped.  Without the list, we may<br/>
not have noticed as soon.  We also think we have pinpointed the source of<br/>
her headaches (maybe, I hope.)<br/>
My middle child, doesn&#39;t need the list but does it anyway just because. <br/>
Sometimes I think it is a competition thing with her sister but other<br/>
times I think she thinks it is a game.<br/>
My son, is not unschooled.  He was until this past January and I think he<br/>
was okay but when my mom moved in next door, she started taking him over<br/>
there for a couple of hours a day.  She thinks he needs the structure<br/>
even though I don&#39;t.   I think it isn&#39;t hurting him  and he will be fine<br/>
either way.  He likes the attention he gets from grandma so he like going<br/>
there and it is working out for all of us.<br/>
So, two out of my three are unschooled.  And the third was and will be<br/>
again soon.  <br/>
<br/>
Rue - thank you for actually taking the time to listen to what I am<br/>
saying and ask for clarification.<br/>
<br/>
Bridget<br/>
<br/>
ps - I was thinking last night, if you all want to insist that I am not<br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39; that&#39;s okay by me.  Even though what I am doing is pretty<br/>
well described on the unschooling.com site, I have never much cared for<br/>
the term myself.  But that has to do with my fussiness about language. <br/>
Unschooling as a word says &#39;not educating&#39; to me, the way wireless says<br/>
without wires to some others (long story, don&#39;t ask).  I prefer to think<br/>
of us as living and learning, in that order.<br/>

<br/>
Autonomy is a synonym for freedom in the thesaurus, but if by &quot;loses some <br/>
autonomy&quot; you mean her freedom is limited if she didn&#39;t finish her work, it&#39;s <br/>
control.  <br/>
<br/>
If you put writing in with doing the dishes and she can be grounded for not <br/>
doing the dishes or for not finishing her writing, it&#39;s not autonomy you&#39;re <br/>
talking about.  That she has without you giving it to her.  It&#39;s freedom, I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611898219">Well actually what she looses is the use of my mom&#39;s car.  If she shows<br/>
signs of not being part of the family by not listening to any of the<br/>
family guidelines which apply to all of us, then she looses the car.  She<br/>

<br/>
This is the kind of insulting tone which I&#39;ve objected to--the implication is <br/>
that we&#39;re idiots and you&#39;re calmly together.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody said this or anything like it:  &lt;&lt; Or that it is okay to sit around <br/>
and do nothing all day and expect the world to feed you? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The questions you have in the paragraphs above have to do with the <br/>
differences between natural consequences and imposed consequences.  I think <br/>
it&#39;s been discussed at length at unschooling.com.   What you&#39;re using are a<br/>
rtificial, imposed &quot;consequences&quot; (also known as &quot;punishment&quot;).  It&#39;s okay if <br/>
you want to do that, just be honest about the concept and terminology.<br/>
<br/>
HOW can an unschooler &quot;just sit around and do nothing all day&quot; if everything <br/>
is educational?<br/>
<br/>
But I digress.<br/>
<br/>
If she goes into a store and squishes bread, will she be unable to drive her <br/>
grandmother&#39;s car?  <br/>
<br/>
If I watch &quot;too much&quot; TV, will the reception become fuzzy?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She is still free to do as she pleases but what she does affects how we<br/>
treat her. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unconditional love or unconditional positive regard are hard to practice but <br/>
worth considering.  If parents are respectful of and kind to children, <br/>
children wouldn&#39;t think of withholding the unloading of a dishwasher (not in <br/>
my experience, not with the really cooperative families I most admire in my <br/>
life).<br/>
<br/>
The arguments in your paragraph above are like those used by abusive spouses. <br/>
 &quot;You had a choice.  You could have made a better dinner, and I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
thrown the casserole in the yard.&quot;  (To use an example of the father of <br/>
someone I know.)  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Are you really<br/>
saying that you do not teach you children that actions have consequences?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My children totally know that actions have consequences.  I didn&#39;t have to <br/>
teach them that.  We don&#39;t make any &quot;consequences&quot; up.  We discuss things <br/>
with them, we don&#39;t make up arbitrary rules and schedules, we cooperate in <br/>
getting as many people in the family to as many places and activities as they <br/>
need to go to, and it has worked out peacefully and really well for many <br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
I honestly believe that it can work for other families too.  I&#39;ve seen it.  <br/>
I&#39;ve seen families that started off that way, and other families that moved <br/>
toward it, and it seems better than the power struggles and arguments people <br/>
have to have when their policies are more important than their people.<br/>
<br/>
This is scary:  &lt;&lt; If she chooses to do nothing then she does nothing<br/>
in every sense of the word. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have never had a child ever &quot;do nothing.&quot;  And for me to impose &quot;nothing&quot; <br/>
on them as a punishment because they didn&#39;t do what I declared to be <br/>
&quot;something&quot; would be antagonistic, not supportive.  Not loving.  <br/>
<br/>
La Leche League did it for me for life, and I&#39;m really grateful.  They said <br/>
some traditional feeding advice (that Ezzo freak, for one, although they <br/>
didn&#39;t mention him) create an antagonism between the mother and child, and a <br/>
great &quot;us and them&quot; mentality, but the mother and child are partners and <br/>
should remain so.<br/>
<br/>
My children aren&#39;t my enemies, nor bad otherlings who need to be made to <br/>
become adult people when I say they&#39;re ready.  They&#39;re good people already.   <br/>
They help because they want to.  They help me because they trust me, and if I <br/>
say &quot;This is important&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m worried that this won&#39;t get done,&quot; they help <br/>
me the same way I help them when something is important to them or worrying <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a big adjustment.  It&#39;s  a small adjustement that makes a huge <br/>
difference.<br/>

draws beautiful pictures :) She has pen pals all over the place, they share <br/>
pics, (drawn and photo), stickers and other things. I made a very dear <br/>
friend with one of her pen pals :) and would have missed knowing such a <br/>
wonderful warm person! It also encourages her to write and learn about where <br/>
other people live. I see more benefits other than what I pointed out, so its <br/>
more than just a write a letter thing.<br/>

vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom and several outside chores.  Of course<br/>
that list came about because my dear husband can&#39;t leave things be until<br/>
the kids do them.  He would wash the dishes, I would get mad because they<br/>
hadn&#39;t done them and they would say, well we were going to but then dad<br/>
did them first.  So now, HE knows what he is not supposed to do.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No that&#39;s not quite what was said about the &#39;school&#39; stuff.  I think it<br/>
was something like, &quot;I want to start college classes next semester, what<br/>
do I need to do to get ready.&quot;  From there we worked out some things she<br/>
should do to &#39;practice&#39; for what will be expected of her in college.  She<br/>
has the option to not do some of it.  If she does not do any of it<br/>
(including the weeks chores) then she looses some autonomy.  Not because<br/>
she didn&#39;t do her &#39;schoolwork&#39; but because she didn&#39;t do ANYTHING.  The<br/>
job sheet is pretty specific on chores but very nonspecific on other<br/>
things.  If nothing she did in the entire week fit any of the categories,<br/>
she has a problem and needs to look at it.  We also wave the list if she<br/>
is doing something else that is cool but doesn&#39;t fit the list or if we<br/>
are out of the house too much.<br/>
But the list itself is more a way to watch her symptoms than an effort to<br/>
control her.  She is just coming off a serious allergy attack that we<br/>
noticed because her functioning levels dropped.  Without the list, we may<br/>
not have noticed as soon.  We also think we have pinpointed the source of<br/>
her headaches (maybe, I hope.)<br/>
My middle child, doesn&#39;t need the list but does it anyway just because. <br/>
Sometimes I think it is a competition thing with her sister but other<br/>
times I think she thinks it is a game.<br/>
My son, is not unschooled.  He was until this past January and I think he<br/>
was okay but when my mom moved in next door, she started taking him over<br/>
there for a couple of hours a day.  She thinks he needs the structure<br/>
even though I don&#39;t.   I think it isn&#39;t hurting him  and he will be fine<br/>
either way.  He likes the attention he gets from grandma so he like going<br/>
there and it is working out for all of us.<br/>
So, two out of my three are unschooled.  And the third was and will be<br/>
again soon.  <br/>
<br/>
Rue - thank you for actually taking the time to listen to what I am<br/>
saying and ask for clarification.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
ps - I was thinking last night, if you all want to insist that I am not<br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39; that&#39;s okay by me.  Even though what I am doing is pretty<br/>
well described on the unschooling.com site, I have never much cared for<br/>
the term myself.  But that has to do with my fussiness about language. <br/>
Unschooling as a word says &#39;not educating&#39; to me, the way wireless says<br/>
without wires to some others (long story, don&#39;t ask).  I prefer to think<br/>
of us as living and learning, in that order.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Life teaches kids that actions have consequences.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a difference between imposed and natural consequences.<br/>
<br/>
Squishing the bread in the store and having the manager descend on us is<br/>
natural. We have no control over his actions. They&#39;re a natural response to<br/>
our actions.<br/>
<br/>
Taking away car privileges are imposed. That particular consequence doesn&#39;t<br/>
naturally arise from your daughter&#39;s actions. You could choose (or not<br/>
choose!) to impose that or any consequence. She is well aware that the power<br/>
to impose the consequences or not is in your control.<br/>
<br/>
A *natural* consequence of not doing chores is whatever naturally results<br/>
from not doing them: dirty toilets, garbage spilling onto the floor,<br/>
irritated mom. Most kids don&#39;t really care about the natural consequences<br/>
(except mom getting irritated *if* mom treats their feelings with as much<br/>
respect as she would like them to treat her feelings) so many parents resort<br/>
to imposed consequences. Taking away or allowing car privileges is no<br/>
different than grades. They are both coercion to force others to do what we<br/>
want them to or behave as if they cared about the things we want them to.<br/>
