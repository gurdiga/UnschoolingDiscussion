<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088964476">On this same issue of praise I just had an experience that I would like some ideas on. As I touched on briefly our church Sunday school is doing this reward thing - and the &quot;RULES&quot; are explicit. That is a whole subject in itself -  what I had a question about was this:<br/>
<br/>
I taught the kids class the last two evenings while adults had a special seminar. One child asked towards the cleanup time if he could do anything to help. I was pleasantly surprised and said &quot;sure&quot;. He proceeded to sweep all under where we were working ( we made salt dough maps).<br/>
<br/>
The following night the boys were fighting over who was going to do this. and then I overhear why ... apparently they are given &quot;coins&quot; by the Sunday School teacher when they do helpful things, etc. These coins can then be turned into prizes like matchbox cars, trinkets and such.<br/>
<br/>
For my  kids personally I really would like them to do helpful things for the intrinsic value of being helpful, kind etc. NOT because they will get a reward. However in real life - it does seem to work this way. If you do a good job you get a raise. ( or in my husbands case - get to keep your job;-) <br/>
<br/>
So these same boys who would not normally have offered to help, much less done a decent clean-up job - now are more than willing to pitch in when given a reward.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t completely explain why - but I don&#39;t like this system. The other parents are fine with it - or don&#39;t want to rock the boat.  Some of them even go so far as to say they will &quot;call the Sunday School teacher if the child is &quot;bad&quot; - and then a &quot;coin&quot; will be taken away. The Sunday School teacher seems to feel that the kids don&#39;t have a problem with it - but I do. Which I do. I feel as if teaching children in this way - gives them the belief system that &quot;one good deed gets a reward&quot; What if there is no reward? <br/>
<br/>
I think we all are motivated by &quot;rewards&quot; of one type or another. It may not be monetary - but emotional. So even if I just say to the child &quot;Thanks for doing such a great job sweeping up. It really helped me out!&quot; I have &quot;rewarded&quot; him in a sense. <br/>
<br/>
I do have one child in this class - and luckily he is either too small to care - or in my opinion is not developmentally ready for most of the coin behavior. (i.e. Sitting in the seat throughout the whole meeting; no disobeying parents or adults; no running or rough playing; - and others which I can&#39;t remember) We always have to go to the bathroom - even if we&#39;ve gone before. It&#39;s virtually impossible to sit in a straight backed chair the whole time,  there is always something that is seen as disobeying - and in his exuberance - sometimes forgets not to run and hop in the building. At times he does feel excited that he has a &quot;coin&quot;. And after I had it out with the teacher that the one coin that he had was taken away because he &quot;saw him disobey me&quot; the coins are no longer taken away once received.  And my son seems to really enjoy this class. Chase doesn&#39;t have a problem with it - its me who feels it is a bit over the top. So is it wrong to interfere? ( Chase is 5)<br/>
<br/>
What do you all think? In one sense the reward system appears to be working.... but is it right to instill stewardship within a person based upon what reward they will receive?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input.<br/>

  I have lots of friends that give stickers, candy, trinkets as <br/>
  rewards/praise for their toilet trainees to use the bathroom.  Some even <br/>
  put sad faces on a calendar if the child didn&#39;t make it to the bathroom <br/>
  and stuff like that.  I&#39;ve seen their kids get pretty upset and have a <br/>
  fit when they didn&#39;t get goodies anymore, and I&#39;ve seen the poor things <br/>
  have the wind knocked out of their sails with the sad face on the <br/>
  calendar.  So sad.<br/>
<br/>
  My 2yo DD is potty training herself and when she uses the toilet and/or <br/>
  wakes up with a dry bed we give wild applaud as her own personal <br/>
  cheerleading squad.  Stuff like, &quot;Hooray!  You did it!  Go Fifi!  Go <br/>
  Fifi!  You must be so proud of yourself!!&quot;  Happy smiles all around. <br/>
  Her 4yo big brother is her biggest supporter.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
  I like to think that less is more, and I wasn&#39;t going to gift-give with <br/>
  my children every time they pooped.  LOL  I can see how that could <br/>
  backfire.  Our way may not be perfect, but it works for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867665742">Hi, new here! Just liked this line of questioning.my two cents - <br/>
 <br/>
Reward systems are good for certain children and only at certain<br/>
situations. In particular - if a child seems to be a little<br/>
disinterested in accomplishing a behavior - biting fingernails for<br/>
example.the reward system might work because it serves to correct a<br/>
specific behavior and will only last until the modifications are<br/>
completed. Once the child&#39;s habit in this instance is broken, one would<br/>
not continue to reward the corrected behavior. <br/>
 <br/>
Reward systems in this instance are going to fail. Why? Because they<br/>
will only last until the newness wears off or the reward no longer<br/>
justifies the act of the required behavior. What does the teacher plan<br/>
on using once the coin is no longer enough incentive to behave? 2 coins?<br/>
3 coins? <br/>
 <br/>
If the teacher truly wanted to elicit better behavior, then usually a<br/>
higher set of standards with positive reinforcement is required. If a<br/>
child wiggles during a service, work together to see what can challenge<br/>
the child until service is over.have him count hats, flowers, sneezes,<br/>
or the number of times the word &quot;Amen&quot; is spoken - that one tricks many<br/>
into paying attention (grin). <br/>
 <br/>
Many creative and unusual techniques can be adapted to fit different<br/>
situations. Reward systems are good for specific instances with short<br/>
term goals and quick achievements. Long term goals, like character<br/>
development take different approaches. I have discovered that other<br/>
children monitoring good behavior in their peers is *very* influencing.<br/>
Maybe the teacher could give the children lots of tickets or coins and<br/>
tell them they must try to notice positive behavior in their peers and<br/>
when they do, give them a coin. The goal is to give your coins away as<br/>
well as earn them from your peers. No reward system for the most coins<br/>
is necessary - we&#39;ve turned it into a game now. Again, this is not a<br/>
long term technique but a short term attention getter. Many of these<br/>
type games can be started back up every so often when the situation<br/>
calls for it.<br/>
 <br/>
Well - I chatted on longer than I planned! LOL! <br/>
<br/>
HTH!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480083147">Hi Heather,<br/>
The situation you described would bother me too. But I am sure that it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t bother most of the people I know because they are lost deep in<br/>
the culture of rewards based behavior and can&#39;t even see how it could be<br/>
bad.  (That&#39;s how schools are set up, but instead of coins, you get good<br/>
grades or little slips of paper to trade in for a pencil at the end of<br/>
the week.)  I think you&#39;ll have hard time getting people to change the<br/>
program because it works (temporarily) while the kids are there. The<br/>
teachers feel like they have some sense of control that way.  But for my<br/>
own kids, I wouldn&#39;t want them to be a part of it.  I don&#39;t want my kids<br/>
helping others for a prize or coin.  I want them to learn to listen to<br/>
their heart and follow it.  I want them to be free of that whole system<br/>
of thinking.  That said, if my child wanted to continue with the<br/>
program, I would stress to them at home the real reasons we help people<br/>
and tell him they give prizes just to remind the kids to be helpful more<br/>
often.<br/>
 <br/>
YMMV,<br/>
