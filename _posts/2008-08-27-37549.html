Sorscha is rereading the entire series AGAIN (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.warriorcats.com/)">http://www.warriorcats.com/)</a> - <br/>
I think this is the third time.  She loves the series and is quite upset <br/>
that the author &#39;Erin Hunter&#39; chose to write a polar bear book instead of <br/>
focusing on another Warriors book.  She&#39;s waiting patiently for September <br/>
2nd - the release of the newest book in the series.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-376769452">Michelle, too, possible the 3rd or 4th time, now!  She read the polar  <br/>
bear book, but still prefers cats, paws down. Have you guys got the  <br/>
manga comics? There&#39;s a new one about Tigerstar and Sasha coming out  <br/>
soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835985725">Caitlin liked the Seekers book but I&#39;m pretty sure Warriors is her <br/>
favorite.  She does know about the website and the deviantart site.  I <br/>
wish I could find some kids around our area that are into the books.  <br/>
She&#39;s obsessed.  She has a little video camera that she makes Warrior <br/>
movies on with her stuffed animals and she&#39;s constantly drawing cat <br/>
pictures on MSpaint.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your replies.  I already feel a lot more at ease about <br/>
it.  I&#39;m still learning to trust!!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038437813">For all of the Warriors lovers, there are also some forums that are devoted to the books.  The ones I&#39;m talking about are role playing forums.  If they like to write they might enjoy being part of them.  My daughter participates in one and really likes it.<br/>
<br/>
If you google &quot;clans of the forest&quot; you&#39;ll find a bunch.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d mention them :)<br/>
