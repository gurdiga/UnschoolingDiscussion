<div id="ygrps-yiv-8120132">I&#39;ve been reading in a book titled &quot;Everyday Sacred&quot; that had been my <br/>
mothers...<br/>
A couple of pages jumped out at me, as the arguements heated up again <br/>
at this board. I&#39;m going to type out part of the text that grabbed my <br/>
eye, it so perfectly describes the journey to unschooling for me:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;......Small changes in behavior, attitude, feelings, can, like the <br/>
little pebbles, add up to another kind of miracle. Small miracles do <br/>
build up and they can last.<br/>
When I stopped waiting for something &quot;significant&quot; to happen, and <br/>
instead began noticing what WAS happening, not what I wished was <br/>
happening, a series of small miracles occurred.<br/>
<br/>
When I began to trust what I was doing even when it didn&#39;t seem to <br/>
make sense, when I understood that what I was doing was seeking, then <br/>
what I was seeking was shown to me.<br/>
<br/>
People knocked on my door and said, &#39;would you like this?&#39;  Chance <br/>
occurrences, unexpected meetings made me feel I was not alone.<br/>
When I trusted I was doing something of value, goals and timetables <br/>
had a way of taking care of themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Jung called the &#39;meaningful coincidences.&#39;  Peter, a Swiss friend, <br/>
described the German word Zufall, which rougly translates as &#39;to fall <br/>
into.&#39;  &#39;Something falls to you,&#39; he said, &#39;not as something you <br/>
caused, but a coincidence you are ready to accept and absorb in your <br/>
life.&#39;  I realized he was describing serendipity.  I notice these <br/>
moments come when I&#39;m not demanding or insistent that they come.<br/>
<br/>
Today, stapled on a telephone pole crowded with other posters, I <br/>
saw: &#39;Allow-for the possibilities.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--Sue Bender<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what unschoolers do all the time...allow for possibilities.<br/>
And I think that second paragraph is even more meaningful when worded <br/>
this way:<br/>
When I began to trust what my children were doing even when it didn&#39;t <br/>
seem to make sense, when I understood that what they were doing was <br/>
seeking, then what they were seeking was shown to me.<br/>
<br/>
Wow....unschooling in a nutshell.<br/>
