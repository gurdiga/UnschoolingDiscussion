<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107167627">When I was about 10 or so I read a book about a girl named Elspeth who (after <br/>
her parents died) took her little brother from their home in either Ireland <br/>
or Scotland to Liverpool. From there they got on a boat to Canada and went to <br/>
either Manitoba or Saskatchewan as pioneers. I really want to find this book <br/>
again! The copy I read had a picture of a girl and a little boy standing on a <br/>
ship deck against the railing. Anyone know what book I am talking about? <br/>

But, it doesn&#39;t sound quite right. can you remember any other the other<br/>
characters&#39; names and/or the approximate publish date?<br/>
 This is a good site to search on:<br/>

I&#39;m new to the list and I&#39;m thoroughly enjoying everyone&#39;s company. Such<br/>
a joy to know mine are not the only kids in the world to be sitting in a<br/>

I checked online for my library and they show the name as &quot;Journey of the <br/>
Shadow Bairns&quot; (slightly different spelling). If you checked with the <br/>
spelling &#39;Barins&quot; it may not have shown up. There are also several copies on <br/>
half.com (you&#39;ll need a credit card though).<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

Amazon gets a cut there too. I searched www.addall.com and found many <br/>
copies from independent sellers where a credit card is not necessary. <br/>
It is &quot;Bairns&quot; by the way. Looks like an intersting book. They also <br/>
have cheap paperbacks of it on www.half.com but I think you need a <br/>
credit card there too.<br/>
