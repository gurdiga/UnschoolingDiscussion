<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345935676">Thank you all for your comments on this thread.  They<br/>
have been helpful if not insightful.  Just to clarify,<br/>
I offered up The Sopranos and The Lord of The Rings<br/>
only as examples; there are others, and the issue<br/>
wasn&#39;t meant to only separate out these two films.  We<br/>
do not, by the way, watch these or these type of films<br/>
around our children (ages 3 and 1).  We watch them<br/>
when they are either napping or asleep for the night,<br/>
or once in a while we actually get to go out on a date<br/>
to the movies without the kiddos.<br/>
<br/>
But, our opportunities to watch these &#39;adult&#39; films<br/>
are getting fewer, so we are wondering 1. what films<br/>
can we now watch with our children in the room and 2.<br/>
When can we watch certain types of films with our<br/>
children in the room (whether it&#39;s what age, or what<br/>
developmental stage they&#39;re at).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for me to accept that all unschooling<br/>
philosophy is applicable to all children of all ages. <br/>
I feel like some unschooling philosophy is appropriate<br/>
for older children and not for younger.  and in my<br/>
case, younger means 3 not 9.  I have been looking for<br/>
an outlet to discuss issues with this younger age<br/>
group and have found it challenging.  Although I have<br/>
gained a wealth of knowledge from this group, and<br/>
although I know some families on this group have<br/>
children around my childrens&#39; ages, it seems like the<br/>
majority of the discussion is geared toward the older<br/>
child.  Which is fine, but I could use more discussion<br/>
toward the very young child.  I checked out a group<br/>
called preunschooling, and left it because it was not<br/>
very helpful as the people on it didn&#39;t really have a<br/>
genuine clue as to what unschooling really was as they<br/>
discussed cirriculum and daycare/preschool quite a<br/>
bit!?  If anyone can point me in a direction where I<br/>
can get more insight on the younger age group, that<br/>
would be great.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that there are some stages in early life that<br/>
little kids don&#39;t need to know about much.  I believe<br/>
Sandra Dodd posted a comment to this effect. <br/>
<br/>
Although posted under a different thread, and although<br/>
it seems to contradict her earlier comment about<br/>
&quot;Innocence being ignorance dressed in a frilly dress&quot;,<br/>
this statement by Sandra Dodd, and a response by<br/>
another poster rings true to my feelings: <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Innocence is as natural as any other progression in<br/>
&gt;live and learning.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;*********************************<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I agree with this too.  I think it really depends on<br/>
&gt;the individual <br/>
&gt;child, and what their level of interest is and where<br/>
&gt;they are <br/>
&gt;developmentally.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, for me and my child, it seems right to provide and<br/>
withold (by not giving the choice) certain movies that<br/>
do not seem appropriate to their psychological and<br/>
emotional development.  I am happy to keep my 3 year<br/>
old as &#39;innocent&#39; as possible because I do believe<br/>
there are some things he does not need to know or<br/>
worry about- yet. (For example, rape, murder,<br/>
abuse...)  At the same time I do know there will be a<br/>
time he will be mature enough to digest all that. <br/>
And, I guess, I will just have to cue into his<br/>
development to determine that as I&#39;m sure as he gets<br/>
older he will be able to provide me with feedback as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You haven&#39;t offered up any reasons why your son<br/>
&gt;seeing those movies <br/>
&gt;would be bad other then you being uncomfortable which<br/>
&gt;I think has nothing <br/>
&gt;to do with why he shouldn&#39;t watch them and that he<br/>
&gt;might freak out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not so much that I would be uncomfortable with my<br/>
son watching certain images as I would be concerned<br/>
that he would not understand them or may want to try<br/>
to imitate them.  For example, if he sees a violent<br/>
scene, I would be concerned that he may try it out on<br/>
his 1 year old brother.  Also, I think he is not<br/>
emotionally and psychologically ready to watch sex.  I<br/>
have no problem with him watching nudity but do not<br/>
think he is ready to watch sex.  We haven&#39;t talked<br/>
about it yet, so I don&#39;t feel his first exposure<br/>
should be from a movie.<br/>
<br/>
I do appreciate the comments and am thinking of us all<br/>
watching the special effects part of the LOTR DVDs. <br/>
Good idea, and I know my partner would be excited<br/>
about that.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this got so lengthy!<br/>

You may find UnschoolingBasics@yahoogroups.com fills more of your needs.<br/>
Many of the same people are both here and there (including myself obviously,<br/>
and the U/B list owners Ren and Kelly), but it *seems* that there are more<br/>
posters with younger children in their families. Maybe I just notice them<br/>
more because my dd is 4.5. It is more about people beginning Unschooling, so<br/>
that may be why there are younger children talked about - not exclusively of<br/>
course. There are also families with older children who are nonetheless new<br/>
to Unschooling.<br/>

childhood through my daughter&#39;s delight and didn&#39;t miss the adult movies as<br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think my daughter much noticed adult TV before 4 or 5 and then she<br/>
started relating what she saw to what happened in real life. (I&#39;m recalling<br/>
we stopped watching ER about that time.) Before that if it wasn&#39;t a cartoon<br/>
or an animal or something she wanted to see, it didn&#39;t hold her attention.<br/>
<br/>
I think Kat was 5 maybe when she started watching Xena which had a fair<br/>
amount of violence in it. But she&#39;s always been drawn to anything funny so<br/>
she avoided the more violent ones because they were also more serious. Same<br/>
with Buffy.<br/>

let you know when you can finally watch Kill Bill Vol. 1 or Angel Heart with<br/>
the kids in the room. Some kids are sensitive and maybe they won&#39;t even want<br/>
to see those as adutls. Some kids get the pretend aspect see special effects<br/>
and made up stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I think 1 and 3 are rough ages since it seems like these times will go on<br/>
forever. Maybe because they&#39;re so far from adult interests and so demanding<br/>
of time. But they do grow and they do change. And then you start feeling<br/>
that it really won&#39;t last forever.<br/>

different with different ages and different personalities and different<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596543478">&lt;&gt;It&#39;s hard for me to accept that all unschooling<br/>
philosophy is applicable to all children of all ages.<br/>
I feel like some unschooling philosophy is appropriate<br/>

case, younger means 3 not 9. I have been looking for<br/>
an outlet to discuss issues with this younger age<br/>
group and have found it challenging.<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
Jennefer,<br/>
<br/>
My children are 7, 5 and 4. I know Robyn&#39;s Jane is young, too, maybe 3? <br/>
There are a couple of us, at least, who are active here with young <br/>
children. The wonderful thing about coming to unschooling is that you <br/>
can gradually lift certain controls as they become appropriate, as with <br/>
movies and tv. Right now, work on saying yes more, work on finding ways <br/>
to say yes if the initial response needs to be no.<br/>
<br/>
Even very young children can decide when they are hungry and tired. When <br/>
mine were younger, they had free access to a snack cart filled with food <br/>
they could freely choose. Yes, these choices were limited to healthy <br/>
choices--pretzels, graham crackers, animal crackers were the closest <br/>
thing to cookies in there. In the refridgerator on the lowest shelf I <br/>
had cubed fruit and sliced veggies and cheese slices. I had read quite a <br/>
bit of Monetssori philosophy when my oldest was about 2, out of which I <br/>
took the idea that children really wanted to use real tools, not fake or <br/>
pretend tools, that children took pride in caring for their own things, <br/>
that the space needed to be set up at child level and made child size <br/>
whenever possible. This approach made a huge difference in our lives--my <br/>
girls, especially, really responded to this. It gave them a tremendous <br/>
amount of control over themselves and their environment and paved the <br/>
way for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Same thing with bedtimes. Even when we had a bedtime routine--bath, <br/>
story, snuggles--the children were never told to get in bed and shut <br/>
their eyes. They were always welcome to play quietly in their rooms <br/>
until they felt ready to go to sleep, and my girls have always shared a <br/>
room, so there was plenty of playing. They are 17 months apart, and for <br/>
a long time Julia (5 now) would fall asleep around 9:00 and Emily would <br/>
continue playing until 10:30 or so. It wasn&#39;t a very difficult step to <br/>
say to tell them they were welcome to play quietly downstairs until they <br/>
were ready to fall asleep.<br/>
<br/>
I think lots of unschooling with younger children can happen quite <br/>
naturally as they grow. You&#39;re coming to unschooling at a perfect time. <br/>
Take it gradually, and try to not to feel like you have to do it all at <br/>
once like flipping a switch. Work on finding more ways to say yes, more <br/>
ways for your children to control their own environment and you will <br/>
begin to see all the wonderful aspects of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>

If anyone can point me in a direction where I<br/>
can get more insight on the younger age group, that<br/>
would be great.<br/>

<br/>
I responded specifically to many of your questions below, but maybe you <br/>
didn&#39;t see my post, so here it is again.<br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
Excuse my probably basic question here, but has this<br/>
always been the case, or was there a certain age when<br/>
you started to let her watch whatever she wants?  It<br/>
seems like there are some &#39;unschooling&#39; families with<br/>
young children &#39;preschool&#39; age or younger (3 years old<br/>
here) who only selectively let there children watch TV<br/>
or videos.<br/>
===================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;This hasn&#39;t always been the case for us, as I touched on a bit in my <br/>
tv post. For a long time we didn&#39;t have tv. When the kids were really <br/>
young--when my oldest was 3 or under--I limited the amount of time they <br/>
watched videos to an hour or under a day. By the time she was 4, though, <br/>
she had free access to the videos and could pop them in when she wanted, <br/>
though that was still pretty controlled and limited by what we had in <br/>
the house. I remember lots of Teletubbies, Dragon Tales, Bear in the Big <br/>
Blue House, Masie, countless Disney movies. We have a *huge* video <br/>
collection because of those years without tv.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started reading here (a year ago in November, I think), I <br/>
began rethinking my approach to tv (and bedtimes and food). We had <br/>
gotten cable several months before, so the kids (6, 4 and 3 at that <br/>
point) were watching tv as well as videos, though still more often <br/>
videos. I remember I had been wondering for a while when it would be <br/>
&quot;okay&quot; to let my kids watch Star Wars, which I couldn&#39;t wait to share <br/>
with them because it&#39;s such an interest for dh and I. Emily had seen <br/>
bits and pieces of the Phantom Menace, the parts that weren&#39;t too scary, <br/>
but it was still something that dh and I watched after the kids went to <br/>
bed. For us, that&#39;s how it started--with Star Wars. After Star Wars, we <br/>
began watching other things as well. It was gradual, not an <br/>
in-your-face-violence kind of thing. Em had also seen parts of Lord of <br/>
the Rings, so we were soon sharing that with her as well. At first, she <br/>
got really upset by the dead dwarves in the mines and stopped watching. <br/>
It took her several months before she was comfortable trying again. Same <br/>
thing with Spiderman--it was just too realistic when we first rented it, <br/>
maybe 6 months ago so we turned it off. We tried again a couple of weeks <br/>
ago, and they loved it--even the 4 year old. (A friend of mine has <br/>
gotten quite a bit of grief from her 8 year old because he&#39;s not allowed <br/>
to watch it but knows that Sam has.) We&#39;ve shared lots of really great <br/>
movies over the past year, but we still enjoy watching Disney movies, <br/>
cartoons or whatever. We&#39;ve watched all the Star Wars, Lord of the <br/>
Rings, Indiana Jones, Men in Black, X-Men. We&#39;ve also watched Crouching <br/>
Tiger, Hidden Dragon; The Last Samurai; Sound of Music; Peter Pan; Harry <br/>
Potter and many others.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, this has been gradual. The kids probably don&#39;t even <br/>
remember not having free choice because it went from being very young to <br/>
free choice of videos to free choice of tv and movies. But, that doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean that they watch whatever they want without any parental input or <br/>
presence. Emily watched the Last Samurai in our bed with us, and she <br/>
watched me sob at the end when the Samurai get massacred. We talked <br/>
about *why* I was crying so hard and what it meant to me to watch that. <br/>
They haven&#39;t seen The Matrix yet, but they haven&#39;t asked to see it <br/>
either.  When Dh rented Kill Bill, we told the kids that it was an adult <br/>
movie, same thing with Fight Club. There are movies that I don&#39;t think <br/>
they need to see, and, yes, I&#39;m the one making that decision.. Kill Bill <br/>
was a movie I don&#39;t think *I* needed to see! We watch those movies in <br/>
our room with the door closed. In the past we would have watched <br/>
something like that after they went to bed, but because our kids no <br/>
longer have a bedtime, they&#39;re still awake. We just point that out and <br/>
remind them that they&#39;re free to watch something else downstairs, play <br/>
the computer, play in the playroom, any number of other things, and <br/>
they&#39;re fine with that because it doesn&#39;t happen very often. They <br/>
realize that we&#39;re not telling them no just for the sake of controlling <br/>
but because it&#39;s something that is genuinely too much for them.<br/>
<br/>
The gradual part is really important, I think. Several months ago, I <br/>
made an analogy to someone who was throwing off controls left and right <br/>
and whose children didn&#39;t quite know what to do with the new freedom. I <br/>
suggested that it might be a lot like being in a closet and having <br/>
someone suddenly fling the door open wide, letting flood in the very <br/>
bright light outside and how much that must hurt their eyes!  It&#39;s not <br/>
about flinging the door open as quickly as you can just because it&#39;s <br/>
been closed for so long; it&#39;s more about gradually opening the door, <br/>
using your children&#39;s comfort levels to guide you. Like several of the <br/>
experienced folks here often say, it&#39;s not about never saying no but <br/>
about saying yes more often.<br/>

movies that were &quot;adult&quot; or inappropriate for babies and toddlers <br/>
for a while, and if there was something we *really* wanted to see we <br/>

all children- more that it looks different at different ages.  Birth <br/>
order also figures in a lot.<br/>
It was very easy for me to tailor my first son&#39;s environment to <br/>
be &quot;age appropriate&quot;- meaning the happiest and safest it could be <br/>
for a baby/young toddler.<br/>
Then my third son was born when his brothers were 6 and 4, and <br/>
suddenly there were little lego pieces on the floor in the path of a <br/>
crawling baby, etc.  My first son listened to children&#39;s music at <br/>
age 5 (like Raffi), and my present 5yo likes Blink 182 and Green Day.<br/>
Some things I ask my older sons to do/watch/play in their own rooms, <br/>
or when their brother&#39;s sleeping, and they understand that since <br/>
considering the needs and feelings of a little brother has been a <br/>
part of their life since *they* were little.<br/>

&gt; child.  Which is fine, but I could use more discussion<br/>
&gt; toward the very young child.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;d get a lot out of the preschool folder of the <br/>
unschooling boards when it gets back up.<br/>
There are lots of archived conversations to read, and you could get <br/>
some new conversations started.<br/>

that your Dad and I love but you can&#39;t see it because you&#39;re too <br/>
little&quot; and simply keeping the movies entirely out of their <br/>
consciousness- to the extent that it&#39;s possible.  Then it won&#39;t even <br/>
be an issue.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally I think there are some images that just don&#39;t need to be <br/>
inside a baby&#39;s head if it&#39;s possible for us to keep them out for a <br/>
while longer.  Scenes from the Sopranos would be an example, so <br/>
would the evening news.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents. :-)<br/>

<br/>
I think you&#39;re misunderstanding what we mean by &quot;giving the choice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;THE&quot; choice.  It&#39;s choice.<br/>
<br/>
If there is a movie about which a child has no interest and no knowledge, <br/>
nobody&#39;s saying it&#39;s a parent&#39;s duty to describe it to them, and ask if they <br/>
might like to watch it now.<br/>
<br/>
If your DVD or video player has a &quot;pause&quot; button, use it if a child come in <br/>
during a rough scene in a movie.  Talk to the child.  Go see what she needs.  <br/>
Find her something better to do, or watch your movie later.<br/>
<br/>
One of the many wonders of video is the movie doesn&#39;t need to be watched all <br/>
at once.    And about TV shows, tape them.  If you watch while you&#39;re taping <br/>
and you&#39;re interrupted, you know it it will still be there.  If you watch and <br/>
finish without interruption, wind back and use that tape next time.   <br/>
<br/>
-=- I am happy to keep my 3 year<br/>
old as &#39;innocent&#39; as possible because I do believe<br/>
there are some things he does not need to know or<br/>
worry about- yet. (For example, rape, murder,<br/>
abuse...) -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone will disagree with you at all about that, just about the <br/>
idea that the parents should have a policy of control. n naturally that young <br/>
children are sheltered, withtout the parent feeling she created that safety <br/>

Definitely.<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t work when parents are expecting their children to mature <br/>

knowing and thinking as the days unfold.<br/>

You won&#39;t need to determine when he is old enough for something.  He can <br/>
determine that.  Parents can learn to be prepared to change the station, distract <br/>
them, remind them it&#39;s fiction, or whatever, instead of making a <br/>
pre-determined flat &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; about a whole genre of entertainment.<br/>

It&#39;s hard to describe, but it&#39;s much easier than all the analytical thinking <br/>
people are describing.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I found that when I accepted that was the way life would be for a while,<br/>
that I really looked forward to kids movies because I was sort of revisiting<br/>
childhood through my daughter&#39;s delight and didn&#39;t miss the adult movies as<br/>
much. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
True too!!<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I knew ALL the kid-movies and characters in those days.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly and I passed by the Disney Store the other day at the mall, and there <br/>
was a big poster of Princess Diaries II in the window.  Now that will generate <br/>
NO cool stuffed animals or sing-along tapes whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
I told her I was really glad that when Kirby was little we got to have Little <br/>
Mermaid and Aladdin.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, I get some of my adult movie experience from recommendations Kirby <br/>
and Marty make, and that&#39;s fine with me.   <br/>
<br/>
As to sex in movies, there are many different levels of that, too.<br/>
If in Four Weddings and a Funeral, two people wake up in the same bed in the <br/>
morning, the kids know nothing.   If two people give each other the eye and go <br/>
upstairs, kids know nothing.    There are sex scenes that are not going to <br/>
mean a thing to a child (&quot;toucha touch me/creature of the night&quot;, for example).  <br/>
 There are sex scenes I wouldn&#39;t put the pause on if Kirby or Marty came <br/>
along, just because I wouldn&#39;t be crazy about them seeing me see it.  They&#39;re <br/>
practically grown men.  I&#39;d probably pause it if ANYone else came in the room.  <br/>
That would be (thinking of what was in my head while I wrote that) Last Tango in <br/>
Paris, or Unfaithful, or other explicit rough stuff or kinky stuff.   <br/>
<br/>
If a couple is in a bed or on a couch and the guy is on top of the woman, I <br/>
can calmly say it&#39;s a kind of kissing and hugging moms and dads do.   If <br/>
someone&#39;s up against the wall squealing, while it MIGHT be what moms and dads do <br/>
sometimes if they&#39;re lucky, I don&#39;t want to have to answer too many questions <br/>
about that.<br/>
<br/>
Monday Holly and I went to see The Stepford Wives. There&#39;s a sex scene off <br/>
camera.  What it is is three main characters at the bottom of the stairs making <br/>
facial reactions to the sounds of sex upstairs.   It&#39;s very funny, really, and <br/>
I don&#39;t think it will hurt a twelve year old girl in any way to know that <br/>
sometimes sex is noisy and fun.<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t take anyone here thirty seconds to go to google.and find a day&#39;s <br/>
worth of reading from other homeschoolers (probably Christian and male) that <br/>
said it would ruin your children&#39;s lives, marriages and eternal souls to see a <br/>
movie where any unmarried couple so much as kisses.    I&#39;m not saying what I <br/>
have experienced and &quot;allowed&quot; is the only one true way.  I&#39;m saying my kids <br/>
are not nasty perverts, at 12, 15 and 18 even though they have not been <br/>
unnaturally sheltered.  I still shelter them sometimes, but it&#39;s a case-by-case thing, <br/>
and the edges of what I think they probably wouldn&#39;t want to see have moved <br/>
gradually and constantly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604005595">** It&#39;s hard for me to accept that all unschooling<br/>
philosophy is applicable to all children of all ages.<br/>
I feel like some unschooling philosophy is appropriate<br/>
for older children and not for younger.  and in my<br/>
case, younger means 3 not 9. **<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many people define unschooling as starting when your kids are old enough <br/>
to not start school, that is they are old enough for Kindergarden or <br/>
First Grade, but don&#39;t go.<br/>
<br/>
I know that this is going to sound puzzling, but the unschooling <br/>
philosophy is not a strict set of rules wherein active posters here tell <br/>
you exactly what to do.  When people are troubled and stuck, especially <br/>
with an unschooling issue, then people on the list do make suggestions.  <br/>
But ultimately it comes down to each parent&#39;s own judgement.  Rules <br/>
don&#39;t supercede judgement.  And fundamentally, unschooling is not about <br/>
rules.<br/>

&lt;&lt; There&#39;s a big difference, IMO, between saying &quot;here&#39;s this movie <br/>
<br/>
that your Dad and I love but you can&#39;t see it because you&#39;re too <br/>
<br/>
little&quot; and simply keeping the movies entirely out of their <br/>
<br/>
consciousness- to the extent that it&#39;s possible.  Then it won&#39;t even <br/>
<br/>
be an issue.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hard to describe this.  It&#39;s a kind of environment-childproofing.  <br/>
<br/>
When we talk about giving them food freedoms it doesn&#39;t mean of all the foods <br/>
in the world at any moment, it means don&#39;t tell them they can&#39;t have more, <br/>
don&#39;t make them eat spinach.  I means lighten up, and arrange a house in which <br/>
they can find something to eat.  Don&#39;t put food right in front of them and say <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t touch it until 5:00&quot; or &quot;This is for me, and you can&#39;t even taste it, <br/>
ever.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With bedtimes, it&#39;s not &quot;How about you try to stay up until the sun rises?  <br/>
I&#39;m going to bed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With movies, it&#39;s not &quot;You&#39;re too young for this whole shelf of movies, so <br/>
never touch them.&quot;  It&#39;s give them lots of choices among things you know they <br/>
would like.  And watch them with them.  And if they hate Sesame Street (which <br/>
Holly did, until she was 9 or so), don&#39;t push it.   Once she started liking <br/>
Sesame Street she wanted to know all about the history of the show, and will still <br/>
watch old tapes, listen to cassette tapes from the 70&#39;s, wants to learn all <br/>
the harmonies of &quot;One Little Star&quot; from Follow that Bird...   Immersion.<br/>
<br/>
She watched Stand By Me the other day.  When she was little and said &quot;I hate <br/>
Big Bird,&quot; she used to watch Stand By Me.  It&#39;s based on a Stephen King story, <br/>
it&#39;s got &#39;big boys,&#39; fear, death...    It&#39;s probably the favorite movie of <br/>
her whole life.   The other day she said, &quot;I just got this part,&quot; about <br/>
something, and she asked me what &quot;stormed the beach at Normandy&quot; meant.  She had <br/>
paused it that day and said &quot;What does he mean by this?&quot; It was the voiceover <br/>
commenting that the dog had taught him the diffence between myth and reality (don&#39;t <br/>
know the exact quote).  I started talking to her about myth and she said, <br/>
&quot;No, I know what myth means, but why did he say that?&quot;  So she ran it back and I <br/>
pointed out that their belief that the dog was told to &#39;sic balls&#39; was just <br/>
myth.  All the dog wanted was for them to get out of the fence, because as soon <br/>
as he was on one side the dog on the other, the dog lay down happily and just <br/>
looked at him.   So it was a visual indication, not words.<br/>
<br/>
I could&#39;ve told her nine years ago that that movie was not good for a little <br/>
girl.  But that movie has been very good for her.   And for me?  A young, <br/>
posturing Keifer Sutherland, every time she watches it. &lt;g&gt;  If she doesn&#39;t fully <br/>
appreciate that part of the show, she might in a few more years.   It&#39;s <br/>
somewhat like sex without the presence of bed, couch or female.  But if she doesn&#39;t <br/>
get it, she doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  She also asked me that day to find &quot;The Body&quot; and read it so I can tell <br/>
her what&#39;s different.  I did that for her with The Green Mile and What&#39;s <br/>
Eating Gilbert Grape.<br/>

True.  I remember watching this when my son was younger and noticing the <br/>
humorous use of the F*** expletive, about 25 times in the first scene.  <br/>
It may even be the first word in the movie.<br/>
<br/>
So, IF someone posted here that this movie is the movie that their kid <br/>
wanted to see, I would mention the language used, and probably the scene <br/>
where Andie McDowell counts off her previous lovers.<br/>
<br/>
I really like this movie, and have watched it several times, so my son <br/>

We decided years ago not to care about that.<br/>
If we hadn&#39;t, my kids wouldn&#39;t know the words to the South Park movie musical <br/>
songs, nor would Kirby and Marty have turned me on to Eddie Izzard.  They <br/>
would have had to hide the fact that they had listened to it themselves, as <br/>
f***ful as it is.<br/>
<br/>
[anyone who hates that word, just go to the next post and quit reading]<br/>
<br/>
The information surrounding that word, whether it&#39;s casual drama or crazed <br/>
comedians like Robin Williams or George Carlin, is more important than living a <br/>
life without ever hearing anyone utter the sound the word &quot;fuck&quot; makes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s okay to use it as a horrible insult or in a nasty <br/>
sexual way.  Any words can be used to insult and embarrass people.  My kids have al<br/>
ways been careful not to be horrible to other people. Again, it&#39;s too often <br/>
for me (for my tastes) a matter of people not wanting to really think, but just <br/>
to make rules.   The word itself doesn&#39;t hurt anyone.  In the words of Eric <br/>
Cartman, <br/>
<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s the big deal?  It doesn&#39;t hurt anybody! Fuck fuckedy fuck fuck fuck.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When looking for a site to cut and paste the Cartman quote from, I noticed <br/>
something.  The people who had quoted him were using the  f word for shock <br/>
value, and it seemed to me that they must really have been forbidden to use it at <br/>
home for them to have blogs and websites so saturated in it.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile my kids can go a long time without using the word, because when <br/>
they do use it peopla powerfully horribly dangerous entity of some sort.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s become really obvious how many curse words there are in Men in <br/>
Black I and II since we&#39;ve been watching them with the kids (7, 5 and <br/>
4), though not f%#k. The only one they&#39;ve asked about is d*ck, which is <br/>
also in X-Men. We&#39;ve just matter of factly told them what it means and <br/>
said that we don&#39;t really use those words because they may make some <br/>
people upset, for the same reason we don&#39;t say &quot;oh my god.&quot; They seem <br/>
pretty satisfied with that, though we have been on a big &quot;butt&quot; kick *g* <br/>
since seeing Rugrats Go Wild! They think that&#39;s awfully fun to say I <br/>
guess because we&#39;ve always said tush.<br/>

The day after we first watched  X-Men, I heard the boys out playing  and one<br/>

said they should probably be careful where they said shit (I explained what<br/>
it meant) as a lot of people would be offended by it and I didn&#39;t want them<br/>
to lose friends because of it. (their best friends&#39; parents are conservative<br/>
Christians, no TV.......)<br/>
<br/>
They both looked at me like in bewilderment and said, &quot;Mum, Jess said Holy<br/>
ship&quot; Oh!  So I guess if I ever hear them say shit (I haven&#39;t yet) I can&#39;t<br/>
blame it on the TV. &lt;g&gt; Jacob once announced at a friend&#39;s house that he<br/>
knew a swear word. Our friend asked him what it was and Jacob said (he had<br/>
been watching the Princess Bride) &#39;son of a pitch&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
The kids do say bloody hell, just like Ron Weasley says it and they like to<br/>
remember every insult Fred and George have ever said. But anything else<br/>
seems to go over the heads. They&#39;re unfamiliar words and they seem to slip<br/>
