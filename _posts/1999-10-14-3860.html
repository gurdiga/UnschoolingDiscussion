&lt;&lt; What I am<br/>
 saying is that there is a definite benefit to acquiring knowledge that you<br/>
 do not have to look up and I think you would agree with that.  I think we<br/>
 would also agree that just filling our heads with &quot;facts&quot; because &quot;they&quot; say<br/>
 so is not right. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I absolutely agree with you here! Thank you for phrasing it better than I <br/>
did! :o)<br/>
