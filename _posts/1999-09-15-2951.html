The first book I recommend to people these days is _The Homeschooling <br/>
Handbook_ by Mary Griffith.  It gives a wonderful intro and overview <br/>
to homeschooling and covers all of the different approaches.  It <br/>
lists lots of resources too.  It&#39;s a very easy read packed with <br/>
information.  She also wrote _The Unschooling Handbook_ which I love.<br/>
You mentioned the Teenage Liberation Handbook which is great for <br/>
teens and their parents.  Grace Llewellyn also wrote _Real Lives_ or <br/>
actually the kids wrote it themselves.  It&#39;s a collection of essays <br/>
about how 11 different teenage unschoolers spend their days - really <br/>
interesting and very reassuring.  Or how about a subscription to Home <br/>
Ed Magazine or GWS.  Those were my very first intros to <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry,  I don&#39;t know what essay you were referring to.  Hopefully <br/>
someone else will.<br/>
