<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, but didn&#39;t kindergarten come from the idea of making sure that no<br/>
kids were left behind in 1st grade?  Are we going to add pre-preschool for<br/>
babies so they&#39;re not left behind in preschool?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re currently living in Germany, compliments of the U.S. Army.  My child<br/>
is 6, and reads.  He taught himself, which all Americans think is great, and<br/>
most Germans think is strange.  He&#39;s an anomaly in Germany.  German<br/>
Kindergarten begins at age 3 and goes until the children start school at 6.<br/>
It&#39;s mainly about learning to play together and is not academic.  German<br/>
children learn A,B,C and all that in 1st grade.  As a result, they read<br/>
fluently at 7, 8, or later.  If test scores are what you care about (and<br/>
certainly that seems to be important to many Americans), German children<br/>
appear to be far better educated than their American counterparts, despite<br/>
their late start reading.  While the German system is not perfect, of<br/>
course, it at least demonstrates that our obsession with very early<br/>
childhood education is not justified.<br/>

publicly-funded choice.  They start reading even later.  My friends&#39; <br/>
children went to public Waldorf schools right through high school near <br/>
Stuttgart.<br/>

anything racist.  He&#39;s an old boyfriend from my Berkeley days.<br/>

I participated in a Waldorf study group a few years ago (at the request <br/>
of a friend who was wavering between homeschooling and <br/>
enrolling her child in a Waldorf school - we were already commited to <br/>
homeschooling).  At the time I didn&#39;t think too much about the <br/>
racist aspect, but, hindsite being 20/20, I can see it more clearly <br/>
now.  While I appreciate some of their philosophy on schooling <br/>
children, <br/>
some of it is just plain scary.<br/>

You have one of those too?  Sometimes I miss my days hanging out in <br/>
Berkeley with the old boyfriend, sitting at coffe houses, listening <br/>
to the drummers on the campus, hanging out in Moe&#39;s bookstore.  Thanks <br/>
for the reminder.</div>
