&lt;&lt; I think we have tended to become isolationists with our children, so that <br/>
we can instil in them the values we need without a lot of interference from <br/>
needing to conform to group social pressures from well meaning friends and <br/>
family.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     We are this way, too, a lot of the time.  Some of my kids are older ( 2 <br/>
12 yr olds and a 16 yr old) and there are times when we do more with other <br/>
people.  But they actually love being home, being able to read, walk around <br/>
outside, listen to music they like, etc.  I have felt guilty that maybe I was <br/>
keeping them too isolated at times but as they get older, I am so encouraged <br/>
by the views they&#39;ve developed, the way they think, etc.  They really are <br/>
THINKERS!  We still have two younger ones, ages 8 and 3, so we&#39;ll see how it <br/>
goes with them but I&#39;m hopeful now seeing how their older brothers are doing.<br/>
