&lt;&lt; &gt;Blood spots don&#39;t show up in candling.<br/>
 <br/>
 Then how do they separate out the ones with blood spots that they sell for <br/>
 pet food?  Maybe what someone said about it being hard to spot them in <br/>
 brown eggs applies?<br/>

<br/>
We saw the start of the chick within a couple days of incubating our eggs. <br/>
Just a spot at first, then a web of blood vessels.<br/>
I remember seeing it very soon and it seems like it was just a little spot.<br/>
Of course these were incubated, fertilized eggs. Never candled a <br/>
non-fertilized one.  <br/>
The brown ones were almost impossible to see anything inside of when candling.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Anyone know how many years chickens reliably lay eggs for? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My SIL had Aracanas (sp?) that laid reliably for several years.  Chickens go <br/>
through a &quot;moulting&quot; period every year in which they either quit laying or <br/>
back off production by quite a bit. Once that period is past they start <br/>
laying their usual amount again.<br/>
We hatched some chicks a few years ago...three to be exact, and they are <br/>
still laying eggs.<br/>
The factory farming methods are very hard on the birds. And the crap they <br/>
feed the poor things comes through in the eggs (hormones and anti-biotics).<br/>
That&#39;s why I choose organic, free range eggs.<br/>
Sorry I can&#39;t give more detailed info. on how long they lay....I suppose it <br/>
varies according to breed. This is just some of my experience.<br/>
