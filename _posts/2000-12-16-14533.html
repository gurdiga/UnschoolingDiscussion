<div id="ygrps-yiv-813147487">I&#39;m fed up.  I seem to be turning into the kind of parent I never <br/>
wanted to be.  Fussing over the girls, basically bullying them into <br/>
tidying stuff up.  I feel impotent when I ask one of them to do <br/>
something and it doesn&#39;t get done, and I know that it&#39;s not good for <br/>
them or me or all of us, but I&#39;m at a loss.  I&#39;ve got the books (well, <br/>
not the Ross Campbell one Sue-in-Cyprus recommended last <br/>
time!) even been on the LLL &#39;Human Relations Enrichment <br/>
workshops, their Communicating with Children workshop is <br/>
basically the &#39;How to talk...&#39; book by Faber and Mazlish.  For some <br/>
reason I&#39;m not drawn back to these books, like I know them <br/>
already and reading them again isn&#39;t going to make much <br/>
difference.  The Adult Ed do parenting workshop classes, but I <br/>
already go to two classes and don&#39;t really have the money or want <br/>
to take the time out.  So I&#39;m wondering if anyone knows of an <br/>
online equivalent, a weekly scheduled chat with a &#39;workshop-leader&#39; <br/>
in residence.  Does anyone think this would work, even?<br/>
<br/>
Any help gratefully received!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Tracy,<br/>
<br/>
I feel for you.  I have been there and am still there<br/>
some days although cleaning isn&#39;t an issue because my<br/>
kids are still very young.... I wonder if what would<br/>
help is to think about the issue of chores/cleaning<br/>
and what that brings up from your past?  For me its<br/>
every time I walk into the kitchen and its a mess.  I<br/>
relive how I had to do the kitchen all of the time<br/>
even though my sister and I were supoosed to trade<br/>
every other week.  So I think there are your issues to<br/>
the cleaning. Then there are whatever your kids feel<br/>
about cleaning.  Maybe they just don&#39;t see it the way<br/>
you do or is it clear what needs to be done? Find a<br/>
way to break out of the box and see what the real<br/>
problem is. <br/>
<br/>
And ...I just finished reading Learning at Home by<br/>
Marty Layne. She said you will have a messy house when<br/>
you homeschool.  Realize you are bringing home the<br/>
craft projects, creative play and no custodian to<br/>
clean up after it all.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-725643606">Yes, I know I need to step out of the box, but that&#39;s <br/>
what I think I need help with, also just reaffirming <br/>
that what I&#39;ve read before and agreed wiht actually <br/>
works, taking personalitites into account anyway, even <br/>
if I&#39;m not always following it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-128523423">Thanks, Shelley.  I have a problem with Liedloff&#39;s <br/>
work, as well-intentioned as it may be, because others <br/>
have found that the Yequana didn&#39;t do things exactly <br/>
how she says in that book!  According to an English <br/>
writer, Deborah Jackson, she left bits out, so that us <br/>
Western parents didn&#39;t get the impression that we could <br/>
do them too!  Mrs Jackson found this out while <br/>
researching her own books on co-sleep and &#39;relaxed&#39; <br/>
parenting.  Believe me, my children are not the entire <br/>
centre of my attention, though they may be used to it <br/>
from others who they deal with alot... hmmm, words may <br/>
have to be had...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Tracy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744599666">Dear Tracy, <br/>
    Writing this e-mail has been very helpful to me. It&#39;s been a good <br/>
reminder to myself. I&#39;ve been really struggling with remembering my skills <br/>
and dealing with my emotional reactions lately as all of my kids are now in <br/>
different stages of adolescence at ages 11,15 & 19...so thanks! -Amalia-    <br/>
<br/>
    When the skills just aren&#39;t kicking in, I find it&#39;s time to delve into <br/>
the emotions, to find out what unresolved feelings from my childhood are <br/>
being triggered. I don&#39;t know if you want another book recommendation but a <br/>
really good one is &quot;When your child drives you crazy&quot; by Eda LeShan.  There&#39;s <br/>
a lot in this book about the emotional experience of parenting and the <br/>
specific ways we get triggered. Here are some notes:<br/>
<br/>
There are really only a handful of important attitudes and skills essential <br/>
to parenting. The catch is that those comprise some of the most profound and <br/>
courageous challenges we can ever give ourselves; they have to do with our <br/>
ability and our willingness to grow and change all the days of our <br/>
lives...Nothing in nature is more complex, more mysterious, than human <br/>
beings... We need to examine those times when our children &quot;drive us crazy.&quot; <br/>
This often occurs when they do things that we were not allowed to do when we <br/>
were children ... when they are not as repressed as we were...when they won&#39;t <br/>
do things that we were forced to do when we were children; because we are <br/>
green with envy.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When you become a parent it is your biggest chance to grow again. You have <br/>
another crack at yourself.&quot; -Fred Rogers-</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333085093">This is interesting, because in fact the opposite is <br/>
true, I wasn&#39;t expected to do much at home, and in fact <br/>
resent that, daft as it sounds.  It meant that I grew <br/>
up with a very negative attitude to work.  Now I <br/>
realise that I&#39;m now doing the same thing to my <br/>
children but the other way up.  The end result will <br/>
still be the same, they aren&#39;t going to want to do <br/>
stuff which smacks of &#39;work.&#39;  I hope that one thing I <br/>
do (though I do struggle, and having one conversation <br/>
with my mother reminds me why) is allow my children to <br/>
express their feelings and acknowledge them.  I try to, <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
