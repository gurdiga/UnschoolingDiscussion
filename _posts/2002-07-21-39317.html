 </span></blockquote>Life definitely is good outside of the corporate world. Different and<br/>
sometimes difficult but definitely good. We have corporate free-lance<br/>
jobs we just don&#39;t have corporate lifestyles. That in itself is worth<br/>
an extra 15 years of good health and a happy life.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, don&#39;t I know it! I&#39;ve been out of the corporate world for 13 years and <br/>
couldn&#39;t be happier with my choice. Now it&#39;s time to get Jon home as well. <br/>

Life is good.<br/>
