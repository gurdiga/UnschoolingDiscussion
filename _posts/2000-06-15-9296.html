<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928773728">We are in NJ and here are a few things that we thought of...<br/>
<br/>
Delaware Water Gap (Northern NJ)<br/>
Statue of Liberty<br/>
Liberty State Park<br/>
Garden State Aquarium (Southern NJ)<br/>
Wildwood/Cape May at the Shore (Cape May also has a zoo) or Barnegat Light <br/>
(old lighthouse)<br/>
Washington Crossing Park (not much to write home about, but it is the place <br/>
on the Delaware River that Washington crossed during the Revolutionary war <br/>
to defeat the Hessians, there are historical displays across the river in <br/>
PA)<br/>
Also, the Philadelphia Zoo (which is in PA) is one of the oldest zoo&#39;s in <br/>
the country (very nice)<br/>
Northlandz (the largest toy train layout in the world with a working &quot;mini&quot; <br/>
steam engine that takes kids around a track, also has a doll museum attached <br/>
for same admission)  This is in Flemington, NJ Hunterdon County.<br/>
Hunterdon County itself is a beautiful place with lots of farmland and old <br/>
houses (the house I grew up in is over 200 years old, as is the elementary <br/>
school that I went to which is in Stockton, NJ, about 20 minutes from <br/>
Flemington.  My elementary school is one of the oldest left in the country.  <br/>
We got to visit the Whitehouse in 1977? because of it and present President <br/>
Carter with a picture of our school)<br/>
Colligan&#39;s Inn in Stockton which is the restaurant that the song &quot;There was <br/>
a hotel with a wishing well...&quot; was written for, also very old.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Trenton, NJ is the state capital and one of the oldest cities in <br/>
the country.  Lots of history there.  A beautiful state house, a museum and <br/>
old revolutionary war barracks all within one block.  We are close to <br/>
Trenton where we live now.<br/>
<br/>
Griffith Morgan house in Pennsauken, NJ is one of the oldest houses in NJ.  <br/>
(may be the oldest house in NJ, kind of hard to find, unless you know where <br/>
it is.  Of course, my husband does know where it is, so he could give you <br/>
directions if you are interested)  Also, close to the aquarium and the <br/>
aquarium in across the river from the Philadelphia Zoo.<br/>
<br/>
Princeton, NJ is a really cool town.  (About 20 minutes from Trenton)Albert <br/>
Einstein lived there.  They shot the film I.Q. there.  You can tour <br/>
Princeton University campus.  Their library is famous and they have a great <br/>
art museum which is open to the public.  It is also home to black squirrels <br/>
which aren&#39;t found anywhere else in the U.S.  They were imported from <br/>
England because the University was based on Cambridge U and they had black <br/>
squirrels on campus (they are also very friendly as they are used to being <br/>
around people).  Also, a lot of history in Princeton (an old grave yard, <br/>
homes, etc.)  Also home to Princeton Theological Seminary school (right next <br/>
to the University) The Annex is a must eat at place, it is in a basement, <br/>
but has been around a very long time and they have pictures on the walls of <br/>
all of the famous and historical people who have dined there.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I know that is a novel and we are still trying to think if there is <br/>
anything else.  Of course, Philadelphia is filled with historical stops <br/>
((Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, Elfreth&#39;s Alley (old cobblestone street <br/>
with original houses, can tour them))  I could probably go on forever, so I <br/>
won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and I wish we were going with you.  It sounds like great fun.  If <br/>
you want to say &quot;Hi&quot; when you get to NJ, just let us know...<br/>
<br/>
Bonnie<br/>

&gt;Hello all! We&#39;re going to embark on a new stage of our homeschooling<br/>
&gt;journey! On Feb 1, 2001 our family is going to travel the 48 states<br/>
&gt;in a motor home! Our family includes myself, Aimee 28 yrs. old, my<br/>
&gt;husband Mark, 33 and our 2 daughters, Alexandria (age 7) and Tabitha<br/>
&gt;(1 1/2).<br/>
&gt;Our plan is to spend about a week in each state. The reason I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;writing is we&#39;d love to hear from homeschoolers in other states about<br/>
&gt;what are some &quot;don&#39;t miss&quot; activities in your area/state, also we&#39;d<br/>
&gt;love to hear about what&#39;s unique to your area.<br/>
&gt;Homeschoolers seem to often have great ideas that aren&#39;t listed in<br/>
&gt;&quot;guide books&quot;!<br/>
&gt;We&#39;re not looking for amusement parks, one thing we&#39;re doing for sure<br/>
&gt;are staying with Omish friends in Indiana so that we can really<br/>
&gt;experience their life. I&#39;m looking for any ideas along this line!<br/>
&gt;Thank you so much for your help in this matter! Please contact me at<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-355009174">Well, it could take quite a while to just drive from one end of CA to the<br/>
other but in our litle neck of the &quot;woods,&quot; we literally have the real<br/>
woods.  If you should decided to head down through CA from the Oregon end,<br/>
take 101.  A must stop is a wide spot in the road called Orick.  Roosevelt<br/>
Elk have the right of way on the freeway (well, so it is a nice two lane<br/>
highway, it is still called a freeway &lt;g&gt;) and they are always grazing by<br/>
the side of the road.  A right towards the ocean brings you out at Fern<br/>
Canyon where Lost World was filmed.  About 45 miles south you will come to<br/>
Trinidad and Patrick&#39;s Point State Park (btw, you can buy a year&#39;s pass and<br/>
stay in all the state parks free after the initial fee) where there is an<br/>
authentic Native American village built by Native Americans (not teepees!)<br/>
and Agate Beach.  Further down the coast you come to Eureka where you will<br/>
find the Carson Mansion, the most photographed single family residence<br/>
(castles don&#39;t get into this category) in the world.  The next side trip<br/>
you want to take is to Ferndale, &quot;The Victorian Village, site of many<br/>
movies including &quot;Outbreak&quot; and &quot;Salem&#39;s Lot.&quot;  Continue south to the<br/>
turnoff at Pepperwood which is the old highway.  There are several camping<br/>
spaces along this 100 mile stretch.  The tallest and oldest trees are found<br/>
here--Coastal redwoods, many of them over 300&#39; tall.  You drive right<br/>
between them on a road that was contructed to their needs so it is rather<br/>
squiggly, as the kidlets put it but not too bad as it is a regular on the<br/>
motorhome route.  You can see the Grandfather Tree which stands at almost<br/>
300&#39;.  It has survived a lightning strike, 64&#39; flood waters, human&#39;s<br/>
attempting to cut it down and a fire.  In each and every one of the<br/>
pull-offs and parks in this National Forest if you sit quietly jays and<br/>
chipmunks will come right up to the kids and you can see river otters and<br/>
deer within 10 to 20 feet of you.  You could also take a side trip to<br/>
Shelter Cove, also known as the Lost Coast and home of the black sand<br/>
beaches.<br/>
<br/>
Then onward in a southerly direction through Mendocino County.  You might<br/>
want to take a side trip to Fort Ross where the Russians had a settlement. <br/>
 And then into Sonoma County (wineries by the dozens if you like) and in<br/>
Petaluma is Vallejo&#39;s fort and in the city of Sonoma (a left off of 101 to<br/>
the east) is Vallejo&#39;s home.  Again, southward bound and in about an hour<br/>
you are in San Francisco.  Now, you will have to decide just how many days<br/>
you want to spend in the greater Bay Area with sites such as the usual with<br/>
the Zoo, Exploratorium, Aquarium, Japanese Gardens, etc. and such sites as<br/>
the Crookedest Road in the World, the Cliff House and a million and one<br/>
other things to do in SF, not counting Tilden Park (NOT an amusement park!)<br/>
in the Berkeley hills, Jack London Square in Oakland, the Oakland Zoo where<br/>
you can take a sky tram over the different animal areas (feels like they<br/>
can reach up and touch your feet) and then on to San Jose for the<br/>
Winchester House.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are lots of folks in Central and Southern CA and folks from<br/>
the Valley that can add even more goodies that aren&#39;t amusement park type<br/>
things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997291422">Nebraska checking in here....a few things that are wonderful here, besides<br/>
the people of course!<br/>
<br/>
Ashfalls fossil bed.  It is being actively worked.<br/>
Homestead national monument.  A real old homestead, preserved to show how<br/>
poineers lived.<br/>
Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha.  The Lied Jungle is wonderful!<br/>
Ponca State Park.  There is a spot where you can see South Dakota, Iowa, and<br/>
Nebraska, and the whole park is beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Just driving across the state is neat, because the topography changes so<br/>
drastically, from the Badlands in the west to the rolling hills in the east.<br/>
