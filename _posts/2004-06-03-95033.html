I think  being more respectful of the child is a huge jump because <br/>
most parents  think what they are doing is respectful.  I got in a <br/>
huge  &quot;discussion&quot; on a pre-unschooling list about not controlling tv <br/>
and  food.  I said I didn&#39;t control these things because I respected <br/>
my  son as a whole person who knew what he wanted and needed.  Many of  <br/>
the other posters got really upset about this and said that they  <br/>
respected their kids too and that that was why they controlled what  <br/>
they ate and watched.  I said that wasn&#39;t respect, that was distrust  <br/>
and control.  <br/>
<br/>
So maybe different people have different  definitions of what respect <br/>
is?  To me telling a person what to do  with no regard to what that <br/>
person wants isn&#39;t respect.  But many  people in that discussion <br/>
thought what I was doing wasn&#39;t respectful  because I was letting my <br/>
son eat candy if he wanted it and therefore  letting him poison his <br/>
body.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up unsubbing from the group  after being called many names.  I <br/>
did explain many times hat my son  is not living in a vacuum with his <br/>
choices, that I had a lot of input, but  they just couldn&#39;t seem to <br/>
believe it.  They thought I was  negligent.  So is there a way to get <br/>
people to see that controlling  isn&#39;t respectful?  Can controlling <br/>
someone be respectful?   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
SEE?????? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is supposed to be an unschooling list for people with <br/>
preschoolers.  In reality they spend most of their time comparing <br/>
curriculums.  Someone who thought it was actually an unschooling list <br/>
(like it says in the description) brought up the no limits thing <br/>
looking for ideas on how it works.  Turns out only a few people on <br/>
the list thought it could work, me being the most vocal of the few <br/>
people.  <br/>
<br/>
My point in bringing it up was the respecting children thing.  I <br/>
think many parents think they are respecting their children by <br/>
controlling them.  How can we help people see that isn&#39;t respect?  <br/>
Should we even try? Do we (meaning unschoolers) just have totally <br/>
different definitions of respect?  Is it possible to respect someone <br/>
while controlling them?  <br/>
<br/>
I found out even suggesting someone isn&#39;t being respectful to their <br/>
children brings out a lot of hostility.<br/>

It&#39;s usually really quiet, but yeh, there was an...intense discussion <br/>
with a lot of people who have not (yet) signed on for letting go of <br/>
controling tv, food etc. <br/>
<br/>
I remember Sandra posting something (here, that is) about <br/>
homeschooling not being for people who feel it necessary to control <br/>
certain aspects of life. And if you believe that much of the food <br/>
supply is extremely harmful, even if eaten once, you&#39;re not going to <br/>
let your kids decide what to eat!<br/>

<br/>
       Pre-unschooling sounds more like someone perhaps deschooling as <br/>
preparation for unschooling.  Just linguistically I mean.  JJ<br/>
