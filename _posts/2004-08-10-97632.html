<div id="ygrps-yiv-996618367">Kelly, you&#39;re right on when you say:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve come to unschooling by examining<br/>
other educational  <br/>
options. Weeded through them, looked at the pros and<br/>
cons, objectively <br/>
made some  <br/>
JUDGMENT on what the best way to learn is.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is exactly how I came to unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Kristina, you say:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I guess for me <br/>
it&#39;s easier to refrain from judging outsiders, whose<br/>
decisions don&#39;t <br/>
really affect you in any way, than making judgments on<br/>
my own kid&#39;s <br/>
choices. <br/>
 <br/>
It may be *easier* for you, but that doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
it&#39;s the better choice.  And, like it or not,<br/>
&quot;outsiders&#39;&quot; decisions DO affect us all.  For example,<br/>
my partner is in favor of us sending our two sons to<br/>
the Eugene Waldorf School. *sigh*  He knows ALL these<br/>
cool, &quot;well adjusted&quot; kids who went there and are now<br/>
in a good college.  He has serious reservations about<br/>
our boys being unschooled.  He&#39;s met quite a few kids<br/>
who have been &quot;homeschooled&quot; (he doesn&#39;t know if<br/>
they&#39;ve been &#39;unschooled&#39;, but to him it&#39;s the same<br/>
thing although BELIEVE me, I&#39;m working on him...) and<br/>
he says they are &#39;lost&#39;, didn&#39;t get a good education,<br/>
their parents were too lax and gave them too much<br/>
freedom (??).  SO, all these &#39;outsiders&#39; decisions are<br/>
affecting our family big time!  Although I can respect<br/>
my partner&#39;s opinions and understanding (however<br/>
limited) of the Waldorf Education, and<br/>
&#39;homeschooling&#39;/unschooling, darn right I judge it! <br/>
Has he done enough research? (No.)  Are his opinions<br/>
educated? (Not enough for me.)  Yes I can listen<br/>
respectfully, but I can also disagree and judge his<br/>
opinions.  All this, and still love him too.<br/>
<br/>
Vijay, in your last post you comment:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But this is Goethe&#39;s theory, not Steiner&#39;s. Did<br/>
Steiner claim to have <br/>
discovered this himself?&quot;<br/>

This is very interesting, can you point to a resource?<br/>
 I have very limited knowledge of Goethe, and don&#39;t<br/>
remember any &#39;color theory&#39; of his, but would love to<br/>
know.  I don&#39;t know if Steiner &#39;claimed&#39; to have<br/>
discovered this &#39;color theory&#39;.  All that I have read<br/>
about it has been in terms of it&#39;s application and not<br/>
origins.  As is with the majority of Steiner&#39;s<br/>
writings.  If someone knows and/or can point us/me to<br/>
specific sources that address the origins of any of<br/>
his theories, that would be VERY helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-127377740">From the intro to &quot;Hello Red Fox&quot; a children&#39;s book about complementary <br/>
colors by Eric Carle.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749 - 1832) is celebrated as a great <br/>
German poet, novelist, and philosopher, but to him, his color theory was <br/>
his most important achievement.<br/>
<br/>
One evening, about two hundred years ago, Goethe stopped at a tavern to <br/>
dine As he sat at his table, he gazed at the waitress who stood taking <br/>
an order at a nearby table. Her red dress stood out in sharp contrast to <br/>
the white wall behind her. When the waitress moved away, Goethe <br/>
continued to stare in the same direction at the wall.<br/>
Then a strange thing happened: on the white wall he saw a faint glowing <br/>
image of the waitress&#39;s dress -- but it was green not red! Why? This <br/>
moment of wonder led Goethe into more than twenty years of research on <br/>
color.<br/>
<br/>
In 1810 he published Farbenlehre, his color theory. He determined that <br/>
there are three primary colors -- red, blue, and yellow -- from which <br/>
all other colors could be made, and that each color had an opposite or <br/>
complementary color.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cool, huh?<br/>
