<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126499090">I just have to ask you - is Sorcha your real name??  I have only known one other &quot;Sorcha&quot; and I always loved that name (once I heard it).  How do you pronounce yours??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-220851198">It&#39;s Sorcha Aisling.  My mom, who doesn&#39;t actually speak Irish <br/>
Gaelic, believes it&#39;s Irish Gaelic for something like &quot;bright dancing <br/>
faery woman&quot;. I&#39;ve looked it up (I don&#39;t speak Gaelic either, though <br/>
I&#39;ve watched Muzzy &lt;g&gt;) and it might mean something like &quot;bright <br/>
dream&quot; or &quot;bright vision&quot;.  Sorcha rhymes with orca and Aisling <br/>
sounds like Ashleen.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A story from Sunday School. Today&#39;s lesson began with the leader <br/>
asking if anyone spoke a foreign language. He said &quot;anyone speak <br/>
Irish?&quot; L thinking the Irish speak English with an accent. My 15 year <br/>
old raised her hand and said &quot;Good morning&quot; in Gaelic (okay!!! I <br/>
know!!! Gaelic isn&#39;t actually Irish) Everyone was duly impressed, <br/>
including my own self. :)<br/>
