&lt;&lt; Even though I know they are not, it seems more effective to state the <br/>
results we get using classical homeopathy (or sticking to one single <br/>
path/practice/guru on a spiritual<br/>
 journey, for example) and let them decide. The proof is in the pudding, as <br/>
they say, and IMO learning and acceptance have to come from within. Otherwise <br/>
I feel like we are just imposing our thoughts and experience on others. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but would you act the same way if they had already come to you, were <br/>
already part of a homeopathic group (or more acurately a discussion group on <br/>
homeopathy) and ignore things that were blatantly in opposition to homeopathy?<br/>
It&#39;s a bit different when a person comes to a discussion group about a topic, <br/>
posts things in opposition to the philosophy and gets questioned on it.<br/>
I don&#39;t go around irl, telling people that what they are doing is not <br/>
unschooling, they wouldn&#39;t care. Not even other homeschoolers.<br/>
But if they willingly enter into a discussion on the topic, I feel I then <br/>
have the right to give my honest opinion and question things in direct <br/>
conflict.<br/>
