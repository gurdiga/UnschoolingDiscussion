<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338392018">But does anyone on this list have a copy of Randall Kennedy&#39;s book on<br/>
called  Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word. (sorry, I do find<br/>
it hard to even write this, but the book sounds like a great read. I saw Mr.<br/>
Kennedy on a book review program and he was so interesting I find myself<br/>
really wanting to read his works) If you do, do you, are you willing to sell<br/>
it to me? For how much? Trade? For what...<br/>
<br/>

d=1) (For some reason it says out of stock but there&#39;s one listed. And there<br/>
are some hardbacks. (Click on Other Editions.) I&#39;ve bought a lot of things<br/>
through there (sold things too!) and have never had any problems.<br/>

Amazon sells used also. Their shipping tends to be a bit higher and it<br/>
doesn&#39;t tell you right up front the way Half.com does.<br/>

A really good site is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.abebooks.com/">http://www.abebooks.com/</a> They search a bunch of used<br/>
sites and sort them by price.<br/>
