<div id="ygrps-yiv-141582854">Yes, Katy...My own MIL kept telling us after we had two children that I had better go out and get a real job.  She thinks she is protecting me from the mistakes she made.  Excuse me, it&#39;s about choices and doing what I enjoy and find satisfaction in right?  We now have three blessings and a successful work from home business that I love and allows me to support and encourage my kids in their learning endeavors-but in her eyes that doesn&#39;t count.  We have given up on even trying to explain unschooling to her because she just doesn&#39;t get it.  I find it amusing that my husband&#39;s grandmother who was a public school teacher, is the only one in the family that is supportive of our unschooling lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s another thing.  In college, staying home and being a full-time mother was never presented as an option and was pretty much looked down upon.  Which was difficult for me, because deep down in my heart I knew that I wanted to be a full-time mother and not an advertising executive.  My major was Communication Studies..Public Relations and Professional Writing...<br/>
<br/>
Okay..I am just babbling now..sorry ;)<br/>
<br/>
Living Joyfully,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-31775826">I don&#39;t know if it is the women&#39;s movement&#39;s fault.  I think it is the<br/>
men&#39;s movement that said women are to be seen and not heard and are to be<br/>
pregnant and barefoot and dress, act and live for the man.  If other<br/>
women misunderstand why I&#39;m at home when I love to be at home, it is<br/>
because they have a negative image of a woman staying at home.  When they<br/>
see me at home even though it causes financial troubles, they think I am<br/>
lazy and irresponsible.  But I say, &quot;I am me and you are you.&quot;  If they<br/>
want to not be home, then God bless &#39;em.  If they work because they feel<br/>
coerced to, then God help &#39;em to realize there is another way,<br/>
individualized to them.  I know right now that if I want to work, I can<br/>
work it into my schedule.  I don&#39;t have to work 9 to 5.  Been there, done<br/>
that, hated that.  My determination to do what seems right in my heart<br/>
for me and for us as a family has led me to see the options that are<br/>
there for me.  I know I could work swing or graveyard part time.  I&#39;ve<br/>
been there done that too.  It was better than 9 to 5, but not best for<br/>
me.  I have a plan. When my kids go to college, so will I.  My 14 year<br/>
old is saving his money for college.  He is presently pursuing a job<br/>
working 24 hours a week.  He has a state form to give to his employer to<br/>
send to the state, saying it is legal for him to work 24 hours a week. <br/>
He was working with his Dad, but said he wanted a steady job with steady<br/>
pay.  He wants to be an architectural engineer.  He has plans.  My plan<br/>
is, once my kids are away from home, I want to go to college, then work<br/>
in the field of my choice and save all my money, except for a percentage<br/>
for spending, on retirement.  That&#39;s because my husband doesn&#39;t think of<br/>
the future.  But why should I lose my glorious present to ensure a safe<br/>
future?  I will wait until I am ready, then I will go back to work.  I<br/>
have had weekend jobs and part time jobs.  And the truth is, it was never<br/>
in the field of my choice, because I did what was expected of me instead<br/>
of following my dreams.  I want to give my children the opportunity to<br/>
follow their dreams rather than sit in a rigid school environment<br/>
learning to keep status quo and follow the leader.<br/>
It&#39;s late and I may be rambling.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
<br/>
It was hard for the education- and career-oriented movement to laud <br/>
housewives.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it was unforseen.  For those who were old enough to be <br/>
cognizent (I was a teen) when it was first happening, they were TRULY up <br/>
against the Archie Bunkers of the earth.  &quot;I don&#39;t mind my wife having a job <br/>
as long as the house is clean and my dinner&#39;s on the table&quot; was not a joke.  <br/>
It was real.   And women in the sciences were being treated very badly.  I <br/>
have a friend who got a master&#39;s degree in engineering around 1980 and went <br/>
to work at Sandia National labs.  She was 30is, working with a bunch of 50 <br/>
and 60 year old men, mostly ex-military, and they ignored her, belittled her, <br/>
asked her to do girl-jobs (the secretarial end of their project&#39;s work) and <br/>
to get them food, at first.  When she pointed out &quot;engineer,&quot; they just kind <br/>
of ignored her for a while.  Forgot to invite her to meetings.  That was just <br/>
20 years ago.  They would have felt they had &quot;won&quot; if she had gone home to <br/>
stay with her child.<br/>
<br/>
The women&#39;s movement accomplished a LOT, lots more than most people realize.  <br/>
Many states (most, I think) in the 1970&#39;s didn&#39;t have any provision in law to <br/>
charge a married man with raping his wife.  In some places, rape was defined <br/>
as involving a woman not your spouse (in what exact phrasing in which states <br/>
I&#39;m not sure anymore, but I used to be able to discuss the local laws because <br/>
I worked in the rape crisis  center a while in college).   Young women who <br/>
hear that now find it hard to believe.  <br/>
<br/>
There were women then (one ironically made a good living at it) who said <br/>
women SHOULD stay home and do what their husband said, and just be <br/>
housewives.  So the lines were drawn there, with a political movement <br/>
opposing &#39;women&#39;s lib&#39; and calling for women to be subject to their husbands. <br/>
 That movement, of course, paid little to no attention to single women or <br/>
divorced or widowed women.  Their job was to have gotten a husband (and then <br/>
stay home).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-28512852">I am so glad that there were women who went before me (I&#39;m 32) and got<br/>
rid of some of the prejudice. My father is one of those Archie Bunker<br/>
types that did not allow my mom to have a job. She was miserable, he was<br/>
miserable, we were miserable. I think that if men were real men and took<br/>
care of things that they say they will, ie trash, chores, other matters<br/>
and if they actually paid attention to what was happening in their<br/>
family, ie only 4 slices of bread left so they volunteer to stop by and<br/>
pick some up or they actually notice that the 5 yr olds underwear is no<br/>
longer fitting so they go to the store and buy the correct size with out<br/>
anyone asking them then life for everyone would be much better and fewer<br/>
women would complain about not getting respect. I hope that didn&#39;t sound<br/>
too bad.<br/>
<br/>
I know a few women that complain about not getting any respect but they<br/>
do nothing to change the situation and of course their husbands are<br/>
living the easy life, no responsibilities at home, so they are not going<br/>
to change. If I can do one thing for my ds it will be to instill in him<br/>
the value of paying attention to life around him and having him know<br/>
that just because he is a man doesn&#39;t entitle him to have life revolve<br/>
around him.<br/>

to start over.  At that point they were concerned with education for<br/>
women (so they could learn to read) and with issues relating to men<br/>
and women - men basically owned the women in their families.  Read<br/>
about the Seneca Falls conference which Elizabeth Cady Stanton and<br/>
Susan B. Anthony put on.  Once women&#39;s suffragge was won (women were<br/>
not given the vote - women died in this country so other women could<br/>
vote) there was a collective sigh.  Enter the Great Depression followed<br/>

<br/>
As for what is happening now, it is too bad that the Movement has been<br/>
polarized into those who choose to work outside the home and those<br/>
who choose not to.  I wonder at times how much is by design and<br/>
manipulation.  In the 80s Betty Friedan wrote another book called<br/>
_The Second Stage_ and in it she discussed where the Movement should<br/>
go next.  It was to family rights - parent&#39;s rights - so for example <br/>
all parents could take time off to be with their children, not just <br/>
the pregnant parent.  From what I remember of that book it would be a <br/>
bit too much for the corporate mainstream to bear.  It questioned a lot<br/>
of the underlying assumptions of our culture - you know the &quot;buy more, <br/>
spend more, thus earn more&quot; philosophy.  Maybe if the mothers of the<br/>
US found their common interests and sat down to a dialog in a spirit<br/>
of cooperation, we might again change the world.  In my cynical at<br/>
times world view, I feel that the maintainers-of-the-status-quo<br/>
fear that more than almost anything!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643542798">Has anyone taken a good look at the general shift since the current occupant<br/>
of the White House arrived?  If you want a good example, watch some of the<br/>
shows like Talk Back where the topic is Andrea Yates, and I quote, &quot;He was<br/>
doing his job by going to work and supporting his family.  Her family should<br/>
have been helping her.&quot;  This in response to the question of why he didn&#39;t<br/>
notice any problems or help out when he got home from work.  While this is<br/>
the quote from one man, it was the over whelming concensus of far too many.<br/>
<br/>
There is a whole segment of the population that has come out of the closet,<br/>
so to speak, making noise to send women back to &quot;barefoot and pregnant.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The whole Andrea Yates incident shows just how little the basic thinking of<br/>
far too many men AND women have changed.  The father is a fundamentalist<br/>
Xtian.  He wanted more children.  They were told not to have anymore.  He<br/>
insisted (per her brother).<br/>

If we had made any real progress he and the dimwitted doctor would be in<br/>

<h4>SAT1</h4>
<p><small><time>20 Mar 2002, at  6:17am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-60492975">Lynda, there are way to many men out there that have absolutely no<br/>
respect for women. They only make appropriate noises about women&#39;s<br/>
rights when forced to do so. Upon returning to work 5 years ago after<br/>
having my first child I was told &quot;Had you not taken maternity leave you<br/>
would have gotten a better rating.&#39; I worked through half my maternity<br/>
leave, writing and running programs for people and my boss knew about<br/>
this but still since I had taken maternity leave I did not deserve to<br/>
get a better rating. This was a large company, employing over 45,000<br/>
people at the time. My brother and father are still more like Archie<br/>
Bunker than anyone else I can think of.<br/>
<br/>
I also am a Christian and regularly attend church. There are a number of<br/>
men that are totally and completely stuck on themselves and can &#39;t even<br/>
have a decent conversation with a woman because they are MEN (beat chest<br/>
like ape while saying). I refuse to allow them to dictate to me how I<br/>
decide to worship. I know of a few people who have quit going to church<br/>
because of this but I am going to stay there in their face and not quit<br/>
doing something that I love just because some men are pigheaded. I have<br/>
studied women in the Bible and how men really should act if they are<br/>
Christians so I know that women really are not to be treated as badly as<br/>
most church going men treat them. But back to the original point, many<br/>
men in the church environment would be happy if women would be totally<br/>
quite little lumps that were only available to do work that was &#39;fit for<br/>
a woman&#39; as they see it.<br/>
<br/>
Another area that is not directly connected to women but discrimination<br/>
in general is the fact that there are still a large number of white<br/>
people who will say in public that they are not racist but they really<br/>
are. They won&#39;t say a word as long as they think a person from another<br/>
race can hear them but in &#39;mighty white&#39; circles they make comments that<br/>
are racist. I don&#39;t think the women&#39;s movement will get anywhere if the<br/>
non-racist movement can&#39;t get anywhere. The people that I associate with<br/>
that are more into unschooling aren&#39;t racist but I have met a few<br/>
homeschooling families that made comments that were definitely racist. I<br/>
think that real progress that can not be changed by voting someone new<br/>
into the white house will take centuries not decades because of the<br/>
underground current of discrimination that is there but is not voiced<br/>
unless in a &#39;safe&#39; environment.<br/>

I don&#39;t know about other places but in Texas you can only commit people if<br/>
they are an immediate danger to themselves or others, as in making threats<br/>
or engaging in very dangerous behavior.  Being psychotic is not grounds to<br/>
be committed.  I haven&#39;t heard whether or not she was willing to go to the<br/>
hospital.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a good question... another one I would like to know is *if Russell Yates & his mother both felt she really needed to be hospitalized, WHY would they instead back off on helping her?? It makes absolutely no sense... she is not well, she is acting very strangely - so hey let&#39;s give her an hour in the morning by herself so she doesn&#39;t feel like Russell&#39;s mother is interfering? It just sounds like another reason why he should be in there just as much as she should.<br/>

You have access to very detailed information about this case that doesn&#39;t<br/>
appear to be covered in the Texas newspapers.  Like most homeschoolers, I am<br/>

along with interviews of the husband and his mother.  ALL agreed that when<br/>
she went in and hubby asked to have her admitted that she asked for the<br/>
papers to sign to be admitted.<br/>
<br/>
Having worked in an acute psych facility, I have closely followed this case<br/>
to see if TX would do what it does so well and completely ignore prior<br/>
medical history.<br/>

Possibly.  My point in the other analogies is that we do not know the entire story.  What things look like in hindsight and what they look like in day to day living are often very different.  What we have been hearing in the media is the family putting a spin on things to try to keep Mrs. Yates from getting the death penalty.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599430456">Okey dokey, here&#39;s the chronology:<br/>
<br/>
1989 -- they met<br/>
1993 -- they married<br/>
1994 -- first child<br/>
         -- first &quot;vision&quot; about a knife<br/>
1995 -- second child<br/>
1997 -- third child<br/>
1999 -- fourth child (February)<br/>
         -- suicide attempt with 40/50 Trazodon (June)<br/>
         -- 6 day hospital admission<br/>
         -- chart reads &quot;Doesn&#39;t want to die but wants the misery to go<br/>
away.&quot;<br/>
         -- starts to scratch herself bald<br/>
         -- found in BATHTUB with knife to neck (July)<br/>
         -- admitted to psych hospital in catatonic state, 3 week admission<br/>
         -- chart reads &quot;I had a fear I would hurt somebody, I thought it<br/>
better to end my own life and prevent it.&quot;  Reports hearing voices and<br/>
seeing visions of a knife.<br/>
<br/>
One interesting part is that her life as a wife and mother and through FOUR<br/>
pregancies were spent in a &quot;small house&quot; for their first year, followed by a<br/>
camper and then a Greyhound bus.<br/>
<br/>
Now, can you image being pregnant and having a infant/toddler to raise in a<br/>
camper?  Or having to go through a pregnancy with an infant and a toddler,<br/>
without air conditioning IN TEXAS in a Greyhound bus conversion OR how about<br/>
a fourth pregnancy with TWO toddlers and 1 infant?<br/>
<br/>
So, good ol&#39; Rusty notices, finally, that she is &quot;agitated and withdrawn,&quot;<br/>
&quot;feeling overwhelming anxiety and sadness.&quot;  So he moves them out of the bus<br/>
and into her mother&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;To help Andrea cope, Rusty bought a house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
2000 -- birth of fifth child (November)<br/>
2001 -- death of her father (March)<br/>
         -- irrational fear about youngest child begins<br/>
         -- taken to Devereux psych hospital, 12 day stay<br/>
         -- extreme weight loss<br/>
         -- May 4, Dr. told she was not eating or drinking and had again<br/>
been found with a full bathtub of water<br/>
         -- admitted for 10 days<br/>
         -- discharge notes read &quot;still depressed, still with suicidal<br/>
impulses<br/>
         -- June 4, Dr. d/c&#39;d Haldol, refused to readmit her, refused Haldol<br/>
shot<br/>
         -- few days later, Rusty&#39;s brother stated she &quot;barely spoke,&quot;<br/>
&quot;seemed indifferent&quot; and &quot;carried the baby around like a football or a loaf<br/>
of bread.&quot;<br/>
         -- June 20, mil doesn&#39;t show up in the a.m. and Andrea kills her<br/>
children.<br/>
         -- states to shrink that she thought Satan was living in her and<br/>
that both she and Satan needed to be punished.<br/>

I wonder if you are making judgments here based on YOUR lifechoices as<br/>
opposed to someone else&#39;s.  I am on a Homesteading Homeschoolers list where<br/>
people talk regularly of living in yurts with their children, or campers, or<br/>
houses made of straw bales.  So while the decision may seem bizarre to you,<br/>
it may not necessarily seem odd at all to others.<br/>
<br/>
So the suicide attempt was 2 years prior to the murders.......<br/>
<br/>
Most people with chronic psychotic conditions tend to look like they were<br/>
&quot;rode hard and put up wet.&quot;  Mrs. Yates&#39; appearance doesn&#39;t necessarily<br/>
indicate that her lifechoices were the problem with her appearance.<br/>
<br/>
I am not an advocate for any of the Yates&#39; family but I am not willing to<br/>
bet someone&#39;s life that we are getting the full story from the media.<br/>
<br/>
I also wonder about the religious aspects of it.  I am in no ways a<br/>
fundamentalist but if you look at that mindset, the Yates&#39; lives make a lot<br/>
of sense.  If I truly believed that God would not give me more than I could<br/>
bear....  If I truly believed that God would send his little blessings to us<br/>
as an indication of his will (number of children, etc.)....  If I truly<br/>
believed that people are basically evil and must be saved from<br/>
themselves.....  Yikes.  I was raised Southern Baptist and Church of the<br/>
Nazarene and these beliefs aren&#39;t even unusual in those circles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-532776770">She didn&#39;t make those choices and it would be hard on anyone to have all<br/>
those kids in 350 sq. ft at the most.<br/>
<br/>
Which doesn&#39;t change that all of them noticed that she had problems yet none<br/>
of them actually did anything to help her.  She had more than one suicide<br/>
attempt and some rather bizarre behaviors with bathtubs prior to the<br/>
drowning of the children.<br/>
<br/>
As to their religion, he is a fundie and their religious &quot;guru&quot; is known to<br/>
be a cult leader.  he has been investigated before.  And, no I can&#39;t<br/>
remember his name.  I&#39;ll blame it on mommy brain &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The thing is that all the various family members talk about how badly she<br/>
was doing yet they did nothing to help her.  MIL didn&#39;t show up that morning<br/>
or those babies might not have died.  AND, there is no way in H*LL that<br/>
doctor isn&#39;t big time responsible, even if you choose to think that hubby<br/>
isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I pity those children because sooooo many people simply looked the other<br/>
way!  I also feel sorry for her when so many cries for help went unanswered!<br/>

That&#39;s been one of my points in conversations about that situation.  To her <br/>
relatives, her beliefs would not have seemed symptoms of psychosis (about the <br/>
devil and her children&#39;s souls and such), and IF those are to be symptoms of <br/>
insanity in and of themselves, there are several million people in the U.S. <br/>
who could be locked up today.<br/>

(Many of them are maintaining homeschooling sites and warning people away <br/>
from other churches which don&#39;t condemn Harry Potter, etc...)<br/>
