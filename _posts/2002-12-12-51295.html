No one here is advocating not respecting yourself. I sleep when I&#39;m tired, <br/>
eat when I&#39;m hungry etc....and they can do the same.<br/>
I may have to give up sleep for one of them, that&#39;s part of the Mom job.<br/>

When you meet their needs, they aren&#39;t feeling needy about being read to, or <br/>
played with or any other number of things.<br/>
So when you say &quot;I can&#39;t do anymore&quot; they are ok with that usually. You are <br/>
creating non-needy kids, that can handle other peoples needs very well.<br/>
This comes with maturity too, I sure don&#39;t expect the little guy to <br/>
undertstand that Mommy&#39;s tired in the middle of the night when he wants to <br/>
nurse.<br/>
Nor do I expect Sierra at five y.o. to understand my needs the way Trevor <br/>
(13) does.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight I told them I was getting tired and anyone that wanted me to lay down <br/>
with them needed to come now.<br/>
Sierra was building with Lincoln logs in the middle of the floor and ignored <br/>
me. I started to head back to the room with Jalen and Jared, she said &quot;oh, I <br/>
wanted to leave this up&quot;<br/>
I told her that if she put it out of the way so no one would step on it she <br/>
could leave it up as long as she wanted.<br/>
She decided to build it again tomorrow and put all the Lincoln logs in a bin.<br/>
I sat on Jalens bed reading stories, he loves his little board books. Pretty <br/>
soon I had all four kids around (and on) me.<br/>
Trevor drifted out after a minute and we read a couple of books and then <br/>
Sierra went to lay on my bed while I nursed Jalen to sleep.<br/>
Jared and I talked while Jalen nursed. Mostly he wanted me to tell him <br/>
stories of when my sisters and I were little.<br/>
He laughed a lot and asked for more. By the time Jalen was done nursing they <br/>
were both asleep.<br/>
I came out to Trevor organizing a cupboard in the kitchen and all the dishes <br/>
rinsed.<br/>
No one asked him to clean up....he just did.<br/>
When asked why he organized the cupboard the answer was &quot;it was really <br/>
bugging me&quot;.<br/>
I said &quot;Oh, then if I want things cleaned I just have to ignore them long <br/>
enough for it to be really, really bad and then you guys will do it for me?&quot;<br/>
He laughed and asked me to please not do that, he likes that I keep things <br/>
picked up for them and hugged me.<br/>
Then he went to bed, even though he has the option to play Nintendo, Gameboy, <br/>
read, eat, watch tv or any other number of  things.<br/>
<br/>
I like that I had this night to share in the midst of this discussion.....I <br/>
think it shows how kids that aren&#39;t feeling needy will consider everyone&#39;s <br/>
needs, not just their own.<br/>

 <br/>
Thank you for sharing your evening.<br/>
 <br/>
These are exactly the things I need to hear.       <br/>
 <br/>
IMO,  the personal limit thing is one of the biggest challenges when we choose to be homeschoolers and  unschoolers.    Especially for those of us who are new  to the unschooling and related philosophies.   I think for me I first heard no limits and then out went my own limits!        So talking about how to take care of ourselves is so beneficial.             I have to get into my mind that if I take care of myself I will also be much better at taking care of the kids,  duhhh....     but that is hard to remember.  Hopefully it will get easier and easier..<br/>
 <br/>
take care,<br/>
Kelli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-863209843">just a thought.. my 12 yo would like to stay up later than she <br/>
should --- and by &quot;should&quot; I mean that when she stays up much past 10:30 <br/>
on a regular basis, she&#39;s very weepy and irritable. We don&#39;t enforce a <br/>
bedtime, we simply point out to her that she&#39;s been weepy and grumpy and <br/>
maybe she&#39;s been staying up too late. Now, with her getting home from <br/>
play practice after ten pm, that isn&#39;t always practical. But we go with <br/>
the need for sleep and learning to listen to your own rhythms. Rules are <br/>
too much work. Rituals, guidelines, common sense seems to work just fine <br/>
for us.<br/>
<br/>
my two cents,<br/>
