<div id="ygrps-yiv-72083626">Love reading this thread. I am just now facing this step, Heidi <br/>
and want you to know tha tit does take some changed thinking to <br/>
be able to let go of math books and trust the process of math.<br/>
<br/>
I am one who grew up with a Dad who used to say that true <br/>
intelligence was shown in the maths and sciences (I, of course, <br/>
was getting As in English, history, foreign language and theater <br/>
arts)&gt; With a 3.85 in high school, I never felt smart. I had math <br/>
tutors my entire life.<br/>
<br/>
In elementary school, I remember learning the times tables and <br/>
racing to complete the pages in order to win an eraser. I won the <br/>
first two times. The third time, I finished first, got the special <br/>
eraser and then had the eraser stripped from me because I had <br/>
missed ever problem. We werre multiplying the 1s and 0s. I had <br/>
reversed them--1x2=1 and 0x2=2. Obviously I had no idea what i <br/>
was doing. i was trying to memorize and race.<br/>
<br/>
That experience was so devstating that I still remember saying to <br/>
myself, &quot;I will never be good at math. I am dumb.&quot; And lo and <br/>
behold, it has proven to be true! No amount of help has made <br/>
math more interesting, more pallatable, more &quot;user-friendly.&quot; I <br/>
have agonized for years over the fact that I can&#39;t balance a check <br/>
book (I know how, it just never works when I do it), I haven&#39;t had <br/>
my times tables down cold until now (nearly forty--I always forgot <br/>
whether 8x7=54 or 56.).<br/>
<br/>
A mathy-y engineer friend told me an interesting thing. She says <br/>
that in the race to &quot;master&quot; the times tables, we short circuit a <br/>
student&#39;s necessary process of proving to him/herself that 8x7 <br/>
really IS 56. We expect them to use tricks to remember the <br/>
answer instead of allowing for a slow and often times irregular <br/>
process of coming to fully believe in the answer (through <br/>
repeated trial and error, through counting on fingers, through <br/>
proving it over and over again) until we are convinced.<br/>
<br/>
No one can say &quot;At third grade you should be convinced that <br/>
3x3=9.&quot; The child will come to it when he/she does.<br/>
<br/>
All this to say, I have eased up on rote memorization and the use <br/>
of text books. I have one son (11) who is passionate about <br/>
astronomy and baking. He loves all the math related to these <br/>
things but is bored by his math book and says he doesn&#39;t like <br/>
math. It breaks my heart that I have created this damage! He is <br/>
the kind of kid who should (and I beleive will) love math simply <br/>
becuase of his natural interests.<br/>
<br/>
So we are backing off totally. Just last night he informed us of his <br/>
desire to start a business selling cookies. Ah! Math.<br/>
<br/>
Last thing: My oldest son (15) got more math out of Roller <br/>
Coaster Tycoon than any othe rcomputer game. he went on to a <br/>
rudimentary understanding of physics just from playing that <br/>
game ad nauseum... starting at age 10.<br/>
<br/>
Heidi, I&#39;ll keep you company while we take the leap, if you wwant. <br/>
It&#39;s scary to me, but I can at least look at my own experience and <br/>
know that the school methods failed me completely. I suppose <br/>
I&#39;m willing to take a different tack and hope for better results.<br/>
<br/>
(Btw, the way you described your daughter&#39;s journey into Middle <br/>
Earth is exactly how I have seen unschooling in our family. I also <br/>
required &quot;table time&quot; like you did. It is a new risk and adventure <br/>
for us to let it all go. I think if you have one success under your <br/>
belt of watching a child take off in learning, you will feel easier <br/>
about letting other things go. I know it&#39;s helped me. Good luck!)<br/>

I hope you didn&#39;t tell him that!!<br/>
<br/>
I would think it could as easily be law or biology.<br/>
What will happen if he isn&#39;t careful with his ingredients and he POISONS <br/>
someone?<br/>
Are there nuts in there?  How will he label them so vegans will know whether <br/>
they can eat them?<br/>
<br/>
(I wouldn&#39;t tell him that either, but I would think it all to myself. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

multiple intelligence<br/>

It will make you feel WAY better about yourself, and about your kids, and <br/>
will make you a better homeschooling parent on first glance, even, or with <br/>
one WHIFF of the idea that kinesthetic intelligence is as real and important <br/>
as logical/spatial or musical.<br/>

My kids &quot;did the times tables&quot; for cash one day.  And then again a week or <br/>
two later.  And then for fun with chalk on a big concrete slab.  And later <br/>
for fun on paper.<br/>
<br/>
But what they &quot;did&quot; was to fill numbers in on a grid from 1 to however many <br/>
fit (9 to 14 or so?) and down to ten or 11 the other way, and fill in the <br/>
easy ones first, and then the harder ones, and that exercise all by itself <br/>
with no explanatory comments from moms is WAY better than their memorizing <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the patterns is what the times tables are about.<br/>
It&#39;s a table of information.  A graph.  <br/>
The information doesn&#39;t exist on paper, or in memorized phrases like &quot;Five <br/>
times eight is forty.&quot;  It exists in the real world, in countable measurable <br/>
realities, and it exists in the incorporate air of ideas.  And it will be <br/>
discovered again by each person who is born UNLESS someone tells them it&#39;s a <br/>
think to learn a certain way by a certain age and they kill dead their <br/>
opportunity to discover it as happily as they would see their first butterfly <br/>
or their first snowflake.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-889885296">Thanks, Julie. I believe I will take you up on that offer, to take <br/>
the steps together....*gulp* Mine is going to be a slow process, most <br/>
likely. But I bet that isn&#39;t so uncommon. With a mother in her final <br/>
year of a public school teacher career, who supports my homeschooling <br/>
wholeheartedly (since she&#39;s been able to observe how bright my kids <br/>
are) and a MIL who was a school teacher, and HATES that we <br/>
homeschool...ah, well. I don&#39;t have to tell them &quot;we&#39;re unschooling&quot; <br/>
now, do I? LOL<br/>
<br/>
It must have been so traumatic to have that eraser/times table thing <br/>
happen. Public schools are SO damaging to children. how anyone <br/>
survives is beyond me. It took me years to recover from the things <br/>
I &quot;learned&quot; in school (None of it academic, btw. It was the social <br/>
aspects of school that killed me.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway. Thanks for a wonderful post, Julie! I&#39;m getting lots of food <br/>
for thought, here. <br/>
<br/>
blessings, Heidi<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My dad sent Simon (5 years old) a set of addition and a set of <br/>
subtraction flash cards for Christmas.  He is very concerned that <br/>
Simon be able to balance his checkbook when the time comes.  I went <br/>
through and ordered them numerically, so all of the 0 + X were <br/>
together, from 1 to 9, I think and the same with the subtraction.  I <br/>
put them away.  Simon asked later on to play them.  I held them and <br/>
he answered them &quot;0,1,2,3...&quot; repeating the counting as he went.  At <br/>
some point David (dh) grabbed one at random and flashed it at Simon <br/>
(I like the idea of flashcards producing flashers).  Simon explained <br/>
to him that we were doing it in order and that he didn&#39;t want to do <br/>
it at random.  We continued for a while and then built card houses <br/>
with them.  David and I had a long conversation about the value of <br/>
both methods.  I convinced him that understanding the additive <br/>
nature of numbers was at least equal to knowing how to count on your <br/>
fingers when presented with an equation.  And Simon didn&#39;t get <br/>
frustrated or feel stupid or overwhelmed.  He thought it was fun <br/>
until it wasn&#39;t.  <br/>
