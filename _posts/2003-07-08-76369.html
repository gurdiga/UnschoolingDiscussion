<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do breed occassionally (every couple of years or so).  There aren&#39;t many <br/>
&gt; people working on the herding genetics in Collies, so in order to find a dog <br/>
&gt; that will work the way I want it to, I pretty much have to &quot;make&quot; my own.  <br/>
&gt; (There are lots of breeders of working Border Collies, which I also have but <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t breed.)  Herding is my primary passion (other than my kids :-), I compete <br/>
&gt; actively at trials as well as using my dogs for farm work.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hullo Shelley, Nancy here, in central British Columbia. I am unschooling two <br/>
children here, but writing to you about dogs!! I lost my Belgian Tervuren a <br/>
year+ ago, and miss him desparately. I have been researching the smooth collie <br/>
as a possibility for our family, and would like to ask you some questions if <br/>
possible, could I contact you off list? Don&#39;t want to clog the list with my <br/>
doggy questions. They are many and boring for others I am sure.<br/>
Welcome to the list by the way, good to have you here!!<br/>
