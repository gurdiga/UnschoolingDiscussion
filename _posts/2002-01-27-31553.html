<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122266448"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Ren write:<br/>
&gt;In an unschool world, the idea of &quot;getting behind&quot; is nonexistant.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, precisely. There is no &#39;getting behind&#39; OR &#39;getting ahead&#39;. There <br/>
just &#39;is&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Tis better to supply an atmosphere that allows one to cultivate their <br/>
gifts, than to wonder what those gifts precisely are.<br/>
<br/>
And then you have the fears and insecurities of the parent that might not <br/>
have internal or external support. If all the women here that are with <br/>
their spouses for financial reasons left and started a commune, these <br/>
fears would dissapate. But then that would be absurb in reality wouldn&#39;t <br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
I trust my child a lot more than I trust myself. And on the rare times I <br/>
question him, I&#39;m really questioning myself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The person said she was not comparing her children to ps children, <br/>
&gt;nor imposing some false schedule on them.<br/>
&gt;That was a bit helpful to understand.<br/>
&gt;But then who are they being compared to if they can &quot;get behind&quot;.<br/>
&gt;I thought it was worthy of questioning.<br/>
&gt;I still think it is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed here. It is worthy of questioning and definately worthy of <br/>
bringing to the table for a good discussion. If the original poster wants <br/>
to bring this up again so we can all benefit from the talk, then please <br/>
do so!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And I am dumbfounded that questioning that premise would cause all of <br/>
&gt;this backlash.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh, it still can&#39;t be as bad as the &#39;coin lady&#39; on the spiritual list I <br/>
talked about earlier. THAT is the second one for the books.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m almost afraid to either bore you or scare you with my first one <br/>
*laughing*<br/>
<br/>
Let move forward and understand the thought process of what &#39;getting <br/>
behind&#39; means to some of us here.<br/>

<br/>
Ok, I&#39;ll bite.....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Getting behind&quot; means, to some, I think, &quot;the fear of what others will<br/>
think&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
Grandpa who quizzes your 8 year old on her addition facts.<br/>
The neighbor who is a retired teacher and thinks you&#39;re crazy.<br/>
Your homeschooling group &quot;friend&quot; who is skeptical of unschooling.<br/>
Your sister-in-law the second-grade teacher whose daughter read at age 3.<br/>
And even that voice inside your head from public school.<br/>
<br/>
I think the vast, vast majority of new homeschoolers/unschoolers have a fear<br/>
about &quot;what if it doesn&#39;t work&quot;....&quot;how will I know if it is working or<br/>
not?&quot;...&quot;what should I do if it doesn&#39;t seem to be working?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think the &quot;getting behind&quot; response could have validated the *fear* part<br/>
of the question....that part is a valid *feeling*.  It deserves respect.<br/>
I&#39;m not saying the questioner wasn&#39;t respectful--I already said that<br/>
earlier.....I&#39;m just saying that by acknowledging that a valid fear exists<br/>
for that person goes a long way toward positive communication.  Then the<br/>
original poster will be more receptive to what else you have to say.<br/>
