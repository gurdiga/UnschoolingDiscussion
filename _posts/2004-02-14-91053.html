This is really touching and true.  Thanks for sharing it.<br/>

another Mom standing near us that I hs my kids and then added she threatens her son <br/>
with hsing him if he doesn&#39;t behave (he&#39;s about 12). I looked at her and said <br/>
really? I used to threaten mine with going back to school (I never really <br/>
did) but I don&#39;t anymore cause I really like them at home. Later I thought that I <br/>
need to tell her the next time I see her that I never have to threaten my <br/>
kids with anything because we don&#39;t have any problems like that and that my kids <br/>
have not been grounded for years. <br/>
<br/>
I had not thought about that before, this lifestyle is really working good <br/>
for all of us.<br/>
