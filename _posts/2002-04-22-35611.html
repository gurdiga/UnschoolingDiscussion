The feeling of the book, some of the ideas, it just all seemed *off* to me. I don&#39;t recommend it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429587688">I&#39;m sorry to press you further, Camille, but can you be yet a little more <br/>
specific?  How do the ideas seem off?  What is the feeling that you got <br/>
from reading it.  Contrived?  I&#39;m curious because my 7yo son can be <br/>
explosive and frustrated and turn his anger inward and I&#39;m not sure how to <br/>
help him.  On the face of it, this book seems like it would offer some <br/>
insight, but I would also be interested in knowing what your objections to <br/>
it are.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t mind!  I truly appreciate your insight.  I&#39;m a little at <br/>
sea and concerned about my son.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I went and looked, it was a different book, not the Explosive Child.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whew -- I was worried that I was recommending something that I wouldn&#39;t even <br/>
agree with at all. So this one is the one that I remember really liking - I <br/>
carried it around and tried to talk about it with all my friends for a few <br/>
weeks. They put up with me &lt;g&gt;. My kids each asked me, one after another, if <br/>
I was reading that book because of them. Heck YEAH - they are ALL <br/>
explosive!!!! <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re all intense, creative, dramatic, high-energy kids. All have gone <br/>
through stages of easy frustration and being quick to throw a fit.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t know what it was like to have easy-going, laid-back kids, although <br/>
I must admit I&#39;ve imagined it MANY times &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to like the parenting books that put an emphasis on doing things that <br/>
strengthen the parent-child relationship. I do not like books that encourage <br/>
behaviorist sorts of manipulations and punishments or briberies (see my bias <br/>
showing?).<br/>
<br/>
The other parenting book I REALLY REALLY like is: &quot;The Parent-Teen <br/>
Breakthrough: The Relationship Approach&quot; by Mira Kirshenbaum. And I think <br/>
people should read it when the kids are pre-teens or younger - it applies <br/>
equally to those years, even though the examples are for older teens. Look at <br/>
this review from a reader (off Amazon) and tell me the last couple of lines <br/>
don&#39;t reflect how we unschoolers often feel:<br/>
****<br/>
I found this book browsing in a store. I have been referring to it for over a <br/>
year now and it has changed my relationship with my 15 and 16 year old. There <br/>
are no more fights over the little things in life, no more nagging. Just deep <br/>
concern for my children and the time we have together. When I tell my friends <br/>
of the theories in this book they think I am avoiding dealing with teen age <br/>
conflicts, but they will admit to arguing a lot in their homes. Sometimes I <br/>
think it&#39;s a gamble to practice this method, what if at the end of the teen <br/>
years it was not the way to parent? But the results now are so incredibly <br/>
rewarding, it almost imossible to think it is not the best way to go.<br/>
    ********<br/>

This post is intended to contribute to us understanding unschooling better or <br/>
to building a sense of community.<br/>

I just saw this book at the library today!<br/>
I was looking for The Teenage Liberation Handbook, just kinda <br/>
browsing for it and saw this book.  I thought, &quot;maybe in a few <br/>
years...&quot; (Kids are 11,8,5 and almost 3)<br/>
I&#39;ll pick it up the next time I&#39;m there.  Thanks!<br/>
Joanna- who also wouldn&#39;t know what to do with a calm, easy going <br/>
child and has often wondered about my fate(having been a calm and <br/>
easy going child).  I will try to find The Explosive Child too. <br/>
Thanks.</div>

I read the first few chapters and found it immensely helpful with my seven <br/>
year old son.  I would recommend it highly.  It was very affirming for me.  <br/>
