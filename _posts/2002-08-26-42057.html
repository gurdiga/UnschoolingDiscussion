Yes. Answering questions and discussing cultural and civilizational issues <br/>
play THE part in education. There is the possibility that such a discussion <br/>
might help home educators who read here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It might be of use. But I also think the list is heavily ladened at the<br/>
moment with two people who aren&#39;t unschooling children deciding what are and<br/>
what aren&#39;t worthwhile topics for this list.<br/>
<br/>
PamS brought up some especially well articulated points. Bob, while we do<br/>
discuss a wide range of topics here and the discussions can be very thought<br/>
provoking -- I&#39;ve certainly found unschooling parents to be among the most<br/>
interesting people to discuss things with -- that isn&#39;t the purpose of this<br/>
list. Since you aren&#39;t here to discuss unschooling your child, apparently<br/>
you&#39;re here to debate the people here.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to debate unschoolers on various topics you can try the<br/>
Unschooling.com debate folder. (Deb&#39;s going to hurl rotten tomatoes at me<br/>
for that suggestion ;-) At least there it&#39;s easier to ignore for those who<br/>
came to discuss unschooling their kids.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s going to seem arbitrary and make no sense to some when I suggest that<br/>
this isn&#39;t the place for this discussion. It will especially seem arbitrary<br/>
when the list discusses censorship 2 months from now. It will seem to be<br/>
opinionated for me to say the reason this debate felt so disruptive when a<br/>
similar one won&#39;t raise a stink was not the topic but that there was more<br/>
emotion and opinion than truth being hurled about. (See Pam&#39;s post about<br/>
that.) So be it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nearly September. Fall and spring are when the most people are looking<br/>
for advice on homeschooling. And I&#39;d appreciate your sensitivity in<br/>
recognizing that this list exists to meet the needs of the people trying to<br/>
find help for their children. If their mailboxes fill up with way too many<br/>
irrelevant posts -- and, yes, this is going to seem arbitrary because other<br/>
noisy box filling discussions will seem equally or more irrelevant to<br/>
others! -- they won&#39;t be able to find the answers they&#39;re looking for.<br/>
