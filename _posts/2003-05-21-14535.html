I AM looking for an emcee for Saturday night&#39;s talent show. I was <br/>
disappointed in how my friend, John, was last year with the children. I guess <br/>
that &quot;control&quot; goes over well at schools, but not at an unschooling <br/>
conference.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody game---or have a child who is?<br/>

all summer, MCing the games!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s so good that I couldn&#39;t bring myself to have the annual talent show <br/>
without him this year!<br/>

children.  Like a little bit of &quot;what do I do with these children they won&#39;t <br/>
listen to me.&quot;  I guess when you are used to being in control and everyone <br/>
doing exactly what you say then this would be a bit new.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-763111284">Kelli --- I run the talent show at the HSC  conference in Sacramento  <br/>
and I have kids take turns being the emcee. I get them a big top hat to  <br/>
wear (I decorate it with glitter and write M.C. in big huge letters on  <br/>
the front). I have a notepad and marker and I write down each act&#39;s  <br/>
name and what they are doing - and give that to our emcee while the  <br/>
previous act is onstage. If the emcee is a nonreader - that&#39;s okay - i  <br/>
read it to them anyway and make sure they get it.  I get the performers  <br/>
ready to go - about 5 or so at a time - and get their info from them  <br/>
right there at the side of the stage. I encourage the kids who are  <br/>
emceeing to be funny, if they want to be - sometimes they are a riot,  <br/>
most of the time they are adorable just doing the announcing  <br/>
straightforwardly.<br/>
<br/>
I have them sign up for 30 minute time slots, by the way.<br/>

sending me her bio and all. Thanks for your idea. We *might* stil do it if there <br/>
are any others interested.<br/>
