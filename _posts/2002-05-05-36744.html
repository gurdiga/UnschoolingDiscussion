<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868856653"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Who in the world ever decided that all children should learn all the same<br/>
&gt; things at exactly the same age in exactly the same way????<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Beyond this, I want to know who in the world decided that we have to learn<br/>
certain things at all, and why we have to learn them by age 18!<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, have NEVER had any interest in geometry or trig, nor have I<br/>
really had any need to use it in my chosen path in life.  Furthermore, only<br/>
recently (in my thirties) have gotten really into world history.  Now I read<br/>
book after book about it.  At 16, it about killed me to read half a<br/>
textboook (which is all we used).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My girlfriend read it to her son last year.  They really enjoyed it. The author<br/>
&gt;wrote more books.  I can&#39;t think of the names off hand. Do you know any other<br/>
&gt;books for chidren  of 7 to 9?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hazel, do you mean math books specifically, since that was the original book<br/>
I mentioned....or just any books?  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know any other<br/>
great math stories, but boooks.....<br/>
<br/>
Chores -- Joyce, thanks for a great post.  I liked looking at chores from<br/>
the other perspective.<br/>
I had to laugh about cleaning the toilet.  I don&#39;t.  My son does.  He thinks<br/>
it is fun.  Don&#39;t anybody come to my house and tell him otherwise, either!<br/>
