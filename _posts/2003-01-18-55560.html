&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; (although I haven&#39;t yet <br/>
 convinced the family to let me start running them *perpendicular* to the <br/>
 wall, in bays, like a library....I dream of this, though. &lt;g&gt;). &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 Keith wanted to do that in our library, and I said NO!  Not just no, but <br/>
hell <br/>
 no.  FINALLY we have one large floorspace, and I would rather rotate books <br/>
in <br/>
 and out than do that!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;m no where near Becky&#39;s capacity....but then, I have a very small <br/>
house (with six bookshelves and a couple of closet shelves full).<br/>
<br/>
Your response to Keith reminded me of what dh said the other night.<br/>
We were looking at stuff for the house and I sighed and said &quot;I need another <br/>
bookshelf&quot;.<br/>
He looked at me funny and replied &quot;You don&#39;t need another bookshelf, what you <br/>
need is a MATCH!&quot;<br/>
Don&#39;t worry, he got a slug in the arm....:)<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
