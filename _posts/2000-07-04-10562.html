&lt;Prior to the Regency (50 years before Victoria)<br/>
and the rise of industrialism, it is true that teenagers were expected to<br/>
have babies, and expected to have more responsibility. BUT, it was also<br/>
assumed that people would live in extended family groupings, with family<br/>
members all around them, and that grandparents (specifically, the maternal<br/>
grandmother) would take a major role in teaching a mother how to care for<br/>
and raise a child, and, in fact, would take much of the responsibility on<br/>
herself. &gt;<br/>

I think this is a really good point and one that I wish some of the <br/>
Attachment Parenting guidebooks would take into account when they extoll the <br/>
virtues of constant togetherness ... it&#39;s true that in the past moms had <br/>
their babies at their sides all the time and children grew up surrounded by <br/>
loving family who were there for everything they needed, but that is way <br/>
different from mom at home all day with the kids, isolated in some bedroom <br/>
community or exurban homestead, dad off at a distant job, coming home late <br/>
and tired, and trustworthy family members hundreds or thousands of miles <br/>
away..The whole AP thing would be a lot easier if you lived with an extended <br/>
family and could, for example, take a bath or prepare a meal and know that <br/>
other adults or older cousins or whatever were in the other room with your <br/>
kids. Or, that your kids had playmates their age so that it wasn&#39;t all up to <br/>
you.<br/>

Good point.  However, it would not be to my benifit to live closer to my<br/>
family because they don&#39;t parent anywhere near the attachment style I use<br/>
with my children.  I have made a community of friends, who parent the same<br/>
style.  I have a sub-culture in my beliefs that offers me support on my <br/>
worse<br/>
days and laugh with me on my best.  I, also, am a facilitator for Attachment<br/>
Parenting International and provide a meeting place for like minded parents,<br/>
so that they can start making up their own &quot;extended families&quot;.<br/>

Julie, I couldn&#39;t live near my mother either... that&#39;s why I live 700 miles <br/>
away! Probably trying to form groups of like-minded friends who can be <br/>
counted on the help each other out is a good idea. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s always <br/>
practical, though. People live far apart in cities... and it seems to me <br/>
that as soon as I get to know someone and like them really well, they move.<br/>
<br/>
Also it doesn&#39;t seem to me that you can ever impose on friends the way you <br/>
can on your family.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh.<br/>
