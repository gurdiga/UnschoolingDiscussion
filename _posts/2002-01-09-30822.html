&lt;&lt; We have a lock that is on our door. Puberty has just entered our home, and<br/>
 it seems like we have to be even MORE careful now. Doesn&#39;t make for easy<br/>
 relaxing at all!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Hi, I&#39;ve been lurking for a few days here. This post sure sounded <br/>
familiar. I have 6 boys 10,14,18,19,21, and 29. I have not relaxed for years, <br/>
LOL It seems no matter what time it is one of them decides they have an <br/>
emergency, if they aren&#39;t knocking on the door they are telephoning. <br/>
    We also gave up years ago on getting them to bed. Once we had teenagers <br/>
it seemed the house never slept. It has calmed down a bit the last few years <br/>
as the three oldest are out of the house. (The oldest has his own 2 now, <br/>
he,he) <br/>
    I have found the best way to get them to bed is to go myself. The earlier <br/>
DH and I go to bed, the earlier they all settle in. He would like me to get <br/>
them up early (I hs the 10 and 14yro&#39;s) but I do so enjoy the early morning <br/>
quiet. <br/>
    I&#39;m also glad that no one sleeps with us any longer, I thought I had a <br/>
permanent foot imprint in my back but it&#39;s starting to fade now. Not all of <br/>
them cared to join us but those that did were sure exciting to sleep with. I <br/>
often found myself hanging on for dear life. I would wake up and wonder why <br/>
my fingers hurt then realize it was from gripping the mattress to stay on, LOL<br/>
Ahhh, the joys of motherhood,<br/>

Still sane after all these years.</div>

I enjoyed your post Laura!  I wanted to agree that the reason my children<br/>
stay up late is to be with me.  If I go to bed earlier so will they.  &quot;I&quot; have<br/>
to adjust my thinking/actions.  I started staying up later so that I could <br/>
have an<br/>
hour or more of my alone time, as they got older they weren&#39;t just falling<br/>
asleep anywhere and staying up later with me.  I am thinking its time for<br/>
me to go to bed and take my time in the early am (of course mine never<br/>
slept that much so I probably won&#39;t get that time alone either LOL).<br/>

ps - Of course sometimes I really appreciate that.  With the medical <br/>

there. </span></blockquote></div>
