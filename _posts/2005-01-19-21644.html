Hmmm... I agree that it seems to miss the whole point. Unschooling after <br/>
school. Sigh. This is starting to wear on me.<br/>

I agree that this phrase made me cringe a bit also. I have read somewhere -<br/>
specifically stated in some of the Unschooling lists&#39; descriptions and/or<br/>
guidelines (or was it unschooling.com?) - that Unschooling is *not* defined<br/>
as this idea.<br/>
<br/>
The broader question of whether taking a course leads to not taking courses,<br/>
makes me think of Kelly&#39;s essay on the Three Stages of Unschooling, only 180<br/>
degrees opposite. <br/>
<br/>
I guess if they paid their money and then were given a list of resources and<br/>
books, and invited to read all they wanted at their own speed, they might<br/>
get irritated and say &quot;but what about the assessments? How will I know when<br/>
I am qualified to begin Unschooling? How do I graduate from the course? What<br/>
are the standards for completion?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
This is somewhat along the lines of some of the books, like &quot;Unschooling<br/>
Handbook&quot; - great for absolute beginners, but if you hang around here long<br/>
enough you get it all for free and mostly from the same writers.   <br/>
<br/>
I would consider, for *me*, a course like that might have become a detour in<br/>
my personal deschooling process, a safety net that was actually more like a<br/>
spider&#39;s web.<br/>
