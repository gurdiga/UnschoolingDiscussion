Subject: Grace Academy<br/>
 <br/>
My name is Elizabeth. Weve been home schooling our children for 5 years.<br/>
This<br/>
year we enrolled them in Einstein Academy, and it was a disaster.<br/>
 <br/>
Before considering The Grace Academy, you should know that Mimi and Howie<br/>
are<br/>
Einsteins founders. Their company, Tutorbots, mismanaged the school<br/>
until about<br/>
three weeks ago. In her dealings with Einstein families, Mimi used the<br/>
name<br/>
Mimi Rothschild.<br/>
 <br/>
IEPs were not done for the 300 special ed children who were enrolled in<br/>
the<br/>
school. It is now the end of April and only nine IEPs have been written.<br/>
 <br/>
I have never seen a more substantive fundamental violation of special<br/>
education<br/>
by a local education agency, charged Jane Sullivan, special education<br/>
adviser<br/>
for the education department, who testified against Einstein Academy.<br/>
Courier<br/>
Times 3/20/02<br/>
 <br/>
The curriculum was not what Einstein promised. One class didnt have a<br/>
teacher<br/>
until early Dec  then he left the school in February, and the class is<br/>
teacherless<br/>
again. <br/>
 <br/>
Einstein has been sued by many PA school districts and the PA Department<br/>
of<br/>
Education. It is only open now through a court-brokered agreement which<br/>
required:<br/>
eliminating Tutorbots as manager and financial manager of the school,<br/>
forensic<br/>
accounting of payments to Tutorbots, approval of all payments by a<br/>
comptroller<br/>
who reports to the chartering school district and strict oversight by the<br/>
chartering<br/>
school district. <br/>
 <br/>
Here are excerpts from articles about Tutorbots and its mismanagement of<br/>
Einstein:<br/>
 <br/>
************<br/>
 <br/>
I am convinced that Einstein will not be successful as long as Tutorbots<br/>
is<br/>
the management company, Ken Junkins, the Morrisville board president,<br/>
said<br/>
yesterday.<br/>
 <br/>
I believe Tutorbots is not properly managing Einstein. I believe there<br/>
is possible<br/>
mismanagement of funds, and they are not responding appropriately to the<br/>
needs<br/>
of students, he said.<br/>
Courier Times 2/28/02<br/>
 <br/>
**************<br/>
We believe they (Tutorbots) totally mishandled the management of the<br/>
school.<br/>
Said Morrisville Superintendent John M. Gould.<br/>
 <br/>
The school board, Gould said, is particularly concerned about Tutorbots<br/>
general<br/>
operation of the school, a lack of fiscal oversight and problems<br/>
providing services<br/>
to special education students.<br/>
 <br/>
Another source of Morrisvilles ire: Einsteins teachers havent been<br/>
paid since<br/>
early February. We are quite angry at Tutorbots because they have used<br/>
$2.3<br/>
million to pay themselves but have not paid the teachers,  Gould said.<br/>
Thats<br/>
unconscionable.<br/>
Morning Call 3/2/02<br/>
 <br/>
***************<br/>
Court documents showed that about $3 million was paid to Tutorbots during<br/>
the<br/>
school year, while teachers have gone unpaid and the schools internet<br/>
service<br/>
provider, Digital Freedom, canceled its service for nonpayment.<br/>
 <br/>
Other complaints include copyright infringement, a lack of curriculum and<br/>
teachers<br/>
and a lack of special education services.<br/>
 <br/>
During todays arguments, attorney Scher insisted that the state has a<br/>
responsibility<br/>
to pay its bill owed the cyber school, some 15 million in all. The judge<br/>
asked<br/>
Scher how the state would know that the money is not going to a bank in<br/>
the<br/>
Cayman Islands.<br/>
 <br/>
But from day one they (the state) funded you and you did virtually<br/>
nothing,<br/>
Judge Pellegrini said. You are supposed to be up and running on day one,<br/>
not<br/>
day 90 of a 180-day school year. In effect, you put Tutorbots over the<br/>
interest<br/>
of the children you were supposed to educate.<br/>
Lancaster New Era 3/22/02<br/>
 <br/>
****************<br/>
Gould believes Mandel and Rothschild are controlling much of the schools<br/>
spending.<br/>
 <br/>
Howie Mandelhad the responsibility forapproving all invoices, Gould<br/>
claimed<br/>
in a letter to Einstein, including invoices from his own company,<br/>
Tutorbots,<br/>
and Gould said some of those invoices are grossly inflated<br/>
 <br/>
All this while other vendors, and even the schools teachers went unpaid.<br/>
 <br/>
Einstein paid Tutorbots $2.4 million before paying teachers, Gould<br/>
said. <br/>
 <br/>
WGAL 3/26/02<br/>
 <br/>
*****************<br/>
our information is that Einstein has received $3.3 million from the<br/>
Commonwealth<br/>
of PA to fund its educational program. Our Business Administrator cannot<br/>
conceive<br/>
of any way that the funding to date would not be sufficient to allow<br/>
Einstein<br/>
to be current on its bills and meet payroll.<br/>
 <br/>
Morrisville attorney <br/>
 <br/>
*****************<br/>
Tutorbots Inc. is prohibited from providing any management or financial<br/>
management<br/>
services to Einstein. In addition, a forensic accounting firm will review<br/>
all<br/>
paid and outstanding invoices previously submitted by Tutorbots to<br/>
Einstein<br/>
to determine if they were properly paid and that the funds were used for<br/>
purposes<br/>
permitted under the Public School Code:<br/>
PDE press release 3/28/02<br/>
 <br/>
*****************<br/>
In June a forensic accounting firm will do an audit to determine whether<br/>
the<br/>
payments Einstein made to Tutorbots were warranted. A total of $2.2<br/>
million<br/>
of $3.8 million in state funding that Einstein received went to<br/>
Tutorbots, and<br/>
the state Education Department wants to know why, said Beth Gaydos, a<br/>
spokeswoman<br/>
for the Education Department.<br/>
Courier Times 4/4/02<br/>
 <br/>
****************<br/>
The computer problems coincide with a new legal battle between Einstein<br/>
and<br/>
Tutorbots, which is demanding the repayment of a loan of about $345,000.<br/>
 <br/>
Tutorbots officials, Howard Mandell and his wife, Mimi Rothschild, also<br/>
the<br/>
founder of Einstein, have been withholding student records as well as<br/>
control<br/>
of the schools web site, until the money is repaid.<br/>
 <br/>
Last week, a judge in Philadelphia ordered the return of the records as<br/>
well<br/>
as the web site, but as of Tuesday that had not happened.<br/>
Intelligencer Journal 4/10/02<br/>
 <br/>
*****************<br/>
 <br/>
Tutorbots mismanagement turned what could have been a great cyber school<br/>
into<br/>
a disaster which damaged children enrolled.<br/>
 <br/>
You should exercise great caution before considering The Grace Academy!<br/>
 <br/>
Buyer Beware!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Dear Fellow Homeschoolers,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My name is Mimi and I have been homeschooling  my 7 kids for the <br/>
&gt; past 14 yearsway back when people did not even know what it was.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In 1997 every parents nightmare came true for my husband (of 23 <br/>
&gt; years) and I lost our beloved Andrew to an unnecessary and <br/>
&gt; preventable death. Rather than become debilitated by our devastating <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; loss, the Lord gave me the hope that He would use this tragedy for <br/>
&gt; His glory. Immediately following Andrew&#39;s death, another son, Riley <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Josiah, became critically ill and required life support, 24 hour <br/>
&gt; nursing, and 26 operations in 2.5 years. During this time of <br/>
&gt; mourning our loss, caring for our sick child I was caring for a <br/>
&gt; newborn and homeschooling 4 other kids. The Lord taught me two <br/>
&gt; invaluable lessons - not all loving parents are able to homeschool <br/>
&gt; by themselves and that there was an enormous need for a <br/>
&gt; homeschooling help to come to parents when they cannot do it all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To fulfill this need and God&#39;s promise that our loss would be used <br/>
&gt; for good, my husband and I founded The Grace Academy, an online <br/>
&gt; school (pending licensing) that delivers world class curriculum to <br/>
&gt; children throughout the world. <br/>

&gt; curriculum uses many of the leading Christian publishers like Bob <br/>
&gt; Jones,Alpha Omega, and Saxon Math. Choose from over 150 courses that <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; all have a balanced Christian world view.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Grace Academy provides everything you need to provide your <br/>
&gt; child<br/>
&gt; (ren) with a thorough and standards based education. Our interactive <br/>

&gt; real time. Our faculty will mentor each student individually through <br/>
