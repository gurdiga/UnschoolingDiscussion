<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030768349">There are times when it seems that kids don&#39;t like their mom and dad having <br/>
friends and a life. <br/>
 I recently met some online people in Florida. My daughter who is 12 really <br/>
resented me having fun with someone that did not directly include her. She <br/>
figures she owns me, she owns me a little more than her brother is entitled <br/>
to own me too,<br/>
 I was kind of shocked at her behavior and when we were alone we talked about <br/>
it. She said she didn&#39;t mean to and knew she was being kind of condescending <br/>
and rude to her mom but she just could not stop. <br/>
 I was really amazed at her reaction and when we saw them later, she was much <br/>
better about it all. <br/>
 There should be a balance. The mom should have a right to talk and be among <br/>
adults and still be respected by her children. The kids do not have to be the <br/>
center piece of every conversation and discussion.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As Betsy said she appreciated Sandra saying: This isn&#39;t about Beth but about<br/>
ideas and about the list and where trying to translate what&#39;s in our head<br/>
breaks down because of how we choose to use English.<br/>
<br/>
The words above might be expressing the idea of maintaining healthy personal<br/>
boundaries in an atmosphere of mutual respect.<br/>
<br/>
But the words don&#39;t say that to me. What &quot;moms should have a right&quot; says to<br/>
me is &quot;I&#39;m not giving up all my rights so the kids can have their way.&quot; It<br/>
says power struggle. It maybe even says &quot;I didn&#39;t get rights when I was a<br/>
kid so now it&#39;s my turn and you kids can&#39;t take that away from me just<br/>
because some people on a list say I should give them away.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I respond to what I read rather than what someone means to say, it&#39;s one<br/>
of the sources for upsetness on the list. The argument appears to be about<br/>
what is and isn&#39;t respect or unschooling but is really about word use and<br/>
the meanings they convey.<br/>
<br/>
The above may not be what Beth is trying to say. But even if it isn&#39;t, it<br/>
*is* what many people hear when people talk about putting children first or<br/>
mutual respect or other words they use to get across a different way of<br/>
seeing the parent child relationship.<br/>
<br/>
The idea people are trying to convey involves a paradigm shift. It&#39;s trying<br/>
to get across the idea of seeing the situation without the words that trap<br/>
us into seeing it a certain way. Drop the idea of rights and think about<br/>
needs. Drop the idea that kids have to learn to accept that somtimes someone<br/>
else&#39;s needs are more important because that&#39;s just the way things are. Drop<br/>
a lot of other things too.<br/>
<br/>
*Don&#39;t* replace those with their opposites. Don&#39;t think &quot;Those with the most<br/>
and loudest expression of needs get to win.&quot; Don&#39;t think &quot;We need to bend<br/>
over backwards so kids never experience disappointment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Instead of thinking or saying to kids &quot;We all want our needs met, *but* ...&quot;<br/>
approach it with the attitude &quot;We all want our needs met. I&#39;m sorry this<br/>
isn&#39;t working out. How about ....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s two ways of saying something that sound like the same but send very<br/>
different messages:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t read any more. We&#39;ll have to finish this in the morning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m too sleepy. We can finish this in the morning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The first is mom saying &quot;This is how the situation is. It can&#39;t be changed.<br/>
There&#39;s nothing you can do about it. And here&#39;s the only solution.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The second is giving information and suggesting one possible alternative.<br/>
<br/>
The first is closed. The second is open to other suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
What putting &quot;needing&quot; into quotes in the subject communicates to me is that<br/>
what are being refered to as needs really aren&#39;t. What it says to me is that<br/>
kids say through their actions that they need something but they don&#39;t<br/>
really. What they&#39;re expressing isn&#39;t as important as a need. They&#39;re making<br/>
a bigger deal out of something than it really it is.<br/>
<br/>
What &quot;The kids do not have to be the center piece of every conversation and<br/>
discussion&quot; says is that seems to be the alternative to not being the<br/>
centerpiece. If we turn that around and have our husbands thinking that way<br/>
about things we feel are reasonable requests then we&#39;d probably resent it!<br/>
<br/>
But what people are saying is throw away references to centerpieces or any<br/>
reference that places someone in the position of winner and others in the<br/>
position of loser. There&#39;s a huge important difference between approaching<br/>
kids with the attitude that you will do what you can to help them meet their<br/>
needs and approaching them with the attitude you&#39;ll get them what they ask<br/>
for. They keep getting equated and they aren&#39;t the same at all.<br/>
<br/>
IT&#39;s the difference again between being opened and closed. When we go to our<br/>
husbands for help on something they know a lot about, we&#39;d want them to<br/>
project an attitude of &quot;What can I do to help?&quot; rather than an attitude of<br/>
&quot;I might or might not help you depending on how much trouble it is.&quot; He<br/>
might not be able to help. Being ignorant of what we&#39;re asking, we might<br/>
unknowingly be asking too much. But rather than him saying no, it would be a<br/>
lot more helpful if he started helping us think of alternative ways he could<br/>
help, or how others could help or how we could get help ourselves. We&#39;d<br/>
appreciate him helping us get our needs met.<br/>
<br/>
So it is with kids. They&#39;d like to know we&#39;re there to help them get their<br/>
needs met. When we first change our attitude, they will still hear &quot;No,<br/>
can&#39;t do that&quot; when we say &quot;How about this ..&quot; But they will eventually make<br/>
the shift from feeling they&#39;re approaching us for largess and approaching us<br/>
for help with a problem.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve known Beth for many years.  I know a lot about her kids.  From the <br/>
context of what I know about Beth and her kids, I know she didn&#39;t mean what <br/>
you said above.  <br/>
<br/>
I think what she was trying to say is that her kids have reached the point <br/>
where they are quite capable of waiting their turn in the conversation.  I <br/>
can see, though, how her words looked the way you described them, when <br/>
they&#39;re out of context.  <br/>
<br/>
So, I get you, Joyce, and understand what you&#39;re getting at, and believe it.  <br/>
But I also don&#39;t want Beth to be maligned in the process.  I know she <br/>
respects her kids.<br/>

And also maybe go from being supplicants to a frightening higher power, and <br/>
going to their supportive teammate.<br/>

(Same thing Joyce said, probably, but maybe stronger.)<br/>

If there is an &quot;us vs. them&quot; thought in the mother&#39;s head, then it&#39;s a <br/>

No matter who knows who, to put &quot;needing&quot; in quotation marks that way says <br/>
&quot;not really needing.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207382121">Thank you Joyce,    <br/>
 <br/>
this was what I was kind-of trying to say earlier,  but probably got too many ideas going.   You&#39;re a great conveyer of thoughts and ideas,   very precise.    <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
As others would say,   this is another for the book of Joyce!<br/>
