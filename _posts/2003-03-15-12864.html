<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010812460">Did the subject line get your attention?  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Well, we are having a curriculum show and tell here.  At least the local <br/>
homeschool group I am a member of is.  This is a large group of about 400 <br/>
members.  The &quot;show and tell&quot; isn&#39;t to try to sell anything but to bring your <br/>
favorite curriculum for all to see.  LOL.  I E mailed the person in charge <br/>
and asked if it was just curriculum or was it philosophies as well.  I <br/>
explained that we were unschoolers and she said I could set up an unschooling <br/>
table if I would like.  So here I am.  In a group of mostly &quot;school at home&quot; <br/>
types.  I think there is one parent that is a &quot;unit study&quot; person.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I signed up and my idea was to have some copies of a few essays for people to <br/>
look at and take, copies of the registration form for the unschooling <br/>
conference (is that OK Kelly).  Also would bring my fav books on unschooling <br/>
and some back issues I have of HEM and Life Learning.  Also want to type up a <br/>
list of web sites etc.  I think many people are Internet connected.  Anyway <br/>
just looking to see if anyone had any other brilliant ideas or favorite web <br/>
sites.  It is informal so people will be able to look at different <br/>
curriculums and talk.  And it is in Mid April so don&#39;t have a lot of time.  I <br/>
think their original idea was to have this before the conference and book <br/>
fair here in NC at the end of May.<br/>
<br/>
I am not trying to preach or convert people but I guess my object is to maybe <br/>
get a few people to think a little.  Anyway if anyone has any ideas I would <br/>
appreciate it.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

used to call it &quot;Curriculum Night&quot; but now it&#39;s called &quot;Resource Night.&quot;<br/>
Yea! I usually just bring something that we did a lot during the year or a<br/>
book I loved. Things I&#39;ve talked about over the years: Zoombinis, Zeus, my<br/>
comfortable couch, &quot;Next of Kin&quot; (an amazing book), Google, The Shape of<br/>
Life series, Arden Shakespeares. This year I think I will bring some of<br/>
Graeme Baese&#39;s books.<br/>

that.  But it does sound like a nice time. <br/>

Although Teresa is, but she only started this year.  But could use pictures <br/>
and lists from my children.<br/>
Thanks for the idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998062986">I have a resource table we put up for our weekly support group play day.<br/>
One thing I really like, is all the stuff I printed off the <br/>
internet....essays from Sandra, Joyce, AnneO etc....<br/>
I took all of the essays and posts I printed, sorted them into groupings that <br/>
made sense to me and put them into those folders that you hook together with <br/>
those metal post type thingys. Can&#39;t think of how to describe them. <br/>
And good folder that allows you to read the papers like a book, rather than <br/>
just have a bunch of papers stuck into it, would work.<br/>
Our groupings are Unschooling,  Applying unschooling to parenting (or <br/>
something along those lines) and Fun stuff to do, full of recipes,  math <br/>
games, cheap fun etc...<br/>
We have several books, John Holt, Grace Lewellyn, David Gutterson etc...<br/>
The Joy of Wonder by Rachel Carson...just a whole bunch of natural learning <br/>
writings for people to read. <br/>
We also have NHEN brochures, Life Learning magazines (left over from the <br/>
conference, they&#39;re almost gone now) and a brochure of our support group.<br/>
<br/>
If I were doing a table, I&#39;d have some kind of tactile thing to attract kids. <br/>
Playdough or Gak or something in 2-3 containers that look appealing and fun.<br/>
Make sure you have some way for people to have your phone number or email <br/>
addy should they want more information.<br/>
You may be surprised at how many people are interested in the unschooling <br/>
philosophies.   I thought I was the only unschooler for a while, I started a <br/>
group with just myself and one other family, and now we have a strong <br/>
unschooling support group with a very diverse base.<br/>

Unschooling, that you copy from HEM:<br/>
