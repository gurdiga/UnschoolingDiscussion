<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578635844">UNHOUSEKEEPING!!!!  Now I have a name for it that really fits into my <br/>
lifestyle, thank you!!  I hated calling myself a &quot;bad housekeeper&quot; <br/>
or &quot;domestically challenged&quot; or thinking about how I&#39;ve always, <br/>
always hated housework.  One of the ironies of my life, as I point <br/>
out to my husband every now & then, is that part of my &quot;job <br/>
description&quot; &lt;g&gt; would be housekeeping, which I&#39;m horrible at and <br/>
HATE!<br/>
<br/>
I have thought of what it would be like to give myself some kind of <br/>
motivation (other than having lots of company), like chocolate or <br/>
something else indulgent but I can&#39;t fool myself like that!  Knowing <br/>
me, I&#39;d just walk into the laundry room and eat the candy, never <br/>
looking at the 6 FULL laundry baskets (some dirty, some clean, some <br/>
folded, rarely put away)!<br/>
<br/>
I do have to say that this nesting thing is getting out of hand, <br/>
though (baby&#39;s coming in a month!) and things like clean ceiling fans <br/>
seem really important right now!  Go figure...</div>

reading the whole chocolate idea, I thought well, it<br/>
would have to be like rigged up in some way...like a<br/>
mousetrap for unhousekeepers...so that I could not<br/>
obtain and remove the wrapper unless the clothes were<br/>
put away....hm....too bad I&#39;m not patient enough to<br/>
actually invent such a thing...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>hey! too bad you don&#39;t live near me. me and my *betend<br/>
sil&quot; are starting a &quot;detail cleaning&quot; business....<br/>
(sounds funny I know after my rambling about hating<br/>
housework, but it&#39;s different if you&#39;re getting paid,<br/>
I guess)...not doing &quot;housecleaning&quot; (trash,<br/>
vacuuming, bathrooms) for a flat fee but doing detail<br/>
work (windows-as in every area of the window...light<br/>
fixtures/fans...blinds....megadusting....ovens...<br/>
screens...walls....vents...tile/grout...etc etc etc)<br/>
that is charged by each item...<br/>
we are passing out flyers this weekend. <br/>
maybe some $$$ will come of it. hope so.<br/>
-Bobbie<br/>
-unfortunately NOT nesting in any way...unless you<br/>
consider gathering clutter to make it look more &quot;lived<br/>
in&quot; nesting....<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree with Betsy.  I sold my house in a hurry in<br/>
&gt; Sept.<br/>
&gt; and would have loved to have someone come in and do<br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
&gt; The regular housecleaning service we used did okay<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; those parts but your type of service would have been<br/>
&gt; great!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d suggest contacting real estate agents in your<br/>
&gt; area<br/>
&gt; with a brochure or business card.  We used cleaners,<br/>
&gt; painters, etc. that my agent recommended.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

Not a &#39;you must have your children immunised or you will all die&#39; episode?
<br>Sigh. I&#39;m facing the American embassy in London in a few weeks. I have
to see the embassy doc for a medical exam and explain why ky kids are not
immunised. It&#39;s one of the conditions for enetering the US as a &#39;alien&#39;
