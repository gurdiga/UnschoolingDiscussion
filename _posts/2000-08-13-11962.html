<div id="ygrps-yiv-195069326">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the Moistursil &quot;add&quot; and story.  I was surprized to see it,<br/>
must have accidentally clicked on Unschooling when sending it to<br/>
Tiffany.  I must make a point of reading one Unschooling a day.  It<br/>
always gives me good ideas.  I especially liked the one from the person<br/>
with the six year old, I&#39;m going to check into Mad Libs.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
noticing his progression in letter, words and numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Heres a story about numbers.  We were taking a bath.  He tells me I<br/>
really don&#39;t know Math that well.  I tell him we have 5 minutes left in<br/>
our bath.  Then I tell him in a bit that 2 minutes have gone by and we<br/>
have to get out soon.  He says no, we don&#39;t have to get out soon we have<br/>
3 minutes left.  (he did this in his head).  He&#39;s doing fine.  I use<br/>
this story when folks ask how he is doing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Sherry</div>
