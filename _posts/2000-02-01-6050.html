<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, here&#39;s a question for all you other old-timers!<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine has two kids - 14 and 10. They have both inherited their<br/>
father&#39;s scientific / techonogical genes, while their mother, who is the SAH<br/>
parent, is a wonderfully talented craftswoman - quilter, fabric artist, and<br/>
glass mosaic artist, flautist....and what ever other artistic craft takes her<br/>
fancy, and also a keen gardener / landscaper. She is starting to find herself<br/>
becoming quite depressed at her inability to do her work full time, because her<br/>
children&#39;s interests and needs are so different. (She knows school if definitely<br/>
not an option.)<br/>
<br/>
My dh and I were both brought up on farms, have wanted to get back to country<br/>
living for many years, have finally taken the plunge, and have bought a piece of<br/>
land 3/4 hour away from town, where the kids have lived all their lives (19, 16,<br/>
12, 9yo), and where they would like to continue to live! We are doing what we<br/>
want to do, which has given me a new lease on life - I too, was feeling<br/>
frustrated at not doing my &#39;thing&#39;. My world is now spoiled only by criticism<br/>
from others for being selfish, and for forcing my kids to do things they don&#39;t<br/>
want to do - ie living where they don&#39;t want to live.<br/>
<br/>
So, old-timers, do any of you have these sort of problems? I&#39;m not so much<br/>
looking for practical solutions, but rather, ideas on how you cope with these<br/>
feelings of needing more from life, and coping with the criticism from your<br/>
fellow homeschoolers (who, after all these years of homeschooling, have become<br/>
my main circle of friends) if you go for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332922815">I probably fall into the category you have described--we began homeschooling<br/>
in l979 by taking fifth and third graders out of school and had two younger<br/>
who never went.  My children are all grown and living their lives<br/>
independently and raising unschoolers of their own.<br/>
<br/>
We made a drastic move in l984 when my husband retired from the Air Force in<br/>
Mississippi and we moved to Oklahoma, out in the country, for his next job.<br/>
The kids were 6, 9, 11, and 14.  We had animals so enjoyed the space to<br/>
raise them differently.  We got involved with soccer for the kids in the<br/>
surrounding towns, and  everyone seemed fine.  Our discussions over the<br/>
years have shown that it was much more traumatic than I realized for them<br/>
even though they adjusted okay.  I had tried to keep them aware of all<br/>
plans, choices, etc during the change, but they still felt they had no<br/>
choice.  We had lived in Mississippi for six years and we all had come to<br/>
love it.  There was no choice of staying there, but rather where to move,<br/>
and that choice was basically my husband&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I always found life in general to be a balancing act.  Home birth,<br/>
attachment parenting, homeschooling, all of these things that grow children<br/>
so well, and have the potential to grow parents well, too, can also be<br/>
draining if you don&#39;t find the balance that you need.  My oldest daughter<br/>
has a shirt that says &quot;If Mama ain&#39;t happy, ain&#39;t nobody happy!&quot;  And that<br/>
is true!  So it is important to refill often enough and completely enough to<br/>
have something to give when you are called upon and also important to<br/>
consider each person&#39;s views and feelings when decisions need to be made.<br/>
<br/>
I did not start out unschooling.  But my children quickly showed me that<br/>
they would accept nothing less--they just would not do what did not<br/>
absolutely fit that child at that moment.  So while I was worrying about<br/>
one&#39;s reading and another&#39;s math, what I was turning out was children who<br/>
had learned to listen to the person inside and do just what they needed in<br/>
whatever way they needed.  Quite liberating, really.  Instead of presuming<br/>
to know what someone would need to learn or do at what time in the future,<br/>
you answer the questions you are asked and help the child who needs help in<br/>
finding answers, and strive to be a whole person yourself all the while.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this provides some help in finding the answers you seek!  I would be<br/>
happy to discuss it further!<br/>

    Well we did, just go for it that is :-)   My dh and I also have always <br/>
dreamed of moving to the country.  Unfortunately, we never could afford to.  <br/>
This year, we were finally able to make our dream come true.  Our children <br/>
are 18, 14, 11, and 8.  The oldest two did NOT want to move to the country.  <br/>
They are now 1/2 hour away from the church, 3/4 hour away from alot of their <br/>
friends and from shopping, parks, swimming pools, theaters etc.  However, my <br/>
husband and I talked and prayed about this and decided to go ahead with the <br/>
move.  The older kids are only going to be at home for a few more years, but <br/>
we will have a lifetime yet and what if this chance only comes once for us?  <br/>
So we went ahead and took it.<br/>
      Guess what?  All the kids love it here now!  They have realised what <br/>
having alot of secluded land of our own can mean.  Now when they go outside <br/>
during &quot;schooltime&quot; no one can see them.  We have no more nosey neighbors <br/>
asking why the kids are out playing.  We have woods behind our home which <br/>
makes for alot of &quot;imaginary&quot; play time (even for the 18 year old---he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t admit it, but he also has fun with it!) and they have been able to <br/>
make a tree house.  They are already talking about building an even better <br/>
treehouse this summer.  They are out in nature alot any more.  Not only <br/>
feeding and caring for our own dog and cat, but we have alot of deer around <br/>
here, not to mention rabbits, squirrels, possums, birds, and even snakes.<br/>
     My husband has a large workshop now and all the kids have been learning <br/>
to build picnic tables, doghouses, and other wood projects.  The kids have <br/>
also helped with repairing mailboxes (ours has been run over twice since we <br/>
moved here--in the snowy weather), planting more trees, chopping down trees <br/>
and chopping firewood.<br/>
This spring, they will help us start a garden.  I can&#39;t believe what a <br/>
turnabout my kids have done!<br/>
     Of course, we go out of our way to make sure that they still get <br/>
together with their friends, go to scouts, go to the movies, and just stay <br/>
connected with their interests.<br/>
If this means we have to drive 45 minutes to get them there, we just do it!<br/>
      As far as listening to everybodys comments about how &quot;selfish&quot; we are, <br/>
well I just tell people that I don&#39;t agree.  Most of the people who say that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to live in the country.  When I go on and ask them why they <br/>
feel that way, they say that they wouldn&#39;t like the seclusion.  So I think <br/>
they are going on their feelings, not even thinking that others may not feel <br/>
the way they do.  Most of the homeschoolers and other friends that have <br/>
stayed connected with us since we moved, now think we have done the right <br/>
thing.  They see how happy and relaxed my kids are, and when they visit us, <br/>
they even say that they are jealous and wish they could move in the country!<br/>
      Personally, I think you should listen to your own heart and dreams.  If <br/>
those people are really friends, they will quit criticising you because of <br/>
your choice.  After all, you have already bought the land right?  So what <br/>
good does their criticising do?<br/>
Do all their comments make your choices dissapear and you end back up at your <br/>
old home?  I think not!!  Anyway, this is your life to live, not theirs!  <br/>
This is between you, your husband and your kids!  This isn&#39;t really the <br/>
business of any of your friends.  And if your oldest kids are unhappy, they <br/>
are really old enough to do something about it arent they?  They are old <br/>
enough to drive and visit their friends 3/4 hour away.  The oldest one (even <br/>
though we wouldn&#39;t like it) is even old enough to get a job and move to their <br/>
own place!   <br/>
     Oh well, sorry for rambling, but what you are going through is just the <br/>
exact thing we went through.  I wish you all the best, and I hope that <br/>
everything turns out as well for you as it did for us!<br/>
