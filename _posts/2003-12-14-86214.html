<div id="ygrps-yiv-987176011">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for that idea of that card game.  I recently went to <br/>
Foxwoods casino with my mom and sister and I played a table similar <br/>
to your card game (with 11 or 21).  I can&#39;t wait to play tomorrow <br/>
because it&#39;s one of those fun games you can play with ALL AGES.  I <br/>
can&#39;t wait - I even have a bunch of change. We can put the tree up <br/>
and then gamble all day while learning math LOL................<br/>
now thats what I call unschooling.  Oh I forgot my oldest (15) asked <br/>
me to ear candle his ears so we will get a little health in there <br/>
too.<br/>
Thanks for all your ideas Pam :)<br/>
Sonya</div>
