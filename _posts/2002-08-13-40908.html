Just got a notice in my mailbox yesterday that our local school district is <br/>
sponsoring a &quot;school readiness workshop&quot; -- an all-day Saturday workshop for <br/>
parents, free of charge, where they will listen to early childhood educators <br/>
talk about how to help their child be ready to face the challenges of <br/>
kindergarten.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously. No joke. Sometimes I forget what the rest of the world (the <br/>
nonunschooling part of it) is really like.<br/>

I feel so anti-nonunschooling these days! &lt;g&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092594957">I&#39;ve noticed a HUGE difference, because I know the kids aren&#39;t going to <br/>
school, in the things I present and how I present them. For instance, I <br/>
don&#39;t feel it necessary to demonstrate &quot;school&quot; letter-formation. I can <br/>
write notes to my young kids using my own writing. There are many other <br/>
details I often notice in passing, but none are coming to mind right now.<br/>
<br/>
The long and short of it is that I&#39;m not preparing them for school, just <br/>
being with them and their interests.<br/>
