Teachers like this give TEACHING a bad name. Just as you would resent being<br/>
judged as a hs&#39;er by the hs&#39;ing man accused of abusing his spelling bee<br/>

As it was said earlier in the discussion we cant paint all teachers <br/>
the same - but it does strengthen my believe in <br/>
homeschool/unschooling - and makes me more determined to H/s my <br/>

    Believe me, you are not the only one who feels that this blanket<br/>
indictment of teachers and public schools is &quot;dare I say it&quot; a crock!  As I<br/>
recall, the person was responding to a situation where another teacher said<br/>
positive things about this homeschooler  Was that just a fluke?<br/>
<br/>
    People choose to homeschool for many reasons.  Not all homeschoolers<br/>
feel that public school is evil and all teachers are scum.  I , for one, am<br/>
a strong proponent of public schools - homeschooling is not for everyone.<br/>
And I think that teaching is an honorable profession.  I would be teaching<br/>
today, but, frankly, I can&#39;t put up with all the stress that teachers have<br/>

&gt;  Amy<br/>
&gt;  Mom to Samantha, Dana, and Casey<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, Amy, if my statement bothered you.  I wasn&#39;t making a statement about <br/>
all teachers, I was talking about this one based on the information we were <br/>
given about the statement she made regarding one child that, by the way, she <br/>
didn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say I know LOTS of teachers.  I know LOTS of former teachers.  My <br/>
dear mother in law is a teacher.  I love her to death.  I also hear her <br/>
complain bitterly about the system, and she works in one of the best schools <br/>
in one of the best school districts in the state.  She is counting the days <br/>
until retirement.  And, she&#39;s a wonderful teacher!  <br/>
<br/>
She has also been supportive of our decision to homeschool.  On the other <br/>
hand, she thinks that there is no way to educate a child at home other than <br/>
to do school-at-home.  <br/>
<br/>
I can also say that I had some wonderful teachers in my 23 years of formal <br/>
schooling.  I also have friends who are former teachers.  In fact, none of <br/>
these teachers plans to go back to teaching.  They left because they were <br/>
sick of it, or they left to raise their children and decided that was more <br/>
fun or more important than going back into teaching school.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I will make one more blanket statement.  It also used to bother me <br/>
when people dissed the school system, because that&#39;s not what led my family <br/>
to homeschool.  I saw nothing fundamentally wrong with &quot;the system&quot;.  Now, <br/>
however, after talking with so many people who taught in schools, after <br/>
talking with so many people who had children in schools (as I did), after <br/>
reading so many books on the subject (for and against schools), and after <br/>
much contemplation, I am of the opinion that school, as we know it today, <br/>
should be abolished, together with its boards of education, its multi-level <br/>
administration, its standardized testing, and its teachers.  That&#39;s public <br/>
schools, private schools, charter schools, you name it.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe that children should be taught at home by parents or in very small <br/>
groups.  (I might consider retaining the one-room schoolhouse.)  School is <br/>
the worst way to provide for a child&#39;s -- any child&#39;s --  education.  And <br/>
because I am sure to get flamed, I might as well say that of course some <br/>
people, single parents, those few families in which both parents must work, <br/>
or for those few families that just don&#39;t have the temperment, must make <br/>
provision for their children.  Personally, I would much rather see those <br/>
children in the arms of a nice cooperating homeschooling family during the <br/>
day than warehoused in a school.  <br/>

with day to day?  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t used to feel that public schools were evil either.  Now I pretty <br/>
much do.  Not individual schools, but the system.  And not teachers.  I&#39;ve <br/>
never thought teachers were scum.  I never said teachers were scum.  I do <br/>
believe that their considerable talents can best be employed elsewhere, <br/>
however.  The entire idea of public education to me is a crock.<br/>
