He&#39;s right.  It IS puzzles.  Why are you thinking &quot;math&quot; instead of puzzles?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s never been in a coma, and that he isn&#39;t sleeping more than <br/>
maybe ten or twelve of every 24 hours.  The other twelve he&#39;s awake, moving, <br/>
looking, hearing and communicating, I&#39;m guessing.  I bet he&#39;s not limp and <br/>
listless with his eyes rolling back in his head or you&#39;d be mentioning that.<br/>

<br/>
How much would he have done in real, full minutes of focussed activity if he <br/>

not even over yet!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895180614">It&#39;s normal. It will cool down and the whole family will get more energy. I have<br/>
a very hard time in summer getting motivated. Now that it&#39;s down into the 90&#39;s<br/>
things will be getting better soon. Baking will start. Outdoor activities, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Your stress will wax and wane, too. Pretend he&#39;s a big three. Have fun. Do stuff<br/>
for YOU. Watch TV. Read for YOU.<br/>
<br/>
Y&#39;know, when it&#39;s hot and humid, it&#39;s not just little kids that don&#39;t want to do<br/>
anything...this up and down is part of life, too.<br/>

It sounds like a good day to me! He played a game with you, went to the park, <br/>
had a grocery outing, did math with daddy, did a math game alone, it&#39;s yucky <br/>
outside and he just felt like chillin&#39; out with an educational science <br/>
video....sounds great!<br/>
<br/>
My son loves the magic school bus shows and books. In fact after watching one <br/>
about the body, he demanded to see everyone&#39;s esophagus! (we went to the <br/>
bathroom mirror to see the back of the throat constrict and relax) And it <br/>
really spurred a lot of talk about digestion and the whole process. In fact, <br/>
almost all of those shows have really sparked some cool stuff, rotting <br/>
logs-we went to the compost heap, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-721410593">How old did you say Zak was? around 5? sounds like a more full day than<br/>
kindergarten with the teacher controlling his every move. I bet he could<br/>
tell you all kind of things about those dinosaurs. He played math games,<br/>
spent time with dad. When my boys were that age they would play the same<br/>
movie over and over many times. Then, suddenly it would be a different<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hi All:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m having a hard time today.  Zak is watching the Magic School Bus (the<br/>
&gt; dinosaur one) for the 3rd time.  He&#39;s also been doing The Land Before Time<br/>
&gt; Math on his computer for a while.  I&#39;ve offered to do other things with<br/>
him.<br/>
&gt; But no he only wants to do what he wants to do.  He did let me play a game<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; Dinosaur Monopoly when my 2 year old was asleep... So what&#39;s the problem<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; are asking?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s me... I feel like he ought to be doing more or I ought to be &quot;making&quot;<br/>
&gt; him do more by offering him more things.  He went to the park this morning<br/>
&gt; for an hour with his dad and brother, then the grocery store and since<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; we&#39;ve been home.  It&#39;s about 96 and hummid outside and he just wants to<br/>
watch<br/>
&gt; The Magic School Bus....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So help me let go of this need to want to take control and also the<br/>
thoughts<br/>
&gt; that he ought to be &quot;doing&quot; more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He also did some math this morning with DH.  He thinks it&#39;s puzzles and he<br/>
&gt; did that for about 20 mins.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So some emotional support and support that this is normal and I&#39;ll get<br/>
used<br/>
&gt; to this and the guilt will go away....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2354364">96 and humid outside -- this smart kid figures out a fun inside activity or <br/>
2.  Sounds great to me.  <br/>
<br/>
Hey -- Dad finally made it home last night -- we went fishing -- fun.  But!  <br/>
Hot.  So we got home and were inside the rest of the day.  In and out a <br/>
little but basically inside.  Not reading Chaucer either!!<br/>

Have fun!<br/>
