That&#39;s likely, and makes sense.<br/>

Sandra, I must say that one thing I really appreciate about you is the<br/>
way you persist in getting people to clarify their mental processes.  I<br/>
think a really important component of unschooling needs to be an<br/>
awareness of clear communication, because it is so hard as it is to get<br/>
newbies to wrap their minds and hearts around some of the concepts. <br/>
Thanks to all who share along the way.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
Much of unschooling is developing ones own understanding of learning <br/>
processes, and increasing one&#39;s own confidence.   When people&#39;s own thinking and <br/>
writing is muddly, or they&#39;re asking for simple answer (rules to follow) instead of <br/>
unravelling all the threads of their internal messages and assumptions, <br/>
they&#39;re not moving toward unschooling as well as they could if they sort through <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about these things as I&#39;m adding to my notes for talks at <br/>
the Live and Learn conference, and thinking about cranky detractors of other <br/>
years (gone on to other lists, to avoid people who might persist about their <br/>
mental processes) who have stated very simply and unilaterally and that there is <br/>
nothing to unschooling past just not using a curriculum.   It is no more and <br/>
no less than not using a curriculum.   <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just too simple, and not workable, and the absence of a curriculum in <br/>
the presence of a momload of school thinking and fears and false &quot;truths&quot; is <br/>
not going to create a rich learning environment.   People unwilling to consider <br/>
that are on their way to reverting to a curriculum or putting their kids in <br/>
school, or settling for a half-assed situation of one sort or another.<br/>
