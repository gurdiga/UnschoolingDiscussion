&gt;&gt; HECK YES!<br/>
&gt;&gt; I want to be better today than I was before.  I want to be better<br/>
&gt;&gt; next year  than I am now.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Sandra<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ah, Sandra, what you don&#39;t seem to know is that you sound like you are<br/>
&gt; saying, &quot;Yes I am better than all of YOU.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How on earth does saying &quot;I want to be better today than I was before&quot; sound<br/>
like &quot;I am better than all of you&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all better and worse than all other people in all possible areas of<br/>
knowledge and talent. A child molester may be better than me at violin<br/>
(couldn&#39;t be worse &lt;g&gt;) but much worse than me at child rearing. Michael<br/>
Jordan is billions of times better at basketball than my husband, but I&#39;ll<br/>
bet not as good as Wally at reading a story to our girls.<br/>
<br/>
Striving for excellence in your own spheres of interest and talent is not<br/>
the same as declaring yourself the cat&#39;s ass.<br/>
