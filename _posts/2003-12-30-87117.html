give people names that suit them and make up stories about where they&#39;re going <br/>
and why. The trick is not to enjoy it so openly that people suspect you&#39;re <br/>
laughing at them. We&#39;ve been known to get entirely too wrapped up in it and forget <br/>
what we started out to do. :)  JJ<br/>
