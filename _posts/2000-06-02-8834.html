<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205307010">Julie and Deb,  I picked up &quot;Raising Your Spirited Child&quot;, &quot;The Strong Willed <br/>
Child&quot;, and &quot;Everyday Blessings&quot;  today.  As I was going through  The <br/>
Spirited Child book, I I was amazed at how my son fits the description!!  I <br/>
am looking forward to reading all of these;  Thanks so much for the tips.  <br/>
