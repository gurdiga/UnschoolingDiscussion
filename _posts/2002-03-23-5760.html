<div id="ygrps-yiv-367874918">Pat:  This is meant in the nicest, gentlest possible way.. but maybe you&#39;re<br/>
too scared to let go of control and see what happens.  I know what that<br/>
feeling is like.  Having grown up in an alcoholic family (I&#39;m not suggesting<br/>
you did) I find control of everything to have been a big issue for me.  I<br/>
think that&#39;s why unschooling has presented itself into my life.  It&#39;s given<br/>
me a &quot;real&quot; opportunity to let go and trust that I&#39;m not in charge and that<br/>
both my boys are going to be ok.  I&#39;ve been really listening to people who<br/>
have a lot of experience and have been doing this for a while so that I can<br/>
get centered and say to myself &quot;ok it&#39;s me that&#39;s wanting to control<br/>
everything and I have to be the one to trust in my kids and the process&quot;....<br/>
I hope you decide to give it a try.... However I realize it&#39;s out of my<br/>
control.....<br/>

But they&#39;ve got to have stuff to integrate, first, for those days<br/>
<br/>
to be good<br/>

<br/>
unschooling is just too hard for me. I feel very overwhelmed by all<br/>
<br/>
the changes that have taken place since starting homeschooling this<br/>
<br/>
fall. Maybe I&#39;m just not suited for it.<br/>
