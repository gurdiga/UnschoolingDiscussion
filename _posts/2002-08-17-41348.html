I don&#39;t think anybody here believes that leaving children completely to<br/>
their own devices is going to teach them how to live well or happily. Your<br/>
kids seeem to be following your example (as you describe your own, shall we<br/>
say, &quot;creative&quot; routine and habits) a bit too much for their own good.<br/>
<br/>
Yelling can help, if it is your nature to let off steam once in a while. I<br/>
recall a story told by the wife of an English diplomat living in Brazil in a<br/>
house with servants who spoke only Portugese. Every once in a while, after<br/>
noticing several things out of place or missing (stolen by the servants) she<br/>
simply screamed her feelings, in English, of course,<br/>
&quot;Where&#39;s my whatchamacallit? etc, etc.&quot;<br/>
The servants, feeling guilty and believing she was threatening them with<br/>
terrible punishments for their misdeeds, returned everything to its proper<br/>
place by the next morning, and life carried on.<br/>
<br/>
One of my former wives like to yell. She often became exasperated by things<br/>
-- usually the small twins and their incessant basic needs and demands --<br/>
and would simply yell her frustrations and tell them she was leaving them<br/>
alone until &quot;later.&quot; Sometimes it was quite a long time. (a mother needs a<br/>
break!) It helped her a lot, and the kids got the message to get it together<br/>
on their own. They know we&#39;re in charge, but sometimes we need to remind<br/>
them. They bounce right back, better.<br/>
<br/>
Heather, it&#39;s your house. The kids share it. There need to be rules --<br/>
spoken or unspoken. If you don&#39;t follow them, the kids won&#39;t. Your are not<br/>
unschooling problem, they&#39;re parenting problems, self-control problem. Kids<br/>
like to push the limits. That&#39;s OK, but they need to know that you are<br/>
conscious, too. Live in surroundings of order, cleanliness, peace -- all<br/>
that good stuff -- every day, if possible. That&#39;s a foundation for an<br/>
orderly, clean, peaceful, productive life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling a little preachy just now -- will someone throw some water on<br/>
me, please.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line: From what you describe, I think your kids are asking you for a<br/>
little more direction and for more of your time. They are having problems<br/>
raising themselves. Trust, but watch carefully and participate intimately.<br/>
<br/>
Yell your own feelings about a situation, not to blame them for creating it.<br/>
&quot;THIS IS A MESS !&quot; instead of, &quot;You kids are bad, and should be put in<br/>
horrible unloving homes where wretched people will beat you for all your<br/>
misbehavior and nastyness.&quot;  Notice I didn&#39;t even get into them being born<br/>
in sin without any goodness, or any of that nonsense...   (:-O)<br/>
<br/>
You are their example in life. That&#39;s the hell of it.   :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172460429">Thanks Ned - and the others who answered here...<br/>
<br/>
There have been many suggestions that have been made that I had been toying with - getting up and getting myself together BEFORE they get up... as well as - trying to create order in my own space - and leading by example instead of trying to make them behave in a way that I am not doing myself... It&#39;s amazing that it sometimes takes an outside opinion to make you see what you have already suspected. <br/>
<br/>
I think so often I won&#39;t just say no to things because I am trying so hard not to be limiting. My mother never let me cook - because it was her kitchen. I always let my daughter cook - with supervision of course ;) but she is a great baker and I know she has learned fractions, measuring etc. by cooking.  She also isn&#39;t afraid to just try things - if a recipe is 5 pages long, she will sit there and follow it step by step - and figure it out. I would tend to look at it and say - another day!   So I am working towards a certain atmosphere here - but it is absolutley true that I can&#39;t expect from them what I am not modelling myself...  It will be a bit of a learning experience here.   I think sometimes it&#39;s a pyshcological battle of trying NOT to be &quot;scheduled&quot; - but I suppose unscheduled doesn&#39;t have to mean messy!  <br/>
<br/>
 I have a friend whose childern had a basket of beanie babies in their room. ( at the time when they wer worth something ;)  She always let her girls play with them. Now we had a bunch, but whenever my kids played with them - the tags got all ripped off -  so I put them all away -  Later in watching my friend I realized that she often sat down and played beanie babies with them. So they didn&#39;t learn the habits of being destructive when they played.  Not that having the tags ripped off is incredibly destructive... I have never understood the mentality of having 100 beanie babies which we don&#39;t touch beause they are collectible - I have almost considered selling them all on ebay so I don&#39;t have to worry about it :) <br/>
<br/>
Ayway, thanks for the thoughts...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008565124">We&#39;ve always cut the tags off of them.  I figured I&#39;m buying them for <br/>
their play value, not their collectable value.  My daughter found a <br/>
new Beanie Baby magazine that she likes.  She&#39;s learned how to use <br/>
ebay to look for beanie babies, and has practiced addition and money <br/>
skills in figuring which auctions she can afford to bid on.   <br/>
