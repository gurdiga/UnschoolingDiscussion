&gt;I haven&#39;t read everything you&#39;ve all been talking about concerning<br/>
&gt;punishment, but I&#39;d just like to let anyone know who is interested<br/>
&gt;that I have a webpage for Christians about why spanking and<br/>
&gt;corporeal punishment is not Biblical, explaining it with scripture.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I personally believe that punishment is not in keeping with the<br/>
&gt;whole idea of unschooling.  Let the consequences of their own<br/>
&gt;actions teach them.<br/>

<br/>
Basically, it boils down to the fact that the Law of Moses, the <br/>
Torah, the first five books of the Bible, were considered to contain <br/>
every command necessary for one to be perfect.  If you could follow <br/>
every command therein, you were considered right with God.  <br/>
There are only three passages in those books that say anything <br/>
about childrearing, and NONE of them talk about spanking.  So, if <br/>
the children of Israel were not required to spank in order to be <br/>
perfect before God, why should we?<br/>
