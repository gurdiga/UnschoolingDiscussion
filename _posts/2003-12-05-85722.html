You&#39;re scused because I don&#39;t know either. <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re little tiny dudes who came in a box of models and contraptions a<br/>
friend gave Dylan. <br/>
<br/>
Someone from the list has already snagged them, so maybe they can<br/>
enlighten you. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003944452">I do not get to post for another week!!!!! However in light of <br/>
enlightenment I will give you all of my knowledge, which is next to <br/>
nothing. Warhammer is a role playing boardgame. Very complex from my <br/>
understanding. And those action figures.. Better known as Dark Eldar <br/>
Warriors are part of the play. We however had a mishap with my sons. <br/>
My daughter borrowed them  several year ago for a project she did in <br/>
sixth grade. THe kids in her middle school stole them. I was <br/>
thrilled when I saw Deb looking for a good home.My son who will be <br/>
20 in February will get some guys back. <br/>

PS&gt;&gt;&gt; I have enjoyed reading everyones posts..  <br/>
