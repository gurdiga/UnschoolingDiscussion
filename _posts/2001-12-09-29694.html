&gt; &gt;I am in California - in the Santa Cruz Mountains.  I&#39;ve been here over<br/>
&gt; &gt;25 years and I never heard of them either.  Somehow they mutate and have<br/>
&gt; &gt;white needles - they can grow to about 20 feet high in part of a nursery<br/>
&gt; &gt;ring - that ring of little trees that pop up when a big, old one dies.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I saw two at Henry Cowell State Park and a friend says there are some<br/>
&gt; &gt;at Big Basin.  Fred, our nature walk leader, says that there is a network<br/>
&gt; &gt;of people who know where they are but since some people have come along<br/>
&gt; &gt;and destroyed the trees, their locations are only given to people who<br/>
&gt; &gt;can be trusted to keep them safe.  I don&#39;t know if this is a recent<br/>
&gt; &gt;phenomena or not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cool.  If you ever get pictures of them, I&#39;d love to see them.  I doubt<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll ever get down to actually see them in the flesh, so to speak.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; wanted to go down for a visit for a long time, but have never had the money<br/>
&gt; to do it right.  (The last time I was down was over 20 years ago when my<br/>
&gt; grandmother died, and I had no car to get to my favorite old haunts.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So do they only grow to about 20 feet and then die or what?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We found a new one today!  We went to a Christmas tree farm to cut our<br/>
tree.  As we were sitting paying for our tree, Megan shouts, &quot;there&#39;s<br/>
an albino redwood.&quot;  I didn&#39;t have the camera or I would have taken a<br/>
picture.  I will try on Momday - I think they&#39;d make a neat picture!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what happens when they get to 20 feet.  I would think that<br/>
since the nourishment they get is from the other trees in their ring, that<br/>
would be as tall as they could get.  Since the needles have no chlorophyll,<br/>
they have to get everything from their sibling trees.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda do you know if there are albino trees in your area?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217035762">As far as I know,  these trees are white for two reasons.  1) Something goes<br/>
wrong with their cell development when they first grow and they don&#39;t have<br/>
or properly use the cells that produce green and 2) they don&#39;t get enough<br/>
sunlight for the fewer or mutated cells that they have.  Now, theoretically<br/>
they shouldn&#39;t be able to survive but they do because they get what they<br/>
need from the &quot;mother&quot; tree.<br/>
<br/>
Up here there are some in Founder&#39;s Grove and Women&#39;s Federation Grove<br/>
(don&#39;t know if they still have any) and the few others I had heard of up<br/>
here since the 1980s (when Palco bought up everything) were so far back and<br/>
only accessible by logging roads that you couldn&#39;t get to them.  Also, Palco<br/>
is such a [fill in the blank with harsh word(s) of choice] that as soon as<br/>
anything like that appears they destroy them!  They have also bulldozed all<br/>
the &quot;ghost&quot; towns and old mining camps that date back to the 1850s.<br/>
<br/>
Also, tourists are inclined to kill off the babies by taking limbs and<br/>
twigs.  And, the thing is once they dry out you can&#39;t tell a white from a<br/>
green, they both turn the same color brown.<br/>
<br/>
We use to hear about them all the time before Palco bought almost all the<br/>
land up here.  The the folks of European descent called them fairy rings and<br/>
the local First Nations folks called them prayer rings or medicine rings.<br/>
They had lots of stories about them.  Among First Nations peoples all living<br/>
things were considered &quot;brothers&quot; and &quot;sisters.&quot;  However, about half way<br/>
between us (Sonoma County) were the Pomo and they didn&#39;t like the forests,<br/>
considered them haunted.  Which is real different.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a link that has a reference to the albino redwoods.  I have one of<br/>
those suckers that supposedly won&#39;t grow (Baby Armstrong is about 7&#39; tall<br/>
now) which I took off the Colonel Armstrong tree (bad Lynda &lt;g&gt;) from the<br/>
Armstrong Grove out on the Russian River.<br/>

<br/>
It is hard to get a picture of them that really shows the &quot;white&quot; because<br/>
they reflect the colors around them in photos.<br/>

Lynda, who will shut up now but ya picked one of my favorite things &lt;g&gt;<br/>

one again we make sure no one can see us going off the trail.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to know that they are up there too!  <br/>
<br/>
I have a redwood tree here that is probably 800-900 years old.  It has<br/>
a big burn scar on it so it wasn&#39;t logged when they went thru here in<br/>
the 60s and 70s!  I really love redwoods - there&#39;s no other tree quite<br/>
like them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-496158443">Well, I call them the only &quot;real&quot; trees &lt;g&gt;  The rest are just over grown<br/>
shrubs and future telephone poles &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And, folks, as those that have been there can attest, there is nothing else<br/>
in the world like being in a grove of, particularly old growth, redwoods.<br/>
It is like stepping back in time and has a sprititual effect on folks,<br/>
regardless of religious beliefs.  I took a friend that is an athiest and she<br/>
has been working hard to explain away the way she felt.<br/>
<br/>
If you ever get a chance, visit a grove that is off the beaten path!<br/>
