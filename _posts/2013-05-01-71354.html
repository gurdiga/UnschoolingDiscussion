<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139405045">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My nearly 6-year-old son, Tommy, is very interested in the meaning of words.  He is also into dinosaurs and all animals.  He wants to know what their names mean.  While I look up individual names, it takes awhile, I fall behind on the questions while I look for bits and pieces here and there.  I was wondering if some basic latin might offer us a handful of things that we can refer to on-the-go.  Does anyone have any recommendations on a resource or better idea?  Maybe just a dictionary?!   I&#39;ve looked online and there are quite a few beginner books etc...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How about looking them up himself? Some tablets allow you to speak questions. (Maybe some laptops and desktops too.)<br/>
<br/>
Or finding an app or website that breaks words down and defines what their pieces mean. Then have a shortcut to that site to make looking up a lot easier.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s going to learn a lot more Latin absorbed from the words he&#39;s interested in than learning Latin words that may never come up in case he might need it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-193234817">The best dictionary I know of for etymology is American Heritage, but they have some editions that leave the etymological notes out.<br/>
<br/>
But nowadays, the easiest thing is to use is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://etymonline.com">http://etymonline.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Or look up the word with the word &quot;etymology&quot; and you&#39;ll read cool stories of words!<br/>
<br/>
Here are some fun examples, too.<br/>
