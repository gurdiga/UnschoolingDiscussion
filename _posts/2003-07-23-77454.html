 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;m surely glad you feel the need to write. I has changed MY life!<br/>
<br/>
And I feel I need to add that this list, though I unsubbed TWICE due to Lynda <br/>
and once because of a woman in NC (can&#39;t remember her name) and *almost * did <br/>
during the Bridget phase, has been my life-line to peaceful parenting and <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m eternally indebted to Helen for starting this list (although I&#39;m not <br/>
thrilled with the new splits!) and the message board. Not only have I and my <br/>
family benefitted, but it spawned School&#39;s Out Support and the Live & Learn <br/>
Unschooling Conference, so it&#39;s helped others *through* me.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to MANY of you for making my life, my family members&#39; lives, and <br/>
the lives of HUNDREDS of others more joyful and peaceful--and sometimes <br/>
downright funny! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly, incredibly grateful<br/>

Writing is my way of paying back the people -- Sandra, PamS, Pam Hartley and<br/>
others who were on AOL -- who helped me and the new people who are still<br/>
helping me :-)<br/>

The first few years I helped people as penance for having talked my cousin <br/>
Nada out of homeschooling her first.  She ended up with five kids, and some <br/>
hated school.  When she had four still home, I talked her into homeschooling, and <br/>
some were out some of the time after that, but I felt AWFUL for having <br/>
discouraged her and I owed the universe a big debt.<br/>
<br/>
I had decided to help for four years to make up for that.  After that, I just <br/>
kept going, and thought of Lori Odhner and Carol Rice who helped me SO much <br/>
when Kirby was little and they had older unschooled kids.  <br/>
