<div id="ygrps-yiv-801884777">Well, I meant to stay out of this debate going on with<br/>
Sandra and Robin and Collette and others, but I do<br/>
have something to say.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you&#39;re not angry, you&#39;re not paying attention.&quot;<br/>
John Irving<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Be happy while you&#39;re living, for you&#39;re a long time<br/>
dead.&quot; Scottish proverb<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I feel there&#39;s room in this world for people who are<br/>
&quot;paying attention&quot; and feel energized by trying to<br/>
right wrongs. And I feel there&#39;s room in this world<br/>
for people who find paying that much attention to be<br/>
too painful or joy-destroying or simply overwhelming.<br/>
Let&#39;s let Sandra choose to live her life embracing the<br/>
good she sees, but let&#39;s allow Robin and Collette to<br/>
use their anger about the many wrongs in the world to<br/>
improve it. I think it&#39;s important to accept different<br/>
tempraments in adults, too. Some of us are fighters<br/>
against injustice while others are nurturing and<br/>
serene. Live and let live. <br/>
<br/>
Juli, who is a little of both<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733963649">Oh Juli, I love you -- will you be my best friend?!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Composing myself&gt; -- see, it&#39;s just I loved what you said and how you said <br/>
it, and John Irving is one of my favorite authors (and try to find other John <br/>
Irving fans who live around Richmond, VA).<br/>
<br/>
Gotta go taxi kids around! :)<br/>
