&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The reality is that there are an untold number of animals euthenized<br/>
&gt; every<br/>
&gt; &gt; year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That is true.  However, it is possible to look at that fact and come<br/>
&gt; to an opposite conclusion about what to do about it.  It would be<br/>
&gt; entirely possible to come to the conclusion that the right thing to do<br/>
&gt; would be to stop euthenizing.  Let the &quot;unwanted&quot; cats go free and<br/>
&gt; live in the wild.  Some will die, some will not.  Either way, they are<br/>
&gt; a natural part of the food chain and survival of the fittest will come<br/>
&gt; back into play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;  However, if they decided they wanted to go out and<br/>
&gt; shot<br/>
&gt; &gt; squirrels and hawks and everyother thing that moved, the anwer would<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;that&#39;s where your choices end and my parental responsibilities kick<br/>
&gt; in.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wouldn&#39;t allow my children to shoot animals just for the fun of<br/>
&gt; shooting them.  However, if they were shooting squirrels and wanted me<br/>
&gt; to fix them for supper, that would be great!  I&#39;ve eaten squirrel meat<br/>
&gt; and it&#39;s quite good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am curious however as to how your religious beliefs cover this.<br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt; &gt; fundamentalist xtians I know don&#39;t approve of animals being used as<br/>
&gt; how-to<br/>
&gt; &gt; or science projects.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe that we are caretakers of the earth.  I have really become<br/>
&gt; convicted lately of all the garbage we throw out that will never<br/>
&gt; decompose, or will possibly decompose thousands of years from now.  I<br/>
&gt; am hugely in favor of recycling.  I also believe that we are to care<br/>
&gt; for animals.  We are also to use them for our benefit. &quot;Rule over<br/>
&gt; them&quot; is the exact wording.  We may eat them, make clothes out of<br/>
&gt; them, conduct experiments on them.  Dd also wants to breed rabbits for<br/>
&gt; medical labs and I have no problems with that.  That doesn&#39;t mean we<br/>
&gt; go shooting everything that moves just for the fun of killing.  That<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t being a good caretaker.  It does mean that when there is a<br/>
&gt; legitimate use for an animal, you use the animal for whatever it is<br/>
&gt; you need.<br/>

still looking for their new homes that would in no way survive if I opened <br/>
the cages today and let them all go and be thankful that at least these <br/>
have a roof, food and someone that cares.<br/>
