<br>
<br>I like the way you think!
<br>
<br>I believe also that even though we have different religious and political 
<br>views, respect for each other is most important.
<br>
<br>I believe that what unites us is this: &nbsp;We are all mom&#39;s that are 
<br>homeschooling becuase we believe it is the best thing for our child/children. 
<br>&nbsp;So whether as a mom we breast fed or not, (i didn&#39;t) or we immunize or not 
<br>(i did) or we are Christian or Pagan, (christian) homeschool all or one, 
<br>(one, right now) we are united by that universal &quot;mom&quot; thread of love.
<br>
<br>I wish you luck and welcome you to the loop!
<br>
