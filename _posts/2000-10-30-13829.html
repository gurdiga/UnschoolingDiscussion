<div id="ygrps-yiv-883911241">My second son was NOT unschooled - he went to ps and hated every <br/>
moment of it - but that is a long time ago, before i had heard of <br/>
unschooling.  However - *IF* he had been unschooled he would have <br/>
spent every minute of every day taking motors to bits and putting <br/>
them back together again.  He would have been in his element - a <br/>
perfect candidate for home schooling. And i would have had nothing to <br/>
do with motovating this interest.................<br/>
I wish I could say the same about my youngest daughter who i am <br/>
unschooling - this is our first year she is 12yrs old and has no <br/>
interests and little motivaton!!!!<br/>
Is it *THE* age or have they just spent tooooo long at ps!!<br/>

<br/>
It is *not* the age, and it is *not* your kids. They are acting perfectly <br/>
normally for kids who have spent years in a setting where they are given very <br/>
little freedom to make their own decisions. Give her time. It will pass. <br/>
Continue to provide her with a variety of opportunities and things to play <br/>
around with (art supplies, tools, the kitchen, the computer, nature, etc.) <br/>
and she will find her interests. Everyone has interests, she just may not <br/>
know what they are or how to articulate them yet. <br/>
<br/>
Let her see you following your interests and really enjoying it. My daughter <br/>
has jumped into a lot of things that she wouldn&#39;t have thought to try, <br/>
because she saw me having such a good time. Your daughter&#39;s been in school <br/>
for seven years? That equates to about 7 months of deschooling. It may seem <br/>
like wasted time, but it really is a chance for the child to get to know <br/>
herself again.<br/>
