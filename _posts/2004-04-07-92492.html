LOL!!!!  You have made my night!  I needed a good laugh :-)  I pretty much said the same thing to my mother when she started in on all that nonsense.  Now about the farms......I can&#39;t wait to move to mine!  Right now we only have horses but my dh is so excited about getting a couple of goats to eat the underbrush on some of the land that needs clearing.  I told him you might be a redneck if, you were more excited about getting yours goats than you were the house!   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for brightening my evening!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831856587">I love my 2 goats!  They eat the gorse, are friendly & affectionate. For <br/>
me getting the hens was my first priority when we moved onto our land, <br/>
but the then 13yo got his dog first - been promised since he was 3!   We <br/>
got both before we got our house - we lived in the garage for 2 years <br/>
:-)  And though we are living in our house now, it is still far from <br/>
finished.  But we have the goats, the dog, 2 cats, a heifer, 10 hens, a <br/>
rabbit ummmm I think that&#39;s all so far.  <br/>

I must be a redneck!!<br/>
<br/>
We are just now looking for property in West Texas.  I want to run goats and<br/>
perhaps make cheese.  I just love our dairy goats.<br/>
<br/>
Further evidence of redneckdom....our septic tank died and the ground has to<br/>
dry out before they can replace it....so we have rigged up a shower in the<br/>
garage, ordered a porta-potty, and will be washing clothes by hand.<br/>
Everyone is thrilled but my dh and my 13yo dd.  She plans to move in with a<br/>
friend until normalcy returns.<br/>
