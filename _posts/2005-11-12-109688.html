<div id="ygrps-yiv-867515696">A guy called Alan Thomas, who is an education<br/>
researcher in Australia, has done some REALLY<br/>
interesting research into what he calls &quot;informal<br/>
learning,&quot; using homeschoolers (he doesn&#39;t use<br/>
the word unschoolers) as his research group. He<br/>
examines (in detail) the informal interactions of<br/>
parents and children (i.e. just talking, hanging<br/>
out, living life -- unschooling) and reports on<br/>
their educational value. He is extremely<br/>
impressed with how much children learn in this<br/>
way and compares it favorably with how they learn<br/>
in school.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a sample (from<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.infed.org/biblio/home-education.htm)">http://www.infed.org/biblio/home-education.htm)</a>:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In school, the curriculum determines the process<br/>
of teaching and learning. It is structured<br/>
logically in easily digestible steps in order to<br/>
facilitate learning. Essentially, the job of the<br/>
student is to follow a learning sequence that is<br/>
predetermined. But when children learn<br/>
informally, they seem to do the opposite and<br/>
impose their own sequence on what they learn.<br/>
Curriculum logic and child logic do not equate.<br/>
Child logic is individual and determined by the<br/>
complex and dynamic interplay between the childs<br/>
existing level of knowledge and incoming<br/>
information, mediated by interest, motivation,<br/>
curiosity or desire to take on a challenge. Its<br/>
as if each child has his or her own theory of<br/>
learning. It is quite efficient because new<br/>
knowledge and understanding are only assimilated<br/>
when they extend existing knowledge. The converse<br/>
equally contributes to the efficiency of informal<br/>
learning  when new material is unlikely to<br/>
dovetail into and extend knowledge or<br/>
understanding it is discarded. This utterly<br/>
contradicts conventional school learning in which<br/>
students are expected to persevere when they do<br/>
not comprehend, often acquiring no more than a<br/>
superficial level of understanding, what has been<br/>
called surface learning (Biggs, 1987). Informal<br/>
learning therefore follows a kind of fuzzy and<br/>
non-linear logic that is particular to each<br/>
child. It has a parallel in the childs<br/>
acquisition of language, learned in a similar<br/>
fashion and equally individualistic (Crystal,<br/>
1976). Perhaps informal learning is better suited<br/>
to the innumerable connections and networks in<br/>
the cerebral cortex. Whatever the case, it works,<br/>
and without all the effort associated with formal<br/>
learning. . . &quot;<br/>

Same things we&#39;ve been saying on message boards and lists for ten years, only <br/>
he&#39;s &quot;a researcher&quot; and will think he discovered it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Researchers have known this since before I was in college in the 70&#39;s.   <br/>
Cognition studies have said since the 60&#39;s or early that you can&#39;t learn <br/>
anything that doesn&#39;t connect to something you already know.<br/>
<br/>
And that whole individual learning is the ONLY way anyone can learn.    <br/>
<br/>
Each child builds his own model of the universe.<br/>
School tries to insert one but it can&#39;t.   It just can&#39;t be done.   Either <br/>
the child takes the school parts and builds his (I did) or he rejects those <br/>
parts because he can&#39;t find a place to fit them, or because he just hates them and <br/>
resents their delivery, and that&#39;s called &quot;forgetting.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Or short-term memory. <br/>
Or cramming for the test.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940000987">That&#39;s a good page, Melissa!   Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of what my friend living in England said.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Most families who start out &quot;doing school&quot; at home find that what works <br/>
in school does not transfer easily to the home. Of necessity, home educators <br/>
find themselves pioneering new educational approaches, nearly always less formal <br/>
ones.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
She was writing a presentation for some government archeology something <br/>
there, and sent some of it to me for comment.   She had said that most home <br/>
educators use unschooling or natural learning.   I told her that wasn&#39;t true.   She <br/>
said it seemed true where she was.   I said it&#39;s absolutely NOT true here.<br/>
<br/>
She was out here for a few weeks, and though she could&#39;ve found the same info <br/>
with google from her home, she&#39;s a busy person.   But being on vacation and <br/>
considering homeschooling resources for when they move back in a year, maybe, <br/>
she started looking at local sources and U.S. sites, and was appalled at how <br/>
much repression and more-conservative-than-school stuff she found.<br/>
<br/>
But the reverse of that is that maybe the U.K and Australia are NOT in the <br/>
curriculum-focussed morass so many American homeschoolers are.    I&#39;m guessing <br/>
Canada is less likely to have the fundamentalist Christian or uber-competitive <br/>
&quot;well-trained mind&quot; kind of stuff than we have.   I HOPE so.<br/>
<br/>
That could be pretty easily researched--WHY does a family want to be more <br/>
schooly than school, while another family wants to be less schooly than school.<br/>
