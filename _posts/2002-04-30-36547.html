&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you start when they&#39;re fifteen it&#39;s not going to work as well as it will<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a risk I guess we&#39;ll have to take.<br/>
<br/>
I will confess that some of what I&#39;ve read here about food pushes my<br/>
buttons.  I do not know many homeschoolers; however, some that I do know<br/>
homeschool on a tight budget.  I&#39;d like to think I&#39;m still unschooling, even<br/>
if I&#39;m not affluent.  Even if I can&#39;t afford what other people might<br/>
consider necessary.  It never struck me that they&#39;d be connected.<br/>
<br/>
I hope my child grows up to know that his parents made choices to do things<br/>
they believed in, wholeheartedly, rather than those that might pay more<br/>
money.  Even if it limited *his* choices in certain things.<br/>

&gt;significant, but it is the discarding of schoolishness -- no assignments, no<br/>
&gt;tests, no grades .<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you, Pam.  I know you weren&#39;t referring to food at this point, but<br/>
this made me feel better.  It&#39;s somehow what I think of unschooling to be.<br/>
(But then again, maybe I don&#39;t get it.)<br/>

If my kids only got ice cream once a month, they would eat it all (as it was <br/>
doled out).  If they can eat all they want, it&#39;s still only bought once a <br/>
month.  <br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t binge.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid there were six in the family and donuts were very rare.  If <br/>
a dozen donuts came in, two were mine.  Within a couple of hours they were <br/>
gone.<br/>
<br/>
If a dozen donuts come in here (it&#39;s rare, but when they do), they sit.  I <br/>
eat one.  One of the kids will eat half.  After a couple of days they&#39;re <br/>
gone, and sometimes the last two are dipping only.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that those who limit food have the vision that those who <br/>
don&#39;t have kids eating all the time, and that ice cream or donuts are bought <br/>
every day.  That&#39;s not nearly true.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only related to unschooling in the philosophical way--of treating <br/>
children like people, not like kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Our food choices came before the unschooling, because we started that when we <br/>
still figured the kids would go to school.  Their choices about foods (and <br/>
clothes) made it easier for us to say &quot;Sure, whatever!&quot; about videos, books, <br/>
games, bedtimes, activities, etc.<br/>

<br/>
This certainly does describe every unschooling parent I personally know.  But <br/>
it&#39;s not a financial consideration, on the food.  It&#39;s a philosophical one.  <br/>
And I wholeheartedly believe that giving them choices now (about learning and <br/>
other aspects of their lives) will make their lives easier and better <br/>
throughout.<br/>

<br/>
It might be worth a moment for you to think about why then. You might end up <br/>
with the exact same opinions, or you might be prompted to look at some of <br/>
those hot button issues differently. Doesn&#39;t hurt to take them out and give <br/>
them a look once in awhile, eh? It forces us to really look at why we make <br/>
the decisions we do.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. :o) We can only do and offer from what we&#39;ve got. I&#39;ve just <br/>
found it better for the kids, to let them *have* the choice from what we&#39;ve <br/>
got at any given moment, rather than making some items special by declaring <br/>
them temporarily off-limits. They really DO make good choices. I&#39;m not <br/>
seeing kids with constant candy in their mouths or never-ending TV zombie <br/>
faces.<br/>
