<div id="ygrps-yiv-348339731">Hi,<br/>
 We are looking into the possibility of moving to Ojai, Ca. I was <br/>
wondering if there are any unschoolers there.  My boy will turn 13 in <br/>
a few days and we are looking for kids perhaps between the ages of 12 <br/>
and 16. He interested in (to name a few) skate boarding, bike riding, <br/>
street luging, computers and wants to learn computer animation and <br/>
programing, legos, building forts, working with wood, Playstation 2<br/>
  Also are there any unschooling groups in the area who meet together <br/>
on a regular basis? <br/>
  He is part of Laurel Springs school, a long distance homeschooling <br/>
umbrella school, which is located in Ojai. His teacher is in Ventura <br/>
and is totally supporting and encouraging his self-directed learning <br/>
style.  We live up in the foothills of the Seirra Nevada Mountains <br/>
now and there are no other homeschoolers up here and not alot to do <br/>
socially.  My boy (and myself) really need some other association of <br/>
those who have the same learning philosophy.<br/>
  Hoping to hear from someone soon.<br/>
Govinda</div>
