<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330744755">When I was really little there was a TV show called &quot;Circus Boy&quot; and though I <br/>
was too little to understand much, I LOVED watching it and seeing the animals <br/>
and costumes and knowing that this boy was living there, not in a regular <br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if I should add that to my &quot;things that made unschooling easy for <br/>
me.&quot;  Maybe!<br/>
