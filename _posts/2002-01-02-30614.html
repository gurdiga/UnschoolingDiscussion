<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509879516">On the nature vs. nurture question about &#39;messiness&#39;,  I go strongly with<br/>
nature over nurture as the origin.  I do,  however,  believe nurture has an<br/>
effect.  Even perhaps that the nurture part (over which parents have a<br/>
strong influence) needs to accomodate for the nature of the person.  I have<br/>
the &#39;messy gene&#39; as does my hubby.  During her toddlerhood,  my now 6 yr old<br/>
seemed born organized....maybe we influenced it out of her,  but she&#39;s<br/>
totally a messy one now! LOL<br/>
    I am a Flybaby, too.  Since August 2001.  I worked the program...down to<br/>
the shoes...through October.  I felt like Wonder Woman!  The diffeerence in<br/>
our house was not the only noticable difference.  My parental stress level<br/>
was diminished immensely.  The time we saved looking for shoes, socks,<br/>
hairbrushes,  clothes was totally amazing.  No more yelling mom when we had<br/>
to go somewhere.   In true SHE fashion,  I began to take on too many other<br/>
responsibilities including  handmaking five Halloween costumes.  Mind you,<br/>
I not only didn&#39;t own a sewing machine before this,  but completely learned<br/>
sewing on my own!  And the old machine I bpought needed to be taken out and<br/>
tuned up!  I hosted a great first birthday party for my son&#39;s halloween<br/>
birthday,  and had several out-of town guests for the weekend of his party.<br/>
It was as if Martha Stewart herself had possesed my being!   I baked and<br/>
decorated the cakes and catered the weekend.  On top of that - my three yr<br/>
old,  caught up in the excitement of a visit from her out of town cousins,<br/>
crashed into a corner and split her head wide open.  This crisis was handled<br/>
quite smoothly.  Flylady&#39;s program had gotten me so far that it was NO<br/>
problem to save my bllod stained shirt...I had a clean one right there ready<br/>
to go (This is quite a major coup for one such as I!!)  The weekend went so<br/>
smoothly!  And halloween was a Wednesday.  I invited all the neighborhood<br/>
kidlets to my house 1/2 hour before trick or treat to have home baked<br/>
cookies and sing to my son.   I got through all this well.  BUT,  by mid Nov<br/>
ember,  I had worn out my shoes from wearing them every day  and couldn&#39;t<br/>
find a pair to fit my wide feet.  I quit the shoes....and things have<br/>
unraveled a bit from there,  my son stopped sleeping through the night,  I<br/>
couldn&#39;t darg myself out of bed for the routines.  I fell back to Fly baby<br/>
(thought I had reached fly toddlerhood).  And have remained at the beginning<br/>
point since.  I&#39;ve still progressed a lot.  But it&#39;s a struggle now.<br/>
    What I&#39;ve noticed in my life is that while I&#39;m quite capable of<br/>
organizing thoughts and ideas,  I have not experienced the ability to manage<br/>
the &quot;basics&quot; of maintaining an organizational system.  I can GET things<br/>
organized,  but not maintain them.  BUT,  I function better in an organized<br/>
environment.  I think it may be why some people think they need school - it<br/>
provides a routine and structure within which they can function.<br/>
    For me,  I want to provide the type of environment which will enable my<br/>
children to thrive (FLY?).  Flylady has helped decrease our stress and<br/>
increase the fun in our household.<br/>

&gt;   Hi Nichoel,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;m still a Flybaby, but I think it will work for me too if I stick with<br/>
&gt;   it and give it a good try.  When she starts talking about CHAOS and<br/>
&gt;   being a perfectionist, etc., I feel like she&#39;s talking about me.  I<br/>
&gt;   relate to what she says very well.<br/>

&gt;   &gt;   things and make this place more presentable.  Are you familiar with<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; &gt; I can&#39;t help but wonder... his mother and grandmother were clean<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; freaks... so he was getting the modeling there... BUT what happened? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What happened is that he was taught that WOMEN cleaned<br/>
&gt; &gt; up these messes, not men.  My husband (Korean) was brought<br/>
&gt; &gt; up the very same way as your husband.  In his home, men never<br/>
&gt; &gt; lifted a finger.  From the moment they walked through the door, to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the moment they left the house, the women waited on them hand<br/>
&gt; &gt; and foot.  Food was brought to them, and dirty dishes were taken<br/>
&gt; &gt; away and washed.  They would dump dirty clothes on the floor and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the clothes were scooped up by the women, washed, folded and put<br/>
&gt; &gt; back into drawers.  When hubby needed new underwear, his Mom<br/>
&gt; &gt; ran out and bought them for him (this was when he was 25!!).  At<br/>
&gt; &gt; dinner, if his drink was almost finished, she would jump up to refill<br/>
&gt; &gt; it for him before it was empty.  Same with his rice bowl.  His mother<br/>
&gt; &gt; always cut up the meat for her husband so he wouldn&#39;t have to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; bothered cutting his own meat.  She also took the bones out of fish<br/>
&gt; &gt; for him, again, so he could eat without having to work at it.  The men<br/>
&gt; &gt; did NOTHING *in* the house!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It has taken YEARS for me to get my husband to help around the<br/>
&gt; &gt; house.  When we were living with his parents, they would literally<br/>
&gt; &gt; scold him whenever he tried to help me out accusing me of being<br/>
&gt; &gt; a very lazy wife for not doing EVERYTHING for him.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; One time, they literally jumped down my throat because I refused<br/>
&gt; &gt; to peel oranges for him, section them and present them to him on<br/>
&gt; &gt; a plate.  I figured, he&#39;s a grown man, he can peel his own oranges!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nope, we&#39;ve had whole boxes of mandarin oranges go bad because<br/>
&gt; &gt; he refused to peel them himself.  So, I&#39;ve just quit buying oranges.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I could go on and on,,,but I&#39;m sure you get the picture.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So Kolleen, is your house sugar free?  What sweets do you mean when<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; say sweets yes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Pat<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, my house is processed sugar-free.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; There&#39;s something called &#39;Sundrops&#39; which are dead ringers for M&Ms.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; We have cookies (some flavoured with organic cane juice, some with<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; fruit<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; juice)<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Ice cream is organic cane juice sweetened or honey sweetened.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I remember making whipped cream for the kid&#39;s first b&#39;day cake with<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; organic heavy cream and maple syrup.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Peelu is the gum I buy that is sweetened with malt sugars (I think, I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; don&#39;t have a pack on me to look it up).<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Lollipops with malt sugar or honey. And Jellybeans with malt sugar or<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; fruit juice.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Jellos and puddings are also available.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; And there&#39;s a great line of honey sweetened cereals available now.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; On *rare* occasion when we&#39;re away or out and about, my son wants<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &#39;bubble<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; gum&#39;, since the Peelu is minty and he thinks is too spicy. So then, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; only then, we buy Bazooka. Yes, Bazooka. It has refinded sugar BUT it<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t have a lot of the other crap that a lot of gums have. And it<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t have aspartme (sp) which is deadlier than refinded sugar.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Keeping these treats in my purse, or in a goodie backpack that we drag<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; around, is a great way to keep outside influences from making my son<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; feel<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; slighted.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; TV advertisements does make it hard on me. BUT, luckily the health food<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; community has come FAR from the &#39;wheatgrass only&#39; days and now we can<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; some yogurt squeezies (Stonyfield) and some ice pops and *almost*<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; everything else that is marketed towards children sans the junky<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; chemicals.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have no problems when he goes into the goodie drawer (the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; ex-big-bread<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; drawer) and takes what he wants.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I still go with the every - body&#39;s individual and has individual needs<br/>
&gt; &gt;in this area.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Susan<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Agreed here Susan, to each and every body is its own barometer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If one has an insulin problem, then any kind of sugar, slow or fast<br/>
&gt; acting would be a detriment to the body.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;.sugar is sugar is sugar,  organic or not,<br/>
&gt; &gt;your body still reacts with the same hormones,  etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Refined sugar IS more addictive than honey or molasses or fruit sugar. If<br/>
&gt; there is evidence otherwise, I would welcome it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If one doesn&#39;t have an insulin problem, then the choice would be to go<br/>
&gt; towards the natural way, not the processed way. An insulin problem person<br/>
&gt; must limit more than just sugar. They need to limit fruit and other food<br/>
&gt; intake.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In &quot;extended&quot; family, I am an organic household, so is one of my sisters.<br/>
&gt; My other two sisters are not. My niece is not. (she&#39;s just a few years<br/>
&gt; younger than I and has more children)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The organic families have choices for the kids, no limits. They will<br/>
&gt; invariably ask for something to &#39;eat&#39; when they are hungry. As opposed to<br/>
&gt; just go into the cabinet for a nosh when wanting *something*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The processed food families seem to have to limit their children, cajole<br/>
&gt; them to &#39;eat&#39; food and oversee their intake on their choices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Establishing that none of the children spoken of have an insulin problem<br/>
&gt; (as of yet). I say that because processed sugar addictions is a<br/>
&gt; *possible* reason that a genetically disposed child would develop an<br/>
&gt; insulin problem (research is still being done, so no facts yet on this<br/>
&gt; issue).<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve given a lot of thought to what you and the others have been<br/>
&gt; &gt;telling me over the past few days and we have made some changes<br/>
&gt; &gt;around here.  I will no longer be in charge of bed time.  They know<br/>
&gt; &gt;when they are tired and will go to bed if given control.  The reason<br/>
&gt; &gt;we started a bed time routine was to encourage time for quiet<br/>
&gt; &gt;reading.  When I discussed this with the girls today, my older one<br/>
&gt; &gt;said she can&#39;t go to sleep unless she has her reading time so she<br/>
&gt; &gt;will always fit that in.  My younger one said she can&#39;t read at<br/>
&gt; &gt;night because she is usually too tired.  She said she would rather<br/>
&gt; &gt;read in the morning.  My husband was afraid they would stay up too<br/>
&gt; &gt;late and keep us awake.  We agreed that we were to respect each<br/>
&gt; &gt;others need to go to bed at different times.  I will continue to<br/>
&gt; &gt;think about what areas I may still be trying to control things and<br/>
&gt; &gt;give that up, thanks for sharing your thoughts.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Pat<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m so glad for you, Pat. The changes sound good and I think you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; all be happy. Be aware, though... you kids may test you since this is<br/>
&gt; all so new. Don&#39;t be surprised if your dd decides to stay up half the<br/>
&gt; night just to make *sure* you really meant what you said! Stick to<br/>
&gt; your word and I truly believe it&#39;ll be fine. She won&#39;t do that long<br/>
&gt; if she does it at all.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d love to know how it goes... keep us posted!<br/>

&gt; One should do what one gets the most enjoyment or fulfillment from.  If<br/>
&gt; becoming a doctor or a teacher is what makes one feel complete, go for it.<br/>
&gt; If one feels a sense of having done a good job by being a garbage man or a<br/>
&gt; dishwasher, good for them.  If one simply wants to make some money so that<br/>
&gt; one can relax and enjoy life, go for it, who are they hurting?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All this keeping up with the Jones stuff is bunk!  IMHO, of course &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Is there something wrong with this? Is it &quot;better&quot; to be a &quot;hard worker&quot;<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; get more done. . . is it better to be a doctor or teacher than a garbage<br/>
&gt; man<br/>
&gt; &gt; or a dishwasher? Personally, I think relaxing is a lot more fun than<br/>
&gt; working<br/>
&gt; &gt; really hard. :)<br/>

&gt; O.K., it isn&#39;t clutter!  It is that very unique VIP filing system.  That<br/>
&gt; would be VeryImportantPiles.  And we aren&#39;t pack rats.  We are frugal.<br/>
&gt; Someday all of those very good things will be needed once again! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m familiar with flylady... I have a friend who has a problem with<br/>
&gt; &gt; clutter and she follows her advice. I think she&#39;s made some progress<br/>
&gt; &gt; but imo something like that (being a pack rat or clutter keeper or<br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever) is such a hard thing to undo in your makeup. I&#39;m a pack<br/>
&gt; &gt; rat... keep everything except old emails! But I&#39;ve learned to<br/>
&gt; &gt; categorize stuff and put it away in an orderly fashion.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And no, no pics of the inside of my house either! It&#39;s so dirty (who<br/>
&gt; &gt; mentioned cobwebs???!! lol.. I can relate). I&#39;m doing good just to<br/>
&gt; &gt; vacuum up all the pet hair.<br/>
&gt; &gt; btw, two dogs.. not three (how did you count three? Or did the kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; snick one in on me and I&#39;ve just not noticed?) &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the compliments on the pics!<br/>
