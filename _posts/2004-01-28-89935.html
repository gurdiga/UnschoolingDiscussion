<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644659974">My DD is 2.5 years old and my DH and I have recently enrolled her in <br/>
a gymnastics class.  She has been going to Gymboree since she was 6 <br/>
months old and we thought that she would enjoy the gymnastics.  Both <br/>
my husband and myself go to the class with her.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the part that I would like to get some feedback on.  The <br/>
class is much more structured than what she is used to (in gymboree, <br/>
the kids can pretty much run around and play on what they want).  In <br/>
the new gymnastics class, there is a warm up time and then stations <br/>
that they &quot;have&quot; to go and practice on.  <br/>
<br/>
There have only been two classes so far however, after both classes, <br/>
my husband and myself have gotten into arguments about what happened <br/>
(or rather didn&#39;t happen during the class).  Both times, our DD has <br/>
all but refused to do the warm ups.  The first class, she did most <br/>
of them and then she didn&#39;t want to so, we did them and hoped that <br/>
she would join in (which she didn&#39;t).  As soon as they started with <br/>
the stations, she had a great time.  This time, she refused to do <br/>
any of the warm ups and didn&#39;t want to do some of the stations.  I&#39;m <br/>
of the opinion that, if she dosen&#39;t want to do the forward rolls but <br/>
does want to walk on the balance beem then let her walk on the <br/>
balance beem.  What&#39;s the big deal?  But, my husband wants her to go <br/>
in order (as does the teacher who was shooting me dirty looks in <br/>
class today because I let her go out of order) and says that we <br/>
should sit her down and talk to her and tell her that she has to do <br/>
the stations in order.  He hasn&#39;t said what, exactly, he&#39;s going to <br/>
do when she still refuses (though I did ask him that question) he <br/>
says that he will take it on a case by case basis.  <br/>
<br/>
I simply feel that (keep in mind here that she is very sensitive) as <br/>
soon as he takes her aside and starts to tell her that she &quot;has&quot; to <br/>
do the warm ups and stations in order that she will feel embarrassed <br/>
and will know that she has, somehow, disappointed him and will start <br/>
to cry.  What&#39;s the point in that?  My husband says that she needs <br/>
to learn structure some time.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, there is much more to the arguement but I won&#39;t bore you <br/>
with an hour&#39;s worth of yelling.  I just feel that there are <br/>
important things to enforce and not important things and this just <br/>
isn&#39;t that important.  However, I can be very stubborn (which is <br/>
where my DD gets it from) and I sometimes think that my way is the <br/>
only way.  So, I would like to hear some other view points on this <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

That&#39;s one of the things that I told my husband, and there is a <br/>
great park that we found the other day not too far from our house.  <br/>
After my DD listened to us argue all the way home, she looked at my <br/>
DH and said &quot;daddy, I don&#39;t want to roll, I don&#39;t want to hang, I <br/>
don&#39;t want to jump.  I just want to stay at home.&quot;  I think what I <br/>
was saying finally got through to him then because he looked at me <br/>
and almost cried.  I believe that, next week, when we are supposed <br/>
to be in the gym class, my DD and I are going to the park instead.<br/>

Oh, one other thing that he said when I told him that I thought she <br/>
might be too young for this class was that all the other kids are <br/>
her age and they were doing it just fine and seemed to be enjoying <br/>
it.  I told him that those other kids were probably in day care and <br/>
pre-school their whole lives and were used to people telling them <br/>
what to do and when to do it.  Our DD has never gone to day care and <br/>
is used to being able to play where, when, and with what she wants.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205808861">The class doesn&#39;t sound like much fun to me.  I would listen to what<br/>
your daughter is telling you with her words and actions, and drop the<br/>
class.  There are better ways you can spend that time.<br/>
 <br/>
Here are some questions your husband could think about, talk to us<br/>
about, or choose to ignore &lt;G&gt;:<br/>
 <br/>
Why does she need to learn &#39;structure&#39;?  <br/>
 <br/>
What are you hoping she gets out of this class?<br/>
 <br/>
Do you believe that she should do what you want even if she doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to?  If so, why?<br/>
 <br/>
Do you think you have realistic expectations for a 2 year old?<br/>
 <br/>
How do you think forcing this issue will affect your relationship with<br/>
her?<br/>

<br/>
That is how it should be!<br/>
<br/>
Does he want a daughter who is independent and unique<br/>
and self-confident or one that follows the crowd like<br/>
a little sheep?  <br/>
<br/>
How does he feel about unschooling?  It sounds like he<br/>
felt embarrassed and foolish because she didn&#39;t do<br/>
what the other kids were doing.<br/>
<br/>
The money you pay for a class that she isn&#39;t enjoying<br/>
is wasted when you could use it to go to the zoo, the<br/>
park, buy an ice cream cone, and see a movie together.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t have to learn to follow directions and<br/>
stand in line and take turns by being in a class.  <br/>
<br/>
Take her to the playground, and when it is too cold or<br/>
rainy, go to the play area in the mall.  Take a walk,<br/>
tumble in the livingroom.  Have a tea party with all<br/>
the stuffed animals, and then play vet when the snacks<br/>
are gone.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s just a little wee one still.  She doesn&#39;t need<br/>
anyone else than her Momma and Papa right now.  She<br/>
will learn sharing and taking turns and being kind by<br/>
playing with you, and it will come from a desire to<br/>
see you smile rather than because someone else told<br/>
her to share or wait her turn.<br/>
<br/>
I did the same thing with my first born and her little<br/>
brother, not knowing any better.  Oh the money we<br/>
could have saved on soccer, gymnastics, ballet, tennis<br/>
lessons, swimming lessons, preschool... sigh... when I<br/>
could have just PLAYED with them.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I haven&#39;t really learned my lessons, either,<br/>
because recently I asked my 5yo if he would like to<br/>
take a gymnastics class like his big cousin David<br/>
does.  <br/>
<br/>
He said to me, &quot;Will I have to do what the teacher<br/>
says even if I don&#39;t want to?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Probably.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Then I don&#39;t want to.&quot; he said.<br/>
<br/>
This time, I listened.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;So, I would like to hear some other view points on this one.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with everyone else so far. She&#39;s way too young and certainly doesn&#39;t<br/>
sound like she&#39;s into what, or I should say how, they want her to learn. You<br/>
can find a park where she can do all the things she likes. Even the parks<br/>
that have the course to run where they have certain exercises to do. Those<br/>
usually have bars to hang from and even beams to balance on. You can even<br/>
make one yourself at home. Let her have fun without all the pressure to<br/>
perform like all the other little kids.<br/>

it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s any help - you can let your husband know that the kids who didn&#39;t have fun and don&#39;t &quot;fit&quot; into that kind of class aren&#39;t there.  We&#39;ve left classes that were too structured and/or simply uninteresting to my kids.  You don&#39;t always know until you try something.  And I want my kids to know they can try something, change their minds and not &quot;have to finish&quot; everything they start because someone say&#39;s so or because money&#39;s been paid.  And then sometimes, they&#39;ve returned to it when they are older.<br/>
<br/>
My kids liked participating in group activities (not always classes) - but I always found &quot;teachers&quot; who were willing to let my kids follow their own path...and if they didn&#39;t and my kids were not happy - we dropped out of the activity.  I am always very careful to find out cancellation and refund policy before enrolling.  I can not commit my child to 8 weeks, 16 weeks and sometimes 32 weeks of a program when they&#39;ve never done the activity before.  And if I can&#39;t get a refund I carefully evaluate my budget before enrolling, deciding if we can afford the money if they loose interest.<br/>
<br/>
I was once given a full refund by a dance school because I was upfront with the owner about my concerns.  (My dd, 5 at the time - had been asking for ballet, &quot;real ballet&quot; - not the creative movement classes that i hosted. Knowing my dd well, I was not convinced that she wouldn&#39;t be bored)  The schools owner assured me that no one had ever dropped out of her program - and that she has had many homeschoolers in her school.   After three classes, when my dd didn&#39;t want to go anymore as my behavior reflected respect to both dd and owner I received a full refund - even for the classes she had attended &lt;lol&gt;.  A year later, i heard it said that this school &#39;never, ever, ever&#39; gives a refund.  Well - that was not obviously the case.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...as someone already said...they will learn to stand in line (don&#39;t we do that at the grocery store) and they will learn to respectfully wait their turns (given they are allowed to finish their own turns and not pushed off the swing before they are done) and they will learn to make room on the slide for those that were trained to only go down the slide (not up &lt;omg&gt;)<br/>

I just got off of the phone with my SIL and she said the same thing <br/>
about her DD&#39;s gymnastics teacher.  If one of the kids wants to do <br/>
something else that the other kids aren&#39;t doing, the teacher would <br/>
not make a big deal of it.  I am going to see if there is another <br/>
teacher or class that we can take.  If not, I AM NOT taking my DD <br/>
back there.  Period...and I&#39;m really not too worried about what my <br/>
DH&#39;s opinion is at this point.  That may sound harsh but, this is <br/>
our daughter&#39;s self-esteem that we are talking about and the mama <br/>
bear in me is coming out, with a vengeance.<br/>

Honestly, I don&#39;t think that he really understands it.  I have tried <br/>
to explain it to him and even left books for him to read about it.  <br/>
He is not around much (working 12 to 14 hour days, 6 days a week and <br/>
sometimes 7) and really leaves these types of things to me. He <br/>
simply says that he trusts me and believes that I will do what&#39;s <br/>
best for our DD.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It sounds like he felt embarrassed and foolish because she didn&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
You hit the nail on the head here.  He was embarrassed because she <br/>
was just sitting there and the other kids were doing what the <br/>
teacher wanted.  Where as I, on the other hand, could care less.  I <br/>
am not there to make friends with the teacher or the other parents.  <br/>
I am there because I thought that my DD would have a  good time.  He <br/>
said that he would stay home next week to see if she has a better <br/>
time without him, that I seemed to handle it better than him.  I <br/>
handle it better than him because I&#39;m not concerned with what others <br/>
think of me or my DD. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Have a tea party with all the stuffed animals&gt;&gt;<br/>

Sounds fun...I think we will do that tomorrow.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

doesn&#39;t want to?  If so, why?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The answer to this question was &quot;yes&quot; because she won&#39;t always get <br/>
her way the way she does at home.  Again, when I pointed out that <br/>
she dosen&#39;t always get her way at home and that there are lots of <br/>
times when she is unhappy with my authority, he said &quot;yeah, you&#39;re <br/>
right.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Boy can I relate, I so often feel the same way and find it hard to press my <br/>
point in situations such as you have described because the way it is set up is <br/>
not in my power to change and the resistance you meet is so hard to deal with. <br/>
I too have always had the kids who could not see the point in certain things <br/>
and then neither could I but knew that someone was going to have a problem <br/>
with that, LOL. I look forward to hearing others answers on this dilemma.<br/>
<br/>
Here is how I worked out one with a similar problem but much shorter term.<br/>
<br/>
My 16yro and I attended an airbrush body tattoo workshop this past fall which <br/>
lasted 2 days. After several hours he was quite bored with airbrushing <br/>
stencils on a tablet (and so was I, LOL). Everyone else seemed quite happy with it. <br/>
He started messing around painting what he wanted (on the paper) and I could <br/>
tell that the wife (it was a husband and wife team who taught this) was not <br/>
happy that he was not &quot;doing stencils&quot;. I don&#39;t know if he picked up on her <br/>
disapproval or not, he probably did but decided to ignore it. She also made several <br/>
comments to me, it was a great moment for me, it was one of the first times <br/>
in my life (my shift in thinking was already occurring by then) that I let her <br/>
talk and went on letting my son do what he wanted. I reasoned that he was <br/>
right, it was boring and he was not interested in doing stencils or tattoos, he <br/>
was not hurting anything or anyone and I had paid for the workshop, $175 each so <br/>
it was my dime. I wold just laugh when she said something, that was a good <br/>
day for us both. <br/>

like this in the past when one of us has uncomfortable feelings about <br/>
something but don&#39;t necessarily disagree that it should be done. I have asked him to <br/>
attend a few things which I knew would cause me to be too emotional and he <br/>
agreed and it worked out well. You could try it, I&#39;d love to hear how it goes. <br/>
You may find you give other parents the courage to express how they feel too. I <br/>
wonder how often we do things because they have always been done that way and <br/>
in reality no one likes it but everyone is afraid to say so.<br/>

don&#39;t stick with the class. An art class only has kids who enjoy art.<br/>
Putting any child into an art class won&#39;t make them enjoy art. They just get<br/>
bored and cause chaos.<br/>

One of the holes of that class is enjoying structure (or at least being<br/>
broken to conform to it.)<br/>

class last year but after a couple of classes they hated it and we never went <br/>
back.  That just isn&#39;t how they like to explore the world.  They like to look <br/>
at and read about what they are interested in.  <br/>
<br/>
My boys also are not interested in group, organized sports.  That is why I, <br/>
with another Mom, started what we call a &quot;free day&quot; we found a gym that has all <br/>
the gym equipment, basketballs, hockey, roller blades, and also has things <br/>
like pool, table hockey and board games, and we have made an arrangement to use <br/>
it once a week when it is not in use.  The kids can do whatever they want.  We <br/>
keep an eye out for safety but if they want to kick the basketball around or <br/>
shoot at the hoops without any of the &quot;basketball rules&quot; they can.  The kids <br/>
love it and have a great time.  They go from one thing to the next.<br/>
<br/>
Are there others in your area that are unschoolers or are just a little bit <br/>
less structured, your local homeschool group?  Maybe you could get together and <br/>
set up something a little less structured for the kids.  I know that if there <br/>
is a group, most gyms here will work something out to give classes and work <br/>
out a reasonable rate.  Our homeschool group did that working with a local gym, <br/>
to get their own classes set up during the day when most other kids are in <br/>
school.<br/>

Of course, there is much more to the arguement but I won&#39;t bore you <br/>
with an hour&#39;s worth of yelling.  I just feel that there are <br/>
important things to enforce and not important things and this just <br/>
isn&#39;t that important.  However, I can be very stubborn (which is <br/>
where my DD gets it from) and I sometimes think that my way is the <br/>
only way.  So, I would like to hear some other view points on this <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would check and see if there is an &quot;open&quot; gym time.  Where you pay a <br/>
certain fee and the children come in and have somewhat free run of the activities, <br/>
nothing is really structured, but there are coaches around to assist and <br/>
monitor.  Most gyms have this at least once a week.  It generally isn&#39;t advertised <br/>
with the classes because they would like the security of having paid clients in <br/>
classes each week.  The open gym is a pay as you come type thing.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t see &quot;making&quot; her do what the class does.  I also see the point of a <br/>
class being just what it is, a class and the teacher wanting some order with a <br/>
group of children.  It is probably pretty distracting to him and the other <br/>
children to have one that goes around doing things as she feels like it.  I&#39;m not <br/>
saying that&#39;s bad, just that in the scope of a structured class it&#39;s probably <br/>
not going to work.  Think about if your child was one of the ones who was <br/>
going through the routine in the same fashion as the coach and everyone else but <br/>
one child wanted to and did things in her own rhythm and in her own time and <br/>
some things not at all... pretty distracting I would think.<br/>
<br/>
Gymnastics are all about routines anyway.  Certain amounts of time doing this <br/>
thing or that.  I know at early ages you don&#39;t expect that but it&#39;s being <br/>
laid as a foundation.  A BIG reason great gymnastic facilities LOVE <br/>
homeschoolers.  Their parents don&#39;t object to sixty hours or more a week in the gym, doing <br/>
things the COACHES way.  I also have to add that the gymnasts trust their <br/>
coaches because they WANT to be there and do this.  Well, some might not like it <br/>
as much as their mothers do...<br/>
<br/>
Look for the open gym day/night, I think your daughter will love that.  Same <br/>
equipment same children but they can run from station to station as they <br/>
please, that will be great fun with minimal stress.  Oh, and warm ups ARE <br/>
important, not just some routine to begin with.  Stretches muscles and ligaments and <br/>
warms them up to avoid injuries when climbing, jumping and such.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-581620083">&lt;&lt;How does he feel about unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband is not always inclined to read a book or articles I leave for him.  Occasionally I&#39;ve read articles to him, while we are driving - in fact, when my girls happen to be in the car on these instances, I think it has helped them to hear the info as well.  I also send him snippets of emails from the lists that i am on that might address whatever concerns he expresses at the moment.  <br/>
<br/>
As my husband is with kids to the same degree that i am - he doesn&#39;t always know all that goes on.  It&#39;s been important for me to share with him on a daily basis what we did in our day.  Sometimes this does translate into a list of &quot;what was learned&quot; today...or rather &quot;what was discussed&quot; today or what I witnessed today that displays that they are &quot;learning.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It sounds like he felt embarrassed and foolish because she didn&#39;t <br/>
do what the other kids were doing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My husband has felt it to be very helpful to be with other homeschooling families.  He can discuss his feelings with other dads and know that he is not alone.  He can see the kids in the group and appreciate what this is all about - and the individuality that is cherished in the group.  And as he sees his friends schooled kids grow into teenagers vs the hs teenagers he can really really appreciate the differences.<br/>

really appreciate the differences. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That helped my husband more than anything else--seeing other people&#39;s <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was five, six and seven, sometimes my husband would say things to <br/>
indicate he suspected Kirby to be behind others, or more babyish than others, <br/>
or less sociable, etc.   I asked my husband SEVERAL times how many other kids <br/>
Kirby&#39;s age he had been around lately.  None.  And I asked him a few times if <br/>
he remembered how it felt to be that age.  He didn&#39;t.  I do.   My husband <br/>
doesn&#39;t remember what he ever got for Christmas or a birthday when he was little.  <br/>
He barely remembers anything of day to day life.  His vivid childhood <br/>
memories have to do with being injured (broken bones) and lost (at the world&#39;s fair <br/>
in Seattle, and then in a hospital in another state, not knowing where or who <br/>
his relatives were other than &quot;Uncle Ed&quot; and his cousin&#39;s name).  <br/>
<br/>
So I gradually managed to get more kids into our home, and to get my husband <br/>
out to where more kids (schooled or not) were, and it helped immensely for him <br/>
to have a basis for comparison.<br/>
<br/>
Now that our kids are all in the double digits, we hear &quot;oh how mature!&quot;   <br/>
And it&#39;s not that they&#39;re &quot;mature,&quot; it&#39;s just that they&#39;re real and whole.  They <br/>
can also be &quot;immature&quot; in that they can play with toys and be happy hanging <br/>
around with younger kids.  There is a kind of false maturity (posturing, <br/>
sighing, professing to hate younger kids&#39; things) which my kids never learned.  <br/>
There is a kid of real maturity (involving NOT sighing, posturing, pretending) <br/>
which kids at school can hardly grow into due to their surroundings.<br/>
