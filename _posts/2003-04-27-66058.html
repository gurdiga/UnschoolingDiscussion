Believe me I&#39;ve heard plenty of that, but the biggest problem here is <br/>
being so far from family.  Hubby and I grew up in Burlington, MA and <br/>
all his family is still there.  My family is pretty spread out and <br/>
mobile, so we thought it would be great to live near family we know <br/>
won&#39;t leave as soon as we get there.  We really need a support system <br/>
because Ryan has autism and I want to surround ourselves with people <br/>
who would love to help out in a pinch.  Also, the kids really want to <br/>
live in the snow!  They both were born in CA and haven&#39;t seen the <br/>
snow too much.  It&#39;s a good opportunity to get to know the cousins <br/>
and grandparents better.  There have been other reasons for us to <br/>
move, but that&#39;s the main one.  Besides, I really miss the Fall.  <br/>
Last fall I was in a funk for about 3 months wishing for some kind of <br/>
weather change. <br/>
<br/>
Hope we can meet some more unschoolers when we finally get to MA.<br/>
