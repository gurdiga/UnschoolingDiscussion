&lt;&lt; Maybe you could try reserving &quot;they teach themselves&quot; for times when they <br/>
purposely set out to systematically learn something. I bought a book and <br/>
purposely learned guitar chords - you could say I taught myself guitar.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would say you learned to play guitar on your own.<br/>
You used resources in a systematic way, perhaps, and maybe you even tracked <br/>
our progress, or had a deadline to meet, but teaching yourself still seems to <br/>
me rooted in the teacher/student thing.<br/>
<br/>
I found something this morning that I wrote a while back, while looking for <br/>
some unschooling quotes.  It might have been on this list in the first place, <br/>
and so for anyone who&#39;s seen it already, apologies for the re-run.<br/>
----------------<br/>
<br/>
-=-So if teaching *really* means competently and compassionately facilitating <br/>
learning, then <br/>
teaching *does* exist, no? -=-<br/>
<br/>
The word exists.<br/>
The idea exists.<br/>
<br/>
In English we expect words to have meanings.  We expect a thing to be a <br/>
THING.  And a verb to be ACTION!  Wham! Pow!<br/>
<br/>
The action of &quot;teaching&quot; isn&#39;t simple and clear.  <br/>
<br/>
When there are pairs of words like &quot;pitcher and cup&quot; or &quot;pitcher and catcher&quot; <br/>
or &quot;ball and socket&quot; we assume the two things are complementary parts of a <br/>
whole.<br/>
<br/>
So we have (and have had for many languages back up the line, I&#39;m guessing, <br/>
maybe) &quot;teacher and student.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now that I&#39;m thinking about it, though, maybe this is, in part, an English <br/>
language problem.  Because in Romance languages (Latin-based, Italian, <br/>
French, Spanish...) they use &quot;maestro&quot; or forms thereof.  &quot;Master&quot; or <br/>
&quot;Mistress&quot; of an art or body of knowledge.  Someone can be a maestro with no <br/>
followers or students.  One can&#39;t very well be a teacher without the presence <br/>
of a student.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, we do have in modern English the pair &quot;teach and learn.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
If I want to teach someone how to use quotation marks, I can talk, show them, <br/>
make jokes, draw stick figures with speech-balloons, and I could maybe sing <br/>
songs about it.  So IF the person who&#39;s in the room &quot;being taught&quot; is <br/>
thinking about how to file down that one piece of a machine gun that can turn <br/>
a legal semi-automatic into an illegal automatic, and how to hide that part <br/>
really well, disguised as something altogether different, what am I doing?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m talking, writing, drawing, dancing and singing.  But I&#39;m not teaching.  <br/>
I&#39;m reviewing for myself something I already know.  I&#39;m just performing a <br/>
play of sorts, without an audience.  I&#39;m playing with myself.  I&#39;m...  Well, <br/>
you know.<br/>
<br/>
So if I&#39;m reading a magazine about machine guns and someone comes and says <br/>
&quot;How do I punctuate a quote within a quote?&quot;  I can show them.  If they don&#39;t <br/>
totally understand, I can draw pictures or give other examples.  When I <br/>
perceive that they have learned the thing they wanted to learn, I should s<br/>
hush up and go back to my magazine, because the action is completed.<br/>
<br/>
They learned.  I helped them learn.  <br/>
I was &quot;the teacher&quot; but I didn&#39;t do the work which resulted in learning.  The <br/>
learner did that in his head.  I wasn&#39;t in his head.  I could put ideas in <br/>
the air, but only he could hear and process and ask more questions.  Without <br/>
his active work, no teaching can possibly take place.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So if teaching *really* means competently and compassionately facilitating <br/>
learning, then <br/>
teaching *does* exist, no? -=-<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s that Buddhist talk about being the water, being the ocean.  Think of <br/>
it as kneading bread, maybe.  Here&#39;s a truth:  teaching has no action to show <br/>
for itself which is &quot;teaching.&quot;  You can&#39;t really pour useful information <br/>
into anyone else&#39;s ears or eyes against their will.  They can learn like <br/>
crazy, but you can&#39;t make them learn.<br/>
<br/>
Fold and push.  People learn from other people.<br/>
<br/>
Fold and push.  There are people paid to teach.  Some are aware that there <br/>
are limitations to what they can do.  Others are not philosophical and <br/>
believe that if they &quot;taught&quot; (presented information) only the lazy and <br/>
uncooperative could possibly fail to &quot;learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Fold and lean and push really hard.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Teaching&quot; is an idea which most people understand on a quick, simple level.  <br/>
It&#39;s an idea that the best teachers and the best homeschoolers (i.e. we <br/>
unschoolers) think about more carefully and examine more closely.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that I&#39;ve taught my kids to be kind and patient.  If they reject that <br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; though, they&#39;re not taught at all.  I would have modelled and <br/>
discussed and totally failed miserably to teach.  But somehow I persuaded <br/>
them to believe that what I believed was important.  Sometimes, somehow, I <br/>
persuade people to believe unschooling will work and is important.  Some <br/>
people fail to learn it but I keep singing and dancing anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t much like jazz, but philosophy, ideas and teaching are kind of like <br/>
jazz.  Early in playing an instrument you&#39;re told the One Right Way to hold <br/>
it, to blow/strike/pluck, to use the keys so you don&#39;t damage them, to stand <br/>
or sit just so,  making it easier for you and safer for the instrument.  <br/>
Those are The Rules.<br/>
<br/>
If you get so good at your instrument that you can play it in the dark, <br/>
quickly, while carrying on a conversation with someone else at the same time <br/>
(not wind instrument players, but you know what I mean...) then the rules no <br/>
longer apply to you.   At that point you cannot be a beginner who accidently <br/>
broke an instrument out of ignorance or carelessness.  You will love that <br/>
instrument and know it really well, and maybe be able to repair it.  At first <br/>
the instrument was the sacred goal, but once your musicianship is greater <br/>
than the instrument, you are beyond and above the simple rules.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a rule:  You have to stand to sing.  Otherwise your diaphragm is <br/>
cramped up and you won&#39;t be able to support your notes and control your <br/>
pitches.  HAVE to stand up.<br/>
<br/>
Professionals in musicals and operas--they can sing sitting, they sing lying <br/>
in beds, they sing while they&#39;re dancing, they sing in all kinds of <br/>
positions.  Folksingers and traditional musicians of various kinds sing <br/>
sitting in various situations.<br/>
<br/>
I can teach like they can sing.  So why am I saying teaching doesn&#39;t exist?  <br/>
Beginners need to stand up to sing.  Beginning teachers need to know that <br/>
teaching isn&#39;t a thing you do to someone else.  Rather, learning is something <br/>
that you MIGHT, if you&#39;re lucky, get to assist with.  <br/>
<br/>
In beginning stages, like student teachers and beginning homeschooling <br/>
parents and assistant karate teachers (which my son is) and games teachers <br/>
(Marty and Holly have both &quot;taught a game&quot; in the past couple of days, or <br/>
rather recited rules in the presence of other people) need to look for and <br/>
see learning as a separate process from their own song and dance. In advanced <br/>
stages there is teaching, but it is compassionately and competently <br/>
facilitating another&#39;s learning.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ve just written my next HEM column.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132113885">I&#39;m being the devil&#39;s advocate here.<br/>
<br/>
In this debate over who has power over knowledge there is still one <br/>
fundamental truth: teach and learn are just words. Now, I have never <br/>
heard of  a *maestro* without students (to be a master, one is an <br/>
*experto*) but the bottom line is that during our lifetime we will <br/>
learn either by ourselves or with a teacher. Yes, it is learning but <br/>
you can learn by having a teacher teach ---and that is not <br/>
necessarily a bad thing. In music, in martial arts, in yoga, we all <br/>
need teachers. There will be a moment when we wont need them anymore <br/>
(and we would still not be experts) but still, the experience with <br/>
the teacher will not diminish our learning experience.<br/>
<br/>
What I find interesting is the power aura these words have. <br/>
Unschooling, as a life style for some, seems to be about loosing the <br/>
power grip of a word like &#39;teach&#39;. That&#39;s were the &#39;competently and <br/>
compassionate&#39; comes into play. Just like in yoga.<br/>
<br/>
Still, all this discussion points to the fact that &#39;learning&#39;, <br/>
&#39;teaching&#39;, &#39;education&#39;, no matter how you cut it, are all about <br/>
power.<br/>

action.<br/>

I don&#39;t know if there is any such thing as &quot;just words.&quot;<br/>

With money there&#39;s a bottom line.<br/>
With philosophy, there&#39;s just one more layer to consider. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People learn either in school or without.  <br/>
Since we&#39;re talking about &quot;without,&quot; we might as well go one more layer.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not a bad thing. In fact a *pervasive* thing. The message that we need<br/>
teachers to learn can&#39;t be escaped from except by growing up alone in a cave<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
Going to a class because we need a teacher to teach us is a different<br/>
mindset than going because we&#39;re choosing to learn from a teacher. A karate<br/>
teacher is just a vigorous guy in a white uniform unless someone decides<br/>
they want to use him as a tool to learn karate.<br/>
<br/>
The exercise is about helping people realize that the beginning point in<br/>
learning is what is inside reaching out rather than what&#39;s outside trying to<br/>
get in. When learning something, a person reaches out for whatever tools he<br/>
thinks will help. It might be a book, online help, a webpage, a friend, a<br/>
mother, a child, an expert, an email list, a video, a trip to a museum, or a<br/>
teacher. It&#39;s trying to help people who are stuck see that a live person who<br/>
imparts some knowledge is just another tool for a learner. It&#39;s not<br/>
downplaying teachers. It&#39;s bringing the desire inside the learner to center<br/>
stage where it belongs in the process of learning.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter may ask me how to do something on the computer rather than going<br/>
to the Help file (or any other of a slew of choices). I&#39;m a tool to her in<br/>
that instance. She&#39;s guessing that I&#39;m the most efficient tool for her<br/>
purpose. (Or maybe she just misses me ;-) I&#39;m not missing the fact that a<br/>
teacher is different than a book. A teacher can tailor an answer to the<br/>
questioner and a number of other advantages. But online help can often get<br/>
quickly to the problem with skillfully worded searches. That&#39;s the nature of<br/>
tools. There are advantages and disadvantages, features one has that the<br/>
other doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
That we can learn from teachers isn&#39;t a new idea to anyone. But that a<br/>
teacher is just one of many tools for learning like books and other<br/>
resources often is a totally new perspective, and enlightening one, for some<br/>
people.<br/>

<br/>
Really well put.<br/>
<br/>
And some people only have one tool in their toolbox, which is &quot;take a class.&quot;<br/>
They equate learning something with &quot;being taught.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So when someone wants to unschool but insists on using &quot;teach&quot; as a prominent <br/>
bit of their terminology, it can help for them to take that tool right out of <br/>
the toolbox for a while until they develop and learn to use a dozen other <br/>
tools, all called &quot;learn.&quot;<br/>
