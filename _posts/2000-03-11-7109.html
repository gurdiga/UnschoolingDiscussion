Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Rhonda Barfield and I&#39;m an author (some of you may have heard of<br/>
my books,15-Minute Cooking and Eat Healthy for $50 a Week) and homeschooling<br/>
mother of four. I need your help.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m writing a book on lifestyles of homeschooling families, and I&#39;m looking<br/>
for a wide variety of parents who are of all races, religions, and homeschool<br/>
philosophies, as well as from many different regions of the U.S. I am<br/>
purposely avoiding well-known homeschoolers, preferring to write about<br/>
everyday people. High on my priority list are homeschoolers who are Hispanic<br/>
and/or immigrants, fathers who homeschool, observant Jews, people of other<br/>
religions, people who live in a large city like New York, and unschoolers, as<br/>
I have plenty of contacts for WASP families. Would some of you be interested<br/>
in being included as one of the &lt;&lt;stories&gt;&gt; in my book?<br/>
<br/>
Your part would involve answering about 50 questions, either by phone or<br/>
e-mail, about how homeschool works in your family. I will take the answers<br/>
and write them up as a story. Then you get a rough draft, to make sure of<br/>
accuracy and your approval or suggestions for change. I finalize, send you a<br/>
second draft, you approve and that&#39;s that. I would include the first and last<br/>
names of each member of your family, but no city, only a state. You may be<br/>
asked to provide some photos.<br/>
<br/>
The book will be published by Kensington Publishing in New York and<br/>
distributed nationally. I&#39;m negotiating with my publisher so that every<br/>
participating family will receive at least a couple of free copies of the<br/>
book, tentatively called &lt;&lt;Real-Life Homeschooling: The Stories of 25<br/>
Families Who Teach Their Children at Home.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if any of you are interested in being part of this book.<br/>
Thank you in advance!<br/>
<br/>
