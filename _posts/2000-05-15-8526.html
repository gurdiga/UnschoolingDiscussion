<div><font size="2">Well, this is it. I am down to 7 days and counting. My home is 
torn up and packed down (and pushed into boxes, LOL) The necessities are still 
out, refrigerator, stove, computer, stereo, husband, children, pets...:) I am 
officially no mail/ web until the move is complete. I will check in on the 
egroups site, to keep current. I hope that everyone has a great May, and partial 
June. You can reach me via private email over the next few weeks, I will still 
be checking the mail. I just will not have very much time. Sorry about the 
crossposting:)</font></div>
