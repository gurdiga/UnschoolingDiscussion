<div id="ygrps-yiv-920855983"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I am considering having a &quot;morning time&quot; and having the kids each pick out <br/>
&gt;&gt;a new workbook of their choice to do for part of that time and then <br/>
&gt;&gt;playing a Family Math Game,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A lot of our mornings are spent playing math games too, only they didn&#39;t <br/>
come from a curriculum store, and they don&#39;t have the word &quot;math&quot; anywhere <br/>
on them. We play games like Monopoly, Clue, Trouble, Sorry, Milles Bornes, <br/>
Checkers, Chinese Checkers, Chess, Life, Stratego, Guess Who?, etc. We play <br/>
them because they&#39;re fun. We play in the morning because that&#39;s when it <br/>
seems to happen. (In the evening too so Dad can play.) In amongst all the <br/>
fun we&#39;re all using math skills like adding, subtracting, multiplying, <br/>
dividing, money skills, estimating, deductive reasoning, etc. It all counts.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I really am excited about becoming more relaxed!  : )&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m excited for you! Relaxing is way underrated IMO. :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114276385">Again, for a nonunschooling homeschooler &lt;G&gt; -- an alternative to <br/>
workbooks/textbooks is playing games instead -- I don&#39;t call it unschooling <br/>
if the PARENT is deciding what games to play and when - for specific learning <br/>
purposes - but I still think it is a STEP on the way toward unschooling - for <br/>
the parent to begin to understand how learning can take place without direct <br/>
teaching or traditional school-type materials.<br/>

This website is SELLING something - and it isn&#39;t that I&#39;m promoting one <br/>
particular seller - but I think it is interesting because Martin and Carolyn <br/>
Forte go around giving workshops on a &quot;Games Curriculum&quot; -- and I think it <br/>
might help someone to feel that this is truly a legitimate realistic way for <br/>
kids to learn.<br/>
<br/>
IF someone needs babysteps or hasn&#39;t got the courage or desire to go all the <br/>
way over to unschooling - this might be a good option.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014309175">.&gt;&gt;&gt; We play games like Monopoly, &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Since unschooling began in our house, I think we have played Monopoly almost<br/>
every day!  My kids never seem to tire of it.  I feel so fortunate to have<br/>
discovered this way of life.  We are having so much fun as a family.<br/>
