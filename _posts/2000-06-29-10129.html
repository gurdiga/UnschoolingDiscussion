Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Can you suggest some books?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello!   I am new to the list, and I would like to learn as much about<br/>
&gt; homeschooling and unschooling as possible.  Can you recommend some books<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; start me on my journey?  I would like to focus on those books which are<br/>
&gt; practical rather than theoretical, and those which are secular in nature.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; am reading &quot;Family Matters&quot; right now and find it far too general -- I<br/>
need<br/>
&gt; something with the specifics and mechanics of how<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling<br/>
&gt; work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One book I would like an opinion on is &quot;Homeschooling: The Early Years&quot; by<br/>
&gt; Linda Dobson.  I would also like to know which of these is more useful --<br/>
&gt; &quot;The Homeschooling Handbook&quot; or &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; by Mary<br/>
Griffith.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FINALLY, I would love to know how unschoolers feel about following a loose<br/>
&gt; curriculum for math and reading, but unschooling for &quot;everything else.&quot;<br/>
If<br/>
&gt; the child and parent feel comfortable with this arrangement, is it a good<br/>
one?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks so much -- I look forward to reading this list!<br/>
&gt; Susan<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Susan --<br/>
<br/>
Welcome!!!  I&#39;d recommend &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; more for &quot;handholding<br/>
purposes than anything else.  I&#39;d recommend Nancy Wallace&#39;s &quot;Child&#39;s Work: Taking<br/>
Children&#39;s Choices Seriously&quot; and my own (below) if you want a chronicle of how<br/>
unschooling approaches can work (with lots of examples), as well as John Holt&#39;s<br/>
books (Holt, by the way, used the terms &quot;homeschooling&quot; and &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>
interchangeably -- it was only later, in the 1980s when large numbers of<br/>
fundamentalists found their small church schools closed because of tax laws, that<br/>
the idea of school-at-home became popular, and hence the distinction between the<br/>
two terms.)<br/>
<br/>
But actually, these days, for people seriously into unschooling, I&#39;d recommend<br/>
several books which are not about homeschooling at all, but about the learning<br/>
process and children&#39;s potential.  The two which immediately come to mind are<br/>
&quot;Flow&quot; by Mihaly Czikschentmihaly (I think I spelled that correctly), and Joseph<br/>
Chilton Pearce&#39;s &quot;Magical Child&quot;.  By definition (at least I think), unschooling<br/>
DOESN&#39;T HAVE nuts and bolts -- it is an approach to thinking about children, their<br/>
way of being, and their learning capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; the child and parent feel comfortable with this arrangement, is it a good one?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My older one is almost totally self-directed -- we help her think about how, over<br/>
a period of months or years she can get herself where her learning desires impel<br/>
her -- and contract with her to try various approaches (and for us to provide<br/>
various supports in the process.)  My younger one is a self-directed and very<br/>
talented gymnast and musician (a phenomenal pianist and flutist) -- we don&#39;t have<br/>
to do anything in those areas.  We do ask her to do about an hour or so a day of<br/>
the usual reading, writing, arithmetic stuff -- frankly, I think it is more for<br/>
our benefit (my wife and I haven&#39;t finished deschooling) -- she reads, writes, and<br/>
does arithmetic perfectly well for a nine-year-old, I guess (whatever that means),<br/>
and whether requiring her to do this hour a day has any impact on her future<br/>
capabilities, I don&#39;t know (but I have grave doubts.)  She has already proven she<br/>
knows how to learn when she wants to do so, so what&#39;s the point?  The Sudbury<br/>
Valley Schools have proven, over a 30-year period and with hundreds of kids, that<br/>
the total sum of mathematics learning in the usual k-12 school can be taught, all<br/>
of it, in 8 weeks, when the child is ready and contracts to do so.  The evidence<br/>
is there, we just have to become more comfortable working with it.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the list!<br/>
