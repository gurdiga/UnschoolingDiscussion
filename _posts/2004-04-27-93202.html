<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764311435">This is very cool. James did his design for the lights last night. They sent<br/>
back the website showing his design in action.<br/>
<br/>
From the Website:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Vectorial Elevation is an interactive artwork that allows participants to<br/>
transform the sky over Dublin, Ireland. Using a three-dimensional interface,<br/>
this web site lets you design huge light sculptures with 22 robotic<br/>
searchlights located on and around Oï¿½Connell Street. A web page is made for<br/>
each participant with photos of their design from four cameras located<br/>
around the city. The piece will be live from April 22 to May 3, 2004 to<br/>
celebrate the HYPERLINK &quot;http://www.eu2004.ie/&quot;expansion of the European<br/>
Union. Check out this HYPERLINK &quot;http://www4.alzado.net/dublinvid.html&quot;video<br/>
to see what the project looks like in Dublin.<br/>
