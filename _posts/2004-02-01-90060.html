&lt;&lt; I love thelooks of the harvest moon game. I tried to talk Joey into <br/>
<br/>
getting it but if it doesn&#39;t have a gun he doesn&#39;t like it  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The first time Marty talked to me about Harvest Moon I was surprised that <br/>
kids would be excited about a game where you have to remember to water the corn <br/>
and feed the chickens.   But he and his loudest most violent friend were way <br/>
into it and still talk about it years later.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a fair amount of reading, some of which can be bypassed, and which is <br/>
repetitive and simple, so it really helped both Marty and then Holly in turn <br/>
to really need and use reading.  Holly is right this moment playing a spring <br/>
season on the Super Nintendo version, humming along with the music.  Her <br/>
character has gotten the second house expansion and has a pregnant wife.   Good <br/>
going! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
