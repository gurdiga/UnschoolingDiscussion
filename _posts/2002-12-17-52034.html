&lt;&lt; When was 5&#39;10&quot; 135 pounds ever fat? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes! Your Mil is phsycho!! I weigh 135 lbs. at 5&#39;8&quot; and have never been told <br/>
I look overweight in the least. It isn&#39;t healthy to be super thin. Your <br/>
organs don&#39;t have enough fat cushion between them!!  I don&#39;t see how a 5&#39;10&quot; <br/>
person could be healthy at much under 135...yikes!<br/>
