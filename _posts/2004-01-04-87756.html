<div id="ygrps-yiv-595032844">For the woman who wants to learn to drop-spindle and has sheep farmers <br/>
nearby...<br/>
<br/>
Go talk to the sheep farmers.<br/>
A lot of times, they&#39;ll have a fleece or two on their hands and will be <br/>
willing to sell it for cheap.  If it&#39;s a black-faced sheep (usually raised <br/>
for meat), you can usually get it for really cheap.  ...and I mean, Really <br/>
cheap.  4-H is a good source too.  You won&#39;t get the nicest quality wool by <br/>
any means, but it&#39;s great to learn on and the price is certainly right.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to invest in a spindle, find yourself a potato spear it <br/>
through the middle with a pencil or big crochet hook and twist away!  If <br/>
you get your thread thin and consistent, then you can make something fine <br/>
from it.  If your thread is slubby, then you make something big and chunky <br/>
and warm.  Remember once you&#39;re done spinning, loop it about your hands, <br/>
tie it off (into a big loop), get it all wet then let it dry under some <br/>
tension.   I don&#39;t know why that sets the twist, but it seems to and quite <br/>
nicely.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry if you do it wrong.  The sheep won&#39;t care and neither will we.<br/>
Twist away!<br/>
