&lt;&lt; Stephanie I have followed this thread and know you want it <br/>
 closed, but to me I feel your husband&#39;s attempt to control a natural <br/>
 function of YOUR body is the tip of the iceberg in his controlling <br/>
 behaviour, it is an abuse to both you and your child.   I would be <br/>
 concerned about what this childish behaviour of his is a precursor <br/>
 to, I seriously think he needs counselling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Stephanie,<br/>
I have emailed you privately about the above.  <br/>
