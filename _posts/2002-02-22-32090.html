<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582675624">UGH!  I&#39;m having so many problems at these Yahoo sites!  My <br/>
last post didn&#39;t take, so let&#39;s try it again!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
JOYLYN: thank you for the nursing clothes/ slings site.  <br/>
I&#39;m 6 mos. pg <br/>
with #2.<br/>
<br/>
JOYCE: Thanks for pointing me to the message boards.  <br/>
Sometimes I find <br/>
it tedious to point and click back and forth on these <br/>
types of pages, <br/>
but it IS very informative.  Thank you for reminding me <br/>
those are there. <br/>
<br/>
INTRODUCTION: My cyber-nick is TATE, and I live in <br/>
Northern IN (almost <br/>
to MICH) with my DH of 4.5 years and our 2.5 year old <br/>
boy, &quot;Z.&quot;  I <br/>
frequent another mommy-board where there are several <br/>
homeschoolers, and <br/>
have gotten to know more and more about this phenomenon <br/>
(both un- and <br/>
curriculum users...).  It is really starting to interest <br/>
me as of late, <br/>
even though my child is 4.5 years away from mandatory <br/>
schooling.  Kindy <br/>
is not mandatory in IND.  He would be nearly 7 (b-day is <br/>
9-22) when he <br/>
would start a traditional 1st grade class.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I can or will homeschool.  And then I <br/>
don&#39;t know if I <br/>
will &quot;un-school&quot; or choose a curriculum.  I&#39;m just <br/>
starting to check it <br/>
all out now.  So please allow me to lurk a while and <br/>
learn all I can <br/>
from those who have btdt (or are there doing it!!).<br/>
<br/>
In my life BC, I taught high school English for 4 years <br/>
in Indianapolis.  <br/>
That is where I first learned a disdain for the public <br/>
school system.  <br/>
My DH seems open to the idea of H-schooling, but my mom <br/>
and other family <br/>
members seem closed-minded.  So that is something I will <br/>
have to think <br/>
about when/ if I decide to do this.  I know I shouldn&#39;t <br/>
care what others <br/>
think, but it&#39;s hard!!<br/>
<br/>
I guess that&#39;s enough about me.  Back into lurk-mode.<br/>
