<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189863510">Usually I pick out an anecdote about what ours is up to and just<br/>
lead the conversation through the joys of printmaking or whatever<br/>
fairly interesting thing might be closely enough related to be<br/>
serviceable.<br/>
<br/>
If the person asking has a legitimate reason to know, then I<br/>
don&#39;t mind answering very specifically.  If it is general &quot;make<br/>
nice noise&quot; they are happy to have any answer; a fun one is very<br/>
welcome. If it is rudely intended, veiled criticism, I find it<br/>
better for my peace of mind to divert it rather than try to<br/>
correct the failings their own mother made in teaching them good<br/>
manners - some what the same way I treat toddlers who are veering<br/>
towards disaster right up until I exclaim &quot;Hey, look at this<br/>
bug!&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My ds is 7. He loves to draw and write stories, but is just now beginning to <br/>
recognize all the letters. He will still use his fingers to form the letter <br/>
and ask &quot;Is this a U?&quot;, etc. when he&#39;s writing. Imagine the looks I get when <br/>
he does that in front of someone (he carries pen and paper everywhere!).<br/>
<br/>
When people I don&#39;t know ask, I say we homeschool and we&#39;re focusing more on <br/>
his creative abilities right now. He&#39;ll get reading easily when we start on <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
When my family and friends ask (which is becoming less and less), I tell them <br/>
he will learn when he is ready. Kids in school are being made to address <br/>
reading at an early age because the teachers have no other way of teaching <br/>
them the other material. We believe Alex learns best in tiny bits over long <br/>
periods of time. And I usually add that no one will care when he is grown at <br/>
which age he learned. If he hasn&#39;t learned it by the time he is grown, then <br/>
you (whoever) can say &quot;I told you so&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486426830">Sorcha, I lifted that for the reading collection.<br/>
<br/>
There was a sweet thirteen year old boy when I was teaching remedial reading <br/>
long ago.  He SO wanted to learn to read, and would come at lunch and after <br/>
school, and nothing I knew to say was helping him (not that I knew much, and <br/>
not that there is much to know, if a kid just isn&#39;t ready).<br/>
<br/>
I was so sad.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I knew whether he learned, whether it clicked at some point.  I bet it <br/>
did.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve forgotten his name now, but I rememember his big hands and his freckles <br/>
and he had the dark red hair a few of the families in Northern New Mexico <br/>
have.<br/>
<br/>
My dad didn&#39;t read fluently.  He was a left forced to write right handed, and <br/>
had stories of mean teachers in a little school in Rotan, Texas, before he <br/>
dropped out and went to work in shipyards in San Francisco or Oakland, where <br/>
he learned to weld, and then he joined the army near the end of WWII (war <br/>
ended as he was on a transport ship on the way to France).  He tried going to <br/>
college later, but was entirely frustrated with trying to take whatever the <br/>
beginning writing was (101ish thing).  He didn&#39;t understand what the teacher <br/>
wanted.  I remember being little, six, and him saying &quot;What does it matter <br/>
whether I write &#39;old woman&#39; or &#39;old lady.&#39;?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I wish now I had whatever paper it was that was being criticized for woman or <br/>
lady.  I&#39;d love to see what he had been writing about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-131480074">Great story!  It&#39;s a help for parents whose children are learning to read later than the cultural norm.  I will send this to a friend whose 10 year old isn&#39;t reading yet.  I was just wondering, do you think he might have learned to read earlier if he had been unschooled?  Perhaps his bad school experiences contributed?  Just a thought,  Kristin<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am looking forward to the answers to this one as Jason has no desire to<br/>
write either! Or draw...he loves mazes but does them with his finger. I think<br/>
that it has something to do with not liking to make mistakes. He saw a little<br/>
girl writing and erasing in pencil and thought that it was pretty cool so we<br/>
have lots of pencils and erasers around :o) He does like to scribble with those.<br/>
<br/>
My dad has so far been the only one to give me a hard time about Jason not writing.<br/>
He thinks that Jason will not learn unless I make him practice every day. What I have<br/>
done is to become proactive (realizing that part of my dad&#39;s concern is that he does<br/>
not really know what we are doing...just what we are not doing). I send a monthly <br/>
email to my parents and in-laws detailing all the &quot;stuff&quot; that we are doing, books<br/>
we are reading, neat things that we are learning, connections that I have seen Jason<br/>
make. I also throw in some neat things that he has learned from computer games. :o)<br/>
I have gotten fewer comments from my dad about what Jason does not know since starting<br/>
this. Plus I find it kind of fun for myself too.<br/>
<br/>
As far as other people, I can usually talk enough about Jason&#39;s current interests and<br/>
just don&#39;t mention what he is not doing. I will have to admit that I had a couple of<br/>
pangs of self-consciousness when he signed his name on his basketball coach&#39;s thank<br/>
you card in front of one of the moms...he took his time and erased a couple of times.<br/>
But I realize that this is my problem and I also know that Jason tends to wait until<br/>
he is good and ready and then does things over night. It is the way that he is. I <br/>
have been giving it lots of thought and I think that what makes me self-conscious<br/>
is the idea that my dad or others would think that I was doing something wrong<br/>
or not doing something I should be doing. But there is no guarantee that in school<br/>
he would  be writing any better then he is now...in fact he might be learning to <br/>
hate writing. But the difference would be that it would not be my fault. So at least<br/>
I know that it is all about me. :o) I am not making Jason practice writing and I do<br/>
know that he will start when he is ready. Reading here is giving me more confidence<br/>
 and I think that will help me get over my problem. I also know from speaking to <br/>
lots of hsers that most 6 yo boys are not into writing. <br/>
<br/>
It also has helped me focus on what he does do...he has an incredible vocabulary. If<br/>
he hears a word he retains it and uses it correctly. He is very adept at explaining<br/>
and expressing himself (too much so sometimes!). My dad expressed a concern of Jason<br/>
not being able to communicate if he could not write...I was able to point out that<br/>
the act of writing is not where the communication happens...it is in the putting <br/>
together of thoughts and words which Jason has no problem doing. I also mentioned that<br/>
there is such a thing as typing. The really ironic thing is that my dad has probably<br/>
the world&#39;s worst handwriting! LOL!<br/>
