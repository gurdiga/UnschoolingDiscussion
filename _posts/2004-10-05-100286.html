<div id="ygrps-yiv-972767106">I was recently reading on one of the unschooling lists I am on about a<br/>
family&#39;s dream.  (Sorry if this is a cross post for some of you but I am so<br/>
excited I want to tell everyone!) The family didn&#39;t have a lot of money but<br/>
somehow, they found a way to help their children follow their dream of<br/>
having horses.  It was very inspiring.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I read accounts like that and think, yeah but, we couldn&#39;t do<br/>
that.  We can&#39;t afford it and I really don&#39;t know horses well enough.  Well,<br/>
I got to thinking about the road blocks and realized that it really is all a<br/>
matter of prioritizing and having faith. (Barbara Sher gets a little credit<br/>
here too.  I heard her speak at the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference.)<br/>
What are my priorities and can we find a way to make our girl&#39;s dreams come<br/>
true?    <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My girls have the same dream, to own a horse or pony. They will only be<br/>
little once and wouldn&#39;t it be awesome if we could attain their dream of<br/>
owning a horse while they are still at home?  (They  are 8 and 9.75)<br/>
They&#39;ve talked about it since they started riding two years ago.<br/>
Incessantly.  I talked with a neighbor the other day who has a horse and she<br/>
said she wanted one all her life and didn&#39;t get one until she was 60.  Would<br/>
my kids be 60 before they got their first horse?  Or could we find a way to<br/>
have one much sooner than that?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One part of the road block in horse ownership is my fear of all that can go<br/>
wrong with horses.   But boarding a horse somewhere at a barn where I trust<br/>
the owner&#39;s judgment takes care of part of that fear and I can get over the<br/>
rest.  Another part of the road block, I thought, would be my dh.  He grew<br/>
up on a farm with lots of mandatory chores and he sees animals pretty much<br/>
as only a chore. It is sad, but he gets very little pleasure from any<br/>
animals.  He also doesn&#39;t want us to be tied down so that we can&#39;t vacation<br/>
when we want to.  He does, however, realize just how much joy the girls get<br/>
from horses.   I have been saying for the last year though, that if we ever<br/>
got a horse, I would board it somewhere so we could still vacation easily<br/>
and ride all winter in an indoor ring. But boarding is expensive.  Another<br/>
road block.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this fall I got to thinking that we should sell our half of a small<br/>
camp we own because we don&#39;t use it and it&#39;s always costing us money in<br/>
repairs and taxes.  Dh&#39;s sister&#39;s family owns the other half so we would<br/>
need to either sell it to them or to another of dh&#39;s sibling.  Dh didn&#39;t<br/>
think anyone would want to buy us out, but we asked anyway.  His brother is<br/>
interested.  :0)    It won&#39;t give us a windfall, by any means, but it will<br/>
help us to pay off some loans and we would have a smaller monthly overhead.<br/>
I was just going to enjoy having fewer bills, but well, after reading about<br/>
that family, I got to thinking that if we paid off a loan or two with the<br/>
money, we would be able to afford board for a horse.  I spoke to the barn<br/>
owner and asked her if we shoveled stalls regularly, would she reduce the<br/>
board.  She agreed and we almost have the details worked out.  She will give<br/>
us a really good deal if we shovel stalls regularly. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we don&#39;t have the actual cash yet but we are excited.  It just so<br/>
happens that we heard about a pony that is for sale that sounds like it just<br/>
might fit the bill.  Of course, until we see it and ride it, we won&#39;t know<br/>
for sure.  I am waiting for a phone call so we can go see it.  I am so<br/>
excited.  This may not be THE pony and it may take some time to find just<br/>
the right horse or pony, but our dreams are on their way to becoming a<br/>
reality.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that exciting?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-59762783">that is so cool<br/>
<br/>
i have always wanted a horse too.<br/>
<br/>
the idea about shoveling out stalls to help reduce cost was great.<br/>
<br/>
my husband recently brought up the idea of owning a horse because he knows<br/>
that i have always wanted one.  my kids are still very young, but i know dh<br/>
is open to the idea and if/when we get ahead financially, we&#39;ll see...<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the inspiration<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-887625820">Does the stable also give riding lessons?  My friends boards their horse at<br/>
the stable where the daughter takes lessons and they get a reduced boarding<br/>
fee for letting the stable owners use the horse for other people&#39;s lessons.<br/>
It&#39;s really win-win since the horse gets more exercise and attention that<br/>
way.  Maybe you could do something similar?<br/>

 <br/>
Or leasing. I leased a sweet gelding from a girl who had left for college,  <br/>
couldn&#39;t take him with her, and wasn&#39;t ready to sell him yet. I kept him one  <br/>
year and paid for all his expenses: board, smithy, vet, etc. Basically, I got a <br/>
 free horse for a year, she didn&#39;t have to sell him, and he stayed fit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802633331">Thanks for the ideas everyone.  We know about leasing and it&#39;s an option we<br/>
might consider, although my girls don&#39;t part well with animals they love, so<br/>
it might have to be lease to buy. The idea of falling in love with a horse,<br/>
then sending him off at the end of the lease sounds painful.  Around here<br/>
there are a lot of winter leases and then the horse goes back to a riding<br/>
camp for the summer.  There are private leases that often last as long as<br/>
the lessee is interested.  If something like that fell into our lap, it<br/>
would be wonderful.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also, the stable we will board at does give lessons.  That&#39;s where my girls<br/>
take lessons. With two horse loving girls sharing one horse already, I think<br/>
that adding lessons onto it would be too much for the horse.  I suspect<br/>
they&#39;ll ride often and that is why we want to buy at this point, so they can<br/>
ride as often as they like.  Weekly lessons just aren&#39;t enough for their<br/>
tastes.  The pony we looked at yesterday isn&#39;t going to be the one.  There<br/>
are some unscrupulous people out there sometimes.  But we&#39;ll keep looking<br/>
and I know we&#39;ll find a good match one day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208600628">I know almost nothing about what it might cost to buy a horse or pony<br/>
these days, but at the local harvest festival the BLM had a booth with<br/>
information about adopting a wild horse or burro.  They apparently<br/>
capture a certain number each year to keep populations in check, and<br/>
have a process where the public can adopt them.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like min. fee of $125, avg. $185 for a horse, some requirements<br/>
and things.  No idea how much competition there is.  See<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355891858">The cost of the actual horse isn&#39;t the biggest expense.  The require regular<br/>
visits by a farrier for foot trimming and shoes (if they need them) and if<br/>
you end up with vet bills, they can grow quickly.  It&#39;s important to keep<br/>
that in mind and be able to pay if necessary.  Also, since we aren&#39;t keeping<br/>
it at our house, boarding can be expensive, anywhere from $230 a month on<br/>
up, around here.  Working at the barn makes it much more affordable though.<br/>
