 </span></blockquote>Hi Amy,<br/>
Seems like a long time ago now - about 9 years! - that my son&#39;s father, Ted,<br/>
decided to file for divorce. We&#39;d been living separately for over 4 years; my son<br/>
was 5. The two had seen each other for a total of about  - oh, I&#39;d say 8 to 12<br/>
hours in those four years. Ted wanted joint custody because he &quot;wasn&#39;t sure&quot;<br/>
about &quot;this homeschooling thing&quot;. He lived 300 miles away, and didn&#39;t want to<br/>
take over the parenting or anything, he just wanted to be able to make decisions<br/>
about how &quot;his son&quot; should live! He&#39;d pay for the divorce and everything, I<br/>
didn&#39;t have to worry about that. He&#39;d take care of it all as soon as he got back<br/>
from his trip to Hawaii. (Nice of him!) Well, as you can imagine, the next day I<br/>
went out and got myself a lawyer and filed for divorce on my terms. His case was<br/>
a lost cause from the start, and though the lawyers tried to screw us around and<br/>
make it take a lot longer than it should have, and I ended up with a lot less in<br/>
child support than I think I should have, I have sole custody of my son, and<br/>
we&#39;ve been homeschooling ever since.<br/>
<br/>
Ted never was able to handle the responsiblilty of fatherhood, and the 6 or 7<br/>
years of his life before my son finally divorced his dad were filled with lies<br/>
and broken promises on Ted&#39;s part, and heartbreak, anger, hatred, guilt, fear and<br/>
nightmares for my son. Finally, I don&#39;t remember if JL was 6 or 7, at midnight on<br/>
New Years Eve, we had a healing circle that included a &quot;funeral&quot; ceremony for the<br/>
father that JL never had, and a snuffing of his father&#39;s candle. This part was<br/>
JL&#39;s inclusion, and it turned out to be crucial to the ceremony. In fact it had<br/>
to be (rather gleefully) snuffed three times before it was really &quot;done&quot;. After<br/>
that the intensity went out of his feelings about his father, and they gradually<br/>
just faded away. Now, at 14, he has no particular feelings toward his father (not<br/>
conscious ones anyway), and there has been almost no contact for years (a 30<br/>
second birthday phone call 2 or 3 years ago).<br/>
<br/>
A legally simple situation; his demand for joint custody was laughable. I hope<br/>
all goes well in the situation you are thinking of.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi!  I am new to the list, my name is Amy, and I am the proud mom of one son.<br/>
&gt;  My ds is 7 1/2 yo, and we are unschoolers.  I also run an award winning<br/>
&gt; In-Home Daycare for children, lead a 4-H group, and have started a local<br/>
&gt; homeschooling support group.  Of course, I could not do all of this without<br/>
&gt; the support of my wonderful hubby, he is the best.  My son is an Active/Alert<br/>
&gt; child, which is sort of a combination of traits from ADD, ADHD, and ODD.<br/>
&gt; These children are very bright, but will defy you to the ends of the earth.<br/>
&gt; Essentially their main problem is that they have hyper-sensitive sensory<br/>
&gt; perceptions, and therefore feel overwhelmed most of the time.  This in turn<br/>
&gt; creates a fearful child, who tries to control this fear by controlling<br/>
&gt; his/her environment (clear as mud?)  Anyway, I really look forward to<br/>
&gt; exchanging ideas and stories with all of you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do have one request:  If any of you have been involved in a custody issue<br/>
&gt; with an ex-spouse (that involved homeschooling), and if you don&#39;t mind<br/>
&gt; sharing your story with other homeschoolers, would you please email me<br/>
&gt; privately?  Thanks so much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Best wishes,<br/>
&gt; Amy Aponte </span></blockquote></div>
