The camp is advertised on page 46 of the July/August issue of HEM.  The<br/>
website is www.nbtsc.org.  We are looking into doing the September 4 -11 in<br/>
OR this year.<br/>

herd of it and I was interested in seeing what an Unschooling camp was all <br/>

looked it up...........nevermind.,<br/>
