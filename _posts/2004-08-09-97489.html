<br/>
One thing I love about Cincinnati is that the art museum isn&#39;t *that* far away. We went to it <br/>
yesterday for the afternoon. We&#39;ve been many, many times. It was especially apparent to <br/>
me yesterday. As we walked in the door, Liam exclaimed, &quot;I love that Chihuly chandelier.&quot; <br/>
Jacob added, &quot;I could look at it every day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We made our way into the Greek and Egyptian displays and Caitrin noticed that they had <br/>
rearranged them. She went on to point out which of the vases she liked best compared to <br/>
last time. Liam wanted to stop and look at each of the hieroglyphs again.<br/>
<br/>
We moved on and went into an exhibit that was put up by Proctor and Gamble - all <br/>
Cincinnati art. I honestly didn&#39;t recognize the exhibit but the kids did. They started <br/>
reminiscing about the pieces they had loved the last time we&#39;d been there. We marveled at <br/>
the quality of the artwork.<br/>
<br/>
Later we found an entire exhibit devoted to Frank Duveneck (Cincinnati native) and were <br/>
thrilled to see all his paintings together. That was new.<br/>
<br/>
We made our way upstairs to see the Monets that are on loan from Paris and were blown <br/>
away by the size and colors. Caitrin (7) immediately told me the story of why this <br/>
particular &quot;Bridge at Giverny&quot; was so hard to see close-up - &quot;because Monet lost his <br/>
eyesight as he got older and he would make paintings that were less and less realistic as a <br/>
result.&quot; She pointed out how much the bridge showed up if we were at the back of the <br/>
room compared to up close when we could see each swirl of the brush.<br/>
<br/>
Liam (10) reminded me of the &quot;Linnea in Monet&#39;s Garden&quot; book we had read and Jacob <br/>
remembered the movie.<br/>
<br/>
We were amazed that the Cathedral at Rouen was so dull close up and so vibrant at a <br/>
distance. You could see the source of light behind it and it glowed from across the room.<br/>
<br/>
We walked into the modern art exhibit and all agreed again that we don&#39;t like modern art, <br/>
except that I really like Mark Rothko. Rothko asserts that he isn&#39;t interested in form, line or <br/>
color but in creating emotions. He says that he knows he communicates because when <br/>
people look at his work, many report that they cry. Jacob (10), who couldn&#39;t remember <br/>
who Rothko was when I spoke of him last week, was eager to see our Cincinnati Rothko. <br/>
He didn&#39;t cry. He didn&#39;t understand why anyone would. I didn&#39;t cry either, but I did feel this <br/>
weird surge in my chest.<br/>
<br/>
Liam wanted to see a real Van Gogh so I took them to the only one in the museum. He <br/>
remembered it then and commented that, &quot;that guy must really have liked paint. I like his <br/>
blue.&quot; Caitrin added, &quot;He uses globs of it. It&#39;s nice to see the real painting so we can see <br/>
the globs up close.&quot; We wished for a Van Gogh exhibit to come to Cincinnati.<br/>
<br/>
Our favorite rooms were closed for renovation. We were sad. So we went to other rooms <br/>
we frequent less and noticed all the Italians. Jacob asked, &quot;Will some of these painters be <br/>
in Italy when we go next summer?&quot; We discussed the benefits of great art being dispersed <br/>
throughout the world rather than collected all in one town. We talked about why the <br/>
Italians artwork was so much more dramatic than the British in the room next door. We <br/>
shuddered in front of a boyish, rosy-cheeked David holding the recently severed head of a <br/>
bloody Goliath.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up in front of a painting that showed a woman deranged with a pale face, <br/>
flowers dripping down her white gown, restrained by a man in a renaissance costume. <br/>
They stood before a queen in anguish and a king with his face in his hands. Jacob called <br/>
out, &quot;Mom, this is from Hamlet! That&#39;s Ophelia.&quot; And it was. The man was Laertes, her <br/>
brother. Apparently this artist had wanted to make a series of Shakespeare paintings to <br/>
display together in England, but the project failed and the pieces he painted have been <br/>
bought up by a variety of art connoisseurs. This painting is the first to have been <br/>
purchased for the Cincinnati Art Museum and its purchase preceded the museum&#39;s <br/>
construction by about five years.<br/>
<br/>
It was a great afternoon. And it was fun to see that repeated visits yielded so much in my <br/>
kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058975649">Julie, thanks for sharing this. I look forward to reading your individual<br/>
narratives.<br/>
<br/>
If you are ever visiting Houston, you might enjoy the Rothko Chapel. Usually<br/>
there is a Broken Obelisk sculpture outside in the fountain. Last time I was<br/>
there it was gone with an official sign posted: Broken Obelisk removed for<br/>
repair. It made me chuckle. <br/>
