Take it easy on yourself, we&#39;re just humans, raised in this often bizarro<br/>
culture.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that all those awards are for things that can be measured.  And<br/>
then remember all the things that can never be measured: love, loyalty,<br/>
kindness, friendship, honor.<br/>
<br/>
At her ten year reunion, you&#39;ll get a better picture of how they&#39;re all<br/>
really doing &lt;gg&gt;.<br/>

Maybe it&#39;s not such a selfish thing you wanted for your children after all.  <br/>
Maybe you really just want them to experience EVERYTHING, the accolades, the <br/>
awards, the recognition&#39;s, the praise, you know how great your children are <br/>
and you want the world to recognize that too.  That isn&#39;t so horrible for a <br/>
mother to want to happen for her children.<br/>
<br/>
Just might not be what they want.  I had children who received these &quot;big&quot; <br/>
sports awards, just last year I went to the &quot;big&quot; sports banquet and was <br/>
supposed to meet my baseball player son there.  Coach kept asking me where he <br/>
was, they couldn&#39;t start until he got there, they kept dragging things out.  <br/>
John never showed.  He was to receive the &quot;big&quot; award for the athlete of the <br/>
year or something to that effect, a really big honor anyway.  John knew, he <br/>
didn&#39;t want to be recognized.  He said he&#39;s a team player, without a team <br/>
behind him, he would have never won all the games he did.  So he skipped it.  <br/>
On one hand I find that extremely admirable but on the other it looked like <br/>
he was really an ungrateful brat that ruined the night for the coaches and <br/>
other players who wanted to recognize him.  So what did the coach do?  He <br/>
didn&#39;t give out the award that night AND he gave it to someone who really <br/>
wanted it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really a double edged sword of sorts.  Cait volunteers in the Community. <br/>
 She does any number of different things, from reading to preschoolers at a <br/>
daycare to helping with the duck race (a local fundraiser), doing clean up on <br/>
earth day, all kinds of stuff.  Just yesterday she got an invite to a <br/>
reception honoring the volunteers, she wants no part of it.  She said it&#39;s <br/>
kinda fake if you do it to get recognition.  I told her that they might think <br/>
she&#39;s just being rude if she doesn&#39;t show up.  She still doesn&#39;t want to go, <br/>
so she won&#39;t be attending.<br/>
<br/>
One of my other children were to receive a similar award several years ago <br/>
for athletics, she let the coach know that she really didn&#39;t want the award <br/>
and she wished it would go to someone who really really liked that sort of <br/>
thing.  That night, when they were announcing the award winners, they called <br/>
myself and DH to the front.  They gave US and award for being supportive of <br/>
the teams and the school and our child.  Kinda embarrassing since they don&#39;t <br/>
usually give parent awards at these things.<br/>
<br/>
So, even if your child had gotten the awards it might not have been a <br/>
positive experience for them.  My children really dislike recognition for <br/>
things like that.  They love sports and being part of a team but don&#39;t like <br/>
to be singled out for anything that recognizes one over another.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids it really matters too and you can see they are crushed if they <br/>
don&#39;t get the award, others are simply embarrassed or don&#39;t feel individuals <br/>
should be recognized in a team sport.<br/>
<br/>
You really shouldn&#39;t be so hard on yourself for wanting your child/children <br/>
to have the FULL experience of growing up.  We all want the world to know <br/>
what great children we have and for them to receive all the accolades the <br/>
world can toss at them.  Sometimes they don&#39;t want them though.<br/>
<br/>
And let me clarify that you can have a completely FULL experience of growing <br/>
up without having accolades and awards but in the sense that they are offered <br/>
up for certain things our children participate in, we as parents can be joy <br/>
filled that our child has been so successful at a certain thing.<br/>
<br/>
Many times these awards are meaningless and really come down to a coaches <br/>
preference instead of actual achievement anyway.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably just a very bittersweet time for you since your child is about <br/>
to enter a different part of their lives journey.  Especially for schooled <br/>
children and the rite of passage that comes with graduation.  I was in tears <br/>
for weeks before graduation, cried non stop through sports awards ceremonies, <br/>
scholarship ceremonies and all the other events that seem to come non stop <br/>
with a high school senior.<br/>
<br/>
It can be a hard time for a mother, be kind to yourself!<br/>

Championship a couple of years ago.  They didn&#39;t get a medal, but Lars won<br/>
the MVP award.  He didn&#39;t call to tell me about it.  He didn&#39;t say anything<br/>
about it when he arrived home.  (The other coach had come back a day early<br/>
and mentioned it to me.)  I had to ask him about it.  I also had to prompt<br/>
him to at least tell a few family members about it.  And it was the same<br/>
reason.  He&#39;s a team player.<br/>
