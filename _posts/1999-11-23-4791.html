<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894894095">hi,<br/>
<br/>
there have a few threads that have touched upon the issue of vaccines so<br/>
i thought i would pass on this web site.  also a good book which is in<br/>
keeping with &#39;thinking outside the box&#39;,  what about immunization?<br/>
exposing the vaccine philosophy a parents&#39; guide to the vaccine<br/>
decision  by cynthia cournoyer.  the book basically says that to not<br/>
immunizing is more than just to not do it (much like unschooling is more<br/>
than just not sending your kids to school).   by choosing to not<br/>
immunize you must begin to see health, illness and germ theory in a<br/>
completely different way than it is commonly thought of.  personally, i<br/>
found this book very helpful in both making a decision and in maintain<br/>
my confidence in that decision when those overwhelming doubts and loud<br/>
public opinions override my own choice and trust in what i believe to be<br/>
the healthiest decision for our family.<br/>
