Always saying no is bad.<br/>
NEVER saying no is just as bad.<br/>
<br/>
Helping children figure out when and where they can do things is great.<br/>
<br/>
YES children can run   and should run, but ANYwhere?   No.<br/>
YES children should be able to climb up and look around, but ANYwhere?   No.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, somewhere else&quot; can be a good answer, but then the parents need to find <br/>
that somewhere else QUICKLY, soon, that day, not a month or a year later.   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;If it was my ladder I&#39;d let you&quot; or &quot;if it was my truck I&#39;d let you&quot; might <br/>
be good answers IF THEY&#39;RE TRUE.    Take the kid home and let him climb up on <br/>
the cab of your truck or the top of your van.   Help him up; help him down.   <br/>
Talk about what he can see differently, and about the danger to him and to the <br/>
vehicle.   Help him climb on the roof and look around.     <br/>
