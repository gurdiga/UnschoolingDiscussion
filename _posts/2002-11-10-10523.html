<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134670794">The previous message ( arrogance, logic, theories) was flawed.   Please dump <br/>
it.  <br/>
Corrected version coming soon.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Peggy, thanks very much for your clear and soothing words on my arrogance <br/>
question.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Since it isn&#39;t provable at this point beyond personal experience, why <br/>
should<br/>
the teaching theory that advocates using the carrot and a stick method hold<br/>
more weight than the personal experience of individual families who have found<br/>
that the carrot and the stick approach distorts and limits the potential of<br/>
the human mind to learn?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I nearly cried, and this isn&#39;t even about &quot;true love&quot; or particular pain.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I am influenced by political correctness.  Perhaps I am arrogant to <br/>
choose a politically correct stance and cling to it with feeling.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my thinking:  <br/>
<br/>
I HAVE seen families with shit for brains, and while I feel sorry for my <br/>
kids, I wouldn&#39;t want my kids to hang around with them, nor to marry them, <br/>
nor to work with or for them, nor to live in their neighborhoods.  [Some of <br/>
those families are my blood relatives, which might be about to cause my <br/>
current theory (not belief, not conviction) to bite its own tail.]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I believe not taking a stand when one<br/>
believes that harm will come from keeping silent is evil.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do too and have been in trouble more than once in this lifetime, starting <br/>
at a young age, for saying &quot;That&#39;s not right&quot; to people who were my social <br/>
superiors.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The only times I&#39;ve haperhaps my many years of being in the decision making <br/>
seat with great evil on one side and what I saw as my duty on the other have <br/>
made me arrogant.<br/>
<br/>
SO... mathematicians and programmers here, please:   What are our number of <br/>
options here?  Let me not suggest a model that&#39;s as pig-ignorant as &quot;either <br/>
evolution or six day creation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How many combinations of factors are we considering, just in a simple summary <br/>
of current options?  I&#39;m not a logician and I might have duplicates, and <br/>
they&#39;re not probably arranged perfectly.  <br/>
<br/>
born in sin / innocent<br/>
<br/>
spanking / no spanking<br/>
<br/>
inbred intelligence / empty vessel<br/>
<br/>
attachment parenting / techno parenting by the clock<br/>
<br/>
adversary / partner<br/>
<br/>
breastfeeding or attempted / unconcerned with even trying<br/>
<br/>
daycare / no daycare<br/>
<br/>
preschool / no preschool<br/>
<br/>
school / homeschool<br/>
<br/>
curriculum / no curriculum<br/>
<br/>
teaching / natural learning<br/>
<br/>
rules / principles<br/>
<br/>
more control / less control<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a bad set of criteria because there are some (many?) which will <br/>
exclude or prevent others.  Maybe that&#39;s just the way multiple sets of <br/>
criteria go.<br/>
<br/>
===============<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&quot;I believe and so must you unthinkingly,&quot; is different from &quot;I believe this<br/>
and I want you to think about it too.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I never even did that when I was teaching.<br/>
Maybe I haven&#39;t been so close to evil as my conscience sometimes thinks I <br/>
have.<br/>

Maybe this is redundant to the item you have above, but I wanted a line<br/>
that showed the choice between:<br/>
<br/>
  listening to &quot;experts&quot;  /  listening to the child<br/>
