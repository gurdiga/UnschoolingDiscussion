&gt; I<br/>
&gt; was trying to say yelling at my dd to knock it off (I can&#39;t think of a proper<br/>
&gt; example right now) is better than calling her a brat or blaming her for<br/>
&gt; ruining our evening.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are GOOD choices, too.<br/>
<br/>
Several posters (I lost count) have now said, &quot;I would rather yell than...&quot;<br/>
and then listed something else that&#39;s bad. We COULD be saying, &quot;Rather than<br/>
yell, I would like to...&quot; and list ways that are GOOD for communicating to<br/>
people, including our children.<br/>
<br/>
I am taking on faith that shouting at each other in families can work and<br/>
everyone is happy. I come from an extremely large, and loud (when we&#39;re<br/>
together in a group of 10 or 40 or, G-d help us, 65 which was the count at<br/>
Aunt Jackie&#39;s last December) Catholic family, but that doesn&#39;t mean people<br/>
are yelling AT each other angrily, it just means the room is vibrating when<br/>
everyone&#39;s conversing at once, especially if Aunt Margaret is there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But this &quot;I would rather yell than...&quot; argument is a lot like the &quot;I would<br/>
rather spank...&quot; arguments I&#39;ve heard. &quot;I would rather spank than scream at<br/>
my kids.&quot; &quot;I would rather spank than ground them.&quot; &quot;I would rather spank<br/>
than glare silently at my child and be angry for hours.&quot; Etc. The arguments<br/>
neglect the, &quot;I would rather do something kind and positive than spank&quot;<br/>
options.<br/>
