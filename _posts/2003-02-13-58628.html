<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575280300">The lovely and talented Anne Ohman has let me put her article online so all <br/>
of us can refer people to it for years to come!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/special/anne">http://sandradodd.com/special/anne</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s linked to a page of comments from readers, to which we can add as time <br/>
goes on, AND there is a link to the special needs folder at unschooling.com.<br/>
<br/>
Next project:  Mary Gold&#39;s article from the November/December issue of HEM.<br/>
If that&#39;s not already online at the HEM site, Mary, can I put it up? <br/>
Can you send me a JPEG of the photo of Conor?<br/>
<br/>
For anyone impatient to read a Mary Gold article in the meantime, look here:<br/>
