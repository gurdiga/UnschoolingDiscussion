<div id="ygrps-yiv-723328365">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it&#39;s time to introduce myself.  I am Twana <br/>
and live in Central Florida (Bushnell) and I unschool <br/>
my 5 and 8 year old sons.  I have searched everywhere <br/>
for a group that supports my beliefs of unschooling and <br/>
have found nothing until this one.  I have emailed some <br/>
of the memeber in South FL and have gotten welcoming <br/>
responses.  I would like to come down sometime for some <br/>
events, but need to find out how long it will take me <br/>
to get there.  <br/>
<br/>
Can someone please tell me why everytime I go to my <br/>
email (unfortunately only about once a week) I have <br/>
about 400 messages...uuuuggggg we have a slow <br/>
connection.  Help :)<br/>
<br/>
Mercedes...I am very interested in the umbrella you <br/>
talk about...please email me more info.  I am also <br/>
interested in the Yearbooks as well as the Book It <br/>
program, the equinox get together, and the Camping <br/>
Trip...please let me know about them all.<br/>
<br/>
Well, now that I&#39;ve written a book, it&#39;s nice to be a <br/>
part of the unschooling family...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much<br/>
Twana<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997740239">Twana, where is it you live?  If my memory serves you&#39;re up near Tampa...<br/>
Well, it takes me, from Venice, about 60 minutes to get to the airport up<br/>
there....about 90 to (almost) Tarpon springs (there is a great weaving store<br/>
up there).   Throw is some ignorant drivers, rainy weather, and make a stab<br/>
at your time...  St. Pete takes about an hour too.<br/>
<br/>
I will send you that umbrella info.  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254089670">Hi all! My name is Nancy, I have an eight year old girl and a six-<br/>
next-week boy. We have been unschooling since before I knew there was <br/>
a name for it. I called it &quot;allowing my kids total freedom in <br/>
educational choices&quot; Although I do feel there are a few things in <br/>
math and English they absolutely have to know, I sneak those in when <br/>
(for example) a question about money or a recipe comes up, or someone <br/>
says &quot;ain&#39;t got no!&quot; Basically, I stay at home and try to<br/>
give my<br/>
kids tons of wonderful toys,  eye-popping experiences, amazing books, <br/>
and lots of cool folks to share their lives, interests, and minds <br/>
with. I am lucky to have a terrific husband who supports us.(even if <br/>
he doesn&#39;t understand all the time) We only had one glitch, this<br/>
time <br/>
last year two of my son&#39;s friends went to the local schools <br/>
kindergarten roundup (I find it interesting that the local district <br/>
calls enrollment into kindergarten a roundup!) and the next thing I <br/>
knew my son was clamoring at me to go to school. My normally <br/>
supportive husband informed me that if I were really giving the kids <br/>
total choice, then I should allow him to go... Long story short, next <br/>
week is the absolutely, positively last week of school! And it<br/>
isn&#39;t <br/>
coming soon enough for me or my son! I swore years ago I would never <br/>
have a child wake up in my house and say &quot;OOOHHH Not AgaIN!!!<br/>
I&#39;ve <br/>
got a STomaCH, the TEaCHEr haTES ME!!!....&quot; and all those<br/>
thousands <br/>
of other excuses I used to get out of school. So, right after <br/>
Christmas, when the novelty wore off, that&#39;s what I had on my<br/>
hands. <br/>
We will not be repeating this ungodly experiment any time soon!  <br/>
So that&#39;s us, sometimes goofy, oftentimes weird,<br/>
every-now-and-then <br/>
upset-pulling-out-our-hair, but most of the time happy-enjoying-life <br/>
and what it throws at us! I look forward to meeting all of you, just <br/>
as soon as I figure out how to read and reply to the group! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Did you guys read the article in this issue of unschooling-dotcom&#39;s online <br/>
newsletter? About the guy in India. He talks about &quot;minimally intrusive <br/>
education&quot;  - MIE - nice concept that has a reasonable chance of becoming <br/>
some sort of &quot;fad&quot; in the educational system - makes a good soundbite &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
This article is absolutely fascinating. <br/>
