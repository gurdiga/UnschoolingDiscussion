<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085051614">I have a friend with an asthmatic child. She has had a lot of success with the Buteko?? method, which involves learning how to control asthma through breathing. She still keeps medication on hand for emergencies, which occur when her child has forgotten how horrible an attack is, and so has refused to do his exercises regularly. Anyone else heard of it?<br/>
