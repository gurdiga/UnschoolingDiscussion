OOOH - someone who&#39;s heard of Greg Brown!  My favorite<br/>
singer/songwriter!  And I don&#39;t even live in Iowa.  I have almost all of<br/>
his cd&#39;s and have seen him perform at least 5 times, I love him.  I<br/>
think he&#39;s sexier than Alan Rickman (although Alan Rickman is pretty<br/>
sexy too).<br/>
So glad to see someone else who likes him too.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Kate</div>

You know what,  I think I made a big mistake,  I guess I know I made a big mistake,  I was totally thinking that Greg Brown was from here,  Minnesota,  because I&#39;ve seen him up here so much ,  duhhhh,  I&#39;m not even sure,  Is he from Iowa?  very possible.  He has a big following in Minnesota.<br/>
 <br/>
I love his,  &#39; Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey&#39;!!    Pretty much as sexy as Rickman&#39;s voice!<br/>
If Shyrley is reading this she has got to listen to him,  his singing is all I need,  Oh and I guess a few lines from Die Hard and Robin Hood.    OK ,,,I&#39;ll stop now.<br/>
 <br/>
Kelli, feeling really stupid,  sorry about that.<br/>
