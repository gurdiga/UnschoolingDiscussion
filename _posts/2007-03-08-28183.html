<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134030998">Hiya,<br/>
<br/>
Ive posted this to the CrunchyUnschoolers list also but was curious  <br/>
to see your spin on it too... We have moved to RU since last year and  <br/>
enjoying the journey :)<br/>
<br/>
our 5yr old dd has generally achieved what i would call a &quot;sense of  <br/>
balance&quot; in dvds, food and sleep times and almost everything else.  <br/>
*Except* on the question of buying things...<br/>
<br/>
It seems like every trip out is an opportunity to buy something. We  <br/>
have been going along with this by:<br/>
- buying if it is &quot;affordable&quot; (obviously if we have not got the  <br/>
money or its v expensive there are real limits)<br/>
- getting it from an alternative cheaper option where possible,  <br/>
mainly ebay (led to our dd walking into a toy shop, picking up a toy  <br/>
and shouting to me across it &quot;hey dad, can we get this cheaper on the  <br/>
computer?&quot; LOL)<br/>
<br/>
As we do this we try to strike a balance of discussing issues of  <br/>
budget, money & value while not judging what she wants to buy.<br/>
<br/>
Some thoughts/ issues related to this:<br/>
<br/>
- we (the parents) feel that a sense of abundance is an important  <br/>
quality we foster in ourselves and we aim to foster in our children<br/>
- we do however also try to avoid accumulating lots of &quot;things&quot; and  <br/>
spending &quot;excessive&quot; amounts on ourselves<br/>
- also realize how complicated our modeling on this issue is since  <br/>
our decision about whether to buy something we like is based on &quot;how  <br/>
much do we need it & is it worth the money&quot; which are both extremely  <br/>
subjective criteria which also often rely on a fair bit of info<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed our dd self regulate in other areas where there is  <br/>
more feedback for her to work with  � so she gets sick of dvds, she  <br/>
feels the impact of food on her body. However it seems that buying  <br/>
more things has no real impact because we tend to avoid arbitrary  <br/>
limits on money and she does not quite get the idea of budgets  <br/>
(although we are trying to explain it, its partly because we dont  <br/>
work to a strict budget but just internally limit our spending  <br/>
maybe?) and new things just get spread throughout the house.<br/>
<br/>
one thing we have started to try is avoiding impulse buying... so  <br/>
when we go to the shops we discuss what we want. Then if something  <br/>
else comes up we try to &quot;come back&quot; if we are still interested in the  <br/>
next few days. We discussed this with her and apply it to ourselves  <br/>
as well... but it still seems like an external crutch to her self  <br/>
regulating her decisions on this... and i know the fun & enjoyment of  <br/>
occasional spontaneous buying too<br/>
<br/>
Dd has her own purse with money in it... we give her money when she  <br/>
asks for it and so far she has had very little need to spend it  <br/>
(although she has given us money when we have been caught short a few  <br/>
times). My gut feeling is against pocket money at this early stage of  <br/>
shifting to RU, which i feel creates an artificial separation of  <br/>
money � we dont ration out money between me & my dw for example...  <br/>
its &quot;our&quot; money. Although when dd feels confident that she can have  <br/>
money if she needs it maybe we will chat to her about giving her a  <br/>
regular amount as well rather than her having to ask... But im keen  <br/>
to hear your spin on this...<br/>
<br/>
Any comments are welcome but im basically wondering how do we  <br/>
encourage a less consumerist approach without artificially limiting  <br/>
money? Do i just be more patient and is this just a final RU  <br/>
transition thing or am i missing something here?<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you verbalizing this process, or is it all internal? Wrt your <br/>
own spending, I mean. That may help her understand your own process <br/>
better. The other thing is, though, since this is *such* a <br/>
subjective issue, she may well have a different oppinion and view of <br/>
the world, or be meeting a different need by shopping than you are. <br/>
That&#39;s more complicated. <br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; feels the impact of food on her body.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d look into the idea of &quot;self regulation&quot; - usually there&#39;s an <br/>
expectation behind that expression. Her &quot;self regulation&quot; is close <br/>
enough to your expectation wrt dvs and food as to be within your <br/>
comfort zone. What happens when she wants to &quot;regulate&quot; at a level <br/>
that is *outside* your comfort zone? That&#39;s something to think about.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; However it seems that buying  <br/>

&gt; limits on money and she does not quite get the idea of budgets  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a couple thoughts about this - the first being to wonder <br/>
*how* you are explaining and if its a way that works in other areas <br/>
of helping her to understand something. For example, my dd is really <br/>
visual and physical, so explaining with words doesn&#39;t work well with <br/>
her - but I still do it on occasion! Bad habit on my part.<br/>
<br/>
The other thought goes back to the ideas about expectations and the <br/>
subjectivity of &quot;consumerism&quot; - maybe instead of trying to explain <br/>
you need to be working on discovering what *her* thoughts and <br/>
feelings are. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and new things just get spread throughout the house.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds like expectations on your part - why shouldn&#39;t new <br/>
things get spread throughout the house? Hidden under furniture and <br/>
in the backs of closets? Maybe the idea of living in a giant <br/>
treasure hunt is appealing to your dd on some visceral level - think <br/>
about it as a twist on &quot;strewing&quot;. Much as I love the idea of my <br/>
house as a museum:<br/>

<br/>
I confess it looks more like a rummage sale most of the time - but <br/>
gosh I love a good rummage sale! You can find the most amazing <br/>
things sometimes, but you do have to dig a little.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>example...  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; its &quot;our&quot; money.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, this may have something to do with how she processes <br/>
information -and younger kids tend to be a bit more concrete and <br/>
physical in general, so having her own, that she can hold, may meet <br/>
a need for understanding on a physical level. Mo&#39;s like that, but <br/>
she also tends to forget and mislay things, so from time to time <br/>
I&#39;ve used play money so that she can see and hold the number <br/>
of &quot;dollars&quot; available for spending, but I don&#39;t have to worry about <br/>
it getting lost. <br/>
<br/>
Mo also sometimes needs to see quantities to understand how things <br/>
get divided up - especially now that my stepson is living here and <br/>
we have to divide things 4 ways when before it was only 3. Last <br/>
night we made piles of cookies, for example, but I&#39;ve also done it <br/>
in the store with fingers or bills in my wallet, or whatever comes <br/>
to hand, so she can see how I&#39;m trying to meet everyone&#39;s spending <br/>
wants at once within our budget. We have a pretty &quot;solid&quot; budget <br/>
most of the time, though - I can pull a dollar or two from gas or <br/>
groceries, but that&#39;s about it.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; encourage a less consumerist approach without artificially <br/>
 </span></blockquote>limiting  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; money?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Consumerism is a pretty &quot;big&quot; idea to work with - I&#39;ve personally <br/>
found it helpful to break these kinds of concepts into smaller, more <br/>
basic priciples...and fears. I&#39;ve also found it helpful to reframe <br/>
negative ideals like &quot;less consumerist&quot; into more positive <br/>
terminology - &quot;more....&quot; what would that be? There&#39;s a core value in <br/>
there that you can work on supporting, maybe in different ways than <br/>
you are currently seeing with the focus on (less) consumerism.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-553610440">It may help to think of it this way:<br/>
If you were schooling at home you would put aside a portion of your budget for curriculum, paper, pens, field trips, etc. Do the same for unschooling.<br/>
A portion of your budget should be going to support her interests. A five year olds interests tend to include toys &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
Another thing I did when my kids were that young, was to try to set up my schedule so that my shopping trips could happen when someone else was with the little ones. At 5, lots of kids don&#39;t yet understand the whole idea of budgets. Particularly nowadays, when ATM&#39;s make getting money look SO easy. They are the magical money machines!<br/>
