<div id="ygrps-yiv-552435274">If Hallowe&#39;en is evil, then Christians shouldn&#39;t have anything to do <br/>
with it at all. No dressing up; no begging for candy; no handing out <br/>
candy (or anything else) If it isn&#39;t, then why make up some <br/>
big &quot;baptized&quot; version of it? sheesh.<br/>
<br/>
I agree; if Christians are going to define Halloween as evil, they shouldn&#39;t <br/>
have anything to do with it at all.  Doing so &quot;compromises&quot; your belief <br/>
system, in my opinion.  However, so many Christians believe so many different <br/>
things, such as total immersion baptism or sprinkling of water - what about babies <br/>
being baptized?  There&#39;s a hot topic with Christians.  Oh, here&#39; s a really hot <br/>
topic-once saved always saved???  I think God looks at our hearts and the <br/>
intent we have when we commit an act.  The Bible is too conflicting in its&#39; <br/>
statements.  You can support each idea by searching through Scriptures and taking <br/>
them out of context-sometimes even in context.  I personally don&#39;t look at <br/>
Halloween as evil.  To my family, it is just a fun time to dress up and go <br/>
trick-or-treating.  And I even let my kids be whatever they want to be, whether it is <br/>
a witch, a demon, a ghost-whatever.  For this reason, we don&#39;t go to church <br/>
fall festivals.  If you want to welcome people I don&#39;t believe you can put <br/>
stipulations on the welcome mat.  At least not at church.  In my own home, I&#39;ll <br/>
decide what parameters I want.  As I write that it sounds like a double <br/>
standard, but I reason it with &quot;but I&#39;m not God.  I&#39;m not all forgiving and all loving <br/>
and all accepting.  I&#39;m not willing to die on the cross for the entire <br/>
world.&quot;  Does that make sense, or am I making excuses?<br/>

Some art is missing.  Lambs.  Easter lambs.  I need to upload some I like <br/>
enough to look at, though.  I had them linked to something that went away.<br/>

&#39;Tis the season for anti-Halloween spooky propaganda.   If you get any, <br/>
please send it to me for my collection.<br/>
<br/>
Also, top right of that page, links to two other new things--a page about <br/>
Halloween candy (and letting kids eat as much as they want, which is more an <br/>
American problem than an English problem--and please note that the candy corn <br/>
lines are scanner art of real candy corn, which still sits right here, and <br/>
probably will until it&#39;s dusty), AND...   a link to a couple of photos of my kids in <br/>
costumes, but check back!   I have a little pile of them saved up to scan and <br/>
add.   The second one is also in the book Moving a Puddle, but it&#39;s in b&w in <br/>
the book, so here you can see it in color.   Kirby is an online-cartoon <br/>
character called Black Mage.   Marty and Holly are just what they seem to be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-247915037">Hey, just read that letter!  Well my kids would feel &quot;tricked&quot; for <br/>
sure if they received such a book from a house that they &quot;trick or <br/>
treated&quot; at!<br/>
<br/>
When I was growing up, I always made 2 costumes, one for my church <br/>
halloween thing of some sort of bible character, and a REAL costume.<br/>
<br/>
I feel for all the girls that have to come up with girl costumes <br/>
from the bible.  Let&#39;s see, should I be Mary or Easter this year?  <br/>
To be the Egyptian queen was always frowned upon, and Eve didn&#39;t <br/>
wear enough clothes to be considered appropriate for church.  All <br/>
the other women were either very nondescript or indecent whores!<br/>
