<div id="ygrps-yiv-808849770">Bear with me ladies I will address all emails directed to me as well as the email I directed to Sandra. Delete if this does not apply to you or if you are not interested. Please keep in mind, that the way I talk and think and type do not always come across the way that I intend, so please take me seriously but take it with a grain of salt! Thanks<br/>
Sandra<br/>
For the record I dont support what Andrea Yates did to her children in anyway. Nor was I trying to attack you. Just thought I would offer my opinion on what you said. I meant no disrespect, all was meant with respect to you. If it did not come across that way I apologize. <br/>

I raise my children and teach them certain things. An important one to be is to be kind to others, stand up for what they believe in, read their bibles daily (not a requirement ha!ha!), love each other and tolerate and embrace those that are &quot;different&quot;. When I say teach them certain things -I mean, that it is modeled in the home as well as certain rules are understood in the home. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447766461">I differ with you then, I do not  consider swatting a hand the same as hitting them. I take hitting to mean- getting a belt or a dowel or a wooden spoon and hitting the child. What I am referring to is a swat to the hand and a firm No! No mark, no redness, just the child knowing that they are not to touch xyz again.<br/>

swatting. Striking another&#39;s body is hitting, which is why we use the word <br/>
&quot;hit&quot; in our family to describe all of the above.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I would call that hitting.  If that&#39;s how you want to handle that <br/>
particular problem, then at least you should call it what it is.  It&#39;s not <br/>
a matter of whether there is a mark or redness.  It&#39;s a matter of causing <br/>
pain as a method of discipline.  Saying that it isn&#39;t hitting doesn&#39;t make <br/>
it something else.  There are other ways to handle it and still keep the <br/>
child safe.<br/>
