 Or, do some have more privileges than others?<br/>

tend to throw the list off-kilter---and don&#39;t actually contribute <br/>

<br/>
This is valuable to know.  Kelly, who do you think *might* be <br/>
granted &quot;special privileges,&quot; and can you define or specify &quot;special <br/>
privileges&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think that&#39;s natural. I think that people who <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you mean by &quot;off-kilter&quot;?  Do you mean to say that members <br/>
who &quot;tend to throw the list off-kilter&quot; AND &quot;don&#39;t actually <br/>
contribute *positively*&quot; might have fewer privileges; or do you mean <br/>
to say that members who &quot;tend to throw the list off-kilter&quot; OR &quot;don&#39;t <br/>
actually contribute *positively*&quot; might have fewer privileges?  Also, <br/>
it would be valuable to know what *positively* means in your <br/>
understanding.<br/>
<br/>
It would be helpful if I understood what you are really trying to say.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The idea isn&#39;t going to make much sense if you just swap the word privilege<br/>
for right.<br/>
<br/>
The list exists as a resource to help people unschool and trust and respect<br/>
their kids. If someone&#39;s use of the list makes the list unusable for others,<br/>
then they&#39;re abusing their privilege of using the list.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t agree with what Kelly wrote here.<br/>
<br/>
The list is for anyone who wants to unschool and trust and respect their<br/>
kids. They can ask questions. They can offer advice. They can read. As long<br/>
as what people are doing isn&#39;t interfering with that (as in side discussions<br/>
-- like Alan Rickman ;-) -- that don&#39;t contribute to anyone&#39;s knowledge of<br/>
unschooling but don&#39;t disrupt the list either) then they have a right to use<br/>
the list.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really a pretty simple concept!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>These are Kelly&#39;s own personal thoughts. She isn&#39;t an owner or moderator of<br/>
the list so she isn&#39;t in a position to extend privileges or rights to<br/>
anyone. Whether she feels there are special privileges or not has no impact<br/>
on anyone&#39;s privileges or rights anyway.<br/>
<br/>
So discussing this is pointless. It&#39;s not helping anyone unschool.<br/>

offers no insights on how the list runs, only on how Kelly perceives that<br/>
