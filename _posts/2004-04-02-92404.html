This is a three-year NSF supported project to develop a library of uniquely <br/>
interactive, web-based virtual manipulatives or concept tutorials, mostly in <br/>
the form of Java applets, for mathematics instruction (K-8 emphasis). The <br/>
project includes dissemination and extensive internal and external evaluation.   <br/>
National Science Foundation<br/>
Award Number 9819107<br/>
<br/>
Learning and understanding mathematics, at every level, requires student <br/>
engagement. Mathematics is not, as has been said, a spectator sport. Too much of <br/>
current instruction fails to actively involve students. One way to address the <br/>
problem is through the use of manipulatives, physical objects that help <br/>
students visualize relationships and applications. We can now use computers to <br/>
create virtual learning environments to address the same goals. <br/>
Prior to this time, there has been very little done to create good <br/>
computer-based mathematical manipulatives or learning tools at elementary and middle <br/>
school levels with any degree of interactivity. Our Utah State University team is <br/>
building Java-based mathematical tools and editors that allow us to create <br/>
exciting new approaches to interactive mathematical instruction. The use of Java <br/>
as a programming language provides platform independence and web-based <br/>
accessibility. <br/>
Ultimately we will make all materials available at several sources on the <br/>
Internet, creating a national library from which teachers may freely draw to <br/>
enrich their mathematics classrooms. The materials will also be of importance for <br/>
the mathematical training of both in-service and pre-service elementary <br/>
teachers. <br/>
