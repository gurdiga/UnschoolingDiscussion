<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898059654">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
Finally have my new email up and running.  Not only did I have problems with MY systems, but the email provider was having problems as well.  All is well now, and I am back in business.  Hope you all didn&#39;t miss me TOO much on the lists lately!  hardy-har.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a little funny to start off my new email addy on the right foot.<br/>
<br/>
THE RED SHIRT.<br/>
<br/>
Long ago lived a brave sea Captain. He was<br/>
a manly man&#39;s man who showed no fear in facing his<br/>
enemies. One day,while sailing the seven seas, a lookout<br/>
spotted a pirate ship and the crew became frantic. The captain<br/>
bellowed, &quot;Bring me my red shirt.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The First Mate quickly retrieved the captain&#39;s red shirt and <br/>
while wearing the bright garb he led his mates into battle <br/>
and defeated the pirates. <br/>
<br/>
Later on, the lookout spotted not one, but two pirate ships. The captain again howled for his red shirt, and so attired once again vanquished the pirates. <br/>
<br/>
That evening, all the men sat around on the deck recounting the day&#39;s triumphs and one of the them asked the captain, &quot;Sir, why did you call for your red shirt before battle?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The captain replied &quot;If I am wounded in the attack, the shirt <br/>
will not show my blood, and thus, you men will continue to<br/>
resist, unafraid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All of the men sat in silence and marveled at the courage of <br/>
such a man&#39;s manly man.<br/>
<br/>
As dawn came the next morning, the lookout once again <br/>
spotted not one, not two, but TEN pirate ships approaching. <br/>
The rank and file all stared in worshipful silence at the <br/>
captain and waited for his usual reply.<br/>
<br/>
The captain gazed with steely eyes upon the vast armada <br/>
arrayed against his mighty sailing ship and, without fear,<br/>
turned, and calmly shouted:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Get me my brown pants.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
