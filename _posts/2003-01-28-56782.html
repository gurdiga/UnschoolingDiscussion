&lt;&lt; I always wanted pink hair since before Missing Persons<br/>
 was popular, but never had the guts. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have two words for you...HAIR MASCARA! It comes in lovely, brilliant <br/>
colors, doesn&#39;t cost much and you can change your mind.<br/>
I do blue and pink bits usually, but I can wash it out if I want a different <br/>
color or none at all! Fun.<br/>

complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

My hair&#39;s pretty long and it would end up getting color all over my<br/>
clothes, that just wouldn&#39;t look so cool.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
