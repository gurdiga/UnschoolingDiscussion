<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900830570">I have a 12 yr old visually impaired daughter, pulled her out of <br/>
school back in Oct.  No problem with school really, she had very <br/>
caring teachers and a wonderful vision teacher that kept a close eye <br/>
on her - We pulled her out due to her self-esteem.  She was so <br/>
unhappy, she really couldn&#39;t keep up etc, she felt like everyday she <br/>
was already starting off behind.  Her vision makes it hard to find <br/>
her friends in a crowd etc... well, I could type forever about <br/>
that..........She is so much happier now, I feel 100% comfortable <br/>
with our decision to pull her out.  As I&#39;m sure most new <br/>
homeschoolers to, we&#39;ve tried various things trying to find out what <br/>
will work best for us.  We first only used internet to try to <br/>
continue on what she had started in school - that didn&#39;t work, then <br/>
we bought several books/workbooks for each subject, that didn&#39;t work, <br/>
we dabbled with unschooling and she ran with her love of Japan, <br/>
anime, manga etc... which was thrilling - it proved to me that she&#39;ll <br/>
give 150% with something she likes.  I&#39;m trying to as a <br/>
parent/teacher just make things available to her that should would <br/>
have been learning this year in school - library books on geography, <br/>
history videos, recording shows on cable about the human body etc.... <br/>
The thing is she won&#39;t just on her own grab a video or a library <br/>
book, I have to say &quot;Okay, lets watch this video&quot;  she of course <br/>
fights me the whole time - Am I trying too much?  It&#39;s scary to think <br/>
this whole school year could go by and all she&#39;s really done and been <br/>
interested in was Japan.  With her main problem with her vision being <br/>
light sensitive, she&#39;s a night owl.  She&#39;s a different person at <br/>
night, happier, giggly, energetic, chatty etc... I can only stay up <br/>
with her for so long because I&#39;m lucky enough to be able to do most <br/>
of my job from home BUT I have to be up & ready for phone calls by <br/>
8am.  Night time would be prime time for her where she&#39;d be so open <br/>
to things.  During the day, I fight with her to get her up, then <br/>
she&#39;s just grumpy all day until the sun goes down!!!!  When I have to <br/>
go to the office (which is at my mom & dad&#39;s house) I pack her <br/>
backback with stuff to do - not workbooks or anything &quot;school-like&quot; <br/>
but she&#39;ll manage to doze off on the couch.  She loves the computer <br/>
and our rule is she can&#39;t get on until 5pm when all her friends get <br/>
on after they&#39;ve gotten out of school.  Sometimes I think I should <br/>
only let her on the computer a few times a week but I have to admit <br/>
that she&#39;s done more reading online than in her whole life which has <br/>
never come easy for her with her vision but she can read anime storys <br/>
online, read show spoilers online etc... and she&#39;s reading YEAH!!!!! <br/>
so she&#39;s doing other things on the computer that are &quot;educational&quot;.  <br/>
I just worry that we aren&#39;t doing enough.....I do take her to school <br/>
for chorus everyday, she&#39;s doing an art class every other week <br/>
through our homeschool group and a classical composers/shakespeare <br/>
class through our homeschool group each week.  Today is Thursday and <br/>
all we&#39;ve done is those classes - along with lots of conversations <br/>
about things in the car like religion, Terri Shiavo & brain <br/>
functions, bird care etc..... Our conversations are great.  But what <br/>
about math, spelling, grammar, etc..... It&#39;s just scary!!!!!!!  If <br/>
she had her choice, she&#39;d stay up all night reading anime on the <br/>
computer, looking at anime pictures, checking out anime conventions, <br/>
making flyers etc.. on Microsoft Publisher, talking to friends, <br/>
playing Final Fantasy on the Playstation, Playing with her birds and <br/>
our dogs and snacking.  Then she&#39;ll manage to do her 3 classes and <br/>
then sleep the rest of the day.................AHHHHHHH<br/>
<br/>
HELP!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-220289529">Tracie - She sounds like a wonderful kid and it sounds like you got her <br/>
out of school before her love of learning was crushed so <br/>
CONGRATULATIONS! And she sounds like a sensible kid who objects and <br/>
resists being coerced into using her time and energy to do things in <br/>
which she is completely uninterested. This is a POSITIVE trait - I hope <br/>
you can see it that way. She&#39;s way more mentally healthy than those <br/>
kids who just do what they&#39;re told, go along, make the minimal effort <br/>
to placate those in authority over them.<br/>
<br/>
Your description of her day today sounds great - I LOVE it that you see <br/>
the value of your conversations. You sound like a natural-born <br/>
unschooling family EXCEPT you have some learning to do about real <br/>
learning (not schooling).<br/>
<br/>
Instead of giving you specific suggestions, I just want to encourage <br/>
you to browse around on Sandra&#39;s website &lt;sandradodd.com&gt; and read <br/>
whatever catches your fancy.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I wish you&#39;d take a break from trying to make her <br/>
&quot;keep up&quot; or learn what she&#39;d learn in school, etc. How about just <br/>
taking the rest of the year off and enjoying yourselves, instead, while <br/>
YOU learn about learning?<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll still learn. I guarantee it. In fact, just try to stop her! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She won&#39;t necessarily learn what is taught in school (remember, <br/>
&quot;taught&quot; does not mean &quot;learned&quot;) but what she learns will be <br/>
important, deep, lasting, and will ALSO lead eventually to all kinds of <br/>
wonderful things like her being self-motivated, independent, <br/>
responsible for herself, with self-understanding far beyond those kids <br/>
who have been directed and micro-managed for most of their lives.  <br/>
There are many hidden lessons that kids learn very very well when they <br/>
are &quot;schooled.&quot; These are lessons you probably don&#39;t want her to learn <br/>
and don&#39;t mean to teach - &quot;learning is hard,&quot; &quot;other people know better <br/>
than you do what you should learn,&quot; &quot;your interests don&#39;t really <br/>
matter,&quot; &quot;don&#39;t trust your own inner voice,&quot; &quot;go along to get along,&quot; <br/>
&quot;other people&#39;s judgment of you is what really counts,&quot; and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the one thing you could do would be to find a way that you could <br/>
work out your schedules so that she does have the chance to be up late <br/>
and sleep late. At LEAST let her stay up late and then nap during the <br/>
day. Lots of our kids do that and she has a particularly good reason <br/>
for it - honor her needs.<br/>

<br/>
In school, Japan might be a one week unit with a test and that&#39;s all of Japan.<br/>
In the real world (as you already know, but you said &quot;scary&quot; so you&#39;re <br/>
probably freezing up when you try to see), Japan is geography, history, language, <br/>
art, fashion, culture, architecture, commerce, religion, electronics, animation, <br/>
mythology, theatre, music, food, and maybe a couple of other things.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know that in Japan they have an entire disease we&#39;ve never heard of <br/>
here?  BIG disease.  They put people in hospitals for it.  I don&#39;t know the <br/>
Japanese word, but it translates literally as &quot;school refusal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
How did she &quot;do&quot; Japan?<br/>
Do you mean to learn about it and care about it and tie it in to every other <br/>
thing she knows about?  Sounds more like she&#39;s living her own life and doing <br/>
her own learning.  Japan didn&#39;t even know she was there, but she knows Japan is <br/>
there!<br/>
<br/>
Her learning is great.<br/>

Lots of people are, even if they see well, but how wonderful that electricity <br/>

<br/>
night, happier, giggly, energetic, chatty etc... -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that here too, with my kids.  Some of the best discussions and <br/>
ideas happen late at night.  I wrote an article about it:<br/>

<br/>
-=- Night time would be prime time for her where she&#39;d be so open <br/>
<br/>
to things. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Night time IS prime time for her. <br/>
She doesn&#39;t need you with her to be open to things.  There are books, movies, <br/>
the internet, art supplies. <br/>
<br/>
-=- During the day, I fight with her to get her up, then <br/>
<br/>
she&#39;s just grumpy all day until the sun goes down!!!!  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Two bads.<br/>
Bad you&#39;re fighting, bad she&#39;s made grumpy.<br/>
You don&#39;t need to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Why does she need to be awake?  You need to work, right?  <br/>
<br/>
-=-She loves the computer <br/>
<br/>
and our rule is she can&#39;t get on until 5pm when all her friends get <br/>
<br/>
on after they&#39;ve gotten out of school.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t seem designed to make her happy or to help her learn.<br/>
If her opportunities to learn and her happiness aren&#39;t among your very top <br/>
priorities, you&#39;ll have a hard time homeschooling.<br/>

I think this one is the worst and most long-lasting. It&#39;s also the one <br/>
that raises its head in &quot;the real world&quot; when schooled kids start <br/>
working.<br/>
<br/>
It results in adults who do the least amount of work and still remain <br/>
employable. Who never do any &quot;extra&quot; because it won&#39;t bring them any <br/>
reward.<br/>
<br/>
They have a hard time RElearning that learning is cool in and of <br/>
itself---that you don&#39;t have to &quot;get&quot; anything in order to enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
Bad damage---in many ways.<br/>

turn to read aloud, and when I came to the word &quot;knowledge&quot; my <br/>
teacher was ready to help me with it but I read it smoothly and <br/>
fluently without missing a beat.  The teacher, happily surprised at <br/>
my ability, smiled hugely and said &quot;very GOOD Patti!&quot; and I could <br/>
immediately feel a change in the atmosphere- I remember feeling the <br/>
other kids&#39; eyes on me and staring down at my book with a flushed <br/>
face.  My 9yo self concluded that it was safest to appear exactly <br/>
average in the classroom so as not to attract *any* focus to <br/>
myself.  During my next turn I pretended to stumble over what I <br/>
thought was the &quot;right&quot; amount of words.<br/>

The mention of Japan made me think of a Grace Llewellyn quote:<br/>
&quot;In the end, the secret to learning is so simple: forget about it. Think only about whatever you love. Follow it, do it, dream about it. One day, you will glance up at your collection of Japanese literature, or trip over the solar oven you built, and it will hit you: learning was there all the time, happening by itself.&quot;<br/>

Many learn not to expect that things will make sense. They expect &quot;learning&quot; <br/>
to be rote memorization long enough to pass the test, and nothing more. They <br/>
don&#39;t ask questions because they don&#39;t expect the answers to make any <br/>

 </span></blockquote>YES - this is the number one effect of schooling that I see in my <br/>
college students. They truly don&#39;t expect things to be understandable. <br/>
It makes them SEEM mentally lazy because they don&#39;t bother to try to <br/>
understand - their goal seems to be to memorize what they can of what <br/>
the book and teacher say and spit as much out on a test as possible. <br/>
Those who are good at that are considered &quot;smart&quot; and the other <br/>
students seem to think they were just born that way - which is true, to <br/>
some extent.<br/>
<br/>
Even the &quot;smart&quot; students, though, very seldom exhibit a desire for <br/>
understanding. They don&#39;t even equate &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;understanding&quot; - <br/>
to them &quot;learning&quot; IS memorizing long enough to do well on a test. When <br/>
my kids take college courses, the teachers go nuts over what fantastic <br/>
students they are - they stand out by a mile. I know why - it is <br/>
because the teachers can see in their eyes, read in their body <br/>
language, hear in their voices and tell just by the looks on their <br/>
faces that they are there to learn and understand, not to swallow and <br/>
regurgitate undigested material. There are teachers who get excited by <br/>
the existence of such rare students. I know this - I&#39;m lucky - LUCKY - <br/>
if I get one in a class of 35 students. There are many semesters that I <br/>
don&#39;t have any students who are &quot;there to learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is what I wanted for my kids - to NOT have that light snuffed out.<br/>
<br/>
It is why what we&#39;re doing really is &quot;UN-schooling.&quot; Sometimes people <br/>
complain about the negativity of that word or that it only says what <br/>
we&#39;re &quot;not&quot; doing instead of what we are doing. True enough - but that <br/>
IS the point of NOT schooling them - we&#39;re NOT doing to them what <br/>
schooling does to most kids. And NOT schooling them is a big huge deal.<br/>
<br/>
If everybody in a country was completely brainwashed and there were <br/>
just a few people who managed, somehow, to escape or avoid being <br/>
brainwashed, the fact that they were &quot;UN-brainwashed&quot; would be the <br/>
logical way to describe them.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the case with our children - being &quot;UN-schooled&quot; is the logical <br/>
way to describe people who are among the few who have managed to escape <br/>
or avoid being &quot;schooled.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was teaching at Penn State (6 years, main campus) I never had a <br/>
homeschooled student, but this was the major difference that I saw in <br/>
the returning ed students--those there on the GI bill or people going to <br/>
college after several years out working. These people *truly* wanted to <br/>
be there, wanted to be learning in a way that the kids fresh out of <br/>
highschool did not. They also had life experiences to share and connect <br/>
knowledge to in a way that was so refreshing and interesting. Having a <br/>
class full of the same dick and jane gets really boring, and there&#39;s <br/>
only so many times one can see an essay that begins with a dictionary <br/>
definition before becoming really jaded. I can only imagine what it <br/>
would have been like to have an Unschooled kid in one of my classes.<br/>
<br/>
Problem is the dichotomy such students set up in a discussion <br/>
class--they just leave the other kids in the dust with their ability to <br/>
think quickly and critically, make connections and draw conclusions. It <br/>
always amazed me how incapable the majority of students were of simply <br/>
having an OPINION--they were just waiting to be told what to think. When <br/>
I&#39;d tell them to form an opinion, not my opinion, but their own critical <br/>
opinion, they were not only incapable, they were suspicious because for <br/>
the past 12 to 14 years of their lives they&#39;d been taught that their <br/>
opinion did not matter.<br/>

frequently being untruthful. They STILL can only give so many &quot;A&#39;s&quot; and <br/>
so many &quot;B&#39;s&quot; and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Where I teach college, I once gave &quot;A&#39;s&quot; to an entire class - it was an <br/>
unusual group, small class, summer school, and 80 percent of them my <br/>
own former students.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get rehired for the next couple of semesters and when they <br/>
finally called and wanted me back at that college, the dean called me <br/>
in first and said, &quot;We had some concerns about your grading policies.&quot; <br/>
HUH? I&#39;d taught there about 15 years before that - and he simply <br/>
STOPPED offering me courses because I&#39;d given &quot;A&#39;s&quot; to one whole class? <br/>
It didn&#39;t matter - they  want everybody&#39;s grade distribution to end up <br/>
about the same. He TOLD me that. He gave me printouts of the grade <br/>
distributions for our department, division, and the college - I was <br/>
told in no uncertain terms that my grade distribution ought to match <br/>
those pretty closely. I don&#39;t have to grade on a curve - just make my <br/>
grading scale work out that way - the suggestion was to have enough <br/>
subjectively-graded assignments that even if they all do well on the <br/>
objective tests I could give them different grades based on the <br/>
subjective work.<br/>

[CLAPPING HARD AS THEY DO ON FAMILY FEUD AND SAYING ENTHUSIASTICALLY:]<br/>
<br/>
Good answer!  Good answer!<br/>
<br/>
Especially because they NAME these ranks, and people seem required to use <br/>
them outside of school.  TOTAL STRANGERS, old men, say &quot;What grade are you in?&quot; <br/>
and any child is expected to answer.   <br/>
<br/>
I might never have noticed that had my kids not HAD that ready answer, and <br/>
they&#39;ve baffled many strangers by pausing and thinking instead of immediately <br/>
responding with &quot;third grade&quot; or &quot;sophomore in high school&quot; or something.  They <br/>
say, &quot;I don&#39;t go to school,&quot; which even among most homeschoolers is NOT &quot;the <br/>
right answer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then the strangers say, &quot;But what grade are you in?&quot; and these renegades from <br/>
heirarchy say &quot;We don&#39;t do grades.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then, sure enough, others (especially kids) do not know how to treat them.<br/>
<br/>
Are they superior? Equal? Inferior?<br/>
If they would only state a grade level, our neighbors across the cul-de-sac <br/>
would be able to interact with them, but they didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t, and so those <br/>
boys didn&#39;t come back after about a visit and a half during which time they <br/>
couldn&#39;t stop asking &quot;but what about sports?&quot; and &quot;What do you mean, you&#39;re not <br/>
in a grade?  How old are you?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I was a very young teacher and had a small straight body, I went to a <br/>
Jr. High sock-hop disguised as an alien, entirely unidentifiable as to male or <br/>
female, teacher or student, and I walked differently.   No one was comfortable <br/>
in the least.  Everyone was afraid to be too nice or too mean to me because <br/>
surely I WAS inferior or superior, and they didn&#39;t know which, and seemed <br/>
terrified to guess wrong.   No one would dance with me, though I tried.  What if I <br/>
were the opposite gender?  Or what if I were just the geekiest kid there?  <br/>
After about twenty minutes, someone spotted and recognized my wristwatch.   <br/>
Bummer.  I was having big sociological fun.   Then when I de-hooded, everyone was ha<br/>
ppy and it had (in retrospect) been fun and amusing for them, because it <br/>
turned out okay.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt kind of did that when he wrote, because though he would say he had <br/>
been a teacher, he didn&#39;t talk about any degrees he might have or what his <br/>
&quot;rank&quot; in the world as a man was, so that the books could be taken on the merit <br/>
of their ideas.  Rough stuff!  Lots of people hesitate at that point, and don&#39;t <br/>
know whether to respect the ideas or reject them unread.<br/>
<br/>
Online writings have an advantage, I think, though, in that way.  We can&#39;t <br/>
see height or beauty of face or limp.  We don&#39;t know who&#39;s poor or rich, whose <br/>
computer is the spiffiest and newest, and who&#39;s limping along on an antique.  <br/>
We can&#39;t tell country club from welfare, or the Mercedes convertible from the <br/>
used Toyota Corolla here, so the unspoken messages of adult society (where you <br/>
live, where you work, what you wear, where you play, what you drive to get <br/>
there) are missing.   <br/>
<br/>
Good ideas will fly and bad ideas will flop.<br/>

will simply say &quot;No, that&#39;s too long&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s too hard for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yuck.  My stomach is having memories.  <br/>
<br/>
When I first quit teaching, I couldn&#39;t even hear a news story on &quot;the state <br/>
of the schools&quot; or anything about schools.  I skipped Newsweek articles and all <br/>
that.  Keith would turn things off if he knew it would stress me.  I was <br/>
really angry and wounded and frustrated for a few years.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m nearly completely over it, but that reminder of how books are chosen gave <br/>
me a momentary jolt of sorrow.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Oh yeah - and those teachers who claim NOT to grade on a curve are<br/>
&gt; frequently being untruthful. They STILL can only give so many &quot;A&#39;s&quot; and<br/>
&gt; so many &quot;B&#39;s&quot; and so on. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But if Kirby&#39;s recent English 101 teacher had graded on the curve, <br/>
&gt; she&#39;d<br/>
&gt; either have given an A (didn&#39;t) or not given four Fs (did).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right - the unwritten rule is you should not give too MANY &quot;A&#39;s&quot; and <br/>
&quot;B&#39;s&quot; - you can give none if you want, nobody complains about grading <br/>
harder than average - they just worry about too many good grades. <br/>
Grading is a filtration system - if you give too many high grades, the <br/>
filters won&#39;t be doing their job - keeping people in their places - <br/>
with only so many A students and so many B students, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t a curve - but it isn&#39;t a system where everybody can earn the <br/>
highest marks, either.<br/>

&quot;If you are not fast enough to leave your class at one end of the<br/>
school, stop at your locker to change books, and make it to the other<br/>
end of the school for your algebra class in 4 minutes, you have no<br/>
