<div id="ygrps-yiv-959441732">&lt;&lt; Of course for the topic of pizza, I have heard so much about authentic New <br/>
York pizza, that it would the pizza chains around here to shame. It must be <br/>
good. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of New Yorkers.  They move away in droves, but they worship <br/>
the food they grew up with.  So bagels are everywhere now, for their <br/>
convenience (and New Yorkers complain here that bakers put green chile in <br/>
some, and blueberries in some, saying that&#39;s not right).  We got a Krispy <br/>
Creme donut shop in New Mexico now, and you&#39;d think the Pope had moved the <br/>
Vatican in.  And White Castle hamburgers are nothing special, but before you <br/>
could buy them frozen, New Yorkers used to buy them out of the back of a <br/>
panel truck, four days old, rather than eat the really good burgers at <br/>
Blake&#39;s or Mac&#39;s, our local chains.<br/>
<br/>
They move to New Mexico because they love the culture and they love the <br/>
openness and they love the people, and then they complain that these Mexicans <br/>
don&#39;t know how to run a school district, these Mexicans don&#39;t know how to <br/>
pick up the garbage, the food here is crummy, why aren&#39;t there more clubs, <br/>
and so around 1981 I lost my sympathy for New Yorkers not getting the food <br/>
they want.  I know where there&#39;s a BUNCH of it--in NYC.  But they don&#39;t want <br/>
to go back there.  They want to change the rest of the country to be more <br/>
like the place they love to hate and hate to leave (in retrospect, I guess).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367676609">Not just New Yorkers.  We have a great influx of Texans and Los Angelites up<br/>
here.  ALWAYS complaining about what they don&#39;t have, the weather, blah,<br/>
blah, blah, etc., etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
I finally got fed up with one woman whose conversations from start to finish<br/>
were all about &quot;well in Texas,&quot; so I said, &quot;Ya know, we live here because we<br/>
like &#39;here,&#39; and if this is such a crummy place, well, the buses run in both<br/>
directions!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And the LaLa Land folks are by far the worst!  &quot;We moved here because we<br/>
thought this would be such a nice place to live and to get our son/daughter<br/>
away from [fill in the blank with gangs, drugs, crime, whatever].&quot;  The<br/>
implication being that it isn&#39;t such a nice place and that we also have<br/>
gangs, drugs, crime, etc.  The problem being that the vast majority of the<br/>
kids getting into trouble or bringing in the drugs are these same kids whose<br/>
parents moved to get them away from the problems.  Hello people, if you kids<br/>
was in trouble with drugs/alcohol/gangs/crime before you moved and they are<br/>
still involved after you move, let&#39;s figure out the common denominator!<br/>
<br/>
We just had a major problem and a kid ended up getting killed.  He moved<br/>
from Louisiana to LA and then here.  Home invasions, armed robberies and<br/>
drug dealings.  He and his twin brother even poured gas on a guy in a<br/>
wheelchair and threatened to set him on fire if he didn&#39;t tell where he kept<br/>
his medical marijuana.  Two weekends in a row he crashed parties carrying a<br/>
gun and beat up a teenage girl.  The weekend before he assaulted a police<br/>
officer.  This time when he came back to the house where he beat up the<br/>
girl, one of the residents shot him. Now his mother is crying about the<br/>
horrible people up here.  I&#39;m sorry her son is dead but sooner or later it<br/>
was going to happen and it had nothing to do with being in town full of<br/>
&quot;stupid Indians and white trash.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which is a long winded way to getting to being sick and tired of folks<br/>
moving somewhere and then complaining about who lived there first and making<br/>
derogatory and frequently racist remarks about the &quot;locals.&quot;  If everything<br/>
was sooooo special where you came from, go back!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520814885">When you are refering to people from New York City, please include the word <br/>
City.  There is a lot more to NY state than the city!!<br/>
As for &quot;back there&quot; being better than where they are living now, I think <br/>
they are viewing the past through rose-colored memories.<br/>
