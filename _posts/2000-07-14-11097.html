<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270885431">Hi everyone,<br/>
I wondered if anyone here knows a resource for Ford F150 truck repair<br/>
questions.  We&#39;ve searched around some but my dh has been struggling with<br/>
fixing his truck for a week now and we&#39;re getting desperate.  Is there<br/>
anyone here that has experience with these trucks?  He&#39;s having problems<br/>
with either the transmission or the clutch but you would have to talk with<br/>
him to get specifics.  Anyone able to help?  Thanks!<br/>
Linda</div>
