<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030544686">I have looked through the archives and cannot find the article on false <br/>
dependency.  It was the one about how children forced into early detachment <br/>
form dependency on peers.  I&#39;m countering a BAD piece of advice from a rabid <br/>
anti-homeschooling person. She is also advocatithat we all get our toddlers <br/>
into pre-school so they can learn to be compassionate.  Yikes!<br/>

that racket for years, and the term &quot;compasionate&quot; would never be used to <br/>
describe taht environment! LOL  Good luck with your fight!<br/>

like this nowadays??????  Wow!<br/>
