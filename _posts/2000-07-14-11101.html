<div id="ygrps-yiv-721277927">This is off-topic, I know, but I know there are a few Pagans on here <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  So this is to let folk know, and to ask if they could pass it <br/>
on...  A friend of mine has a website with listings for Pagan <br/>
childcare providers, www.lytlwytch.com   At least one provider is <br/>
willing to homeschool other people&#39;s children, too.  Please circulate <br/>
this to whomever may benefit from it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
