<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106695351">I&#39;m so sorry this happened, for you and your son.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestion:<br/>
<br/>
There is no way for things to go along like it just never happened.  So talk<br/>
to your son.  Tell him you were wrong, that you are sorry, that you are<br/>
trying to find better ways.<br/>
<br/>
Next, take a close look at what is going on with your son.  Why is he so<br/>
angry with you?  Is it just aimed at you, or is he like this with everyone?<br/>
<br/>
Also, handle your emotions as they come up.  It sounds like perhaps you had<br/>
been biting down your anger at your son&#39;s behavior and then you exploded on<br/>
him.  It is important to remember that NO ONE, not even a child, has the<br/>
right to be abusive to others.  You most assuredly need to not allow him to<br/>
be abusive to you or anyone else.  You have the right and the responsibility<br/>
to not let him demean others.<br/>
<br/>
However, as you know, you do not have the right to slap him.  I do think it<br/>
is fine to tell a child &quot;You are really hurting my feelings when you call me<br/>
&quot;stupid&quot; and I don&#39;t want to play anymore.&quot;  and get up and leave the room.<br/>
Or to tell them &quot;I don&#39;t feel like helping you with this project when you<br/>
are mean to me and saying $#@*& is mean&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to feel like the evil mom for not always being accepting of<br/>
your child&#39;s behavior.  If you wouldn&#39;t want an adult treating you in an<br/>
abusive manner, I see no reason to accept it from a child.  But rather than<br/>
handling it with anger, handle it as something the child is working on,<br/>
learning, figuring out.<br/>
<br/>
There really are consequences to people&#39;s behavior and kids understand that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234177859">You need to walk away when you feel like that. I know where you&#39;re coming from. I used to believe in spanking and still fight the impulse to just hit my kids. It&#39;s hard, It&#39;s hard, it&#39;s hard. It&#39;s also not his problem. Do some reading on natural parenting and positive discipline to give yourself strategies for the times when he gets snarky. Suggest (actually, don&#39;t suggest, tell. Esp. if his behaviour will make you violent) at those times that he go to his room for quiet time. Let him take whatever toys or books he wants and you can both &#39;chill out&#39;. But...don&#39;t forget that what really needs work right now is the impulse to hit because even if you help him through this bad bit of behaviour there will be something else, there always is.  <br/>

There are links to other ideas and various related things, collected from <br/>
lots of unschoolers and a few internet links to &quot;outside&quot; sources of info.<br/>
<br/>
My first thought was whether he WANTS to be home.  We don&#39;t talk about it <br/>
much in homschooling circles, but keeping kids home against their will can cause <br/>
some of the same problems sending them to school against their will causes:  <br/>
powerlessness and frustration.<br/>
<br/>
Who&#39;s he hanging out with?  Do you and your husband spar verbally and put <br/>
each other down for fun?  Little kids can&#39;t at first tell sarcasm and humor from <br/>
meanness, and they&#39;re imitative.   <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s probably at the age and size that others who see him will know he&#39;s not <br/>
at school, and if he&#39;s getting negative messages which aren&#39;t being <br/>
counter-balanced by positive, happy messages he might be feeling smaller than he  needs <br/>
to feel.<br/>
<br/>
I think you should get him out of the house, preferably out into nature, <br/>
walk, be with him in fresh air, apologize, ask him how he&#39;s feeling (but don&#39;t <br/>
press it so far that he never wants to go for a walk with you again, and he MIGHT <br/>
not want to talk about it) and talk about how you want things to be between <br/>
you and him, and what you are willing to do to to help it get there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053860040">Hi Shan, this may not be the most popular response but, I have to tell you <br/>
that you need to allow yourself a bit of levity here. In the wild animals <br/>
regularly show, not tell, their young that certain specific behaviors are absolutely <br/>
not to be tolerated. This type of corporal punishment, in the animal world, <br/>
is typically very judiciously applied and so, when it does occur there is a <br/>
real and abrupt awakening in the young which enables them to immediately cue in <br/>
on the importance of the message being delivered by the parent.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I don&#39;t have information about &#39;how&#39; you slapped your child. This <br/>
has bearing to the situation because loss of control is a warning to you and to <br/>
your child that the situation leading up to the physical altercation is not <br/>
working. Read that again, the situation leading up to the physical <br/>
altercation..... not the moment itself. I have seen children raised successfully with and <br/>
without corporal punishment and I have seen the opposite. It boils down to <br/>
that some people require a more direct and obvious form of attention getting from <br/>
the parent on occasion and others are fine without a physical reminder of <br/>
appropriate behavior. <br/>
<br/>
Proponents of absolutely NO corporal punishment are the same as any other <br/>
fringe group-if the condition works for them great. But, if it isn&#39;t working for <br/>
you then you need to adjust and be okay with your adjustments regardless of <br/>
how the fringe wishes to justify their own training methods and how people, as a <br/>
species wants to justify their actions at another&#39;s expense. <br/>
<br/>
If you feel that you did lose control and the action on your part was overly <br/>
severe then an apology to your child is in order.  With a caveat. He must know <br/>
that his actions have consequences and even parents have limitations. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-379604282">First thing: apologize.  <br/>
<br/>
Have you told him before that his way of treating you<br/>
was bothering you, or did you let it go on til you got<br/>
frustrated?<br/>
<br/>
My son had a phase where he talked to me very<br/>
disrepectfully and smart alecky, and I did a few<br/>
different things.  One, when I was in a good mood, I<br/>
would respond back in kind, jokingly, not mean<br/>
sarcastic, but mirroring back how ridiculous and<br/>
obnoxious he was sounding.  We would end up laughing<br/>
and joking around.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 If I was stressed or hungry or tired, and he pulled<br/>
that, I would tell him straight out, and he could tell<br/>
I was mad, but in control, that I didn&#39;t appreciate<br/>
him speaking to me that way and that he should go do<br/>
something else.  I put a stop to it so that I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
lose my temper, but at that point I think he also knew<br/>
that my anger was justified.  <br/>
<br/>
I also tried this, depeneding on the situation, like<br/>
if he seemed ready to listen for a minute.  I would<br/>
tell him that it hurt my feelings to be spoken to that<br/>
way, and that I was getting angry. I would explain to<br/>
him that anger is a response to having my feelings<br/>
hurt, and that when I was angry, it was because I<br/>
thought he was being hurtful and mean.  Most of the<br/>
time what worked was asking him if I ever talked to<br/>
him that way, and then I would walk away to let him<br/>
think about that.  <br/>
<br/>
This lasted for about three months. I remember him<br/>
being six, and it happened then too, but not as bad. <br/>
8, last year, wasn&#39;t fun either.  I&#39;ve wondered where<br/>
it comes from and I think it&#39;s a independence thing,<br/>
and also a developmental pushing limits thing, as<br/>
well.  He probably doesn&#39;t do this with anyone but<br/>
you?  My husband would step in occasionally with a<br/>
comment about how treating your mother badly was mean,<br/>
etc, and that helped some.<br/>
<br/>
  He didn&#39;t treat anyone else this way, and so I had<br/>
to look at my behavior and treatment of him and make<br/>
sure I wasn&#39;t contributing to the problem, like not<br/>
listening to him or paying attention, and forcing him<br/>
to be negative to get my attention. <br/>

to your son.  Tell him you were wrong, that you are sorry, that you are<br/>
trying to find better ways.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
[Shan replies:] That is exactly what I did as soon as I finished writing the<br/>
first time.  I cried and told him how sorry I was that I hit him and hitting<br/>
is NOT OK.  He was still very angry.  But soon calmed down after I<br/>
apologized.  I told him I feel like I am not being a good mom right now.  I<br/>
cant be a good mom when I feel like he is always angry and talking mean to<br/>
me.  I asked him if there is something that I could do to help him change<br/>
the way he feels and talks.  He didnt really know what I was talking about.<br/>
Remember he is 6.  I tried to put it in as simple of terms as possible.  So<br/>
what I am going to do is try to do more outdoorsy things.  He is such a<br/>
homebody that it is really hard to get him to go anywhere.  But I think it<br/>
may help him if we get out more.  who knows.  But its worth a try.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Next, take a close look at what is going on with your son.  Why is he so<br/>
angry with you?  Is it just aimed at you, or is he like this with everyone?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
now this is a hard one.  He is like this with everyone.  Its not just me.<br/>
I/we (dh) tell him that the way he speaks to people is not acceptable.  This<br/>
is an ongoing thing in our house.  His tone and word selection is just<br/>
grates on my and my dh nerves.  Weve joked with him.  Weve been stern with<br/>
him.  And then, today Ive been mean (wrong) with him.  Actually since this<br/>
happened this morning, things have been so much better.  I think he may get<br/>
it.  At least I hope he does.  I hope this isnt a temporary thing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, handle your emotions as they come up.  It sounds like perhaps you had<br/>

right to be abusive to others.  You most assuredly need to not allow him to<br/>
be abusive to you or anyone else.  You have the right and the responsibility<br/>
to not let him demean others.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As I stated above, I do tell ds that the way he talks to me and others hurts<br/>
our feelings.  People dont like to be talked to like that even if he is<br/>
joking.  It surely doesnt sound like a joke when your feelings are hurt.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;However, as you know, you do not have the right to slap him.  I do think it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is fine to tell a child &quot;You are really hurting my feelings when you call me<br/>

Or to tell them &quot;I don&#39;t feel like helping you with this project when you<br/>
are mean to me and saying $#@*& is mean&quot;.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know I dont have any right to slap him.  I feel like such a loser right<br/>
now.  I cant believe it has come to this.  ds personality is such that he<br/>
whenever Ive put my foot down and left the game or room or whatever the<br/>
case was, he just feels SO rejected and falls completely apart in a huge<br/>
raging screaming fit until I or dh come back to the room.  So this method<br/>
certainly doesnt work with him.  I guess Im going to have to find a better<br/>
way of talking to him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am sure she is. Thank you for your clarification of her needs. However, <br/>
unless humans first and foremost acknowledge their inherent animal nature they <br/>
are more likely to repeat behaviors strictly because they do not understand the <br/>
origin of the behavior itself. Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Beyond this, <br/>
however, many accept that there is no circumstance for utilizing physical <br/>
restraints or other training aides that involve the use of the body. I believe <br/>
that if one allows this type of one sided belief system to rule their opining <br/>
then they are at serious risk themselves for not utilizing all and every <br/>
considerable tool in their repetoir at appropriate times. The duplicity encourages a <br/>
guilt response in the parent that is not in service with the ultimate needs of <br/>
the parent child relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, your statements above, while I am sure are held very strongly <br/>
by you, are somewhat taken out of context of the complete message which I was <br/>
attempting to explore with Shan. I hope you reread it for context. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, though you assert that Shan is hoping for a certain type of support, <br/>
only she can sufficiently judge, and therefore learn, what is most effective <br/>
for her and her family by reviewing all opinions and suggestions allowing her <br/>
to come to her own internally enlightened choice.<br/>

[Shan replies:]  His only friends in the neighborhood are two boys that used to homeschool until this year.  Now that they go to school, he doesn’t have anybody until after school.  These boys’ parents are rough to say the least.  They spank, cus, smoke and are generally hicks.  They are nice enough people, but I tend to rather have their boys over our house.  We’ve noticed that whenever Connor goes over to their house, he comes back in a really grumpy mood.  I don’t know what goes on over there.  I’ve asked, and he tells me that they play Nintendo, play outside and do normal kids things.  Nothing really strikes me as odd.  But darned if he doesn’t come home in a really bad mood every time.<br/>

on the importance of the message being delivered by the parent.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I don&#39;t have information about &#39;how&#39; you slapped your child. This<br/>
has bearing to the situation because loss of control is a warning to you and<br/>
to<br/>
your child that the situation leading up to the physical altercation is not<br/>
working. Read that again, the situation leading up to the physical<br/>
altercation..... not the moment itself. I have seen children raised<br/>
successfully with and<br/>
without corporal punishment and I have seen the opposite. It boils down to<br/>
that some people require a more direct and obvious form of attention getting<br/>
from<br/>
the parent on occasion and others are fine without a physical reminder of<br/>
appropriate behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Proponents of absolutely NO corporal punishment are the same as any other<br/>
fringe group-if the condition works for them great. But, if it isn&#39;t working<br/>
for<br/>
you then you need to adjust and be okay with your adjustments regardless of<br/>
how the fringe wishes to justify their own training methods and how people,<br/>
as a<br/>
species wants to justify their actions at another&#39;s expense.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel that you did lose control and the action on your part was overly<br/>
severe then an apology to your child is in order.  With a caveat. He must<br/>
know<br/>
that his actions have consequences and even parents have limitations.<br/>
<br/>

[Shan replies:]  I don&#39;t believe in spanking, but was spanked as a child.<br/>
So I know it is in there and I fight the urge when he gets like this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Suggest (actually, don&#39;t suggest, tell. Esp. if his behaviour will make you<br/>

whatever toys or books he wants and you can both &#39;chill out&#39;. But...don&#39;t<br/>
forget that what really needs work right now is the impulse to hit because<br/>
even if you help him through this bad bit of behaviour there will be<br/>
something else, there always is.&gt;<br/>
[Shan replies:] I think I said in another response, that Connor takes this<br/>
sort of thing as a personal insult and absolutely gets irate and throws a<br/>
huge fit if I try to do anything of this sort.  I think I need other ways of<br/>
dealing with him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>was bothering you, or did you let it go on til you got<br/>
frustrated?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I&#39;ve told him many times before that it bothers me.  Actually, dh and I<br/>
both have iterated it many times.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My son had a phase where he talked to me very<br/>
 </span></blockquote>disrepectfully and smart alecky, and I did a few<br/>
different things.  One, when I was in a good mood, I<br/>
would respond back in kind, jokingly, not mean<br/>
sarcastic, but mirroring back how ridiculous and<br/>
obnoxious he was sounding.  We would end up laughing<br/>
and joking around.  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done this and it ends up in a big fight because he doesn&#39;t like it when<br/>
people talk to him like that.  But it does absolutely NO good for him in the<br/>
sense that he changes the way he acts in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If I was stressed or hungry or tired, and he pulled<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that, I would tell him straight out, and he could tell<br/>
I was mad, but in control, that I didn&#39;t appreciate<br/>
him speaking to me that way and that he should go do<br/>
something else.  I put a stop to it so that I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
lose my temper, but at that point I think he also knew<br/>
that my anger was justified.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done this too and again to no avail.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I also tried this, depeneding on the situation, like<br/>
 </span></blockquote>if he seemed ready to listen for a minute.  I would<br/>
tell him that it hurt my feelings to be spoken to that<br/>
way, and that I was getting angry. I would explain to<br/>
him that anger is a response to having my feelings<br/>
hurt, and that when I was angry, it was because I<br/>
thought he was being hurtful and mean.  Most of the<br/>
time what worked was asking him if I ever talked to<br/>
him that way, and then I would walk away to let him<br/>
think about that.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I could try this.  usually though when I try to bring up a situation<br/>
that he is uncomfortable with, he just says he doesn&#39;t want to talk about<br/>
it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115440166">Thanks Pam,<br/>
This is exactly what I am after.  In fact, I&#39;ve subbed to your no spanking<br/>
list to see if I can get more helpful ideas there.  I haven&#39;t introduced<br/>
myself yet.  Hopefully I&#39;ll find the time to do that today.<br/>
<br/>
Shan<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think Shan is hoping to find support for behaving a bit better than a<br/>
wild animal.<br/>
An appropriate comparison, though, in my opinion, because that urge to<br/>
strike out is a &quot;reversion&quot; and a less-than-civilized response.<br/>
<br/>
The question is twofold: (1) how to resist the urge to strike our child<br/>
when it DOES arise and (2) how to avoid situations where the urge is<br/>
likely to arise.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031703181">&lt;&lt;I know I don&#39;t have any right to slap him.  I feel like such a loser right<br/>
now.  I can&#39;t believe it has come to this.  ds&#39; personality is such that he<br/>
whenever I&#39;ve put my foot down and left the game or room or whatever the<br/>
case was, he just feels SO rejected and falls completely apart in a huge<br/>
raging screaming fit until I or dh come back to the room.  So this method<br/>
certainly doesn&#39;t work with him.  I guess I&#39;m going to have to find a better<br/>
way of talking to him.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Shan, if you were really a loser, you wouldn&#39;t be trying to change for the<br/>
better, and instead would be trying to justify hitting to yourself and<br/>
others. You aren&#39;t a loser, although you do feel lousy.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
On those occasions when Jayn (4) has a crying rage fit - many would call it<br/>
a tantrum - because I just can&#39;t stay awake anymore or have to leave the<br/>
room because I feel angry, we just try to ride it out. I usually acknowledge<br/>
her anger along the lines of &quot;I see that you are upset that I am going to<br/>
bed. You want me to stay out here with you.&quot; Then I explain my position,<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m too sleepy to stay awake, so I&#39;m going to the bedroom&quot;. Then I give her<br/>
some suggestions of choices, &quot;You can stay out here and watch Max and Ruby,<br/>
but I won&#39;t be coming out to put it on again because I will be sleeping. You<br/>
can watch cartoons by yourself out here, or you can come in to the bedroom<br/>
with us and watch cartoons or a dvd.&quot; Then I go. My experience is that she<br/>
follows quickly. In this example my goal is just to get to bed myself, so it<br/>
may be a bit far from your situation.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My point is that I continue with the process regardless of Jayn&#39;s crying.<br/>
Sometimes she tries to talk through her tears, and I say to her, &quot;I can&#39;t<br/>
understand what you are saying. Will you say it again?&quot; She often tries to<br/>
calm herself enough to speak clearly enough to be comprehended. (Naturally I<br/>
only tell her the truth about whether I can understand her or not - it is<br/>
not a manipulation) We save broader discussions about behavior, like &quot;saying<br/>
mean things&quot; for times when we are all calm.<br/>

If you stop thinking of the way he&#39;s talking as a deliberate meanness,<br/>

Can he sleep with you at night?  Maybe hug him more, spend more time with<br/>

***************************************<br/>
Shan - I have a foster son who was totally out of control in the same way you <br/>
describe.  Very hurtful, rude, disrespectful talk.  When he would calm down a <br/>
little, enough to listen, I would say, VERY FIRMLY, &quot;You hurt me when you <br/>
talk to me like that.  I don&#39;t talk this way to you because I know how it would <br/>
feel.  I don&#39;t deserve to be spoken to this way, so if you choose to continue, <br/>
I will not listen to you.  When you decide to talk nicely, I&#39;ll listen.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Then I would &quot;quit&quot; listening and responding to his barrage of insults and <br/>
profanity.  As soon as the tone changed, I&#39;d respond.  <br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t work overnight, but I&#39;d say after about a week or so the number of <br/>
times it happened slowed, and then stopped.  None of the kids speak to me that <br/>
way now.<br/>

Well, that&#39;s why you walk away.  My son always feels<br/>
very guilty, afterwards, and then doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
talk, either.  <br/>
Not shame, guilt.  And I dont&#39; interfere with that<br/>
feeling, because it&#39;s a natural reaction.<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s tough for them to really *feel* what they&#39;ve<br/>
done, just like you feel bad for slapping him. But<br/>
maybe he&#39;s gotta sit with that feeling for a while,<br/>
because he created the situation.  <br/>
<br/>
The tantrums that you mentioned when you walk out of<br/>
the room, I would leave him to it.  When he calms<br/>
down, if he does without your interference,that may<br/>
help him process his feelings.  <br/>
<br/>
Man, this is so hard without knowing him, but I tried.<br/>

<br/>
Caitlin is 10 and she can make me hollerin mad and I get the urge to strike out.  Like the other night she was piling too much food on her plate (I should have let her) and I was afraid I didn&#39;t have enough for everyone, she slammed the food back in the pot.  I nudged her shoulder harder than I should have probably and told her to stop.  That old stuff.  Anyway I try to tell them now, like today in the car they were fighting and I said outloud that these were the times that made me feel angry myself.... and they quieted down.  It is hard to get rid of old things... practice practice.  and loving and apologizing.  Stepheny<br/>

  Shan - I have a foster son who was totally out of control in the same way you <br/>
  describe.  Very hurtful, rude, disrespectful talk.  When he would calm down a <br/>
  little, enough to listen, I would say, VERY FIRMLY, &quot;You hurt me when you <br/>
  talk to me like that.  I don&#39;t talk this way to you because I know how it would <br/>
  feel.  I don&#39;t deserve to be spoken to this way, so if you choose to continue, <br/>
  I will not listen to you.  When you decide to talk nicely, I&#39;ll listen.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
  Then I would &quot;quit&quot; listening and responding to his barrage of insults and <br/>
  profanity.  As soon as the tone changed, I&#39;d respond.  <br/>
<br/>
  Didn&#39;t work overnight, but I&#39;d say after about a week or so the number of <br/>
  times it happened slowed, and then stopped.  None of the kids speak to me that <br/>
  way now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020764986">Hi Shan, my son is almost 13 and still has problems with tone of <br/>
voice. Most family and friends felt he was mean at times and ugly <br/>
sounding during those early years. I&#39;ve always wanted him to have <br/>
emotional freedom so I&#39;ve tried really hard not to ding him for <br/>
coming across as disrespectful when I knew he was just frustrated and <br/>
angry. Many times he is (still) moody because of his allergies. I&#39;ve <br/>
taken alot of crap for treating him as equally as I treat other <br/>
adults! :)  It&#39;s amazing how intolerent our society is towards <br/>
children and their emotions.<br/>
<br/>
Your 6yo may not realize how important language and tone of voice is. <br/>
Few do! It took my son until he was about 8 to understand it. I just <br/>
kept asking him if he wanted us to talk to him the way he did us. <br/>
That didn&#39;t help much so finally I recorded him once and played it <br/>
back to him. He was stunned and tried to say &quot;that wasn&#39;t me&quot;. It <br/>
helped and to this day when I still have ask him to change his tone <br/>
he&#39;ll say &quot;I don&#39;t mean to sound that awful&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve had many discussions about how people will be turned-off by <br/>
this habit(?) of his. But,...I think it IS part of his personality <br/>
and I hurt for him when it crops up. As he has gotten older...when he <br/>
starts, I immediately ask him if I have done something to anger him. <br/>
When he says no, I ask him not to continue with the tone. That ticks <br/>
him off but after hethinks about it, he&#39;ll apologize on his own. We <br/>
still discuss anger displacement and how that affects him and his <br/>
family and friends. Actually this is one of the reasons I homeschool. <br/>
<br/>
My mother told me a few years ago when I was lamenting this behavior <br/>
for the umpteenth time, &quot;it&#39;s not anything you have done sweetie, he <br/>
was born that way, quit beating yourself up for it!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So...you aren&#39;t a bad parent Shan or you sure wouldn&#39;t be talking <br/>
about it here! Do you think it&#39;s just a part of his personality? Hang <br/>
in there...Sara</div>

<br/>
As one of the list owners, Pam&#39;s certainly entitled to help guide the list <br/>
toward the tone she thinks will best help people get to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Even if she were not &quot;personnel,&quot; she&#39;d have the right to express her <br/>
opinion, just as everyone does.<br/>
<br/>
People do have instincts, and part of culture is deciding which instincts to <br/>
go with and which to withstand.   Different cultures honor or revile different <br/>
instincts.  The culture we&#39;re in now has gone through a long ugly period of <br/>
discouraging ANYTHING biological, including breastfeeding.  Sleeping with one&#39;s <br/>
own children has been treated practically as child abuse, which is crazy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that people here are divorced from their animal nature.   There are <br/>
some things that create a warmer relationship, and some that don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; for offspring to leave or at lest stop caring so much what <br/>
their parents want them to do once they&#39;re old enough to reproduce.  This culture <br/>
does NOT allow a thirteen or fourteen year old to just walk away.   So <br/>
cultural tools for extending a working relationship between parents and children are <br/>
Very Good Things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Beyond this, <br/>
however, many accept that there is no circumstance for utilizing physical <br/>
restraints or other training aides that involve the use of the body. I <br/>
believe <br/>
that if one allows this type of one sided belief system to rule their opining <br/>
then they are at serious risk themselves for not utilizing all and every <br/>
considerable tool in their repetoir at appropriate times.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Big words aren&#39;t always best.  &quot;Repertoire&quot; is the word you were looking for, <br/>
and though hitting is a &quot;considerable tool&quot; in the face of assault or threat <br/>
to our children&#39;s safety, if a parent can&#39;t control her own childish urge to <br/>
hit just because her feelings are hurt, that teaches the child that it&#39;s okay <br/>
to hit when his feelings are hurt.   That is not a good lesson to teach on a <br/>
planet where one species is smart enough to know that there are six billion+ of <br/>
their kind.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to dazzle people with baffling terms, tell stories of your <br/>
own personal experiences with unschooling and with your own children.<br/>

<br/>
What goes around, comes around...Do unto others...the Karma wheel..<br/>
<br/>
My life priciple is that if I don&#39;t want it done to me, I try not to <br/>
do it to others. (I&#39;m not perfect and have of course made mistakes. <br/>
But I try REAL hard.) Since I would be devastated if my husband, <br/>
friend or a police officer decided to smack me because they didn&#39;t <br/>
like my behavior, I will NOT turn around and smack someone else. <br/>
(That&#39;s of course in addition to all the other internal reasons I <br/>
have for not physically hurting another being.)<br/>
<br/>
If I need to restrain my child, I try to do it with love because it <br/>
means she is out of control and needs me to be the adult. <br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t think of my kids as animals that need &quot;training aides.&quot; I <br/>
don&#39;t train them. I live with them, help them, guide them, love them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I believe that if one allows this type of one sided belief system <br/>

<br/>
People used to think that the best tool to use with a child was a <br/>
paddle, belt or switch. That doesn&#39;t make it right.<br/>
<br/>
There has NEVER been a difficult situation with my child where I have <br/>
looked back and thought &quot;Gee, if only I&#39;d thought to smack her. That <br/>
would have been a better response.&quot; NEVER.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;The duplicity encourages a guilt response in the parent that is not <br/>
 </span></blockquote>in service with the ultimate needs of the parent child relationship.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The guilt is a self-inflicted emotion to a less than acceptable <br/>
action towards another human being. But I don&#39;t believe in hanging on <br/>
to guilt. It&#39;s useless. Much better to do as Shannon has done :-)<br/>
and move forward towards a better next response. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-950294312">Shan --<br/>
<br/>
I have two books I&#39;d recommend for you. First is &quot;I Can Problem Solve: <br/>
An Intergenerational Cognitive Problem-Solving Program&quot; by Myrna Shure. <br/>
She has several books and at least one workbook - look for the one that <br/>
is aimed at kids your son&#39;s age. The reason I recommend this is that it <br/>
is FAR more effective to help him learn to express himself in <br/>
productive ways than it is to try to stop him from expressing himself <br/>
in problematic ways. Just like it is much more effective to tell kids <br/>
&quot;Please walk&quot; than &quot;Don&#39;t run&quot; - it puts what you want them to DO in <br/>
their head instead of just what you don&#39;t want, it is going to be a lot <br/>
more effective if you can focus on your son&#39;s effective communication, <br/>
rather than on the aspects you&#39;re not happy with. Myrna Shure&#39;s <br/>
approach is very effective - she helps parents help kids learn the <br/>
vocabulary of feelings - and how to expresss themselves in <br/>
solution-oriented ways.  There are games and puppet play and stuff like <br/>
that to use - but even if you didn&#39;t DO all that, just reading her book <br/>
will give you tremendous insight into helping kids who are having <br/>
trouble communicating effectively.<br/>
<br/>
The other book is &quot;How to Talk So Kids will Listen and Listen so Kids <br/>
will Talk&quot; -- I think you&#39;ll feel a lot more in control of yourself if <br/>
you have some predetermined responses like this book can offer. You, at <br/>
first, might even look FORWARD to him behave badly so that you can try <br/>
out some of your new ideas and see how they work. I&#39;ve seen some pretty <br/>
amazing and almost immediate changes happen when people tried out <br/>
things from this book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-290552045">Thank you for encouraging us all to recall our own experiences and to express <br/>
them for the benefit of this community. As I stated I anticipated this to be <br/>
an unpopular opinion and I am not disappointed. I don&#39;t need to justify my <br/>
system to you and more than you need to justify your system to me. What works in <br/>
the training of one individual to become a functional and stable human being <br/>
may not in fact be the most functional for another. It may be that individuals <br/>
are adamantly opposed to using physical forms of correction, but, that doesn&#39;t <br/>
negate the truth that some individuals will respond best to that training <br/>
method.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am certain that those persons who sub to this list are functionally capable <br/>
of addressing their own language skills and abundantly capable of addressing <br/>
their own parenting styles and sifting through what patterns they are <br/>
comfortable with expressing and acknowledging. I appreciate that Shan is <br/>
anti-physical. She will no doubt find little in what I have said helpful to her situation <br/>
at present. That in and of itself doesn&#39;t invalidate a method that is function <br/>
for me over a method that is apparently nonfunctional (by her own assertion) <br/>
to her. Now that I understand that of Her I won&#39;t suggest to her future methods <br/>
that I now know she personally will find disturbing. Perhaps someday this may <br/>
change. Perhaps not.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I agree with you that many of our brethren in humanity have lost contact <br/>
with their animal nature. I see also that we are at odds with the benefit of <br/>
this condition. I strongly believe that losing our animal nature is false and <br/>
often detrimental for society. When one holds themselves above their base <br/>
nature then how can they gain an understanding of that which drives their <br/>
reactions towards the training of their children.<br/>
<br/>
Understanding is the key. I am not certain what point you are making with <br/>
your comments about thirteen and fourteen year olds walking away from their <br/>
parents. I am certain however, that the current politics involved with limited <br/>
acceptance of breast feeding and the use of a family bed being child abusive are <br/>
as equally misinterpreted as appropriate physical restraint can be when it is <br/>
applied judiciously and without rage or malice. Its abundantly clear that <br/>
because YOU consider this training tool inappropriate that you and those who <br/>
support your system will be particularly partisan with regard to this specific <br/>
aspect of &#39;biological&#39; methodology.<br/>
<br/>
Its unfortunately a hind site type of method. One can never be truly certain <br/>
of the impact or lack of impact until the future woulda-coulda-shoulda is <br/>
presented.<br/>
<br/>
Also, though I appreciate your editing my grammar and spelling, please in the <br/>
future be as attentive of your own posts as you are to mine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
 Tracey<br/>

It was trained and accepted and completely human behaviour. What I attribute to my animal nature is the enveloping bond I felt while breastfeeding, the soothing pleasure of stroking my childrens skin, the unspoken cues from both that I can understand and respond to. Nevermind that there is no common animal nature but only human nature as there is such a huge varience in how different species act. There are no hard and fast animal rules.<br/>
      Attributing human acts to animal nature seems to me to be a fatalistic view of things and a complete repudiation (hows that for a big word! :) ) of the free will that&#39;s supposed to be part of being human. <br/>
      And....(rambling on I go) seeing spanking as part of the tools a parent uses seems a little strange to me as most times (as in my case) its used by parents who only have that one &#39;parenting&#39; tool. As I learned and read about parenting and got more tools, I did not need to spank. Not to say that the urge ever disappeared. But, now that I&#39;ve got more tools, there&#39;s no room for spanking.<br/>
      Official end of rant.<br/>

Well, that&#39;s why you walk away.  My son always feels<br/>
very guilty, afterwards, and then doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
talk, either.<br/>
Not shame, guilt.  And I dont&#39; interfere with that<br/>
feeling, because it&#39;s a natural reaction.<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s tough for them to really *feel* what they&#39;ve<br/>
done, just like you feel bad for slapping him. But<br/>
maybe he&#39;s gotta sit with that feeling for a while,<br/>
because he created the situation.<br/>
<br/>
The tantrums that you mentioned when you walk out of<br/>
the room, I would leave him to it.  When he calms<br/>
down, if he does without your interference,that may<br/>
help him process his feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Man, this is so hard without knowing him, but I tried.<br/>
;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a very big difference, to me, between &quot;physical restraint&quot; <br/>
and corporal punishment.  Doesn&#39;t corporal punishment essentially <br/>
mean to punish by inflicting pain or bodily harm?  That&#39;s not <br/>
interchangeable with physical restraint.<br/>
I&#39;ve physically restrained my toddlers from running in the road, or <br/>
from hurting people or damaging things during tantrums.  <br/>
That&#39;s not corporal punishment.  It&#39;s not even &quot;training,&quot; it&#39;s <br/>
protecting.  Corporal punishment is the opposite of protecting IMO.<br/>
