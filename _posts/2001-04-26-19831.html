&gt;kids at a park and reading on a bench.  Another mom<br/>
&gt;came up with her kids, I set my book down and talked<br/>
&gt;with her.  If I&#39;m parked in my living room in front<br/>
&gt;of my TV, I don&#39;t have the opportunity for social<br/>

conversation started too.  How many of you have been<br/>
approached by strangers who have read the book you are<br/>
readin, or want to read it, or like the author?  I<br/>
know I have.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, for everyone who was concerned about my<br/>
health.  A little investigation determined that I have<br/>
some kind of infection in my throat (white spots) but<br/>
not in the proper pattern to be strep.  I am taking<br/>
something for it, and hopefully will have it cleared <br/>
up soon.  I just began taking it this morning, after a<br/>
pretty rough night.  Still in a fair amount of pain,<br/>
but hoping that will be over soon.<br/>

particularly looking at Malcolm in the Middle. First, the parents are <br/>
probably the most romantic couple I&#39;ve ever seen on tv. They so clearly adore <br/>
each other.  I found the episode where they explained how they all &quot;got that <br/>
way&quot; amazing.  And I have to admit they give those kids a LOT of latitude. <br/>
Because I think Reece might be truly evil.  ;)<br/>

You mentioned your kids watch less TV as they got older. When your kids were <br/>
5 years old and if they wanted to sit and watch all the shows on TV back to <br/>
back without ever getting up day in and day out, would you let them? Would <br/>
you spend your entire day in their world in front of the toob because they <br/>
were &quot;learning&quot; something and you wanted to be available to chat about the <br/>
shows? My guy picks a movie over visiting with friends, a bike ride, most <br/>
any other activity. He is passionate about it. I get unnerved, in a bad mood <br/>
and plain grumpy when he has his TV or die mood. By establishing clear <br/>
limits with him, allowing him to schedule when he will watch TV and what has <br/>
reduced our friction over this issue. He gets to watch and I know when it <br/>
will be and can plan my activities. If I&#39;m interested in his choice, I&#39;ll <br/>
watch along. If it is Barney sings again, I&#39;ll do something else.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree watching with the children is a great connecting experience. We <br/>
do this. We all get movies from the library and watch together. There are <br/>
lots of neat things out their on video. Disney Saturday morning does not <br/>
thrill me, though. Should I fake it? Should I sit and watch instead of make <br/>
some yummy food from scratch? I loss interest when  I&#39;m watching Clifford <br/>
again for the 100th time.<br/>
<br/>
I find all things can be learning experiences, yet some things can become <br/>
dangerous/unsafe. Blocks are great fun, but thrown at a sibling can not <br/>
happen because it may hurt someone. This internet is fantastic, yet easy to <br/>
spend too much time on. I look at my son&#39;s glazed over expression and <br/>
wonder, is this TV media unsafe for him. He looks kind of ill, totally zoned <br/>
out, not really &quot;there&quot;. Looks like a stoned teenager. You can not stand in <br/>
the way of the TV or he freaks out. His baby sister can not turn it off <br/>
without an explosion from him. This state of his is extreme. My 2 girls can <br/>
sit and watch no problem. You can ask them a question and they respond. You <br/>
can get them to go to the park before the movie finishes. They may or may <br/>
not finish the movie. Oh, I do trust he will be O.K., he is still so young, <br/>
simple clear limits seem to work for us now.<br/>
<br/>
Mary<br/>
Sorry this got so long, I guess I am passionate about the TV too, in that I <br/>
do not care for it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; . When your kids were <br/>
&gt; 5 years old and if they wanted to sit and watch all the shows on TV back to <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would have, but that never happened.<br/>
<br/>
The only time I can see that happening would be in a family in which TV had <br/>
been limited, and it had just been opened up.  The kids might binge for a <br/>
week or two, especially if from experience they figured the mom didn&#39;t REALLY <br/>
mean it was freely available from now on, but that the offer would be <br/>
withdrawn.<br/>
<br/>
Since the TV was just one of many things, since they were born, it wasn&#39;t <br/>
special or magic or the focus of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was five he got a Nintendo.  He would play Mario for hours at a <br/>
time, sometimes.  I could see by his eyes that he was thinking up a storm.  <br/>
We got him the player&#39;s guide, and subscribed to Nintendo Power, before he <br/>
could read.  He learned to follow maps from that, and he learned deductive <br/>
reasoning, because on the bonus screen on that first Mario game, there are <br/>
only eight different arrays, and they were shown in the player&#39;s guide.  I <br/>
would help him, at first, to make a good choice, eliminating some of the <br/>
arrangements with each guess.  They only allow two mistakes, or you don&#39;t get <br/>
the bonus.  Soon he could do it on his own, ALWAYS getting the bonus, and so <br/>
getting to more difficult levels of the game.  And he taught the neighbors <br/>
deduction and the process of elimination with that chart.<br/>
<br/>
By keeping his issues all in order and ordering the index, when he was eight <br/>
and had learned to read from those Nintendo resources, he learned to use an <br/>
index to look things up.  A couple of times, he gave a friend a Nintendo game <br/>
for a gift, and he would make a little folder with photocopies of all the <br/>
articles about that game which had appeared in Nintendo Power, and the <br/>
&quot;cheats&quot; which appeared after the game came out, because the index allowed <br/>
him to find all those references.<br/>
<br/>
The index was set up  Issue#:page  (like 35:14).  Knowing that, he will <br/>
immediately understand how a Bible concordance works, and how references in <br/>
Shakespeare work.<br/>
<br/>
So that was one trail his unlimited TV use followed.<br/>
<br/>
We recorded Sesame Street a lot when he was young, and would move the best <br/>
parts to a &quot;Best of&quot; tape.  We still have that tape, and it&#39;s six hours of <br/>
some of the best Sesame Street bits--art, animation, songs, guests.  Holly <br/>
was watching it just a month ago; it&#39;s ten years old.<br/>
<br/>
Marty loved the movie Dumbo.  He watched it every single day for weeks.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t have to stay with him after he had it memorized.  And while he watched <br/>
sometimes he just sat (he&#39;s our introvert) and sometimes he played with toys, <br/>
or drew.  <br/>
<br/>
Our TV then was in the room next to the kitchen.  We put a table in there so <br/>
the kids could eat in front of the TV (the house was tiny), and so I&#39;d do <br/>
food prep, or my own writing or whatever, at that table so I&#39;d be where the <br/>
kids were.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Would <br/>
you spend your entire day in their world in front of the toob because they <br/>
were &quot;learning&quot; something and you wanted to be available to chat about the <br/>
shows? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By putting &quot;learning&quot; in quotation marks, do you mean to say you doubt that <br/>
they were learning?   By spelling it &quot;toob&quot; do you really intend for your <br/>
bias to be obvious?  Some people write without a careful awareness of the <br/>
unintentional messages, but some are clear on what they&#39;re communicating, and <br/>
if that is true of you, then the question as worded above has a strong <br/>
sarcasm to it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My guy picks a movie over visiting with friends, a bike ride, most <br/>
any other activity. He is passionate about it. I get unnerved, in a bad mood <br/>
and plain grumpy when he has his TV or die mood. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he doesn&#39;t like his friends much, and is tired of riding his bike in <br/>
the same old places.  Maybe he wants to think about the world, and how people <br/>
interact, and how language can be art, and how cinematography and a good <br/>
soundtrack can be transporting.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re in a bad mood because YOU don&#39;t like what he&#39;s doing, that might be <br/>
a matter for your self introspection.   If he is passionate about it and you <br/>
prevent his access, will you kill his passion?  And while you&#39;re at it, is <br/>
there not a danger that his respect and hope will erode?   My faith in my own <br/>
mother&#39;s good judgment eroded quickly as I saw her make selfish and arbitrary <br/>
decisions without regard for my own interests and desires and abilities.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;By establishing clear <br/>
limits with him, allowing him to schedule when he will watch TV and what has <br/>
reduced our friction over this issue.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like the friction is on your end, and he&#39;s having to give up a passion.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I&#39;m interested in his choice, I&#39;ll <br/>
watch along. If it is Barney sings again, I&#39;ll do something else.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can do something else and still sing along.  I learned every Barney song <br/>
there was to learn.  (By the time Pokemon came along, I didn&#39;t get involved <br/>
in that, because I still had a younger kid and I let the two Pokemon-boys <br/>
support each other in that interest.)  I could have told them Barney was <br/>
stupid, and they were wasting their time, and to turn the damned thing off, <br/>
but my goal was their learning in happiness, so my priority and belief <br/>
prevented insulting their interests.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Disney Saturday morning does not <br/>
thrill me, though. Should I fake it? Should I sit and watch instead of make <br/>
some yummy food from scratch? I loss interest when  I&#39;m watching Clifford <br/>
again for the 100th time.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you have to TELL them it doesn&#39;t thrill you?<br/>
Can&#39;t you make yummy food and bring them some where they&#39;re watching Clifford?<br/>
<br/>
People who will read the same book five times and listen to the same music <br/>
two hundred times sometimes say they will not watch a movie twice.   It stuns <br/>
me that they&#39;re thinking in such a shallow way.  There is SO much more to see <br/>
or to miss seeing in a movie than on a Beatles album or a Kurt Vonnegut book. <br/>
 No professor will teach a book he hasn&#39;t read repeatedly and also read <br/>
background and commentary on.  A child doesn&#39;t really KNOW a movie, or a <br/>
fairy tale, or a song, until after many hearings/viewings/singings.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I look at my son&#39;s glazed over expression and <br/>
wonder, is this TV media unsafe for him. He looks kind of ill, totally zoned <br/>
out, not really &quot;there&quot;. Looks like a stoned teenager. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you&#39;re jealous because he is Totally involved in something you&#39;re <br/>
not in on.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You can not stand in <br/>
the way of the TV or he freaks out. His baby sister can not turn it off <br/>
without an explosion from him. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you came and tore the page out of a book or magazine I was reading, I&#39;d be <br/>
pretty grumpy.  Or if you even closed the book, or turned the page.  <br/>
<br/>
If I were watching a movie that I couldn&#39;t rewind and someone insisted on <br/>
making me pay attention to them instead, I would think the person was <br/>
extremely rude.  I don&#39;t do that to people.  I&#39;d wait for a commercial if my <br/>
husband were watching West Wing and I wanted to ask him a question.  If he&#39;s <br/>
reading a novel, I ask him if I can talk to him in a bit.  He finishes the <br/>
paragraph or chapter, and comes and pays attention to me.   My kids are given <br/>
and have learned to give the same courtesies to people inside the family and <br/>
out. &quot;When you get a chance...&quot; is way better than &quot;TURN IT OFF NOW!&quot;  One <br/>
builds respect and love, and the other erodes it.<br/>
<br/>
There was a sweet program on when I was little, on PBS, called The Friendly <br/>
Giant.  Thanks to the internet, I looked it up one day, to show Holly <br/>
pictures, I hoped.  I learned that the host (a musician and puppeteer) had <br/>
recently died.  He was Canadian, and it was a CBC show.  Reading about his <br/>
life and his beliefs about learning was wonderful.   My mom used to come in <br/>
and say &quot;Turn that boring show off.&quot;  She had never even watched it.  That <br/>
show was more comforting to me and more loving than my own mother when that <br/>
was happening.<br/>
<br/>
If your son isn&#39;t like your daughters, the best answer might not be to shame <br/>
him about it and try to change him.  <br/>
<br/>
I hear Seven Spielberg and Robin Williams both watched a lot of TV when they <br/>
were little.  Paul Rubens and Al Yankovic did too.  I&#39;m glad their moms <br/>
didn&#39;t tell them to turn it off, because their work has enriched my life and <br/>
my kids&#39; lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429789616">We don&#39;t have TV either, although we used to, and nobody misses it. We started getting so busy with other things, that we didn&#39;t even think about watching TV. That&#39;s why when we moved to NC we decided not to have it hooked up. We have a VCR and my daughter can watch movies any time she wants, too. When we travel she gets to watch TV shows at the hotel, and this just seems to be part of the &quot;special&quot; things we do when we travel. Unless, of course, there&#39;s something more interesting than TV...<br/>
Plus, she can rent any of those shows any time at the video store anyway, so we can save the commercials.<br/>
<br/>
I am not anti-TV or anything like that, but it&#39;s pretty sad to see what TV has become. It&#39;s like &quot;instant mental pollution&quot; interrupting your show (if you happen to find a good one) every 5 minutes! I have better things to do with my life, and so does my dear daughter.<br/>
<br/>
My two cents...<br/>
<br/>
Yol<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I had to throw in my two cents regarding the issue of limiting TV and video<br/>
&gt; games.  Our kids have a lot of access to Game Boy and Nintendo, but we do not<br/>
&gt; have TV at all.  When we first moved to Georgia, we had TV, cable and all.<br/>
&gt; We found that there was so much garbage on cable that it wasn&#39;t worth<br/>
&gt; keeping, so we got rid of it.  Then about a month later our antennae broke,<br/>
&gt; and we ended up with no channels.  No one seemed to miss it, so we just never<br/>
&gt; replaced the antennae.  We have a VCR and a DVD player and the kids can watch<br/>
&gt; movies whenever they want.  We have a real issue with all the negative and<br/>
&gt; blatantly sexually explicit media images out there - it&#39;s scary that they<br/>
&gt; even use sex to sell children&#39;s products (I saw a very suggestive commercial<br/>
&gt; for &quot;Fruit by the Foot&quot;).  We feel that those subtle innuendoes are<br/>
&gt; unnecessary and damaging.  At our friends&#39; houses, the kids can take TV or<br/>
&gt; leave it.  They aren&#39;t really &quot;into&quot; the latest trends, bands, fashions,<br/>
&gt; etc., and we like it that way!  Pokemon was the big thing when our TV died,<br/>
&gt; so they sort of stalled there :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I guess I just wanted to say that removing TV is not always a bad<br/>
&gt; thing.  I do agree that by restricting or denying access to something you are<br/>
&gt; inviting an obsession, but it just doesn&#39;t seem to have happened in our case.<br/>
&gt;  Maybe it&#39;s because the stuff they enjoyed watching on TV (nature<br/>
&gt; documentaries, for the most part, and Pokemon) are all available on video, so<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t feel like they are missing anything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

we&#39;re not used to it yet, most of Rain&#39;s activities are over for a while,<br/>
and we&#39;ve turned the couch-futon into a bed pretty much permanently<br/>
because that&#39;s the only room with heat, so we do everything there. Last<br/>
night it was Futurama, Simpsons, 2 King of the Hills, Law and Order, and<br/>
The Practice. We&#39;re getting into these lawyer/investigator shows lately,<br/>
too... oh, and a movie about the 14th (I think) Dalai Lama, that was<br/>
first... Rain found it and started watching before I got there, so I<br/>
missed that first part, but it reminded her of The Cup so she was into<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been working on not feeling guilty about watching TV, and about Rain<br/>
watching TV. It&#39;s still hard, I&#39;m still surrounded by people who see it<br/>
as a stupid or bad or inferior thing, something that will mess up barins<br/>
waves, a waste of time... I watched TV as a kid, we&#39;ve collected videos<br/>
of some of my favorite shows (Aquaman, Land of the Lost) and it seemed<br/>
that there wasn&#39;t this kind of stigma to it back then. Now, admitting<br/>
that yup, we spent 6 hours yesterday watching TV feels like I should<br/>
apologize for it. But it was fun, we talked about stuff, we both read<br/>
during a lot of it (although I don&#39;t know why reading The Archies should<br/>
be more acceptable than watching Law and Order), and knitted...<br/>
<br/>
Just thinking,<br/>

I love that my son can see the way a cheetah moves when running at full<br/>
speed.  I love that he can see an elephant giving birth and fruit bats<br/>
flying at dusk. <br/>
<br/>
I love that he can watch flawed people doing foolish things and still see<br/>
a reason to love them.  (Will and Grace, Bernie Mac, The Simpsons)    <br/>
<br/>
I love that he can see glimpses of other lives and other jobs and other<br/>
ideas and other cultures.   <br/>
<br/>
He can watch a young Elvis dance and sing,  he can see the Beatles<br/>
&quot;live&quot;,  he can see Richard Nixon say &quot;I am not a criminal..&quot;   He can be<br/>
at Woodstock.<br/>
<br/>
He can sit in Deer Lodge, Montana and watch volcanos erupt.  <br/>

We have two, never limit, never restrict and my son still plays outside<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771327607">I just finished watching (unexpectedly, but it was fine) the Billboard Music <br/>
awards.  Marty&#39;s a big fan of Nickelback, and Holly wanted to see the Michael <br/>
Jackson part.  The finale was pretty wonderful.  The &quot;audience&quot; at our house <br/>
was me, Keith, Marty and Holly.  It lasted a little over two hours.  <br/>
<br/>
During that time Keith made and brought us a choice of rice/salmon in a bowl <br/>
or some homemade macaroni and cheese.  I took the brace off my leg for a <br/>
breather and lotion and massage.  We had the fire built up, and we discussed <br/>
this and that and the other as the show progressed.<br/>
<br/>

I had these same concerns,   I would have lived without TV, a couple of years ago.<br/>
 <br/>
My son has actually lost weight in the last 6 months, since we&#39;ve started this whole unschooling adventure,   I think for us its the whole limit/obsession thing.   We also lifted limits on the foods-hence he doesn&#39;t over eat. <br/>
 <br/>
There is something to say for vegging out, or escaping, such as, reading or watching TV,  what-ever.  I know as a kid I did those things when I was troubled, but I would also figure things out at the same time.  So I guess I wouldn&#39;t call it vegging out.<br/>
 <br/>
I guess for me I can&#39;t even begin to know when my kids need that time, hopefully they will come and talk to me, but I know they won&#39;t always want to.    <br/>
 <br/>
Even tho&#39;   I was raised in quite a controlling environment,  I am very thankful that when I was home I was allowed to do pretty much what I wanted when I wanted.  <br/>
I have to remember that right now, I have been pretty much pulling my hair out about my Mom lately.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936651978">&quot;Statistically,&quot; say statisticians who want to say &quot;no tv,&quot; kids who watch <br/>
more TV are fatter.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LOGICALLY and sensibly, kids who are fat and are being tormented by other <br/>
kids, or who just happen not to be jockish anyway, tend to watch TV more than <br/>
those who are out and about because they have the need to roller blade or <br/>
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend years ago who was small, effeminate, weak, and his dad thought <br/>
that if he shot hoops in the driveway every afternoon for forty five minutes, <br/>
he would get bigger, butcher and stronger.   No, what he got was teased by <br/>
every by-passing neighbor, and he spent 45 minutes every day resenting his <br/>
day to the bone.  He grew up mean and evil.  One of the few people I&#39;ve known <br/>
in my life of whom I would use the &quot;evil&quot; word.<br/>
<br/>
So too many times I&#39;ve noticed parents and researchers and teachers and those <br/>
badillions who are doing &quot;research&quot; to get a master&#39;s degree or a PhD in <br/>
education so they can get OUT of the classroom and into an administrative job <br/>
telling other teachers what to do.... (BREATHE! &lt;g&gt;) ... I&#39;ve seen them too <br/>
often take correlation as cause, because their paper only had to be 40 pages <br/>
and nobody made them prove cause.   <br/>

&gt; We&#39;ve been watching tons of TV lately... the weather has gotten cold and<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re not used to it yet, most of Rain&#39;s activities are over for a <br/>
&gt; while,<br/>
&gt; and we&#39;ve turned the couch-futon into a bed pretty much permanently<br/>
&gt; because that&#39;s the only room with heat, so we do everything there. Last<br/>
&gt; night it was Futurama, Simpsons, 2 King of the Hills, Law and Order, and<br/>
&gt; The Practice. We&#39;re getting into these lawyer/investigator shows lately,<br/>
&gt; too... oh, and a movie about the 14th (I think) Dalai Lama, that was<br/>
&gt; first... Rain found it and started watching before I got there, so I<br/>
&gt; missed that first part, but it reminded her of The Cup so she was into<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been working on not feeling guilty about watching TV, and about <br/>
&gt; Rain<br/>
&gt; watching TV. It&#39;s still hard, I&#39;m still surrounded by people who see it<br/>
&gt; as a stupid or bad or inferior thing, something that will mess up barins<br/>
&gt; waves, a waste of time... I watched TV as a kid, we&#39;ve collected videos<br/>
&gt; of some of my favorite shows (Aquaman, Land of the Lost) and it seemed<br/>
&gt; that there wasn&#39;t this kind of stigma to it back then. Now, admitting<br/>
&gt; that yup, we spent 6 hours yesterday watching TV feels like I should<br/>
&gt; apologize for it. But it was fun, we talked about stuff, we both read<br/>
&gt; during a lot of it (although I don&#39;t know why reading The Archies should<br/>
&gt; be more acceptable than watching Law and Order), and knitted...<br/>

I exercise every morning. I have found two things - one, my kids have got more interested in exercise routines, in weights, etc after watching me exercise. So, some have taken this on themselves. Two,  - I have taken to asking ( suggesting?)  if someone wants to come with me on my walk, making it a Mum and son time talking and walking together.

getting the boxes open and we end up putting them in.  They watch whatever <br/>

the buttons on the machines has been great for them.<br/>

<br/>
 I did see Jane Healy speak and she does have examples of the harm TV may cause. She also talked about the classroom and how the brain grows. She said the growing brain is the one asking questions. So in a classroom, the teacher is asking the most questions and keeps growing intellectually. My son asks a zillion questions while watching TV.  His brain is growing. He is learning. I still want to turn it off all the time, yet now I have learned to respect what the kids are doing. Am I interrupting something important or can we finish the movie later? My hubby and I do not want TV much. News maybe once in a while and that is all. We took the kids to the snow on Superbowl Sunday. A great way to avoid crowds. I think we are modeling the self- control we hope for. For now, when we are home, the kids can watch TV if they want. they watch a lot. <br/>
<br/>
I did get overwhelmed recently with the hours they were watching. We have been on a Starwars role for weeks. I told the kids before bedtime that I needed a different day and I needed to be able to listen to music and dance and play with them so I was scheduling a TV free day. They completely respected it, woke up the next day, brought games out to play with me. Had they really had a problem with my idea, I would have listened and compromised. I&#39;m happier not policing their TV. They are happier to be able to do what they like. If they are being ruined, they are safely home with a listening ear watching Between the Lions learning how to sound out words. And I was able to write for the first time in weeks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882070018">I found this quote on a Montessori site while looking for something else <br/>
(one of the great things about using the internet)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The primary danger of the television screen lies not so much in the <br/>
behavior it produces as the behavior it prevents... Turning on the <br/>
television set can turn off the process that transforms children into adults.&quot;<br/>
--Urie Bronfenbrenner<br/>
<br/>
I googled Urie Bronfenbrenner and discovered he is the Jacob Gould Schurman <br/>
Professor Emeritus of Human Development and Family Studies and of <br/>
Psychology, Cornell University.<br/>
<br/>
You know, what I found with my own children when they were small belied <br/>
what I had read about, and sometimes seen with, tv use.  My children did <br/>
not become zombies in front of the tv.  They were either engaged in the <br/>
program or watching it partly while doing something else. Maybe, based on <br/>
discussions I have read here, it is because they did not have anything to <br/>
escape or zone out from like day care, over-scheduling, or a difficult home <br/>
life. I did restrict the tv when they were younger and regret that now.<br/>
<br/>
What I always wonder when I read these studies or opinions on child-related <br/>
matters is how much time the person/people conducting the study spend with <br/>
either their own children or other children in real everyday situations. <br/>
When you parent your children in an intensive way, that is, spend a lot of <br/>
time with them and react to their needs and desires, you know more about <br/>
them than a million studies could ever tell anyone. The expert opinions may <br/>
be interesting in a scholarly sort of way (for daycares and schools, I <br/>
guess) but they don&#39;t mean much in my day to day life.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  <br/>
<br/>
And even in the quote:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; &quot;The primary danger of the television screen lies not so much in the <br/>
behavior it produces as the behavior it prevents... Turning on the <br/>
television set can turn off the process that transforms children into <br/>
adults.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
he said Turning on the television set CAN turn off the process, he said.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t say always.  Doesn&#39;t say &quot;does.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But anti-TV people love to jump on stuff like that and say &quot;SEE!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
See WHAT?<br/>
<br/>
When a child has free access to all kinds of things, it&#39;s HIS process.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a world of difference between a child&#39;s life run by adult decisions <br/>
and schedules and an unschooled child who has his whole life, all day, all <br/>
night, at his own disposal.<br/>
<br/>
If you (any reader reading this) haven&#39;t ever yet seen the result of a child <br/>
having real choices and freedoms, then you&#39;re not looking at the same thing <br/>
others here are looking at.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s simple but hugely foreign.  Almost all of what&#39;s written about children <br/>
and teens has to do with school, and overcoming the effects of school and <br/>
compensating for the time spent in school and trying to bridge the gap <br/>
created between parent and child  by school.<br/>
<br/>
This is such a new model that very little of the old &quot;knowledge&quot; works in it <br/>
at all.<br/>

stopped by today to arrange some babysitting time with me.  She came with her <br/>
new charge, a three year old from a block over.  My two, of course, were <br/>

dragged her and the boy over to see.  And then proceeded to dance along, <br/>
jumping, falling on the floor, kicking their legs, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
The boy stood there mesmorized by the tv.  Completely transfixed.  I asked <br/>
her why he was so quiet and she told me he is allowed 1/2 an hour of tv twice <br/>
a week.  So, according to her, whenever he sees anything on a screen, he <br/>
stares at it and is afraid to move in case it is turned off.  Poor kid.  Too <br/>

was a &quot;bad&quot; thing, I couldn&#39;t tear myself away. I watched for hours, even if <br/>
I didn&#39;t like the show.<br/>
As a child and teen, my friends would get frustrated with me because when I <br/>
was at their house, that&#39;s all I wanted to do. It was SO fascinating.<br/>
I still become rather &quot;zombie&quot; like when watching, my kids aren&#39;t like this <br/>
at all.<br/>
They come and go, flitting from interest to interest. The only time they <br/>
really watch several shows in a row is in the evening, when Adult Swim is on. <br/>
(they love that warped sense of humor and the Japanese anime).<br/>
I could list all the cool conversations and things they&#39;ve learned from hours <br/>
and hours of tv, I don&#39;t think it would convince anyone though. ?<br/>
Or would it?<br/>

&gt; Makes me think something is wrong with me or my kids<br/>
&gt; because we watch TV. I know that&#39;s not true so not sure really why it<br/>
&gt; bothers me. I just think it&#39;s a bunch of crap!<br/>

LOL!!! Oh I guess I should apologize for that one huh? It just rubbed me for <br/>
the umpteenth time the wrong way. Spoke before I had a chance to put it <br/>
nicely. Sometimes that&#39;s the best way to get a point across!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-239869697">All this talk about television reminded me of something that happened <br/>
several years ago with Colton, who was eight at the time.  I am ashamed to <br/>
say that I went through a period of extreme TV snobbishness.  I felt that <br/>
watching television was a waste of our time, so I got rid of cable.  We only <br/>
watched carefully chosen videos, designed to enrich and uplift us.  (I cringe <br/>
as I write this now!)  I was totally obnoxious about it.<br/>
<br/>
   One day Colton and Bud returned from the library, thrilled with what they <br/>
had found.  A video copy of &quot;Godzilla!&quot;  I snorted derisively and suggested <br/>
that our time would be better spent with a book.  I was ignored.  They made <br/>
some popcorn and started the movie.  I sat with them on the couch, or to be <br/>
more accurate, on my moral high horse, with an &quot;uplifting&quot; book in hand.  I <br/>
rolled my eyes and sighed with gusto to point out how they were wasting their <br/>
time.  Colton and Bud continued to ignore me.<br/>
<br/>
   Something finally penetrated my self-imposed role as the chief of the <br/>
culture police.  A voice whispered in my ear: Look at them, Carol.  Just LOOK <br/>
at them!  I studied my son and my husband for about five minutes.  They were <br/>
totally engrossed in the movie, yet they never stopped touching each other.  <br/>
Colton would lean against Bud&#39;s shoulder as he giggled helplessly, or Bud <br/>
would squeeze Colton&#39;s leg during a particularly intense moment.  They were <br/>
totally connected to each other through their movie experience, and it was a <br/>
joy to watch.  I knew that they were making a memory together.<br/>
<br/>
   We had cable reinstalled the next day, and we never looked back.  We don&#39;t <br/>
watch a lot of TV, but when we do, we do it together.  We have laughed and <br/>
cried together as we have watched, and we have wondered and marveled.  <br/>
Television has been a wonderful learning experience for me.  It taught me to <br/>
loosen up, and to appreciate those wonderful moments when I cocoon with my <br/>
family.  And when I watch my husband and son stomping around the house like <br/>
Godzilla as they destroy Tokyo, I know that I am standing on holy ground.<br/>
