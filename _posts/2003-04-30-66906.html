&lt;&lt; went to Chicago for Oprah &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m right now trying to get tix (actually, reservations) to her show. The <br/>
current phone message says it&#39;s full for May, and the line will re-open up <br/>
when June shows are scheduled. I need to plan this trip waaaay in advance, <br/>
mostly because my girlfriend who will be going with me (hubby and kids <br/>
staying here), needs to tell her work in January her vacation days for the <br/>
whole year. Also advance planing because of airline tix (I live in <br/>
California) and hotel reservations. So my Q to you (or anyone else who knows) <br/>
is, once I finally get ahold of the show, do you happen to know if they make <br/>
any kind of reservations way in advance (as in mid-next year) now, or is it <br/>
each month for the following month? (It doesn&#39;t specify on the website or <br/>
phone recording.) It&#39;s my understanding that it&#39;s hard to get thru, and that <br/>
when you do, tix are mostly already gone. So, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to <br/>
plan a trip in advance if that&#39;s the case, and I can&#39;t get advance <br/>
reservations. TIA to any who has info!!   Lara...........</div>
