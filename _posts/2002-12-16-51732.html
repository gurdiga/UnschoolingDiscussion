&lt;&lt; Now if Joyce or <br/>
 Sandry or Ren  responds that Yol is a worthy and welcome member, i am sure <br/>
 you will start kissing Yol&#39;s butt like its covered in honey &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I highly doubt that.<br/>
Having met Elissa, I can tell you that she will tell me right to my face if <br/>
she disagrees.<br/>
She&#39;s not a butt kisser in any way....trust me.<br/>
<br/>
As to why she agreed that it was handled well after she read Joyces post, <br/>
there was MORE information given that wasn&#39;t previously there.<br/>
I also thought HMMMMM, when the poster described needing coffee before <br/>
helping her son, but when she described the very creative way she dealt with <br/>
meeting both needs I though &quot;COOL!&quot;<br/>

&quot;Knowledge will not always take the place of simple observation.&quot;<br/>

without knowing who you are respondind to?   Still sounds like a snap <br/>
judgement.<br/>
