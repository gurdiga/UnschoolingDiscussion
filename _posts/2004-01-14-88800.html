another 3 mos of Mom being in pain and unable to do a whole lot. <br/>
We used to go swimming once a week, hiking , biking, lots of outdoor stuff, <br/>
fun indoor stuff. Now I am grumpy and not much fun. I feel guilty that I cannot <br/>

remember me without a broken arm, we had to give up thte sling cold turkey when <br/>
I broke it. I can&#39;t drive many places as the car is a standard and the right <br/>
arm is broken. Glad I am a lefty.<br/>
I recently got Sandra&#39;s peaceful parenting tape and that has helped. I just <br/>
need ideas to get through this with my poor kids intact. We live rurally, so <br/>
can&#39;t just walk to town or stores. We recently got an X-box, and it is fun.<br/>
Thanks for listening to the ramble. <br/>

First of all, HUGS to you! I can&#39;t imagine the pain you&#39;re going through, having never had a broken bone let alone one that didn&#39;t heal and was rebroken! I&#39;m sorry to hear this is keeping you home-bound!<br/>
 <br/>
First of all, just be honest with the children! Let them know you&#39;re not going to be 100% but that you WILL be alright and that they will as well. Be sure to take care of yourself and don&#39;t withold any pain medications from yourself that you might need!! <br/>
 <br/>
Other than that I really don&#39;t know, but try to stay positive about the situation! <br/>

I can so relate to you!  I broke my ankle last October, was casted for almost <br/>
8 weeks and even now have trouble walking too far.  It doesn&#39;t help (the <br/>
walking) that I&#39;m pregnant, but that&#39;s almost over.  <br/>
<br/>
What worked for me was shifting my activities to stuff indoors.  Lots of <br/>
crafty stuff, board games, word games, making up songs, putting on music for the <br/>
kids to dance to (they liked putting on shows), arranging play dates for the <br/>
the 4 year old who would leave the house without me, having help come in, having <br/>
a dear friend stay with us for a couple of weeks.  Yes, you need to mourn for <br/>
the things you&#39;ll be missing until you heal properly, but you also need to <br/>
move on and figure out things you CAN do with the children.  And then do them.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s depressing and not where you want to be right now, I know.  But it will <br/>
end as long as the arm heals.  I&quot;m looking forward to getting my plates, <br/>
screws and pins out in about six months or so after the baby.  Then I&quot;ll feel more <br/>
normal and will be able to function better with my cherubs.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Elizabeth, those are the types of things we are trying. It is <br/>
depressing and I think that is al ot of my problem. I am depressed on and off. The <br/>
surgery will not happen for a few more weeks, medicine being what it is in BC, so <br/>
I will enjoy the time I have left till then and do as much as I can.(May even <br/>
sneak a ride on my new horse,Whats the worst that will happen,I&#39;ll break my <br/>
arm???&lt;G&gt;)Can&#39;t do much big stuff, but we met a friend at McD&#39;s today to play <br/>
in the play area. That was fun. I am getting some gifts from this, just some <br/>
days it looks really bleak to me.<br/>
