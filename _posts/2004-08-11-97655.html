I realize that Sales and Marketing are sometimes considered &quot;vulgar&quot;, <br/>
but you are &quot;selling&quot; an unschooling conference to the unschooled.  <br/>
Seems appropriate for this list.<br/>
************************************<br/>
Okay, you got it:<br/>
<br/>
Eleven REALLY COOL Things about the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>
<br/>
1. Barbara Sher, author of Wishcraft and other books, and PBS Pledge time <br/>
star, is doing her workshop especially for us. In addition, because she is so <br/>
intrigued by Unschoolers, she is staying for the WHOLE conference! (She usually <br/>
jusy goes into towns for the day.)<br/>
<br/>
2. The World Premiere of Stirling, a comedy-mystery feature-length movie <br/>
written, produced, directed by, and starring homeschooled teens. <br/>
<br/>
3. True Story Theater will take our experiences and ideas and turn them into <br/>
a performace for us.<br/>
<br/>
4. Amazing speakers like Sandra Dodd, Anne Ohman, Pam Laricchia, Ben Lovejoy, <br/>
Valerie Fitzenreiter, etc. <br/>
<br/>
5. Really cool stuff in goodie bags for attendees.<br/>
<br/>
6. The Talent Show! Unschoolers are a talented bunch!<br/>
<br/>
7. Late Night Rooms for Folks who can&#39;t get enough! There will be two program <br/>
rooms open until 3 AM (when the Security guy goes home) -- one for adults <br/>
(and kids with them) and one for Teens.<br/>
<br/>
8. Concert by Robin Blair (Followed the next morning by a Funshop.)<br/>
<br/>
9. Still some space in a whale watch with lots of cool unschoolers, at an <br/>
astonishing price.<br/>
<br/>
10. Come see how Julian&#39;s chainmaille shirt came out, and try it on.<br/>
<br/>
11. The possibility that Kathryn just might reprise her performance of The <br/>
Daisy Song.<br/>

house down there.  Might help with the costs!  Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541084624">Hi everyone,<br/>
Don&#39;t forget that registration for the October Live and Learn Unschooling  <br/>
Conference in St. Louis, MO is open.  Just go to <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/registration.html_">http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/registration.html_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/registration.html)">http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/registration.html)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
It is a wonderful conference full of Unschoolers from all over. Now is  your <br/>
chance to hear unschooling speakers, be with unschooling families and  just <br/>
immerse yourself in unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
ALSO we are looking for unique vendors/exhibitors.  If you have a  product of <br/>
service you would like to put out there for other Unschoolers there  are <br/>
several ways you can participate:<br/>
1) Exhibit Booth at the Conference<br/>
2) Exhibitor  Facetime<br/>
3) Conference Handbook  Advertising<br/>
4) Brochure Bag<br/>
 <br/>
If you would like more information you can go here <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/exhibitors.html_">http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/exhibitors.html_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/exhibitors.html)">http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/exhibitors.html)</a>  for  all the details.<br/>
 <br/>
Think outside the box, think like Unschoolers...<br/>
If you have an idea or thought please e mail me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_genant2@...">_genant2@...</a>_ <br/>
(mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:genant2@...">genant2@...</a>)   and we will see if we can make it happen.  If you have an <br/>
idea but are  unsure if it will be profitable, e mail me and we will talk and <br/>
see what we can  come up with. <br/>
 <br/>
This conference is NOT like all other homeschooling conferences.   We DO NOT <br/>
want the usual curriculum vendors we want Unschoolers.  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
And now back to your normal programming.<br/>
