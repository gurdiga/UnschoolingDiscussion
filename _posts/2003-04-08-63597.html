&gt;Oh TIA!!!! Please consider it. I&#39;ll be there and the teen program is<br/>

seems so close to the SC one. But, hell, I can drive to Sacramento from <br/>
Utah. A great teen program and new friends for Conor might make it worth it.<br/>

It is just one week from the dates of the SC conference.  Is anyone but<br/>
Pam S. going to make the heroic effort to attend both?<br/>
<br/>
The conference in Sacramento is sponsored by the Homeschoool Association<br/>
of California (HSC).  The conference is not exclusively unschooling, but<br/>
it is unschooler-friendly and quite relaxed.  I really enjoy it!<br/>
<br/>
Info should be available at:<br/>

<br/>
Early registration, before May 15th, and being a member of HSC can<br/>
really cut down on the conference cost.<br/>
