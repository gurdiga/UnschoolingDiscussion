&lt;&lt; It was, for us, an extension of the warm and fun things we had been doing <br/>
before Kirby was schoolage.  But I never say &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve been unschooling <br/>
since he was born.&quot;   I know some people do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I thought unschooling was a way of life, a way of parenting, *as-well-as* <br/>
not forcing curriculum. So in that sense, wouldn&#39;t it make sense for someone <br/>
to say they&#39;ve been unschooling since he was born (as in no TV/food/video <br/>
games/etc. restrictions) to make it understood how they&#39;ve been parenting all <br/>
along?   Lara.........</div>

games/etc. restrictions) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
The TV & food stuff is not unschooling.  If so, someone could have a kid in <br/>
school, but not restrict food and games, and say they were unschooling all <br/>
except for one thing.<br/>
<br/>
For me, unschooling is how the family is dealing with laws about compulsory <br/>
education.  <br/>
<br/>
From the INSIDE of unschooling there are lots of things to know and consider, <br/>
but from the outside, what it is from the outside, is not having kids in <br/>
school and also not using a curriculum nor school-style teaching.<br/>
<br/>
If someone does all the kinds of things we&#39;re talking about with a two year <br/>
old, well!  THEY SHOULD!   And if someone does all these things until a child <br/>
is five and then sends him to school, I don&#39;t even NEARLY see it as &quot;we <br/>
unschooled until he was five.&quot;   They just provided him a wonderful <br/>
pre-school experience.<br/>
<br/>
Others feel differently, but without the necessary move and courage of saying <br/>
no when compulsory school-age comes, I don&#39;t consider any treatment of an <br/>
under-five-year-old to be unschooling (personally, myself) no matter what <br/>
their neighbors or sisters were doing with THEIR two and four year olds.<br/>
<br/>
If someone has an eight year old who has never been to school and says &quot;We&#39;ve <br/>
homeschooled for three years,&quot; I&#39;ll count that as three years.  If someone <br/>
has a three year old and says &quot;we&#39;ve homeschooled for three years&quot; I&#39;ll <br/>
discount it entirely.  We still don&#39;t know if two years hence that kid will <br/>
be in school.<br/>

<br/>
The principles of raising toddlers in a peaceful, loving, nurturing <br/>
environment (and their learning like crazy) work at any age.  That&#39;s why  <br/>
unschooling works.<br/>
<br/>
When attachment parenting and the facilitation of natural learning don&#39;t end <br/>
when schoolage comes, that is called unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If there were no such thing as compulsory education laws, I guess it could <br/>
just be called &quot;continuing attachment parenting&quot; (which is pretty much what <br/>
it is!)<br/>

When someone with a one year old says &quot;unschooling&quot; the question is &quot;as <br/>

Kids start their &#39;schooling&#39; around here WAY before they hit <br/>

wouldn&#39;t be behind when they got to kindergarten.  It was a serious concern <br/>
of theirs, no matter what I thought of it.  (I ran a very non-academic, <br/>
muddy, messy, yummy child care.  How are they going to learn their ABC&#39;s <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well that&#39;s just because a word that has &quot;school&quot; in it ended up getting<br/>
used.  So it&#39;s being defined by what it&#39;s not.  I&#39;d rather see it defined by<br/>
what it is, but the word unschooling has stuck.  If it&#39;s a philosophy of<br/>
helping kids learn about their world in their way, then it&#39;s just a<br/>
continuation of what was happening before the kids hit some age that&#39;s not<br/>
even the same in every state and province.<br/>
<br/>
I do understand the frustration with people who &quot;unschool&quot; until school age,<br/>
but I also understand that people who get what unschooling is don&#39;t really<br/>
change anything at that magic school age.  For instance, I can&#39;t see any<br/>
difference between what my daughter does with her 8 year old compared to the<br/>
2 year old and the baby, except that the 8 year old already understands a<br/>
lot more about her world than the younger ones.  But she learned it all the<br/>
same way the younger ones are learning about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122092622">I also came across a website a few days ago that I can&#39;t seem to find<br/>
now because I don&#39;t remember exactly what my search words were.  But the<br/>
&quot;homeschooling mom&quot; had one child, he was ten months old, and she&#39;d been<br/>
&quot;homeschooling&quot; since before he was born.  She was a former teacher and<br/>
she had an eight hour a day curriculum that she began by reading out<br/>
loud while she was pregnant.  As soon as his eyes could focus, it was<br/>
four hours a day of flash cards, plus her reading books and reciting the<br/>
times tables and states and capitals.  She had her whole house covered<br/>
with educational posters at just the height that when he starts to walk,<br/>
that&#39;s all he&#39;ll see on every wall.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a couple on Oprah a few years ago who had a whole house full of<br/>
educational stuff for their infant.  I&#39;m talking globes and<br/>
encyclopedias.  If it wasn&#39;t educational, she wasn&#39;t allowed to play<br/>
with it.  She couldn&#39;t even talk yet and they were &quot;quizzing&quot; her on<br/>
types of birds.  They had flash cards and told her to point to the one<br/>
that was a cardinal.  The sad thing is, the people doing these bizarre<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632476222">Good Morning,<br/>
I find that in some areas of Providence, this mentality applies.. When I was first awarded placement of Brianna, I searched for day care. (I was finishing a degree program and working.) The competition for some of the &#39;pre-school enrichment & learning centers&#39; was fierce!! <br/>
The state was helping me pay for this, so I thought that with the state money and what I could afford, Brianna would be in a great day care program. <br/>
My college courses were 4 days per week. 9AM-11:45AM. I found a day care that was seemingly okay. They concentrated on organized activities. They promised &quot;learning adventures&quot; This day care was one of the most desired in the area!<br/>
I would drop her off at around 8:20 AM and usually I was there by noon. I must say that the day care required payment for a full day (7AM-5:30PM).<br/>
One day, due to a major traffic problem, I arrived there at approx 12:45 PM. I had called the office and explained the traffic situation. The office person put me on hold. The director came on and asked me when I would be there. I honestly couldn&#39;t give an answer. I was in traffic, it was beyond my control. She informed me that our agreement was that I pick Brianna up around noon. I pointed out that the center was getting paid for full time day care and had been, in fact, providing part time day care, I also said that this was very unusual for me to be late and that I really didn&#39;t see the problem.<br/>
When I arrived, Brianna was sitting out by the double locked doors - by herself- with her little school bag and jacket. She was frightened. Just a few feet away - in her classroom, the kids were playing.<br/>
When the secretary came to open the door for me, I was pissed! I wanted to speak to the administrator, but was told she was busy. I could see the office, the woman was eating a salad & reading Cosmo.<br/>
I picked Brianna up and walked into the administrators office. I fired them.<br/>
Not only did I pull Brianna out, I put a stop payment on the check and had this daycare stricken from the state rolls so the state wouldn&#39;t pay for them anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Looking back, this action of theirs was part & parcel of training the kids. The administrator told me that Brianna needed to be disciplined, trained - that she was spoiled. (At this time, Brianna had seen goddess knows what while in custody of her bio-mom who was an iv drug user.) Brianna was & remains a rather quiet kid. Back then, she was very quiet. kids used to take her snacks, her toys and she would say & do nothing. I couldn&#39;t understand what this cosmos reading woman was talking about!!<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of the semester, Brianna went into another day care that was so much better, however, it was serendipitous that I got her in there!! It was also over $100.00 per week more!! (thank goddess for the state help!)<br/>
<br/>
For a long time after the experience w/ the first day care, Brianna was very wary of doing ANYTHING!!! w/o asking! She would get visibly upset over &quot;being wrong&quot; in writing, etc.<br/>
<br/>
all in all - it was terrible for Brianna.<br/>
