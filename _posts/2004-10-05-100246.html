<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512169381">I apologize if this is inappropriate for this list, and perhaps it <br/>
will be returned, but I could really use some help finding quotes <br/>
from the presidential candidates regarding their view of <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Although I already know who I am voting for, and even though their <br/>
stand on homeschooling wouldn&#39;t be a deciding factor for me, I am <br/>
curious, does anyone know, especially does anyone have a quote from <br/>
John Kerry regarding his stance on homeschooling?  <br/>
<br/>
This topic came up on a local homeschool list, and although I <br/>
searched until my eyes felt like they were going to pop out, I could <br/>
not find any reliable info on Kerry&#39;s view of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Jennefer</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126151486">It doesn&#39;t matter what the president things about homeschooling, honestly.<br/>
I get so tired of the conservative Christian-Homeschoolers playing that same <br/>
boring card to manipulate homeschooelers to vote for conservatives so they can <br/>
further their primary goal, which is political conservative theocracy.<br/>
