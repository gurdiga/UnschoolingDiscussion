<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127056733">I love reading the posts here...the sometimes different ways of <br/>
seeing things, and alternate solutions, so wanted to get <br/>
thoughts/advice/feedback on this.<br/>
<br/>
The only requirement that we have, as &quot;homeschoolers&quot; registered <br/>
with our local school board, is to turn in attendance reports each <br/>
year and to have 4 hrs/day of instruction.  Of course, we <br/>
view &quot;instruction&quot; as anything and everything...living life, and we <br/>
do it every day :), so we send in the forms each year and that&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, this would be my oldest son&#39;s 5th grade year in school.  <br/>
He&#39;s &quot;required&quot; to take a state test.  I would prefer he didn&#39;t <br/>
because it&#39;s useless and potentially worse than useless (harmful).  <br/>
My husband is a &quot;lawful good&quot; person (Sandra, you&#39;re familiar with <br/>
role playing...D&D miniatures, modules, maps and adventures are <br/>
constantly in play here) and as such, doesn&#39;t want us to actively <br/>
try to avoid the test (such as my listing him as a 4th grader this <br/>
year, or advancing him to 6th).  He feels that we should follow the <br/>
rules.<br/>
<br/>
So far, I&#39;ve called the school board several times to try to <br/>
determine what the penalty is for NOT taking the test.  No one seems <br/>
to know.  The &quot;rules&quot; state that the test has to be done...nothing <br/>
is said about what will occur if it isn&#39;t.  I&#39;ve also tried to <br/>
determine exactly what the test is called so that IF we do this, I <br/>
can at least obtain some practice tests so that my son will know <br/>
what to expect.  Again, no one seems to be able to provide that <br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also told my husband that IF the school board doesn&#39;t contact <br/>
us, I will not contact them.  He&#39;s a bit uncomfortable with that but <br/>
I simply said &quot;Oh, so because they&#39;re inept, I&#39;m now supposed to do <br/>
THEIR job FOR them with something that I don&#39;t believe in doing <br/>
anyway?&quot;  He let that one go. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to adopt the attitude that DS will take the test with the <br/>
explanation that it&#39;s &quot;no big deal.&quot;  But I&#39;m afraid that if he <br/>
takes it, and doesn&#39;t do well, this will be fuel for more <br/>
negativity toward unschooling.  Both grandparents, my husband, and I <br/>
have advanced degrees in education...so we&#39;re really stepping <br/>
outside the &quot;norm&quot; for our family in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
DS is a terrific reader (he regularly DMs and has no trouble reading <br/>
a player&#39;s handbook), has an amazing wealth of knowledge and <br/>
abilities, yet little of it fits into the school &quot;box.&quot;  I hate to <br/>
think that a standardized test could be used to &quot;judge&quot; him in any <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts? Advice? Suggestions? <br/>

<br/>
When my sister decided to comply, a while back when New Mexico had  <br/>
testing requirements, the option most seemed to be using here was to  <br/>
buy the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) from Bob Jones University.    <br/>
Lots of people don&#39;t want to support Bob Jones University, and that&#39;s  <br/>
understandable, but just as one more point of information...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re unschooling, it&#39;s  not uch of a stretch to say &quot;He&#39;s not a  <br/>
fifth grader.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just ditched the tests when Kirby was eight, and nothing happened.<br/>
<br/>
With the schools&#39; requirements for testing, they aren&#39;t required to  <br/>
test every child, just a percentage of them.  So if a sufficient  <br/>
percentage of homeschoolers take the test, the state probably  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t hunt down any others.  Still, if the law puts the  <br/>
responsibility on the parents that&#39;s a little different.<br/>
<br/>
As to options and fines and such, maybe ask the state list with the  <br/>
most Christian homeschoolers on it, because they seem to specialize  <br/>
in knowing all the laws because they&#39;re so often involved in  <br/>
political agitation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246849894">Must you turn the test scores in to someone official?  In GA, we&#39;re <br/>
required to test at the end of 3rd, 6th and 9th grades but we don&#39;t <br/>
actually send the scores to anyone.  I used a test designed for <br/>
homeschoolers called the PASS test by Hewitt Homeschooling.  My son <br/>
enjoyed the test because we did it over a few days and it wasn&#39;t <br/>
timed.  We mailed the tests in and got the results within 2 weeks.  I <br/>
went ahead and showed him the results because they were good but then <br/>
we just dropped it in our yearly folder where I kept copies of our <br/>
monthly attendance records and annual report.  I didn&#39;t share it with <br/>
anyone else, not even family.  They didn&#39;t even know we were supposed <br/>
to have done a test because they are all clueless when it comes to <br/>
homeschooling.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My recommendation is to wing it!  Hannah was tested last year (&quot;2nd&quot; <br/>
grade) for the first time.  As our state uses the standardized test to <br/>
&quot;show improvement&quot; there was no fear in taking the first year test.  <br/>
Even as an &quot;always unschooled&quot; kid, she had no problem taking the two <br/>
required parts (reading and math) of their provided test.  Our state law <br/>
offers the option of providing the results of our own purchased test or <br/>
taking the district provided one.  The law also explains the <br/>
standardized test must be taking in the &quot;natural learning environment&quot; <br/>
which means I provide the test at home, at our leisure. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really scarier for us &quot;schooled folk&quot; than it is for the kids &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

through the hoop in order to maintain your freedoms, then find ways to<br/>
lower the hoop to make it easier.<br/>
<br/>
Surly your state homeschooling list knows what test is given.  Order<br/>
practice tests and go over them with him.  You can&#39;t be the only<br/>
unschooling family in your whole state.  How have other unschoolers<br/>
there handled the testing procedures?<br/>
<br/>
If you can give the test at home, do away with any time limits. <br/>
Spread it out over several days, let him wear his pajamas and give him<br/>
hot cocoa and his favorite snack while he is doing it, discuss the<br/>
areas he doesn&#39;t know how to do, show him how, and then let him choose<br/>
the answer.  I would imagine that he will do just fine except for<br/>
possibly some of the math like long division or multiplying/dividing<br/>
fractions, and possibly some of the stupid grammar questions.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, you could fill in the dots for him if you are allowed to<br/>
administer the test yourself! Okay, yeah, it is cheating, but they are<br/>
really testing you anyway, right?  To see if you are good enough to<br/>
teach him, not whether or not he is smart enough to learn.<br/>

The law was changed a few years ago to say that we take them in the same  <br/>
grades as the public schools do.  Back then, that was in 3 7 and 9.   Now the <br/>
schools take them every year from 3-9, so stupid agitating homeschoolers  who <br/>
thought this was a good idea got us to taking test every year.<br/>
 <br/>
And there&#39;s a truancy charge if you don&#39;t take them.<br/>
 <br/>
The alternate testing is free of charge for the tests, but you&#39;d have to  pay <br/>
if you hired a proctor or rented a facility. <br/>

You&#39;re probably the only person I&#39;ve ever met in TN who registered with the  <br/>
local school district instead of using an umbrella school.  I homeschooled  in <br/>
TN for 8 years.  It&#39;s so rare that I didn&#39;t even recognize the state  because <br/>
no one I know has ever complied with it.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;re working the law to your advantage.  An umbrella  school <br/>
would be a much better option for avoiding testing, and still I don&#39;t  believe <br/>
there is passing grade requirement. And there&#39;s no penalty that I can  find <br/>
anywhere for if your child is suddenly taken ill on the testing days.<br/>

I know this is state specific information, but this is a big list and  there <br/>
may be someone else who needs this information.  I think it&#39;s  pertinent to <br/>
unschooling to be able to discern the principles in the law and  apply them to <br/>
your life without causing stress or undue schoolishness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198059746">Karen, when we first started unschooling, I researched the different <br/>
umbrella schools and their requirements.  I don&#39;t remember all of <br/>
the specifics now, but I remember deciding to NOT go that route for <br/>
several reasons.  One was the religious aspect.  We&#39;re not religious <br/>
at all...in fact, I&#39;m atheist (try being in a Christian homeSCHOOL <br/>
group as an atheist UNschooler...egads!).  Most of the umbrella <br/>
schools are religion-based and I was NOT willing to sign a statement <br/>
of faith.  <br/>
<br/>
The second reason, IIRC, was curriculum requirements.  At the time, <br/>
it seemed like we would more hoops to deal with that way vs. <br/>
worrying about the state testing that was, at that time, 5 yrs in <br/>
the future.<br/>
<br/>
Third was cost.  It costs nothing to register with the school board.<br/>
<br/>
As for ways to avoid the test...as I stated in the original post, <br/>
yes, we could avoid it in several ways.  But part of the reason <br/>
for posting was to get thoughts on how to deal with a husband who <br/>
feels that we *should* follow the rules. :&#92;<br/>

Oh, I guess then not registering at all is out of the question.<br/>
 <br/>
If he would rather follow rules at the expense of his child&#39;s happiness, I  <br/>
don&#39;t have any advice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a bit of a jump there.  No where in my postings have I <br/>
indicated that our son would be unhappy with taking the test.  So <br/>
far, he hasn&#39;t indicated ANY unhappiness or concern about it.  It&#39;s <br/>
*my* issues that make me so annoyed about it...I don&#39;t like jumping <br/>
through hoops of any kind.  <br/>
<br/>
My son is so much like his dad that he might decide he *wants* to <br/>
take the test.  He&#39;s the one that, when we first started <br/>
unschooling, said &quot;But Mom, we didn&#39;t do 4 hrs of school today!&quot;  I <br/>
had to explain to him that reading the menu at the pizza place, <br/>
talking about how many slices of pizza we&#39;d had, counting out <br/>
change, Dad reading a bedtime story...was all &quot;instruction&quot; so that <br/>
we really were following the &quot;rules.&quot;<br/>
