<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087314854">What do you all do when you need time to yourselves?<br/>
<br/>
My kids have been up until 2am quite a  few nights, playing play station or whatever.  I go to bed before then, (though not much before then).<br/>
<br/>
But lately I find my nerves are fried and I&#39;d really like to enjoy a good movie ALONE without any interruptions (including the fighting that goes on).<br/>

follow, they are too involved in what they are doing, but soemtimes they do.  <br/>
LOL. Mine are 8 and 5 as well.<br/>

I conquered my fear of the evil basement stairs that broke my ankle.  then I <br/>
got my alone time.  Short bursts work well for me.  Some people need longer <br/>
stretches...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373721101">This is what I need too:  time to unwind before bed.  I was just thinking this morning about putting the computer downstairs near the bedroom LOL! I don&#39;t think there is room though.<br/>
<br/>
I think our problem is our house is too small and there is just nowhere to go anymore.  My husband escapes to the basement.  The kids follow me everywhere.  Even when I want to take a bath, one of them girls comes in and sits on the commode just to talk to me.<br/>
<br/>
I&quot;m flattered and all, but sometimes I REALLY need time by myself...and in this cold weather I hate to go outside, and its usually around midnight that I&#39;m trying to get time alone so I can&#39;t really go out for a walk.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I guess I can&#39;t offer any suggestions for you as my situation is pretty easy <br/>
for me. The little ones are asleep between 11:30 and 12:30 these days. <br/>
Usually my husband is too. Sometimes I go to bed with him and if I&#39;m tired <br/>
stay there, sometimes I go to bed with him and then get up after. That <br/>
leaves me time around 1:00-3:00 for mindless TV or computer time or reading <br/>
time. My kids very rarely wake before 10:30 and usually when they do, then <br/>
never even come and see if I&#39;m up. I have a tendency to stay in my room even <br/>
after I&#39;m awake. It&#39;s at the back of the house and no phone. Like my own <br/>
little cave!! My mother also has an adjoining apt. to our house and the kids <br/>
frequently go there as they know she&#39;s always up early and willing to play.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1) Husband takes them - he tries to have them 1 - 3 hours a day while <br/>
I work out or go write, or whatever<br/>
<br/>
2) Daycare at the gym - I use sparingly, but when necessary. Usually <br/>
once or twice a week while I swim or take a yoga class<br/>
<br/>
3) Childcare swapping with other homeschooling families. Sometimes <br/>
this takes the form of a dropoff playdate. Sometimes we get 3 or 4 <br/>
moms together and we take turns doing something like going for walks <br/>
together while the other moms are with the kids - 30 minutes at a <br/>
time. In the summer, we would have a group of 3 or 4 families go to <br/>
the beach or to the lake and we&#39;d take turns hiking, bike riding, <br/>
running, or swimming. <br/>
<br/>
4) Time when the kids are home - this is trickier. We have a family <br/>
movie night once a week, and usually the next morning the kids want <br/>
to watch the movie again before we turn it in. They watch it as a DVD <br/>
on my computer upstairs. I&#39;ve started using this time to rent movies <br/>
that my DH doesn&#39;t want to see, and I go downstairs and ride my <br/>
bicycle on my indoor trainer while I watch a movie on the TV down <br/>
there. The kids usually come down once or twice in the hour and a <br/>
half, but that&#39;s better than trying to constantly answer questions <br/>
when I&#39;m sweating and out of breath.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I try to be creative, but I always make time each day for <br/>
myself and my own goals. It&#39;s important for me, since I have things I <br/>
want to accomplish that I can&#39;t always do with the kids, and I think <br/>
it&#39;s also important to the kids. They like the fact that I do my <br/>
things too, and they like to share with me when they can (like when I <br/>
read my writing out loud to edit it, my son loves to listen, and they <br/>
both like to come and watch when I compete in triathlons). When I&#39;m <br/>
not with them, they get to spend one-on-one time with their dad, <br/>
which lets him be a more integral part of their lives, and when <br/>
that&#39;s not possible, I try to make sure they&#39;re somewhere that they <br/>
want to be (with friends, etc.)</div>
