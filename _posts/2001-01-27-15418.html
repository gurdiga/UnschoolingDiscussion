&gt; WASHINGTON -- The White House said Friday that President Bush will oppose<br/>
oil<br/>
&gt; and gas drilling off Florida’s coast because the state’s governor, his<br/>
&gt; brother Jeb, opposes it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, a presidential spokesman said the White House will review one<br/>
&gt; controversial site off the coast of Pensacola before making any firm<br/>
decision<br/>
&gt; regarding that particular lease.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jeb Bush met with a number of White House officials Friday -- including<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; president -- but was not available to comment on the issue of oil<br/>
drilling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He opposes any drilling whatsoever, as do most politicians in Florida.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; During the presidential campaign, George W. Bush said he would evaluate<br/>
each<br/>
&gt; case before deciding whether to allow current leases to be used by oil<br/>
&gt; companies. He said the country needs more domestic oil production in order<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; reduce reliance on foreign producers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; His campaign Web site said that Bush supports &quot;the moratorium against new<br/>
&gt; leases for oil and gas drilling off the coasts of California and Florida.<br/>
&gt; Will work with California and Florida leaders and local affected<br/>
communities<br/>
&gt; to determine on a case-by-case basis whether or not drilling should go<br/>
&gt; forward on existing leases.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On Friday, however, the White House said Bush’s position always has been<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; of deference to the governors involved -- which is good news for<br/>
&gt; environmentalists, the tourist industry and many of Florida’s politicians.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;If the governors are for banning offshore drilling off their coasts, he<br/>
&gt; would support them in their efforts,&quot; said White House spokesman Scott<br/>
&gt; McClellan. &quot;He will support the governor’s decision.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, McClellan said the White House would not totally rule out<br/>
drilling<br/>
&gt; off the Pensacola coast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Chevron is suing federal officials to win approval to drill for gas under<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; 1980s lease that was frozen by then-President Bush. That site is called<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Destin Dome. Chevron has said it spent $125 million drilling exploratory<br/>
&gt; wells there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;There’s a process, and the Interior Department is involved and we’re<br/>
going<br/>
&gt; to review it,&quot; McClellan said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Opponents of drilling worry that spills could damage the environment,<br/>
which<br/>
&gt; would hurt the state’s fishing and tourism industries.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Florida’s economy is based upon tourism and other activities that depend<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; a clean and healthy environment,&quot; Jeb Bush wrote in a letter to the<br/>
Interior<br/>
&gt; Department in which he stated his opposition to drilling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But Jeb Bush passed on the chance to talk publicly about the issue Friday.<br/>
&gt; After he and 16 other governors met with the president to discuss<br/>
education<br/>
&gt; reforms, the other governors met with reporters on the White House front<br/>
&gt; lawn. Jeb Bush stuck his head out the door of the West Wing, looked around<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; the swarm of reporters and went back inside.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Florida’s governor acknowledged at his brother’s inauguration last week<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; the two likely would find themselves clashing over some policy issues.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oil drilling was seen as one potentially troublesome issue, because of<br/>
George<br/>
&gt; W. Bush’s belief that new sources of oil must be found.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Such differences, Florida’s governor said, would be &quot;part of the complex<br/>
&gt; relationship between the federal government and a large state like<br/>
Florida.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But the biggest disputes with Washington, he pointed out, don’t arise<br/>
solely<br/>
&gt; from policy differences, but from not having a say in the decision-making.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I think we will be given a heads-up more often than not on things that it<br/>
&gt; would be good to know about in advance,&quot; Jeb Bush said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jeb Bush’s office said he had a series of meetings Friday with White House<br/>
&gt; officials, including top strategist Karl Rove, top adviser Clay Johnson<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; counsel Al Gonzales. He also met with Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fort Lauderdale,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; 50 or more staff aides to Florida lawmakers. One of them asked how he<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; get along with the new White House, and he said they might disagree on<br/>
&gt; offshore drilling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The governor’s staff said he planned to talk about education, immigration<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; offshore drilling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;All we can tell you is he is up there meeting with officials about issues<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; importance to Florida,&quot; said Jeb Bush spokeswoman Liz Hirst. She said Bush<br/>
&gt; mentioned Thursday that he hoped to discuss a number of issues -- from<br/>
&gt; education to keeping Florida’s coastal waters free of oil-drilling rigs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517576063">I would like to get back to discussing unschooling. I joined this list to help me with my children, not to continue to discuss politics. Is this list a political discussion to advance our individual political views or a list to help one another toward being the best hs moms we can be. I will admit to everyone that I am a conservative, Christian, Mormon, mom. I do not like negative articles against the new presidency. ect. that have been going on with this list for the last few days.  I do accept everyone&#39;s views and their right to have them. But, I need your imput on the how to&#39;s of hs and unschooling in particular. Your ideas and successes are what I joined this for.  Carol<br/>
