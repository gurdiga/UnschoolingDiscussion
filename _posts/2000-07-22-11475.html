<div id="ygrps-yiv-642552387">Hello all.  My name is Kim and I am unschooling 3 of my 4 boys.  My youngest <br/>
is 5 so he isn&#39;t offically schooling yet.  This was my first year and I loved <br/>
it.  I was wondering if anyone on this list lives near Youngstown, Ohio area? <br/>
 I get my assessment tommorow and I am nervous about it because my children <br/>
did more computer work and hands on things.  I  now have a camera and video <br/>
camera to use so I guess this will help for next year.  How does everyone <br/>
keep track for all the projects and such?  Thanks so much for the answers to <br/>
these questions.</div>
