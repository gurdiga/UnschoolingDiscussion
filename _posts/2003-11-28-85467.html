<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921731995">Or, I wonder if anyone has ever tried Advent cookies? Bake a different  kind<br/>
every day, with the children helping all along and then setting out the<br/>
plate each afternoon to be eaten before the next day? You could put<br/>
peppermint  chips in sugar cookies the first day, then use green food<br/>
coloring, etc and  lead up to shape cookies and sprinkles as the Big Day<br/>
nears.<br/>
 Hmm --  JJ<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a recipe for pinwheels to make at advent.<br/>
<br/>
6oz sugar<br/>
4oz soft butter<br/>
1 beaten egg<br/>
1 tsp vanilla<br/>
6oz SR flour, sifted with a pinch of salt<br/>
1oz plain chocolate<br/>
<br/>
Add sugar to creamed butter, blending it until light. Mix in beaten egg and<br/>
vanilla, then add flour.<br/>
Now divide the dough in half. Add to one half, 1oz melted chocolate. If the<br/>
dough seems soft, chill for awhile until it can be easily rolled. Then roll<br/>
the plain and chocolate doughs separately into oblongs, the thickness of<br/>
1/8&quot;. Place the chocolate dough on top of the plain one and carefully roll<br/>
the layers up like a swiss roll. Cut your cookies off the roll end, place on<br/>
a greased baking sheet, bake at 400F for 8-10 minutes. Allow to cool on cake<br/>
racks.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have been longing for Christmas to come since October!! So we are<br/>
definitely celebrating Advent this year. I made up a calendar for Nov/Dec<br/>
and the kids decorated it with Christmassy things and  have been crossing<br/>
off the days to go. We are putting up the tree tomorrow and then on the 6th<br/>
we will celebrate Samichlaus-read a story of St Nicholas and have a little<br/>
present/treat waiting for them in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
It breaks the time up. Waiting 1 day to put the tree up then 7 days to<br/>
Samichlaus....much easier than waiting 27 days till Christmas. I think<br/>
helping them to buy small presents for  one another and wrapping them up<br/>
secretly helps them to understand how we feel about giving gifts to them.<br/>
