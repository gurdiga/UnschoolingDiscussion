<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482419985">I&#39;ll second the Avent.  Our D-i-L has used it for 2 babies now<br/>
and it is not only efficient, but cheap and easy to use anywhere.<br/>
She mainly uses it on long car trips, to pump and feed<br/>
immediately, when it is impractical to stop and nurse.<br/>
<br/>
I used a Medela and was pleased with it.  It was faster than the<br/>
Avent, but my needs were more for speed than portability.<br/>

<br/>
You could carry on anyway.  Breastfeeding does *not* cause cavities.  My<br/>
oldest granddaughter had to have her top front teeth pulled around age two<br/>
because they were so decayed.  The dentist tried to pull that &quot;breastfeeding<br/>
at night causes cavities&quot; thing on her, but she had done her research.<br/>
Number two grandson is now 2, and his teeth are fine.  No difference between<br/>
them in terms of night nursing.<br/>
<br/>
A friend recently confided in me that the reason she weaned her 2 year old<br/>
was because the dentist told her to.  Her son had the same problem.  She was<br/>
so disappointed because she hadn&#39;t been able to nurse her first and wanted<br/>
to nurse this one longer.  I wish she&#39;d mentioned it before she weaned him.<br/>
I would have told her to ask the dentist to point her to research that<br/>
proves what he was saying.  He wouldn&#39;t have been able to.<br/>
