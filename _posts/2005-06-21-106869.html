<div id="ygrps-yiv-869819229">Caffeine is a health and spiritual hazard that may cost you your  eternal <br/>
life. ...<br/>
<br/>
(saw that on a google link when I went looking for cold beverage dangers I  <br/>
used to read about somewhere, pre-internet days)<br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s their full explanation of that:<br/>
-=-Caffeine is a health and spiritual hazard that may cost you your eternal  <br/>
life. One study showed that increasing consumption of caffeine causes a  <br/>
corresponding decrease in religious involvement as measured by church  attendance. <br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe  it&#39;s the other way around.  People decide to stop living lives of  <br/>
controlled deprivation and think maybe they could also drink tea or  soda.   Our <br/>
church always had a ton of available  coffee.<br/>
 <br/>
Those  were considered to be facts against evolution, I guess, because at the <br/>
bottom of  the page it said this:<br/>
