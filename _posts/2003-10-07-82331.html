&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve also seen something in better toy stores that&#39;s a trapezoid <br/>
shape.  You pluck the strings with a pick.  They come with papers you can <br/>
slide between the strings and the body of the instrument that show you what <br/>
string to pluck when to play tunes.  I haven&#39;t tried one, but I know <br/>
parents who think they&#39;re wonderful. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have one of those I got used but a string broke.  You&#39;re reminding me to <br/>
GET IT FIXED.  I LOVE THOSE!!<br/>
<br/>
And I wrote out some of my own pages.  VERY very fun.  You just follow the <br/>
notes right under the strings and kids can play songs right away.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She could teach herself from a book, but sometimes it helps to have someone <br/>
available who can answer questions.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yep, what Tia said.<br/>
<br/>
I learned guitar, recorder and calligraphy with one lesson and then went and <br/>
finished on my own, but each had things someone else had to show me and tell <br/>
me, and once I had someone spot me on how to hold stuff, how hard to press or <br/>
blow, etc., I was good to go.  <br/>
<br/>
I had tried to learn calligraphy on my own but there were two or four simple <br/>
matters I just couldn&#39;t figure out without watching and having a witness to my <br/>
attempts.<br/>
