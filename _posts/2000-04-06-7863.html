<div id="ygrps-yiv-383060624">Hi!<br/>
I remember when my dd was appx 5 or 6 she would continually tell me she<br/>
had finished reading on of her books.  I would just nod my head and tell<br/>
her that&#39;s great honey.  It took me another week to realize that she<br/>
actually was reading them.  I don&#39;t have any idea how she learned, but I<br/>
do know she did it herself I can&#39;t take any credit for it.  She did the<br/>
same with her math.  One day she just came up out of the blue and<br/>
started asking me questions about dividing. I in all of my infinite<br/>
wisdom told her we would need to look at multiplication first.  She then<br/>
told me she already knew how to multiply and showed me.  I not sure how<br/>
this happened, but am thrilled that it did. Kyle</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-892424337">That sounds like mine.  I could read at 2 and I got so tired of school by<br/>
5th grade.  My teacher&#39;s favorite was she daydreams alot.  Little did<br/>
they know they were boring.<br/>
