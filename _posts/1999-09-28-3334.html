We made bird feeders from 2 liter bottles - don&#39;t see why the smaller ones<br/>
wouldn&#39;t work.  We bought cheap plastic bowls and screwed them into the<br/>
base with about 5 screws.  Then in the cap we screwed in a circular loop.<br/>
Attached a coat hanger wire and they worked wonderfully!  The hardest part<br/>
is filling them - I now use a cut off milk carton that fits over the bottle<br/>
neck.  We loose a little seed but not much.<br/>

the vehicle. He got the design out of a book. Also, our homeschool group<br/>
recently had a &quot;Boat Science&quot; day and we used quite a few plastic bottles<br/>
as parts of various boats, since plastic (with caps on) floats so well. <br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple of ideas from the TV show ZOOM:<br/>

We have a big box of recycled materials that we keep for these kinds of<br/>
projects, although it is stuffed beyond its limits! I guess we need to make<br/>
some more creations.<br/>

They are basically terrariums created out of l or 2 liter bottles.  Some of <br/>
them are quite complex, with a number of different bottles nested on top of <br/>
each others, with different micro environments to interact with each other.  <br/>
Look for the listings with some mention of bottle biology. I haven&#39;t done any <br/>
of these yet, but they look really nifty.  <br/>
