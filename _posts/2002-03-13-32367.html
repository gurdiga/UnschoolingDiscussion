<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144843409">I have to say Bridgett- that my son is very happy being oblivious. (I mean that in a nice way!) He doesnt notice that he doesnt get things, and when I LET GO of the expectation that he would be different (and get everything when I THOUGHT he shcould ) we all did better!!!!!<br/>
I love unschooling - it has worked so far for us!<br/>
God bless<br/>

I understand what you mean.  Give it lots of time though.  AND my <br/>
biggest thing has always been the happiness test.  If my son, or one <br/>
of my daughters is unhappy, I look at things more seriously.  If they <br/>
are cruising along contentedly, I try to leave things be.<br/>

&gt; Well I feel as though he will need more school like activities <br/>
someday because he is not someone who can read something and <br/>
comprehend it or be able to write it in his own words. I think he may <br/>
have a slight learning disability. Some kind of problem integrating <br/>
what he is seeing and putting it into words. Now what he may or may <br/>
not have is irrelevant and that is why we are learning at home. I did <br/>
NOT want him labeled. Again that is why we brought him home after <br/>
being in PS for Kindergarten and First grade. <br/>
