&gt; Jayn if it was true she told me &quot;no&quot;. She also could give no reason for<br/>
&gt; saying it - I suspect she was trying to find out what would happen. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is such a hurtful phrase.  We had something like this happen a while ago <br/>
with a schooled friend of my boys.  We were at his house and they were <br/>
playing not too far away.  My son started crying hysterically, which led to the <br/>
schooled boy calling my son names and made it worse (another story).  But anyway <br/>
he said he was crying because he accidentally bumped the boy and the boy got <br/>
mad and said &quot;your not my friend anymore.&quot;  Dallen was crushed to think that he <br/>
had lost a friend.  He apologized and asked what he could do to make it up to <br/>
the boy and he didn&#39;t budge &quot;no friendship.&quot;  I took Dallen off to talk and <br/>
the mother stepped in while we were away and demanded that the child apologize <br/>
for what he said and ordered him to be friends again. (Not what I had in mind.) <br/>
 Dallen got over it pretty quickly, although he was shaken by the events and <br/>
we had to talk about why the boy&#39;s Mom made him apologize and all this when we <br/>
got home.  They are friends again.  The other boy seems to have forgotten.  <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t go over much and this boy doesn&#39;t visit much but it was hard for me. <br/>
 I had to cry to Teresa about it and talk a while to get it out of my system. <br/>
 She had to explain that kids in public school are like this.  Friends one <br/>
minute and not another and friends again the next day.  My boys are just not <br/>
like that.  They are friends with everyone and will play with anyone.  I have <br/>
never heard them take away their friendship over something, they usually talk <br/>
about problems and try to compromise etc.  I am so proud of them but it hurts to <br/>
see them hurt.  I guess that is part of being a parent.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, way too long for me.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know exactly what you mean.  My boys and this Schooled child are very <br/>
similar.  What I decided to do it this.  We only have the boys over when his <br/>
parents can come as well.  So when my boys ask to see him I say &quot;lets make a <br/>
cook-out out of it&quot; or something like that.  He seems to behave better if his parents <br/>
are here.  Also we go and do things with lots of homeschooled children so <br/>
they are building new friendships.  This boy&#39;s Mom works for my husband so they <br/>
have been friends since they were small.  My boys have started to develop a <br/>
friendship with Teresa&#39;s son.  And they have started to ask if JP can come over <br/>
instead of this schooled child.  Etc.  It has worked for us and I am not taking <br/>
away their friend.<br/>
<br/>
I call him the schooled child as he is the only friend they have that goes to <br/>
public school.  <br/>

You&#39;ll probably get a bunch of suggestions on how to respond to the <br/>
situation.  But I think you have done the right thing by your little girl.  We had the <br/>
same problem here with a little boy who had the same concept of &quot;sharing&quot; as <br/>
Jayn&#39;s friend.  My son would become all crazy and violent around him, they were <br/>
constantly at each other&#39;s throats.  First, I decided to have them play only <br/>
when I was right with them, then I started limited their contact all together. <br/>
 The final straw for me was when my son asked me where hell was and why he <br/>
would want to go there!  I&#39;m still dealing with the &quot;you&#39;re not my friend <br/>
anymore&quot; thing, but it&#39;s happening less and less.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone has people that are toxic to them.  I think little kids do too.  <br/>
Sometimes adults have a hard time eliminating the toxic people in their lives, I <br/>
think it would be almost impossible for a not even four year old to do it.  My <br/>
five year old has been able to reduce his contact with an eight year old <br/>
neighbor because he was teased incessantly and decided it wasn&#39;t worth it to be <br/>
friends with him.  We talked about it a lot, but he reached the decision on his <br/>
own.  Just a few months ago, he couldn&#39;t have done that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so happy Jayn has you to help her navigate her social world.  Some <br/>
parents (like someone&#39;s soccer coach recently) would make the kid stick it out to <br/>
toughen them up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was just thinking when I read Robyn&#39;s  post about Jayn and how the other <br/>
girl bullies her about how well my kids have gotten along with other <br/>
homeschoolers.  Most especially the unschoolers we know.   ( Which is just Pam and her <br/>
boys and one other family with 3 kids)    It is so refreshing and really amazing <br/>
( coming from a school environment) to see kids just all play and get along!  <br/>
 Hardly ever,  ( I&#39;m thinking if it has been ever?)  do the kids come up at <br/>
play day or any other hs activity and whine and cry about some other kid.  You <br/>
do not hear name calling or bullying.   All the kids pretty much share thier <br/>
stuff or politely decline to share. ( not in a mean spirited, selfish way)   <br/>
The only time anybody has got hurt at play day was when JP accidentally hit a <br/>
little girl in the mouth with a hockey stick.  He was swinging it around.   The <br/>
little girl had a bloody mouth, and she was pretty traumatized, but everyone <br/>
was very understanding that he didnt mean to do it.  I thought.. dag, if he had <br/>
been at school and an accident like that happened, they would probably have <br/>
called me to come get him..  Hell, we would probably be involved in a law suit <br/>
right now.. lol.   But the kids at play day do not hit or kick or yell at each <br/>
other.  If there is any animosity or squabbles, it&#39;s usually between <br/>
siblings.   It&#39;s so cool.!   My kids do not have public school friends.    Our <br/>
neighbors avoid us... maybe avoid is a strong word,.. we just don&#39;t cross paths.    <br/>
The only children that go to school that my friends play with are their <br/>
cousins.   That is not too bad, cause when their cousins exhibit typical school yard <br/>
behavior, we can tell them what we think about it.. LOL.  And, really, none of <br/>
them are &quot;bad&quot;... Although, one cousin JP&#39;s age did strongarm him into <br/>
trading his best imaginext figures for some lameo lego men.  JP really didnt want to <br/>
trade... I was not with them when he traded, and JP was bummed when Levi went <br/>
home with his prized &quot;men&quot;   I told him that maybe we can ask Levi next time <br/>
we go to his house if we can trade back.  <br/>
