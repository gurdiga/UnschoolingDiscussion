<div id="ygrps-yiv-608629518">we went to the library book sale twice this weekend. the first time i was <br/>
&quot;chaperoned&quot; by my 8, 5, and 1 year old, so we got lots of children&#39;s books <br/>
they chose. then i got to go to the clearance/end of sale and bought 3 <br/>
cartons of books and lp&#39;s for $3!!! puppet-making, history, math text, <br/>
bio&#39;s... i am so happy! the staff knows to get out the boxes and handcart <br/>
when they see me coming every fall! lol! $3 wouldn&#39;t even buy a pokemon <br/>
folder and pencil case! unfortunately, i know this firsthand, because our <br/>
staples shopping trip for the sale items only ended in meltdowns when my 5 <br/>
and 8 yo boys saw the display at the checkout! grrrr!<br/>
