<div id="ygrps-yiv-850949144">Tonight, while some of us were eating dinner:<br/>
<br/>
Mikey (5 yr old ds) is going through his candy. I see something with <br/>
white chocolate and mention I really like that.<br/>
<br/>
Mikey: Oh, here, you can have it.<br/>
<br/>
Me: Thanks, I&#39;ll eat it later. [chocolate and rice-a-roni together <br/>
just didn&#39;t seem good to me!]<br/>
<br/>
He finds another candy that dh is interested it and then goes back <br/>
into the living room.<br/>
<br/>
Later on, Mikey is getting another piece of candy for himself and <br/>
reminds me about the one I wanted. He dumps the whole bowl out <br/>
looking for it for me...<br/>
<br/>
Me: I already ate it! Oh, there&#39;s the one Papa wanted to try.<br/>
<br/>
Mikey: Here, Papa, this is the one you like. You can have it.<br/>
<br/>
Dh: Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Mikey: You&#39;re welcome. I love to share.<br/>
<br/>
Dh: &lt;thump&gt; [picks himself up off the floor]<br/>
<br/>
I think to myself that this is probably NOT the same conversation <br/>
going on in most of the houses in our neighborhood.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Seamus bailed out of trick or treating early...went down a few streets <br/>
and then he was done. Just didnt seem worth the effort to get more <br/>
candy than the bagful he had already, since he can have as much candy <br/>
as he wants whenever he wants it. <br/>
<br/>
He ate a mini-bag of chips, and a large Hershey bar (well, half of <br/>
it)...the rest of the candy is just sitting there. I actually found a <br/>
grocery bag full of candy in his bedroom that mightve been from last <br/>
year. I bet we&#39;ll end up throwing away much of this bag too. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not -- I know when I was growing up, we would<br/>
return home, mom would spend time, what would seem to<br/>
be forever, checking the candy, we then could pick<br/>
something like 5 or 10 pieces, and then each child&#39;s<br/>
bag was dumped into one big bag and then locked up by<br/>
my parents.  The end.<br/>
<br/>
When I did occasionally get my hands on candy, I<br/>
didn&#39;t share, but I was constantly forced to do so.  <br/>
<br/>
When my kids got home the other night, they sat down,<br/>
dumped their bags out and went to town.  They decided<br/>
how much to eat.  They decided if they wanted to share<br/>
-- and each child was VERY generous.  I don&#39;t tend to<br/>
eat a lot of candy, but I have a few favorites that<br/>
they know of and they would bring me some so I could<br/>
eat it when I was ready (which most is still sitting<br/>
by the computer).  Even our 4 year old -- &quot;Daddy,<br/>
here&#39;s your favorite!&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524212603">DS went out with SIL (we don&#39;t have what you&#39;d call a neighborhood <br/>
so we go over to ILs to trick or treat). They did a couple of <br/>
streets and came back - DS decided he was tired and didn&#39;t want to <br/>
walk any more. I remember as a kid pushing to the limit of how much <br/>
time we had - we&#39;d do our neighborhood and then mom & dad would <br/>
drive us to a friend&#39;s house (their friend) and they&#39;d sit and drink <br/>
coffee and chat while we went around that development - but there <br/>
was a time limit. So, we&#39;d go right up to the edge of the time <br/>
limit, no matter how tired we were.<br/>
<br/>
Last night we were watching Star Wars episode 3 (hit the stores <br/>
yesterday) and we had the big bin that his candy was in. He would <br/>
roam around through it and offer bits and pieces to us, stuff he <br/>
thought we might like. Some of it will be gone quickly (he&#39;s really <br/>
liking the glow in the dark star wars trivia wrappers on snickers <br/>
and musketeers bars) and some will get dumped in a month or so when <br/>
it&#39;s obvious no one wants it.<br/>
<br/>
It really is so different - calm, peaceful even, not having to <br/>
regulate and control and count each piece.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, my 2.5 yr old shared too...but it&#39;s not usually too appetizing <br/>
after she&#39;s had her hands and mouth on it! Most of her candy is half-<br/>
eaten. She&#39;s interested in seeing what&#39;s in the package, but doesn&#39;t <br/>
finish it unless she wants too. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s soooo weird to see a mini-candy bar half eaten. It&#39;s not <br/>
something my brain can really understand...I supposed I&#39;ll get used to <br/>
it eventually. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it kind of makes my brain twirl when DS (7) eats half a double <br/>
chocolate donut then leaves the other half sitting so he can have a <br/>
grilled cheese sandwich (or whatever else he decides he wants at the <br/>
time that isn&#39;t a chocolate donut) - sometimes he comes back and <br/>
finishes it, sometimes the half donut sits a day or two until it&#39;s <br/>
obvious he doesn&#39;t want it any longer then out it goes. The hardest <br/>
thing was not going ahead and eating it myself (or DH eating <br/>
it) &quot;because it&#39;s there&quot;. We&#39;re eating better (more consciously) by <br/>
learning from DS to listen to our insides as to what we want when and <br/>
when we&#39;re done.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s really sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I have noticed more people being nicer to kids than we used to see. <br/>
  Maybe we&#39;ve just lucked out lately.    But still, commercials and TV <br/>
sitcoms are still glorifying parents being mean and stingy.   <br/>
<br/>
I started to make reference to a commercial but it must be regional, or at <br/>
least won&#39;t be on other continents.   A teen is caught by parents as he comes in <br/>
his bedroom window with a sandwich and a drink from Subway (a sandwich shop, <br/>
for those foreigners, that makes sandwiches on long buns).   He says &quot;I was <br/>
hungry!&quot;   And the dad says something like &quot;Dinner wasn&#39;t good enough for you?&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
They take the food away from him and eat it in the hallway, laughing at him <br/>
while he apologizes and promises not to do it again, through the bedroom door.<br/>
<br/>
Tacky.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s   not raising kids who will share, or go out on errands for the <br/>
parents at night.<br/>
<br/>
Marty was willing to go and pick Holly and her friend up at the mall last <br/>
night, even though he was playing World of Warcraft, but I thanked him and went <br/>
myself.   He offered, though, when she called.<br/>
<br/>
Partners and not antagonists.   You help them get candy, you get a generous <br/>
cut. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Subways (hq is here in CT) - we get Sonic commercials too and there <br/>
are no Sonics anywhere in the area (boohoo whine sob I miss my <br/>
cherry limeades with extra cherry and Route 44 chocolate cokes!)<br/>
<br/>
One commercial I really hate that&#39;s showing up lately is one where <br/>
the kid is playing soccer and scores a goal and turns to his parents <br/>
all excited. They are sitting there and say Good shot! The kid is <br/>
all happy until they say &quot;not you...him&quot; and point to the <br/>
professional photographer taking pictures of the game...the kid is <br/>
broken hearted, you see him totally deflate even as his teammmates <br/>
are mobbing him and high fiving because it was a game winning goal. <br/>
It just hurts to see that - I literally hide my face or change the <br/>
channel when I see it starting.<br/>

**** This Halloween was full of firsts for us. The first year in a new house/town, first year the kids went their own separate ways instead of together with mutual friends, (hard on Jack, exciting for Moly) first year I took Jack out instead of Darin... Lots of new things to get used to. <br/>
<br/>
It was cold and raining so Jack only went about 6 blocks, but got a pretty good stash. He was happy with it, though I suggested if he wanted I would take him to pick out some more at the store if he felt shorted. He said no thanks and proceeded to list all the good things he had, or was going to have that apparently made up for lack of candy getting time. &lt;g&gt; He said:<br/>
<br/>
We got a new house with a big back yard and I am building a fort. Last time Daddy was home we went out to breakfast. Since Daddy probably won&#39;t be home for your birthday, Moly and I will make a day for you. My friend River will be home from his week at his Dad&#39;s tomorrow and I will get to play with him tomorrow night. When we go get Moly you said we are getting hot chocolate and pie or something on the way home. Daddy said he would be home soon, and he would be home the day before Thanksgiving so we can all go to your doctor and see and hear the baby. And we get to find out if the baby really is a Tinkerbell. (what we are calling the baby) Daddy said after your doctor appointment we are going to get tickets to the new Harry Potter movie so we can go watch it after Thanksgiving dinner. (a family tradition of ours to go see a movie in the evening after the dinner and games.) And then on December 1, we are going to Louisiana to see Grandma and Grandpa and everyone will be there! And<br/>
 Santa will come because he always comes to Grandma&#39;s house. And you bought me a big bag of sours the other day so I still have candy at home. <br/>
<br/>
All of which made me feel really good since I&#39;ve felt that for the past year or so lots of times my kids have gotten the short end of the stick, so to speak. And Jack just proved to me once again that it is never about the big things I do or Darin does, its all the little things we never think about that are important to the kids. Because some of the things he listed to me were big things, but just as many were little ones. And even more importantly what I heard in his words was that he is happy with his life. The past few weeks have been good, the next few weeks are going to be good, and that is what matters to him. The candy was last, and certainly not as important as many other things.<br/>

movie soundtrack music and think it&#39;s just music.   I can watch guys play football <br/>
and not care whether they&#39;re professionals or a midschool team.   <br/>
<br/>
For those who are interested in social movements and children&#39;s rights and <br/>
how culture is passed on or kept static, big clues like million dollar <br/>
commercials can be of interest.<br/>

<br/>
They are just comercials, however unfortunate they reflect real-life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-808552148">Actually, I am into social analysis and children&#39;s rights.  I&#39;m very <br/>
concerned with and frustrated by all forms of child abuse.  I guess I <br/>
got pulled into the comedy of those commercials because they are so <br/>
exagerrated and they&#39;re just selling sandwiches, etc.  Make no <br/>
mistake, I understand how they point out what&#39;s wrong in our society, <br/>
what&#39;s wrong with many PARENTS in our society.  Maybe the <br/>
exagerration will help some families see this.  Although humor is <br/>
used, the underlying message of these commercials seems to be that <br/>
this behavior is not right.  I guess I contradict my initial post in <br/>
which I stated &quot;they&#39;re just commercials.&quot;  But they&#39;ll still get a <br/>
giggle out of me.    <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m way more affected by other commercials, such as one for Sylvan <br/>
Learning Centers (may be regional), in which a teenage boy gives his <br/>
mom his report card as a gift at her birthday party.  He says &quot;Here <br/>
Mom, something you&#39;ve always wanted.&quot; And then she gets tears in her <br/>
eyes as she looks at it and then looks at him with the smile of <br/>
approval he&#39;s been waiting for all of his life.  Sylvan tries to set <br/>
the viewer at ease regarding their children&#39;s failures in <br/>
school.  &quot;Dear Parents, we can help your troubled child get the <br/>
grades YOU&#39;VE always wanted.&quot;  Each of their commercials is like <br/>
this; no exagerration is used.  Now, THAT&#39;S SAD.  <br/>

&gt; If you&#39;re not into social analysis that&#39;s fine.   Some people might <br/>
hear <br/>
&gt; movie soundtrack music and think it&#39;s just music.   I can watch <br/>
guys play football <br/>
&gt; and not care whether they&#39;re professionals or a midschool team.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For those who are interested in social movements and children&#39;s <br/>
rights and <br/>
&gt; how culture is passed on or kept static, big clues like million <br/>
dollar <br/>
&gt; commercials can be of interest.<br/>

so it makes them feel better about themselves and their lives. What <br/>
makes a lot of them &#39;funny&#39; is that people see a commonality between <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953989426">I see your point.  In fact, I can understand now where everyone is <br/>
coming from on this one.  It all has to do with point-of-view.  The <br/>
parents in the commercials acted so ridiculously bad (i.e. standing <br/>
in the hallway greedily gobbling up the sandwich) that I was laughing <br/>
AT them and not WITH them.  And at the time, I really wasn&#39;t thinking <br/>
about the fact that some parents actually treat their teenagers this <br/>
way, because I wouldn&#39;t and no one close to me ever has.  Does this <br/>
make sense to anyone?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037785750">I was watching *Meet the Fockers&quot; last night with Moly and there was a scene where the main characters are all sitting around a patio table. The grand baby is crying and crying in the background and the character played by Barbara Streisand says to the Robert De Nero character; &#39;I think the kid needs a pull or two off that fake boob of yours&#39; and Robert says, &#39;No, we are ferberizering him.&#39; and Barbara says something like, &#39;Ferber! Well The Continuum Concept says we should love and hug and kiss our kids...&#39;  <br/>
 <br/>
And I thought Wow! The Continuum Concept mentioned in a movie, as an alternative to something scary and nasty like the Ferber method. And that all happened after my pregnancy aquarobics class yesterday afternoon. Where a woman was talking about these two books &quot;Becoming Baby Wise&quot; and &quot;Becoming Labor Wise&quot; She just raved and raved about them so after the class I drove to our local Borders and found both. I had not heard about either. I was looking through them, and all I could think was ouch, ewww, and reminding myself that we do live in a free country and all. &lt;g&gt; when another woman from my class came up and smiled and said &#39;You wanted to see what all the fuss was about too, huh?&#39; I handed her the books and said &#39;It wasn&#39;t worth the gas to drive over here.&#39; and I moved on to the baby name books. A little while later I watched her put the books back on the shelf, and she turned to me and said &#39;That was scary!&#39; I told her to go to the Library and check out a book called &quot;The Continuum<br/>
 Concept&quot; and she asked me to repeat it and wrote it down. I&#39;m going to wait a week or so and if she hasn&#39;t mentioned it to me I&#39;m going to bring it up in class. &lt;vbg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
The boy was hungry.<br/>
He&#39;s still hungry.<br/>
And his parents are laughing at him.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m presuming that $6 was money he earned or out of his allowance.   <br/>
<br/>
So he&#39;s out money, still hungry and his parents are laughing at him.<br/>
I don&#39;t like that in my house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143601702">And I think I figured out why I wasn&#39;t so sad when I saw that <br/>
commercial: the boy is a teenager.  I have given this all a good <br/>
amount of thought because I was the only person who felt the <br/>
commercial was funny.  I was thinking &quot;Okay...am I just completely <br/>
insensitive?&quot;  And then I realized that although I would consider <br/>
myself an advocate of children&#39;s rights (in my own quiet way), I <br/>
always think of younger children as those who are most vunerable.  <br/>
I&#39;m forgetting how tender the teenage years can be.  My own babies <br/>
are only 3-1/2 and 1, but I have sisters who are 17, 13 and 11 as <br/>
well as a niece who is 12.  I&#39;m close to all of them, and they&#39;re all <br/>
so mature that I never think of them as children. I&#39;m so thankful to <br/>
all of you on this list who have really opened my eyes to something <br/>
that was literally right in front of them, and I&#39;ll never view that <br/>
darn Subway ad the same again!<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s interesting that you noticed the Subway one too, Deb.  I <br/>
just <br/>
&gt; &gt; told dh that I couldn&#39;t handle it. It made me sad and angry.  Not <br/>
&gt; &gt; funny to me at all.-=-<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I figured out what really   makes me sad about it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The boy was hungry.<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s still hungry.<br/>
&gt; And his parents are laughing at him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I&#39;m presuming that $6 was money he earned or out of his <br/>
allowance.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So he&#39;s out money, still hungry and his parents are laughing at him.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t like that in my house.<br/>

-=- And I think I figured out why I wasn&#39;t so sad when I saw that<br/>
commercial: the boy is a teenager....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids are now 14, 16 and 19.   Two of them drive and have money.   Either <br/>
of them would, if Holly asked, go out and get her some fast food late at night. <br/>
  They have gotten me food sometimes (more taking me out than going out).   <br/>
Yesterday Kirby spent his free-meal credit at work to bring us a set of <br/>
cheese-bread things with dipping sauce (I don&#39;t know their name).   Someone had <br/>
offered to share a pan pizza with him, and he still had a meal credit, so he got <br/>
something to go and brought it straight home for others.   That&#39;s pretty sweet.<br/>
<br/>
I think this generosity is directly attributable to us NOT gettin on them for <br/>
where they go or how they spend their money, and not shaming them for being <br/>
hungry and having the maturity and wherewithal to do something about it.   And <br/>
they don&#39;t HAVE to sneak in and out their bedroom windows, because we trust <br/>
them and they trust us.<br/>
<br/>
So in that light, the commercial was irritating.   That&#39;s all.   Life can be <br/>
better than that.   The relationship portrayed in that commercial might make <br/>
some parents thing &quot;Those folks are mean,&quot; but I think it will make 50 times <br/>
that many parents thing &quot;YEAH!   Our team won, and another kid was put in his <br/>
place.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think the more that adversarial relationships are glorified, the less <br/>
likely people are going to be to question them.<br/>

That is so cute!  I&#39;m cracking up right now.  I hope when my daughter <br/>
grows up she does the same thing (comes back into the front door).  I <br/>
never snuck out of my own house, but I snuck out of friends&#39; houses. <br/>
We would travel very far from home on foot just to meet up with other <br/>
friends and tee-pee houses, etc.  I cringe to think of what COULD <br/>
have happened to us.  I mean, it was around 3:00AM and we were 14 <br/>
years old!  I was given a lot of freedom as a teen, but I abused it.  <br/>
My parents never knew about the trouble I would get into!  I&#39;m so <br/>
thankful for our unschooling life which I know will keep us much <br/>
closer.  I won&#39;t &quot;give&quot; them freedom in exchange for good grades and <br/>
things the was my (well-meaning) folks did.  They will just have it <br/>
as their human right.<br/>

Sarah had to actually throw out the rest of her candy from last year<br/>
