<div id="ygrps-yiv-869747533">&lt;&lt;Any suggestions?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I finally quit worrying about other people&#39;s reactions.  I have been known<br/>
to simply ask &quot;Do the kids seem stupid, dull-witted or somehow backward to<br/>
you?&quot;  And since the response is always &quot;No, they are really bright kids&quot;, I<br/>
then ask &quot;So.....what&#39;s your point?&quot; with a big grin.<br/>
