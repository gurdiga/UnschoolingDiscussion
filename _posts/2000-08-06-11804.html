<div id="ygrps-yiv-186800716">&lt;&lt;so, what happens if you are homeschooling a high school student... with no <br/>
math background except what they&#39;ve learned on their own... and they want to <br/>
go back to high school or on to higher education...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a very interesting question to me because my daughter is opting to go back for her last year of high school. She hasn&#39;t formally studied math in AGES and is trying to get herself motivated to pick it up now for both this coming school year and for the ACT or SAT test.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll be going to a Waldorf school and I&#39;ve told them we&#39;re not really interested in her actually &quot;graduating&quot; (we&#39;ll probably substitute a home-made diploma for the school&#39;s), so probably the pressure won&#39;t be as great. Otoh, she&#39;d prefer not to seem too far behind....<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else with older kids who&#39;ve had to deal with this?<br/>
