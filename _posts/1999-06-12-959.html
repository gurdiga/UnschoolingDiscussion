<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937493626">I picked up the coolest Hallmark graduation card for a friend&#39;s<br/>
daughter. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The outside said:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Congratulations!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The inside said:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Now you get to read the books you really want to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I thought to myself, &quot;What a *perfect* card to give to someone who has<br/>
just escaped the world of conventional schooling!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-922143670">But how incredibly sad that this reality is so wide spread and so well<br/>
recognised that it is on a greeting card, yet so many people continue to<br/>
send their kids off to school, no questions asked.<br/>
