<div id="ygrps-yiv-759288415">THe boy was anticipating a museum trip.<br/>
<br/>
Museum trip cancelled and other arrangements made without his <br/>
consultation.<br/>
<br/>
Boy didn&#39;t want to go.<br/>
********<br/>
I quoted that cause it was convenient and short &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would have told the other Mom that I needed to check with my boy before we <br/>
changed the plans.<br/>
I want to admit that I am guilty of doing  similar things. Sometimes my <br/>

OK, please don&#39;t get me wrong. I have done it in the past but don&#39;t plan on <br/>
doing it in the future. I&#39;m not perfect but I try.<br/>
