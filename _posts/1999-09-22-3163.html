<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247859394">Nanci, my 2&3/4yo dropped her nap ages ago, but I&#39;ve found that if I have to<br/>
lie down with her to go to sleep, and I fall asleep too, we both sleep worse<br/>
and she asks for milk more in the morning.  If I thought she wouldn&#39;t wake<br/>
up, I&#39;d get up earlier than her.  My nearly-4yo (next month...)  gets up<br/>
most mornings about half-an-hour before the rest of us and mooches about,<br/>
watching tv or &#39;reading&#39; then I get up with dd2, and dh gets up much later.<br/>
At this age, it&#39;s difficult to expect the girls not to jump on the bed when<br/>
Daddy&#39;s resting, and that causes some friction.  As does dh&#39;s penchant for<br/>
evening &#39;naps,&#39; especially when I don&#39;t know he&#39;s taking them and I&#39;m having<br/>
some &#39;puter time, ie kids get left in front of a video or Tom and Jerry or<br/>
summat (grrrrrr!)<br/>
<br/>
Can you get him to wake up earlier from his nap, as oppose to not napping at<br/>
all?  If I got up at 6am I think I&#39;d want a nap!  (I did today, and I got up<br/>
at 8.30am!)<br/>
