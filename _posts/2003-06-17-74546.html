<div id="ygrps-yiv-619675655">I&#39;ve been thinking about this whole bathing suit thing that I said or people thought I said awhile back. I&#39;ve been thinking about it because some people seem to think I&#39;m talking about size when I wasn&#39;t. And I was thinking about it because tonight on the news I see this 52 year old lady who lives in an association and wears a thong bathing suit to the pool. Some people living there have a big problem with her doing so and they are trying to take measures to make her suit up!! The condo has an attorney and she does too.<br/>
<br/>
Now she looks not bad for 52 and certainly better than some and not as good as others. If I looked like her I wouldn&#39;t be wearing a thong. But that&#39;s me. I didn&#39;t wear one years ago when I looked better. I&#39;m on her side. No rules about it and why should she not be able to wear it. <br/>
<br/>
So the whole bathing suit comment was made in the context of shopping and having to look at someone in a bathing suit in a place where I don&#39;t expect to see someone half dressed. At the pool and at the beach I don&#39;t sit around and mention who should be wearing what. I&#39;m at the pool or beach, a bathing suit of any kind is appropriate. I don&#39;t invite only people over to my pool that weigh in at 120 or less.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m not passing judgement on how people chose to look, just would like them to keep it where reasonable.<br/>

I&#39;ll speak for myself here.  *I* thought you were referring to size because <br/>
I said something about my husband and I running around Walmart in a bikini <br/>
to embarrass each other.  I also mentioned I am a size 22 (on a good day) <br/>
-24 (on a well fed one &lt;g&gt;).  If I recall, that was the first mention of fat <br/>
people in bikinis.<br/>
<br/>
You came back and replied, &quot;I&#39;m sorry but&quot; and something close to I just <br/>
don&#39;t want to see some people in a string bikini.  So that, to ME sounded as <br/>
if you were referring to fat people.  It was all in context with fat people <br/>
in bikini&#39;s, hence the confusion.<br/>

I don&#39;t remember seeing the part about a size in your post. I guess that&#39;s<br/>
why I was so confused about you thinking I was getting personal. How would I<br/>
know what you look like??<br/>
<br/>
And did you say you were fat? Do you think you are fat? I know lots of<br/>
larger people than me that I wouldn&#39;t think of as fat? I know lots of<br/>
smaller people that might think I was fat. (don&#39;t know cause they haven&#39;t<br/>
really said)<br/>
It&#39;s all depends on how one looks at one&#39;s self. Be confident and beautiful<br/>
in your own right. Be proud and strut your stuff no matter what size it is.<br/>
(just not in a bikini in Walmart!) LOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
And again the last parts were general. I&#39;m not saying YOU have a problem<br/>
with how you see yourself.<br/>
