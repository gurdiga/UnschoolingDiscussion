that shine the sink thing. <br/>

anything.  But I can see her point about having a clean sink.  I can make <br/>
mine sparkle without the bleach.<br/>

Yes, I think you are right, though I think she suggests using Clorox when<br/>
you shine it the very first time.<br/>

Pardon my ignorance, but I thought spam was when you were plugging your own<br/>
business, not sharing a link where you found a good deal.  So is the link I<br/>
sent to THe Natural Parenting Project a spam because I said I bought a<br/>
bumper sticker there?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-138373132">Hi, Angela.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not Joyce (I hope this is okay), but I think the issue is that the <br/>
message Joyce was referring to was an MLM business that the poster was <br/>
directly involved in (I remember that it was in her signature line).  That, <br/>
I think, would fall under the heading of spam.  If I&#39;m wrong about that, <br/>
I&#39;m sure someone will correct me.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-379458848">I&#39;m sorry Sheila, it does just mainly have facts about health. But it is NOT an MLM, I promise!!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just a catalog shopping company with natural products, and if someone wants to build a business with it all they do is refer others to the company, and the company rewards them with commissions. Clear as mud? Anyway, if you want more info, just click on the &quot;get more info&quot; button and I can call you and answer questions, etc. It&#39;s actually a simple idea and I don&#39;t sell any products.<br/>
<br/>
If this isn&#39;t for you, that&#39;s fine, too.<br/>
