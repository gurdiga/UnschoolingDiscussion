 My dd has been out of ps for 12  months now.  Not once have I <br/>
 regreted it.   She is a totally different child.  Every body who <br/>
 knows her will agree with that.<br/>
 Unschooling is the way to go.  I have never doubted that.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

      How old is your dd? My 5 this wed. dd is now voicing that she wants to <br/>
go to school. I am so bummed. I am having nightmares. I always said if my <br/>
child wanted to go I would let s/he. I decided when I was very young I would <br/>
school through life,I had no idea there was even such a thing as <br/>
unschooling,honestly. School was so bad for me I knew what would be right. <br/>
Now what? I could cry thinking of it. I am afraid if she does attend she&#39;ll <br/>
come out a different child. Or what if K is fun and she decideds to keep <br/>
going and by say 8 wants out. Then I have 4 years to unravel. <br/>
<br/>
   This kid is so spirited and different I fear how it will go. She still <br/>
pretends to be a dog 1/2 the day and we have to call her Jenna the dog and <br/>
treat her as a dog. She still occaisionally makes dog faces at mean kids in <br/>
the playground. She really isn&#39;t an extrovert though the way she is w/ dh and <br/>
I you&#39;d think she was. She clams up w/ other kids and adults. This is fine by <br/>
us and we understand her personality. I can see the first time she gets told <br/>
to not do something or corrected.she will be crushed. I am so concerned for <br/>
her self esteem. School ruined me along w/ my mother&#39;s controling I became <br/>
someone else to make it through.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   I would love to go off on why she doesn&#39;t want to go but I feel that would <br/>
be brainwashing or coersive. What to do?<br/>
<br/>
   Any advice? NICKI~</div>

 </span></blockquote>Everything you tell her about the world right now is brainwashing and<br/>
coercive. You can&#39;t give her the reasoning powers that she will eventually<br/>
mature into.  You have to just state a whole world of facts as if they are a<br/>
given.  We don&#39;t eat rat poison, we just DO NOT.  We don&#39;t stick our hands<br/>
into the garbage disposal, and no one is going to stick a hand down there to<br/>
show you why.  Something else maybe, but not a hand.<br/>
<br/>
**I can see the first time she gets told<br/>

<br/>
Parents are supposed to prevent these kind of crushing blows.  It&#39;s<br/>
perfectly all right for you to tell her no until she&#39;s old enough to<br/>
understand and take measures to protect herself.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, try very hard to include my children in almost all decisions. I,<br/>
too, have told them that if they ever want to try school we&#39;ll seriously<br/>
discuss the matter. But only after they are high school age would they have<br/>
the final say.<br/>
<br/>
Never coercing anything is just as off balanced as always coercing<br/>
everything.</div>

My dd was 11yrs old when i removed her from school. She never did <br/>
like school and at 11yes old became very depressed and refused to <br/>
go.  I did find out she was being bullied. But that was just the last <br/>
straw.<br/>
She loves her new independence.  Doing what she wants and being <br/>
herself. <br/>

  My oldest dd attended ps for her Kindergarten year.  With the exception of<br/>
liking her teacher, the only other thing she seemed to mention constantly<br/>
was the child that was continually in trouble.  I didn&#39;t send her to school<br/>
to focus on that.  I don&#39;t remember there being a lot of fighting from her<br/>
when we decided to homeschool.  It seemed that the only time the subject was<br/>
brought up was when she had been around ps children.<br/>
My second child I homeschooled for 1 year and because of other happenings, I<br/>
thought I would put him in ps.  I, like you, had nightmares and uneasy<br/>
feelings about the whole situation.  I should have listened to my<br/>
uneasiness.  Six weeks into ps, &quot;THEY&#39; decided that my ds needed to be put<br/>
back into the 1st grade.  Needless to say we pulled ds out of ps. <br/>
Unfortunately he still feels as if he &quot;doesn&#39;t do well at ps&quot;.  I say if you<br/>
can avoid any possible physcological damage, at any cost, do it.  Your<br/>
daughter will soon realize that being with mommy at home is more enjoyable<br/>
than being with 30-40 kids at school.  <br/>
You can do it!!   Kate<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-79228066">We have &#39;mental muscles&#39; that need a certain amount of<br/>
exercise, just like our physical muscles do, or they<br/>
will atrophy.  Children need a certain amount of<br/>
stress, or their ability to deal with the natural<br/>
stresses of life as adults will atrophy.  Our jobs as<br/>
parents is to make sure that their voices are heard in<br/>
the setting of reasonable boundaries, and that they do<br/>
not doubt our love and support while they are facing<br/>
the natural stressors of life (including bumping up<br/>
against those boundaries and getting frustrated with<br/>
them).  If they do not experience a certain amount of<br/>
frustration, pain, and stress during their<br/>
childhood... the time in which you can model<br/>
identification of more painful/intense emotions,<br/>
stress-reducing, problem solving and empathy processes<br/>
for them so that they can learn how to effectively<br/>
deal with these inevitable experiences... they will be<br/>
left vulnerable and helpless when they leave home as<br/>
adults.  It is painful for any loving parent to see<br/>
their child experience pain and even suffering, and<br/>
certainly we don&#39;t want our children to experience<br/>
more pain than they can<br/>
(developmentally/personality-wise) handle, but the<br/>
best favor we can do them is teaching them effective<br/>
skills for *handling* those experiences, not<br/>
protecting them from ever experiencing them at all!<br/>

That is a concern that I have.  One reason why I&#39;d like to NOT let my<br/>
kids &quot;try&quot; school until they are confident in their ability to learn.  It<br/>
is all to easy for kids in school to &quot;learn&quot; that they are not good at<br/>
reading, writing, or arithmetic.  <br/>
