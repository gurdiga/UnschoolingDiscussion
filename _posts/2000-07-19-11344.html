<div id="ygrps-yiv-95798215">Thanks for your response Amy!  Could you tell me what the other symptoms<br/>
were that your kids had to support the asthma theory?<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s too bad that you didn&#39;t get any of our messages. There were several<br/>

&gt; and make sure it&#39;s not something else, mainly asthma. At one point or<br/>
&gt; another, when all three of my kids were babies they had what I assumed to be<br/>
&gt; croup and it was not. Two of them over the next couple of days were<br/>
&gt; diagnosed with RSV and all 3 of them eventually got diagnosed with asthma.<br/>
&gt; Turns out 2 of them have cold induced asthma, which was I thought it was<br/>
&gt; croup. They had other symptoms to support my theroy. Anyway, now we have<br/>
&gt; nebulizers and inhalers to get us throught these tough times. This is not<br/>
&gt; exactly what I wrote in my first post, but I think it&#39;s close :) Ohters had<br/>
&gt; good ideas about homeopathic remedies, etc. If I get a chance I&#39;ll dig<br/>

&gt; &gt; A few days ago I was DESPERATE for info anyone might have regarding<br/>
&gt; &gt; Croup.  The server was down though and I did not get any messages for 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; days.  I was wondering if anyone did respond to my plea and if anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; did would they mind re-issuing me their response.  My 22 month old has<br/>
&gt; &gt; had croup about 4 or 5 times.  No one else in our family ever had it and<br/>
&gt; &gt; my other two children have been free and clear.  I know about the steam<br/>
&gt; &gt; or cold air trick but if anyone had something further to offer, I&#39;m all<br/>
&gt; &gt; ears<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We are all really sick now as a family...barking like dogs with vicious<br/>
&gt; &gt; coughs that don&#39;t permit sleep...<br/>
