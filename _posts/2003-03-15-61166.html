That movie and songs in it are near to my heart because my parents had the<br/>
soundtrack when we (sisters and I) were kids and we would always listen to<br/>
it on long drives in the car. I know every song very well. Must&#39;ve listened<br/>

aren&#39;t into musicals, even this kind. They watched it for about 2 minutes<br/>
and said it was dumb!<br/>
I was kinda dissapointed but just watched it myself and for some reason,<br/>
almost every song brought tears to my eyes and strong feelings of emotion!<br/>
It&#39;s a great movie - I really liked it. I understand that the movie can&#39;t<br/>
mean to my kids what it means to me and that they&#39;d much rather watch Spy<br/>
Kids. &lt;g&gt; At least I can watch and enjoy that with them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I played in the pit orchestra for that 5 years ago.  I loved it.  By the end<br/>
of several rehearsals and 12 performances, I knew most of the dialog by<br/>
heart.  That show was especially fun because Lars was on the stage crew.<br/>
Because the crew had to be on stage during the performance moving things<br/>
around, they had to be in costume.  So they gave him some bit parts.  It was<br/>
fun glancing up on stage wondering what they were going to have him doing<br/>
that night.  About halfway through, a couple of the kids who actually had<br/>
parts in the wedding scene got in trouble for goofing around during the<br/>
performance and lost those parts.  The next night I looked up and there was<br/>
Lars holding the wedding canopy.  Great fun!<br/>

songs by heart.  We used to put on &quot;performances&quot;.  There was a sliding door<br/>
between the big front hall and the dining room.  We used that for a curtain.<br/>
The hall was the stage.  I can remember actually trying to &quot;wash that man<br/>
right outta my hair&quot; in one of those performances. &lt;g&gt;  My kids, on the<br/>
other hand, have not had much interest in musicals.  Even Lars, after that<br/>
experience, wasn&#39;t that keen to do it again.  I tried to get him a chance to<br/>
learn to work the lights and/or sound, but they wanted him older.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-251066564">I love the movie &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; and actually most musicals. But then<br/>
so does my ds, whose 9 next month. I started him on them when he was just a<br/>
toddler. He knows most of the songs as well and will sing along with them,<br/>
too. I think his favourite is &quot;If I Were A Rich Man&quot;. It&#39;s a great movie to<br/>
learn from. How traditions get changed ( the daughters different marriages),<br/>
religious intolerance, politics. If any of you have the chance to watch it<br/>
with your kids, do. You won&#39;t regret it. We own this  movie, so we watch<br/>
fairly regularly, and my son always gets something new out of it. Something<br/>
he missed before.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share,<br/>
