<div id="ygrps-yiv-338028264">26. In the past week have you felt stupid?<br/>
Somewhat stupid, but it didn&#39;t last. It never does.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------<br/>
<br/>
That was Holly, in a MySpace survey.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s writing for fun; she doesn&#39;t &quot;have to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I could never count (or even try to, without crying) the number of  <br/>
people I know or have met who felt stupid *forever* because of  <br/>
school, or kids at school, or test scores, or failure at P.E. or  <br/>
sports they never chose in the first place, or because they were in  <br/>
trouble at home, or grounded, or deprived of money or freedom...<br/>
<br/>
Holly doesn&#39;t feel stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Woohoo!!!<br/>

She doesn&#39;t feel stupid.  Sometimes things get her down, but mostly <br/>
it&#39;s circumstantial, and external, not internal, so she finds ways <br/>
to &quot;snap&quot; out of it.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that when you have that internal strength of character <br/>
from having a healthy self respect, you can ward off those icky <br/>
things easier and bounce up and be your happy self quicker.  On the <br/>
occasions that I&#39;ve seen one of my kids get &quot;down&quot; about something, <br/>
when I talk about it with them, it is never internal, always <br/>
fleeting, they just know how to resist these negative things that we <br/>
encounter throughout life.  I owe that to the way they know <br/>
themselves deeply and are respected and encouraged in their lives.</div>

This is from that same survey Holly posted.  The answer to the first  <br/>
one is a lyrics quote from a song from &quot;Nacho Libre.&quot;<br/>
At the moment, Holly is in the other room humming a happy tune.<br/>
Pretty cool!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PART 4: YOUR PERSONALITY<br/>
Do you have low self esteem? No, no,no, nonono way, JOSE !<br/>
Do you get depressed about things easily? Only about depressing things.<br/>
Are you happy right now? Right NOW?!!?!? Surely.<br/>
