things the way the next unschooler does.  Delete as needed seems to be key.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi --<br/>
<br/>
I think people who are curious about unschooling and who may want to move<br/>
towards it should be welcome on this list.  (However, if people hate the type<br/>
of advice dished out here, I think they should *consider* leaving, instead of<br/>
trying to reshape the list to give them the advice they prefer.  This list<br/>
already exists and satisfies the needs of scores of people.  There are hundreds<br/>
of homeschooling lists out there.  This one doesn&#39;t need to contort itself into<br/>
different shapes to please every potential list member.  I&#39;m not trying to<br/>
force anyone to leave.  It&#39;s up to every individual to decide if it&#39;s worth<br/>
her/his time to be on this list.)<br/>
<br/>
We all unschool differently, but if people want to be really different about<br/>
it, and unschool in a way that has some similarities to school at home, then<br/>
I&#39;d like to ask for one thing.  That is, IF you have an unsuccessful<br/>
experience, please don&#39;t say that you tried unschooling and it didn&#39;t work.  If<br/>
you want the right to homeschool in your own unique way, please say &quot;we tried<br/>
homeschooling in our own unique way and it didn&#39;t work&quot;.  (Again, this is only<br/>
IF you run into problems.)<br/>
<br/>
Why do I think there might be problems?  Because I believe it is the freedom<br/>
from compulsion that allows unschooled kids to really excell in their chosen<br/>
areas.  Compulsion, in public school, produces a strong aversion for learning.<br/>
There are a lot of kids that come out of school HATING math, or poetry or<br/>
history.  I&#39;m not sure that even tiny bits of compulsion are desirable when it<br/>
comes to promoting learning.<br/>
