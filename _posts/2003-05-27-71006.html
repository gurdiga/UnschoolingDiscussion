<div id="ygrps-yiv-185884418">Today we piled into the car to go to the library and I noticed as I looked in the side mirror that I had two grey hairs (my first!). I showed my husband and made a comment about getting old. Jess (9) said &quot;don&#39;t grow old Mum&quot; and Mia (4) said &quot;you need a walking stick Mummy&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Tonight I went into the bathroom to help my other son Jacob (6) out of the shower and found him sobbing. I thought he was hurt at first but he said he wasn&#39;t. I got him out and wrapped him up and just cuddled him till he calmed down. <br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t want to talk about it but  I reminded him how much better he always felt when were able to talk. I asked him if he were worried about something  and he said yes, it&#39;s something I know is going to happen. <br/>
<br/>
 I realized straight away what it was-he was looking at me like I might disappear any second and I asked if he was worried about me getting old and he burst into tears. We had another long hug and I told him that 32 wasn&#39;t all that old really and that I was pretty healthy and barring accidents I should live  for a long time to come. We talked about the stuff in life that is out of our control and we can&#39;t spend our whole life worrying about it. I said I wouldn&#39;t talk about me getting old if it was going to upset him. <br/>
<br/>
It made me feel really loved but I feel  bad that it is weighing on his little heart.  Has anyone else had this happen? Any suggestions on how to reassure him more.<br/>

<br/>
Do you have friends who were in their 30s when they had babies (and who are <br/>
still alive with older kids)?  If he knew our family you could show him they <br/>
still have their mom.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s too little to care about comparisons, though, so never mind that.<br/>
<br/>
I fear car accidents more than anybody&#39;s age or physical state, personally.  <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t remind him of that, either, though. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not much help.  Distraction, maybe?  Life span charts of various animals and <br/>
people?<br/>
Talking about when he&#39;s older, chit chatting about being a grandmother <br/>
someday if he finds someone he wants to have babies with?  Maybe some distracting <br/>
kind of conversation that seems like changing the subject but is actually going <br/>
past his worry, coming back and and tying pretty ideas around it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510365622">Both of my kids went through this and I remember having the same fear about<br/>
my own parents.   I tend to think it&#39;s all part of becoming aware of<br/>
mortality.<br/>
<br/>
I do my best to reassure them and remind them that there will always be<br/>
someone to take care of them.  I listen and let them talk, let them show me<br/>
how far they want to take the conversation.  Lanora has gone into much<br/>
greater depth than Jonathan which make sense, she&#39;s 12 and he&#39;s 5.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599535222">Both my kids have had an obsessive fear of death and of their parents&#39; <br/>
death in particular since they were four.  My youngest is now 10 1/2.  The <br/>
oldest is almost 15.  Both kids have mood disorders as do I.  They grew up <br/>
in a household that was initially full of anxiety and anger so this may not <br/>
have any match with yours.  Insecurity has a lot to do with my daughter&#39;s <br/>
obsession with the subject of my dying.  Medication for her and I both made <br/>
it better, but whenever she would ask if I was going to die soon, I would <br/>
ask her what she was afraid was going to happen if I did.  The we would go <br/>
through the scenario about that Daddy would still be here and her <br/>
grandparents and so on.  Or I would say, &quot;Look at your grandmother, she&#39;s <br/>
96 and so I&#39;ll still be here when you have kids!&quot;  Or just keep talking <br/>
until I would find out what event happened that day that caused her to <br/>
think about me and death, not always related.  Distraction wasn&#39;t always <br/>
what she wanted, but she did want to talk about it somehow and be reassured <br/>
that she was loved and would be taken cared of and not abandoned (until she <br/>
was ready).<br/>
<br/>
But the topic will not go away, nor will the emotions.  So you listen, you <br/>
cuddle, you reassure, and you empathize that yes, you will miss each other <br/>
when that day ever comes, but that to worry about something sooooo far <br/>
ahead from today will just make you more sad than you want to be, and you <br/>
want to be happy hugging each other for now, and how we go and do.......OK?<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
<br/>

  still have their mom.<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s a good idea. My mum had my brother when she was 44 so she is now 59 and still has 2 teenagers at home. <br/>

  Letting them talk as much as they need to seems to be the answer to dealing with most of the troubles that come our kids way. I know that telling me how he felt did alleviate that real anxiety. <br/>
