My dd wants one...I think it was some name like, &quot;type for fun&quot; &quot;type and<br/>
learn&quot; or something (well they are all named something like that! ha!)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Was it this list that posted a really cool typing program? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are some typing games you can download cheap or free.<br/>
<br/>
KeyBoom has gotten a lot of use from teens in this house.  I&#39;m third on the <br/>
score list, and I&#39;ve clocked at 90+ wpm on &#39;real&#39; typing tests.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &#39;real&#39; typing, is the problem!  But two visitors who never took a <br/>
typing class can both beat me at it.<br/>
<br/>
And Mavis Beacon?  Drives me crazy.  I can&#39;t score well because they don&#39;t <br/>
let you keep going after a mistake.  <br/>
<br/>
We used to have Mario Types and it was fun, but computers come and go and <br/>
it&#39;s in a really old format.<br/>
