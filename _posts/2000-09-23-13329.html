<div id="ygrps-yiv-432290125">Hi Dawn,<br/>
Where did you get the EMLA cream used for vaccinations?  I ask this because<br/>
my son has sensory integration dysfunction which makes him more sensitive to<br/>
pain (as well as touch, smell, light, texture, taste...) and makes medical<br/>
procedures nightmarish.  I&#39;ve tried talking to medical professionals and<br/>
they give me suggestions like...solarcaine, lanacaine and icy-hot to numb<br/>
the injection site.  I had heard about emla from a parenting magazine, but<br/>
have been unable to find it.  Did you get it from the doctor or hospital?<br/>
Thanks a bunch!<br/>

I&#39;m not Dawn ,but I hope you don&#39;t mind me answering. Emla is available by<br/>
prescription only. My eldest dd used it for her allergy testing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-966826975">I had our doc call in a script for it at the pharmacy and we put it on<br/>
about an hour and a half before his app&#39;t.  He felt nothing until the<br/>
nurse injected the med, at which time, his eyes got wide and he said, &quot;Is<br/>
this supposed to hurt?&quot; When I said yes, he replied, &quot;Good because it<br/>
does.&quot;  But I *know* this child and if it had hurt a lot, he would not<br/>
have said to me the other day, &quot;Aren&#39;t I supposed to get another shot at<br/>
halloween time?&quot;  We also had them use the smallest needle (looked like<br/>
one of the tiny ones used by diabetics) and only a half dosage.  It was<br/>
also *just* tetanus, not DT.  It was his first shot ever.  Actually, his<br/>
first &quot;real&quot; medicine in his 5 yrs.  He&#39;s been unwell before, but never<br/>
sick enough to go to the dr (this was his 2nd visit since his 12 month<br/>
well check) and he just turned 5.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh my gosh, Tiffany, you just struck something with me.  My son has sensory <br/>
integration disfunction.  He&#39;s very sensitive to light, but seems to be <br/>
hyposensitive to many other stimuli.  He never seemed particularly sensitive <br/>
to pain.  But I really have to wonder why he went practically berserk when he <br/>
was having blood drawn during his last visit to the doctor, last year.  I&#39;m <br/>
sitting here kinda dumbstruck. . .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949166686">Thank you, thank you, thank you guys for the Emla information.  For some <br/>
reason, I thought it was only available in Europe.  Where did I get that?<br/>
<br/>
Can you use it when you have blood drawn, too?  <br/>

pediatricians generally pretty receptive to a patient asking for an EMLA <br/>
prescription?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
