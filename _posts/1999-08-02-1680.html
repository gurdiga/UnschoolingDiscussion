Hi all.  I have been quiet lately and I apologize for that but we have<br/>
been going through alot lately.  My 8 yr olds father is fighting for<br/>
custody due to the fact that I am going to homeschool.  I had an idea and<br/>
my attorney thought it would be helpful also.  Here it is:  I was<br/>
wondering if those of you that have children between the ages of 6 and 10<br/>
would be willing to have them write a short letter telling about their<br/>
experience with homeschooling.  Things like how the like the one on one<br/>
attention, how they like the education, how they feel socially and just<br/>
any feelings they would be good to share.  I would also then like the<br/>
parents of these children to write a short letter giving their input<br/>
also.  If there are children of other ages that would like to write that<br/>
would be great also.  I am just wanting to take something to my daughters<br/>
dad and possibly to court (if it goes into court I will be sure not show<br/>
names of anyone from the letters).  <br/>
The HSLDA does not help with these kinds of cases so I am kind of out on<br/>
my own.  I am petrified of the financial impact this may have on my<br/>
family but giving up is not an option.  My daugter needs and wants to be<br/>
homeschooled.<br/>
If anyone is interested in doing this please email me privately and I<br/>
will give you my address.  Thank you in advance ......you guys are always<br/>
here when I need you and even if you do not want to do a letter for<br/>
me...thank you for just being here :)<br/>
