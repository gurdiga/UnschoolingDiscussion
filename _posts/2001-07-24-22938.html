<div id="ygrps-yiv-399551090">Yes, it&#39;s a virus. Called sircam or something like that. The subject is<br/>
always different but the message always contains that phrase.<br/>
I&#39;d just delete it. I made a rule to send any email with that phrase to the<br/>
delete file.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494315628">don&#39;t open it, It sounds very much like a virus someone warned me about a<br/>
week ago. Delete it immediately. If you execute it, you have a one in twenty<br/>
chance in wiping out your entire hard drive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16406914">The likelihood if a .pif extension NOT holding a virus when received though<br/>
email or file transfer over the net is billions to one. The .pif extension<br/>
is a windows function and can be used to set off a delete or format of your<br/>
hard drive. These files are normally used only for windows functions from<br/>
window&#39;s itself. These extensions can also be hidden in the file name so<br/>
that you only see &quot;mypicture&quot; instead of &quot;mypicture.jpg.pif&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who receives email or file transfers over the net should invest in a<br/>
good antivirus that scans any files as they are received. I use Norton but<br/>
have had problems with it in the past. Its finally working right so I&#39;m<br/>
happy with it.<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps<br/>

It is definitely a virus......it is the SirCam virus an especially <br/>
nasty one.......here is a URL to scan your computer with.....<br/>

A good rule of thumb is not to download anything but JPG format <br/>

filename.jpg.pif<br/>
Those are trouble.<br/>
