 Sandra, I am surprised you did not send your children to school. It always <br/>
 seems like the people that loved school send their own kids, as they see in <br/>
 only a positive light. What was the turning point in your life that lead you <br/>
 to homeschooling and then unschooling? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
   I&#39;m not Sandra, but I loved school, too.....I was that skipping, <br/>
ankle-socked child of Popular Culture,  pigtails flying, lunch box clanking,  <br/>
happy to go off to a place where you could learn Spanish, paint pictures, <br/>
play the cello, run the 50 yd dash, and inhale the library...... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  But.....I was lucky.  I went to &quot;experiemental schools&quot; for much of my <br/>
grade school years, and I had the benefit of a fabulous &quot;talented and gifted&quot; <br/>
program (want to spend hours in the darkroom, learning photography? No <br/>
problem.  Study Shakespeare and Plato and Dante, in a symposium? Sure!  Spend <br/>
half the summer at a FREE &quot;camp&quot; for other kids like you, sponsored by the <br/>
state of Virginia?  Go for it!).<br/>
<br/>
  And I was a great &quot;test-taker&quot; and fit in and got elected to Student Body <br/>
President and made Newspaper Editor and stuff like that and had the &quot;run&quot; of <br/>
the halls and more freedom that 95% of the other students--unfairly so.<br/>
<br/>
  BUT, very few schools are like that....the 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s were the <br/>
heyday of academic experimentation in &quot;alternative public learning&quot; and Free <br/>
Schools and other early Holt-ian concepts.  And, my firstborn was not rough <br/>
and tough and bold and left-brained; she was sensitive and timid and dreamy <br/>
and right-brained and thus I *knew* that not only were the schools I had the <br/>
opportunity to inflict upon here nowhere near as benign as mine had been, but <br/>
she was a personality type that would be *shredded* by the System.  When we <br/>
moved the sofa to vacuum after her first few months traumatized in First <br/>
Grade, and saw the PILES of blonde, curly hair that she had twisted and <br/>
knotted and yanked out and tossed back there, in her post-traumatic, <br/>
after-school, stressed television viewing sessions, we internalized what we&#39;d <br/>
already suspected: that School and Ellie were a deadly mix. <br/>
<br/>
  And, I&#39;d not had my first child till I was 32, she was the light of our <br/>
lives, and I never had adjusted to the &quot;notion&quot; that ripping a 4 yr. old <br/>
child (she wasn&#39;t even 5 went I first, insanely, placed her on the bus for <br/>
the 40 minute ride to kindergarden!) away from her family to insure her <br/>
&quot;socialization&quot; was a Good Thing.  I wanted her back.  We brought her back. <br/>
And after that, I began reading and reading and researching and meeting other <br/>
homeschoolers and my list of justifications for homeschooling grew and <br/>
grew......<br/>
<br/>
   But that was the *initial*, deciding ephiphany. :-)<br/>
