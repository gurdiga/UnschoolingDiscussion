<div id="ygrps-yiv-209405444">I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about showing progress.  We&#39;ve only had one <br/>
portfolio review so far, but it was with an unschooling friendly person.  The <br/>
portfolio was just a box full of miscellaneous from the year: literature from any <br/>
programs we attended, art work, stories she wrote, a book my daughter had just <br/>
finished reading.  This year the progress is obvious to me. My daughter went <br/>
from a tentative reader to a &quot;just about can read anything&quot; reader. So I&#39;ll <br/>
mention that to the reviewer, but I won&#39;t prepare anything to quantify it.<br/>

Subject: How to show progress<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on showing progress for a review?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I mean is I have a Portfolio review and I have to &quot;show&quot; progress over <br/>
<br/>
the year.<br/>
<br/>
I had planned on saying/writing down what he has done over the year.  I keep <br/>
<br/>
finding myself trying to write this and breaking down what he does in <br/>
<br/>
subjects. Is that what I am expected to do?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone do Portfolios in their state for Unschooling? The person doing this is <br/>
<br/>
Unschool friendly but this is the first Portfolio I have done as we had <br/>
<br/>
tested prior.<br/>
