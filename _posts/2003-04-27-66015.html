&lt;&lt; One, I have heard Florida mentioned a few times for unschooling.  <br/>
 Where or what for that matter?  I am in South Florida.  I know there <br/>
 is a conference this month for the Florida Association of parent <br/>
 educators (I think thats their title??).  I am not sure how unschooly <br/>
 or not they are? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not.<br/>
FPEA is hugely a conservatively run group, I don&#39;t agree with much of Brenda <br/>
Dickinsons push with the legislative decisions.<br/>
I&#39;m sure their conference will be a major Christian affair. Not my cuppa. <br/>
There won&#39;t be anything mentioned about unschooling but there&#39;ll be loads of <br/>
curriculum offered.<br/>

&quot;They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible <br/>
spoon;<br/>
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>
