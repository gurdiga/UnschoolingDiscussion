&lt;&lt; In Vermont we have to send in 3-6 examples of &quot;schooling&quot; for each<br/>
subject by law each year. It is hard to unschool because I have to watch<br/>
what they are doing - make it fit the subject matter that the state has<br/>
put together, etc. How can I get around that? Michele &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Photographs of them doing the thing, photographs of a visit to a historic <br/>
site, or a printout of something they wrote on the computer, or a summary  of <br/>
what they&#39;ve done that was cool and mathematical (and it does NOT have to <br/>
look like numbers on rows to be math).<br/>
<br/>
Find unschoolers in Vermont and ask them what they do.  That&#39;s your very best <br/>
bet.<br/>
