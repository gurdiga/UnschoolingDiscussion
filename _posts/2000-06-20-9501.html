<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994390676">Hi Dawn,  and welcome...  My oldest will be 6 in Sept.  When he was 4 we <br/>
tried the preschool route, too.  It lasted from Aug- the end of Nov.  My son <br/>
began wanting me to be there all of the time, because I often helped out.  On <br/>
days that I was not going, he did not want to go either.  Also, he did not <br/>
like the idea of having to conform to the group, and do things like sing and <br/>
march around the room with al of the other kids.  He just never liked the <br/>
idea of doing something just because the group was doing it.  They had a <br/>
Thanksgiving program in Nov, where the kids were to wear Pilgrim hats and <br/>
sing songs.  When the time came, John would NOT have anything to do with it <br/>
at all.  He absolutely had no interest in taking part.  All the while, I was <br/>
considering homeschooling for my kids, and this helped confirm the decision <br/>
to do so.  There was not anything specifically &quot;wrong&quot; with the preschool <br/>
program;  it just did not match the needs that my child had.  He requires <br/>
more freedom, and less conformity than traditional schooling offers.  Forcing <br/>
him to go to school would not be in his best interest.  Who knows down the <br/>
road how things  will go; but for now, this is the best decision for him.  We <br/>
have 2 more children that are younger than John, and at this time, we plan to <br/>
homeschool them, too.  Your question about  would you be neglecting your <br/>
child if he was not initiating an area of learning...  Your child is always <br/>
learning, even if it does not look like it.  Unschooling is something that <br/>
takes a &quot;leap of faith&quot;.  It takes trusting your child.  It takes knowing <br/>
that your child wants to learn innately, and as you go along, you will find <br/>
there are highs and lows.  Times of busy, explosive learning, and times where <br/>
you wonder if your kid is a slug!  Take time to read as muchas you can on <br/>
home/unschooling.  There are a lot of great books and web sites available.  <br/>
Hope this is not too long!  Take care~Karen in Ind</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-267591455">Thanks Karen:<br/>
<br/>
This morning I&#39;ve already contacted the Sonoran Desert Homeschoolers which is <br/>
an organization of about 90 families in Tucson that homeschool and unschool.  <br/>
We seem to be lucky because there is also a group called TELEO as well, that <br/>
I haven&#39;t had time to reach.  There are also several Christian based groups <br/>
if I had wanted to have religion as a prominent part of our lives.  I&#39;ve <br/>
talked to a couple of mothers already and feeling a lot better about my <br/>
decision.  I know logically that it makes sense.  Something one of them told <br/>
me was that I would probably end up changing all my friends as the ones I <br/>
have now, who don&#39;t homeschool or unschool, will probably feel threatened by <br/>
what I&#39;m doing and to expect a backlash.  However she also said there is tons <br/>
of support for what we want to do as well... We&#39;ve had the same experience <br/>
with Zak and the preschool.  He always wants us to be there with him all the <br/>
time and so therefore what would the point be.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>

in Tucson! My kids are 2 1/2 and 6 mo.<br/>
