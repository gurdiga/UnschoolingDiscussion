<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111111128">Dh and I were just discussing unschooly-type nonconformist movies, and<br/>
here&#39;s what we came up with:<br/>
One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest  ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073486/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073486/</a> ) <br/>

<br/>
I found myself wondering what the folks at UD would have to contribute.<br/>
Anyone care to add to the list?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-367097515">The documentary, _The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill_<br/>
<br/>
The subject, Mark Bittner, seems to be living an unschooling life. He is<br/>
really smart, and totally utilizes institutions only when he needs them -<br/>
the rest of the time he is creating the life he wants and searching for his<br/>
peace and creative sustenance.<br/>

your own way)<br/>
 <br/>
Finding Nemo (letting kids go and trusting them)<br/>
 <br/>
Can&#39;t Buy Me Love (being yourself)<br/>
 <br/>
Chocolat (never shows girl at school, letting your child learn from  <br/>
surroundings, letting kids and selves be free)<br/>
 <br/>
Scent of a Woman (more anti-school maybe, than unschooling, but sooooo  good!)<br/>
 <br/>
The Secret of Roan Inish (probably one of THE BEST unschooling movies there  <br/>
is)<br/>
 <br/>
Uncle Buck (more anti-school, but also being yourself, having fun, doing  <br/>
things diffierently)<br/>

My children loved it! When we were leaving, my DD 4 said, &quot;Do you know who<br/>
else is curious? Angus!&quot; I am so glad that curiosity is something that we<br/>
cherish and name in our home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582300856">Maybe not all 100% unschooly, but here&#39;s some movies my kids have been <br/>
into lately.  Seems we are on a fantasy binge.<br/>
<br/>
*Legend....starring a very young Tom Cruise before he went <br/>
crazy...very pretty to watch, but dark (a unicorn is slain, <br/>
some &quot;hell&quot; type imagery) so not for young children necessarily.  <br/>
*Secret of Roan Inish  Our family favorite-great for St. Pattys&#39; Day.<br/>
*Indian in the Cupboard   (a few school scenes)<br/>
*Neverending Story (all 3, best 1)  (again, some in school scenes and <br/>
bullies)<br/>
*Milo in the Land of Faraway<br/>
*Labryinth<br/>
*Willow<br/>
<br/>
A couple of these movies have some in school scenes:<br/>
NeverEnding story has a lot of bullying so the kid &quot;turns to fantasy <br/>
to cope with reality&quot; crap, that part stinks and it&#39;s sad nobody helps <br/>
this kid. But my son LOVES the warrior boy, Atreyu.  Actually, because <br/>
of the bullying scenes I wouldn&#39;t recommend it at all but the first <br/>
movie was just so cool whenever Bastian was in the fantasy scenes.<br/>
<br/>
Labryinth has some &quot;life lessons&quot; about growing up and leaving behind <br/>
childhood fantasies.  I was not so thrilled about that, but my oldest <br/>
daughter picked right up on it and commented how stupid an idea that <br/>
was.  Overall, for us, the fantasy made up for the schooly aspects, <br/>
especially since my kids are all a little older now and acutely aware <br/>
when someone is trying to slip in a lesson on how to make their life <br/>
less interesting. <br/>

was only on tape, I copied off two song-and-dance numbers and let the  <br/>
tape go back to the rental place.  Now that it&#39;s on DVD, I can go  <br/>
straight to the good parts. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I just had to reccomend Lord&#39;s of Dog Town.  Its an excellent movie and <br/>

skateboarding (parents too!)<br/>
