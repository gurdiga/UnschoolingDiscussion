I have to say YES! My oldest had a really rough time from around 9 y.o. to 11 <br/>
ish....<br/>
He is really sweet most of the time now, moody somewhat, but  really sweet <br/>
overall.<br/>
He&#39;s going to be 13 soon, so I think that&#39;s pretty good.<br/>
I really enjoy him.<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to say, that if you have one child that doesn&#39;t want to go <br/>
anywhere, and others that do, it isn&#39;t fair to center the plans around the <br/>
one that wants to stay home all of the time.<br/>
I&#39;d try to balance having him come along and staying home by trying to choose <br/>
together what is really important at that time.<br/>
If there is a play or concert that you can&#39;t see again and someone really <br/>
wants to go, I don&#39;t see that it&#39;s fair to make them miss over and over.<br/>
I&#39;d take him, with some options for if he&#39;s miserable.<br/>
Like bringing along some items that are appropriate for the time and <br/>
place....a gameboy in some cases, maybe legos in another.<br/>
I encourage my reluctant children to come along on some outings, they don&#39;t <br/>
know until they try.  And most of the time they admit it was worth <br/>
going....if they aren&#39;t enjoying themselves, there&#39;s always some option that <br/>
makes it more fun.<br/>

We do deals a lot - for eg, a  favourite snack at a coffee shop, calling by a place they want to go to ( eg the video shop, toy shop, etc) on the way home from the other outing,  the one that we &quot;have&quot; to do or that others want to do. Deals work  well here, and they also model negotiating skills! :-)..Leonie W. <br/>

Thanks, Ren, I think this is what I&#39;ll try,  I think we have  a battle with my ds to go anywhere because he is sooo focused.  When he is doing his PS2 he just wants to accomplish his task or what ever and if I can let him save it and then say,  &quot;lets just give this a try!&quot;  I think he&#39;ll come along.  He often asks,  &quot;do I have to?&quot;  and this one gets to me when I&#39;m trying to be noncontrolling.  There is such a fine line...hence, lies my struggle. (sounds like a line from a movie,&lt;g&gt;).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A week ago we went to a play. It was Much Ado About Nothing by Skakespeare -<br/>
a 2 1/2 hr play. I brought my 2 boys, Ben (11) and Jon (9). Soon after it<br/>
started, Jon started acting antsy and fidgety. He wasn&#39;t understanding the<br/>
dialogue and wasn&#39;t following the play. After about 45 minutes he actually<br/>
started (silently) crying, he was so miserable. I asked him to wait until<br/>
the intermission and we would talk about leaving the play. Ben did want to<br/>
stay and watch, and wouldn&#39;t feel good about staying alone if I just walked<br/>
outside with my younger son. I also wanted to stay. So, Jon somehow suffered<br/>
through the next 1/2 hour until intermission. We all went outside to talk<br/>
and he was adamant about leaving, and I thought it wasn&#39;t fair to Ben who<br/>
wanted to stay, and so did I. SO, I bribed him. I told him if we stayed, I&#39;d<br/>
buy him a pokemon booster pack (they still collect those cards) and go get<br/>
something to eat at Taco Bell afterwards. I also had to promise I&#39;d never<br/>
make him come to a Shakespeare play again. Of course, I also had to buy Ben<br/>
a booster pack, too, to make it fair. Jon reluctantly agreed and we got to<br/>
watch the rest of the play. After the intermission, the pace of the play<br/>
picked up was more interesting. I even saw Jon watching and laughing a few<br/>
times. &lt;g&gt; And all the kids in the audience (it was a school field trip<br/>
audience) were shocked and wowed when the actors came to a scene and kept<br/>
saying ASS. They couldn&#39;t believe they were allowed to hear that kind of<br/>
talk. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I felt really frustrated about how we were all going to come away happy from<br/>
that play, and that was the best solution I could think of at the moment.<br/>
While I was faced with decisions, I thought about what I might have done in<br/>
the past to get through the situation. I might have threatened Jon with<br/>
punishments to get him to cooperate and used my authority as a solution. But<br/>
I kept thinking about what my unschooling compadres might do in a situation<br/>
like that - and how to solve it in a peaceful way rather than a harsh way. I<br/>
thank you all for helping me get through that little dillema. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053894218">Karin, it&#39;s so cool to hear how you were able to come up with a solution <br/>
for both your guys.  I love the peaceful resolutions that can happen when <br/>
we practice compassion.  It&#39;s so inspiring for me to read what everyone <br/>
does, and it&#39;s comforting to know that we all maybe didn&#39;t use to <br/>
think/behave that way.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for telling about this!<br/>

<br/>
Holly wanted to leave halfway through Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor <br/>
Dreamcoat, when we saw it live in a local production when she was eight, <br/>
nearly nine.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of us had ever seen it or seen the video.  I really like seeing <br/>
theatre cold when I can, and THEN immerse myself in the text and videos.<br/>
<br/>
I did NOT want to leave, not even a little bit.  So we sat on the curb <br/>
outside during intermission and I told her from the Bible the story of Joseph <br/>
entrapping Benjamin with the golden cup, and how eventually his father and <br/>
brothers come to live there.<br/>
<br/>
I was HOPING that was going to happen in the next few scenes, and it did, so <br/>
she was happy.<br/>
<br/>
Of course now she knows every word of it and is thrilled that she saw it.<br/>
<br/>
I would have offered her $25 to stay.  But I didn&#39;t end up needing to.<br/>
