<div id="ygrps-yiv-889813772">1) rememebering our evolution from &quot;classroom&quot; to &quot;kitchen table&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The details are boring and make way too long a post. Let&#39;s just say, <br/>
looking back at how we  moved the classroom from one room to the <br/>
other, adjusting bedrooms to accomodate the classroom, and after all <br/>
was said and all was done...everyone doing their work at the Central <br/>
Location of the kitchen table. Why? Because, it was way more <br/>
comfortable and more natural to be at a place in the house where we <br/>
could be together easily. Even when it was just Abbie <br/>
being &quot;educated&quot; it was no fun trying to keep the babies out of our <br/>
hair all the time, as we had to when we were &quot;doing school&quot; in a <br/>
classroom. <br/>
<br/>
If learning was easier and more natural outside of a home classroom, <br/>
I figured out recently, who is to say that putting them down in front <br/>
of workbooks and texts and math problems is better AT ALL? Why not <br/>
let all their learning take place naturally?<br/>
<br/>
2) Watching Katie and realizing she knows SO MUCH MATH, with almost <br/>
ZERO formal instruction in that &quot;subject.&quot; Subtraction she figured <br/>
out completely on her own. And I am not a math person. That really <br/>
boggled my mind, and convinced me of things that I&#39;d read in Holt and <br/>
Gatto, and frankly, in Robinson Method homeschooling literature: the <br/>
brain is capable of learning, and the &quot;teacher&quot; is needed only when <br/>
the learner asks. <br/>
<br/>
3) realizing that my kids have way more knowledge than myself, not in <br/>
areas where I had been &quot;teaching&quot; them, but in areas where they&#39;ve <br/>
explored on their own, based on their own interests. I will never <br/>
know as much as Abbie about sharks, and I don&#39;t want to! L <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more, but that&#39;s enough for now.<br/>
