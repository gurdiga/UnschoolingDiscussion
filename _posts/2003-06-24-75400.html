 </span></blockquote>I love milk. I drink it with most meals, I can&#39;t drink coffee without<br/>
half and half or cream, and when I&#39;m having trouble eating I can always<br/>
drink milk. Rain and I got through 2 gallons a week, and I drink a lot<br/>
more than she does. I&#39;ve never had excema, I have seasonal asthma and<br/>
allergies that come and go according to what&#39;s in bloom, and my weight is<br/>
in the low-normal range. I&#39;m a euro-mutt (Hungarian, Danish, German,<br/>
Lithuanian). We try to get the no BHG hormone milk at Trader Joe&#39;s (it<br/>
tastes the same) but organic would be too much of a pinch in the<br/>
pocketbook.<br/>
<br/>
So, my mileage varies, and maybe your does too. <br/>
