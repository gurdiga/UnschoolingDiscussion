&gt; &gt; Dar, glad to be home <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi Dar! Glad you&#39;re back home too. Can&#39;t wait to meet you on the <br/>
&gt; 6th. I might be dragging a couple of friends along. Not sure yet.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cool, the more the merrier.  We&#39;re all getting excited, Cacie ran into a<br/>
teen friend at a different party down in the bay area on Saturday and<br/>
they were figuring out the weeks, which made it seem much sooner. I just<br/>
hope the weather warms up a bit, they swear it was warmer before we<br/>
arrived, but it&#39;s been way too windy and chilly this past week...<br/>
<br/>
I am at that stage in unpacking where it seems like the boxes reproduce<br/>
as we sleep, but at least the walls are no repaired and painted (except<br/>
the bathroom), the furniture is in place, I own a stove and a<br/>
refrigerator from the Sears in Woodland (I feel so grown-up), and the<br/>
indoors insect and spider population is at least greatly reduced. <br/>
<br/>
The stars at night are amazing, and I watch the barn owls go out to hunt<br/>
every evening at dusk. We see wild pheasants, too, and lots of other<br/>
birds. And rabbits, many many rabbits, and one lizard on the warmest day.<br/>
We also found a place in Sacramento with a Target, a Trader Joe&#39;s, and a<br/>
great Indian restaurant (with vegetable pakoras make the way Cacie likes<br/>
them) all fairly close together. It&#39;s near where Cacie&#39;s dad used to<br/>
live, although he&#39;s been homeless for the past month or so and has been<br/>
sleeping in his car at various rest areas. Which sucks... <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the party is still on for April 6 - 7, all are welcome and good<br/>
tent spce is still available. Also, if Kristi is reading, could you send<br/>
me your email address? My dad&#39;s computer was crashing as I left, and I<br/>
lost it..<br/>
