&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ahhhhh, now there&#39;s a donut.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously living in Europe, I don&#39;t see either kind, although there are<br/>
plenty of great German pastries to get fat on....<br/>
I went to Rome for a church conference (great thing about living in<br/>
Europe....even conferences are in cool places!), and got off the train at<br/>
Termini, the main Roman train station.  Walked towards the Exit, and found<br/>
myself face to face with a Dunkin Donuts.  I about fell over in shock!  (And<br/>
yes, I did splurge and take a dozen home to my family!)<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s soldiers spent several weeks debating whether a 14-hour<br/>
(one-way) train trip to Rome to get donuts was too ridiculous.<br/>
