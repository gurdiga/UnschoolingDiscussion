<div id="ygrps-yiv-311611443">&lt;&lt;I just want to fit school in with life&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well.....the problem is that school is soooooo far removed from real life<br/>
that it is difficult to reconcile the two.  I also have 5 children, ages 11,<br/>
8, 5, 3 and 2.  Here are the types of things we do:<br/>
<br/>
1.  I talk with my kids about everything and I mean everything.  I don&#39;t<br/>
mean lecture or teach them about things.  I just talk with them like I would<br/>
my husband about things that interest me or them.  The current political and<br/>
strategic situation our country is in is loaded with stuff.  I let the kids<br/>
know about stuff I read in the various papers.  So......they found<br/>
Afghanistan on the globe (which generalized and now the kids play a game to<br/>
see who can find the most states in a short period of time), we talk<br/>
politics a lot (I&#39;m a pinko and dh is capitalist), we did goods drive for<br/>
the refugees and the kids understand I can talk to someone in Pakistan on<br/>
the computer and what their writing looks like, etc..  2 of my kids are<br/>
fascinated with the weather forecasts, go figure.<br/>
<br/>
2.  The grocery store is great.  I send ds to find the cheapest bag of<br/>
chips.  Send dd to find milk at no more than such and such a price.  We<br/>
smell and touch everything, weigh it, talk about where it comes from.  The<br/>
kids wrote the grocery list today.<br/>
<br/>
3.  We do 4-H projects.  Right now we are breeding rabbits and goats which<br/>
takes significant basic math skills for record keeping.  Also, doing a<br/>
martial arts project.<br/>
<br/>
4.  We play games, go for walks, look up weird insects in reference books.<br/>
The kids do a lot of the cooking (complete dinner tonight).  Some days we<br/>
just cuddle on the couch and watch tv.  We watch movies set in particular<br/>
time periods, television shows in different languages, listen to all kinds<br/>
of music, etc..<br/>
