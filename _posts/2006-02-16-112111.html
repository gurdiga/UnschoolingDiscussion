<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848322609">LOL, yeah...the expense was part of it... the boys seemed to have a lot of fun asking me if they had enough minutes on the tally sheet (which I mostly did for them)... the funny thing is, we were able to get the 6 hours in & recorded, etc. with MUCH less trouble than when they were in public school!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll have to pay for 3 people this time, next year if everyone gets their 6 hours, we&#39;ll only have to pay for the grownups (and parking (?) and gas).. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; LOL It may be &quot;healthier&quot;, but a whole lot less expensive when you are <br/>
&gt; talking about taking a family with more than just one or two children <br/>
&gt; to an amusement park like Six Flags! Mine are also looking forward to <br/>
&gt; those free tickets to Six Flags! Without &#39;em, we probably couldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; afford it! <br/>
&gt; ~Wilda and the girls in northern Shenandoah valley VA<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It might be healthier for relationships and learning if you just <br/>
&gt; take  <br/>
&gt; &gt; them to Six Flags separate from reading hours and &quot;rewards.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It wasn&#39;t stressful... and if I EVER find it, I have some Braums coupons for reading... my guys love to read, so it&#39;s just a little bit more work to pay attention to what they&#39;re reading & timing...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to check into the Pizza Hut book it program!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe, but why keep track of the reading?  Why not just fill it out and sign <br/>
&gt; off, rather than keeping track of minutes or pages?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have used the pizza hut book it program.  This comes with charts and <br/>
&gt; stars, but we just use the coupon for a free pizza.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cheers,<br/>
