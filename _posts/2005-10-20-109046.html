This week&#39;s theme: words about words.<br/>
<br/>
heterography (het-uh-ROG-ruh-fee) noun<br/>
<br/>
   1. A spelling different from the one in current use.<br/>
<br/>
   2. Use of the same letter(s) to convey different sounds,<br/>
      for example, gh in rough and ghost.<br/>
<br/>
[From Greek hetero (different) + -graphy (writing).]<br/>
<br/>
   The idea of heterography is a recent phenomenon, relatively speaking.<br/>
   Earlier, when English was mainly a spoken language, it was a free-for-all,<br/>
   spelling-wise. Any spelling was good as long as you could make yourself<br/>
   understood. Each writer spelled words in his own way, trying to spell<br/>
   them phonetically. Shakespeare spelled his own name in various ways<br/>
   (Shaxspear, Shakespear, and so on).<br/>
<br/>
   If you read old manuscripts, you can find different spellings of a word<br/>
   on the same page, and sometimes even in the same sentence. Spelling wasn&#39;t<br/>
   something sacrosanct: if a line was too long to fit, a typesetter might<br/>
   simply squeeze or expand the word by altering the spelling.<br/>
<br/>
   If the idea of to-each-one&#39;s-own spelling for the same word sounds bizarre,<br/>
   consider how we practice it even today, in the only place we can: in our<br/>
   names. Look around you and you might find a Christina and a Cristina and<br/>
   a Kristina and many other permutations and combinations.<br/>
<br/>
   With the advent of printing in the 15th century, spelling began to become<br/>
   standardized. By the 19th century, most words had a single &quot;official&quot;<br/>
   spelling, as a consensus, not by the diktat of a committee.<br/>
<br/>
   Today if you write &quot;definately&quot; and someone points out that you&#39;ve misspelled<br/>
   the word, just tell them you&#39;re a practitioner of heterography.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  &quot;A lengthy discourse on several levels of Arabic heterography leads,<br/>
   however, to an assertion that the manuscript&#39;s African-Arabic script<br/>
   is ... the opposite of a self-conscious European autobiography or<br/>
   slave narrative.&quot;<br/>
