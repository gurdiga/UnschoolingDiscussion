<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654301572">I give Carla 8 and Ted 6 a quarter per year of age per<br/>
week, no strings, no chores, to spend or save as they<br/>
like, whenever, wherever. DH won&#39;t be happy giving<br/>
them more w/o chores tied to it and I refuse to do<br/>
that.  BUT he DOES give them all his pennies and<br/>
nickels and I notice he has more of those lately for<br/>
some reason &lt;wink-wink&gt;.  <br/>
<br/>
Family $$ buy all clothes, shoes, art supplies, and<br/>
lots of sweets/snacks/games/toys and they have choice<br/>
in all that too, naturally. I love toys and we have<br/>
TONS of them.  YES I DID need 5 Furbys (and 2 Shelbys)<br/>
or they would be LONELY (that&#39;s ME talking here not<br/>
the kids).  How long am I gonna have where they will<br/>
PLAY with me, anyway?!?  I have to admit I take<br/>
shameless advantage of that and enjoy every minute of<br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
   We collectively decided to save some change in a<br/>
milk jug for a while and when it got too heavy, we<br/>
turned them in at the change machine and it wsa $33,<br/>
enough for Peter Piper Pizza with LOTS of tokens!! The<br/>
kids were amazed, pennies are NOT useless!  <br/>
Those change-counter machines are fun too.<br/>
<br/>
If the kids put $ in the &#39;mom bank&#39; to save for a<br/>
particular item that they didn&#39;t choose when I was<br/>
toy-buying this week, then I match their saving<br/>
amount. Carla is saving for a pocket Neopets game and<br/>
it is SO hard for her to save...I can SEE her struggle<br/>
with it but she is determined and that is so cool!  It<br/>
also sucks though, for it to take so LONGGGGGG so this<br/>
gives her a way to see the $ grow faster. I also keep<br/>
a roll of quarters per 2 weeks for rewarding<br/>
especially cool stuff they do, but not in a &quot;See, I am<br/>
being good, Mom&quot; way--hehe. Sometimes I put one by the<br/>
toothbrushes, first one to remember the toothbrushing<br/>
gets it &gt;:)...ain&#39;t I a stinker?!?  What shining<br/>
smiles we have!!  <br/>
<br/>
I often ask whoever is handy for help doing things in<br/>
the house, general chores, and I also help them with<br/>
their rooms (or DO the rooms for them) when and if<br/>
they need it (which they often do...but their<br/>
choice)...usually they say &#39;sure&#39; and help but I also<br/>
am mindful to ask them at times they aren&#39;t interested<br/>
in something else and they can ALWAYS say no and it is<br/>
REALLY fine, no shaming, just &#39;oh, ok&#39;.  I do,<br/>
however, say when they DO decide to help that &#39;More<br/>
hands makes the work light&#39; and sometimes point out<br/>
that we have more time for fun stuff when everyone<br/>
helps...but I am never tacky and say that when they<br/>
tell me &#39;no, Mom I don&#39;t want to help&#39;, I only want it<br/>
to be a positive reinforcement.  It is FUNNY to see<br/>
their faces when I ask them, they say &#39;no&#39; and then<br/>
they suddenly remember that they are likely to get a<br/>
quarter and &#39;magically&#39; change their mind--hehe!!<br/>
<br/>
I have a cleanliness level I aspire to but I realize<br/>
that is MY thing, not theirs.  I am a bit anal about<br/>
dirty dishes but that&#39;s because we get ants very<br/>
easily and I do the patrol to round them up 2x a day<br/>
and don&#39;t bitch about it.  I also think of loading the<br/>
dishwasher as a personal puzzle challenge, I can fit<br/>
EVERYTHING in there....  <br/>
<br/>
I remake &#39;rescued&#39; Barbie dolls with a tiny paintbrush<br/>
(my current manic hobby) or do precise ribbon<br/>
embroidery or &#39;go pleat something&#39; when I feel that<br/>
picky Virgo urge coming on, I HAVE to or I will<br/>
nitpick on people...Carla is interested in the dolls<br/>
though and just completed her first one-of-a-kind<br/>
Faery, totally solo!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I almost ALWAYS have quarters for the vending machines<br/>
on purpose because my mom would not let me &#39;Waste<br/>
money on that crap&#39; even if it was MY money.  Last<br/>
week Carla bought ME a cool dragon temporary tattoo<br/>
with her own $ that she spent an hour hunting in<br/>
nickels and pennies and she put it on my shoulder for<br/>
me!!  PLUS they are the LUCKIEST kids, they almost<br/>
ALWAYS find a vending machine that someone lost their<br/>
quarter in and they get something free, which tickles<br/>
them a BUNCH...where else can you get a grin like<br/>
that?!?  It is MAGIC to be LUCKY at that age and get a<br/>
freebie!  Carla is also naturally VERY good at that<br/>
&#39;grabber&#39; machine, with the claw, she can win<br/>
something almost every time.  Last week it was a watch<br/>
and she turned immediately and gave it to Ted!  We<br/>
have wacky photos from the 50 cent photo booth at the<br/>
mall on our fridge.<br/>
<br/>
For a solid year I got my allowance every week, tied<br/>
to my chores which I always did.  I immediately biked<br/>
to the Snappy Mart and got a Dr Pepper and a 3<br/>
Musketeers bar, to be eaten alone, before I got<br/>
home...my mother ALSO believed refined sugar made kids<br/>
hyper and caffeine stunted growth so we didn&#39;t get<br/>
much often.  I can&#39;t even look at that candy bar these<br/>
days but I still LOVE Dr Pepper and will buy one, full<br/>
inflated price, from the Chevron fountain when I get<br/>
gas--hehe...and I may get another temp. tattoo from<br/>
the vending machine there next time too, nanner-nanner<br/>
to MY mom &gt;:)<br/>

trip the boys roll them and we take them to the bank and that is their <br/>
spending money for the trip.  <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t use an allowance because we never have the cash on hand so what we <br/>
do it we do the bills together.  The boys help if they want and usually do <br/>
for a while.  Then we decide what we need to save for, vacation, deck, pool <br/>
supplies etc.  After all that is done if there is money left they can get <br/>
something they want, a game they have been looking at or Yu Gi Oh cards.  And <br/>
I get something I want, usually fabric.  We also save out money for movies <br/>
and eating out etc.  That way they know what is going on.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-6299362">Dylan doesn&#39;t have chores.   He didn&#39;t hire on here.   It&#39;s not his<br/>
responsibility to keep the place up.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
I like it when I get help, he&#39;s kind and does nice things for us, but<br/>
it&#39;s not mandatory.<br/>
<br/>
We buy him whatever he wants if it&#39;s within our means.   So far he hasn&#39;t<br/>
asked for a helicopter or a Jaguar, so it&#39;s working happily for everyone.<br/>
  I don&#39;t remember the last time he asked for anything, actually.<br/>
 <br/>
He gets paid once a month when his dad gets paid.  He gets spending<br/>
money, like the rest of us and he gets his age each week.   He&#39;s getting<br/>
forty dollars a month now.   It turns out that&#39;s enough to get a new game<br/>
for Gameboy or Playstation or the computer, or enough for a few books at<br/>
the book store.   It&#39;s also enough to put away and save for something<br/>
big, without it seeming to take an eternity.   <br/>
<br/>
When his dad isn&#39;t working we all forgo the extra spending.<br/>
(theoretically)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t usually have cash on hand either, so Zoe has a handmade<br/>
register (on a big envelope) with dates that she is supposed to get<br/>
money from us and we mark them off when we do have cash on hand.  She<br/>
puts the money in the envelope and always know exactly how much is in it<br/>
without having to count it (because of the register).  She hasn&#39;t yet<br/>
ever wanted to take money out and about with us, so if she wants to buy<br/>
anything with &quot;her own money&quot;, I buy it and we reconcile with her<br/>
register when we get home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949691387">The only one that has a chore here, beside me, is Tara. She is in charge of<br/>
the litter box. It&#39;s automatic so she just has to empty the reservoir. She<br/>
does that every other day. I have to remind her. It&#39;s the only thing I don&#39;t<br/>
do for her unless she&#39;s sick. It was a deal to have the two cats we have.<br/>
It&#39;s not my fault one is 18lbs, poops a lot and hates her!!<br/>
<br/>
Aside from that, no chores. I ask the kids to put away their clothes after I<br/>
wash them. Sometimes I just do it myself. There is no garbage duty, making<br/>
beds, setting tables or anything like that. The kids help clean up. &quot;I&quot; need<br/>
to have the house tidy and the help with no problem.<br/>
<br/>
Tara doesn&#39;t get an allowance since she started to work. Before that she<br/>
did. The kids all get allowance based on nothing really. Joseph and Sierra<br/>
get spending money every week. I put money away every week for the 3<br/>
youngest to put in their bank account. That money doesn&#39;t get touched. The<br/>
money they get weekly is for whatever they want. We buy all their clothes,<br/>
food goodies, arts and crafts stuff and toys. The money they get each week<br/>
usually goes for Yu Gi Oh cards or some little play thing they want. All big<br/>
stuff we buy. Gameboy and playstation games and videos and such. Whatever<br/>
they really need, and that means something cool to even play with we take<br/>
care of. The few dollars a week they get is more than enough to cover their<br/>
whims.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same here. Sometimes I ask them to help with putting the dishes away but they are free to say no. Sometimes they go do it for me. Sometimes they do nothing, sometimes I come downstairs to find they&#39;ve<br/>
vaccuumed (they&#39;re 10, 9 and 7).<br/>
It works in reverse too. The kids will ask me to help with their bedrooms and I&#39;ll give them a hand if I&#39;m not doing anything.<br/>
All this shocks my mother who thinks kids MUST do chores :-)<br/>
<br/>
As for money, theoretically they get $2 a week each (we are a bit challeneged in the financial department) but if they want something and I have spare cash then I buy it. The other day Rhodri wanted a<br/>
D&D manual. It was $30. I didn&#39;t think I had the cash so we had to leave the comic shop with him with a long face. After I went to the store I found I had $25 spare so we searched the house and car and<br/>
found enough change to make up the rest and went and bought the book. No problem.<br/>
Another thing my ma would diagree with. Its &#39;spoiling&#39; apparently. She thinks that when a child asks for anything, the child must wait a few weeks on principle so that the child will &#39;appreciate&#39; the<br/>
object.<br/>
