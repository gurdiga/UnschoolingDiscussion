<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031397824">Wife Swap, the reality TV show, is looking for an unschooling family to<br/>
feature in a future episode. I had a long conversation with Will Nothacker<br/>
who seemed truly interested in homeschooling and especially the concept of<br/>
unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
He said &quot;... I think featuring a family that embraces the unschooling<br/>
philosophy would make a very interesting episode. Wife Swap always strives<br/>
to have families learn from each other by experiencing each other&#39;s lives<br/>
and discussing differences in philosophy.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
However, it is important to realize that while they may strive &quot;to have<br/>
families learn from each other,&quot; they also seem to like to combine very<br/>
different families to see what conflicts may arise. If you are interested in<br/>
being included in an upcoming episode, please note the info below:<br/>
<br/>
Deadline for contact: Feb 1, 2005<br/>

<br/>
Requirements: Two-parent unschooling family with no small children (or if<br/>
any children are under 5, also have older children capable of providing<br/>
childcare). Must be willing to clear their schedule and swap for 10 days<br/>

Should read more like this:<br/>
 <br/>
Requirements:  Two parent unschooling family where one parent is willing to leave the rest of the family at the mercy of a complete stranger, whose intent is to upset your entire way of life.  <br/>
 <br/>
Yanno, I just can&#39;t imagine a scenario where an unschooling parent -- given the level of responsible connection we have with our children -- would  even be tempted to participate in this show.  I&#39;ll admit I&#39;ve never watched an entire episode of the show, but who abandons their family to be tortured by someone else, and goes somewhere else to disrupt another family&#39;s life?  Where is there anything redeeming or mentally healthy in that?  The bits and after-show interviews I&#39;ve seen come across as sanctimonious people who went off determined to prove their rightness of their own ways (and the wrongness of the other wife&#39;s ways), so that they could return home and continue to mistreat their own families, who would be so grateful to have the interloper gone that they&#39;d eagerly welcome the parent home!  <br/>
 <br/>
I just don&#39;t get any of it, not the participant or the spectator aspect of it.  Then again, I don&#39;t get the appeal of any of the &#39;reality&#39; shows out there, so maybe it&#39;s just me.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I agree with that part.  I don&#39;t have strangers watch my kid, even for a <br/>
few hours.  I wouldn&#39;t send him to live with them for 10(?) days.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think most unschooling kids would find it too delightful to be in <br/>
families where parents had arbitrary rules.  Or, perish the thought, the <br/>
kids had to get up and go to school 5 days a week.  ::::: shudders :::::<br/>
<br/>
BUT, it&#39;s really fun to imagine, and maybe write about what it would be <br/>
like for a kid/teen from a mainstream background to come over to an <br/>
unschooling house with all the games and goodies and food platters and <br/>
&quot;sure, let me help you get to what you want&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
(Oh, I&#39;m screwing up the TV show concept.  Only the mom changes houses <br/>
-- not the kids.  I guess that is less disruptive.)<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine a pretty interesting article or &quot;fantasy&quot; short story on <br/>
this topic.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, but the problem would be that in just one week, the mainstream <br/>
kids wouldn&#39;t get past the &quot;let me take everything I can because it&#39;s <br/>
available now, never was before, and never may be again&quot; stage.  <br/>
That&#39;s all the people watching on tv would see...mainstream kids <br/>
gorging themselves on stuff the mainstreamers perceive as bad.  They <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get to see the kids unschooling AFTER they&#39;ve deschooled, <br/>
they&#39;d just see them at the sometimes difficult, just being freed <br/>
from the chains stage.<br/>
<br/>
Still, something about the idea of wifeswap kind of appeals to me.  <br/>
I&#39;m not sure what it is...just first hand observations about how life <br/>
really is for another family and experiencing it I guess.  Kind of <br/>
like how sometimes I think it would be cool if some of you could come <br/>
and live with me for a week and give me opinions on stuff that you <br/>
could only give after hanging out with us for awhile...sometimes you <br/>
just can&#39;t really tell stuff by just reading each other&#39;s email.  But <br/>
I&#39;d never do Wifeswap without the consent of the rest of my family <br/>
and I do NOT have anyone else&#39;s consent. lol <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Seamus and i talked about this while watching the last WifeSwap. The <br/>
meditating mom took the tv/videogame loving kid&#39;s gameboy and tv <br/>
away during the week. She said they would do other fun stuff <br/>
together, play games, have fun, it just wouldnt be tv or videogames. <br/>
The kid freaked out. He couldnt stand it. Seamus didnt get it. He <br/>
said if he knew it was just for the show (five days, not the rest of <br/>
his life), and the mom was willing to play with him and do other <br/>
activities, it would be fine (and this is a kid who LOVES his <br/>
videogames!)<br/>
<br/>
My sister was telling me about one show in which all the kids (teens <br/>
i think)were homeschooled (it sounded like unschooling to me, they <br/>
apparently didnt have lessons or anything---this was a punk rock <br/>
Christian family who&#39;s mom traded with a super christian <br/>
conservative family)...the teens didnt have much of a problem <br/>
respecting the &quot;new mom&quot;s rules, they knew it wasnt permanent and <br/>
they were openminded. I think if the kids in the family wanted to do <br/>
it, treated it like some kind of sociology experiment, it wouldnt be <br/>
harmful. <br/>
<br/>
I would never do it if i had really little children, though. Most of <br/>
the families seem to have kids that are older, not babies. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I&#39;ve often imagined that if I were doing the wifeswap thing I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
try completely unschooling the kids. They could sleep in, stay home from<br/>
school, have a quiet time instead of bedtime but we&#39;d be out the door a lot<br/>
to local museums and such. I&#39;d be planning lots of stuff simply because I<br/>
doubt they could manage their own days like our kids can. I think it would<br/>
just be silly to try to unschool completely for one week (it would be like<br/>
dropping the bottom out from under the poor kids) and would definately look<br/>
bad on the TV.<br/>
<br/>
But I doubt I&#39;d ever be willing to do something like that. I know, based on<br/>
the formula of the show that my kids would likely go to school and come home<br/>
to some disrespectful, ultra disciplined taskmaster. I&#39;d come home to<br/>
Catherine hiding and crying in her room and Harry throwing everything he<br/>
could get his hands on at anyone in the way. :)<br/>
