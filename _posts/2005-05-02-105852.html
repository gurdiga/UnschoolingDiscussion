<div id="ygrps-yiv-850309179">This is by the editor of Life Learning Magazine, Wendy Priesnitz.  It  ties <br/>
in well with recent discussions about what (if anything else) to call  radical <br/>
unschooling when it extends into part of life people hadn&#39;t considered  to be <br/>
central/necessary/something.  I think these first two paragraphs will  be good <br/>
to discuss.  WARNING:  PLEASE do not respond without chopping  off the rest <br/>
of the post.  It&#39;s monstrous long. I included it because it&#39;s  part of the <br/>
magazine&#39;s mailout, and because part of it&#39;s about me.  So  nobody, please, quote <br/>
it all back.  Once is already way long.<br/>
 <br/>
Quote starts now, and then the whole newsletter follows.<br/>

Radical?<br/>
Another reader wrote to say that while she has been enjoying reading about  <br/>
other people’s learning experiences, she won’t be renewing her subscription  <br/>
because she feels Life Learning magazine is “too radical” for her and that we  <br/>
“don’t keep to the homeschooling topic all the time”. I thanked her for <br/>
using  the word “radical”, and pointed out its meaning. My dictionary tells me <br/>
that it  originates with the Latin words radix meaning roots and radicalis,  <br/>
which means having roots. And thus comes the botanical term “radical leaves”,  <br/>
which refers to leaves that arise from the root or crown of the plant. So, for  <br/>
me, a person who is radical is one who examines the roots of issues. And a  <br/>
radical solution to a problem is one that arises from that examination,  <br/>
addressing what we sometimes call the root cause, rather than the more  superficial <br/>
symptoms. I suppose that focus on fundamental change is why radical  views, <br/>
opinions, practices or proposed changes sometimes seem extreme. It is  also why <br/>
I prefer to examine how people learn by living, rather than to isolate  <br/>
self-directed learning as just another homeschooling method or  style.<br/>
<br/>
When I started thinking about these things 35 or so years ago, I  began with <br/>
the presumption that what was wrong with our education system  wouldn’t be <br/>
fixed by tinkering – by adding more subjects, more equipment, more  teachers or <br/>
more funding, or, in fact, by changing the location of where the  teaching took <br/>
place or the content of the curriculum that was used. I realized  then, and <br/>
believe it ever more passionately now, that what’s needed is an  examination of <br/>
how people learn (which includes who controls the agenda) and  whether or not <br/>
schools provide the best opportunity for that learning to unfold.  (They don’<br/>
t.) That sort of radical examination of the problem – and the radical  <br/>
solutions that life learning families are living every day – is what Life  Learning <br/>
magazine is about, whether it seems at first glance to relate  directly to what <br/>
some may define as &quot;homeschooling&quot; or not. <br/>

Thanks For Your Feedback<br/>
We hear from our readers regularly by  email and regular mail - and it&#39;s <br/>
wonderful to receive your comments, article  ideas and input (and the complaints <br/>
too!). Some people write three-page letters;  others jot a friendly note on the <br/>
bottom of their renewal notices. But every  once in awhile, we receive a <br/>
comment that stands out. Subscriber Bonnie Reyes  from Walnut Creek, California <br/>
has allowed me to share her recent email message  with you. She wrote: &quot;I must <br/>
tell you, I had giving up on subscribing to  anything. Too many good intentions <br/>
became piles of disappointment and guilt. A  friend recommended a back issue <br/>
of your magazine when she learned I was  considering homeschooling my four <br/>
children, and I was hooked. Never before has a  magazine so confirmed and <br/>
inspired me in my purpose as a parent. I read every  issue in its entirety, and <br/>
re-read and refer to them regularly. Like Ken  Wilber&#39;s &#39;Theory of Everything&#39;, it <br/>
pulls everything together for me and, more  importantly, demonstrates how to <br/>
apply my beliefs and values and begin living my  vision. Thank you!!!&quot; Thank <br/>
you, Bonnie for making my  day!<br/>

July/August Issue<br/>
As readers begin to digest the May/June  issue, I&#39;m already weaving together <br/>
the threads that will become the July/August  issue. I&#39;m particularly excited <br/>
about an interview with writer and speaker  Sandra Dodd by Canadian writer and <br/>
radio host Beatrice Ekwa Ekoko. And  interestingly enough, Sandra also uses <br/>
the word &quot;radical&quot; in the context of her  unschooling website pages, found at <br/>
_www.sandradodd.com_ (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/)">http://www.sandradodd.com/)</a>  . In  our upcoming feature <br/>
interview, Sandra, who lives with her three  always-unschooled teens and <br/>
husband in Albuquerque, New Mexico, covers a lot of  ground from her concept of <br/>
&quot;strewing&quot;, through freedom, learning for fun and  what she calls &quot;spiritual <br/>
unschooling&quot;. <br/>

Contribute to Life Learning  Magazine<br/>
Another reader recently reported that her favorite articles are  the ones <br/>
written by readers who are helping their kids learn without school, and  are <br/>
sharing their experiences, both good and bad, as they walk this path. <br/>
If  you would like to contribute, please see our guidelines at <br/>
_www.lifelearningmagazine.com/write.html_ (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/write.html)">http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/write.html)</a>  <br/>
. Although we can&#39;t  afford to pay contributors, we like to barter <br/>
(subscriptions, ads, whatever...)  so do get in touch and share your thoughts and <br/>
experiences about self-directed  learning. All thoughts and experiences are welcome, <br/>
no matter how short or  lengthy. And please don&#39;t be shy about your writing <br/>
ability...the whole point of  unschooling is to learn by doing!<br/>
<br/>
Events<br/>
I am  excited to be co-presenting a four-day course as part of the <br/>
Transformative  Learning Centre&#39;s annual Summer Institute at OISE/University of Toronto <br/>
in  Toronto, Ontario from June 16 to 19. It is called Reshaping Self, Family,  <br/>
Community, and Society (through life learning) OISE doctoral  candidate <br/>
Natalie Zur Nedden and I will be facilitating an exploration of  unschooling, and <br/>
of how deschooling ourselves and society can produce  personal/family change <br/>
and enhance the prospects for a sustainable society. We  are inviting a broad <br/>
cross-section of people to participate, from unschooling  parents to students <br/>
and teachers, from librarians and community workers to  artists. There are no <br/>
prerequisites, and affordable accommodation is available  at the university. <br/>
People far and wide regularly attend the Summer Institute to  combine a holiday <br/>
in downtown Toronto with a transformative learning experience.  Come and find <br/>
out how we can work together to broaden our families&#39; unschooling  experience <br/>
and create a learning society. For details, visit <br/>

  . Coincidentally, Natalie is researching and writing my life history as an  <br/>
unschooling activist for her PhD dissertation.<br/>
<br/>
My colleague Ron  Miller (Goddard College prof, writer and publisher of <br/>
holistic education book,  as well as the recently-defunct Paths of Learning <br/>
magazine) recently wrote to  update us about the credit course program that Goddard <br/>
College is developing for  homeschoolers. They had to start the program this <br/>
coming Fall, but the planning,  design and approval processes are apparently <br/>
taking longer than expected. So the  plan now is to launch it next March. The <br/>
related conference they had planned for  June will take place on September 9 to <br/>
11 instead. It will be an opportunity to  meet homeschoolers who have begun <br/>
college studies, to hear about their  experiences, and there will be workshops <br/>
for young people and parents about  beginning college. We&#39;ll make details <br/>
available as Ron sends them to  us.<br/>
