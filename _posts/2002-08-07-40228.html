 </span></blockquote>Yep....that &#39;s what I have been saying...Thanks for making more clarity.<br/>
If you need a piece of wood and it calls for 8.5 or 9ft you will have to buy <br/>
the 10ft piece and you can take the scrap that&#39;s left or leave it and they <br/>
will resell it, but you will be charged the 10ft price.......<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Keith&#39;s been doing a lot of woodworking lately.  Medieval boxes and <br/>
furniture.  He&#39;s just new at it.  He says some lumber is by the foot even at <br/>
Home Depot.    Maple, red oak, white oak.  Hardwood is really rare where we <br/>
are.  There&#39;s a lumber place, local, called Paxton&#39;s that sells exotic <br/>
hardwoods by the piece, and less exotic stuff by the foot.  Some of the <br/>
pieces are pretty small, but people are doing small projects with them too!  <br/>
<br/>
Mostly Keith&#39;s working with 1x10 or 2x8 or thereabout, and usually pine, and <br/>
that stuff&#39;s sold in 6&#39;, 8&#39; or 10&#39; boards and he buys the whole board.  And <br/>
takes it apart with his table saw.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-18997957">&lt;&lt;Nothing, except articles that fairly sing the praises of Fidel and Che, I<br/>
suppose.  I subscribe but I don&#39;t remember the article...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Probably because it didn&#39;t &quot;sing the praises&quot; of anybody.  It was basically<br/>
an article about present-day Cuba.  It had beautiful pictures of run-down<br/>
buildings and wonderful skies.<br/>
<br/>
It had a picture of some children in the main square in Havana and in the<br/>
background was a mural of Che.  All of my information on Che, Fidel and the<br/>
revolution came from reading lengthy and varied historical texts.<br/>
