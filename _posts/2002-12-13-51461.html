&lt;&lt; Not long ago there was some discussion of favorite movies pertaining to <br/>
unschooling. Of those, I remember one, Good Will Hunting. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I saved that someone else posted:<br/>
<br/>
how about &quot;The Secret of Roan Inish.&quot; John Sayles film. It only indirectly <br/>
fits your request, in that the main character doesn&#39;t seem to go to school <br/>
and also accomplishes some great things. Also, it&#39;s about adults respecting <br/>
and believing children. In any case, it&#39;s a great movie.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Poppins<br/>
<br/>
The Sound of Music<br/>
<br/>
My own list, which is in an article at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
is:<br/>
=================<br/>
<br/>
Watch some or all of these movies. If they make you think of any other movies <br/>
you haven’t seen for a while, or never got to see before, watch those too. <br/>
But watch these, with or without kids: <br/>
<br/>
Mary Poppins<br/>
Heidi (with Shirley Temple)<br/>
The Sound of Music<br/>
Searching for Bobby Fischer<br/>
Ferris Bueller’s Day Off<br/>
<br/>
You don’t need to think too hard about those movies. No tests, analysis or <br/>
reports. Just let the images and ideas flow through and over you. Come back <br/>
to them after a while, when you’ve been unschooling a while.<br/>
<br/>
=======================<br/>
<br/>
Marty and I watched Bill and Ted&#39;s Excellent Adventure the other day.   It&#39;s <br/>
goofy, but I think especially kids who are deschooling at older ages might <br/>
enjoy the irreverence toward school, and the scene showing Napoleon&#39;s army <br/>
was cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215205293">I have read and loved Gerald Durrell&#39;s book &quot;My Family And Other Animals&quot; which is about a couple years of his youth spent on the island of Corfu in Greece.  Recently I found the movie, called the same, and it was well done, by the BBC who does many wonderful movies.  The movies shows how he spends hours and hours watching the bugs and wildlife on the island learning about how the live.  He meets all kinds of people who teach him more things.  A well meaning friend tells the mother that he needs tutor to be &quot;educate&quot;.  He goes through a few tutors who cannot undertand how to teach this strange little boy who loves all things animal related.  He meets some fascinating people along the way and essentially unschools himself in spite of the well-meaning tutors.  The great thing is that this movie is based on the real life of Gerald Durrell and there are more books by him and about his experiences with animals all over the world if your.  I will say that there are a couple references to sex by Gerry&#39;s older brother and sister but no nudity or suggestive scenes.  The nature photography is wonderful and the boy who plays Gerry is great.  <br/>
<br/>
Another favorite of my 3 year old son is &quot;Linnea in Monet&#39;s Garden&quot; where Linnea and her elderly neighbor, after reading about and studying Monet&#39;s paintings they decide to visit the actual garden where Monet lived and painted.  The movie alternates between the animated Linnea and her world and the actual garden of Monet.  I thought it was slow moving and that it wouldn&#39;t be interesting to my very active three year old but he loves it!  <br/>
