<div id="ygrps-yiv-118985912">Hi, I am a lurker, but I have this experience to share<br/>
about this topic.<br/>
<br/>
I wore braces for 4 years,starting at 12, same &#39;bite<br/>

thousand $$$ (which I was very aware of too), headgear<br/>
in the DAYTIME sometimes (as ordered--how GEEKY is<br/>
THAT?), then visible retainers till 21.  I went to<br/>
another orthodontist in adult life (for protein<br/>

bull-hockey and that those pulled teeth are why I have<br/>
a weaker chin and unbalanced face profile and my bite<br/>
would have been fine if orthodontia had been postponed<br/>
until 20&#39;s. <br/>

Also said that there can be root damage from moving<br/>

Glad my teeth are straight, but...<br/>
<br/>
My dh had his done in his thirties. He had awful teeth! Took three <br/>
years and cost the same amount as what I paid $2000. Our <br/>
oldest has had orthodontia and it cost us $7000 and a treatment <br/>
that is now questioned as being long term effective.<br/>
<br/>
We are spending another $6000 for our daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I keep saying to my dh--isn&#39;t it just easier and cheaper as <br/>
adults?<br/>

I agree Kim!<br/>
I had mine at 16, which I think was waiting long enough. But to put them on <br/>
young children is not a good idea most times.<br/>
Our orthodontist said it was ridiculous to put braces on anyone without all <br/>
adult teeth in and if they wanted to it was just about money.<br/>
He also said that almost all problems could be corrected with braces alone, <br/>
no need for headgear...he never used it.<br/>
He did use spacers sometimes though.<br/>
Anyhoo...just my experience.<br/>

Holly is two years into that situation. The orthodontist recommended to us by <br/>
people we trust won&#39;t put braces on her until all her teeth are in.  Her <br/>
bicuspids are taking their sweet time.  One is peeking now, and the other <br/>
still not.   So the ortho office smiles and says &quot;We&#39;ll wait!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, younger friends of hers have pink braces and purple braces and <br/>
they come loose, and they break, and they lose retainers, and Holly waits.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby could use braces for perfection purposes, if he wanted to.  But he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to.  He has a bigger-than-life social scene already, and if <br/>
anyone wants to avoid him because his teeth aren&#39;t perfect, well fine.  <br/>
That&#39;s just one less birthday gift he needs to buy.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-268833996">Hi, I have a question for anyone with experience on this subject: our 5yr+ old daughter has an unarguable underbite; Marine bulldog to be specifically descriptive.  In the dentist chair for a cleaning and routine checkup ( at about 3and1/2yrs. old,) she was pronounced a definite candidate for orthodontic work.  We&#39;ve been told by more than one professional that she is a &quot;level 2,&quot; (?)  and likely scenarios include the pulling of some baby teeth (should they not fall out soon enough naturally,) braces, retainers, headgear, and possibly the pulling of some permanent teeth if her mouth is crowded. There has been supposition that if she doesn&#39;t have the alteration of her teeth done in a timely fashion, she may require shortening of her jaw bone(!) as an adult, ( necessitating surgery and wiring.) This diagnosis is concerning and distressing  to me, actually more than a little frightening-- I didn&#39;t have braces, and don&#39;t know the ropes (or rubber bands,) so to speak.  My daughter has very clearly made it known that she doesn&#39;t want braces.  My husband and I are of the mind to wait it out...against traditional orthodontic wisdom. I have noticed some wear on her 2 front and center upper teeth (baby ones,) indicating that her present bite does indeed affect the integrity of enamel,etc.  Any counsel?<br/>
Thank-you, Laura.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-285766631">Hi, <br/>
I just happen to be here today and I read your post. I wore braces as a teen and without them I would have looked a little like Dracula, needless to say I&#39;m happy with my adjusted smile. My three kids have all needed work. Dh has large teeth large mouth, I have the opposite, kids are a mess. My oldest had his eye teeth growing in the roof of his mouth and needed surgery to bring them down but unfortunately this wasn&#39;t noticed early enough and the eye teeth dissolved the root of another tooth it was pushing against and that tooth was lost. It was a mess but it&#39;s all come together all right in the end. As a result of this experience I started my younger two much earlier and their results are great!!! Their ortho used new a new method on them called palatal expansion. The older one had a rapid expander because his growth was already more advanced and the younger one wears a bite-plate that she expands once a week with a little key. These expanders are making possible for them to fit all of their teeth into their mouths in a straight line. The bottom jaw expands naturally to suit the upper, no appliance is needed. Anyway, to make a long story short, shop around until you find a doctor that is up on the latest techniques and satisfies ALL of your concerns. Orthodonture has come a long way in the past couple of years. It&#39;s a big expense and demands thorough research but IMO it is well worthwhile and can save one from lots of trouble in the future. My experience is the younger you start the easier it is and the more teeth that can be saved etc... <br/>
<br/>
good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981882624">Dear Leslie,<br/>
Thanks for responding and for sharing your experience--which sounds vast!  Now that I have read your post, I will bring up the topic of  &quot;expanders&quot; in any future meetings with orthodontists.  I was hoping to go the least invasive route; just want to be thorough in my investigation and not jump into some complicated, or even unnecessary procedure(s).  Thank-you again for your contribution, Laura.<br/>
