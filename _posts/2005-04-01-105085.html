<div id="ygrps-yiv-971131559">-------Would you be able to send me the Lyrics to the Days of<br/>
the week song English/Spanish. And the others also if<br/>
it is not to much trouble. Thank You so much.------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Joy, <br/>
Here are some, I hope I get them right, Richard isn&#39;t around to correct me!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really know the tune, except to sing it.  <br/>
<br/>
Sun--day Mon--day, <br/>
Tues--day Wednes--day,<br/>
Thurs---day Friiiiiiiiii--day,<br/>
Saturday,<br/>
one two three four,<br/>
five six seven,<br/>
seven daaaaaaaays <br/>
are in the weeeeeek,<br/>
Domin---go Lu---nes,<br/>
Martes Mi-er-coles,<br/>
Jueves Viiiiiiiiiiie---rnes,<br/>
Sabado,<br/>
uno dos tres, <br/>
quatro cinco seis,<br/>
siete diaaaaas <br/>
en la semaaaaana.<br/>
<br/>
Meeeeeeerrrrrcuryyyyyyyyyy, <br/>
Venus Earth and Mars,<br/>
AAAAAsteroooiiid Belt,<br/>
Jupiter is next,<br/>
and Saturn with its rings,<br/>
Uranus Neptune Pluto <br/>
are the rest <br/>
around the sun they travel.<br/>
(repeats, getting quieter and quieter)<br/>
<br/>
sing-songy:<br/>
North America<br/>
South America <br/>
Africa Europe and Asia<br/>
North America<br/>
South America <br/>
Africa Europe and Asia<br/>
don&#39;t forget Austra----lia <br/>
don&#39;t forget Ant-arc-tica<br/>
North America <br/>
South America<br/>
Africa Europe and Asia<br/>
<br/>
The State song has all of them in alphabetical order, and is sung as fast as you can.<br/>
Al-----a----bama and Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colo-ra-do I like this ma!  Connecticut and Delaware, then Flor-i-da is next, but Georgia and Hawa-i-i really are the best!  I--da-ho, I--ll-in-ois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas and Kentucky, Louisiana Maine, Maryland and Massachusetts, Michigan YEA!<br/>
(right here there is this little doo doot doo doo doo doo doot doot doo thing)<br/>
Min-ne-sota Mississippi Missouri and more, there&#39;s Montana and Nebraska, I like this score, Nevada and New Hampshire, New Jerseys really neat, New Mexico and New York just can&#39;t be beat!  North Car----o----lina, North Da--ko--ta,  O-hi-o and Oklaho-ma, O---regon, Theres Pennsylvania and Rhode Island too, South Carolina South Dakota, YA HOO!<br/>
(do doot doo doo doo doo doot doot doo)<br/>
Tennessee and Texas, and theres Utah I say, Ve-rmont and Vir-gin-ia, now you&#39;ve made my day, Wash-ing-ton and West Virginia and Wisconsin is my friend, and Wyoming is the last state and we&#39;ve made it to the end!  <br/>
<br/>
The state capital song is very similar, just naming the states (in alphabetical order) with their capitals: <br/>
Mont-gom-ry, Al-a-bam-a, Ju-neau, Al-ask-a, Phoe-nix, Ar-i-zon-a and Lit-tle Rock, Ar-kan-sas!, Sac-ra-men-to, Cal-i-forn-ia,<br/>
..and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is a really cool song that lists some things about each state, here is part (from the middle):<br/>
View the Rio Grande River on a sunny day,<br/>
New Mexico is the place where I want to stay.<br/>
The statue of Liberty is quite a view,<br/>
In the state of New York, there&#39;s Niagara Falls too.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is still available on a tape,  I only have a copy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468937112">There&#39;s a good months of the year song on a tape Discovery Toys used to sell. <br/>
 I see them used sometimes.  It&#39;s called &quot;Sounds Like Fun.&quot;  Good little <br/>
songs, but all about 60 beats per minute, nap-rate.  That&#39;s fine. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of those we had a BLAST with was a song about counting by tens.  We&#39;d <br/>
mess with it.  It really goes <br/>
&quot;I can count by tens up to a hundred, <br/>
I can count by tens, ready here I go:<br/>
10, 20, 30,<br/>
40, 50, 60,<br/>
70, 80, 90,<br/>
One Hundred.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty once sang (with feeling), <br/>
I can count by ones up to one,<br/>
I can count by ones, ready here I go:<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
AH, there it is:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.discoverytoysinc.com/toys2g.htm">http://www.discoverytoysinc.com/toys2g.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
We still have ours, and it lasted way longer in fun ways than just for <br/>
babies. <br/>
<br/>
When we got a scanner and adobe photoshop, that alphabet chart (it shows in <br/>
the photo) was one of the first things we scanned in to preserve and repair.  <br/>
<br/>
They got days of the week from the Yankee Doodle tune, but months of the year <br/>
they got from this tape.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m new, and have not yet posted an intro, but had to jump in with my <br/>
vote for &quot;18 Wheels on a Big Rig&quot;  by Trout Fishing In America <br/>
(really!)  They do odds, evens, Roman Numerals, etc...<br/>
We first heard it, and some of you fans of morning radio will <br/>
recognize this, on the John Boy and Billy Big Show.  Way before we <br/>
had kids, my husband used to sing it in the shower!  He still sings <br/>
it in the shower, but now with back-up vocals from Cassidy (4) and <br/>
Adam(2).  It sounds way better now!<br/>
&quot;OOOO There&#39;s 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 Wheeeels <br/>
on a big rig, and they&#39;re rollin&#39;, rollin&#39; rollin&#39;!&quot;  Cracks me up <br/>
every time!  <br/>
The cd is called &quot;Mine&quot; and has other great songs as well!</div>
