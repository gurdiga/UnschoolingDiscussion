<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224213588">tracy- I can&#39;t help but put my 2 cents in-I have nursed 4 children and am a <br/>
LLL Applicant too and can&#39;t read that breastmilk is good but not superior to <br/>
bottlefeeding without getting a knot in my stomache b/c it is just plain <br/>
wrong scientifically! Mother&#39;s milk is not only the perfect food b/c it is <br/>
species-specific to meet all nutritional needs (some that we have not even <br/>
&quot;discovered&quot; yet) of babies, but a mother&#39;s body makes the perfect milk for <br/>
her own baby and the perfect milk for the specific time of the day her baby <br/>
is nursing and the composition of the milk changes even within one single <br/>
feeding-thinner and thirst-quenching in the beginning and more fat content to <br/>
satiate hunger toward the middle to end of the nursing session! Amazing, huh? <br/>
But I have never even suggested other mothers I know-IRL or online-nurse. It <br/>
is none of my business what they choose! <br/>
