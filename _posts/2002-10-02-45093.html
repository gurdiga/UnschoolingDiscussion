I know a couple who, after the boys &quot;act up&quot;, will ask them how many swats it <br/>
deserves. They could be out to supper or visiting a friend or at the park, <br/>
but the punishment gets to wait until they get home. It doesn&#39;t matter how <br/>
good they are after that---they DESERVE to be punished. The boys get to <br/>
&quot;decide&quot; how severe the punishment should be---how many licks with the <br/>
paddle---now that they are &quot;old enough&quot; to make those decisions, of course! <br/>
(&#39;though I&#39;m sure that if they decide not to be severe ENOUGH, the punishment <br/>
could be even harsher!)  When they get home, they &quot;march&quot; upstairs, pull down <br/>
their pants, and take the lickin&#39; like little soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
Their parents also feel that punishments should not be given in the heat of <br/>
anger.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s probably a good idea because if that&#39;s what they&#39;ll do in cold <br/>
blood---can you imagine what the parents are capable of in the heat of the <br/>
moment???<br/>
