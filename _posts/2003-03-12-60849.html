<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513527181">An acquaintance of mine was telling me about her daughter (12 yo) who was <br/>
spanked the other day in school in front of her peers, I can&#39;t remember the <br/>
offense.  She was not surprised just noting something that happened.<br/>
<br/>
Not wanting to offend her and make her defensive but still wanting to make <br/>
her think, I said I was appalled that schools still did that.  I thought that <br/>
was abandoned years ago.  She said Oh no but now you have to sign a consent <br/>
form to allow them to do it.  I said I couldn&#39;t imagine a stranger laying a <br/>
hand on my child and me not going off the handle.  And the embarrassment of <br/>
doing it in front of peers.  I told her how I would feel if that happened to <br/>
me. Imagine signing a paper to allow your child to be hit. I know she does <br/>
spank at home as a form of punishment.  She kind of paused for a minute and <br/>
thought about it.  Not sure if anything came out of our little conversation <br/>
and of course we talked more about it. <br/>
<br/>
 It amazes her that I don&#39;t use punishment and yet have well Behaved kids.  I <br/>
hate those words too &quot;well behaved.&quot;  No one ever says that about me.  Is <br/>
that supposed to mean I am a good parent?  <br/>
Anyway enough rambling for this morning.<br/>

  &lt;&gt;WARNING:  The following post is deeply disturbing to non-violent, <br/>
  non-punishment oriented parents. Unschoolers beware! Do not read if <br/>
  violence towards children will ruin your day. Seriously.  I can&#39;t <br/>
  even believe this stuff still goes on in our schools. THIS will help <br/>
  some people understand why I think  things are different in the <br/>
  South. Ugh.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  If you really want to put yourself into total shock about what is <br/>
  actually going on in the schools go get a job as a substitute <br/>
  teacher, especially in an urban school system.  I have written <br/>
  volumes from my &quot;in the trenches&quot; experience as a sub.  It is so much <br/>
  worse than most can imagine.  So if you live in an urban area and can <br/>
  qualify for a sub license or certificate then try it, just for a <br/>
  little while, and you will quickly know why we homeschool and why we <br/>
  unschool.  So much psychological brutality out there that it amazes <br/>
  me.  And the folks doing it really believe they are helping the <br/>
  children.  I even run into parents who still say to me that if the <br/>
  schools would just reinstate the paddle that things would be much <br/>
  better!  I take the time to talk to them, to try to get them to <br/>
  understand a different point of view.  Sometimes I think a little bit <br/>
  gets through.  Most of the time, not.  <br/>
<br/>
  And I don&#39;t live in Florida, or the south, but in the heart of the <br/>
  midwest, in Ohio.  Some days it is just too much and I can&#39;t sub <br/>
  again for a long time.  Right now I am about to do some other <br/>
  contract work, which will give me another bit to write about, <br/>
  correcting state proficiency exams from different states.  That will <br/>
  keep me out of the schools for the rest of this school year, but I am <br/>
  sure I will have an even more interesting subject to report after six <br/>
  months of learning all about these tests and how they are graded.  <br/>
<br/>
  If you&#39;re not up to subjecting yourself to being in the schools just <br/>
  rest assured that paddling is not the worst of what is going on in <br/>
  many of them.  <br/>
