<div id="ygrps-yiv-748745822">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I have been studying Karl Marx for awhile now and yesterday was reading &quot;Marxism vs. Christianity&quot;.  The book talked at length about how Marx viewed an unfettered man as a whole man.  About how back before industrialization when people saw more personal purpose to their work, when the work was their own rather than to be bought and sold, they were more intact.  He talks about how when a person&#39;s labor went from being a regular part of his life (like farming or artisan) to something outside of himself that he sold to the highest bidder, the person became alienated from himself.  He wrote &quot;As individuals express their lives, so are they.&quot;  Meaning that when a person&#39;s labor (the expressions of their lives) is out there to be judged by others, accepted or rejected, hired or fired, the person loses his humanity.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about that in response to schooling.  When we take a child&#39;s labor (learning) and turn it into something to be judged (test scores, worksheets), something outside of the child himself, do we cause alienation for that child?  Is that why deschooling can seem such a painful process at times ....as the child reintegrates his being?  Could that be why unschooling children seem so much more alive and joyful.....they are whole?<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering what anyone else might think about it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Could it also be why radical unschooling parents are perceived as <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve joked often about unschoolers &quot;cheating,&quot; and while it&#39;s a humorous <br/>
statement, there&#39;s a chilling reality and truth underneath.<br/>
<br/>
Our school-found culture prized independent thought.  Those schools which try <br/>
to teach groups, or universities in which three people work together on a <br/>
project or paper are considered wrong, lazy, trouble-making.   We do NOT <br/>
prize cooperation.  It&#39;s wimpy.  &quot;Cooperative games&quot; are for the disabled, in <br/>
most people&#39;s minds.  For the mentally unstable.  For those who can&#39;t handle <br/>
a REAL competitive situation.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most horrible things any college student can do is to cheat.  <br/>
Cheat at a military academy, and your future takes a sudden 90-degree turn.<br/>
<br/>
The reason they can&#39;t &quot;cheat&quot; is that grading is competitive.<br/>
<br/>
The reason grades are important is it proves you &quot;earned&quot; something--they&#39;re <br/>
paying you for your cooperation and time sacrificed, and tasks performed, and <br/>
hoops jumped.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about learning the material.  It&#39;s about the combination of <br/>
memorization, performance, humility, punctuality/attendance, payment-making <br/>
(finances cannot be forgotten in education!) and turning the other cheek.<br/>
<br/>
So high school is to prepare you for that.  So mid-school/jr. high prepares <br/>
you for *that,* and on down to pre-school.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, off the track entirely, are unschoolers.  Their goal isn&#39;t &quot;to <br/>
earn&quot; or to compete.  Their goal is to learn.  <br/>
<br/>
Their goal isn&#39;t to be the best-outfitted kid on the first day of school, and <br/>
to earn the most friends of their age group.  It&#39;s to wear something <br/>
comfortable, collect things around them they enjoy, and have adult friends, <br/>
older kid-friends, younger kid-friends, or no friends at all.  Just whatever.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Just whatever&quot; doesn&#39;t fit on the American chart, except for the homeless <br/>
guys ranting on the street corners, and they&#39;re often criminals.  They&#39;re <br/>
trespassing, loitering vagrants.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s how we cheat:  Unschoolers never once ever have to &quot;do it on their <br/>
own.&quot;  They&#39;re  never told &quot;YOU SIT THERE UNTIL YOU GET IT RIGHT, MISTER!&quot; or <br/>
&quot;Did you have help with that project?&quot;  (&quot;Yes&quot; is their best answer!)<br/>
<br/>
Because we turn our backs on the &quot;earning&quot; portion of the program, and <br/>
consider knowledge to be freely available to anyone interested in picking it <br/>
up, does that make it Marxist?  I don&#39;t think so.  There&#39;s an unlimited <br/>
supply of knowledge and thought.  Everyone can be rich.  Nobody can hoarde.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been thinking of this too and trying to work it out. Why it isn&#39;t<br/>
really such a big jump for the marxist revolutionaries I went to college<br/>
with to now do power brokerage for the Republicans. I think the common<br/>
thread is a belief in the rights of the powerful to control. And so the<br/>
schools sort and socialize and ingrain that belief into our children<br/>
until they bow and scrape and kowtow to the those who wield that power.<br/>
<br/>
Learning one&#39;s place is the real lesson.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers don&#39;t know their place. ;)<br/>

place. We&#39;re here, we know where we are.  They just<br/>
can&#39;t find us. We aren&#39;t in their reality.<br/>
