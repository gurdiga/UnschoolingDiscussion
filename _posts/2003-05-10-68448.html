<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069148592">**I&#39;ve said this before here, but often I dodge my mother&#39;s arguements<br/>
by the<br/>
non sequitor reply.  She makes comments about what Tim is missing in school,<br/>
and I chatter about how well he&#39;s doing in a whole different area -- soccer,<br/>
cub scouts, dance, etc.  When she&#39;s talking about school, I do NOT mention<br/>
the things he does do at the school, like his &quot;library class&quot; or chess club.<br/>
I save those for complaints about his eating.  And so on.<br/>
<br/>
We have really wierd conversations, but hey, it&#39;s less painful than the<br/>
fights!**<br/>

Hi, Brenda --<br/>
<br/>
I love it!  Dodge like a butterfly, buzz away like a bee.  &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>
