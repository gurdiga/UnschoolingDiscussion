  Subject: [Unschooling-Discussion] Introduction and question: Is unschooling perfect?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hello.  Before I begin, I thought it would be best to introduce <br/>
  myself.  My name is Stephanie and I have two daughters, ages 3 and 6, <br/>
  who have never been to school.  I have been lurking here for about a <br/>
  year, and haven&#39;t ever really mustered up the nerve to post.  I read <br/>
  a lot, when I can, and this email list has been extremely inspiring <br/>
  and helpful to me.  So a quick &quot;thank you&quot; to all who contribute:  <br/>
  Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
  Now, the other bit.  I have been arguing with people I don&#39;t know <br/>
  about homeschooling, unschooling, and schooling today.  This is <br/>
  annoying in itself, but while I was mulling it over, this thought <br/>
  came to me:  I think it is telling that whenever people argue with me <br/>
  about school vs. home/unschooling, they always say, &quot;I will readily <br/>
  admit that school has it&#39;s problems, but nothing is perfect.&quot;  Yet, I <br/>
  have never felt the need to make a similar statement about <br/>
  unschooling (school-at-home maybe, but not unschooling).  And <br/>
  further, I don&#39;t think that many other unschoolers would feel the <br/>
  need to either.<br/>
<br/>
  But then I thought that maybe that wasn&#39;t entirely true.  Maybe other <br/>
  unschoolers do find that unschooling has its problems, maybe even <br/>
  ones I would agree with.  So, I decided to ask you all.<br/>
<br/>
  Does unschooling have its own problems?  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s perfect, <br/>
  but I do think it &lt;i&gt;works&lt;/i&gt;, while school does not.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, there we go.  My first real post.  Any thoughts? <br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; I loved one author&#39;s take on this attitude in people - it&#39;s very ingrained <br/>
in them - he called it MAS/DOS or something like that - &quot;Mad at <br/>
School/Defensive of School.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Everyone knows that govenment schooling is far less than perfect, but they <br/>
don&#39;t want to admit it because they don&#39;t want the responsibility to change.  <br/>
They are happy sending their children to people they don&#39;t even know and <br/>
expecting a product with no guarantee and no option to get a guarantee.  They would <br/>
not accept such poor service in any other area except with their children&#39;s <br/>
lives.  These same people see you enjoying your children and all the time you <br/>
spend with them and they assume that there is no way they could do that.  They <br/>
have been carefully conditioned to believe that it is way too hard to be a full <br/>
time parent educator.  And they are usually too selfish to try.<br/>
In my state, NY, it is hard to be an unschooler because of the stupid regs <br/>
and requirements and reports we have to write.  So I have to be creative and I <br/>
have to enlist my children&#39;s help.  For them to be able to keep their freedom <br/>
which they love there are minimum things they have to be able to do.  Because <br/>
they have to pass the stupid tests every year.  That is not too hard and they <br/>
do it.  <br/>
However both homeschoolers and non homeschoolers alike, at least in my area <br/>
think of homeschooling and schooling as about the same thing.  Keeping your <br/>
kids doing some sort of curriculum for 6 to 8 hours a day.   So simply to keep my <br/>
children safe, I am a closet unschooler.  I find that once they learn to read <br/>
 and begin to understand numbers my job is to keep them supplied with the <br/>
stuff they want to learn.  My oldest (still at home ), is 12 and he is teaching <br/>
himself all sorts of things on the computer about programming, about programs <br/>
like photoshop and illustrator.  He&#39;s making movies and writing a book.  He <br/>
reads constantly about the stuff he is interested in and sometimes things I <br/>
suggest.  He is working on making clay figurines....it goes on and on.  While his <br/>
little brother, who is 7, and is not reading yet,  is fascinated with the <br/>
animal world and just recently aquired frogs which caused us to do more research <br/>
and opened more worlds.  We regularly visit zoos, pet stores and have just <br/>
recently found an animal wildlife rehabilitator to get to know.  But I know that in <br/>
this state, because he is not reading yet, I could have a real problem.  My <br/>
oldest who is not at home anymore did not read until he was 9.  He graduated <br/>
from college.  hmm.  I don&#39;t think it was a problem.  I hate the box of <br/>
government schooling.  <br/>
I think my littlest would be labeled with so many labels by now if he was in <br/>
school.  Yes, I think unschooling is about perfect.  It sets up an attitude <br/>
that life is full of unlimited possibilities.<br/>

Anne Ohman is in New York State, and she&#39;s an unschooler.  I think at <br/>
www.unschooling.com in the states folder there are posts about unschooling in NY.<br/>
