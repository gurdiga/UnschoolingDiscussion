say, &quot;in just a minute&quot; and I, being confused and thinking a minute was a <br/>
second, would start chanting.. &quot;itsbeenaminute, itsbeenaminute, <br/>
itsbeenaminute&quot;    Of course she would say, &quot;It has not!, just give me a <br/>
minute&quot;  She really DID mean a minute ( or two at the most), but I thought <br/>
she was draggin her feet.. lol.  She thought I was just being a smartbutt, <br/>
and harassing her for not getting in gear to wait on me..  I know this <br/>
confusion lasted a while, because I remember when I learned that a minute was <br/>
60 seconds, I was like .. OHHHHH!, I didn&#39;t know that, and Mom was just as <br/>
surprised to find out that I was not clear on how long a minute was.  After <br/>
my revelaton, when Mom would say &quot; just a minute&quot;  I would count to 60 as <br/>
fast as I could.. LOL.. Then I later learned that a second lasts longer than <br/>
as fast as you can say it..  Anyway, as a result of this childhood confusion <br/>
( which is a favorite funny story around here), I learned to be specific <br/>
about times with my children and show them on the clock when I could &quot;do the <br/>
thing&quot; they requested<br/>
<br/>
DISCLAIMER<br/>
Of course, I only &quot;put my kids off&quot; when it it necessary.  Not often and not <br/>
for immediate needs they have.   Say for instance, I am making a sandwich for <br/>
one kid, and another asks for drink, I will say,<br/>
 &quot;I&#39;ll get it as soon as I am finished with this sandwich&quot;   <br/>
&quot;How long is that going to take???&quot;   <br/>
&quot;About 5 minutes, OK, then i will get your drink&quot;<br/>
I dont want any backlash of folks thinking I constantly put my kids off .  My <br/>
mom didnt do that to me either, her delays were always warranted.  And they <br/>
were probably a lot more stressful with a kid chanting  itsbeenaminute <br/>
itsbeenaminute itsbeenaminute..   .<br/>

like &quot;dreckly&quot;.   My Grandma also often answers the question &quot;how are you <br/>
doing today?&quot; with &quot;oh, same as common, I reckon&quot;   It took me a long time to <br/>
figure out that meant basically, &quot;as good as usual&quot;   Once my Dh made up a <br/>
list of commonly used terms around these parts..  I can recall a few of them<br/>
<br/>
comemightnie. ( come mighty nigh, or close to)  <br/>
&quot; I comemightnie cutting my finger off&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Comin&#39; uppa cloud ( its going to storm)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just cordin to cordin.  ( Its just according to according.) I really <br/>
don&#39;t understand this phrase, but Dh&#39;s family uses it often.   LIke.. &quot;Are we <br/>
going to go to the movies today?&#39; &quot; Well, its just all cordin to cordin&quot;... <br/>
Meaning, it depends on what the situation, circumstances, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
I know there are a ton more, but I cant think of them right now<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-973279990">I hope you went back and read your original post, which you felt was<br/>
misunderstood, before boiling over here.  Looking again at the words is<br/>
the only way you can understand what other people are seeing.  Not<br/>
looking at your words and getting defensive is a real time-waster.<br/>

[A complete paragraph from message 68846 in the archives.]<br/>
**When she asked me if she could smoke, I told her &quot;not today, maybe<br/>
tomorrow&quot;, when she would ask the next day &quot;is it tomorrow yet? can I<br/>
smoke now?&quot; I would just tell her it&#39;s today, we&#39;ll talk about your<br/>
smoking tomorrow. She soon grew tired of that conversation and took to<br/>
&quot;smoking&quot; crayons. Of course it was awkward sometimes for her to reach<br/>
in her little purse and pull out a crayon and start puffing on it and<br/>
tapping off the &quot;ashes&quot;. But that got us through.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It says clearly that on the &quot;next day&quot; you told her &quot;it&#39;s today&quot;<br/>
(implying it is not tomorrow) and you would talk about her smoking<br/>
tomorrow.  Well, when 24 more hours pass, it still isn&#39;t going to be<br/>
&quot;tomorrow&quot;, it&#39;s going to be &quot;today&quot; again.  It&#39;s not clear for readers<br/>
how many days this took place because the &quot;she soon grew tired&quot; phrasing<br/>
isn&#39;t specific about how many times she inquired again.  You know the<br/>
number and we don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no way to read what you wrote and think that some day you would<br/>
tell her &quot;Hey, you know what, it&#39;s not today any more.  Suddenly<br/>
tomorrow has arrived.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643096183">*This*  is why you need to stop posting and read Glena.<br/>
<br/>
Not only are you *not* reading what others have posted, but you are not even reading your own posts.  (Or if you are, you are not reading them for what they actually SAY).<br/>
<br/>
You consistantly say one thing and then &quot;take it back&quot;  several posts later. <br/>
<br/>
Put another way, you have a consistant habit of *not* saying what you mean, and *not* meaning what you say while you are forever trying to &quot;save face&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
There is no way anyone can have a discussion of any value with someone who never means what they say.  And not only does it take up space, but it wastes everyone&#39;s time.<br/>
<br/>
How you handled the smoking issue is a good example of this problem.  Its just plain dishonest and someday, if they haven&#39;t already, your children *will* pick up on that. <br/>

  &gt; Maybe THIS says it all, I NEVER said maybe tomorrow means NEVER, <br/>
  someone <br/>
  &gt; ELSE&#39;S words.  Over and over I&#39;ve said if she had wanted to do <br/>
  this, she <br/>
  &gt; would have.  I NEVER EVER MEANT NEVER.   <br/>
  &gt; This is the EXACT thing I&#39;ve been trying to argue about, SOMEONE <br/>
  DECIDES that <br/>
  &gt; I MEANT NEVER, they post it and it gets picked up as a FACT. <br/>
  &gt; I&#39;m judged as a &quot;friggin idiot&quot; because I said &quot;maybe tomorrow&quot; <br/>
  but meant <br/>
  &gt; NEVER, that was NOT the case.<br/>
<br/>
  Here&#39;s the original quote:<br/>
  &quot;When she asked me if she could smoke, I told her &quot;not today, maybe <br/>
  tomorrow&quot;, <br/>
  when she would ask the next day &quot;is it tomorrow yet? can I smoke <br/>
  now?&quot; I <br/>
  would just tell her it&#39;s today, we&#39;ll talk about your smoking <br/>
  tomorrow. She <br/>
  soon grew tired of that conversation and took to &quot;smoking&quot; crayons.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  You didn&#39;t say &quot;mabye tomorrow&quot; and mean it genuinely.  You <br/>
  said &quot;mabye tomorrow&quot; and then fooled with your daugther&#39;s mind the <br/>
  next day by saying &quot;it&#39;s today, we&#39;ll talk about your smoking <br/>
  tomorrow.&quot;  If your definition of &quot;tomorrow&quot; is that it never <br/>
  actually comes, then yes, you did mean NEVER.  You were just hiding <br/>
  the &quot;never&quot; from your daughter by taking advantage of her not-yet-<br/>
  firm grasp of time.  <br/>
  And I don&#39;t think that the &quot;friggin&#39; idiot&quot; comment had anything to <br/>
  do with your &quot;mabye tomorrow,&quot; I think it had to do with your <br/>
  implication that unschoolers were sitting fat and sassy and not <br/>
  helping anyone or something like that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Seems the thread continued way beyond me for a couple days.  But here&#39;s the <br/>
scoop, I know what I meant and if in my heart I know that I validated my <br/>
daughters question and responded to her in a way that satisfied her, then it <br/>
really shouldn&#39;t be something that is an issue, and so many years later too.<br/>
<br/>
So if 18 years ago I did/say something to my daughter that felt right to me, <br/>
is NOT seen as right by those who judge my parenting skills today... well <br/>
then I can live with that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve examined my motives, I&#39;ve thought about ways I could have handled the <br/>
situation differently, I&#39;ve read and re-read the posts about it.  No one <br/>
really said anything about a different or better way that it should/could <br/>
have been handled so basically it&#39;s a mute point, for me anyway.<br/>
<br/>
My children are grown and almost grown and smoking is something they will <br/>
decide for themselves.  I&#39;ve told them all I know about it and they know that <br/>
I don&#39;t do it, nor does their father.  Other family members do, they&#39;ve seen <br/>
the consequences, their uncle was buried less than a month ago because of it.<br/>
<br/>
I think that maybe it&#39;s not about smoking or not smoking or saying maybe <br/>
tomorrow or in a minute or just a second.  It&#39;s about someone saying what <br/>
THEY would do differently, not just saying you are WRONG, say what YOU would <br/>
have done to make the situation BETTER.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen several posts with mothers who&#39;ve said they&#39;ve examined their &quot;in a <br/>
minute&quot; or &quot;just a second&quot; words to their children and are working to make it <br/>
a true statement to their children.  I think that is good for them, for their <br/>
children and good for those of us who are on the unschooling path and looking <br/>
for examples of ways to be the best we can be at this awesome job called <br/>

<br/>
I hope it&#39;s clear to those who constantly say how much I, personally post and <br/>
detract from the group, that discussions go on without me.  I might bring up <br/>
something that causes one to think or challenge or say how wrong I am, but I <br/>
am not the one doing the only &quot;endless posting&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about this for several days.  I don&#39;t mind people telling <br/>
me I&#39;m doing something wrong, I don&#39;t even care so much what they think of <br/>
me.  BUT if they are going to take the time to point out loudly and clearly <br/>
that something is WRONG and driving them to the point of insanity as some <br/>
have said, then how about offering some advice on how to do it RIGHT.<br/>
<br/>
Say, you are WRONG because ___________ and _______________ and __________ and <br/>
maybe you should have tried ________ and __________ and ____________.<br/>
<br/>
I see/hear a lot about something being the WRONG way and not at all helpful <br/>
and being hurtful to one&#39;s children but the truth is there is not a lot <br/>
posted by those who yell wrong or hurtful about an alternative way to do <br/>
whatever it was that was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Threads can go on and on about a wrong way or a personality but they rarely <br/>
go on with idea after idea of how one might handle a particular situation the <br/>
right way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678244305">&lt;snip&gt; so why wouldn&#39;t I respond yet again?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Simply because you said *again* that you wouldn&#39;t.  That you were done with <br/>
it, if I recall.  I can go back for quotes if needed.  I recently posted <br/>
that as long as someone continues to bring up harmful parenting practices, <br/>
those that find them harmful will do their damndest to point the mistakes <br/>
out, getting the last word in if necessary, so that there will be little <br/>
doubt in anyone&#39;s mind that it is something to be avoided.  Giving up on and <br/>
ignoring harmful parenting choices, in my mind, leaves the door open for <br/>
someone to think I agree with it.  As I&#39;ve read, I&#39;m not the only one who <br/>
feels this way.  Some choose to drop it for lengths sake.  Others choose to <br/>
continue to follow up when the response is, &quot;it was my child, my choice, if <br/>
you don&#39;t like it don&#39;t listen&quot;.<br/>

know you&#39;re frustrated. The whole list is getting frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
I know many people think I&#39;m too lenient with these arguments. And I&#39;d be<br/>
lenient this time too except that the list has gotten so busy since January.<br/>
We&#39;re averaging 150 emails a day -- and the volume wasn&#39;t (until the past<br/>
couple of days) even generated by argument. It&#39;s mostly been unschooling<br/>
discussion. But that&#39;s too many emails for the list to serve it&#39;s purpose.<br/>
The list just can&#39;t handle the noise you&#39;re adding on top of that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to have to put you on moderation. You can post but I&#39;ll be<br/>
deciding whether they go through to the list or not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry but there&#39;s only so many ways I can try explaining to you what it<br/>
is you&#39;re doing that&#39;s causing the disruption to the list and what you can<br/>
do to fix it. Either I&#39;m not clear or you just can&#39;t see it so I&#39;ll have to<br/>
do the seeing for you to help the list get back to usefulness.<br/>

Oh Glena. The discussions move on. They evolve. They go deeper and go <br/>

lists do. That&#39;s what this discussion was doing. It was moving to a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-806998572">A long time ago, in another unschooling venue, someone talked about  <br/>
unplugging their tv and telling the kids it was &quot;broken.&quot; That sparked  <br/>
a LOT of discussion about lying to children. Some people felt like they  <br/>
were called liars and they got really angry and left. In the meantime,  <br/>
a whole bunch of people took some time to give some deep thought to how  <br/>
truthful they really generally were with their kids - we considered  <br/>
together how sometimes we parents can take advantage of kids&#39; innocence  <br/>
and let them believe something we know is not true, for our own  <br/>
convenience or so as not to have to disappoint them or to avoid  <br/>
difficult conversations. We talked about what the effect of that might  <br/>
be. It was a great discussion and I know for a fact that it had a major  <br/>
impact in the lives of a number of people and that includes some who  <br/>
signed off in a huff, but came back a year or two later saying, &quot;You  <br/>
were right and I was wrong and it was painful but I&#39;m glad you called  <br/>
it as you saw it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We are ALL here to learn - that includes those who give advice and ask  <br/>
the tough questions. Nobody here has it all nailed down - our kids grow  <br/>
and change and we face new challenges.<br/>
<br/>
I have a really serious suggestion for you Glyna. PLEASE consider it.  <br/>
When you feel criticized, try just responding with something like: &quot;Oh  <br/>
- hmmm - I hadn&#39;t looked at it that way, but thanks for giving me a  <br/>
different perspective.&quot; And then just stop. Think about it privately -  <br/>
get what you can from it - and let it go. Save the arguments and all  <br/>
the re-explaining for just one or two big huge issues a year - things  <br/>
that are REALLY important to you.<br/>
<br/>
I KNOW how hard that is - some people are enviably good at taking  <br/>
criticism, while some of us have to overcome the urge to defend  <br/>
ourselves. Some of us tend to think that if someone disagrees with us  <br/>
or sees things differently than we do, that they must not understand  <br/>
what we really meant. I think you are like this. So am I.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m suggesting that you try this. Stop arguing. Stop explaining and  <br/>
re-explaining. Trust the people on the list to understand you the first  <br/>
time and let it go when a couple of people criticize or don&#39;t seem to  <br/>
understand what you say.<br/>

&gt;&gt; The more you argue over that sentence, the more this issue cannot be<br/>
&gt;&gt; laid to rest and the SAME emails will continue.  If you are insistent<br/>
&gt;&gt; that you are correct on this then just agree in your heart to<br/>
&gt;&gt; disagree and move foward.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Seems the thread continued way beyond me for a couple days.  But  <br/>
&gt; here&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; scoop, I know what I meant and if in my heart I know that I validated  <br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; daughters question and responded to her in a way that satisfied her,  <br/>
&gt; then it<br/>
&gt; really shouldn&#39;t be something that is an issue, and so many years  <br/>
&gt; later too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So if 18 years ago I did/say something to my daughter that felt right  <br/>
&gt; to me,<br/>
&gt; is NOT seen as right by those who judge my parenting skills today...  <br/>
&gt; well<br/>
&gt; then I can live with that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve examined my motives, I&#39;ve thought about ways I could have handled  <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; situation differently, I&#39;ve read and re-read the posts about it.  No  <br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; really said anything about a different or better way that it  <br/>
&gt; should/could<br/>
&gt; have been handled so basically it&#39;s a mute point, for me anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My children are grown and almost grown and smoking is something they  <br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; decide for themselves.  I&#39;ve told them all I know about it and they  <br/>
&gt; know that<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t do it, nor does their father.  Other family members do,  <br/>
&gt; they&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt; the consequences, their uncle was buried less than a month ago because  <br/>
&gt; of it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think that maybe it&#39;s not about smoking or not smoking or saying  <br/>
&gt; maybe<br/>
&gt; tomorrow or in a minute or just a second.  It&#39;s about someone saying  <br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; THEY would do differently, not just saying you are WRONG, say what YOU  <br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; have done to make the situation BETTER.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve seen several posts with mothers who&#39;ve said they&#39;ve examined  <br/>
&gt; their &quot;in a<br/>
&gt; minute&quot; or &quot;just a second&quot; words to their children and are working to  <br/>
&gt; make it<br/>
&gt; a true statement to their children.  I think that is good for them,  <br/>
&gt; for their<br/>
&gt; children and good for those of us who are on the unschooling path and  <br/>
&gt; looking<br/>
&gt; for examples of ways to be the best we can be at this awesome job  <br/>
&gt; called<br/>
&gt; mothering.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope it&#39;s clear to those who constantly say how much I, personally  <br/>
&gt; post and<br/>
&gt; detract from the group, that discussions go on without me.  I might  <br/>
&gt; bring up<br/>
&gt; something that causes one to think or challenge or say how wrong I am,  <br/>
&gt; but I<br/>
&gt; am not the one doing the only &quot;endless posting&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been thinking about this for several days.  I don&#39;t mind people  <br/>
&gt; telling<br/>
&gt; me I&#39;m doing something wrong, I don&#39;t even care so much what they  <br/>
&gt; think of<br/>
&gt; me.  BUT if they are going to take the time to point out loudly and  <br/>
&gt; clearly<br/>
&gt; that something is WRONG and driving them to the point of insanity as  <br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; have said, then how about offering some advice on how to do it RIGHT.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Say, you are WRONG because ___________ and _______________ and  <br/>
&gt; __________ and<br/>
&gt; maybe you should have tried ________ and __________ and ____________.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I see/hear a lot about something being the WRONG way and not at all  <br/>
&gt; helpful<br/>
&gt; and being hurtful to one&#39;s children but the truth is there is not a lot<br/>
&gt; posted by those who yell wrong or hurtful about an alternative way to  <br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; whatever it was that was wrong.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Threads can go on and on about a wrong way or a personality but they  <br/>
&gt; rarely<br/>
&gt; go on with idea after idea of how one might handle a particular  <br/>
&gt; situation the<br/>
&gt; right way.<br/>

You shouldn&#39;t have told us the story.<br/>
If it helped YOU, fine.  Put it in your journal.<br/>

If you have things to share here that will help other unschoolers, share <br/>
those things.<br/>

Don&#39;t share how you feel about how we feel about something you&#39;re not sure <br/>

IF you think this is about people, then start a yahoo group to discuss <br/>

about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>

so emails and you try to zip it!&gt;&gt;<br/>

Tory wasn&#39;t disrupting the list.<br/>
<br/>
When I used the evil friggin-idiot-then line, it was DIRECTLY in defense of <br/>
this list&#39;s contributions to unschooling and more-aware parenting.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve used something worse NOT in defense of unschooling, but in defense <br/>
of... can&#39;t tell what.  Of allowing people the latitude to continue to <br/>
disrupt the list?<br/>
<br/>
If I were to say this would be my last post (which it will not be) and then <br/>
posted again, I&#39;d understand if people commented.  If I did that half a dozen <br/>
times and they laughed at me about it, it would be because I broke my word <br/>
half a dozen times, not because they were mean people.<br/>

I felt it was disrupting an already heated issue with Glena.  I will not say <br/>
I accept Glena&#39;s choices, but I didn&#39;t Dam her for it either.<br/>
Yes, post after post is disruptive.  I would have liked to see her read many <br/>
posts before she commented but again.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My thoughts are that it takes more than a day or a week to break bad habits <br/>
or parenting errors.  Do I think she should have cut down on posts, yes. Do I <br/>
think that she should not respond to attacks, maybe some. The issue is that <br/>
she is one and the group is much bigger and it can be overwhelming. She <br/>
received many good responses but then a few did more harm than good.<br/>
<br/>
For Instance<br/>
I have a friend who is finally going to take her children out of school. Six <br/>
months ago I almost lost this friendship over just Homeschooling <br/>
conversations. I have been criticized by her for my choice to Unschool.  I <br/>
have explained Unschooling more times than I can remember. <br/>
I have shown her example questions that one may want to know about <br/>
Unschooling. I talk with her every day.  She says she is going to Unschool <br/>
but still says she will buy math and science books.  <br/>
Week after week for at least 3 months I have explained it all to her. I have <br/>
answered questions. I have printed information for her. I have given her <br/>
books on Unschooling and still &quot;math and science&quot; they will need books <br/>
because she doesn&#39;t know enough about the subjects.<br/>
Im not giving up on her and im not going to get mad at her. I will repeat it <br/>
until she is ready to hear me.  <br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s not always that the person isn&#39;t listening or reading right it is <br/>
when they are ready to hear and read what is written. But if those words come <br/>
out wrong as they do in the case of a child you loose them and have to begin <br/>
all over again.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The list goes on all weekend about HER and you expect her not to post!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The list has gone on about the ideas she stirred up and about the effects<br/>
she&#39;s had on the list.<br/>
<br/>
When it&#39;s been personal it&#39;s been about Sandra :-/<br/>
<br/>
Glena said she was done. Apparently she wasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s not about Glena. It&#39;s about the idea of integrity and using words<br/>
to mean what they say. It&#39;s about the effect our personal philosophies can<br/>
have on how well we can get what we want from life.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve been here a month. Glena&#39;s been here 4.<br/>
<br/>
(Hmm. Her joining coincides with the increase in numbers of posts. The past<br/>
couple of weeks have been busy with unschooling talk and I was projecting<br/>
that back and assuming the massive numbers of posts (nearly double the<br/>
normal rate) in January and April were also unschooling. But I&#39;m betting at<br/>
least January was Glena too.)<br/>
<br/>
The list has been incredibly patient with Glena&#39;s inability to understand<br/>
what she writes and her inability to understand what others write. Any anger<br/>
towards her claims is understandable to those who&#39;ve been trying to read<br/>
every post since January.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Get off your horse, say something other than running behind someone else&#39;s<br/>
&gt; words and get over it for cry-n out loud.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is personal. Not about ideas. Not about unschooling. Not about helping<br/>
the list work better. (Though we really shouldn&#39;t be talking about the list,<br/>
it does come up. And I think it&#39;s helpful to clarify what the purpose of the<br/>
list is and how it works.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Im glad she is back all<br/>
&gt; the talking this weekend should have ended while she was gone and it didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s because the ideas her posts sparked are important to people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe you should go away for a weekend we will all blast you in a hundred or<br/>
&gt; so emails and you try to zip it!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
But if Tory or anyone promises not to speak further on something then<br/>
they&#39;ll lose integrity if they don&#39;t. And people on the list will be less<br/>
likely to trust what they say.<br/>
<br/>
If people use words to mean what they say, the list works a whole lot better<br/>
at helping people.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And that&#39;s the heart of the whole issue. The issue isn&#39;t what was done or<br/>
what worked or how well someone is able to read a situation with their<br/>
child, but whether it&#39;s a principle that others can use. Validating feelings<br/>
is good. Responding in ways that satisfy is good. But the list needs<br/>
examples so that people can understand how those principles work in<br/>
practice. This example created the *opposite* image in people&#39;s minds.<br/>
<br/>
Even if Glena was right and she read her daughter&#39;s needs and the situation<br/>
and did validate feelings and satisfied her, the example didn&#39;t help anyone<br/>
understand how to do that with their own kids. It, in fact, would have had<br/>
the opposite effect if someone else had tried it.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how good someone is at being an unschooler or being a mindful<br/>
parent, if they can&#39;t convey examples so others can help themselves be<br/>
better at unschooling or mindful parenting then they can&#39;t be much help on a<br/>
list. Maybe they&#39;d be great at a support group where people can see them in<br/>
action. Maybe they&#39;d only be great for their kids. (Which is ultimately<br/>
what&#39;s important.) And it&#39;s especially bad if someone gives examples that<br/>
create the opposite impression for other people.<br/>
<br/>
Glena is reading the criticism as though it&#39;s criticism of her and that<br/>
people are thinking bad things about her. But the criticism is about the<br/>
idea and whether it has created something that can help people on the list<br/>
become better parents. And the answer is no, it didn&#39;t. (Though the<br/>
resulting discussion about really meaning &quot;in a minute&quot; when you say &quot;in a<br/>
minute&quot; did!)<br/>
