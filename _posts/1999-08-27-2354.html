<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684352271"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; charge of cleaning up my brother&#39;s mess) Have you had a conversation with<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>In our house,  we talk about what makes our family work - the things we do <br/>
for each other and for our home.  I think kids want to feel like <br/>
they&#39;re contributing - like they&#39;re an important part of what makes <br/>
the family work.  Different members of our family prefer different <br/>
jobs,  so most of the time,  I would say that a choice is available.<br/>
I&#39;ve always also been flexible about timing, etc.  I don&#39;t expect <br/>
them to drop what they&#39;re doing immediately to clean the bathroom.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want to do that either.  When someone&#39;s not feeling well, <br/>
they probably won&#39;t have a job.  I think it&#39;s all about cooperation.<br/>
The kids are here all the time - not at school,  so they see what I <br/>
do and what their dad does.   They just seem to accept the fact that <br/>
they should help too.  Sometimes,  on days when we&#39;re feeling lazy,  <br/>
we try to help motivate each other.  My kids and I used to do <br/>
something we&#39;d call commercial cleaning.  We&#39;d find a tv show we <br/>
wanted to watch and then every time a commercial came on,  we&#39;d jump <br/>
up and run off to see how much of our job we could get done before it <br/>
was over.   Our house is never spotless, and it&#39;s never a case for <br/>
the health department.  It&#39;s just a normal, lived in house that we <br/>
all call ours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976114100">good question erin, i&#39;d like to know too. i went unschooling partly<br/>
because i was tired of telling my kids what to do all day and now i<br/>
still have to tell them thier chores. i will not do it all by my self<br/>
and they know they&#39;re resposibilities. like dd cleans the bathroom,<br/>
iwash dishes and vaccum, ds mows grass, empties garbage and brings in<br/>
fire wood in winter instead of grass but they always must be reminded.<br/>
but icould let the grass go and the bath get horrid and they get<br/>
embarrassed if we get company. but i don&#39;t like to have that around me (<br/>
yucky bathroom or long grass.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241747270">Unschooling, though, is about choice. Why is dd in charge of the bathroom?<br/>
Did she chose that chore or did you assign it? Does she even use the<br/>
bathroom or is she tidy and someone else actually makes the mess so she is<br/>
resentful? (My chore was always cleaning the bathroom, and I&#39;m sorry, but<br/>
boys are very messy in the bathroom and I did not think I should be in<br/>
charge of cleaning up my brother&#39;s mess) Have you had a conversation with<br/>
your children about what needs to be done and what they see as thier<br/>
responsibility? Children like to pitch in and help around the house, but<br/>
they don&#39;t like being told what to do or how to do it!<br/>
<br/>
Just as a side note, notice how your chores are divided up, the boy doing<br/>
the outside work while the girl does the inside work. Sex stereotypes abound<br/>
and as a pre-teen I was very aware of them (still am:) and resentful of them<br/>
since I saw mowing the grass as fun while cleaning up the bathroom was<br/>
disgusting.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>

from the posts so far, i have at least received validation that there is a <br/>
question worth looking for an answer, tho i dont think it will be an easy <br/>
one!  i, like you, have noticed a shift from &quot;managing&quot; schooling to <br/>
&quot;managing&quot; chores...  i want to avoid reminding (nagging) all the time....  <br/>
cant decide if that is just the way it is especially in these &quot;middle years&quot; <br/>
(7-?)<br/>

I notice this too, especially around my house as I am the only female.  It is <br/>
my opinion that boys should clean tolits becasue they are the ones that pee <br/>
on them!  And cutting the grasss is so irregular around here, I dont really <br/>
count it as a chore.  It is amazing how that sex stereotype stuff sticks with <br/>
you-- <br/>
