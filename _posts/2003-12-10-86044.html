corner&quot; of the bedroom, surrounded by his bikes and parts, polishing and <br/>
tinkering.. I can just see Gollum sitting there, flitting his eyes around nervously, <br/>
stroking that bike like a lover.. LMAO.. .. OMG, he just brought in two <br/>
wheels..  <br/>

bikes are too expensive to be on the porch or in the unlocked shed, so I <br/>
get them in the living room . . . sigh.<br/>

a car.<br/>
My bike is my freedom to roam. I loathe driving (and now don&#39;t have a<br/>
car anyway) and walking is hard because of MS. My bike means I can<br/>
head for the supermarket on a Saturday - its 8 miles - and have a few<br/>
hours of alone time and explore the area too. I always end up with<br/>
about 50 pounds of groceries strapped to the rear rack so I&#39;m not fast<br/>
on the way back. I stop for a chocolate cappacino. Everything I need<br/>
is on my bicycle. Bliss.<br/>
But next week it has to go on a ship so I&#39;ll be stuck with buses for 4<br/>
weeks until our stuff arrives :-(<br/>
And then it will be a couple of weeeks before the baby is due.<br/>
