&gt; it to be of importance?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SCA probably helps them be more aware, but there is real rank.<br/>
&gt; Your CEO gave you access.  You couldn&#39;t have taken it without his <br/>
&gt; cooperation.  It was his option, because he ranked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t invent it, I just see it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Being military, it&#39;s all around us. And it changes. Ben started as a lowly <br/>
lieutenant, who NATURALLY, without thinking, &quot;sir-ed&quot; his older NCO&#39;s. It&#39;s hard <br/>
as a Southerner to NOT &quot;sir&quot; older people. One of his NCO&#39;s approached him <br/>
and told him NOT to &quot;sir&quot; him----no matter that Ben was 22 and this man was 40! <br/>
It took some work, but Ben finally saw his rank and position and complied. <br/>
<br/>
In two more----well, not military---examples:<br/>
<br/>
As a dog show judge (in THAT tiny world), I &quot;out-rank&quot; the lowly exhibitors. &lt;<br/>
g&gt; But not those all-breed judges: they &quot;out-rank&quot; me. <br/>
<br/>
As conference coordinator---for one weekend---I&#39;ll be the &quot;ranking guy&quot;. But <br/>
I will defer to my illustrious speakers, who (I feel) out-rank me.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all around us. Maybe as a Southerner, I had it beaten into me! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I like the pope example!<br/>

conference? And you did anyway? Remember all the work you&#39;re doing?<br/>

WHo outranks whom?<br/>
