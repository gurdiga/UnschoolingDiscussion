<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481168022">I happened to join this list just as the beliefs thread got going.  I&#39;ve<br/>
been fighting the impulse to respond as Judie&#39;s beliefs as stated<br/>
clearly was emotionally upsetting to some members. But I was never any<br/>
good at sitting on my fingers when interesting and/or controversial<br/>
issues come up on lists :)  I have less than an hour before I have to<br/>
dash off to my part-time job, so we&#39;ll see if I can do this in so short<br/>
a time.  Ha!  My boss called half an hour before time to leave to say I<br/>
don&#39;t have to come in until 1.  I wish she had called before I got my<br/>
lunch ready to take in :)<br/>
<br/>
I am Holly Shaltz, just turned 45, fiberist &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hjsstudio.com">http://www.hjsstudio.com</a>&gt;,<br/>
farmer &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shaltzfarm.com">http://www.shaltzfarm.com</a>&gt;, mom to 3 kids (Chris, 24; Jon, 22,<br/>
and Bethany, 12 on Thursday), retired military spouse, about to<br/>
celebrate 25th wedding anniversary with husband Zack--more than a<br/>
miracle in military circles :).  Let&#39;s see--yes, former LLL leader, oh,<br/>
yeah, been unschooling/homeschooling for 13 1/2 years.<br/>
<br/>
The posts about Judie&#39;s beliefs interested me particularly because my<br/>
spiritual beliefs are somewhat similar.  Here&#39;s a synopsis, FWIW:<br/>
<br/>
We are all part of one spiritual, non-coporeal being or force or<br/>
whatever concept we can come up with using words.  You can call this<br/>
force God if you like, but in my view that&#39;s limiting and defining it. <br/>
I don&#39;t personally believe in God or any other form of deity.  All life<br/>
(some of which our human bodies don&#39;t recognize as life) is part of this<br/>
spiritual existence.  I call this Tao (not a deity, and Taoism is not a<br/>
religion), as Taoism is the closest human belief or philisophical system<br/>
that I know of to the concept I have.  &quot;The Tao that can be spoken of is<br/>
not true Tao&quot; indicates the limitations of human understanding and<br/>
expression when it comes to things beyond our physical existence very<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Being non-coporeal, before we enter into this physical life we don&#39;t<br/>
experience pain, fear, and suchlike things.  My (limited) experience of<br/>
feeling oneness with this spiritual existence suggests that our<br/>
non-coporeal existence does experience something I can best describe as<br/>
total acceptance, and which feels like what we humans call unconditional<br/>
love.  But other emotions are inevitably tied to humanity&#39;s physical<br/>
nature, and non-coporeal beings don&#39;t experience it.  There may be other<br/>
forms of physical life which experience things human&#39;s don&#39;t, as well,<br/>
and our spiritual selves choose to live in those bodies for a time,<br/>
too.  Animals or aliens, I don&#39;t know, nor does it matter :)<br/>
<br/>
A note on that total acceptance thing--as humans, we are constantly<br/>
searching for the acceptance we remember from before our birth into<br/>
physical life.  When we can recognize where the yearning came from, we<br/>
can live with it in a healthy (by our cultural standards) manner.  When<br/>
we don&#39;t recognize it, we will be searching for it from other, fallible,<br/>
humans forever, or from addictions--and usually failing, because our<br/>
physical natures inevitably appear to separate us.  My very posting<br/>
here, even my joining this list, is a sign of that yearning in me.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we spiritual beings choose to be born into physical<br/>
existence.  _The Reluctant Messiah_ by Richard Bach put that<br/>
beautifully, and other books by him develop the concept further.  He<br/>
writes that we choose an existence to experience physically for a time<br/>
just as we humans might choose a movie to watch.  If we want excitement<br/>
and adventure, or fear, or comedy, we choose different movies.  As<br/>
non-coporeal beings unable to experience emotions and other physical<br/>
conditions, we choose physical life in order to experience those<br/>
conditions.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe with Judy that we work out every detail before we are<br/>
born.  That would be too boring for me :)  However, maybe some people<br/>
do.  Personally, I think we choose the broad outlines of our lives, and<br/>
leave the rest to happen as it may.  So I chose a stable but sometimes<br/>
frustrating marriage, to deal with issues of not feeling worthy, to<br/>
experience various losses, to never have enough money for the things I&#39;d<br/>
like to have, etc.  Then it&#39;s up to me to do what I like with those<br/>
experiences, while I&#39;m wearing this human form.<br/>
<br/>
Others might choose to be born as a severely handicapped child, or a<br/>
refugee from war, or a politician &lt;g&gt; in order to experience the<br/>
benefits and limitations of each of those physical forms.<br/>
<br/>
So things we, as human beings, label &#39;bad&#39; or &#39;negative&#39; or &#39;evil&#39;<br/>
happen because we, as spiritual beings, chose lives that allow those<br/>
things to happen, knowing (as spiritual beings) that they are no more<br/>
real than a movie is real.<br/>
<br/>
However, being human in (making some assuptions here for the sake of<br/>
discussion) 21st C North American/Western cultures, we are brought up in<br/>
a culture which emphasizes compassion, responsibility for our own and<br/>
sometimes others&#39; actions, etc.  If that hypothetical abused wife or<br/>
rape victim showed up at my door, or Judie&#39;s door, I&#39;m sure I, and she,<br/>
would take that person in, call 911, etc.  I know I would, anyway :)  As<br/>
a spiritual being, I know that ultimately the &#39;bad&#39; things are not real;<br/>
as a physical being, I know that they hurt here and now, and I would<br/>
like to relieve my own and others&#39; pain where I can do so responsibly.<br/>
<br/>
Would I allow a child molester baby-sit my kids?  No, of course not,<br/>
because it&#39;s not consistent with my values as a human being.  But I can<br/>
see that the child molester is a tortured human being, who in turn is a<br/>
&#39;soul&#39; for want of a better word who chose to live a pain-filled<br/>
physical life for the experience of it, just as some people go to see<br/>
the &quot;Halloween&quot; movies, which I abhor.  I can feel for both the molester<br/>
and his/her victims here and now, while knowing that ultimately it&#39;s all<br/>
part of the movie, not part of the ultimate reality.<br/>
<br/>
Whether these beliefs are similar enough to Judie&#39;s that she would agree<br/>
with them I don&#39;t know.  I have personally struggled with the<br/>
implications Sandra read into Judie&#39;s statments--and again, it&#39;s<br/>
something Richard Bach has written about in his books.  It would be<br/>
logically justifiable, based on my belief system, to assume that<br/>
everyone on earth is in pain, or victimized, or what-have-you because<br/>
they chose that life, and no one need feel compassion or take action<br/>
based on that negative experience.  However, I am an actor in this<br/>
culture/timeframe.  I chose to have an upbringing which provides my<br/>
physical self with certain values which tend toward ignoring<br/>
spirituality in terms of favoring physical life for a time.  Those<br/>
values tend my physical actions in favor of helping those I can help in<br/>
an emotionally positive (by our culture&#39;s standards) way.<br/>
<br/>
It is also logically justifiable that anyone agreeing with my beliefs<br/>
could decide to go on a murderous rampage and there would be no negative<br/>
consequences for the rampager (other than likely ending his/her life in<br/>
prison, or shot by police, or executed--all part of the movie, so it<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter :)  I don&#39;t choose to act with that degree of freedom,<br/>
because I am influenced by the values my physical self has<br/>
learned--including that, for me, the consequence of being executed as a<br/>
way of exiting this physical existence is not as pleasant as the exit of<br/>
dying in bed surrounded by loved ones :)<br/>
<br/>
Having said all that &lt;phew!&gt; I bow out, knowing that none of what I have<br/>
written is important to anyone :)  I take myself with a large grain of<br/>
salt.  Ultimately, all beliefs are simply aspects of our physical lives,<br/>
and will be discarded when we exit this life.  IOW, &#39;tain&#39;t important<br/>
enough to get hot about now or ever.<br/>
<br/>
It shall be interesting to see the reaction (if any :) to this post,<br/>
though.  My first impression is one of the list&#39;s atmosphere being<br/>
somewhat judgemental--at least when one particular button is pushed. <br/>
Alas, my physical self includes having been raised by an extremely<br/>
critical, judgemental, angry mother and an emotionally unavailable<br/>
father, so I&#39;m rather sensitive to judgement.  Something that my<br/>
physical being has worked to resolve, with limited success, while my<br/>
spiritual self is probably laughing that I can&#39;t quite see past that<br/>
particular illusion :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506084432">Welcome Holly,<br/>
<br/>
Your post was beautifully written, and yet another moment of synchronicity <br/>
occured for me, just this morning. I unloaded my car from the weekend and my <br/>
sister had put 2 boxes of books she was done with in my car. I hadn&#39;t gone <br/>
through them when I left, just told her to throw the boxes in so I could head out. <br/>
My sister had reassured me that some of my books, that I had shared with her, <br/>
including my John Holt&#39;s, were in the boxes. I laughed a little when I took the <br/>
second box out this morning, and right on the top row, sat &quot;Illisions, the <br/>
Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah&quot; by Richard Bach (of course it sat next to a <br/>
book she has been begging me to read titled, &quot;A Case for Christ&quot;). I kind of <br/>
smiled at the sky and gave a little wink. I really don&#39;t know if I planned to <br/>
share that his writings in this book are very similar to my beliefs, but it is <br/>
one of those books that I like to read when I&#39;m feeling far to bogged down with <br/>
earthiness ;-).<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for sharing it, I guess I needed a shove! Again welcome to the list.<br/>

Me too :)  My beliefs are more clear in my heart than my head.  I can<br/>
get caught up in the daily grind and forget that &#39;reality&#39; isn&#39;t<br/>
REALITY.  Illusions is the best quick read I know of to remind me of<br/>
where I am and why I&#39;m here.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the welcome,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL - although most of the ideas don&#39;t appeal to me, I do LIKE the <br/>
overall attitude expressed in that post, a LOT. When people can say, &quot;I <br/>
take myself with a large grain of salt,&quot; I think that&#39;s a way of saying <br/>
that they aren&#39;t so darn certain that they are &quot;right&quot; and everybody <br/>
else &quot;wrong&quot; and that they would be able to handle it if people <br/>
questioned their reasons for their beliefs and be comfortable with the <br/>
idea that others might even think their beliefs were illogical or worse.<br/>
<br/>
If I was going to post about my own personal graspings at a kind of <br/>
spiritual belief system, I&#39;d say the same thing.  I don&#39;t have any <br/>
interest in discussing it, though, so I am not posting about it. That <br/>
IS what the list is for - people bring up things they WANT to have <br/>
analyzed, things they want people to think about and question and <br/>
critically examine and give alternative ideas about. Right now, in my <br/>
life, I&#39;m more interested in the here-and-now level - not in discussing <br/>
before or after-lives.<br/>
<br/>
I do understand holding two ideas that seem to be at odds with each <br/>
other. That&#39;s what Holly seems to me to be describing.  I think we do <br/>
that quite often - it seems to be in our nature. I can say I don&#39;t like <br/>
to travel, but then describe having a wonderful time on a particular <br/>
trip, for example.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m interested in how we choose to behave in this life - how we treat <br/>
our children, how we decide to live our lives. When somebody says that <br/>
we decided already - we&#39;re not choosing now - it leaves us with nothing <br/>
much to talk about - our Venn diagram has no intersection if that <br/>
person believes we are all simply acting out a prewritten script - a <br/>
script we all helped write and fully agree upon in advance.<br/>
<br/>
If someone says, on the other hand, that we chose this KIND of life, <br/>
but we chose it in order to have to MAKE all the decisions that this <br/>
kind of life involves, that leaves us with our whole world of choices <br/>
to still talk about, whether we agree on how we got here or not.<br/>
