<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668456650">&lt;&lt;Funny I was just telling ds I was getting jealous of all the time he&#39;s<br/>
spent out and about with his friends this summer. I too am looking<br/>
forward<br/>
to even more solitude with my boys when the cold sets in. Anyone have a<br/>
favorite crockpot recipe? I need a few for snowboard season. Or things<br/>
your<br/>
kids like to make to eat? Ds loves to cook. :-)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The best thing about all of this is that my dd has been looking forward<br/>
to being at home too.  During the summer I began to wonder if being home<br/>
was much fun for her.  I hadn&#39;t said a thing but during the first bout of<br/>
cold and rain (short lived) she expressed how excited she was to get back<br/>
to the same activities I was looking forward to.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;    Kris I&#39;m so glad you popped out of lurkdom. &lt;BWEG&gt; Do you know if<br/>
Marci&#39;s still on CCU? I&#39;ve lost her addy. :-(<br/>

I have to admit I&#39;ve been &quot;away&quot; much of the time this summer.  I need to<br/>
get back in touch with who and where everyone is.  My &quot;good&quot; computer<br/>
died on me and I&#39;ve been downsized to my old &quot;dinosaur&quot; for email, I have<br/>
no internet access right now.  It has been good though, the house is<br/>
cleaner and more organized than it has been in years.  *grin*  However,<br/>
as soon as I can take a look at the list composition I will let you know<br/>
about Marci.<br/>
