 </span></blockquote>  hello everyone!<br/>
        i&#39;m WAY behind in my email reading but saw the Mary&#39;s subject <br/>
line of LEGO&#39;s and thought i&#39;d share a couple tidbits of info.  first <br/>
off, i have seen several sites on the internet belonging to some very <br/>
serious lego enthusiasts and guess what...  they are mostly adults! <br/>
the creations they are showing off are AWESOME!!  huge castles, <br/>
cities, and generally incredible creations.  it is obvious that a lot <br/>
of creative thought, hard work, and mechanical engineering went into <br/>
these works of art.   i probably have some of these on my browser&#39;s <br/>
bookmarks list. if anyone is interested, i will see what i have.<br/>
<br/>
and for anyone that might doubt the educational value of Lego&#39;s <br/>
let&#39;s not forget Lego&#39;s entire line of robotics which i would guess <br/>
is very educational.  i haven&#39;t experienced these first hand yet <br/>
though.  <br/>
<br/>
i&#39;d also like to share that i was surprised to see an entire Lego <br/>
division at the state fair this year.  i wished i had known about it <br/>
because i certainly would have encouraged Sterling to build something <br/>
to enter.  i think the youngest entrant i saw was 4yo. <br/>
<br/>
on the same lines....<br/>
<br/>
On October 2nd WalMart is <br/>
sponsoring a Jedi Lightsaber Building Contest.  Kids have one minute <br/>
to build the Ultimate Lightsaber.  Lego bricks will be supplied by <br/>
WalMart.  Three Winners (from 3 age categories) in each store will <br/>
receive a Lego Star Wars prize Pack including:  #7101 Lightsaber <br/>
Duel, exclusive Lego Star Wars poster, exclusive Lego Star Wars <br/>
stickers, Star Wars &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; CD from Sony Classical.  <br/>
Plus, everyone who participates wins an official Lego Star Wars <br/>
certificate of achievement.   <br/>
<br/>
This info was in Sterling&#39;s new issue of LegoMania Magazine he just<br/>
received yesterday.  I would imagine the info is on <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lego.com">http://www.lego.com</a> also.  i have not had a chance to go look if <br/>
there is any additional detail there.  i&#39;m wondering what the age <br/>
categories will be so i&#39;m sure i&#39;ll be visiting their site sometime <br/>
in the near future.  <br/>
<br/>
Sterling has always been a Lego kid and recently graduated to the <br/>
smallest size Lego&#39;s.  In addition to encouraging creative and <br/>
critical thinking skills, mechanical engineering skills, <br/>
concentration, and i&#39;m sure some others i&#39;m not thinking of at the <br/>
moment, they also help develop the fine motor skills in younger <br/>
children.<br/>
