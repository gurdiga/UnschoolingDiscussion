<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728667364">The local high school pulls it off with a program called Equis.  The<br/>
science, math, history and English classes are team taught and integrated.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I was lucky as I am both a book and math person and although I was<br/>
never a science person I still got a lot of info from science classes and<br/>
never a feeling of not getting the complete picture.  And, even though I was<br/>
generally bored to death in school, most of my negative experiences came<br/>
from students, not teachers.  Well, other than I found most of them to be,<br/>
shall we say, limited in their abilities &lt;g&gt;  But by then I had &quot;found&quot; the<br/>
library and the librarians were always more than happy to help with my<br/>
questions and never seemed to be put off by a bunch of questions.<br/>
<br/>
However, the only time I got the &quot;smart ass&quot; routine was in the 4th grade<br/>
and they moved me into a 4, 5 and 6 class.  That got rid of the boredom for<br/>
that year but of course that left me with no where to go in the 5th grade.<br/>
<br/>
When I got to high school I finally got some really good teachers who could<br/>
bring their subjects to life.  Our chemistry teacher had been in special<br/>
forces or CIA or some such thing and he was the original two left feet,<br/>
nutty professor so his class was always &quot;interesting,&quot; and we all lived to<br/>
tell about it &lt;g&gt;  We had a geometry teacher who was an ex-Marine drill<br/>
sargent who was interesting too.  And an algebra teacher that was wayyyyyyy<br/>
ahead of his time (this was about &#39;61) and turned the class into a computer<br/>
and because of the way he taught, everyone &quot;got it,&quot; even the kids that came<br/>
into the class math phobic or failing math.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I loved English until Ms. Peabody (yes, that was her real name) who<br/>
could turn an honors English major into a 1.0 gpa in no time flat!  I only<br/>
have two memories of her class, one, I hated it and two, the day she asked<br/>
me where Timbucto was.<br/>
<br/>
So, the warm fuzzies really have to do with how good the teacher is, IMHO,<br/>
not what your favorite subjects are.<br/>
<br/>
As to book burning, if you were/are a public figure who says Ezzo&#39;s book<br/>
should be burned, then I&#39;d have to say you get to be in the same column as<br/>
the guy in Texas.<br/>
<br/>
Ya see, the way I see it, if everyone gets to decide what books to gather<br/>
up, remove from public consumption and burn, then their won&#39;t be any books<br/>
at all.  I&#39;d much prefer to see open dialogue, information exchanged and an<br/>
alternative looked for.<br/>
<br/>
I personally would like to see Ezzo burned but I&#39;m not going to get on some<br/>
committee and make that recommendation &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; I do think that science should be taught as science and not from a<br/>
political<br/>
&gt; &gt; or economic standpoint.  Politics and economics are variables, science<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt; not.  Acid rain is acid rain and what causes it causes it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I meant to reply to this but ended up covering it in my previous post. I<br/>
&gt; think kids would get a bigger picture if nothing were learned in<br/>
isolation.<br/>
&gt; I also think it&#39;s a rare school that can pull that off as a general<br/>
policy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And, I wasn&#39;t interested in the book, per se, but in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the book burning statement.  I find that folks that think any book that<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t teach a particular view should then be burned are a bit on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; nutcake side.  If they start with this book, what book is next?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And yet, if I found myself in the possession of an Ezzo or Fulgate book<br/>
I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; be tempted to -- and might actually -- drop it in the trash rather than<br/>
let<br/>
&gt; it fall into the hands of some poor innocent at the library book sale.<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; had serious thoughts about other books I&#39;ve donated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And if I could get my hands on all the Ezzo and Fulgate books, I might be<br/>
&gt; sorely tempted!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So if I can feel justified about destroying a book I find personally<br/>
&gt; repugnant, does that make me a nutcase too? If you agree with my reasoning<br/>
&gt; for doing it to a particular book, does that make it okay?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think people burn books because a book doesn&#39;t teach what they<br/>
&gt; believe. (Though some probably do.) I think it&#39;s because the book teaches<br/>
&gt; something they think is bad. It&#39;s a subtle but important difference that<br/>
&gt; helps us gain insight into the way people we disagree with think. In other<br/>
&gt; words they think the same was we do, just from a different point of view.<br/>
