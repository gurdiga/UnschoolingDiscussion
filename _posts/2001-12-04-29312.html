  Eldest son was that way.  Like a long dry spell without reading anything<br/>
  that didn&#39;t, I guess you could say, give him something &quot;useful&quot; in return<br/>
  for his reading.  Then at about 20 he became a reading nut just like mom &lt;g&gt;<br/>
  Now, if he isn&#39;t reading, he is listening to books on tape.<br/>

  &gt; &gt;IMO, it&#39;s good enough that he&#39;s reading manuals and that sort of thing.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;Oldest dd is also that way.. only wants to read for information but not<br/>
  &gt; &gt;for pleasure. Her loss, yes, but she&#39;ll still be able to get along as an<br/>
  &gt; &gt;adult with these skills and that&#39;s all I care about with regard to<br/>
  &gt; &gt;reading. Seems your son is the same...<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I think so.  The thing I just don&#39;t *get* though, is how he could go from<br/>
  &gt; absolutely loving to have fiction read to him, to not wanting to read it<br/>
  &gt; and rarely wanting it read to him.  I can understand not wanting to be<br/>
  read<br/>
  &gt; to at age 14, though I still enjoyed it sometimes at that age as a family<br/>
  &gt; reading time.  But to not want to try to read the fiction he&#39;s always<br/>
  &gt; loved.....?  I guess it&#39;s still too hard for him to read fast enough to<br/>
  &gt; enjoy it.  When he&#39;s reading non-fiction, he&#39;s reading for specific info<br/>
  &gt; that he wants.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062398632">Geez Louise, now you want me to think &lt;g&gt;  Eldest bio is 31, followed by 29,<br/>
21 (8 years and 8 days diff between these two.  The 21 yo being my &#39;tubal<br/>
ligation&#39; baby), 17 (18 in two weeks), 13 (14 in 2 days) and 9.  Then there<br/>
are the foster kidlets.  Those still living (we lost one daughter at 16 in a<br/>
freak car accident and another 4 years ago at age 41 to the side effects of<br/>
Prozac) are 18, 18, 16 and just turned 16 last Friday.  The nieces and<br/>
nephews we raised are now 44, 42, 41, 40 and 35.   The &quot;walking wounded&quot;<br/>
that we have &quot;adopted&quot; over the years now number 27 and  range in age from<br/>
45 to 20.<br/>
<br/>
Ya know what, I never stopped and counted before.  I think I&#39;m tired &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099722645">Eldest son is a &quot;rescuer.&quot;  Son #3 is a rescuer.  Our foster daughter who<br/>
died at 40 was a &quot;rescuer.&quot;  The nieces and nephews are scattered all over<br/>
the U.S. (one works one of those fishing boats in Alaska, I don&#39;t know if<br/>
that makes her brave or crazy &lt;g&gt;).  I don&#39;t have that much contact with<br/>
them.  I get cards from all over the place and a lot of them have gotten<br/>
into occupations that are rescue/help oriented.  One became a lawyer who<br/>
only does indigent cases.<br/>
<br/>
Again, you are making me think and count.  I know several are in the<br/>
nursing/social services (NOT CPS type) fields.  Another is an elders<br/>
advocate.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say I&#39;m batting at 500.<br/>
<br/>
However, I was quite saddened by one of the boys we &quot;rescued.&quot;  He said that<br/>
he is never going to have children because he is afraid he will be like his<br/>
mother.  I said to him but you know the difference, wouldn&#39;t that make you a<br/>
better parent.  He said &quot;I don&#39;t think I can be like you, I think I have too<br/>
much of her still in me.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712983241">Oh, it could be but it was so sad that a 16 yo would think that.  He is such<br/>
a bright child but contrary to all the bs that the ps&#39;s shove out, he has no<br/>
social skills at all.  So much for the socialization issue!  He&#39;s only been<br/>
with us a little over a year now but he can now hold a conversation without<br/>
having to put everyone else down as a way to pump himself up.  When he first<br/>
came to live with us we had lots of conversations about all the marvelous<br/>
points he has but he didn&#39;t believe us.  Baby steps but at least we are no<br/>
longer doing two steps backward for every one forward!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372893803">I used to say this about myself. I didnt think it was genetic, but I was<br/>
afraid that I had been too damaged to be able to be a good mother.<br/>
<br/>
It helped to wait (Im 35  was 33 when our son was born); to get a lot of<br/>
experience with kids in various situations; and to read a lot about child<br/>
abuse and alternative ways of looking at things like obedience. I do<br/>
struggle at times, but it hasnt been the disaster I feared. As long as your<br/>
son is relatively young, I wouldnt worry about it too much  he might<br/>
change his mind. It would be a pity if someone who actually remembers what<br/>
it was like to be abused still felt permanently powerless to stop the cycle<br/>
of violence.<br/>
<br/>
Good books for him, if hes interested: Alice Millers For Your Own Good,<br/>

&gt; I used to say this about myself. I didn&#39;t think it was genetic, but I was<br/>
&gt; afraid that I had been too damaged to be able to be a good mother.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It helped to wait (I&#39;m 35 - was 33 when our son was born); to get a lot of<br/>
&gt; experience with kids in various situations; and to read a lot about child<br/>
&gt; abuse and alternative ways of looking at things like &quot;obedience&quot;. I do<br/>
&gt; struggle at times, but it hasn&#39;t been the disaster I feared. As long as<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; son is relatively young, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it too much - he might<br/>
&gt; change his mind. It would be a pity if someone who actually remembers what<br/>
&gt; it was like to be abused still felt permanently powerless to stop the<br/>
cycle<br/>
&gt; of violence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good books for him, if he&#39;s interested: Alice Miller&#39;s For Your Own Good,<br/>
&gt; Torey Hayden&#39;s Murphy&#39;s Boy (or one of her other books, if he wants to<br/>

Lots of trash is out there in the name of psychology. Hope he doesnt get<br/>
turned off to psychology, much less reading in general, by what he happened<br/>
to find at the sale. Technical stuff with the statistics and the behavioral<br/>
modification jargon  blechhh!<br/>
<br/>
Heres a good title if hes interested in experimental psych: Stanley<br/>
Milgrams Obedience to Authority. Enough to give you the willies and make<br/>
you question just about everything.<br/>
<br/>
For any of the books I mentioned, let me know if he likes them and I can<br/>
recommend where to go from there  I know of others in each area. (If Im<br/>
not on the list by then, email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ElsaHaas@...">ElsaHaas@...</a><br/>
&lt;mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ElsaHaas@...">ElsaHaas@...</a>&gt; .)<br/>
<br/>
Sixteen is a fine age to renounce parenthood. He has plenty of time. It isn<br/>
t sad  its positive! So many kids with awful childhoods just fall right<br/>
back into the same pattern as parents, without even pausing to think much<br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
He needs to know that there are people out there who have questioned the<br/>
mainstream view of abuse as simply a somewhat excessively severe form of<br/>
normal parenting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-103672105">Well, he gets lots of hugs (something I don&#39;t think he ever had) which is<br/>
cute since I&#39;m 5&#39;2&quot; (o.k., so its 5&#39; 1 1/2&quot; &lt;g&gt;) and he is sprouting and is<br/>
passed 6&#39;2&quot; and still growing.  And youngest kidlet makes him hug her too<br/>
(she is a very petite 9 yo).  First time that happened the look on his face<br/>
was like &quot;wow, do people really do this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The book we picked out was recommended by  a professor.  I don&#39;t remember<br/>
what the name of it was but it is about misconceptions of what psychology is<br/>
all about and what terms actually mean vs. what the general public thinks<br/>
they mean.  Kind of a psychology &quot;un&quot; labeling book.  Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve saved your posted to his file and he says he is going to look through<br/>
them as soon as he finishes this book.  He&#39;s studying for his driver&#39;s<br/>
license, reading the psych book, reading Shakespeare, playing basketball,<br/>
got a job and has to make time to watch football on tv.  Very busy.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the recommendations and we&#39;ll keep your e-mail addy in our saved<br/>
file (not on the net thingy (too many worms and viruses) but in our PCF.<br/>

&gt; For any of the books I mentioned, let me know if he likes them and I can<br/>
&gt; recommend where to go from there - I know of others in each area. (If I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not on the list by then, email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ElsaHaas@...">ElsaHaas@...</a><br/>

&gt; Sixteen is a fine age to renounce parenthood. He has plenty of time. It<br/>
isn&#39;<br/>
&gt; t sad - it&#39;s positive! So many kids with awful childhoods just fall right<br/>
&gt; back into the same pattern as parents, without even pausing to think much<br/>
&gt; about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He needs to know that there are people out there who have questioned the<br/>
&gt; mainstream view of abuse as simply a somewhat excessively severe form of<br/>
&gt; &quot;normal&quot; parenting.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll let him know about those titles.  Right now he has decided to read<br/>
&gt; psychology (we went to the community college used book sale and he was<br/>
&gt; &quot;drawn&quot; to that section) and the complete works of Shakespeare.  IF he<br/>
ever<br/>
&gt; gets through those and they don&#39;t turn him off reading &lt;g&gt; maybe one of<br/>
&gt; these will interest him.  Thanks for the list.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I used to say this about myself. I didn&#39;t think it was genetic, but I<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt; afraid that I had been too damaged to be able to be a good mother.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It helped to wait (I&#39;m 35 - was 33 when our son was born); to get a lot<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; experience with kids in various situations; and to read a lot about<br/>
child<br/>
&gt; &gt; abuse and alternative ways of looking at things like &quot;obedience&quot;. I do<br/>
&gt; &gt; struggle at times, but it hasn&#39;t been the disaster I feared. As long as<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; son is relatively young, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it too much - he might<br/>
&gt; &gt; change his mind. It would be a pity if someone who actually remembers<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; &gt; it was like to be abused still felt permanently powerless to stop the<br/>
&gt; cycle<br/>
&gt; &gt; of violence.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Good books for him, if he&#39;s interested: Alice Miller&#39;s For Your Own<br/>
Good,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Torey Hayden&#39;s Murphy&#39;s Boy (or one of her other books, if he wants to<br/>
&gt; avoid<br/>
&gt; &gt; a couple of very graphic passages describing severe abuse), Rachel<br/>
&gt; Pinney&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bobby: Breakthrough Of An Autistic Child (not about abuse, but<br/>
containing<br/>
&gt; &gt; ideas about obedience / discipline / physical force / punishment /<br/>
reward<br/>
&gt; /<br/>
&gt; &gt; manipulation issues - I volunteered for her in London years ago and<br/>
&gt; learned<br/>
&gt; &gt; a lot), Virginia Axline&#39;s Dibs (about emotional abuse and play therapy).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, Granju&#39;s Attachment Parenting and Jean Liedloff&#39;s The Continuum<br/>
&gt; &gt; Concept (both helpful for rethinking what&#39;s really &quot;normal&quot; and for<br/>
&gt; avoiding<br/>
&gt; &gt; a lot of the power struggles and catch-22&#39;s parenting tends to put you<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; &gt; in this society).<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;I was quite saddened by one of the boys we &quot;rescued.&quot;  He said that<br/>
&gt; &gt; he is never going to have children because he is afraid he will be like<br/>
&gt; his<br/>
&gt; &gt; mother.  I said to him but you know the difference, wouldn&#39;t that make<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; better parent.  He said &quot;I don&#39;t think I can be like you, I think I have<br/>
&gt; too<br/>
&gt; &gt; much of her still in me.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, maybe you shouldn&#39;t be sad about that. Perhaps he knows himself<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; knows that it&#39;s in the genes (question: is it??? could it be???)<br/>

The book we picked out was recommended by  a professor.  I don&#39;t remember<br/>
what the name of it was but it is about misconceptions of what psychology is<br/>
all about and what terms actually mean vs. what the general public thinks<br/>
they mean.  Kind of a psychology &quot;un&quot; labeling book.  Does that make sense?<br/>
