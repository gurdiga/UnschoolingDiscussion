<br/>
Don&#39;t let them send you out of the room. Be right there holding his hand <br/>
or whatever you can do to have physical contact.<br/>
<br/>
Be as calm and reassuring as possible. Don&#39;t fall apart, yourself, but <br/>
acknowledge how he&#39;s feeling. Show confidence that he can get through <br/>
it. Be honest about things that will hurt or be uncomfortable, but don&#39;t <br/>
be dramatic, just matter-of-fact and sympathetic without adding to his <br/>
fear. Also be sure to say how long it will last, especially if it won&#39;t <br/>
be long.<br/>

I think what happens in these types of situations is that mom wants to  <br/>
do what&#39;s best for the child so is letting a better tool than herself  <br/>
do the fixing. But from the child&#39;s point of view, mom has switched  <br/>

seems like the child is refusing to be reasonable and trusting. So  <br/>
force seems necessary.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you for responding. <br/>
Your words are so helpful.<br/>
Logan has always seen me and his dad being on his side.<br/>
I do not want him to feel betrayed.<br/>
He is a really amazing kid who is strong enough to tell the doctors and nurses &quot;no&quot; when he doesn&#39;t like something. I admire him. I was so much more pliable as a child.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been questioning every treatment, test, and protocal and refusing things that I disagree with.<br/>
<br/>
he has an eye infection, the concern is that it is close to the brain and could spread there. He is on IV antibiotics. He&#39;s feeling so upset that he won&#39;t let the nurses touch him to put the meds in. They need to look in his eye and he refuses.<br/>
He Says he doesn&#39;t want get better, just go home.<br/>
They have asked me to hold him down so they could fix his IV, is it better that I do it lovingly, or does he see that as me being on the doctors side against him?<br/>
<br/>
He does not trust the doctors and nurses at all at this point, i dont blame him. We will be here for a few more days. My happy kid is now constantly agitated and crying.<br/>
We are stuck in a place where people talk to him differently than my husband and I.<br/>
Lots of &quot;good jobs&quot;, and &quot;your so brave&quot;, when he&#39;s obviously not feeling brave, just scared.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do I do when they want me to help hold him down?<br/>
It all feels so wrong, but he needs the meds.<br/>

I would have held him down, but been as comforting as I could afterwards.  There are things people need to have done sometimes.  I wasn&#39;t crazy about having my leg splinted when I broke it in the mountains, and people held my hands and distracted the top of me while people were hurting my leg, but not at all for meanness.<br/>

There are circumstances in which it&#39;s better for the mom to help get a procedure over with, lest they put her out of the room and do it without her.  That can happen.  It has.  They can call social workers.   Moms don&#39;t always get to tell groups of professionals that her child might be ready in twenty minutes or an hour.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-493567495">A couple of different things about advocating for your child through this process:<br/>
<br/>
Doctors tend to talk to parents as if children aren&#39;t in the room or can&#39;t speak for themselves. Depending on your child, that may be fine with him or make him feel helpless and/or angry and left out.<br/>
<br/>
They also sometimes seem physically unaware of a young patient&#39;s presence. When my daughter (2 1/2 at the time) was injured and being prepped for surgery, the surgeon came out to talk to me, he leaned on the bed rail right over her face and proceeded to gesture with his hands. She flinched. I had to point it out to him. It was as if he wasn&#39;t even aware she was in the bed. We had similar experiences with nurses and ER docs and x-ray techs. They would talk over her or with their backs to her or other things they would (should) never do to an adult patient.<br/>
<br/>
And, if you are in a hospital where they want to bring a bunch of residents in for teaching purposes, it&#39;s your right to say NO!<br/>
<br/>
And take care of yourself, too. That is the biggest mistake I made during the 6 weeks of stressful bandage changes, etc. I didn&#39;t reach out and ask friends to make meals, etc. or get out and go for walks. I ended up snapping at my older kids, etc. because I was just emotionally spent.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!<br/>

My son also has autism (asperger&#39;s syndrome). Holding him down was part of what was necessary even though it hurt me emotionally to do so. It was medically necessary. The doctors and nurses want to give good care and want our kids to heal, but the pressure and stress from their jobs might make it seem like they are cold or uncaring. Be loving and stay calm no matter what, for your son. Seeing mom stay calm is very reassuring. Comfort afterward is also key. I have had to be my son&#39;s advocate in that I have to remind doctors of the autism diagnosis, but they are always understanding. Xan is not scared of doctors now at age 10.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428720240">I am a certified child life specialist. (not practicing right now... home<br/>
learning) CLSs help children and families cope with hospitalization and<br/>
medical issues. Emergency medical situations and urgent care needs do<br/>
challenge unschooling beliefs. This is an important discussion.<br/>
<br/>
You may ask if there is a child life specialist available. He or she can<br/>
help you to advocate, do medical play with your child, teach coping and<br/>
relaxation strategies to you and your child, and prepare your child for<br/>
invasive procedures. Even after a traumatic experience CL interventions can<br/>
help to process the experience and make future medical experiences less<br/>
daunting. You are the expert on your child, and a CLS will typically ask you<br/>
and your child lots of questions to help fit any plans to your child and<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
If the hospital does not have a child life department, you might find a CLS<br/>
in private practice, or you could call the nearest children&#39;s hospital and<br/>
ask for a child life consult if there are issues left-over for your child<br/>
once you are home. (distress during eyedrops, anxiety about follow-up<br/>
visits...)<br/>
<br/>
Years ago, when I was working in the field, we would recommend that<br/>
parents (and CLSs) decline to be the ones to restrain a child for a<br/>
procedure, and that they keep their role to providing comfort and calm for<br/>
the child. Now, there are guidelines for &quot;positions of comfort&quot; which<br/>
include ways for parents (or others) to hold a child for optimum comfort,<br/>
while gently restraining at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Here are 2 links which explain and give examples of comfort positioning.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seconding this. I was the primary caregiver to 2 dying family members in the last few years, and learned a lot about hospitals. Everyone--the patient, family, and staff--is best off if the family assumes that people working there are good people who are overburdened. Things get misplaced, people get distracted on their way to get something, miscommunication happens, and it is just because there are humans involved. Pleasantly follow up on everything. Don&#39;t take things personally, and don&#39;t try to be nice by waiting or watching silently if something seems off. It seems like you are highly involved. Just remember that stress is unhealthy and impedes healing, so keeping your advocacy as nonconfrontational as possible will help your son. I wish I had learned this before stressing out a lot of sick people. I know it&#39;s so easy to go all Mama Bear about your family, but you&#39;ll probably get checked on more often if you can stay pleasant enough that people don&#39;t dread visiting your room. <br/>

=== &gt;The doctors and nurses want to give good care and want our kids to heal, but the pressure and stress from their jobs might make it seem like they are cold or uncaring. <br/>

&gt; Seconding this. I was the primary caregiver to 2 dying family members in the last few years, and learned a lot about hospitals. Everyone--the patient, family, and staff--is best off if the family assumes that people working there are good people who are overburdened. ==== </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-344527165">Yes, I remember how appreciative the nurses at the station were when I  <br/>
took in a 3 dozen homemade cookies to thank them for their excellent  <br/>
care. It was a simple thing for me to do.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that the patients enjoyed their resulting care &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90770939">This post is older, but I just read it.  As a pediatruc nurse I&#39;m just thinking that you may have felt awful, and your child may have temporarily felt that you had switched sides, but think how much worse it would have been if someone else had held him?  <br/>
<br/>
Swaddling even older kids and having a parent hold seems to work well and calms kids and avoids anyone (parent or staff)from inadvertently squeezing an arm or leg too hard.<br/>
<br/>
HOpe all is better now.</div>
