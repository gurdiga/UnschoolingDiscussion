<div id="ygrps-yiv-239925312">Dh says to his parents, &quot;We&#39;ve decided to homeschool our youngest.&quot;<br/>
(She&#39;s 5, has 2 older siblings, 7 & 16, who don&#39;t want to homeschool.)<br/>
  His mom says to my dd, (my mil is one to talk thru the kids instead<br/>
of to us) &quot;Well, I guess Daddy will have to get a second job.&quot;<br/>
  Dh asks, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; (I am a stay-at-home Mom.)<br/>
  She says, &quot;Well, you&#39;ll need the money to pay for the tutors.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
  huh? <br/>
  I imagine this may be the first of many dumb things I will hear.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe she has a point.  Do you think he should pay you<br/>
for being your young&#39;un&#39;s &#39;tutor&#39;?  ;)  (with tongue<br/>
firmly in cheek)<br/>

PS:  I think your MIL is a member of the same club as<br/>
my mother :)  I&#39;m almost to the point where I consider<br/>
it free entertainment rather than taking it as<br/>
personally as it is intended.<br/>
