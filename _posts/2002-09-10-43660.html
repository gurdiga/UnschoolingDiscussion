<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254531309">I doesn&#39;t bother me. For me, it&#39;s just another word. I get bothered when<br/>
<br/>
words of any kind are used to hurt though. So &quot;You&#39;re an idiot!&quot; would<br/>
bother me more than &quot;What the f**k?&quot; coming out of anyone&#39;s mouth. I<br/>
know<br/>
I&#39;m usually in a minority on this one. Lots of people get bothered by<br/>
the<br/>
words themselves.<br/>

I agree totally.  I was raised to believe that words are words and<br/>
that&#39;s it.  We attach meaning to them.  I don&#39;t appreciate name calling<br/>
or hurtful talking in our house, but swear words (shit, fuck, damn,<br/>
etc...) even the kids say these.  We have discussions about appropriate<br/>
times and places, but they know they are ok to use.  The result?  They<br/>
rarely use them, but when they do it is definitely in context.</div>
