<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243777763">When we received a new box of checks in the mail today, I was reminded of <br/>
something that happened a few years ago with my eldest, Colton.  We&#39;d gotten <br/>
a batch of checks from the bank that had been incorrectly imprinted.  We were <br/>
going to throw the checks away, but Colton asked if he could have a couple <br/>
packs and if I would show him how to fill them out.  I did, and for the next <br/>
few days I received checks from Colton written as payment for everything from <br/>
macaroni and cheese dinners to clean laundry.<br/>
<br/>
   One morning I woke up very early, long before anyone else was up.  I came <br/>
downstairs, made some tea, and settled on the sofa with a blanket to read.  <br/>
When I opened my book, a check fluttered to the floor.  It was made out to <br/>
me, in the amount of $22.00.  Written in the bottom left corner in the memo <br/>
section were two miraculous words: For love.<br/>
<br/>
   I still have the check and I will keep it forever.  But it&#39;s worth a lot <br/>
more to me than $22.00.  It&#39;s priceless.<br/>

I got some of the little toy checks by parentbanc that are very much <br/>
like real checks.{I had forgotton about them) I went and couldn&#39;t <br/>
find them on the web just now but parentbank does have a web site of <br/>
their own. (I think I think I got mine at etoys and they were on sale <br/>
really cheap}<br/>
Thanks for posting this. Maybe I&#39;ll scan a few and print them off for <br/>
thew kids to play with over and over and over...<br/>
This will take you to what they look like {but it may be cheeper to <br/>
get regualar checks if anyone is interested in this for their kids -<br/>
LOL}<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-449614063">That&#39;s sweet!.  My girls went through a phase of check writing.  At<br/>
first I gave them some checks from a bank we didn&#39;t use anymore.  Then I<br/>
photocopied our checks.  Then I found a place online to print checks and<br/>
I could add their name to them.  They were just for play and they really<br/>
enjoyed it.  I am sure a quick search would find something similar if<br/>
anyone was interested.<br/>

the bills. She enters it in the checkbook and stuffs the envelopes too. I <br/>
just supervise and sign them.<br/>

Good idea, I usally pay my bills online but I could always have them prewrite them when I go to get gas or something. :)<br/>
