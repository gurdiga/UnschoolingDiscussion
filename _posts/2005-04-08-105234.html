<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583083326">Hi my name is Elaina. I&#39;m 26 and have a 7 year old DD, 5 year old DS, <br/>
and 3 year old DD. This has been our first year homeschooling. I&#39;ve <br/>
noticed over the past few months that we follow a more unschool <br/>
approach. So I&#39;m looking more into just what the unschool philosphy <br/>
is, what works for different families and just how do you get over <br/>
your own self doubts. Right now we are with a charter school but I&#39;m <br/>
not sure if I want to use a charter school again next year. Mostly <br/>
since my DS likes to do the majority of his learning through watching <br/>
and talking about what he sees and the charter school makes you tuen <br/>
in worksheets as proof of schooling. My son would rather die than sit <br/>
still and do a worksheet. But then I come full circle back to my own <br/>
self doubts and think how can he learn if he isn&#39;t sitting down doing <br/>
any actual lessons. I look forward to hearing what everyone has to say.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-229074022">Hi Elaina and welcome!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an unschooler and we&#39;ve got quite a few on this list if you need to ask<br/>
questions. The only cures for those self doubts are to read and watch I<br/>
find. Read as much as you can, as many related books and personal<br/>
experiences a,d watch your son. Watch as he goes about his day and learns<br/>
from what is around him.<br/>
