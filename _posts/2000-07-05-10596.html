&gt;I saw a somewhere a lady wanted to be a writer, but was always afraid to<br/>
&gt;because she was not good at grammer.  When many, many years later, she<br/>
&gt;learned that she did not need to be good at grammer that is what editors were<br/>
&gt;for.  To be a writer, she just need to have something to say.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just some thoughts,<br/>
