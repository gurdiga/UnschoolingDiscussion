<div id="ygrps-yiv-71466050">I am wondering if anyone belongs to a list, or knows of one, that <br/>
would be appropriate for someone that is researching the simple <br/>
living lifestyle and working toward that goal.  I would love to find <br/>
a place to &quot;talk&quot; with people that are going through the same process <br/>

I would love to move closer to a simple lifestyle but I don&#39;t have <br/>
things set up that way in my life yet.  At least right now, though, <br/>
I&#39;m an expert at frugal living.  I know frugal is not always simple <br/>
living because simple can mean living with less (which may or may not <br/>
be simple--gardening is definately not simple), or it can just mean a <br/>
simpler, more organized life (which can mean living with more <br/>
expensive products to keep your life simple--think, Simple Living <br/>
Magazine).  Gardening and cooking from scratch is not simple, but it <br/>
does use less resources.  This is opposed to having your grocery <br/>
store deliver and ordering out, which uses more resources but less of <br/>
your own time and energy.  I&#39;m assuming your definition of simple <br/>
living is the same one as mine and that you&#39;re looking to live with <br/>
less while using less resources.  Here is a list of my sites:<br/>
