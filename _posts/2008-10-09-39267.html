<div id="ygrps-yiv-570985500">Ok, been talking this over with fellow unschooling friends and I&#39;ve come to my own realization of what unschooling means to me:<br/>
<br/>
I think we shouldn&#39;t even be bothering with whether or not they are learning math, science, or any subjects.  (I know some of us have to keep track of such nonsense for the county--I know I do).   I used to think that they should be, just like schooled children.  But, now, I truly feel that is robbing them of their childhoods!  Children were given this amazing ability to play, to enter a dream-like state and be nourished by it.  Our society is so hell-bent on taking this away from them, truly.  So, allowing them to do what is natural--play! and explore!--is what unschooling means to me.  I am simply allowing my children to be children!<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents. :)<br/>

<br/>
If you think math and science are nonsense, unschooling isn&#39;t going  <br/>
to work very well.  If, on the other hand, you hadn&#39;t gotten past  <br/>
thinking of them as &quot;subjects&quot; instead of as the kinds of tools  <br/>
people need to be able to think and function, I can see your point.   <br/>
It&#39;s not quite the point you thought you were making, though, I don&#39;t  <br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, allowing them to do what is natural--play! and explore!--is  <br/>
what unschooling means to me. I am simply allowing my children to be  <br/>
children!-=-<br/>
<br/>
The word &quot;simply&quot; put the brakes on it for me.<br/>
Many people think that &quot;being children&quot; is what kids used to do after  <br/>
school in 1955 or something.  Their vision of &quot;being children&quot; might  <br/>
involve tadpoles and jump ropes.<br/>
<br/>
Being children in an unschooling context is going to quickly become  <br/>
being people in the real world.  The real world is made of things  <br/>
that are sometimes distilled into parts that are science, math,  <br/>
history, language, music, art, sports, theatre, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good start, to move toward playing and exploring, and away  <br/>
from subjects.  It&#39;s one of the first steps.   There are lots more!<br/>

This is why we unschool.  Charles, my dh, and I both think that <br/>
childhood is a precious and limited time.  We often find ourselves <br/>
using the phrase &quot;they&#39;re kids&quot; with other well intentioned adults <br/>
whose comments imply that children should be miniature adults with <br/>
responsiblilties.  <br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week I was talking to my mom about my daughter who doesn&#39;t <br/>
clean up the toys she gets out, but does very politely ask, &quot;Will you <br/>
please clean this up for me?  I am done playing with it now.&quot;  My mom <br/>
started, once again, to bring up the whole personal responibility <br/>
arguement.  I relplied with &quot;She&#39;s three!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If all goes well, they will have approximately 60 years to be adults, <br/>
and only roughly 20 years to be kids.  I have no intention of expanding <br/>
their adulthood into their childhood.<br/>

<br/>
Which is why there are so many adults who begrudge a child their childhoods<br/>
and press on them what was probably inappropriately pressed onto<br/>
themselves.... responsibility at too young an age, which rightfully and more<br/>
ably belongs to adults.  Children need the time to develop into the ability<br/>
to respond ably to situations that require decisions sometimes far beyond<br/>
the skills they have to make them.<br/>
<br/>
My sister was 4 when my parents charged her with the responsibility to look<br/>
out for me since I had been fitted with a hearing aid.  She couldn&#39;t<br/>
realistically do this but she took it very seriously and for the longest<br/>
time, that was our relationship.  She wasn&#39;t my sister so much as my<br/>
keeper.  Often what she really needed was that extra year&#39;s worth of ability<br/>
from me to help *her* with.<br/>
