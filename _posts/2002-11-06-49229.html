&lt;&lt; How can I get Mark to stop using the cloying teacher&#39;s voice when he&#39;s <br/>
explaining something to the children?  He just can&#39;t help himself.  Maybe <br/>
because both his parents were teachers?  I point it out and he tries to <br/>
change.  Will this get better over time?  Should I just let it slide?  It&#39;s <br/>
like nails on a chalk board for me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A tape recording?  If it&#39;s like nails on a chalkboard, maybe ask him to take <br/>
it all into another room for now, until he has more time to work on it.<br/>
<br/>
If his parents used that voice, it&#39;s going to be EXTRA hard for him to find <br/>
another one.  And since the kids didn&#39;t have school examples, it might not be <br/>
bothering them.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was talking to me yesterday about how she and her friend Jasmine had <br/>
been talking about how people had different tones of voice when they were <br/>
talking on to the phone to strangers, or maybe different when they talked to <br/>
adults than when they talked to kids.  So even for kids not in school, they <br/>
have and hear different voices.<br/>
<br/>
On another list, we had a WONDERFUL example of this.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve saved it as one of the shortest and most useful tools for this:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The little sing-songy tone of voice, the little musical &quot;Ooh, you&#39;re such a<br/>
&gt; GOOD girl!&quot; gags me.  I&#39;ve always called that talking like they&#39;re talking <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a French poodle.  It&#39;s horrible.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At a park day, we were having a discussion about the usefulness of praise<br/>
and sincerity.  The unschooler your<br/>
children as people first.  After much talk getting nowhere, one of the other<br/>
unschooling parents turned to me and in the French poodle voice started<br/>
thanking me for all the things I had done for the group that day. Something<br/>
like,&quot;Oh Dan, thank you for bringing the stove for hot cocoa. You did such a<br/>
good job setting it up and heating the water! You&#39;re so strong carrying that<br/>
big jug of water all by yourself!&quot;  Everyone had a good laugh and the point<br/>
was succinctly made.<br/>
