<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978190191">So, to move along, how do you guys unschool math? Thats a tough one for me, <br/>
as it doesn&#39;t seem to come up in my kids daily lives without my pushing it. <br/>
I found it very easy when the kids were young-I remember asking &quot;How many <br/>
plates would we need on the table if Aunt Christy were coming to dinner?&quot; <br/>
and everyone knew fractions pretty well just because we were doing good to <br/>
find one measuring cup when we made cookies.<br/>
<br/>
Now that they are older though, it is a little more unnerving to me. On one <br/>
hand I think that I didn&#39;t understand algebra after taking it, and it hasn&#39;t <br/>
hurt me, but on the other hand, will they be limited by not learning higher <br/>
math as children?<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>
