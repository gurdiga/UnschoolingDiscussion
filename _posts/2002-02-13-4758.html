<br/>
While I agree that AGORAPHOBIA could be a big problem, suggesting that kids<br/>
who are at home are severely limited could be seen as a road block to those<br/>
of us with a herd of temporarily small people.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the ages and temperaments of my kids currently, it is difficult to go<br/>
many places.  The 2 and 3 yo no longer want to be in the stroller and the<br/>
5yo has zero fear of any situation or stranger, having a tendency to<br/>
disappear from parental sight frequently.  Even a trip to the zoo right now<br/>
is a nightmare.  We would love to go out much more, right now we have to<br/>
wait until dh&#39;s days off.  I figure another 2 years and life will be much<br/>
more freewheeling.<br/>
<br/>
So we do stuff where we are.  We use the internet, the library, the<br/>
television to bring the world to us for now.<br/>
