<br/>
she sounds so adorable. I wish I was nine! lol<br/>
If you really don&#39;t want to perm her hair talk to her<br/>
about the chemicals.  Envirmental science it&#39;s enough<br/>
to scare anyone away from chemicals.  It did for me.<br/>
lol  Wish you luck it sounds like she want to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Rebecca,<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell us what your reasons are for not perming?<br/>
<br/>
I know that MY reasons would be the chemicals. After all, the skin soaks <br/>
in everything it comes in contact with and I&#39;m not so keen about that. We <br/>
don&#39;t even use shampoo with Sulpher Laurates (sp) (nitrates) in them.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, I know some of the health food stores carry vegetable dyes now.. <br/>
I&#39;ll make a point to find out about perms for you if thats your issue <br/>
also.<br/>
<br/>
One thing my mom used to say about lettting us do whatever with our hair, <br/>
is that it grows back.. so she didn&#39;t get bent outta shape about her 4 <br/>
daughters and their experiments.<br/>
<br/>
If she is interested in doing it herself, then maybe you can just let her <br/>
roll it and then she can see what it would look like, sans chemicals?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you can always go and get one of those heads with real hair <br/>
from the beauty store and let her practice.<br/>
<br/>
I think its great that she has such a focus.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145495932">Yes the chemical thing is my biggest issue, and I just do not want us to ruin her hair.  I have thought of the products sold as &quot;perm for a day&quot;.

I see them in chain drug stores.. thats a great idea!!! I think they are <br/>
only like 20bux so its not THAT bad on the budget either. Run it by her <br/>
and let us know how it all fared.<br/>

Please, please, please, discuss with her the ramifications if she <br/>
hates the way the perm takes.  Perms make me a solid head of frizz <br/>
because my hair is just not meant for perming.  If she is used to <br/>
having long hair and ends up having to get it cut because of a bad <br/>
perm, I think she should at least have known ahead of time that it is <br/>
a possibility.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265750441">Has anyone quit a good fulltime professional job in order to be a <br/>
stay-at-home unschooling mom?  I have two at home (13yo dd and 10yo <br/>

unschooling.  I work 32 hours a week and am married to a <br/>

job is very fulfilling in a lot of ways but I am longing to be home <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ll be glad of the time spent. Make it your &quot;job&quot; to have a great <br/>
time together within your financial ability - I mean, YOU be aware of <br/>
free and low-cost opportunities, trades you can make with other <br/>
homeschoolers, etc. I traded doing math activities with somebody else&#39;s <br/>
kids in return for her giving my kids violin lessons, for a while. <br/>
She&#39;s a superstar professional violinist who somehow manages to keep up <br/>
her career while homeschooling her two sons. What a deal -  I couldn&#39;t <br/>
have afforded her as a teacher even when I WAS working! There are a <br/>
thousand opportunities like that out there - make it your job to become <br/>
aware of and create them in ways that work for your children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This would probably mean giving up decent health insurance  and <br/>
&gt; defaulting on the kids&#39; prepaid tuition program for college.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those are not good deals - prepaid tuition programs. It means you&#39;re <br/>
deciding on your children&#39;s futures for them far too early. Saving for <br/>
yourselves is a lot better deal - then you can use the money for what <br/>
you want, when you want. Maybe they&#39;ll win full scholarships to <br/>
college. Maybe they won&#39;t GO to college.<br/>
<br/>
Check into group health insurance through groups you might belong to - <br/>
credit unions, for example. Again, make that your job to figure out a <br/>
way to have health insurance. Maybe a part-time job with fewer hours <br/>
that gives you an option to buy into a health insurance program. Do <br/>
some research.<br/>

born in order to collect a large amount of stock options that would <br/>
set us up very well. Didn&#39;t exactly work out the way I planned, to <br/>
say the least, but I ended up working for a little over 1.5 years. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I definitely think so. I strongly suggest that if/when you do it, you <br/>
give yourself lots of time to adjust. Even though I really wanted to <br/>
be home, it was still a big adjustment and I thought that I should be <br/>
instantly happy since I finally had what I wanted! Change can be <br/>
hard. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a book that I really like called _Miserly Moms_ <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.miserlymoms.com/)">http://www.miserlymoms.com/)</a>. The author talks about finding things <br/>
to cut that don&#39;t make you feel bad. Find that expensive brand of <br/>
whatever on sale, don&#39;t do without and make yourself a martyr. I have <br/>
a friend who quit her job very grudgingly and really made her family <br/>
unhappy by constantly talking about the things they had to give up. <br/>
Yuck. <br/>
<br/>
I bet your kids would have some good ideas on ways to cut expenses or <br/>
find ways to make some money...<br/>
