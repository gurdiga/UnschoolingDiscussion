Concerned about the parent&#39;s rights to do what exactly?  Parental rights<br/>
usually are thought to consist of raising the child as they see fit and<br/>
punishing the child as they see fit.  If punishment is taken out of the<br/>
equation, we are really talking about the rights of the individual to live<br/>
as they choose without undue interference from the government.  Couldn&#39;t<br/>
those individual rights be granted to children rather than parents....that<br/>
is if control of the child is not the core issue?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No. When I was a teenager, I lived in a house where I was punished <br/>
and had a lot of strict rules.  I often threatened to hurt myself in <br/>
a way that I would be bruised so that I could call the police and get <br/>
them in trouble.  I told them that I would lie and say they did it.  <br/>
I never went through with it, and now I am SO glad I didn&#39;t.  As <br/>
strict as my parents were, they were the parents God gave me and they <br/>
were the right parents for me.  That&#39;s not to say they couldn&#39;t have <br/>
done some things differently, but they also did a lot of things <br/>
right.  Had I done that, I probably would have been placed in foster <br/>
care and would have been emotionally scarred for life.  <br/>
<br/>
And as much as I don&#39;t agree with the way many parents raise their <br/>
kids, God placed those families there and they have the right to <br/>
raise them as they see fit, even if it means the kids get punished in <br/>
ways I don&#39;t approve of.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like spanking, but I will stick up for a parent&#39;s right to do <br/>
it.  I don&#39;t see it as abuse.  As a boy, my grandpa was taken out to <br/>
the barn to be punished with his father&#39;s belt.  His 9 brothers and <br/>
sisters were punished this way too.  Yes, I think it&#39;s terrible, but <br/>
he and all his brothers and sisters grew up to be healthy, productive <br/>
adults.  It wouldn&#39;t have been a good thing to take those kids away <br/>
from their parents because they feared their dad&#39;s belt.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as a child&#39;s total rights to do anything at all--hang out with <br/>
anyone or wear any kind of clothing at all--no.  I am very free with <br/>
what my kids can wear, but I would have my limits.   If, for example, <br/>
my kids wanted to hang out with satanists or wear satanic t-shirts, <br/>
they would be strictly forbidden.  I don&#39;t think they ever would, but <br/>
I reserve the right at any time to step in and say, &quot;You&#39;ve crossed <br/>
the line, God gave you to me to raise, and I will someday have to <br/>
answer to Him for how I raise you. You may not go there, you may not <br/>
wear that, and you may not spend time with those people.&quot;  <br/>

any idea what kind of crap people do to their kids out there? Is it okay<br/>
for parents to make their kids drink piss because they forgot to flush<br/>
the toilet? How about beating them bloody for not brushing their hair<br/>
right and then locking them in a hot, stuffy attic room for 3 days with<br/>
no bathroom and no food? Is that really all okay with God? If he<br/>
intentionally places kids with those parents then he&#39;s one sick bastard.<br/>

withholds food for 3 days, you&#39;re going to have a hard time finding <br/>
anyone who says that the parents shouldn&#39;t be prosecuted.  <br/>
<br/>
I was talking more about parents who yell at their kids and withhold <br/>
privelages for things that I think are trivial.  Or parents who spank <br/>
their children in controlled ways.  I know many, many parents who <br/>
discipline according to the recommendations of James Dobson.  I don&#39;t <br/>
agree with Dobson (I used to!) but I know plenty of parents who spank <br/>
and I don&#39;t know any of them whose children wouldn&#39;t be traumatized <br/>
if their children were removed from their parents.<br/>
<br/>
As far as how God places children, I believe that He matches the <br/>
correct child with the correct parents all the time, but that sin <br/>
often gets in the way and parents don&#39;t parent the way God intended <br/>
for them to. <br/>
