<div id="ygrps-yiv-114981659">I posted this to a couple of Canada groups, but got to thinking that <br/>
this group might have its fair share of Canadians, too.  Here&#39;s our <br/>
latest adventure in a nutshell:<br/>

Looks like we&#39;re just going to miss an outing at Dufferin Park on<br/>
the day we depart, but at least our daughter knows about the<br/>
farmer&#39;s market if she ever gets a Thursday afternoon off from<br/>
class! Any other hot spots like this, organic buying clubs (I&#39;m<br/>
having no luck getting information from the Ozark Co-op to get<br/>
connected with one in Florida,) or family-friendly restaurants for<br/>
the mainstream diners in our crowd while we&#39;re visiting Toronto?<br/>
<br/>
DH went ahead and reserved a couple of suites at the airport and<br/>
Mississauga; all the B&B&#39;s in the High Park area (where our daughter<br/>
will be staying) were full. They seemed to be more conveniently<br/>
located, but no more affordable than the hotels offering full<br/>
breakfast and a kitchenette. Still open to ideas. Thanks to those<br/>
who have offered some ideas for preparing for the trip offlist!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Belated Canada Day!<br/>
Penne & all US Ards, celebrating our independence with a little<br/>
liquid sunshine this weekend :oP<br/>

Glad to find you here!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re a family of veteran unschoolers hanging out in the Florida<br/>
sunshine for the duration. Our oldest daughter will be entering her<br/>
first-ever formal study program at the Academy of Realist Art(.com)<br/>
this August. We&#39;ll be tagging along behind her car on the way up to<br/>
Toronto so we can help her get settled in to her new digs. First<br/>
time away from home in her tender nineteen-going-on-twentieth year,<br/>
too! Okay *deep breath* I&#39;m ready to let go. Seriously, she&#39;s been<br/>
dreaming and planning this for the past year -- so we are very<br/>
excited that it&#39;s about to happen for her!<br/>
<br/>
So far, everything seems to be coming together -- Nike found a<br/>
lovely woman (French translator by profession) on Roommates.com<br/>
offering a large, sunny room in her home just six blocks or so from<br/>
the Academy (Bloor/High Park.) Her director checked it out and gave<br/>
the go-ahead, so she&#39;s got that covered. Now we&#39;re checking out the<br/>
options to affordably accommodate our crew of nine/ten during our<br/>
stay (four nights, July 31-August 4.) The kids range in age from 2<br/>
to 16 (excluding our oldest who won&#39;t be staying in the hotel after<br/>
the first night.)<br/>
<br/>
Also interested in learning about favorite hot spots of the<br/>
unschooling crowd, and if anything special will be happening on<br/>
those dates. We won&#39;t have much time to play while helping Nike get<br/>
everything set up, but I definitely don&#39;t expect to leave without<br/>
making a memory or two! Thrilled to know there&#39;s a strong<br/>
unschooling movement afoot in Canada -- we heard about your<br/>
struggles many years ago through the Moore Foundation when we were<br/>
first starting out.<br/>
<br/>
All the best from the Ard Family & me ~<br/>
Penne<br/>
