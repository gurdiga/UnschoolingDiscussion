<div id="ygrps-yiv-287891750"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt;&quot;Christian homeschooler&quot; indicates those intolerant fundamentalists.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I find this statement extraordinary.  There undoubtedly are many<br/>
&gt; intolerant people, some of whom homeschool, of a variety of spiritual<br/>
&gt; beliefs.  But to assume that all people who call themselves<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers *and* Christians are &#39;intolerant fundamentalists&#39; is in<br/>
&gt; itself incredibly intolerant and judgmental.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a huge difference between homeschoolers-who-happen-to-be-Christians<br/>
and Christian homeschoolers.  You just have to meet a few of them to see the<br/>
difference.<br/>
