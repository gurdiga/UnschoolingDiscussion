<div id="ygrps-yiv-523293117">So, I guess I raised some hackles with my last post.  Oh well.  I have thought about a lot of the responses and all of them have something to offer and I will continue to mull them over. I would like to talk a little more about my reasoning in limiting TV.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be blasted again with anything I say as it seems that the dissenters on this thread have dropped off but that&#39;s OK.  There&#39;s got to be a rabble rouser in every crowd and today it seems to be me.  (yeah,<br/>
there&#39;s more to this story but not for publication here as we&#39;re not discussing war stuff...thank goodness)<br/>
<br/>
Our house is a very open plan.  Therefore there is no place upstairs where the TV will not be seen and heard by everyone in the house if it is on.  I know that I am very auditory sensitive.  This means that with overload I get crabby.  No one needs that any more than necessary!  When I said that if anyone wants to watch TV then they have to be willing to be away from the rest of the family, that was sometimes true but what usually happens is that this means we all watch TV<br/>
together.  This would not happen if the tv was elsewhere.  If it was in the livingroom, we would keep on doing other activities and not tune in to what is on the tube.  I see this happen at my mil&#39;s all the time.  She turns it on and walks away and they end up watching some really inappropriate (in my opinion) things.  We like to watch with the kids so we can talk about what they are seeing.<br/>
<br/>
I was raised without a tv for my entire childhood and I thank my parents for making that decision.  I know I would have spent many hours on my butt watching idiotic shows and commercials.  Instead I spent hours outside and working on my own projects.  I am definitely not a tv addict now because I didn&#39;t have a tv earlier in my life so that arguement doesn&#39;t wash with me. My husband was raised with the tv always on.  He would chose to veg out in front of it much more than I<br/>
do.  With the tv out of the living space he can do that without the rest of us having to hear Jay Lenno or whoever is on late night now, without the rest of us having that junk interfere with our dreams.  This literally happened when the tv was in our bedroom.  I know the emotions that the tv bring into a house are powerful.  I was most sensitive to this when I was pregnant but I remember how I felt then, and know that they are just as powerful now although I am not as<br/>
perceptive now.  Kids are though.<br/>
<br/>
I want my kids outside rather than in front of some mindless show.  They have plenty of opportunities to watch stuff (including mindless shows) but they choose other things most of the time becuse the tv isn&#39;t the first thing they see when they get up in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
It seems as though a part of this discussion is really about how we, as parents feel about limit-setting in general.  The tv is one of the most obvious (that and food) chances we have to look at where we stand on this basic facet of parenting.  I happen to be of the opinion that children do need some limits.  (whoa, probably not to ppopular to say here).  I relate this to how I felt as a new EMT riding on our local volunteer rescue sqad.  I wanted to know that there was<br/>
someone else at my side who had more experience adn knowledge than I had.  It was felt safer knowing that there was someone there watching and making sure I was doing things right and thinking things through.  As my experience grew and I felt more confident, then it was OK to be the one in charge but that transition isn&#39;t always smooth.  Kids need to know there are boundries and that those bounderies will move as they are ready.  I know kids who have never had boundries<br/>
with their parents.  They are allowed to have coke and cookies for breakfast adn watch r rated movies at age 6.  This doesn&#39;t serve the child in the long run as they feel so alone in their decision making.  There is no one to fall back on, to get advice from.  So, yes, I think it is OK to set limits on some things.  Those limits are not set in stone.  They can and will move.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to open another whole can of worms but here goes.....<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t you think though that the real problem for kids like this is that<br/>
their parents don&#39;t want them around and use every opportunity to tell them<br/>
to go and watch TV just to get them out of their hair? That has been my<br/>
observation. I don&#39;t think it is so much a lack of limits as a lack of time<br/>
and love.<br/>

parents<br/>
feel about limit-setting in general.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the surface of it.  But underneath it&#39;s about clarity and mindfulness.<br/>
<br/>
Not having TV hasn&#39;t made you a peaceful, thoughtful person if your post is <br/>
typical.  Your descriptions included words like &quot;idiotic,&quot; &quot;mindless&quot; and <br/>
&quot;that arguement doesn&#39;t wash with me.&quot;   Edgy and emotional kind of writing.<br/>
<br/>
-=- children do need some limits. <br/>
(whoa, probably not to ppopular to say here). I relate this to how I felt as a<br/>
new EMT riding on our local volunteer rescue sqad. I wanted to know that there<br/>
was<br/>
someone else at my side who had more experience adn knowledge than I had.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Nobody here has ever left their kids in a cave alone, nor sent them out in an <br/>
ambulance all alone.  We&#39;re right where the kids are, we&#39;re right here.  <br/>
<br/>
-=Kids need to know there are boundries and that<br/>
those bounderies will move as they are ready.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean all boundaries are equally valid.  And by &quot;valid&quot; I mean <br/>
well-considered and fairly applied.<br/>
<br/>
-=I know kids who have never had<br/>
boundries with their parents. They are allowed to have coke and cookies for <br/>
breakfast<br/>
adn watch r rated movies at age 6. This doesn&#39;t serve the child in the long<br/>
run as they feel so alone in their decision making.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you know children who are alone in their decision making, that&#39;s a <br/>
situation far different from anything being recommended to you here.    You <br/>
seem to be recommending that children not have any part in &quot;their&quot; decision <br/>
making, but the parents decide.<br/>
<br/>
My children are never alone in their decision making.  Kirby (16) talks to me <br/>
about his girlfriend.  Marty (14) talks to me about his plans with friends.  <br/>
<br/>
I have children who &quot;are allowed to have coke and cookies for breakfast.&quot;<br/>
I have children who have never chosen to have coke and cookies for breakfast.<br/>
You have children who have never had coke and cookies for breakfast.<br/>
You think it is because you haven&#39;t allowed them that choice.<br/>
<br/>
The other day Kirby left the house really sleepy and I asked him to drink a <br/>
Dr Pepper on the way to driver&#39;s ed, because he was going to walk half a mile <br/>
on a really busy street and he had worked late.  He stopped drinking caffeine <br/>
at New Year&#39;s by his own choice, but he understood my concern.  My car was in <br/>
the shop and I couldn&#39;t drive him.   I was afraid for him to be groggy and in <br/>
that situation.  He took a Dr Pepper.<br/>
<br/>
I have children who could watch R rated movies at age 6.  5.  4.   <br/>
Today I had two children at 11 and 14 watching Shrek.  Sitting in a room full <br/>
of all KINDS of videos and DVDs and they chose Shrek.   That&#39;s different from <br/>
watching Shrek because it&#39;s not R rated and so it&#39;s on the allowable list.<br/>
<br/>
The TV&#39;s off right now.  Nobody&#39;s watching TV anywhere in the house.  Just <br/>
because everyone has chosen to do various other things, not because anyone <br/>
was shamed or teased or told to turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
For me, that&#39;s a very valuable thing.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It still wouldn&#39;t be the first thing they see when they get up in <br/>
the morning if you made the basement comfortable and cozy for them.<br/>
BTW, my kids usually choose to do something else right away in the <br/>
morning even though the tv is right in our bedroom.  And they are <br/>
making a genuine choice because they actually *have* a choice, and <br/>
they know that even if they *do* choose to watch tv nobody&#39;s going <br/>

I have also found that Jason (6 yo) especially is starting to get<br/>

principles rather then boundaries. And principles will *not* change.<br/>
They will remain the same because they apply to everyone, not just<br/>
those who have &quot;earned&quot; the right to have special privileges based<br/>
on age. My kids now have the right to have cookies and coke for <br/>
breakfast and they do it from time to time. But I have also seen that<br/>
they will also ask for 3 grilled cheese sandwiches and apples more <br/>
frequently then before. Their diet is balancing out (my 3 yo is actually<br/>
better about this then my 6 yo having not been controlled to the same extent).<br/>
If it is ok to eat cookies in the afternoon, why not the morning? Not to<br/>
mention the power struggles we now no longer have....<br/>

Just want to comment on this food thing. I&#39;ve found that my kids go <br/>
in spurts as to what and how they eat. With Tara, I worried. Then <br/>
with Joseph 9 years later, I forgot and worried again. I no longer <br/>
worry. We don&#39;t restrict or limit food. I did use to really want them <br/>
to eat what I made for dinner. That was before I joined this list. <br/>
Now dinners are more relaxed and a kind of free for all. My kids are <br/>
happier, Joe and I are happier and the kids actually eat better <br/>
making their own choices. <br/>
<br/>
I mentioned that Alyssa had pepermint patties for breakfast. One <br/>
morning she had pasta, chicken and meatball. Why worry about the <br/>
candy? Tonight she specifically asked me for pasta and chicken. She&#39;s <br/>
one very Italian child!! Sierra was wondering what to eat and I <br/>
mentioned that I had some soft tortilla shells and could make her a <br/>
soft taco but different than Taco Bell. She asked what I had to put <br/>
in it and decided to have sour cream, chicken and assorted cheeses. <br/>
The tortillas were bigger than taco size. I put one together and <br/>
popped it in the micro and she loved it. Asked for another one and <br/>
ate the whole thing. Then she asked for a bowl of Cocoa Puffs, <br/>
finished that and had a second bowl. This is a kid who will have 2 <br/>
pieces of cinnamon raisin toast for breakfast, then a poptart and <br/>
finish that off with a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios. The only thing I <br/>
worry about is her exploding!!!!!<br/>
Wonder why she didn&#39;t want any dessert tonight???<br/>

where your thinking could be clearer. Muddled thinking means muddled<br/>
conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would like to talk a little more about my reasoning in limiting TV.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What you&#39;ve written isn&#39;t reasoning -- as in a smooth flow of reasoned<br/>
thought to logical conclusion -- but a set of obstacles.<br/>
<br/>
People will go to extraordinary lengths to remove obstacles in front of<br/>
something they truly want. People will grasp at obstacles between them and<br/>
something they don&#39;t want and say they&#39;re insurmountable. The truth isn&#39;t<br/>
that they *can&#39;t* surmount them. The truth is they *choose not* to surmount<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was raised without a tv for my entire childhood and I thank my parents for<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The ends don&#39;t justify the means. Lots of people have come out stronger from<br/>
adversity but that doesn&#39;t justify the adversity they went through.<br/>
<br/>
You *can&#39;t* know how you would have turned out if you had been given free<br/>
access to TV. People imagine that unless kids are made to learn they won&#39;t<br/>
learn anything. It makes sense from the data they have available. But<br/>
they&#39;re wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know I would have spent many hours on my butt<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would you have chosen to watch idiotic shows? Even though I watched a<br/>
lot of TV when I was a kid, I was still selective. I never watched anything<br/>
that I didn&#39;t like. There are shows I watched as a kid that I wouldn&#39;t watch<br/>
now, but that&#39;s because I&#39;m not that kid any more and don&#39;t have the needs<br/>
of that kid. I&#39;m a different person.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am definitely not a tv addict now because I didn&#39;t have a tv earlier in my<br/>
&gt; life so that arguement doesn&#39;t wash with me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For a theory to be valid it has to explain all the data, not just the data<br/>
that supports it. Your theory doesn&#39;t explain why I don&#39;t watch a lot of TV<br/>
even though I had unlimited access as a child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My husband was raised with the tv always on.  He would chose to veg out in<br/>

because his parents left it on all the time? What other options did he have?<br/>
Did his parents interact with him and be with him? Why was he watching TV?<br/>
Was he watching TV as an escape from a distant home life or pressures at<br/>
school?<br/>
<br/>
Our TV when I was a kid was on when someone was watching and off when we<br/>
were doing other things. I used it to relax after the forced socialization<br/>
of school. I used it as a way of visiting other times and places. My needs<br/>
are different now though I do still make time for things I really want to<br/>
watch.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; without the rest of us having that junk interfere with our dreams.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you see it as junk then its presence is going to bother you a lot more<br/>
than if you see it as a resource.<br/>
<br/>
But stepping back objectively, if two people have needs that clash then it&#39;s<br/>
respectful to treat everyone&#39;s needs as important and work out a way for<br/>
everyone to get their needs met. Everyone&#39;s needs aren&#39;t equally important<br/>
but if you denigrate what someone else is doing (&quot;junk&quot;) then it&#39;s going to<br/>
feel justifiable to just tell them they need to stop so you can do what you<br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know the emotions that the tv bring into a house are powerful.  I was most<br/>
&gt; sensitive to this when I was pregnant but I remember how I felt then, and know<br/>
&gt; that they are just as powerful now although I am not as<br/>
&gt; perceptive now.  Kids are though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not all kids. Some kids. Some people for that matter. The less we think in<br/>
across the board needs of some mythical general population, the easier it is<br/>
to meet the needs of those unique inviduals we live with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I want my kids outside<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do *they* want?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; rather than in front of some mindless show.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would they choose to watch a mindless show?<br/>
<br/>
They may choose something you don&#39;t find worthwhile, but if they find it<br/>
interesting then it isn&#39;t mindless to them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they choose other things most of the time becuse the tv isn&#39;t the first thing<br/>
&gt; they see when they get up in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter chooses the best options she has available. Usually it&#39;s<br/>
drawing. And when she wants to watch TV, she turns on the TV. And when she&#39;s<br/>
done with it, she turns it off.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I happen to be of the opinion that children do need some limits.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do your children feel? How do you feel when people impose limits that<br/>
seem to make no sense to you?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I relate this to how I felt as a new EMT riding on our local volunteer rescue<br/>
&gt; sqad.  I wanted to know that there was<br/>
&gt; someone else at my side who had more experience adn knowledge than I had.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That isn&#39;t limitations. That&#39;s support.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It was felt safer knowing that there was someone there watching and making<br/>
&gt; sure I was doing things right and thinking things through.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Presumably you were making life and death decisions. Do you think your kids<br/>
are troubled and frightened when faced with the decision of whether to play<br/>
with a toy or draw or watch TV?<br/>
<br/>
We *are* there to support our kids. They aren&#39;t left to make decisions in a<br/>
vacuum and clean up the consequences. We&#39;re there by their side for them as<br/>
a sounding board and to help them pick up and start over when the outcome<br/>
isn&#39;t what they expected.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kids need to know there are boundries and that those bounderies will move as<br/>
&gt; they are ready.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter knows there are real life limitations to life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m here to support her, not to cage her and protect her. She knows I will<br/>
protect her from real dangers, just as I would protect my husband from doing<br/>
something he didn&#39;t have enough information to realize would have a bad<br/>
outcome. (Like reformatting the hard drive!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They are allowed to have coke and cookies for breakfast adn watch r rated<br/>
&gt; movies at age 6.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter can have coke and cookies for breakfast and watch R rated<br/>
movies. Though she has undoubtedly had cookies for breakfast the<br/>
overwhelming majority of time she chooses fairly standard meal type food.<br/>
(Though not necessarily breakfast food! She&#39;s had Chinese spare ribs and<br/>
pizza for breakfast.) She can watch R rated movies but has no interest.<br/>
There isn&#39;t anything in an R movie that has any appeal to her whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
Probably why those kids are making those choices is because they&#39;re parents<br/>
are disconnected from them, are basically letting the kids raise themselves.<br/>
That isn&#39;t what we&#39;re talking about at all. If the parents are there with<br/>
great choices that the kids like for breakfast it&#39;s unlikely the kids will<br/>
choose cookies all the time. If the parents are there watching TV with the<br/>
kids, or at least are aware of the types of programs and other interests<br/>
they have, are interacting with them, there isn&#39;t a reason to choose<br/>
programs that don&#39;t meet their needs. Why *would* a 6 yo watch an R rated<br/>
movie?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This doesn&#39;t serve the child in the long run as they feel so alone in their<br/>
&gt; decision making.  There is no one to fall back on, to get advice from.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one is suggesting that. There&#39;s a huge world of difference between giving<br/>
a child the freedom to make their own choices and letting them loose without<br/>
support.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, yes, I think it is OK to set limits on some things.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And there&#39;s a huge world of difference between supporting a child in their<br/>
decision making process and choosing for them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455832819">I&#39;m going to make an analogy, since I&#39;m usually able to think more<br/>
clearly about something when I look at it from a different angle.<br/>
Instead of television, let&#39;s say internet.  Presumably we all have<br/>
internet access in our homes (at least all of us who are posting).  If<br/>
you&#39;re posting but don&#39;t have access at home, then you&#39;re spending a lot<br/>
of time somewhere that has internet access, so it&#39;s important enough for<br/>
you to do so.<br/>
 <br/>
I think the internet was the single best invention humans ever made.<br/>
Honestly.  There is so much information on the internet that you could<br/>
travel to every library in your state and spend hours per day looking<br/>
and still not find as much as you can find in a one hour search online.<br/>
With the internet, people can form communities with like-minded people,<br/>
even if some of them are in Arkansas and others in Australia.  On the<br/>
internet, you aren&#39;t being judged by your hairstyle or clothes or weight<br/>
or age.<br/>
 <br/>
My mother wishes there was no such thing as the internet.  She hates it.<br/>
She&#39;s a librarian, and ever since they got the internet a few years ago,<br/>
she has unemployed men coming in and spending all day looking up porn.<br/>
There was one man who kept looking up not only porn, but also violent<br/>
things like how to make bombs.  One day he came into the library naked<br/>
and screaming at the top of his lungs, wielding a huge knife.  He<br/>
stabbed the counter over and over before the police got there.  <br/>
 <br/>
Porn and instructions on explosives are not the only things the internet<br/>
has against it.  People cheat on their spouses with people they met in<br/>
chat rooms.  People stalk other people, and perverts prey on children.<br/>
Not to mention just the simple stupidity of some sites.  My husband had<br/>
to work late one night and I was bored so I passed the time reading an<br/>
entire site about farts.<br/>
 <br/>
But we&#39;re all here, on the internet, despite all the bad things it can<br/>
be used for.  We&#39;re all learning more about unschooling and probably<br/>
learning many more things with the internet.  I doubt any of us are<br/>
learning how to make bombs or preying on children.  <br/>
 <br/>
My mom says the thing she hates most about the internet is how people<br/>
are on it all day.  I have a cable connection that allows my computer to<br/>
be online all day.  I love it.  I don&#39;t sit here staring at my computer<br/>
all day, but anytime I want to use it for any reason, I can.  It&#39;s right<br/>
there in my living room, next to the TV and a bookshelf, and I can check<br/>
my email during the two minutes my hot pocket is microwaving and go<br/>
about my day.  I&#39;m on it less than the people my mom talks about coming<br/>
into the library when they open and sitting there until closing, just<br/>
using the internet.  I could be on it 24 hours a day.  I&#39;m probably on<br/>
it 45 minutes per day.<br/>
 <br/>
Since you&#39;re online reading this, please explain to me how the bad<br/>
things about TV are worse than the bad things about the internet.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I missed the original post this was taken from Sandra&#39;s post, she quoted it, <br/>
so not sure who said it or if it was said in jest.  If it was I apologize in <br/>
advance.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I don&#39;t set boundaries randomly for my children.  There are some <br/>
boundaries that I have like hitting is unacceptable behavior.  My boys and I <br/>
have talked about this.  I do understand that sometimes they get frustrated <br/>
and can&#39;t express themselves and lash out.  We talk about it and try to do <br/>
better.  But my boys are always a part of the process.  <br/>
<br/>
And they have had coke and cookies for breakfast before.  That was their <br/>
decision and it doesn&#39;t always happen but if we have cake around sometimes <br/>
they want it for breakfast, sometimes I do to.  And sometimes they skip <br/>
breakfast or have cereal or an apple.  It isn&#39;t like if the cookies are <br/>
around they will always grab them to eat.  I think that is one of the gifts I <br/>
have given them.  The ability to see all food as equal.  They aren&#39;t always <br/>
asking for cake because cake has never been forbidden.  They see it as <br/>
another option and are just as likely to have an apple.  <br/>
<br/>
Also both have seen R rated movies. (6 and 8 yo) I watch with them but if it <br/>
is something they want to see.  If the movie is too intense in one way or <br/>
another then they tend to get up and walk away or ask to not watch and we <br/>
turn it off.  I don&#39;t think the G, PG, R, etc., rating are in any way a good <br/>
way to rate weather a movie is good or not. Or acceptable for my boys or not.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway just some thoughts this morning.<br/>

<br/>
Joyce wrote that and she has an only child.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby didn&#39;t watch many R rated movies, but Marty and Holly have watched more <br/>
of them than Kirby did. <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve never (ever) picked out a movie because of its rating, one way or the <br/>
other.  They choose them for historical period, or having an actor they like, <br/>
or for humor (way more humorous purpose here than any other), or for action.<br/>
<br/>
My kids saw Rocky Horror at young ages, or rather they were in the house when <br/>
I had it on for the music and humor.  My husband loves action adventure stuff <br/>
like Die Hard.   If it has spies and bombs and helicopters, he&#39;s there.  So <br/>
the kids have walked in and out on stuff like that, sometimes gotten <br/>
interested, sometimes not.  Same with me and some of their movies.  I still <br/>
haven&#39;t seen all of Shrek, but am familiar with most parts from passing <br/>
through.<br/>
<br/>
One aspect we habitually dodge here because it turns into religion and <br/>
politics is whether the parents are willing for their children to hear &quot;the f <br/>
word.&quot;  I don&#39;t mind.  If I minded, lots of movies would be right out for our <br/>
family.  Eddie Izzard&#39;s stand-up routine &quot;Dress to Kill&quot; is the main <br/>
attraction this week.  He uses the word casually.  He used it in French <br/>
(there&#39;s a long routine he did in France on the DVD too).   For &quot;the whole <br/>
damned world&quot; (paraphrase) he used &#39;tout le f***ing monde&#39; which I thought <br/>
was pretty funny.<br/>
<br/>
I bought Marty an autographed copy of Jay and Silent Bob Strike back for <br/>
Christmas, and a t-shirt to go with it.  Yet Marty is a considerate boy who <br/>
watches cartoons with his little sister and plays Harry Potter with her <br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
Anothe factor we haven&#39;t discussed much is that unschooled kids are not on <br/>
the school&#39;s timetable, nor following their patterns.  In school there comes <br/>
a time when a child might stop playing with dolls or action figures, because <br/>
he wants to be accepted as &quot;too big&quot; for that.   And so many kids under <br/>
school&#39;s influence will reject a phase or interest to go to the next.  What <br/>
they loved last year, they decide they &quot;hate&quot; this year.  Or things will be <br/>
declared &quot;that&#39;s for babies,&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s for elementary school kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Without that skin-shedding social behavior, a kid can watch an R rated movie <br/>
and then go outside and play house under sheets pinned to trees and then <br/>
check their e-mail and play Barbies.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of the television fear is that it would cause a child to lose <br/>
innocence and skip phases of play and thought.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t found that to be true.  On the contrary, my kids are willing to <br/>
choose their activities for personal and honest reasons, not because they <br/>
want others to think them cool.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not quite sure what this means. The part about being an only child?<br/>
<br/>
Tara was an only child for 9 years. She watched R rated movies when she was<br/>
young. Before she had any kind of school stuff going on. She watched movies<br/>
that interested her. At that time, I watched them first. The violence and<br/>
language didn&#39;t bother me but I did moniter then the sex scenes. She always<br/>
picked movies that had like robots or giant bugs and things in them. She<br/>
loved Jaws. Never any kind of Jason movies where people were running around<br/>
killing and getting killed. My kids now pick the same kind of movies. They<br/>
loved Lake Placid with the giant crocodile. And just recently, Joseph<br/>
watched Die Hard with Joe. Actually only parts of it. He would come and go<br/>
while it was on, find something interesting and then leave and come back<br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
When Tara started school, her friends were always talking about movies they<br/>
couldn&#39;t see. Tara didn&#39;t understand what the fascination was with them. She<br/>
saw them and they were no big deal to her. When she got older and started to<br/>
meet friends at the movies, she also couldn&#39;t understand why some of them<br/>
went off to sneak into another movie. They were R rated. Tara was going to<br/>
see the PG ones and the other kids were sneaking off. If she wanted to see<br/>
those R rated ones, she would have asked me and I would have taken her. Now<br/>
that&#39;s with school influence even.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t worry about the choices the kids are making now in this house.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, last Sunday we all celebrated Tara&#39;s 17th birthday. It was<br/>
the only day she wasn&#39;t already booked! Anyway, we all went to see Piglet&#39;s<br/>
Big Movie. Tara too. We all loved it. I mentioned that I wanted to take<br/>
Alyssa to her first movie. Sierra wanted to come, then Joseph said he wanted<br/>
to see it too. When Tara heard, she said she wanted to go with us. Even Joe<br/>
liked it. It&#39;s all about choices that are free to be made.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know this wasn&#39;t your point in the whole analogy (and it was a good <br/>
analogy), but I just had to comment that at the two libraries that we <br/>
go to most often, the librarians really don&#39;t like the computers.  <br/>
<br/>
At the first one, when they were rearranging to make room for a <br/>
computer center, I commented to the lady checking out my books how <br/>
neat it was that they were going to be getting all of these <br/>
computers.  She started going on about how she&#39;s not a computer <br/>
teacher, no one had better ask her how to use them, etc.  At the same <br/>
library, I heard that the board turned down a grant that would have <br/>
allowed them to computerize their system.  They prefer the &quot;old <br/>
fashioned card catalog&quot;.  They don&#39;t allow people to email anyone or <br/>
access chat rooms or message boards using their computers.  I asked <br/>
what their reasoning was behind that rule and they told me, &quot;Because <br/>
someone might email a bomb threat to the white house and then it <br/>
would come back that it happened from our computer&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
At the second library we sometimes go to, they are just kind of rude <br/>
about everything.  They seem annoyed and bothered when you ask about <br/>
using the computers, but then again they seem annoyed and bothered <br/>
about everything! lol  <br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s way easier to shelter/isolate/&quot;nest&quot; an oldest or only than it <br/>
is a child with older siblings.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I meant.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was more solidly into stuff designed for little kids than the other two <br/>
were, because when Kirby moved on to other stuff, Marty did (two and a half <br/>
years sooner) and Holly did (five and a half years sooner), just by being <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
But they&#39;re all just as willing to still watch &quot;kid stuff,&quot; and they were all <br/>
sad when Mr. Rogers died.  <br/>
<br/>
Was it this list where a mom confessed liking Teletubbies?  Holly liked it <br/>
and I&#39;ve watched it with her several times.  I love the little videos, and <br/>
the color stuff.  &quot;Purple!&quot;  Very still and slow and attractive.<br/>

<br/>
We own Mall Rats, Dogma, and Chasing Amy but haven&#39;t gotten around to own Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back yet because we have a DVD now and want to start getting that format. {and a little low of funds right now}<br/>
<br/>
They watch all kinds of scary movies but I thought it was interresting to note you can never know what will be scary. Kessa {my middle daughter} has watched &quot;Freddy&quot; with her sister with no problems, but when watching Dogma, she was  scared to go to the bathroom alone for a while because of the &quot;sh*t demon&quot; {we called him the doodie monster} but after we were there with her all the time she needed us she ended up fine.<br/>
<br/>
We also own some Cheech and Chong movies &lt;gasp&gt; and they think it&#39;s funny but with most of the things, like you said they come and go depending on their moods.<br/>

&gt; &gt; My mother wishes there was no such thing as the internet.  She<br/>
&gt; hates it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; She&#39;s a librarian, and ever since they got the internet a few years<br/>
&gt; ago,<br/>
&gt; &gt; she has unemployed men coming in and spending all day looking up<br/>
&gt; porn.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There was one man who kept looking up not only porn, but also<br/>
&gt; violent<br/>
&gt; &gt; things like how to make bombs.  One day he came into the library<br/>
&gt; naked<br/>
&gt; &gt; and screaming at the top of his lungs, wielding a huge knife.  He<br/>
&gt; &gt; stabbed the counter over and over before the police got there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know this wasn&#39;t your point in the whole analogy (and it was a good<br/>
&gt; analogy), but I just had to comment that at the two libraries that we<br/>
&gt; go to most often, the librarians really don&#39;t like the computers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At the first one, when they were rearranging to make room for a<br/>
&gt; computer center, I commented to the lady checking out my books how<br/>
&gt; neat it was that they were going to be getting all of these<br/>
&gt; computers.  She started going on about how she&#39;s not a computer<br/>
&gt; teacher, no one had better ask her how to use them, etc.  At the same<br/>
&gt; library, I heard that the board turned down a grant that would have<br/>
&gt; allowed them to computerize their system.  They prefer the &quot;old<br/>
&gt; fashioned card catalog&quot;.  They don&#39;t allow people to email anyone or<br/>
&gt; access chat rooms or message boards using their computers.  I asked<br/>
&gt; what their reasoning was behind that rule and they told me, &quot;Because<br/>
&gt; someone might email a bomb threat to the white house and then it<br/>
&gt; would come back that it happened from our computer&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At the second library we sometimes go to, they are just kind of rude<br/>
&gt; about everything.  They seem annoyed and bothered when you ask about<br/>
&gt; using the computers, but then again they seem annoyed and bothered<br/>
&gt; about everything! lol<br/>

talking ideas. This particular topic is the idea that you can allow children <br/>
more choices than you might have previously considered. It&#39;s worth <br/>
discussing here! These kinds of ideas don&#39;t get discussed in the mainstream. <br/>
Contolling children and making their &quot;big&quot; decisions for them is the norm.<br/>

like the TV in the family room. I can hear it even if I don&#39;t watch every <br/>

would have lost its mojo over you. Maybe you would have been attracted to <br/>
only one or two cool shows and turned it off for the rest. And you should <br/>
give yourself more credit. Why would you spend the majority of your time <br/>

should watch a good Brad Pitt movie before bed and wish real hard. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just kidding. But I do notice a lot of really loaded words in your post like <br/>
junk, idiotic, mindless, etc.  And now you&#39;re giving the tv potential <br/>
control of your dreams. That&#39;s a lot of negative energy right there, flowing <br/>
from your words.<br/>

&gt;&gt;in their decision making.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Neglect is not unschooling is not mindful parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want my children to feel alone in their decision making and <br/>
that&#39;s why I try to talk through decisions with them. Helping them <br/>
understand the potential consequences of their decisons is way different <br/>
from setting up rules and set-in-stone age limits and such.<br/>

Sweets in the morning won&#39;t kill a kid. Casey has had a cookie first thing <br/>
several times this week because Girl Scout cookies are here. They&#39;re only <br/>
around once a year and are very special. :o) She then goes on to have <br/>
regular breakfast. R rated movies are decided on a case by case basis. <br/>
Shakespeare in Love got an R rating and I just love watching that with my <br/>
kids. I&#39;m not going to turn down a movie based on ratings alone.<br/>

still have the little card in the back. :o) I love our computerized system.<br/>
I can access it at home, put holds on books and they call me when they come in<br/>
(especially handy when the book is at another library).<br/>
Or I can look up the call number for my books at home so that I can find them<br/>
easier (we always look up the boys books together at the library but they start<br/>
getting antsy when I look up books for me. Oh, I can also renew online and check<br/>
and see what fines I have due. :o) Or identify any books that we have not returned.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I have a hold on the new Harry Potter book...I wonder how many people<br/>
are before me! I hate buying hard covers but I don&#39;t want to wait for the book<br/>
to come out in soft cover!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-342423419">I have not had alot of time to respond to this thread, but I am reading the posts off and on.<br/>
<br/>
I recently said that I limited t.v. again in our house. I have to say that I do wish I was comfortable giving my kids free rein on the t.v. But, I don&#39;t. Not because I don&#39;t trust them or want them to decide, but because I do not want them exposed to the garbage that is on. Nor do I want to sit and watch t.v. <br/>
<br/>
I have read studies about how our minds become wired one way for t.v. viewing, and new paths are not made while viewing other shows. It is the same path when we are 5 that we have when we are 25. It is a passive task to sit there. This is my opionion, of course. I also just read another study that followed people from childhood until into the adult years, and the ones that watched violence, (shows like Baretta when they were younger), were more violent as adults. They were more likely to strike a spouse, be in trouble with the law, etc. I am not saying this is the case for all, of course, I just thought it was interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned a book once before that I find very interesting, called Magical Parent, Magical Child by Joseph Chilton Pearce. It includes alot of research, etc. Again, just one more tool. <br/>
<br/>
I want my kids to be able to make decisions for themselves, but why would I let my 5 1/2 year old go see the movie Cody Banks? He really wants to see it, but I just can&#39;t do it. It has violence, it shows women in a demeaning way, etc. How can I justify that? And, I feel if I agree to see it, I am saying that our values include giving money to people making those kinds of movies. It makes me sick to see some of the garbage that is offered. He loves movies so I want to be able to say yes to all of them he wants to see, but I don&#39;t want to polute his head with that junk! I totally trust him, I do not trust some of the people making t.v. and movies.<br/>
<br/>
I agree 100 % with allowing kids to self regulate, but I just can&#39;t stand the stuff on t.v. They have access to watching movies and dvd&#39;s, but I do say no to some of the movies they want. And we talk about why. The world is flooded with so much junk, I want to try and limit the amount they see  or at least delay it. It is inevitable in our world.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion...<br/>

worth the consequences they&#39;ll suffer later. Perhaps the effect is so far<br/>
removed in time that it doesn&#39;t seem connected. A couple of hours to a 5 yo<br/>
may seem like a day later. Perhaps they aren&#39;t aware enough of the change<br/>
(if it&#39;s behavioral). From the outside hyper is a pretty dramatic change.<br/>
From the inside it doesn&#39;t feel that different. They may need help in<br/>
identifying the subtle (to them) feelings.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Being of a scientific bent, I&#39;m drawn to studies. But what I&#39;ve found is<br/>
that real people with real stories of what and how they do things are far<br/>
more meaningful. It&#39;s especially true with unschooling families. *All*<br/>
studies -- unless they&#39;re specifically about homeschooling -- are done on<br/>
schooled kids because essentially all kids are schooled kids so that&#39;s the<br/>
norm. Researches have *no clue* how huge of an impact school has on<br/>
children&#39;s behavior. By their nature schools are designed to separate kids<br/>
from their parents and create basically a new family for them, a family of<br/>
teachers and age-mates.<br/>
<br/>
That seems harsh but when you look at it objectively, the major portion of a<br/>
child&#39;s day is spent in school or preparing for school. Much of the<br/>
interactions between child and parent have to do with school. But even more<br/>
importantly, those hours spent under the influence of school are when the<br/>
child is presented with challenges to test their values on. They are alone<br/>
in one sense since they don&#39;t have their parents to support them and help<br/>
them. And they are dependent on peers and teachers in another sense to see<br/>
what values are useful and how they play out in action.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not just that peers and teachers may have values that we&#39;d rather<br/>
our children not pick up. They have values that are unique to school. For<br/>
instance we value helping each other but in school that&#39;s a big taboo. And<br/>
when kids get home that bond between parent and child isn&#39;t as strong as it<br/>
should be and kids won&#39;t share the things they&#39;re working through. They&#39;re<br/>
getting used to -- in fact their parents are *forcing* them to -- watching<br/>
and figuring out solutions on their own. TV is going to be another resource<br/>
to them of values and how those values play out for them.<br/>
<br/>
It takes some powerful communication skills for families to maintain the<br/>
close ties they have with their kids before beginning school. Schooled kids<br/>
are far more influenced in their values by sources outside their families.<br/>
<br/>
In a loving home where children are respected and where the parents are<br/>
involved with their kids lives (not glued to them but are with them and<br/>
aware of what&#39;s going on with them and what interests them) TV loses much of<br/>
the power that is found in homes where children are leading separate lives<br/>
from their families.<br/>

&gt; strike a spouse, be in trouble with the law, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And you can find studies that say the opposite. The studies only study<br/>
*what* and not why. Did the violent shows *create* violent adults? The<br/>
studies imply that. Or are children who are filled with frustrated emotions<br/>
who don&#39;t know what to do with them, who are in danger of becoming violent,<br/>
drawn to violent shows?<br/>
<br/>
Since many peaceful people enjoy watching violence that&#39;s a huge piece of<br/>
data that contradict the studies. *Why* someone is drawn to something is far<br/>
more important than *what* they are drawn to.<br/>
<br/>
Even though why is a far more important influence it&#39;s very difficult to<br/>
design studies to study it. So researchers stick to studying what.<br/>

making the same choices you would for them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you realize this but your opinions are saying that you feel<br/>
that violence and disrespect is more attractive than feeling loved so your<br/>
kids will turn their backs on what makes them feel good in order to hurt<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think they&#39;d do that?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m going to make an analogy, since I&#39;m usually able to think more<br/>
clearly about something when I look at it from a different angle.<br/>
Instead of television, let&#39;s say internet.  Presumably we all have<br/>
internet access in our homes (at least all of us who are posting).  If<br/>
you&#39;re posting but don&#39;t have access at home, then you&#39;re spending a lot<br/>
of time somewhere that has internet access, so it&#39;s important enough for<br/>
you to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I think the internet was the single best invention humans ever made.<br/>
Honestly.  There is so much information on the internet that you could<br/>
travel to every library in your state and spend hours per day looking<br/>
and still not find as much as you can find in a one hour search online.<br/>
With the internet, people can form communities with like-minded people,<br/>
even if some of them are in Arkansas and others in Australia.  On the<br/>
internet, you aren&#39;t being judged by your hairstyle or clothes or weight<br/>
or age.<br/>
<br/>
My mother wishes there was no such thing as the internet.  She hates it.<br/>
She&#39;s a librarian, and ever since they got the internet a few years ago,<br/>
she has unemployed men coming in and spending all day looking up porn.<br/>
There was one man who kept looking up not only porn, but also violent<br/>
things like how to make bombs.  One day he came into the library naked<br/>
and screaming at the top of his lungs, wielding a huge knife.  He<br/>
stabbed the counter over and over before the police got there.  <br/>
<br/>
Porn and instructions on explosives are not the only things the internet<br/>
has against it.  People cheat on their spouses with people they met in<br/>
chat rooms.  People stalk other people, and perverts prey on children.<br/>
Not to mention just the simple stupidity of some sites.  My husband had<br/>
to work late one night and I was bored so I passed the time reading an<br/>
entire site about farts.<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;re all here, on the internet, despite all the bad things it can<br/>
be used for.  We&#39;re all learning more about unschooling and probably<br/>
learning many more things with the internet.  I doubt any of us are<br/>
learning how to make bombs or preying on children.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom says the thing she hates most about the internet is how people<br/>
are on it all day.  I have a cable connection that allows my computer to<br/>
be online all day.  I love it.  I don&#39;t sit here staring at my computer<br/>
all day, but anytime I want to use it for any reason, I can.  It&#39;s right<br/>
there in my living room, next to the TV and a bookshelf, and I can check<br/>
my email during the two minutes my hot pocket is microwaving and go<br/>
about my day.  I&#39;m on it less than the people my mom talks about coming<br/>
into the library when they open and sitting there until closing, just<br/>
using the internet.  I could be on it 24 hours a day.  I&#39;m probably on<br/>
it 45 minutes per day.<br/>
<br/>
Since you&#39;re online reading this, please explain to me how the bad<br/>
things about TV are worse than the bad things about the internet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-169312920">From: &quot;Amie&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:amiersa2@...">amiersa2@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I recently said that I limited t.v. again in our house. I have to say that<br/>
I do wish I was comfortable giving my kids free rein on the t.v. But, I<br/>
don&#39;t. Not because I don&#39;t trust them or want them to decide, but because I<br/>
do not want them exposed to the garbage that is on. Nor do I want to sit and<br/>
watch t.v. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Seems like you are not trusting what your kids will do with what they see<br/>
and hear. That&#39;s not trusting them. It&#39;s also a matter of you doing<br/>
something for you children that you just don&#39;t want to do, watch tv.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I mentioned a book once before that I find very interesting, called<br/>
Magical Parent, Magical Child by Joseph Chilton Pearce. It includes alot of<br/>
research, etc. Again, just one more tool.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t take studies and eperts to heart. I would rather listen to<br/>
people and what they have done and what has worked and what hasn&#39;t. Seeing<br/>
is believing and putting it all to practical use makes much more sense to me<br/>
than what someone studied. Especially when all the studies are done on<br/>
children I don&#39;t know, don&#39;t know how their parents are with them and who go<br/>
to school. I know homeschooled children that make homeschooling look really<br/>
bad. You should see how they are parented. Their behavior has nothing to do<br/>
with homeschooling. If someone did a study on those few, it would be<br/>
pitiful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I want my kids to be able to make decisions for themselves, but why would<br/>
I let my 5 1/2 year old go see the movie Cody Banks? He really wants to see<br/>
it, but I just can&#39;t do it. It has violence, it shows women in a demeaning<br/>
way, etc. How can I justify that? And, I feel if I agree to see it, I am<br/>
saying that our values include giving money to people making those kinds of<br/>
movies. It makes me sick to see some of the garbage that is offered. He<br/>
loves movies so I want to be able to say yes to all of them he wants to see,<br/>
but I don&#39;t want to polute his head with that junk! I totally trust him, I<br/>
do not trust some of the people making t.v. and movies.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t see how you can say you trust your child when you are not<br/>
trusting them to make good sound decisions, learn from mistakes and reason<br/>
out for themselves what is best.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I agree 100 % with allowing kids to self regulate, but I just can&#39;t stand<br/>
the stuff on t.v. They have access to watching movies and dvd&#39;s, but I do<br/>
say no to some of the movies they want. And we talk about why. The world is<br/>
flooded with so much junk, I want to try and limit the amount they see  or<br/>
at least delay it. It is inevitable in our world.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t possibly agree 100% with allowing them to self regulate when you<br/>
only allow them to regulate certain things. It&#39;s either you do or you don&#39;t.<br/>
Like unschooling except for math. Makes no sense.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering if limiting them from all the junk and garbage you say tv<br/>
and movies hold, if you wondered what will happen when they finally see it.<br/>
And they will. Probably at an age of more curiousity, like in their teens.<br/>
Again I have to go by what I&#39;ve seen and heard, not studies. Those kids all<br/>
of sudden exposed go nuts. They want to see it all, no matter what it is.<br/>
It&#39;s new and exciting at a time where exciting is more entailed than when<br/>
they were little.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend who sheltered her son from violence and what she thought was<br/>
attitudes demeaning to women. Her son gradually grew older and wanted to see<br/>
a Lethal Weapon movie. Not sure which one but there was a scene where you<br/>
saw a women and some cleavage or maybe the side or top ofher boobs. She<br/>
wasn&#39;t even big up top and the son, in the movie theater yelled out totally<br/>
excited that he wanted to see more. Now I&#39;m not saying all kids do that, but<br/>
that reaction is very similar with children not use to it and not being able<br/>
to ask in a very innocent way what&#39;s going on. His hormones were talking and<br/>
he never saw boob before. Children I know of raised like that usually get<br/>
very excited and want to see everything they can and will sneak to do it, or<br/>
become very embarassed by it all and never ask a thing. Either way, not<br/>
healthy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387653831">Not to menton that no matter what there is no way to get a completely accurate result in any study. There are so many varibles in the lives of the people of both sides. <br/>
Just as my husband and I were talking about second hand smoke but it applies to any study. Yes, they can do as much as they can to get an accurate result. but how about the guy who it seems to have had the same experiances, yet at the very least he may have lived in an area that had smog or worked near a factory that put off pollutants into the air {yes we all have this but some areas are better then others and it varies depending on the year} Or maybe his genetics carried some recessive gene that didn&#39;t show up in his family for generations. Etc... <br/>
Anyway just an example for my take on studies. I think they are interresting but there are so many varibles that could go overlooked or missed somehow, I tend to rely personal experiances myself. :-) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Being of a scientific bent, I&#39;m drawn to studies. But what I&#39;ve found is<br/>
that real people with real stories of what and how they do things are far<br/>
more meaningful. It&#39;s especially true with unschooling families. *All*<br/>
studies -- unless they&#39;re specifically about homeschooling -- are done on<br/>
schooled kids because essentially all kids are schooled kids so that&#39;s the<br/>
norm. Researches have *no clue* how huge of an impact school has on<br/>
children&#39;s behavior. By their nature schools are designed to separate kids<br/>
from their parents and create basically a new family for them, a family of<br/>
teachers and age-mates.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People who do not watch tv seem to have the impression that there is <br/>
nothing but scary or offensive or just plain stupid reality shows, <br/>
trashy daytime soaps, smartmouthed kids on sitcoms, and scummy talk <br/>
shows ala Jerry Springer, all mixed in with incessant brainwashing in <br/>
materialism in the form of commercials. But, that makes me wonder, if <br/>
you think that, what on earth do you think WE are doing actually <br/>
watching it and letting our kids watch it?  Do we, those of us who say <br/>
we watch TV and don&#39;t have restrictions placed on our kids&#39; viewing, <br/>
really sound like people who are of the kind of mentality that we&#39;re <br/>
interested watching that stuff? Do you really think that our kids have <br/>
become product-worshiping I-gotta-have-that consumers and that we&#39;d be <br/>
defending that?<br/>
<br/>
People who have &#39;rules&#39; about TV might want to consider why they need <br/>
them? They might wonder about how we handle materialism - in the face <br/>
of commercials. They might wonder how we handle the possibility that <br/>
the kids will see scary stuff or stuff that is too sophisticated or <br/>
sexually explicit or cruel or demeaning to specific races or to women, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
If the TV (watch it or don&#39;t) debate could just move up a step to a <br/>
slightly higher plane of discussion, I think those who do restrict tv <br/>
time would discover some interesting things about those of us who do <br/>
not. Framed as &quot;restrict tv&quot; versus &quot;no restrictions&quot; misleads those <br/>
who don&#39;t really know what the alternatives to &quot;no restrictions really <br/>
are, and picture our kids sitting zombie-like eyes glued to the tube, <br/>
watching whatever pops up in front of them for hours on end. It just is <br/>
not like that in any of the no-restrictions households that I know <br/>
well. I wish we could talk more about the way kids in our <br/>
no-restrictions families DO interact with tv - it is really different <br/>
than in other families, in my experience, and really well worth taking <br/>
time to examine in depth. But we always get distracted by general <br/>
comments like, &quot;I just cannot stand the junk on TV,&quot; and we don&#39;t get <br/>
beyond it very often.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I think it is really interesting that my kids have <br/>
conversations about shows they want to watch together - they take time <br/>
to consider each other&#39;s interests and age level and so on. They LIKE <br/>
to have their sisters or me watch shows with them because they want to <br/>
talk about them later.<br/>
<br/>
Another little interesting thing is how they&#39;ll tape something and <br/>
watch it over and over and over and over. I know this isn&#39;t uncommon <br/>
and I&#39;d like to talk about what is going on when a kid does that - to <br/>
an extreme.It looks like some kind of brain exercise - the mental <br/>
equivalent of bouncing a ball against the garage door, over and over.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of things about kids who don&#39;t have specific <br/>
tv-limits/rules that are interesting and I wish we could talk about <br/>
those without feeling like we have to even address the &quot;no tv/yes tv&quot; <br/>
issue at all.<br/>
