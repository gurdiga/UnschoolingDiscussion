<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890693156">Just in case anyone had saved that Turtle thing to quote later, I implore you <br/>
to change &quot;Splinter&quot; to &quot;Shredder,&quot; or I&#39;ll never be able to show my face in <br/>
Kirby&#39;s Turtle-shrine room again.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One of my fondest memories is of putting out a creche scene one Christmas (a<br/>
&gt; Christian home-diarama) of Italian design and manufacture, about 5&quot; high on<br/>
&gt; the adults, and made of hard plastic, like from the 1950&#39;s or 1960&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I saw it for what it was.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kirby and Marty saw it as what it was from their point of view:  &quot;Jesus<br/>
&gt; action figures&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One day I came in and there were two Ninja Turtles adoring Jesus, while a<br/>
&gt; king and a shepherd had gone off to help vanquish Shredder and the Foot <br/>
