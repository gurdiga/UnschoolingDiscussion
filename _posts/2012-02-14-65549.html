-=- we were looking into Rosetta Stone. They are offering it to the school district we are in at quite a reduced rate. I called them and ask if they would offer the same rate for us, homeschoolers, in the same district. He said no, that they can&#39;t. I thought that was too bad and an example of homeschoolers being penalized. I hope I don&#39;t sound like a whiner, but I have to admit I felt put out by it all.-=-<br/>

Some companies will give homeschoolers a discount, but to feel we&#39;re entitled to be treated as schools at the same time we should be grateful not to have to have our kids in school does seem more negativity than is healthy or sensible.<br/>

I think the discount they offered was motivated by volume purchasing by the school, not any sense of educational good deeds. Ask if they offer volume licensing for any other groups if you think it is worth pursuing<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93701108">Or see if the district will be a go between or passthrough for you.<br/>
Might depend on what kind of contract they have with Rosetta but could be<br/>
Rosetta could care less so long as there is not extra paperwork for them.<br/>
If the reduced rate is substantial enough don&#39;t complain if your local<br/>
school tacks on a small handling/convenience charge to get such a rate for<br/>
you to use off campus.<br/>
