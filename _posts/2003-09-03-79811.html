<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138419598">Need some sage words from some unschoolers. My children are 2 and almost 8. <br/>
since dd was born, it has been hard to read to ds, or do many games etc. Dd <br/>
doesn&#39;t really sleep during day, and is up late at night. Being a toddler she <br/>
needs to be in on whatever we do. Lately she has taken an interest in TV for the <br/>
first time, and likes a Winnie Pooh video, or Caillou. Am I being neglectful <br/>
to utilize this to read etc. to ds? We have no limits on the tv, but while I am <br/>
delighted to be reading etc. with ds, it feels funny to use tv for dd.We <br/>
didn&#39;t have much tv when ds was little.Any thoughts, opinions?<br/>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s neglectful at all.<br/>
<br/>
In a more natural  human environment (rather than the nuclear family in a <br/>
locked-up-box model we&#39;ve been living the past fifty years), there would be other <br/>
older kids for the older one, or older girls to carry the toddler around, and <br/>
you wouldn&#39;t have the problem of having a 1:2 ratio.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, but you didn&#39;t NEED &quot;another storyteller&quot; when he was little.  You had <br/>
no need to divide yourself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>very true Sandra. I just need another person to point it out. You and Ren <br/>
both made me relax. I really need to connect with my ds, he needs my undivided <br/>
attention sometimes, and I think dd is surviving, besides which I was dying to <br/>
read the latest Harry Potter!<br/>
