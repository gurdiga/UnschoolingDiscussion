<div id="ygrps-yiv-259823266">Hi,<br/>
I am really getting excited reading about this conference. I just <br/>
enrolled my husband and son (of course myself) since it&#39;s the same <br/>
price even if my husband decides not to. I decided I would like to <br/>
make a mini- family vacation out of it. Of course he knows I wanted <br/>
to go but doesn&#39;t have any idea that I signed him up also LOL.......<br/>
I also signed up for the whale watch. I wonder if another adult can <br/>
take my husbands spot on the whale watch if he really needs to work <br/>
or doesn&#39;t want to go ?????????<br/>
When I read that it was in SC the last couple of years I figured I <br/>
should probably jump @ the chance.<br/>
See you all there <br/>
