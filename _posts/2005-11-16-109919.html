I cut the l of html but didn&#39;t even need it in the first place.   Very sorry.<br/>
(Thanks, Kelly, for letting me know I was a big screw up.   Thanks a lot!   <br/>
Really.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013761898">Luv Deb&#39;s food ideas.  All the  garbanzo/chickpea dishes are so flavorful.  Another garbanzo  favorite around here are falafels.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982453326">I like the ideas and everything, but just wanted to point out the<br/>
following...<br/>
<br/>
We grow the most when we are babies and we supposedly need protein to grow.<br/>
The best food for babies is breastmilk. Breastmilk contains only 5% protein<br/>
(less than 5%, I think), so why would you need more than 5% protein in your<br/>
diet at any other time of your life? Most foods already contain at least 5%<br/>
protein, including most veggies.<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the things Dr. McDougall mentions. I&#39;m not veggie, but just<br/>
wondering why you think your kids need more protein.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who&#39;s Dr. McDougall?<br/>
<br/>
If I don&#39;t have protein I get a very bad headache.   Same with two of my <br/>
kids.   Not my husband.   Some people seem to be able to live a day or two on <br/>
donuts.   I might live, but others around me might be sorry I had because after <br/>
the headache comes the whiney expressions of pain.   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Need&quot; to grow, &quot;need&quot; to survive isn&#39;t the same as &quot;need&quot; to be comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Not all snacks have to be protein, but when a child is not feeling strong or <br/>
is getting cranky or headachy, it&#39;s worth offering protein and if it helps it <br/>
helps.<br/>
<br/>
People need balanced diets, but school health classes taught it as a <br/>
three-times-a-day situation, resulting in some people&#39;s feeling of deprivation if they <br/>
have a single meat-free meal.    Mean three times a day isn&#39;t natural in <br/>
cave-man terms.   It seems cavemen survived, and they didn&#39;t kill an animal every <br/>
single day.   There are nuts and roots and berries.     For those who don&#39;t <br/>
care to consider cavemen, how about farmers in 1880?   They didn&#39;t kill an <br/>
animal every day.   They had meals of beans or biscuits and gravy or rice and <br/>
vegetables (depending where they were).<br/>
<br/>
And of the evils of preservatives, many cultures have known about smoking, <br/>
salting and drying foods for a long time.    Vinegar; that&#39;s a preservative.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not necessarily -more- protein but spread out more than the typical <br/>
three square meals social convention. Just as a demand fed <br/>
breastfeeding baby will have his/her protein needs spread out over <br/>
the course of a whole day, so too DS spreads his eating out over the <br/>
whole day. Ideas for snacks containing protein is not to increase <br/>
the overall quantity of protein necessarily (since each person&#39;s <br/>
protein needs vary) but rather to provide ideas for things that are <br/>
relatively quick and easy and tasty and help meet that need For <br/>
instance, hummus scooped in bits of flat bread is a quick finger <br/>
food that can be munched while playing board games. (If breastmilk <br/>
is 5% protein and a baby averages 6 ounces of it every 3 hours or <br/>
about 6-8 times per day, totalling 36-48 ounces, then 2 to 4 ounces <br/>
of protein or so spread over a day is about the same amount, not <br/>
more, just different sources - a piece of cheese, some hummus, <br/>
whatever). I&#39;ve looked at McDougall&#39;s information and I tracked what <br/>
we ate each day for a few weeks and wouldn&#39;t you know it, we still <br/>
came in within what his &#39;good range&#39; except on days when we had <br/>
chicken for dinner - we still ate grilled cheese sandwiches and nuts <br/>
and cheese and such. The thing was we were eating it spread out <br/>
throughout the day to help balance the carbs/sugars (crackers, <br/>
fruit, veggies, etc). And keeping that balance is definitely helpful <br/>
for my DS to maintain an even keel emotionally and behaviorally.<br/>
Just my two cents<br/>
