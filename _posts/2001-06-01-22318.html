<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787704037">You know, at least a part of me is pulling for the kids.  The older sister<br/>
is 16, not exactly a baby and they are obviously able to take care of<br/>
themselves.   Do any of you have any idea how traumatic it is to have a<br/>
police force insert themselves into your live when you have not asked for it<br/>
and do not desire their &#39;help&#39;?  Take my word for it, no matter how this<br/>
ends, it will never end for these children.  They will have this event as a<br/>
turning point for their entire lives.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;  No easy answers.  Here&#39;s hoping the kids manage to not make their<br/>
circumstances so bad in the eyes of some authority person that this haunts<br/>
them for the rest of their lives AND that no one is seriously injured<br/>
(family under &#39;siege, law enforcement OR neighbors)!<br/>
