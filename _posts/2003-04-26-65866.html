&gt; THEIR<br/>
&gt; &gt; proofs or reasons helps.  <br/>

&gt; Could you give a few examples?  I have a hard time coming up with things<br/>
&gt; on the spot.  I usually sound defensive or loony.   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My favorite comment so far was, &quot;I knew a homeschooled kid once (read that as <br/>
ONE kid) and he was odd. Your kids seem fine, but they&#39;re young yet.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
After asking a few questions, it turns out that he was being homeschooled <br/>
because his parents wanted him isolated from the evil and ungodly public <br/>
school students. I tried to explain to her he could have very well been what <br/>
she considered &quot;odd&quot; whether he went to public school or was homeschooled and <br/>
incidentally, there are plenty of &quot;odd&quot; kids that aren&#39;t homeschooled around.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, my kids aren&#39;t what she considers odd yet, but give them time. <br/>
