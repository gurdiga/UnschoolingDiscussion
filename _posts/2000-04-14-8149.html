<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445150124">Sorry Lynda<br/>
I didnt even think of that . So I wrote down the poem and typed it for <br/>
everyone.<br/>
<br/>
                                  Friends Are Like Angels<br/>
<br/>
Our friends are like angels,<br/>
who brighten our days.<br/>
In all kinds of wonderful,<br/>
magical ways.<br/>
<br/>
Their thoughtfulness comes,<br/>
As a gift from above.<br/>
And we feel we&#39;re surrounded,<br/>
By warm, caring love.<br/>
<br/>
Like upside-down rainbows,<br/>
Their smiles bring the sun.<br/>
And they fill our ho-hum moments,<br/>
With laughter and fun.<br/>
<br/>
Friends are like angels,<br/>
without any wings.<br/>
Blessing our lives,<br/>
with the most precious of things.<br/>
<br/>
