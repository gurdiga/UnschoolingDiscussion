Recently I was using google as I watched Little Britain, so I could get some <br/>
of the jokes.   There&#39;s a character ordering all sorts of hoity fancy foods in <br/>
a restaurant, and at the end of each sketch he says, &quot;And...&quot; and throws in <br/>
some little-kid thing, like once Hubba Bubba.   I knew Hubba Bubba, but I <br/>
didn&#39;t know Ribena or a Lyon Bar, and something else I looked up and don&#39;t remember <br/>
what. <br/>
<br/>
Ribena&#39;s currant-flavored squash, I think, and squash isn&#39;t what it is here <br/>
(that&#39;s for sure!). It&#39;s a drink based on barley water.   Barley water isn&#39;t <br/>
like anything we have here either.   Squash (for American translation) tastes <br/>
like KoolAid, only it has a thickness and a texture to the water.   It&#39;s not <br/>
really clear--kinda murky, but in a homogenous murky way.    Some comes drinkable <br/>
as is (I&#39;m guessing Ribena does) and other comes concentrated so you mix it <br/>
with water.<br/>
<br/>
And the importance of ANY of this!? <br/>
To get jokes.<br/>
<br/>
Best reason to know Shakespeare, too--to get jokes.<br/>
There are other reasons, but how much humor goes right by if one doesn&#39;t know <br/>
Hamlet!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-229446951">Hi<br/>
   Hubba Bubba here is a brand name of bubble gum. Squash is a fruit <br/>
based (not 100% juice,mostly chemical)  liquid concentrate that you <br/>
dilute with water. Some high juice varieties of squash have up to <br/>
50% juice but the kind that was available when I was growing up and <br/>
the kind most people have is probably about 5% or 10 % fruit.<br/>
<br/>
Orange flavour was the most common followed by lemon. Ribena is <br/>
blackcurrant based squash drink, but it is also now available in <br/>
ready to drink cartons and also other flavours. Everyone used to be <br/>
mad on Ribena (mad = crazy here). I guess Ribena was slightly more <br/>
posh than squash, it was  always hideously expensive compared to <br/>
squash.<br/>
<br/>
Robinson&#39;s barley water is a type of squash. It is as far as I know <br/>
the only one that is a barley water. It used to be only available in <br/>
lemon or orange flavour, now it comes in other flavours. Class wise <br/>
it was more &#39;posh&#39; than squash.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of snobbery and class prejudice attached to food in <br/>
the UK. Some of it is quite subtle. It can be hard to grasp for <br/>
people outside of the UK. especially as some traditional working <br/>
class food, that the working class no longer eat, becomes <br/>
fashionable with the middle classes.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the humour of Little Britain and Monty Python has class <br/>
based humour in it. The difference between the culture of the North, <br/>
South and the Midlands can sometimes mean the humour is <br/>
misinterpreted. I know a few people from the south and they just do <br/>
not get the  northern/midlands cultural references in some shows.<br/>
<br/>
Btw your chocolate covered Moon pies see very similar to a product <br/>
here called Waggon wheels. They have the marshmallow filling but <br/>
with a bit of jam in. <br/>

 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; Hubba Bubba here is a brand name of bubble gum.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It comes in a pack (not filled) or even individual juice filled pieces.  My<br/>
dc used to buy them by the handful every time we went to the shop for at<br/>
least a month or two after we first arrived).<br/>

 <br/>
Sounds a bit like Kool-Aid but doesn&#39;t taste much like American Kool-Aid<br/>
imo, Not as sweet?.  I&#39;ve heard people here who have had Kool-Aid say how<br/>
much they adore it and have relatives send it to them because they like it<br/>
so much. <br/>

    I remember that and never understood why then as I thought the<br/>
blackcurrant <br/>
was even worse than regular squash drinks.  <br/>

     I got this impression that barley water was an old lady&#39;s drink<br/>
somehow.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
For myself I always liked the barley water better than the squash&#39;s<br/>
and the blackcurrant.  Maybe because it made me think a bit of lemonade.<br/>

 <br/>
Dh says the guys where he works have said how much they dislike that show.<br/>
A new series just started<br/>
last week so I guess it was part of the conversation last week.  My favorite<br/>
character, of the few shows I&#39;ve seen, is the homosexual Welshman.  &lt;g&gt;   <br/>

hadn&#39;t seen them here in Wales until I found them in a machine.  I think I<br/>
might be one of the only ones <br/>
to have bought them because I&#39;ve noticed there are always wagon wheels but<br/>
everything else disappears.  <br/>
By the way, the company who make the ww&#39;s must be getting very sparing on<br/>
the jam because I <br/>
didn&#39;t see it.  &lt;g&gt;    No one has asked me to buy more ww&#39;s.  <br/>

for tennis doubles but take a break right away for courtside barley water and <br/>
scones.<br/>

English actress (Natasha Richardson, doing a great American accent), Irish <br/>
actor (Liam Neeson, who&#39;s doing an Irishesque American accent, and said <br/>
he/character was from an Irish family), all doing an English play.    Then there&#39;s <br/>
Jodie Foster, totally American, but said in the commentary that after living in <br/>
