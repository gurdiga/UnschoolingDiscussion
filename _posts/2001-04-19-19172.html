&gt;This is exactly what I was trying to get at! I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;know how to explain this! Do you know of any books,<br/>
&gt;articles, etc. that talk about this stuff? <br/>

Hmmmm, I don&#39;t have any references for you Diana.  My<br/>
instinct tells me that I would try to be as honest as<br/>
possible about cultural roles, and what is good and<br/>
bad about them.  THis is a difficult question.  I<br/>
would like to hear what parents of older children, who<br/>
have already dealt with, or are already dealing with<br/>
these issues, have to say.  Anyone?<br/>
