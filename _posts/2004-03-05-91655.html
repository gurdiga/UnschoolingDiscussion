&lt;&lt; Yet people choose to support the part where it says that homosexuality is <br/>
an<br/>
<br/>
abomination and to read into it that you should prevent others from marrying<br/>
<br/>
who they choose whether they are Christian or not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;People latch on to what they want to support their hatred and to live as<br/>
<br/>
they please. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told my kids that no religion follows EVERY rule in the Bible (or Koran, <br/>
or the teaching of Buddha, or the Book of Mormon) which is why there come to <br/>
be sects and denominations and independent congregations.  They differ in <br/>
their emphases, priorities and interpretations.  I grew up learning why Baptists <br/>
have chosen to ignore big chunks of the Bible because there&#39;s a new covenant <br/>
now, yet plucking chosen bits and pieces out of &quot;the old covenant&quot; when it suits <br/>
their purposes to do so.  Same with every splinter group.  And the &quot;main <br/>
groups&quot;: LDS, Roman Catholic Church, whichever monasteries are oldest--have all <br/>
augmented their basic beliefs with later revelations and executive decisions and <br/>
interpretations and traditions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the way it works with people.   <br/>
<br/>
So arguing dogma in relationship to a movie is like arguing whether a piece <br/>
of art is appropriate for one church or another.  Each small group will decide. <br/>
 Clean empty cross is what the Baptists have.  Bloody messy cross, Catholics. <br/>
 Others might have a drape or a heart or a pattern but they decide what fits <br/>
their iconography.<br/>
<br/>
Mel Gibson had enough money to make a piece of art.  It&#39;s not Catholic art, <br/>
it&#39;s Mel Gibson art.   Take it or leave it.<br/>
<br/>
So the question was about sending kids, and I think the decision&#39;s been made, <br/>
right?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know of any great websites where this moviehanks to those who turned <br/>
it back toward unschooling!)<br/>
