<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607189290">-=-I didn&#39;t pay much attention to the history of it because I went to<br/>
school and I never learned about all that LOL-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not paying attention to history in school shouldn&#39;t be an excuse to last the <br/>
rest of one&#39;s life.  He was talking about the history of homeschooling and <br/>
public schools, neither of which is taught in school.   It surprises me that some <br/>
people really don&#39;t know or care about the history of homeschooling, but I do <br/>
care, and I learned it as I&#39;ve gone, in homeschooling, and I&#39;ve never trusted <br/>
the word of one single source but read things myself and waited to see if it <br/>
seemed true.   <br/>
<br/>
If there are people who really don&#39;t care about what&#39;s real or not about <br/>
history, to whose advantage is it to say &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t see a problem&quot;?  If people <br/>
are printing this out for others to read or putting it on webpages, I DO see a <br/>
problem because it&#39;s slanted and based on fallacy.  <br/>
