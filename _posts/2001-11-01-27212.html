<div id="ygrps-yiv-380062708">And for another view........ I remember thinking that it could be a rather<br/>
radicalizing experience to think you were this great gem to your family but that<br/>
they were unwilling to make any financial sacrifices or financial risks to hope<br/>
for your safe return.    All we kept hearing was how the bulk of  the assets<br/>
were tied up in trust................but a few incredulous journalists pointed<br/>
out that  plenty of personal belongings (I believe mention was made of an<br/>
extensive private art collection) were NOT being carried out and sold.<br/>
Brought the concept of &quot;poor little rich girl&quot;  home.<br/>
I was not the only one in my circle who &quot;knew&quot; that my parents or my family<br/>
would strip bank accounts, mortgage homes................to pay extraordinary<br/>
medical expenses,  to raise bail,  or to show a good faith sacrifice to buy<br/>
their child&#39;s life.     Yep.   Similar to the radicalizing experience of certain<br/>
journalists covering peaceful, legal, civil demonstrations  who were mistaken<br/>
for participants instead of reporters  and got to experience firsthand what<br/>
happened during and after the roundups by officers with tape over their<br/>
badges.....<br/>
<br/>
Folks talk about the 60&#39;s but there was plenty of turmoil and pain in the 70&#39;s.<br/>
(Kent State was May 4, 1970..............and for many was the BEGINNING of a<br/>
political awakening as well as disillusionment).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611114284">At the time, I found the Stockholm syndrome idea hard to fathom.<br/>
<br/>
But now, setting Patty aside, I can understand the possibility a little<br/>
better.  Certainly children who have terrorizing parents still manage to love<br/>
them and warp their behavior a lot to try to please them.  That sounds kind of<br/>
like the Stocklholm syndrome to me.  So it seems there is a valid underpinning<br/>
for this concept, tied to basic human behavior.<br/>
