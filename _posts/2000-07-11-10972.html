<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557366296">I have a situation in my home and I doubt any of you<br/>
can relate to it but maybe someone has a suggestion as<br/>
to how to handle this situation. My DH is a police<br/>
officer. And my 5yo son is very aware of what daddy<br/>
does. We have been very open with him about it. It is<br/>
hard not to be when 5 days a week he sees daddy put on<br/>
his uniform with full gear and head out the door for<br/>
work. Well, the other night when DS was saying his<br/>
bedtime prayers one of the things he said was to bless<br/>
daddy not to get shot. He has never said this in his<br/>
prayers before and it really took me by surprize. I<br/>
didn&#39;t know what to say to him. Bed time is often<br/>
difficult because he misses daddy. So I asked him if<br/>
that was the reason that he misses daddy so much at<br/>
bedtime and he said it was. He&#39;s afraid that DH will<br/>
get shot at work. DS has also said in the past that he<br/>
thinks that DH sits and shoots bad people all night<br/>
long. We have tried to explain to him that this is not<br/>
the case. I don&#39;t think he gets  it though. The other<br/>
night I didn&#39;t want to say that DH wouldn&#39;t get shot<br/>
because I don&#39;t know that won&#39;t happen. That is<br/>
possible however small that likelyhood is. I don&#39;t<br/>
want to say this will never happen and then it does.<br/>
Then DS will think I lied to him and he will be right.<br/>
I asked him if I could have some time to think about<br/>
it and then give him and answer. He said that was<br/>
fine. When I talked to DH about it he didn&#39;t want to<br/>
make an issue of it with DS. He was afraid that if we<br/>
said anything more to him or made a big deal about it<br/>
then it would further dramatize the idea in DS&#39;s head.<br/>
I feel differently. I told him I would think on it and<br/>
then give him and answer and that is what I feel I<br/>
must do. Any suggestions as to what to tell DS about<br/>
daddy gettin shot at work?<br/>

Goodness! This conversation about your husbands work is a biggie.  When<br/>
this level of stuff comes up -- I&#39;m with you -- that all the sensitivity<br/>
and thought can make it a real learning and healing point.    Two things<br/>
come to mind.  !st -- how great that he has come out with his concern and<br/>
is praying for help and safety for his father.  I might try to transform<br/>
this into a blessing for his health and safety (instead of the &quot;not get<br/>
shot&quot;  -- on the other hand this sounds like something he may need to be<br/>
able to say!).  I might offer &quot;Please bless Daddy and all the folks he<br/>
meets tonight.  Keep them safe and help them find good ways to work out all<br/>
their problems.&quot;  The 2nd thing I thought of was that many people have<br/>
concerns for the safety of loved ones when they are working, for all sorts<br/>
of reasons.  Not that your son needs to be made aware of other dangers and<br/>
concerns, but it might be another refernece point that helps you expand the<br/>
sense that others are with him praying for peace in the world.  Good luck<br/>
with this.<br/>
And thanks for including us in this thoughtful and important discussion!<br/>
Blessed Be Amy</div>
