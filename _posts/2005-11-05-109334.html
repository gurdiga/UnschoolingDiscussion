<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623038713">&quot;But, does anyone know of any online forums or courses<br/>
along the lines of any of his interests especially ones that would be<br/>
geared towards homeschoolers or at least, children? I recall that<br/>
someone had started a writers&#39; workshop. Does anyone have information<br/>
about that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Why is your first response to his interests all about a class?<br/>
Sometimes that is the very WORST way to assist a child in expanding<br/>
their world. I could be way off-base here, but you said he&#39;s just<br/>
getting through the DE-SCHOOLING process....why put him into classes<br/>
just now?<br/>
<br/>
The BEST way to help a child explore their interests imo, is to get<br/>
them around other people with those interests. Whether online or in<br/>
real life (preferably in real life at that age) they have a wonderful<br/>
group to bounce ideas off of, relate to and create with.<br/>
<br/>
I did see that you asked for classes geared for homeschoolers...but<br/>
sometimes those are the worst.<br/>
<br/>
I know someone started an email group for writers...that might be a<br/>
fun way to explore creative writing. I believe it was Pam S (correct<br/>
me if I&#39;m wrong?) and it&#39;s writing prompts...so he could pick and<br/>
choose what he would like to use from that.<br/>
<br/>
Classes in general are not my first response to an interest. We DO<br/>
take classes here and there, but not before buying the child materials<br/>
they want, seeking out others with same interests and exploring it online.<br/>
<br/>
Some interests lend themselves to a group experience, like theatre or<br/>
Choral singing. But many interests are actually better explored in<br/>
smaller, intimate groups, without formal instruction of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
I think the best thing anyone can do for a child that is interested in<br/>
writing, is fill them up with amazing, beautiful and rich experiences<br/>
to write about. Good writing comes from passion....live a life of<br/>
passion and the writing will start flowing.:)  The structure of it and<br/>
 editing skills can come later. It&#39;s the ideas that matter most right now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943862020">**Good writing comes from passion....live a life of<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m trying to think of non-class things.  (My son is really negative <br/>
about the word &quot;class&quot;.  And he&#39;s never been in school, just Kindermusik <br/>
and Gymboree long ago.  I think he really just hates to be told what to <br/>
do when.  A natural unschooler and really lucky not to be in school.  <br/>
He&#39;s subversive and funny.  I used to joke that the government should <br/>
pay me to keep him home, as I can picture him being the class clown.  I <br/>
should get a subsidy! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Journaling may be one way to get writing to flow, if the idea appeals to <br/>
him.  Certainly many writers like to have a notebook or computer file to <br/>
jot down their fleeting ideas.<br/>
<br/>
When stuck in the car, my eleven year old has listened with me to author <br/>
interviews on National Public Radio.  (Mostly &quot;City Arts and Lectures&quot; <br/>
and &quot;Fresh Air&quot;.)  It could be intriguing to hear authors he likes <br/>
talking about their upcoming works and answering questions about how <br/>
they write.   I think both of these programs have audio archives, so <br/>
with a fast internet connection, one can listen to old programs on the <br/>
computer, for free.  And skip any dull parts!<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s 3 prompts per week (one story prompt, one a play with language  <br/>
prompt and one that&#39;s usually both) and something (tip, adopt-a-plot)  <br/>
on Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found most prompts tend to be geared towards contemporary  <br/>
writing and since I like fantasy and science fiction and historical  <br/>
mysteries -- basically anything that isn&#39;t contemporary ;-) -- these  <br/>
tips are at least speculative fiction friendly :-)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a bunch of the most recent ones:<br/>
<br/>
===<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a nifty thing on line:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.literacyrules.com/storystarter.htm">http://www.literacyrules.com/storystarter.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Just click on &quot;Start the Modern Story Starter&quot; button and get a story<br/>
starter. Wish they were more fantasy based! But the idea is neat.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t like the one&#39;s generated there, here&#39;s a more<br/>
speculative fiction one inspired by those at the website:<br/>
<br/>
My protagonist is a female. My protagonist is a ghost hunter. The<br/>
antagonist in my story is a archaeologist. A key object or symbol in<br/>
my story is a spider&#39;s web. My story will be set in an old temple. My<br/>
story is about pride.<br/>
<br/>
====<br/>
<br/>
When writing dialog, it&#39;s okay to use &quot;said&quot; when you want to help<br/>
the reader keep track of who&#39;s speaking. In fact it calls too much<br/>
attention to your writing (rather than keeping the attention on the<br/>
story!) if you try to use a lot of different words instead of said.<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes characters *are* &quot;blustering&quot; and &quot;cooing&quot; and<br/>
&quot;lisping&quot; and occasional use of them can add some sparkle to the<br/>
story and the character :-)<br/>
<br/>
Write the alphabet down the side of the page. Set the timer for 10-15<br/>
minutes.<br/>
<br/>
For each letter come up with a different way (or ways) to say &quot;said&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
===<br/>
<br/>
Set the timer for 10-15 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Link one word to the next until you have a sentence. Pick a word to<br/>
begin a sentence. The next word in the sentence should start with the<br/>
ending letter of the previous word. For example if the first word is<br/>
Good you might come up with:<br/>
<br/>
Good dogs shouldn&#39;t tell lies.<br/>
<br/>
And if the first word is Twenty you might come up with something like:<br/>
<br/>
Twenty yellow waterlillies skunked Donald Duck&#39;s snake.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some initial words. Use whatever random words pop into your<br/>
head for more :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cat<br/>
Stupidly<br/>
Fire<br/>
Wings<br/>
Pinned<br/>
<br/>
===<br/>
<br/>
This is from WritersDigest.com -- Free Writing Prompts<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.writersdigest.com/writingprompts.asp">http://www.writersdigest.com/writingprompts.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
Something�s rotten in your refrigerator. Write a scene in which the<br/>
condiments residing in the door shelves plot to take over the prime<br/>
real estate on the top shelf, front and center. Will milk be spilled?<br/>
(And who�&#39;ll be crying?)<br/>
<br/>
===<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another list of real movie titles. Pick one. Set the timer for<br/>
10-15 mintues and write.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are new, you probably won&#39;t have a complete story when<br/>
you&#39;re done, just the beginning. If you&#39;re really liking it, of<br/>
course keep going when the timer goes off! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Aelita: Queen of Mars<br/>
Africa Screams<br/>
After the Fox<br/>
Against the Drunken Cat Paws<br/>
Fear Eats the Soul<br/>
Almost Angels<br/>
Queen of the Desert<br/>
Anna to the Infinite Power<br/>
Ark of the Sun God<br/>
Autopsy of a Ghost<br/>
<br/>
===<br/>
<br/>
Write the alphabet down the side of the page. Pick a favorite topic<br/>
like video games, baseball, Star Trek, unschooling, fantasy<br/>
characters and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Set the timer for 10-15 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Using strong images that you could illustrate list colorful words and<br/>
phrases for each of the letters. Use alliteration if you want, eg,<br/>
Ailing Aliens arming ancient alligators, Belligerent Batboys<br/>
bellowing at butterflies ....<br/>
<br/>
===<br/>
<br/>
Write the alphabet down the side of the page.<br/>
<br/>
Set the timer for 10-15 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Write a fantastic food for each letter of the alphabet, like Alicia&#39;s<br/>
Alluring Apples and Bernie Bott&#39;s Every-flavor Beans :-)<br/>
<br/>
Make up words that sound like foods if you can&#39;t think of something<br/>
right away since I&#39;m betting X at least will be tough! :-)<br/>
<br/>
===<br/>
<br/>
I was going to suggest you embarrass yourselves by buying one at the<br/>
supermarket, but The Weekly World News is online now.<br/>
<br/>
:::whew!:::<br/>
<br/>
The print version is still more fun but you can now get stories about<br/>
3 eyed aliens living among us displayed right on your computer :-)<br/>
<br/>
Read some of the articles in the print version or at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.weeklyworldnews.com/">http://www.weeklyworldnews.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
to get a feel for the style.<br/>
<br/>
Make up a headline or choose one of the following.<br/>
<br/>
* My Ex-Wife&#39;s Face Keeps Appearing On My Toast! ...and she&#39;s making<br/>
my life crumby!<br/>
* Vampires Picket Blood Bank!<br/>
* Bush To Use Bigfoot G.I.s In Iraq!<br/>
* NASA Idiots Turn Mars Rovers Into Battlebots!<br/>
* Psychic Cat Makes Predictions In Kitty Litter!<br/>
* Noah&#39;s Ark found on Mars!Moon will hit Earth in five years!<br/>
* CIA using cats as secret agents!<br/>
* Scientists mix dog and cat to create the Dat!<br/>
* Real reason for war in Iraq: Bush wanted to protect the Garden of<br/>
Eden from Saddam!<br/>
* Dolphins are growing arms and legs&quot;(&quot;If they learn to walk and make<br/>
weapons, they would become a formidable foe for all mankind&quot; we are<br/>
warned)!<br/>
* Librarian wants rating system for nursery rhymes!<br/>
* BLIND MAN REGAINS SIGHT AND DUMPS UGLY WIFE!<br/>
* Visiting space alien endorses candidate for president!<br/>
* Bat Child Found in Cave!<br/>
* Merman Caught in South Pacific!<br/>
* Millions of 3-eyed Mutants Living Among Us!<br/>
* Twelve Members of Congress Are Space Aliens!<br/>
* Ten Ways to Tell If Your Mail Carrier is an E.T.<br/>
* Middle Earth being found in the swamps of New Jersey!<br/>
<br/>
Set the timer for 10-15 minutes and write your own Weekly World News<br/>
report.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, they have a &quot;Guess the Headline&quot; feature with a photo and you<br/>
submit headlines for it. There are previous winners. (Note, some do<br/>
have sexual references.)<br/>

in getting support for some of his creative interests. These include<br/>
creative writing, cartooning, computor animation and game making.***<br/>
<br/>
Check with your local comic book stores.  Some of the stores around here<br/>
are publishing comic book anthologies by local cartoonists.   The<br/>
anthologies come out four or six times a year (or whatever) and there&#39;s<br/>
no charge to get work into the book.   The comic book store gives the<br/>
authors/cartoonists copies free to pass around to friends and sells the<br/>
others.   It can be really fun to see one&#39;s own work in print and for<br/>
sale on the racks at a favorite comic book store.   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reading what Joyce offered as a story-starter made me think of  <br/>
another activity that might really interest those who enjoy being  <br/>
really creative in making up stories. My kids are involved in  <br/>
Destination Imagination and a LOT of our team meeting time involves  <br/>
them being given story elements very much like Joyce&#39;s story starter  <br/>
and their challenge is along the lines of: you have 4 minutes to plan  <br/>
and 2 minutes to perform. So they do lots of those, throughout the  <br/>
year PLUS they have one &quot;central&quot; challenge that is worked on over  <br/>
the months. At the tournaments, they get one quickie challenge and  <br/>
they present their solution to the long-term performance.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;www.destinationimagination.org&gt; is the website, if anybody is  <br/>
interested. It is structured sort of like sports competitions, so I  <br/>
can see that it might not be everybody&#39;s cup of tea, but it has been  <br/>
really fun for us. This is our fifth year and the team of 6 kids is  <br/>
adamant that they don&#39;t even care how they do at the tournament, they  <br/>
just want to do it because they enjoy the process. I think it has  <br/>
been REALLY good for them in learning to problem-solve  <br/>
collaboratively, for one thing, but also how to put together a  <br/>
coherent sequence of events - it can be hard but really useful for  <br/>
people to be REALLY creative, off-the-wall, outside the box - and  <br/>
still be intelligible, internally consistent in telling stories.<br/>
<br/>
I think this activity allowed my kids to keep &quot;playing pretend&quot; long  <br/>
past the age that most children seem to give it up. Another way they  <br/>
do that is by playing all kinds of role-playing games.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049050998">Ren, you are right. I do err when I tend to think of classes. That is <br/>
definitely my inclination and not necessarily what is good for him.I <br/>
think that my priority would be to help my son meet peers who have the <br/>
same interests. But this is hard to do especially with these pasttimes <br/>
which are mostly solitary. My son does not like to be a part of groups <br/>
or structure in fact, but he does getlonely. He would like others to <br/>
talk about his interests with and share ideas. I guess I am really <br/>
looking for ideas about how he could meet other children who are <br/>
interested in creative writing, technology and online game creation. I <br/>
fear that he is getting pretty isolated. Most of the homeschoolers <br/>
around here that we have access to are doing traditional school at <br/>
home stuff.<br/>
Thanks, Andrea</div>

The technology interests might be able to be a &quot;hook-up&quot; point with  <br/>
other kids. You might introduce him to the &quot;First Lego League&quot;  <br/>
organization - see if that interests him. Just an idea.<br/>
