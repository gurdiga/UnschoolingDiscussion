<div id="ygrps-yiv-145042786">Sandra and I have been having a discussion about how to offer love to <br/>
a child who is showing signs of not being &#39;happy in his skin.&#39;  I&#39;ve <br/>
included part of the discussion below for those who might have <br/>
skipped over the other thread because it was about teenagers.<br/>
<br/>
As an insiration, I&#39;d love to hear from more of you about the ways <br/>
you gently love a kid who&#39;s in need of it, without getting under <br/>
their skin instead.  <br/>
<br/>
This seems like a good opportunity to start another thread, as this <br/>
applies to all age children.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Laura B.<br/>
