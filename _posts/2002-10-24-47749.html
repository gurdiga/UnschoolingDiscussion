<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe too, she is ahead of playing with her ages. Are<br/>
&gt; these kids her same age? I know my Alyssa (2) doesn&#39;t like to play with 2<br/>
&gt; year old stuff and does much better with older kids. Then we she does get<br/>
&gt; around younger ones, she has a tendency to play better because it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; different. But mostly she doesn&#39;t like to play like most 2 year olds.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had this situation, too.  Tim has always enjoyed playing with older<br/>
kids who were willing to include him, and really enjoys littler children,<br/>
but the fastest way to start a fight was to put him in with other kids his<br/>
own age.  It was true at 2, and 3, and 4.  These days he chooses to play<br/>
with kids of different ages than himself, but he doesn&#39;t fight with the<br/>
other 6 year olds, he just avoids them.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if this might be the entire root of the problem with age-grouping.<br/>
Older children are able to be kind to younger ones, and then the little ones<br/>
go off and enjoy being the &quot;big kids&quot; to even littler ones for a change, but<br/>
there&#39;s just something psycologically wrong with being with all kids the<br/>
same age.  <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm.  New place for my brain to wrap around tonight!<br/>
