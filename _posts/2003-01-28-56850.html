<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460952633">&lt;&lt;...they say it to each other all the time.  I never did get that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As the mom of several minority children perhaps I can explain.  If one of my<br/>
kids grabs one of my other kids in a head lock, gives him a noogie and<br/>
squawks &quot;I&#39;m gonna kill you, you little shit.&quot;------it is much different<br/>
than if Billy Bob Redneck, drunk as a skunk, gets one of my kids in a head<br/>
lock and says &quot;I&#39;m gonna kill you, you little shit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One is rough housing, one is life threatening.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120215966">&lt;&lt;how hypocritical when you dole out censorship on practical every day<br/>
terms&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Teresa,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on this list for years now.  No one has ever censored practical<br/>
every day terms here.  When people use words like &quot;practice, teach, lessons,<br/>
etc.&quot; on this list, red flags go off that this person is probably not<br/>
unschooling or at least not explaining themselves well.  Questions are<br/>
asked, comments are made.  The person gets defensive and attacks Sandra.<br/>
Just like if I were on an email list of Baptist ministers, someone using<br/>
terms like &quot;twat, prick, fuck&quot; in posts would send up red flags that perhaps<br/>
the person wasn&#39;t your run of the mill Baptist minister.  Questions would be<br/>
asked, comments would be made there as well.<br/>
<br/>
I am so sad that people have such a need to bring hatred and ugliness onto<br/>
this list.  It has been a life line for me, here in Bob Jones/Abeka land.  I<br/>
faithfully read every email to reinforce to myself that my kids are humans,<br/>
they are worthy of my respect, they are on their own paths.  This list, and<br/>
Sandra in particular, have changed the lives of my family and I am having a<br/>
hard time not being rude to people who appear to revel in cheap shots rather<br/>
than either ignoring or truly trying to see what this list is about.<br/>
