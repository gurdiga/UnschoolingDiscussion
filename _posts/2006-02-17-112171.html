<div id="ygrps-yiv-193611762">I had a dream last night... a nightmare.  Very symbolic and scarier<br/>
while awake than while I lay dreaming it.  It was definitely related<br/>
to things that are happening in our lives, but I came away with some<br/>
insights that I&#39;ve heard many times on this board about relating to<br/>
one another in the family within the unschooling philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
In the dream people were impressed with the potential of a great power<br/>
which had been used individually but never collectively to the<br/>
magnitude they wanted to use it.  &lt;&lt;Skip to the part I remember<br/>
vividly upon awakening... &gt;&gt;  There were holes in the earth.  People<br/>
bundled up and threw many sticks down into the holes then covered and<br/>
bottled the holes up.  Very shortly there came shaking, rattling,<br/>
reverberating, exploding, trembling all over, violence.  The people<br/>
shook up and down, fell and were catapulted by the upheavals.  At<br/>
first they were impressed at the power they had created with the<br/>
sticks.  Then the shaking stopped, and people and animals lay bleeding<br/>
and dying.  Whew.  I awoke.  <br/>
<br/>
Stunned by how amazingly archetypal and elemental/ elementary the mind<br/>
is in sleep.  I wish I understood the lingo more often.  Bottled up<br/>
&quot;sticks&quot; led to these gigantic HUGE explosions.  I thought the dream<br/>
blatantly spoke of anger.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up thinking a lot about that.  A long list of stuff: <br/>
* Not allowing anger too important a space in our lives or giving it a<br/>
louder bang by bottling it up, but rather cooking on an &quot;open fire&quot; so<br/>
to speak<br/>
* Thinking, talking and acting on things that matter to us on a<br/>
personal not abstracted level; avoiding hypothetical issues (people in<br/>
the dream were actually cheerful about the potential for damage as<br/>
though it wouldn&#39;t effect them and the look on their faces was eerily<br/>
familiar... I wondered why... the tendancy to abstract things/<br/>
distract ourselves removes us emotionally so that real present issues<br/>
can seem unrelated)<br/>
* Talking and listening a bit at a time all along the way as we live<br/>
our lives together; allowing &quot;steam&quot; to escape gradually from the<br/>
&quot;kettle;&quot; sharing generally in a wider space rather than narrowing our<br/>
outlets<br/>
* Exercising reason while alone in our thoughts as well as in<br/>
conversation together<br/>
* Being friends with everyone&#39;s needs and emotions<br/>
* NOT bottling up needs and  emotions or using them for power; but<br/>
rather empowering ourselves and others simultaneously and sanely<br/>
* Having a safe space for anger; not allowing it to overwhelm<br/>
ourselves and those around, or else everyone is traumatized<br/>
* Stirring not from nervousness but enough to keep things from<br/>
sticking onto the bottom and sides; not settling for sour burnt<br/>
tastes; seeking out and stirring for happiness<br/>
* Avoiding fancy alarms (labels for instance, or prejudgements, akin<br/>
to entertaining hypotheticals); NOT abdicating our voices and minds to<br/>
self-appointed experts; being aware ourselves of self and others;<br/>
speaking to the individual not statisticize ourselves and others; in<br/>
other words, tending the &quot;kettle&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
The thought passed through my mind at some point that anger probably<br/>
isn&#39;t even a primary emotion (not my idea but something I read.... I<br/>
think it was Marshall Rosenberg in NonViolent Communication).  Anger<br/>
is probably fueled by other needs and emotions like love, fear,<br/>
hunger, etc...  things that ARE primary.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447512684">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; scarier<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; There were holes in the earth.  People<br/>
bundled up and threw many sticks down into the holes then covered and<br/>
bottled the holes up.  Very shortly there came shaking, rattling,<br/>
reverberating, exploding, trembling all over, violence.  The people<br/>

sticks.  Then the shaking stopped, and people and animals lay bleeding<br/>
and dying.  Whew.  I awoke.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The insights that you have gained in the thinking it over later are really<br/>
interesting. I especially endorse the idea of not letting things stew until<br/>
they turn into big resentments. I had to learn that early in my marriage,<br/>
and I still sometimes forget.<br/>
<br/>
However I want to add an idea to ponder based on the concept that you say<br/>
here - that the fear came later on awakening. I think the emotions felt<br/>
during any vivid dream are really important clues as to the real meaning.<br/>
<br/>
I think the &quot;earth&quot; here could be a symbol for your Self - the upheaval and<br/>
shaking perhaps symbolic of upheavals or changes in your thinking and your<br/>
life - possibly related to paradigm shifts with Unschooling, possibly not.<br/>
<br/>
My thought is that since you saw that changes can be visceral and have<br/>
consequences (the wounded creatures), yet did not feel fear or anger at the<br/>
time - I mean the dream self did not feel those emotions - but only later<br/>
once awake and back in the conscious self, saying the dream is speaking of<br/>
anger just because it was energetic, *may* be too literal, too blatant. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the message that your higher self is sending you, is that these<br/>
changes and upheavals, while appearing vigorous and damaging of the Old<br/>
Self, need *not* to be feared. The old &quot;you can&#39;t make an omelet without<br/>
breaking eggs&quot;. This is similar to the Tarot card &quot;The Tower&quot; which is an<br/>
indicator of incipient great upheaval, initial destruction and change - but<br/>
not bad change in the end, change to be welcomed and embraced. <br/>
<br/>
OTOH it could be as simple as a fear you are holding on to that some<br/>
relatively trivial planned action or event is going to turn out badly (the<br/>
cheery folk later surprised by the devastation.) Sometimes our dreams are<br/>
less &quot;earth shattering&quot; than they seem. (Oh did I really make that dreadful<br/>
pun.....)<br/>
<br/>
Way cool that you could remember so much of it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-868873102">Hmmm.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll gain more and different insights as time goes on.<br/>
 And what you bring up is definitely something I don&#39;t want to hear--<br/>
paradigm change and all that.  I do feel stretched beyond my limits of<br/>
imagination at times during waking life, that&#39;s for sure.  Not due to<br/>
unschooling per se but life and marriage.  What you&#39;ve said definitely<br/>
bares thinking about.<br/>
