them out some years ago -- they were new. My kids and dh and myself played <br/>
with them all evening and had a GREAT time. The next morning a friend was <br/>
here - a 9 yo friend. He started playing with them in an ENTIRELY different <br/>
way - building 3-dimensional things. We&#39;d ALL been stuck in the level of <br/>
building flat things - not one of us had built upward!!!!  <br/>
