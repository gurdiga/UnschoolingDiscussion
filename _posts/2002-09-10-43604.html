<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319257294"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As far as I know, unless you have a ticket, you cannot get up to the waiting<br/>
&gt; area&#39;s in airports anymore. So in most airports it is impossible to get the<br/>
&gt; good view of planes landing and taking off like you get at the boarding<br/>
&gt; waiting area. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Frankfurt International has a pretty neat little viewing area in the cafe<br/>
outside the waiting area which my son likes.  You might call the nearest<br/>
airport to see if they do.  However, if you&#39;re not near a decent sized<br/>
airport or they don&#39;t have a viewing area, maybe you could check out the<br/>
yellow pages and see if there&#39;s a small, private airport near you.  It<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be exactly the same as the big planes, but it might be fun but<br/>
loud, which sounds like it might address some of your children&#39;s concerns.<br/>
