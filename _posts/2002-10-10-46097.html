Thanks for this.  I agree wholeheartedly.  Open-minded doesn&#39;t means your<br/>
brains have fallen out.  When did being open-minded start meaning that you<br/>
agree with everything?  And how could you agree with everything?  Being<br/>
open-minded simply means you&#39;ll listen and CONSIDER the other possibilities. <br/>
I&#39;ve listened to Myranda&#39;s arguments and I still think her choice is wrong. <br/>
No more, no less.  Doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s not a really nice person.  Doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
I won&#39;t agree with her in the future.  <br/>
