<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-45099728">There is an element of truth to the idea that health care workers question the possibility of abuse.  I think most of the people I work with (and I work in trauma) try to give the benefit of the doubt though. <br/>
<br/>
But the fact is, at least where I work, that each time you are moved to a new area, from ER, to preoperative, to OR, to post operative, to the new floor, etc.  You will be asked the same questions.<br/>
<br/>
And the only reason is because we all have our own admission forms to fill out and the paperwork is not always finished in one place before you get moved to the next.  <br/>
<br/>
Inefficient, but true.<br/>
