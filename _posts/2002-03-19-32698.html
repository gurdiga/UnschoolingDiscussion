Hi Bonnie,<br/>
Although I have looked into Sudbury education, I don&#39;t know any books out there. Here are some websites - www.sudburynetwork.org and www.sudval.org (this one is an actual school). Basically from what I have read and heard from parents whose children attend is that there are 2 kinds of Sudbury education schools (aka Free Schools). One is the true form, FREE in that there are children/teens in a school who are welcome to come and go as they wish (for example, a school may be open from 9-5 every weekday and students can come all of the days, or none or for an hour, etc). The &#39;teachers&#39; are not there to teach, they are mainly to facilitate the child with what they want to know.  <br/>
The other form of the school is still considered Free but at some schools (maybe depending on state, I&#39;m uncertain) they are required to come to school everyday.<br/>
<br/>
Read the sites, they will give you more info than I could,<br/>
