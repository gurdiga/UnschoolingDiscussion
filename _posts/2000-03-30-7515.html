&lt;&lt; You may have a different dx, but <br/>
 it could also be treated well thru homeopathy if you are interested.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Thanks for your concern.  I have used homeopathy successfully for several <br/>
health issues in myself and my children.  I believe that it can be an <br/>
valuable part of our health care.  It is not a cure for my lupus.  This <br/>
disease did not begin as a result of emotional stress or trauma and <br/>
unfortunately it won&#39;t be cured by homeopathy.  I don&#39;t mean to sound too <br/>
prickly about it, but believe me - if it were that simple, I and many many <br/>
others with lupus and other serious conditions would all be well by now.   It <br/>
is hard for those of us with incurable illnesses to hear someone say that our <br/>
emotions brought it on and that there is an answer out there.  It makes our <br/>
suffering seem less valid.  I would not be surprised if homeopathy eased some <br/>
of the discomfort that many sufferers feel, however.  <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the kindness behind your post.<br/>
