<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207352037">I&#39;m finding it therapeudic.  It&#39;s been fun to go into each piece with no <br/>
plan and just let it happen.  The girls and I are talking about selling <br/>
them.  We&#39;re going to call our business &quot;The Fairy Ring.&quot;  I showed them <br/>
a circle of trees on my parents farm that I used to hang out in waiting <br/>
for the Faerie Queen.  It&#39;s one of their favorite places now.   HeidiC.<br/>

&gt;&gt;This is so cool!  I&#39;ve just started making beaded necklaces and rings <br/>
&gt;&gt;this week and it&#39;s all I can think about.  I started with the girls <br/>
&gt;&gt;craft bead kits and had to go buy my own.  Please do a workshop!  I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;&gt;almost really sure I&#39;m coming.  The main focus of my jewelry has been <br/>
&gt;&gt;the stones the girls are constantly finding, putting in their pockets, <br/>
&gt;&gt;and &quot;gifting&quot; to me in the laundry.  Simple driveway stones look <br/>
&gt;&gt;beautiful surrounded by wires and glass beads.  I&#39;ve worked on them till <br/>
&gt;&gt;1-2 in the morning and then dreamed of bowls of beads!   HeidiC.<br/>
