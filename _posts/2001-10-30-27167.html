&gt;Yep - you can go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holtgws.com">http://www.holtgws.com</a>  There is an order form<br/>
&gt;there, and also a 1-800 number to call.  I know it&#39;s true that the<br/>
&gt;old stuff is just as good...there&#39;s just something fulfilling in<br/>
&gt;seeing a new magazine in the mailbox.  I feel the same way about<br/>
&gt;Mothering magazine...sometimes it&#39;s the same stuff rehashed, but I<br/>
&gt;still feel support from seeing it in print.  On to HEM!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, Caren, thank you for the vote of confidence. That&#39;s what keeps us going.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll miss seeing GWS in the mailbox - it was somehow comforting to <br/>
know HEM wasn&#39;t the only homeschool magazine with a distinctly <br/>
unschooling slant. Now we&#39;re feeling somewhat alone and vulnerable, <br/>
wondering if the demise of our companion publication should be seen <br/>
as some kind of wake-up call or something. If they, with their <br/>
incredible legacy from John himself, couldn&#39;t make it, what&#39;s going <br/>
to keep HEM afloat?<br/>
<br/>
GWS had much more going for it than our little publication has. Not <br/>
just the long history and the still-tremendous name recognition of <br/>
John Holt, but GWS has been reviewed and praised by some of the top <br/>
mainstream media over the years. Pat Farenga, who took over when John <br/>
passed away in 1985, is a very popular conference speaker and a savvy <br/>
businessman. If he thinks it&#39;s time to quit fighting the good fight <br/>
what does that mean we should do?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be honest: I&#39;m concerned about many indicators. I&#39;m concerned <br/>
about the rapid growth of public school &quot;outreach&quot; programs <br/>
masquerading as some perversion of homeschooling (there&#39;s even one <br/>
right here in our hometown of Tonasket, run by a long-time family <br/>
friend - and no, I don&#39;t want to go into details...). I&#39;m concerned <br/>
about the proliferation of cyberschools and programs like Bennett&#39;s <br/>
K-12; I wonder how true friends of homeschooling like Pat <br/>
Montgomery&#39;s Clonlara School and the Williams&#39; Oak Meadow School are <br/>
faring in the wake of those newcomers. I&#39;m concerned about signs that <br/>
&quot;one right way&quot; to homeschool is being advocated by some pretty <br/>
strong forces with political clout... oldtimers and regular HEM <br/>
readers will know who I mean. I&#39;m not trying to be scary - I&#39;ll save <br/>
that for Halloween - but it worries me that so many people have been <br/>
so well prepared to change the face of homeschooling into something <br/>
unrecognizable to many of us.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m concerned about all the various ways homeschooling and <br/>
unschooling as we know it are being co-opted and changed and <br/>
reconfigured to suit a changing world... On the one hand I can see <br/>
and understand the natural progression of events (hindsight is always <br/>
20/20), while on the other hand I have to wonder what it all means, <br/>
and how we - as a fairly radical do-your-own-thing publication, fit <br/>
into the picture.<br/>
<br/>
Some days, when I&#39;m feeling less than optimistic, I worry about our <br/>
publishing future, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Helen --<br/>
<br/>
I believe that people in the public school homeschooly programs won&#39;t all stay<br/>
there forever.  Many of them will bust loose and become independent<br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Am I wrong?  Are local homeschooling groups seeing shrinkage?  I have heard,<br/>
from friends in Washington, that the programs offered are pretty appealing.<br/>
(Much better than some places that offer only &quot;school in a can&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
I know money is a lure keeping them &quot;in&quot;, but lack of information also keeps<br/>
some of them there.<br/>
<br/>
If it was feasible to donate one old copy of HEM to every public school<br/>
&quot;outreach&quot; program, maybe a few more people would jump the fence and bolt to<br/>
freedom.<br/>
<br/>
(Of course, I&#39;d like to see it in dentist&#39;s waiting rooms around the country,<br/>
too.)<br/>

almost nothing. Homeschooling groups in my home state (Alaska) are <br/>
almost non-existent due to a particularly aggressive and effective <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And at least some public system hs programs let families access the <br/>
&quot;goodies&quot; with less monitoring than some states require for independent <br/>
hs.  We&#39;ve been with a program in BC for 7 years now that requires only a <br/>
very brief report 3 times a year.  I&#39;m talking the , &quot;We had a conversation <br/>
about the immune system for science&quot; type of report.  Yes, it&#39;s a tiny bit <br/>
more than what I&#39;d have to do as a &quot;real&quot; hs in BC, which would be to just <br/>
register.  It&#39;s also less than *every* hs has to do in Alberta and some of <br/>
our other provinces.  And it&#39;s less than &quot;real&quot; hs in many states have to <br/>
do, even though they&#39;re labelled independent.  It takes me maybe an hour at <br/>
most.  I really don&#39;t mind paying for the computer and internet access plus <br/>
an extra $200 to spend on almost anything we want to with 3 hours of my <br/>
time each year.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t change *anything* about the way I homeschool in order to please <br/>
them.  There has been no problem at all with the fact that my son didn&#39;t <br/>
read until age 12 and still doesn&#39;t read well at 14.  The online teacher is <br/>
available to help if I want it, which I don&#39;t.  No problem.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m well aware of the antagonism many hs have toward public programs, but I <br/>
just don&#39;t see the problem.  Many people use them for a while, while they <br/>
get their bearings.  Many use them for the money or equipment they can <br/>
get.  I would hope that all, as I do, work toward keeping the laws for <br/>
&quot;real&quot; homeschoolers as unintrusive as possible, so that there will always <br/>
be that option to step back to.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most of the people using public hs programs in BC also join their local <br/>
group.  I know many of the families in our local hs group are using public <br/>
programs, either the one we use or the more intrusive correspondance course <br/>
the government provides.  We certainly make no distinction in our group <br/>
between those who use these programs and those who don&#39;t.  Some of the most <br/>
radical unschoolers in our group are using the one we&#39;re with.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I got a lot of calls from new and prospective hs when I was the <br/>
subscription person for our newsletter.  I always told them about all their <br/>
options, and the reasons they might want to choose one over the other for <br/>
their family.  I&#39;ve always been a believer in lots of educational options.<br/>

and conquer, so to speak.  All of those using the various ps options are<br/>
counted as ps students.  It doesn&#39;t make any difference if the only thing<br/>
they do is take the $$, they get counted as ps students.<br/>
<br/>
I am on the board for the local Title IX/JOM advisory committee and the<br/>
tracking also uses those figures when they get to college.<br/>
<br/>
they are now tracking the kids that are, at least in their parents minds,<br/>
homeschoolers and, guess who is doing better in college AND who are bringing<br/>
the numbers up for ps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-938125714">A lot of it starts with all the ideals being incorporated to make the<br/>
recipients happy.  Slowly, which the folks using the system don&#39;t notice,<br/>
they start turning the system back to where it was.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s take homebirthing.  They squaked and squaked about midwives and<br/>
homebirths.  So them they passed laws (spell that money and control) saying<br/>
how a midwife could be &quot;legal.&quot;  This usually means that the midwife has to<br/>
contract with and be supervised by an MD.  Then hospitals started building<br/>
midwife facilities.  Then they built birthingroom at hospitals.  Then the<br/>
hospitals decided that for &quot;safety&quot; and &quot;insurance&quot; reasons an MD would have<br/>
to supervise.  Now they are saying that only doctors can do the deliveries.<br/>
<br/>
Soooo, we are right back at square one which is an MD in charge in a<br/>
hospital.<br/>
<br/>
The same is happening with CA&#39;s charter laws.  Many years ago when places<br/>
such as Bennett Valley were just about the lonesome cowboys of charters out<br/>
there,  they gave each family a certain dollar amount to spend as they<br/>
pleased.  The families had full use of all school facilities and supplies.<br/>
If they wanted to use the school bus for field trips they could do that.  No<br/>
strings, no reporting, no requirements.<br/>

The current round of legislation wants to mandate that only a ps can have a<br/>
charter.  They also are working to require that charters comply with ALL the<br/>
same rules and paperwork requirements as &quot;traditional&quot; public schools.  That<br/>
means testing and it means that the ps that is the &quot;owner&quot; of the charter<br/>
will dictate curriculum and what text is used.  They are also working to<br/>
remove the charters from certain organizations because of the fraud that is<br/>
rampant in the outfits that have sprung up to &quot;manage&quot; charters.<br/>
<br/>
Slowly but surely the charters are becoming rigid and structured.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079273292">I see the gobbling up of homeschoolers too.  I think at least part of it<br/>
is that homeschoolers get so tired of being odd.  I hear that<br/>
homeschooling is more accepted these days but I personally haven&#39;t seen<br/>
it.  There are constant questions about socialization, qualifications,<br/>
curriculum.  Most of these questions asked because people don&#39;t know what<br/>
else to say, I suppose.  The quizzing of the kids,  &quot;what&#39;s bigger, a<br/>
quarter square mile, or a quarter mile square?&quot;   The pressure from<br/>
family and friends.  <br/>
If you&#39;re not really a person who enjoys life outside the mainstream, I<br/>
think it can just get tiring.  School programs take the heat off.  I&#39;ve<br/>
seen it happen around here.  The gobbling has begun.  <br/>
<br/>
And about hospitals offering birthing choices now; it&#39;s NOT the same as<br/>
home birth.<br/>
Hospitals do their very best to scare women into believing that<br/>
childbirth is an illness that needs special medical treatment.  They<br/>
offer these programs because they were afraid of loosing money, not<br/>
because of any great desire to serve the community, just like the<br/>
schools.  Women aren&#39;t respected, they told they can&#39;t possibly do it<br/>
alone.    I realize there are some pregnancies that do require medical<br/>
attention, but the real deal is a woman has to do the hard part all by<br/>
herself.  <br/>
My son was born at home in a cabin with no plumbing and no electricity in<br/>
Knik, Alaska.  It just made no sense to load up and drive all the way to<br/>
the hospital at Palmer, do all that work myself anyway, pay a huge bill<br/>
and come back home.  <br/>
It was so much simpler, and more comforting to just stay home.  <br/>
<br/>
We have made other choices that differ from the mainstream, and we&#39;re<br/>
comfortable with them and answering questions.  ( Who ever said there is<br/>
no such thing as a stupid question, never met some of these folks around<br/>
here )  But I can really understand how and why some families find an<br/>
easier way.  I don&#39;t like it, it does scare me, but I can see how it<br/>
happens. <br/>
<br/>
Deb L, who is against gobbling, and flag waving, and George Bush, and<br/>
Dang if I didn&#39;t miss that whole great discussion on Middle East<br/>
politics!   Oy.</div>

It&#39;s not the same as a home birth, but it&#39;s WAY less controlled and invasive <br/>
than births 20 years ago, and it was homebirth advocates (and just plain <br/>
healthy homebirths) and VBAC advocates who shook the hospitals loose from <br/>
some of their &quot;truths&quot; about what wasn&#39;t safe and what couldn&#39;t possibly be <br/>

<br/>
Same with unschooling and the dire predictions of &quot;if they don&#39;t read by 8&quot; <br/>
and &quot;they&#39;ll never learn times tables.&quot;  Those kinds of arguments will go the <br/>
way of &quot;you have to have an epidural&quot; and &quot;labor can&#39;t last more than 24 <br/>
hours.&quot;<br/>

Alternative schools are NOT homeschooling, but they&#39;re also not the <br/>
you-have-no-choice traditional classroom routine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-259615849">Helen,<br/>
<br/>
I discovered GWS shortly after starting homeschooling 15 years ago, and <br/>
it was a real lifeline at a time when there were very few homeschoolers <br/>
in the *whole* of New Zealand, let alone in my area. Many years later I <br/>
discovered HEM, and as time went by I found that I prefered your <br/>
magazine more and more, and found myself growing less happy with GWS. <br/>
After reading your post I thought a lot about it and wanted to share <br/>
with you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If they, with their<br/>
&gt; incredible legacy from John himself, couldn&#39;t make it, what&#39;s going<br/>
&gt; to keep HEM afloat?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GWS had much more going for it than our little publication has. Not<br/>
&gt; just the long history and the still-tremendous name recognition of<br/>
&gt; John Holt, but GWS has been reviewed and praised by some of the top<br/>
&gt; mainstream media over the years. Pat Farenga, who took over when John<br/>
&gt; passed away in 1985, is a very popular conference speaker and a savvy<br/>
&gt; businessman. If he thinks it&#39;s time to quit fighting the good fight<br/>
&gt; what does that mean we should do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It means you should keep going - please don&#39;t pull in the life line. <br/>
John Holt was a great and inspiring man but that&#39;s all he was. I <br/>
realised last night why I prefer HEM. GWS places its focus on the words <br/>
of people who don&#39;t homeschool their own children, or who didn&#39;t when <br/>
they started. The feature articles and interviews (apart from the focus) <br/>
are non homeschoolers. The &#39;guru&#39; of  GWS, John Holt, had no working <br/>
knowledge of living and loving and despairing and ailing and washing and <br/>
cleaning and cooking and staying up all night with children of his own, <br/>
24/7.  I have learnt so very much from John Holt and other observers, <br/>
but I love HEM and the way it recognises and values the *real* experts <br/>
in the homeschooling field - the parents themselves. GWS relegates <br/>
parents, I feel, to a secondary staus. Your magazine celebrates their <br/>
status as the more important. Last year, finances meant I had to chose <br/>
between HEM and GWS (the exchange rate makes the magazines terribly <br/>
expensive here) - and I chose HEM. Please keep it up.<br/>
<br/>
I do appreciate your fears about homeschooling, and see signs of similar <br/>
paths opening up here in New Zealand. It is scary that so few people <br/>
seem to suspect or even care that these paths might just (IMO &#39;will&#39;) <br/>
lead everyone back onto the main highway. I guess it&#39;s the price we pay <br/>
for homeschooling becoming so successful! It&#39;s a bit depressing to think <br/>
that after years of battling to get homeschooling / unschooling <br/>
accepted, we may find ourselves in the position of having to start to <br/>
battle all over. But it is worth it  - we just have to look at our <br/>
children and grandchildren and we know that, tiring though it may be at <br/>
times, it *is* worth putting in the energy. (Not that I can actually <br/>
look at my grandchild yet, as s/he won&#39;t be born until February!)<br/>
<br/>
Take heart, Helen, we&#39;ve done it once, we can do it again.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I dunno. We&#39;ve been with a charter, we&#39;ve been not with a charter.<br/>
Nothing changed for us, except that we got stuff and did more<br/>
documenting. We went to the same groups and activities, did the same<br/>
stuff, felt the same way. I don&#39;t feel odd, Cacie says she&#39;s weird but<br/>
considers that a good thing... if people asked us about homeschooling,<br/>
we&#39;d be pretty far into the conversation before the charter school thing<br/>
even came up. It just wasn&#39;t that important. The charter was fine when it<br/>
met our needs, and when it didn&#39;t, we left.<br/>
<br/>
I do think, though, that we need to have a whole range of educational<br/>
options, not just traditional school in one corner and independent<br/>
homeschooling off in another. I think there&#39;s room for charters, for<br/>
partial day programs, for 2 day a week programs, for drop-in programs...<br/>
a continuum, to serve every family. If all of the options are out there,<br/>
then people can chose freely.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And about hospitals offering birthing choices now; it&#39;s NOT the same <br/>

&gt; Hospitals do their very best to scare women into believing that<br/>
&gt; childbirth is an illness that needs special medical treatment.  They<br/>
&gt; offer these programs because they were afraid of loosing money, not<br/>
&gt; because of any great desire to serve the community, just like the<br/>
&gt; schools.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But there has been change, because people chose alternatives and than try<br/>
to get the system to provide them, and in many cases they succeed. When<br/>
my grandma gave birth to my dad, she was unconscious, flat on her back,<br/>
on a hospital. If women had insisted that homebirth with a midwife was<br/>
the only way to do things, than the thousands of women who may have<br/>
wanted something less drastic than what my grandma got but weren&#39;t<br/>
comfortable birthing outside of a hospital would have been out of luck.<br/>
Now we have a continuum of servies - while in the hospital you can have a<br/>
variety of medications, or no medications. You can go to a freestanding<br/>
birthing center and have a CNM attending - and have your insurance pay<br/>
for it. No we haven&#39;t gone all the way yet, but it&#39;s a lot better than it<br/>
was 60 years ago.  There are options, and people are becoming informed.<br/>
Insurance (often the gov&#39;t) now pays, in some cases, for a variety of<br/>
medical treatments that were once considered too unconventional. No one<br/>
ois forced to have thr traditional treatments or the non-traditional<br/>
ones, but poeple have options. Isn&#39;t having them pay for resources that<br/>
our children need to learn and grow a logical next step?<br/>

into homeschool friendly ps programs the *choice* becomes what the school<br/>
deems educational.  If this is what a family believes is best for them,<br/>
so be it, but I don&#39;t see how it helps homeschooling or homeschoolers.  I<br/>
don&#39;t see how in the long run it helps kids, because we are still left<br/>
with the notion that education is something someone else can give you,<br/>
must give you, for the good of society.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; luck.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My grandmother was a midwife and everyone of her children was born at<br/>
home, the last in 1940.   She could have gone to the hospital, if it had<br/>
been practical. She could have called the Dr. to her house.  Those were<br/>
all choices from the time her first child was born in 1917.  Birthing<br/>
choices vanished when hospitals saw how much money they could make if<br/>
they could convince (scare) women they needed all the bells and whistles.<br/>
<br/>
When my mother&#39;s children were born, the first in &#39; 47, the last in &#39; 63<br/>
the hospital experience was less than desirable, it&#39;s true.  Hospitals<br/>
may have been forced to change because people demanded it but I&#39;m not<br/>
convinced it&#39;s because they had any revelation about respecting peoples<br/>
choices, it was about money, again.  The different birthing choices now<br/>
are about money, and the more comfortable we get with them, the easier it<br/>
will be for them to convince us we need more and more of what they alone,<br/>
can provide.<br/>
<br/>
.&gt; Isn&#39;t having them pay for resources <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that<br/>
&gt; our children need to learn and grow a logical next step?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It would seem a logical next step as an educated population only benefits<br/>
society. <br/>
The problem comes from the government deciding what resources are<br/>
educational, and who is meeting the criteria. How much money is required<br/>
to meet the educational needs of a child?  Is it the same everywhere, for<br/>
every child?  When should the child start learning and when should they<br/>
be finished?  Are these questions best answered by our government?  I<br/>
don&#39;t personally think so. <br/>
And if we get comfortable letting them make a few of these choices now,<br/>
it only gives them the compliance they need to make more,  require more. <br/>
It used to be ok for kids to stay home, ( Ben Franklin,  Abe Lincoln )<br/>
then it was decided parents couldn&#39;t provide real education for their<br/>
kids.  Homeschoolers have made a lot of progress again since the &#39; 60&#39;s,<br/>
but charters, and ps programs seem to be saying, once again, that someone<br/>
else can do it better than parents can.  Call it choice if you want to, I<br/>
see it as insidious.  ( conspiracy! conspiracy!) <br/>
<br/>
I am all for choice, if it truly is our choice, if there are real<br/>
choices.  If I say to my child, you have two choices, you can go to<br/>
public school or you can sit down here and do this curriculum, is that<br/>
real choice?   If we get lulled into believing we have real choices now,<br/>
in governmental programs, I&#39;m afraid for the future of homeschooling.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s supposed to be what ALL homeschoolers are doing anyway.  The way state <br/>
laws are phrased, we&#39;re supposed to be teaching the (vague, but still) <br/>
equivalent of what the schools teach.  Even in Texas.  The kids are supposed <br/>
to be being educated, and the assumption is it will include all that <br/>
traditionally educational stuff.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I<br/>
don&#39;t see how in the long run it helps kids, because we are still left<br/>
with the notion that education is something someone else can give you,<br/>
must give you, for the good of society.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In the long run that assumption is so pervasive in our culture that <br/>
unschooled kids will spend their lifetimes looking into the cocked heads and <br/>
dazed eyes of people who ask them &quot;You didn&#39;t go to school and you didn&#39;t use <br/>
a curriculum?&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
We (culturally) will be left with that notion for another hundred years (more <br/>
if we&#39;re not lucky).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am all for choice, if it truly is our choice, if there are real<br/>
choices.  If I say to my child, you have two choices, you can go to<br/>
public school or you can sit down here and do this curriculum, is that<br/>
real choice?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well it&#39;s a huge choice for families who couldn&#39;t fathom, 20 years ago, that <br/>
school was in ANY way an option.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a big educational difference, but it is for some kids still <br/>
lifesaving because school itself was killing them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032143011">Wellll, I understood it and the bottomline is the bottomline--MONEY!<br/>
Hospitals didn&#39;t put in birthing rooms for mommies to be, they put in<br/>
birthing rooms to make money.  They didn&#39;t sit down and discuss how can we<br/>
make this a better experience for women, their families and that new bundle<br/>
of joy.  They sat down and discussed how to get those $$ back that were<br/>
leaving for the comfort of home.<br/>
<br/>
The same is true of the charters and satellite schools and ISPs and all the<br/>
other various and sundry names they operate under.  Charters have gone down<br/>
hill since Bennett Valley closed their&#39;s.  Each year or two they tighten up<br/>
the reins even more.<br/>
<br/>
But one of the things that is happening IMHO (o.k., wise guys, sometimes I<br/>
can be humble &lt;g&gt;) is that the definition of &quot;homeschooling&quot; and<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; is being diluted/changed/taken over by these programs.  Look<br/>
back at how it has changed.  Back in the 60s we knew what it meant.  The<br/>
government didn&#39;t define it except with words like radical, crazy, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this is a disclaimer.  PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY!  I am NOT talking<br/>
about anyone on this list, I am talking about the uninitiated, the folks<br/>
that don&#39;t head out on their own and actually experience &quot;real&quot;<br/>
un/homeschooling and don&#39;t make informed choices.<br/>
<br/>
IMNSHO the problem is those folks that make the decision to homeschool and<br/>
walk straight into a ps program because they think that is homeschooling<br/>
because it is becoming the accepted definition of homeschooling.  Am I clear<br/>
as mud on this?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I do think, though, that we need to have a whole range of<br/>
&gt; &gt; educational<br/>
&gt; &gt; options, not just traditional school in one corner and independent<br/>
&gt; &gt; homeschooling off in another.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A whole range of educational choices sounds great.  But the deeper we go<br/>
&gt; into homeschool friendly ps programs the *choice* becomes what the school<br/>
&gt; deems educational.  If this is what a family believes is best for them,<br/>
&gt; so be it, but I don&#39;t see how it helps homeschooling or homeschoolers.  I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t see how in the long run it helps kids, because we are still left<br/>
&gt; with the notion that education is something someone else can give you,<br/>
&gt; must give you, for the good of society.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But there has been change, because people chose alternatives and<br/>
&gt; &gt; than try<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get the system to provide them,  ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; . If women had insisted that home birth with a midwife<br/>
&gt; &gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; the only way to do things, than the thousands of women who may have<br/>
&gt; &gt; wanted something less drastic than what my grandma got but weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; comfortable birthing outside of a hospital would have been out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; luck.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My grandmother was a midwife and everyone of her children was born at<br/>
&gt; home, the last in 1940.   She could have gone to the hospital, if it had<br/>
&gt; been practical. She could have called the Dr. to her house.  Those were<br/>
&gt; all choices from the time her first child was born in 1917.  Birthing<br/>
&gt; choices vanished when hospitals saw how much money they could make if<br/>
&gt; they could convince (scare) women they needed all the bells and whistles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When my mother&#39;s children were born, the first in &#39; 47, the last in &#39; 63<br/>
&gt; the hospital experience was less than desirable, it&#39;s true.  Hospitals<br/>
&gt; may have been forced to change because people demanded it but I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; convinced it&#39;s because they had any revelation about respecting peoples<br/>
&gt; choices, it was about money, again.  The different birthing choices now<br/>
&gt; are about money, and the more comfortable we get with them, the easier it<br/>
&gt; will be for them to convince us we need more and more of what they alone,<br/>
&gt; can provide.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; .&gt; Isn&#39;t having them pay for resources<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; our children need to learn and grow a logical next step?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It would seem a logical next step as an educated population only benefits<br/>
&gt; society.<br/>
&gt; The problem comes from the government deciding what resources are<br/>
&gt; educational, and who is meeting the criteria. How much money is required<br/>
&gt; to meet the educational needs of a child?  Is it the same everywhere, for<br/>
&gt; every child?  When should the child start learning and when should they<br/>
&gt; be finished?  Are these questions best answered by our government?  I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t personally think so.<br/>
&gt; And if we get comfortable letting them make a few of these choices now,<br/>
&gt; it only gives them the compliance they need to make more,  require more.<br/>
&gt; It used to be ok for kids to stay home, ( Ben Franklin,  Abe Lincoln )<br/>
&gt; then it was decided parents couldn&#39;t provide real education for their<br/>
&gt; kids.  Homeschoolers have made a lot of progress again since the &#39; 60&#39;s,<br/>
&gt; but charters, and ps programs seem to be saying, once again, that someone<br/>
&gt; else can do it better than parents can.  Call it choice if you want to, I<br/>
&gt; see it as insidious.  ( conspiracy! conspiracy!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am all for choice, if it truly is our choice, if there are real<br/>
&gt; choices.  If I say to my child, you have two choices, you can go to<br/>
&gt; public school or you can sit down here and do this curriculum, is that<br/>
&gt; real choice?   If we get lulled into believing we have real choices now,<br/>
&gt; in governmental programs, I&#39;m afraid for the future of homeschooling.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; deems educational.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A lot really depends on the program. Some of the people running these<br/>
programs are truly unschoolers at heart. I did work for a program that<br/>
started out good and went downhill (we had a big thread on this about 6<br/>
weeks ago, as I recall) and I spent a lot of  time convincing people that<br/>
they were doing great stuff already and their kids were learning and they<br/>
didn&#39;t need to stress out about it and throw workbooks at them.  We would<br/>
chat for a while, and people would talk about everything they had been<br/>
doing naturally, and I would point out how much the kids were learning<br/>
through all of this, and many people would be surprised and feel much<br/>
more confident. With the more experienced hsers it wasn&#39;t so much an<br/>
issue, but a lot of the newer people seemed to need to hear this so that<br/>
they could relax. Obviously the charter wasn&#39;t the only way it could have<br/>
happened - I&#39;ve had similar conversations at park days or on email lists<br/>
- but it was a venue.<br/>
<br/>
I also got to wear I could find a California State Standard to apply to<br/>
pretty much anything a kid had done, which was always impressive. Not<br/>
that I think the standards are worth much, but I think it helped some<br/>
people to see that there really wasn&#39;t anything magical about the schools<br/>
and their curriculums<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know anyone who thinks this way. The notion is that learning<br/>
doesn&#39;t take place in a vacuum, you can&#39;t just sit in an empty room alone<br/>
and learn much. The charters, when they were at their best, provided<br/>
resources specific to what each specific child needed at that moment. The<br/>
charter paid for Calvin and Hobbes books, watercolors and watercolor<br/>
paper, owl pellets, American Girls paper dolls, tie dye kits, games...<br/>
the list was pretty long and varied. I think there&#39;s a big difference<br/>
between saying, &quot;Here is your edication&quot; and &quot;Here are some things you<br/>
were wanting to have so that you can continue your process.&quot;<br/>

 <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t personally think so. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But they&#39;re not answering these questions,  they&#39;re offering options.<br/>
Although technically they already have made these decisions - every state<br/>
has laws on the book covering what a child should learn.  Your arguments<br/>
all rest on the premise that these programs are somehow mandatory, that<br/>
people don&#39;t just have the freedom to up and walk away.  They do. Oak<br/>
Meadow is out there, and Laurel Springs, and Clonlara, and many other<br/>
options. Why are they not a threat if charter schools are?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in governmental programs, I&#39;m afraid for the future of <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But that&#39;s not a real choice, and that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening anywhere<br/>
now. We have real choice when we look  both within and without government<br/>
programs.  It&#39;s like food stamps, or medicaid, or public housing, or<br/>
WIC... any of a myraid of public programs. If you decide that you want to<br/>
enroll, you can, but no one forces you to do so.<br/>

&gt;partial day programs, for 2 day a week programs, for drop-in programs...<br/>
&gt;a continuum, to serve every family. If all of the options are out there,<br/>
&gt;then people can chose freely.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Soon after the Electronic Bus got started in BC, the BC Home Learners <br/>
Association (BCHLA) got their knickers in a knot about how these programs <br/>
were going to grab all the homeschoolers in the province and the government <br/>
was going to think that we all wanted this kind of &quot;guidance&quot; and make it <br/>
mandatory.  Or change the laws to require more monitoring, etc.  They <br/>
started on a bit of a campaign to try to scare hs away from the <br/>
programs.  They said we weren&#39;t really homeschoolers, etc. etc.  I think <br/>
the net result of that was to turn a lot of hs away from BCHLA, including me.<br/>
<br/>
The leadership has since changed, and the current leaders are a bit more <br/>
open-minded about the subject.  They still have fears, and they voice them, <br/>
but it seems they&#39;ve learned that the way to go is to get the hs who are <br/>
using those programs onside with the provincial group, rather than <br/>
alienating them by saying that they aren&#39;t &quot;real&quot; homeschoolers.  It is <br/>
true that we are not considered hs by the province.  I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s <br/>
patooty what the province calls me.  I know what I am.  Now that BCHLA is <br/>
willing to consider that I really am a hs, no matter what the province <br/>
calls me, I&#39;m backing BCHLA in their work to keep the hs laws as they <br/>
are.  You see, I want to be sure there&#39;s someplace to stand if I ever <br/>
decide to get off the bus.  It&#39;s still all about choices, and I think there <br/>
should be more than 3 (public school, private school, &quot;pure&#39; homeschooling).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; And about hospitals offering birthing choices now; it&#39;s NOT the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; as home birth.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hospitals do their very best to scare women into believing that<br/>
&gt; &gt; childbirth is an illness that needs special medical treatment.  They<br/>
&gt; &gt; offer these programs because they were afraid of loosing money, not<br/>
&gt; &gt; because of any great desire to serve the community, just like the<br/>
&gt; &gt; schools.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In BC, the hospitals have changed a lot over the years and do a pretty <br/>
decent  job now of serving the women who choose to use them for birth.  (I <br/>
had a good experience there with my youngest.  Of course we left 2 hours <br/>
after he was born.)<br/>
<br/>
We also now have licensed midwives who can attend home *or* hospital <br/>
births, and they&#39;re paid for by our provincial medical plan, just like <br/>
doctors.  I tell any pregnant woman who will listen that she can have a <br/>
midwife at the hospital and will get far better care that way.  Most women <br/>
still believe they can only have a midwife at a homebirth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Now we have a continuum of servies - while in the hospital you can have a<br/>
&gt;variety of medications, or no medications. You can go to a freestanding<br/>
&gt;birthing center and have a CNM attending - and have your insurance pay<br/>
&gt;for it. No we haven&#39;t gone all the way yet, but it&#39;s a lot better than it<br/>
&gt;was 60 years ago.  There are options, and people are becoming informed.<br/>
&gt;Insurance (often the gov&#39;t) now pays, in some cases, for a variety of<br/>
&gt;medical treatments that were once considered too unconventional. No one<br/>
&gt;ois forced to have thr traditional treatments or the non-traditional<br/>
&gt;ones, but poeple have options. Isn&#39;t having them pay for resources that<br/>
&gt;our children need to learn and grow a logical next step?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, it&#39;s all about choices, the more the merrier, in my opinion.<br/>

But they find out pretty soon, IF the are looking around and listening, that <br/>
that&#39;s not what homeschooling is.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a school program here that originally billed itself as &quot;halftime <br/>
homeschool&quot; but it wasn&#39;t, and they&#39;ve shut up about that.  It&#39;s halftime <br/>
REAL school (albeit alternative methods, some of which are very cool), and <br/>
halftime  homework assigned by the school that parents have to oversee, chart <br/>
and report back about PLUS parents have to go to at least one meeting a week <br/>
all year, nighttime.  <br/>
<br/>
And because they run a morning session and afternoon session with an hour in <br/>
the middle of overlap (so the kids can get to know those from the other <br/>
session, they say, and there is some truth to it), they can double dip--every <br/>
kid earns them full funding.<br/>
<br/>
Tadaa!!!<br/>
<br/>
Is it homeschooling?<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
Is it hurting homeschooling?<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
If I were making a commission on every kid who didn&#39;t go to school and didn&#39;t <br/>
use a curriculum, I&#39;d be losing some money! &lt;g&gt;  But whether it&#39;s hurting the <br/>
families or the freedom to homeschool, no.  IF they had kept for ten years <br/>
calling it homeschooling, yes, it would have been muddying the waters.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wonder if you might be lumping all of these kinds of programs together <br/>
and judging them by what you know about one or a few.  Or maybe they&#39;re <br/>
just a lot different in the States, or even your state.  I can only talk <br/>
about my experience with the programs in BC.  The program we use does not <br/>
dictate what a child learns, or when they have to learn it.  We are <br/>
required to send in reports 3 times a year that show what our kids are <br/>
learning within the BC curriculum.  It doesn&#39;t mean they have to learn the <br/>
same things at the same time as the ps kids.  It just means that we have to <br/>
show that they are learning something from somewhere in the <br/>
curriculum.  It&#39;s true that they seem to tighten up the requirements at the <br/>
high school level, but even then there are ways around it.  My son is 14, <br/>
and I&#39;m still sending in anecdotal reports saying that we&#39;ve read this and <br/>
that book together and had these conversations about these subjects, <br/>
etc.  In other words, my family makes all the choices, not the program.  We <br/>
only report on the choices we&#39;ve made.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; I<br/>
 &gt;don&#39;t see how in the long run it helps kids, because we are still left<br/>
 &gt;with the notion that education is something someone else can give you,<br/>
 &gt;must give you, for the good of society.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not really an argument against public programs.  I know that in BC, <br/>
we still are required to &quot;provide an educational program&quot; for our kids, <br/>
even if we are &quot;real&quot; homeschoolers.  I can&#39;t imagine ever getting that <br/>
changed.  At least here, the parents get to decide what constitutes an <br/>
educational program.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;When my mother&#39;s children were born, the first in &#39; 47, the last in &#39; 63<br/>
&gt;the hospital experience was less than desirable, it&#39;s true.  Hospitals<br/>
&gt;may have been forced to change because people demanded it but I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt;convinced it&#39;s because they had any revelation about respecting peoples<br/>
&gt;choices, it was about money, again.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re ever going to get governments or big businesses to <br/>
respect people&#39;s choices.  We&#39;ve always had to vote with our <br/>
pocketbooks.  I don&#39;t believe it matters that much how we got the <br/>
choices.  The important thing is to have them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The different birthing choices now<br/>
&gt;are about money, and the more comfortable we get with them, the easier it<br/>
&gt;will be for them to convince us we need more and more of what they alone,<br/>
&gt;can provide.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then it all boils down to education, once again.  Pregnant women need to be <br/>
educated as to the choices available (and the ones that aren&#39;t yet <br/>
available, as well) and parents need to be educated about choices in <br/>
education.<br/>
<br/>
The main reason most people send their kids to public school is that they <br/>
really don&#39;t know of any other possibilities, or they&#39;re convinced that <br/>
those possibilities wouldn&#39;t work for them.  So if a parent who isn&#39;t happy <br/>
with the public schools finds out about one of the public school hs <br/>
programs and tries it, that&#39;s a first step  They should somehow be informed <br/>
of the organizations that are out there to help them *in addition to* that <br/>
public program.  The fact that they would then be supporting an <br/>
organization that is working to keep their other choices open would be a bonus.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;.&gt; Isn&#39;t having them pay for resources<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; our children need to learn and grow a logical next step?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It would seem a logical next step as an educated population only benefits<br/>
&gt;society.<br/>
&gt;The problem comes from the government deciding what resources are<br/>
&gt;educational, and who is meeting the criteria.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In its eighth year now, the program we&#39;re on will pay for anything even <br/>
remotely educational with our resource allowance.  I&#39;ve had sports and <br/>
scouts registration  fees and the non-resident library card fee <br/>
paid.  They&#39;ve paid for 2 printers, a cd burner, and a scanner.  Oh and <br/>
they&#39;ve bought books as well.  The only things they won&#39;t pay for are <br/>
religious materials because they&#39;re publicly funded, and the actual <br/>
equipment for sports, etc.  (They&#39;ll pay for skating lessons but not <br/>
skates, for instance.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How much money is required<br/>
&gt;to meet the educational needs of a child?  Is it the same everywhere, for<br/>
&gt;every child?  When should the child start learning and when should they<br/>
&gt;be finished?  Are these questions best answered by our government?  I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t personally think so.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So as long as you have the option to keep the government from making these <br/>
decisions for *your* child, isn&#39;t that good enough?  Can we not simply work <br/>
to keep choices available that will allow the parents who want to make <br/>
these decisions to do so?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And if we get comfortable letting them make a few of these choices now,<br/>
&gt;it only gives them the compliance they need to make more,  require more.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For at least a hundred years, government has been making these <br/>
choices.  Homeschoolers have gradually insisted on the right to make them <br/>
for themselves.  This is what we need to focus on.  As long as we can keep <br/>
on making these decisions ourselves if we choose to, what difference does <br/>
it make that some will allow others to make them.  Public school parents <br/>
have been allowing that for years.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It used to be ok for kids to stay home, ( Ben Franklin,  Abe Lincoln )<br/>
&gt;then it was decided parents couldn&#39;t provide real education for their<br/>
&gt;kids.  Homeschoolers have made a lot of progress again since the &#39; 60&#39;s,<br/>
&gt;but charters, and ps programs seem to be saying, once again, that someone<br/>
&gt;else can do it better than parents can.  Call it choice if you want to, I<br/>
&gt;see it as insidious.  ( conspiracy! conspiracy!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So it&#39;s ok for the &quot;real&quot; homeschoolers to be working to limit *my* <br/>
choices?  You&#39;re still lumping all public programs together and assuming <br/>
that they are making all the choices for the parents involved.  While this <br/>
may be true in some programs, it isn&#39;t for all of them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am all for choice, if it truly is our choice, if there are real<br/>
&gt;choices.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So work to keep the choices open, not shut down the ones you don&#39;t believe in.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If I say to my child, you have two choices, you can go to<br/>
&gt;public school or you can sit down here and do this curriculum, is that<br/>
&gt;real choice?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course not.  You&#39;re leaving out quite a few options.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If we get lulled into believing we have real choices now,<br/>
&gt;in governmental programs, I&#39;m afraid for the future of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, homeschoolers of all stripes have real choices in BC.  And I&#39;m <br/>
working to keep it that way.<br/>

&gt;IMNSHO the problem is those folks that make the decision to homeschool and<br/>

&gt;because it is becoming the accepted definition of homeschooling.  Am I clear<br/>
&gt;as mud on this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But how do you explain the many people in BC who start out with the <br/>
government correspondance course and chuck it after a year or two (or even <br/>
a couple of months) because they realize they can do it just as well <br/>
without them.  If they hadn&#39;t had the correspondance option to start with, <br/>
their kids would likely still be in school.  Same thing happens with the <br/>
Electronic Bus.  Usually people start with it for one of two <br/>
reasons.  1.  They want the computer and money.  2.  They don&#39;t believe <br/>
that they can do it alone.<br/>
<br/>
Now the Electronic Bus may be unique because they *expect* parents to do it <br/>
on their own.  The teachers are there to offer assistance when it&#39;s wanted, <br/>
but the vast majority of them encourage parents to find their own way as <br/>
much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Both families 1 and 2 might leave after a while.  Family 1 might leave when <br/>
they can get their own computer.  Family 2 might leave when they realize <br/>
that they *can* do it themselves.  Or they might stay, but they&#39;re all <br/>
still the ones in charge of their homeschooling &quot;program&quot;.  Maybe there <br/>
aren&#39;t any similar programs in the States?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Count me as one, Helen. The parrallels between the home birth <br/>
communitie and the home ed community are tremendous. As the hospitals <br/>
and professionals took on &quot;home-like&quot; settings and twisted ideas into <br/>
their own, fewer home birth advocates were willing to &quot;fight the <br/>
fight&quot;. Its tiring to go against the flow all the time and some folks <br/>
are really just looking for when they can go back to an easier way <br/>
without having to forego all of their views, thus, homelike hospital <br/>
births and government homeschooling programs. Oxymorons to me, but to <br/>
others, an answer to walking against the wind.<br/>
<br/>
In some part, I think economics are affecting us, but also, the <br/>
downside of a natural inflation/deflation progression. The home ed <br/>
community was on a rapid increase through much of the 90&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
It still worries me in some ways. In others, I think we&#39;ll just melt <br/>
back down to a core group and move forward. Not sure yet.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree!  I just question whether parents will find education about all<br/>
the other choices at a ps homeschool program.  I think they may very well<br/>
be told they&#39;ve been informed though.<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s what concerns me.  Some nut decides it&#39;s just too terrible that<br/>
there is no oversight of &quot;these homeschools&quot;.  But look here! <br/>
Homeschoolers have been happy with charters and ps programs and<br/>
alternative schools, no complaints about reporting, or whatever.  Let&#39;s<br/>
just make it a law that kids can&#39;t be homeschooled except through one of<br/>
these handy little facilities.  Down the road a piece we can test all the<br/>
kids and see how they&#39;re doing and then if it&#39;s necessary, we can require<br/>
this or that and it&#39;s still just like homeschooling except that we know<br/>
what&#39;s really going on.  <br/>
<br/>
Am I paranoid?  ( or perceptive? &lt;g&gt; )  Am I an alarmist? ( or Chicken<br/>
Little?)  <br/>
you don&#39;t really have to answer.<br/>
<br/>
I  think you have every right to make your own choices.  I have agonized<br/>
over my own, as parents do.  You show me your ulcer, I&#39;ll show you mine.<br/>
