fallacies regarding unschoolers.  i see her as the &#39;rush limbaugh&#39; of hsers -<br/>
she&#39;s a verbal bully.   there&#39;s no point of discussing it with her because<br/>
it&#39;s her way or forget it.  she blinded by her own opinion and regards it as<br/>
truth.   i&#39;ve not met her just had a brief conversation w her online in our<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m probably late on this thread but I&#39;m enjoying it!<br/>
<br/>
Hafidha wrote (very patiently I thought): &quot;By lazy I mean the inclination to<br/>
be inert.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If one needs a definition of lazy, I have never seen a better one! This made<br/>
me laugh out loud!<br/>
<br/>
Carry on...<br/>

&gt; hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i read this book last fall.  i enjoyed it and felt it was a good<br/>
&gt; portrayal of one family&#39;s approach to opening up a vast world for a<br/>
&gt; child by following her lead.  but would have loved to read more about<br/>
&gt; your younger daughter (and your wife) and her learning experiences<br/>
&gt; because it would shown a more diverse picture since their styles and<br/>
&gt; approaches seem so different.<br/>
<br/>
Dear Susan --<br/>
<br/>
I would have loved to have written more about Meera as well, but felt it<br/>
was more important to end at Aliyah&#39;s 10th birthday (for reasons I state<br/>
in Skylark).  Meera, by the way, is doing just fine!  She is an<br/>
extremely talented gymnast (spends about 20 hours a week at the gym),<br/>
has taught herself to play the flute at an extremely high level, is<br/>
currently working her way through Mozart&#39;s 23rd Piano Concerto, and<br/>
occasionally (though only occasionally) opens a book.  She reads well!<br/>
it&#39;s just that she has decided she has better things to do with her<br/>
time!<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning of the year, Meera started taking band with the local<br/>
5th grade.  About the 5th week in, the teacher decided she should teach<br/>
the other kids (she herself had never had even a single lesson) -- well,<br/>
we didn&#39;t allow this to go on very long, got her moved to 6th grade<br/>
band, where she is bored, and stays in with promises that she&#39;ll be in<br/>
the 8th grade band next year.  (she&#39;s only 9)  Meanwhile, she may have<br/>
been the only kid in Washington state enrolled in recess! Recess<br/>
followed band, and she wanted to go to the schoolyard with her friends,<br/>
so they made us enroll her (allows the school district to capture<br/>
revenue! and they think it helps them with liability, though I can&#39;t<br/>
figure out how.)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, my younger is very different from my older one, but the way we go<br/>
about meeting her learning aspirations does not differ in any<br/>
substantive way.  My wife no longer delivers newspapers (she&#39;s still a<br/>
massage therapist) -- she now cares intermittently for Alzheimer&#39;s<br/>
patients in their homes, and has lots of fascinating information to<br/>
bring home!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; overall i felt it was honest and fascinating, especially your ability<br/>
&gt; to utilizes your community because this is an area i am very weak<br/>
&gt; at.   but when you have a child whose interests lay well outside your<br/>
&gt; own, in your case music and in mine robotics, looking toward the<br/>
&gt; community would be the next logically step.  i think you covered the<br/>
&gt; &#39;how to&#39; part very well and you showed just how exciting life can be<br/>
&gt; when a family embrace learning as a lifestyle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  You&#39;ll find a new interview with me on related subjects in the<br/>
May/June Growing Without Schooling -- and Meera is on the cover!<br/>

about aliyah&#39;s b-day, it makes sense and imo the book didn&#39;t lose anything<br/>
by this.  i guess because my son is only 4 those early years, which meera<br/>
was in during much of the book, are still very fascinating.  thanks again.<br/>
i  look forward to the new gws mag.<br/>

Subject: Need Help: Diversity in Homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
I received a call this afternoon from a reporter working on an article for<br/>
a professional magazine in the Washington, DC area. She&#39;s trying to<br/>
determine if there are any statistics available on the racial/ethnic<br/>
diversity of homeschooling families. Anyone know any resources, articles,<br/>
or websites I could send her to? Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

You talk of patience:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hafidha wrote (very patiently I thought): &quot;By lazy I mean the inclination<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; be inert.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If one needs a definition of lazy, I have never seen a better one! This<br/>
made<br/>
&gt; me laugh out loud!<br/>
<br/>
I think &#39;patiently&#39; refers better to the parent who allows his / her child<br/>
the<br/>
space to come to activity on their own. I have never seen an unschooled<br/>
child<br/>
(and rarely a schooled child) who has an &#39;inclination to be inert&#39;. This<br/>
description would only apply to a child who had had all initiative beaten<br/>
out of<br/>
them (literally or figuratively) by adults. Non-action is not necessarily<br/>
inertness or laziness. Some people are thinkers, and some take a lot longer<br/>
to<br/>
get through thinking. I don&#39;t believe it is possible to know what is<br/>
happenning<br/>
inside someone else&#39;s head. You ask a kid &#39;what are you thinking about?&#39; and<br/>
s/he answers &#39;nothing&#39;, you may think s/he is being lazy or inert, I would<br/>
assume that they didn&#39;t want to talk to me about it.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, a &#39;bored&#39; child left alone to be bored (still talk to them<br/>
but<br/>
don&#39;t nag), trusted to come through, will eventually burst forth in activity<br/>
and<br/>
creativity, often into a totally new interest.<br/>
<br/>
IMO it is, yet again, a matter of trusting our children - and being able to<br/>
keep<br/>
trusting, sometimes for a looong time.<br/>

Hahahaha!!  I went to a LLL District Conference recently, where I<br/>
&#39;networked,&#39; as one does, as is a functon of such events.  The following<br/>
weekend we happened to be in the neighbourhood (within 5 miles) of someone<br/>
I&#39;d got chatting with, so we dropped in for a visit.  Her 18yo daughter<br/>
arrived from minding their shop and discovered it was brown rice for tea.<br/>
&#39;La Leche League Food!&#39; she exclaimed.  We then made a big list of the<br/>
League stereotypes, can&#39;t remember them now cos I&#39;m tired, but it&#39;s so<br/>
familiar, anyone seen to be on the fringe gets tarred with the same brush.<br/>
And actually, I wear sandals, in Summer, but I love steak and chips.  I love<br/>
reading, but we have a big tv with dolby sound system, specialist hi-fi with<br/>
vinyl collection intact and two computers, one with Internet connection.<br/>
Oh, the conflicts!  This family can&#39;t possibly be doing something as radical<br/>
as unschooling!!<br/>

Subject: Re: &#39;shyness&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Hello and goodbye!<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say a few words on shyness from the perspective of a<br/>
British Columbia developmental psychologist Gordon Neufeld.  He believes<br/>
shyness is a positive naturally occurring quality in children which is<br/>
instinctive and promotes attachment of children to their parents.  He<br/>
recognizes that there are large variances of shyness but he sees it as<br/>
an important force for focusing children on the people who care about<br/>
them.  It is not a problem per se.  Very shy children have high<br/>
attachment needs which need to be met.  I have stopped (mostly)<br/>
&quot;encouraging&quot; my children to be &quot;independent&quot;.  You can&#39;t stop<br/>
independence when they are ready for it which occurs much later than<br/>
most people think.  Late adolescence is the time for the natural<br/>
emergence of true independence.  Independence is forced on children<br/>
entirely too early which results not in independence but &quot;peer<br/>
identified&quot; children with displaced dependence on their peers who are<br/>
ill equipped to meet their real needs.<br/>
<br/>
I was subscribed to this list many months ago but unsubscribed because<br/>
my family needed my time more than I needed this list.  I really like it<br/>
but I can see that I will need to unsubcribe again.  I just can&#39;t master<br/>
the delete key in the way I need to.   The topics are too interesting<br/>
and I agree and disagree with people so intensely.  I have a lot of<br/>
experience and ideas to offer but sadly don&#39;t have the time.<br/>
<br/>
I would encourage everyone to email Oprah&#39;s website and let them know<br/>
just how big and varied unschooling and homeschooling are.  Oprah is<br/>
just mesmerized by schools and teachers.  She needs lots of<br/>
encouragement to do the topic real justice.  So let&#39;s try for an email a<br/>
week to Oprah for... say three weeks..... psst! Pass it On!<br/>
<br/>
I am leaving this list forthwith.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t like the term &#39;shy&#39; because there&#39;s a sense of there being<br/>
&gt; something<br/>
&gt; wrong with the child, when the only thing wrong is assuming all people<br/>
&gt; should<br/>
&gt; be equally comfortable with strangers and large groups.  OTOH, if I<br/>
&gt; think of<br/>
&gt; &#39;skills&#39; rather than &#39;something&#39;s wrong with the child&#39;, then I can<br/>
&gt; focus on<br/>
&gt; easy ways to learn those skills, rather than forcing my child to act<br/>
&gt; extroverted when in fact she&#39;s an introvert.  My focus would be in<br/>
&gt; helping<br/>

Subject: Re: unschooling fallicies?<br/>
<br/>
This is what I posted as a comment to a lengthy discussion on<br/>
intellectualcapital.com about schools, schooling and teachers:<br/>
<br/>
{ This discussion (the one on intellectualcapital.com) is truly like<br/>
discussing astrology or phrenology. A great raft of accepted notions<br/>
which have ZERO validity are bandied about with much quoting of<br/>
statistics.<br/>
<br/>
The EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES! &quot;Education&quot; is about making money, enforcing<br/>
values, stifling questioning, ensuring conformity, destroying the<br/>
inherent love of learning, detaching children from their families,<br/>
insuring that armies have willing solidiers, protecting the power of the<br/>
powerful. To silently witness this discussion is like being ensnared in<br/>
a nightmare/dream. Schooling is little better than wholesale<br/>
incarceration of the young.<br/>
<br/>
Each day of freedom is bright with promise. Boredom when you are free is<br/>
the matrix of creativity. When you are imprisoned boredom is the<br/>
cauldron in which cruelty boils. Schools are rife with bullies because<br/>
they are run by well-meaning bullies who are oblivious to the fact that<br/>
their function is to bully. Just as in a prison, the powerful control<br/>
the less powerful right down the line.<br/>
<br/>
I know that people may have good intentions but I just can&#39;t stand the<br/>
hollowness of this discussion. I know that iconoclasm is only popular if<br/>
it is not your icon being thwacked. }<br/>
<br/>
I post this here because arguing with a schooled, schooling teacher is<br/>
maddening to say the least.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; here&#39;s a website that really annoyed me because it passes opinion off<br/>
&gt; as fact.  i think it will provide you with lots of &#39;fallacies&#39;.  the<br/>
&gt; author happens to be on our local list and i had a very brief<br/>
&gt; interaction but quickly realized (and was advised) it was a waste of<br/>
&gt; time because she needed to defending &#39;teaching&#39; by attacking<br/>
&gt; unschooling.  imo this is a really silly thing to do.  anyway here are<br/>
&gt; some excerpts and links to check out for yourself:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1)   Unschooling in Theory ...<br/>
&gt; John Holt&#39;s philosophy of unschooling is based on a false premise: the<br/>
&gt; premise that ideas are innate. His radical position is that children<br/>
&gt; automatically know how and what to learn, that they&#39;re born with the<br/>
&gt; knowledge of how to get nonsense.  The proper methods of developing<br/>
&gt; one&#39;s own intellect have to be learned just like any other knowledge,<br/>
&gt; and having a teacher to guide the process is of significant value.<br/>
&gt; (See Objective Approach.) A parent who insists that a child must lead<br/>
&gt; his own education places an undue burden upon his young shoulders.<br/>
&gt; Children do not yet have a broad enough context to see how knowledge<br/>
&gt; fits together; they don&#39;t mysteriously &quot;know&quot; what they can&#39;t possibly<br/>
&gt; know.   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hometaught.com/app_unschooling.htm">http://www.hometaught.com/app_unschooling.htm</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; imo:  the burden, placed on children, of parents who lack faith in a<br/>
&gt; child&#39;s ability and desires is the true burden.   and the fallacy is<br/>
&gt; that unschooling parent don&#39;t facilitate the &#39;fitting together of<br/>
&gt; knowledge&#39;.  which leads to the denial that children question the<br/>
&gt; world around them and that these questions led to the experience of<br/>
&gt; &#39;how knowledge fits together&#39; and these experiences, if not discovery<br/>
&gt; naturally but the child, are provided and facilitated by the parents.<br/>
&gt; unschooling parents and their children choose a lifestyle of learning<br/>
&gt; and thereby don&#39;t make a distinction between life and teaching.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  2)   Unschooling is:  Anti-schooling...<br/>
&gt; John Holt&#39;s advice to unschooling parents from Teach Your Own (p. 229)<br/>
&gt; sums up his theory in practice:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I say, above all else, don&#39;t let your home become [a] miniature copy<br/>
&gt; of the school. No lesson plans! No quizzes! No tests! No report cards!<br/>
&gt; Even leaving your children alone would be better; at least they could<br/>
&gt; figure out some things on their<br/>
&gt; own. Live together, as well as you can; enjoy life together, as much<br/>
&gt; as you can.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In other words, let the child be responsible for his own education.<br/>
&gt; You parents don&#39;t have to do anything-don&#39;t plan a curriculum, don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; try to evaluate your child&#39;s progress, don&#39;t try to teach him. Just<br/>
&gt; leave him alone to learn from life.<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hometaught.com/john_holt.htm">http://www.hometaught.com/john_holt.htm</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; imo: i don&#39;t know how you can &#39;live together&#39; and then &#39;leave your<br/>
&gt; [kids} alone&#39;.  and the point that life-learners are people who have<br/>
&gt; developed the skills of self-motivation and curiosity is completely<br/>
&gt; lost in this &#39;interpretation&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; overall this author exhibits a need, for whatever reason, to have<br/>
&gt; control over her children and their learning process, yet is not<br/>
&gt; secure enough in this position to just do it, but must support the<br/>
&gt; position by negating the possibility that there is a way where a child<br/>
&gt; can learn and not be controlled.  imo we as parents need faith in<br/>
&gt; ourselves as well as our children and this is perhaps the toughest<br/>
&gt; hurdle presented by unschooling - obviously this author was unable to<br/>
&gt; make this &#39;leap of faith&#39; and perhaps should follow a different<br/>
&gt; philosophy.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hello and goodbye!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just wanted to say a few words on shyness from the perspective of a<br/>
&gt; British Columbia developmental psychologist Gordon Neufeld.  He<br/>
&gt; believes shyness is a positive naturally occurring quality in children<br/>
&gt; which is instinctive and promotes attachment of children to their<br/>
&gt; parents.  He recognizes that there are large variances of shyness but<br/>
&gt; he sees it as an important force for focusing children on the people<br/>
&gt; who care about them.  It is not a problem per se.  Very shy children<br/>
&gt; have high attachment needs which need to be met.  I have stopped<br/>
&gt; (mostly) &quot;encouraging&quot; my children to be &quot;independent&quot;.  You can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; stop independence when they are ready for it which occurs much later<br/>
&gt; than most people think.  Late adolescence is the time for the natural<br/>
&gt; emergence of true independence.  Independence is forced on children<br/>
&gt; entirely too early which results not in independence but &quot;peer<br/>
&gt; identified&quot; children with displaced dependence on their peers who are<br/>
&gt; ill equipped to meet their real needs.<br/>
<br/>
when i was growing up i would have glued myself to my mom if i could<br/>
have and was more attached to her that any of my 4 siblings but moved<br/>
away from home at 17 and have only been back for visits and a few months<br/>
during my 20&#39;s.  not so for my siblings (one is still living there and<br/>
the other have lived there at least 3 yrs)  i&#39;m by far the most<br/>
independent and rarely went out during my teen years - i just was<br/>
interested in it.  so this is to say i completely agree with this<br/>
statement.  the negative view of loners really annoys me i just don&#39;t<br/>
enjoy being so stimulated all the time just once in awhile.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I was subscribed to this list many months ago but unsubscribed because<br/>
&gt; my family needed my time more than I needed this list.  I really like<br/>
&gt; it but I can see that I will need to unsubcribe again.  I just can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; master the delete key in the way I need to.   The topics are too<br/>
&gt; interesting and I agree and disagree with people so intensely.  I have<br/>
&gt; a lot of experience and ideas to offer but sadly don&#39;t have the time.<br/>
<br/>
i can completely agree with you and i entertain the same thoughts.  it&#39;s<br/>
too bad you are unable to find the time to share but it&#39;s<br/>
understandable.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I would encourage everyone to email Oprah&#39;s website and let them know<br/>
&gt; just how big and varied unschooling and homeschooling are.  Oprah is<br/>
&gt; just mesmerized by schools and teachers.  She needs lots of<br/>
&gt; encouragement to do the topic real justice.  So let&#39;s try for an email<br/>
&gt; a week to Oprah for... say three weeks..... psst! Pass it On!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am leaving this list forthwith.<br/>

I should add that, while my son got along well with some of the kids, there<br/>
was one that was a challenge for him.  It took several years for the two<br/>
boys to work through their differences.  Part of it was my son learning to<br/>
get along with others.  Fortunately, I could talk freely about this with<br/>
the other boy&#39;s mom.<br/>

The Army looked into Clonlara and decided that it wasn&#39;t &#39;real school&#39;<br/>
because he never went to classes.  All our arguments, including faxes from<br/>
Clonlara showing their accredidation, went for naught.  Eventually Chris was<br/>
&#39;allowed&#39; to enlist during one of the windows in which the Army<br/>
&#39;temporarily&#39;<br/>
lowers its standards in order to meet quotas :)  So he could enlist as a<br/>
non-highschool grad.<br/>
<br/>
I was told that the Air Force is not so stinky; I don&#39;t know about the<br/>
Navy/Marines.  But I suspect all the services have those windows, because<br/>
they all have quotas to meet.  And if your child can do well on the testing<br/>
the services give, they will find a way to enlist the child.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; knowledge of how to get nonsense.  The proper methods of developing<br/>
<br/>
&gt; one&#39;s own intellect have to be learned just like any other knowledge,<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and having a teacher to guide the process is of significant value.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; (See Objective Approach.) A parent who insists that a child must lead<br/>
<br/>
&gt; his own education places an undue burden upon his young shoulders.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Children do not yet have a broad enough context to see how knowledge<br/>

she the person you were debating with, or was someone else just echoing her <br/>

I really don&#39;t like the way Withrow bashes unschoolers.  Her arguments just <br/>
don&#39;t represent the beliefs of most unschoolers that I have talked with.<br/>
