<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830104608">About unschooling  :)<br/>
I have been reading the book The Teenage Liberation Handbook. I am sure that <br/>
everyone else has already read it as I always kept hearing about how great it <br/>
was. Then I ran across it on ebay for a $1 and jumped on it. I love it. I <br/>
wish, wish, wish that I would have read it when I was 12 or 13. That was when <br/>
my BAD school years really started. I wonder how different my life would have <br/>
been and my husband&#39;s too. As I read I began to remember the times in our <br/>
unschooling past where I became concerned about whether the kids were <br/>
learning enough. I thought I was a good parent, wanting them to have great <br/>
adult lives someday. To be a success. Now I see that what I was thinking was <br/>
that they would not have great adult lives if they were not making lots of <br/>
money in some super career. I wanted them to make lots of money so their <br/>
lives would be easier. I was limiting my children. My husband is in <br/>
construction. We do not have a lot of money. My family has been in <br/>
construction since they used mules with the machinery. (which is something I <br/>
would still like to see), I have never know lots of money. Have I always <br/>
related that to failure? When I was a little kids I always thought that my <br/>
Dad had the greatest job in the whole world. He owned and ran those big neat <br/>
machines. I was so proud. I had a wonderful (not!) teacher in jr high that <br/>
loved to tell me how I would never amount to anything, be a ditch digger all <br/>
my life. Boy I hated him. Coming from a family of &quot;ditch diggers&quot; he was <br/>
linking that with failure. Great huh! The Teenage Liberation Handbook has <br/>
helped me to see that whatever, and I mean whatever my kids want to be as <br/>
adults is ok. I so wish I would not had so much emotional garbage inside when <br/>
I started raising my kids. I would have been a better parent. And it came <br/>
from public school. Twelve long years of gabage collecting<br/>
Just thinking aloud...<br/>
