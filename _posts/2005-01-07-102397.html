<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133970730"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;We did cards, too, like Sandra described - and I also put up a big <br/>
&gt;blank piece of poster paper on a wall and when there was a word my kid <br/>
&gt;wanted to know, I&#39;d write it on there. So then they&#39;d know it was there <br/>
&gt;in the future. No order, not even lined up - just words scrawled all <br/>
&gt;over the page - willy-nilly. The first words they learned were things <br/>
&gt;like &quot;alligator&quot; and &quot;umbrella&quot; along with &quot;the&quot; and &quot;from&quot; and &quot;love.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i love this idea, pam!  i think my eve (6) will find it very<br/>
helpful..i&#39;ll ask her about it today.  she&#39;s in a language explosion with<br/>
her reading all of a sudden...it&#39;s truly amazing to watch her take the<br/>
reigns and go with it where she needs/wants to. :)<br/>
<br/>
love,<br/>
