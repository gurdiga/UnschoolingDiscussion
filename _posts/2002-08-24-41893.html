<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112267078">For some of us this discussion is support.<br/>
It really depends on how one views this... again, an interpretation....<br/>
I read many comments here that internally support what we are doing with our <br/>
children, even though I have not met with any of you.<br/>
Sounds odd, but it is true.<br/>
There seems to be a common connection.<br/>
For me, anyway, this is true... there is support here.<br/>

SON WANTING TO JOIN AIR FORCE:<br/>
Hey, 9 yr. old son now wants to join the Air Force.. so my dh, who is day <br/>
dad, took the kids to the base, stopped at a recruiting office, and now we <br/>
even have a sticker on the van.. we got a CD of flying jets, bought a kid <br/>
video about &quot;I want to be a pilot&quot;,<br/>
and even encouraged our son about the Air Force technique of cleaning and <br/>
making beds... (He isn&#39;t a messy kid, just cluttery  :-)<br/>
It was fun for us.. I didn&#39;t go on any of the outings as I was at school <br/>
(teaching), but it sure was fun hearing about their adventures those 2 days..<br/>
<br/>
Any other Air Force ideas?  We were reading about &quot;JANE&quot; but then 9 yr. old <br/>
starting finding it boring; so we haven&#39;t picked it back up.<br/>
<br/>
We just started back to school.  I teach 2nd grade.  I am SOOOO thankful we <br/>
have the blessing of keeping our children at home, not stifling there <br/>
creative and knowledge.  Not having them lined up as &quot;just another quiet or <br/>
wiggly kid in line&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
BLESSINGS SENT...<br/>
Hug your kid!  They deserve it!<br/>

he&#39;s in charge of security at a base on O&#39;ahu, in Hawai&#39;i. He doesn&#39;t<br/>
fly, he does police-type stuff, and he&#39;s actually a really wonderful guy<br/>
and a great uncle, if you don&#39;t mind that he never remembers birthdays.<br/>
<br/>
If your son has any questions, you could email me (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:freeform@...">freeform@...</a>) and<br/>
I can ask him.<br/>
