<h4>coyote&#39;s corner</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280337050">This morning, while going through what seemed like a thousand e-mails, I lost one from this list. I&#39;m not sure who wrote it. It was about asking kids to taste something.<br/>
The appeal and a few other points. I liked it. <br/>
May I ask to have that sent to me - off list?<br/>
I&#39;d like to read it again...esp...the appeal part.<br/>
I have a thing about shell fish so I don&#39;t make anyone taste anything...but the rest of the post was very good.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
