<div id="ygrps-yiv-214055842">Sounds like a very unhappy woman...who didn&#39;t meet the right people for the <br/>
right reasons...<br/>
there&#39;s no &quot;convincing&quot; unhappy, spitefull people--there will always be <br/>
people like that...unfortunately<br/>
Hopefully the people considering hsing will see how sad and hatefull she is <br/>
and just chalk it up to &quot;people who disagree&quot; and strive for a better life <br/>
for themselves and their children...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-196963086">homeschooling teenagers&lt;without exception the teenagers were very, very<br/>
lonely and isolated&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Funny, this is how I felt in PS.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;1. Religious Fanatics<br/>
2. the Wheatgrass and Newage crowd<br/>
3. The people like ourselves who read about homeschooling and thought<br/>
it sounded great from a philisophical stand point.&gt;<br/>
I find it hard to believe that this woman ONLY met the kinds of people she<br/>
describes.  I guess what she&#39;s saying is that if you&#39;re not in cateogry 1 or<br/>
2 you have to be in 3.  How weird!  I feel sorry that this woman could not<br/>
find any friends.  Sounds like a problem with her not with homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if this is a true former homeschooler or just someone faking<br/>
it.<br/>
