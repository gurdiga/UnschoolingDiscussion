&lt;&lt;   When <br/>
 I&#39;m talking about my son, I can use the more specific term of <br/>
 physically-disabled, for instance. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I think with your son you are dealing with real, live, physical differences <br/>
that he was born with.<br/>
It&#39;s different than labeling someone disabled just because they have <br/>
sensitivity issues or a unique learning style etc....<br/>
But I still don&#39;t like the term &quot;disabled&quot;, I guess because it implies the <br/>
whole person is not able instead of labeling him as a person dealing with <br/>
some disabilities.<br/>
Does that make sense? Maybe it&#39;s being nitpicky, but I would hate to have a <br/>
child feel not capable as an entire being, even though they may have some <br/>
VERY difficult things to live with in their life.<br/>
A physical difference is real. Labeling personality/emotional differences as <br/>
disabilities is troublesome to me.<br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
