<div id="ygrps-yiv-1109832779"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Just as a matter of interest.<br/>
&gt; Do you limit TV?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thought I&#39;d just chime in on this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
We do not limit anything, except access to pornography.  Of <br/>
course, some people differ on what is pornography.  Some people I <br/>
am aquainted with thought Titanic was pornography because of the <br/>
&quot;breast&quot; scene.  I don&#39;t agree, I loved the movie.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids (10 and 16, both boys) watch as much tv as they want, as <br/>
much computer as they want, as much nintendo as they want.  <br/>
However, as with anything, if you allow them unlimited access to it, <br/>
eventually they get REALLY tired of it and look for other things to <br/>
do.  It&#39;s better if they learn on their own that it&#39;s really boring to do it <br/>
all the time.  That way, I am not constantly forcing them to do <br/>
something else.  They choose on their own to do something else.  <br/>
My ten year old loves nintendo, but he also loves creative projects.  <br/>
All I have to do is sit down at the kitchen table and start a project, <br/>
and he&#39;s right there wanting to help me.  He also loves to play <br/>
outside in the summer.  Also, we talk about every program they <br/>
watch, so they get a lot of values teaching from everything they <br/>
watch.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t have a lot of restrictions on what they can do....as <br/>
long as they clean up their own mess, and don&#39;t disturb or hurt <br/>
others, they can do what they want, go to bed when they want, get <br/>
up when they want, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and as a member of the household they have to do chores.  I <br/>
guess that is a limit.<br/>

Only in the way of &#39;sharing&#39; ie there&#39;s a program that <br/>
I want to watch and you&#39;ve been watching all day, if <br/>
you want I can tape it but I&#39;m going to watch now!!  <br/>
Normally I wouldn&#39;t be so gng-ho but I really have run <br/>
out of tolerance since being pregnant, and it&#39;s good-<br/>
telly-season *grin*  <br/>
<br/>
I limit where they can make their mess, their room <br/>
looks like a bomb&#39;s dropped on it, they need help <br/>
keeping it tidy and I can&#39;t do that atm either, but I <br/>
object to having small hard things like army men (2 <br/>
dd&#39;s and we have army men and cowboys and injuns, good <br/>
ol&#39; Uncle...) on the bedroom floor!  Going to be a big <br/>
culture shock when no3 arrives!!  Unschooling in action <br/>
I suppose, learning from life and all that :-)<br/>
<br/>
basically our only constraints are when something&#39;s <br/>
probably going to be gruesome (they are 5 and 4yo) I <br/>
tell them, and when i&#39;m desperate for quiet, or when dh <br/>
needs the &#39;puter for working, or when it&#39;s 5 minutes <br/>
until teatime and they&#39;re asking for biscuits...  I <br/>
would like it if they got dressed and played outside <br/>
more, but the garden&#39;s not hospitable and the neighbour <br/>
kids cliquey...  Life isn&#39;t perfect but mostly it works <br/>
out.<br/>

<br/>
I can attest to this.  I am a full fledged TV addict and it is on most of the <br/>
time.  My kids, contrary to dire predictions, will find ANYTHING to do other <br/>
than watch TV.  It&#39;s not interesting to them, they are not fixated by it and <br/>
would rather be outside, drawing, etc.  My daughter, 10, it always turning it <br/>
off in hopes I won&#39;t turn it on again.<br/>
<br/>
My friends who are always coercing their kids to NOT watch have kids who are <br/>
hypnotized by the thing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how I got the way I am.  I have a hard time doing any ONE thing <br/>
at a time and I think it occupies enough of my &quot;semi-conscious&quot; mind to <br/>
enable me to concentrate on other things.  I have the station set to <br/>
educational channels 99% of the time, Discovery, History Channel, TLC because <br/>
I can&#39;t stand most other programming.  At least the kids are getting some <br/>
&quot;learnin&quot; out of the situation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-900003683">Good luck with Katie.  I married a man with a 12 yr old boy and I will say I <br/>
found it a bit rocky for awhile.  You seem to have lots of inner strength and <br/>
empathy so I hope the rough spots won&#39;t be too discouraging.  My <br/>
congratulations on an opportunity to make a difference in the life of another <br/>
young person.<br/>
