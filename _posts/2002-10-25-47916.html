<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926799344">I thought I&#39;d share what my 9 year old and I have been learning <br/>
lately. <br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve shared before, our town is seriously considering an ordinance <br/>
banning skateboards and scooters on sidewalks and streets.  The <br/>
exception would be children under 7 on a scooter with an adult <br/>
present.  <br/>
<br/>
First offense, fine and confiscation of scooter or skateboard for 90 <br/>
days.  Second offense, fine and confiscation for 180 days.  Third <br/>
offense scooter or skateboard is destroyed and fine is $300.  After <br/>
the first offense, parents can be arrested for allowing their <br/>
children for riding the skateboard or skooter.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My daughter and I have been walking the streets of our town getting <br/>
petitions signed.  We&#39;ve found that each block takes a little over an <br/>
hour. We figured out how much time we would have to put in each day <br/>
in order to finish on time.  That required some math.  We printed up <br/>
contact information for people who sign our petition urging them to <br/>
contact the mayor and council members.  <br/>
<br/>
After the first 4 blocks, we realized that the majority of people are <br/>
against the ordinance. We thought it would be good to keep track of <br/>
how many against and how many for.  Then, we&#39;ll figure out the <br/>
percentage for and against and add that to our case. Maybe make up a <br/>
little graph.   My daughter is writing a letter, I&#39;m writing a <br/>
letter, we&#39;re sending each council member copies of our petitions--<br/>
we&#39;re hoping for 500 signatures--and we&#39;re showing up at the <br/>
meeting.  Maybe I&#39;ll send them cute pictures of my kids standing with <br/>
their scooters and skateboards.  <br/>
<br/>
I figure this will be good for civics, math, and language arts to put <br/>
in the homeschool portfolio at the end of the year!  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have any other ideas of what we can do?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Find out if your town has any rules about how they accept petitions. In our <br/>
town there is a minimum number of signatures required and I think they have <br/>
to be signed by registered voters. I know that anytime I have been asked to <br/>
sign a petition, I have always been asked if I am a registered voter or not. <br/>
Ask if they will accept children&#39;s signatures. Moly wanted to sign a petition <br/>
for a new riverside park and wasn&#39;t allowed to do so, even though she is very <br/>
interested in helping get it started.<br/>
