Let the reading instruction just go -- take a long vacation from it for now <br/>
-- take the pressure off of all of you and give them time to heal.<br/>
<br/>
You should know that MANY of us have kids who were not reading at 7 and 8 and <br/>
are voracious skilled book-loving readers now. 7 and 8 is too early for many <br/>
kids and that is especially true if the teaching methods were in conflict <br/>
with their own particular learning styles. Blocks have probably been created. <br/>
Focus really hard on ENJOYMENT of literature - forget about the reading <br/>
skills. HEAL the wounds created by the negative experiences they&#39;ve already <br/>
had in this area -- just enjoy books and magazine and play around with words <br/>
and language - but do not force it - enjoy it, share it, have fun.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Sorry for the long post, but you&#39;d have to understand Mirial, in <br/>
 order to understand why i&#39;m having doubts about whether I can do this. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Remember the story of Ferdinand the bull?  He was different from all the <br/>
other bulls and his mother was just patient and understanding &lt;g&gt;.   My <br/>
oldest was a Ferdinand - always doing things in his own way and style.  So I <br/>
got taught right off the bat not to expect my child to do what the other kids <br/>
were doing - and that I needed to look at what *his* gifts, talents, <br/>
interests and style were/are.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, it may take years to see exactly where those interests and talents are <br/>
taking them.  It took awhile for me to get used to taking *very slow* walks <br/>
with him when he was a toddler and preschooler because he&#39;d look at every <br/>
little speck on the ground.  It would take 5 minutes just to get to the next <br/>
driveway (then, later, I was surprised with the other 2 children who would <br/>
run on ahead of me at the same age).  <br/>
<br/>
That attention with the minute details of the natural world has, over time, <br/>
developed into a fascination with insects.  He&#39;s now 14, and he can spend <br/>
hours out in the gardens very patiently looking for insects.  He remembers <br/>
everything he reads or discovers about them - what they eat, the names of <br/>
their parts, how their bodies work, their families/genus etc., what plants <br/>
they&#39;re typically found on, whom else they&#39;re food for (this from a child who <br/>
doesn&#39;t remember what we did yesterday &lt;grin&gt;).  We&#39;re having a hard time <br/>
finding insect guides and books that are in-depth enough to identify many of <br/>
the more obscure ones.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, he didn&#39;t sit still for me to read to him when he was 7 either &lt;grin&gt;.  <br/>
We&#39;re fairly certain that he&#39;d probably have been labeled ADD if he had been <br/>
in school.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot; I can&#39;t even read to her, because we&#39;ll be reading a book, and she&#39;ll look <br/>
at <br/>
the pictures and get to wanting to go see a bird, or ride a bike, or <br/>
do anythign that is realted to the picture.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You learn more about birds from watching them then from books.  Books can <br/>
help with identification and other things, but you *really* get to know a <br/>
bird by watching it.  For instance, many basic bird books don&#39;t mention when <br/>
and how birds moult - which is something we learned about recently when we <br/>
had a bunch of really ratty looking birds at the feeder.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there&#39;s lots of time to learn all sorts of things.  If she wants to <br/>
learn from birds rather than books, why not?  She&#39;s only 7 &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
(And I still need to remind myself of this with my 14 yo - because now I&#39;m <br/>
feeling like &quot;It&#39;s only 4 years till college and how will he ever be able to <br/>
fill out a good looking application?!&quot; - which really is a pathetic way to <br/>
view 4 years of life.  I&#39;m working on myself - and he doesn&#39;t know I&#39;m <br/>
panicking (at least I hope not &lt;grin&gt;)).<br/>
