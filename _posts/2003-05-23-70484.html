<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743754951">I was asked, after a brief note to a friend on a parenting list, about<br/>
unschooling.  Then there was a question about my reply.  I&#39;m posting what I<br/>
wrote, because I want you brainwashing, evil people to see what you have<br/>
DONE TO ME!!! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Kelly<br/>
<br/>
(Letter one in response to &quot;what is unschooling?)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the philosophy that a child will learn what he needs if<br/>
presented with an environment full of opportunity to learn and the resources<br/>
and support to do so. This does presume that not every child *needs* to<br/>
learn the same stuff. So you may end up with a kid who knows EVERYTHING<br/>
about ancient Egypt and not much about the American Revolution.<br/>
<br/>
But what you do get is a kid who knows HOW to learn. And, if it turns out<br/>
they suddenly NEED to learn about the American Revolution, they understand<br/>
research and sources and stuff and can find it out.<br/>
<br/>
It also presumes that you can learn the basics through just living. And<br/>
through unrestricted play. Like James doing most of his reading on Zelda.<br/>
He&#39;s a great reader. He just doesn&#39;t sit down with a book. And you<br/>
wouldn&#39;t sit down and &quot;teach&quot; fractions, but your child would end up<br/>
learning them just fine by cooking. LOTS of fractions in cooking! -grin-<br/>
<br/>
In some ways it&#39;s harder on the parents than a straight curriculum because<br/>
you sort of have to be willing to drop everything and help your child study<br/>
fruit flies for as long as they are interested. But they really get a<br/>
confidence in their own knowledge because it is self motivated.<br/>
<br/>
And for many familes it extends to other lifestyle/parenting issues. I&#39;m<br/>
realizing that I was always much more &quot;unschooly&quot; than not. James never had<br/>
a strict bedtime. Even when he was in school it was &quot;tenish.&quot; And now???<br/>
It&#39;s rare the night he&#39;s not up later than me. He watches all the tv he<br/>
wants, plays tons of video games, eats anything he wants, etc. He has much<br/>
more control over his personal environment than a lot of kids I know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(note to unschooling list: having written this, I&#39;m not even sure how true<br/>
it is.  We&#39;ll see if I get off my but enough to do anything formal.  -grin-)<br/>
I&#39;m not sure we are going to go the full unschooling path next year. I<br/>
*like* working with him on stuff. And sometimes he enjoys it. -grin-<br/>
We&#39;ll see. It&#39;s a pretty big leap, in many ways and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m ready.<br/>
Mostly because with the two little ones, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be able to do<br/>
that &quot;fruit fly&quot; stuff well enough. And if we have even a loose guideline<br/>
it will help make sure James gets enough Mommy time, if nothing else.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this explains it.<br/>

second letter<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; It&#39;s rare the night he&#39;s not up later than me. He watches all the<br/>
&gt;&gt; tv he wants, plays tons of video games, eats anything he wants, etc.<br/>
&gt;&gt;He has much more control over his personal environment than a lot of kids<br/>
&gt;&gt;I know.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;And how is the above description a good thing?<br/>
&gt;(I&#39;m not trying to be rude, just seriously curious)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t *you* feel better and function better when you have control of your<br/>
personal environment? When you can set your own goals, work to meet them, do<br/>
them in the evironment you find most comfortable?<br/>
<br/>
Everyone has their own circadian rhythm. In this family it runs from about<br/>
10 am to about 1 am. On average. We fought for 2 years with James to get him<br/>
to have a 9 PM bed time, when he was 1-3 years old. Then we let him stay up<br/>
a couple nights and noticed he crashed at 10:30 like clockwork. Well, gee,<br/>
that was simple! So we set a 10 PM bedtime and he was out with some<br/>
cuddling. That was when he had to be up at 7 for daycare. He doesn&#39;t HAVE to<br/>
be up now, unless we have plans. So why set an arbitrary bedtime?<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t sit down to dinner much, so the kids will eat &quot;dinner&quot; either<br/>
before Joe and I or after. When THEY are hungry. It&#39;s much healthier to eat<br/>
when you are hungry than to set up times for it and wait until then. In fact<br/>
I watched just that the other day with his best friend. The rule was &quot;you<br/>
could have a big snack before 4 pm, a small snack after 4.&quot; So James was<br/>
visiting and the kids were more busy playing than snacking. 5:45 came around<br/>
and we were packing to leave. The kid was hungry, but because dinner was<br/>
being made he couldn&#39;t have a snack. He got really angry. I was told by the<br/>
nanny that this happens every day. Well, maybe you need to move dinner up or<br/>
let the kid eat when HE&#39;s hungry??? When I&#39;m hungry for something just<br/>
before my meal I call it an appetizer. -grin- When he was hungry for<br/>
something just before dinner it&#39;s called being whiny. -no grin- It struck me<br/>
as so nuts. I mean, my 33 year old husband forgets to eat because he&#39;s<br/>
deeply into something, why would I expect a 7 year old not to do the same<br/>
thing. But when Joe does it he can eat when he remembers. Why can&#39;t a 7 year<br/>
old?<br/>
<br/>
As for the video games and such? So his goal right now is to beat Zelda? He<br/>
has to figure out what items and skills he needs to aquire and then aquire<br/>
them. He has to keep working at it when he might fail the first (dozen)<br/>
times. He has to seek out the advice of experts to accomplish his goal. (His<br/>
dad and the guys from work are primary, but he can find info himself on the<br/>
internet--including using google.) He has to be able to read and retain<br/>
information in context.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of it has to do with trusting your child and modeling for him. (It&#39;s<br/>
in the modeling that I&#39;m not so strong. -sigh-) I have to trust that just<br/>
living his life, doing things that he enjoys and being with family and<br/>
friends will expose James to the experiences that he needs to start learning<br/>
what he needs for life. Then I have to be there for him and help him when he<br/>
wants to learn more than is on the surface. So if he finds a cool tool in<br/>
Zelda and asks about it, I have to be right there to help him figure out how<br/>
to find out more about it. But I also have to trust that sometimes, just<br/>
playing the game is enough.<br/>
<br/>
And James *knows* I trust him. He knows that I am confident he will get some<br/>
sleep, eat a meal, etc. So he has the safety to try out new sleep patterns<br/>
and see if they make him feel better. He can skip the fancy meal I made for<br/>
Dad and me and have peanut butter sandwich later, &#39;cause I know he&#39;ll eat.<br/>
Most unschooled teens don&#39;t go through the same kind of &quot;rebellious&quot; stage<br/>
because they haven&#39;t has as many arbitrary (&quot;Your bedtime is 9PM because you<br/>
are 9 years old&quot;) kinds of rules.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, now I&#39;ve really rambled enough. It&#39;s been a real philosophy switch for<br/>
me. Or more, finding out there is a philosophy which fits my natural take on<br/>
life.</div>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In reading this, I wonder if this is how we wish to present ourselves to the <br/>
non-unchooling world.  Actually, the above description fits my oldest <br/>
daughter a lot of times, but to an outsider looking in, reading everything <br/>
written, this paragraph sticks out like a sore thumb.  I can see where the <br/>
rest of the information would be forgotten upon reading that one paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is important, when explaining unschooling, to include information <br/>
on restrictions...well lack of...but I wonder how legitimate this sounds to <br/>
someone wanting to transition into child-led learning.  I think the thought <br/>
of having a child sit in front of video games, eating potato chips and <br/>
drinking coke all day is what keeps a lot of people from even considering <br/>
unschooling.  When we began homeschooling five years ago, I had this <br/>
fear...BIG time!  I struggled with other issues (will they learn enough, I&#39;m <br/>
not creative enough, etc.) but had I heard that there are unschooling kids <br/>
out there actually doing it, I would have run as far in the opposite <br/>
direction as possible.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I&#39;m not sure we are going to go the full unschooling path next year. I<br/>
&lt;*like* working with him on stuff. And sometimes he enjoys it. -grin-<br/>
&lt;We&#39;ll see. It&#39;s a pretty big leap, in many ways and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m ready.<br/>
&lt;Mostly because with the two little ones, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be able to do<br/>
&lt;that &quot;fruit fly&quot; stuff well enough. And if we have even a loose guideline<br/>
&lt;it will help make sure James gets enough Mommy time, if nothing else.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t give up on unschooling!  Why do you need a &#39;loose guidline&#39; (I assume <br/>
you mean curriculum?) to give your son Mommy time?  You don&#39;t!  All those <br/>
little fruit fly moments will take care of that.  If you have the time and <br/>
interest to follow a guidline *prescribed* by someone outside your family, <br/>
why not follow your children&#39;s guideline?  Their *prescription* will lead <br/>
you along the path *they* need to follow.  You can still work on stuff with <br/>
him without forcing schooling onto him.  You say he enjoys it &#39;sometimes&#39;.  <br/>
What about the times he doesn&#39;t enjoy it?<br/>
<br/>
Give yourself some time.  It doesn&#39;t have to be a big leap.  It can be a <br/>
gradual enlightenment!  Keep reading.  Go to the SC conference!!!  Follow <br/>
their cues and you *will* have Mommy time with them.  Find websites of <br/>
unschooled kids and read their stories to James aloud.  Talk with him about <br/>
what he thinks is cool and exciting.  Use that as a springboard and absorb <br/>
yourselves in fun and adventurous quests for knowledge together!  I&#39;m not <br/>
sure how old your younger ones are, but even a baby can be slung on your <br/>
back to enjoy the ride!<br/>
<br/>
I believe Mary (?) said, unschooling is the journey, not the destination.  <br/>
You don&#39;t have to have it all figured out right this minute.  There&#39;s not a <br/>
book or curriculum out there that will figure it out for you anyway.  The <br/>
only thing that will bring you to your destination is life itself.  Strive <br/>
to make every moment enjoyable and when you reach your destination, you will <br/>
have no regrets! :)<br/>

It&#39;s worth leaving that bit of food-for-thought for them to eat (or not) when <br/>
they&#39;re hungry!<br/>
<br/>
If we decide we don&#39;t know what our children need to know or should be <br/>
learning or can learn today, it&#39;s a teeny baby step to realizing we do NOT know what <br/>
they need to eat or whether they&#39;re really tired or not.<br/>

about the language I used.  And the reality is, this is what James is doing<br/>
right now!  -grin-  In someways it was more about me being comfortable just<br/>

a list of things to &quot;cover&quot; while we were away on vacation.  I used those<br/>
Core Curriculum books by Hirsch.  I just told James today that I&#39;d like to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>too cool!  i loved your messages to them, and hope people there took them well.<br/>
<br/>
timing is everything...  this morning i wrote a long message to my december <br/>
98 group (also a pregnancy group) giving my reasons for homeschooling.  (i <br/>
mentioned unschooling but said i&#39;d give more detail later--the message was <br/>
long enough!)<br/>
<br/>
one mom posted last night that she is considering homeschooling, because <br/>
her 4.5 year old son is very active, and his preschool teacher said things <br/>
to her yesterday like &quot;He&#39;s got an amazing vocabulary, but he doesn&#39;t sit <br/>
still.&quot;  &quot;He doesn&#39;t listen well.&quot;  &quot;He fidgets.&quot;  ack!  in their case, the <br/>
DH stays home & the mom works, and the mom is the one who wants to consider <br/>
homeschooling.  she is looking for info for her DH.  any stay-at-home dads <br/>
here, or places i could point them?  anyway, in my reply to her, i <br/>
mentioned that we&#39;ve decided we&#39;re not sending our kids to school.  then i <br/>
was asked why, so i wrote my long message.  i hope my group responds as <br/>
thoughtfully as yours did.<br/>

If you do that, though, and he discovers any of those things naturally (or if <br/>
you casually leave them out for him to find), it will be &quot;schoolwork&quot; instead <br/>
of joyous discovery.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;ll consider cancelling your meeting about what to learn next year. <br/>
 It really does have the great potential to keep you from seeing unschooling <br/>
work as well and as soon as you would without it.<br/>
<br/>
It also maintains for you the object/field separation which causes some thing<br/>
s/subjects/ideas to be more valuable than others, and you really don&#39;t know <br/>
what will be valuable to him in the longrun.<br/>

Some kids know that quote well before Hirsch thinks they need to, and anyone <br/>

book.  :-)<br/>
The Unschooling Handbook : How to Use the Whole World As Your Child&#39;s Classroom<br/>
by Mary Griffith<br/>
if there&#39;s another &#39;handbook&#39; i&#39;d like to hear about it too.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you can still contribute.  digests are just groups of messages all sent in <br/>
one file.  according to yahoo.com &quot;Messages are delivered in batches of 25 <br/>
or daily, whichever comes sooner.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I really love being on the list but it is so hard to keep up with three <br/>
&gt; children, two babies:) thanks Kelli<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i know what you&#39;re saying!  my (twin) girls are now 2 years old, but it <br/>
still seems i only read email while i&#39;m nursing them.  my son is almost 4.5 <br/>
now, and wants to know what the messages are about, or play zoo tycoon with <br/>
me.  (i&#39;ve got to get a copy for his computer soon.)  :-)<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve found that i prefer to not use the digest, since then i can&#39;t sort the <br/>
messages by title.  my email software (eudora) allows me to set up filters, <br/>
so all messages from this group go into one folder.  i know other mail <br/>
software allows this too.  that way you can just read the group messages <br/>
when you have time.  you can also usually sort them by title, so you can go <br/>
to the topics that you think will be most useful to you.<br/>
