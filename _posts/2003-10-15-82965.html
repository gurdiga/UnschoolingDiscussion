I don&#39;t believe in this email you recieved...I work for Estee Lauder as both a Beauty consultant and a professional artist and they don&#39;t use lead in their lipstick!!<br/>
 Just to be sure, I did the &quot;test&quot; that was mentioned on several of my 20 lipsticks, and none turned color.<br/>
The test is either faulty or there is no lead in lipsticks of the companies you mentioned (I tested both Lauder and Lancome colors).<br/>
I think someone is just trying to hurt the cosmetic industry.<br/>
<br/>
Most companies don&#39;t even allow animal testing these days, I highly doubt any of them use lead.<br/>

I certainly didn&#39;t mean anything personal. I don&#39;t wear make-up - well, I<br/>
work at home; set up at powwows. I&#39;m sure to wear make-up again....I do<br/>
apologize.<br/>
