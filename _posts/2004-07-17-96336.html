We asked everyone once to not send any more stuffed animals <br/>
cuz they are expensive and my kids don&#39;t play with them ever.  We have chains <br/>
from the ceilings filled with the cutest dust collector&#39;s you&#39;ve ever seen.  <br/>
Once in awhile we throw them all down for cleaning and they fiddle with them for a minute, then they&#39;re off to do something else.  <br/>
