<div id="ygrps-yiv-169154216">Hmmmm maybe that&#39;s where we&#39;re getting tangled up in this talk about rights. <br/>
<br/>
I think parents DO need the right to do &quot;good&quot; things, too. Such as the right to choose any method of homeschooling freely and without fear. The right to choose not to vaccinate without having to put up with lectures and threats, or worse. The right to choose that your newborn baby not get gunk put in his eyes that make his all-important first day with you blurry. The right to let your young child stip and play naked under the sprinklers without worrying that CPS may take him away from you for neglect. I see a great need for parents to have these kinds of &quot;good&quot; rights. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, children need rights too, that&#39;s why I said I think parents and children&#39;s rights should be equal - neither one above the other. If a child wants to play in the sprinklers naked, the parent should allow this. If a parent needs the child to get in the car so they can go to the store, the parent has the right to have the child do so. Rights working both ways, and ideally mutual respect keeping these rights equal. <br/>
<br/>
Gosh, I hope that made some kind of sense! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Who decides if a parent can give birth at home and what type of <br/>
midwife she may use?  <br/>
<br/>
Who is going to decide if the child is going to get a hepatitis B <br/>
vaccination at birth?  <br/>
<br/>
Who is going to decide if the child is treated by a homeopath or a <br/>
medical doctor?  <br/>
<br/>
Who is going to decide if a 10 year old can stay home alone for 10 <br/>
minutes?  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of the issues that I&#39;m thinking about when I argue for parental <br/>
rights are issues where the parent wants what she thinks is best for <br/>
the child, on the child&#39;s behalf but the state thinks otherwise.  <br/>
Like if a child doesn&#39;t want to go to school but the state says that <br/>
he is of &quot;compulsory age&quot;.  The parents shouldn&#39;t have to jump <br/>
through all kinds of hoops to allow their kids to stay home.  Or if a <br/>
CYS worker decides that a child&#39;s room is too messy and orders him to <br/>
clean it or be removed from his home (I&#39;ve seen it happen).  Or if a <br/>
child wants to wear his favorite shirt for 5 days in a row and <br/>
someone reports him for that (I&#39;ve seen that happen too).  <br/>
<br/>
And if a child is refusing to stop hitting his sibling and the parent <br/>
decides to discipline him by spanking him or taking away a privelage, <br/>
and that&#39;s the best thing that the parent knows how to do, should the <br/>
child and family really be seperated because of that?  <br/>
<br/>
Should a Christian family be forced to allow their child to wear a <br/>
satanic t-shirt or hold a seance in his bedroom?  Should parents be <br/>
forced to allow their children to have sex in their bedrooms?  Dress <br/>
like a prostitute?  Get 666 tattooed on their foreheads?  Use drugs?  <br/>
Extreme examples, I know, but do you really think that parents <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have any right ever to step in and say &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I <br/>
just can&#39;t allow you to do this.&quot;  I know that in an ideal world the <br/>
parents would have seen that something was off balance way before the <br/>
tattoo and the sex and dealt with it within the context of a loving <br/>
relationship, but we&#39;re talking about a world that isn&#39;t ideal.  And <br/>
in this world, do we really want to send those kids off to foster <br/>
care because the parents grounded them to keep them from destructive <br/>
behavior?  <br/>

really happen?<br/>
With all the child abuse that goes on you&#39;d think the state would be <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not about being &#39;forced&#39; but allowing the child to have their own <br/>
opinions and path. If a human being chooses to do the above why <br/>
would other humans feel they should stop them just because they <br/>
are related?<br/>
In a loving family the above situations would be discussed I&#39;m sure <br/>
but the final decision should rest with the person wishing to wear <br/>
the Satanic T-shirt, have tattoos etc. Obviously the child has <br/>
chosen not to follow the parents religion if he or she wishes to hold <br/>
a seance. Why should the parents force their religious choices on <br/>
their children? I would give my children unconditional love whatever <br/>
path they chose. I&#39;m a pagan but if they wished to go to church, <br/>
become a republican (things that are distateful to me) I would <br/>
support them fully. It is their choice to make, not mine.<br/>
Teenagers are nearly adults and are embarking on their own <br/>
journey into the world and they should have the right to their own <br/>
decisions and opinions, whatever the parents choices.<br/>
None of the above situations would bother me in the slightest to be <br/>
honest although I may point out to my child that wearing a satanic <br/>
t-shirt might lead to encounters with narrow minded bigots.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I know that in an ideal world the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I don&#39;t see the above behaviours as destructive and  also <br/>
doubt that in a loving family a child would feel the need to be <br/>
destructive and rebellious against parents.<br/>
I was speaking to a friend in the UK yestreday who is having <br/>
terrible problems with her 15 yo daughter. This child was forced <br/>
into school and has been tightly controlled and harshly punished to <br/>
&#39;keep her in the line&#39; My friend is in depsair about how she cannot <br/>
trust her daughter, how her daughter sweas at her, drinks etc etc. <br/>
There is no real love or trust between them yet she has done the <br/>
parental rights thing to the extreme. Then I think about Sandra&#39;s <br/>
accounts of her kids and other HS kids I know raised in trust and <br/>
non-coercively and how they act.<br/>
Makes ya think.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Shyrley raised excellent points to this, and got me thinking.  I think it&#39;s <br/>
very easy to forget when we have kids that our children are individuals <br/>
with individual paths of their own.  If we do our job well, we can empower <br/>
a kid to find his or her path and get on it.  What&#39;s tricky about that is <br/>
that a kid&#39;s path may look nothing like our own path.  That doesn&#39;t make <br/>
their path wrong or not worthy.  I&#39;m a peace lover and peace pursuer.  I <br/>
sing about peace.  I agitate for peace.  I pray for peace.  Liam is invited <br/>
to participate with me in what I do.  Sometimes he wants to; sometimes he <br/>
doesn&#39;t.  If I force him to come with me to a peace rally (in fact there <br/>
are two this weekend I had planned to attend), I can guarantee that he will <br/>
not want to go to any of them.  His path may not be that of a peace <br/>
agitator.  Maybe he&#39;ll recognize his path through my work for peace (maybe <br/>
that&#39;s why he picked me to be his mom).  Maybe his path is being a riot <br/>
control officer! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The thing is that however distasteful our children&#39;s choices may be, as <br/>
long as they are not harmful choices, I think we owe it to them and to <br/>
ourselves to find the learning it whatever they do rather than turning our <br/>
backs on it.  And, when I say learning, I mean the learning for us as <br/>
parents and human beings.<br/>

credit card.&quot;  &quot;Now you may have your own checking account&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
There should never be such a thing as daytime curfew laws, where <br/>
people under a certain age are asked to prove why they&#39;re not in <br/>
school.  But there has to be a certain age where people are allowed <br/>
to answer for themselves as to why they&#39;re here or there instead of <br/>
being made to have their parents answer for them.  <br/>
<br/>
There should be clear cut ages when people are allowed to babysit, <br/>
instead of parents wondering if they&#39;ll get charged with neglect if <br/>
they let their mature 12 year old babysit their 2 year old.  <br/>
<br/>
Parents need to have more rights to say things like, &quot;My 12 year old <br/>
and I agree that he is mature enough to babysit our two year old&quot; and <br/>
not live in fear that the state will question that decision and <br/>
charge with neglect.  <br/>
<br/>
Parents need to have the right to say, &quot;You keep your room as messy <br/>
as you want and I&#39;m just going to shut the door&quot; without living in <br/>
fear that CYS will check the bedrooms and remove the child.  <br/>
<br/>
Parents need to have the right to research vaccinations and make the <br/>
best decision for their child regarding them.  The state shouldn&#39;t <br/>
have the right to over ride a parents&#39; vaccination decision, because <br/>
you know the state would always choose to shoot the child up with all <br/>
of the harmful substances that are in vaccinations.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-507476303"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Should a Christian family be forced to allow their child to wear a<br/>
&gt; &gt; satanic t-shirt or hold a seance in his bedroom?  Should parents be<br/>
&gt; &gt; forced to allow their children to have sex in their bedrooms?  Dress<br/>
&gt; &gt; like a prostitute?  Get 666 tattooed on their foreheads?  Use drugs?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Extreme examples, I know, but do you really think that parents<br/>
&gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t have any right ever to step in and say &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; just can&#39;t allow you to do this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess if this was my child, I hope that I wouldn&#39;t be focusing any energy on &quot;how can I control him/her and get him/her to do what I want&quot; <br/>
but rather &quot;why is my child choosing these things that i believe may be harmful to him/her (and are they *really* harmful?) and why has s/he rejected all the values which I hold most dear?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I think there may be some deep and uncomfortable answers there. No child wants to hurt themselves simply for the sake of hurting. children do want to learn life-affirming things from their parents. When a child chooses something that may be hurting them on one level (and again, i would question which choices are actually hurting them--though I include having to waste your energy on rebellion as hurting), they are, IMO, always doing so to protect a vital human need. <br/>
<br/>
In the case of a family who is trying to impose their strong ideals on a child through control rather than inspiration, my guess is that the child&#39;s needs for autonomy, freedom, respect, acceptance for who they are, belonging, love, and self-expression might be especially pronounced. In this case, I truly believe the solution lies in meeting those child&#39;s basic needs at their core, and not in even more control.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be happy to explain more if this is not clear.<br/>

they pick and choose based one whether people are female or not, Hispanic or <br/>
Black or not, whether they like their looks or not.<br/>
<br/>
There are MANY kids who know more about events and politics than many adults <br/>
do.<br/>

Voting is probably one of those calming things... An expensive exercise to <br/>
make us all feel like we have a voice in government.  But anyone who really <br/>
studies the issues and goes and votes  his informed conscience is swept away <br/>
by the others around him who are voting out of prejudice or party affiliation.<br/>

<br/>
Ingrid, you  have nailed it.  I loved your post.<br/>
<br/>
If children can&#39;t obtain their basic human needs at home, they will get them <br/>
met in other groups outside the home.  If they can&#39;t get their parents to <br/>
listen to words, maybe they will get them to read t-shirts.<br/>
<br/>
Of my grown friends who were forced to go to church every Sunday with their <br/>
families without any option to stay home, I can only think of two or three <br/>
who still go to church.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s easier in the Bible Belt to just tell children that they WILL do <br/>
what you say or else.  In less homogenous parts of the country, kids don&#39;t <br/>
have to go far to find people with other beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
So.  There&#39;s an argument to keeping your children isolated.  That&#39;s the main <br/>
suspicion of many homeschooling critics, that the parents are trying to keep <br/>
their kids isolated.<br/>
<br/>
GUESS, just guess in which group this is true?<br/>
Christian homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Long ago (ten years ago) when I was on Prodigy, the discussion was more like <br/>
a web newsgroup.  All the topics were posted where people had to go there and <br/>
read them.  And the topics weren&#39;t separated into threads very efficiently.  <br/>
And there was no separation between Christian and secular homeschooling.  <br/>
Occasionally a Christian would say &quot;If you&#39;re not Christian what are you <br/>
doing on a homeschooling discussion board?&quot;  And other things.  But there was <br/>
a discussion once in which one mom said she felt strongly that she only <br/>
wanted her children to socialize with Christian families&#39; children.   And <br/>
another mom came on not long after and said being Christian wasn&#39;t enough for <br/>
her.  She wanted to know what KIND of Christians they were.<br/>
<br/>
When a child who feels THAT confined wants out, ANY &quot;out&quot; is considered to be <br/>
following Satan, breaking commandments, and so why just go hang around with a <br/>
Catholic family if they can join a gang?  Because they DO have a need for <br/>
acceptance, and according to child psychologists, to Piaget and other <br/>
researchers in developmental stages, they come to need the approval of others <br/>
their age.<br/>
<br/>
It is natural for a teenager to start to leave the nest.   Too many Christian <br/>
parents feel they have a guarantee that if they &quot;do right&quot; that their <br/>
children will be obedient until they&#39;re 18 or 21 or something.  As though no <br/>
observations of human development apply to their Christian sons and <br/>
daughters, but they WILL be obedient and they WILL do what their parents say.<br/>
<br/>
Or what?<br/>

My daughter was crying last night in bed.  She is so upset that our <br/>
town wants to ban scooters and skateboards, and she is very worried <br/>
that all the hours we&#39;re putting into walking around town getting <br/>
signatures on a petition isn&#39;t going to make any difference.  I hope <br/>
she doesn&#39;t get the message at 9 years old that her efforts don&#39;t <br/>
make a difference. :(  <br/>
