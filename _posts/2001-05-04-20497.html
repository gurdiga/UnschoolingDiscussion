     *None.  Unless there is a problem, they can get up and dressed <br/>
by themselves, right?  If you have a special needs child, it would be <br/>
different, of course.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70667499">You work from home correct? Let the kids set their own schedule. Let them sleep as long as they need to, get up, get themselves some breakfast (sometimes) and they can decide what they want to do that day...whether its read a book, watch a tv program, do a puzzle, bake, build something, play outside. It doesn&#39;t matter as long as they are enjoying what they are doing. Yes, you do need to be available...but the kids would also understand if you are in the middle of a project that needed to be done first. They don&#39;t mind waiting for a few minutes until you can give them your complete attention for a few. Naomi sleeps as long as she needs to and wakes, eats, does whatever she wants that day. It is different each day. On the days when we do have to go somewhere at a certain time...I get her up and we hit the road. Tomorrow is a big day for us since I will be at a seminar at the church so we will be there for breakfast and lunch and her big sister will meet her there and take her out to watch a movie. So she&#39;s going to have some fun.<br/>

You have the PERFECT job for unschooling. One of the wonderful things <br/>
about unschooling is that everyone does what they want to do! I never <br/>
set Laurie up for anything. She got out of bed at her leisure and did <br/>
as she pleased all day (and night). I was always there for her, to <br/>
use me as she needed me. It worked great for both of us.<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; need to plan some specific time to be available or is it just all day long<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Around here, unschooling means just responding to what my kids are<br/>
interested in doing and facilitating them finding out whatever they want to<br/>
know. Activities of various sorts (library trips, parks, museums, etc.) are<br/>
a big part of our week, as are times to play with other kids. I honestly<br/>
don&#39;t know how that would work in with a full time work-from-home schedule.<br/>
I guess it would depend on what hours you planned on working (daytime or<br/>
nighttime, sporadic or continuous), and what sorts of things your kids are<br/>
interested in.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; how to explain to the kids what they can do, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmmm, not sure if I&#39;ve ever really said anything in explanation to my kids.<br/>
There&#39;s nothing much they *can&#39;t* do. Well, except hang from the chandeliers<br/>
and shave the cat, ya know stuff like that :-). I haven&#39;t run into the<br/>
situation yet where my kids are bored and out of ideas, if anything we seem<br/>
to have the opposite problem - too much to do and not enough time to do it.<br/>
If your kids are used to going to school, many people say that it will take<br/>
several months of basically doing nothing before they understand that they<br/>
can initiate their own projects and can learn whatever they want. In<br/>
between, you might expect some confusion and ennui.<br/>
<br/>
What to say? Maybe &quot;You&#39;re free!&quot; :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just all day long as needed. My husband and I have a home business so we tag<br/>
team a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Brit (6) wanders into bedroom/office: Mama, why does the moon have holes in<br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
Mom, hip deep in accounts for April, visions of throwing tea into Boston<br/>
Harbor to teach the IRS a lesson dancing in her head: Ummm...<br/>
<br/>
Dad, noting Mom&#39;s distraction, provides explanation. Brit, satisfied, asks<br/>
for ice cream. It&#39;s 7 a.m. She gets ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is just plain cool. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Okay, have at it&quot; is a fine way to start. &lt;g&gt; Of course, you need to make<br/>
sure there&#39;s plenty of &quot;it&quot; to &quot;have at&quot;. Books up the wazoo (if you don&#39;t<br/>
know where the wazoo is, please ask my husband &lt;bg&gt;), videos, arts and<br/>
crafts supplies, the community activities guide at your fingertips along<br/>
with the yellow pages, a homeschooling group, any or all and more.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun. They&#39;ll learn, you can&#39;t stop them. Not even when you&#39;re doing<br/>
taxes.<br/>
