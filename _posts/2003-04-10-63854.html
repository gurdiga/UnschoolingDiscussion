<div id="ygrps-yiv-831248173">As the weeks whiz by I am learning more and more about the testing <br/>
industry, more and more about this whole subject.  I know, or hope, <br/>
that on this list I am preaching to the choir, but if there is anyone <br/>
out there still sitting on the fence about testing, or rationalizing <br/>
that, well, their kid is good at it so who cares, or telling yourself <br/>
that if your kid wants to go to college you are going to have to <br/>
test, no choice, so why think about it, here are a few things to <br/>
think about:<br/>
<br/>
* Most companies in this industry (test scoring, BIG BUSINESS!) only <br/>
contract for a 70% agreement rate.  That means that when a specific <br/>
response is read by two different readers that they must agree on the <br/>
score 70% of the time.  Which means that they will disagree at least <br/>
30% of the time.  That means your kid has at least a reasonable <br/>
probability of having a 30% fudge rate on any test.  Fine if the <br/>
fudge goes your way, but not so fine if it goes agin&#39; em.<br/>
<br/>
* And that 30% fudge rate is only average.  On some very difficult to <br/>
score questions the rate may be closer to a 70% fudge rate.  Because <br/>
no matter how carefully the readers score the responses, some <br/>
questions are so badly written, and some rubrics defined by the <br/>
testing institution are so difficult to score, that the rate of <br/>
agreement drops like a rock.  The odds just keep getting worse.<br/>
<br/>
* Depending on what time of day your kid&#39;s test questions are scored <br/>
the degree of compliance with the defined rubric will vary <br/>
considerably.  First thing in the morning some readers are likely to <br/>
be half asleep, others over-caffeinized.  Don&#39;t know which is worse.  <br/>
At other times cyclical low blood sugar could account for all kinds <br/>
of variations in accuracy on reading and scoring responses.  And a <br/>
score of other factors, from room temperature, to barometric <br/>
pressure, to the war in Iraq, to the usual domestic issues in <br/>
anyone&#39;s life, will all affect the test scorer&#39;s ability.<br/>
<br/>
* Depending on when any one child&#39;s test is scanned into the system <br/>
readers must meet different scoring goals daily.  During the early <br/>
part of the reading contract for any one test they will have low <br/>
daily goals and may only be reading hundreds of responses a day, thus <br/>
able to read and score more carefully.  During the later days of the <br/>
contract goals may rise to thousands a day and scorers will be <br/>
pressured to read for volume and not accuracy or agreement.  This <br/>
pushes that 30%-70% fudge rate right through the basement.<br/>
<br/>
* Handwriting or hand-printing play a big part in scoring.  Those who <br/>
write infinitesimally are extremely difficult to read.  Scorers get <br/>
annoyed by these and may not read them as carefully (?) as others.  <br/>
And very messy handwriting definitely does not read well.  Test <br/>
readers are reading hundreds to thousands of different documents a <br/>
day and as the day wears on the more difficult they are to read the <br/>
less likely it is that they will get a fair reading.<br/>
<br/>
* Many test readers are taking all kinds of medication.  Many are <br/>
retired teachers and school administrators, supporting the AMA and <br/>
the American pharmaceutical industry on their retirement incomes with <br/>
a sack full of meds they take daily, if not hourly.  It is difficult <br/>
enough to do this type of job well with a clear unmedicated mind, but <br/>
those on medication may have even more difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
* Many test scoring contracts have a huge bonus ($$$$) for tests that <br/>
are completed before a certain date, thus rewarding companies for <br/>
speedy scoring rather than accuracy, even though accuracy is a myth <br/>
to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
Read Lemann&#39;s THE BIG TEST for more details on the whole meritrocracy <br/>
issue and do whatever you can to not only unschool, but to untest <br/>
your kids.  When you think about college degrees, therefore, think <br/>
about options and schools that do not give grades (Antioch, for one), <br/>
and ways of earning credit without testing.  And if your state gives <br/>
home educators the option of testing or anything else, pick anything <br/>
else!  <br/>
<br/>
If you really want a test score to submit here is what I suggest:<br/>
make up a bunch of questions of your own by picking some readings and <br/>
asking questions about those readings.  Tack the answers up on the <br/>
wall or a tree with numbers around the page.  Throw darts at the <br/>
pages.  Add up the numbers closest to where the darts land.  This <br/>
should pretty well give you the same validity as any handscored test <br/>
your kid could take.  <br/>
<br/>
Remember that many of these issues also apply to machine scored tests <br/>
due to poorly worded questions and poorly worded, if not totally <br/>
wrong, response choices.  <br/>
<br/>
So why do people insist on these tests?  Money, money, money!  And <br/>
elitism, meritocracy, as in &quot;my kid is better&#39;n your kid.&quot;  No other <br/>
reason to do this to children, and to waste such huge amounts of <br/>
taxpayers&#39; money.  Parents (taxpayers) need to revolt against this.  <br/>
Instead more and more testing is being mandated by the feds and the <br/>
state government.  More and more kids lives and self-esteem are being <br/>
challenged, if not seriously eroded, by all kinds of testing.  Who <br/>
runs this country, anyway?  We need to speak up and let our elected <br/>
representatives know how we feel about all this.  If anyone knows any <br/>
other good books on this subject please post info so that others can <br/>
read what has been written and use those &quot;expert&quot; sources to convince <br/>
our paid representatives that we aren&#39;t going to fund this kind of <br/>
rubbish anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
The one book I have consistently referred to is  THE BIG TEST:  THE <br/>
SECRET HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN MERITOCRACY by Nicholas Lemann.  <br/>
Anyone know of any other good ones?  The key word is &quot;secrecy.&quot;  All <br/>
of this industry is shrouded in secrecy so that most who subject <br/>
their kids and themselves to this kind of testing have no idea what <br/>
is really going on.  You do, at least you know more than most, so I <br/>
hope that some will speak out and let their representatives know what <br/>
a huge rip-off all this testing is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261545823">I read an enlightening article online a few weeks ago about the Bush and<br/>
McGraw families, and their vacation homes next to each other, and how<br/>
George W. and the President/C.E.O. of McGraw-Hill grew up together and<br/>
are close friends.  It chronicled the passing of the No Child Left<br/>
Behind Act and talked about how much money McGraw-Hill makes from their<br/>
standardized tests and their workbooks to prepare kids for standardized<br/>
tests, and their curriculums teaching to the tests.  You can&#39;t walk into<br/>
a Barnes and Noble or Borders kids&#39; section without seeing dozens of<br/>
McGraw-Hill Test Prep workbooks, prominently displayed.  Wish I&#39;d<br/>
bookmarked the article.  I think it was linked from a site about high<br/>
school kids who are protesting standardized tests.<br/>

&quot;education&quot;. Our governor just got elected because he wants &quot;tougher&quot; <br/>
schools---in every sense of the word, in every way! (Testing, discipline, <br/>
teachers, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a senator or congressman somewhere out west who said schools <br/>
suck, but ecucation is a very common platform. They&#39;re ALL into testing.<br/>

Just wondered if the book actually researched this part of it or is it just<br/>
making a blanket statement about retired people? Just seems very unfair to<br/>
say unless they actually know all the people who are test readers.<br/>

This does not come from a book but from a &quot;mole&quot; working in the <br/>
business.  And, no, not every senior working on a project is on tons <br/>
of meds, but plenty of them are.  And, yes, it does effect their <br/>
ability to think clearly sometimes, as do many of the other things I <br/>
mentioned in my post earlier.  <br/>
