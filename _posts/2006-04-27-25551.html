<div id="ygrps-yiv-569490739">Hi~<br/>
My DD (10+) is really taking off with her web skills and is interested <br/>
in all Graphic type learning. Has anyone studied graphic arts online, <br/>
she has photoshop 5 and has figured alot out on her own. There was a <br/>
cont. ed class offered at a local college, but they said she needed to <br/>
be 16+ so I started looking for other options.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone had any experience with this, she has out grown my <br/>
knowledge already!!! Yikes!<br/>
Thanks~ Tracy in SC</div>

message boards to communicate with the instructor and other students.<br/>

No one cares how old people are - sometimes they tell me and sometimes <br/>
not. :)  I&#39;ve had 8 year olds and 88 year olds in classes. <br/>
<br/>
CNET also offers some nice classes and I see they have some digital <br/>
photography and graphics classes right now. That&#39;s not my area! :)<br/>

Take care, c.<br/>
