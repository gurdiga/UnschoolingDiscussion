I hate to even jump into this one, because somebody will probably get mad.<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;m uncomfortable with the broadness of the above statement.  It<br/>
fails to take into account a significant percentage of the Christian<br/>
population who do not interpret the Bible literally.<br/>
<br/>
I know that we use &quot;Christian homeschoolers&quot; here to mean a particular group<br/>
of people doing a particular type of homeSCHOOLING, but I really hate to<br/>
lose the entire identity of Christianity to that one group of people.<br/>

<br/>
There are millions of mean Christian parents who don&#39;t even homeschool who <br/>
would consider &quot;the sovereignty of children&quot; to be blasphemous.<br/>
<br/>
I hope there are also millions who wouldn&#39;t.<br/>

&gt; I guess now the list will heat up (when the Christians get back from church <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This seems just a little provocative to me.  Do we have to get into Christian <br/>
bashing? There are many of us (Christians, that is) who do not fit the <br/>
stereotype of the &quot; Christian homeschooler.&quot; Many of us cringe at much of <br/>
what the religious right says and does; but generalized statements like the <br/>
one above casts all of us in the same boat. That isn&#39;t reality.<br/>
