<div id="ygrps-yiv-493841650">I just saw what I originally thought was a very cool commercial on Cartoon <br/>
Network.  It begins: &quot;The day is coming, when your parents will FORCE you to go <br/>
back to school, face the dangers of the school bus and avoid the dangerous <br/>
cheerleaders&quot; ... (a blurb about a *fake* insurance policy) then, &quot;join us for <br/>
Don&#39;t Go Back to School Day&quot; a bunch of cartoons showing the reasons NOT to go <br/>
to school will be shown on Monday.  Ending with a silly disclaimer stating <br/>
there is no such insurance policy and &quot;kids, you need to go to school if you don&#39;t <br/>
want to end up a bum or in jail&quot; AARRGGHH!  We will definitely watch the <br/>
cartoons, as it is funny to see the cartoon horrors of school, but I&#39;m really sad <br/>
the channel had to end it with *go to school anyway* propaganda ~ could they <br/>
at least proclaim their envy of those who DON&#39;T have to go back to school???  <br/>

&quot;Education- compulsory schooling, compulsory learning- is a tyranny and a <br/>
crime against the human mind and spirit.  Let all those escape it who can, any <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-377279562">How about starting the cable unschoolers network......all fun all the<br/>
time; with the occasional documentary on people educated IRL not ITC<br/>
(&quot;in the classroom&quot;)?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240683654">Jaiden has been listening to those commercials all week. He&#39;s been telling everyone how lucky we are, since he never has to go to school, we never have to worry about his papa going to jail because he forgot to buy the dumb school insurance. That way we have way more money to spend on fun stuff, like the rocket car he&#39;s sure he will find if we let him go into the &#39;employes only&#39; section of Toys R Us, &#39;cause ya know they have everything there, a kid could ever want. ;^)<br/>
