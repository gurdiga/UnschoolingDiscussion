<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704504157">Carol, I am with you here!  It&#39;s exactly this with my eldest, but I let it<br/>
go with the younger one?! :-(  Ah, well, the more I know myself, the easier<br/>
I&#39;ll be on them!  Oh, and I cringe when dh talks to the kids how I don&#39;t<br/>
want to, nut sometimes do!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Andi, and others, when this happens (and I think it happens to every parent!!), I change the plans!!� This is my FAVORITE part of homeschooling.� Sometimes, the boys just aren&#39;t going to do what I have in mind....usually, for my family, this is a sign they need some physical activity....so it is out the door we go for a bike ride, walk or rollar blading.� If it is raining, we will put on the dancin&#39; music and get silly together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This drives my dh nuts.� When he makes &#39;plans&#39; he wants to stick to them.� For some things, we have to stick to the plan (like a scheduled outing or party or some such thing).� But if it is a day that we were going to actually be home...I prefer to be flexible.� Sometimes I don&#39;t feel like doing certain things...and when I force myself, I am miserable.� I try not to do this to the kids (&#39;cuz then they make ME miserable!!� *G*)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am relieved to hear that their are other night owls out there!� Our dd has always prefered late nights to early mornings, I&#39;m the same way!� Dh is not thrilled though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt; Some of our best &quot;stuff&quot; happens<br/>
&gt; �&gt;late at night - just the way we are!� &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My 11 yo son is a night owl, and he gets in some of his most talkative,<br/>
&gt; thoughtful moods after 11 pm.� OTOH, my 7 mo son gets up between 6:30 and 7<br/>
&gt; am - so I don&#39;t always have energy for the 11 pm discussions.� I try though<br/>
&gt; &lt;wan grin&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I too would miss some of the late night times we have had!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sounds like you only get a few hours sleep at night! My 6yo goes to bed no<br/>
&gt; earlier than 9:45 most nights. His best and most productive &quot;schoolish&quot;<br/>
&gt; hours (reading, talking, puzzle books) are between 8 and 10 P.M.� But at<br/>
&gt; least he sleeps past 8 most mornings. He established this pattern early as<br/>
&gt; a baby and hasn&#39;t changed. We couldn&#39;t keep up this schedule if we were<br/>
&gt; going to public school, and we&#39;d miss so many special talks at night.<br/>
