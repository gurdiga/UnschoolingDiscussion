<br/>
But he&#39;s not talking about  us. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
This is where you&#39;re wrong. He *IS* talking about us! Because they lump all  <br/>
of us together as &quot;homeschoolers&quot;---and people like Helen Hegener, who is ALSO <br/>
 trying to lump us all together---- and make us all one big happy group.<br/>
 <br/>
And again, I&#39;ll scream! &lt;g&gt;: I insist that we&#39;re NOT homeschoolers to  anyone <br/>
that asks. I insist that we&#39;re UNschoolers because it matters to me that  we <br/>
NOT be lumped together with those freaks.<br/>
 <br/>
They have a huge lobby, through  H$LDA, that is VERY visible and loud.  They <br/>
spend lots of money and manpower on articles like this one----even  though <br/>
it&#39;s not all peachy-keen and good----because it may inspire MORE freaks  to join <br/>
their cause. They don&#39;t care how we all look to the outside world if  they can <br/>
recruit another freaky family.<br/>
 <br/>
It only hurts *US*. Unschoolers aren&#39;t visible enough or loud enough (yet!  <br/>
&lt;G&gt; give me time! &lt;g&gt;) to counter these stupid beliefs. &quot;Normal&quot;  people read <br/>
that and say, &quot;See, Thelma! ALL them homeschoolers are just a  bunch of crazy <br/>
freaks who want to take over the country and rule the world  through the Bible. <br/>
Bunch of freaks!&quot;. Hell, *I* say the same things!<br/>
 <br/>
As long as all homeschoolers are lumped together, then he IS talking about  <br/>
us.<br/>
 <br/>
~Kelly, do NOT call me a homeschooling mom!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bravo, Kelly, for saying this.  I think for a long time we were the <br/>
ones who were scared- scared of the truant officers, scared of child <br/>
welfare, scared of our relatives.  But unschooling has gone from the <br/>
theoretical to the practical.  The country is full of kids who were <br/>
unschooled who are doing just fine, thank you.  Yet still we tend to <br/>
be so quiet.<br/>
<br/>

represent what we do in academic terms, we are denying the power and <br/>
beauty of unschooling.  We&#39;re misrepresenting what we do when we say <br/>
that gardening is botany or cooking is math.  It&#39;s not the same at <br/>
all.  It&#39;s like someone who lives in Mexico for 4 years and comes <br/>
back speaking Spanish fluently yet cannot conjugate a verb to save <br/>
their life compared to someone who studied Spanish in school for 4 <br/>
years and can the conjugate the heck out any verb yet can&#39;t hold a <br/>
two minute conversation at a four year old level.<br/>
<br/>
We are the fluent ones.  Live and learning all meld together in our <br/>
lives to create wise, knowledgable and capable children and adults.  <br/>
We need to start letting people know.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HSLDA didn&#39;t spend any money or manpower on this series of articles - <br/>
some HSLDA people were interviewed, just like I was and others were. I <br/>
am quite certain that they are not at all happy with the way the <br/>
articles came out.<br/>
<br/>
HSLDA attorney, Scott Sommerville, arranged for me to be on that panel <br/>
in San Diego, knowing that I&#39;d criticize HSLDA and knowing that I&#39;d <br/>
make it clear that I had nothing in common with their way of thinking <br/>
other than that my kids don&#39;t go to school and that I want freedom for <br/>
parents to raise their kids as they see fit - limited only by specific <br/>
situations of abuse. He knew I&#39;d be better able to defend against Rob <br/>
Reich&#39;s accusations than he would - although I must admit that he <br/>
talked about his family&#39;s long-time involvement in the civil rights <br/>
movement, which was a darn good counter to Rob, too.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Sandra that we shouldn&#39;t cover up what I think of as the <br/>
ugly underbelly of homeschooling - the rigid, ignorant, punitive <br/>
nonthinking extremists who call themselves Christian Homeschoolers. In <br/>
the interest of being credible, we should not pretend they don&#39;t exist. <br/>
But also in the interest of being credible, we should paint HSLDA only <br/>
with the brushes that it deserves - which is more than enough. But <br/>
they&#39;re not responsible for the journalism in this series of articles - <br/>
let&#39;s give the journalists the credit they deserve, too. The series is <br/>
awful - they missed a HUGE chance to talk about learning and the <br/>
diversity of homeschoolers and what schools could learn from how <br/>
children develop when they&#39;re set free of artificial constraints, and <br/>
so on. Instead the journalists chose to focus on the stuff that breeds <br/>
suspicion and hostility and fear - homeschoolers are racists, they&#39;re <br/>
child abusers, they&#39;re noncustodial parents who are hiding children <br/>
from their ex-spouses, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is SO true, Holly. What a GREAT analogy.<br/>
<br/>
It is schools who screwed up the meanings of these things. Botany IS <br/>
fooling with plants, learning about them, working with them. Math is <br/>
fooling with numbers or shapes or measurements, etc. These are what <br/>
botanists or mathematicians do. What we&#39;re not doing is school subjects <br/>
- studying &quot;about&quot; it - but we ARE doing the real thing. The person who <br/>
lived in Mexico really DID do Spanish, as opposed to someone who took a <br/>
Spanish class in school.<br/>
