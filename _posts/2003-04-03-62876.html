 I think the poem is sad.  Just for tonight, implies that the things<br/>
 being done in this poem, aren&#39;t done very often.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, the point is that if you look at each day, each moment right now, instead <br/>
of trying  to project too far, you will be living for right now.<br/>
It&#39;s much better to say &quot;just for tonight&quot; and approach this very moment as <br/>
the only one that matters.<br/>
It&#39;s very Zenlike that way.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
