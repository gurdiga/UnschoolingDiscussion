&gt;     My friend I&#39;ll tell ya a story,<br/>
&gt;     If you&#39;ll lend me your ears,<br/>
&gt;     About my AOL wife,<br/>
&gt;     And my AOL fears.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     I once had a wife,<br/>
&gt;     Who was all warm and cuddly,<br/>
&gt;     Then we got a computer,<br/>
&gt;     And friend--it turned ugly!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     She loaded up AOL,<br/>
&gt;     With 500 free hours,<br/>
&gt;     And that&#39;s when I noticed,<br/>
&gt;     Things beginning to sour.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Now there she sits,<br/>
&gt;     For hours on end,<br/>
&gt;     Don&#39;t care where I&#39;m goin,<br/>
&gt;     Or where I have been.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     I could be home,<br/>
&gt;     Or I could be gone,<br/>
&gt;     She really don&#39;t care,<br/>
&gt;     As long as she&#39;s on...(line, that is)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     After work she rushes home,<br/>
&gt;     To she what she&#39;s missed,<br/>
&gt;     But its not to see me,<br/>
&gt;     She doesn&#39;t care if I&#39;m pissed!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     To say Hi to her buddies,<br/>
&gt;     Who bout live in that &quot;room,&quot;<br/>
&gt;     While this place needs a mop...<br/>
&gt;     And maybe a broom!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     She spoke to me once,<br/>
&gt;     When she got bumped offline,<br/>
&gt;     Just to ask me the number,<br/>
&gt;     Of the Tech Support line.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     So I&#39;ll just drink me a beer,<br/>
&gt;     And watch some TV,<br/>
&gt;     And wonder just why,<br/>
&gt;     She&#39;s not talkin to me!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     She sits there each day,<br/>
&gt;     GOD I NEED A LIFE-<br/>
&gt;     But that&#39;s how it adds up,<br/>
&gt;     When you have an AOL wife...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     So I sat here and pondered,<br/>
&gt;     Just what I could do...<br/>
&gt;     Then I got me a screen name,<br/>
&gt;     And now I&#39;m online TOO!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     So I guess there&#39;s a moral,<br/>
&gt;     here somewhere for life,<br/>
&gt;     When I need her for sonething,<br/>
&gt;     I just &quot;IM&quot; my wife! </span></blockquote></div>
