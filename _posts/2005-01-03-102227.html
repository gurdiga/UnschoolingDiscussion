<div id="ygrps-yiv-135329870">The Missouri law states a certain number of hours have to be within 5  <br/>
required subjects, Math, Science, Social Studies, Reading, and Language Arts.  <br/>
Normally, I just write on slips of paper what I observe my kids doing.  And  all <br/>
those papers go into a box.  <br/>
 <br/>
Well, I thought I better get these things into a more organized fashion for  <br/>
MY peace of mind.<br/>
I hauled out all these papers and the box just before Christmas.   There I <br/>
was, sorting my observations out, math, reading, blah, blah, blah.   Since I <br/>
have to catch up for 3 years, the pile is mighty big :)<br/>
 <br/>
I made a large dent in it, still have a ways to go.  Every so often,  my kids <br/>
have poked their heads into my work.  I explained Missouri law, and  I have <br/>
to organize all this data.<br/>

Last Saturday, Thomas (my 12y) comes bouncing up, &quot;Mom, I want to study  <br/>
Math! Let&#39;s play Monopoly!!!&quot;<br/>
