about rules.<br/>
<br/>
A close longtime friend of mine, Jeff (for those of you who know me or Jeff <br/>
&lt;g&gt;), is married to someone who&#39;s stricter than I like, and sometimes stricter <br/>
than Jeff likes.  His kids are younger than mine.  We talk.  I told Jeff kids <br/>
can&#39;t break rules when there are principles instead of rules, and he said we <br/>
MUST have rules, we just like to call them principles.  <br/>
<br/>
I said no, they weren&#39;t rules, but we had regular practices which are just <br/>
accepted, like if I wake up and a kid is gone, there&#39;s e-mail or a note.  If <br/>
someone takes the kitchen trash out, they replace the bag.  He said then those <br/>
are rules.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think they are.  I&#39;d love to discuss that here.<br/>
<br/>
Ben Lovejoy, Kelly&#39;s husband, did a workshop on principles at the conference <br/>
in August.  While Ben was talking, I felt really confident.  It helps lots <br/>
that Ben has a military background and he KNOWS rules, and he feels he&#39;s living <br/>
with principles.  <br/>
<br/>
Jeff is from an academic background (both parents college prof-types though <br/>
he himself became an engineer, though he could have a PhD in history without <br/>
even breathing hard, probably just with stuff he has around the house &lt;g&gt;), and <br/>
could easily be already on the trail to few rules in life.   He&#39;s not, though.<br/>
<br/>
And as to my two non-rules, yesterday I threw something (a paper towel) in <br/>
the trashere was no bag in the trash can.   She looked in, and there were TWO <br/>
pieces of trash.  I got a bag, she got the trash out, Keith (who was in the <br/>
room) said &quot;Oh, I guess I didn&#39;t replace the bag; sorry.&quot;  Holly held the trash <br/>
while I got the bag in, put the trash back in, and nobody was &quot;in trouble.&quot;  It <br/>
was no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I got up early this morning and went to gaze upon the children in their beds <br/>
(or at least to get some juice out of the fridge, and on the way...   <br/>
<br/>
I usually gaze upon Holly and Kirby&#39;s closed doors, but Kirby&#39;s door was <br/>
open.  He never sleeps with his door open.  And a little light was flashing.  So I <br/>
turned the hall light on and peeked in.  No extra futons on the floor.  Dog <br/>
on the bed (typical) and one human form.  Cell phone on the floor.  Kirby <br/>
doesn&#39;t have a cell phone.  Shape smaller than Kirby.  Looks like his friend Eric.  <br/>
I turned the light off.   <br/>
<br/>
The door to the library (big garage-sized room, not coincidentally over the <br/>
garage) was pulled shut (sliding door) but the light was on.  I listened; <br/>
quiet.  I turned the light off, nobody objected.  I thought maybe Kirby wasn&#39;t <br/>
home.  He worked until 1:00 a.m. and had my van.  <br/>
<br/>
The van&#39;s outside.  Their friend Brett&#39;s truck (or someone&#39;s truck) is <br/>
outside.  <br/>
<br/>
I figure some fell asleep with the light on, in the library.<br/>
<br/>
I could go up there and see if Kirby&#39;s home, but when I was Kirby&#39;s age I was <br/>
in college and sometimes NOT home.  Kirby is way calmer, less involved with <br/>
the opposite sex, and less needy of being gone than I was at his age.  If he&#39;s <br/>
not up there, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s somewhere reasonable and safe.  If he IS up there, <br/>
why wake him and at least one other teen up at 6:00 a.m.?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I thought.<br/>
<br/>
One more story before I leave this for others to analyze or expand upon:  the <br/>
dog&#39;s water dish is in the kitchen, and for the third time in a week, it was <br/>
not so clean and not so full (dry or nearly dry with dissolving dry dog food <br/>
in it).   I picked it up to rinse and fill it, and Marty (14, and the dog owner <br/>
of record) was in the room.  I thought quickly through some options of what <br/>
to say.  I have little pulldown menus like the Terminator sometimes.  Not <br/>
always, but sometimes.   <br/>
<br/>
This time I think I picked a good one.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;Maybe you&#39;re changing the dog&#39;s water every day, but if so you might <br/>
want to do it twice a day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I liked that one.  It was useful, yet subtle.  I wasn&#39;t mean and he didn&#39;t <br/>
feel &quot;told.&quot;   I didn&#39;t say &quot;never&quot; and I didn&#39;t say &quot;always,&quot; I just said <br/>
&quot;more.&quot;<br/>

 <br/>
***I don&#39;t think they are.  I&#39;d love to discuss that here.***<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks (months?) ago there was a rules vs. principles discussion on<br/>
another list. <br/>
One person had to look up both words in order to make her point they<br/>
meant &quot;exactly&quot; the same thing, and then, didn&#39;t make her point.<br/>
<br/>
A principle internally motivates you to do the things that seem good and<br/>
right.  People develop principles by living with people with principles<br/>
and seeing the real benefits of such a life. <br/>
A rule externally compels you, through force, threat or punishment, to do<br/>
the things someone else has deemed good or right.   People follow or<br/>
break rules. <br/>
<br/>
Which is the hope most parents  have for their kids?   Do they hope their<br/>
kids will comply with and follow rules, or do they hope their kids will<br/>
live their lives making choices that are good and right?<br/>
<br/>
Most people heard sometime, somewhere &quot;we have to have rules&quot; and they<br/>
swallowed it because they were punished if they didn&#39;t, and so, here they<br/>
are today, talking about rules without any thought to what rules really<br/>
are.    <br/>
<br/>
For a lot of people, thinking too deeply about what they believe is too<br/>
painful.  It&#39;s just easier to do what was done to them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918017481">It seems to me that rules control others and principles guide them.  Hence, (there&#39;s a PhD word&lt;g&gt;) if rules, I don&#39;t have to think for myself.  Like in a school setting - bells rings, stand up, move, sit down, write this, look here, look there.  Jail, military, school - all very rule bound.  And from what I&#39;ve seen the bastion of free-thought and academic freedom is actually very rule-bound - Universities, with their flavour of &quot;teachers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Principles, on other hand, are guides to respectful living, freedom, and openness. We can value completely different interpretations of the principles.  In his book on how to a volunteer board that works, John Carver (ironically also a PhD) points out that setting guidelines allows &quot;any reasonable interpretation&quot; of a broad guideline, rather than tying the organization up in knots with rule books.<br/>
<br/>
The best **theoretical** example I&#39;ve heard of is the way the US congress governs the Pres.  Broad guidelines, like &quot;commonly accepted practices.&quot;  They don&#39;t tie him tight with a rulebook. Not sure that it really works that way, or works that well as a form of governance, but it may form an example.<br/>
<br/>
As in Sandra&#39;s example, it seems to me that she lives by setting those guidelines, accepts reasonable interpretations, and make suggestions to help the kids (others?) live more fully.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Jail, military, school - all very rule bound.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I understand that those would have rules, too.<br/>
<br/>
When I was teaching I had a rule that I didn&#39;t want writing turned in on <br/>
notebook paper torn out of a spiral, with all the fringe on it.  A pile of 130 of <br/>
those is a big pile, and I trailed litter (a $300 fine in New Mexico &lt;g&gt;).   <br/>
If they used spiral paper, they needed to cut that edge off.  I had scissors <br/>
for them to use.  I would give them plain notebook paper too, if they didn&#39;t <br/>
have any.   Some of the kids acted like I was ruining their lives saying &quot;cut <br/>
that edge off or I don&#39;t want it.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind following rules.  The principle that it&#39;s best to do what others <br/>
need you to do in a situation covers that. &lt;g&gt;   I obey most of the laws of <br/>
which I&#39;m aware (though it&#39;s been years since I filed a statement of intent to <br/>
homeschool, and Holly reads speed limit signs to me sometimes in a meaningful <br/>
way).<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t mind following rules when they join clubs or attend meetings in <br/>
places with rules.  The anime store where they play (and where Kirby came to <br/>
work after a while) has a language rule.  They can say &quot;crap&quot; but nothing else <br/>
of its sort or worse.  There&#39;s a 25 cent fine.  If they don&#39;t have a quarter <br/>
they do pushups.   But because of that rule, families go there that wouldn&#39;t <br/>
go if it had the atmosphere of a sleazy bowling alley.  (It has the atmosphere <br/>
of a geeky gaming store.)<br/>
<br/>
I think one reason they don&#39;t mind following rules is that they haven&#39;t <br/>
already &quot;had it up to here&quot; with rules, as kids have who have a whole life of home <br/>
rules and school rules.  They find rules kind of fascinating and charming, <br/>
honestly.   When Holly&#39;s had a dress code for a dance class or acting class she <br/>
is THRILLED.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe also because they haven&#39;t been forced to take classes or go to gaming <br/>
shops (?!?) they know they&#39;re there voluntarily and part of the contract is <br/>
that they abide by the rules.   No problem.<br/>
<br/>
Probably some families make rules so that their kids will learn to follow <br/>
rules.  It&#39;s possible.  Too much practice can kill the joy, though.  Being forced <br/>
to play an instrument can create an adult who doesn&#39;t even bother to own one <br/>
of the instruments he knows how to play, because how he&#39;s out of school he <br/>
doesn&#39;t &quot;have to.&quot;  If someone made me practice eating before every meal, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be very hungry.<br/>
<br/>
So here I have kids who can sleep as long as they want, who set their alarms <br/>
and get up; who have all kinds of clothes and no rules, who dress well and <br/>
appropriately to the situation; who don&#39;t have to come home but they DO come home.<br/>
<br/>
Something important is happening.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090647674">Well, for what it&#39;s worth...I&#39;ve been following these threads lately about chores, rules, responsibilities, spanking (&quot;training&quot;) vs. not spanking, etc. <br/>
 <br/>
What it made me realize is that while we rarely if ever spank..I do yell entirely way too much at the children. A large part of this has been because I suffer from a chronic depression that is made worse due to being post-partum. I was supposed to be on Paxil again immediately after delivering Gracie but suffered superficial blood clots, a pulmonary embolism and then I developed a DVT. I&#39;m on Coumadin for another three months because of it, and coumadin interacts with just about everything.<br/>
 <br/>
However, these discussions did help me to realize that in order to better effectively parent my children I needed to be back on the Paxil if at all possible with the coumadin. Yelling and screaming all the time..seeing my children&#39;s faces as they didn&#39;t understand why I was being so mean...and a couple of times my older child (the one who has been spanked most in her life, albeit not for quite awhile) even literally cowering crouched with her hands in the air to protect herself thinking that I was about to hit her...YIKES! That got to me...and I could hear the echos of these conversations, my own inner sense of right and wrong and ultimately knowing that Jesus Christ would not be yelling at these children like I was. <br/>
 <br/>
SO I bit back pride and everything else and we&#39;ve had a pretty wonderful week with me back on the medications. It&#39;s easier now to keep to not spanking, and while like I said we keep that option open..we really rarely would need to spank...<br/>
 <br/>
ANYWAY I think I&#39;m rambling...things are not really going good here unschooling wise in that my husband wants us to return to more structured academics and actually so does Sarah. I&#39;m going to try to keep it very informal though, just making sure she does some mathematics and writing each day but as dissimilar to school work as I can make it. <br/>
 <br/>
I could use some help figuring out how to do more academics to keep him happy, but as little as possible to keep us happy. Sarah does like workbooks and she&#39;ll do them in bits and spurts. I have to show a portfolio at the end of the year but I&#39;m not really worried about pulling that together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-68286922">Here&#39;s one that have happened last night / this morning:<br/>
<br/>
Joseph (he&#39;s 11) has been staying up late for a couple months.  We have asked him to please turn off the lights before he goes to sleep.  But it&#39;s not a &quot;rule&quot;.  If the rule was to be allowed to stay up late, you must turn off all the lights before you go to sleep, we&#39;d be having regular conflicts about it.  But having the principle of not wasting money, allows us to work towards it together, not against each other.  Since I first mentioned it to him he&#39;s been pretty good about it .. I&#39;d say 70% of the time I get up in the morning the lights are off.  When they are left on, I understand that he probably got really tired, or was distracted by something he was doing and forgot.  I know he&#39;s not leaving them on just to piss me off.  I&#39;ll usually mention sometime the next day that I noticed a lot of lights on when I got up and could please try and remember to turn them off.  That&#39;s it - no hassle, no shame.  Last night around 1:30am when I woke up and wandered back to my bed from my daughter&#39;s I noticed that many lights were on (we have an open staircase) and I gently called to him.  He was in the TV room and came immediately.  I asked if he could please do the rounds and turn off the lights in the rooms he wasn&#39;t in, and he did right away without a word or a huff and went back to what he was doing.  Just living together in peace.  It made me smile while I went back to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I still think regularly about a conversation I had with my mother a few months ago ... I think it was her first real glimpse that we were doing something quite different.  I was telling her how we discuss and explain things with the kids (principles), and she said that there must be something they have to do just because I say so (rules).  I said no, if there was something I would like the kids to do, I ask them and explain why .. there is always a reason for something, so just tell them.  If they choose not to do it, I know they have considered what I said and they usually let me know their reasons (and they are usually quite understandable from their POV).  She tried a couple of examples, and I explained what I&#39;d say to the kids, then in a bit of frustration she gave up and said she couldn&#39;t think of anything right then.  And she hasn&#39;t brought it up since.<br/>
<br/>
Just for completeness (I don&#39;t think we got this far in our conversation), if there&#39;s no real choice for the kids (like having to get someone somewhere), I explain that too and let them know I understand that they really don&#39;t want to go, but that I appreciate them doing it anyway.  And I try to show it by doing something extra of their choice, either while we&#39;re out or later when we get home.  This almost always works out without great anger or tantrums, because they trust me and know that I have always tried my best to minimize the times they would have to do something they don&#39;t like just because there is no other choice.  That&#39;s the principle I have of trying to live life without having a negative impact on the people around me, not the rule of if I say you have do something, you do it.<br/>
<br/>
The concept of rules vs. principles has really helped me shift my thinking.  It&#39;s given me a good place to start when thinking situations through.  Whenever I think that there is something I want my kids (or my husband for that matter)  to do, I ask myself why?  And when I get to the root of why, I can either explain it well to them, or come to the realization that it really has nothing to do with them, just some holdover of schoolish expectations, and I can let it go.  <br/>

I&#39;m unwilling to make my kids feel a lot worse for life just to make my <br/>
husband feel a little better for a short while.<br/>

Give him some reading and if he refuses to read, he&#39;s bowed off the committee <br/>
to decide how to homeschool (in my thinking).<br/>

begin to &quot;do&quot; (inflict) even a small amount of traditional instruction on <br/>
your children just for Dad&#39;s sake.<br/>
<br/>
       Finally I figured it would be better to unschool Dad, which it has <br/>
worked  pretty well. We all found ways to suck him into what the kids already are <br/>
excited about, so he had the chance to support and be involved in these <br/>
activities, and could realize in the process how much was happening of value. <br/>
<br/>
       Before we stumbled on the unschooling-of-Dad approach, we had a couple <br/>
of spectacular disasters because Dad was really pushing some &quot;academics&quot; in <br/>
one area, arithmetic (he was worried because our first child, a brilliant, <br/>
creative little girl, didn&#39;t want to do any.) <br/>
<br/>
    The recent chores discussion here reminded me how trying to do that <br/>
little bit of &quot;academics&quot; almost turned our happy unschooling into a daily chore to <br/>
be dreaded and math into a major nightmare. WHAT was I thinking?? Well, that <br/>
maybe some academics in our unschooling would keep Dad happy . . .   JJ<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-736929319">&lt;&lt;Do others here have contributions of examples for me?  Thanks in advance.<br/>
Sandra, the crazed collector&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This thread is giving me an opening for some thoughts that I have been<br/>
having since the conference. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was sorry that the Rules vs Principles presentation was so short - it<br/>
seemed like we only scratched the surface of this idea. It was one that I<br/>
had trouble coming to grips with. Not having rules is the easy part.<br/>
Articulating principles seemed really difficult. I kept believing that I<br/>
needed to do in life, what we were doing as an exercise at the conference -<br/>
translate every rule into the jargon of principles. I fear the exercise at<br/>
the conference may have led new or considering unschoolers to feel just as<br/>
Sandra&#39;s friend does - &quot;it&#39;s just rules expressed more gently&quot;. I know<br/>
there&#39;s a difference, but we didn&#39;t seem to have enough time to really get<br/>
into it that day. I hope we hear more from Ben at the next one.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I mentioned to Ben after the presentation that one idea about the difference<br/>
was that Rules often seem to be aimed at the children, whereas Principles<br/>
were for the benefit of the entire family.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In the language of Recovery, Spiritual Principles are single words, the<br/>
opposite of character defects. Words like Honesty, Generosity, Courtesy,<br/>
Compassion and Kindness. Keeping children safe might be part of the<br/>
principle of Security or Confidence. Once I was reminded of the single words<br/>
concept, it became much easier to grasp principles instead of rules. I<br/>
stopped thinking of them as needing to be grand mission statements defining<br/>
the family&#39;s sweeping purpose (image of Scarlett O&#39;Hara holding her muddy<br/>
fist to the sky - &quot;As God is my witness...&quot;) and stopped feeling like I was<br/>
just missing the idea.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In dealing with Jayn, I try to give her reasonable and likely scenarios in<br/>
the form of &quot;If you do x, y or z may happen&quot;. She often replies with &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
going to do it anyway&quot;. If it is a question of safety, I try to refrain from<br/>
the almost useless and sure to lead to a fall, &quot;Be careful&quot;, and say<br/>
something specific like &quot;I&#39;m worried that .&quot; or &quot;That has a really pointy<br/>
end&quot;. Sometimes my struggle is to avoid merely &quot;because I don&#39;t like it&quot; as<br/>
the reason she should desist. I have to examine why I want it to stop - am I<br/>
tired, pre-mentrual, excessively worried about the opinion of some neighbor,<br/>
momentarily locked in a childhood moment revisited? One of my fears is that,<br/>
in the absence of punishment (she has never been punished), she will see my<br/>
disapproval as the punishment. Still a work in progress. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes if I am bugged I leave the room. For example: Jayn loves to pour<br/>
water out of the tub onto the floor of the bathroom or throw it around. This<br/>
leaves a mess that is both a pain to clean up, and dangerously slippery, but<br/>
I think it bugs me for some other subconscious reason that I haven&#39;t been<br/>
able to unearth. Jayn often won&#39;t stop when I ask her to, and it seems<br/>
punitive to pull her out of the tub as I have done in the past. If I made a<br/>
&quot;no pouring&quot; rule, almost every bath would turn into a war. Instead I<br/>
surrendered to her desire to experiment with water. I&#39;m so much happier. I<br/>
put down some extra towels as bathmats - this takes care of the principle of<br/>
a safe environment (Comfort and Security); I move the magazines etc out of<br/>
harm&#39;s way - this takes care of the principle of caring for other people&#39;s<br/>
things (Consideration); and I wait within earshot, in the next room - this<br/>
takes care of the principle of self care (can&#39;t think of &quot;single word&quot; right<br/>
now). The bonus reward is listening to her enjoy the fantasy play with her<br/>
dolls, cups, fish, other toys and kitchen utensils. Sometimes she says she<br/>
is lonely and wants me in there. She gets to choose not to splash me where I<br/>
am sitting if she wants me in the room with her. I remind her she can throw<br/>
the water at the wall by the tub instead. Of course I could also purchase a<br/>
shower curtain for the tub, which could move the play in a whole new<br/>
direction.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I know I have more on RvsP - the story of last week at Dance class, and<br/>
James&#39; one rule with Jayn. I want to read some more first.<br/>

I&#39;d just have to say &quot;Then I wasn&#39;t verbally persuasive enough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jeff knows Marty really well.   He&#39;s been around his whole life, has <br/>
entrusted him with his house to housesit, and was not disappointed.  SCA-wise, he&#39;s <br/>
thinking of making Marty his squire.  So realistically, he wouldn&#39;t ask that <br/>
question.  We&#39;ve camped together lots, and Marty&#39;s always the most helpful of the <br/>
kids, and now that he&#39;s adult-size, he&#39;s extremely useful with tents and <br/>
rope-related things.<br/>
<br/>
So the idea that Marty would casually or pointedly refuse to give the dog <br/>
more water wouldn&#39;t come up in this particular real-life case.<br/>
<br/>
In theory, it could.  With people new to unschooling sites they always ask <br/>
those really stunning questions like &quot;What if he just never wants to learn to <br/>
count?&quot; or &quot;What if they choose not to learn to read?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But my personal real answer to &quot;And what if after you suggest that to him he <br/>
never takes your advice?&quot;  would be &quot;Then I&#39;ll keep the water dish clean and <br/>
full and try not to resent the kid.&quot;  It&#39;s not realistic, though, in my real <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with what others have said here regarding DH.  If he&#39;s not <br/>
willing to learn about unschooling or to observe your children <br/>
learning in a real, though to him unconventional, way, then you <br/>
should discuss with him that since he&#39;s not home a lot, this should <br/>
be left in your hands.<br/>
<br/>
As far as your older child wanting to return to structure, there may <br/>
be more to that than just a desire to learn academic subjects.  You <br/>
have a new baby, you&#39;re dealing with postpartum depression on top of <br/>
a chronic depression problem, you&#39;re experiencing other health <br/>
problems that necessitate trips to the doctor, and dad&#39;s away a lot <br/>
of the time.  Maybe this desire for more structure is just her way of <br/>
voicing another need.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been through this with my own young children, and it is my <br/>
oldest who sometimes feels left out because my brain, body, and <br/>
spirit are spent in many different directions.  If there were a way <br/>
to get some one-on-one with her, that might be the solution instead <br/>
of returning to structured academics (I just see *that* as <br/>
exascerbating the depression...BTDT).  Maybe choose a project that <br/>
the two of you can work on, or take her out to lunch (I know, this is <br/>
sometimes difficult with many young children), or explore something <br/>
that fascinates her.  It&#39;s worth a try, and you&#39;re fostering a <br/>
connection with your daughter that will last for a lifetime. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, there&#39;s nothing wrong with playing with workbooks, too, <br/>
esp. if that&#39;s her desire.  My son (7) just did what I consider to be <br/>
about a month&#39;s worth of math work in two afternoons.  He is great <br/>
with mental math, a much more valuable skill IMO, but wanted to do <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383181457">Thanks. Actually, Paul and I have talked quite a bit about unschooling. In theory, he totally agrees with it. I can understand though that he&#39;s still in the &quot;schooling&quot; mode of academics. He says that he wants more academics done (academics being traditional school type work) but then says he trusts me to keep things going so that she isn&#39;t &quot;behind&quot; or anything and that he knows I have it all under control. <br/>
 <br/>
I think it could very well be that Sarah is needing more attention. She normally wakes up before anyone else in the morning. I asked her to start coming into my room to snuggle with me more in the mornings rather than heading straight to the living room for some televsion (she actually prefers educational shows like Between the Lions and Magic Schoolbus!). <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m going to take her out for icecream wednesday night, just us. Start looking to do that more. I used to take her twice a month on payday to a little icecream shop that overlooked King&#39;s Bay (Crystal River) but we lived in Florida and it was easier then! But I figured I can at least take her to a local Friendly&#39;s for a sundae even if it doesn&#39;t have half the view that little icecream shop had had! <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, thanks for the reminder to give her more attention. I do think that&#39;s more of what she is needing than academics - everytime we do anything schoolish it works for a couple of days and then we end up in fights about it. Particularly if it involves handwriting. I don&#39;t mean practicing, my mean writing by hand.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with what others have said here regarding DH.  If he&#39;s not <br/>
willing to learn about unschooling or to observe your children <br/>
learning in a real, though to him unconventional, way, then you <br/>
should discuss with him that since he&#39;s not home a lot, this should <br/>
be left in your hands.<br/>
<br/>
As far as your older child wanting to return to structure, there may <br/>
be more to that than just a desire to learn academic subjects.  You <br/>
have a new baby, you&#39;re dealing with postpartum depression on top of <br/>
a chronic depression problem, you&#39;re experiencing other health <br/>
problems that necessitate trips to the doctor, and dad&#39;s away a lot <br/>
of the time.  Maybe this desire for more structure is just her way of <br/>
voicing another need.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been through this with my own young children, and it is my <br/>
oldest who sometimes feels left out because my brain, body, and <br/>
spirit are spent in many different directions.  If there were a way <br/>
to get some one-on-one with her, that might be the solution instead <br/>
of returning to structured academics (I just see *that* as <br/>
exascerbating the depression...BTDT).  Maybe choose a project that <br/>
the two of you can work on, or take her out to lunch (I know, this is <br/>
sometimes difficult with many young children), or explore something <br/>
that fascinates her.  It&#39;s worth a try, and you&#39;re fostering a <br/>
connection with your daughter that will last for a lifetime. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, there&#39;s nothing wrong with playing with workbooks, too, <br/>
esp. if that&#39;s her desire.  My son (7) just did what I consider to be <br/>
about a month&#39;s worth of math work in two afternoons.  He is great <br/>
with mental math, a much more valuable skill IMO, but wanted to do <br/>
some stuff on paper.  So, he came across a workbook I got nearly 3 <br/>
years ago and just plowed through it.  He asked how to work some of <br/>
the harder problems that involved carrying and borrowing, and then <br/>
practiced the rest and when he was satisfied with his work, he <br/>
stopped and hasn&#39;t looked back.  I asked if he would like workbooks <br/>
for other things, like word games (which he loves to play when we go <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-990249381">Not a concrete example, alas, but from the perspective of someone who spent nearly a decade as a corporate lawyer  -- &quot;rules&quot; are things you get around by clever thinking.  But who would want to &quot;get around&quot; a principle?  If you stop believing in the principle, you might change it -- but it isn&#39;t something that you try to circumvent. <br/>
  <br/>
I think that focussing on principles helps me to behave appropriately.  If I believe as a  principle is that &quot;we should be kind to each other&quot;, then my reaction to Lydia tossing a piece of apple at me in a moment of anger is different than if the &quot;rule&quot; was &quot;we don&#39;t throw things.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Principles also leave more room for children to learn to make choices.  If the principle is that we try not to break things, then maybe she can roll a ball in the dining room, but not throw it, or throw it gently, or throw a softer ball, or throw a harder ball in a different room.  She can decide what it is that she feels like doing, within the constraint of not breaking the china or denting the teapots -- rather than having a &quot;rule&quot; like &quot;no throwing balls in the house&quot; (which would prompt my inner lawyer (and hers!) to argue over what is a &quot;ball,&quot; or what is &quot;throwing&quot; -- or what &quot;is&quot; &quot;is.&quot;  <br/>
