<div id="ygrps-yiv-672825940">Hi, All~ Wanted to do an actual intro. Our names are Debbie and Shane (5 <br/>
1/2). I&#39;ve been lurking for a few weeks and am so grateful to have found this <br/>
group. I also recently joined the alwayslearning group and really appreciate the <br/>
keeping it real, saying what you feel tone of both groups. I&#39;m so grateful for <br/>
the inspiration and to find there are others like us out there. I feel we&#39;ve <br/>
been homeschooling Shane&#39;s whole life through a natural learning process...he <br/>
takes the lead and I do my best to support whatever he&#39;s into. We experience <br/>
life as if it is our playground to explore and experiment with.<br/>
<br/>
I am a single, stay-at-home mom and an editor and, recently, a writer. We <br/>
have four dogs, two cats and two fish..plus the butterflies (for now).<br/>
