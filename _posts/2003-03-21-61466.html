&gt; Taking separate vacations is also something that we do.  He goes hunting<br/>
every year, and I usually take a weekend to do something I like.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It does help a lot.<br/>

&gt;   &lt;&lt; But separating doesn&#39;t always mean divorce.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Exactly.<br/>
&gt;   Our separation was absolutely necessary because my dh did not want to<br/>
get<br/>
&gt;   help.<br/>
&gt;   The separation allowed us both time to breathe in the space that the<br/>
other<br/>
&gt;   person left, which was very, very good for both of us.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I wanted to share something that Jason and I do, its something we saw on<br/>
Oprah many moons ago. We take seperat vacations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   We go back to MI a couple times a year, to visit family and I almost<br/>
always stay a week or two longer and Jason comes home. I keep the kids with<br/>
me, until they are old enough to go with Jason.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It helps so much. Sometimes, if we are not at a place to go out of town<br/>
one of us will stay with friends or family for a few days, sometimes even a<br/>
night apart can be all you need to reconect with the person you love.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   We have just watched the couple that introduced us (we were all very<br/>
good friends, had our kids together stuff like that)get divorced. Jason went<br/>
to court with his friend Tues. They forgot that they were friends and stoped<br/>
talking about anything other than the kids and bills, it&#39;s sad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Sometimes I think that you (a general you) forget that you like the<br/>
person you are married to, and that you were at one time friends with that<br/>
person, and friends need breaks from each other. It&#39;s hard to be married, it<br/>
takes work, and sometimes it feels like you are the only person doing any of<br/>
the work, I say, take a break, step back, breath, try to remember that this<br/>
person is your friend, treat him/her like one and talk to them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s hard and it doesn&#39;t always work, but it usally does.<br/>

&gt;   Have you ever read &quot;Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus&quot;?  It really<br/>
&gt;   helped me to understand where my dh is coming from.  I wanted him to<br/>
&gt;   read it but he never did, but even so, in changing the way I<br/>
&gt;   communicated with him and translated what he said, our marriage grew and<br/>
&gt;   became stronger.  I recommend it as a last ditch effort. I wish you<br/>

&gt;   &lt;&lt;Sometimes I think that you (a general you) forget that you like the<br/>
person you are married to, and that you were at one time friends with that<br/>
person, and friends need breaks from each other. It&#39;s hard to be married, it<br/>
takes work, and sometimes it feels like you are the only person doing any of<br/>
the work, I say, take a break, step back, breath, try to remember that this<br/>
person is your friend, treat him/her like one and talk to them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I think it so matters on the couple though. My husband and I were<br/>
friends first. We did have some time together at the beginning that didn&#39;t<br/>
start out as potential partner material. We&#39;ve been through an awful lot<br/>
together that most couples don&#39;t have to weather. I never have felt like I<br/>
need a break from him and the same goes for him also. We never have been<br/>
apart aside from 2-3 days on maybe 3 occasions. Business trip and deaths in<br/>
the family. Certainly not pleasure things. We&#39;ve even spent years where we<br/>
worked together every single day. We have no need to be apart. We spend more<br/>
time together than most couples I know. We prefer it that way and we thrive<br/>
that way. So it does depend on what each person needs and wants and whether<br/>
those needs and wants are the same.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Thanks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dear friends --<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wanted to tell you all that my new homeschooling book is out (and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m very proud of it! [:-[] Sorry, proud papa can&#39;t help it.) More to<br/>
&gt; the point though, back last summer I put out an announcement for a<br/>
&gt; homeschool book cover contest, and I wanted to take the opportunity to<br/>
&gt; let you know about the winner, and to thank all your kids who<br/>
&gt; participated! (We had hundreds of entries, from as far away as Kuala<br/>
&gt; Lampur, Malaysia, and Capetown, South Africa.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m very pleased with it, indeed -- the ship even has a moustache (to<br/>
&gt; resemble me, I guess, though I have never met the artist).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyhow -- you can see it on my website at www.skylarksings.com<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At some future point (once I get myself better organized), I hope to<br/>
&gt; post some of the runnersup on the site -- there were so many good<br/>
&gt; ones! [:-)]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; THIRTEEN-YEAR OLD WINS CONTEST TO DESIGN BOOK COVER<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Monroe, ME: Homeschooler Brianna Kathleen Thomas of Prince George,<br/>
&gt; British Columbia has won a contest for the artwork to a book cover for<br/>
&gt; David H. Albert&#39;s forthcoming Homeschooling and the Voyage of<br/>
&gt; Self-Discovery: A Journey of Original Seeking (Common Courage Press,<br/>
&gt; 2003). Ingeniously crafted from plasticine, her cover, features three<br/>
&gt; children on a boat, nicely echoing the theme in the title. She<br/>
&gt; received the prize of $100.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The art work was then used by designers Matt Wuerker and Erica<br/>
&gt; Bjerning who placed the title, subtitle and other type on the cover.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thomas was surprised to win. &quot;I thought for sure the prize had gone to<br/>
&gt; someone else,&quot; she said in a recent phone call informing her that her<br/>
&gt; work had been selected.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While writing his book last year, Albert decided to put his faith<br/>
&gt; where his commitments were and asked his publisher to run a contest<br/>
&gt; for a cover for his book. Greg Bates and Flic Shooter, publishers at<br/>
&gt; Common Courage Press, were worried. &quot;One concern was whether there<br/>
&gt; were enough young artists out there with the confidence to submit<br/>
&gt; entries,&quot; Bates said. But their real worry was quality. &quot;What<br/>
&gt; publisher in his right mind would entrust a cover--the most important<br/>
&gt; piece of advertising for a book--to a contest whose contestants had to<br/>
&gt; be 15 years of age or under,&quot; he said. &quot;I spent several sleepless<br/>
&gt; nights worrying that we were running a contest no one would win,&quot;<br/>
&gt; Bates continued.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But Albert, long a champion of the passions of homeschoolers, never<br/>
&gt; wavered. &quot;We will have lots of entries and more than one great cover,&quot;<br/>
&gt; he predicted. Albert was right on both counts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Word spread fast around the net and the network of homeschoolers. &quot;We<br/>
&gt; live in a tiny town,&quot; noted Bates. &quot;And when we received hundreds of<br/>
&gt; entries, even the post office took notice. It got to the point where<br/>
&gt; the postal clerk would announce how many entries we received each<br/>
&gt; day,&quot; he said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shooter, in charge of the initial review of entries, said, &quot;We were<br/>
&gt; quickly forced to develop a sorting system to handle the incoming art.<br/>
&gt; I enlisted our seven-year-old daughter to help with the task, and was<br/>
&gt; amazed to see how much she loved looking at the entries.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;We received several great entries,&quot; Shooter said. &quot;But Brianna&#39;s work<br/>
&gt; took my breath away from the moment I opened it,&quot; she said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;We hoped for a good cover,&quot; Bates said. &quot;What we got was a masterpiece.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; About the cover artist:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Brianna Kathleen Thomas did the cover art when she was thirteen years<br/>
&gt; old. She is homeschooled and she loves to make pictures with<br/>
&gt; plasticine and write fantasy and adventure stories. She lives with her<br/>
&gt; Mom, dad, her sister Molly, and her two brothers, Kieran and Aidan.<br/>
&gt; She also lives with her spunky cat, Scarlet and her dog, Griz, plus an<br/>
&gt; assortment of gerbils. For interviews, contact<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; We are another couple that likes some vacations apart.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It started with a stressed-out-escape when I enjoyed a single night alone<br/>
&gt; in a nearby hotel with pool, and quiet.  Lots and lots of quiet.  Balm for<br/>
&gt; a weary, weary soul.  It continued with yearly Mom&#39;s Weekend Out when a<br/>
&gt; girlfriend (or three) would go somewhere for the weekend, leaving papa&#39;s<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; home with babes.  It was followed by conflicting work schedules, his<br/>
&gt; getting ill (using up all his time off) and my having a family reunion<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; could NOT be missed (according to my mum) and that he didn&#39;t want to go to<br/>
&gt; anyway.  Perfect.  I took the kids and he stayed at home with quiet<br/>
&gt; evenings.  It still generally works out that I take the kids to my family<br/>
&gt; events (across the country) and he takes the kids to his family events (12<br/>
&gt; hours north) and we each try to make it to the others&#39; when we can.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s allowed us to use more of his vacation time for just-us-family time<br/>
&gt; and trips, instead of on all the rest of the family (and no time for<br/>
&gt; just-us-somewhere-new.)  Plus, nowadays, I&#39;ll go upcountry for a week or<br/>
&gt; two at a time and listen to the silence, dig in the mud/ditches, wander<br/>
&gt; down creeks, etc and just report to myself for a while.  I come back<br/>
&gt; renewed and well, happier, with more energy for everyone!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Personality-wise, I travel great with my son, okay with my daughter and<br/>
&gt; lousy with my husband.  It just comes down to the way we like to &#39;plan&#39;<br/>
(or<br/>
&gt; not plan) excursions, etc.  We are such opposites, my hubby and I.  We<br/>
work<br/>
&gt; really well together, but we also need time away to let the niggling stuff<br/>
&gt; dissapate.  I relish our time together more, after we&#39;ve been apart.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s just how it works for us, not for anybody else, eh?<br/>

&gt;   It&#39;s funny how travelling can be so strained with two different kinds of<br/>
people. Before Joe and I were married, we found this out in a matter of<br/>
days. Joe convinced me against my better judgement to take off spur of the<br/>
moment to go visit relatives. I hate not being organized and Joe just loves<br/>
to &quot;go and do it.&quot; I had no real reason to say no. We took 3 days, drove<br/>
from Florida to Pennsylvania and visited with my godmother, 2 aunts and an<br/>
uncle. Drove to New York and visited with Joe&#39;s grandmother. Drove back down<br/>
to Florida, stopped off in St. Petersburg for a few hours and then came home<br/>
to south FL. We had a great time. We knew after spending most of our time in<br/>
a car driving, we could do anything together!!!<br/>

&gt; My husband Ken and I feel the same way, we have had to have some trips<br/>
apart,<br/>
&gt; and the whole time we both are wishing we could tell each other something<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; ask something, it gets very lonely. I can&#39;t imagine being away from him If<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have to. IT does seem to be very individual.<br/>

&gt; &gt; We have no need to be apart. We spend more time together than most<br/>
couples I<br/>
&gt; &gt; know. We prefer it that way and we thrive that way. So it does depend on<br/>
&gt; &gt; what each person needs and wants and whether those needs and wants are<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We are like that.  We have occasionally been apart.  Like when he flew to<br/>
&gt; Georgia to take his board exams.  He wanted to not have us around so he<br/>
could<br/>
&gt; focus on the exam but we were on the phone all the time he wasn&#39;t in the<br/>
exam<br/>
&gt; and he said that he had wished we were there with him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We started out alone though.  After we were married I left the military<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; he stayed in and we moved to Germany where we did not know another person.<br/>
&gt; No family no friends.  We had to lean on each other for everything.  That,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; believe, is what has helped to make our marriage so strong.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi Everyone.<br/>
&gt; I have been reading all of your letters for a while<br/>
&gt; now, and love your insights. I don&#39;t actually have<br/>
&gt; kids. In fact, I am in college. I was unschooled until<br/>
&gt; 8th grade, when I made the choice to go to H.S. - A<br/>
&gt; choice I now regret but at the time seemed like I good<br/>
&gt; idea because I too felt like I was &quot;behind&quot;. I was<br/>
&gt; amazed by high schoolers lack of motivation and<br/>
&gt; excitement for learning. For the first year or so I<br/>
&gt; soaked everything up. I loved it. However, the farther<br/>
&gt; I went the less I learned for the sake of learning and<br/>
&gt; the more I did it for the grade. I got so wrapped up<br/>
&gt; in getting good grades and spending time with my<br/>
&gt; friends that I lost track of my beautiful family and<br/>
&gt; my passions. At first I got straight A&#39;s because I<br/>
&gt; worked hard. Later I worked hard to get straight A&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; I stopped being able to do all the cool things I had<br/>
&gt; done when I was unschooled. My parents just sat back<br/>
&gt; and let me do what I said I wanted. I graduated at the<br/>
&gt; top of my class and got several great scholarships. I<br/>
&gt; spent my freshman year of college at a small private<br/>
&gt; school in Kansas. I was not happy. This year, I<br/>
&gt; transfered to the University of Northern CO in<br/>
&gt; Greeley. I am enjoying it, but I still feel stifled<br/>
&gt; and stuck into routines that I would rather not<br/>
&gt; follow. A couple of weeks ago I finally started<br/>
&gt; reading the teenage liberation handbook (My mum has<br/>
&gt; been leaving it around for ages). It depresses me to<br/>
&gt; think how &#39;normal&#39; my life has become. I am majoring<br/>
&gt; in Art and Biology, and I love my classes, but I hate<br/>
&gt; the passivity of the public educations learning<br/>
&gt; process. I want to get out and see the world. I want<br/>
&gt; to take bike trips accross the country, I want to sew<br/>
&gt; a quilt, plant a garden, travel the globe. I feel like<br/>
&gt; I never have time to pursue my passions. Once again I<br/>
&gt; am wrapped up in getting good grades. I feel like I<br/>
&gt; have to so I can get good scholarships that will allow<br/>
&gt; me to afford to pay gallons of money to a school I am<br/>
&gt; not really sure is teaching me more than I would learn<br/>
&gt; on my own. So I think about all these things, and<br/>
&gt; wonder if I should just quit. Rise out of school. But<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t really ever hear of college students doing it.<br/>
&gt; You can argue that a H.S. diploma is not necessary,<br/>
&gt; but you cannot say the same thing about a college<br/>
&gt; degree. I would love to hear what your thoughts are<br/>
&gt; about my situation. Thank you for listening.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe everyone is in a zombie-like trance in front of the TV.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Seriously though...<br/>
&gt; I am reading The Plug-In Drug.  It was recommended, during a discussion on<br/>
&gt; another list, as a book that explains why TV is bad for kids and other<br/>
&gt; people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have the 2002 revised edition.  The author uses false logic and parent<br/>
&gt; testimonials to back her belief that TV is bad.  She frequently<br/>
contradicts<br/>
&gt; herself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am thinking of writing an essay to critique the book.  That would flex<br/>
&gt; some muscles that haven&#39;t been used in a while!<br/>

&gt; You said that you can&#39;t help thinking that you would<br/>
&gt; be doing more if you just got rid of the TV, but you<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t bring yourself to do it. All I can say to that<br/>
&gt; is DO! My parents chose when we were really young that<br/>
&gt; we were not going to have television in our house. My<br/>
&gt; life has been so much fuller becuase of that one small<br/>
&gt; choice. I do not deny that T.V. can be very<br/>
&gt; educational, but I have the same complaint with T.V.<br/>
&gt; as I do with public edu. It is too passive. Hours are<br/>
&gt; lost sitting on the couch in a trance. Instead you and<br/>
&gt; your children could be reading together, having<br/>
&gt; afternoon teas, sewing blankets, dancing outside,<br/>
&gt; biking to town, or just learning about each other.<br/>
&gt; With the help of the internet and NPR, none of the<br/>
&gt; positive aspects of television need to be lost. In<br/>
&gt; fact, in my opinion, the best possible set-up is not<br/>
&gt; to eliminate the T.V. completely - still have a VCR<br/>
&gt; and watch movies occasionally, but just eliminate the<br/>
&gt; television aspect. Think how much time you waste just<br/>
&gt; watching commercials for things you don&#39;t need! Life<br/>
&gt; is meant for living, not watching other people live.<br/>
&gt; Once your T.V. is gone, I promise you will not miss it<br/>
&gt; at all. Best of luck1<br/>
&gt; Betony<br/>

&gt; It is a false assumption that having access to TV  means you can&#39;t do<br/>
these<br/>
&gt; other things.   If given the choice, do you REALLY think that kids would<br/>
&gt; choose TV over interactive, fun stuff?   If they did choose TV, then<br/>
perhaps<br/>
&gt; those things are YOUR interests and not your childs.   Find out what your<br/>
&gt; child likes to do, and enjoy it with them enthusiastically.   My family<br/>
does<br/>
&gt; all the things you listed  plus tons more.   I do resent that folks<br/>
continue<br/>
&gt; to insinuate that not restricting TV means that is ALL children will do.<br/>

&gt; Subject: RE: Trapped in college<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I understand what you&#39;re saying. I wasn&#39;t homeschooled, and I went to<br/>
&gt; University and did that whole routine - I learned to live the system and<br/>
&gt; did just fine doing so (well, one has to wonder what I missed out<br/>
&gt; on...but that&#39;s another thread). My husband hated High School and he<br/>
&gt; hated University. When we got married he had two years left for his<br/>
&gt; degree. It was a real struggle for him. Finally he decided to quit. We<br/>
&gt; looked at our situation. He had a business, and loved it. He is a<br/>
&gt; finance guy - does personal finance for people. The stuff he was<br/>
&gt; learning in his finance degree was corporate finance and really didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; apply to his work. Finally, after much deliberation, he decided to quit.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes he regrets that he quit simply because he quit. He does want<br/>
&gt; to finish his degree one day - but truthfully, I don&#39;t think it will<br/>
&gt; have that much impact on his income, or anything else. It&#39;s just a<br/>
&gt; personal goal he has.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do think University education can be valuable - but you have to be<br/>
&gt; careful how you go about it. You have to make sure that you&#39;re really<br/>
&gt; learning the things you love and doing it for you, instead of jumping<br/>
&gt; through the hoops the school system has set up. That&#39;s what I did....and<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if I really obtained a &#39;higher education&#39; by going to<br/>
&gt; University. I just got a piece of paper.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi Everyone.<br/>
&gt; I have been reading all of your letters for a while<br/>
&gt; now, and love your insights. I don&#39;t actually have<br/>
&gt; kids. In fact, I am in college. I was unschooled until<br/>
&gt; 8th grade, when I made the choice to go to H.S. - A<br/>
&gt; choice I now regret but at the time seemed like I good<br/>
&gt; idea because I too felt like I was &quot;behind&quot;. I was<br/>
&gt; amazed by high schoolers lack of motivation and<br/>
&gt; excitement for learning. For the first year or so I<br/>
&gt; soaked everything up. I loved it. However, the farther<br/>
&gt; I went the less I learned for the sake of learning and<br/>
&gt; the more I did it for the grade. I got so wrapped up<br/>
&gt; in getting good grades and spending time with my<br/>
&gt; friends that I lost track of my beautiful family and<br/>
&gt; my passions. At first I got straight A&#39;s because I<br/>
&gt; worked hard. Later I worked hard to get straight A&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; I stopped being able to do all the cool things I had<br/>
&gt; done when I was unschooled. My parents just sat back<br/>
&gt; and let me do what I said I wanted. I graduated at the<br/>
&gt; top of my class and got several great scholarships. I<br/>
&gt; spent my freshman year of college at a small private<br/>
&gt; school in Kansas. I was not happy. This year, I<br/>
&gt; transfered to the University of Northern CO in<br/>
&gt; Greeley. I am enjoying it, but I still feel stifled<br/>
&gt; and stuck into routines that I would rather not<br/>
&gt; follow. A couple of weeks ago I finally started<br/>
&gt; reading the teenage liberation handbook (My mum has<br/>
&gt; been leaving it around for ages). It depresses me to<br/>
&gt; think how &#39;normal&#39; my life has become. I am majoring<br/>
&gt; in Art and Biology, and I love my classes, but I hate<br/>
&gt; the passivity of the public educations learning<br/>
&gt; process. I want to get out and see the world. I want<br/>
&gt; to take bike trips accross the country, I want to sew<br/>
&gt; a quilt, plant a garden, travel the globe. I feel like<br/>
&gt; I never have time to pursue my passions. Once again I<br/>
&gt; am wrapped up in getting good grades. I feel like I<br/>
