<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002834430">Cathie,  thank you for your reply.  How long has Megan been unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Katrina has almost no internet experience, but she is beginning to show some<br/>
interest.  One of the big results of being labeled in school was being<br/>
isolated and often scapegoated, so she has real anxiety about other kids.<br/>
We have tried to artificially create situations where she could be<br/>
successful, but her anxiety is so overwhelming that these ended in failure,<br/>
too.  I think it&#39;s possible that meeting others on the internet could really<br/>
help.  I will help her get her an internet address of her own in the next<br/>
week, and please, if Megan could write her that would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Cathy<br/>
