<div id="ygrps-yiv-550766723">I know a few people here have posted about husbands not getting the whole unschooling way or about restrictions on food and such. I am sorry to say I have never really followed those threads well. My husband and I are so in tuned to wanting better and are always able to come to agreements about this family. He is real easy going and never gives me problems by wanting things differently.<br/>
<br/>
So now, my friend is unschooling and also switching her parenting ways to less rules. I never really talked to her about doing so, it just follows along with what she wants for her son as far as him making choices. And she sees me and my kids a lot and how we do things and how we are all because of it.<br/>
<br/>
So she&#39;s run into a problem. She likes having a sit down dinner every night. Her son gets food they all eat and that she knows he likes. But she hasn&#39;t totally eased up on food or bedtimes. (yet!)  Anyway, her son ate his dinner that she made and was eating chips afterwards. Now she normally would have restricted the amount of chips he was having even after eating dinner. Well last night she didn&#39;t. She&#39;s not seeing it as a big deal anymore. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately her husband still is. As crazy as it sounds, he can&#39;t understand how the boy will learn self control if they don&#39;t set limits for him. Sounds totally absurd to me but it made sense to him. <br/>
<br/>
They never came to an agreement on it. She&#39;s upset she can&#39;t get him to see that. I&#39;m at a loss as to what she can do with her husband. She&#39;s reading through Sandra&#39;s stuff and loving every minute. It&#39;s helping her a lot to see things that she&#39;s reading there and with what she sees with us. It&#39;s all coming together for her. Not for her husband. I did try and give her examples in her own life to see if she can find something similar with her husband to have him see what she&#39;s talking about. <br/>
<br/>
Are there people here who do 2 different things with their children. Are there homes where dad imposes restrictions and mom doesn&#39;t? How does that work? How do you handle so mom and dad aren&#39;t butting heads every step of the way.<br/>
<br/>
I must also say this dad is gone quite a bit on business. So my friend has pretty much free reign on what goes on. But when he&#39;s home, it&#39;s a different story. And that&#39;s when she doesn&#39;t want trouble. He&#39;s not home often and she doesn&#39;t want to spend the time disagreeing.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

<br/>
My dh and I are just about as different as night and day.  Think Dharma and<br/>
Greg.  so  needless to say, our approach to parenting tends to be somewhat<br/>
different as well.  It took time and lots of talking, but what we finally<br/>
came to is simply respecting each other and who we are.  We talk a lot about<br/>
what is bothering us (about the kids or whatever) and WHY.  Is it about the<br/>
kids or is it about us or is it just some left over &quot;shoulds&quot; from when we<br/>
were kids.<br/>
<br/>
I am not an organized and orderly person, neither are my kids.  I posted<br/>
about how insane our home becomes a few weeks ago.  But for the most part, I<br/>
do try to get things organized somewhat because it is important to Dh and he<br/>
is part of the family as well.  I ask the kids to help pick up about half an<br/>
hour before we expect dh home and they are usually willing to help.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is.....now I see him working to help them as well....being more<br/>
considerate of who they are and why they are that way.<br/>

&gt; I know a few people here have posted about husbands not getting the whole<br/>
unschooling way or about restrictions on food and such. I am sorry to say I<br/>

How do you handle so mom and dad aren&#39;t butting heads every step of the way. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One couple I knew where the mom and dad just maintained different sets of <br/>
rules and expectations ended up divorced.  :-/<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But when he&#39;s home, it&#39;s a different story. And that&#39;s when she doesn&#39;t <br/>
want trouble. He&#39;s not home often and she doesn&#39;t want to spend the time <br/>
disagreeing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Any suggestions?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband worked in Minneapolis for four years, with weeklong trips home <br/>
every month or so.  We had that problem sometimes.  He would come home somewhat <br/>
frustrated and embarrassed not to know the current routine (and then we moved, <br/>
so he didn&#39;t even always know where to find a knife or the extra toilet <br/>
paper), and the kids were older, and  sometimes there was static.<br/>
<br/>
What helped me was to feed him successes by phone and e-mail and let him know <br/>
in some enthusiastic way how I had thought X might happen, but it didn&#39;t, and <br/>
things were SO peaceful and smooth this week.  I sneaked it in on him between <br/>
visits, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes I just took him aside and trying to walk that fine line would <br/>
tell him he should spend his time with the kids being sweet and patient, and <br/>
let me be the bad guy when he was gone if they really needed it.  (I knew they <br/>
didn&#39;t.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to make it sound like &quot;It&#39;s better when you&#39;re not here,&quot; and it&#39;s <br/>
rough when that&#39;s the truth.  It&#39;s not a good thing to say to a dad who&#39;s off <br/>
working no matter how true it is!!<br/>

This made me smile. I did the same thing with Joe. When I just couldn&#39;t get<br/>
him to see a point at that time, I would give him the old let me be the bad<br/>
guy talk. It always worked. He would realize right away that his time was<br/>
precious and the thing he was upset about no big deal. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve felt<br/>
the need to do that for a long time now. I take that as a good sign.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438703084">We are still doing two different things here, although Frank hardly ever spanked them at all.  I talk about peaceful parenting to other people and Frank hears me and nods his head in affirmation.  So I know he is hearing me.  And he sees me trying the different things.  It is obvious.  He is ok with it.  He didn&#39;t like it when I brought the candy home and let them have all they wanted but I just do it anyway and he hasn&#39;t said anything else.  I told him eventually they wouldn&#39;t eat that much of it, and he thought I was crazy but he&#39;s interested in it as much as I am.  <br/>
<br/>
But when he tells them something they know they cannot come to me afterwards and try to get it turned around.  They have learned quick who to go to when they want to do something.  And he has this thing about they have to ask they just can&#39;t tell they are going to do something and he always says yes, he just thinks it sounds better to ask for something rather than demand it.  <br/>
<br/>
And if he says something and they look to me sometimes I shrug and we just talk about it later.  He isn&#39;t real demanding though.  He&#39;s always been a what ever you say guy.  <br/>
