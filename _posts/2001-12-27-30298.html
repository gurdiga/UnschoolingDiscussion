<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674591270">Hey Linda, Jacli here - late as usual :)<br/>
Actually I have the mumps!!!!! So this time I have a great<br/>
excuse.<br/>
Anyway I wanted to send my little Here Here to your well<br/>
articulated<br/>
thoughts on the presence of peanuts.  Although I don&#39;t have<br/>
a problem<br/>
with peanuts I do empathize with folks who do.  Fortunately<br/>
for me<br/>
since I started using Herbalife 3 years ago I have<br/>
completely gotten over<br/>
my citrus allergies and environmental allergies, thrown out<br/>
my pills and stopped<br/>
getting my 2 shots in each arm 2 times a week.  BUT.  I<br/>
still have allergy to milk <br/>
and butter.  Now that&#39;s allergy not lactose intolerance.<br/>
Just the smell of butter<br/>
is enough to make me start hurling uncontrollably.  Think<br/>
there is a lot of peanut<br/>
butter out there?  Try looking for butter on the label next<br/>
time you go shopping.<br/>
You&#39;ll be surprised.  It&#39;s like air in America: it&#39;s<br/>
everyWhere.  Fortunately they do list dairy<br/>
butter.  Usually.<br/>
<br/>
But I had an experience two years ago that really brought<br/>
it home for me: I bought a <br/>
package of flavored Quaker rice cakes.  Turns out they had<br/>
dairy butter and butter oil <br/>
in them but rather than list it they just put &quot;natural<br/>
flavors&quot;.  Incidentally these were supposed<br/>
to be banana cakes and banana was NOT one of the natural<br/>
flavors.  Anyway I bought em, ate 1/2 of<br/>
one and began &quot;the hurl&quot; and it took a process of<br/>
elimination to figure out what had happened.<br/>
And more than a couple of phone calls.  And a trip to the<br/>
emergency room.  In the end Quaker<br/>
promised to include the information on the labels and last<br/>
year they followed through.  But it has <br/>
made me a touch more cautious that&#39;s for sure (or as hubby<br/>
dearest puts it: even more paranoid).<br/>
<br/>
The point is that every single one of us deserves to know<br/>
EXACTLY what is in the food that we<br/>
are spending our hard earned money on.  Even if its just<br/>
peanuts :)<br/>
<br/>
Take care and talk to you soon, Jacli<br/>
