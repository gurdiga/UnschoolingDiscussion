<br/>
Why isn&#39;t this list for this type of debate? What debate? One person says<br/>
something another disagrees, the first person has no intention of arguing<br/>
her first point and yet it seems some people get all flustered and have to<br/>
make sure things stay calm and smooth and homogenized. And this is not meant<br/>
as a personal attack or anything like that - I see it happen all the time<br/>
and I am just really wondering about this kind of dynamic, because I see it<br/>
happen in families and what goes on in families is merely a reflection of<br/>
what goes on in society as a whole (or vice versa).<br/>

<br/>
Well said (whoever said that last quote above). I like that. And along those<br/>
lines I want to share something from another list I belong to: it refers to<br/>
school in some way but I found it very worthwhile reading anyway:<br/>
<br/>
Subject: Emotions and the stuff of life.<br/>
<br/>
As is, we equate shame with emotional drive. Incorporation of emotions into<br/>
daily life is considered the opposite of intelligence, and so, emotions are<br/>
rarely mentioned. We hide them under a facade. Emotions lead us to being out<br/>
of control. Does this seem like what nature would intend for its highest<br/>
achievement? Were we accidentally genetically programmed over millions of<br/>
years to eventuate as a conflicted self, unable even to organize its own<br/>
state of being?<br/>
<br/>
An organism survives by being organized. Its organization is integration of<br/>
its systems. Integration of mental-emotional aspects creates the assemblage<br/>
of intelligence. The organism survives. Humans are different than many<br/>
organisms. Their integration occurs more gradually taking about fifteen<br/>
years to become concrete. This integration process may be perceived as two<br/>
important transitions.<br/>
<br/>
There are transitions children move through. First, their consciousness<br/>
knows nothing but being the interaction they are engaged in. After the first<br/>
transition children are also aware that they can think of interactions apart<br/>
from what is occurring. A second transition around age eleven allows<br/>
creative thought about interactions that they have not experienced.<br/>
<br/>
Each transition can occur with maximum benefit if the previous stage has<br/>
been worked over like a fresh slab of concrete. This means that the<br/>
substance of life is poured into the framework that mom provides. Then the<br/>
substance is &quot;textured&quot;, worked over experientially again and again that<br/>
particles settle and harden in place, and the suspension, the confusion, is<br/>
wicked away.<br/>
<br/>
Now imagine an upbringing where many rules are set in concrete. The child<br/>
learns to perform socially. The child learns to perform for school. The<br/>
child performs as a child according to rules imposed on childhood. The rules<br/>
are hard set. Only generally cemented in place is how the basic life<br/>
interactions work. Thus, a child usually learns to crawl, walk, talk, count<br/>
and have manners, but these are developed as rules, not as the nearly<br/>
infinite interrelationships that actually comprise life&#39;s foundation. Doing<br/>
in Rome as the Romans do is ruled out of a child&#39;s experience. The parents<br/>
consider broad exposure dangerous. How else could a child learn The Rules<br/>
but by limitation. In this limitation the rules are set in concrete while<br/>
the stuff of life wicks away.<br/>
<br/>
What is the stuff of life? For one, it is the imprinting in the brain of the<br/>
magnificent range of interactions that comprise life. For another, it is the<br/>
emotional/intuitive qualities associated with the range of interactions.<br/>
These things together, emotions and interactions, create a working<br/>
foundation from which can spring a working ego, an easy and practical way of<br/>
survival, and a practical creativity that has all kinds of fun expanding on<br/>
the given world, the stuff of life.<br/>
<br/>
But what happened to fun intelligent creativity? What happened to<br/>
intelligent ease of survival? These things got swept away as suspension<br/>
(actually dissolved at eleven years old) while the concrete rules settled as<br/>
the way of life. Intelligence cannot function as intended without<br/>
emotional/intuitive associations. Emotions and intuition are integral parts<br/>
of our being. The imposition of rules cannot bypass these to recreate<br/>
intelligence in some pagan image of humanity. Our genetic programming is far<br/>
too complex to manage as such a simplistic idealism. The brain fails. And<br/>
with it goes the sophisticated intelligence that easily, intuitively,<br/>
understands getting by in life, and understands how to expend energy<br/>
joyfully enhancing the quality of life.<br/>
<br/>
What needs cementing in the child is not a limited set of rules. What the<br/>
child needs is the full set of interrelationships that are the stuff of<br/>
life. And what glues this stuff with intelligent consciousness is emotions.<br/>
If emotions are ruled out when we absurdly try to recreate life, then the<br/>
stuff of life cannot become a solid foundation for intelligence to erect<br/>
upon. Instead, intelligence becomes an abstract with the purpose of<br/>
recreating life as a bunch of unfounded rules.<br/>
<br/>
The point is this: Emotions cement the integration of intelligence. For<br/>
emotions to be a part of the concrete stuff of life they have to be freely<br/>
experienced by children while being freely modeled by adults. Then they can<br/>
begin to move through the transitions mentioned in the third paragraph. From<br/>
experiencing self as only the experience of emotion the child can transit to<br/>
seeing a relationship of self to emotions. From here the child transits to<br/>
imagining varied possibilities of using emotions as tools for recreating<br/>
relationships in the stuff of life. Here is true control.<br/>
<br/>
This intelligently functional child will have the ability to relate<br/>
happiness to the work of quickly changing society into what works better and<br/>
with more happiness. This focused attention is so different than our<br/>
associating happiness with laziness, with addictions, with breaking rules,<br/>
with distractions. This intelligence I am speaking of is far different than<br/>
today&#39;s &quot;smart&quot; person who can outwit others, avoid being caught, escape<br/>
paying taxes, and get the most for the least amount of time spent away from<br/>
his personal distractions and addictions.<br/>
<br/>
Where do emotions and the stuff of life come together? In play.<br/>
Rules/rigidity and play/emotions are antithetical. We can have one or the<br/>
other. In order to choose intelligence and success we must also choose play<br/>
and emotions. Choosing these means using a vocabulary of emotions freely.<br/>
This will enable transitions as the time comes for them. Choosing these also<br/>
means adults have to play with children. Children are to take adults into<br/>
their realm of child-play, and, adults are to take children into their world<br/>
of adult-play. To the child there will be no dividing line. Emotions will<br/>
glue in place first experiences, and then emotions will glue in place<br/>
additional experiences. All of it will be play. There will be no transition<br/>
into abstract rules because the rules will be obvious as being the way life<br/>
works. Finally, doing what does _not_ work in life will simply be an act of<br/>
stupidity. And we won&#39;t have many stupid people when people are doing what<br/>
comes natural with the concrete stuff of life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Subject: Rules and the stuff of life.<br/>
<br/>
Life does need rules, but these are meant as measuring sticks, not as<br/>
idealisms abstracting life as some fairy tale. Fairy tales and superstitions<br/>
don&#39;t work well in real life. What does work is to measure what is occurring<br/>
and then do things that measure up even better.<br/>
<br/>
The best measures are simple guideposts that everyone understands. Once we<br/>
become fluent in these, more complex measures may be gradually implemented.<br/>
Likewise, results will become more refined and the benefits will define<br/>
higher &quot;values&quot;. These values still won&#39;t be The Rules. They will simply be<br/>
what works.<br/>
<br/>
Simple guideposts are nicely provided for in &quot;Living Joyfully With Children&quot;<br/>
by Win & Bill Sweet. Their down-home experience with their own children is<br/>
easily translated to other daily situations.<br/>
<br/>
My own idea of applying material in this book is to simply post one of the<br/>
lists of behaviors and then schedule some sort of interaction measuring<br/>
actual behavior against the experimental wish list. To understand this,<br/>
let&#39;s make up a scenario.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a list to post:<br/>
(pg. 18) Honoring Play<br/>
* Encourage solitary play.<br/>
* Provide opportunities for authentic free play with other children.<br/>
* Play with your children on their terms.<br/>
<br/>
At a weekly school meeting the children are asked to comment on these and<br/>
reach some sort of consensus. The children reply that there has been lots of<br/>
time for free play with each other, but not enough space at school to play<br/>
alone, and, as to adults playing &quot;correctly&quot;, the children did not<br/>
understand the question. The adult&#39;s response to this measuring of behavior<br/>
was to divide up a room so that individuals could have their own space. The<br/>
adults also set aside alternating days one week to deliberately play<br/>
correctly one day and incorrectly the next. This had the result that<br/>
children vehemently requested correct play. Not only did they think correct<br/>
play was better than incorrect, but it added so much to the school<br/>
experience that children were requesting adult attendance in a third of<br/>
their activities. The adults thought the experimental list such a success<br/>
that they created a suggested schedule for similar experiments using five<br/>
more lists. They thought that after doing that much they could decide on<br/>
hiring a psychology professor to help with more technical experiments of<br/>
&quot;higher&quot; value.<br/>
<br/>
These are some of the other lists available in the book:<br/>
* Kinds of play that pass the play test. (pg.17)<br/>
* Degrading themes to avoid in the milieu. (pg.4)<br/>
* Appropriate responses to crying. (pg.26)<br/>
* Traits of a strong emotional core. (pg.33)<br/>
* Responsive/not imposing actions of adults. (pg.36)<br/>
* Principles vs. rules. (chapter 9)<br/>
<br/>
There are more lists in this book of 186 pages. But in reading it you will<br/>
develop ideas for your own lists applicable to your situation. I promise,<br/>
doing these experiments will make a profound difference in the sense of<br/>
effectiveness and satisfaction.<br/>
