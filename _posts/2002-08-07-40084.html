<div id="ygrps-yiv-717635975"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; here&#39;s a? for you sandra. didn&#39;t the orthodox church precede the catholic?<br/>
&gt; what do you know about the great schism?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not Sandra, but I can tell you what I remember about the great<br/>
schism....just so you can all laugh!<br/>
<br/>
It was in 1054.  I&#39;ll never forget, because the combination lock on our<br/>
common storage area from seminary housing (back when my husband was doin&#39;<br/>
that) was keyed to the year to make it easy for the students to remember!<br/>
<br/>
but I did always think that the orthodox left the catholics, and not the<br/>
other way around...<br/>
