<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Liz,</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I try to use the same gibberish that teachers use 
when describing learning.&nbsp; Things like &quot;self-directed exploration involving 
animal science&quot; instead of &quot;learning about different animals&quot;.&nbsp; You can 
also use &quot;student selected biographical reading&quot;&nbsp;instead of &quot;reading what 
he wants to&quot;,&nbsp; &quot;practical mathematics&quot; instead of &quot;finding the best buy at 
the grocery store&quot;.&nbsp; I do have some high school level text books that we 
use a references.&nbsp; For me, it helps put things in a chronological 
order.&nbsp; I list these texts (American history, world history, biology, 
physics, chemistry, and Saxon math) in the appropriate areas.&nbsp; They don&#39;t 
need to know that it is the same book I&#39;ve listed for the last several 
years.&nbsp; I just put &quot;Abeka American history&quot;, no title.&nbsp; My oldest son 
has read the science texts in their entirety, and refers to them 
periodically.&nbsp; My personal view is that text books have their place, others 
disagree.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hope that helps,</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363519602">I took Carol Narigon&#39;s unschooling curriculum and fooled with it to make it <br/>
more generic and also sort of melded it with some other curriculum stuff to <br/>
satisfy the California requirement for private schools to keep a &quot;course of <br/>
study&quot; for each child (I recently started a private ISP for unschoolers). <br/>
In case anybody else has need of such a thing, I&#39;ll upload that to the <br/>
files area of this list, too. There is an elementary level document and a <br/>
secondary level document. Thank you to Carol for use of her initial document!!!<br/>
