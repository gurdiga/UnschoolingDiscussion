<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384159653">Hi everyone,<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking for a few days, I think it is about time to introduce<br/>
myself so that I can &quot;jump right in&quot; on the coversations.<br/>
<br/>
We (dh, ds 8yo, dd 11yo) have been HSing for almost 6 years. We started out<br/>
unschooling.  A strange turn of events involving bitter family members and<br/>
social services made me lose my mind &lt;g&gt; and I began &quot;school at home&quot;<br/>
practices after only 1 year unschooling.  I have flipped back and forth over<br/>
the years.  We are back to unschooling now, to stay, forever.  This time<br/>
feels different for us. For this and many other changes I thank all the<br/>
posters on this and other unschooly lists, message boards, and web page<br/>
articles.  My family is happier now.<br/>
<br/>
We currently live in central Indiana.  I&#39;ve lived in many places (Alaska,<br/>
Texas, North Carolina, Illinois, Michigan, Nebraska, Indiana) and attended<br/>
12 different public schools in my youth.  (Yes, I am still recovering from<br/>
that) LOL<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s all for now.... :-)<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Zan<br/>
<br/>
This message is cross-posted to other lists, sorry if you have to read it<br/>
twice :-(<br/>

Welcome.  How do you find Indiana as far as<br/>
homeschooling.  we just relocated from Middlebury,<br/>
Indiana to California.  The atmosphere in Indiana<br/>
(well in Middlebury) anyway was terribly unfriendly to<br/>
homeschoolers.  I was so desparate for unschoolers I<br/>
thought I would die.  But I didn&#39;t.  Actually it was a<br/>
good learning experience because I really became<br/>
stronger in myself and my belief in unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375054930">Hi Leslie<br/>
Thanks for the welcome!<br/>
<br/>
Indiana is a mixed bag for me when it comes to HSing.<br/>
The laws are great.  But when it comes to the general atmosphere I feel like<br/>
an outcast.  I have yet to find an unschooler. (why did you leave, we could<br/>
have hung out?!?!?! LOL)<br/>
<br/>
There is some difference in the regions of Indiana.  We used to live in<br/>
southern IN, in a small town.  The general concensus there was that I was<br/>
not permitted to HS because I am not christian.  (I used to be southern<br/>
baptist, then pagan, then agnostic, now atheist) Anytime I declined to join<br/>
a HS group (which required a written statement of faith) I would lose<br/>
&quot;friends&quot; and I was &quot;reported&quot; to the local authorities.  It was a scarey<br/>
time for us.  But as you said, it made me stronger.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I do know that more than likely the laws for HSing here are so good<br/>
because of faith-based HSers and I am thankful to them for that. I just<br/>
don&#39;t want to be judged on my beliefs or lack there of. A little mutual<br/>
respect would have been nice. I don&#39;t expect anyone to agree with me, I just<br/>
wish they had not attacked me.<br/>
<br/>
Here in Indianapolis, things are really different.  People tend to stay out<br/>
of our business.  We go to &quot;park days&quot; with a local all-inclusive group<br/>
about twice a year. The people are nice and the kids enjoy it alot.   Also,<br/>
whenever I tell anyone that we homeschool the response is always positive.<br/>
However, I still feel alone.<br/>
<br/>
I was just discussing this with DH last night.  I told him I was so &quot;on the<br/>
fringe&quot; with many things in my life that I may never have any friends with<br/>
similar interests, that I can confide in.  That is probably very<br/>
pessimistic, but I think (from the sound of your post) that you may<br/>
understand the frustration.<br/>
This could be just me... &quot;once bitten, twice shy&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We are probably going to leave IN within the next few years, we are going to<br/>
try to head west.  We vacationed in Las Vegas this spring and I fell in love<br/>
with the desert, I had never seen anything like it! I wouldn&#39;t want to live<br/>
near Vegas, but I was thinking possibly NM or AZ would be nice.<br/>
<br/>
So, how is CA for you?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162331016">I had similar difficulties in Indiana.  While I am a<br/>
christian I am very liberal and believe that whatever<br/>
belief works that is just fine.  But the people were<br/>
very religious and unaccepting, which really surprised<br/>
me being the town was very Amish. <br/>
<br/>
We tried to blend in with the neighbors but my kids<br/>
were verbally and physically abused.  It was a<br/>
difficult time because we had moved from Atlanta where<br/>
people were very accepting.  I did enjoy the lack of<br/>
homeschooling laws in Indiana though.<br/>
<br/>
The kids and I because of our isolation really got to<br/>
know each other with outside influence and we learned<br/>
to enjoy the climate and the country, to the point<br/>
that we really miss it.  I think I went to every state<br/>
park in northern Indiana, and had memberships to all<br/>
of the museums in Chicago.<br/>
<br/>
California is much friendlier when it comes to<br/>
homeschooling I even belong to a support group.  The<br/>
laws are a little stricter here than Indiana.  The<br/>
kids and I still talk about our experience in Indiana<br/>
and it has made us a little guy shy about sharing with<br/>
people, but it has also helped us to really appreciate<br/>
the homeschooling friends we have made here.<br/>
<br/>
I do understand your frustration and if ever you wish<br/>
to email me off the list that is fine.  I often times<br/>
I wish I had had someone to bitch too!<br/>

The groups that I know of are all listed on the following web page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeschooling.about.com/cs/insg/">http://homeschooling.about.com/cs/insg/</a><br/>
<br/>
The only group I know about that is not listed there is FLT Indy which is the one that I recommend.  We attend their park days sometimes and alot of people on their mailing list come up with good group activities and field trips.
