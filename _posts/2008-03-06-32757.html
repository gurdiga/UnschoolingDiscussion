<div id="ygrps-yiv-258211023">I was going to send this to Pam Sorooshian and her daughter Rose  <br/>
anyway, but I thought maybe there are others on this list who&#39;d be  <br/>
interested.<br/>
<br/>
Last night at my house we had a discussion on maps and mapping.  <br/>
(Wednesdays in winter people come over for discussions, SCA-based,  <br/>
Renaissance and medieval topics.)  This is the follow-up.  The  <br/>
websites deal with other than very-early  maps.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes map reading is the portal to all KINDS of things you&#39;d  <br/>
never expect.<br/>

It&#39;s never too late!  We&#39;ll all be learning about this stuff for the  <br/>
rest of our lives.<br/>
<br/>
And Gunwaldt wanted me to send you the link to Strange Maps<br/>
