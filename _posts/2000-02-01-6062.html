 </span></blockquote>Wow, what timing! I&#39;m heading out on the road tomorrow, and was fiddling<br/>
around with list settings before I leave, and thought I&#39;d check the digest<br/>
for this list, just to see how things are going... Didn&#39;t plan on posting<br/>
anything, as life is, as Lisa puts it, very busy and hectic...<br/>
<br/>
But here I am. Lynda&#39;s note reminded me that this list is a reflection of<br/>
the people who use it, and if some of us don&#39;t take the time to make our<br/>
voices heard, er, writings read, then people just might be left wondering<br/>
who&#39;s minding the store, so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a long-long term unschooler. Five totally unschooled kids, now ages 14<br/>
through 26. Three grandkids, with a fourth due literally any minute now.<br/>
Most of you probably know that, as I&#39;m not exacly low-profile online, but I<br/>
thought I&#39;d toss it out there for the newbies on this list.<br/>
<br/>
What effect our unschooling kids are having out there in the world. Good<br/>
conversation starter, Lisa. &lt;g&gt; Mine seem to be having a pretty good<br/>
effect. Jody (20) called this last weekend and told us about going to visit<br/>
some UW college kids with a friend of hers. The Superbowl was on TV, and<br/>
some of the guys were watching it... she said a commercial came on showing<br/>
something about overcrowded schools, and posed the question &quot;What can be<br/>
done about the problem...?&quot; To which Jody shouted &quot;Homeschool!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was a typical Jody response, but she said the reaction from the college<br/>
kids was dropmouthed amazement - they started asking questions -<br/>
intelligent questions, according to her - and she said most of those who<br/>
started out against the idea seemed to decide that maybe homeschooling<br/>
wasn&#39;t what they thought. Jody said interestingly enough, no social life<br/>
was the primary argument from the girls, and no documentation was the<br/>
biggest question from the guys.<br/>
