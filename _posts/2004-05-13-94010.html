My dh grew up in Iran - in a small town. He didn&#39;t have toys. But when <br/>
he was about 6 years old he made a little pull wagon from a flat wooden <br/>
box and some little wheels. He filled it with dirt and planted <br/>
sunflower seeds in it and they grew into big beautiful sunflower plants <br/>
which he pulled around behind him everywhere he went. To me, that <br/>
image, of a little boy pulling sunflowers around in a little homemade <br/>
wagon, is just so very sweet!!!<br/>

That is one of the prettiest word-images ever.  <br/>
<br/>
I sent to a dozen and some of my friends, especially to the artists and story <br/>
tellers, because that&#39;s an image that should be passed on!!<br/>
