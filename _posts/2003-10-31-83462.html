<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853405051">&lt;&lt; Let&#39;s not forget that different people have different ideas of<br/>
abuse.&gt;&gt;<br/>
I called this abuse today. I also got moderated on that list.<br/>
<br/>
A Mom was pointing out that her children needed work ethic and so on. Her <br/>
example was: my child wanted an animal so we bought a bird. After a few days he <br/>
was not feeding the bird so what was I to do? She said &quot;Do I one tell him its <br/>
ok and let the bird die? or two (what she did) Do I tell him he doesn&#39;t eat <br/>
until the bird is fed?  <br/>
To that I replied well one I do hope you are not serious and two it is <br/>
considered parental abuse to withhold food from a child.  Lastly feed the darn bid <br/>
yourself. <br/>
Abuse takes many shapes. I dont know this Mom so I dont know how long she <br/>
withheld food but she came back to say she disagreed.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was well said, and I&#39;d like to follow up on it.  <br/>
<br/>
I should say that I have spanked in the past, but it was never something I <br/>
felt good about; I always knew that if I&#39;d gotten to spanking, I&#39;d failed -- <br/>
failed to come up with a better solution to the &quot;problem&quot; (and I now realize I <br/>
was sometimes making problems where there weren&#39;t any by expecting certain <br/>
behaviors), failed to control my own temper, failed to nurture myself and my son so <br/>
that we could both have what we needed.  There was always a disconnect -- I <br/>
felt horrible about what I&#39;d done, but much of society seemed to think it was <br/>
okay, seemed to think that it was my right to do so as a parent.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
very confused up until now, to be honest.<br/>
<br/>
With that said, the response I could hear others making to Deb&#39;s comment <br/>
about how we wouldn&#39;t treat adults that way:  &quot;Well,  adults don&#39;t usually refuse <br/>
to get dressed; they don&#39;t throw tantrums in public.  Adults don&#39;t usually <br/>
hide under the clothes racks in Wal-mart and scare everyone by not coming out <br/>
when called.  Adults don&#39;t repeatedly run out in front of cars and so don&#39;t need <br/>
to be taught a sharp lesson for their own safety.  That&#39;s why we treat kids <br/>
differently.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have some ideas about the response to this, but I&#39;d love to hear others&#39;.  <br/>
TIA.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

It&#39;s easy to find pressure that says it&#39;s wrong NOT to do it,that it&#39;s a <br/>
parent&#39;s duty, that a parent can&#39;t be obedient to God without it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;With that said, the response I could hear others making to Deb&#39;s comment <br/>

<br/>
Those voices have left the building of my head.  When I read what Deb wrote I <br/>
only thought &quot;DAMNED STRAIGHT!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wife abusers say &quot;If you would fix yourself up,&quot; or &quot;If you&#39;d have made <br/>
dinner on time&quot; or whatever.  People find excuses.   &quot;He touched my truck, he <br/>
looked at my girlfriend, he brushed my arm,&quot; and there&#39;s a bar fight.   People <br/>
rarely say &quot;I&#39;m a drunken dumbass and will hit innocent bystanders for hardly any <br/>
reason.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so parents don&#39;t say &quot;I feel trapped and lost and so I take my <br/>
frustration out on thirty pound children when no other adults are in earshot.&quot;  They&#39;ll <br/>
spin a big web of justification.<br/>

I am going to have to make an assertion, because I am going nuts with<br/>
all the permutations on Google trying, unsuccessfully, to find the<br/>

<br/>
Recently I read a brief about a new study that showed that harsh<br/>

running into the road was a surefire parental attention getter, and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761708201">When I was younger like about 7 I would stand in the road and count the <br/>
seconds. Each time I would try to beat my time. I knew the risk I was taking but I <br/>
didn&#39;t care much, I just hoped I didn&#39;t get hit on a low count. <br/>
At the time my dad was cheating on my Mom and I was withholding my bowels <br/>
because my dad beat me if I pooped my pants and made me sit on the potty for <br/>
hours. A few months later I landed in the hospital neither of them knew I hadn&#39;t <br/>
gone to the bathroom. To make matters worse my Dad delivered me a donkey <br/>
stuffed animal and was banned from Boston Children&#39;s Hospital. <br/>
Even without the spanking it was abuse.<br/>

This must be my unclear expression. The shouting and spanking referred<br/>
to in the study was in response to the child going on to the road. The<br/>
study went on to imply that the children were not getting sufficient<br/>
parental attention, so found that entering the road as a way to grab<br/>
attention, even though it was negative attention. The children wanted<br/>
Mom to pay attention even if she was shouting and spanking, according to<br/>
the study.<br/>

 Yes, difficult, but,  maybe better than waiting until after her death to get <br/>
some freedom from your past. (and present)<br/>

<br/>
It goes in waves.  It was easy during the time I was in Adult Children of <br/>
Alcoholics and she was in AA, not drinking.  It was easy when I was having babies <br/>
and she wasn&#39;t causing any trouble.   When she started drinking again and so <br/>
actively aiding and abetting my then-20ish half brother to also be a drunk and <br/>
druggie, there was a whole new set of actions to contend with.<br/>
<br/>
Things that could be settled and unimportant are dredged up with her being <br/>
helpless and me getting flashes of memories of how badly she&#39;s treated helpless <br/>
children.   I understand she wasn&#39;t parented gloriously.  I understand she has <br/>
brain damage from years of alcoholism.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not angry with her.  I&#39;m tired of having my subconscious hurts stirred <br/>
up, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-369413680">Sandra, sometimes I think like this and think I will be so sorry for thinking this someday.  Thanks for sharing that. Stepheny<br/>
P.S.  Didn&#39;t think about peaceful parenting for mom though. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, but the still-frustrated little girl inside me sometimes whispers &quot;kick <br/>
her in the shins&quot; and the better-mom I&#39;ve tried to become says &quot;No, just <br/>
breathe slowly and smile and wait for her to die.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; So you peaceful parent your parent too. ;-) &gt;&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

people.  I can do it, and it is easier than carrying a grudge,BUT, if and when they <br/>
start the same old crap, it&#39;s a whole new set of forgiving, and it does get <br/>
exhausting.<br/>
