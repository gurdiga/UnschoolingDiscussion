&gt;No, unschooling isn&#39;t free form homeschooling. It isn&#39;t just absence of<br/>

&gt;what he wants to learn is what he needs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed, and I think its the *helping* part that becomes the issue of <br/>
debate in any unschooling group. We all tend to have our different <br/>
definitions of the same word.<br/>
And *trust* should be more of the focus and key word to concentrate on as <br/>
parents.<br/>

&gt;There are many things that will help kids learn, but that doesn&#39;t make those<br/>
&gt;things unschooling. There are fun ways for a parent to imposing knowledge<br/>
&gt;that kids aren&#39;t asking for but that doesn&#39;t make that technique<br/>
&gt;unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>/me nods in agreement.<br/>

Did you ever try to explain unschooling or democratic schooling and the <br/>
response becomes &quot;Oh I always try to make learning fun with my child!&quot; <br/>
(said with a big smile)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the best one can do at that point is just say &#39;How nice&#39; and <br/>
walk away.<br/>
<br/>
When the student is ready (parents included) the teacher will be there. <br/>
Thats why unschooling sometimes &#39;sings&#39; to a persons insides and <br/>
sometimes it goes right over their head. Of course sometimes it hits a <br/>
sore spot, but thats another issue.<br/>
