My son and I were talking about this the other day. I had asked him if he <br/>
ever considered taking any classes at the community college, fun classes that <br/>
is. <br/>
He seemed surprised that people could just take classes with no intent to get <br/>
a degree. I wonder how many do?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

Cameron (16 next week) and I are auditting a Sociology 101 class together. <br/>
We&#39;ll probably audit (or maybe even PAY for! &lt;g&gt;) another one later this <br/>
semester. Tonight was our second class. Cameron is ENTHRALLED! He&#39;s excited to do the <br/>
homework----and my shy, shy son is contributing to the class! It&#39;s great fun <br/>
to watch!<br/>
<br/>
We talked tonight after class about &quot;unschooling college&quot; where you take <br/>
certain classes just for the fun of it----no major. And no major headaches! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That sounds like a lot of fun, I think I will look into. Taking a class <br/>
together would be great, it would give us even more to talk about. <br/>
<br/>
My son is very interested in music, we bought him an inexpensive digital <br/>
mixer for Christmas and he loves it. I was also lucky to find him a 3 day workshop <br/>
titled &quot;Recording Behind the Scenes&quot; sponsored by a local adult continuing <br/>
education department. This group offers a lot of great classes and workshops <br/>
taught by whoever wants to teach them but most of the classes are only open to <br/>
people 18 and over. This one was open to 16 and up, talk about good luck, this <br/>
is exactly the type of thing I look for. It&#39;s being given by a real commercial <br/>
recording studio. Pete is thrilled to be going and I just found out another <br/>
unschooler signed up! <br/>

&lt;&lt; How does auditing work? It was my impression that by auditing, you just <br/>
showed up for the class and participated, but received no grade, paid no fees, <br/>
etc. But then I heard that you DO still pay the tuition, etc. but receive no <br/>
grade. Does it vary by college?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At the University of New Mexico, you pay the tuition, but you don&#39;t &quot;do the <br/>
work&quot; (they don&#39;t grade or give you feedback) and in seminar-type classes <br/>
auditors might be expected (or asked) to hang back and not participate, if that <br/>
participation is part of the grade (and also depending no doubt on the auditor <br/>
and his/her value to the participants).<br/>
<br/>
If you just sit in a class, it&#39;s called &quot;sitting in&quot; and some people arrange <br/>
that with a professor.  In a really big class, they&#39;d never know the <br/>
difference.  (Big like lecture hall size, which some universities have and some don&#39;t.  <br/>
I took Anthropology 101 and 102 in those circumstances, and Psychology 101.)<br/>
