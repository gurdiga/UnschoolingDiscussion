<div id="ygrps-yiv-41237340">If you&#39;re going to be seeing the Body Worlds exhibit while it&#39;s in Chicago, <br/>
you might be interested in ordering the teacher materials from MSI - it <br/>
includes a dvd that shows plastination preparation (including final positioning and <br/>
hardening of the horse and rider!) and a system by system exploration of the <br/>
exhibit. Sarah was weirded out about going to see the exhibit but is finding the <br/>
dvd content irresistible and will probably change her mind by the time we go.<br/>
<br/>
to order the dvd fill out the form here (mine came in less than a week)<br/>
