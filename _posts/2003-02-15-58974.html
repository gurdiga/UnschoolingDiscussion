<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009838251"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;But are you wanting to suggest that unschooling won&#39;t work for them?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems to me that the discussion fell apart over the idea of limits and <br/>
controls. Over choices and expectations. It is my truth that giving children <br/>
control over their own choices, limits and expectations for their own lives <br/>
is at the core of unschooling, special needs or no.<br/>
<br/>
As I type this, Casey at age 9, is having a frustration tantrum in the next <br/>
room that neither Jon nor I can break through. She&#39;s moaning and flailing <br/>
like she&#39;s possessed. I&#39;ve tried all my loving, caring and understanding <br/>
ways. I&#39;ve tried hugging and distracting and reasoning and breathing <br/>
suggestions. I&#39;ve tried moving her and letting her be. It&#39;s not working. <br/>
There&#39;s a pain in her soul right now that I cannot seem to reach. As a <br/>
mother, this is very hard.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s not the unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we&#39;re all just going to ride this one out till she&#39;s exhausted. So <br/>
hard. After it&#39;s over I&#39;ll try again to connect with her.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, I understand extremes. I just try VERY hard to not let her emotions <br/>
become my emotions.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
