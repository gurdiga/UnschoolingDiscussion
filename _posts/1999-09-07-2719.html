<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932024728">Hi all.  One of my major problems is my own energy level.  Last year I found <br/>
it very hard to stay motivated and do much more than prepare meals and keep <br/>
house (not very well, I might add).  Turns out I was suffering from <br/>
depression, which is now under control.  <br/>
<br/>
Well today we had a great day.  I worked at my church for 2 hours this <br/>
morning (as I do every morning) and while I was there, my girls, ages 7 and <br/>
5, went down to the preschool.  There are a lot of learning activities down <br/>
there.  Afterwards, we picked up my boys, ages 13 and 11, and headed to the <br/>
store, Zany Brainy, where we proceeded to &quot;play&quot; for over 2 hours.  We <br/>
explored everything, played with a lot of things, read some books, and the <br/>
kids even watched a video (Madeline).<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have any money, so we didn&#39;t buy anything, but we made lists of what <br/>
we would have bought if we did have the money.  And we estimated prices and <br/>
compared prices.<br/>
<br/>
Am I getting the idea of this unschooling thing yet???<br/>
<br/>

around here.  The next skill to learn is keeping up with the lists. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
