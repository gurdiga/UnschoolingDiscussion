<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512949933">I&#39;m trying to finalize my decision on which tapes to order.  I&#39;m <br/>
looking for the really cool unschooling ones.  So far I&#39;m getting <br/>
Pam&#39;s math tapes, Sandra&#39;s Peaceful Parenting, the video game one, <br/>
and probably the unschooling one with a whole bunch of people on it.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other really good unschooling ones that you recommend?  <br/>
I thought the educating human children in an electronic world looked <br/>
interesting, but when I went to the hsc website, it looked like the <br/>
speaker might be more school-at-home than unschoolish?  I don&#39;t want <br/>
to buy any that are going to be school-at-home kind of things.  <br/>

Hi, Sheila --<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t hear Jane Healy speak, but I would still recommend against her<br/>
tape if you want cool unschooling stuff.  Throughout the conference,<br/>
anytime two or more unschoolers who like TV were gathered, they were<br/>
shaking their heads and rolling their eyes about how much they didn&#39;t<br/>
like her speech.  Apparently it was very schooly.<br/>

If it was Jane Healy, she&#39;s public-school and had never been to a <br/>
homeschooling conference or met a homescooled child until the day before she <br/>
spoke.<br/>

important is whether someone&#39;s inside the box seeing only the inside or<br/>
inside the box but looking out. Or maybe studying the box from the outside.<br/>

She bragged about being an English teacher, and a tough one, with high <br/>
standards, and her students knew it... (Went on and ON about it) and later <br/>
said she was invested (some strong word) in the school system, and she <br/>
paused, and there was silence, and she said &quot;And always will be.&quot;  More <br/>
silence.<br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith was soft and thoughtful and funnier and looking at people in the <br/>
eyes.  He was telling us things we could use that very same day, as we went <br/>
into other workshops (or led them, or spoke).  <br/>
<br/>
She was saying computer games were stupid (implying those who wrote them, <br/>
bought them, used them, liked them, were also stupid).<br/>

I believe the Frank Smith speeches were not taped, at his request.  He<br/>
says he reserves the right to change his mind.  Implying that he doesn&#39;t<br/>

Does anyone on this list play Threshold?  I have a friend who is really<br/>
into it, and she tells me that the online roll-playing is a lot like<br/>
dramatic improvisation (without gestures) and that as a part of the game<br/>
some of the players do a lot of philosophical writing.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody heard of this?<br/>

Have you read any of Jane Healy&#39;s books? In one - I think it is &quot;Your Childs Growing Mind&quot; - she talks about how she tried homeschooling for a short while and it didn&#39;t work  for her child, so she writes that she has reservations about homeschooling...In Endangered Minds she cites scientific research on brain development and then makes the tenuous (imo) assertion that computer games and TV are not helpful for children in general and that their usage needs to be contained...As you can tell, I have not been impressed with her books! :-) Leonie W. <br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t know that.<br/>
<br/>
She certainly seemed SHOCKED that the teens who picked her up from the <br/>
airport were mature and together.  Maybe shocked is too strong a word.  Nah...<br/>
<br/>
She said she hadn&#39;t had a reason for her path to cross with homeschoolers.  I <br/>
guess when she tried it she wasn&#39;t in a support group or in contact with many <br/>
more, maybe!<br/>
<br/>
AND... guessing, I&#39;m guessing she would have done school at home.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the information I&#39;d rather not read the whole book to get!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I have a faint glimmer of understanding of her feelings.  I wasn&#39;t<br/>
shocked, but I was really, really impressed by the homeschooled teens<br/>
and young adults who spoke at the closing panel.  I have 7 public<br/>
schooled nieces and newphews in the 16-24 age range.  They are all<br/>
lovely people, very sweet and affectionate, but I&#39;ve never heard them<br/>
discuss philosophical issues the articulate way that the homeschooled<br/>
kids did.  (Maybe we&#39;ve been talking about the wrong stuff.)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I heard last year&#39;s coordinator had liked one of her books, and invited her <br/>
to speak.  There was a conflict and she couldn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
This year I think they let her on as default because she had been a &quot;maybe <br/>
next year&quot; from last year.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know for sure, but I don&#39;t think it was much more than that.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed baffling to me for her to admit (to me in private later) that she&#39;d <br/>
never met any homeschoolers and yet she&#39;d been going on and on.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a copy, but I took notes while she was speaking and ended up <br/>
having an oppportunity to give them to her.  I hadn&#39;t really planned to hand <br/>
them over, it was just an outlet for my energy while she was speaking.   I <br/>
was addressing them to her but wasn&#39;t going to hunt her down and force them <br/>
on her.  But we  met in the speaker&#39;s room where snacks were (Carol Narigon <br/>
was with me, and we were the only three there), so I asked her a couple of <br/>
questions, gave those to her and asked her to read them later.<br/>
<br/>
Basically I was saying that some of her statements (I gave examples) didn&#39;t <br/>
apply to homeschoolers, and I gave her reasons that I believe that <br/>
summarizing for children and telling them what they&#39;ve learned and how it can <br/>
be applied is very BAD in a natural learning situation.<br/>
<br/>
After I was home I send her copies of the video game workshop tape (she had <br/>
asked one of the organizers for one, and I volunteered to be the <br/>
mailer-person) and the handouts from that, and a copy of my unschooling talk.<br/>

couple of months ago to speak to a group of mostly-homeschoolers in<br/>
Nevada City or somewhere near there... the Waldorf-inspired homeschoolers<br/>
really like her, as you could probably guess, but they did also note that<br/>
she was pretty ignorant about homeschooling.<br/>

mixed group, although a bunch of homeschoolers from here went, including<br/>
the afore-mentioned last year&#39;s coordinator. It was a 3 or 4 hour evening<br/>
thing, though, so probably no kids went, or very few.<br/>
