<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850637046">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
The website is now finished for my un/homeschooling book, Homeschooling <br/>
Reflections.  I&#39;d love to have you visit the site.  My five children have learned <br/>
at home since 1981, when the oldest two left public school.  They all remained <br/>
at home until entering college.  At this time Chris, who is married and has a <br/>
daughter, is working as an accountant.  Shawn will graduate in Dec. with a <br/>
degree in Theatre, and is applying for graduate school.  Devin is a journey man <br/>
in the heating/air conditioning field.  Donika majors in music and dance at <br/>
Grossmont Community College, and Trevor at 15 is still home.<br/>
<br/>
This book covers some of the stories of our experiences.  It is written to <br/>
provide you mentoring support, as though I were your older sister.  I talk about <br/>
some of the challenges we have encountered and some of the questions I have <br/>
been asked through the years.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m taking advanced orders, which won&#39;t be processed until the book is ready <br/>
to send out. ****PLEASE NOTE ORDERS PLACED BY OCT 15 WILL NOT  BE CHARGED <br/>
SHIPPING.<br/>
<br/>
The cover of the book was designed by my good friend&#39;s daughter, Ashley <br/>
Parsons, who was homeschooled.  The website was created by my nephew, Steven <br/>
Potter, who left high school out of boredom to attend technical school for <br/>
computers, which he also left to run his own business.  <br/>
<br/>
It has been an amazing life experience, not only to watch my children grow to <br/>
young adults, four of whom are now out in the world, but also to watch the <br/>
growth of the un/homeschooling movement.<br/>
<br/>
Please visit the website at: www.Homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to share the site with any people or lists that you think might <br/>
have an interest in it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Connie Colten<br/>
