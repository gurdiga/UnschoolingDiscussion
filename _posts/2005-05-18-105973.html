If your  priority is perfectly behaved children who read at an early<br/>
age and who  impress your friends and family with their knowledge and<br/>
deportment, you  may find unschooling a hard path to follow (not that<br/>
any other method will  necessarily get you these things). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=================<br/>
 <br/>
In such a case, though the mom could say &quot;At least I tried,&quot; and look down  <br/>
at us, the slackers.&lt;G&gt;  There&#39;s a cost to pressing children to do  things <br/>
early and better and perfectly, though, and that comes straight off the  top of <br/>
the relationship between parent and child.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s 5:00 in the morning in Albuquerque.  I got up at 4:30, having  been <br/>
awake an hour.  I started bread, made tea, changed out the dishwasher,  started <br/>
washing the stove parts, and Kirby (18) came in (in Bart Simpson  boxer shorts).<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;You couldn&#39;t sleep?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;No.  Sorry if I woke you up.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;I was still up.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;If you&#39;re up when Keith comes through, he wants to talk to you about the  <br/>
dash lights on the van.  Were they out Saturday night when we went to  Pirates <br/>
of Penzance?&quot; (He drove one van and I drove the other as we had more  attendees <br/>
than would fit in either one.)<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Dim.  They&#39;ve always been dim, though.  I thought that&#39;s just  how the van <br/>
was.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Leif is camping out tonight at Century Rio [a theatre] with his boss to  get <br/>
tickets for Star Wars.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;But it&#39;s...&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s tomorrow night at midnight.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Cameron called to ask where you&#39;re going to see Star Wars.  Marty and  I <br/>
didn&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Cottonwood.  Michelle got free tickets.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Oh, right.  I remember you told me that.  If Cameron calls I&#39;ll  tell him <br/>
you&#39;re unavailable to assist him.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Okay, thanks.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
So he went to bed, and I came to sit and drink tea.<br/>
 <br/>
I KNOW that whole conversation could have gone differently.  I could  have <br/>
been grouchy that he was still up at nearly 5:00 a.m.  Some moms  might&#39;ve been <br/>
uncomfortable (or worse) at an 18 year old appearing in his  underwear with no <br/>
self consciousness.  He didn&#39;t ask to go to the movies  (though he did tell <br/>
me weeks ago).<br/>
 <br/>
My priority is to help him live at peace in his own home, and letting him  <br/>
know that I care about him and his comfort is part of that.<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron is younger than Kirby and often tags along.  He got a job two  days <br/>
ago and is feeling older and bigger, and has recently started to  drive.<br/>
 <br/>
Michelle is in her 20&#39;s and Kirby knows her from the Anime club.  Her  <br/>
boyfriend works early and doesn&#39;t want to go to a midnight showing of Star Wars,  so <br/>
she&#39;s taking Kirby with the complimentary tickets she got working at Suncoast <br/>
 Video.<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby was out late at a friend&#39;s house helping him prepare for an L5R  <br/>
tournament he&#39;s running this coming weekend.  The friend is 30 or older,  has a wife <br/>
and two children, very organized and responsible, and his assistant  of <br/>
choice was Kirby.<br/>
 <br/>
And about that reading...  Kirby was reading aloud the other night  from a <br/>
gaming manual to that big batch of guys who went to see Pirates of  Penzance <br/>
with us.  Kirby and Marty really wanted to go to the play.   As things turned <br/>
out, three unexpected others went with us.  That was  fine. They went because <br/>
they were involved in a role playing game, and wanted to  continue it later, and <br/>
because they trust Kirby and Marty&#39;s judgement about  what&#39;s cool.  They had <br/>
fun, and came back and played several hours longer  afterward.   But Kirby, one <br/>
of the youngest of the seven there,  and one of the &quot;least educated,&quot; was <br/>
reading difficult material aloud to  attentive others, one of whom (Leif, who&#39;s <br/>
camped in the Star Wars  line) has a college degree, one of whom has two years <br/>
of college, and none  of whom had any reason to say, &quot;Let me read that.&quot;   He <br/>
could&#39;ve been  reading it for taping, or radio.  Expressive, clear, no <br/>
hesitation.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s confident in his skin, in his mind, and in his being.<br/>
He&#39;s not afraid of his parents.<br/>
He goes to sleep happy and he wakes up glad.<br/>
 <br/>
My priorities could have been different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683077521">I went to find a place to put the exchange on priorities, and found a  page I <br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever pressed or announced, though it&#39;s on my  index.  <br/>
 <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/priorities_">http://sandradodd.com/priorities_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/priorities)">http://sandradodd.com/priorities)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
It had a wonderful (as usual) thing by Joyce Fetteroll, in response to  <br/>
someone&#39;s objections about something (involving food).   Here&#39;s a line  that wasn&#39;t <br/>
addressed directly, though:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;You seem to be saying that the two priorities are mutually  exclusive.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Priorities have literally to do with rankings.  Two &quot;priorities&quot;  can&#39;t be <br/>
equal, or there is no &quot;priority&quot; (first-in-lineness,  precedence).   So if they <br/>
are to be called &quot;priorities&quot; then I suppose  one has to exclude the other at <br/>
that point of decision making.   But  people can have two favorite causes or <br/>
missions or concerns, and lots of times  the precedence of them won&#39;t matter.  <br/>
When it does, that&#39;s when they learn  their priorities.<br/>
 <br/>
Some people&#39;s priority is keeping the neighbors happy or satisfying their  <br/>
mom&#39;s questions. That tends to put the kids way, way down the list,  especially <br/>
if yardwork and housework and auto care and nice coats and groomed  pets are <br/>
priorities (being on the real or imagined neighborly or parental  checklists).  <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes all that&#39;s needed to clarify thinking is to look at the words we  <br/>
use and what they really mean.   &quot;Equal priorities&quot; means &quot;no  priorities.&quot;<br/>

When my grown boys were still home, it was amazing how skimpily dressed or  <br/>
naked they were most of the time.  When they were ten, they wouldn&#39;t even  go <br/>
in the pool without a shirt.<br/>
 <br/>
I was never mad about it.  They were glorious.<br/>

I could have written the above about either of my children.  Life is just so<br/>
good here in our little world.  We are an introverted family.  My girls are<br/>
now 8 and 10.  It wasn&#39;t so many years ago when I decided not to send my<br/>
oldest to school that I was hearing concerns from other people (however<br/>
gently) about how if I didn&#39;t send them to school or somewhere with a lot of<br/>
children regularly that they wouldn&#39;t be properly socialized. Some people<br/>
worried about their natural reserved nature. They were pained to be the<br/>
center of attention, especially my older dd. They felt put on the spot if<br/>
someone spoke to them.  (other than people they were close to)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It has just been so cool to watch them come into their own.  I&#39;ve let them<br/>
develop socially at their own pace, and have not pushed them beyond their<br/>
comfort level.  I often spoke for them when they couldn&#39;t bring themselves<br/>
to answer someone and despite the fact that I would have loved to brag about<br/>
them over the years, they never felt comfortable with me sharing their<br/>
successes, so I kept quiet.  They felt put of stage if I bragged about<br/>
anything they did.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But now they are both comfortable in their own skin.  They are confident in<br/>
who they are and what they know.  They like who they are and their<br/>
confidence in relating to others and being the center of attention continues<br/>
to grow.  They do things for the intrinsic value it brings them, not to<br/>
impress others.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
They were both recently in a horse show, a dressage show actually, where<br/>
they ride alone in front of a judge, riding in a pattern. (with an audience<br/>
too) They were confident and calm.  I was nervous and over excited.  They<br/>
went in, rode their pattern, stopped in front of the judge like they were<br/>
supposed to, and came out with huge smiles, feeling rewarded for having<br/>
competed.  The ribbons they won were frosting on the cake, but not the<br/>
reason for competing at all.  It was so cool!  It would have been so hard to<br/>
imagine 5 years ago.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One neighbor who was particularly concerned about my children&#39;s reserved<br/>
nature when they were younger came and watched.  She was in awe of their<br/>
confidence and calm.  Despite my worries sometimes, I just knew deep inside<br/>
me that they needed to develop socially on their own schedule.  It has been<br/>
so cool to watch.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Like Kirby, my girls are confident in their own skin, in their minds, and in<br/>
their beings.<br/>
<br/>
They aren&#39;t afraid of their parents and they go to sleep happy and wake up<br/>
glad.  <br/>
<br/>
They have a zest for life and learning that is immeasurable.<br/>
<br/>
Life is grand!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I feel so bad for kids whose parents force them into uncomfortable <br/>
social situations - force attention on them - draw attention to them. I <br/>
just want to DO something - to shelter those kids - but how to do that <br/>
without embarrassing the kids by paying attention to them?<br/>
<br/>
I was very very very shy and reserved - I&#39;d blush bright red if someone <br/>
unexpectedly said something to me. The thing that was agony for me was <br/>
never knowing when attention would suddenly be on me. If my parents had <br/>
shielded me more and if I&#39;d not had to go to school, I just KNOW I&#39;d <br/>
have been happier and more comfortable. I remember spending much of my <br/>
school day terrified that the teacher was about to notice me or call on <br/>
me - sitting there looking down, not making eye contact, my &quot;inside <br/>
voice&quot; repeating - &quot;not me not me not me oh pleeeease don&#39;t call on <br/>
me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - big huge kudos from the little girl I was to the moms out there <br/>
who protect and shield their children from embarrassment.<br/>

It was hearing/reading stories like yours, that gave me the understanding<br/>
and the conviction to be there to shield and speak for my children, as they<br/>
needed it.  I am thankful that you and others like you have shared your<br/>
stories so that I could learn from them.  My older dd is the most reserved<br/>
of the two and being my first child I had to learn the hard way not to do<br/>
anything to make her the center of attention.   She is more like her dad was<br/>
as a child.  My younger dd is more like me, introverted and not wanting to<br/>
be the center of attention, but not quite so pained by it.   I didn&#39;t fully<br/>
understand just how uncomfortable those situations made my older dd, but<br/>
somehow I knew in my heart drawing attention to her wasn&#39;t going to help her<br/>
through those feelings.  She just needed time to work through it on her own.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was talking with some moms the other day about our kids when they were<br/>
babies and I mentioned that my babies cried if I vacuumed. (I didn&#39;t vacuum<br/>
very often because of it and they still hate it and go in the den and shut<br/>
the door.)  I was saying they both hated loud noises and were easily<br/>
overwhelmed by lots of people, etc.  Someone who has only known them for<br/>
about a year and a half said, &quot;Well, it&#39;s obviously not a problem anymore.&quot;<br/>
It is sometimes neat to hear what other people think about your kids because<br/>
you often have this ongoing idea of who they are and when someone sees them<br/>
differently you come to realize just how much they have changed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607923160">I always make the offer to speak for my kids if they&#39;d rather, like if  we&#39;re <br/>
going to the dentist, or to an information desk or talking to a store  clerk. <br/>
 Holly still takes me up on it sometimes.  Marty USUALLY  does.  Kirby <br/>
prefers his style of interaction to mine.  He&#39;s much  more...  used car salesman, <br/>
smarmy, pizzazzy, flirty, mushy.<br/>
 <br/>
So Holly, who still often will say &quot;You talk, mom,&quot; is at HesFes  interacting <br/>
like CRAZY with lots of people she&#39;s never met before.  It will  be <br/>
interesting to see if she&#39;s more likely to do her own talking without even  glancing <br/>
back at me (as Kirby does) when she&#39;s home.<br/>
 <br/>
Marty is the least outgoing of the kids here, and he will even have me call  <br/>
his boss sometimes instead of wanting to call himself (we&#39;re friends).  He  <br/>
gets flustered when the responsibility for beginning a dialog is on him.   He&#39;s <br/>
not as good at taking phone messages as I wish he were; he just does the  <br/>
minimum and gets off the phone, unable to answer any questions afterwards, as  <br/>
though he had frozen up just because someone was talking to him on the  phone.  <br/>
So I&#39;m fine with doing Marty&#39;s talking for him, or getting his  information for <br/>
him, because gradually and steadily he&#39;s braver.<br/>
