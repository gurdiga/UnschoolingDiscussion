Not too mention the huge problem of millions of kids arriving at school<br/>
hungry.  (And we are led to believe this results from poverty or lack of<br/>
parenting skills)  My dd rarely eats much of anything before 10:00 am or<br/>
so.  She also tends to get carsick if we get up early and go in the car<br/>
right away.  Our neighborhood rides the bus to school -- this wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
a pretty picture!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My father will argue that, without the discipline of getting up<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and going to school, my son will never be able to hold a regular job. I<br/>
can<br/>
only hope my son will find work he loves that will fit his internal<br/>
clock,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hasn&#39;t he noticed that our society runs around the clock?  What would we<br/>
do without those people who enjoy swing and night shifts!!<br/>
