<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127431985">Frank Smith&#39;s _Insult to Intelligence_ is a powerful book about reading and<br/>
learning to read. No cookbook here-just some things to think about. His<br/>
Learners&#39; Manifesto is food for thought.<br/>
  My 8 yo dd is just becoming fluent in her reading--<br/>
we read all the time in our house. We had played some games--i would write<br/>
sentences(mostly somewhat goofy)--she&#39;d read them and then illustrate them.<br/>
Then one dayshe said,&quot;Mom no offense, but these are stupid. I want to read<br/>
books&quot;<br/>
We went to the bookstore and she bought a book that she wanted to read.<br/>
Thenwhen we finished that one, we bought another.  We take turns reading<br/>
these books--it&#39;s still not smooth for her--but we&#39;re having a blast!<br/>

&gt; Hi Michelle,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stephanie [4 next week] and Madeleine [just turned 6] are presently<br/>
&gt; starting to read, I say they are reading, not learning to read because<br/>
thay<br/>
&gt; can both recognize quite a few words and as with speech it doesn&#39;t happen<br/>
&gt; all at once but is a gradual process, we don&#39;t stress when a baby doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; talk fluently, so we need not stress oursleves or our children when they<br/>
&gt; are starting to read... just go with it, read to them a lot, read to<br/>
&gt; yourself a lot to show that it an enjoyable/informative pursuit and soon<br/>
&gt; enough children will read.  Maybe not until they are twelve years old, or<br/>
&gt; even later, but without school&#39;s silly timetables getting in the way it<br/>
&gt; really doesn&#39;t matter, when the child has a desire/need to read, he/she<br/>
&gt; will do so.<br/>

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any big secret or one method that works particularly <br/>
well.  Read to them a lot, then read some more, notice how many things there <br/>
are to read (especially things that mean something to them -- the TOYS sign <br/>
in KMart, for ex.), notice when they read (if you&#39;re playing a game and they <br/>
move correctly, maybe they did that because they read the spaces on the board <br/>
or whatever, point out to them that that is what they did and praise it and <br/>
point out how helpful reading is), then read to them some more, then get them <br/>
a library card, read for yourself for your own enjoyment, talk about what&#39;s <br/>
in the paper (the funnies are great!), use the PC -- there are lots of CDs <br/>
that are fun and sneak in some &quot;educational&quot; material and even if it&#39;s not <br/>
blatantly educational, following the directions and recognizing things in a <br/>
game (like the Barbia CD Santa brought here) -- that&#39;s all reading too.  <br/>
Etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  I think it will all click with time and lots of different inputs. <br/>
