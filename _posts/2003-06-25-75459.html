<br/>
&gt;He might if sugar has been a rare and restricted thing.   It works that<br/>
&gt; way for some people.  If a thing has been very limited, when it finally<br/>
&gt; becomes available it takes a while for them to feel like they&#39;ve had<br/>
&gt; enough. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, I can&#39;t say what I mean... <br/>
<br/>
I assumed the poster meant sweets when she wrote sugar, so I said sugar. <br/>
 But Sandra is right, no one would eat *just* sugar all day.  (Not even<br/>
Julian!&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
What about sweets?  If a kid is eating cake and cookies he&#39;s getting<br/>
sugar but he&#39;s also getting flour and oil, which are in bread and other<br/>
foods, and unless you&#39;re vegan, milk and/or eggs which are considered by<br/>
some to be food products in their own right.  Maybe they&#39;re getting<br/>
peanut butter or oatmeal, too. <br/>
<br/>
Does anybody say, ever, - if left to his own devices my kid would eat<br/>
flour all day- ? &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
Cars and stairs and slippery shower stalls offer greater dangers every<br/>
day than cookies and pie.  *People* are a greater danger everyday than<br/>
Snickers bars.   <br/>
<br/>
OH!  A boy came to play with Dylan yesterday and saw the pigeons.  He<br/>
said &quot;Pigeons spread disease!&quot; and Dylan said &quot;Name one disease you ever<br/>
caught from a pigeon!  *People* spread disease to people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What that has to do with sugar, I can&#39;t say. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Pigeons spread disease!? <br/>
<br/>
City-pigeons crap on concrete, making concrete more dangerous to walk on, <br/>
maybe. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I don&#39;t even think they spread disease to other birds!  And they rid the <br/>
world of discarded French fries.  (Chips, for English pigeons, if there are <br/>
English pigeons.)<br/>

his family sometimes ate pigeons for dinner.  They had a big barn inhabited by <br/>
pigeons and would just trap them then cook them.  Kinda like poor man&#39;s <br/>
cornish hen.  He said they were almost the same.<br/>
