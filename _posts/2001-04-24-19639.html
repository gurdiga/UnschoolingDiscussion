<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Hello! For those who don&#39;t know me, my name is Lara Kimber and I am<br/>
&gt; &gt;the Founder and Leader of the L.L.G. -Lifetime Learners of Georgia<br/>
&gt; &gt;Homeschooling Support Group. One thing my group does is put out a<br/>
&gt; &gt;Print Newsletter that is free to members and available to the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>public<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;for subscription. We are a non-profit group so all proceeds from<br/>
&gt; &gt;subscriptions go back to the group and to help keep the newsletter<br/>
&gt; &gt;going. All positions are filled on a volunteer basis. We are an<br/>
&gt; &gt;inclusive group that does not make any religious or political<br/>
&gt; &gt;Philosophy a part of the group&#39;s identity. Our newsletter reflects<br/>
&gt; &gt;this foundation. I only mention all of this so you know the way the<br/>
&gt; &gt;newsletter is handled. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am writing today to ask if any of you have any articles you would<br/>
&gt; &gt;like to submit, and if so I would love to review them for possible<br/>
&gt; &gt;inclusion in our newsletter. You would of course receive full <br/>
 </span></blockquote>credit<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;for the article and if you have a website, business, or <br/>
 </span></blockquote>organization,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;this can be a great way to help promote it. Also, you would receive<br/>
&gt; &gt;every issue of our newsletter that includes your work so that you<br/>
&gt; &gt;will have a hard copy of your published writing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Our goal with this newsletter is to make it an excellent resource <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;homeschoolers as well as trying to help the general public learn<br/>
 </span></blockquote>about<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;homeschooling. It is also a great resource for *any* parent who is<br/>
&gt; &gt;interested in the education of their children. So many who do not<br/>
&gt; &gt;know about homeschooling often put it down due to a fear of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;unknown. Our newsletter currently goes out to many businesses that<br/>
&gt; &gt;are not officially homeschool related (isn&#39;t everything homeschool<br/>
&gt; &gt;related though?), such as some Chiropractic Clinics, Veterinary<br/>
&gt; &gt;Clinics, School Supply Stores, etc. Clinics are putting our<br/>
&gt; &gt;newsletter out for their patients to read while in the waiting <br/>
 </span></blockquote>rooms.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;We feel this is a great way to reach many people who might not<br/>
&gt; &gt;otherwise know anything about homeschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The types of articles I am looking for do not *have* to be directly<br/>
&gt; &gt;related to homeschooling. They can be about education or of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>interest<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;to parents in general as well.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If you have any questions or items you would like to submit, you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>can<br/>
