&gt; You&#39;re probably right in general that they need to be privately funded in<br/>
&gt; order to work, but it&#39;s these absolute statements that keep putting me<br/>

It was Thomas Jefferson who wrote that forcing people to pay for things that<br/>
violate their beliefs [like state-funded churches} is tyranny. (sorry, I<br/>
can&#39;t locate the exact quote)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a reasonable objection -- and many people have it -- that forcing<br/>
people to pay for (or accept) things that go against their beliefs or best<br/>
judgment is bad government. Public schools do that to almost everyone. If<br/>
there&#39;s public funding for a private school whose program goes against the<br/>
wishes of many people, then the funding is a form of tyranny -- strictly<br/>
speaking -- because many people are forced to pay for it who wouldn&#39;t do it<br/>
voluntarily.  Public schools do that to almost everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Thirty years ago, I was involved with a group that wanted the local public<br/>
school system to fund our new, innovative private school. (This was in<br/>
Aspen, Colorado and I was even on the city council) Our proposal was not<br/>
accepted and the families (most of whom were wealthy) had to pay for their<br/>
own children&#39;s schooling all by themselves, or with private help. That was<br/>
(is) how it should be.<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;ve come to what I jokingly call my senses, politically, and am a<br/>
libertarian, I have been ashamed of being in a group asking the government<br/>
(taxpayers) to fund a private activity. Not the least of what&#39;s wrong with<br/>
it is the fact that the government will always want to control it, and if<br/>
it&#39;s a school, that means *make it like its other schools -- rotten.*<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.  From what I&#39;ve seen, the vast majority of <br/>
people support the public schools, even a large percentage of <br/>
homeschoolers.  They may not like the way the schools do things, but most <br/>
don&#39;t want to get rid of them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what this means.  The example I gave was not a private school <br/>
with public funding.  It&#39;s a public school.  There was a similar one for <br/>
many years in Victoria.  In some places Montessori or Waldorf schools are <br/>
publically funded.  I don&#39;t have a problem with any of that.  If we&#39;re <br/>
going to have public schools at all (and I&#39;m aware you don&#39;t agree with <br/>
that) then I&#39;d say the more choices of educational styles the better.<br/>
