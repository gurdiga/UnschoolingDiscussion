<div id="ygrps-yiv-321252017">&lt;&lt;The experience of learning one is adopted seems&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to address this as the mom of 5 adopted children, several of<br/>
whom are old enough to put their emotional experiences into words.<br/>
<br/>
I am lucky enough to know and love the various birth parents and siblings of<br/>
my kids.  I know that the kids draw from both families but none of the kids<br/>
ever lived with their birthfamilies and only see them occasionally.  Adriane<br/>
and her birthmom both couldn&#39;t eat enough beets as babies and they both<br/>
underestimate the amount of room they need walking with others, tending to<br/>
bump slightly into people.  Adriane and I both love animals and would spend<br/>
most days with them.<br/>
<br/>
Zach has his birthfather&#39;s quick temper and explosiveness.  His birthmom&#39;s<br/>
nervous energy and metabolism.  But Zach has learned his coping skills from<br/>
us, how to channel his emotions into positive things.<br/>
<br/>
Marsie has the &quot;Caballero temper&quot; but the Stauffer smarts. The two youngest<br/>
kids are still sorting out their reactions to the world.<br/>
<br/>
I truly don&#39;t believe that you can separate nature from nurture.<br/>
