<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056441361">Well, keep in mind that you are getting a biased opinion ok? :-)  First, I<br/>
would eliminate all dairy (and animal products) Also eliminate processed<br/>
foods and anything that&#39;s really refined. Get white sugar out of there, and<br/>
white flour. I dont&#39; know how old he is, but I would start him on some<br/>
acidopholus right away, like yesterday. In case there is a problem with<br/>
yeast, and if the red bottom has been going on long term, that could be a<br/>
possibility. The acidopholus should help balance the bacteria in the tummy.<br/>
Important on the processed food though. If you are nursing, breast milk is<br/>
amazing for red bottoms. Other than that, buy some comfrey and steep it with<br/>
hot water (hot like for tea) and mix it up in the food processor and apply<br/>
that several times a day. It will be gone. Now, if you are going to go out<br/>
and buy some acidopholus, most capsules are &#39;enteric coated&#39; which means<br/>
that they are coated with gelatin. One that is widely available is the<br/>
Nature&#39;s Way children&#39;s powder. I&#39;ve called the company and it is completely<br/>
vegetarian. If you do end up with one that is gelatin coated, just pull the<br/>
capsule apart and add it to some cool rice milk (flavored if that helps) and<br/>
shake it up.<br/>
<br/>
Whew, I&#39;ve got to get out to the garden, THE SUN JUST CAME OUT! On a final<br/>
note, careful with your clothes washing soap/detergent and body soap. In my<br/>
opinion, detergents are just plain bad. A good natural laundry SOAP is best.<br/>
We use Sodasan. But there are many good brands, Bio Kleen, Ecover, etc. And<br/>
they are widely available. As far as bath soap, something very gentle and<br/>
natural. No &#39;fragrances&#39; in it. I would say purchase it at a natural foods<br/>
co-op or store if you can. Dr.Bronner&#39;s soaps are great. Also very, very<br/>
good for the skin is Chandrika Ayurvedic soap, little box, green bar. Hard<br/>
to find in some areas, you might want to find an Indian grocer and ask them<br/>
about it. Or your natural food store might be able to get ahold of it if<br/>
they don&#39;t carry it. I wouldn&#39;t suggest any bleach or fabric softener (you<br/>
might already have stopped using these things). The residues left in the<br/>
clothes (not to mention the harm to the environment) aren&#39;t worth it and can<br/>
irritate skin as well....<br/>
<br/>
Whew, I&#39;m out to do some planting and weeding.<br/>

is really quick and grinds them down to an almost powder.  The one I have<br/>
you measure into a little cap type affair and then you turn it upside to<br/>
remove the top and you have these really uniformly ground up little seeds. <br/>
