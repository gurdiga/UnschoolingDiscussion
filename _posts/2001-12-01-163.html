<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463690549">Hi all! I just joined this list and wanted to pop in for a quick intro. My <br/>
name is Mary, I&#39;m 41, married and have 2 kids ages 7 and 12. I&#39;ve been <br/>
lurking and reading your discussions for about a week now and I&#39;m LOVING it. <br/>
The math discussion has brought up ideas I haven&#39;t even begun to explore <br/>
yet. I was always great at school math, but never great at connecting it to <br/>
the real world. I&#39;m sure all of your brilliant questions and ideas will be <br/>
percolating in my brain for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;math as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the key to the universe.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if books by Steven Hawking might help with this? Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to be here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873978846">Hi everyone, new here.  I&#39;ve just gotten a few messages from the list so far<br/>
but this list seems great!  We&#39;re from WA state, 2 boys (see below).  I<br/>
joined this group after seeing Sandra&#39;s name, I *love* your articles in HEM<br/>
Sandra! :)<br/>
My 4 1/2 yr old is quite precocious academically and people around me think<br/>
that means I should be shoving curriculum down his throat...I think NOT!<br/>
lol.  He&#39;s a very self-motivated learner and I am amazed at the things he is<br/>
learning.<br/>
I would like to share a little panic that our house is being taken over by<br/>
posters, projects, books, maps, etc etc!!  I&#39;ve been doing a little<br/>
reorganization which is helping, but I only see it getting &quot;worse&quot; over<br/>
time.  Is my house doomed? :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423516561">Hello list members!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Mara, unschooling mom to three - an 8 YO boy, 6 YO boy and a <br/>
3 YO girl.  <br/>
<br/>
I have loved the idea of unschooling since I read about it three years <br/>
ago when I devoured everything Holt.  I have used the approach *for the <br/>
most part* even though I have hung onto trying out some T-eaching.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t usually work at all, so I listen to my kids and back off.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interesting in learning about more hands on activities for my <br/>
children.  Right now, what they mainly do is read, free imaginative <br/>
play, computer adventures, chess, and other games.  Because they have <br/>
asked, we have set up a drawing class, started Suzuki violin, and a <br/>
weekly spanish class we have at our home taught by the mom of one of <br/>
their friends.  My boys have recently gotten into LEGO kits and seem to <br/>
really enjoy building from a set of plans.  Anything Harry Potter is <br/>
also huge, and makes up a large amount of their imaginative play.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been looking at PCS Edventures and the Jason Project.  Does anyone <br/>
have experience with these programs?  I am mostly a book learner and <br/>
haven&#39;t developed my &#39;learn by doing&#39; side.  I wondered if these <br/>
projects would be a good jump off point for us, as we all seem to be <br/>
attracted to maths and sciences.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854873108">Welcome Mara,<br/>
I&#39;m new to this list also.  My sons are 15,15 and 10.  They love lego. <br/>
 When the twins were younger they would work on projects for hours. <br/>
 Looking back I am almost amassed at the amount of skills and knowledge <br/>
they gain just playing lego.  <br/>
They started enjoying the computer with Sim City 2000.  Now they play <br/>
all kind of computer adventures and simulations, like civ3.  Their free <br/>
imaginative play became drama classes (more of a friendly club with a <br/>
pro guiding them) where they learned to write, produce and act their own <br/>
creation.<br/>
I&#39;ve let go of teaching over the years.  I try to listen to clues and <br/>
provide assistance to their education needs.  I didn&#39;t want  to school <br/>
them.  My home has no school room.  Our whole house reflects that we <br/>
live here full time and educate here all over.  Yes even in the <br/>
bathroom, as a friend  remarked, which is full of magazines and books too.<br/>
I am a book learner too.  One of the twins is more of a book learner <br/>
also.  But the other two are doers.  The advantage of educating at home <br/>
has been that they freely developed their knowledge using their own <br/>
talents.  Using the whole world as your classroom does work. The twins <br/>
are now young inquisitive teenagers, but not half as frustrated as I <br/>
remember being (and so were my friends) at their age.  The end product ( <br/>
must there be one) is an independent, free range, life long learner, <br/>
happy Sons (in my case).  Unschooling does work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-806405748">Hello!<br/>
I&#39;m a newbie to this group and hope to learn a lot from all you <br/>
pioneering and most brave parents of unschooling.<br/>
I&#39;m a mom of three children, Catie (11), Bernadette Mary Clare (3), <br/>
Francis Patrick (2) and a fourth due in about three weeks.<br/>
<br/>
We have been traditionally homeschooling for about four-five years <br/>
but am finding it much more difficult with Catie for a myriad of <br/>
reasons.  Some of it has to do with her focusing ability, her <br/>
getting older, the material, and of course - two raving little <br/>
maniac toddlers who never sit still.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I need some advice on how to go about &quot;beginning&quot; this whole <br/>
process.  How do you begin to &quot;unschool&quot;???<br/>
I catch myself saying, &quot;Catie, did you do your math?  What book are <br/>
you doing now?&quot;<br/>
Doesn&#39;t seem like the way it&#39;s supposed to go, does it?<br/>
<br/>
My younger two have absolutely no interest in learning letters, <br/>
numbers, etc...<br/>
Is there a way to foster a desire in them to want to?<br/>
<br/>
My problem right now is that I am feeling a bit overwhelmed with the <br/>
new baby coming - I feel that we can&#39;t take a lot of time off from <br/>
learning because we already did a lot of that this past Sept. when <br/>
my 90 year old grandfather passed away (he was my best friend and I <br/>
was his only grandchild).<br/>
<br/>
My backyard is not yet conducive for the toddlers to be back there <br/>
playing - we have some landscaping to do and not enough $$.<br/>
The weather has been drippy and they&#39;ve been inside a lot - stir <br/>
crazy.<br/>
I&#39;m feeling really huge and can&#39;t get around very well and just feel <br/>
helpless....I&#39;m sure the pregnancy hormones aren&#39;t helping! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I guess I need to get some beginning first-timer pointers from those <br/>
of you who are more experienced at all of this.<br/>
How do you DO IT with the little kids that don&#39;t sit still and <br/>
basically just want to bean eachother in the head all day with <br/>
blocks????<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the ramble - I&#39;m just very glad to have found a place to <br/>
share.<br/>
<br/>
God Bless!<br/>

<br/>
The greatest changes, at first, will need to be all inside your own self.<br/>
When you hear yourself thinking or saying &quot;your math&quot;  stop yourself.  Math <br/>
belongs to everybody. She doesn&#39;t need to have any math of her own.   And <br/>
&quot;doing a book&quot;?  Doing WHAT to a book?<br/>
<br/>
Start to dismantle the school you have in your head.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My younger two have absolutely no interest in learning letters, <br/>

<br/>
I would rather help you get over the desire to wait impatiently for them to <br/>
develop an interest in learning letters, numbers, etc.   They&#39;ll learn them.  <br/>
Are you in a hurry?<br/>
<br/>
Do they like Seasme Street?  Do you have the kid-tape called &quot;Sounds Like <br/>
Fun&quot;?  My kids liked that one alot when they were little.  It used to come from <br/>
Discovery Toys, but I see them used here and there.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I feel that we can&#39;t take a lot of time off from <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to hear about your grandfather&#39;s passing.   That must&#39;ve been rough <br/>
for everyone.  But I bet they kept learning.  Unschooling is about seeing the <br/>
learning everywhere, and not sorting life into learning days and <br/>
non-learning.  <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of things I&#39;ve already written that might be helpful.  Sorry <br/>
to seem lazy about it, but if I tried to say it again I probably wouldn&#39;t say <br/>
it as well anyway.<br/>

<time>13 Apr 2006, at 12:07pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543828214">Thought I would send an intro since I&#39;ve now posted twice in two days (a lot<br/>
for me).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Janet and been married to Tim for 21 years this June.  We have 5<br/>
daughters:  Hannah 16, Rachael 14, Abra 8, and Abby and BG 5.  Outside of<br/>
Hannah being in a private preschool and public kindergarten, they&#39;ve always<br/>
been.  The two oldest have toyed with going to school but right now say they<br/>
are content being home.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When we first started homeschooling, the only homeschoolers I knew were<br/>
pretty traditional (textbook), the most relaxed ones using unit studies.<br/>
But all I knew were very authoritative, rule oriented parents.  I never did<br/>
quite fit in.  Early on I heard about unschoolers but everything I read<br/>
seemed centered around academics, not parenting.  It seemed like part of the<br/>
whole picture missing something.  I came across radical unschooling on a<br/>
traditional homeschool message board where they were ripping it up one side<br/>
and down the other.  I followed some links and found Sandra&#39;s site.  That&#39;s<br/>
when the whole picture started coming together for me.  I&#39;ve been very<br/>
challenged at times.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling is radical.  For me it has required an open mind and a<br/>
willingness to throw out those things that I&#39;d accepted as truths.  I&#39;ve<br/>
discussed radical unschooling with a few friends, and I see how hard it is<br/>
for people to get their minds around it.  Parents want to feel important and<br/>
in control.  When I talk about letting go of controls and being a partner (I<br/>
love that idea) all they can see is that their role is diminished.  Well<br/>
then, what do they need parents for?  It&#39;s hard to get past that.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
want that adversarial relationship with my children which I think is<br/>
unadvoidable (from what I&#39;ve witnessed) in the traditional parent<br/>
(authoritative/rule maker/enforcer) - children (obedient/submissive) type<br/>
family.  As we&#39;ve let go of controls, our relationship with our children has<br/>
blossomed.  I&#39;m not their adversary that they have to figure out a way to<br/>
get around.  We work together, they come to me, I actually feel more<br/>
important and needed than before when we had rules (and we never had a lot<br/>
at that).  Our life is so much more joyful.  I like my children.  They are<br/>
really neat, unique people.  I like being around them.  And they certainly<br/>
act like they like their dad and me.  I believe they do.  For me, that&#39;s<br/>
been the best treasure of radical unschooling.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851019925">I&#39;ve been saying i would do this and haven&#39;t and now a few of you have<br/>
mentioned that you don&#39;t know the ages of my children. So here you are.<br/>
Lilith is my internet handle. I am 24 years old, and married for a<br/>
year to a man who is not my children&#39;s biological father. He has been<br/>
raising them with me for the past four years. I started having<br/>
children at a young age, 17. My two sons are ages 7 years and 4 years.<br/>
I am currently due to give birth to my third son( who is DH&#39;s boy) in<br/>
about a week. We live in Texas. I decided to home school before my<br/>
first son was born because i saw lots of things wrong with public<br/>
learning institutions from my own experiences. I dropped out of high<br/>
school when i was 16 because i had been suspended for a whole semester<br/>
for dying my hair against the schools rules and refusing to change it<br/>
back. I have homeschooled in a partially structured way with my older<br/>
son, but have tried finding ways to get away from that structure. I<br/>
came across the idea of unschooling a while back, but didn&#39;t jump<br/>
right in because of the lack of support from the rest of my family,<br/>
particularly my mother, who fusses at me constantly about him not<br/>
being on par with other children his age. I&#39;m taking leaps and bounds<br/>
to try doing things differently now with or without her support.<br/>
Fortunately for me my husband and i see eye to eye about it and i have<br/>
his support which should really matter a lot more anyway. Yes i know i<br/>
have a problem with run on sentences. I try, but tend to write how i<br/>
talk. :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682236276">Hello everyone,<br/>
My name is Libby, and I live in Aotearoa/New Zealand. I&#39;ve ben a lurker on <br/>
this group for a few months. (I&#39;m cross-posting this to Always Unschooled <br/>
and Always Learning as it is relevant to both groups). My family (dp, ds1 <br/>
5.25yrs, ds2 2.75yrs) and I live in a house bus. The event of my eldest <br/>
child approaching the age of 5 lead me to this group. Homeschooling is what <br/>
we decided we were going to do, and was also the only practical option given <br/>
the gypsy nature of our life. So I began to explore the topic. I found that <br/>
there is more than one type of homeschooling! I found unschooling! I found <br/>
radical unschooling! (I won&#39;t use this term again, promise &lt;g&gt;). This last I <br/>
found first at the RUA group in New Zealand. A member there posted a <br/>
recommendation of Sandra&#39;s website and that was my start, there and Joyce&#39;s. <br/>
Another post pointed me to this group (and the always unschooled group) and <br/>
so began my indepth awakening to natural learning/unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I have learnt so much from reading all the posts. I have just caught up with <br/>
a backlog of posts (due to disruption to my routine over Xmas/New Year <br/>
hols)! I was almost overwhelmed by the number of digests I had to read but I <br/>
didn&#39;t want to delete any of them just in case there was something I really <br/>
needed to know in there! It sems that every question I have had so far has <br/>
been answered in the posts.<br/>
<br/>
I am excited to say I have had an epiphany! Someone (I think it was Danielle <br/>
on Always Unschooled but I&#39;m not sure) wrote something just recently which <br/>
had the words<br/>
&#39;behaviour is communication&#39; in it. This phrase has been reverberating <br/>
around in my head and shedding much light in dark places in there. It has <br/>
helped sooo much with the way I intereact with my two little people. I have <br/>
also been interested in how others deal with their frustration/anger as <br/>
that&#39;s one of my big issues. My mother was/is a &#39;rageaholic&#39; and I struggle <br/>
to stay away from that path. Yesterday was a tough day for several reasons<br/>
and I lost it with my children 3 times and I&#39;m sooo ashamed. I&#39;m an adult <br/>
and I should be able to deal with my stuff better than this.<br/>
Any strategies/BTDT much appreciated.<br/>

&gt; Hello everyone,<br/>
&gt; My name is Libby, and I live in Aotearoa/New Zealand. I&#39;ve ben a  <br/>
&gt; lurker on<br/>
&gt; this group for a few months. (I&#39;m cross-posting this to Always  <br/>
&gt; Unschooled<br/>
&gt; and Always Learning as it is relevant to both groups). My family  <br/>
&gt; (dp, ds1<br/>
&gt; 5.25yrs, ds2 2.75yrs) and I live in a house bus. The event of my  <br/>
&gt; eldest<br/>
&gt; child approaching the age of 5 lead me to this group. Homeschooling  <br/>
&gt; is what<br/>
&gt; we decided we were going to do, and was also the only practical  <br/>
&gt; option given<br/>
&gt; the gypsy nature of our life. So I began to explore the topic. I  <br/>
&gt; found that<br/>
&gt; there is more than one type of homeschooling! I found unschooling!  <br/>
&gt; I found<br/>
&gt; radical unschooling! (I won&#39;t use this term again, promise &lt;g&gt;).  <br/>
&gt; This last I<br/>
&gt; found first at the RUA group in New Zealand. A member there posted a<br/>
&gt; recommendation of Sandra&#39;s website and that was my start, there and  <br/>
&gt; Joyce&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; Another post pointed me to this group (and the always unschooled  <br/>
&gt; group) and<br/>
&gt; so began my indepth awakening to natural learning/unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The term written out in full doesn&#39;t bother me at all.  Calling it RU  <br/>
does.  It might be just me, but this is just my list. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in the SCA, and it&#39;s too hard to say &quot;The Society for Creative  <br/>
Anachronism&quot; all the time, so most people in the S-C-A- say &quot;the Ess  <br/>
See Aee&quot; (however that would be spelled out), but there are some  <br/>
other places where a smaller number of people pronounce it &quot;sca&quot; and  <br/>
it sounds like the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;scab&quot; and it&#39;s just nasty.  So they talk  <br/>
about their &quot;sca armor&quot; and it sounds like &quot;skahmer&quot; and their  <br/>
&quot;scanames&quot; and it can be very offputting to people they talk to (even  <br/>
those who know what they&#39;re talking about, but especially to people  <br/>
outside the club who might possibly have been interested in learning  <br/>
more).<br/>
<br/>
Knowing as we all do that &quot;unschooling&quot; itself can cause some recoil  <br/>
in an unknowing audience, there are major problems with RU.  Either  <br/>
it&#39;s pronounced to sound like &quot;are you&quot; or &quot;rue,&quot; and both are awful.<br/>
<br/>
(So... but to the real post) Good!  Welcome to the group.<br/>

I love to hear about epiphanies.  I collect them here:<br/>

<br/>
As you experienced at the mall, often the mom-frustration is lessened  <br/>
by being out away from the house.  We found that visiting with  <br/>
relatives in public places was much less stressful than our house or  <br/>
theirs, too.<br/>

Well nobody rues you (that I know of; haven&#39;t interviewed all high  <br/>
school dates), but people shouldn&#39;t be rue-ing their children.   <br/>
(Unless they think of it as mothering-as-Rue-does, and that&#39;s just  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806332758">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I have posted a couple suggestions so I thought I would go ahead and <br/>
introduce myself -- especially since I noticed another Cathy <br/>
introduced herself as well -- could be confusing &lt;g&gt; since there are <br/>
not so many of us &#39;C&#39; Cathys.<br/>
<br/>
So I am Cathy L, in Estes Park Colorado.  I was on this list about 3 <br/>
years ago and was totally confronted and overwhelmed by the <br/>
discussions (and then a little rude *blush* - thanks for your <br/>
patience Sandra).  With three young children I decided I had <br/>
better &#39;start&#39; at the AU board.  Recently I have been wanting to get <br/>
more insight into some of the older kid stuff ... and after talking <br/>
with a couple of friends who participate and lurk on this list I <br/>
thought maybe it was time to come back over here.  The thread about <br/>
disrepect was great, some of my ponderings were addressed witout me <br/>
ever having to speak up.<br/>
<br/>
I am married to Garth and we have two sons, Quin, who is 8.5yo, and <br/>
Zach, who is 3.5yo, and a daughter, Maggie, who turned 6 in January.  <br/>
I admit I am totally biased, but they are awesome!  <br/>
<br/>
Quin is into video games (gamecube and wii) and karate, and he has <br/>
very eclectic taste in movies (for example, he will watch a <br/>
documentary ten times in a row and switch to Pokemon x 5 and and then <br/>
House of the Flying Daggers, then Handy Manny) -- he enjoys media <br/>
entertainment fully!  Food is way down on his priority list ... he <br/>
has been teaching me a lot about trust.<br/>
<br/>
Maggie is into arts and crafts, is teaching herself to read by making <br/>
art out of words, and loves singing and dancing and gymnastics.  She <br/>
has a closet full of dress up clothes and is right now letting me <br/>
know that this is taking too long -- she has been ready since <br/>
yesterday to go to the local thrift store to find some more dress up <br/>
treasures.  She tends to be more emotionally sensitive ... she has <br/>
been teaching me a lot about the power of language and the importance <br/>
of validation.<br/>
<br/>
Zach is, I don&#39;t know how to describe him, he is just one of those <br/>
kids that is generally happy and easy going, which isn&#39;t to say that <br/>
he isn&#39;t really good at expressing his emotions, letting his family <br/>
members and friends know when they have made him mad or frustrated or <br/>
happy or sad.  He will tell you he is three, but clearly believes <br/>
that it means nothing since he is *obviously* the same age as his <br/>
siblings.  Zach is the one whose existence somehow led me to <br/>
unschooling, one of those cool and totally convoluted paths that <br/>
makes you believe that everything really does happen for a reason.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that is more and less than anyone needs to know, looking <br/>
forward to soaking in the wisdom of this list.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Cathy in CO</div>

<br/>
Hey, it snowed at your house maybe?<br/>
<br/>
 From  having three kids and the many too-long-a-story experiences  <br/>
even before then, I know that confrontation, overwhelmedness and  <br/>
rudeness are part of the way some people learn.   It doesn&#39;t faze  <br/>
me.   Being cursed to hell makes me laugh, and being threatened by my  <br/>
own karma was a gift to keep.  If you weren&#39;t this rude, don&#39;t feel bad:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I read your entire website before I subscribed to the list. If all  <br/>
you can do is refer people to read more material � you cannot help  <br/>
me. If I wanted to read more about unschooling information I would  <br/>
buy a book. I have read everything I could get a hold of. What I need  <br/>
is rewording of everyday situations. I spend almost all day everyday  <br/>
with my children, how dare you imply that I don�t spend enough time  <br/>
with my children. My computer sits in the mainstream of our life and  <br/>
we all spend a good deal of time on it �<br/>
<br/>
You know what it doesn�t matter any more I don�t need to explain  <br/>
myself to you. I have unsubscribed from your fucking list. I am sick  <br/>
of your high and mighty attitude. The controlling nature of this list  <br/>
is more then my unschooling mind can understand. You are closed  <br/>
minded and I truly hope karma smites you and yours.<br/>
<br/>
=============================<br/>
<br/>
All I was doing was asking her (again) to remove the advertisements  <br/>
from her sigline.  Other moderators (on a different list) had asked  <br/>
her to, too, but I don&#39;t think she cursed them with smiting.   It  <br/>
didn&#39;t scare me or hurt my feelings.<br/>
<br/>
I wondered what book it was she would buy if she wanted to learn more  <br/>
about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And I wondered how she had read my entire website.  I can&#39;t even FIND  <br/>
all of &quot;my entire website.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But unfortunately for her, karma doesn&#39;t work like &quot;go to hell&quot; works  <br/>
(and that&#39;s never worked very well anyway, unless the pope or a  <br/>
bishop said it to someone who really believed they had the back-stage  <br/>
passes in hand).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So here it is, the years are passing, hell is doing whatever it&#39;s  <br/>
doing, karma&#39;s doing what it does, I&#39;m doing what I do, and people of  <br/>
all ages are still learning in their own ways all around me, and far  <br/>
away from me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199299165">Hello, I am new to this list.  My name is Heidi and I will be unschooling my 7 yod in the fall.  She is in a little school this year.  She is actually our only child that has been in elementary school.  We unhomeschooled our five older children until they chose to go to school. My oldest never went to school and will be graduating from college in June, the second went (when she learned to read ) at ninth grade and in currently in college, our third has been playing professional hockey so he is just attending full time this year as a junior in high school, the other two went in this year as 7 and 9th grades.  I was also able to homeschool our 14yo foster daughter after she had her baby.  I was surprised at how supportive the state was about unschooling her and letting her be with her baby.  She is now 18 and in college also.  <br/>
I learned about homeschooling in Canada in the late 80&#39;s.  We decided then that this was the life we wanted for our family.  I learned from &quot;Growing Without Schooling,&quot; John Holt and all of the wonderful authors from that magazine.  We loved it and living in the country provided endless opportunities for play, creativity and meaningful work.  We unexpectedly got pregnant with #7 last year.  He is seven months and I am starting to feel like my head is starting to float to the top. <br/>
I hope to get motivated again by this group and also will be attending Life is Good in Vancouver, WA.  It will be strange for me to unschool a single child with a much younger sibling in tow.  I imagine it will be a totally new experience for me.  I am feeling a bit nervous because it seems like something we are doing rather than just who we are.  My continuum was broken by sending her to school and I am wondering how hard it will be to deschool her.  <br/>
Looking forward to being here and participating.<br/>
Heidi<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408771418">If I get the math right, your kids are about 7 yrs apart?  Mine are <br/>
too.  I only have 2.  It has it&#39;s positives and negatives.  One <br/>
awesome positive is that having a totally unschooled teenager helps <br/>
us all get along.  She&#39;s much much nicer to her little sister than <br/>
most teens would be to their much younger siblings.  They aren&#39;t play <br/>
mates by any means, but they do stuff together anyway.<br/>
<br/>
My teen makes for an awesome sitter, and helper, and mediator.  My <br/>
youngest isn&#39;t the easiest person to live with, as awesome as she <br/>
is!  It has also helped her get a nice sitting job, with that <br/>
experience of watching her little sister on occasion for the last 2 <br/>
yrs.  My younger daughter has the benefit of really knowing how to <br/>
hold her own in the company of older people, largely from always <br/>
being around older people.  It doesn&#39;t make her less of a 6 1/2 yr <br/>
old, just one who has a different understanding than a 6 yr old that <br/>
only hangs with others her own age.<br/>
<br/>
The single hardest thing all along has been finding mutual activities <br/>
for all of the family because of the age difference.  We&#39;ve done it <br/>
for the most part, but it takes a lot more thought, then if we had 2 <br/>
kids close in age.</div>
