&lt;&lt; I am not saying he IS watching this stuff.  I am saying that from <br/>
 what you are telling me, you can&#39;t say with much authority that he <br/>
 ISN&#39;T, because you aren&#39;t really paying enough attention to know. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am going to answer this because although you did not direct it at me this <br/>
time, I was the one that originally said my son stays up until 2 or 3 am <br/>
watching tv and NO I do not &quot;monitor&quot; the content and YES I do trust him to <br/>
decide what he is comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I am highly offended by your last comment. &quot;you aren&#39;t really <br/>
paying enough attention to know&quot;<br/>
That was completely rude, false and shows you haven&#39;t been reading this <br/>
thread very carefully.<br/>
If any of the parent&#39;s here aren&#39;t paying attention at every possible level <br/>
with deep, caring concern and friendship, could you please point me to the <br/>
post that makes you feel any one of us are doing this?<br/>
How could you possibly read &quot;not paying attention&quot; into any one of the posts <br/>
I, or anyone else advocating choices, wrote?<br/>
First of all, I have been up with my son many times watching shows with him <br/>
until very, very late.<br/>
Secondly, he DOES talk to me about everything he sees because he knows that <br/>
I&#39;m not going to freak out. He knows I&#39;m going to ask questions about it, <br/>
comment on it and ask if it was a good episode.<br/>
Adults have access to porn...ALL adults in this country pretty much. Why <br/>
don&#39;t they all watch it? Do you think that all men enjoy it? My dh doesn&#39;t, <br/>
but he knows I wouldn&#39;t freak out if he did want it so he has no reason to <br/>
hide it from me.<br/>
I have told him point blank that I thought it was pretty weird that he never <br/>
bought girly magazines or wanted to watch an erotic movie with me...he just <br/>
doesn&#39;t.  And he knows that if he did want to I am not a person he would have <br/>
to hide it from....hence my trust that he isn&#39;t trying to hide anything.<br/>
Same with my son. He knows that I have sex books in the house. He knows I <br/>
have a Kama Sutra game in my closet, he asked what it was about and I told <br/>
him.<br/>
Sure he&#39;s pretty interested in human bodies and doesn&#39;t want to advertise <br/>
that interest. But anything violent or too intimate bothers him. And if it <br/>
didn&#39;t, he&#39;d be watching it.<br/>
You are assuming a lot of rotten things about children, which really shows me <br/>
your lack of trust in their sensibilities.<br/>
<br/>
AND the fact that my tv gets NO porn....whether you understand all the cable <br/>
packages in the U.S. or not, I don&#39;t get porn, anytime, anywhere. <br/>
And it wouldn&#39;t matter if I did.<br/>
Let&#39;s say worst case scenario...he watches some. He&#39;s fascinated and is very <br/>
curious.<br/>
You know what? Yes, he&#39;d talk to me about it. Because I wouldn&#39;t freak out, I <br/>
would ask him what he thought. I would explain that it is not a realistic <br/>
version of sex in an intimate relationship and I would show him some sex <br/>
books and talk to him.<br/>
I&#39;m a safe haven. Not his enemy.<br/>
You are assuming children can have no power over persuasive ads or tv <br/>
manipulations, but adults can?<br/>
I have more faith in my childs sense, wit and ability to know himself and <br/>
what he&#39;s about.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s great for you.  Not necessarily so great for your son.  I don&#39;t <br/>
believe my child wants to die.  I trust her sense of <br/>
self-preservation.  Heck, she can even swim!  But she doesn&#39;t go <br/>
out to the pool deck alone.  There are dangers , and I monitor her <br/>
when she is out there.  One could also refer to that as &#39;paying <br/>
attention&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
No, porn won&#39;t kill or maim him.  But he might not recognize the <br/>
subtle ways in which it can affect him.  I am not assuming any <br/>
&#39;rotten things&#39; about your son, or any other child, but I am aware <br/>
that porn is dangerous, deliberately fascinating and compelling <br/>
stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
I would never advocate &#39;freaking out&#39;, for Pete&#39;s sake.  I am <br/>
advocating keeping tabs on things that could be potentially <br/>
detrimental, so that you can discuss it before it sinks in too deep.  <br/>
My question was, &quot;Do you monitor this at all?&quot;  The answer was, <br/>
&quot;Nope.&quot;  This tells me that you are not paying attention.  If you <br/>
WERE paying attention, the answer would have been &quot;Yes.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
I think people in general--not talking about anyone on this list--<br/>
assume children don&#39;t have any power over thise things because they <br/>
don&#39;t believe that children *should* have any power over much of <br/>
anything.  They don&#39;t give them any credit for being able to reason <br/>
through things on any level.  And they don&#39;t bother to talk to them <br/>
about things because they don&#39;t think they are capable of <br/>
understanding.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I, do think some people are more succeptible to the allure of <br/>
commercials though. My dd for one!  She wants a lot of what she sees <br/>
on TV--she was especially fascinated by the egg wave.  She also <br/>
thinks a lot of the stain removers look cool.  We have TiVo (which is <br/>
wonderful btw) and my ds will ff through commercials but my dd <br/>
sometimes wants to watch them all.</div>

<br/>
Is this projection?  <br/>
Are you assuming that ALL people will be fascinated by the same things?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Compelling&quot; will have to do with a person&#39;s interests and needs (as in <br/>
needing a distraction, or something to do, or a sort of input or knowledge).<br/>
<br/>
My friend Ric finds ANYTHING about the Indianapolis 500 compelling.  I&#39;ve <br/>
never found anything about it even vaguely interesting.    (I did drive <br/>
another friend from Michigan around Albuquerque looking for Unser Blvd signs <br/>
and such, because HE was compelled to know more Indy trivia...)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;My question was, &quot;Do you monitor this at all?&quot;  The answer was, <br/>
&quot;Nope.&quot;  This tells me that you are not paying attention. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Monitor&quot; means keep a constant scan on, keep records, be vigilantly alert.<br/>
I don&#39;t &quot;watch Kirby like a hawk.&quot;  I live with Kirby in daily, close, soft, <br/>
aware conditions.<br/>
<br/>
Your visions of the relationship between a teenaged boy and a mom seem not to <br/>
contain the relationships unschoolers are describing here.  If you go to one <br/>
of the conferences where lots of unschoolers will be you will feel very <br/>
differently after meeting and seeing some of these teens in action and with <br/>
their families.<br/>
<br/>
Paying attention and living in trust are NOT &quot;monitoring,&quot; which is based on <br/>
distrust.<br/>

room to watch some when he hears them on. He never bugs me about getting any <br/>
of them, he just likes to watch and knows all the little catch phrases to <br/>
them and ask be about them all the time. If they do what they say they do <br/>
and all. My daughter could care less but she thinks some are really funny. <br/>
My youngest, who has no interest in TV for even a second will actually watch <br/>
certain commercials for a brief moment. I&#39;m not sure what it is about them.<br/>

means &quot; to watch, keep track of, or check, usually for a special <br/>
purpose, not &quot;Turn your home onto an oppressive prison in <br/>
which children are stunted and warped by shaming and <br/>
controlling parents.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have tired of this.  It is clear that real discourse is not your <br/>
desire - that became clear  a while ago, and I should have given <br/>
up then, but it was late last night, and I was tired.  You expect that <br/>
everyone around you should examine their parenting and <br/>
compare it to your perfect standard.  Obviously, having reached <br/>
perfection in your parenting, you needn&#39;t examine your own <br/>
practices any further.  How comforting that must be.  <br/>

The posts that have flowed through here over the past 2 days represent a lot<br/>
of hours trying to answer questions. If the answers haven&#39;t been<br/>
understandable, perhaps it would be helpful to picture that when two very<br/>
different points of view try to communicate they are almost speaking<br/>
different languages. Getting angry because someone doesn&#39;t seem to make<br/>

other, and want to do so helpfully and peacefully.  <br/>
All we can do is talk about our ideas and how and why we reached them and<br/>
share the results with others who might have never thought of things that<br/>
way before. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling opens up our minds to endless possibilities of natural<br/>
learning.  Applying that unschooling philosophy to the rest of our lives,<br/>
not just reading and math is a natural progression.   Some here have just<br/>
been trying to explain that natural progression from &quot;letting them learn<br/>
to read at their own pace and in their own way&quot;  to &quot;letting them learn<br/>
at their own pace and in their own way.&quot;   <br/>
No one here has been talking about being neglectful parents.  As<br/>
unschoolers we are starting from the place of being very deeply involved<br/>
parents and seeing the value in natural learning in ALL things, not just<br/>
math or reading.<br/>
There is real value in trusting children and those here who are saying<br/>
they&#39;ve found that value and see it every day are only sharing what they<br/>
know to be true. <br/>
<br/>
If you heard someone say they were Jewish, Orthodox even, but then they<br/>
invited you over for a ham sandwich, wouldn&#39;t it seem odd to you that the<br/>
one thing didn&#39;t jive with the other?  ( I figured the Christians could<br/>
use a break )   So it is with unschooling, to hear someone say they are,<br/>
but then that they don&#39;t feel like they can trust their children, well,<br/>
it naturally brings up some questions.  I think that&#39;s healthy. <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Good heavens.  Are you being deliberately obtuse?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yes, you clearly are.  I am not goping to waste my time explaining <br/>
to you the difference between pornography and the Indy 500.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Analogies are valid tools in logical discussion.  And to say something is <br/>
&quot;compelling&quot; means something.  WHAT do you mean by &quot;compelling&quot;?  That one <br/>
can be drawn in by it and become mesmerized?  IF SO, then not all people are <br/>
compelled by the same things, and so to say porn or indy is &quot;compelling&quot; does <br/>
not make it so for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
If it is compelling FOR YOU you should not automatically assume it is also <br/>
compelling for everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
There are people here saying not everyone is drawn to porn.  You seem to be <br/>
suggesting everyone IS in danger, because it is &quot;compelling.&quot;  If it is <br/>
compelling for you, and to you, then that is your personal deal.  It is NOT <br/>
compelling for all people.  IF you insist that it is, that would seem to be <br/>
projection.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sandra, you might want to look up &#39;monitor&#39; in the dictionary. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know what it means.  I know what projection and compelling are too.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re going to have specialized meanings for all your words, we can&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Obviously, having reached <br/>
perfection in your parenting, you needn&#39;t examine your own <br/>

Do you know what I am vigilant about?  Do you know what I monitor?<br/>
<br/>
My reactions to my children.<br/>

&gt;I really think people here are trying to share good information with each<br/>

&gt;All we can do is talk about our ideas and how and why we reached them and<br/>

list. What I see, and have seen before on this list, is that in most cases <br/>
it doesn&#39;t come across that way. It seems to come from some long time <br/>
members who have a tendency to jump on the newcomers who are honestly and <br/>
hopefully looking for support in their new found or difficult journey of <br/>
unschooling, whether it be recent or not. I&#39;m sure their intentions ARE good <br/>
and maybe it&#39;s that this all comes so naturally to them that it&#39;s hard to <br/>
see it as any other way. What it does look like, from some, is the &quot;not in <br/>
my house never with my kids I always know exactly what to do and always have <br/>
attitude.&quot; That&#39;s what turns people off and makes others defensive. I&#39;ve <br/>
heard people actually tell others they are wrong in what they are doing with <br/>
their children or what they are thinking. That&#39;s not right and it&#39;s <br/>
certainly not going to help people come to any realizations either on their <br/>
own or with anyone&#39;s help. It&#39;s none of anyone else&#39;s business what they do <br/>
with their kids and if someone is getting on this list, I think it&#39;s because <br/>
they want support and help, so blasting them as to what they are doing isn&#39;t <br/>
right. Some have actually said, &quot;what I do when that happens is, or why <br/>
don&#39;t you try etc&quot; but for the most part, no solutions have been mentioned, <br/>
just nit picking terms and words and some saying that what they are doing is <br/>
wrong. It&#39;s not a bit of wonder why out of the hundreds subscribed to this <br/>
list, only a handful post. .<br/>
<br/>
Now I know this is just my opinion, but maybe some of you should slow down <br/>
and try to help instead of intimidating. Some of you are down right scary.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is part of that language problem. The word &quot;monitor&quot; is most often used<br/>
in the current culture to imply constantly watching. That&#39;s what a heart<br/>
monitor does. It may not control but it is constantly watching, not poking<br/>
in occasionally to see how everyone&#39;s doing. If you apply that denotation of<br/>
monitor to parents and children, it carries the message of constantly<br/>
keeping an eye on them.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the original question was about monitoring the *TV* a 12 yo watches at<br/>
2 or 3AM. But since a 12 yo is perfectly capable of choosing what he<br/>
watches, is knowing what they could stumble over meaningful unless we assume<br/>
that they won&#39;t just glance and pass by but stop and choose to watch it?<br/>
<br/>
As someone suggested, &quot;monitoring&quot; or watching over a 3 yo is a good idea.<br/>
The world they have access to is more dangerous than they&#39;re capable of<br/>
understanding.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Monitoring&quot; a 12&#39;s TV choices implies that the world they will voluntarily<br/>
choose to access is more dangerous than they&#39;re capable of understanding.<br/>
That the images they will choose to voluntarily watch or be compelled to<br/>
watch against their will carry dangers they aren&#39;t capable of understanding.<br/>
<br/>
And this is where the discussion has gotten muddled.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t being clearly defined what it is the 12 yo is capable of stumbling<br/>
over. Porn is being used and interpretted in a variety of ways and it&#39;s not<br/>
really clear that the answerers are using a different definition of porn<br/>
from the original questioner.<br/>
<br/>
To *me* porn means the type of movies not shown on regular expanded cable<br/>
(cable with regular movie channels like HBO and Cinemax.) Porn to me is<br/>
stuff you need to go to the backroom of a video rental store for. (I did a<br/>
check of the 2AM-3AM movies for tonight. Mostly R (though some below, none<br/>
above). Mostly for violence. The only two movies that seem to be about sex<br/>
are:<br/>
<br/>
L.A. Johns (Not rated) (HBO2) - The affairs of a top-dollar call girl<br/>
(Brittney Powell), whose diverse clients include a CEO who likes to be<br/>
dominated and a divorcé who&#39;s out to reform her. Madam Jack: Deborah Harry.<br/>
Josh: John Terry. David: Thomas Calabro. Roger: Doug Davidson. Joyce Chopra<br/>
directed.<br/>
<br/>
Cupid (R) (TMC) - Incestuous siblings solve their romantic troubles with<br/>
murder. Zach Galligan, Ashley Laurence, Mary Crosby.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that&#39;s typical, that would be the level of &quot;porn&quot; that a 12 yo<br/>
could stumble over or choose to watch. *If* the family has cable. And *if*<br/>
the family subscribes to movie channels.)<br/>
<br/>
So it would make the discussion clearer if those with questions were more<br/>
clear about the type of content -- maybe specific movies -- that they would<br/>
be concerned about a 12 yo stumbling over. The term porn is just too vague.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also not clear why the 12 yo is watching.<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked what to do about a one time traumatizing incident. I *think*<br/>
in that question is the suggestion that it&#39;s possible that seeing one image<br/>
could scar a child for life. So perhaps that&#39;s why the answers -- that the<br/>
relationship is such that the kids will bring anything that troubles them to<br/>
the parents -- aren&#39;t seeming satisfying.<br/>
<br/>
And another question seems to be about them watching &quot;porn&quot; and the<br/>
questions aren&#39;t all using &quot;watching&quot; to mean the same thing. Some are<br/>
refering to seeing a movie that is troubling. Some are saying that it&#39;s<br/>
natural for (some) kids to want to see it so they&#39;ll watch it eagerly. And<br/>
in that eagerness they will build up some unhealthy ideas about<br/>
relationships. Some are saying that porn is addictive or compelling so kids<br/>
will be compelled to watch it even though they don&#39;t feel totally<br/>
comfortable doing so and they&#39;ll get sucked into that dark alley. Some are<br/>
saying that porn is so compelling that the images of men degrading women<br/>
will override the loving relationship images that have been modeled for 12<br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
So why the 12 yos are watching needs cleared up before the discussion will<br/>
yield any satisfying answers for the questioners.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You haven&#39;t asked ONE question to clarify<br/>
&gt; &#39;where I am coming from&#39;.  You assume you just &#39;know&#39;, and you<br/>
&gt; &#39;projected&#39; all kinds of assumptions and beliefs onto me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The words we use don&#39;t carry what *we* mean into someone&#39;s head. The words<br/>
attempt to *recreate* what we mean in someone&#39;s head. And if the words we&#39;ve<br/>
used mean something different to the person we&#39;re talking to, that person<br/>
will respond as though we&#39;ve asked a totally different question than what we<br/>
think we asked.<br/>
<br/>
I think, not just here but in general, that it isn&#39;t the responsibility of<br/>
the answerer to figure out what we mean. It&#39;s *nice* if someone takes extra<br/>
time to help us ask what we&#39;re trying to ask. And the reason it&#39;s nice<br/>
rather than expected is because whenever we ask a question we are imposing<br/>
on someone&#39;s time. Yes, they voluntarily choose to answer but volunteering<br/>
to help doesn&#39;t mean they owe us anything. We owe it to ourselves -- because<br/>
presumably we want the answer! -- and we owe it to those trying to help to<br/>
be as clear as possible so we don&#39;t waste their time. Sometimes that means<br/>
working extra hard at figuring out what their answers mean and why they are<br/>
answering the way they are. Sometimes that means rewording our question.<br/>
Sometimes that means figuring out how the answerer is using words<br/>
differently than we are and adapting our language to theirs.<br/>

So perhaps a better place to start is &quot;Do you think pornography is damaging<br/>
to kids?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(How is pornography defined? How are the kids accessing it? It&#39;s being<br/>
assumed there&#39;s some common foundation everyone&#39;s operating from and that<br/>
isn&#39;t true.)<br/>
<br/>
But what&#39;s *really* tough and makes the discussions difficult is basing a<br/>
discussion on hypotheticals. Any situation can be hypothesized. And &quot;what<br/>
if&#39;s&quot; can lead anywhere. They can be seemingly perfectly reasonable &quot;what<br/>
ifs&quot; -- eg, &quot;What if your son were watching pornography?&quot; but the problem is<br/>
they don&#39;t match a real situation. If the situation isn&#39;t real we can only<br/>
discuss what and not why. And it&#39;s the why that&#39;s most important. Whether a<br/>
12 yo should watch pornography is ultimately merely an exercise in argument<br/>
beacuse the real issue is *why* a particular 12 yo is watching pornography.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or agreeing on what pornography is exactly. I don&#39;t think what is shown on <br/>
cable is porn, some do. I do think that there are some specific shows on <br/>
channels like HBO, Cinemax, and Showtime that are what could be described as <br/>
*soft* porn. But I don&#39;t think those are any worse than what you could <br/>
possibly see in a movie. It&#39;s just that is all you see in these shows. I <br/>
don&#39;t think Playboy is porn, but I do think there are magazines out there <br/>
that are porn. I think it is natural for a 12 to whatever age teen boy to be <br/>
interested, or curious and want to see what all the hoopla is about. And I <br/>
don&#39;t see anything nasty or wrong with that. I also think the same goes for <br/>
girls. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with a young boy having a Cosmo, or a <br/>
Playboy or whatever in his bedroom or bathroom. I know when I was a teen, <br/>
(there aren&#39;t that many magazines out for girls) I read harlequin romances <br/>
and the best parts were the pages I dogeared. &lt;g&gt; I also found a copy of <br/>
Playgirl once and WOW! That was fun for me! &lt;bg&gt; (I think I still might have <br/>
that stashed away in one of my boxes saved from highschool.) Is there <br/>
anything wrong with it? IMO, no. Did my folks monitor it? They probably <br/>
thought they did, but they must not have been too vigilant. Did I hide it? <br/>
Yes, because I instinctively knew that my parents would have thought it was <br/>
wrong. Do I have a good healthy sexual relationship with my husband, are my <br/>
morals in the right place? Yes, and yes. Did my romance novels, trashy sex <br/>
filled books, and my one copy of Playgirl ruin me? Nope! Is Sandra&#39;s son <br/>
going to be ruined by some Anime that has nudity or his Cosmo stashed in his <br/>
bathroom? No. He is developing a good ideal of what a healthy sexual <br/>
relationship is from his parents.  A little cartoon girl with her naked, <br/>
exaggerated breasts exposed (Japanese Anime doesn&#39;t show the pubic region as <br/>
a cultural thing, and even if it did, I still don&#39;t thing it would be wrong. <br/>
And Darin just informed me that there are different levels of Anime called <br/>
Hentai and Magna.) and a half naked waif in Cosmo isn&#39;t going to damage him <br/>
or another kid. Unless that is, if someone shames him and holds his small <br/>
interest up as example of something nasty and bad. So if your 12 yo son is <br/>
watching Bedtime Stories on Cinemax Late Night I wouldn&#39;t throw a hissey. And <br/>
if he rents a graphic Anime I wouldn&#39;t worry. It isn&#39;t going to make him some <br/>
sexual deviant. Anymore than a girl reading a romance novel, with heaving <br/>
breasts and thrusting members swelling against the center of her womanhood, <br/>
is going to destroy her. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188750261">&lt;&lt;. It seems to come from some long time<br/>
members who have a tendency to jump on the newcomers who are honestly and<br/>
hopefully looking for support in their new found or difficult journey of<br/>
unschooling, whether it be recent or not&gt;&gt;<br/>
If a new nursing mom comes to La Leche League, who has been supplementing<br/>
with formula because she has been told she doesn&#39;t have enough breastmilk,<br/>
would the LLL leader praise her choice of bottlefeeding? Of course not, they<br/>
would help the Mom understand that breastfeeding without the use of<br/>
supplements was going to get them on the road to succesful breastfeeding<br/>
relationship. Faster and with less trouble. Same with this list.<br/>
That was an analogy. I found it helpful to say it that way.<br/>
&lt;&lt;Now I know this is just my opinion, but maybe some of you should slow down<br/>
and try to help instead of intimidating. Some of you are down right scary.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe those who come with questions should read for a while first. Or not<br/>
blast those who have attempted to answer in their own  style of writing, for<br/>
not using the reader&#39;s style of communication.<br/>
There are tons of places to get support on and off line. This email list is<br/>
a place to get a variety of help from a variety of people. For no cost. FREE<br/>
EDUCATIONAL ADVICE!! Wow, here in the DC area, you pay upwards of $300 an<br/>
hour for it!<br/>
When new to the listers start paying anything to the answerers of questions,<br/>
then they can start telling the people who are spending tons of time and<br/>
typing skills how to answer.<br/>
Maybe the people who are &quot;scary&quot; are telling you things that you need to<br/>
hear.<br/>
Those who are scary to one poster are caring, compassionate and experienced<br/>
to another poster.<br/>
