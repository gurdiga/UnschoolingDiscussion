<div id="ygrps-yiv-526793287">There was a small unschooling conference last year in Watertown, MA. (I <br/>
went, and also live in MA.) It was not as large as the GWS camp. I put a <br/>
question to the Mass. Home Learning Association&#39;s email list about whether <br/>
there would be a similar conference this year and one of last year&#39;s <br/>
planners responded that they are discussing it. Someone might want to check <br/>
to make sure there isn&#39;t something already in the works so as not to <br/>
duplicate locations, times, and so forth. If there isn&#39;t a conference <br/>
planned, then maybe that planner from last year can help provide resources <br/>
for others who want to pull together a N.E. camp or conference. Inquire on <br/>
the MHLA email list: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/masshomelearningassoc/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/masshomelearningassoc/</a> <br/>
It would be great to have such a conference or gathering in the area.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-298217322">Wasn&#39;t there someone that sort of volunteered to take the lead in a possible <br/>
NE conference.  If you wanted to check that out and get back to the group <br/>
about what you found that would be great.  I am always up for a NE <br/>
conference.  That is where all my family is.  (what family is left anyway).  <br/>
I would be willing to help as best I could from NC.<br/>
