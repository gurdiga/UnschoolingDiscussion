<div id="ygrps-yiv-373964629">Thank you all for the wealth of info on the conference. I <br/>
I have currently been within an environment in our church which has , in my opinion become very Child Unfriendly.  I am not surprised actually by the responses that I got about bringing children.  I know some of the other homeschooling conferences allow older children, or nursing babies. We are in the very busy stage of development (the always moving stage!) <br/>
<br/>
When I first began my homeschool journey I was given lots of magazines ( the teaching Home) with the lovely family on the front and all the girls are dressed alike, or they are sitting very nicely dressed at the kitchen table while Mom puts away the dishes, smiling. Made me crazy!  My family was certainly NOT this way - nor did I want it to be. It has been very refreshing to see a group which is down to earth, and real. <br/>
<br/>
In any case, I did a lot of reading about Waldorf, Charlotte Mason and eventually found &quot;How children Learn&quot; by John Holt at a library sale.  <br/>
<br/>
I have since grown a lot in my feeling about children and acceptable behavior. I have been since battling &quot;rules&quot; within our church ( which I grew up and have loved) and have often found there to be a separation of parents/children. Often children aren&#39;t welcome because they make too much noise, are rowdy(especially after LOTS of sugary snacks which are provided) and are just excited to be together. I find that wonderful about them.( Their excitement and zest  - not their reaction to sugary snacks ;-) Others are not so amused and find them interfering.<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading here for over a year. This year I have been unschooling - but sometimes I still stand on the fence - and get very nervous when I look at Math books I purchased that have gone unused. I can see my children learning, have had wonderful days with them - but still I doubt myself because I worry that my kids will grow up to be undisciplined adults that lack self-control, etc. From reading much of what you all speak about with your children, it appears just the opposite. I am really hoping to see this in person. Part of me wonders if it is just that you are just particularly good parents -)  I sometimes wish I was parented the way I see some of you coming across as parents to your children. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is scary for me! I think it puts MORE pressure on me than having a curriculum.( I never did have a packaged one - but did do unit studies and math)  One afternoon, my kids found frog eggs out in the stream - and I bet you can imagine what that turned into - a whole afternoon of looking up whether they were frog eggs or toad eggs - what they eat, etc. it was wonderful. Sometimes after about 5 minutes they decide they don&#39;t want to do whatever it is we started. It certainly keeps me on my toes!<br/>
<br/>
Well - sorry I have gone on so long. If all goes well, we may all take the ride - We are in CT. I have a couple of Free plane tickets I could use - and was thinking that would work for my husband and I , but don&#39;t know if I could scrape up the rest for 3 more plane tickets. However - it would be an adventure. We do travel to Maryland as I assist a Professor at University of Maryland  a couple times a year - but that is only 7 hrs. and we drive through the night. I hate long car rides - but I may have to suffer through it ;-) One of those car video things is sounding pretty good ;-) <br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all there!<br/>
<br/>
Heather<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can I add my thanks as well? :-p This is the biggest criticism I get from my family ... that my son is/will be undisciplined. But I notice that their kids, who are controlled in every tiny move of their lives, including going to the bathroom (Asking a 6yo do you have to go? NO! Yes you do! No I don&#39;t. YES you do -- go right now or you&#39;re in time out!), become wild and unruly as soon as they are free of their parents. My son&#39;s behavior is pretty much the same, whether I&#39;m supervising him or not -- energetic, certainly, but not wild. I see this as vindication! Proof that he is developing internal control.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all you vets who keep sharing your stories.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Those magazines and the pictures on the flyers for homeschool <br/>
curriculum, with books spread out all over the table, and a glass of <br/>
milk and plate of cookies...LOL <br/>
<br/>
But actually, this is something I thought of today. When we started, <br/>
I made up an extra room for &quot;the classroom&quot; with a very nifty <br/>
timeline on the wall, and a world map on the wall, and a desk for <br/>
each kid...and we &quot;did school&quot; in there about twice! We just <br/>
naturally gravitated to the kitchen table. Putting it off in a <br/>
separate room was SO foreign and unnatural, right from the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
So, extrapolating that observation across the spectrum of learning, <br/>
why should I think that they are going to learn something just <br/>
because I put them down in front of it and tell it to them? John Holt <br/>
was an amazing author, whose &quot;How Children Learn&quot; blew all my <br/>
theories out of the water. That, and researching the private school <br/>
in MA(???) &quot;Sudbury&quot; where kids follow their own inclinations every <br/>
day, with caring adults there to model all kinds of things. <br/>
<br/>
Sudbury, Holt, and Gatto, along with recollections of my own <br/>
learning, and observations of my kids, convince me that real learning <br/>
isn&#39;t something that can be forced. Yeah, they&#39;ll learn how to spit <br/>
out the right answers, and pass the tests, but they won&#39;t own the <br/>
knowledge, unless it&#39;s something they really dig. Making a kid who is <br/>
interested in chemistry, to read through Julius Caesar, when he <br/>
highly dislikes literature, just so he can display an official <br/>
diploma...nah. That&#39;s unnatural. Jumping through the hoops is for <br/>
trained animals, not human beings.<br/>

managed to get him on a chain before dark, but one Saturday night, I <br/>
got involved in something and when I looked up, it was already dark <br/>
and Wookie was already roaming, and he was not on the front porch the <br/>
next morning. Dead, up the road a piece. :(<br/>
<br/>
Most likely, if he were still with us, I&#39;d have been more than <br/>
willing for you to have him, though. He was a really beautiful dog. <br/>
And only two when he got hit. He&#39;d be four this year.<br/>

Why do you say &quot;unfortunately&quot;? <br/>

Wow, that did sound a bit harsh didn&#39;t it??? I meant unfortunate for the<br/>
dog. She just couldn&#39;t handle all the new kids and animals that came after<br/>
her. We knew that of course there could be a problem when we got her but we<br/>
had no idea we would be expanding like we did. It wasn&#39;t unfortunate for us<br/>
at all, just poor Miko.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122063949">I wondered if that weren&#39;t it. Wookie was most definitely the Boss <br/>
Dog, which put poor Critter five feet under, and I declare, he had a <br/>
stronger will than ME. L He really needed one strong person to be <br/>
with him all the time and put a lot of effort into his training. It&#39;s <br/>
sort of an &quot;unfortunate&quot; for Wookie, too.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, well. Something to add to my &quot;Everything I Ever Learned&quot; List: <br/>
research the breed before getting a dog.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-568993446">I wondered if that weren&#39;t it. Wookie was most definitely the Boss <br/>
Dog, which put poor Critter five feet under, and I declare, he had a <br/>
stronger will than ME. L He really needed one strong person to be <br/>
with him all the time and put a lot of effort into his training. It&#39;s <br/>
sort of an &quot;unfortunate&quot; for Wookie, too.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, well. Something to add to my &quot;Everything I Ever Learned&quot; List: <br/>
research the breed before getting a dog.<br/>
