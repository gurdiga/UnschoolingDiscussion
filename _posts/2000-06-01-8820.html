<div id="ygrps-yiv-444383911">&lt;&lt;Who is the author  and who is the publisher of these books please.<br/>
Could you tell me a bit more about them? My daughters are really into<br/>
horses these days but are strong readers (9 and 11) and like well-written<br/>
books.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 Walter Farley is the author--there is a whole series of these books--he<br/>
begn writing the 1st one when he was 17 yrs old. We have them in<br/>
paperback--published by Random House.<br/>
 My dd disagrees with some of what he says about horses, and how they are<br/>
trained, but theinks theyare a good read.<br/>
