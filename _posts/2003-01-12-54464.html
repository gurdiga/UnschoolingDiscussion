<br/>
Probably someone else will answer that, but you might find them by looking <br/>
for &quot;algorithms.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What I am going to share is some stuff my husband wrote in correspondence <br/>
with an unschooling mom a couple of years ago.  It&#39;s been posted before, but <br/>
it&#39;s easier for me to find it on my computer than in the archives.  This is <br/>
just his answers, not the questions. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And the reason I&#39;ve brought this up now is that he taught me (before we had <br/>
kids, when I was saying I only liked the word problems in math in school, not <br/>
the number problems) that the forumlas are not the questions, they are the <br/>
answers.  So if someone does show you a list of how to calculate various <br/>
things, that won&#39;t be the math.  That will be the product of someone else&#39;s <br/>
mathematical thinking.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to change school thinking enough to realize that &quot;teaching math&quot; is <br/>
to a large extent &quot;memorizing answers&quot; and not really helping anyone to think <br/>
mathematically.<br/>
<br/>
From  here down is my  husband Keith&#39;s writing:<br/>
-------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Math is a highly structured abstract modeling tool and requires a strong<br/>
<br/>
sense of discipline, but ...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A true math student must possess a strong passion for discovery in a realm<br/>
<br/>
which has little direct connection to the world of our five senses.  My<br/>
<br/>
experience says that the passion will grow in children if they are shown the<br/>
<br/>
myriad of modeling applications in their everyday world (physics, chemistry,<br/>
<br/>
finance, sports, arts, etc).  All growth takes time and gentle nurturing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about educating the parents as much as educating the<br/>
<br/>
children.<br/>

-------------- my response 11/5 -----------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the ages of your children (or yourself or your husband :) but<br/>
<br/>
it doesn&#39;t really matter.  Think of your everyday actions, then look at how<br/>
<br/>
they can be represented with math.  Scaling of cooking ingredients (ratios),<br/>
<br/>
boiling water (physics or chemistry), bouncing a ball (physics), watching<br/>
<br/>
the moon circle the earth (geometry), (as in why does a ball fall to earth<br/>
<br/>
but the moon does not?).  Find art with a protractor, compass, straight<br/>
<br/>
edge, (like the Greeks) or just play with graph paper (geometry & trig).<br/>
<br/>
Look for symetry in nature or man made artifacts (ratios again).  Look for<br/>
<br/>
applications of fractions (ratios, division, combinatorics).  Talk about the<br/>
<br/>
lottery or statistics in elections or sports.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Algebra and calculus are abstractions to be delved into once you see the<br/>
<br/>
need for modeling in the first place.  Interest in &quot;the need&quot; I find to be<br/>
<br/>
hinged on a budding interest in some tangible format.  Do they like<br/>
<br/>
architecture or engineering (mud pies to model planes)?  How about<br/>
<br/>
competitive puzzles (board games, cards, video games)?  My son (12) just<br/>
<br/>
finished reassembling a TV. (The picture was cutting out.)  He now knows<br/>
<br/>
that the insides are not some kind of magic.  We talked a little about<br/>
<br/>
circuits and assembly and troubleshooting.  In the process of finding the<br/>
<br/>
broken circuit, we talked about TV signals and waveforms and how both audio<br/>
<br/>
and video came from the same antenna.  I didn&#39;t try to go into the math of<br/>
<br/>
electronics (really complicated modeling), but he now is a little more<br/>
<br/>
interested in just how that stuff works.  It took him 3 days of putzing<br/>
<br/>
around with it, (and a $20 part) and mostly all I did was encourage him to<br/>
<br/>
be careful and take small steps.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think the greatest thing I have learned from homeschooling, it the fact<br/>
<br/>
that it is ok to say, &quot;I don&#39;t know, let&#39;s find out.&quot;  The other side of<br/>
<br/>
that is being able to judge when the child is bored with the subject and you<br/>
<br/>
can let it slide.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
<br/>
Keith<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Combinatorics:<br/>
<br/>
Consider a lottery drawing of 3 balls from 3 separate pots of 10 balls each.<br/>
<br/>
The odds of picking a specific combination of numbers is:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1/10 * 1/10 * 1/10 = 1/1000 or one in one thousand combinations.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now consider drawing the 3 balls from a single pot.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1/10 * 1/9 * 1/8 = 1/720 or one in seven hundred twenty combinations.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Combinatorics is the study of ratios.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Computer Programming:<br/>
<br/>
This is more like logic than math, but the same principals apply.  My<br/>
<br/>
recommendation would be to buy your son a simple programming environment<br/>
<br/>
(like Visual Basic or even better Microsoft Access) and a couple beginner<br/>
<br/>
books on programming.  Even so, it will require a rigorous effort because of<br/>
<br/>
how &#39;dry&#39; the materiel really is.  The artistry of programming is in<br/>
<br/>
conceptualizing just what it is you want to accomplish.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Glad you enjoyed this<br/>

about 35 bags.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm. I&#39;m not sure that a book of formulas would help. It&#39;s understanding the<br/>
problem that will lead you to the formula. (Though most almanacs have them.)<br/>
<br/>
Basically what you&#39;re asking is if you had one size box and wanted to<br/>
reshape it into a bunch of cube shaped boxes of a particular size, how many<br/>
cubes would you have?<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a number of approaches.<br/>
<br/>
You could visualize slicing every cube 3 times so each is 3 flat boxes<br/>
stacked on top of each other. And then visualize (or draw it on graph paper)<br/>
how many of those slices would fit into the play area.<br/>
<br/>
Since the slices from the cubes and the play area are both 1 foot deep you<br/>
can ignore that you&#39;re dealing with 3 dimensions.<br/>
<br/>
So how many 3 foot squares fits across the 25 foot side? To make it easier<br/>
so you don&#39;t have to deal with fractions you can deal with &quot;close enough&quot;<br/>
and say more than 8, less than 9. And how many across the 40 foot side? More<br/>
than 13, less than 14.<br/>
<br/>
8x13 is 104 and 9x14 is 126.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s too broad a range, so I&#39;d go back and fill in the real numbers and<br/>
use 8 1/3 x 13 2/3 = 113.8888 so call it 114. The trick is you need to<br/>
remember you used *slices* not whole cubes. So there&#39;s 3 slices per cube<br/>
whic means you need to divide 114 by 3 which is 38.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could you could figure out the volume in cubic feet of the play area<br/>
and then keep subtracting 1 cubic yard&#39;s worth (3&#39;x3&#39;x3&#39; is 27 cubic feet)<br/>
until you don&#39;t have any left. (That&#39;s also known as division ;-)<br/>
<br/>
24&#39;x40&#39;x1&#39;=1000 cubic feet<br/>
<br/>
1000/27 is 38.<br/>

not just coming up with a sum, but in fact the method used to achieve<br/>
that sum? Don&#39;t you need a starting point from which to base your<br/>
equation on? For instance, using my mulch problem, in my mind&#39;s eye I can<br/>
visualize the play area broke up into little cubes, let&#39;s say 1&#39; square.<br/>
But short of counting out each of the cubes one by one, and then dividing<br/>
this number by 3 to come up with the cubic yard measurement (if that is<br/>
even correct), I have a mental block as to how to finish the equation. I<br/>
tend to have the same problem figuring out volumes, masses, etc., but can<br/>
easily remember formulas once I&#39;ve applied them. I feel like knowing your<br/>
strengths and weaknesses, and overcoming or using them to complete the<br/>
task at hand would be very much unschooling. Am I wrong in this<br/>
assumption? Or am I totally off base in what you were describing? How<br/>
does one think more mathematically in an unschooling way? I&#39;m going to go<br/>
back and reread your husband&#39;s suggestions, maybe the answers will be<br/>
more clear now. Maybe I&#39;m just looking for the easy way out and not<br/>
exercising my mathematical muscles. I, too, have always been better with<br/>
words.<br/>

&gt; There&#39;s a number of approaches.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You could visualize slicing every cube 3 times so each is 3 flat <br/>
&gt; boxes<br/>
&gt; stacked on top of each other. And then visualize (or draw it on <br/>
&gt; graph paper)<br/>
&gt; how many of those slices would fit into the play area.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since the slices from the cubes and the play area are both 1 foot <br/>
&gt; deep you<br/>
&gt; can ignore that you&#39;re dealing with 3 dimensions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So how many 3 foot squares fits across the 25 foot side? To make it <br/>
&gt; easier<br/>
&gt; so you don&#39;t have to deal with fractions you can deal with &quot;close <br/>
&gt; enough&quot;<br/>
&gt; and say more than 8, less than 9. And how many across the 40 foot <br/>
&gt; side? More<br/>
&gt; than 13, less than 14.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 8x13 is 104 and 9x14 is 126.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s too broad a range, so I&#39;d go back and fill in the real <br/>
&gt; numbers and<br/>
&gt; use 8 1/3 x 13 2/3 = 113.8888 so call it 114. The trick is you need <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; remember you used *slices* not whole cubes. So there&#39;s 3 slices per <br/>
&gt; cube<br/>
&gt; whic means you need to divide 114 by 3 which is 38.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or you could you could figure out the volume in cubic feet of the <br/>
&gt; play area<br/>
&gt; and then keep subtracting 1 cubic yard&#39;s worth (3&#39;x3&#39;x3&#39; is 27 cubic <br/>
&gt; feet)<br/>
&gt; until you don&#39;t have any left. (That&#39;s also known as division ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 24&#39;x40&#39;x1&#39;=1000 cubic feet<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1000/27 is 38.<br/>

I don&#39;t like to have to depend on other people to know things for me. I<br/>
think you can get taken advantage of a lot in life if you count on others<br/>
for those things. It would be very hard for an auto repair shop to take<br/>
advantage of me, because I can pretty much identify any part or the<br/>
function of the part on my car. I could do most of the repairs myself, if<br/>
so inclined and the right tools were available to me. I rarely ever have<br/>
to, because my husband takes care of that stuff. But, if I brake down on<br/>
the side of the road I will not be helpless. I try to educate myself<br/>
about all things, some of which I may never use. I taught myself how to<br/>
give CPR. Hopefully I&#39;ll never have to use that info, but if needed I<br/>
can. When I was in school, and didn&#39;t see any practical use for math, I<br/>
just did the work, got good grades, and quickly forgot any of the<br/>
information. I just want to relearn the basic principles for times like<br/>
now when I need to figure out how much mulch to buy.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m not sure that I understand you. Are you saying that learning math is<br/>
not just coming up with a sum, but in fact the method used to achieve<br/>
that sum? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Don&#39;t you need a starting point from which to base your<br/>
equation on? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of course.  But that starting point will be in a non-numerical context.  <br/>
Language, or spatial situation, or music, or art.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For instance, using my mulch problem, in my mind&#39;s eye I can<br/>
visualize the play area broke up into little cubes, let&#39;s say 1&#39; square.<br/>
But short of counting out each of the cubes one by one, and then dividing<br/>
this number by 3 to come up with the cubic yard measurement (if that is<br/>
even correct), I have a mental block as to how to finish the equation.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You have a mental block because someone made you think that unless you could <br/>
memorize a formula you MIGHT need in twenty years, that it was none of your <br/>
business and too hard for you.  They didn&#39;t teach you how to create the <br/>
formula.  They showed you the formula and taught you how to plug other <br/>
numbers in and &quot;solve&quot; it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I tend to have the same problem figuring out volumes, masses, etc., but can<br/>
easily remember formulas once I&#39;ve applied them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s no crime to build on what others have discovered.  But it&#39;s not <br/>
artistry, it&#39;s clerk&#39;s work.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I feel like knowing your strengths and weaknesses, and overcoming or using <br/>
them to complete the task at hand would be very much unschooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for people to even think about math without it becoming bound up in <br/>
personal worth and emotion, (NO) thanks to school.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of worrying about overcoming, knowing or using strengths and <br/>
weaknesses, how about just encourage childs are?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How does one think more mathematically in an unschooling way?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By thinking less about numbers and more about patterns.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe I&#39;m just looking for the easy way out and not exercising my mat<br/>
hematical muscles. I, too, have always been better with words.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then go on strike from numbers for a while and see how that goes!<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;formal&quot; juncture (school-style) of math and words is logic.<br/>
But I don&#39;t even mean think in and of logic.  Just think in words, even about <br/>
cubic yards of stuff.  Don&#39;t fish around in your head for something that <br/>
looks like page 113 of an 8th grade geometry book.  Keep that out of your <br/>
thinking until you can see math another way.<br/>
<br/>
This is an odd case of &quot;start where you&#39;re not.&quot;<br/>
If you start where you are, you&#39;ll be blocked.<br/>

then it won&#39;t happen again! &lt;easy study&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s better for me to focus on what I do well and rely on those who <br/>
do what I can&#39;t/won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
CPR&#39;s a cool thing to know, no matter what. And hopefully you&#39;ll never need <br/>
to use it.<br/>
<br/>
I also know how to slit my wrists succesfully, but I don&#39;t WANT to use that! &lt;<br/>

I LOVE to learn new things. Happens every day. But calculating area is <br/>
totally unappealing. There are folks who love it. I&#39;m quite happy to please <br/>
them and let them show off! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

arrogance in marketing. I&#39;m in a rural area, where there aren&#39;t all that<br/>
many businesses to choose from: ie: one grocery store, one lumber yard,<br/>
one coal supplier, etc. If you are not happy with service, and tell them<br/>
so, they pretty much tell you that that is the way it is, and to go<br/>
somewhere else if you are not happy (knowing full well that there isn&#39;t<br/>
any other place to go) They are VERY independent here. Therefor, I like<br/>
all business transactions to be straight, and final, at least to the best<br/>
of my ability.<br/>
 I was really only using the mulch thing in my original post as an<br/>
example of the kinds of formulas I was searching for. But, as it has been<br/>
shown to me in various posts, formulas are not the best way to come up<br/>
with end results. Which just reminded me of another story, somewhat off<br/>
topic.<br/>
I have a good friend who broke away from the Amish community about six<br/>
years ago. She is the best darn cook I have ever seen, and I asked her to<br/>
share some of her recipes with me. She looked at me blankly, and  finally<br/>
said that she never used recipes, like that was a given. She said you<br/>
just put stuff together till it tastes good. I guess that is a little<br/>
like unschooling math. It is more about the end result than how you<br/>
actually get there. (I think)<br/>

it. And then build the problem up a bit to put your theory to the test<br/>
before committing it for real.<br/>
<br/>
How would you handle a play yard that was 3&#39;x3&#39;? It&#39;s a good place to start<br/>
but it turns out too simple to tell us much. What at 4&#39;x4&#39;? 6&#39;x6&#39;? And so on<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792295135">I find it very interesting that so many adults who went to school, <br/>
college etc. took lots and lots of math classes and still hate/ don&#39;t <br/>
understand or get headaches from math!!! The point is, do we really <br/>
actually learn anything from formal math classes? Maybe those of us <br/>
who did learn math did so in spite of the teachers and <br/>
textbooks...hmm... I was in AP math all through high school, I kept <br/>
telling the guidance counselor that I was going to art school, no <br/>
math was required and they only offered math classes as an elective <br/>
but I tested well so she pressured me to keep taking math at higher <br/>
levels. I never brought the book home, I only did homework at school <br/>
and only then when I was in the math mood. I never studied for a test <br/>
or made any effort to memorize a formula. It was fun but I thought I <br/>
was just wasting my time. Then a couple of years ago my son had an <br/>
algebra book and I picked it up and realized just how much of the <br/>
thinking patterns I learned from higher math I actually do use in <br/>
everyday, non-math situations. It was eye opening!<br/>
    The point in relation to this conversation is; If people who take <br/>
formal math classes don&#39;t necessarily learn math and people who learn <br/>
math don&#39;t necessarily take formal math classes, it would then follow <br/>
that the two have very little to do with one another!!! Hmm...I think <br/>
that is some corrupted form of mathematical reasoning...isn&#39;t it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-441589571">Then a couple of years ago my son had an <br/>
algebra book and I picked it up and realized just how much of the <br/>
thinking patterns I learned from higher math I actually do use in <br/>
everyday, non-math situations. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I would love to hear some examples.  I know someone did list a few.<br/>
<br/>
I know I use the process of doing proofs for geometry ALL the time.  I guess its related to breaking big things into smaller ones, or being able to relate to things logically (though I don&#39;t do as well with logic).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering about Trig and Calculus though.  I didn&#39;t do well in Algebra 2, Trig, and never took Calculus.<br/>
<br/>
I watched that movie October Sky (I think thats what it was called) and understood how calculus factored in, but I&#39;d love to hear more example that maybe I&#39;m missing in every day life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Was talking to a friend about this very subject today, and she suggested that <br/>
there is a huge difference between the theory of mathematics and the <br/>
application of that theory.  Classes teach theory, not application.  <br/>
Unschooling teaches real-life application, but it is nearly impossible to <br/>
extrapolate theory from that.  She suggested that trying to label real-life <br/>
application with a label such as *geometry* is irrelevant.  Why not just <br/>
enjoy laying out your garden?<br/>
