hi sam,<br/>
<br/>
this is my first list to join, and i hope i am not too funny about all my <br/>
typing quirks.  i heard somewhere that no caps (all lowercase) bothers some <br/>
people: that and my abbrev&#39;s are really just to help me go faster!  with a <br/>
loop i am finding there is much mail to face!  plus, often i have a nursing <br/>
squirming toddler half on- half off my lap, so i need all the help i can get! <br/>
 :) <br/>
<br/>
i am just learning these other &quot;sanctioned&quot; abbreviations (ds,dd, imho, <br/>
roflol, etc!)<br/>
<br/>
i am enjoying the list so far (about a wk) but am wondering about the amount <br/>
of mail and if i will feel burdened by it and quit...  do you find you get <br/>
off the list for awhile then come back occasionally?  or how do people manage <br/>
your email? <br/>
<br/>
thanks for the note, :)<br/>

I keep getting up earlier to read it .... and, of course, learning to type <br/>
faster!!! LOL!!!  If you uns*b, and then come back, you can be really lost if <br/>
a thread has started while you were gone....also, you miss hearing from <br/>
everyone.....it seems like I always come away with a new idea!<br/>

out on some things.  Otherwise, like having too many newspapers in a pile<br/>
because there may be a few  gems to read among them, sometimes I have to<br/>
just have a big no-regrets &quot;toss-out&quot; to clear my E-mail box and start<br/>
fresh.<br/>
