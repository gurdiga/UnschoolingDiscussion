 </span></blockquote>Just last week everyone was wondering where everyone on this list was. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t until Oom brought up spanking that this list started &quot;hopping&quot; again. <br/>
<br/>
So perhaps her posts reminded some why they are here, perhaps not. As for the <br/>
splintered groups, just because they have had a slow start does not mean they <br/>
will never take off. Then again maybe they won&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
But Jeva is not off when she states that people are in fact afraid of posting <br/>
for the reasons she describes. Just because people do not wish to be lit up <br/>
in flames does not mean they want a list that coddles parents or &quot;holds their <br/>
hands&quot; and &quot;affirms&quot; their choices. That is quite a jump from listening to each <br/>
other to berading each other. <br/>
<br/>
I personally do not agree with Oom&#39;s posts (who, by the way is Chris, since <br/>
someone wanted her name and she doesn&#39;t sign with it, she did in fact, <br/>
introduce herself as Chris when she joined the list and also stated that although she <br/>
did not yet consider herself a full blown unschooler, she came here to learn <br/>
and get ideas and decide whether it would be a lifestyle condusive to her <br/>
family.) However, even when I disagree with her posts, or find them offensive, I do <br/>
not think by being offensive back she, nor anyone else will gain anything for <br/>
shouting back in e-speak. I see that as the same as: while we don&#39;t spank <br/>
here, but it is perfectly okay to yell and have adult tantrums when people don&#39;t <br/>
&quot;get it&quot;. Then when the original offending poster, then defends themselves and <br/>
their belief system, they shut down to hearing what helpful things people <br/>
here are trying to convey, they get stuck in defending themselves, instead of <br/>
thinking there may be another way. It&#39;s very much the same things as we don&#39;t <br/>
spank, but we sure do let you know we don&#39;t think these posters are &quot;worthy&quot; of <br/>
our expertise. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry Jeva, but this road has been travelled many times. Don&#39;t expect too <br/>
many to take the road less travelled. Just as some adults think its easier to <br/>
just spank a kid, many adults here find it just as easy to flame each other. It <br/>
is frustrating and irritating, but for me not enough to discount what I may <br/>
learn about how others do things. I have just gotten to a point where I roll my <br/>
eyes and laugh and seriously contemplate whether of not it&#39;s even worth my <br/>
energy to post a response. Obviously this time it was. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree, unfortunately not all posts come through that way. But I do wonder <br/>
what the person being told their writing is not seen as helpful is expected to <br/>
do. Maybe they are just expected to admit they are wrong or never thought of <br/>
another way, it just seems like without one of those responses, it does get <br/>
heated here. Maybe it is just because frustration happens whichever side of a <br/>
debate one may be on and then the &quot;lessons&quot; get lost. <br/>
<br/>
As for my last post, I mean it when I say I am not looking to feel superior. <br/>
It felt funny to read such a thing, when I am the hating rank person. (Not <br/>
that I want to travel that road again, but considering I don&#39;t like rank, to be <br/>
told I must be wanting to feel superior, that was exactly the kind of statement <br/>
I said makes me roll my eyes and laugh. Not because I am mocking anyone, but <br/>
that it is so far from being true, that I wonder why so many words are taken <br/>
apart and turned into something they are not.) I do wonder what was meant by <br/>
that statement. Perhaps it is my writing style, perhaps I said something that <br/>
sounded as though I thought of myself that way, but I can assure you all that is <br/>
not the case. <br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who doesn&#39;t happen to look at anyone here as &quot;Superior&quot; or <br/>
&quot;Inferior&quot;. Even the thought of those words scream &quot;SCHOOL&quot; to me. Superior = teachers, <br/>
Inferior = Children =Yuck<br/>

pretty sure we&#39;d all agree on what we&#39;d see if a parent smacked a kid.<br/>
<br/>
Or - maybe I&#39;m wrong. There are subtle ways of hurting children that <br/>
are taught be people like Dobson - put your arm around your kid and <br/>
give him a big pinch right between the neck and shoulder - it&#39;ll hurt <br/>
like crazy but other people won&#39;t be able to tell what you&#39;re doing. <br/>
That is suggested for use in public places. Wouldn&#39;t probably be <br/>
embraced by anybody who likes the applause from a crowd for hurting <br/>
their child, though.<br/>

than her intro until she jumped in to defend that &quot;drug&quot; post and insist<br/>
that there will always be times when kids have to be made to do things, and<br/>
that she &quot;had to&quot; spank her son in order to make him not run away from her<br/>
on the street.  When people *politely* disagreed with her, she kept at it,<br/>
adding some pretty offensive stuff about the way she thinks about her kids.<br/>
After a while, some people got fed up with her antics.  Basically that&#39;s the<br/>
way it always happens.  It&#39;s the old, &quot;don&#39;t go to a vegetarian list and<br/>
talk about how important it is to eat meat without expecting people to call<br/>
you on it.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please elaborate Betsy. I too went back to my post and don&#39;t seem to see <br/>
where I sounded superior or now hypocritical as you&#39;ve said above. I did not push <br/>
the conversation into debate about personal style. Jeva questioned why the <br/>
discussions turn to arguments and why things are delivered in ways we wouldn&#39;t <br/>
treat our children. I was making a point to Jeva, that these same stagnant <br/>
debates happen regularly here and sometimes it just isn&#39;t worth getting worked up <br/>
about. I was also qualifying what she said because many people do post <br/>
privately when their voices are not heard or they fear coming out of lurkdom to post. <br/>
For me, I have learned to seriously reflect as to how much energy I want to <br/>
use where all e-lists are concerned. Sometimes when I sit back and wait a while <br/>
I see people clarify themselves and then I am glad I didn&#39;t jump the gun. <br/>
There are times no one posts any arguments and we all just get along and discuss <br/>
things rather than argue. Then there are times like these where neither party <br/>
is hearing the other. I&#39;m not defending Chris (Oom) nor am I offending her. My <br/>
point was simply that it makes me sad that the ways to be better get lost <br/>
while people try to one up each other. So again I&#39;m not sure what is either <br/>
&quot;Superior&quot; or &quot;Hypocritical&quot;. Maybe I am a superior hypocrite.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lots of times, a discussion starts out because of something someone <br/>
says. An example is the spanking/punishment discussion that was sparked <br/>
by Chris&#39;s description of spanking her son and a crowd of people <br/>
cheering. But, the discussion isn&#39;t limited to that - so even though <br/>
that person has stopped listening or wanting to continue, the <br/>
discussion may go on for quite a while - and is no longer a discussion <br/>
intended to respond to or answer that person, but is a larger <br/>
discussion about the ideas that it generated.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, though, the person won&#39;t let go and keeps the focus on <br/>
themselves. They take everything personally, not grasping that the <br/>
discussion is moving on to the bigger issues and not directed to that <br/>
one specific issue anymore (although possibly using that as an example <br/>
from which to launch new discussion). My comments here, for example, <br/>
were not directed at all to trying to change Chris&#39;s mind - her mind is <br/>
not open to being changed. So the fact that she was &quot;done&quot; isn&#39;t <br/>
relevant. If she&#39;d let go and not respond defensively, she&#39;d have been <br/>
left out of the conversation fairly quickly. But she just kept on <br/>
insisting and insisting that spanking her son was a good thing - and <br/>
was rapidly backpedaling about what had really happened.<br/>
<br/>
She obviously felt that the conversation was going to continue being <br/>
about her  but having seen this a million times, I&#39;m certain that, in <br/>
fact, the conversation would stop being &quot;about her&quot; when SHE stopped <br/>
making it about her by posting new justifications and explanations and <br/>
descriptions of what happened.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If a musician in an ensemble without a director is tapping his foot or <br/>
wagging his knee, he might be told it&#39;s not helpful, that it&#39;s distracting, and so <br/>
he&#39;ll try to be still.<br/>
<br/>
If someone playing a sport is told that knocking someone on his own team out <br/>
of the way to get the ball isn&#39;t helpful, they usually just try to hang back <br/>
half a second or only go for balls the other person is definitely going to <br/>
miss.<br/>
<br/>
If someone who is driving tells a passenger that their advice isn&#39;t being <br/>
helpful, the passenger might be quiet except in real emergencies.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m in a discussion and someone has to tell me my input isn&#39;t helping, I <br/>
shush and just listen, or go off somewhere and wait for them to be through.   <br/>
I&#39;ve rarely been told that, maybe because I tend to stay out of conversations <br/>
when I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re about or what would help, and because I can tell <br/>
by others&#39; reactions when something is grating or irritating to them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-But I do wonder <br/>
what the person being told their writing is not seen as helpful is expected <br/>
to <br/>
do. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Expected&quot; is a loaded word.<br/>
<br/>
Some things that might be more helpful would be to soften, back up and NOT <br/>
repeat the non-helpful information over and over, or not to write for a while.  <br/>
With some people just letting things sit a bit, or proofreading really well <br/>
could help.<br/>

There&#39;s SUCH a range of behavior and response, though, that the way I talked <br/>
to Holly about where babies come from is not how I would deal with a drunk who <br/>
wandered into my back yard and started yelling at my dog.<br/>
