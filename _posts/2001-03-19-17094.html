<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060985027">Hi my name is Tina,<br/>
<br/>
I homeschool my 11 year old son in Utah.  We recently began a project <br/>
that I would like to share with you.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooler&#39;s World Quilt<br/>
<br/>
To be a part of the project each family or group creates a quilt <br/>
packet that tells about where they are from. The quilt packet consist <br/>
of a quilt square, brochure and a postcard. Exchange your quilt <br/>
packets with other members to create your own unique quilt of <br/>
culture. To become part of the project sign up on the yahoo-groups <br/>
page and exchange your quilt packets with  other families and groups <br/>
from around the world.  Currently there are 50 families involved, <br/>
including England, Saudi Arabia,Sweden, New Zealand and Australia.... <br/>
come join us on this fun exchange of culture.<br/>
<br/>
See pictures of some of the squares created by participating families-<br/>
