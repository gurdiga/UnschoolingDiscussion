&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes, I am bothered by sassy behavior whether it is towards me or anyone<br/>
&gt;else. I will not tolerate being spoken to in a disrestectful manner by my<br/>
&gt;children. I think that the natural consequence of this behavior is me<br/>
&gt;getting really p****d off. If, then, I do not want to spend the money I have<br/>
&gt;worked extremely hard for to take the rude child to the new Pokemon movie,<br/>
&gt;but to instead spend it on myself, or stay home and relax in front of a<br/>
&gt;movie I want to see instead of having the Nintendo on, that is a very<br/>
&gt;natural and direct consequence. If I am treated with love and respect for my<br/>
&gt;feelings, then I will return it by sharing my money and giving up my time at<br/>
&gt;home to run people all over town. If my children do not appreciate all I do<br/>
&gt;for them, then I won&#39;t do it. What could be a more natural consequence?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135796246">I learned something from you today, Eiraul!  Some excellent<br/>
advice/ideas!<br/>
<br/>
I was going to add a little something for Annette myself...My daughter<br/>
just turned 8 years of age 2 weeks ago.  Believe me, almost every day of<br/>
this past (her 7th) year was a battle.  There has been some great advice<br/>
shared and many intelligent points have been made worthy of<br/>
consideration, but perhaps some of this challenge could literally be<br/>
attributed to &quot;an age thing&quot; or a &quot;phase&quot;.  &quot;Terrible Twos&quot;, &quot;Fiercesome<br/>
Fours&quot;, &quot;Savage Sevens&quot;???  Not to trivialize the issue of unruly<br/>
children but perhaps a &quot;savage seven&quot; year old does not neccessarily<br/>
become a sociopath.  My daughter has already shown MAJOR improvement in<br/>
recent weeks!  <br/>

&gt; &gt; I feel hurt and abused. I feel like a terrible mom. I don&#39;t know whether to<br/>
&gt; &gt;  get strict with them or just back off, but I have had some pretty drastic<br/>
&gt; &gt;  thoughts.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Repeat after me:  I am the mom, I am the mom, I am the mom.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; {{{{{HUGS}}}}}}<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, the trick is to REMEMBER that...you are the mom.  That means you are an<br/>
&gt; adult, by definition, at least.  &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I took a parenting class way back when my kid was about that age (almost 15<br/>
&gt; years ago!).  The most profound thing I heard in the whole 6 or 8 week class<br/>
&gt; was a mom talking about how frustrated she would get with her 5 yr old when<br/>
&gt; he would totally refuse to be cooperative and was generally rude and<br/>
&gt; obnoxious and here she was trying her darnedest to be nice to the kid, (say<br/>
&gt; nothing of avoiding a felonious act, ie murder!).  Anyway, she said she<br/>
&gt; finally figured it out:  if she (or DH) reacted to the child in like manner<br/>
&gt; (yelling, being mad, etc.) there were suddenly twice as many 5 yr olds in the<br/>
&gt; house!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, &#39;I&#39;m the mom&#39; means don&#39;t react like a 5/7/3 yr old, no matter how<br/>
&gt; tempting it may be.  Stick to your guns as nicely as possible, but don&#39;t be a<br/>
&gt; doormat.  (nothing new here, huh?  You already know all this, don&#39;t you?  We<br/>
&gt; all do and we all get frustrated in the heat of the battle.  Don&#39;t let it<br/>
&gt; throw you.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The second most important thing I learned from that parenting class is that<br/>
&gt; sooner or later your child is going to want something from you.  If he/she<br/>
&gt; learns that they are NOT going to get what they want by being rude or<br/>
&gt; breaking the rules, you will eventually have a bargaining chip.  Sometimes<br/>
&gt; you really have to wait and watch to find something that works.  In this case<br/>
&gt; an example might be to refuse to get food while the child is demanding it.<br/>
&gt; (if that leaves you feeling guilty, have something available he can get for<br/>
&gt; himself...a cup of yogurt, slices of cheese, grapes, etc...and calmly say the<br/>
&gt; &lt;fill in the blanks&gt; are in the fridge, help yourself).  Won&#39;t take long and<br/>
&gt; he&#39;ll get the idea.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can&#39;t tackle every issue at the same time, though.  Pick your battles if you<br/>
&gt; can.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Having given this very sage advice (LOL...it&#39;s really too bad you can&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; my own family to know how totally ridiculous it is for me to claim wisdom!),<br/>
&gt; first take a gut level assessment of things at home/in your life and kidlet&#39;s<br/>
&gt; lives.  Is there any turmoil going on?  Anyone teething?  Schedule off?  Mom<br/>
&gt; or dad busier than usual?  Missing out on bedtime stories/prayers/bath or<br/>
&gt; other rituals?  Getting enough sleep?  Enough down time?  Take the kids to<br/>
&gt; the park lately?  Played Legos?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that most of the time when kids are acting up suddenly, it is either<br/>
&gt; a growing stage where they are trying to find their place in the world or<br/>
&gt; there is something out of place in their lives.  My experience is that it can<br/>
&gt; often be something that seems to be nothing out of the ordinary to the<br/>
&gt; adults.  But, think about it, we have so much more life experience.  We know<br/>
&gt; from our own experience that teething, for instance, really doesn&#39;t go on<br/>
&gt; forever...the sore mouth will go away.  But little people just don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; that frame of reference to yet.  They can&#39;t think past the moment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Having said all this...the best advice I&#39;ve seen yet was the one about the<br/>
&gt; bubble bath!  Make sure you get some time to be an adult.  A chance to have<br/>
&gt; conversations with other adults about adult things might be nice.  How long<br/>
&gt; since you and DH have been on a date?  (making an assumption here that you<br/>
&gt; are married, based on age of kids)  When was the last time you went to a<br/>
&gt; grown up movie?  (pokemon does NOT count!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;ll pass.  Good luck.  I agree with the post that you are a good mom and it<br/>
&gt; is apparent because you care enough to seek solutions.   I&#39;m confident you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; keep looking until you find something that fits.  Sometimes that&#39;s the most<br/>
&gt; important skill...tenacity to hang tough and find answers or wait out the<br/>
&gt; storm.  (of course, as soon as you figure out how to play the game, the kids<br/>
&gt; will change the rules and you get to start all over again!  bg)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275838992">HELP!<br/>
<br/>
My 7yo boy is rude and sassy all day long. When I ask him a question, he <br/>
answers with, &quot;Duh!&quot; If I ask him to do something, he asks why, and when I <br/>
explain, he argues with me. He pesters constantly to have friends over or to <br/>
watch more TV. If I say no, he slams out of the room, pouts, yells, calls me <br/>
mean, etc. When he wants a snack, he yells, &quot;MOM! I&#39;m HUNGRT! Get me <br/>
something to eat!&quot; And when I object ot that he just doesn&#39;t answer or yells <br/>
again. Sometimes I&#39;ll lightly rephrase his demand: &quot;Mom, can I have <br/>
something to eat please?&quot; He ignores me. When I scold or admonish, he tells <br/>
me to leave him alone or get out of his room. He is a total brat, in other <br/>
words. Nothing seems to help.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, my 3yo boy starts the day by calling me a &quot;dumb butt,&quot; and <br/>
screams at me when I refuse him anything. He asks for food, then throws it <br/>
down or ignores it, then screams at me when I dispose of it!<br/>
<br/>
On top of it all, the two of them bicker, fight, whine and chase each other <br/>
around all day. It&#39;s better when we&#39;re out, or if they&#39;re settled in front <br/>
of the TV, but we can&#39;t do either all day. There are lots of times when <br/>
we&#39;re just home.<br/>
<br/>
I feel hurt and abused. I feel like a terrible mom. I don&#39;t know whether to <br/>
get strict with them or just back off, but I have had some pretty drastic <br/>
thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions or thoughts would be appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199212332">Annette, a big hug and a round of sympathy for you!!!  I know it&#39;s <br/>
hard to live with when it seems like nothing you say or do makes a <br/>
difference to how they are.  You&#39;re not a terrible mom, though.  <br/>
Know how I know?  because you know that there&#39;s a problem <br/>
here and you&#39;ve asked for help to fix it.  You care.<br/>
<br/>
I like the ideas in Faber and Mazlish&#39;s book &#39;siblings without <br/>
rivalry,&#39; and for training anyone (including oneself) &#39;Don&#39;t shhot <br/>
the dog by Karen Pryor is great.  Above all, know that there are <br/>
things you can do, and that the fact that you&#39;re asking questions <br/>
adn trying to sort out this situation so you can all live, means that <br/>
you&#39;re a great mother, because you care.<br/>
<br/>
I can go on at length, but my kids have their on-and-off days, so I <br/>
don&#39;t want to preach &lt;g&gt;  Always here if you need an ear (or pair <br/>
of eyes...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-355326493">any number of days at my house could be described as you have described<br/>
yours.  However, my kids aren&#39;t like this when they are in the company of<br/>

(toward adults, and sometimes other kids;)  ).  So I figure I&#39;m successful<br/>
in teaching them to be respectful and can take some sass at home.  I&#39;m<br/>
assuming they will grow out of it if I continue to do my best to model<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407016037">Hi Annette,<br/>
<br/>
If a child yelled at me &quot;MOM, I&#39;m hungry!  Get me something to <br/>
eat&quot;, he&#39;d be hungrier still before he got a thing.   Don&#39;t accept that <br/>
behaviour, it only makes you miserable and makes them brattier <br/>
every day.  I feel that a child doesn&#39;t just start doing these things <br/>
without learning it from somewhere, whether it is from television, <br/>
their Father, a friend, or relative, it had to have come from <br/>
somewhere.  By accepting it you are enforcing their bad behaviour <br/>
and turning them into the type of man that no woman should ever <br/>
have to suffer.  The way a boy treats his Mother is reflected years <br/>
later in his treatment of his wife and probably his children too.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t allow them to speak to you like you were their servant, you <br/>
are their Mother and deserve to be treated respectfully.   Stop this <br/>
behaviour while they are still young enough to be stopped, if you <br/>
think it&#39;s bad to have a 3yr old and a 7yr old verbally abusing you, <br/>
just wait until they are 13 and 17 and more than likely bigger and <br/>
stronger than you.<br/>
<br/>
These are the men of tomorrow that you are raising, make them <br/>
men to be proud of.<br/>

&gt;My 7yo boy is rude and sassy all day long. When I ask him a question, he<br/>
&gt;answers with, &quot;Duh!&quot; If I ask him to do something, he asks why, and when I<br/>
&gt;explain, he argues with me. He pesters constantly to have friends over or <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;watch more TV. If I say no, he slams out of the room, pouts, yells, calls <br/>
&gt;me<br/>
&gt;mean, etc. When he wants a snack, he yells, &quot;MOM! I&#39;m HUNGRT! Get me<br/>
&gt;something to eat!&quot; And when I object ot that he just doesn&#39;t answer or <br/>
&gt;yells<br/>
&gt;again. Sometimes I&#39;ll lightly rephrase his demand: &quot;Mom, can I have<br/>
&gt;something to eat please?&quot; He ignores me. When I scold or admonish, he tells<br/>
&gt;me to leave him alone or get out of his room. He is a total brat, in other<br/>
&gt;words. Nothing seems to help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Meanwhile, my 3yo boy starts the day by calling me a &quot;dumb butt,&quot; and<br/>
&gt;screams at me when I refuse him anything. He asks for food, then throws it<br/>
&gt;down or ignores it, then screams at me when I dispose of it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On top of it all, the two of them bicker, fight, whine and chase each other<br/>
&gt;around all day. It&#39;s better when we&#39;re out, or if they&#39;re settled in front<br/>
&gt;of the TV, but we can&#39;t do either all day. There are lots of times when<br/>
&gt;we&#39;re just home.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I feel hurt and abused. I feel like a terrible mom. I don&#39;t know whether to<br/>
&gt;get strict with them or just back off, but I have had some pretty drastic<br/>
&gt;thoughts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any suggestions or thoughts would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642463983">Hi Annette! :-)<br/>
<br/>
2 of my kids are the same age as yours, and I also had problems with my 7<br/>
year old being rude, and my 3 year old copying him.  I swear, my 7 year old<br/>
seemed to skip from the hyper active toddler behavior at about 4 1/2 to 5<br/>
right into his teen age years. Grrr!! :-)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s much better now, and my 3 year old no longer models his big brother&#39;s<br/>
rudeness.  Instead he models his polite behavior. A few things played a part<br/>
in this change.  First, I was given a Disney tape by my mom which tells<br/>
stories and talks about polite behavior. I played it constantly. I also made<br/>
use of children&#39;s self-help storybooks that teach manners.  I&#39;m afraid I<br/>
can&#39;t think of any right now except &quot;Clifford&#39;s Manners&quot;, but that one is<br/>
pretty boring. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I set up a behavioral modification chart-writing out what kinds of behaviors<br/>
I expected my son to follow and giving him stars whenever he did them. Some<br/>
of the behaviors I delineated were saying thank you, please and your<br/>
welcome, not whining, not calling names etc.  When he earned enough stars he<br/>
was able to gain bigger rewards-like staying up later or a special treat.<br/>
<br/>
I also sat down and had a talk with my son.  I explained how it made me feel<br/>
to be spoken to rudely, and I made it clear that from now on I would not<br/>
reacte rude requests.  The &quot;I&#39;m Hungry&quot; was a big one. I normally responded<br/>
by saying &quot;Hi, hungry.  My name is Lee. How are you today?&quot; Sometimes it<br/>
felt like I was saying this all day long, but eventually it worked (after<br/>
weeks and weeks). Be careful with this &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; bit.  A lot of the times<br/>
they aren&#39;t hungry, just bored. Or even thirsty. Depending upon the<br/>
situation, I would ask him, &quot;Are you really hungry, or could you be<br/>
thirsty?&quot;  If he&#39;d just eaten I knew he was probably just bored. Distracting<br/>
him with an Otter pop (low sugar snack) and giving him a chore to do usually<br/>
motivated him to find something on his own. I also tried ignoring him, but,<br/>
being human, I didn&#39;t always suceed.  In fact, he tended to behave worse<br/>
when I did.  Humor really saved my sanity on a lot of days, since ignoring<br/>
him all the time was pretty impossible.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I did was examine my own behavior closely.  I grew up in a<br/>
family that yelled a lot-and I realised that I yelled a lot, too.  I also<br/>
realised that most of the time, instead of explaining why I wanted my son to<br/>
do something, I was simply giving commands.  I really dislike it when people<br/>
talk to me the way I was talking to my son, so I stopped talking to him that<br/>
way-even when he was rude to me.  When he was rude, I would point it out to<br/>
him by saying &quot;You&#39;re not being polite to me.  Please try harder to say what<br/>
you want in a nice way so I can help you get it.&quot; When my son saw that I was<br/>
listening, he calmed down and rephrased his request in a polite way.<br/>
<br/>
I also made it a point to praise him when he acted politely on his own, and<br/>
let him know how pleased I was with his behavior.  Whenever he said &quot;Thank<br/>
you&quot; I would say &quot;Thank you for saying thank you, sweety!&quot; and give him a<br/>
hug or a smile.<br/>
<br/>
What I found was that by remodeling my own behavior-keeping my tone of voice<br/>
even, speaking calmly and treating my son exactly the way I wished to be<br/>
treated, my son began to realise that his behavior wasn&#39;t appropriate. It<br/>
took time, and it is still a work in progress.  There are times when I feel<br/>
like pulling my hair out by the roots, but these times are getting rarer and<br/>
rarer. More like once every couple of days instead of all day everyday.<br/>
<br/>
I know this isn&#39;t easy.  It&#39;s demeaning and frustrating, but trust me-it can<br/>
get better. I know kids are different and situations vary, but I hope what I<br/>
wrote helps, and best of luck!<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Repeat after me:  I am the mom, I am the mom, I am the mom.<br/>
<br/>
{{{{{HUGS}}}}}}<br/>
<br/>
Now, the trick is to REMEMBER that...you are the mom.  That means you are an <br/>
adult, by definition, at least.  &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I took a parenting class way back when my kid was about that age (almost 15 <br/>
years ago!).  The most profound thing I heard in the whole 6 or 8 week class <br/>
was a mom talking about how frustrated she would get with her 5 yr old when <br/>
he would totally refuse to be cooperative and was generally rude and <br/>
obnoxious and here she was trying her darnedest to be nice to the kid, (say <br/>
nothing of avoiding a felonious act, ie murder!).  Anyway, she said she <br/>
finally figured it out:  if she (or DH) reacted to the child in like manner <br/>
(yelling, being mad, etc.) there were suddenly twice as many 5 yr olds in the <br/>
house!<br/>
<br/>
So, &#39;I&#39;m the mom&#39; means don&#39;t react like a 5/7/3 yr old, no matter how <br/>
tempting it may be.  Stick to your guns as nicely as possible, but don&#39;t be a <br/>
doormat.  (nothing new here, huh?  You already know all this, don&#39;t you?  We <br/>
all do and we all get frustrated in the heat of the battle.  Don&#39;t let it <br/>
throw you.)<br/>
<br/>
The second most important thing I learned from that parenting class is that <br/>
sooner or later your child is going to want something from you.  If he/she <br/>
learns that they are NOT going to get what they want by being rude or <br/>
breaking the rules, you will eventually have a bargaining chip.  Sometimes <br/>
you really have to wait and watch to find something that works.  In this case <br/>
an example might be to refuse to get food while the child is demanding it.  <br/>
(if that leaves you feeling guilty, have something available he can get for <br/>
himself...a cup of yogurt, slices of cheese, grapes, etc...and calmly say the <br/>
&lt;fill in the blanks&gt; are in the fridge, help yourself).  Won&#39;t take long and <br/>
he&#39;ll get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t tackle every issue at the same time, though.  Pick your battles if you <br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
Having given this very sage advice (LOL...it&#39;s really too bad you can&#39;t see <br/>
my own family to know how totally ridiculous it is for me to claim wisdom!), <br/>
first take a gut level assessment of things at home/in your life and kidlet&#39;s <br/>
lives.  Is there any turmoil going on?  Anyone teething?  Schedule off?  Mom <br/>
or dad busier than usual?  Missing out on bedtime stories/prayers/bath or <br/>
other rituals?  Getting enough sleep?  Enough down time?  Take the kids to <br/>
the park lately?  Played Legos?  <br/>
<br/>
I think that most of the time when kids are acting up suddenly, it is either <br/>
a growing stage where they are trying to find their place in the world or <br/>
there is something out of place in their lives.  My experience is that it can <br/>
often be something that seems to be nothing out of the ordinary to the <br/>
adults.  But, think about it, we have so much more life experience.  We know <br/>
from our own experience that teething, for instance, really doesn&#39;t go on <br/>
forever...the sore mouth will go away.  But little people just don&#39;t have <br/>
that frame of reference to yet.  They can&#39;t think past the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Having said all this...the best advice I&#39;ve seen yet was the one about the <br/>
bubble bath!  Make sure you get some time to be an adult.  A chance to have <br/>
conversations with other adults about adult things might be nice.  How long <br/>
since you and DH have been on a date?  (making an assumption here that you <br/>
are married, based on age of kids)  When was the last time you went to a <br/>
grown up movie?  (pokemon does NOT count!)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll pass.  Good luck.  I agree with the post that you are a good mom and it <br/>
is apparent because you care enough to seek solutions.   I&#39;m confident you&#39;ll <br/>
keep looking until you find something that fits.  Sometimes that&#39;s the most <br/>
important skill...tenacity to hang tough and find answers or wait out the <br/>
storm.  (of course, as soon as you figure out how to play the game, the kids <br/>
will change the rules and you get to start all over again!  bg)<br/>

&gt;  These are the men of tomorrow that you are raising, make them <br/>
&gt;  men to be proud of.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with this!  I have recently come to learn that this may be the <br/>
biggest mistake I made with my children.  DH is gone a lot and I&#39;ve had to <br/>
play single parent.  It is not easy to stand up for yourself and I&#39;ve had <br/>
trouble figuring out how.  <br/>
<br/>
Recently, DH was overseas for 20 months and when he returned he insisted on <br/>
doing things like opening my door, helping out of the car, little old <br/>
fashioned things.  At first I tried to discourage him, thinking &#39;I&#39;m <br/>
perfectly capable of opening my own doors, thank you!&#39;, &#39;and, this is slowing <br/>
us down!&#39;  But then I saw my youngest (10 at the time) start trying to beat <br/>
his dad to open my door or carry in my books from church.  I realized then <br/>
that I had cheated my boys by not teaching them polite behavior.  <br/>
<br/>
Now when I come home from grocery shopping it is DH and DS job to bring in <br/>
the groceries.  (I have FMS, so I&#39;m really exhausted by the time I get home!) <br/>
 I&#39;ve learned to not even think twice about expecting it of them.  DS has <br/>
learned it won&#39;t hurt him to bring in the groceries and help put them away.  <br/>
bg<br/>
<br/>
They aren&#39;t major brats (at least not usually...), but there still could have <br/>
been more manners taught.  Especially for the oldest one.  I&#39;m seeing the <br/>
results now.  He married at 19 (yikes!) and they had a surprise baby a year <br/>
and half later (when they got married they were told she couldn&#39;t have <br/>
children, so it was a BIG surprise!!).  So, he&#39;s had a lot of adjustments to <br/>
make.  He just turned 22 and she is 20.  They lived with us the last 9 months <br/>
or so and I could really see where he hadn&#39;t learned that it pays off to be <br/>
nice. <br/>
<br/>
It was really stressful for them living with us (900 sq foot duplex, one <br/>
bath, 4 adults, one 11 yr old, the toddler, 2 dogs...you get the picture).   <br/>
But, I&#39;m grateful that I had the chance to help retrain his thinking in this <br/>
area.  At first when his dear wife would throw a tantrum (and believe me, I <br/>
mean tantrum!  Only child, stubborn, spoiled and young.  but I&#39;m not her <br/>
mummy)...anyway, when she would get mad, he would refuse to talk to her until <br/>
she straightened up; refuse to hear that she&#39;d had a bad day with the baby or <br/>
was frustrated because she was living with her in-laws, that sort of thing.  <br/>
(I&#39;m a nice person, but what young wife wants to live with her <br/>
mother-in-law?!)  <br/>
<br/>
I tried explaining to him that it often pays off to be nice, hug her, listen <br/>
to her feelings rather than concentrate on the actual words.  Finding actual <br/>
solutions could wait until after she knew she&#39;d been heard.  He simply didn&#39;t <br/>
get it.  Couldn&#39;t see past himself.<br/>
<br/>
One night she had an especially bad day with teething baby and feeling all <br/>
cooped up.  DS was refusing to talk/listen to her and she was out in the car <br/>
crying (only place for her to be alone...she doesn&#39;t drive so she couldn&#39;t <br/>
even take herself somewhere else!).  I took the baby from him, turned off the <br/>
TV and told him to go out and talk to his wife.  <br/>
<br/>
He balked; saying she was just  throwing a tantrum.  I told him the baby had <br/>
been fussy all day, he&#39;d been at work and interacting with other people while <br/>
she was stuck here with me and the baby all day...GO TALK TO YOUR WIFE.  It <br/>
worked.  He went out and got in the car.  No idea what they talked about, but <br/>
at least he wasn&#39;t ignoring her.  About 10 minutes later I stuck my head in <br/>
the car, gave them $10 and told him to take his wife for pizza.  G&#39;ma would <br/>
give the baby a bath and put her to bed for the night. (DIL actually hugged <br/>
me for it the next day!  We are very short on funds, but that was probably <br/>
the best $10 I ever spent.  LOL)<br/>
<br/>
It worked!!  Finally, he was able to see that it pays off to be nice.  Since <br/>
then I&#39;ve caught him several times actually listening to wifey and hearing <br/>
she is having a bad day.  He even helps her find solutions rather than <br/>
getting into a blame game.  They are now in their own apartment and working <br/>
together better than I&#39;ve seen before.<br/>
<br/>
(Gosh!  I&#39;m opinionated tonight!  sorry)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I agree with this point.  Don&#39;t let them abuse you.  <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agre Sonia, maybe the difference lies in whether the savage <br/>
behaviour is accepted, or stopped.   Maybe it is the cases where it <br/>
is enforced by the Mother giving in to the unacceptable actions that <br/>
the child then goes on to becoming a sociopath.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen plenty of terrible 7 year olds turn out fine, that was what I <br/>
was trying to get across, Mothers can and do make a huge <br/>
difference.   To me Annette seems to be very concerned about the <br/>
behaviour of her boys and wants to stop it... with that attitude I&#39;m <br/>
certain that she will suceed.<br/>
<br/>
Two particular boys who I watched from yr 1 when they were in my <br/>
kids&#39; classes were terrible sevens, one had a Mother who would <br/>
yell at and hit her son for the slightest infraction, no matter if he <br/>
was trying to be good... so he had no reason to try, he was in <br/>
prison for assault before he got to 18.   Another boy&#39;s Mom would <br/>
talk softly to the boy and make all sorts of weak excuses for his <br/>
bad behaviour, last thing I heard about him he was in prison too.   <br/>
There were plenty of other kids who were just as &quot;bad&quot; as these <br/>
two, but their Mothers handled the situation differently.... not overly <br/>
strict but not too soft. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not too hard to find the middle road, the most important thing is <br/>
not only caring for your kids but caring for yourself as well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok I&#39;m going to suggest a couple of things that have worked for me.<br/>
<br/>
#1 the video &quot; 1, 2, 3 Magic &quot; is a method of how to deal with kid&#39;s<br/>
inappropriate behaviour. It is a time out method but it&#39;s a time out<br/>
with a difference.<br/>
It is humane to both the parent and the child. I personally, didn&#39;t find<br/>
it&#39;s methods coercive. It gives the kids a chance to act appropriately<br/>
before the *time out*. It gives the parents a way to deal with the<br/>
behaviour without resorting to a punishment as opposed to discipline. <br/>
You do have to be consistent and follow through with the method for it<br/>
to be effective. I have three kids and found it worked for all three<br/>
individuals.<br/>
<br/>
#2 severely limit TV. <br/>
I&#39;ve found that the majority of rotten behaviour my kids learned was<br/>
from TV as opposed to peers. I&#39;m careful about who my kids are allowed<br/>
to hang out with and limit time with kids I&#39;m not crazy about (I&#39;d like<br/>
my kids to learn how to pick their friends for their good qualities so<br/>
they need to be exposed, to a degree, to kids *I* would consider<br/>
undesirable).<br/>
<br/>
When I decided to have the TV off for almost the entire day, every day<br/>
my kids turned into nice children after about 2 weeks kids I could live<br/>
with who didn&#39;t bully me and scream insults at each other and the level<br/>
of physical confrontations between them diminished significantly (We<br/>
still have the TV off for most of the day ).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-950171470">Hi Annette,  I have 2 sons, too.  One will soon be 6, one will be 4 in a few <br/>
months.  My oldest has tried some sassiness, too.  When it occurs, I stop <br/>
whatever it is I am doing, to help stress my seriousness, look him in the <br/>
eye, and point to &quot;the time- out &quot; chair.  If I start walking toward him as I <br/>
say, &quot;in the chair&quot;, he moves there very quickly.Once in the chair I tell him <br/>
very firmly that  I do NOT tolerate any smart-mouthed talk, and if  he <br/>
chooses to speak rudely and ugly to me, then he is also choosing to sit by <br/>
himself, because I am not going to listen to it.    It doesn&#39;t take too long <br/>
for him to change his attitude, and he usually apologizes soon after.    <br/>
Sometimes he says, &quot;I&#39;ll be good now, can I get down?&quot;  Depending on the <br/>
seriousness of the incident, I may deny  him some tv time, or playing with a <br/>
particular toy, or  friend for a while.    This does not make him happy, but <br/>
my point to him is that  he needs to choose polite behavior first, because it <br/>
is the right thing to do, instead of thinking that if he says what he thinks <br/>
I want to hear, then he will basically get off scot free.     Yesterday, he <br/>
was rushing around wanting to run out the door because a neighbor had come <br/>
over.  I told him that I wanted him to put some shoes on first.  He acted <br/>
like he did not hear me,  and opened the door, so I repeated it.  He <br/>
responded with rolling his eyes, and saying &quot;OK! OK! OK!&quot;  as if I had nagged <br/>
him endlessly-, and began to stomp off down to his room. Immediately I told <br/>
him that he was &quot;in the chair&quot;, and in a huff he sat down.  After a few mins. <br/>
he asked if he could get down.  I told him all that he had to do in the first <br/>
place was just nicely say &quot;ok&quot;, and go put his shoes on, but he looked at me <br/>
and shook his head no.  So, I told him that he could just sit there longer.   <br/>
 He sat there quietly and much more calmly.  After a few mins longer, he <br/>
again asked to get down.  I said that he could.  On his own, he went and put <br/>
on his shoes, and came back and apologized for his behavior.  We hugged and <br/>
he went on out to play.   Overall, I think kids get to where they test and <br/>
retest our rules, and that it really is reassuring to them to know their <br/>
parents are going to stand firm.  I think kids will respect us more in the <br/>
long run.    I notice that my kids are influenced by the behaviors of their <br/>
neighbor friends, too, and that they &quot;try on&quot; some of those behaviors just to <br/>
see what the response is.  So, we talk a lot about manners, and polite <br/>
behavior, playing nicely, etc... and that if he sees others doing things they <br/>
should not do, than I expect him to do the right thing, and not just to go <br/>
along.  It is something to be talked about very often, as I want to really <br/>
reinforce respecting others, and following our family rules.  Some days it <br/>
can feel like you&#39;ve been in combat, but down the road we will know that all <br/>
the hard work has paid off.  Take care, keep your chin up, and stand firm.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504725687">This summer I&#39;ve been experimenting with unschooling.  In the fall we plan<br/>
to jump in feet first. :-) I have some plans to fix up our house, and would<br/>
like opinions on how I can work &quot;lessons&quot;/conscious learning into the<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
We will be repainting the entire inside of my main floor-kitchen,<br/>
livingroom, master bedroom. We plan on doing a mural on the ceilings, first<br/>
removing the drop ceiling in the livingroom and replastering the surface.<br/>
<br/>
Art is easy-I can pull out pictures of ancient murals to get ideas. We can<br/>
also have fun with painting techniques, color spectrum and such like. But<br/>
what about math and language arts attuned to a 7 year old?<br/>

&gt; I learned something from you today, Eiraul!  Some excellent<br/>
&gt; advice/ideas!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was going to add a little something for Annette myself...My daughter<br/>
&gt; just turned 8 years of age 2 weeks ago.  Believe me, almost every day of<br/>
&gt; this past (her 7th) year was a battle.Not to trivialize the issue of<br/>
unruly<br/>
&gt; children but perhaps a &quot;savage seven&quot; year old does not neccessarily<br/>
&gt; become a sociopath.  My daughter has already shown MAJOR improvement in<br/>
&gt; recent weeks!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I feel hurt and abused. I feel like a terrible mom. I don&#39;t know<br/>
whether to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  get strict with them or just back off, but I have had some pretty<br/>
drastic<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  thoughts.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Repeat after me:  I am the mom, I am the mom, I am the mom.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; {{{{{HUGS}}}}}}<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now, the trick is to REMEMBER that...you are the mom.  That means you<br/>
are an<br/>
&gt; &gt; adult, by definition, at least.  &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I took a parenting class way back when my kid was about that age (almost<br/>
15<br/>
&gt; &gt; years ago!).  The most profound thing I heard in the whole 6 or 8 week<br/>
class<br/>
&gt; &gt; was a mom talking about how frustrated she would get with her 5 yr old<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; &gt; he would totally refuse to be cooperative and was generally rude and<br/>
&gt; &gt; obnoxious and here she was trying her darnedest to be nice to the kid,<br/>
(say<br/>
&gt; &gt; nothing of avoiding a felonious act, ie murder!).  Anyway, she said she<br/>
&gt; &gt; finally figured it out:  if she (or DH) reacted to the child in like<br/>
manner<br/>
&gt; &gt; (yelling, being mad, etc.) there were suddenly twice as many 5 yr olds<br/>
in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; house!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, &#39;I&#39;m the mom&#39; means don&#39;t react like a 5/7/3 yr old, no matter how<br/>
&gt; &gt; tempting it may be.  Stick to your guns as nicely as possible, but don&#39;t<br/>
be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; doormat.  (nothing new here, huh?  You already know all this, don&#39;t you?<br/>
We<br/>
&gt; &gt; all do and we all get frustrated in the heat of the battle.  Don&#39;t let<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; throw you.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The second most important thing I learned from that parenting class is<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; sooner or later your child is going to want something from you.  If<br/>
he/she<br/>
&gt; &gt; learns that they are NOT going to get what they want by being rude or<br/>
&gt; &gt; breaking the rules, you will eventually have a bargaining chip.<br/>
Sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; you really have to wait and watch to find something that works.  In this<br/>
case<br/>
&gt; &gt; an example might be to refuse to get food while the child is demanding<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; (if that leaves you feeling guilty, have something available he can get<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; himself...a cup of yogurt, slices of cheese, grapes, etc...and calmly<br/>
say the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;fill in the blanks&gt; are in the fridge, help yourself).  Won&#39;t take long<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; he&#39;ll get the idea.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Can&#39;t tackle every issue at the same time, though.  Pick your battles if<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; can.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Having given this very sage advice (LOL...it&#39;s really too bad you can&#39;t<br/>
see<br/>
&gt; &gt; my own family to know how totally ridiculous it is for me to claim<br/>
wisdom!),<br/>
&gt; &gt; first take a gut level assessment of things at home/in your life and<br/>
kidlet&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; lives.  Is there any turmoil going on?  Anyone teething?  Schedule off?<br/>
Mom<br/>
&gt; &gt; or dad busier than usual?  Missing out on bedtime stories/prayers/bath<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; &gt; other rituals?  Getting enough sleep?  Enough down time?  Take the kids<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the park lately?  Played Legos?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think that most of the time when kids are acting up suddenly, it is<br/>
either<br/>
&gt; &gt; a growing stage where they are trying to find their place in the world<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; &gt; there is something out of place in their lives.  My experience is that<br/>
it can<br/>
&gt; &gt; often be something that seems to be nothing out of the ordinary to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; adults.  But, think about it, we have so much more life experience.  We<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; &gt; from our own experience that teething, for instance, really doesn&#39;t go<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; &gt; forever...the sore mouth will go away.  But little people just don&#39;t<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt; that frame of reference to yet.  They can&#39;t think past the moment.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Having said all this...the best advice I&#39;ve seen yet was the one about<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bubble bath!  Make sure you get some time to be an adult.  A chance to<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt; conversations with other adults about adult things might be nice.  How<br/>
long<br/>
&gt; &gt; since you and DH have been on a date?  (making an assumption here that<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; are married, based on age of kids)  When was the last time you went to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; grown up movie?  (pokemon does NOT count!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;ll pass.  Good luck.  I agree with the post that you are a good mom<br/>
and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; is apparent because you care enough to seek solutions.   I&#39;m confident<br/>
you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; keep looking until you find something that fits.  Sometimes that&#39;s the<br/>
most<br/>
&gt; &gt; important skill...tenacity to hang tough and find answers or wait out<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; storm.  (of course, as soon as you figure out how to play the game, the<br/>
kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; will change the rules and you get to start all over again!  bg)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090226449">it seems that many here are bothered by sassy behavior.  i know i am.  I<br/>
also know that my children typically don&#39;t sass anyone but me and my<br/>
husband, so imo I&#39;ve been &quot;successful&quot; in teaching htem that it is an<br/>
inappropriate behavior.  I also know that most of their interactions with<br/>
me aren&#39;t sassy (although there are days....) and most of the time it&#39;s<br/>
related to other things going on with them....hungry, tired, lonely,<br/>
angry, frustrated...and it&#39;s mostly impulse control on their part, because<br/>
believe me, I really feel like being sassy with people quite<br/>
frequently....like today when my bil was annoying me....but I&#39;ve learned<br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
Now, my question is, why does this bother us so much?  I suspect it is<br/>
because so many of us were not validated as children ourselves so we are<br/>
unable to see sassiness as a symptom and not as the problem itself.  And<br/>
my second question is why do we feel a need to punish our children for<br/>
being sassy (because let&#39;s face it, no matter how much we warn, count and<br/>
be calm about taking away the nintendo, it&#39;s not a true consequence of<br/>
their sassiness--it&#39;s a punishment)?  I know I do.  I want to say, &quot;That&#39;s<br/>
it!  No Pokemon movie because I&#39;m tired of your snapping at me&quot;.  But what<br/>
does that teach my son?  When people annoy him through their behaior to<br/>
make them miserable.  It&#39;s no different than when my mother wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;hear&quot; me when I was whining as a child.  &quot;I can&#39;t hear you when you use<br/>
that tone.&quot;  Uh, mom?  If you know what tone I&#39;m using, then you can hear<br/>
me, %^%$##!  Oh wait, that&#39;s sassy;)<br/>
<br/>
So, maybe I want to react in these ways because that is how I was treated?<br/>
I would never treat my husband that way on the occassions he gest &quot;sassy&quot;<br/>
and I know that the &quot;words&quot; he and I had yesterday in a bad moment would<br/>
qualify as &quot;sassy&quot; but I&#39;d just get angrier if he took away my email<br/>
privileges for a day or didn&#39;t let me go to the fair this week...instead,<br/>
what I appreciate when I&#39;m out of sorts and being disrespectful myself is<br/>
kindness and gentleness and quality attention.  Why then do we think<br/>
children deserve less?<br/>
<br/>
I *wasn&#39;t* allowed to sass at all when I was a child.  And that behavior,<br/>
along with some others, are real triggers for me as an adult.  They can<br/>
j8ust send me off the deep end.  And I don&#39;t like that feeling.  So, I try<br/>
to (although I&#39;m frequently unsuccessful) to get at the underlying root<br/>
and treat my children as I&#39;d like to be treated in the same situation,<br/>
which means that a lot of the time, I&#39;m empathizing with them, validating<br/>
their feelings, and trying to avoid snapping back at them instead of<br/>
trying to change their behavior.   And when I&#39;m successful at this, I see<br/>
less sassiness, although it isn&#39;t a quick fix at all.  It takes time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-577059622">HI Dawn,<br/>
you bring up some great points. I think that sassiness upsets me so much<br/>
because I don&#39;t like being talked to in a poor manner by anyone, be they 4<br/>
or 40. It is disrespectful. Not disrespect to elders, just of peoples<br/>
feelings in general. I punish for it for the same reason. Iwould like to be<br/>
able to punish everyone who talks to me this way, but obviously this is not<br/>
possible. The least I can do is teach my kids that this behavior is not<br/>
right and hope they don&#39;t grow up to be disrespectful adults. I must say on<br/>
the husband issue that I do indeed &quot;punish&quot; my husband when he talks to me<br/>
in a disrespectful manner.  I may not take away his car or his computer, but<br/>
I punish him in other ways. I will not continue a conversation with him<br/>
until his tone changes, I go out and spend lots of money :) etc. Childish?<br/>
maybe, but no more so than talking poorly to me in the first place. I really<br/>
respect the fact that you try in the moment to validate your children&#39;s<br/>
feelings and I feel this is important, but I also think it&#39;s impotant to let<br/>
a 3 yo that he cannot call me a butthead. He must learn that this is<br/>
disrespectful and if not taking him to see Pokemon is the way to drive this<br/>
home then so be it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375512846">Hmmm.  for me, planning &#39;lessons&#39; out of what we&#39;re doing misses <br/>
the point of unschooling.  There&#39;s no need to think in terms of &#39;art,&#39; <br/>
or &#39;maths,&#39; or &#39;language arts,&#39; it&#39;s all life.  The only time I would <br/>
think about subjects is when it&#39;s necessary to think in <br/>
&#39;educationese&#39; if one is going to be inspected by some &#39;official,&#39; (as <br/>
someone on another list puts it, ppimps&#39; (Persons Paid to Invade <br/>
My Privacy) rather than &#39;professionals&#39; in some cases)  If you do <br/>
need to create a log with educationese-type language, well that <br/>
could be your language arts lesson!  But for maths, with painting, <br/>
what about the measuring of the walls, the calculating the required <br/>
amount of paint, the required proportion of ingredients to mix for <br/>
plastering...  if you intend to use natural paints, there&#39;s a history <br/>
lesson in there, and geology...<br/>

be so detrimental to them. I have yet to read siblings without rivalry or<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220822158">I would also like to suggest something...<br/>
<br/>
First let me introduce myself, my name is Amy and I am the proud mom of one <br/>
son, 7 1/2 yo.  I homeschool my son, go to college (working on Elementary <br/>
Education/Early Childhood degree), lead a 4-H group, and have started a <br/>
homeschool support group.  <br/>
<br/>
I have had problems with my son in the past.  He was openly hostile, would <br/>
seemingly do things he knew were wrong while looking me right in the eye, and <br/>
the list goes on.  I was at my wits end!  I heard everything from &quot;he&#39;s just <br/>
doing normal boy things&quot; to &quot;you should think about putting him on Ritalin&quot;.  <br/>
He was losing friends, and was not always welcome at everyone&#39;s home.  <br/>
<br/>
One day while I was in the book store, I came across this book called &quot;Living <br/>
with the Active/Alert Child&quot; by  Linda S. Budd, Ph.D.  The first sentence, in <br/>
the first chapter said &quot;did you put on your running shoes when your child was <br/>
born, and have worn out several pairs since?&quot;  This sentence stopped me dead <br/>
in my tracks and I thought &quot;yeah! yeah, I have!&quot;  This book went on to <br/>
describe a child who either required little sleep, or had a hard time falling <br/>
asleep.  A child who seem to get more active or frantic as the day wore on, <br/>
and much more.  Well, I bought that book and it has saved our lives!  My <br/>
child is now cooperating, and becoming better and better at getting along <br/>
with others.  I sometimes feel so bad, because I did not understand him, and <br/>
literally took the wrong road as far as discipline, but now things are so <br/>
much better.  <br/>
<br/>
There are 11 traits to an active/alert child:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Active<br/>
2.  Alert<br/>
3.  Bright<br/>
4.  Controlling<br/>
5.  Fearful<br/>
6.  Intense<br/>
7.  Attention-hungry<br/>
8.  Trouble getting along with others<br/>
9.  Fluctuating self-esteem<br/>
10. Performers<br/>
11. Empathic ability<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend this book to anyone who thinks that this profile fits <br/>
their child.  I was an active/alert child myself.  I have also begun to <br/>
understand why some things are the way they are in my life.  I don&#39;t want you <br/>
to think that I am selling this book or anything, you can get it from your <br/>
local book store, or online,  I just know what a difference it has made for <br/>
my family, and most importantly for my son.  There is also a web site <br/>
dedicated to this type of child : <br/>

&gt;  which means that a lot of the time, I&#39;m empathizing with them, validating<br/>
&gt;  their feelings, and trying to avoid snapping back at them instead of<br/>
&gt;  trying to change their behavior.   And when I&#39;m successful at this, I see<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>good for you!  And I think you&#39;ve got a really good point here.  If children <br/>
know we respect them and their needs, they are much more likely to respect <br/>
other people and their needs.  Too often children are seen as a nuisance <br/>
rather than a treasure (IMHO).  How often do we hear from other parents &#39;oh, <br/>
I could never stand to have my child at home all day.  How do you do you do <br/>
that?&#39;  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, if I had to give only one reason I homeschool this would be it...I <br/>
like my kids and I&#39;m selfish enough to want them around all the time.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t an answer to why it sets parents off...it does seem to be a rather <br/>
universal reaction (or at least almost universal).  To me that begs the <br/>
question what is &#39;sass&#39;?  I simply won&#39;t tolerate rudeness in my home.  I <br/>
don&#39;t give rudeness and I won&#39;t allow anyone else to be rude either.   Any <br/>
family member is free to speak their honest opinion and let us know what&#39;s <br/>
going on or problems they may have.  Everyone has had to learn how to state <br/>
their opinion in polite ways.  Sad to admit it, but mom had to be the first <br/>
to learn!  (I used to be a screamer...hated what it did to me and my family.  <br/>
Learned not to do that AND not to just hold in negative feelings.  Best thing <br/>
I ever learned and I have worked to pass it on to my family.)<br/>
<br/>
I try to go with natural consequences.  I don&#39;t think some things should wait <br/>
long enough for natural consequences to make a difference.  Manners can be <br/>
one of those things.  If a child takes years &#39;learning&#39; that no one likes <br/>
him, he may never figure out that it&#39;s because he is rude.  In that case he&#39;s <br/>
missed the lesson, learned negative thinking and I&#39;ve allowed a lot of harm <br/>
to come to this little person I&#39;m responsible to/for.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents worth,<br/>

else. I will not tolerate being spoken to in a disrestectful manner by my <br/>
children. I think that the natural consequence of this behavior is me <br/>
getting really p****d off. If, then, I do not want to spend the money I have <br/>
worked extremely hard for to take the rude child to the new Pokemon movie, <br/>
but to instead spend it on myself, or stay home and relax in front of a <br/>
movie I want to see instead of having the Nintendo on, that is a very <br/>
natural and direct consequence. If I am treated with love and respect for my <br/>
feelings, then I will return it by sharing my money and giving up my time at <br/>
home to run people all over town. If my children do not appreciate all I do <br/>
for them, then I won&#39;t do it. What could be a more natural consequence?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am not particularly bothered by sassy behaviour, I have always <br/>
encouraged my children to speak their minds, even if what is <br/>
coming out of their mouths may be insulting to me.   If what they <br/>
are saying is something that they see as being truthful, then they <br/>
can say whatever is on their mind.  <br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that I have to like what they are saying, however <br/>
if I don&#39;t like it, maybe I need to listen carefully to try to understand <br/>
where they are coming from.<br/>
<br/>
However if they were to say exactly the same thing in a loud or <br/>
aggressive manner then I wouldn&#39;t hear it, I would tell them to come <br/>
back to me when they could talk in civil tones.   This is the big <br/>
difference between being rude and being a little sassy, and I&#39;m sure <br/>
that was what started this subject, a Mother who thought her kids <br/>
had become rude, she was bothered by it enough to bring it up to <br/>
this group.<br/>
<br/>
I guess most of us here enjoy our children&#39;s company otherwise <br/>
they would probably be in school, and as children can be brutally <br/>
honest a lot of the time and we have probably all had to face some <br/>
candid facts about ourselves seen through our children&#39;s eyes.  <br/>
This is a good thing, if they see that we can change our bad habits <br/>
through listening to their input then they are more likely to be able <br/>
to change some of their behaviours that we find unacceptable.<br/>
<br/>
We are all human beings, all imperfect and if we allow our children <br/>
to see that we are imperfect just like them it makes their lives so <br/>
much easier, and makes them feel better about their own <br/>
imperfections, knowing that we don&#39;t expect perfection from anyone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote># 11 is a big cause of problems, this empathy in someone so <br/>
young often makes the child mis-read signals.   I had major <br/>
problems with my second son, he fit all of the above 11 signs, I <br/>
tried so many ways to find our why he could be such a problem <br/>
child to me and resorted to seeing a child guidance officer, <br/>
fortunatley he was an astute family man who cared for children and <br/>
saw right away where the problem lay.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I was upset or bothered in the slightest by anything at all <br/>
Aaron would pick up on my feelings, but being so young couldn&#39;t <br/>
figure out where my bad feelings were coming from.   Young <br/>
children are so egotistical that in one so young and so empathic if <br/>
he saw that his Mother was hurting, then he believed that he must <br/>
be the cause.   <br/>
<br/>
So at the ripe old age of 2 1/2 the key to a problem that I seemed <br/>
to have had all of his life was found.   When I was equipped with <br/>
this knowledge I was able to solve the problem, if I was feeling low <br/>
in any way I had to let Aaron know that it wasn&#39;t him, that maybe I <br/>
was feeling a little sick or tired or mad because the house was a <br/>
mess, not mad at him.  This solved our problems, once he knew <br/>
that all my feelings were not aimed at him he became a different <br/>
child, he was helpful and would comfort me when I was suffering <br/>
from any low feelings.<br/>

  <div><tt>It&#39;s not too hard to find the middle road, the most important thing 
  is <br>not only caring for your kids but caring for yourself as 
  well.<br></tt></div>
  <div><tt><font face="Arial">I have come to realize that children are no 
  different from adults when it comes to how they want to be treated. Think 
  about it. When you make a mistake and someone comes up to you and starts 
  hitting you or yelling at you or screaming at you how do you feel/like it. 
  When it comes to disaplining my 3.5 and 5.5yo I try to keep this in mind. 
  However, I also don&#39;t let them go on making the same mistake. I will sit down 
  with them at first and explain that their behavior is inapproriate and why and 
  that I don&#39;t want to see/hear it again. The next time it happens I will repeat 
  the previous discussion and tell them what will happen if it they continue 
  with the behaviour. If it continues, and I usually give thema&nbsp; few mor 
  chances of reminding depending on the child and situation, then they will 
  receive something strict like having a toy or&nbsp; activity removed. 
  Eventually, I end up sending them to their room. and Very few times I have 
  done to the child what it was that they did to the other person. I did this 
  the other&nbsp; day with 5.5yo when he hit his 3.5yo sister with a stick that 
  1&quot; in diamiter and 4&#39; long. Hitting with sticks is absolutely not allowed and 
  he knows this and it is something that he repeats periodicly. I had DD get me 
  the stick he hit her with and then used it to spank his hiney. I didn&#39;t hit 
  him as hard as I thought he should have been because of the size of the stick 
  but after I used the stick I used my bare hand abt3 times so he did feel that. 
  Then I sent him to his room. I also told him that if it happens again I will 
  get a stick myself and it will be tiny round one that will hurt his hiney. 
  That is the first time I have used anything other than my hand to spank...and 
  I only use spanking as a last resort. MIL and SIL tell me all the time that I 
  am doing a good job with them because when the kids spend time over there they 
  are always very well behaved and polite. They say that is the true test...how 
  they behave when mom and dad are not around.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, hope this 
  helps. Corallyn.<br></font></tt></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
