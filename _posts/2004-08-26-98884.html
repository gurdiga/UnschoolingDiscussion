alternate route home!  Maybe through Atlanta?  I think there&#39;s some good<br/>
museums there but not sure, never been.<br/>
<br/>
I forgot about Harper&#39;s Ferry.  Definitely recommend it.<br/>
<br/>
While in DC area maybe at least drive up on the grounds of Arlington House<br/>
(called Custis-Lee Mansion from 1955 to 1972 - no wonder I still call it<br/>
that!), even if you don&#39;t take the house tour.  It&#39;s at the VA end of the<br/>
Memorial Bridge, which ends at the Lincoln Memorial (try to get in there -<br/>
Lincoln is so impressive, and some of his speeches are engraved on the<br/>
wall).  Arlington House was Robert E. Lee&#39;s home by marriage, confiscated<br/>
during the war and not returned until after his death.   So he agreed to<br/>
move to Lexington to be President of then Washington College, now W&L<br/>
University.  I&#39;ve always found the George Washington - Custis family - Lee<br/>
family connections interesting.  Just more to fill your time!<br/>
