<div id="ygrps-yiv-502668966">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I received a wonderfully heart-warming email privately from Rebecca and<br/>
tried responding to her.  I guess there was a problem with her email<br/>
address or her server because I couldn&#39;t send her my response.  She<br/>
didn&#39;t receive it.  If you&#39;re out there Rebecca please email me again<br/>
and confirm your email address for me. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Sonia in Saskatoon</div>
