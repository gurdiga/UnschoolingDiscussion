<div id="ygrps-yiv-321493608">&lt;Just one laugh at an opportune moment (my own mother-in-law&#39;s specialty) can <br/>
cause a child to doubt his parents really know what they&#39;re doing.  &gt;                                                     Sandra, I know this laugh, I hate this laugh! :) I have learned how to say, &quot;time to go&quot; when this laugh starts. Fortunately my children know this behavior too and they often can see through it. It is hard though because my children love their grammy and grampy and I want them to be able to have relationships with family. It&#39;s always a little bit of a struggle so I try to let go and pick my battles..... and stay briefly! Kelli<br/>
