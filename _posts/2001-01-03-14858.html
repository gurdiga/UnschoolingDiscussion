<div id="ygrps-yiv-863328811">I would say nursing strike too.  It is very rare for a child younger than<br/>
18 months to wean cold turkey.<br/>
<br/>
You could call 1-800-LA-LECHE to get a phone number for a leader near you<br/>
and she can give you all sorts of tips for getting him back on (faster<br/>
than we can type!)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you should express milk to relieve your engorgement and keep milk<br/>
supply up.  Try nursing him when he is sleepy, or in the tub.  Could also<br/>
give him expressed milk by cup.<br/>
<br/>
Hope he feels better soon.  I&#39;m sure it helped to get that great fluid<br/>
while he was sick!  BTW, doctors in the know will recommend breastfeeding<br/>
over stuff like pediolyte for sick kids.  It is considered a clear fluid<br/>
and is very quickly and easily digested.<br/>
