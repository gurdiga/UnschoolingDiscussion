<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105470589">One of my main sources of info on Praise is &quot;Punished By Rewards&quot; as I&#39;ve no doubt said before.  A fellow unschooler used it to transform a small bank branch into a behemoth of a sales organization by stopping all the Corporate &quot;praise&quot; devices (contests, commissions, etc.) within his branch.  People (and kids are people too) can smell a phony concept a mile away.  &quot;Turd in punchbowl&quot; obvious!  <br/>
<br/>
Same with praise after the kids figure it out.  &quot;Mom doles out small amounts so I expect that I can make her do it maore often.&quot;  It creates an upward spiralling cycle of manipulation.  Action, praise, action again, gold star, action again, candy, ... action again, sports car.  And a hollow feeling inside because the rewardee has no idea WHAT THEY want!  Reward breeds unhappiness!<br/>
<br/>
Or if Mom won&#39;t praise, I&#39;ll withdraw and not play.  I&#39;m no rat in a cage!&quot;  Reward breeds sloth and apathy! <br/>

woo hoo.....now what???  lol  <br/>
<br/>
Btw, this manipulation can only happen if the child is taught to believe that <br/>
the parent&#39;s opinions and goals are more important than the child&#39;s.  In <br/>
unschooling, this doesn&#39;t happen, obviously.  ( Honestly, that&#39;s why I had no idea <br/>
what you guys were talking about!!!  *giggle*)<br/>
