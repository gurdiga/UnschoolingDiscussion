<div id="ygrps-yiv-305364473">Last Thursday, Julian (who is 15) began playing music, guitar and singing,  <br/>
as a street musician in downtown Salem (Massachusetts).  He opened his  guitar <br/>
case and just started.<br/>
 <br/>
He ended up staying out for a couple of hours. I hung out (at a distance,  so <br/>
it wouldn&#39;t look like he had his Mommy there) for about 45 minutes, and he  <br/>
was awesome. He ended up making over $20 in tips, meeting and playing with some <br/>
 other street musicians who were very complimentary, and having a great  time.<br/>
 <br/>
So Julian is now a professional musician. Cool, huh?<br/>

Good for him!<br/>
<br/>
In Australia street musicians are called buskers, and are a real tradition<br/>
in city subway stations, street corners, wandering the neighborhood pubs on<br/>
Saturdays, and in the street malls and plazas. <br/>

him later maybe?  <br/>

That is so awesome!!  You are so lucky he has a place to do  this.  I wish we <br/>
had one close.  I play fiddle and my  son plays accordian, and they all <br/>
dance...I&#39;d love to take them someplace  to get a few bucks... Hooray for your son!!<br/>
 <br/>
My kids are in a 4H group that does Morris dancing, Irish Dancing, and  <br/>
Scottish (Highland) dancing.  Usually the Morris dancing is done on the  street at <br/>
festivals, and the kids usually &quot;panhandle&quot; afterwards and bring in a  good <br/>
amount of money to put in the bank towards costumes, etc., or just to  spend.  <br/>
Don&#39;t know how kosher that is with 4H, but both of us leaders are  unschoolers <br/>
so it works out great!<br/>

You are lucky to live someplace where they allow street musicians <br/>
instead of treating them like panhandlers and chase them off the street.<br/>

Yes, the other part of this was that he first called City Hall to find out  <br/>
if he needed a permit. They said no, and suggested that he call the police to  <br/>
get more info. He did, and they told him he could do it as long as he didn&#39;t <br/>
use  amplification.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You might check with your local farmer&#39;s market if you<br/>
would like to be a &quot;busker&quot;--here at ours they have<br/>
entertainers take turns playing for tips all day on<br/>
Saturday, and on a &quot;stage&quot; at the wednesday market. <br/>
Lots of people already enjoying themselves with their<br/>
wallets out!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047067360">Cool! Congratulations to him!<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering about permit. I had heard something a<br/>
few years ago about Cambridge becoming more<br/>
restrictive in their permits. Or could&#39;ve been Boston.<br/>
Anyhow I&#39;m glad that there are places that don&#39;t<br/>
require a permit.<br/>
