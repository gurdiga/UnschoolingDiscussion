Hey! How are you??<br/>
<br/>
Are you back unschooling? Seems that there are a few families in Jacksonville <br/>
that are posting lately (but maybe on UnschoolingDisgustinglist).<br/>
<br/>
So nice to see you here! Our best to you all!<br/>

HEY HEY HEY....<br/>
<br/>
Be nice about that list I work so hard on.<br/>
<br/>
I was in arm&#39;s reach the first time Kirby and Marty heard a school bell.   I <br/>
was dropping Kirby off for a girlfriend&#39;s 8th grade graduation ceremony (on a <br/>
schoolday afternoon) and we were outside the deserted front of a midschool.  <br/>
Kirby was leaning into the car to get his jacket.  He was all dressed up, shirt <br/>
& tie.  Ten feet behind him a BIG combo electric and mechanical bell (for the <br/>
full indoor and outdoor effect) rang and he jumped like he&#39;d been shot, and <br/>
Marty, who was 11 or so, yelled  &quot;What was THAT!?&quot; from the back seat.<br/>
<br/>
I was really happy at that moment to realize they had gotten to the ages of <br/>
11 and 13 or so and never yet heard that sound, which secondary-schoolkids hear <br/>
+/- 20 times a day for years.<br/>
