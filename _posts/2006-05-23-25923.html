<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104646378">Hey, everyone-<br/>
<br/>
 Want to clear up some hotel issues.<br/>
<br/>
  I understand there have been some hotel reservation problems as well <br/>
as information being passed to some of you about the room rates being <br/>
higher if you have children. Here is some clarification as well as some <br/>
other information which may be helpful in working out any issues. If <br/>
what I give you doesn&#39;t work, send me an e-mail directly at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kbcdlovejo@...">kbcdlovejo@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
  1) Price for rooms/suites is per room regardless of the types of <br/>
people in the room (ie, adults, children, or combination of the two). <br/>
For the person who posted last week that she heard from Central <br/>
Reservations otherwise, I&#39;m glad to report that was inaccurate:) I <br/>
confirmed that today with the Sales Manager whom I negotiated with when <br/>
we agreed upon the hotel. Price per room is $89 + tax; $109 + tax per <br/>
suite;<br/>
<br/>
  2) To make reservations by phone, call the hotel&#39;s direct line at <br/>
(505) 843-6300. While this number is on the L&L Website along with the <br/>
800 #, it goes directly to the hotel reservation personnel. These folks <br/>
know more about the conference than their Central Reservations <br/>
personnel (RE: those at the 800 #) since this number goes to an <br/>
off-property location in Canada. I have asked the Sales Manager to <br/>
block some rooms with Central Reservations in case you still are <br/>
switched to Central Reservations if you call either the 505 or 800 #s. <br/>
One hint: if you call the direct number, hang up and try again if not <br/>
answered on the 5th ring. That is the magic number for a switch over to <br/>
Central Reservations; and,<br/>
<br/>
  3) You can also make reservations via e-mail. Send your name, the <br/>
number of nights that you plan to stay, the dates of your stay, your <br/>
credit card information with expiration date, and the type of room (ie, <br/>
single King, double, or suite) to Brenda Parra at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bparra@...">bparra@...</a>. <br/>
Ms. Parra should send you a confirmation after a few days.<br/>
