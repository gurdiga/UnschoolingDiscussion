<div id="ygrps-yiv-22725914">Hello ladies,<br/>
<br/>
My girls are also looking to chat online with someone.  Our eldest <br/>
daughter will be 14 in less than a month, and our youngest <br/>
daughter is 81/2.  They have both chatted a bit on icq, but we can&#39;t <br/>
find many children online.  We have tried mirc, but that hasn&#39;t been <br/>
terribly successful, although, they do wish to keep trying.  I always <br/>
sit with them.  Perhaps we could arrange a time, and a server <br/>
where all of the children could meet.  I could set the channel up as <br/>
invite only, so only those children who ask permission via this list, <br/>
have access to the channel.  I have a 12 year old son, who is a <br/>
computer whiz, and he could help ensure security.<br/>
