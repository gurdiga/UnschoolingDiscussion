<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717283805">Hi Julie<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been IN depression as a teenager. Starting when I was a <br/>
teenager, shall we say. But I tend to be an introvert with <br/>
melancholic tendencies, anyway. Bit of a pessimist, I am. Low-grade <br/>
depression is something I will deal with all my life, and just lately <br/>
have learned how to do so. <br/>
<br/>
Your teen sounds like he/she has had a childhood similar to mine, in <br/>
that there was some bullying and much non-fitting-in all the way <br/>
through school.<br/>
<br/>
Is the person doing drugs? Then there might need to be intervention. <br/>
An active sex-life means at least a dr. visit to get contraceptive <br/>
and check for std&#39;s. (My depression manifested itself in big time <br/>
promiscuity starting as a young teenager) If this kid is thinking <br/>
about suicide...time for intervention. NOW.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, I don&#39;t know. My folks got the family into counselling <br/>
when I started *gasp* smoking. (er, three years after I becamse <br/>
sexually active, btw) Point being, I knew the counselling was lame. I <br/>
couldn&#39;t have told you at the time what I wanted, but I knew what I <br/>
didn&#39;t want: to sit in a chair in a counsellor&#39;s office with parents <br/>
who thought the family problem was ME. In retrospect, possibly <br/>
spending lots and lots of time with people who genuinely were <br/>
interested in me, interested in doing cool things with me, maybe even <br/>
talking about some of the stuff in my life...<br/>
<br/>
IOW, if my folks had known I was screwing around and smoking pot, <br/>
there might have been more rapid and thorough response from them. <br/>
AND!!! even not knowing the depths of my trouble, if they could have <br/>
let me know that they really and truly liked being with me and <br/>
accepted me where I was (F student, amazing reader, totally bizaarre <br/>
thinking processes, loner without many friends) and hung with me <br/>
without judging...maybe some of that trouble would have gone away <br/>
without a lot of intervention.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if that helps at all. I&#39;m thinking, with my attitude what <br/>
it was back then, I might have turned away from any genuine parental <br/>
intiatives to win my heart.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>

<br/>
I hope someone else offers more specific information.<br/>
<br/>
Just generally, there is quite a bit of mental health information <br/>
available on the internet.  I&#39;m sure that I&#39;ve seen tests or quizzes one <br/>
can take to assess depression.  You could add &quot;warning signs&quot; into your <br/>
search string.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to &quot;depression&quot;, you may also want to look at information <br/>
about &quot;post traumatic stress&quot; because it sounds like your son&#39;s <br/>
experiences were fairly traumatic.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  With winter coming, finding ways to have plenty of sunshine and <br/>
activity is important for many people.  Cloudy days and darkness <br/>
certainly make me feel &quot;down&quot;.</div>

Here is a site on teen depression:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://kidshealth.org/teen/your_mind/mental_health/depression.html">http://kidshealth.org/teen/your_mind/mental_health/depression.html</a><br/>
<br/>
This is to be taken seriously. Many teens are depressed and even <br/>
suicidal.  The teen years are often an all-or-nothing time, when it <br/>
feels like we have to do it, or else.  Seeing a therapist or social <br/>
worker, or finding a good group for peer counseling might help.  And <br/>
good nutrition plus adequate sleep can help, too.  <br/>
<br/>
When someone I knew was very depressed, suicidally depressed, I <br/>
helped the person find a therapist and get in to see someone right <br/>
away.  After several months of therapy the therapist concluded that <br/>
this person probably needed to go on an anti-depressant drug.  Since <br/>
he and his wife did not believe in this type of thing I suggested <br/>
that he try homeopathic treatment for the depression for the six <br/>
weeks that his therapist would be gone on vacation, before she <br/>
returned to prescribe medication for him.  <br/>
<br/>
He did and when he went back to see his therapist, presumably to get <br/>
a prescription for an anti-depressant, she saw such great improvement <br/>
that she not only did not prescribe any drugs, but said she did not <br/>
need to see him any longer unless something else came up.  <br/>
<br/>
He has remained under homeopathic care, taking a constitutional <br/>
remedy when needed, about every 4-6 months, and has never returned to <br/>
his suicidally depressed state, leads a full and very demanding life, <br/>
for 4 years now.  He has even taken on some firsts, breaking many of <br/>
his own self-limitations in recent years.  Pretty good for someone <br/>
who was diagnosed with severe depression, threatening suicide.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it is important to do both, though; therapy and treatment.  A <br/>
good therapist can often catch things if they are turning bad, and do <br/>
something before that suicide threat becomes a nightmare.  And good <br/>
homeopathic treatment can progress ever so much quicker with the help <br/>
of a good therapist.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377852441">Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll probably get better ideas but I wonder if you could go out with<br/>
him at night, just walk around your town or the country where you live. <br/>
Getting out at night has some kind of magical effect on people and it&#39;s<br/>
easy to talk about anything while your out just wandering.  <br/>
If you can&#39;t go at night maybe you could find a way to go hiking with him<br/>
during the day, someplace really beautiful and quiet.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something about that makes a person thoughtful and he might share<br/>
something with you that will give you an idea why he&#39;s feeling the way he<br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
Is it hormonal?<br/>
Is it maybe that summer&#39;s ending and the season&#39;s changing and he just<br/>
doesn&#39;t like change that much.  That happens to Dylan sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s normal to be melancholy sometimes.  Young people especially<br/>
have dramatic mood swings and dramatic ways of reporting on big emotions,<br/>
but I don&#39;t think that necessarily means a dangerous condition. <br/>
<br/>
I hope something brilliant occurs to you and he begins to feel better. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178550368">I have dealt with this here in our home. It actually showed itself in a very<br/>
physical way which caused me to seek out professional help. It started out<br/>
with in home counselling twice a week at first, tapering off to once a week,<br/>
once every 2 weeks and then finally once a month before ending. There was<br/>
also medication involved for a period of one year and now no longer needed.<br/>
There was a Dr. follow up with the meds and counselling every 8 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the physical problem we dealt with, there was intense moodiness.<br/>
Very high highs and without warning, incredible lows. Change in eating<br/>
habits, with actually eating more than usual. Problems sleeping at night but<br/>
not excessive sleeping or sleeping during the day. Not lethargic like some<br/>
people think. Concentration went down and school grades fell. There was also<br/>
a change in sexual behavior. Changes in self esteem were evident too.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me privately if I can offer any other info.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684953069">Julie, what you describe is very similar to what my oldest went through,<br/>
although it started younger for him--he was 9 or 10 when it became such<br/>
that I felt driven to find a counselor (not an easy thing for me to do!)<br/>
<br/>
In our case, the cause was an alcoholic first grade teacher who drank<br/>
during class hours.  I was aware of the personality change in my son,<br/>
but between his being the first child in school and all my &#39;friends&#39;<br/>
telling me personality changes were normal, I didn&#39;t listen to my gut<br/>
feeling.  Eventually he became very depressed, almost suicidal.<br/>
<br/>
I was lucky at the right time (or maybe it was meant &lt;g&gt;) in that an<br/>
acquaintance with a boy about the same age recommended a counselling<br/>
business not too far from where we lived, and we got hooked up with a<br/>
counselor who was fantastic.  I later went to see him myself, primarily<br/>
about unresolved grief issues.<br/>
<br/>
Chris was able to see the counselor two times a week for a year before<br/>
the good ole Army moved us to Germany.  Longer would have been better,<br/>
he is still working through issues--but then I guess we all do.  Joining<br/>
the Army himself did at least teach him he had a pretty cushy upbringing<br/>
compared to a lot of people!<br/>
<br/>
Go with your gut feeling, Julie!  If you feel the teen is depressed,<br/>
chances are pretty good he is.  A supportive, accepting counselor--or,<br/>
failing that, another adult whom he trusts (and you trust) for him to<br/>
talk to can make a world of difference.  I know my son didn&#39;t talk much<br/>
to me because his personality was such that he didn&#39;t want to be a<br/>
bother.  Going through all sorts of issues myself, I must have projected<br/>
being stressed and therefore unavailable to him &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On the plus side, it was part of what led us to homeschooling!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799992148">Thanks everyone for your terrific responses. I had a conversation <br/>
with my teen and it went really well. He&#39;s actually asking for <br/>
therapy so I&#39;m grateful for that. The cues are less obvious in our <br/>
case because he&#39;s such a happy-go-lucky personality. But the <br/>
clue for me was that when faced with trouble in friendships, he <br/>
withdraws totally and blames self.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your suggestions, especially to go with my gut.<br/>
<br/>
And thanks for the private stories shared via email too. You are <br/>
wonderful moms.<br/>

Our 7th grade English teacher drank.  She would go to a tall metal storage <br/>
cabinet and get way inside the doors where nobody could see her and lean in, her <br/>
head all the way into the shelf.  We couldn&#39;t figure what else it could be, <br/>
and those of us with parents who drank recognized the behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
We never told on her, though.  We just messed with her, like a cat will mess <br/>
with a mouse.   She insulted us, we laughed it off, and subtly messed with her <br/>
head.  The work was really easy, she was quite inattentive, and so it was an <br/>
easy hour and we left it at that.<br/>
