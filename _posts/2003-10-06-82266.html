etc... And you have to understand about Julian&#39;s hair -- he has thick, very <br/>
curly hair that gets long fast, and that he never combs, so it looks entirely <br/>
possible that critters could be living in there.<br/>
<br/>
And we WOULD have conversations....I&#39;d find myself having a long, interesting <br/>
conversation (most often with Joe, who was a little <br/>
less...well...insane....than some of them, and would SWEAR i saw a squirrel, talking before me.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned to Julian the other day that I missed the squirrels, and he said <br/>
he understood, but &quot;It&#39;s just as well, Mama...by now they would have had to <br/>
tear down the disco and build an insane asylum.&quot;<br/>
