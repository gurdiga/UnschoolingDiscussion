<div id="ygrps-yiv-817190836"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Just in case anyone ever needs to know. Rubbing alcohol will take Silly <br/>
&gt; Putty out of the rug and also clothes. Works like a charm.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With all the lawsuits being brought against companies, I&#39;ve noticed that many <br/>
products now have warnings on them that border on the ridiculous.  For my own <br/>
amusement, I&#39;ve taken to reading the packaging on many products.  Turn over <br/>
the card that the egg of silly putty comes in and you&#39;ll be surprised (?) to <br/>
find out that silly putty is not recommended for use as earplugs.  Really.<br/>

I&#39;ve wondered why since Christmas the kids don&#39;t seem to hear me anymore!! <br/>
