<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828242580"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I know my son usually always chooses reading to stories to watching TV, but<br/>
&gt; sometimes I say know when he&#39;s already spent two hours in the mornings<br/>
&gt; watching his programmes and then want to watch a video later.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So let him.  I have been trying to look at my unschooling one day at a time,<br/>
as far as the choices, and one month at a time, as far as how it&#39;s going.<br/>
<br/>
Let me restate that.  When my son asks, &quot;Is it okay if I....&quot;, I might<br/>
figure, well, sure, why not.  I mean, is it going to ruin him to have<br/>
another whavever?  But I wait until the end of the month or more to<br/>
evaluate.<br/>
<br/>
If you tried withdrawing all tv limits, then you might have days where your<br/>
children watched a whole lot of tv, but looking back over a month, would you<br/>
feel like all they did was watch tv?  Probably not.<br/>
<br/>
Also, consider your own habits.  You&#39;ve said nothing about your own tv<br/>
viewing, so I have no idea what you do.  My husband and I don&#39;t watch much<br/>
tv and don&#39;t pay for cable.  TV isn&#39;t part of our son&#39;s habits, either, at<br/>
least now (he&#39;s 6).  If the adults watch a lot of tv, or have the tv on for<br/>
background, then maybe your concerns about what your young children see or<br/>
how much they watch are different than ours.<br/>
<br/>
I do suspect that some of the studies that have been done about TV viewing<br/>
habits do not take into account that in many, many homes the TV runs<br/>
constantly.  Whether or not the children actually watch it may be debatable.<br/>
