<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058881190">The Activator Method! During my pregnancy I was like a puppy about to get a <br/>
bone when the chiro would get out the activator!A few clicks and I would be <br/>
painfree, have wonderful chills and waves of well being and could fall asleep <br/>
right on the table-which I did once or twice when I didn&#39;t have any kids with <br/>
me-at the chiro&#39;s insistence!<br/>
