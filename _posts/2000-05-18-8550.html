<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206468343">Hello, Susan.  Welcome to unschooling.  We live in Humboldt County, Eureka<br/>
to be exact.  Hwy 101 runs right through<br/>
the middle of town.    Speaking of wildlife, right now we have about a<br/>
half-dozen gray whales playing tourist in the bay.  Sometimes I think we<br/>
should write all the critters &quot;thank-you&quot; notes because of all the<br/>
unschooling adventures they have precipitated.<br/>

&gt; Where do you live? Sounds idyllic. I live in Santa Maria, CA now, but<br/>
&gt; used to live in Alaska where I saw lots of wonderful wildlife.<br/>
&gt; Take care,<br/>
&gt; Susan, new to the unschooling list<br/>
