I know for me that extra kids would be extra pressure, even if I were  <br/>
getting paid to watch them.  I have considered having older kids in after  school, <br/>
though.  In your house, with 6 kids if I&#39;m understanding it  right, I guess <br/>
it&#39;s all about the kids, anyway.  &lt;g&gt;  I  would definitely be looking to keep <br/>
older kids and not babies, and  that&#39;s for the babies&#39; sakes as much as yours and <br/>
your kids, too.  <br/>
 <br/>
You should make sure you check your state laws and have a good idea how  many <br/>
kids it is legal to keep for money in your home.   <br/>
 <br/>
As far as unschooling, are your older kids already feeling like they don&#39;t  <br/>
get enough time with you?  I can imagine that a 10 yo might be pushing  his/her <br/>
needs aside because they can see you are busy with the  toddlers/babies.  <br/>
Thus is the life of the firstborn, but there are and  should be limits.  If that <br/>
were the case, I&#39;d be very hesitant.  If  you you are thinking that the older <br/>
kids would help you with the new kids,  I&#39;d be sure to get their buy-in on <br/>
that idea, and make sure they are getting  compensated in some way, too.   You <br/>
might have to accept no for an  answer from your olders as well.  <br/>
 <br/>
So, I say, check with your 8 and 10 yos and see what they think about the  <br/>
idea.  Give them an opportunity to give honest feedback, and take it  seriously. <br/>
 Your own kids should come first, of course.  Good luck  with that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613023546">Hi Dina.  Having a home day care is a great way to bring in extra <br/>
income in your home and still be home with your own kids.  My advice <br/>
would be to first have an off-limits area for the day care kids <br/>
where your own kids could get away from the day care kids if they <br/>
wanted.  This could even be their own rooms.  Sometimes your own <br/>
kids might not want to share and that needs to be ok.  Obviously <br/>
they will have to share YOU for a big part of the day every day, but <br/>
you could explain that to them before you even start and see how <br/>
they feel about it.  The second issue is that it will be much harder <br/>
to do things during the day with extra kids.  Sure, you could food <br/>
shop when the day care kids are gone, but if you wanted to go on a <br/>
field trip or even to a doctor&#39;s appt, you&#39;d have to take all the <br/>
kids with you.  <br/>
<br/>
One positive thing that I did when I did home day care was I worked <br/>
for a day care center, rather than independently.  That gave me the <br/>
freedom to take a day off because the center would find the parents <br/>
a replacement home for that day.  If you work independently, your <br/>
parents lose care when you can&#39;t work.  Another reason I liked <br/>
working for the center was that I never had to worry about getting <br/>
paid.  I was paid a paycheck by the center weekly whether or not the <br/>
parents paid on time.  Another benefit of working for the center was <br/>
that they provided me with any equipment that I needed such as high <br/>
chairs or playpens.  Still another benefit of working with a center <br/>
is that if you don&#39;t mesh with a certain child, you can tell them <br/>
and they will remove the child and give you another one.  I had a <br/>
child who cried all day long in my house, but they put her with an <br/>
older woman who had no other kids in the house and the little girl <br/>
was so happy.  She needed the quiet 1:1 which I couldn&#39;t give her.  <br/>
On the other hand I was a replacement for a boy who cried all day at <br/>
his regular day care home and he never cried at my house except for <br/>
the first hour of the first day.    <br/>
<br/>
Having a home day care is a big commitment.  It&#39;s not like working <br/>
at Burger King where if you quit they replace you the next day and <br/>
no one notices.  With day care kids, they become attached to you and <br/>
your house as if you are one of their family members.  If you quit <br/>
and they have to go to a new home, you confuse them.<br/>

I tried this for a couple of months.  Brought in a 4 year old and 9 <br/>
year old who were supposed to be daycare/unschooling with us.  They <br/>
used to be great friends with my youngest who was 7 at the time.  <br/>
They ended up all being mortal enemies.. it&#39;s been almost a year and <br/>
my son still has negative feelings about them.  We haven&#39;t seen them <br/>
since.  :(  I guess he felt overwhelmed by the extra kids on a full <br/>
time basis... my girls weren&#39;t thrilled but handled it better as <br/>
they were teens.  So for us, it was just too much pressure and did <br/>
take away a lot of my time from my own kids.  Perhaps it&#39;s just me.  <br/>
I know people who juggle a lot more kids than that.  Guess it <br/>
depends on the kids and the adults involved.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313793413">&lt;&lt;How do others handle working a home business or working outside the <br/>
home and unschooling their kids? &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One thing great about unschooling is that we don&#39;t have set bedtimes ( well, we never did really!). So, a lot of our time together, esp if I have been gone during the day, is at night. Like last night, one son wanted to start watching a video series on WWII. So we watched one segment of that and talked together ( eating dinner on our laps in the sitting room). Several other wanted to play the board game Stop Press ( a newsppaer headlines game). So that was next on the agenda. Around 10 o clock the 8 year old started getting tired and made his way to bed. <br/>
<br/>
I just watned to point out that , if you are working and unschooling, make the most of all time together, incidental time and hanging out together - and this is especially do-able if the kids go to bed when tired and not at an enforced early time.<br/>
<br/>
Evenings tend to be a great time for our famly to connect and for the kids to talk and ask about things....Leonie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299412945">I&#39;ve done home daycare and it was okay but I&#39;ve found that doing some <br/>
type of class or activity brings in much more money for the time <br/>
spent &quot;working&quot;.  I&#39;ve had a Waldorf playgroup, foreign language <br/>
classes (was our sole income while dh was in law school), after-<br/>
school care (more kids for a shorter amount of time).<br/>
<br/>
Now  have a homeschool mother&#39;s day out that been tremendously <br/>
successful and is simple.  The mother&#39;s day out runs from 9 am- 1 pm <br/>
on Tuesdays.  The kids play together and then we have a snack.  Most <br/>
of the money I get goes towards materials that I couldn&#39;t afford <br/>
otherwise such as quality art supplies.  <br/>
<br/>
I have 6 kids and charge around $50 month.  Everyone continues to <br/>
come back and I now have waiting list but can only do one day a <br/>
week.  Even if you did it every week day with 5 different groups, <br/>
you&#39;ll only have to work 4 hours a day instead of 10 or more.<br/>
<br/>
My next endeavor, as soon I get enough experience, will be dog <br/>
training classes for kids.  There is no one in this city of 4 million <br/>
that will work with kids and their dogs.  Everyone, including where I <br/>
work, requires the adult to handle the dog.  My daughter has even <br/>
come up with a name- Pup Scouts. <br/>

I had a home day care in my house and with my kids.  The centers <br/>
where I live only take kids 2yrs+9mos and older and they must be <br/>
potty trained.  The kids age newborn to 2yrs+8mos, and some up to 4 <br/>
years old or not potty trained go to a private home instead of the <br/>
center.  The center advertises, the parents pay the center, the <br/>
center pays the private home.  The parents take the child to the <br/>
private home every day, never the center.  <br/>
<br/>
I was independent for a while before I worked for the center.  The <br/>
only advantage I can see to being independent is that you can charge <br/>
what you want, but if a parent ever doesn&#39;t pay or consistently pays <br/>
late, you are the one who loses.  A center pays a per diem rate <br/>
based on full day or half day but you get paid every Friday no <br/>
matter what.  The other good thing about this arrangement is that <br/>
welfare vouchers pay much less than the center&#39;s daily rate but the <br/>
center will still pay you the same rate.  Most people on welfare <br/>
choose home day care through day care centers because many <br/>
independent home day cares won&#39;t accept them.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is just something that happens where I live.  Check it <br/>
out where you live if it sounds interesting to you.  <br/>

with scarlet fever) or something, I do a make up during the weeks <br/>
off.  <br/>
<br/>
All money is paid up front so that I can buy supplies and make large <br/>
purchases.  I bought an Easy Set pool and all the chemicals and toys <br/>
for it with the summer money and we spend 3 of the 4 hours in it <br/>
every MDO.  The kids go home happy and exhauted and I get plenty of <br/>
exercise.<br/>
<br/>
This summer my sessions are only a month long because so many people <br/>
have other commitments.  It&#39;s worked out nicely and allowed new <br/>
people to join us while some of the regulars are away.  All the money <br/>
for the summer, no matter how many months they will be attending, is <br/>
still paid up front.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how fun this has been for me.  I&#39;ve got a nice group <br/>
of kids and we have *so* much fun.  There&#39;s a mixture of unschooling <br/>
and homeschooling kids (ages 4-10) and it&#39;s been great to see the <br/>
homeschoolers relax and open up in an unschooling environment. I&#39;d do <br/>
it more than once a week if I hadn&#39;t already started working at the <br/>
dog place- another job I love so much I can&#39;t believe they pay me for <br/>
working there.<br/>

&gt; One thing great about unschooling is that we don&#39;t have set bedtimes ( well, we never <br/>

night. <br/>
<br/>
Great advice! We&#39;ve been experiencing something similar (especially in summer). My kids <br/>
sort of slow down and become more &quot;cozy&quot; with us around 9 or 10. We&#39;ve been staying up <br/>
playing &quot;spoons&quot; or cutting out pictures and gluing them in books or watching movies or <br/>
playing board games.<br/>
<br/>
My husband remarked one night that he couldn&#39;t believe the level of quiet concentration at <br/>
our kitchen table at 11:30 pm! (We had all five kids ranging from 17-7 gathered in one <br/>
room either on IM, playing X box or sitting at the table clipping words from amgazines <br/>
and catalogs and gluing them to little cards. (We then take these and label stuff weirdly in <br/>
our house... it&#39;s a word play game and my kids love it. I use it in my writing life.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Like last night, one son wanted to start watching a video series on WWII. So we watched <br/>
 </span></blockquote>one segment of that and talked together ( eating dinner on our laps in the sitting room). <br/>
Several other wanted to play the board game Stop Press ( a newsppaer headlines game). So <br/>
that was next on the agenda. Around 10 o clock the 8 year old started getting tired and <br/>
made his way to bed. <br/>
<br/>
Same here. They just say, &quot;I&#39;m done&quot; and we get them ready for bed or give a kiss.<br/>
<br/>
I love the evenings with them so I&#39;ve been using the mornings for my writing business.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237580453">I found this information online about the exemptions to the CA <br/>
licensing law:<br/>
<br/>
*Informal child care arrangements such as co-ops, shares, exchanges, <br/>
and *playgroups* where no money changes hands *for care*. [emphasis <br/>
mine]<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps people in CA could charge &quot;materials fee&quot; covering snack, art <br/>
supplies, toys, electricity etc. :-)  Other than that, it looks like <br/>
CA regulates the care of all children who are not with their <br/>
relatives or in their home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523215625">You can do it in California for one day per week, 4 hours per day <br/>
without becoming subject to licensing.<br/>
<br/>
There may be other ways to avoid licensing requirements, I just happen <br/>
to know about those.<br/>
<br/>
It is a good idea, Holly - I might consider that one, myself! I like <br/>
kids - it&#39;d be fun to have a group over all morning or all afternoon, <br/>
once a week.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-788181404">But the law specifially states charging money for the care.  That&#39;s <br/>
why I brought up the &quot;materials fee&quot;.  :-)<br/>

It just annoys me that something this fun and innocent, something <br/>

put it in the same catagory of homeschool regulation.  BLECH!<br/>
