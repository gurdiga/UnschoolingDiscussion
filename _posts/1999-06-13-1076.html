<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569801569">I&#39;m afraid that most folks think it is GOOD for their kids and HEALTHY to<br/>
force them to learn things that they don&#39;t want to.  When I first told my<br/>
mother about Unschooling she said, &quot;But, what about making them learn the<br/>
things that they need to learn but don&#39;t want to?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Like what, mom?  I have yet to see someone who is a self motivated learner<br/>
reach adulthood without learning the tools they need to prosper.  On the<br/>
other hand, I know lots of folks who are the product of public school who<br/>
have given up.  They think they are stupid, or that it is too late for<br/>
them, or the have a phobia of a subject because of their unpleasant school<br/>
experiences.  My next door neighbor, the one who made it all the way<br/>
through the ps system in our town without being able to read or write says<br/>
it is too late for her, even though I pointed out how great it would be for<br/>
her to learn alongside her 6 year old, how bonding and fun it would be.<br/>
But....I&#39;m afraid she has been badly wounded by ps, rather than those on<br/>
this list who have decided to empower themselves for positive change.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Again it depends on what you mean by forced learning. I dont force &quot; school<br/>
work&quot;. but i do force helping around the house. he has chores adn things he<br/>
is responsible for. I try to keep them at his level but sometimes he has to<br/>
learn how to do something he doesnt know or doesnt want to. this isnt a<br/>
choice. he is a member of this family and expected to share in its daily<br/>
living.<br/>
<br/>
i tend to think you are talking math and stuff. it is easy not force that<br/>
there cus there are so many things out there that he asks about and he<br/>
needs to learn to do them. he learned about moeny by getting an allowence<br/>
and figuring out how to spend it.<br/>

<br/>
My mother-in-law (years ago, before she gave up) said I needed to frustrate <br/>
my kids.  That if Ididn&#39;t purposely frustrate them that they would grow up <br/>
totally unable to deal with frustration.  <br/>
<br/>
She said this when I had babies, toddlers.  <br/>
<br/>
The longer I&#39;ve known her the more sadistic she seems.  It&#39;s scary.  I just <br/>
don&#39;t have the urge to see a happy person and inflict unhappiness, looking at <br/>
their eyes to make sure it took.  Yuck!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-574671877">Maybe I just have an appalling lack of fear of that older generation, but I<br/>
would have calmly informed then that I do not appreciate that type of<br/>
disrespect toward my lifestlye or beliefs in my home.  Much the same way I<br/>
let guests know that we do not smoke in our home, do not appreciate racial<br/>
or other types of slurs and derogatory language.  It is unacceptable for<br/>
anyone, especially family, to be so insulting and belittling, in front of<br/>
the kids or NOT.  If you wouldn&#39;t take it from a friend or stranger, you<br/>
shouldn&#39;t take it from them either.  I believe that I am my children&#39;s<br/>
example in how to stand up for what they believe in, and I won&#39;t back down<br/>
for anyone.  I also believe in the art of manners, and that those who are<br/>
respectful of you deserve your respect, but if they are rude and insulting,<br/>
they deserve some censure.<br/>

     That sounds so much like my parents, that it is scary!  (Do you think <br/>
they are clones? &lt;g&gt;)  My parents have made comments like this for 3 years.  <br/>
Finally we have tried talking to them in private, but that didn&#39;t do any good <br/>
either.  We told them that it was harmful for the kids to hear them put me <br/>
(and their dad) down about our decisions in child rearing, and that we <br/>
wouldn&#39;t allow them to do it anymore.  Then when they did it again, we <br/>
started having less visits with them.  They don&#39;t like it, but they are <br/>
getting the picture, that we mean what we say.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-958514997">I am hopeful that they will come to understand our decision. It may be<br/>
easier once we have made it through our first year without school. My mom<br/>
is more willing to think about new concepts, especially after discussions<br/>

with &quot;discipline&quot; which he sees as lacking in our house; he thinks my son<br/>
needs school for &quot;discipline&quot; (ie: some adult making him do something.) But<br/>
you know the old saying &quot;you can lead a horse to water but you can&#39;t make<br/>
him drink.&quot;  I guess you could change that and say &quot;you can lead a child to<br/>
school but you can&#39;t make him think.&quot;  LOL  (Maybe I could use that the<br/>
next time they question me.)<br/>

     It sounds as if your mom is trying to understand.  I hope that she is <br/>
listening to you and is willing to have an open mind.  As far as the way your <br/>
dad feels, well I have learned that alot of people feel that way.  I have had <br/>
comments made to me quite often, that the kids need to go to school, so that <br/>
they learn to do things they don&#39;t like to do!  I also hear comments about <br/>
&quot;Well, we survived it, so will they&quot;.  I don&#39;t know why people think our kids <br/>
should be made to &quot;do something&quot; they don&#39;t like to do.  We sure wouldn&#39;t <br/>
like someone making us do that.  And since I usually get the excuse of it <br/>
preparing them for a lifetime of work that they don&#39;t like to do, but they <br/>
must do to feed the family?-----well I am hoping that all of my kids, find <br/>
out what they love to do and make a career out of that.  I think that alot of <br/>
us have had jobs we don&#39;t like, just because we were told the same thing when <br/>
we were kids.  I for one, think it is time to change that!<br/>
