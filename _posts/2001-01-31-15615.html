<br/>
Now here is a topic for discussion!  I was raised in a fairly traditional<br/>
way - even though my mom worked out of the home, she and I still did all<br/>
the &quot;housework&quot; while my three brothers did the &quot;yard work&quot;.  In high<br/>
school, my sports participation was drill team.  My brothers wrestled,<br/>
ran track, and climbed mountains.  Now I have only daughters.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
care less about sports, although I do humor dh by trying to at least be<br/>
aware of which sport is in season.  Besides the sports, because I&#39;m SAHM<br/>
while dh works out, I end up doing all the housework!  My dh&#39;s mom was<br/>
the one who was out in the yard throwing a baseball with him and sitting<br/>
in the stands watching all his games, so he believes it is the mother&#39;s<br/>
job to be the sports coach too.  Children&#39;s soccer is HUGE here and he&#39;s<br/>
been pressuring me to get dd into a soccer league.  I&#39;m not anti-soccer,<br/>
but not thrilled about the idea of being a soccer mom, and dd hasn&#39;t been<br/>
begging to do it anyway.  I keep telling dh that if he wants her to play<br/>
soccer he should make it happen - sign her up, get her to practice, kick<br/>
the ball around the yard with her, etc.  Of course, practices are in the<br/>
afternoon while he&#39;s still at work.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I would like to raise my daughters to be physically active.  How<br/>
can I break this pattern?  I like to walk and hike, so as far as<br/>
modeling, that is about my limit!  Any ideas?<br/>

<br>They are physically active -- they never stop moving. &nbsp;I&#39;m not as active as I 
<br>could be but oh well. &nbsp;That&#39;s me. &nbsp;Not training for the Olympics. &nbsp;But I do 
<br>take the kiddos on bike rides and walks and to the park and the beach and 
<br>they are outside a lot -- just nothing too organized. &nbsp;Execpt my son goes to 
<br>Tae Kwon Do about 3 times a week. &nbsp;Maybe your daughter would enjoy that. &nbsp;
<br>There are more than a few girls at my son&#39;s school and they do wonderfully.

Sounds like your dh should sign HIMSELF up to play.<br/>
Seems like alot of parents are going for the<br/>
gratification it gives THEM, not the kids when they<br/>
play sports. <br/>
If your dd really wants to play, both dh and you<br/>
should be involved, to show dd that sports arent just<br/>
Dad&#39;s deal. <br/>
Yes, the SAHM does most , if not all of the housework.<br/>
Its our job. We&#39;re home, being a homemaker. So we make<br/>
our home wonderful.(whatever that means to you) Dh<br/>
works at his job. I wont be going in to do his job and<br/>
I dont expect him to do mine. We are, however,<br/>
partners in raising our boys, and we share equally in<br/>
that. I cant play hockey as well, but I can cheer and<br/>
be there as often. Even though its so darn cold at the<br/>
ice rink, I&#39;m there very Saturday and Sunday morning<br/>
at the crack of dawn.<br/>
I think women have been made to feel useless because<br/>
we do housework. Women&#39;s liberation made us all think<br/>
that our work didnt count unless we were paid for it.<br/>
That bull destroyed women as a whole. We are FULL of<br/>
worth whether we pull a paycheck or a wagon full or<br/>
kids. <br/>
