<div id="ygrps-yiv-124161354">Hi ho,<br/>
  I&#39;m in the middle of a discussion with my fiance about homeschooling.  His <br/>
argument is that every kid needs a test so that later on in life when they <br/>
take a test they won&#39;t freak.  <br/>
  My side is that I don&#39;t like the CTBS type tests anyway.  I&#39;ve seen how the <br/>
kids do on it at school anway, bored, mark bubbles to make pictures and never <br/>
have I had a kid do well on them anyway.  I don&#39;t think it will show me a <br/>
thing. <br/>
  His side, how do you know he&#39;s improving then?<br/>
  Me, I see it!  If I didn&#39;t see it doing any good then I would be the first <br/>
to put him back in public school.<br/>
  Him:  How do you know what he needs to be learning right now for his age?<br/>
  Me.... where the heck do I begin here?  lol   I couldn&#39;t tell him.  Instead <br/>
I gave him a couple of books to read.  <br/>
  He is not against homeschooling.  He has been supportive of me.  Of course <br/>
his son is not the one being homeschooled right now.  I would like to bring <br/>
our 6 yr old to homeschooling next year and this is where he becomes hesitant <br/>
because of this testing issue.  I&#39;ve told him that because our 6 yr old will <br/>
be home with the 9 & 10 yr old he&#39;ll actually surpass what he&#39;s doing in <br/>
school because of being around the older kids.  <br/>
  Anyway, I&#39;d sure appreciate some advice on how to handle this or I&#39;d like <br/>
to hear others stories about testing or not testing their kids.  If the kids <br/>
are not subjected to tests do they do ok on them later in life?    Thanks <br/>
bunches and bunches.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193409797">I could be way off base here, but why would the kids neccessarily have to<br/>
take tests later in life? Many colleges don&#39;t even require SAT&#39;s any more.<br/>
You could also take the &quot;We&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to it&quot; route.<br/>
There are plenty of test prep courses and books out there, that you could<br/>
use on an as needed basis. Also you are right about the theory that the<br/>
younger kids will learn from the older ones. I see it every day. Good Luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-704595966">Well, a couple of thoughts here.  Since most tests are multiple guess<br/>
anyway, it doesn&#39;t take a great deal of skill to take them if one is not<br/>
preconditioned with the test phobia that ps engenders.  Most kids fail<br/>
tests because they continually hear how hard the test is going to be, blah,<br/>
blah, blah.<br/>
<br/>
The ps system has created the &quot;needs to know at x age&quot; and that is one of<br/>
the biggest stumbling blocks to a child learning anything in the system. <br/>
They have forgotten that each child is an individual and as such has a need<br/>
to know, not at any given age, but on an individual basis.  Some are early<br/>
readers, some are whizzes with math from the get go, some are born with an<br/>
urge to create beauty.  It has nothing to do with age.  Once one discards<br/>
this notion it is much easier and the kidlet is happier, for them to<br/>
actually absorb the things they know instead of creating a surface veneer<br/>
which dissolves and fades with age.<br/>
