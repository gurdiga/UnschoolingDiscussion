<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527906068">We have been unschooling our gifted 9 year old daughter for about a <br/>
year.  I love and embrace unschooling!  It clicked with me/us, and <br/>
there&#39;s no looking back to the &quot;school at home&quot; we used to do.  My <br/>
daughter has the freedom to learn what she wants, when she wants - or <br/>
to play playstation all day if she chooses!  What a wonderful <br/>
freedom!   (I say she is &quot;gifted&quot;, because of the assessment tests <br/>
she did prior to our unschooling.  She excels in whatever she <br/>
chooses.)<br/>
<br/>
My question is this.  I have always asked that she brush her teeth, <br/>
get dressed,  and make her bed in the morning.  After she completes <br/>
those responsibilities, she is free to do whatever she chooses, from <br/>
playing her violin, reading, watching tv, playing outside - the <br/>
choice is hers.  This doesn&#39;t seem unreasonable to me.  I have been <br/>
reading many postings here, and am wondering if/how my &quot;requiring&quot; <br/>
her to do ANYTHING (chores, responsitilies etc) might have an effect <br/>
on unschooling.  I don&#39;t require academics, or &quot;education&quot;, but <br/>
simple, basic hygiene etc.  Literally, if I didn&#39;t &quot;make&quot; her brush <br/>
her teeth, she might not for a week.  (yuck!)  She battles me about <br/>
these basic things!  I have tried numerous things to get these things <br/>
taken care of, but could use any suggestions you may have.  <br/>
<br/>
One more question, while I&#39;m at it.  How do you all deal with <br/>
disrespect?  Talking back, raising her voice to me, stomping, <br/>
slamming doors - she gets very frustrated when things don&#39;t go &quot;just <br/>
right&quot;.  Yesterday it was violin.  She was playing, and didn&#39;t get <br/>
the song perfect.  She started to get angry.  I suggested she put it <br/>
away for a bit, and take it out later for a fresh start.  She slammed <br/>
down the bow, knocked over her music stand in her huff, and slammed <br/>
her bedroom door.  I have repeatedly talked to her, to help her <br/>
understand that it doesn&#39;t have to and isn&#39;t going to be perfect <br/>
everytime, etc etc...  She puts the perfection thing on herself.  I <br/>
think it is because so many things come so easily for her, when she <br/>
struggles, she doesn&#39;t know how to deal with it, and blows up.  This <br/>
used to be a huge issue when we were doing &quot;school at home&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t healthy for any of us to endure her attitude, (I also have a <br/>
3 year old boy that is copying her behaviors), there should be <br/>
consequences for her actions.  When she gets angry because her game <br/>
isn&#39;t going well, she slams the playstation.  I take away her <br/>
playstation for the day - the punishment fits the crime.  But what <br/>
about general disrespect or attitude?  She pushing to see what the <br/>
limits are, that&#39;s for sure.  Sometimes I wonder if she thinks she <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to listen to me, because she thinks she&#39;s as smart as <br/>
me?  <br/>
<br/>
Anything thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.  I can&#39;t be <br/>
the only one going through this?  Thanks all!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535701475">Christine,  I have the same issues with my daughter and son.  I also grew up the same way.    For me, its helped to just let them vent, at the moment.  and then when they&#39;ve cooled down, we talk about it.  I tell them how I used to feel when I was learning things.<br/>
My kids love to talk with me about what I went through as a child,  especially when its things they are experiencing.<br/>
My parents never talked with me about it and I just had to deal with it on my own, hence, I think I really kept alot inside.  Never learned that most things in life take practice,  gee..<br/>
It seems like if we just take a little extra time and talk with them about it and do a little explaining (when they want to hear it) it really helps.<br/>
As far as chores,  we have also had those issues but I have also learned to just relax alot about that, not important enough to me to keep on them.  If they have a friend over I might suggest picking up and I&#39;ll help.  They can then play better, find things better,  and not lose things.  But I let them decide,  also with brushing teeth,  education about it is really  all I do.<br/>
For most of it I have to just relax, relax, relax!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104071772"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: &quot;luv2unskool&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cmr0523@...">cmr0523@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;My question is this. I have always asked that she brush her teeth,<br/>
get dressed, and make her bed in the morning&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well lucky for me, I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve run into any hygiene problems as I see <br/>
it with my kids. (so far!) My kids never get dressed unless we are actually <br/>
going out somewhere. My baby wears onesies to bed and the middle 2 wear long <br/>
t-shirts and the oldest sometimes nothing at all. (okay, she gets dressed!) <br/>
My kids go outside in the back and front like that. I don&#39;t see it as a big <br/>
deal. If we&#39;re having company, I ask that they put pants on. It usually <br/>
doesn&#39;t last. Once one of them goes to the bathroom, the shorts come off. I <br/>
sent my girlfriend a video tape of our family and we were all hysterical at <br/>
one scene of us all in the backyard releasing a bird we nursed back to <br/>
health. None of the kids had pants on and my oldest daughter&#39;s best friend <br/>
didn&#39;t either!!!! We&#39;re pretty relaxed here and luckily the people who visit <br/>
are okay with that. If they weren&#39;t, they can stay home!!! At least we have <br/>
something on!!!<br/>
<br/>
As far as making the beds, what&#39;s the big deal really? I make mine, none of <br/>
the kids do. The 3 younger ones really don&#39;t make such a mess when they <br/>
sleep so pulling up the comforter is fixing it. My oldest sleeps like she&#39;s <br/>
fighting with someone. If someone is coming over, her room is the first one <br/>
seen from the dining room, I close the door. It&#39;s her room. If she likes it <br/>
that way, okay. My sons room is a disaster at times, as long as I can get in <br/>
to dust and vacuum, I let him go. One can&#39;t possibly see his room unless you <br/>
go right into it. He&#39;ll go for weeks and all of a sudden it will be all <br/>
cleaned up. Of course it gets messed again, but what are kids rooms for???<br/>
<br/>
So I see dressing and bed making as nothing that &#39;needs&#39; to be done. As far <br/>
as the teeth brushing goes, I would try something to make sure it got done. <br/>
Maybe just educate her on what could happen if she stops brushing. Get <br/>
pictures.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;One more question, while I&#39;m at it.  How do you all deal with<br/>
disrespect?  Talking back, raising her voice to me, stomping,<br/>
slamming doors - she gets very frustrated when things don&#39;t go &quot;just<br/>
right&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well this is much more trickier. I&#39;m sure a lot of people here will give you <br/>
different advice on this one. With my younger ones, I haven&#39;t run into many <br/>
problems with this. They are 2, 6, and 7. When someone talks to someone else <br/>
in an unacceptable manner in this house, that person is taken aside and <br/>
talked to as to why they did it, how they felt or feel now and so on. It&#39;s <br/>
discussed, but at the same time, they are told that it is not acceptable to <br/>
us all. No TV gets taken away or video games or anything like that. I can <br/>
honestly say my younger 3 have not been punished. We discuss and try to talk <br/>
about the why&#39;s and if we get no where at the time, we try again at a later <br/>
date. Never more than a day later.<br/>
<br/>
Now my oldest is a different story. She has always been in school so her <br/>
upbringing is totally different than the other 3. She&#39;s 16 now and <br/>
absolutely fantastic first of all!! When she was 10-13, it was getting <br/>
tough. She was punished. We tried taking away everything from the radio to <br/>
her allowance. It never made the slightest difference to her. The only thing <br/>
that got to her, was not being allowed to go out with her friends. She was <br/>
grounded for one night and if that didn&#39;t work it would be 2 nights. It <br/>
never got past two nights and we only had to do it maybe 3 times at the <br/>
most. She had an incredible temper and she was taught to go outside and <br/>
scream or to her room and punch or throw pillows. That helped her. Talking <br/>
to her at these moments was a big no no. It had to wait until she calmed <br/>
down. Sometimes that was quite awhile. She was also a big door slammer. It <br/>
was very annoying and with 2 little kids in the house too, not a good thing. <br/>
We finally told her that we would take the door off it&#39;s hinges if she did <br/>
it again. Gave her other ways she could get out her anger and the doors <br/>
stopped slamming.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am in no way saying these were right things and even that I would go <br/>
about doing it all like that again. There are many things I would try <br/>
differently if those problems came up with any of the other 3 kids. I think <br/>
taking a breath, choosing your battles wisely, (like bed fixing and dressing <br/>
as opposed to teeth brushing and mouthing off) and talking and talking and <br/>
talking to your child is the best way to go. Respect them like you would <br/>
want someone to respect you. I know they aren&#39;t thinking like an adult, but <br/>
I am amazed at how far you can get by reasoning with a child. I am learning <br/>
every day how to handle situations with my children. And there is an awful <br/>
lot of very good advice here to be found. It just takes time and trust and a <br/>
lot of patience!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
<br/>

***Literally, if I didn&#39;t &quot;make&quot; her brush <br/>

<br/>
Maybe not. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
You probably never did that experiment. <br/>
 <br/>
What I told Dylan about personal hygiene was that it was partly for our<br/>
health and partly a kindness to others.  That people we knew probably<br/>
enjoyed talking to us more if we didn&#39;t smell bad and have bad breath.  I<br/>
told him it was a common courtesy to brush our teeth before we were going<br/>
to be close to or talking to others.  <br/>
Children&#39;s sinuses sometimes develop later and so can their sense of<br/>
smell.  They might not notice daddy&#39;s breath smells like a litter pan in<br/>
the morning and so, make no association about their own.  <br/>
I think you can ease up on this because at nine she really is going to<br/>
notice the difference between a clean mouth and a not clean one.  <br/>
<br/>
*** She battles me about <br/>
these basic things!  I have tried numerous things to get these things <br/>
taken care of, but could use any suggestions you may have. ***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d stop worrying about the getting dressed and making the bed.  Those<br/>
things wont affect her health or happiness.  Her unmade bed won&#39;t hurt<br/>
anyone.  <br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;ve had really good advice from other people here, about all of this,<br/>
and I guess I don&#39;t need to repeat what they already said. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
