 </span></blockquote>I pretty much agree with this but........I know there are a lot of <br/>
preschoolers out there who will refuse to eat much of anything besides <br/>
peanut butter sandwiches.  It would probably be easy to convince an older <br/>
child that their choice of food could be dangerous to another child, but it <br/>
would be hard with a preschooler.  All the more reason to not send them to <br/>
daycare.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545369384">I agree with that, Kathryn.  When the kidlets were little I heard the mil<br/>
from h*ll carping &quot;what are you doing, running a cafeteria.&quot;  Eldest kidlet<br/>
only liked (gag warning &lt;g&gt;) over cooked pasta with ketsup on it, chicken<br/>
and weird things like heart and brussel sprouts.  Eldest son wanted exotic<br/>
foods like smoked oysters, sardines, anchovies and all types of sea foods.<br/>
Of course, it couldn&#39;t be simple.  Eldest kidlet absolutely refused to eat<br/>
any fish and eldest son would not under any circumstances eat chicken.  Then<br/>
along comes son #2.  As a tiny tot he liked things like mushroom soup and<br/>
capers.  Then along comes son #3.   He was a blue baby and for two years had<br/>
colic and sleep apnea.  One day a food would be o.k. and the next he would<br/>
be violently ill.<br/>
<br/>
So, I ran a &quot;cafeteria&quot; until they were old enough to do their own cooking.<br/>
Big deal, unlike Peg, I can use all four burners at once &lt;g&gt;  Thank goodness<br/>
the last two were not as fussy.  Well, unless you count that youngest has to<br/>
read every single solitary label and if it has something she doesn&#39;t know or<br/>
sounds like a chemical in the list of ingredients then it is not allowed in<br/>
the basket!<br/>
<br/>
We have vegan friends and the kidlets help plan and prepare the meals when<br/>
they visit.  They understand and have no problem eating someone else&#39;s way<br/>
when they visit.  They don&#39;t consider that forced choices, just doing<br/>
something for someone they like.<br/>
<br/>
Youngest kidlet (9 yo) is a peanut butter &quot;nut.&quot;  I mean, she&#39;d have peanut<br/>
butter for breakfast, lunch and dinner if we weren&#39;t having other things she<br/>
liked as well!  I asked her what she thought about the whole peanut allergy<br/>
discussion and whether it would bother her to not take a pb&h sandwich to<br/>
the park and she gave me one of those &quot;that&#39;s a dumb question&quot; looks and<br/>
said &quot;of course not, why.&quot;  A little later she came in with a really sad<br/>
look and said &quot;Does that mean there are people who care about a dumb<br/>
sandwich more than a little kid?&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If they chose to marry Jessie or Mark, or to be roommates, then it&#39;s love, <br/>
caring and respect.  If they go to a school because of compulsory attendance <br/>
laws and happen to be in the same district, that&#39;s not quite the same <br/>
situation.  Maybe another child only will eat peanut butter for lunch and <br/>
really wants it, or is hypoglycemic and vegetarian and peanuts are a staple.<br/>
<br/>
Making the 400 (or however many) kids feel guilty for the medical problems of <br/>
the two doesn&#39;t seem equitable to me.<br/>
