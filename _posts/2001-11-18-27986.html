<br/>
&gt; Thanksgiving is coming.  And while I love most of my relatives, there is<br/>
&gt; always potential for the big &quot;we-think-you-shouldn&#39;t-homeschool&quot; fight at<br/>
&gt; any family gathering.  (Or long car trip with my brother.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t take criticism really well -- especially the heavy-handed kind that<br/>
&gt; starts with &quot;your are ruining this child!!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anybody got any happy thoughts for rising above this or just slogging<br/>
&gt; through?  I&#39;m going to three and a half family gatherings over the long<br/>
&gt; weekend, and it&#39;s really more than I can sail through serenely.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Humor always works for me, and village-idiot-smiling-agreement.<br/>
<br/>
Relative: You&#39;re ruining this child! What were you thinking to start<br/>
HOMESCHOOLING?!<br/>
<br/>
Me (grinning like a loon): You&#39;re right, I&#39;m such a moron. I&#39;m not fit to<br/>
raise a chicken. I should put the kids up for adoption immediately. I should<br/>
be deported back to the planet I came from. Is there a school someplace near<br/>
here? Pull over so I can enroll them.<br/>
<br/>
Etc.<br/>
<br/>
They can only argue if you do. I try not to waste energy on people looking<br/>
to scuffle -- sincere interest, no problem, I&#39;ll talk about homeschooling<br/>
all day even if they disagree with me in the end. But looking for trouble,<br/>
they can look somewhere else because I turn into Pam, Grinning Chimp. Let<br/>
&#39;em try to fight with that. :)<br/>

&quot;You can&#39;t raise them that way!&quot;<br/>
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br/>

&quot;What are you thinking of, doing such a dumb thing?!&quot;<br/>
&quot;Oh, really? Thank you.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Excellent -- if these nitwits (and I have relatives too who I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
discuss the time of day with) don&#39;t get you any better than this, they aren&#39;t <br/>
going to get a lengthy, heartfelt explanation -- so I like the &quot;Thank you&quot; <br/>
method.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

Nance (going to a restaurant for Turkey day because we all finally said &quot;Ack <br/>
-- I&#39;m not doing this anymore.&quot;  I&#39;m very proud of all of us!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-789394022">We&#39;re going to a restaurant, too for Turkey Day, but I&#39;d much rather eat at home.<br/>
Still, MIL is coming, and when we&#39;re with her, we eat out.<br/>
