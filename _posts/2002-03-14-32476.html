<div id="ygrps-yiv-654623135">My girls never went to school (I try to forget that<br/>
three days of torture when we tried third grade),<br/>
although the first one did attend community college<br/>
for two years.  When she was small I was an apartment<br/>
manager and also did childcare and tutoring.  When the<br/>
second one was six, the first one (age 16 then) and I<br/>
began working outside the home.  We worked opposite<br/>
shifts in order to take turns being with the younger<br/>
one.  We&#39;re doing that again now, after four years of<br/>
living thirty miles apart.  During the time of<br/>
relative separation from the older girl, the younger<br/>
one spent some days with her and some days with<br/>
various neighbors.  Most of the neighbors were people<br/>
I could exchange chores, errands, and favors with<br/>
instead of paying.  Some were just older people who<br/>
loved having my daughter around for the day once in a<br/>
while.  I preferred not to depend on a paid parental<br/>
substitute.  I&#39;ve worked full-time since the younger<br/>
one was six.  Now she&#39;s thirteen.  She has reading and<br/>
projects to work on while I&#39;m at work, and I spend my<br/>
off hours and days with her.  We work on whatever<br/>
questions or interests are on her mind, I take her to<br/>
classes and activities in the community.  This past<br/>
year I&#39;ve worked about five miles from home.  Before<br/>
that, I was never more than a five-minute walk.  The<br/>
year the little gal was six I worked across the<br/>
street.  I always went home for lunch and called<br/>
during breaks, and always made it clear to co-workers<br/>
that I must be paged for calls from my kids because<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t be calling if it weren&#39;t important.  I<br/>
was much less interested in doing work I liked than in<br/>
being close by and available to my kids.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m only responsible for one childhood per daughter<br/>
and I intend to make it the best possible.  Giving<br/>
them my self is better than anything else I can offer.<br/>
I know everyone&#39;s situation is unique, and each one&#39;s<br/>
tolerances are different.  I offer this story as a<br/>
sample.    <br/>
