<div id="ygrps-yiv-90343791">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning out the house,  and have some extra games,  Trivial Pursuit Young<br/>
Players and and Genus 3, Trivial Pursuit bought in 1998, and Boggle.  We<br/>
really don&#39;t use them,  wonder if anyone wants them for 20 dollars plus<br/>
shipping.  They have all pieces, I believe, and a little dings on the<br/>
corners of the boxes, but other than that, a really great deal.  I think<br/>
genus 3 alone is 30 in the store..<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested,  first one to email gets it,  <br/>
<br/>
Um Muhammad<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>
<br/>

stuff you get at Toys R Us stateside.<br/>

Loved your descriptions of some of your fun games.  We like chess and<br/>
monopoly here, but some our yours sounded liked they&#39;d be good additions to<br/>
the collection.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when you&#39;re not in a wheelchair or your kids are feeling like<br/>
running upstairs to check names, can we get the names for those games?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Scotland Yard.  Logic, not for really young kids.  Ravensburger and Milton <br/>
Bradley have both published it.</div>
