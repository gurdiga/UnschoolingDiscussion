<div id="ygrps-yiv-268619709">I almost fell off my chair once, scrolling through a long digest that made me dizzy.  I don&#39;t like them!<br/>
<br/>
I also use Outlook Express.  Each one of my lists goes directly into its own folder.  With a click, I can rearrange them by sender, date received, or subject.  Makes it very easy to delete or read certain ones!<br/>
<br/>
I would never go back to digest.<br/>
<br/>
I am also here for conversation as well as information.  My local homeschool list is so quiet most of the time, and has some great folks but is not an unschooling list or even close to it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being here!<br/>

This is the way mine is set up also.  I like having them separated into<br/>
their own folders.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044148891">I&#39;m sorry that the occasional re: Digest #92345758 is so annoying.  I know<br/>
that I do that occasionally, but I&#39;ve worked hard to eliminate it.  Other<br/>
people must be trying, too, because it seems from my vantage point that<br/>
there are less of them these days.<br/>
<br/>
There are things that annoy digest users, too, like people who don&#39;t cut the<br/>
miles and miles of garbage from the end of their posts.  I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t<br/>
even notice it on individual emails, but it all has to be scanned past on<br/>
digest.  So I don&#39;t feel too badly when the occasional post sneaks past with<br/>
an uncorrected subject line.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s easier for some folks isn&#39;t necessarily easier for everybody.  There<br/>
are some of us for whom digests work better than individual emails.  If<br/>
there weren&#39;t any yahoo digests, I wouldn&#39;t be here.  Maybe you all wouldn&#39;t<br/>
miss me, but I&#39;d miss you.<br/>
