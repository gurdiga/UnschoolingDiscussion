<div id="ygrps-yiv-946224443">Hi ~<br/>
   As I &quot;new&quot; unschooler, I have let go of many rules I used to have..ie.TV, <br/>
video games, bedtimes ...and I must admit, there is more peace in our house. <br/>
  <br/>
   But recently, I struggle with bedtimes ...and I would love some input. My <br/>
children are 5 and 7.  ( we have a 16 and 22 yr old at home too).<br/>
  Bedtime seems to be getting later and later in this house. Kids become very <br/>
irritable and less patient with one another in the days that follow. Parents <br/>
end up getting a tad stressed &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
  <br/>
   I love my kids with all my heart but I really need and WANT some time <br/>
alone at night. I feel a tad selfish stating this, but it makes me more refreshed <br/>
to tackle the world again the next day....to be a better mom. But I also feel <br/>
that the kids shouldn&#39;t be made to go to bed when they are not at all sleepy. <br/>
  <br/>
   Last night &quot;I&quot; was exhausted...hubby was out plowing. I needed quiet time <br/>
and thought an early bedtime would do everybody good. Well, they seemed tired <br/>
and willing after a busy day in the snow...until the 7yr old actually looked <br/>
at the clock when he was already upstairs...hahaha. They ended up coloring and <br/>
cutting and pasting for another hour before they actually went to sleep. ( I <br/>
found this out this morning &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;).<br/>
   <br/>
   So I am thinking that I could have a set time (with flexibility of course) <br/>
for them to retire upstairs ...but then they can make the decision when to <br/>
actually get into bed to go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Please share your thoughts!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-319286568">Bedtimes are hard around here, too.  My dh is a early riser, going to work<br/>
early (5 a.m.) most days.  I am a night owl, as are most of the kids, most<br/>
of the time (my youngest goes in spurts with early bedtimes sometimes).<br/>
Right now, I am working out of the home 4 nights a week, until 1 a.m. ... so<br/>
the two youngest are going to bed with daddy at 9 p.m.  This means, they<br/>
wake up between 7:30 and 8:30, when I may not have been asleep for even 4<br/>
hours yet. This is becoming a real issue for us. We have a very small house<br/>
(and I do mean, very small!) so it is not like they can be somewhere while<br/>
one of us is sleeping and not disturbing us.  Honestly, I do prefer the kids<br/>
going to bed with Alex at night as I don&#39;t think he would be aware of<br/>
&quot;issues&quot; that may crop up while he was asleep ... I can hear changes in tone<br/>
of voice, squabbles, whatever while I am sleeping and can wake up enough to<br/>
help guide them.<br/>
<br/>
I know someone who had a first child who was a night owl and her second<br/>
child was up at 6 a.m. She ended up telling her oldest, you have to be in<br/>
your room by &lt;whatever time&gt; but you don&#39;t have to go to sleep ... you just<br/>
have to stay there.&quot;  He was 6 or 7 at the time. At the end of 30 days, he<br/>
got something he had been wanting for a while.  This met both of their needs<br/>
... she knew he wasn&#39;t wandering around the house at all hours of the night<br/>
so she could rest easier and sleep with the new baby and he got to still<br/>
stay up in his room, which was a safe place for him to be.<br/>
<br/>
I like your idea of stating an &quot;in your room&quot; time .... it just might work<br/>
out for all of you.  I like my quiet time at night ... and I will stay up<br/>
until 1 or 2 to get it, if I have to! :)  But, then if the kids wake up<br/>
early ... and I have to get up with them (I don&#39;t anymore but I used to have<br/>
to!) I would be grumpy.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago, one night I just declared, out of the blue, STORY<br/>
TIME! at 8 p.m. We turned the lights out around 8:30 ... all were asleep by<br/>
8:45 or 9.  It worked for awhile. :)<br/>

&lt;&lt;    So I am thinking that I could have a set time (with flexibility of <br/>

actually get into bed to go to sleep. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always done some version of that.  It&#39;s not so important that people <br/>
are asleep at the same time, but that once someone IS asleep the rest of them <br/>
get quiet enough that the sleeping can be maintained.   <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t always work.  With a seventeen year old and very LOUD fourteen <br/>
year old (who&#39;s been unnaturally big-voiced always) I&#39;ve probably gotten out of <br/>
bed 45 times and said &quot;BE QUIET, what are you thinking?&quot; or demonstrated once <br/>
again that if you turn a doorknob when you&#39;re closing a door it closes very <br/>
quietly but if you just shove it closed it&#39;s LOUD like a drum.  (I don&#39;t <br/>
demonstrate the loud like a drum part---someone else just has.)  45 times out of x <br/>
years times 365 nights isn&#39;t too many times, especially since some of those were <br/>
twice in the same night, and a couple of times it was three times and in those <br/>
cases it was &quot;That&#39;s it; get in the bed and be quiet.  You&#39;re not keeping <br/>
your deal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I went to bed crying way more than 45 times before I could <br/>
get old enough to be 14 or 17.  I&#39;d rather get up once in a while and make a <br/>
kid feel guilty than to ever argue and pressure, make rules, cause kids to sneak <br/>
back out of bed, etc., trying to enforce a bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
It works okay here, and the kids go through phases where they need to sleep <br/>
less or longer.  Kirby can (as I could at his age) function perfectly well on <br/>
six hours of sleep; on four or five  in a pinch.   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is basically what we do here (dd 6, dd almost 5, and ds 3). The girls <br/>
share a room, so sometimes I feel bad for my little guy. But, he&#39;s given up <br/>
his daytime nap and pretty much needs to fall asleep earlier.  If I had a <br/>
bigger house, I&#39;d probably set up a big room for them bunk style, gender be <br/>
damned. The times he&#39;s asked to sleep with the girls, we&#39;ve just said sure. <br/>
Usually, he ends up moving back into his room after an hour or so. He <br/>
really likes his space (weaned himself from the family bed at around 6.5 <br/>
months; I think it&#39;s dh&#39;s snoring! lol).<br/>
<br/>
We turned the girls&#39; closet into a reading loft, with a platform and <br/>
recessed lighting, so my oldest would be able to read after her sister was <br/>
asleep. There are full bookshelves in both rooms, along with some special, <br/>
more quiet, toys. And they are free to bring stuff to bed with them too.<br/>
<br/>
Dh gives them their bath and story and puts them to bed, but there are no <br/>
requirements after that. They like the bedtime ritual and the time they <br/>
spend with their father, so there would be no way out of that--even if we <br/>
told them they could be anywhere in the house, know what I mean? Once they <br/>
are in their rooms, they know it&#39;s mama&#39;s and papa&#39;s special time <br/>
together--time to reconnect as adults. This is something that we have <br/>
always done to nurture our marriage, which I feel is very important. We go <br/>
out maybe twice a year, so we have to carve out our connection time at home.<br/>
<br/>
Emily (the oldest) is often up until 10 or 11:00. If Sam (the youngest) <br/>
ended up falling asleep during the day, he&#39;ll be up until 11:00, too. <br/>
Sometimes they&#39;ll come into our bedroom and watch something on Discovery or <br/>
whatever. Most nights they&#39;re content to play in their rooms and check in <br/>
on us only periodically.<br/>
<br/>
This system has really worked wonderfully for all of us, and we&#39;ve never <br/>
had bed time issues. Like, never.<br/>

I do that here. Really only with Joseph though. Sierra will get tired and<br/>
ask to go to bed and Alyssa is always right behind her. The one time Alyssa<br/>
stayed up after Sierra went to bed, she lasted 5 minutes before she wanted<br/>
in there too. Go figure. Now Joseph will stay up all night. I need, for me,<br/>
a few hours to myself most nights. One would work but 2 is great. I love<br/>
staying up with Joseph when just he and I can spend time together. My<br/>
husband and I both do that with him because he&#39;s a night owl. But I can&#39;t do<br/>
it every night. So I make sure that Joseph does get time like that with Joe<br/>
and I and then ask for time for myself from him. He stays up, I just say<br/>
goodnight to him and he goes to sleep when he wants. Sometimes I ask for him<br/>
to stay in the playroom and sometimes it&#39;s the bedroom. Depends on the<br/>
degree of privacy we (or I) want. It works well with Joseph and us all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638839820">Around here, Sarah has a set time she goes to her room, but it&#39;s up to her if she wants to go to sleep then or not. Mostly it&#39;s because if she&#39;s up the Littles won&#39;t even THINK about going to sleep, tired or not. Megan is more likely of the two to end up asleep when she&#39;s tired. Logan has recently begun asking for me to lay down with him when he&#39;s tired and ready to sleep, or else he&#39;ll go and snuggle with Sarah. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always tended to be very informal with bedtimes. The only time we weren&#39;t was the year Sarah was in school, because she&#39;d have to be awakened so early to get ready...we ALL hated that year, and the forced bed/awaken times were a huge part of it for us. <br/>
