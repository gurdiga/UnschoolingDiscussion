<div id="ygrps-yiv-149102000">Hi. I posted a message about sleepaway camp a while back, but some glitch must <br/>
have occurred because it never showed up. <br/>
<br/>
My dd is only 8 months old, so obviously I have plenty of time to figure this out. I just <br/>
wanted to know what your opinions are on sleepaway camp, scouts, and other such <br/>
activities for unschooled kids. <br/>
<br/>
Is there a special camp for unschoolers? <br/>
<br/>
Is girl scouts an overtly christian organization? Because we are agnostic. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, <br/>
<br/>

p.s. I really wish I could participate more, but I just can&#39;t keep up with all of these <br/>
threads! I&#39;ve got my hands full with a very spirited almost crawler, which makes it <br/>
hard. I just wanted to say how awesome this group is, and how happy I am to be able <br/>
to read from time to time, even if it&#39;s hard to find time to join in. If everyone could <br/>
please make sure that when the topic changes, so does the heading, that would really <br/>
help me.</div>

Same for us with Boy Scouts.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a fine organization, but it just didn&#39;t &#39;fit&#39; us.  Way to box-like for our tastes.<br/>

*********************************<br/>
I don&#39;t think girlscouts is very Christian at all.  It&#39;s very inclusive, lots <br/>
of &quot;world&quot; type stuff (make the world a better place, get along with everyone <br/>
type stuff).  I was a leader for a while when my oldest (now 20) was in 1st <br/>
grade.  Not a bad organization, but I hated the whole cookie thing.  The troop <br/>
barely got anything...money went to the cookie company and girl scout <br/>
higher-ups.  I never felt that was right.  But they do have a lot of cool stuff to <br/>
earn badges.<br/>
<br/>
Boyscouts, on the other hand, is a very Christian organization.  At least the <br/>
pack our boys were in (for a whole 9 months) was.  I signed them up thinking <br/>
&quot;OK, 2 meetings per month, I can deal with that.&quot;  Ha ha ha ha ha.  THey all <br/>
have to be in different groups (by grade), so I was going at least twice a <br/>
WEEK...plus fund raisers, pancake breakfasts, community service work, <br/>
campouts,...it consumes your life!<br/>
<br/>
We have happily settled on 4H.  Our meetings are twice a month, all the kids <br/>
are in the same group (no division by grades), the camps are great, everything <br/>
is cheap, no uniforms to deal with, fundraisers are stuff like carwashes or <br/>
bake sales (our group is a dance group so we get paid for dancing at festivals <br/>
and such).  It is not just a farm club...there are probably around 200 <br/>
different projects to choose from...anything from small motors, to computers, to <br/>
animals, to cooking, to artwork.  Plus they can enter their projects in the local <br/>
fairs, everyone gets a ribbon...I can&#39;t say enough good about it.  We&#39;re <br/>
really happy with it.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing..when I was little we were in Campfire Girls.  (I believe it&#39;s <br/>
now Campfire Boys and Girls) and it has sort of the same outline as <br/>
girlscouts or boyscouts, but I think it&#39;s much more relaxed.  They are not all over the <br/>
country though, unfortunately. <br/>

They are not exactly ubiquitous, although being only 4 years old would<br/>
account for that. <br/>

In the last Life Learning magazine there was an ad for Earth Scouts.   <br/>

<br/>
This is another very new ecology based scouting type organization. I have no<br/>
personal experience with it, just passing on the 411. <br/>
<br/>
What about 4H instead of scouting? One of the mothers in my local group runs<br/>
a 4H chapter (terminology?). It seems like the activities are very top down<br/>
structured � which is great if that is what you want. So far Jayn definitely<br/>
likes to be in charge of her own time and activities. I guess each chapter<br/>
will have totally different activities, partly depending on locality (very<br/>
little animal husbandry in the urban group run locally) <br/>
<br/>
Thinking back to my own meager experience as a Girl Guide (in Australia) and<br/>
reading the �about us� links to some of these organizations, they are seem<br/>
all about �teaching principles�. They seem structured basically like a<br/>
classroom, albeit a liberal one, with leaders (teachers) and very much<br/>
directed discussions. Aren�t we already living/modeling the principles that<br/>
these folks want to instill but without the external rewards (badges) or<br/>
leader directed play? I feel like it will be redundant for Jayn.<br/>
<br/>
 One part of Spiral Scouts was talking about parents and children having the<br/>
opportunity to connect. I don�t think we have a need that they will fill<br/>
just now. As a learning resource for spiritual or ecological issues, I�m not<br/>
sure this kind of group would be our first �go to�. If there were no local<br/>
homeschool group for Jayn to meet new friends, then yes possibly. I suspect<br/>
that the personality of the various leaders would be key to the experience.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone want to read about my disastrous experience at Girl Guide camp? If so<br/>
read on:<br/>
<br/>
When I went to camp, in ancient canvas teepee shaped tents, at the age of<br/>
12, it was with many girls I had never seen before. Naturally I ended up in<br/>
the �screw-ups� group. After struggling for an extra long time to erect the<br/>
thing, we failed to dig a trench around our tent (who knew?) so when it<br/>
poured torrentially that afternoon much of our luggage got wet, and the<br/>
interior of our tent (no groundsheets provided) was muddy. We were supposed<br/>
to gather sticks to make all kinds of fabulous furniture pieces including<br/>
luggage racks, following the line drawings in our books, but ours were<br/>
rickety to be charitable. Neither I, nor my clueless mother, had any notion<br/>
of what was right to bring. I had regular bedding, not a sleeping bag, and<br/>
no air mattress � I think I was the only girl without an air mattress. Since<br/>
my bedding was on the ground it was totally soaked. I was absolutely<br/>
freezing that night, and boy was the ground hard. My mother insisted,<br/>
because of my age, that I take along a large package of (clearly marked)<br/>
kotex pads, just in case I started menses during the trip. Thank goodness<br/>
that at least was spared me. However I was teased unmercifully for having<br/>
the package � so much for camaraderie and kindness. Of course the steak<br/>
designated as mine was the one that fell on the ground � they didn�t tell me<br/>
that it had, until I was wondering aloud why it was gritty. We went on hikes<br/>
each day. I was fat and not athletic. It was tiring. I wanted to sit down.<br/>
Oh there�s a nice mound. I�ll sit there for a moment. Ants� nest. Red ants.<br/>
I want to go home. At least my bedding has dried, but the ground is still<br/>
hard. I vaguely remember competitive activities like scavenger hunts and<br/>
trail following, which my tent was not shining at. I think I was not good at<br/>
that stuff � bugs scared me. I also remember feeling better when I finally<br/>
had the chance to wash my hair in the river, then sitting on a log and<br/>
combing it. It was long and in good condition, and the sun was finally out.<br/>
I have never been camping since. One day my husband is going to take us � we<br/>
are going to have a really, really high quality tent with all the zips and<br/>
flaps, and aero beds � and bug repellant.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853081727"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Is girl scouts an overtly christian organization? Because we are agnostic.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been a Girl Scout leader for almost 3 years now.  I looked into a<br/>
variety of organizations before becoming a GS Leader, as my daughter really<br/>
wanted to be in a club of some type.  Really check out all your options.<br/>
There is Roots & Shoots, 4H, Camp Fire Boys & Girls, and many others.  My<br/>
daughter didn&#39;t like any except Girl Scouts, but several were nice (and you<br/>
can always change!).   We are involved in an all age homeschooling group,<br/>
plus we have lots of friends that we communicate with often.  Zoe never had<br/>
time to just be with a group of girls similar in age to herself and she<br/>
wanted this time with no boys (her choice, but it limited the club choices).<br/>
After trying out several troops, I quickly realized that the only way my<br/>
daughter could have the freedom that she needs was to become The main Leader<br/>
of her troop.  So, I did the training, and here we are.<br/>
<br/>
Our troop currently has 4 regular girls (all homeschoolers).  2 just dropped<br/>
out.  Our troop is very Unschooling friendly.  The girls plan the majority<br/>
of the meetings (the ones that they don&#39;t plan, they &quot;plan&quot; to have me<br/>
plan!), vote on outings (from a list of their collected ideas), really<br/>
everything.  We haven&#39;t done anything as a troop that they majority of the<br/>
girls didn&#39;t want to do (and it is always an option for each girl that<br/>
doesn&#39;t like something to not do it).  As the Leader, it is my<br/>
responsibility to gather supplies, etc. in order to make sure that they get<br/>
to do what they&#39;ve planned (e.g. gather paper and scissors if we are doing<br/>
origami).  There are certain things that really are more fun to do with a<br/>
group of kids, rather than alone.  We do those things.  We have meetings<br/>
every other week and usually two outings every month.<br/>
<br/>
I understand about not liking cookie selling.  The official word on cookies<br/>
is that you do NOT have to sell them.  You are encouraged to if you&#39;ve asked<br/>
for fee support (i.e. you couldn&#39;t afford to pay for the $10/year membership<br/>
fee).  And, even then, you&#39;ve officially sold cookies if you sell ONE box.<br/>
Even as a vegan (all the cookies are vegetarian, but none are vegan), my<br/>
daughter sells over 100 boxes to relatives and next door neighbors that come<br/>
to us looking for someone to buy cookies from.  They all know that Zoe is a<br/>
Girl Scout and they&#39;d rather buy from her than a cookie booth.<br/>
<br/>
As for religion, the Girl Scout organization is definitely NOT a Christian<br/>
organization.  This confuses a lot of people, because the word &quot;God&quot; is in<br/>
the Girl Scout Promise and the girls are to learn the Promise.  The official<br/>
stance (check out the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.girlscouts.org">http://www.girlscouts.org</a> for more details) is that<br/>
the girls can say any word in replacement of the word &quot;God&quot; that they<br/>
believe in.  There is one girl in our troop that says &quot;Nature&quot;, one that<br/>
says nothing, and the others say &quot;God&quot;.    There are, however, troops that<br/>
are religiously based, but they are their own thing.<br/>

+++++++++++++++<br/>
I didn&#39;t find Scouting Christian or particularly religious in any way, but <br/>
neither is it particularly unschooling-compatible, in *my* opinion. <br/>
++++++++++++++++<br/>
I share the same complaints as the others ~ I didn&#39;t like the *have tos* that <br/>
came with a troop (fundraising especially).  As a family, we have eradicated <br/>
the word TRY (gotta love Yoda!) but it appears in all of the GS propaganda, <br/>
ick!  *I* was the only member of my family to get a sick feeling from honoring <br/>
God and Country and the mandatory Pledge of Allegiance (if they actually <br/>
*talked about* what that pledge means and allowed kids the *choice* instead of rote <br/>
memorization, I would feel a *bit* better!).  <br/>
We&#39;re a UU family, and the UUA is beginning their own co-ed scouting group, <br/>
for all faiths, called Navigators USA (www.navigatorsusa.org).  I find this <br/>
religion to be the spiritual equivalent to unschooling ~ our Sunday School is <br/>
called *religious exploration* ~ and I think the troops can easily be <br/>
*unscouting.*  &lt;bg&gt; This group came out of the conflict between Boy Scouts and our first <br/>
principle (no dogma in this church!) of the inherent worth and dignity of <br/>
every single human being.  <br/>
I&#39;ve also heard great things about spiral scouts and the campfire <br/>
organization. I don&#39;t have any experience with sleep away camps yet, but already my kids <br/>
(7&5) know that different places have different expectations and limitations ~ <br/>
if the camp is FUN enough, they&#39;ll put up with the unschooly parts of it &lt;g&gt; <br/>

*****************************<br/>
Girl Scouts is a secular organization, although some troops are run out of <br/>
religious schools, etc., and they may not be secular.<br/>
<br/>
Also, just in case anyone doesn&#39;t know, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts are not <br/>
connected in any way organizationally, and have entirely different policies. <br/>
Girl Scouts do not discriminate on the basis of religion or sexual orientation as <br/>
Boy Scouts do.<br/>

My girls have always been involved in Girl Scouts and I was a leader <br/>
for years.  Rosie is still in a troop and has a really good time - they <br/>
do a lot of crafts and a lot of service projects together. Nice kids, <br/>
nice leader.<br/>
<br/>
But there are a lot of rules when attending large Girl Scout events - <br/>
there tends to be a lot of herding large groups of girls around and <br/>
doing superficial activities.<br/>
<br/>
If I had it to do over again, I&#39;d have gotten involved in 4H from the <br/>
beginning - I find it extremely unschooling compatible.<br/>
