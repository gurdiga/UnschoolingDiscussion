<div><font size="4">I want you to know your post is very encouraging. I wish I had 
known about homeschooling when I was a child. My mom always had tons of great 
books in our house and most of what&nbsp;I really learned back then I taught 
myself from the materials&nbsp;I had available at home or the library. School 
was wasted time for me. We have been homeschoolng for three years and&nbsp;I 
recently discovered unschooling. I have been devouring every bit of 
information&nbsp;I can&nbsp;find. My husband doesn&#39;t quite understand yet and is 
afraid our kids will be &quot;left behind&quot; if I don&#39;t push their lessons. (We have a 
ten year old reluctant reader). I will be sharing your post with him in hopes 
that he will learn to trust in his children&#39;s ability to learn what they need to 
be successful with their lives.&nbsp;Thanks again.</font></div>
