<div id="ygrps-yiv-125631280">Probably not a good thing to relay to the hubby who knows him, but I googled <br/>
Kyle Chandler to see what he looks like and ROFL!!!!  I&#39;m sorry, but for <br/>
some reason he looks like a buffed up Mr. Bean!  LOL!  Maybe it was the <br/>
picture or something but oh man, I&#39;m about to pee my pants!<br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine DOING Mr. Bean???<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>ROFLMAO, I had just asked my DH if he could remember the name of the WWII <br/>
series, I said Home Front and he agreed, so when I saw Treegoddess had known it I <br/>
was glad and wondered what you thought Jennifer. Then when I found this post <br/>
I was choking with laughter. My mom is here and wants to know what&#39;s so funny. <br/>
I don&#39;t know if I want to google him or not, because if the pic is as bad as <br/>
making him look like Mr. Bean, I will surely wet my pants. And since I go back <br/>
into the hospital tomorrow, which is why my mommy is here, that will just be <br/>
too much amunition for her to give the doctor....not only is Rhonda sick with <br/>
yada, yada, yada, but now she pees her pants while on the internet.LMAO<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - desparately trying to not soil herself.LOL<br/>
