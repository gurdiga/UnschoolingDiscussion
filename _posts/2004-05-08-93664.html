I remember getting &quot;worm medicine&quot; when I was a kid and it was to date the worst thing I ever had to swallow. I imagine it was for pinworms, which is strictly a human parasite. <br/>

&gt; Ringworm is NOT worms. It&#39;s a fungus. If you get it on your feet, that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; athlete&#39;s foot. You can get it from skin to skin contact with infected<br/>
&gt; people or animals. From contact of a surface infected by same or very<br/>
&gt; rarely, from the dirt. It&#39;s really not a big deal when you get it and can be<br/>
&gt; cleared up quite easily nowadays.<br/>

&gt; I wonder if some people are confusing ringworm with pin worms, which are<br/>
&gt; real worms.  They are transmitted via the fecal-oral route, and may be<br/>
&gt; contracted by contact with feces.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074356065">So we have a couple of legitimate reason for some of the barefootphobic <br/>
attitude of many people, but why don&#39;t we make people wear gloves all <br/>
the time?   There are so many more risks from bare hands than from bare <br/>
feet, yet we [as a society] feel it is perfectly fine for children to <br/>
touch door knobs etc after other people, to go into the doctor&#39;s waiting <br/>
room and breath the air that sick people are exhaling into, then go into <br/>
the doctor&#39;s office and sit on the same seats that some sick person was <br/>
just on... and the smaller the child the more likely they will actually <br/>
touch the seat with their hands... then the hands rub the nose of go <br/>
into the mouth and there we have instant infection...  yet we don&#39;t have <br/>
to wear gloves, masks and completely cover our germy bodies even in this <br/>
situation and then we panic because a child in the  playground removes <br/>
his/her shoes... weird.<br/>

I thought it had to be pig doo-doo, not dog.<br/>
Could be wrong.  I&#39;ve never known anyone who had it, and I don&#39;t live where <br/>
many pigs live.  Horses and cows and dogs, but we were told just stay out of <br/>
pig shit.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we just lucked out.<br/>
