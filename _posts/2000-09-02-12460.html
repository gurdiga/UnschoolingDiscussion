<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554495168">Our males cats have been neutered at 7 months.  I don&#39;t think I will ever <br/>
own a male cat again, since they are the ones peeing all over my house (they <br/>
get urinary tract infections easily).  We also have 5 cats.  As for the <br/>
smell, let me know if you find anything.<br/>

&gt;my boys taken care of before any of that territorial spraying instinct<br/>
&gt;begins to manifest itself.<br/>

&gt;AND has anyone ever tried unschooling 5 cats? :-)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, like a few others, I don&#39;t think that corporal punishment is an<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling issue, it is a parenting issue and a very volitile one!  <br/>
&gt;Also,<br/>
&gt; &gt; each and ever discussion of corporal punishment on all but one<br/>
&gt; &gt; home/unschooling list I belong to has gone down hill into at the least,<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; next thing to a flame war.  AND, that includes this list!  So, as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; courtesy to all of us who are, quite frankly, tired of the topic raising<br/>
&gt; &gt; its head every 6 months or so, please keep the same subject line so we <br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt; &gt; delete and get on with the business of unschooling.<br/>
