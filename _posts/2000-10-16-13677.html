 A friend from another list has a breastfed baby with problems with <br/>
 recurring ear infections.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to offer a suggestion:  Ask mom how much dairy she consumes.  I <br/>
did a ton of research when my second child (now 10 months) got recurring ear <br/>
infections and was exclusively breastfed.  I found a couple of studies that <br/>
suggested a link between dairy intake in mom and an increase chance of ear <br/>
infections in baby.  I cut it ALL out and my son never had another ear <br/>
infection.  At six months I started adding dairy back in SLOWLY and at 10 <br/>
months I&#39;m almost back to my normal intake.   I have yet to add back ice <br/>
cream which I would eat EVERY night (hormones I guess!!).  So far so good -- <br/>
it could be coincidence but it did work and almost immediately.  I suppose it <br/>
couldn&#39;t hurt to try!!!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-850944570">Thanks everyone who has answered this, the mother is <br/>
looking into it and appreciates everyone&#39;s info, <br/>
amazing how common this is, really.  And keep &#39;em <br/>
coming in, if you have anything to add, please.  This <br/>
reminded me of a child I met who had allergies to soy, <br/>
dairy and... vanilla!!!  Can you say &#39;pregnancy binge <br/>
on ice-cream???&#39;  Wierd, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again folks<br/>
