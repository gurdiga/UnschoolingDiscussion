<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014448968">I usually cut half the fat in cookie recipes with applesauce.  In some<br/>
recipes and for those with no nut allergies, you can substitute a couple<br/>
of tablespoons nut butter too for the same amount of margarine.  I&#39;ve<br/>
generally found you don&#39;t need the amount of fat they say.  You usually<br/>
don&#39;t need eggs in cookie recipes either.  &#39;Course I eat whale snot, so<br/>
there you go.   <br/>

brown sugar )</div>
