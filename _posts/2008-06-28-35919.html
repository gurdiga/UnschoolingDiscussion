<div id="ygrps-yiv-27921963">***Yeah, I know.  I&#39;m kind of a bully about clarity.  Instead of &quot;sit <br/>
straight,&quot; I&#39;m all &quot;think straight!&quot;   And &quot;Don&#39;t use RU--write it out; say it <br/>
full.&quot;**<br/>
<br/>
I was finding the spreading use of the RU acronym sort of mildly annoying, <br/>
but lately I&#39;ve seen dozens of instances of women using the term &quot;RUey&quot; and <br/>
that&#39;s just sent me over some edge. It looks and &quot;sounds&quot; like something I might <br/>
need to scrape off my shoe after a walk in the city. Ick.<br/>

Secret jargon is one of the banes of education itself.  Let&#39;s not be  <br/>
doing it on the other side.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Are you&#39; and &#39;rue&#39; both mean things in English, so having and  <br/>
acronym and pronouncing it as a word will add nothing to peace and  <br/>
friendliness to others.  It won&#39;t help friends and relatives  <br/>
understand and accept.  It will add unnecessary steps to already- <br/>
awkward conversations with people who want to know what you&#39;re doing.<br/>

Me too. For the past 40+ years, the acronym RU has always meant Rugby<br/>
Union. :-)<br/>
