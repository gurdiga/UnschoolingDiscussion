<br/>
THINGS I&#39;VE LEARNED FROM MY CHILDREN<br/>
<br/>
1. A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 sq foot <br/>
house 4 inches deep.<br/>
<br/>
2. If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with <br/>
roller blades, they can ignite.<br/>
<br/>
3. A 3 year olds voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowded <br/>
restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not <br/>
strong enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a <br/>
Superman cape. It is strong enough, however, .if tied to a paint can, <br/>
to spread paint over all four wal1s of a 20 by 20 foot room.<br/>
<br/>
5. You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. When <br/>
using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball. up a few <br/>
times before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball .a long <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
6. The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn&#39;t stop a baseball <br/>
hit by a ceiling fan.<br/>
<br/>
7. When you hear the toilet flush and the words &quot;&#39;Oh--oh, &quot; it&#39;s <br/>
already too late.<br/>
<br/>
8. Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it.<br/>
<br/>
9. A six year old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a 36 <br/>
year old man says they can only do it in the movies. A magnifying <br/>
glass can start a fire even on an overcast day.<br/>
<br/>
10. Certain LEGOs will pass through the digestive tract of a four <br/>
year old.<br/>
<br/>
11. Play Dough and Microwave should never be used in the same <br/>
sentence.<br/>
<br/>
12. Super glue is forever.<br/>
<br/>
13. No matter how much Jello you put in a. swimming pool, you still <br/>
can&#39;t walk on water.<br/>
<br/>
14. Pool filters do not like Jello<br/>
<br/>
15. VCR&#39;s do not eject PB&J sandwiches even though TV commercials <br/>
show they do.<br/>
<br/>
16. Garbage bags do not make good parachutes.<br/>
<br/>
17. Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving<br/>
<br/>
18. You probably do not want to know what that odor is.<br/>
<br/>
19. Always look in the oven before you turn it on. Plastic toys do <br/>
not like ovens.<br/>
<br/>
20. The fire department in Austin, TX has a 5 minute response time.<br/>
<br/>
21. The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earth worms <br/>
dizzy.<br/>
<br/>
22. It will however make cats dizzy.<br/>
<br/>
23. Cats throw up twice their body weight when dizzy, The mind of a <br/>
six year old is wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
First Grade..... true story. One day the first grade teacher was <br/>
reading the story of the Three Little Pigs to her class. She came to <br/>
the part of the story where the first pig was trying to accumulate <br/>
the building material s for his home. She read, &quot;And so the pig went <br/>
up to the man with the wheelbarrow full of straw and said, &quot;Pardon me <br/>
sir, but may I have some of that straw to build my house?&quot;&#39;. The <br/>
teacher paused then asked the class, &quot;And what do you think that man <br/>
said?&quot; One little boy raised his hand and said, &quot;I think he <br/>
said &#39;Holy S*#!! A talking pig! The teacher was unable to teach for <br/>
the next 10 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
