 This list has ~400 people listening, reading and talking.  What interests<br/>
the folks who are participating are the topics we persue.  We are a wildly<br/>
diverisfied list and have some great conversations.  The easiest way to<br/>
shift the topic to what you are interested in is to just start talking.  Ask<br/>
questions or tell your stories.  :)<br/>
<br/>
For the conversations that do not interest you, maybe you can delete by<br/>
subject line? Or if you read at the website you can read by subject line and<br/>
never have the mail come directly to your mailbox. This saves having to wade<br/>
through all the email.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re a rather independent bunch, and just as soon as we made one topic<br/>
offlimits, we&#39;d spend weeks on censorship and draconian practices. &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>
We really do try to stay on a topic though, and not move into the realm of<br/>
personal attacks.  We succeed there for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
So, how is unschooling going at your house?<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Content of this list!<br/>

<br/>
I joined this list in hopes of having conversations about different things<br/>
people were doing with their kids to have fun while learning at the same<br/>
time.  I thought perhaps I would get some ideas to try with my own son that<br/>
I might not have thought of on my own, while at the same time sharing some<br/>
of the things that we are doing.  If I had wanted to have numerous<br/>
conversations regarding Pro-life/Pro-Choice (which I have no intent on<br/>
telling you which I am because I do not believe it is anyone&#39;s business but<br/>
my own), I would have joined such a list!  I enjoy unschooling with my son,<br/>
but we certainly have better things to do with our time than have these<br/>
continual conversations.  It this is what this egroup is about (which I<br/>
doubt was the original intent) I would appreciate if someone would let me<br/>
know now so that I can unjoin and save us all a lot of aggravation!<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">What I&#39;ve enjoyed about this list is finding other 
people who think!&nbsp; Not necessarily think like me, but who think about the 
world in general- to me that&#39;s what unschooling is.&nbsp; Now I also admit that 
I&#39;ve been happy to find others who share similiar values. Often on other lists I 
only fit in, in a narrow, confined way.&nbsp; But on this list I&#39;ve found people 
who can discuss philosphy, spirituality, politics, ecology, family bed, extended 
breastfeeding, media, and on &amp; on....topics I am interested in, topics where 
I enjoy learning of different ideas, and different opinions.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Sometimes I have little interest in a specific 
thread, sometimes I disagree with stated opinions, but overall I feel a sense 
that I fit in here, and for that I am very thankful!&nbsp; For instance I am no 
longer interested in breastfeeding info, don&#39;t plan on doing that again, but I 
was thrilled to find a group that embraces that, as I did, even though I may 
skim or delete such posts if I&#39;m in a hurry, I would never want them to 
stop.&nbsp; I enjoyed the fact that people were discussing it even if I didn&#39;t 
join in.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The funny thing is that similar heated discussions 
(religion, abortion) have appeared on 2 other lists I am on this week.&nbsp; I 
know that this stuff springs up on many lists from time to time, but there seems 
to be a heatedness lately, I&#39;ve wondered if it isn&#39;t related to our new 
political climate.&nbsp; At a time when certain religious views seem to be 
forced on us, when the government is putting on such a conservative face,when 
the presidential election was&nbsp;decided in the manner that it was, 
well&nbsp;it seems to be stirring up a lot of anger, &amp; resentment.&nbsp; So 
to refuse to look at these feelings would be akin to sticking our heads in the 
sand, and refusing to see the world around us, and that wouldn&#39;t be unschooling 
like at all.&nbsp; At least in my opinion.</font></div>
