<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088867676">&lt;drat, I deleted the message I was replying to.  Anyway, the point was that<br/>
many don&#39;t unschool because they are afraid of the freedom of it.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
None of us give our children &quot;true&quot; freedom.  Anymore than any of us<br/>
actually have &quot;true&quot; freedom.  (Just ask me about what I&#39;ve gone through<br/>
last month to get a car in PA.  And having that vehicle by the end of this<br/>
week is giving me a sense of freedom I can&#39;t discribe.)  We are subject to<br/>
laws, to nature, to our earlier choices, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My two year old would love to play in the back yard all by himself.  Only<br/>
there is no fence and it&#39;s not safe.  Not for a second.  Now, I can sit in<br/>
an out of the way place in the yard and when he looks like he&#39;s headed out I<br/>
can go with him or entice him back in gently.  But that&#39;s an illusion of<br/>
freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Not that I&#39;m knocking that.  That illusion is what is going to give him the<br/>
belief later in life that he CAN do things all by him self.  The trust in me<br/>
and my company and guidance will allow him to trust me later when I tell him<br/>
about my own life.  And about why I make certain choices and hope he will<br/>
make similar ones.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the fear of freedom that makes some people scared to<br/>
unschool.  It&#39;s the fear of the greater responsibility that does it.  It<br/>
takes less to hand over schooling to someone else than it does to take it on<br/>
ourselves.  It takes less to follow someone else&#39;s structure at home than to<br/>
trust our kids to know what they need.  It&#39;s scary to take on all that<br/>
responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;ve been told our whole lives that we CAN&#39;T take on that<br/>
responsibility.  That specially trained people in an institution have to do<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I know that one of the things that was keeping me from &quot;starting&quot;<br/>
unschooling when I joined the list was the fear that I wasn&#39;t up to that<br/>
responsibility.  From reading the list and really, really watching my son<br/>
I&#39;m learning to trust that I CAN do it.  I&#39;m not there yet, but every day I<br/>
see myself trusting him more and more and giving my son more and more<br/>
chances to make his own choices.<br/>
<br/>
Still--it&#39;s a big job.  And it&#39;s a freedom with a price, just like any other<br/>
freedom.<br/>

<br/>
Relative to the other homeschooling families around here, my kids have a lot <br/>
of freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has a lot of free time this week, and really wanted to play with a <br/>
friend of hers, who is grounded.   She doesn&#39;t know why.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s <br/>
something lame.  She said she couldn&#39;t explain because she was grounded from <br/>
using the phone.  So they let her (or make her) answer the phone but won&#39;t <br/>
let her talk on it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not freedom.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing she&#39;s grounded for something chores or &quot;school&quot; (they <br/>
homeschool) related.<br/>
<br/>
Holly had free time because she was free to take a month off from fiddle <br/>
lessons, and because the modelling class she just finished (which she took <br/>
because she just wanted to, and stayed for a few extra weeks to graduate with <br/>
a batch of kids who liked her) is over now.  That was freedom, for Holly, to <br/>
make her own decisions about her schedule.<br/>
<br/>
My boys are free to come and go, to sleep or stay up.  Kirby was offered <br/>
extra hours at work today.  He was free to say &quot;only if it gets really busy, <br/>
but I&#39;ll come up there and play and be there just in case.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That, on a &quot;school day&quot; for most of the world, is a lot of freedom.<br/>

Therein lies the key to &quot;defining&quot;  freedom I think.  Any freedom we have is relative to others&#39; experience.<br/>
<br/>
We have &quot;more&quot; freedom than most people but we have &quot;less&quot; freedom than we might have in an ideal world.<br/>
