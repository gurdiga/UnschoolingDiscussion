<div id="ygrps-yiv-159824487">A dad has a website.  I registered years ago and someone contacted me  there <br/>
yesterday and responded to my response so I had to go back.  I was  wishing <br/>
she had just used e-mail, BUT... there are a couple of really  interesting <br/>
things there.<br/>
 <br/>
One is a graph predicting the growth of homeschooling and  the [downfall, or <br/>
slack-off] of school.  The cool thing is there  are slider bars for all the <br/>
variables, so you can adjust the rates of change  according to your own <br/>
predictions.  (He was an engineer before retirement  and it&#39;s a cool mathy thing with <br/>
the explanations down below.)<br/>

 <br/>
The other really cool thing is that on his bio page the photo moves, kinda  <br/>
like the photos Harry Potter sees on collecting cards and newspapers.<br/>

 <br/>
He has radio shows there for download (like talks he&#39;s given, it seems) but  <br/>
they won&#39;t play on a Mac.  He&#39;s pro-unschooling.  I might not mess  with it <br/>
anymore, but I thought that graph, especially, was fun and some of  you might <br/>
have friends or relatives who would be appeased by  it (and by a  website by <br/>
someone who&#39;s not &quot;just a mom&quot;).<br/>
