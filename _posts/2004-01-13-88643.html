    Thanks, I&#39;ll try that. I think it is new stuff. I already know about<br/>
that other wallpaper. We had that in our old house. Boy was it a bear to get<br/>
off. I&#39;ve got to get to bed. I haven&#39;t stayed up this late for quite a<br/>
while. ;-)<br/>

The best preparation for the future is a happy today :-)<br/>

&gt; can peal the top of the paper off just by grabbing an edge and pulling.  The<br/>
&gt; the rest of the paper and the glue would still be on the wall.  Spray it<br/>
&gt; with plain water, wait about five minutes, then peal it off too.  Wash the<br/>
&gt; walls and you&#39;re ready to go.  If it&#39;s really old wallpaper, call in a<br/>
&gt; professional.  (You don&#39;t really have too, but non-strippable wallpaper is a<br/>
&gt; b*tch to get off.)<br/>
