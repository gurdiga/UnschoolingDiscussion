<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922112547">As a few of you know just from talking, I have changed many of the ways I <br/>
parent over the years.  I used to spank, I no longer do that.  I used to say no a <br/>
lot, but now I take the time to question why I&#39;m saying no, and find myself <br/>
saying yes much more.  My kids, for the most part, are so much happier.  This <br/>
year 4 of the 6 still at home are back at home for &quot;school&quot; and the other 2 <br/>
(foster sons) will be once their adoption is final.  Unschooling is going <br/>
great...awesome in fact!<br/>
<br/>
But I am having a terrible, terrible time with my husband.  I love him <br/>
dearly, but we are not seeing eye to eye on giving the kids more freedoms to direct <br/>
their own lives.  Our disagreements cover everything from bedtimes, to eating, <br/>
to curfews, to clothes, etc.  My husband grew up in a very abusive home, but <br/>
has never been that way with the kids.  However....he is much more strict than <br/>
I and it is really beginning to cause problems.  <br/>
<br/>
Tonight, my 17 yo daughter (who will be 18 in December!!) was 5 minutes late <br/>
getting home...she is now restricted for a week.  He sees things as black and <br/>
white, and when someone moves slightly off the path, he sees it as the kids <br/>
being defiant against him, or him being too soft and not on top of things.  It <br/>
is all with the best intentions...partly because of his religious beliefs, <br/>
ethics, etc.  Partly because he was wild at one time and doesn&#39;t want to see them <br/>
get in trouble like he did.  But we have VERY GOOD KIDS!!!  I don&#39;t see why he <br/>
can&#39;t see that and realize they&#39;ll be OK if he&#39;d let them have more freedoms!<br/>
<br/>
It has been worse only lately, because he is home full time after we took out <br/>
a loan to finish our house before winter, enough to survive on for at least <br/>
another 3 months.  I&#39;m tired of the tension all this is bringing into our <br/>
family.  I want so badly to see my children happy...I want them to have a good <br/>
relationship with their dad.  But lately they feel he is so unfair (and I do too) <br/>
and don&#39;t even want to be around him.  I try not to argue around them, and <br/>
instead talk to him in private, but we just don&#39;t see eye to eye on a lot of <br/>
things.  <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; get in trouble like he did.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Presumably he was raised in a very strict environment, and it didn&#39;t stop<br/>
him from getting in trouble.  What makes him think that the same kind of<br/>
upbringing will keep his kids out of trouble?  Maybe he went wild *because*<br/>
of the way he was raised.<br/>

What about putting their concerns in writing?  Either them doing it or you <br/>
doing it for them?  Transcribe?  If it&#39;s in writing and there&#39;s a recommendation <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-673107124"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; But I am having a terrible, terrible time with my husband.  I love him<br/>

abusive home, but  has never been that way with the kids.  However....he is<br/>
much more strict than I and it is really beginning to cause problems.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I first began making changes and giving the kids a lot more freedom and<br/>
choice, Mark was worried  and we had quite a few heated discussions. Now<br/>
things are much better and I am so proud of the way he is mastering his<br/>
anger and working on changing the way he speaks to the kids etc.<br/>
<br/>
One of the problems for him was that he felt left out. We were all at home<br/>
having loads of fun doing exactly what we wanted and he was at work. I made<br/>
an extra effort to make him feel appreciated and mentioned to the kids every<br/>
now and then how great it was that dad worked so hard so that we could be at<br/>
home. I think that helped.<br/>
<br/>
 He also was worried that they would grow up with no sense of responsibility<br/>
because I wasn&#39;t making them do chores. And I think coming home to a really<br/>
messy house  didn&#39;t help. Still working on the messy house &lt;g&gt; but I<br/>
mentioned to him from time to time how much more willing the kids are to<br/>
help me now that they don&#39;t have to. Telling him about the helpful kind<br/>
things the kids did during the day, you know sharing the good stuff, helped<br/>
lots.<br/>
<br/>
I printed off heaps from this list and websites for him to read. It&#39;s scary<br/>
to suddenly change the way you parent and without all the great ideas and<br/>
discussion on this list, I don&#39;t know that I could have done it. It&#39;s really<br/>
important IMO to make the information out there accessible to your partner<br/>
and to make the time privately to talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
 Mark felt that he didn&#39;t know his place in the family anymore and had no<br/>
idea how to be. It takes time to get comfortable with new stuff so little by<br/>
little is my motto. And just like our kids need lots of encouragement in<br/>
learning grown ups do too, so telling them when they handled something<br/>
really well is helpful too.<br/>
<br/>
Compromising in areas like bedtime for awhile has worked for us. The kids<br/>
are going to bed later and they don&#39;t have a set one but if Mark has had a<br/>
long  day and his back is sore and his head is thumping I&#39;ll offer the kids<br/>
an extra couple of chapters if they would like to go to bed earlier. It&#39;s<br/>
when you&#39;re tired at the end of the day that the controlling, knee jerk<br/>
reactions happen so keeping a &#39;flexible&#39; bedtime makes for a peaceful house<br/>
at this time.<br/>
<br/>
And making time for each other. Making some time in the day or night to be<br/>
together has helped Mark to not feel left out.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps Nancy.<br/>

I am always encouraging him to pursue his interests, but I think he hears the <br/>
&quot;ghosts&quot; from his past, his mom harassing and fussing at him that he&#39;s too <br/>
much like his dad.  His mom is a very bitter person who puts down anything and <br/>
anyone that may make her feel even more bitter.  Constantly haranguing about <br/>
how she got left by his dad, then got mixed up with a very abusive husband and <br/>
had 4 more kids...was mostly on welfare all of her adult years.  I hate to say <br/>
it to him, but once in a while I remind him he&#39;s sounding very much like his <br/>
mom.<br/>
Mark felt that he didn&#39;t know his place in the family anymore and had no<br/>

learning grown ups do too, so telling them when they handled something<br/>
really well is helpful too.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I notice that when I am gone for the day, or if Charlotte talks to him by <br/>
herself, and HE is in charge, they can work things out and come to compromises.  <br/>
But it&#39;s always stuff like, &quot;help me nail up this drywall and you can leave <br/>
early for the movies or stay out later.&quot;  I guess it&#39;s not so bad.  But I think <br/>
you helped me figure out a big part of it...his being left out.  Maybe it&#39;s <br/>
also that he sees me being much happier with the kids, them happier with me, us <br/>
becoming closer, and he DOES feel left out.  Hmmmmm.....I wonder if them <br/>
heading off to dinner or a hobby shop by themselves would help some.  <br/>

Ugh...this is something that is definately lacking...I know my attitude about <br/>
things has not always been the best.  I am often completely exhausted at the <br/>
end of the day (as he is) and he falls asleep in his recliner and I fall <br/>
asleep reading in bed.  Family is here right now (my mom and stepdad) so we&#39;ve not <br/>
had much privacy to talk either.  <br/>
<br/>

did you ask dh why he wanted to restrict the child/teen and what he hoped to <br/>
accomplish.  In a nice way.  And really have a dialogue and why you feel the <br/>
way you do.  It will probably take a lot of time.  There are people that it hits <br/>
like a light switch and those that it takes time and a lot of discussion. <br/>

always been on the same page when parenting issues are concerned.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey there Nancy B. in WV, <br/>
<br/>
I agree with Sandra on the writing part, even if he never sees it, the kids <br/>
and yourselves can get your own feelings expressed. All of them good, happy, <br/>
sad, frustrated, irritated. I would also add that since I believe you said in an <br/>
earlier post he is now home with all of you for a few months working on the <br/>
house, perhaps if you have a video camera handy, the kids could take turns <br/>
taping &quot;dad&quot; and the process of the remodeling. While giving him more attention to <br/>
what he is doing and creating an interest for the family, questions could be <br/>
tossed about here and there and then the family could watch it together or <br/>
just you and DH, either way, you&#39;d be opening up lines of communication and he&#39;d <br/>
be seeing his own actions like his attitude and hearing his own voice and <br/>
maybe that&#39;s what he needs, a dose of himself.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought, <br/>
<br/>
Good luck, <br/>
Rhonda<br/>

This weekend I told my husband to yell at me instead of the kids over a silly <br/>
superhero toy I bought (money is tight).  I just said &quot;I&#39;m the one who bought it, <br/>
please yell at me instead of them.  It was my decision.&quot;  It worked.  Still <br/>
working on the threats.  But my son&#39;s response might work better.  Last night <br/>
he refused to brush his teeth until his dad said &quot;please.&quot;<br/>

Hope you get better responses.<br/>

<br/>
It is always difficult when two partners are on differnt end of the <br/>
playing field.  One specific example for me was when we had our <br/>
first son.   I did not want him circumcised.  I did alot of research <br/>
and reading and my dh went with the the typical reasons we should.  <br/>
At some point I just put my foot down and said he needed to read <br/>
what I had found and than if he still wanted it his way he could go <br/>
in with the baby.  That was enough, once he read the information it <br/>
was difficult to argue with me and now he talks like it was his <br/>
idea..LOL!<br/>
<br/>
If you are having trouble maybe focus on one topic which is causing <br/>
problems, bedtime, more freedom, the problems with the institution <br/>
of school.  Sometimes I break in my dh slowly by just mentioning <br/>
things discussed on this list, pulling out little excerpts or <br/>
reading him a paragraph from a book.  I have tried to give him books <br/>
to read but he is busy and they never get read which led to me feel <br/>
resentful about him not being not part of the decision making.  Now, <br/>
I respect that I make more of the decisions but by cueing him into <br/>
what we are doing he feels some control.<br/>
<br/>
For example, with bedtime routines I just didn&#39;t make a big deal <br/>
about putting the kids to bed and then I discussed some of the <br/>
information I had gotten from here.   Even with homeschooling in <br/>
general, I read the books and gave him the synopsis qouting the <br/>
really &quot;great&quot; stuff.  Especially if I got to a real intersting <br/>
part, I would say &quot;LISTEN TO THIS!&quot;  which is more sharing <br/>
than &quot;teaching&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree with Julie that my dh felt a little left out for a while <br/>
with us getting to go the zoo and parks, etc. and him stuck working <br/>
so defintiley making him feel important helps.  Right now Keiran, my <br/>
5yo, is playing Zelda with his Dad.  My dh feels special because <br/>
this is their thing and he can&#39;t wait for Dad to come home.  Bedtime <br/>
goes later and later because he is playing and wants Keiran there <br/>
with him.  It is really rather cute.  A few times Keiran has fallen <br/>
asleep and my dh wanted to wake him up to show him something.  I had <br/>
to remind him that he was tired enough..LOL!<br/>
<br/>
So maybe in small doses of  sharing information and making him feel <br/>
a bit more a part of the group might help.  Also, if you have always <br/>
beleived in doing something one way it is hard to do it different <br/>
especially without the resources of books and groups like this so it <br/>
is harder for husbands IMO.<br/>

  But lately they feel he is so unfair (and I do too) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>on a lot of <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any ideas?  <br/>

I did not want him circumcised.  I did alot of research <br/>
and reading and my dh went with the the typical reasons we should.  <br/>
At some point I just put my foot down and said he needed to read <br/>
what I had found and than if he still wanted it his way he could go <br/>
in with the baby.  That was enough, once he read the information it <br/>
was difficult to argue with me and now he talks like it was his <br/>
idea..LOL!<br/>
&quot;The man may be the head of the household, but the woman is the neck, and the <br/>
neck can turn the head any way she wants to&quot;  :o)<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling was originally my idea, he was totally against it.  Took a <br/>
while but after a lot of begging, reasoning, and finally crying and pouting on my <br/>
part, he gave in.  13 years later, he&#39;s got every argument against public <br/>
school under his belt and gladly shares &quot;his&quot; beliefs with people at their wits <br/>
end with government education.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten some great ideas.  Tomorrow morning when my head isn&#39;t swimming <br/>
with this day&#39;s clutter, I&#39;ll pen a heartfelt letter to him and encourage the <br/>
kids to do the same.  <br/>

<br/>
Sometimes I have said things like &quot;We haven&#39;t been to the zoo for a while.  <br/>
Do you want to go with us Saturday, or would you rather we just go Friday even <br/>
though you can&#39;t go?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t REALLY want to go.  But by making it his decision, it turns to <br/>
relief that he&#39;ll still have Saturday to do stuff around the house, and yes we go <br/>
to the zoo without him on Friday, but at least he COULD have gone.<br/>
<br/>
That sort of thing has happened lots of times here.  Keith used to complain <br/>
that he was left out and just had to work all the time, but he knows and I know <br/>
he would be working whether we had kids or not.  We know he likes the kids <br/>
being home.  We know he doesn&#39;t REALLY want to take them all the places I take <br/>
them.  But once in a while I offer, or suggest it might be cool if he&#39;d take <br/>
Holly and her friends to do something, and he says &quot;Why don&#39;t you?  Do you need <br/>
cash?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Partly it just sounds like a trick, but deeper, it IS a reminder that he <br/>
could be doing more kid-duty and that he&#39;s choosing not to.  Not always, but that <br/>
he&#39;s choosing.  They do all get to hang out with him and go places with him, <br/>
too, and he&#39;s better at acting natural with them than he was at first.  It took <br/>
years for him to be able to just converse with them normally, and not in some <br/>
stilted kind of way.  But he got there.<br/>

-----the quote of me ended up there------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t get their e-mail in color, and so please (in case that was <br/>
color to show the difference) please separate quote somehow or it gets all <br/>
confusing.   Thanks!<br/>

OH!! NEVER MIND; very sorry for me pulling them since you already pulled and <br/>
