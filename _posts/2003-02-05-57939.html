 </span></blockquote>We are working on that.   Her big interests are &quot;babies&quot;  babysitting, <br/>
anything to do with small children. And she loves to sew too.  She got books <br/>
at the library about babysitting and we signed her up for a Red Cross baby <br/>
sitting class.. And,shes signed up for a 4-H sewing class.    I did make her <br/>
a &quot;lesson plan&quot;  She looked at it and said. (making a face) I dont really <br/>
want to do this.  So, she didnt.. She made herself a &quot;reading schedule&quot;  of <br/>
books she wanted to ( was already) reading.. She followed it for a couple of <br/>
days.   She was soooo &quot;sucesss/pleasing others&quot; oriented.. She liked getting <br/>
assignments, having tasks ect and completing them to feel successful.. I told <br/>
her I can certainly do all of that for her.. But she says.. Mom, your not a <br/>
teacher, I dont feel like I HAVE to do the stuff.. I said.. well, you really <br/>
dont.  And when she was in school. I never made her feel like she HAD do <br/>
things.. I was very lax about school work.  Sometimes she would get all upset <br/>
if she was late with a project or she got a B.. I was like.. oh, come on, <br/>
Anna, its fine..dont sweat it.  Her determination came from her own <br/>
volition..not something I projected on to her.  Thats just the kind of girl <br/>
she is.  I am trying to help her, guide her, support her into seeing how <br/>
valuable SHE is, as a person,  that her worth comes from HER not from her <br/>
grades and her accomplishments..  I have no doubt.. she will always strive to <br/>
excel in anything she does.  I expect when she takes the sewing class,  she <br/>
will not be satisfied til her project is perfect.   Thats just Anna.<br/>

Hi, Teresa (and Anna)<br/>
<br/>
I like to quilt.  This may be an exaggeration, but I&#39;ve heard that Amish<br/>
quilters, if they haven&#39;t made a mistake in their quilt so far will put<br/>
one in on purpose, because only God is supposed to be able to make<br/>
things that are perfect.<br/>
<br/>
I like the story and it helps me live with my quilting mistakes.<br/>
