<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209379807">As I prepare to carve my jack-o&#39;-lanterns, I want to share how these pumpkins <br/>
came to be.  <br/>
One of the families in our hs support group had a pumpkin patch this year ~ <br/>
Great Kids *Pumpkid* Patch.  Gramma and Grampa run a successful construction <br/>
business.  Instead of just handing money or the business over to the next <br/>
generation, they decided to *sponsor* a business for their 13 grandkids (ages 7-21). <br/>
 Business and marketing plans were required.  Research into licenses was <br/>
done.  They (the kids) came together and decided that growing and selling pumpkins <br/>
was the best idea.  The kids participated and were responsible for every step <br/>
of the process.  <br/>
When we went to the patch to pick out our pumpkins, there was a presentation, <br/>
by a 9 & 11 year old team, on how the business came to be, goals of the <br/>
business, the process of growing pumpkins, stories about pumpkins and pumpkin <br/>
related games.  The pumpkins were sold out by the second weekend in October!  <br/>
Now Gramma & Grampa didn&#39;t unschool their children, but they fully support <br/>
the unschooling of their grandchildren.  Who else could completely understand <br/>
that in order to understand business, you have to *be* a business.  That kind of <br/>
thinking so easily translates into how the unschooling life works.  <br/>
