Your daughter shouldn&#39;t be responsible for paying for a slushie if<br/>
she&#39;s hungry. If your rule is that treats are their responsibility,<br/>
that puts you in a bind when she&#39;s hungry and really wants a slushie.<br/>
That&#39;s the problem with rules. The rule got in the way of helping her<br/>
return to peacefulness so any bumps in the day didn&#39;t feel like craters.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just to clarify, my younger girls had brought their own money to buy a treat, just for fun, at the place we were originally going to.<br/>
<br/>
After we decided to skip location one, and were discussing location two-the park, she asked is she could still buy a treat, I said yes, we could stop on the way back from the park.  Then she asked about the price of a slushie, and I said yes, she had enough and could buy that if she wanted.  The hungry part started shortly after that, and I think, in retrospect, that she wanted the treat sooner than later, and didn&#39;t ask me, because I had already said &quot;after the park&quot; we&#39;d go for the treat.  Had I been a little more perceptive, I would have seen that, and suggested it.  It never occurred to me till later.  It has also occurred to me that it&#39;s unfortunate she didn&#39;t think I would take her first, before the park.  I&#39;m seeing how sometimes when we don&#39;t focus on the child&#39;s needs, or value their wants, they don&#39;t trust us enough to ask for them, because they don&#39;t think we&#39;ll say &quot;yes&quot;.  This is one way how I can see myself slowly becoming more aware of interactions going on, and how things could change for the better.  I&#39;m catching myself,and thinking things through a whole lot more.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762229319">I have been also consciously trying to not operate from rules. So now we eat<br/>
when hungry not when it is breakfast time. Or we bathe when we feel warm ,<br/>
not because it bath time. The kids sleep in, and are not awoken<br/>
because &quot;early to bed early to rise&quot; is a rule. and amazingly they have<br/>
always woken up as early as 5 am when we have had to travel. My daughter<br/>
always catches up on her sleep in the car!<br/>
