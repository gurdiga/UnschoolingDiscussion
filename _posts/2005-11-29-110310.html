<div id="ygrps-yiv-758995772">&quot;Can anyone give me examples of situations and things<br/>
that would be considered natural consequences and<br/>
things that would be considered not natural<br/>
consequences and why?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A natural consequence is something that happens, all on it&#39;s own, <br/>
because of an action.<br/>
If I eat nothing, I WILL eventually starve to death.<br/>
If someone smashes their head into a wall hard enough, they will get <br/>
hurt.<br/>
If I drive my car into a telephone pole, something will get damaged.<br/>
If I stand out in the rain without any protection, the natural <br/>
consequence is that I will get wet.<br/>
<br/>
What a natural consequence is NOT, is when a parent punishes a child <br/>
and calls it a &quot;natural consequence&quot;..there is nothing natural about <br/>
it.<br/>
It&#39;s trendy to give &quot;natural consequences&quot; to a child that is doing <br/>
something the parent doesn&#39;t like....take away tv privileges if they <br/>
watch too much tv, give extra chores if they don&#39;t do their chores, <br/>
make them eat something for breakfast if they don&#39;t finish it, <br/>
restrict them from some fun activity because they weren&#39;t behaving <br/>
the way the parent wanted.....blah, blah, blah.<br/>
<br/>
In that case, &quot;natural consequence&quot; is just a sugar coated way of <br/>
saying PUNISHMENT.<br/>
None of those things would have happened naturally, the parent chose <br/>
them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-862683189">Right.  To go further, if a child who doesn&#39;t know better stands out in<br/>
<br/>
the road and the parent doesn&#39;t try to rescue the child from getting<br/>
run <br/>
over when cars barrel down that road (can&#39;t imagine such a neglectful <br/>
person), that&#39;s not a natural consequence either.  Same with a child <br/>
going to bed hungry because he didn&#39;t eat &quot;when dinner was served.&quot; <br/>
Those are not natural consequences.  They are the result of arbitrary <br/>
decisions the parent/caregiver(s) have made.<br/>
