&lt;&lt;  Spoonfeeding is for babies. Removing <br/>
 the antagonistic people from your list (if you continue to do so) will <br/>
surely <br/>
 make the list and what you stand for irrelevant. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Trying to make a list be what it isn&#39;t and ignoring the wishes of everyone at <br/>
the list is immature.<br/>
Coming back on and complaining about it months after it happened and <br/>
everything has been smoothed over is exceptionally questionable. What is the <br/>
motive?<br/>
I met Ned in real life in October, I did Tai Chi with his wife Luz, I enjoyed <br/>
everything they had to say and they didn&#39;t seem especially heartbroken that <br/>
he wasn&#39;t on this list. In fact he made a big joke about it in one of his <br/>
talks, it was quite funny.<br/>
Ned is still around....he has his own list if you like what he is saying. <br/>
There shouldn&#39;t be a problem.<br/>

I&#39;ve wondered for several months now why the subject lines of your <br/>
posts do not contain the &quot;Re:&quot;.  This normally indicates a new topic, <br/>
but even your replies to old topics don&#39;t have the &quot;Re:&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Is this your browser doing that, or do you delete the &quot;re&quot; for a <br/>
reason?  Just wondering, since it&#39;s a new year...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084936761">someone check my reality here for me will you?<br/>
My son is in Yeshiva high school...his wish.  He is not doing so well in<br/>
history.  Okay, we are trying to figure out why.  Anyway, his teacher calls<br/>
me up today, irate...why? Something my son did in class...Yes? He handed in<br/>
his homework with the words purplesomething or other and icehand written in<br/>
the midst of his answers. Why? Because he wanted to see if the teacher was<br/>
reading his paper.<br/>
<br/>
IRATE???? I mean, comeon! I guess I would get a bit annoyed, but wouldn&#39;t<br/>
you think you would want to know why the kid thought you weren&#39;t reading his<br/>
homework? And is it really something that you need to call the parent about?<br/>
Sheesh, no wonder he dislikes the teachers so much.  It was a stupid thing<br/>
to do but I don&#39;t think it is incredibly bad, and as a teacher it would<br/>
indicate to me a sense of distrust....I would want to know why he felt I<br/>
wasn&#39;t reading his work....<br/>

<br/>
Get this, he was going to make a copy of the paper to SHOW me the additions.<br/>
 I told him it was okay, I didn&#39;t need to see it. I believed him.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I told Meir to apologize to him, just to save any chance he has of<br/>
getting a passing grade.<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I actually think it is kind of funny...  And he could have had a great time<br/>
commenting on the inaccurate bits of information. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-161129772">This reminds me of a time that my dd wrote this<br/>
beautiful poem, turned it in and got it back with a<br/>
giant red D written across the top. I asked why and it<br/>
was because she wrote it in pencil and didn&#39;t double<br/>
space. I asked her if this discouraged her and she<br/>
said, &quot;It just makes it so you don&#39;t want to try.&quot; So<br/>
sad. And she knows she has the freedom to return to<br/>
home schooling anytime she wants to, but because of<br/>
all of her girlfriends she decides to stay in a<br/>
mediocre atmosphere to further her education.<br/>
Again...so sad. <br/>
  My one comfort is that she continues to walk to the<br/>
beat of  her own drummer despite the herd mentality of<br/>
a group school setting. <br/>
  Annette<br/>
<br/>
PS: BTW. I was mad too about the insensitivity and the<br/>
single mindedness that this teacher showed. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695198033">I was thinking the same thing.  My son has all but decided he is going to public school for high school next year for exactly the same reason.<br/>
<br/>
I have to keep reminding myself that whatever happens at school really doesn&#39;t much matter.  Contrary to what they&#39;d like us to believe, school does not rule our lives even if he does decide to be a student there.<br/>

Actually it IS me doing it. I get the list in digest form, so when I want to <br/>
respond it is like hitting &quot;create mail&quot; (I simply hit reply) and it brings <br/>
up the digest number as the heading. I don&#39;t want to send mail that just says <br/>

<br/>
You know what this really comes down to, I think?  That the teacher feels<br/>
insecure about his own teaching and perhaps really ISN&#39;T reading the<br/>
paper... your son hit a raw nerve, I&#39;ll bet.<br/>
<br/>
It is very disturbing to think that the relationship between your son & this<br/>
teacher is such that your son felt the need to test the teacher in this way.<br/>
That says to me that the teacher hasn&#39;t given feedback/ conferenced/<br/>
chatted/ written notes/ whatever-- and that your son WANTS that from the<br/>
teacher.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know much about Yeshiva schools & their general teaching methods.<br/>
Is there some way your son could take the responsibility on himself to talk<br/>
with the teacher?  To explain his point of view, why he did that, and what<br/>
his motivations were?  It would be nice to think that such a conversation<br/>
could be held, if for no other reason than repairing the relationship.<br/>
