&gt; muttered something about more growth hormone being secreted then and I <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; question him further -- you know how doctors&#39; appts are -- not a lot of <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it has to do with growth hormone, and the fact that a sleeping body <br/>
is very relaxed. On an aside, did you know that there are times in sleep <br/>
where your body is in a state of paralyzation? Have you ever woken suddenly <br/>
and not been able to move? It is a very weird feeling.<br/>
