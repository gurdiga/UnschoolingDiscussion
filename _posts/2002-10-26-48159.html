<div id="ygrps-yiv-877664962">I&#39;m glad you have a hospital bed.  I&#39;m sorry your insurance won&#39;t pay for it, <br/>
though.   I wanted one, but I&#39;m already much better.  It&#39;s been two weeks.  <br/>
They took out the yucky staples and put on a tighter cast two days ago.  It&#39;s <br/>
way better to have your foot up.  I have a couch with a good pillow-pile, ten <br/>
feet from a toilet.  Fireplace, VCR, DVD, kids passing through all hours of <br/>
the day and night (UNLESS I&#39;m hungry or out of water)...<br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth, I don&#39;t mean to scare you but to encourage you.  Before I had <br/>
children I broke my leg VERY badly and was in a cast (eventually a plastic <br/>
velcroed on brace) for Six Months, so these three and four month things we <br/>
have are horrible, yes, and I hope YOU never have to say &quot;Yeah, the LAST <br/>
time...&quot;  but here 17 years after my first time, I&#39;m relieved about many <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
First time, we didn&#39;t have insurance.  We had been married for just over a <br/>
year.  My husband had to bedpan me for a week after I was in the hospital for <br/>
a week.  He slept on the floor near the bed because it hurt me for anyone to <br/>
even sit on the bed.  And I lived to reproduce.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad neither last time nor this time did I have little children.  I have <br/>
big children, all double-digit children.  Holly turns 11 on Saturday.  So <br/>
they are inconvenienced, yes.  Kirby has to walk to work.  Holly wants me to <br/>
help her arrange some things in her room, but it&#39;s upstairs.  Not yet for <br/>
upstairs.<br/>
<br/>
Going out involves a wheelchair through the dirt, a couple of scary bumps, <br/>
and getting into a van in the alley behind my house.  I&#39;ve been to a funeral <br/>
and to the doctor.  I never want to go anywhere again in my life (it seems, <br/>
right now).<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for your words of encouragement.  I know that 8 weeks of no weight is <br/>
going to be followed by something else and something else until I&#39;m healed.  <br/>
they try to sugar coat it by not telling the patient everything, but that&#39;s <br/>
really not helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Yikes about the bedpan.  My mother in law just emptied my potty chair.<br/>
<br/>
We rearranged my living quarters today, which has cheered me up immensely.  I <br/>
have problems with claustrophobia, so all the stuff in here was making me <br/>
nuts.  Now the kids can play at my feet and I can be involved in their stuff <br/>
more.  and now that the pain is better, I want to be involved more.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are little, 3 and 4, so this is rough on them.  On the other hand, <br/>
they are learning an awful lot.  Nathan thoroughly inspected the wheelchair <br/>
to figure out how it works today.  They want and ask to bring me things, <br/>
usually not when I want it or what I want, though.  And generally they are <br/>
taking it in stride.  They are learning a whole lot about community and <br/>
family and love and support and caring for each other.  I&#39;m not distracted by <br/>
doing, so I&#39;m better able to listen.  and I have a much stronger respect for <br/>
mothers with physical disabilities.<br/>
<br/>
On the whole going out thing, I can totally relate.  First of all, I hold my <br/>
breath whenever anyone goes down the basement stairs until they come back up. <br/>
 Secondly, our street has been torn up and is just one great mud slick after <br/>
a couple days of rain.  They just poured new curbs, gutters and driveway <br/>
aprons which need to cure so there is no way I could possibly go out.  I see <br/>
enough of the outdoors coming back in, though, on my kids.<br/>
<br/>
While it sucks that this happened, we are all learning so much from it.  The <br/>
real message, it seems to me today, is that we all need to slow down.  Make <br/>
two trips.  Hold the rail.  Splurge on a new pair of shoes that have actual <br/>
treads.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069783133">Hi Sandra and Elizabeth,<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to hear about your broken legs.  My mother broke her leg a <br/>
few years ago-same way as you, Elizabeth-fall on the basement <br/>
stairs.  She had a special seat with handles that sat over the <br/>
regular toilet (much better than a bedpan or potty chair).  She used <br/>
a 1st floor bathroom and had an electric bed also.  She also had a <br/>
bath seat so she could bathe (after the cast, with a removable brace).<br/>
I&#39;ve also heard of cleansing cloths used for people who can&#39;t bathe <br/>
or shower, but can&#39;t remember the name.<br/>
When using the wheelchair outside on rough terrain, it&#39;s easier if <br/>
someone tips the wheelchair backwards before pushing it (sometimes <br/>
going backwards can be easier.)<br/>
That&#39;s all I can think of right now.<br/>

This is great that you are seeing the positiveness in this!  <br/>
Take Care,<br/>

I like your &quot;oversharing&quot;,  it makes me laugh,  and that is so needed sometimes!<br/>
Especially right now for me,  I have this horrible sinus thing going on, so I&#39;m up at the computer at 3:00 a.m.,  there was my sharing.<br/>
