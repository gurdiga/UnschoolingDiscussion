<div id="ygrps-yiv-843652804">and it comes right back to you.  After posting about lonliness <br/>
today, we were invited to a homeschool gymnastics class.  Turns out <br/>
my daughter really wants to take it.  We heard it was really low <br/>
structure with a pretty broad age group.  I feel pretty good about <br/>
it.  I especially like that it is mid day on a Wednesday when the <br/>
gym is empty, *and* it is half the price of &quot;regular&quot; gymnastics.  <br/>
Cool.<br/>
