<div id="ygrps-yiv-937776532">Hi I&#39;m not the OP about having a minecraft server for unschoolers but I<br/>
think I might know somewhat how they might be feeling atm.   Cindi if you<br/>
are still reading I&#39;m sorry it hasn&#39;t worked out so far.  <br/>
<br/>
About 9 months ago my daughter started a minecraft server.   First one she<br/>
ever did, yeah, but also the last one possibly.   After a few local<br/>
homeschool friends were playing on the server for a few weeks it was decided<br/>
to invite even more local home educators.  People we didn&#39;t know all that<br/>
well.   This started some discussions with other local HE parents.  As a<br/>
home educating family running a server one of the many issues we&#39;d not<br/>
thought about at all but quickly became aware of via emails was the<br/>
different expectations some people were going to have because this server<br/>
was by a HE child (& so family).   We very quickly learned being the host<br/>
wasn&#39;t going to be nearly so simple to just open the server to &#39;home<br/>
educators&#39;.   Dd server never was opened up to all the local home educators<br/>
as she just wanted to play the game and thought she was being nice to open<br/>
it to others.   <br/>
<br/>
At the time it felt a little crushing as her mum to see the original<br/>
excitement in dd leave her about this.   She was fine pretty quickly about<br/>
it all though but she did seem to lose all interest in minecraft all<br/>
together after that.   The idea of hosting a place for all these other<br/>
children was a lovely idea but the reality was quite different and not what<br/>
she&#39;d been hoping or looking for.   When her computer crashed a month or two<br/>
later she didn&#39;t start the server up again.   <br/>
