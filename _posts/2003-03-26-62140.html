<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214429929"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s due to adolescence.  He&#39;s had them since he was three.  <br/>
&gt;&gt;We have tried to figure out what is causing them.  Protein sometimes <br/>
&gt;&gt;helps, but not always.  Sleep always helps.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A little caffeine used to help me. Maybe a small glass of Pepsi as he feels <br/>
one coming on? Sounds counter-intuitive, I know, but it helped with <br/>
constricting the blood vessels in my head to slow the pounding.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I think he gets pinched nerves in his neck (like I do) which can cause <br/>
&gt;&gt;major headaches!  I think the above experience is because he sits at the <br/>
&gt;&gt;computer all slumped over.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe teach him the stretches and relaxation techniques that they recommend <br/>
to people who work in offices? Help him get up for frequent stretch and <br/>
movement breaks. Not so that he has to get off or lose his turn, just so <br/>
that he moves himself around for a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It&#39;s him coming over to me and saying, &quot;Mom, I&#39;m hungry.&quot; So I say, &quot;Make <br/>
&gt;&gt;a sandwich.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why not just make him a sandwich yourself? Better yet, bring him one before <br/>
he knows he&#39;s hungry so it&#39;s just there like manna from heaven. ;-) May help <br/>
avert the headache too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Funny thing is, he _loves_ to cook dinner! Especially with his dad (who&#39;s <br/>
&gt;&gt;a chef).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>WOW! That&#39;s great! I&#39;d encourage that interaction and forget about why he <br/>
won&#39;t make a simple sandwich. Very cool.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
~Mary<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green <br/>
earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly alive.&quot;<br/>
