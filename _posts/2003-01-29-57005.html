<br/>
I just renewed my teaching credential (so I can do portfolio <br/>
assessments for unschoolers) and they checked my college credentials, <br/>
my fingerprints, my police record, my references, but NOT my high <br/>
school!!!<br/>
<br/>
And hubby just took on a second job to try to gain back some of what <br/>
we&#39;ve lost in W&#39;s delightful economy and they checked his local job <br/>
references only, had him pay for and get a copy of his police record, <br/>
took his fingerprints for their files, but did NOT check with his <br/>
high school nor with the colleges he attended.  <br/>
<br/>
Dd, 15, started working at 13.  She now has two jobs.  We had to get <br/>
a work permit and file all that stupid paperwork with the school <br/>
system in this overcontrolling state, but they never checked any of <br/>
her references at all, just liked her and hired her.  <br/>
<br/>
Before subbing I was hired to grade state proficiency tests and they <br/>
insisted on seeing my diplomas, from high school and college, which <br/>
they photocopied, as well as my copy of my college transcripts (not a <br/>
certified copy), but they never checked with either of these places.<br/>
<br/>

I don&#39;t think anything has changed, Elizabeth.  Everything I am <br/>
reporting is recent.  Hubby has applied for and started a second job <br/>
this week and got a callback on a different full-time job, too.  And <br/>
none of these checked his high school records.  <br/>
<br/>
Print your own diplomas!  They are probably at least as significant <br/>
as any other diploma.  Create your own transcripts, too, if you <br/>
want.  They may help get some into colleges.  Heck, just the fact <br/>
that you took the time to put transcripts together, probably with <br/>
much more information than any typical brick & mortar transcript, <br/>
should be enough to get you into most colleges.<br/>
