<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683869262">Remember when the moon was supposed to be eye-searingly bright, a couple of <br/>
years ago? yes, it was going to be closer, and so it would have more <br/>
brilliance, but not so much that we could actually tell the difference.<br/>

On a black field. Nothing at all like the highly detailed, mult-striped, <br/>
dark brown and maroon and cream pictures I&#39;ve seen from the Explorer space <br/>
craft. But it was still VERY cool. Awesome. Amazing. Seeing it live was <br/>
better than seeing the pictures of it, by a long shot, even though the <br/>
&quot;live&quot; view wasn&#39;t as visually exciting as the pictures.<br/>

&gt;Subject: RE: UNSCHOOLING OPPORTUNITY: Mars as big as moon duri...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Unfortunately, the original message is simply in error.  This *October*,<br/>
&gt;Mars will reach opposition with the Earth, and while it&#39;s a good <br/>
&gt;apparition,<br/>
&gt;August 2003 was quite a bit closer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And, to give you an idea of what all of this means in terms of observing<br/>
&gt;Mars, I pushed my telescope with a 16&quot; (40 cm) wide mirror to several<br/>
&gt;hundred power (I don&#39;t have my logs in front of me, so I&#39;m not sure what <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;exact power was), under PERFECT conditions, and I was able to discern a few<br/>
&gt;of the most prominent of Mars&#39; features.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bear in mind, too, that observational astronomy is very much a learned <br/>
&gt;skill<br/>
&gt;-- so where I could pick out features on Mars, a novice stepping to the<br/>
&gt;eyepiece for the first time might have seen little more than a smeary <br/>
&gt;orange<br/>
&gt;disk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t say this to discourage folks from observing Mars this fall -- but I<br/>
&gt;always hate to see people terribly disappointed when they are pumped up by<br/>
&gt;claims such as these, only to learn that, as is so often the case, there&#39;s<br/>
&gt;no easy shortcut to the most rewarding of experiences.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The availability of Hubble and other very high-quality images of a wide<br/>
&gt;variety of astronomical objects has made it all too common for a first-time<br/>
&gt;observer to expect to see what they&#39;ve found in books and magazines.  <br/>
&gt;You&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;see many beautiful things through a telescope, and many will become only<br/>
&gt;more beautiful as your skills improve, but you&#39;ll rarely get views that<br/>
&gt;compare to the photographs.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope this helps -- and please feel free to ask me any questions that may<br/>
&gt;come up about astronomical matters; I relish the experience of seeing <br/>
&gt;people<br/>
&gt;come to understand just how incredibly grand our universe is, and how much<br/>
&gt;they can learn about it with their own eyes.<br/>
