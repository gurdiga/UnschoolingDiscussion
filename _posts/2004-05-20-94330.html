<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373713148">Hey there.  For any others who have budding writers, I explored the <br/>
Teen Ink site just a bit... more info:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.teenink.com/">http://www.teenink.com/</a> is <br/>
the url.  They put out a print mag and book series - plus that <br/>
massive website.  All writing is done by teens ages 13-19.  There <br/>
are programs (example -they&#39;re advertising a writing workshop in <br/>
London at present).  The site has submission guidelines, <br/>
subscription info - all that good stuff.  <br/>
