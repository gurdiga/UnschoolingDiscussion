<br/>
Sand it lightly and wipe down with denatured alcohol. You want a clean, clean <br/>
surface for tiling. You can tile right over formica.<br/>
<br/>
There are books in the library about tiling. It&#39;s SOOOO easy! Mine is mostly <br/>
white counters with white grout. But in certain areas (over the range top, on <br/>
the backsplash above the sink, and in a small alcove where we keep the CD <br/>
player), I checker-boarded with green tiles. It&#39;s stunning!<br/>
<br/>
You can e-mail me for more tile-chatting-----or as Kathryn puts it----house <br/>
porn! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
