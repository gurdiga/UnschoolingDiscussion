<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747583587">Interesting article on the merits of Halloween in Christianity<br/>
Today:<br/>
<br/>
SNIP:<br/>
Christians should instead celebrate Halloween with gusto. If we<br/>
follow the traditional formula of having a good time at his<br/>
expense, Satan flees.<br/>
<br/>
In any event, I doubt the anti-Halloween party will prevail. This<br/>
tactic was tried before-with Christmas. In the 17th century,<br/>
because of its pagan ancestry and because it was a Roman Catholic<br/>
holiday (Christ-mass!), many Protestants decided that true<br/>
believers should not recognize Christmas. In 1620 our pilgrim<br/>
forefathers purposely started unloading the Mayflower on<br/>
Christmas Day to make the point to the crew that they were not<br/>
going to observe such an evil day.<br/>

stuff is<br/>

disquise...they just don&#39;t<br/>
