&lt;&lt; When I lost my dad, I was devastated. My thoughts and prayers go with you.<br/>
You will never stop missing him, but you will learn to live with it w/o<br/>
crying most of the time.<br/>
It&#39;s been almost twenty years and still I cry. Today is my dad&#39;s birthday. &gt;&gt;<br/>

My dad was great.  His brother died last year, my last favorite relative on <br/>
that side, my Uncle John.  He reminded me lots of my dad, and could always <br/>
tell me stories about my dad or when I was a baby.<br/>
<br/>
My dad died of arthritis and complications of medications when I was 24.  <br/>
That was too soon for me.  I missed him for a long time, especially when my <br/>
car broke or when I saw an old truck and didn&#39;t know what make it was or how <br/>
old it was.  My dad and I used to play guessing make and model of old pickups <br/>
we&#39;d meet on the highway.  He knew them all, and was teaching me, but I could <br/>
see better and sometimes identified one before he could see enough detail to <br/>
know.  It was a big thrill when he&#39;s say &quot;RIGHT!&quot; or &quot;CLOSE!  &#39;57.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My dad&#39;s name was Kirby Lynn Adams.  He went to WWII as a teenager, but the <br/>
war ended when he was on a ship on the way to France.  He served in the <br/>
occupation.  He was a welder, did metal buildings and trailers, and could fix <br/>
just about any  machine.  He couldn&#39;t read very well, and his writing was <br/>
hard to read.  He should&#39;ve been a lefty, but school wouldn&#39;t allow it.  He <br/>
was very talented in mechanical and spatial ways, and was healthy and strong <br/>
until arthritis (probably work related, from breathing (and ingesting and <br/>
being coated in) ground mica and sericite when he worked for a mining company <br/>
for a while, taking care of their machinery and trucks and building whatever <br/>
equipment they needed.<br/>
<br/>
I have lots of fond memories of time with my dad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-597274726">Thank you so much for bringing your dad to meet us.<br/>
<br/>
My dad was actually my step-dad. He & mom married when I was four. He<br/>
adopted me and used to say that I was his through and through. He was quiet,<br/>
hardworking, strong and funny! His sense of honor was amazing. He spoiled my<br/>
mom. He was devoted to her and me. He was crazy about my kids. He went far<br/>
to soon. I miss him still. His name was Harry Mooradian. His mom was a<br/>
survivor of the Armenian genocide. He was the best.<br/>
