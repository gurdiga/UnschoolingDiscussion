<div id="ygrps-yiv-305405459">HOLD ON CARRON!!!  @ 10 pm the weatherman said WE *SHOULD* HAVE RAIN<br/>
TOMORROW??? OR SATURDAY???!!!  so just keep your eye on the GULF!!!  YAH!!!<br/>
it only reached 96* today and felt GREAT, 15* LOWER than Tuesday&#39;s 111*!!!<br/>
AARRGGHH!!!<br/>
<br/>
the San Marcos, Guadulupe and Frio Rivers are still running, which I&#39;m SO<br/>
surprised they haven&#39;t dried up ... I saw a report that the Blanco River was<br/>
BONE DRY (I think it wsa the BR)???   AND SO MANY GRASS FIRES!!!  the<br/>
countryside is just PARCHED!!!  dh said he&#39;s really nervous b/c sparks from<br/>
the wheels of the train start fires all the time and MANY of the tankcars<br/>
are FLAMABLE materials; wellllllll great, that&#39;s just one more thing to<br/>
worry about while he&#39;s on the road :(<br/>
<br/>
btw ... since you are a Dallasonian do you know the name of the park/area<br/>
that has the dinosaur tracks located near Dallas???  we wanted to see this<br/>
next week but for the LIFE OF ME, I don&#39;t recall the name???  tia :)<br/>
<br/>
*YES*, we almost had to pull air out our sweaters from mothballs today b/c<br/>
it *only* reached 96*!!!  ohhhhh, it felt GREAT ... it&#39;s funny how just 15*<br/>
LOWER helps you keep your SANITY!!! :}<br/>
<br/>
Pris ~&gt; who&#39;ll be doing a HAPPY RAIN DANCE OF JOY tomorrow and who&#39;z JUMPING<br/>
EACH TIME THE PHONE RINGS b/c THIS CALL COULD BE *THE CALL* ABOUT THE<br/>
G-BABY???!!!<br/>

&gt; OOh, you promise so much. . .My, my, it hasn&#39;t rained here in Dallas since<br/>
&gt; June 30th.  That&#39;s something like 70 days.  I really want to go tubing in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Hill Country, but I don&#39;t think they have any rivers left down there.<br/>
(Hey,<br/>
&gt; Pris -- you&#39;re in San Antonio, aren&#39;t you?  Isn&#39;t there someone else on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; list who&#39;s down round there in the Hill Country?)  Anything you&#39;d like to<br/>
&gt; ship down would be greatly appreciated.  Either that or a recipe for a<br/>
rain<br/>
&gt; dance.<br/>
