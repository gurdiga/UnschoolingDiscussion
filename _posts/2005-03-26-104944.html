<div id="ygrps-yiv-557650317">IMPORTANT MESSAGE ABOUT FORMATTING POSTS.<br/>
Sample:<br/>
<br/>
In a  message dated 3/25/2005 9:03:02 AM Pacific Standard Time,  <br/>

-=-But since unschooling is about being  mindful and respectful I think we  <br/>
have <br/>
to respect people,  animals and the earth as well.=-<br/>
<br/>
Something will come first.  One  priority will be greater than the  other.  <br/>
Too many children  fall by the wayside while their own parents  vainly try to <br/>
save OTHER  people&#39;s children on other continents.<br/>
I couldn&#39;t agree more. Again, this  is not how I operate. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I wrote the first part.  I also wrote the middle part.<br/>
I didn&#39;t write the end part.<br/>
 <br/>
Moderators have returned posts because it was impossible to tell who wrote  <br/>
what.<br/>
 <br/>
Each quote should be marked, at least with &quot;this&quot; and maybe something  <br/>
stronger **stars** or -=-lines-=- or something.<br/>
 <br/>
Put spaces between paragraphs, please.<br/>
 <br/>
ALSO!  Trim posts!  Some have been returned to the writer for  having two or <br/>
three whole long posts appended as quotes to a one-paragraph  response.<br/>
 <br/>
Look at your post before hitting send, please, and try to make it as clear  <br/>
to the readers as possible, in its format.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
