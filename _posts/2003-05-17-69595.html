&lt;&lt;Do those of you who have frequent access to chlorine treated pools<br/>
(and have children with blond hair) have any remedies for preventing<br/>
or treating green hair?  Every summer my boys&#39; hair turns bright<br/>
green from their grandmother&#39;s pool, and it bothers them.  I thought<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not the chlorine but the metals in the pool water. Mostly copper I<br/>
think. Your grandmother can go to the same pool supply place where she gets<br/>
the chlorine from and ask for something to take out the metals in the water.<br/>
As far as how to get rid of it once it&#39;s in the hair, I hear there are<br/>
shampoos out there for getting rid of swimmers hair. I haven&#39;t seen them but<br/>
haven&#39;t reallyhad to look either. &lt;bg&gt; Maybe behind the pharmacy counter or<br/>
something. I have also heard that you can wash the hair with warm water that<br/>
has aspirin dissolved in it. Not sure how much though. Reducing the metals<br/>
though will take care of the problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-509694953">My daughter has blond hair and during the summer swims almost every day.  We had a real problem with green hair a few years ago and tried the swimmer&#39;s shampoos that are supposed to help with that.  It did help, but I&#39;ve noticed that now she washes her hair after each swim with regular shampoo and the green hasn&#39;t come back.  So maybe it&#39;s just washing that does the trick.  I&#39;ve realized now that when the hair turned green she wasn&#39;t washing it on a regular basis after swimming.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it must have something to do with the chlorination system itself. I<br/>
have blonde hair and was on swim team in college, swimming for about 2<br/>
hours, twice a day. My hair bleached completely white, but never turned<br/>
green. My son has white-blonde hair that never turns green either, but then<br/>
we only swim in public pools and the pool at our club. I know that public<br/>
pools do a pretty good check (in general) to keep the chlorine levels<br/>
correct and the PH balanced. Maybe their grandmother&#39;s pool has some sort of<br/>
imbalance? I might call and ask a pool supplies store.<br/>
<br/>
My second thought is just to use a good anti-chlorine shampoo and<br/>
conditioner afterwards. They even make some no-tears ones for kids now that<br/>
are quite good.<br/>

some extent.  My boys have blond hair and we have a pool and have trouble <br/>
with that as well.<br/>
Let me know if you find something that really works.<br/>

Let&#39;s get one thing straight, right off the bat. We do not allow grey <br/>
hairs to dwell upon our noble heads. No. None of that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Only silver will do.<br/>

Please repeat after me &quot;There is no grey, only silver. There is no <br/>

Nexus makes a product called Aloe Rid that comes in both a shampoo and a treatment. You might can find a generic form at beauty supplies but anyplace that sells nexus will most likely have it.<br/>
Works pretty good. I use it before any perm because it helps to take out medications, hard water {well water} and anything that builds up in the hair.<br/>

 <br/>
Someone mentioned the green hair coming from copper; copper is the <br/>
metal base in the super green algecide that is needed to maintain <br/>
pool water. If a pool is out of chemical balance (ph/alk), the <br/>
algecide can leave more residue than normal too. Chlorine is NOT <br/>
what turns the hair green...but chlorine will bleach the hair <br/>
strands and eventually the strands become brittle over the summer. <br/>
This allows the copper to access the hair faster. Monthly hair trims <br/>
will help. This keeps the hair shaft closed and the strand will <br/>
absorb less chemical of any type. There is a treatment that the <br/>
grandmother needs to buy for the pool; it would be called &quot;Metal <br/>
Free&quot; or &quot;Metal Control&quot;. She can also start using an algecide that <br/>
is not metal based but must still detox her current pool water.<br/>
<br/>
Something else....we often blame chlorine for burning eyes, actually <br/>
the PH of the water is the culprit...and then too, more than a few <br/>
hours of swimming is going to irritate the eye no matter what. :)<br/>
<br/>
If children will rinse off after swimming with a very gentle shampoo <br/>
of any kind and use a natural eye lubricant, that will prevent dry <br/>
skin, damaged hair, and help with the red eyes.</div>

through my hair.  It is very short and they like the way it feels in the <br/>
back.  Anyway my youngest said &quot;Mom, you have a lot of gray hairs...oh and <br/>
