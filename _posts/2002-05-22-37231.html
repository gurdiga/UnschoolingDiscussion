<div id="ygrps-yiv-180781467">As you may or may not know, there is currently a new homeschooling law<br/>
proposed in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.  I belong to a<br/>
group that, among other things, is gathering data concerning how the<br/>
current law works (or does not work) in practice for people in all of<br/>
the different school districts of Pennsylvania.  If you are a<br/>
Pennsylvania home educator and could take a moment of your time to fill<br/>
out the form below, it would really help all homeschoolers know what the<br/>
state of affairs is in Pennsylvania school districts.  Please forward<br/>
the completed form to the addy indicated and feel free to forward the<br/>
form to any other Pennsylvania home educators you may know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much.<br/>
