<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052707949">To anyone and everyone,<br/>
I am changing my email address. I was wondering if I<br/>
have to sign up again as a new member with my new<br/>
email address or is there some way to change my<br/>
address in the groups management section? I had a go<br/>
and couldn&#39;t get anywhere with it. It would let me ADD<br/>
another address but I couldn&#39;t seem to change it. Am I<br/>
missing something? Thanks in advance for any help on<br/>
this.<br/>

I can change you if you want.  <br/>
<br/>
Let me know the old one and the new one (unless you manage to do it yourself) <br/>
and I&#39;ll just edit you within our group.<br/>
