<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424268765">My son ate - mashed potato,very little meat, (no vegies no fruit)<br/>
pancakes - yorkshire puddings - and weetbix with milk and sugar. Oh <br/>
and tomato sauce sandwhiches.<br/>
Every thing else except his weetbix, had tomato sauce on.......I once <br/>
made him eat some thing he didnt like and he vomited - I never did <br/>
that again.<br/>
My son is now 31yrs old.  He is a strong healthy father of 2.  He <br/>
still eats his weetbix every day - he now will eat vegies and fruit <br/>
too!<br/>
