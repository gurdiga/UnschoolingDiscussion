<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062594080">My name is Roni.  I homeschool our three boys who are: almost nine, six and<br/>
a half, and almost four.  My little one has Down syndrome and finding<br/>
materials and ideas has been a challenge.  I would like to know if anyone<br/>
on this list has experience homeschooling a special needs child.  We are<br/>
currently what you would call &quot;relaxed&quot; homeschoolers.  I really want to<br/>
learn more about unschooling and how you do it.  I would really like to get<br/>
rid of all the &quot;busy work&quot; but don&#39;t really understand what to replace it<br/>
with.  I&#39;m sorry to appear so naive but I really do want to change our<br/>
methods at home and need some help to do it.  We have an organic garden out<br/>
back which the children have really enjoyed planting, picking and eating in<br/>
addition to observing all kinds of insects and caterpillars.  We got to see<br/>
the complete cycle of the Black Swallowtail butterfly just by observation<br/>
in our own little backyard, that was pretty neat!  The back of our house<br/>
has a little woods behind it and we saw a beautiful red fox the other day<br/>
right at the back of our fence.  I think he wanted to eat the rabbit!  I<br/>
have the Charlotte Mason series and like her ideas.  I just bought Simply<br/>
Grammar to do with my two eldest.  My six year old just finished all his<br/>
books he was doing in his language arts program and I was looking for<br/>
something to teach him that didn&#39;t include doing all that book work.  I<br/>
would appreciate any ideas you might have.  Both my older boys are<br/>
voracious readers and read several grade levels higher than their age.  I<br/>
am currently looking at materials for next year ( I like to plan ahead) and<br/>
would like to know what all you guys use to teach different subjects.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-839712505">Welcome, Roni!  I&#39;m Tracy, my children are 5 and nearly-<br/>
4yo, and I live in Yorkshire.  As far as tackling <br/>
different subjects and planning materials goes, well I <br/>
don&#39;t.  For me, unschooling is about living and not <br/>
thinking too much about learning this or that in any <br/>
particular order or way.  I trust my children to learn <br/>
what they need to when they need to.  Now, this can be <br/>
very difficult to get one&#39;s head round, most of us <br/>
(about 99% I think!) have been brought up at least <br/>
nominally, even if folk skived as much as me, within <br/>
the institutional school system.  So it&#39;s kind-of hard <br/>
not to think about maths or science or English and just <br/>
get on with what we want to do. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there will be others more eloquent than me who <br/>
can describe unschooling, in all its myriad forms.  For <br/>
me, it&#39;s about living.<br/>
