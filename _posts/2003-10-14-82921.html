<br/>
		<br/>
* Dark Side of Home Schooling *<br/>
<br/>
(CBS) National News is scheduled a two-part series on the “dark side of<br/>
home schooling.” From their website “Homeschooling has produced some<br/>
brilliant young minds but there&#39;s a dark side to the movement that is<br/>
putting children&#39;s lives at risk. A special Eye on America investigation<br/>
only on Monday&#39;s CBS Evening News.” The following is from home school<br/>
leaders in North Carolina: “Following discussions that Hal Young, the<br/>
president of NCHE (North Carolina Home Educators), had on Friday with<br/>
the CBS Evening News producer, it is anticipated that CBS will be<br/>
running a 2 part series on Monday & Tuesday evening on Homeschooling<br/>
(The report is already complete, but be mindful that other news may<br/>
possibly preempt it). “This report is expected to focus on the handful<br/>
of child abuse cases over the past 5 to 10 years involving ‘presumed<br/>
homeschoolers’ including the murder/suicide of ‘Non homeschooled<br/>
homeschoolers’ in Johnston County, NC two years ago. The CBS reporters<br/>
will be highlighting various murders, suicides, etc. involving<br/>
‘homeschoolers’ nationwide and will attempt to argue that ‘Homeschooling<br/>
is out of control’. The woman producer stated directly to Hal that he<br/>
‘would not be pleased with the report’, and that the intent of the<br/>
report is to encourage further state and federal government regulation<br/>
of homeschooling.” THSC will take a proactive position on this issue, as<br/>
we have in the past. Texas home schoolers should be aware of this issue<br/>
and be prepared to respond. Following are some points that should be<br/>
made concerning filicide and home schooling. * Filicide is not rare.<br/>
According to the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI filicide is not<br/>
uncommon. In fact, an article by the Houston Chronicle in 2001, made the<br/>
same point. (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/topstory/950318)">http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/topstory/950318)</a> *<br/>
Homeschooling has grown dramatically over the last twenty-five years,<br/>
but filicide has decreased or is flat; it has not increased. Therefore,<br/>
it would seem that there is no connection. * While filicide is not<br/>
uncommon, it appears that the education of the children is rarely an<br/>
issue unless the family is home schooling. A specific Texas example is<br/>
the case of Darlie Routier in Rowlett, near Dallas, a few years ago. In<br/>
that high profile case, the mother was convicted of murdering two of her<br/>
three sons while her husband slept. The education of the children was<br/>
never an issue. As this issue is raised, Texas home school leaders<br/>
should stay on message with the points above and maintain that everyone<br/>
is horrified at every instance of filicide, but this is not an education<br/>
issue. Those who support state regulation of home education should not<br/>
use such travesties to support a political agenda.<br/>
