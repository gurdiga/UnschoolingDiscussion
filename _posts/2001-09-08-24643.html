talented... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Talent is inborn.  It can be encouraged and nurtured, but it can&#39;t be<br/>
created.  It can be squished and destroyed, but unschooling won&#39;t do that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The whole time I was growing up, all I heard from my parents was &quot;get good<br/>
grades, go to college, and get a good job.&quot;  My true interests were squashed<br/>
because &quot;college prep&quot; kids didn&#39;t take those courses.  I had to take what<br/>
they wanted me to take.  Period.  (I was a shy wallflower type back then who<br/>
didn&#39;t argue with &quot;authority&quot;).  Went to college, rediscovered my squashed<br/>
passion, got my doctorate, and now created my own job :).<br/>
<br/>
However, a girl I grew up with was very mediocre academically.  Her passion<br/>
was art, and while she survived school, her grades weren&#39;t very good.  When<br/>
finally &quot;released&quot; (graduated) she was able to attend art school, and was<br/>
able to make a living at art.  She became a graphics designer and with a<br/>
partner, started a graphics design studio in NYC.  Sold it a few years later<br/>
and is now a multimillionaire.<br/>
<br/>
Who was more successful academically (and valued by society?)  Me.<br/>
<br/>
Who is more successful financially (and valued by society?)  She is.<br/>
<br/>
Who is doing what they&#39;re passionate about and making a living at it?  We<br/>
both are.<br/>
<br/>
This is what I want for my kids.  Follow their passions, wherever they lead.<br/>
If it&#39;s college, great.  If it&#39;s an apprenticeship, great.  Whatever it is<br/>
I&#39;ll support them 100%, whether or not relative (or society) thinks their<br/>
pursuits are worthwhile or not or feels they are &quot;wasting their lives&quot; by<br/>
not choosing college.<br/>
<br/>
I only enjoyed college when I studied what I wanted.  The guidance<br/>
counselors didn&#39;t know what to make of the freshman biology major who wanted<br/>
to take Survey of Latin American Literature. :).  But there are lots of<br/>
people in college who don&#39;t want to be there, have a major they don&#39;t want<br/>
(society or family or whatever said it would be a good degree to have), and<br/>
they are wasting their time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-623591459">thank you Janet...you are so right..I love hat unschooling<br/>
frees a child to be who she wants to be, that is almost<br/>
foreign to me.  Since I&#39;ve become a mom though, I&#39;m taking<br/>
hold of my indepent thinking and I&#39;m not wanting to let go!<br/>
