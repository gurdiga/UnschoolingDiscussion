<div id="ygrps-yiv-676357239">My oldest daughter has always been a short term kinda girl. She has played 4 <br/>
instruments, been a writer, and even dabbled in various arts like dance, <br/>
painting, and photography. And (drum roll please)<br/>
She is now passionately perusing photography. After putting all of her <br/>
savings into an expensive camera, she is obsessed with photography. And <br/>
she&#39;s great! Here are a few stock photo&#39;s she took. What do you think??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Much Love,<br/>
Wildflower<br/>

but they don&#39;t come across in emails.<br/>
