&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi Tanya,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just had to ask, do all pet turtles smell or has yours died?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really don&#39;t know the answer to that! the kids found it and put it in a<br/>
tank, put some dirty rocks in it, and put a bit of water in it, but I think<br/>
the clencher was someone poured some fish food into it!!! I think that is<br/>
what the stench was!  anyway we took him down to the stream and released him<br/>
back into the wild!!!!! that was the plan here anyway, we just wanted to<br/>
observe him for a few days  whew!! glad that smell is out of here, now the<br/>
rats can breathe! (three in tanks next to turtle tank!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484491883">You don&#39;t need to change the water for turtles on a daily basis unless you<br/>
have them in too small a space.  You need what is called a pond filter<br/>
(large sponge with jet head).  With a pond filter in place you do a partial<br/>
removal of water once a week and wash the sponge and head.  We&#39;ve had<br/>
Tennessee Tuxedo (Western Pond turtle) and Sweet Pea (Red-eared Slider) for<br/>
about 10 years now and no smell.  They are in a 45 gallon tank with a<br/>
divider in it for their land area.  Works great and makes a sort of natural<br/>
habitat for them with smooth stones and plants in the land end and various<br/>
rocks for &quot;standing on in the water end.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734785589">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
All this talk of the amazing things you guys can see in the wild and/or keep<br/>
as pets is making me extremely jealous! In New Zealand we only find rats,<br/>
mice, rabbits, hedgehogs, possums, frogs and skinks outside. Red-eared<br/>
turtles are a pet shop item and very expensive. I remember someone on this<br/>
list (I think) posting something about a bear in the neighbourhood. We have<br/>
been watching heaps of videos lately about elephants (I don&#39;t suppose any of<br/>
you keep those!), big cats, otters, wolves, foxes and bears. We can&#39;t really<br/>
imagine living in places where any of these are seen outside a zoo.<br/>

That sounds great to be so close to all those animals.  To be able to catch <br/>
glimpses of them in the wild or to hear them.  We&#39;ve had visitors before <br/>
that really blessed us.  A little racoon was with us for a time.  It was too <br/>
cute.  And was so great for our family to be able to touch and observe it <br/>
just being itself.  We&#39;ve been bird-sitters before.  And I would love to be <br/>
able to get one or two of my own.  I am so thrilled at the uniqueness of all <br/>
of creation.  Each person has their own unique personality and animals do as <br/>
well.  Even little snakes and lizards.  We currently have one pet...a <br/>
Rottweiler.  She&#39;s a year and a half and she&#39;s an indoor pet.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
seen a dog be so human!  She is our baby and she knows it.  She revels in <br/>
her place in our family.  She&#39;s a real joy to us.  She&#39;s the sweetest, <br/>
puppy-head dog.  The kids and I have talked about other pets we&#39;d like to <br/>
have; but we feel like our Rotty is enough for now.  :)<br/>
