&lt;&lt; Since the subject of nursing has come up, I wonder if anyone else is<br/>
 having a problem with very frequent night time nursing?  My 16 mo. old<br/>
 wakes up to nurse every 2-3 hours every night like clockwork , and I am<br/>
 getting so tired I&#39;m afraid to get behind the wheel to drive anywhere &gt;&gt;<br/>

Amy, you sound really tired! My ben nursed so much between age 1 and 2, which <br/>
is the  age of your child.  I was tempted to do some of the &quot;interventions&quot; <br/>
(no num nums till the sun is up), but i KNEW he would not go for it.  <br/>
Sometimes with night nursing i would unlatch him half asleep after a few <br/>
minutes of nursing, and he would go for it and roll over.  This way, i would <br/>
get back into deep sleep quicker.<br/>
