 </span></blockquote>We use something like this outside. I have a limit of 2-4 toys that can be <br/>
outside at a time. It used to be 2, but ds loves to make &quot;trains&quot; out of <br/>
them, so he needs riding truck, tricycle, and wagon for that...<br/>
<br/>
But then if he wants his dump truck and wheel loader, he has to bring two in.<br/>

&lt;&lt; toddlers, he suggests a toy library concept. The child can play with one <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889647656">That&#39;s why we settled on the one room at a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; time concept.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a great idea! I just talked to my kids about it and they like it<br/>
too.<br/>
I said you can play with as much as you want in your bedroom, but it has to<br/>
be completly picked up before you start playing in the livingroom. They<br/>
agreed! Hooray!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Parenting author John Rosemond suggests that no kid should have more<br/>
toys<br/>
&gt; &gt; than he or she can put away and take care of. It&#39;s unfair to expect a<br/>
kid to<br/>
&gt; &gt; clean up a room covered wall-to-wall with toys, games, pieces of toys,<br/>
etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He says the right number of toys is probably about 10. That&#39;s right, 10<br/>
&gt; &gt; toys!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For toddlers, he suggests a toy library concept. The child can play with<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; &gt; toy at a time. When he wants another toy, he brings you what he has. You<br/>
&gt; &gt; trade it for a new one. Nothing gets left out.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I thought about that when we were revising things around here.  But then I<br/>
&gt; watched how they play.  They drive their cars up to the dinosaurs and then<br/>
&gt; on top of the dinosaurs.  They build things with Duplos and then put the<br/>
&gt; cars in their structures etc.  They can take bins from one room to another<br/>
(like the play food<br/>
&gt; so the cars and dinosaurs and babies can eat).  So far it is working but<br/>
&gt; I did consider the one toy at a time concept.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mine are 5 and 3 in two weeks and 2 days. I&#39;m not sure either one is a<br/>
&gt; toddler any longer.<br/>
