<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823929326">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
The moderator of the Unschooling-Discussion group has changed the group&#39;s name.<br/>
This means that both the group&#39;s email address and the group home page<br/>
location have changed.<br/>
<br/>
The group email address:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
The group home page location:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion</a><br/>
<br/>
If you have links which point to this group or an address book entry<br/>
for the group, you should update them, as the old addresses will no<br/>
longer work.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
<br/>
