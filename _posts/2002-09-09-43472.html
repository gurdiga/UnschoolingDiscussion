the computer running and it was some sort of online game called &quot;Boob City&quot; <br/>
or something like that. The game was something like Candyland -- only you <br/>
navigated all over the different screens that were filled with places like <br/>
&quot;big breast mountains.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My sister and I kind of thought there was a bit of humor to it. And it was an <br/>
understandable interest, he had girlfriends by that time but hadn&#39;t been <br/>
going beyond holding hands and maybe an arm around. Definitely something on <br/>
his mind, though.<br/>
<br/>
However, she still talked with him about the way the game portrayed women and <br/>
their body parts as objects and how he felt about that and so on....<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And sometimes it helps to have the kind of language you&#39;re using pointed out. <br/>
The term &quot;monitoring&quot; has a tone to it that most unschooling parents would <br/>
not use, in my own experience. If someone asked me if I &quot;monitored&quot; my kids <br/>
eating, for example, I&#39;d say no. But am I with them and aware of what they&#39;re <br/>
eating and do I fix them good nutritious foods and notice if they&#39;ve eaten <br/>
junky food all day and are getting cranky maybe because of it and do I <br/>
introduce them to interesting new foods just for the fun of it and so on? <br/>
Yes. But I would never have thought to call all that: &quot;monitoring their <br/>
food.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - the use of the term may or may not mean anything about how the person <br/>
using it is really interacting with their kids -- but the fact that a bunch <br/>
of unschoolers responded to it in a certain way might encourage the original <br/>
user of the word to reconsider whether &quot;monitoring&quot; is really something they <br/>
want to be doing.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, I still keep up with what my 18 yo is doing. If I don&#39;t hear from her <br/>
all day long - she&#39;s off with friends and stuff - I call her cell phone and <br/>
just say, &quot;Hi -- how are you doing?&quot; She&#39;s agreeable and happy to talk to me <br/>
-- &quot;Hi, Mom -- we&#39;re down at the beach and so-and-so has his guitar and it is <br/>
beautiful down here.&quot; OR &quot;I&#39;m miserable and I hate my life and I have nothing <br/>
to do and soandso and I are just bored to tears.&quot; Or whatever -- (this is a <br/>
kid with big mood swings). <br/>
<br/>
But if I thought of that as &quot;monitoring&quot; what she was doing, if that came <br/>
across to her, she&#39;d be appalled - I don&#39;t think of it that way at all.<br/>
<br/>
It might be useful to think about &quot;monitoring&quot; a teenager as something they&#39;d <br/>
resent.<br/>
<br/>
Take it as the point of view of the parent of two teens. &quot;Monitoring&quot; would <br/>
not go over well with my independent unschooled kids.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I think three is a really hard age.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The most challenging time I&#39;ve had with my oldest child (who is now 14 1/2) <br/>
was when he was 3 1/2 to 4 1/2.  He had so much energy and didn&#39;t know what <br/>
to do with it all.  I used to think it was because I was pregnant with my <br/>
daughter, and then it was her first half year of life, so I didn&#39;t have as <br/>
much attention for him.  I still think that was part of it, but not all.  <br/>
<br/>
My youngest one is now 3 1/2.  He&#39;s adorable, energetic, imaginative - and <br/>
very challenging.  My older son, who is normally *very* patient with his <br/>
younger brother, has even gotten irritated with him lately.  Some days, it <br/>
seems like I&#39;m the only one with any patience left for him - and I&#39;m working <br/>
*really* hard at it &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
As far as what to do with 2 little ones?  If you can - time one on one helps <br/>
- either getting someone to stay with one while you do things with the other <br/>
(and I know this isn&#39;t always possible - I&#39;m lucky to have a mother who lives <br/>
an hour away), or maybe shifting bedtimes slightly so that you can do things <br/>
with one before the other one wakes up, and reversing in the evening.  My <br/>
days with my 3 1/2 yo go much better if I set my alarm early and the two of <br/>
us spend time together before the others get up.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an easy age, though, and no solution will be perfect.<br/>
