Hi Dar,<br/>
<br/>
How&#39;s Nana?  Actually, it was part of one of my posts from the unschooling<br/>
list.  Not sure what this poster&#39;s intent was.  But hey......I&#39;ve been<br/>
quoted!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess we&#39;ll have to wait for the OP to give more info... it&#39;s good to<br/>
hear from you, what&#39;s new?<br/>
<br/>
Nana is doing really well, she&#39;s actually sitting on the couch beside me<br/>
as I type - my hand is moving, so it clearly needs a dog to pet. We got a<br/>
geriatric chocolate lab a few months ago to complete our dog-family,<br/>
since Nana at that point had decided that she was *my* dog. As it turned<br/>
out, Nana really enjoys dog-company and has made many dog-friends,<br/>
although Keith, our new dog, is a lab and therefore believes he&#39;s really<br/>
a person, and tends to prefer to socialize with people rather than dogs.<br/>
Anyway, Nana seemed to learn a lot about how dogs should act by watching<br/>
Keith, so now she&#39;s much more bonded to Rain from following Keith&#39;s<br/>
example with her. It&#39;s all been very interesting to watch...<br/>
<br/>
Nana is still cautious in new situations but she&#39;s much faster at warming<br/>
up, and if someone new takes a couple of minutes to talk to her gently<br/>
she&#39;ll generally go over to that person and ask to be petted. She&#39;s<br/>
pretty good at basic obedience, although she does a very deferential<br/>
&quot;come&quot; where she won&#39;t come right to my front but curves off to the<br/>
side... and &quot;down&quot; makes her nervous.. but she can do the more unusual<br/>
stuff like &quot;go to bed&quot; (her crate) when I tell her to, even from 2 rooms<br/>
away, and &quot;drop it&quot;, shouted across a field when she finds some farm<br/>
worker&#39;s leftover lunch (Keith, OTOH, pretends he&#39;s gone temporarily deaf<br/>
until he gobbles it all up... and during tomato season, during every walk<br/>
he gobbled 3 or 4 squashed tomatoes that had fallen from the trucks). We<br/>
were playing around with some search and rescue training... we&#39;ve<br/>
discovered that she really likes pepperoni, so we use those for treats.<br/>
She&#39;s getting there... with Keith, he learns fast but he doesn&#39;t do well<br/>
learning things that require him to actually figure somehting out... with<br/>
Nana, she can almost read my mind, but anything new makes her nervous, so<br/>
it takes time...<br/>
<br/>
We did mean to send photos, but she still gets nervous when I aim a<br/>
camera at her. Actually, I took some non-digital photos and still need to<br/>
get them developed, is your address the same?<br/>
