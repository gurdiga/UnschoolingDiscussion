<div id="ygrps-yiv-953098712">Hello,<br/>
 I am new to this group and have a question I wonder if someone can <br/>
help me with. A little background...<br/>
 I have home-schooled my son on and off through the years at his <br/>
request. When he has wanted to go to school, I have let him, and when <br/>
he wanted to home school I did. <br/>
 He started the new school year (10th grade) at our very small, rural <br/>
highschool (aprox. 100 high school students). He has now decided that <br/>
he wants to just &quot;finish&quot; school at home and get on with &quot;real <br/>
life&quot;.  <br/>
  He tests at 11 grade level. He just turned 16, but is quite mature <br/>
for his age. He wants to learn Blacksmithing and welding as <br/>
his &quot;career&quot;.<br/>
  My question is...YIKES...what do I do now??? He wants to just study <br/>
at the library, and shadow a gentleman in our community that does <br/>
this kind of work. My gut says to just let him do as he wants, that <br/>
he is old enough to figure this out. My family think I&#39;m nuts and <br/>
that he&#39;ll just become a drop-out kid. Any advise or thoughts? I&#39;d <br/>
sure appreciate it.<br/>
 Thanks so much in advance.<br/>

How can he be a drop out kid if he is at home? Sounds like an awesome life <br/>
experience! Even if he does not choose to do that for his career he will always <br/>
have it as a back up. <br/>
We have a man that lives across the street from us that does this kind of <br/>
work.  I attended a town meeting with my son where he was asking for a permit to <br/>
build a steel building to grow his business. Turns out the guy makes parts for <br/>
antique cars or what ever design a customer wants. He has customers from all <br/>
over the world and is quite famous and none of us even knew about him or what <br/>
he did.<br/>

<br/>
Well, my first reaction is what in the world could be wrong with this scenario? He wants to &quot;finish&quot; highschool--get his GED, I presume? There can&#39;t be anything wrong there--no burning of bridges. This sounds like unschooling at it&#39;s best to me: your child formed a plan, figured out how to implement that plan, and now he&#39;s asking you to help facilitate that plan.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Shadow&quot; someone sounds an awful lot like an internship or apprenticeship to me. Again, sounds like a very intelligent thing to do. He&#39;ll find out soon enough if it&#39;s not what he wants to do, and if it is, he&#39;ll be following his own path and passion. What could be wrong with that? <br/>
<br/>
Seriously, there is just no reason for young adults to be forced to do school and bide their time until social standards say it&#39;s acceptable for them to take control of their lives. I lament the passing of the apprentice system in America, though I don&#39;t romanticize it. There were lots of things about it that weren&#39;t all that great when kids as young as seven were sent away from their families to become (often) indentured servants. But we&#39;ve moved so far away from creating a sensible apprentice system that we shuffle kids from highschool to college simply because it&#39;s &quot;what they should be doing.&quot;  We under-value useful, practical trades and over-value a smattering of often useless and unconnected &quot;knowledge.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
People often use the plumber example to talk about monetary success: if a person became a plumber straight out of highschool, s/he would likely be in a better position financially than many (if not most) college educated kids who too often come out of school under-trained and seriously in debt. The plumber would have control over his own life, would likely be able to make his own hours and would have a trade that allowed him to work to live, not live to work.<br/>
<br/>
Your son sounds like he knows what he wants, has goals for how to get there, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll come up with another plan if this doesn&#39;t work out. He&#39;ll be able to recognize whether he wants to devote the next however many years to learning and practicing this craft without being an indentured servant--either to the blacksmith, society or higher education.<br/>
<br/>
Just my $.02<br/>

<br/>
For one thing, maybe you could just let him be a drop-out kid! <br/>
Can he take a GED yet in your state?<br/>
<br/>
Or sign him up to homeschool, tell them he&#39;s majoring in blacksmithing and <br/>
metal arts, and that he has not dropped out, he&#39;s moved to something more real.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s old enough to take a GED where you are, maybe he could do that and <br/>
then nobody could say a word.  He wouldn&#39;t need to be a homeschooler OR a drop <br/>
out.  He would be done.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe he would feel better considering himself a homeschooler until he&#39;s <br/>
18 or 19, and it might give you and him a chance to have a whole new and <br/>
different relationship.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;shadow a gentleman in our community that does <br/>
<br/>
this kind of work.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is this guy willing to take him as an assistant or apprentice maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Is there a trades school in your area that has any classes involving metals <br/>
that your son might be interested in?  (That&#39;s not one of my top <br/>
recommendations, but it&#39;s something that might appease relatives and he might be interested. <br/>
 Welding, or machining, or casting maybe?   In northern New Mexico there are <br/>
a couple of forges where things are cast from wax.  Big sculptures.   And I <br/>
have a brother-in-law doing large welded sculptures, which never pass through a <br/>
wax stage, but are steel from the beginning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881269287">I grew up knowing a man who was a blacksmith, he was so happy in his profession, lived well into his 90&#39;s and became a mentor to others who wanted to learn a dying art.<br/>
<br/>
He provided well for his family and was an inspiration to many.  I think your son has shown incredible confidence and self-motivation.  I would be thrilled to see my own son take this path.<br/>
