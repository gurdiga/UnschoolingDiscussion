How did you pinpoint your specific allergies?  I have MAJOR suger cravings<br/>
and processed carbo cravings.  My niece was recently diagnosed with PCOS<br/>
(poly-cystene-ovarian syndrome).  They told her the underlying cause was<br/>
insulin resistance.  And that her condition is most certainly genetic.  I<br/>
seem to have many of the conditions of this syndrome.....just thinking about<br/>
exploring this.<br/>
<br/>
Also,  my 1 yr old son has had excema from the get-go.  Where have people<br/>
gotten info regarding realtionship with food.  He&#39;s breastfed,  could my<br/>
diet effect his excema?<br/>
Susan,  who has been able to establish relatively healthy disciplines for<br/>
most things,  but cannot seem to control sugar/carb cravings in the least.<br/>
<br/>
My &quot;old man Physician&quot; explained in very technical terms about allergies<br/>
and how they can (in some cases but not all) often cause cravings similar<br/>
to an alcoholics craving for booze.  I forget now the reasons behind it,<br/>
but I know from experience that it can be true.  He also warned me to be<br/>
expecially careful with the alcohol I drank.  I am allergic to corn and<br/>
crave it.  I also come from a family with a high history of alcoholism.<br/>
He said I should stay far away from  corn-mash bourbons.  I did, but<br/>
mostly because I have tastes for other things and don&#39;t drink much<br/>
anyway.<br/>
