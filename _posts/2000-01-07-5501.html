<div id="ygrps-yiv-66930177">I apologize for the upset I caused, wasn&#39;t pointing any fingers, at anyone, and didn&#39;t mean to come across with a &#39;tude.  <br/>
<br/>
I dislike flame wars and to tell the truth, have never been in one before now.  It just seemed more wrong to say nothing than to say something in defense of my religion.  It saddens me to see such scorn of a truly beautiful faith.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I offended anyone with my opinions.<br/>
<br/>
God bless us all anyway.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-923564309">Well, I guess we all missed that one.  I am on other lists that are a real<br/>
mix of folks and we have discussions all the time about religion without<br/>
any problem.  But, it doesn&#39;t start off assuming everyone is a certain<br/>
religion.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I went back and read my original post and I guess, not being face to<br/>
face, the first part came off too strong.  I was passing on a warning that<br/>
a lawyer posted on a another list (actually, his was a threat) that it is<br/>
not legal to post complete articles without posting that you have the<br/>
author&#39;s permission, that you can &quot;snip&quot; and then link but not post the<br/>
whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
As to the comments on the article, that had to do with the person writing<br/>
the article and had nothing to do with religion, just his manipulation of<br/>
Biblical verse to suit his personal opinions.  that can hardly be called a<br/>
flame war of an attack on religion, not by any stretch of the imagination!<br/>
