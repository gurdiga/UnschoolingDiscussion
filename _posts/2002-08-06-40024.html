are you in&quot; &quot;what&#39;s your favorite subject&quot; (her reply: everything. but I <br/>
hate math!). Must figure out a way to deflect these insane questions and <br/>
fixation on my childrens grade placement and mastery of skills!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe she doesn&#39;t really have a good grasp of what the word &quot;math&quot; means. It <br/>
might seem foreign and mysterious to her. Or she&#39;s heard from other kids or <br/>
on TV that math is hard and to be avoided.<br/>
<br/>
Casey used to say math was too hard for her all the time. One day Conor and <br/>
I started talking about all the ways she uses math everyday, but without <br/>
using the word math until the very end. We talked about how she likes <br/>
measuring the ingredients for baking, figuring out how much money she has, <br/>
counting the cookies left in the bag and splitting them evenly between her <br/>
and Conor, figuring out how many minutes left till Rugrats or how many <br/>
inches she&#39;s grown since we last measured, etc. At the end Conor said <br/>
&quot;That&#39;s all math is you know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah - well that is VERY cool and, in fact, with Luz&#39;s permission I&#39;m already <br/>
handing out copies at the Sacramento conference. I just thought there was an <br/>
article there somewhere about unschooling math that I&#39;d missed. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145405927">Lots of kids hate math -- mine included.  I want them to be excited <br/>
about how numbers work and to understand some basic math concepts which <br/>
I think that they will enjoy once they&#39;re over the hump of that bad <br/>
school memory of drill and kill math computation worksheets.<br/>
<br/>
We really like playing backgammon, chess, checkers, picaria, cribbage, <br/>
mancala, go, tangrams, pentominoes, dominoes, etc.   So we&#39;re starting a <br/>
Strategy Games club where math concepts will come out naturally in the <br/>
course of playing.  For now, we are avoiding the  use of the M-word -- <br/>
until they figure out that what we&#39;ve been doing all along is math and <br/>
they&#39;ve replaced the sour memories with happy ones.<br/>
