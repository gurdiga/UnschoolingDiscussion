<div id="ygrps-yiv-949440646">I currently have a cardboard castle sitting in our dining area.  This was<br/>
requested by the 4 yo after we went to the Triad Highland Games last<br/>
weekend.  He was fascinated by the pictures of the castles and the warriors<br/>
that he saw walking around in their kilts.  The castle of course required<br/>
that we then construct shields, daggers, battle axes, and long swords and<br/>
really cool helmets.  This then led to a discussion about the rules of war.<br/>
When he realized that I would not tolerate the use of weapons on sibs, he<br/>
decided to be the king of the castle.  We proceeded to make a really neat<br/>
crown for him and his best little friend so she can be his queen.  He slept<br/>
in the castle for the first 2 or 3 nights it was built.<br/>

&gt; I currently have a cardboard castle sitting in our dining area. <br/>
&gt; This was requested by the 4 yo after we went to the Triad Highland<br/>
&gt; Games last weekend.  He was fascinated by the pictures of the<br/>
&gt; castles and the warriors that he saw walking around in their kilts. <br/>
&gt; The castle of course required that we then construct shields,<br/>
&gt; daggers, battle axes, and long swords and really cool helmets.  This<br/>
&gt; then led to a discussion about the rules of war. When he realized<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I find it amazing how kids will continue to elaborate on an idea when <br/>
given the chance.  I was amazed the day that we did the erupting <br/>
volcano project and Sterling (3yo) had to build scenery around it for <br/>
the dinosaurs.  we set the volcano in a shallow box with flip up <br/>
cover and drew trees and mountains on the inside of the cover.  added <br/>
fish tank gravel and moss around the volcano and had to go outside <br/>
and find just the right rocks to use as the boulders.  this turned <br/>
into quite an elaborate ordeal with one idea leading to another.  <br/>
about the time i thought we must be done, he said &quot;Hey! the dinosaurs <br/>
need water to drink! I know, let&#39;s add a lake!&quot;  oh my goodness.   <br/>
