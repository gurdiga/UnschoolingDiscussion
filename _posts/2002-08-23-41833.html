 </span></blockquote>up law says that if a school district feels satisfactory education<br/>
isn&#39;t occurring, he should initiate a due process hearing. BUT!  No<br/>
districts ever do.  That would cost them money.  So instead, they<br/>
throw truancy fines.  And guess who gets to keep the money from<br/>
truancy fines?  Yep, the district.  Isn&#39;t that sweet?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, no kidding, I&#39;d move. There are SO many wonderful places to live <br/>
in this country alone. I would not stay there and give them two more kids <br/>
and parents to screw around with.<br/>

Lots of people I know stay in the same place all their lives.  I don&#39;t <br/>
understand it a bit.  lol.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well I just don&#39;t understand holding onto a place so tightly. When we had <br/>
Conor we knew that I was going to stay home with him. We also knew that we <br/>
could not live on one salary in metro NY. We moved out west where the living <br/>
is cheaper. I&#39;ve never regretted it.<br/>

country when I was 21.  &lt;g&gt;  But since then, I&#39;ve stayed mostly in the same <br/>
area.  We&#39;ve been in this house for around 15 years.  I&#39;m hoping to never <br/>
move again.  (But I&#39;d move if our homeschooling were threatened.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501944208">I would get up and move in a heartbeat if my dh would.  But we like <br/>
our house and almost have it fixed up just the way we like it.  And <br/>
we live 3 minutes from his parents, who have us over for dinner once <br/>
a week.  And he has seniority in his job and if he doesn&#39;t move he <br/>
can retire with full benefits from the state when he&#39;s 50.  It&#39;s <br/>
quiet here.  Nothing ever happens here.  He likes it that way. :)  <br/>
