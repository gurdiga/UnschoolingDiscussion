&lt;&lt;I&#39;m really motivated to start a new group but haven&#39;t<br/>
a clue how to do that.  Any of you more experienced,<br/>
organized Mom&#39;s and Dad&#39;s have some tip&#39;s?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me that I said I would make a new phone list for our group, and <br/>
the notes from Thursday&#39;s meetings are in Holly&#39;s little note pad, and we&#39;re <br/>
leaving for Washington D.C. before the next meeting.   *oh joy!*  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh wait--you said &quot;ORGANIZED&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Our group is a few years old and evolved from a play group some La Leche <br/>
League members had had.  We still have two of the original members.<br/>
<br/>
Some people will come for just a week or month or season.  Don&#39;t take that <br/>
personally.  Organizing unschoolers seems to be a bit like herding cats.  The <br/>
new unschoolers need to see older unschoolers (not biologically older, but <br/>
on-the-path older), and some of the older unschoolers have the wish to help <br/>
newer unschoolers so that they don&#39;t have to struggle and wonder and <br/>
hit-and-miss as sometimes happened years ago, or as still can happen if <br/>
people don&#39;t have encouragement and feedback.<br/>
<br/>
Our group (Albuquerque Unschoolers) is just a play group.  We have these <br/>
rules:  No business meetings, no officers, and no field trips.   This doesn&#39;t <br/>
keep me from keeping a phone list, and doesn&#39;t keep people from getting <br/>
together to do things in groups.  The group exists, though, so that the kids <br/>
can get together with other unschooled kids.  While that&#39;s happening, the <br/>
moms sit and talk.  That&#39;s all.  We don&#39;t usually talk about unschooling, <br/>
although when new families come we&#39;ll certainly answer questions for them, <br/>
and point out certain kids who might be good to observe or interview if they <br/>
want more direct reassurance.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tired of going, but my kids NEED to see their friends, and so I go.  Last <br/>
winter we met at my house, and we finally came to the point that I dreaded <br/>
Thursdays and even my kids were hoping for it to end.  We were having as many <br/>
as twelve families, and the house is big, and not fancy/formal, but still <br/>
there was wear and tear (on nerves mostly).<br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico we can meet in a city park at least half the year.  In Alaska, <br/>
I don&#39;t know what to recommend.  Indoors a bunch of kids get loud and close.  <br/>
<br/>
But as to organization, if you have a day, time and place, even if it&#39;s just <br/>
two or three families, you can gather other families up gradually.  We made <br/>
flyers and put them in the most unschooling-related place in town, a used <br/>
bookstore called Title Wave owned by a homeschooling family at which lots of <br/>
homeschoolers check in occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
We meet on Thursdays, people bring food to share (snack stuff and drinks) and <br/>
the kids play for three or four hours.  Lately we have lots of boys in the 9 <br/>
- 13 age range--sometimes ten of them.  They played dodgeball this week, and <br/>
palled around in smaller groups playing Pokemon or talking about video games, <br/>
and they played with some badminton stuff one mom had brought--making up <br/>
games without a net.<br/>

Hey, I&#39;ve been doing a small Thursday shindig at my small house with the <br/>
remnants of an LLL play group.  One of the things we started doing to make it <br/>
more fun for the moms, since our kids are now older, is to treat it like a <br/>
moms day out arrangement, and encourage some of the moms leave to run errands <br/>
or do fun things.  The trick with this is that it is always hardest for the <br/>
hostess to extricate herself, so if you do it, you may want to keep track on <br/>
a calendar, unless your friends are all scrupulously fair.  (Since we have a <br/>
small group, we can count on our fingers. ;-)<br/>

OH Sandra.....after dealing with my two cats this morning I can really <br/>
appreciate that statement.  And its so true, about organizing unschoolers.<br/>

I think that confirms that I am a total unschooler.  I can&#39;t ever get myself<br/>
or the rest of us organized!  :)<br/>
