&lt;&lt; If your little one is only four, I&#39;d give him five or six years before <br/>
worrying.  Meantime, fill your house and his life with input of all <br/>
sorts--sound, light, stories, materials for art and science, textures, <br/>
toys... and he will learn. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just out of curiosity Sandra(or maybe because my nine-yearold ds isn&#39;t <br/>
reading yet) How old were your boys when they started reading?  Did theyjust <br/>
start spontaneously? Kimme</div>
