<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297302033">Hi Susan<br/>
<br/>
BTW I&#39;m a busy mum of 5 as well!<br/>
<br/>
New Zealand does have beautiful scenery and there is some pretty special<br/>
wildlife, for example the kiwi and tuatara aren&#39;t found anywhere else. We<br/>
don&#39;t have any native mammals in NZ at all, but we do have deer, pigs and so<br/>
on in the wild, they are usually seen as pests and/or are hunted/farmed.<br/>
Possums are a major pest here.<br/>
<br/>
Rats and mice aren&#39;t a particular problem usually. We do have two cats which<br/>
deal with any wild ones that might be around the house. We also keep two pet<br/>
rats which have been a lot of fun. I wasn&#39;t keen at all but they&#39;ve been<br/>
very responsive and interesting and interactive with our girls. We have had<br/>
guineapigs in the past but they are much more timid.<br/>
<br/>
What I had in mind when I posted about the lack of wildlife was the bigger<br/>
animals such as wolves, bears, lions etc as we had been watching so many<br/>
videos about these animals both in the wild and as &quot;pets&quot; or semi-tame (like<br/>
&quot;Born Free&quot;). And I have long liked the idea of keeping turtles but here you<br/>
buy teeny ones from the pet shop and they are *so* expensive.<br/>
<br/>
New Zealand is a beautiful place and I certainly appreciate the lack of<br/>
*dangerous* creatures here!<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Karen<br/>

&gt; Hi Karen, I read your comments about the &quot;lack&quot; of wildlife in N.Z. Lots<br/>
&gt; of Americans have the notion that N.Z. has LOTS of wildlife (including<br/>
&gt; me! So you&#39;ll have to educate me).<br/>
&gt; By the way, I&#39;ve never seen a skink or hedgehog in the wild, so would<br/>
&gt; find that fascinating to observe.... Are rats and mice a problem where<br/>
&gt; you live?<br/>
&gt; Take care, Susan, busy mom of 5, Santa Maria, CA<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; All this talk of the amazing things you guys can see in the wild<br/>
&gt; and/or<br/>
&gt; &gt;keep<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as pets is making me extremely jealous! In New Zealand we only find<br/>
&gt; &gt;rats,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mice, rabbits, hedgehogs, possums, frogs and skinks outside.<br/>
&gt; Red-eared<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; turtles are a pet shop item and very expensive. I remember someone<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt;this<br/>
&gt;<br/>
