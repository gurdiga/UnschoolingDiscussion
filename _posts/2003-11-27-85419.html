<div id="ygrps-yiv-892987660">Well, I gotta say that I see it really as requiring <br/>
respect-for-the-giver&#39;s-feelings.<br/>
Socially, the giver doesn&#39;t give the present until it&#39;s placed in the <br/>
recipient&#39;s hands.  Until that point, it&#39;s the giver&#39;s to do with as they <br/>
like.  Put it under the tree.  Hang it from the ceiling. Tie it to the <br/>
dog.  Whatever.  If the giver wants to give it early, then it can be opened <br/>
early. If the giver hasn&#39;t given it yet, then it shouldn&#39;t be opened.<br/>
<br/>
*****longish story, feel free to skip *******<br/>
I&#39;d had a big problem with my (9/10yo+) kids guessing what I&#39;d gotten for <br/>
them and put under the tree.  (Problem for ME (and the hubby), &#39;cause I was <br/>
disappointed in not being able to surprise them.)  They&#39;d go so far as to <br/>
partly unwrap things, and tear corners of packages to get a clue then <br/>
they&#39;d grin real big and with great satisfaction in their intellectual <br/>
prowess, tell me really loudly that they already knew what I was going to <br/>
give and that I couldn&#39;t pull anything over on them! On Xmas day, they&#39;d be <br/>
handed a present, declare &quot;It&#39;s an XYZ.  I know already.&quot; sometimes without <br/>
even opening it, and sometimes even go so far as to ignore it utterly while <br/>
waiting to open the &#39;supreme&#39;/heart-throb present that they&#39;d also figured <br/>
out but which was still under the tree.<br/>
<br/>
This really bugged me, not only because it showed no regard for how the <br/>
giver felt, but also because it seemed that the focus was more on getting <br/>
the really cool present or showing how much cleverer the intended recipient <br/>
was at figuring out clues than the giver was at hiding them... rather than <br/>
on the fun of exchanging goodwill (in this case, by exchanging gifts with <br/>
each other.)<br/>
<br/>
So, as I put out presents the next year, I sat down with them and explained <br/>
how when I give presents, part of what I like best is seeing the surprise <br/>
and happiness on their faces as they open it on Christmas morning and <br/>
figure out what it is for the very first time.  I shared that when they <br/>
already knew what I was going to give them, that it ruined my joy in <br/>
surprising them and took all the fun out of it for me and it all made me <br/>
feel pretty lousy.  Then I suggested that if they insisted in figuring out <br/>
the gifts from ME, they had to make sure that I didn&#39;t realize it or the <br/>
gift would change.<br/>
<br/>
 From then on, they&#39;d shake things, but the tearing and unwrapping <br/>
stopped.  They never once said they knew already and always looked <br/>
pleasantly surprised when opening them.  There was even a running joke that <br/>
I was giving them an ironing board.  &quot;Hey mom, I&#39;ve figured this one <br/>
out!  It&#39;s an ironing board, right?&quot;  Sometimes they&#39;d figure it out and <br/>
admit it to me a few weeks later, but they always respected my feelings <br/>
about Christmas day and being able to surprise them with the gifts that I gave.<br/>
<br/>
The kids are likewise in charge of the presents they&#39;re giving.  If they <br/>
don&#39;t mind the recipient opening them before gift-day/Xmas, then they make <br/>
it obvious and give it early.  Sometimes they open each other&#39;s gifts <br/>
early.  Usually though, they like to see them under the tree and to have it <br/>
opened with the others, on the traditional day.<br/>

...and even though HeidiC *thinks* she might be more gorgeous than HeidiWD, <br/>
HeidiWD is quite sure she&#39;s mistaken, although she&#39;s gotta be pretty gosh <br/>
darn good looking, considering her name and all...  (Big Wicked Heidi Grin)</div>
