Thank you Linda!  I was made to feel like a total idiot in<br/>
high school due to my lack of inclination with algebra,<br/>
forget calculus.  I suffered needless hours!  I became a nurse, <br/>
(don&#39;t need algebra for that), a restaurant co-owner ( don&#39;t need<br/>
algebra for that), seamstress...you get the message.<br/>
I&#39;m currently teaching, writing and lecturing on alternative<br/>
medicine and still I don&#39;t need algebra and calculus for that :-)<br/>
