 </span></blockquote>I, for one, wholeheartedly agree with you.  I am one for whom manners go<br/>
hand in hand with respect for others.  Maybe I am old fashioned, but I like<br/>
it that way.  I send thank you notes, I encourage my children to be polite<br/>
and respectful to their friends and each other, we say thank you, please,<br/>
your welcome and I&#39;m sorry to each other in this house.  That means adults<br/>
to each other, children to each other, and adults to children or vice<br/>
versa.  Respecting others&#39; boundaries and differences doesn&#39;t stop at the<br/>
door, either.  I try to instill in my children the rightness of treating<br/>
others well and being &quot;good&quot; to people.  Sometimes a little bit of kindness<br/>
can work wonders for someone, and you may even make a stranger&#39;s day.<br/>
