<div id="ygrps-yiv-710767675">Oh Jodye,<br/>
Reading your post made me feel so sad for you and your lovely little girl<br/>
and so mad at the doctor I wanted to hit something! (Him actually!!) My<br/>
second baby also had shoulder dystocia and was delivered easily and smoothly<br/>
by one of the very rare empathetic doctors I have been with!<br/>
My other babies were delivered by midwives and like you, my opinion of the<br/>
Medical fraternity!! is NOT high!<br/>
Hugs to you and your family and just wanted to let you know that 1,000s of<br/>
miles away someone is really outraged on your behalf!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Namaste<br/>
Brooke</div>
