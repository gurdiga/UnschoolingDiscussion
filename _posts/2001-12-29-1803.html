<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023285694">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;What I meant by &quot;crummy&quot; is more the production<br/>
value.  Cheap sets are fine with them.  Americans have<br/>
to have everything look like solid <br/>
perfection, new furniture, beautiful models to show<br/>
toasters, etc.  Some of the game shows in <br/>
England are gloriously cheap and tacky.  And seeing<br/>
what&#39;s typically on there, I get the TV-based humor<br/>
better.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I get it now. I know what you mean and that&#39;s one of<br/>
the things I love about British TV, not everyone is a<br/>
&#39;beautiful person&#39;. There are all shapes and sizes on<br/>
Brit TV! And I know what you mean about the tacky<br/>
sets, LOL! The thing about the sets is that they are<br/>
actually very realistic (the house ones anyway). I&#39;ve<br/>
been in a lot of British houses and a lot of them<br/>
really are like that (where are the taste police -<br/>
what IS it about the clashing carpet and wallpaper<br/>
thing?)!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I was ashamed at the American shows they were<br/>
happily watching.  Not ashamed of the Simpsons or<br/>
South Park.  But ashamed that Brits had Jerry Springer<br/>
(which I&#39;ve never even seen except a moment in<br/>
passing).    An episode Little House on the Prairie<br/>
was on some afternoon on a weekend, I think.  And they<br/>
were getting Frasier, I&#39;m guessing in part because<br/>
there&#39;s an English character.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of American shows over there (of all<br/>
kinds). Friends was huge! Ally McBeal was popular and<br/>
so was Sex In The City, Northern Exposure, Twin Peaks<br/>
(remember that one), and X Files, among others. The<br/>
other good thing about Brit TV is that it&#39;s not as<br/>
prudish on the sex front as US TV (they even put on a<br/>
slightly edited Emanuelle after 10pm). They also have<br/>
far more shows that include homosexuality and other<br/>
cultures in everyday lifestyles. It surprises me<br/>
sometimes how much more openminded the Brits are (in<br/>
general) compared to a lot of Americans.<br/>

<br/>
It surprises me not.  <br/>
<br/>
Secular unschoolers are expected to cater to and take care not to offend <br/>
fundamentalist Christians and so is the rest of the country, every senator, <br/>
bookstores, atheists, etc.  TV shows sometimes seem the bravest, and book and <br/>
magazine publishers.  But they lose sponsors when Christians campaign.<br/>
<br/>
This month (2001) there is/was a Harry Potter book burning (and other stuff, <br/>
I don&#39;t know what all) in Alamogordo, New Mexico.  That&#39;s not even Bible belt.<br/>
<br/>
England has fewer fundamentalist Christians thanks to having a (liberal, but <br/>
still) state religion.<br/>

As one Sydney newspaper wrote during the Clinton scandal, &quot;We&#39;re glad<br/>
we got the convicts and they got the Puritans.&quot;<br/>
