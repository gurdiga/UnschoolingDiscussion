&gt; What to do about rudeness?  Because I think that&#39;s what this is.  Well, I am<br/>
&gt; not a nicey-nice person so I would say something snotty (&quot;we&#39;re not doing<br/>
&gt; math quizzes right now, could you check out my daughter&#39;s merchandise now&quot; --<br/>
&gt; with a real &quot;after all who is the paying customer her anyway&quot; type attitude)<br/>
&gt; but you have to do what you want.  Come back here and go to other unschooling<br/>
&gt; and hsing lists and kvetch about rude people all you want though.  I think we<br/>
&gt; have all seen it. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116581224">Hi Valerie..<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your kind response - before we moved up here I went to the WHO<br/>
site and discovered that I didn&#39;t have to do anything until 8... but being<br/>
that we moved from CA where other than sending in a form declaring our home<br/>
a private school, we don&#39;t have to do nothin&#39;, the testing part unnerved<br/>
me... (and bugs me, to be honest!) I was getting worried in advance!! I do<br/>
my best worrying that way...<br/>
<br/>
I have discovered FLO (I was on the WHEN list for awhile) and I&#39;m intrigued<br/>
by the evaluation option. Did you do that or the test?<br/>
<br/>
Again - thanks for your response...<br/>
<br/>
Nina<br/>

&gt; We recently moved to Washington state with it&#39;s yearly testing laws which<br/>
&gt; threw me into a tizzy<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; **Hi Nina. If your kids are only 7 and 3 you don&#39;t even need to register as<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers in WA. That starts at age 8. Have you looked into Family<br/>
&gt; Learning Organization (FLO) for testing? I did that last year for the first<br/>
&gt; time and it was great. Just $25. Anyway, you don&#39;t need to worry about it<br/>
&gt; yet...<br/>

&gt; Nina, Could you tell us about the book Learning at Home?  I&#39;ve never heard of<br/>
&gt; it.  I don&#39;t think my library has it, but I&#39;m still searching.<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Ann<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Ann - <br/>
I&#39;ll try and give this a shot.. you&#39;ll have to excuse me if I ramble and<br/>
wander a bit...<br/>
<br/>
The book is called Learning at Home A Mother&#39;s Guide to Homeschooling by<br/>
Marty Layne. She lives in Canada, the book was written in 1998 and at that<br/>
time her youngest was 17 I think. She doesn&#39;t actually call herself an<br/>
&#39;unschooler&#39; per se, but refers to herself as an unstructured homeschooler.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a very gentle book that shares some hows and why&#39;s of what they did,<br/>
the anxieties she had, the mistakes she made, the insights she had. She also<br/>
discusses the emotional component of learning, the rythm of learning. She<br/>
talks about what a parent can expect in terms of output. She talks about<br/>
reading and writing and how it happened in her home with her kids<br/>
differently and why she thinks it did.<br/>
<br/>
In a nutshell, she used her children&#39;s interests to help them gain a mastery<br/>
of what she considered to be the skills necessary for living in the world<br/>
today. She feels those skills are: being able to read fluently and with<br/>
pleasure, write fluently, understand arithmatic well enough to balance a<br/>
checkbook, learn how to manage money, understand basic nutrition to maintain<br/>
health. learn how to pursue an idea or project and learn how to think<br/>
critically and imaginatively. Learning how to aquire information has been<br/>
her focus. As Debra so eloquently put it when describing her grandmother, we<br/>
have no clue what our children&#39;s future will look like, and helping them<br/>
have the ability to figure out what they need to know is probably the best<br/>
gift we can give them.<br/>
<br/>
She did not do structured learning sessions, but she did feel it important<br/>
that her kids learn to read, write and do math as above - however, she<br/>
worked with them on their time table... her kids were reading fluently<br/>
between the ages of 8 1/2 to 12, depending on the child.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has a nice, gentle clear way of painting a picture of what that<br/>
learning looked like in her house, and why it did, why it looked different<br/>
for each of her kids.  I have a stonger feel of how to support my children<br/>
in their process of learning, as well as an affirmation that I&#39;m on the<br/>
right path. <br/>
<br/>
As Nance pointed out, we all waffle and wonder, have strong days and weak<br/>
ones - this book, for me at least, left me feeling stronger and clearer<br/>
about what the heck it is that I&#39;m doing, and what it can look like in our<br/>
home!<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps...!<br/>

**Oh Nina, you were born to be a mom if you excell in worrying. :)<br/>
<br/>
We did the Metropolitan test thru FLO. I chose that one because it was the<br/>
shortest. Just $22 I think. It&#39;s like a shorter version of the CAT. They<br/>
sent it to me. I &quot;administered&quot; it to my 10 year old daughter. We mailed it<br/>
back. They sent the results. It was much simpler than I expected. This was<br/>
my daughter&#39;s first test. We&#39;ve never even done worksheets, so I wondered<br/>
how she&#39;d do. Now I know these tests are bogus, but (since we opted to play<br/>
the game) it was great that she did so well. She tested at a 5th grade level<br/>
and scored anywhere from grade 4.5 to 11.0. That really reassured the<br/>
grandparents---ha. So it wasn&#39;t any big deal. We&#39;re the only ones with the<br/>
test scores. FLO doesn&#39;t turn it into anyone else. And I&#39;m sure no one will<br/>
ever ask to see them, either. I know a mom up in Edmonds with 8 kids...has a<br/>
box stuffed full of annual tests...and is disappointed that no one ever<br/>
wants to see them. (she&#39;s kidding about being disappointed of course) We did<br/>
evaluations for the 2 years prior to testing. That&#39;s great, too, depending<br/>
on who&#39;s doing it. I think we&#39;ll stick with testing just because it was<br/>
simpler and shorter.<br/>
