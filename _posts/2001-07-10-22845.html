<div id="ygrps-yiv-504742161">Joyce, I love to watch your reference-presentations unfold.  For me it would <br/>
be a lot of work to do what you do (seemingly) with ease.  And it might be a <br/>
whole lot of work for you too.  So whether it is easy or painstaking, I <br/>
wanted to say it&#39;s impressive to see the final recital and you&#39;re a wonderful <br/>
person to have in our midst, for your ability and generosity and walking us <br/>
to and through some information that&#39;s not just one click away.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>
