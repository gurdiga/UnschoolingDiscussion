<div id="ygrps-yiv-993414356">I&#39;ve been a way for a while, and thought I&#39;d share a piece of our <br/>
day. <br/>
<br/>
Today is my day off, and my brother spent the night last night so <br/>
Jaiden(5)and Avery(2) woke up to their favorite uncle sleeping with <br/>
them. They came out to the livingroom where I was still sleeping, <br/>
Jason having left for school many hours before the rest of us wake <br/>
up. They climbed up on the couch and rubbed my back and sang songs to <br/>
me till a woke up. Jaiden then went into the kitchen a poured me a <br/>
cup of coffee(his new fave thing to do)and Avery found the remote so <br/>
he could turn on the t.v. We watched the end of Yuh-Gi-Oh and went in <br/>
to the kitchen to get breakfast, kids decided on Life and I went with <br/>
oatmeal. We were cuddled up on the couch, trying to be quiet, when <br/>
Jesse(my brother) came out and asked the boys if they wanted to play <br/>
on the PS2 with him, he had set up his in our &#39;puter room last night <br/>
so he could play Final Fantasy #something or other, with them. They <br/>
all like Blitz Ball. So They played for a while while I checked my <br/>
email. After about 45 min and a bag of easter candy later they all <br/>
decided they needed FOOD so I was drafted to make omlets while they <br/>
checked out what was on the National Geographic channel tonight, <br/>
Jaiden was hoping for something on mummies or the dark side of the <br/>
moon and Avery wanted snakes. After we ate, again Jesse took the boys <br/>
out so I could do a little unpacking, I spent most of my time online <br/>
instead. <br/>
<br/>
When they came back Jesse had to take off for work and the kids <br/>
decided to watch Tom and Jerry, not my fave show, so I went in and <br/>
unpacked a few of their boxes and listened to them giggling. They <br/>
came in to their room to see what treasures had been unearthed and <br/>
were very excited to see all their army men and dino&#39;s after a 5 <br/>
month confinment in boxes and various storage garages. They are now <br/>
playing in the back yard, with a combo of army men, dinos, farm <br/>
animals, mud, shovels, bubbles and rocks enjoying a beautiful spring <br/>
day. I&#39;m inside, listening to them run, laugh, and play. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad that we chose this path, that they get to be outside on <br/>
this beautiful day, digging in the dirt, smelling the air, feeling <br/>
the sun, playing, playing, playing. Instead of being inside a <br/>
classroom (or stuck at the kitchen table) looking longingly out the <br/>
window wishing they could be outside.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sooooo glad that I&#39;m home today and WITH them instead of waiting <br/>
for them to get home from school. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a beautiful day, and I just wanted to share it.<br/>
<br/>
:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for sharing your day. I like hearing about days that are laid <br/>
back and relaxed. Sometimes when i read about unschooling days in <br/>
which kids are doing &quot;amazing&quot; things (like making maps of medieval <br/>
towns and creating new solar systems out of toilet paper and string <br/>
and carving a canoe from scratch;o) ) I feel like &quot;hmmm, maybe we <br/>
aren&#39;t unschooly enough&quot;...and that maybe we should be doing &quot;more&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Today was awesome here in Michigan too. Just last week it was <br/>
freezing, but it was in the 70s today. We just hung out mostly. I, <br/>
too, felt so happy that my son wasnt cooped up in a classroom, and <br/>
that we got to be together.<br/>
