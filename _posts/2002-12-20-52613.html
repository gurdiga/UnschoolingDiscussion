<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767555255"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; We tried to pass a less restrictive homeschool law in PA, and it was<br/>
&gt; tabled at the end of November.  Part of the problem is that there<br/>
&gt; were some homeschoolers who actually lobbied against it, saying that<br/>
&gt; if they didn&#39;t have the state to be accountable to, they might not do<br/>
&gt; a good job educating their children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Excuse me while I puke!  Those are probably the same people who believe that<br/>
kids won&#39;t grown up to be decent people unless they&#39;re spanked.<br/>
