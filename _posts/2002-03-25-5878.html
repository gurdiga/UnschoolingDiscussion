short:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;But if a child is NOT learning, the parent is not effectively <br/>
facilitating.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having trouble thinking of any examples of a child NOT learning. <br/>
<br/>
We may not be able to see the learning, as Dar wrote.  They or we may <br/>
not be able to articulate what they&#39;re learning.  They may be learning <br/>
unexpected things, or things we find irrelevant, trivial, or beside <br/>
the point, but I need some help picturing &quot;not learning&quot;. <br/>

world is a more interesting and varied place than what gets fed through the<br/>
TV.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids are very active, independent learners and will go get or ask for<br/>
what they need. Some kids want someone to accompany them on the journey. If<br/>
from the environment there seems to be no journey worth taking and no one<br/>
there to take it with them, then they&#39;ll settle for the minimum that&#39;s<br/>
available.<br/>

perhaps) say that children learned how to ride bikes in winter and to <br/>
ice skate in summer.  The brain marches on with incorporating things <br/>
whether the outside world sees it or not.<br/>
