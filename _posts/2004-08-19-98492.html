<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927594164">Dear all,<br/>
<br/>
  A thought that worries me regarding open access to sweets/junk food - what<br/>
about getting fat (the kids) and/or causing/aggravating dental caries??<br/>
Combined with playing video games, staying up late (which often means teeth<br/>
brushing is less than perfect due to tired parents/kids), I&#39;m wondering what<br/>
experiences others have had regarding cavities/fat when allowing open access<br/>
to sweets/junk.<br/>
<br/>
  I wouldn&#39;t be very comfortable with waiting until the next dental<br/>
appointment to find out they have 6 cavities that need filling, or seeing<br/>
them fill out and get fat before I stepped back in to regulate.  Or what<br/>
about total nutrition for their bodies/?  I believe that some kids would<br/>
&quot;grow out of&quot; eating junk, but others would just keep on going, as one<br/>
poster noticed with her daughter and  herself.  I&#39;ve also noticed this about<br/>
myself, and therefore limit what I buy so that I don&#39;t eat it all!<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>

 <br/>
-----------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
That was me.  But I want to clarify.  My dd doesn&#39;t just *keep on going*, if<br/>
by that you mean that she eats sweets uncontrollably.  Despite the fact that<br/>
dd2 eats a lot more sweets than dd1, it still isn&#39;t to excess.  (Dd1 doesn&#39;t<br/>
much care for sweets.)  I was just trying to make the point that different<br/>
people with free access to food will choose varying amounts of sweets<br/>
depending on their likes and dislikes.  Neither of my kids eats to the point<br/>
where they are uncomfortable.   Dd2 likes sweets and eats them more often<br/>
than some people mention about their kids with open access to foods but she<br/>
also, over the course of a week, eats a wide variety of foods, including<br/>
fruits, veggies, and whole grains.  I just have to look at it over the<br/>
course of a week, and not necessarily a day.   (also, I want to mention that<br/>
what I do doesn&#39;t really count because I wasn&#39;t raised with free access and<br/>
I was forced to clean my plate, so I have issues of my own.)<br/>
 <br/>
For the record, Neither of my children with open access to all foods have<br/>
any cavities at all and both are thin and healthy. <br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t mean by bringing this up to put a boulder in the path of people who<br/>
are trying to ease up with food issues.  &lt;please continue to ease up!&gt;  I<br/>
just wanted them to realize that it may (or may not) look different at their<br/>
house or with each of their children than someone else&#39;s house or children,<br/>
with regards to what is eaten and what isn&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
I was trying to say, that despite the fact that we have never controlled<br/>
food that one dd likes and eats sweets more often than the other.  Both are<br/>
thin and healthy and neither have cavities.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think I am starting to repeat myself.  I&#39;ll be quiet now.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids self-regulate food. Types, quantity, timing. We have candy, ice <br/>
cream, cookies around most of the time but it&#39;s never an issue (except <br/>
for DH!!).<br/>
<br/>
Older kids (Katherine is 16 and Christopher is 13) each have one small <br/>
cavity that was filled without Novocain (they were that small). Aaron <br/>
(age 5) has never had one.<br/>
<br/>
They are all in the 65% range  for height and 50% for weight for their <br/>
ages (or thereabouts, I don&#39;t keep real close tabs on that but we <br/>
looked it up the other day for fun because Katherine asked).<br/>
<br/>
They are rarely sick, tho we have family allergies and we get the <br/>
normal colds. Katherine hasn&#39;t been substantially sick (more than <br/>
normal colds/flu) in about 7 years, Christopher the same. Aaron has <br/>
never needed antibiotics for any reason.<br/>
<br/>
They play Nintendo and computer games and watch TV, also all <br/>
unrestricted. They are all nightowls, and we help the youngest with his <br/>
teeth but not the older two.<br/>
<br/>
Just my experience. HTH.<br/>

If none of this sounds sensible or doable to you, don&#39;t do it.   There&#39;s <br/>
nothing magic.  There are just principles and the avoidance of other generations&#39; <br/>
problems.    We might be no more right than our parents were, but I&#39;ll tell <br/>
you this:  My mom didn&#39;t think too hard about what she was doing and I&#39;ve done a <br/>
lot of thinking and reading. I might be wrg, but I&#39;m not just following along.<br/>
<br/>
Read all you can find, think about what you&#39;ve experi<br/>
Zenced and what you see around you, and who you think is closest to useful <br/>
information, and make your own decisions.  There&#39;s no more that can be done.<br/>
<br/>
The dental profession isn&#39;t the sharpest tack in the forward-looking medical <br/>
drawer, in my experience.   I mistrust them generally.   We have to live when <br/>
and where we live, though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One reason is the food particles and sugar residue that is on the teeth<br/>
feeds the bacteria all night long.  Nighttime is said to be the most<br/>
important time to brush - mouth is not rinsed and plaque is not rubbed off<br/>
by fruit/gum/brushing.  For people prone to cavities, it might make a<br/>
significant difference.  Cavities, though, depend a lot on the saliva and<br/>
on the presence of the strep bacteria in the mouth (it is what causes the<br/>
early childhood caries, which is the most prevalent infectious disease in<br/>
kids younger than 5.).  Fluoride doesn&#39;t kill it and inhibits the<br/>
absorption of Vit D.  Brushing/rubbing, and a minty mouthwash kills the<br/>
bacteria - according to an article in &quot;Mothering&quot; magazine a couple of<br/>
years ago.<br/>
<br/>
My son Luke had to have his front 4 teeth removed at age 2 b/c of ECC, and<br/>
I am horribly prone to cavities, though I&#39;m getting my act together wrt<br/>
brushing and flossing at night.  My dh doesn&#39;t brush regularly and never<br/>
gets cavities.  Hopefully my other kids will inherit his teeth and not<br/>
mine. ;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve read (could be old info by now, or could still not have hit the <br/>
mainstream) that mothers pass the bacteria on to their children in infancy.  So not <br/>
only are there differences in saliva [my own doesn&#39;t dissolve things very well, <br/>
and cough drops can last a long, long time (too long)], differences in the <br/>
hardness of the enamel, and then there&#39;s that possibility of being infected by <br/>
your mother from the many ways mothers get their salive in and on kids.  <br/>
(Sharing food, but worse chewing food for kids.)<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Holly had soft enamel.  Marty didn&#39;t.  Marty has teeth like his <br/>
dad&#39;s, and the other kids are more like mine.   The dentist blamed breastfeeding. <br/>
 It&#39;s all he had to blame, as they were hardly eating any food at all when <br/>
the problems started.  They were just on the same teeth on both of them, too, on <br/>
four teeth, but NOT the center four, the next four out.   So classic &quot;bottle <br/>
mouth&quot; it was certainly not, and they didn&#39;t use bottles at that age anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-140401937">I&#39;m not a dentist, but what I have read is that caries<br/>
are linked to genes.  You inherent the same bacteria<br/>
that lives in your parents&#39; mouth. (Mothering Magazine<br/>
has some past articles online regarding this) So, if<br/>
you are hereditarially linked to getting caries, then<br/>
whether or not you eat a lot of sugary junk food<br/>
doesn&#39;t really matter.  My take on it is to have good<br/>
oral hygiene no matter what. I would also highly<br/>
recommend getting regular cleanings.  That helps get<br/>
out all the bacteria that you can not loosen with in<br/>
home care.<br/>
<br/>
As far as getting fat, well, I think some people are<br/>
genetically prone to getting &#39;fat&#39; too.  But, I think<br/>
that has more to do with lack of excercise than eating<br/>
sugary junk food too.  I think kids need a lot more<br/>
&#39;excercise&#39; than adults because they have so much<br/>
energy (at least my 3 year old).  So, making sure they<br/>
get physical play and go outside is really important. <br/>
Not that this will necessarily help them stay &#39;slim&#39;,<br/>
but that it&#39;s healthy for them all around.<br/>

  You&#39;ve assumed that if kids have a choice they&#39;ll always choose wrong. If they have the freedom to practice choice however, they get really good at it. My toddler dragged me into bed at around 9:30 because he wanted to sleep. My daughter decided 10 was her limit and that she was going to sleep in because today was going to be a busy one. What kid with no control would even consider when and why she personally needed to go to bed? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  You&#39;ve assumed that because they have control over what they eat they&#39;ll choose junk all the time. My daughter crinkled her nose at the offer of chocolate last night in favour of fruit cocktail. My toddler brought me back his half eaten peanut butter cup because he was no longer hungry (And he used to crave chocolate before I decided to let him have it whenever he wanted it). If it&#39;s a toss up between candy and an apple or carrot sticks and dip usually the carrots or apple wins. If kids have experience eating (and even binging - my son did eat a ton of party mix last night) they know what makes them feel good and what doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s not growing out of junk that&#39;s important, it&#39;s having control over it so that it doesn&#39;t control you. I&#39;m betting you never had control over your own food as I kid. I&#39;m also betting your daughter doesn&#39;t and hasn&#39;t really so you don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll just keep on going or not if she had a chance to get it out of her system. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370917081">My children self-regulate with food (and have since birth).  They are now 6.5 and 1.5.   Lydia, the 6.5 yo,  has had one &quot;cavity&quot; filled, deep between her teeth -- I put it in quotes, though, because shortly thereafter we switched dentists and the new dentists said that it had probably not been a cavity after all, based on his review of the Lydia&#39;s x-rays, which he said had been overlapped improperly.  The 1.5 yo hasn&#39;t been to the dentist yet. <br/>
<br/>
 Both kids are in the middle of the charts for height/weight.  <br/>
<br/>
The other weekend when we were camping for the weekend with our playgroup, Lydia roasted herself maybe 4 marshmellows the first night -- then roasted them for other people until she couldn&#39;t find anyone else who still wanted one.  The second night, she made and ate one &#39;smore, then asked for some chicken and then an apple.   Jonathan ate maybe 3 marshmellows each night (unroasted) and then sat on my lap watching the campfire and nursing. <br/>
<br/>
We came home with a bag of marshmellows.  Lydia said that she really liked it when they were soft after being roasted, so we tried putting one in the microwave.  It puffed up in a very cool way.  She ate about 5 puffed marshmellows that day and hasn&#39;t asked for one since.  The bag (3/4 full) of marshmellows is still on the kitchen counter in plain site. <br/>
<br/>
We keep the miniature sized reece&#39;s cups, kitkats, and several other candies on a shelf where Lydia can get them without my help (but locked away from the 1.5 yo who has to ask for them, since he sometimes puts them in his mouth without unwrapping them).   If  Lydia wants a kind of candy she writes it on the grocery list, just like we all do for whatever we want, and it gets purchased the next trip (grocery trips occur 1-2 times a week).  I think that it is the knoweldge of access that helps.  I don&#39;t have to have some of every candy on hand for Lydia not to feel that they are scarce because she knows that if she wants it we will buy it.  <br/>

<br/>
Kirby is settling out in a fat phase, I&#39;m afraid.  He has a belly.  <br/>
<br/>
He does a lot of karate.<br/>
Marty who exercises less is, at the moment, buff-boy.  This may pass, and <br/>
Kirby  might get taller again too, I just don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s skinny but might not always be.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was a fat baby.  Fat in every photo at every age.   Not like <br/>
Kirby, but really all-over fat.    His mom blames me for having whole milk and <br/>
butter.   Life is simple for her.   His mom used to limit to small portions, but <br/>
the kids all (three boys) just found other food sources and let her have her <br/>
fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, Keith was shamed at home and teased at school about something he <br/>
didn&#39;t cause and couldn&#39;t prevent.  He grew up with a lot of pain and food <br/>
issues.<br/>
<br/>
I married him because he&#39;s smart and funny and creative and a good musician <br/>
and not because he was fat or not, and not in the hopes that he would lose a <br/>
lot of weight (he works hard at it sometimes, and then sometimes he doesn&#39;t, and <br/>
I just detach myself from participation/pressure/emotion about that, and just <br/>
be nice to him whatever phase of emotional calm or upheaval he&#39;s in about it).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gone from 140 pounds before I had kids to 200 myself, over the past <br/>
Kirby-life years.   I had two grandmothers who went from skinny to soft and round <br/>
in their granny years, and so I&#39;m not surprised.  My mom and my sister stayed <br/>
skinny from substance abuse, alcohol, cigarettes and cocaine (on my sister&#39;s <br/>
part).  I wasn&#39;t interested in THAT diet.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t know and still don&#39;t know which of our kids might inherit what.   <br/>
At this snapshot moment it seems Kirby is pudging and the others aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
What I have done is never try to help ANY of them define themselves or their <br/>
worth by their appearance.  When Holly is in a totally cute phase, I remind <br/>
her (gently) that looks don&#39;t always last so don&#39;t bank on it or get mad when <br/>
you change, because change is natural.   She sees people who stayed <br/>
photogenically cute for life, and some who never were cute, and some who&#39;ve gone through <br/>
different phases.  <br/>
<br/>
What Kirby has that Keith didn&#39;t have is a lack of shame and teasing.  He <br/>
didn&#39;t have to deal with schoolkids, and we haven&#39;t changed his life or ours out <br/>
of that one weight issue.<br/>
<br/>
IF people are different, and IF averages are to be averages, there will be <br/>
people on both ends of the measure.  It&#39;s natural.   <br/>
<br/>
School and society teaches us that being average is a worthy goal.  And from <br/>
that pool of average, a few exceptions will get rich and famous (i.e. &quot;be <br/>
successful&quot;) but first you must be average. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It just doesn&#39;t apply to our way of thinking these days.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s spent the week in Los Alamos (90 miles away) with kids a year or two <br/>
older than he is, a batch of friends he&#39;s known for a few years.   They&#39;re all <br/>
in college. They have parents with hotshot science jobs.  They like Kirby a <br/>
LOT.   <br/>
<br/>
Kirby came home Wednesday to work a shift, before going back up there to <br/>
finish the week before they all go back off to their sophomore years of college.   <br/>
He told me one of the dads said, &quot;So how does it feel to be the most popular <br/>
guy in town?&quot; and that the same dad said he had hoped to play some games with <br/>
Kirby (both are board game collectors), and Kirby should come back up there <br/>
when there aren&#39;t a bunch of girls around.     (He&#39;s the dad of the girl who <br/>
invited Kirby to the prom, and we&#39;ve known him a long time.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes parents put a child&#39;s weight ahead of other issues, and the other <br/>
issues don&#39;t stand a chance.<br/>

&lt;&lt; We came home with a bag of marshmellows.  Lydia said that she really liked <br/>
it when they were soft after being roasted, so we tried putting one in the <br/>
microwave.  It puffed up in a very cool way.  She ate about 5 puffed <br/>
marshmellows that day and hasn&#39;t asked for one since.  The bag (3/4 full) of marshmellows <br/>
is still on the kitchen counter in plain site.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For six years now we&#39;ve lived in a house with a fireplace.  Every fall we get <br/>
a bag of marshmallows and put them in a basket by the fireplace with forks.   <br/>
Every spring I have thrown away part of a bag of dried up marshmallows.  Most <br/>
are roasted when we have company and they think it would be fun.  It IS fun!  <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s also fun with a fireplace is burning the sculptures kids make with fat <br/>
toothpicks and miniature marshmallows.   After they dry out and the kids <br/>
don&#39;t want to look at them anymore, we put them in a hot fireplace and watch them <br/>
transform.<br/>
<br/>
Some people would say that if marshmallows are food, they should never be <br/>
&quot;wasted.&quot;  I think it&#39;s more wasteful to eat them just because you have them than <br/>
to burn them for fun.   Maybe when a kid just likes to roast marshmallows but <br/>
nobody wants to eat them, let her throw the finished ones in the fire.  <br/>
They&#39;re cheap.  Better burned to ashes than spending the day in anyone&#39;s <br/>
intestines!  (Same with lots of food.  Better sat around and ended up in the compost <br/>
than passed through someone just so it wouldn&#39;t be &quot;wasted.&quot;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-10950110">Just a couple of thoughts about teeth-in my house battery operated <br/>
toothbrushes are a big hit. You can buy a fairly good one for about <br/>
$8.00(CDN) or at the dollar store for a buck or two. The expensive <br/>
ones have cool designs. My three yr. old loves her Barbie one to <br/>
bits and has been brushing her teeth completely independently for <br/>
about a year now (sometimes many, many times a day).<br/>
<br/>
Also, the dentist may determine that your child has &quot;cavities&quot; when <br/>
in fact they may just be compensating for the shape of your child&#39;s <br/>
teeth. Some people have deeply indented teeth. I have this shape of <br/>
teeth. Almost all of my teeth were filled when the permanent ones <br/>
came in. This wasn&#39;t done because I have cavities, but because when <br/>
we were kids dentists were sure that cavities would develop if <br/>
these &quot;holes&quot; weren&#39;t filled up. I think it was a big insurance <br/>
scam, personally. My present dentist says that nowadays, if they <br/>
begin to see cavities developing in some teeth then they may fill <br/>
some of the other deep recesses with a clear material. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My point was that brushing just before bedtime is important.  For someone<br/>
working a night shift, brushing before he/she goes to bed in the morning<br/>
is the critical time but for most of us bedtime is nighttime.  I was<br/>
responding to your statement &quot;Why should tooth brushing have to be right<br/>
before bed? If they brush a couple of times a day, it&#39;s not going to<br/>
matter what time it was.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It does matter, for a couple of reasons.<br/>
1.  If you brush just before a meal, and not after, the sugar and residue<br/>
stays on your teeth until you clean them somehow (by brushing, eating an<br/>
apple, chewing some anti-decay gum, etc.).  Brushing after breakfast is<br/>
better than brushing before.<br/>
<br/>
2.  At night, most of us sleep with our mouths closed (except for the<br/>
occasional snore) and the bacteria grow rapidly on the food that is left<br/>
on the teeth.  We aren&#39;t eating any apples or chewing gum or removing the<br/>
plaque.  This advice came directly from our dental hygienist but I found a<br/>
link to offer evidence:  &quot;Always brush your teeth before you go to bed<br/>
because we produce less saliva during our sleep and are more prone to<br/>
damage from bacteria.&quot; <br/>

Seeing that &quot;advice&quot; and then reconciling that with &quot;principles&quot; makes it easier for me to unschool, and to make more principled decisions.<br/>

I think there is an advantage to having lots of different information in order to see how principled decisions are made.<br/>

some parents would have just said no, Marty couldn&#39;t go, maybe for no other <br/>
reason than the parents were uncomfortable.  We got to talking about Keith <br/>
(dh/her dad) and his family, growing up, and various stuff.  She said &quot;I never knew <br/>
the stuff about being fat was so bad until we were at IHOP...&quot;<br/>

and then out to eat.   Kirby was driving, and two of the girls were new to <br/>

<br/>
Holly was really sad for her, and thought two hamburgers were too much food.  <br/>
But Keith&#39;s pattern, and his brothers&#39;, were to eat as much food as fast as <br/>
they could when they were away from home, because their mom&#39;s portions were <br/>
little and coated in meanness.<br/>
<br/>
I asked if the girl seemed at all fat, and Holly said no, not at all.<br/>

bragging to eat more than she&#39;s really hungry for, and...   none of my kids <br/>
have any of those symptoms.<br/>

From a cynical point of view, continuing research might actually find a cure. Then what will all those dentists do? There&#39;s a limit to how straight one get get teeth and they got expensive lifestyles to fund.<br/>
<br/>
The dentist we saw in Virginia claimed Heather had 9 cavities and offered pre-brace braces - cos, as he told her, she&#39;ll never get a job with crooked teeth. Once back home I took her to a non-paid-by-treatment dentist who said she had 1 cavity in a baby tooth and her teeth certainly couldn&#39;t have braces until they were all through and she may not need them anyway they looked fine to him.<br/>
<br/>
As for genes, neither her father nor me has any fillings so she may be lucky.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97368086">No, we&#39;re not going back to school, but we did go shopping today at the big <br/>
mall nearby, along with many other families. We walked through the &quot;school&quot; <br/>
section of Zellers, I asked the kids if they wanted anything and they said <br/>
no. It is a good time to stock up on certain items which are really cheap <br/>
right now, though. I was glad I wasn&#39;t clutching three lists trying to find <br/>
every item to suit a teachers&#39; whims.<br/>
<br/>
We found sneakers for Eric who will only wear velcro strap ones. A while <br/>
back someone on this list recommended &quot;The Out of Sync Child&quot; which <br/>
describes Eric. We found some in his size, not always an easy task.<br/>
<br/>
We also went to a Teachers/educational toy store. While the boys played <br/>
with the trains and looked at toys, I looked at the teaching supplies. What <br/>
a bunch of junk! Some of the workbook and idea book titles are interesting <br/>
but when I look inside I think, just buy a real book! I know some children <br/>
do like workbooks but mine can&#39;t see the point. And the posters - one was <br/>
about how to work in a group, e.g. &quot;Praise each others&#39; ideas&quot; Ugh<br/>
<br/>
While the boys ate in the food court I went to get a coffee at Tim&#39;s (I <br/>
could see them the whole time). The woman in front of me had a strong <br/>
accent and the young woman pouring the coffee said, &quot;I have no idea what <br/>
you just said,&quot; as if she could care less. She then barked at me to get <br/>
back in line if I wanted to be served. I had moved to the side to make room <br/>
for people going past. I hope that my children will never be as angry as <br/>
she is, or, realistically, when they are angry I want them to know how to <br/>
deal with it appropriately, not take it out on others.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yuk!!!!!! I just received an e-mail from the local homeschool group we belong <br/>
to for activities and such , and it contained the Ten Reasons to HOmeschool <br/>
by Mary Pride. Oh boy, some things were ok, but things like preserving chastity <br/>
and not teaching the facts of life at too young an age, and learning to train <br/>
your child with adhd yourself made me shiver . I heard about this stuff here <br/>
on the list, but this is my first real brush with it in my own group. <br/>
No wonder they look at me like I have 3 eyes. We have organized a Not Back to <br/>
School Picnic for the first full day of school classes. Last year it was fun, <br/>
hope it is again.<br/>

  Teacher&#39;s store? Must have been Mic Mac Mall?<br/>

<br/>
But there are people who come to places like this and unschooling.com who <br/>
want that.  They want us to take turns &quot;being right&quot; or whatever.    <br/>
<br/>
I think praising good ideas is the best way to recognize good ideas, <br/>
encourage others to have good ideas and to encourage people to have MORE good ideas!<br/>

Gosh.  They believe in &quot;washed in the blood.&quot;  If it took blood to get them <br/>
on, I hope soap&#39;s enough to take them off.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I never wanted to admit that feeling but since you went first, I can say I <br/>
feel the same :o)  I have felt so elated going into a store for the cheap <br/>
&quot;school&quot; supplies like loads of crayons, markers and stuff for playing with at home. <br/>
 I was tickled when my DS (6) responded to the lady at the store.  She had <br/>
said, &quot;Oh, look at all the new school supplies, are you excited about school <br/>
this year? He said, &quot;sure cuz I stay home and don&#39;t have to go to one, this is <br/>
all of our &quot;not back to school&quot; stuff&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Walmart was actually handing out back to school pencils at the door, that <br/>
advertised that they were school supply central and he told the guy who handed <br/>
him one, &quot;thanks, can I still have this pencil if I am an unschooler&quot;?  I don&#39;t <br/>
think the guy knew what it meant but we got to keep the pencil anyway :o)  It <br/>
just feels so good, especially after a long year of Kindergarten last year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911270271">&lt;&lt;&lt;Why should tooth brushing have to be right before bed? If they brush a<br/>
couple of times a day, it&#39;s not going to matter what time it was.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have posted in the past about how we have totally let go of trying to<br/>
control Jayn&#39;s (4.5) toothbrushing *in any way*, to the point of silence<br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
A quick update: Over the past couple of weeks Jayn has spontaneously started<br/>
brushing her teeth several times a day - like 5 - using Disney Princess<br/>
toothpaste that she asked for, and a rotating selection of her numerous<br/>
brushes. I actually had to warn her that some of her gums were looking a bit<br/>
inflamed and to be gentle.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m just going to have to do the same thing and stop asking if I can I<br/>
brush her hair. The immense fuzzball knot in the back is starting to look<br/>
like a 50&#39;s beehive. Her hair appears to be growing shorter in the back.<br/>
Oh well.<br/>
