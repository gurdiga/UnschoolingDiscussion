<div id="ygrps-yiv-366187917">The discussion of another poster&#39;s SIL and her reaction to an <br/>
invitation to her 7yo&#39;s bday party reminded me of an incident in my <br/>
own house yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
My 6yo always schooled, heavily day cared and preschooled nephew was <br/>
visiting us with his dad yesterday.  They rode down on their 4 <br/>
wheelers.  While dad stayed outside and visited with my dh, nephew <br/>
came in to play.  He knows where all the cool stuff is in the house, <br/>
so came in asking to play computer.  I honestly answered him saying I <br/>
didn&#39;t know what my own daughters had loaded onto the computer in <br/>
question (meaning I didn&#39;t think his favorite Hot Wheels game of ours <br/>
was loaded on and unfortunately I was in the middle of dinner and <br/>
babysitting my grandbaby, so felt a bit too busy to stop everything <br/>
and load the game for him in the event).  I suggested, however, <br/>
another of his favorite things to do at our house, play Nintendo.  <br/>
The look he gave me made me ask him if he was in trouble and grounded <br/>
from the video games.  He said no.  I went over and turned on the <br/>
system and he was happy.  When asking his dad about it later, his <br/>
dad&#39;s only comment was &quot;He&#39;s always getting in trouble for <br/>
something.&quot;  A few short years ago, he was a bright inquisitive <br/>
energetic kid.  Now he&#39;s a trouble maker?  It is sad to see this <br/>
going on before your very eyes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088580102">I feel horrible for your nephew. <br/>
<br/>
It makes me think of my cousins 7yo daughter, she &quot;has&quot; to put her<br/>
young daughter on the bus every morning kicking and screaming. <br/>
<br/>
The girl has to see a therapist because she had actually started<br/>
pulling her hair out from all the stress.<br/>
 The therapist told my cousin if it was his daughter he would<br/>
homeschool her. <br/>
I thought i had her convinced.<br/>
 Unfortunatly her mother, my aunt has her convinced she is way to<br/>
flaky and she would do more harm than good , and couldn&#39;t possibly<br/>
homeschool her own daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I have another family member whose kids come when he whistles, yes<br/>
like very well trained dogs. They immediatly stop what they are doing<br/>
and run to him.<br/>
<br/>
I have a sil who won&#39;t let her kids stay at my house cause my kids<br/>
won&#39;t stay at her house. My 10yo stayed once when he was about 8 and<br/>
when he wanted a 2nd fried egg she said not until you finish your<br/>
whites(he hates whites just likes the yellow dippy part) He said he<br/>
would never go back without  me or his dad with him. The older one<br/>
just doesn&#39;t like to sleep over anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a sil who brags about her young girls 4 and 6 who are not<br/>
permitted to come to her bedroom. She&#39;s proud they know the rules so<br/>
well she once woke up and the youngest was laying right outside her<br/>
door in the hallway. Even though she had a horrible dream she followed<br/>
the rules. What a good girl !!!!<br/>
<br/>
And I am the family weirdo, the one thats going to screw up my<br/>
kids.The one that shouldn&#39;t have kids. Oh yes the sicko that lets her<br/>
10yo sleep in her bed  The 12 yo usually sleeps in the recliner in my<br/>
bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
Ever feel like the only person that actually sees children as people? <br/>
<br/>
Real live human beings? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh how I long for a secluded cabin in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
Well at least summer is ending, which means fewer family picnics<br/>
parties etc. It really stresses me out to see all those kids getting<br/>
treated like dirt. With a family like mine is it any wonder I don&#39;t<br/>
let my 2  too far out of my sight at these events.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to ramble<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233383645">&quot;The 12 yo usually sleeps in the recliner in my<br/>

<br/>
Have you considered getting an extra mattress for the floor of your room? <br/>
Just thinking it could get pretty uncomfortable sleeping in a chair all <br/>
night.<br/>
<br/>
We have neighbors that constantly want to know if our just turned 3 year old <br/>
is sleeping in her own room yet. Nope she&#39;s quite happy in her little <br/>
toddler bed attached to our bed. Our 8 month old co-sleeps so she moved to <br/>
the toddler bed a while ago. But we can cover her up when she needs it, or <br/>
give a snuggle or cuddle before she even fully awakes if she&#39;s having a bad <br/>
dream.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My answer would have been &#39;yes&#39; as our room WAS their room until such <br/>
stage as they wanted to sleep in the room where their clothes toys etc <br/>
and a &#39;spare&#39; bed were. Well, for the 3 younger ones - number one had to <br/>
suffer a more &#39;normal&#39; (haha) upbringing.<br/>

who sometimes longs for the good old days - my babies never sleep with <br/>
me now - a good thing in a way as they are all bigger than me - 15, 18, <br/>
22, 24, and one is 6&#39;3&quot;! But I so miss those night times.</div>
