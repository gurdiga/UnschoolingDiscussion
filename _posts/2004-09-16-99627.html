Don&#39;t let them roll over on you. You have the right to know if there is a <br/>
complaint about you, not who complained but if there is one.<br/>

I agree 100%. Even though you may feel you are drawing attention to <br/>
yourself...they need to be counciled on this...and of course if it <br/>
was some wierdo...that should be reported to the police. <br/>

<br/>
Related but slightly different story - my ex-husband&#39;s first wife used to<br/>
try to scare me any way she could and at one time when we were renovating<br/>
our house told me that it wasn&#39;t suitable for children and she was going to<br/>
call the child-protective agency and have them come take my kids away. I was<br/>
so scared but then got angry and called the agency myself, explained the<br/>
situation and asked &quot;what would happen if she does call?&quot; They said that<br/>
they would send someone to check and if they found something wrong, they<br/>
would tell me and help me find resources to eliminate the problem. What<br/>
started as a terrible fear actually turned into a resource and I called back<br/>
the first wife and said &quot;let me give you the number!&quot; <br/>

This is a great idea, although she has posted that she wants to get her<br/>
paperwork up to date - so perhaps she should do that first. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-636694248">Oh yes - backed way way down. I was almost ready to give up when the anger<br/>
started and I decided to try the creative approach. Honesty and try caring<br/>
weren&#39;t working so I just made them well aware that I was documenting<br/>
everything and then the final straw came when a note was sent home about why<br/>
my son&#39;s artwork was ripped up by a teacher because he wanted to finish it<br/>
and the teacher wanted him to move on to something else -well - I saw red<br/>
(no art pun intended) and decided to send a reply (documented) in which I<br/>
sought assurance that my families long tradition of creativity was being<br/>
given respect and that the officials of this academic establishment were not<br/>
trying to disparage our heritage. And miraculously, my son&#39;s &quot;behavior&quot;<br/>
improved - over-night. <br/>
<br/>
Later after a move to another district and the threat of having to go<br/>
through it all again I decided to pull them out. But it does work to<br/>
document and let them know you are. When you take the proactive, offensive<br/>
role, they can&#39;t get you on the defensive and eventually, they write you off<br/>
and deal with it the way it is. <br/>
