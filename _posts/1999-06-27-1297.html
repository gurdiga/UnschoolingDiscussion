<div id="ygrps-yiv-185948546"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I used to tell people to read the Colfax books because I thought their<br/>
 </span></blockquote>children were particularly shining examples of success.  I still think the<br/>
Colfaxes succeeded, but my definition of success has changed somewhat. <br/>
 <br/>
People who see success as achieving social status and a lot of money will<br/>
no doubt be impressed by what the Colfaxes have achieved.  However, there<br/>
are more than a few people out there who are applying very different<br/>
criteria of success to their lives and by those criteria succeeding <br/>
brilliantly.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, by my criteria the Colfax boys are succeeding brilliantly.  From <br/>
the latest issue of HEM (first written on the HEM website:  &quot;Grant is still a <br/>
physician in San Fransisco working in public health and is a noted AIDS <br/>
reseracher.  Reed is married and a dad . . . they live near Washington, DC <br/>
where he works as a civil rights attorney in the field of fair housing.  <br/>
Drew, an attorney, works for the  Southern Poverty Law Center (I think) <br/>
working on appeals for death row inmates.  Garth resides in Sacramento with <br/>
his wife.  He works with developmentally disabled individuals and restores <br/>
old houses.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see any of the Colfaxes as having achieved &quot;social status&quot; (now <br/>
*there&#39;s* a term that begs definition) or great wealth.  I see them as people <br/>
who had joyful childhoods filled with interesting work who grew up to achieve <br/>
their own goals and are using their skills and talents to help other people.  <br/>
<br/>
Please note that I said &quot;their own goals&quot;.  I am not setting goals for my <br/>
children, but I most definitely want to provide support for them to achieve <br/>
the goals they set for themselves.  If my kids want to become attorneys or <br/>
doctors I would support that.  I wouldn&#39;t encourage it &lt;g&gt; but I would <br/>
support it.  But I hope that my children help others, no matter what career <br/>
path they choose.<br/>
<br/>
I think the value in the Colfax&#39;s books is that they lay out convincing <br/>
examples of the fact that kids do not need to spend their childhoods in heavy <br/>
academic pursuit in order to survive in academia later on.  Yes, there are <br/>
unschoolers who are not interested in academia.  That&#39;s fine.  But judging <br/>
from the questions that come up again and again on the homeschooling message <br/>
boards, I think that most homeschoolers (especially new homeschoolers) want <br/>
to know that their children will have the option of attending college.<br/>
