hoped... I read it all through cooking dinner, but the most UNEXPECTED <br/>
thing happened though:  dh [who is still cynical, a by-stander of <br/>
unschooling/ life] picked it up and he READ it!!!  ya!<br/>

I&#39;m glad your husband read it.  Glad you liked it.  Hope you didn&#39;t  <br/>
read it so fast the careful word choices flew by like fenceposts on  <br/>
the side of the freeway!  (Yeah, sometimes I was artsy; not always. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

thing :)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t read that fast, but most of all I tried to look at all the <br/>
pictures, a lot of sweet pictures... really this is a great book.<br/>

Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I used to read really fast, probable due to all the school training,  <br/>
and the fact that if I &quot;finished&quot; fast I could do other things, so I  <br/>
got into the habit of thinking &quot;finished&quot; was good.  But I started to  <br/>
realize that even with non-fiction, going slowing enough to  <br/>
appreciate the way the person wrote was much better than &quot;finishing,&quot;  <br/>
and that some of the reading I had finished really amounted only to  <br/>
&quot;skim.&quot;  I remember the whole Evelyn Wood Speed Reading Course days,  <br/>
when magazine articles would tell the secrets of that course, and  <br/>
teachers at school would teach us to &quot;skim for comprehension.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of it just the day before you wrote what you wrote,  <br/>
because Holly doesn&#39;t like menus, and two restaurants she goes to  <br/>
often have LONG, big, changeable menus.  One is painted out on a full  <br/>
sheet of plywood and isn&#39;t on paper and the other one is about 12  <br/>
pages long.  She reads pretty quickly, but doesn&#39;t skim.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re liking the photos.  I never intended to have any  <br/>
until I discovered that a magazine-page-length article was over two  <br/>
pages long and rarely three pages, so I started looking for filler.   <br/>
It made the project MUCH more complicated, but I like the final  <br/>
result too.<br/>
