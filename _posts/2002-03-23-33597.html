<div id="ygrps-yiv-814211711">I have been enjoying reading a lot of the posts and I am learning so <br/>
much.<br/>
I espacially love your view on unschooling Sandra.<br/>
I heard some body ones said that &quot;education is not the most <br/>
important thing for a child&quot;<br/>
I feel like in this society we are so focused on if are kids are <br/>
reading well, doing math etc. that we forget to see how are they <br/>
feeling , are they happy etc.<br/>
You really nailed it for me Sandra when you said your kids never <br/>
ever go to sleep crying, how you focused on their happiness.<br/>
I believe  that if children are in a loving, free ,trusting <br/>
enviroment learning happens naturally. <br/>

Forgive my grammar and spelling mistakes.<br/>
English is my third language.<br/>

What languages are your children speaking?  <br/>
<br/>
An American friend of mine married a Swede and moved there.  I love hearing <br/>
the language difference stories.  She goes to language school for immigrants.<br/>

you have the &#39;right&#39; job?  do you have the &#39;right car? etc.<br/>

Instead of pursuing happiness, we seem to be pursuing stuff.<br/>
