     So true, Robin!  I&#39;ve noticed this with my older kids as well.  People <br/>
talk about how hard the teen years are and it doesn&#39;t feel that way at all to <br/>
me.  I know it&#39;s all due to unschooling...no peer pressure, no bullying <br/>
issues, no pressure on my part to keep up with a ton of schoolwork that is <br/>
crammed for and then forgotten, etc.<br/>
     In some ways, I enjoy my kids more and more as they get older because we <br/>
have so many common interests and they are such interesting people to talk <br/>
to.  But I also love the unique aspects of the littler ones as well...My <br/>
older kids didn&#39;t start off as homeschoolers and I used to miss them a lot <br/>
when they were in school in years past.  I was always glad when summer or <br/>
Christmas vacation started.  It&#39;s sad to me that so many families get so used <br/>
to not being around each other that the parents say they can&#39;t wait till the <br/>
kids get back to school again.<br/>
