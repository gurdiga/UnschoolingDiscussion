<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400579335">Good morning!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty new to unschooling, and to this board as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
I must admit that, at first, I was quite taken aback<br/>
by what seemed to be a pretty high level of bickering<br/>
here in this group. But, I try not to be hasty, so I<br/>
kept reading, and reading, and reading .... (This is<br/>
such an active group!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I kept reading. It&#39;s beginning to seem to me<br/>
-- and I hope I&#39;m right -- that the challenges are,<br/>
for the most part, an attempt to help each other think<br/>
seriously about what unschooling IS and examine our<br/>
motives in what we do with/for our children, and not<br/>
just meaningless arguing for arguing&#39;s sake.<br/>
(Although, if I may be a bit presumptuous, I think I<br/>
may have seen a BIT of that type of arguing here, too.<br/>
But hey, we&#39;re all human and all still learning,<br/>
right?)<br/>
<br/>
I think the &quot;strewing&quot; topic is a great example. I<br/>
haven&#39;t been a &quot;strewer&quot; in the past, but I think I<br/>
might try a little random strewing in the future. What<br/>
I&#39;ve learned from reading the posts is that the<br/>
strewing is fine, as long as you don&#39;t get hung up on<br/>
the outcome (I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t remember who exactly<br/>
said that, but to me, that was a really important<br/>
point.) Isn&#39;t that something really fundamental about<br/>
unschooling? To focus on the process rather than the<br/>
outcome? On the love of learning, not on objective<br/>
measures like tests?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the posts. I&#39;ve enjoyed reading them and<br/>
hope to read lots more!<br/>
<br/>

All human and MOST sincerely interested in learning.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Isn&#39;t that something really fundamental about<br/>
unschooling? To focus on the process rather than the<br/>
outcome? On the love of learning, not on objective<br/>
measures like tests?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think so.  If &quot;the outcome&quot; is a love of learning, then that one&#39;s fine to <br/>
focus on. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think when people are saying to leave something out but not be attached to <br/>
the outcome, they mean if you leave the castle blocks out and three days <br/>
later nobody has built a single little tower, don&#39;t have an internal attack <br/>
about it, just put them back up and bring them out again in a month or a <br/>
year.  That was WHOLLY hypothetical, because we have some of those Spanish <br/>
castle blocks we bought used for $5--a big thrill because the set was over <br/>
$80 new--and when they appear in public they are invariably used by two or <br/>
three people.  I hate to take those things apart.  I should have started a <br/>
scrapbook to go with the box, but that would have taken away from the plain <br/>
joy of making something from nothing, it would have turned it into an ongoing <br/>
project, a competition of sorts.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of our greatest successes here with just leaving things out has been a <br/>
visitor (adult or kid) who knows something cool to do with or to explain <br/>
about the thing (puzzles, magnets, building stuff, prism, magnifying lenses, <br/>
whatever it is) and whose contributions change everyone around them!  That <br/>
knowledge is added to the richness of that item, for the next time it comes <br/>
out.  <br/>
