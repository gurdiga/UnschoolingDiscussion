<br/>
The subject of this issue is the concept of &quot;memes.&quot; An excerpt from the essay:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Nothing today is more sought after than the attention of human beings.<br/>
Manufactures, educators, religions, cults, sales organizations, publishers,<br/>
advertisers, politicians, celebrities, and all of the various kinds of<br/>
media vie for our mindfulness. Can we afford that any of these entities<br/>
should know more than we do about how we acquire, keep, hold, and pass on<br/>
our ideas?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Self-University Newsletter&quot; is free. Please tell anyone you think might be<br/>
