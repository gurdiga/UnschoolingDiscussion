First of all, congratulations on your impending arrival, my borther and his wife just had a new baby two weeks ago.  Very exciting for everyone, especially their two daughters.<br/>
<br/>
I just had to comment on the above.  The Pro-Life advocates ARE VERY vocal and insistent about their beliefs and surely DO shove them down the throats of others.  By your use of &quot;we&quot; I must assume you are talking about your own family and your personal beliefs, because the Pro-life movement is absolutely merciless.  <br/>
<br/>
Pro-Life supporters picket clinics and shout obsceneties at pregnant women, without knowing anything about their personal circumstances or what brought them to the excruciating decision to termiante a pregnancy.  The wave signs and banners with slurs and condemnations on them, they block entrance to clinics.  The lunatic fringe of this movement has shot and killed people over their &quot;Defense of Life.&quot;  I am baffled as to why you would feel indignant that others would find some of the behavior of the Pro-Life movement and their campaigns to be intrusive and abusive.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry that you have had to endure the shameful behavior of others who try to judge your lifestyle.  I believe you when you say you are attacked for your decision to live your lives in a way that upholds your spiritual beliefs.  I get attacked for doing the very same thing.  But remember all the hatred and nastiness that has been flung from both sides of this issue, before you cry out injustice over the accusations made against any one side.  This debate is a heated one wherever it springs up because, like religion, it is a deeply emotional issue for those involved.<br/>

Thank you for your response and for helping to make something clear.  <br/>
You are correct in thinking that &quot;we&quot; does mean my husband and me.  <br/>
I&#39;d also like to thank you for understanding the nature of the post; <br/>
there are people who have their beliefs and do their best to lives <br/>
them out, whether it&#39;s based on spirituality or not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll also thank you for seeing that people on the &quot;other side&quot; of the <br/>
pro-choice issue are attacked and that others believe they should be <br/>
the ones deciding your life.<br/>
<br/>
There was a message posted a little while ago that expressed the <br/>
point-of-view of some religions or fanatics.  I&#39;m not sure how one <br/>
person is the spokesperson for these religions or that that one <br/>
person should be speaking for all those belonging to those <br/>
religions.  Like all the decisions in our life, yes, they are based <br/>
on faith, but are also conscienscious, independent and free-thinking <br/>
decisions, much like our decision to unschool for countless reasons.<br/>
<br/>
This is a heated topic and all who broach it know this.  This topic <br/>
should not entitle others to vehemently critize each other.  If it <br/>
was my place, I would apologize to those of you who have been <br/>
offended, obstructed or treated in a violent way when going to <br/>
procure an abortion.  Just as, if it was my place, I would apologize <br/>
to the women who have chosen abortion and have suffered the sometimes <br/>
painful consequences of it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m posting kind of late.  Just wanted to say that I originally read &quot;we&quot;<br/>
as meaning a whole political group (&quot;pro-lifers&quot;).  Not sure why I read it<br/>
that way.  Maybe there was a largeish &quot;they&quot; somewhere in the same<br/>
paragraph?  I don&#39;t know.  Just wanted to say that it is sometimes easy to<br/>
read a meaning that was not what the poster&#39;s intent.<br/>
<br/>
A major difficulty with the English language and online discussion is that<br/>
some words are so vague.  &quot;We&quot; and &quot;you&quot; can enclose groups of almost any<br/>
size.  (I think facial expressions and body language give more clues in<br/>
face to face discussion.)  And, setting this discussion aside, I&#39;ve seen<br/>
other discussions get hot when people generalize about &quot;teachers&quot; or &quot;dads&quot;<br/>
or &quot;women&quot; or &quot;teens&quot;.  It&#39;s never clear whether the sentence &quot;Women are so<br/>
_____&quot;  or &quot;Californians are so _____&quot; really means a few women, many<br/>
women, a preponderence of women, or every last woman.<br/>
<br/>
(Often, it seems to mean &quot;more than 1/2 of the women I have met&quot; and<br/>
provokes fervent disagreement from anyone who has met one or more women who<br/>
don&#39;t fit the statement.)  (I&#39;ve seen so many online wrangles that fit this<br/>
pattern that it isn&#39;t funny.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the English language needs some modifiers that add extra precision.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it is human nature to generalize and categorize.  BUT... you all<br/>
are free &lt;g&gt; to disagree with this sweeping statement.  Generalizations and<br/>
categories can be very confining, and can limit thinking.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I know everyone has their own opinions, and I&#39;m certainly not going to <br/>
change anyone&#39;s personal opinions.  But I get so saddened, and sickened <br/>
actually, when people use life situations to justify abortion without even <br/>
acknowledging an alternative. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi, it is fascinating to listen to everyone&#39;s opinion, we could make up a <br/>
great debate team here. I have always enjoyed listening to debates. <br/>
<br/>
Giving up a child, that is unwanted, for adoption does seem like the obvious <br/>
answer. Then the Mother does not have to raise the child and a childless <br/>
couple now has a baby. It should be the perfect solution, but it just does <br/>
not always seem to happen that way. Maybe that is because the Mom thinks she <br/>
can give the baby up, then she has the baby, and we all know how bonding and <br/>
love filling birth is. She then changes her mind and just can&#39;t or won&#39;t part <br/>
with the child. Maybe she deludes herself into thinking she will change her <br/>
life, maybe she can, most likely she can&#39;t. Time passes and it is too hard. <br/>
Possibly there was no one to help her find the right road, maybe she has an <br/>
addiction that she thought she could kick, or maybe the Father of the child <br/>
is in and out of the picture and the problem. Raising a baby is harder than <br/>
she thought it would be. The situations that these Mothers find themselves in <br/>
is endless but a common thread runs through them all, it is the child who <br/>
suffers. I have a friend who worked for years in one of California&#39;s homes <br/>
for abused children. Her shift was spent trying to help children who had <br/>
endured abuse that she said was unbelievable. Most of us (thankfully) cannot <br/>
even imagine what these kids had been through. This place was the end of the <br/>
road for these kids. They had been abused so severely that they could not be <br/>
with the rest of the world. They would be staying at this center until at 18 <br/>
hopefully they could be released to live a life of their own. If the damage <br/>
was not too severe. These kids are the worse scenario but all too real. So <br/>
what is the answer. I feel that abortion is better than torture, at least the <br/>
child is at peace. I have a favorite author, Wayne Dyer, who says that to <br/>
fight against something makes it grow. So if you want to stop war don&#39;t be <br/>
against war, be for peace. If you want to stop abortion, the answer seems to <br/>
be in not stopping abortions but to take away the need to have one. I suppose <br/>
the questions that we need to ask ourselves is what are we doing to help <br/>
change the life of the children that are already here? How can we make their <br/>
lives better? How can we help the Mother who obviously is going to need help <br/>
with her new baby? What can be done so there are fewer of unwanted <br/>
pregnancies? I know there are some good programs out there but I also know it <br/>
is not enough. This is a huge problem that goes far beyond abortions. But we <br/>
all know that. I think, (just my opinion here) that the people that are <br/>
actively protesting abortion should instead volunteer that time to helping <br/>
the children that are already on this earth. Then they would make a <br/>
difference. Then they would be working to stop abortion. (End of speech!)<br/>
<br/>
I do not think that debating this issue or any issue is bad. I am not here to <br/>
change your opinion, or to have mine changed. But it is interesting and <br/>
educational to hear what people have to say. We hear new point to ponder and <br/>
we learn something. Sometimes it is hard to not get angry. Perhaps that is <br/>
because of the way that opinions are written or because it is easier to not <br/>
be fully understood when opinions are stated in the written form. I am not <br/>
trying to change anyone, I am just stating my views. And when we are all <br/>
talked out I want to part as friends ready to move onto the next subject and <br/>
grow from that experience. Sometimes we agree and sometimes we do not, and <br/>
both are ok<br/>
peace and grace<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi everyone!  I have been out of town so I am late to this discussion, but <br/>
I wanted to add my 2 cents here.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think most problems do not stem from abortion itself, or the <br/>
idea of adoption.  Many of the problems come from the fact that we are a <br/>
very puritanical society, even to this day.  Sex is still a MAJOR <br/>
taboo.  Most women, it seems to me, do not have abortions because they want <br/>
to, but because in reality it is much easier to deal with that personal <br/>
anguish than it is the stigma of being impregnated out of wedlock or while <br/>
you are a teen.  The fact is that most of these people do not have a strong <br/>
enough support base to even get them through the *idea* of being pregnant, <br/>
let alone either raising the child or putting it up for adoption.<br/>
<br/>
I see so many so called &#39;pro lifers&#39; (and I hate that term, all of us are <br/>
PRO life, no one is PRO abortion or PRO death) turn up their noses at a <br/>
young pregnant girl.  I had this one friend back in school who got <br/>
pregnant, and we wanted to give her a baby shower, but her pro life mother <br/>
would not allow us to have it there because it would just &#39;encourage&#39; her <br/>
daughter to more bad behavior!  This woman made my friends life a HELL <br/>
while she was pregnant and treated that baby as less than human while my <br/>
friend lived at home.  Sadly, I think this happens a lot.<br/>
<br/>
We have created a society for ourselves in which the decision to end a life <br/>
is often times much more acceptable than the treatment we get during the <br/>
actual pregnancy, and that is just sad.  Girls get kicked out of their <br/>
homes, boys leave the girls to do it alone, friends shun, families ignore, <br/>
people on the street look down their noses, and the world in general seems <br/>
like a mean and evil place.<br/>
<br/>
I know because I have been there myself!  I got pregnant with our oldest <br/>
when I was 18 (and looked much younger than that).  My now husband still <br/>
lived at home (he was 21, saving for school).  When we found out, we <br/>
discussed our options.  I was going to move out to my mothers (she lived <br/>
out of town) and put the child up for adoption.  Scott said that we should <br/>
have the child together and be a family, come what may!  So, we got an apt <br/>
together right before xmas (but waited to tell everyone until after the <br/>
holidays).  When his parents found out (good pro life catholics) I was not <br/>
ALLOWED back in the house.  They did not want to see me, hear about me, <br/>
know about me, period.  They did not want the **NEIGHBORS** to see me <br/>
either.  They said they would change their tune if we got married, but at <br/>
the time we were not sure we wanted to. I mean, a baby does NOT make a <br/>
marriage.  I hid my pregnancy from my dad for quite some time.  But once he <br/>
found out it was OH HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM IN YOU!!!!!  I was the oldest and <br/>
meant to set an example, blah blah blah.  My grandmother (also pro life) <br/>
was totally HORRIFIED!!  How sad for me to RUIN my life at such a young <br/>
age!!  My friends thankfully stuck by us, but they did make it pretty clear <br/>
that they thought we were idiots.   I worked at a Bagel shop to help make <br/>
ends meet, and the looks and comments I got from some of the customers <br/>
brought tears to my eyes!!<br/>
<br/>
After Ian was born, things pretty much only got worse.  By that time we had <br/>
married, and I was let back in my in laws house (only now I was expected to <br/>
be the perfect butt kissing d-i-l  and I was NOT playing that game).  Every <br/>
parenting thing I did, I did WRONG in their eyes.  Ian&#39;s birth had been <br/>
very traumatic, and I ended up with an infection.  They put me on <br/>
antibiotics (no one asked if I was nursing!) and Ian ended up with <br/>
thrush.  I had never heard or seen this stuff, and I kept trying to wipe it <br/>
off his mouth.  I had no idea what caused it.  Of course, my mother in law <br/>
said it was because I was filthy and I was passing that along to my <br/>
baby.  What a B&(#&$.  You get the idea I think.<br/>
<br/>
So, when Ian was 5 months old, I ended up pregnant again.  Here I was <br/>
married to a guy I really loved (and who loved me), but because I could not <br/>
put myself through what the families would say, we decided to abort that <br/>
pregnancy.  It was a hard decision, one I regret because I did not make it <br/>
on MY grounds, but based on the world around me. I was barely 20 and <br/>
pregnant again.  The pregnancy with Ian had been so difficult emotionally, <br/>
I just was not ready to deal with it again.  Even when we did plan our <br/>
daughters pregnancy a few years later we got to hear all of the negativity <br/>
again!<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, I do not think I am alone in this.  I think many young girls find <br/>
the idea of carrying through with the pregnancy itself the hard part, not <br/>
giving the child up at the end.  I think a lot figure it is easier to end <br/>
it before it becomes a problem, before they loose the respect of their <br/>
parents and peers.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, abortion is NOT the problem, it is a symptom.  The fact that <br/>
we have created a judgmental and unsympathetic  society that refuses to <br/>
embrace life IS the problem. We shun and belittle instead of helping and <br/>
creating a support system for these young women (we would not want to <br/>
encourage this behavior after all!!).  Instead of giving them help when <br/>
they need it, they get treated like dogs  and forced to deal with a hard <br/>
situation mostly on their own.   We would rather keep our children in the <br/>
dark than arm them with the information and resources they need to make a <br/>
good decision when it comes to sex.  We want to pretend that if we refuse <br/>
to help them before it comes up, that it will NEVER come up.  We like to <br/>
pretend that just because we think we have instilled our so called &#39;good <br/>
values&#39; in our kids that they will never make a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
If you really want abortion to end, you need to work on the problems BEFORE <br/>
they happen.  I do not mean standing out there protesting and preaching and <br/>
shunning once the deed is done, by then it is mostly too late.  I mean real <br/>
EDUCATION, real ALTERNATIVES, real SUPPORT for when something like this <br/>
does happen.  None of us ever wants our kids to grow up and start having <br/>
sex, but it happens.  It happens a lot. Even from the best families with <br/>
the best values.  Hopefully we will instill enough sense in our kids so <br/>
that they do not want to go out and to this.  I hope that my kids will <br/>
understand that the act of sex, though great and pleasurable, can also lead <br/>
to the creation of a new life, and that is an awesome responsibility.  I <br/>
hope that the lines of communication are open enough they  will come to me <br/>
for advice if they have a relationship intense enough to lead to sex.  And <br/>
I hope I am strong enough to help them through it without freaking out and <br/>
making their decisions for them.  I trust them with their education, <br/>
hopefully I will trust that they will be making an educated decision when <br/>
it comes to sex too.  If they do not, and mess up, I will hopefully be able <br/>
to help them make whatever decision is best, whether that be abortion, <br/>
raising the child, or adoption.<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling will help though.  Our kids have not been raised in an <br/>
atmosphere of peer pressure and competition.  Their self esteem will be <br/>
intact, not destroyed by the school bullies and the system.  They will <br/>
already know how to make good, educated decision on their own, and not look <br/>
to the world at large for acceptance, nor fear its shunning.  I do not <br/>
think this is a cure all, but I think it is a good start to raising <br/>
smarter, much more life savvy kids.<br/>
<br/>
I am starting to ramble!  I just wanted to throw out my opinions!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644076416">Dear Sandi,<br/>
    Thank you for sharing your story. I&#39;m inspired by you and your husband <br/>
creating a family at such a young age and still being together now, having <br/>
overcome such obstacles. I think these personal stories are really important. <br/>
To me they show that this is a multifaceted issue, not one with just two <br/>
sides.<br/>
    I wanted to be a mother my whole life. For me it is definitely a <br/>
&quot;calling.&quot; When I got pregnant at 22 I felt like I had waited forever. There <br/>
was no way I had figured out adult life but I felt ready for a child. My life <br/>
was really untogether and I still lived with my parents but it was definitely <br/>
the next step for me. <br/>
    I feel blessed that my &quot;pro-life&quot; parents were supportive. They had <br/>
changed churches a couple of years before (Lutheran) but I was still singing <br/>
in our old church. They suggested I switch to their church to spare myself <br/>
the judgments of those people. I appreciate this anew after reading your <br/>
story. My oldest dd(now 20) and I had a rough beginning but are now part of a <br/>
strong and healthy family. I got married when she was 3 and my husband <br/>
adopted her. I have been very lucky and gotten pregnant only when I <br/>
consciously chose to and each time (3) I was deeply aware that having the <br/>
choice to continue was important to me. -Amalia-</div>

&gt;&lt;&lt; I know everyone has their own opinions, and I&#39;m certainly not going to<br/>
&gt;change anyone&#39;s personal opinions.  But I get so saddened, and sickened<br/>
&gt;actually, when people use life situations to justify abortion without even<br/>
&gt;acknowledging an alternative. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi, it is fascinating to listen to everyone&#39;s opinion, we could make up a<br/>
&gt;great debate team here. I have always enjoyed listening to debates.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Giving up a child, that is unwanted, for adoption does seem like the <br/>
&gt;obvious<br/>
&gt;answer. Then the Mother does not have to raise the child and a childless<br/>
&gt;couple now has a baby. It should be the perfect solution, but it just does<br/>
&gt;not always seem to happen that way. Maybe that is because the Mom thinks <br/>
&gt;she<br/>
&gt;can give the baby up, then she has the baby, and we all know how bonding <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;love filling birth is. She then changes her mind and just can&#39;t or won&#39;t <br/>
&gt;part<br/>
&gt;with the child. Maybe she deludes herself into thinking she will change her<br/>
&gt;life, maybe she can, most likely she can&#39;t. Time passes and it is too hard.<br/>
&gt;Possibly there was no one to help her find the right road, maybe she has an<br/>
&gt;addiction that she thought she could kick, or maybe the Father of the child<br/>
&gt;is in and out of the picture and the problem. Raising a baby is harder than<br/>
&gt;she thought it would be. The situations that these Mothers find themselves <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;is endless but a common thread runs through them all, it is the child who<br/>
&gt;suffers. I have a friend who worked for years in one of California&#39;s homes<br/>
&gt;for abused children. Her shift was spent trying to help children who had<br/>
&gt;endured abuse that she said was unbelievable. Most of us (thankfully) <br/>
&gt;cannot<br/>
&gt;even imagine what these kids had been through. This place was the end of <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;road for these kids. They had been abused so severely that they could not <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;with the rest of the world. They would be staying at this center until at <br/>
&gt;18<br/>
&gt;hopefully they could be released to live a life of their own. If the damage<br/>
&gt;was not too severe. These kids are the worse scenario but all too real. So<br/>
&gt;what is the answer. I feel that abortion is better than torture, at least <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;child is at peace. I have a favorite author, Wayne Dyer, who says that to<br/>
&gt;fight against something makes it grow. So if you want to stop war don&#39;t be<br/>
&gt;against war, be for peace. If you want to stop abortion, the answer seems <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;be in not stopping abortions but to take away the need to have one. I <br/>
&gt;suppose<br/>
&gt;the questions that we need to ask ourselves is what are we doing to help<br/>
&gt;change the life of the children that are already here? How can we make <br/>
&gt;their<br/>
&gt;lives better? How can we help the Mother who obviously is going to need <br/>
&gt;help<br/>
&gt;with her new baby? What can be done so there are fewer of unwanted<br/>
&gt;pregnancies? I know there are some good programs out there but I also know <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;is not enough. This is a huge problem that goes far beyond abortions. But <br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt;all know that. I think, (just my opinion here) that the people that are<br/>
&gt;actively protesting abortion should instead volunteer that time to helping<br/>
&gt;the children that are already on this earth. Then they would make a<br/>
&gt;difference. Then they would be working to stop abortion. (End of speech!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I do not think that debating this issue or any issue is bad. I am not here <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;change your opinion, or to have mine changed. But it is interesting and<br/>
&gt;educational to hear what people have to say. We hear new point to ponder <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;we learn something. Sometimes it is hard to not get angry. Perhaps that is<br/>
&gt;because of the way that opinions are written or because it is easier to not<br/>
&gt;be fully understood when opinions are stated in the written form. I am not<br/>
&gt;trying to change anyone, I am just stating my views. And when we are all<br/>
&gt;talked out I want to part as friends ready to move onto the next subject <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;grow from that experience. Sometimes we agree and sometimes we do not, and<br/>
&gt;both are ok<br/>
&gt;peace and grace<br/>
&gt;Candy<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you for sharing your story as well!!  It is great when you can get <br/>
the support you need.  I had my tubes tied at the age of 22 because I knew <br/>
that two was pretty much all we could handle, emotionally and <br/>
financially.  I think really understanding your limitations and what you <br/>
are capable of can go a long ways towards reducing abortion too.  There are <br/>
times when that maternal instinct pops up and I feel sort of regretful that <br/>
I had my tubes tied, then the bills start pouring in, the kids need new <br/>
shoes, the car needs a new water pump, etc. So now my sisters are having <br/>
kids and I have tons of nieces to play with (and I can give them back when <br/>
they cry/poop/whine hahahah!).  My sister Cindy opted to have her tubes <br/>
tied at 25 for the same reasons I did (also after her second child).  Our <br/>
next sister in line (there are 4 of us) is now pregnant and has talked also <br/>
about having her tubes tied after this second child.    Some are <br/>
comfortable having lots of kids.  My whole family does not seem to be <br/>
(mostly because we watched our own parents flounder because my mother kept <br/>
having children in hopes of giving my dad a son, which was something <br/>
society had told her: MEN WANTED A SON, which btw my dad had no real <br/>
interest in!).<br/>
<br/>
I am starting to ramble again!  My point is that a woman and or family <br/>
should feel comfortable with their reproductive choices, as you say you <br/>
did.   It is important to have choices, so that you can really make the <br/>
right one.<br/>
