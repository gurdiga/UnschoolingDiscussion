&lt;&lt; Does anyone have a typical Statement of Faith from a major exclusionary<br/>
Christian homeschooling group?  That might clarify what specific beliefs<br/>
we are talking about.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Statement of Faith<br/>
<br/>
We believe the Bible to be the only infallible authoritative Word of God. (II <br/>
Tim. 3:16) <br/>
We believe God is one divine Spirit eternally manifested as Father, Son and <br/>
Holy Spirit. (Jn 10:29f; Jn 10:30 ; Jn 15:26) <br/>
<br/>
We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His <br/>
sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His <br/>
shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of <br/>
the Father, and in His visible and physical return to earth. <br/>
<br/>
We believe all have sinned and as a result are alienated from God (Rom. 3:23, <br/>
5:12), and that eternal redemption is only brought about by faith in the <br/>
finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. 10: 9-10; Eph. 2:8-9). <br/>
<br/>
We believe that if one rejects the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ, he <br/>
subjects himself to eternal damnation and separation from God the Father and <br/>
will spend eternity in a literal place called hell (Rev. 21:8). <br/>
<br/>
We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, by whose indwelling, <br/>
the Christian is enabled to live a godly life. (Rom. 8:13-14; I Cor. 3:16, <br/>
6:19-20; Eph. 4:30, 5:18). <br/>
<br/>
We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Confession of Faith from<br/>
The Old Schoolhouseâ„¢<br/>
<br/>
Jesus Christ, the Word is God. God the Father is God. The Holy Spirit is God. <br/>
There are no gods but one God<br/>
.<br/>
We believe in God the Father who is the Maker of the heavens and the earth; <br/>
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord. Jesus Christ was conceived by <br/>
the Holy Spirit, and was born of a virgin, Mary. He ministered to many during <br/>
His ministry, never once sinning. He suffered tremendously under Pontius <br/>
Pilate, was crucified on a cross, died, was buried (descending into Hades at <br/>
that time), and then ROSE again on the third day, from the dead! After <br/>
rising, which shocked and amazed many witnesses, causing them to worship Him <br/>
and acknowledge Him as God in the flesh, Jesus ascended into Heaven, where He <br/>
sits at the right hand of God the Father. Back to Earth He shall come again, <br/>
to judge the living and the dead.<br/>
<br/>
We believe in the Holy Spirit, one holy Christian church, the communion of <br/>
all true saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and <br/>
the eternal (never-ending) gift of life.<br/>
<br/>
We believe that the Bible is the ONLY inerrant Word of God. In it we can find <br/>
all instructions in righteousness, holiness and faith. It is our <br/>
authoritative &quot;handbook&quot; for Christian living...the ONLY book that is <br/>
necessary for our faith.<br/>
<br/>
We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons; <br/>
Father, Son and Holy Spirit. This ONE God is omnipotent, omnipresent and <br/>
omniscient. This God is also holy, righteous, good, loving and full of mercy, <br/>
by character. He is the Creator of all things. He sustains all things.<br/>
<br/>
We believe that Jesus Christ, Who is our Lord God, is fully God, yet fully <br/>
man. Only through Jesus Christ can man find redemption, and have eternal <br/>
life. Without Jesus Christ, man cannot find eternal life, but will spend <br/>
eternity apart from God, in suffering. This eternal life with God is freely <br/>
given of God, but must be accessed His way, which is through His son, our <br/>
Lord Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
We believe in the full deity of the Holy Spirit, and acknowledge His role as <br/>
God, in creation and in redemption, and very importantly as our Comforter. <br/>
The present ministry of the Holy Spirit, among many things is to indwell in <br/>
the Christian, enabling him to live a godly life.<br/>
<br/>
We believe that man is in rebellion against God because of Adam&#39;s sin. Man&#39;s <br/>
very nature is evil, and all are bound for hell, a place of eternal darkness <br/>
and torment, unless the Father calls him. For salvation of any man, <br/>
regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely necessary. We are made <br/>
righteous by God, through faith in Him, and although faith without works is <br/>
dead, it is faith ALONE which brings salvation.<br/>
<br/>
We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; those who are <br/>
saved to the resurrection of life, and those who are lost to the resurrection <br/>
of damnation.<br/>
<br/>
We believe that at the perfect time in history, God chose to reveal Himself, <br/>
and to declare His will to His Church. Afterwards, for the purpose of <br/>
preserving and propagating the truth, and for the more certain establishment <br/>
and comfort of the Church against corruption, and the malice of Satan and of <br/>
the world, it pleased Him to commit this revealed will to the written word. <br/>
This word, the Word (Bible), is very necessary to the Church, vitally <br/>
important, for His former methods of revealing His will to His people are now <br/>
ceased.<br/>
<br/>
The Holy Scripture (the Bible or the Word) consists of all of the books of <br/>
the Old and New Testaments, which are Genesis through Malachi, and Matthew <br/>
through Revelation, respectively. Each and every one of these books are given <br/>
by inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life.<br/>
There are several books, commonly called the Apocrypha, which are not of <br/>
divine inspiration, and are no part of the canon of Scripture. Therefore, <br/>
they can not be used as an authority from which to draw from, in the Church <br/>
of God. They are not to be more esteemed, or made use of, than any other <br/>
works of printed materials.<br/>
<br/>
The authority of the Bible does not depend on the testimony or tradition of <br/>
any man or church, but entirely upon God, who is Truth itself, and the Author <br/>
of truth. It is therefore to be received as the highest authority, and can be <br/>
depended on fully, without any supplementation. It is the divinely inspired <br/>
Word of God.<br/>
<br/>
The whole counsel of God, concerning all things necessary for God&#39;s glory, <br/>
man&#39;s salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture or <br/>
may be deduced from Scripture. Nothing whatsoever is to be added to this, <br/>
whether by &quot;new revelations&quot; of the Spirit or by the traditions of man.<br/>
<br/>
The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself. <br/>
Therefore, when there is a question or misunderstanding about the true and <br/>
full sense of any passage in the Bible, it must be searched and known by <br/>
other places in God&#39;s Word that speak more clearly, always considering <br/>
biblical context.<br/>
<br/>
We believe that there is one living and true God. He is infinite, perfect, <br/>
pure. He is the Rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. He is most just in <br/>
His judgments, hating all sin, and He will by no means clear the guilty. God <br/>
is loving, gracious, merciful, patient, abundant in goodness and truth. He <br/>
forgives sin, but there is only One way He will forgive sin, only One -- <br/>
through His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, Who sacrificed Himself on the cross <br/>
for His Church. Many men say their ways &quot;seem&quot; right, but in God&#39;s holy Word, <br/>
we find what God Himself requires for the forgiveness of our sins, and <br/>
eternal life with Him. <br/>
<br/>
God has all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in and of Himself. He is not <br/>
in need of any creatures which He has made. He has most sovereign dominion <br/>
over all creatures -- over them, to do by them, for them and upon them. He <br/>
does what He pleases, and nothing to Him is contingent or uncertain. He is <br/>
most holy in His counsels, His works and in all His commands. To Him, and Him <br/>
alone is due from angels and mankind, and any other creature, whatever <br/>
worship, service or obedience He is pleased to require of them. <br/>

If people are only saved by faith, how come they have to be carefully<br/>
obedient for their entire lives, starting as babies?<br/>
