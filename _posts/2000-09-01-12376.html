<div id="ygrps-yiv-5995699">I have a question for everyone. What about censorship in reading and TV <br/>
watching? I remember reading in books by the guy who started Sudbury Valley <br/>
school (based on unschooling) that he believes there should be NO censorship <br/>
of reading materials, that kids of any age should be free to read whatever <br/>
they want. And that if kids wanted to watch TV all day for how ever long, <br/>
they should be allowed to...<br/>
<br/>
Sounded okay to me...We live in the country and have terrible TV reception <br/>
and rarely turn on the TV and up until now, my ds have been happily reading <br/>
the classics and other books on the Oak Meadow reading list.<br/>
<br/>
Now that my one d is 13 and the other is almost 11, things are suddenly <br/>
changing. They have both discovered the condensed version of the Reader&#39;s <br/>
Digest and have been reading them avidly for some time. This has led to an <br/>
interest in adult mysteries for my 10 yo. Also, we just got a satelite dish <br/>
and suddenly we are receiving 45 channels with all kinds of stuff that I <br/>
can&#39;t even believe is on there. I want them to be free and I know they are <br/>
very curious about the world (especially the almost 11 yo)...but this <br/>
walking around the shadow is very uncomfortable for me and part of me just <br/>
wants to say NO to Tv altogether!!! At this point, we are only watching <br/>
shows that are rated for children and only about an hour or 2 in the evening <br/>
at most...But I am concerned about when the girls are left alone...I think <br/>
if I had no restrictions, my younger daughter might be glued to all kinds of <br/>
stuff all day long.<br/>
<br/>
Please respond!!! Mixed up between freedom and censorship!!!<br/>

I don&#39;t put many restrctions on what my kids watch. I&#39;m amazed at how often<br/>
they intuitivly know what they&#39;ll be ok with and not (ie: what might give<br/>
them bad dreams, etc) 90% of the time they only watch PBS or The Disney<br/>
Channel anyway. My suggestion, if you&#39;re worried, would be to see if there&#39;s<br/>
a way to put some kind of parental control on your system. We have it on our<br/>
cable so that anything rated TVY14, for example, can not be watched unless<br/>
you enter a code. It might be worth looking into.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Please respond!!! Mixed up between freedom and censorship!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I consider it my parental responsibility to censor what comes into my home, <br/>
as such many things are simply not allowed in the front door.  Period.  No <br/>
exceptions.  Want exceptions...grow up, provide for yourself and move into <br/>
your own place.<br/>
<br/>
The children are free to choose any reading materials we own or borrow.  If <br/>
it is here, they are welcome to read it.  In fact, we often take turns <br/>
reading the same book.<br/>
<br/>
As for TV, movies or music, I have veto power.  I am offended by many things <br/>
that are presented in the media and I pay the rent, cable and power bills, so <br/>
I get to choose.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that whatever is happening here sets the tone and we all react to <br/>
it so I&#39;m arbitrary about it, too; especially if I don&#39;t like it at a gut <br/>
level, it goes off.  I will make an attempt to explain my position if there <br/>
is genuine interest in knowing why.  If &#39;why&#39; is simply an attempt to argue, <br/>
I&#39;m not interested.  <br/>
<br/>
As to the AMOUNT of TV, videos, music, etc., I&#39;m pretty flexible.  Generally <br/>
speaking all are free to watch how much they would like.  However, we are <br/>
expected to share; we are not a household that has a TV per person.  <br/>
Sometimes that means parents watch kids&#39; shows, other times kids watch <br/>
parents&#39; shows.  It is very rare that I would have something on that I would <br/>
not feel comfortable having my children watch with me.  The most glaring <br/>
exception I can think of is a show that might be personally disturbing, say <br/>
about child abuse or kidnapping.  This could happen with a documentary or <br/>
something where I really feel the information is useful, but don&#39;t want to <br/>
traumatize a child, for instance.  In that case, if I think it may be too <br/>
graphic or disturbing to the child(ren), they don&#39;t get to watch.  (I am <br/>
willing to tape and watch it later, rather than have anyone feel neglected)<br/>
<br/>
Another exception is the sound level.  I hate fight scenes, clattery sounds <br/>
and other noisy show sounds.  It literally gives me jitters.  In that case, <br/>
if we can&#39;t find an acceptable sound level, the show can&#39;t be watched.  <br/>
(you&#39;d be amazed at what great hearing my kids suddenly develop when it&#39;s <br/>
something they really want to watch!  LOL)<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, nobody better even attempt to come over and tell me what we should or <br/>
should not be watching.  Nor would I ever feel it appropriate to control what <br/>
another family watches on the TV in their living room.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents worth,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496024735">I have always monitored my children&#39;s viewing and reading. I guess I regard<br/>
information as food for the mind. I don&#39;t see the wisdom of allowing my kids<br/>
to intellectually consume whatever crosses their path when I would never<br/>
allow them to physically consume food that was unhealthy or to have solids<br/>
before they were developed enough to process them. Having said that,<br/>
although I do control some subject matter, I don&#39;t control the reading<br/>
level. So my 11 yo daughter is now consuming college level books about<br/>
oceans and fish tanks, etc. And my daughter is just beginning to read some<br/>
books that were not allowed a few years before. When she has questions she<br/>
comes to me and we talk about them. When restrictions were lifted a bit, she<br/>
read several previously unallowed books. And then she went back to the<br/>
fishes!!<br/>
<br/>
As for TV, when they were younger, my kids&#39; television was more restricted.<br/>
They are now 9 and 11. Tuesdays and Thursdays are still &quot;no TV till after 6<br/>
PM&quot; days. They usually watch TLC, Nick, Cartoon Network and TV Land. No<br/>
interest in VH-1 or MTV. Yet. Thank God. Even on MWF, there are often days<br/>
when the TV doesn&#39;t go on. There are just more interesting things to do!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155270859">What my mom did with me, and what I intend/have begun to do with my kids is<br/>
this: when I was younger, primary school age, my television viewing was<br/>
restricted to educational and rated G programs (pretty much all pbs since<br/>
there was no cable back then-oh, and Bill Kennedy at the movies, and the<br/>
Saturday creature feature.) *and* my mom and dad sat down and watched it<br/>
with us.  Remember, pbs isn&#39;t all rated g material-lots of animals dying,<br/>
and masterpiece theatre dealt with adult subject matter-the key was<br/>
presentation.  Minimal ad time, and no foul language.<br/>
Without all the bang up violence and language, most adult content programs<br/>
on pbs are pretty boring to primary aged kids. But on a subconscious level,<br/>
I realized that good programming doesn&#39;t have to involve unrealistic action<br/>
sequences, overrated sexual innuendoes, or lots of foul language. Eventually<br/>
I began to listen, and as I learned to listen, I began to understand what<br/>
was going on in those &quot;boring&quot; adult dialogues on pbs.<br/>
<br/>
At the point I began to understand what was going on behind the dialogue,<br/>
around the age 12, my mom-smart lady that she is-made note of it and told me<br/>
something I&#39;ll never forget.  She said that I was becoming an adult, and in<br/>
doing so I needed to be very careful what I put in my head by watching<br/>
television or reading books.  She said that once that information is in<br/>
there, it can never come out-it&#39;s stuck for good.  She told me there have<br/>
been books and t.v. programs that she&#39;s read or seen that she wished she<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have, since the images in them ended up disturbing her.  In<br/>
essence, after my primary years of restricted t.v.-not amount of time, but<br/>
content only-when I began to exhibit an understanding of what I was watching<br/>
and reading, she gave me book and television autonomy.<br/>
<br/>
In my teens I made a few mistakes, and watched or read things that upset me.<br/>
I realized *my mother was right!*, and made more careful choices, but they<br/>
were independent choices-not coerced by parental authority. But I<br/>
understood, the way my mother intended, that the mind is not a sieve, but a<br/>
sponge.<br/>
<br/>
I only hope that I am able to be as sensitive and wise a mother as my mom<br/>
(of seven rambunctious loudmouthed kids!) was and is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781565904">As of today, we&#39;re also starting a NO-TV experiment that we plan on running <br/>
through the rest of the year.  I became concerned when my 8 year old son <br/>
stopped playing on the computer in favor of Cartoon Network.  He just loves <br/>
cartoons.  Although I didn&#39;t see anything really bad (I know that&#39;s a value <br/>
judgment) in the cartoons he watched, I wasn&#39;t all that comfortable either.  <br/>
And, TV just seemed to have taken over.  The kids wanted to watch just one <br/>
more show before we&#39;d go over to a friend&#39;s house or on a field trip.  They&#39;d <br/>
want to cut outings short in order to get home for one of their numerous <br/>
favorite shows.  They&#39;d get upset if anything were turned off in the middle.  <br/>
Their behavior in general left a lot to be desired.  But mostly, I was <br/>
concerned that they were becoming couch potatoes.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not turning the TV off entirely.  It is available for videos and <br/>
Nintendo.  But we&#39;ve also been working on a list for the last week of things <br/>
we can do instead of watching TV.  And in fact, since we started talking <br/>
about our experiment a week ago, the TV has actually not been on that much at <br/>
all.  <br/>
<br/>
The only thing I&#39;m concerned about is how my almost 4 year old is going to <br/>
occupy herself and whether I&#39;ll have the energy to supervise her all day <br/>
long.  (Yes, I admit, I did at times use the TV as a babysitter.)  <br/>

That was so well put.  My parents were the same way with me.  When we make <br/>
something &quot;off limits&quot; without an appropriat explaination we tend to make <br/>
that something very desirable.  I see this with books, tv, movies and candy. <br/>
  It is so much better for our children to make and informed choice.  Yes, <br/>
we all make mistakes at times, but as you said, you learned from them.<br/>

When I think we are living our lives around tv shows, the VCR gets used.  DS <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to go someplace because a show is coming on...we record it.  9 <br/>
times out of 10 we never get around to watching whatever it was that was so <br/>
important we wanted to miss out on life.  If it is important enough to watch, <br/>
it takes LOTS less time because we fast forward through all the commercials!  <br/>
I really like that part.  There are lots of times I don&#39;t mind the show that <br/>
is currently on but hate the commercial for an upcoming show or the latest <br/>
toy.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the VCR plan works as well for parents as it does for children.<br/>

in to watch anything.  He watches PBS and Disney and most of those <br/>
things I tape.  He wanted to see Franklin the other day and it&#39;s on <br/>
Nick.  I don&#39;t let him watch Nick because it has commercials on it <br/>
and I&#39;m not comfortable with him being exposed to all those yet.  So <br/>
I taped Franklin and he didn&#39;t have to suffer the commercials. <br/>
<br/>
Steve and I also tape everything we watch.  I can&#39;t remember the last <br/>
time I saw a commercial.  It seems like such a waste of time to spend <br/>
1 hour when I could spend 40 mins instead.  Plus I can watch <br/>
something in bits and pieces.  I mainly watch BBC America anyway and <br/>
watch one soap on there and also some of the English documentaries <br/>
and dramas (if and when I have time)... television is playing a <br/>
smaller and smaller role in our lives.<br/>

related the two very easily and in a way ds could understand, without giving<br/>
him too much info-or too little.<br/>

So I did my first sex talk! Whoopee! (and I mean that in the context of<br/>
hurray, not as in &quot;makin&#39;&quot;  ;-) *And* with the gentle courtship dance of<br/>
emperor scorpions going on in the background. I nearly cracked my composure<br/>
when the narrator said &quot;If the male scorpion displeases her, she&#39;ll kill<br/>
him&quot; !!! LOL!  Lucky for human men, women don&#39;t have this option!<br/>

That was so well put.  My parents were the same way with me.  When we make<br/>
something &quot;off limits&quot; without an appropriat explaination we tend to make<br/>
that something very desirable.  I see this with books, tv, movies and candy.<br/>
  It is so much better for our children to make and informed choice.  Yes,<br/>
we all make mistakes at times, but as you said, you learned from them.<br/>

 Anyway, this leads me to something that happened lastnight.  While watching<br/>
 National Geographic Explorer with my 7 year old son, a clip about how<br/>
 scorpions reproduce led to a conversation between ds and me about sexual<br/>
 reproduction in humans.  Wow! Was I not ready for that!-but having that<br/>
 program on discussing the exact same thing was a great help.  I was able to<br/>
 rel &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me of last night (No -- not that -- get your minds out of the <br/>
gutter!).<br/>
<br/>
There we are, hubby and I watching a grownup movie.  Kids are in their rooms. <br/>
 Of course, just when the violent part of the movie starts, in waltzes the 5 <br/>
yo.<br/>
<br/>
So I, being the fantastic mom that I am, switch the station off of the movie <br/>
to the cooking channel.<br/>
<br/>
Where they are hurling chunks of raw meat to the tiger in the zoo!!!!   And <br/>
going on and on about how they feed X pounds of horse and other meat to the <br/>
tiger every day, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Auugghhhhh!<br/>
<br/>
At least it was real violence and not people shooting at each other in a <br/>
movie, but it was more nature channel that I was ready for at that moment!  :)<br/>

LOL! Mmm Mmm! Raw meat! Hungry kitty! Lol! :-)<br/>
<br/>
We keep our t.v. in our bedroom and usually, if there&#39;s a show that is too<br/>
adult for our kids on, I tell then point blank-&quot;Seamus, this show is too<br/>
grown up for you to watch.  Please leave the room, I&#39;ll be there in a<br/>
minute.&quot; I say that if there&#39;s a particularly good part on, or if it&#39;s<br/>
boring I&#39;ll say &quot;Let&#39;s leave the room so we can talk&quot;.  I prefer to do it<br/>
this way because it helps me reinforce that there&#39;s programs on t.v. that ds<br/>
is not ready for, and sometimes it can lead to discussion about what is<br/>
appropriate t.v. and what is not.  Ds will say &quot;Why can&#39;t I watch it?&quot; and<br/>
I&#39;ll answer saying &quot;Well, they use bad language&quot; or &quot;There&#39;s too much<br/>
pretend violence&quot; or something to that effect. And normally I end it with<br/>
&quot;When you get older you can decide for yourself if you want to watch it.&quot;<br/>
He may not understand completely, but he likes to have a reason and feel in<br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
Although, if there&#39;s nekkid folks on the screen (not very often, but<br/>
still..) CLICK! Off goes the t.v.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, when they walk into that room and there&#39;s something adult on,<br/>
boy-there&#39;s a moment of squirming nervousness.  I&#39;m like-eek! Shut your<br/>
eyes! Which is funny, because I remember my mom letting me come into the<br/>
room where a movie was on to get a goodnight kiss so long as I shut my eyes.<br/>
:-) I walked blindly into the room and usually tripped over the hassock.<br/>
Hmmm.  I can remember my parents laughing.  I wonder why. ;-)<br/>

to have every Cartoon Network afternoon show taped all the time.  True, that <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean he actually ever got around to watching it, but it was just so <br/>
important that he have that lifeline to Cartoon Network.  It got kinda scary <br/>
for me, so we&#39;ve turned off the TV.  It is now Day 4, and the first day Dad <br/>
isn&#39;t home to help distract the kids.  But, so far so good.  Zack&#39;s playing <br/>
with his new Pokemon game and I just helped Haley paint her papier mache <br/>
piggy bank she&#39;s making from a kit a friend gave her.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-843132758">I am not the least bit uncomfortable with sex, I just feel it has no part in<br/>
a child&#39;s life.  I have met people who think nothing of having sex in their<br/>
living room in front of their children,,,guess that would not be a whole lot<br/>
different than watching on t.v. but my personal opinion is these people have<br/>
no idea the kind of harm they are creating in their chil;dren&#39;s lives.  By<br/>
the time there children are grown and they see the damage it will be set.<br/>
<br/>
However, I realize I have seen far more of life than most people.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are not the least bit uncomfortable with violence either, I know<br/>
because I have been a victim of kidnap, rape, being held hostage and being<br/>
shot at (more than once). I have lived long enough to see the result of<br/>
several generations grow up and live according to what they were subjected<br/>
to.  The more you observe something, the more acceptable it becomes in your<br/>
mind.<br/>
<br/>
I do not believe in letting them do whatever they want.  I don&#39;t think a<br/>
child should raise themself .  I believe they need some guidance and<br/>
assistance in this cruel world.  Certain things can not be properly<br/>
comprehended or understood by a child and until they can understand it they<br/>
should not be subjected to it.  There are a lot of sickos in this world and<br/>
some of them write the scripts we watch.  I am just narrow minded enough not<br/>
to want these children subjected to the things in life that nearly destroyed<br/>
my life as a child.<br/>
<br/>
I can not make others care about these things or understand them possibly,<br/>
but I can still have my feelings and opinions on the matter and I will still<br/>
try to raise well balanced children, with morals and compassion and<br/>
consideration for their fellow man ( or woman)<br/>
<br/>
I am not talking about every little thing.  I am talking about violence and<br/>
the physical act of sex.  I do not and will not allow x -rated shows in my<br/>
house.   I believe rated R shows should not be seen by small  children.<br/>
<br/>
I do not expect everyone to agree with me.  If everybody raised their<br/>
children the same either they would all be hard core criminals, or none of<br/>
them would.<br/>
