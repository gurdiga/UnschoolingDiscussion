I think once something is out in public like this you have the right to quote <br/>
it, don&#39;t you?  It&#39;s pretty much a matter of public record.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of considerations of theft of intellectual property (which you <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be doing unless you stole everything Joyce wrote and said you wrote <br/>
it), what rights could people have over what they put on a yahoogroup with <br/>
over a thousand members?<br/>
<br/>
You can use whatever I wrote.  You can use my name if it ever matters.<br/>

Perhaps not.  But the poster did indicate that she would take our feelings into consideration.  Since she is willing to do that, I&quot;d like to see what she&#39;s using that is mine and how she is using it.<br/>

It might be a &quot;he&quot; and the offer was that if you don&#39;t want to be quoted at <br/>
all, say so.  It&#39;s one thing to offer to limit the pool of quotes.   It&#39;s WAY <br/>
different to assume that means the writer would correspond with everyone <br/>

Hello Unschoolers, <br/>
<br/>
My name is Bobby Ramsay and I&#39;m an MA candidate at <br/>
Georgetown University in the Communication, Culture, and <br/>
Technology Program.  I&#39;m currently writing my thesis on the <br/>
mediation of messages within communities.  I&#39;m arguing that <br/>
messages mediated by interests of capital and the State cease to <br/>
serve the community.  My case study is public school and <br/>
unschooling.  I want to show how the communities formed on the <br/>
Web use technology to create a space for the fortification of <br/>
community values where capital and the State are less intrusive.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a member of this list serve for over a month and have <br/>
been keeping up with the themes and discussions.  I plan on <br/>
using examples from many of the messages in my thesis.  In <br/>
none of these instances will I use a person&#39;s real name or email <br/>
address.  The discussion on this list serve will not be disrupted in <br/>
any way. <br/>
<br/>
If any member has a problem with my using examples from his or <br/>
her messages, please reply to me directly at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rmr22@...">rmr22@...</a> and I will be  continue researching what I believe is <br/>
an effective and beneficial form of alternative schooling.<br/>

representing were made to look bad because the interviewer already <br/>
knew in which direction he was going  and knew he wanted things to <br/>
look a certain way.  I&#39;ve known people who have had quotes <br/>
attributed to them that they didn&#39;t even say.  <br/>
<br/>
I just think it would be a shame for us to find out that someone <br/>
wrote a thesis that made it seem like this list was supporting <br/>
something that it&#39;s really not supporting.  It would sometimes be <br/>
easy to twist our words and make it seem like we&#39;re guilty <br/>
of &quot;educational neglect&quot;.  I&#39;ve seen influential people within the <br/>
homeschooling community twist the truth of what unschoolers do to <br/>
make it seem like we&#39;re not doing a good job of education.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know this man.  He might do a very fair thesis and some of <br/>
us might even think it&#39;s cool to have our quotes in there.  On the <br/>
other hand, we might read the thesis some day and <br/>
say, &quot;But..but...sputter,sputter...that&#39;s not what I meant and he <br/>
knew it!&quot;  <br/>

  &lt;&lt;  But the poster did indicate that she would take our feelings into <br/>
  consideration.  Since she is willing to do that, I&quot;d like to see what she&#39;s <br/>
  using that is mine and how she is using it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  It might be a &quot;he&quot; and the offer was that if you don&#39;t want to be quoted at <br/>
  all, say so.  It&#39;s one thing to offer to limit the pool of quotes.   It&#39;s WAY <br/>
  different to assume that means the writer would correspond with everyone <br/>
  quoted OR share the finished work for the approval and commentary of anyone <br/>
  quoted.<br/>
<br/>
  I think the offer was &quot;pass or play,&quot; not final approval.<br/>

  Hello Unschoolers, <br/>
<br/>
  My name is Bobby Ramsay and I&#39;m an MA candidate at <br/>
  Georgetown University in the Communication, Culture, and <br/>
  Technology Program.  I&#39;m currently writing my thesis on the <br/>
  mediation of messages within communities.  I&#39;m arguing that <br/>
  messages mediated by interests of capital and the State cease to <br/>
  serve the community.  My case study is public school and <br/>
  unschooling.  I want to show how the communities formed on the <br/>
  Web use technology to create a space for the fortification of <br/>
  community values where capital and the State are less intrusive.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve been a member of this list serve for over a month and have <br/>
  been keeping up with the themes and discussions.  I plan on <br/>
  using examples from many of the messages in my thesis.  In <br/>
  none of these instances will I use a person&#39;s real name or email <br/>
  address.  The discussion on this list serve will not be disrupted in <br/>
  any way. <br/>
<br/>
  If any member has a problem with my using examples from his or <br/>
  her messages, please reply to me directly at <br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rmr22@...">rmr22@...</a> and I will be  continue researching what I believe is <br/>
  an effective and beneficial form of alternative schooling.<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you,<br/>
  Bobby Ramsay<br/>
