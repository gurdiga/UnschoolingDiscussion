<h4>Have A Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759438985">My son has been hanging out with the &quot;wrong&quot; kids..the kind that beat him up and make fun of him.  I&#39;ve tried to get him interested in other friends, but there just arent that many available and he doesn&#39;t want to be involved in &quot;stuff&quot; right now.<br/>
<br/>
The other night, one of them lit one of those rubber lizards on fire and as it was melting, dripped the hot rubber on my son&#39;s neck, giving him second degree burns.<br/>
<br/>
Then this same kid has the nerve to show up here today.  I told him he&#39;d better never do it again or I&#39;d come after him and do it to him.  Then I told him to leave and not come back.  <br/>
<br/>
It just so happened his grandfather showed up about that time.  I went out and told HIM what happened too and the kid even admitted it.  His grandfather starts telling me how he has had to yell at my son and his *other* grandson for lighting up paint cans.<br/>
<br/>
Ooookkkaaaayyyy.  So what does that have to do with it?  Not that its right, but it wasn&#39;t happening HERE, it was happening at HIS house (and nobody was getting HURT). AHEM.  And if that was going on, it was WEEKS ago because Andrew hasn&#39;t been down at all in a few weeks.  <br/>
<br/>
Sure did shed a whole new light on this particular &quot;parent&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So I told him again, in front of his grandfather not to bother to come down anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I REALLY like the idea of just dealing with the kids and not necessarily the parents (though, I&#39;ll do that too if I need to).  If I was a pushover before, I&#39;m done being one now.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I did that recently, went straight to the kid. He wasn&#39;t really being a bully <br/>
though, just being a little.. uhmm.&quot;too aggressive&quot; in sparring in karate.  <br/>
He kicked JP in the groin one time.. Then the next time he sparred with him, <br/>
the kid kicked his arm and left a whopper of a bruise.  They are supposed to <br/>
have a &quot;no contact&quot; rule when they are sparring, and I know they are bound to <br/>
occasionally get carried away.  After all karate IS a contact sport.   But, those <br/>
two incidents left JP not wanting to spar with this particular kid.  They are <br/>
about the same size, two of the smallest kids in the class ( actually, there <br/>
is only one kid smaller than them)  And, I think that the kid is not afraid of <br/>
really going to town on JP because JP is not bigger than him.   At first I <br/>
told JP that I would mention it to Mr Wilson, but I really didnt want to make a <br/>
big deal out of it.  I know the kid&#39;s mom and she is very nice and I thought <br/>
about mentioning it to her.. But, instead, right before class when the kids <br/>
were just playing around, I just casually said to Zack,&quot;hey, buddy, take it easy <br/>
on JP today, you bout beat him up the last time you guys fought&quot;  ( kinda <br/>
grinning and good natured tone)  The kid grinned sheepishly at me and said &quot;&#39;OK!&quot;  <br/>
  And that was that.     I have stayed for the whole class the last several <br/>
times, and there has been no more &quot;overt&quot; sparring.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, there were some very rude kids at the pool at the Y the other day. They <br/>
were &quot;drop off&quot; kids.. no parents there.  And they kept splashing A LOT. So <br/>
much that you just about got drowned every few seconds.  A few times I said.. <br/>
&quot;hey, watch out guys, you&#39;redrowning us!&quot;  Then we would move out of their way.. <br/>
But, they kept on not paying attention and ending up splashing us over and <br/>
over.   I kept reminding them that they were splashing us, but they really didnt <br/>
seem to care.  Finally, I told the lifegaurd. &quot;Can you ask them to stop <br/>
splashing so much, we can&#39;t get away from them&quot;  He called them down and they let <br/>
up for about 5 mins, then they were back to horseplay.   We were fed up by <br/>
then, so we just left that pool and went to the outdoor  pool.    In that <br/>
situation, there was really nothing else to do.. Luckily we did have an option, but it <br/>
was not our first choice.  The kids really wanted to stay indoors where the <br/>
water was much warmer.   But they didnt want to get a face full of water every <br/>
few seconds.<br/>

Who has never dropped her kids off at the pool.   HEY, I like the pool myself <br/>
too much to miss out!<br/>
