<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932369882">Dear Friends of Education:<br/>
<br/>
Last week, the Associated Press reported that, &quot;At a time when the <br/>
state is <br/>
holding students, teachers and schools to higher standards, [NYS <br/>
Board <br/>
of <br/>
Regents] Chancellor Robert Bennett is raising the notion that school <br/>
boards <br/>
should be held equally accountable.&quot;  A former Buffalo school board <br/>
president <br/>
is quoted as saying, &quot;If you&#39;re holding everyone else accountable, <br/>
beginning <br/>
with the students, you can&#39;t have the elected officials not have <br/>
some <br/>
kind of <br/>
standards.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Putting Children First&quot; believes that this is an excellent <br/>
opportunity <br/>
to <br/>
hammer this point home:  if our elected officials will not sit for <br/>
state <br/>
tests, then neither should our children be forced to do so!  <br/>
<br/>
We intend to submit the short (175-word) letter to the editor pasted <br/>
below to <br/>
as many newspapers statewide as we can--and to attach the names of <br/>
as <br/>
many <br/>
signatories as we possibly can--hopefully, as many as 1,000.  <br/>
<br/>
WE NEED YOUR HELP!!  Here&#39;s what to do:  <br/>
<br/>
1) READ THE LETTER (below). <br/>
<br/>
2) If you agree with the letter and would like to join in signing <br/>
it, <br/>
please <br/>
respond to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:PtnChildrenFirst@...">PtnChildrenFirst@...</a> by 11pm, Sunday, March 2.  The <br/>
letter <br/>
will go out to newspapers on Monday morning, March 3.<br/>
<br/>
3) Fill out this information and include it with your response.  <br/>
Complete <br/>
responses will be required in order for many papers to permit use of <br/>
your <br/>
name:<br/>
&quot;Please add my name and address to the list of those who will sign <br/>
the <br/>
editorial letter from Putting Children First! with regard to <br/>
Chancellor <br/>
Robert Bennett&#39;s recommendation of state standards for school <br/>
boards.&quot;<br/>
YOUR FULL NAME:<br/>
YOUR HOME TELEPHONE NUMBER:<br/>
YOUR FULL STREET ADDRESS & ZIP CODE:<br/>
<br/>
4) Please let us know the name, street address and e-mail address of <br/>
your <br/>
local paper, if you are willing to allow us to submit this letter <br/>
electronically with your name and address (as well as other <br/>
signatories).<br/>
<br/>
5) If you are willing, please also note (for the papers) whether you <br/>
are:<br/>
--a student?   at what school?<br/>
--a parent?<br/>
--a teacher?  at what school?<br/>
--a professor?  at what school?  what is your field?<br/>
--a businessperson?  What is your title and the name of your company?<br/>
<br/>
6) Please FORWARD this post to other people or listserves which you <br/>
think <br/>
might be interested in participating in this effort!  <br/>

THE LETTER---<br/>
<br/>
Dear Editor:<br/>
<br/>
NY Regents Chancellor Robert Bennett has proposed that school boards <br/>
should <br/>
have &quot;higher standards.&quot;*<br/>
<br/>
Commissioner Mills argued in court last year that passing five <br/>
Regents <br/>
examinations should be considered  minimal evidence of a student&#39;s <br/>
ability to <br/>
participate effectively as a citizen.  Following this argument,  <br/>
neither he <br/>
nor any Regent, legislator, or school board member should hold <br/>
public <br/>
office <br/>
without first passing five Regents examinations.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, policymakers come to office after demonstrating their <br/>
abilities in <br/>
varied real-life situations.  A paper-and-pencil test will not <br/>
capture <br/>
their <br/>
capabilities in working creatively, cooperatively, or over time.<br/>
<br/>
Just so:  if standardized tests are not a good way to assess the <br/>
abilities of <br/>
our leaders, then neither are they a good way to assess students.  <br/>
<br/>
Standardized tests steal funds from classrooms while school <br/>
districts <br/>
statewide face fiscal crises. A minimal requirement for school board <br/>
&quot;standards&quot; should be to call on Mills and the Regents for an <br/>
immediate <br/>
end <br/>
to their simple-minded over-emphasis on standardized testing as a <br/>
measure of <br/>
quality teaching, learning, or thinking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285156051">THIS IS FROM PCF_ INFO I THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE WITH NY&#39;ERS<br/>
<br/>
Dear Friend of Education,<br/>
<br/>
If you have had half an eye on the news this week, you already know <br/>
that <br/>
massive numbers of NYS school children will be denied diplomas this <br/>
month because <br/>
of abusive state tests, particularly the Math A and Physics Regents <br/>
Exams.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that Commissioner Mills has painted himself into a <br/>
corner by <br/>
relying on a weak tool to measure the growth of the human intellect, <br/>
and that <br/>
those who oppose the state tests now have a golden opportunity to <br/>
speak <br/>
as <br/>
one against their devastating impact.<br/>
<br/>
A &quot;Rally for Our Kids&quot; is being planned in the Rochester area--see <br/>
information below--but I heartily encourage those of you elsewhere <br/>
in <br/>
the state to find <br/>
a way to make some noise.  Write your legislators, hold a mini-<br/>
protest <br/>
on a <br/>
streetcorner, write to the newspaper, write your Regent, call your <br/>
local high <br/>
school and find out the facts about the impact of this year&#39;s <br/>
tests.  <br/>
THE DAMAGE <br/>
MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE.  We need ALL of our kids!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;RALLY FOR OUR KIDS&quot;<br/>
<br/>
7 am planning meeting, Monday, June 23<br/>
Fairport High School, 1358 Ayrault Road, Fairport, NY  <br/>
<br/>
3:30 pm RALLY, Tuesday, June 24<br/>
East High School, 1801 East Main Street, Rochester, NY<br/>
<br/>
Please bring your friends, your children, and posters to share our <br/>
rage!!<br/>
