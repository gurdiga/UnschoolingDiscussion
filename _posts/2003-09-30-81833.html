<div id="ygrps-yiv-107709127">-=-We have to be careful though. We can reach too far. Since God has burdened <br/>
your heart concerning home schooling, satan is going to challenge you at <br/>
every stone. If possible, satan will have you reach out until you fall into the <br/>
river. It is a constant struggle to keep the goal in mind that we are home <br/>
schooling our children and there are times to say &quot;No&quot;. Do not be offended if the <br/>
word &quot;No&quot; is used and do not be afraid to use the word &quot;No&quot; along with the <br/>
&quot;Word&quot; to stay focused. -=-<br/>

Same page, different author:<br/>

-=-I donâ€™t think some have a clear understanding of the term unschool. <br/>
Unschool to me is when you have no structure and no real discipline to learn <br/>
anything other than that which interests the child. Following the interests of the <br/>
child is okay but they all need to learn how to read and write and do math <br/>
whether it interests them or not. Now being relaxed and flexible is a whole <br/>
different topic. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I found on the first page of a google search with <br/>
<br/>
unschool sin Christian<br/>
<br/>
There would&#39;ve been more if I had gone to page two or used other search words.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is something lots of people don&#39;t know about Google: it searches for<br/>
exact matches, so unschool won&#39;t find unschooling or unschooler. But you can<br/>
tack on extra words to the search by capitalizing OR. (If you type it in<br/>
lower case Google will think you want &quot;or&quot; as a search word.) So:<br/>
<br/>
unschool OR unschooling OR unschooler OR unschoolers sin christian<br/>
