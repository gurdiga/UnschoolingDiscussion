<br/>
Some people follow the Holt/GWS definition, since the man did coin the <br/>
term that is being discussed. Some people want to want it to fit only <br/>
under their conditions.<br/>
<br/>
So how would one go about saying &#39;you should go join another group&#39; or <br/>
&#39;okay, you can stay&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t something that is up for anyone to decide.<br/>
<br/>
So far, in this discussion on &#39;unschooling&#39;. We seem to come up with a <br/>
basic starting point. Which is that the learning takes place by the <br/>
child&#39;s agenda, nobody elses.<br/>
<br/>
After that.. it becomes grey.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, its a shame Holt didn&#39;t leave a magic Harry Potterish hat that we <br/>
can put on our heads and be told what &#39;house&#39; we belong to... <br/>

Holt didn&#39;t even have kids.  He was writing about how learning works, and the <br/>
necessity of freedom.<br/>
<br/>
People with children since then have discovered how to make his theories <br/>
work, in practice, in families.  <br/>
<br/>
There are people here whose kids have never even been to school, who are now <br/>
teens, or grown.  Why are you resisting people sharing their experiences?  <br/>
Why are you defending those who are basically saying that pure unschooling <br/>
doesn&#39;t exist, or doesn&#39;t work?  It does at my house.  I&#39;ve seen many, many <br/>
other families who are making it work GLORIOUSLY well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Never said anything about not sharing experiences. Reread all that I&#39;ve <br/>
written, on any list, and experience is what I encourage.<br/>
<br/>
The defense is in the obscurities of anything beyond a child-led agenda <br/>
for learning.<br/>
<br/>
Has somebody here said they coerce their child&#39;s learning and called <br/>
themselves an unschooler? I must of missed that.<br/>
<br/>
I think it great if unschooliing, pure, radical or *insert words of <br/>
choice here* works for you. There is nothing better for a child than at <br/>
atmosphere with that dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
I, myself, grew up unschooling and my son unschools. Since unschooling <br/>
wasn&#39;t a term 45ish years ago.. our very forward thinking family did our <br/>
best to adapt to the laws at the time, especially in a suburban area.  <br/>
<br/>
Our family now includes things that _I_ personally like to add to the <br/>
paradigm such as vaccinating a baby who doesn&#39;t ask for it, especially <br/>
with all the inforamtion out there that proves what a farce they are <br/>
(which means it doesn&#39;t fall under the safety unbrella)... breastfeeding <br/>
on demand...  family bed and a host of other things in the spirit in <br/>
which _I_ see our lives.<br/>
<br/>
But nobody owns the word and the defintion isn&#39;t written in stone. If it <br/>
does get written in stone, and I don&#39;t agree with it, I&#39;ll gladly move on <br/>
to another one.<br/>
<br/>
But as Helen Hegener so eloquently wrote about the beauty of the word is <br/>
that it isn&#39;t so clearly defined, I can&#39;t imagine it being under the <br/>
scrutiny of just a select few, can you?<br/>
<br/>
I beleive when this list became moderated, the explaination of how the <br/>
discussion will go started with the words &#39;Because unschooling means <br/>
different things to different people...&#39;<br/>
<br/>
If that has changed.. if Helen has renounced her moderators and decided <br/>
to let it fall into a defining group, let somebody please make that <br/>
announcement.<br/>
<br/>
