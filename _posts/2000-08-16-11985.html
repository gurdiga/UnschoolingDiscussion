  <div><br></div><tt>Kandace,<br><br>&nbsp; And....And.... And.... .oh to say 
  this gently.... I am thrilled to know<br>she is not ready to *school* with 
  you. I&#39;m absolutely in love with her. She<br>knows in her heart who she is and 
  that&#39;s she&#39;s glorious just as she is.<br>She&#39;s not bending to the expectation 
  that she should be her brother.&nbsp; Give<br>her some kisses for me, will 
  ya.<br><br>This baby is 4.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; How can a 4 year old be 
  behind???&nbsp; Just because one<br>child read at 4 does not mean anything 
  close to the assumption all children<br>are ready to read at 4.&nbsp; .&nbsp; 
  Your son was very, very, very early ----<br><br>You could send her to 
  school.....and they would get her ready for<br>schooling...and then you could 
  school her some more..... but how very awful<br>that would be. She&#39;d have to 
  pretzel herself into a chair and learn to do<br>what others want, instead of 
  unfolding and growing into herself.<br><br>Your paragraph down there about 
  hospitals doing things and then recusing you<br>from the things they do... 
  well that&#39;s what schools would do to your<br>daughter.&nbsp; But even they 
  would not label her behind at 4.<br><br>This child is teaching you your very 
  first and most important lesson about<br>homeschooling.&nbsp; Learning at home 
  is about being able to grow and learn at<br>your own pace. It&#39;s about the 
  joyous exploration of the world. If you push<br>to out school the school, 
  you&#39;ll take away all the sweetness of being home.<br><br>LisaKK<br><br>&gt;Hi 
  all!&nbsp; Thanks for such a warm welcome.&nbsp; :)<br>&gt;I also have one son 
  who is gifted and I found out by accident when he was<br>&gt;four that he knew 
  how to read already.&nbsp; I also think it was his love 
  for<br>the<br>&gt;children&#39;s shows because I sure didn&#39;t teach him to 
  read!<br>&gt;It is my 4 year old that is lagging so far behind I just don&#39;t 
  know what to<br>&gt;do with her but keep waiting for her to be ready to school 
  with me.&nbsp; I<br>&gt;thought I was gonna show everyone how much better 
  schooling at home is with<br>&gt;her because she will be my first one who is 
  entirely schooled at home.&nbsp; But<br>&gt;she is NEVER gonna be ready to 
  start.&nbsp; Ugh!&nbsp; Now my husband is asking if<br>&gt;maybe we should let 
  her go to school for a year to get her started.&nbsp; Maybe<br>&gt;it would 
  help, he says.&nbsp; :(<br>&gt;After having my first 3 babies in the hospital 
  and studying midwifery long<br>&gt;enough to know what exactly the medical 
  folk do to screw up a perfectly<br>good<br>&gt;labor and make you grateful 
  they &quot;saved&quot; your baby, I feel it would take a<br>&gt;lot of courage for me to 
  birth at the hospital!&nbsp; LOL!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I&#39;m looking forward to 
  getting to know all of you!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Blessings to 
  you,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Kandice<br>&gt;If I could show you how to make $300-$800+ 
  mo. part-time at home with no<br>selling, inventory,or huge<br>&gt;start-up 
  cost, would you like to hear about it?&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT Amway!&nbsp;

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475117360">FWIW, our 4 year old only recognizes a handful of letters on any consistent <br/>
basis.  Forget about reading (at the moment).  He is such a sweet boy and he <br/>
resists anyone &quot;testing&quot; him.  Our 6 year old has been reading for a year, <br/>
knew his letters before 4 and loves the question / answer give and take.  <br/>
When my wife and I look at how different these two are we are renewed in our <br/>
commitment to homeschooling.  How can a school that needs to mass educate and <br/>
for the most part deliver a one-size-fits-all program possibly accommodate <br/>
and adapt to the differences exhibited by these two whole and complete little <br/>
children?  Only we can do that at home.  The one year old twins broaden our <br/>
horizons even farther.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503613685">Oooh, I know what you mean!  I started going through the school materials<br/>
today, trying to figure out what we were going to do this year!  I just<br/>
can&#39;t seem to relax!  I started watching the math videos that I got from PBS<br/>
and I heard the traditional moans from my 10 yo!  But after awhile she came<br/>
and sat by me and watched the videos and even said that some of the lessons<br/>
looked fun!  I told her we would do the fun ones only if she wanted to and<br/>
she seemed much more receptive!  Maybe math will even be fun this year!<br/>
