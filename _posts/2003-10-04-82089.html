<div id="ygrps-yiv-686564194">After a bunch of time messing around googleing, I thought I would ask you<br/>
guys.<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in Atlanta GA.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling?  (found a few sites) it seems you have to test your kids, but<br/>
keep the results? I am in CA now and I am a bit spoiled I think..<br/>
<br/>
Housing?  is there a country (more inexpensive, with more land) type place<br/>
close to Atlanta?  (Mirrieta (sp).  Is Atlanta the city a neat place to<br/>
live?  (we can go city or country really)<br/>
<br/>
You could reply off list if you want :-) or not :-)<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133054693">Bronwen,  We live in the country an hour outside of Atlanta and have just <br/>
started to meet unschoolers.  Actually, in a few hours, we are hosting a <br/>
GAUnschoolers get together at our farm!  I think about 6-7 families are <br/>
coming but am not sure.  I will let you know how it goes and give you more <br/>
Atlanta info. and an invitation to the GAunschoolers list if you are <br/>
interested, when I have more time.  COme on down (and over) ...  We&#39;d love <br/>
to meet you!<br/>
