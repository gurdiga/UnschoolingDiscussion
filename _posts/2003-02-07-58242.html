<div id="ygrps-yiv-687604638">Hi again!<br/>
I changed this subject line, because I think this might deserve more<br/>
discussion.<br/>
<br/>
A example of how this evolves . . .<br/>
<br/>
My son, Bay, at age 12 is not even remotely interested in anything<br/>
resembling school. He is unlike his siblings in that they both (at now 16dd<br/>
Nell & 19ds Sky) get involved in things I find interesting . . . languages,<br/>
drama, reading, writing, etc. Bay wants and needs to be moving and working<br/>
outside and when he is not, he is likely to be wanting computer or TV. Now<br/>
I view this as a healthy balance, but it took me a while to get there<br/>
(another story on a parent deschooling in a different way!) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Bay, quite on his own, discovered the wild, noisy, exciting world<br/>
of dirtbiking. And, over the course of time, decided that he wanted to do<br/>
this more than anything. He started to express interest in owning his own<br/>
bike. Now, dirtbikes are expensive and I could not plop down $2000+ for one<br/>
for him, nor did I want another line of credit. Did Bay let this stand in<br/>
his way? Nope. He started saving his money - from his mowing jobs here on<br/>
our farm and our neighbors place. When that was not enough, he got his dad<br/>
to hire him to work on the house his dad was building for himself. Lo and<br/>
behold, it took Bay over a year to save up and buy his very own shiny,<br/>
spiffy new red 100cc dirtbike. Now, along the way in this process I had<br/>
choices . . . I could rain on his parade and say that it was too expensive,<br/>
too dangerous, I wasn&#39;t taking him to the track, too noisy to ride here,<br/>
blahblahblah. But, I did not. I saw the light in his eyes. I saw him devour<br/>
dirtbike magazines when we would go to Borders. I saw his enthusiasm. It<br/>
was a very beautiful thing. People ask me how I could support this - it&#39;s<br/>
dangerous, it&#39;s so noisy and dirty there, how can I stand to go - etc. I<br/>
can only answer that in a million years it isn&#39;t where I thought I would be<br/>
at 53 years old . . . spending my Saturday or Sunday at the dirtbike track<br/>
watching my 12 year old zoom at excessive speeds around a track, jumping<br/>
with wild abandon. Nor did I think that I would be called from the gardens<br/>
while planting vegetable starts to crawl under the dirtbike and help him<br/>
find the gasoline line to drain the tank, or hold wrenches for him while he<br/>
tightens spokes. For me, helping Sky edit a mythical fantasy story he is<br/>
writing or helping Nell learn her lines for her latest dramatic endeavors -<br/>
that was &#39;easy&#39;. This adventure with Bay has been a stretch for me. And,<br/>
you know what? - it is good for me to stretch. This young man has taught me<br/>
more about unschooling than anyone on the planet. . . and more about<br/>
trusting than anyone, too. <br/>
<br/>
Aloha, Lee<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey Lee, your son sounds so much like my youngest.  Lars is into mountain<br/>
biking, you know where they hurtle down trails laced with jumps and ramps<br/>
that go way up and then teeter-totter down the other side, stuff where they<br/>
can get pretty badly hurt.  He spends a lot of hours up on the hill building<br/>
trails and ramps and jumps.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s also into sports, which I&#39;m not.  You couldn&#39;t pay me to watch<br/>
professional baseball, but I love watching my son&#39;s team.  He seems to need<br/>
that same mix of moving and working outside interspersed with TV and<br/>
computer.  He paid for his bikes by working for his dad too.<br/>
<br/>
And he has also taught me a lot about trusting.  I haven&#39;t succeeded in<br/>
trusting him all through his growing up, but I&#39;m getting better at it all<br/>
the time.  And I too appreciate the stretching I&#39;ve had to do.<br/>
