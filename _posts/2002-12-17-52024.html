<div id="ygrps-yiv-712670093">Hi Tia,<br/>
<br/>
I am certainly no expert but I figure take the dogs natural instincts and<br/>
train it to work FOR you instead of AGAINST you.  Example:  Our dogs are<br/>
herding breeds.  The instinct that drives herding behavior is hunting and<br/>
killing sheep and goats.  Without training, our dogs might well attack the<br/>
goats.  I have bought books and videos and have started training them as<br/>
stock dogs.  It involves me working with the dog on a long lead in the goat<br/>
pen.<br/>
<br/>
Could your dog not be trained to retrieve rather than kill?<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>
