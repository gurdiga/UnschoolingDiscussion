&gt; Annette, I agreed with your post....I hear alot about people being ,<br/>
&gt; well let&#39;s just say, not so friendly to people who have not made the<br/>
&gt; decisions that they have, and it goes both ways.....it&#39;s so hard in<br/>
&gt; this world, as it is , to be & do what you feel is best for your own<br/>
&gt; family, but adding the extra element of judgement, or biased, just<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t fair in my opinion. Now, if I expect people to respect, and<br/>
&gt; leave my family to do things our own way, which I do......I would<br/>
&gt; expect the same from myself, towards others.  All of us are unique &<br/>
&gt; diverse , and I consider this a strength...not all people are best<br/>
&gt; suited to be SAHM&#39;s, but they are wonderful Mothers.  ANd some people<br/>
&gt; , like my aunt, who didn&#39;t want to be a Mother, and wasn&#39;t....was a<br/>
&gt; wonderful teacher of 2nd graders for 40 some years, and I knew how<br/>
&gt; wonderful she was as a teacher, having stayed summers with her when I<br/>
&gt; was young.......some do this , some do that......if we can all see<br/>
&gt; that there are ways of doing things that are not the same, but just as<br/>
&gt; good for others, as our ways are for us....we may have a better chance<br/>
&gt; of learning from, and living with all types of people with all kinds<br/>
&gt; of ways of doing things.  I do think that when we get stuck in the<br/>
&gt; mindset that their is only one right way of doing something, then we<br/>
&gt; close the door of learning.  Just my 10 cents. Michelle<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158304949">I really understand that from a grown ups point of view doing what YOU want <br/>
is very important... But how does that affect the children that are given to <br/>
someone else to care for.  How about their feelings of abandonment and <br/>
resentment that they are not as important as money?  Maybe I&#39;m wrong about <br/>
the way babies and toddlers react to being given to people who may change on <br/>
a regular basis (institutions, not nanny&#39;s)  I&#39;d love to have another <br/>
professional psychologist tell me different.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry Dawn.  I didn&#39;t realize.  Is this a pet project of yours?  <br/>
Professional research or something?<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I agree with you. A friend of mine just recently 
made a point to me that seems to fit in well here. As much as we all try to be 
free thinking, accepting, etc. it&#39;s hard to be pro something without being anti 
something. we all homeschool so in a lot of ways this makes us anti school. 
Those of us that are SAHMs in a lot of ways are anti woking mom. And although we 
are anti these things, that doesn&#39;t make the people that are po these things bad 
people. My best friend sends her kids to ps and although I don&#39;t care for ps 
this does not in my mind make her any less of a person.</font></div>
