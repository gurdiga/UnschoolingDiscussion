<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey, no problem at all.  I also realized that such a short reply must have <br/>
left a lot to be &quot;assumed&quot; LOL.   But seriously, about Santa Claus.  I DID <br/>
believe in him with all my heart, and that made him very real to me.    <br/>
Somehow, my mother played the &quot;Santa&quot; card just right.. lol, and I was never <br/>
left with feelings of being decieved.  I know lots of folks think its not <br/>
right to &quot;lie&quot; to kids about Santa, but to me, it was not a lie, he was <br/>
really REAL as long as I believed in him.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was about 10 or 11, I asked my Mom, &quot;Is Santa Claus real?&quot;  She said, <br/>
&quot;What do you think?&quot;  I said, &quot;Well, I think its really you and Daddy leaving <br/>
our gifts&quot;  .. She said, well, are we &quot;real&quot;? I smiled and said YEAH!...  And <br/>
that was the end of it.  I knew Santa was &quot;really&quot; Mom and Dad, but I played <br/>
along with it til I was married!.  I even insisted that Santa bring me <br/>
something for the first few years of my marriage.  And Santa still comes to <br/>
our house, even though JP is beginning to put things together. AND, Santa <br/>
still gives me some $$$ for Christmas every year in a card marked &quot;Love, <br/>
Santa&quot;  (thats from my Daddy, Santa, not my husband, Santa.. lol)<br/>

&lt;&lt;But seriously, about Santa Claus.  I DID<br/>

Somehow, my mother played the &quot;Santa&quot; card just right.. lol, and I was never<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Wow!! I was exhausted afer reading your post. You sure put a lot of effort<br/>
into this whole Santa thing!!! I sure hope it all works out the way you are<br/>
hoping for.<br/>
<br/>
I know exactly what you mean about it all though. With Tara I was so<br/>
convincing about Santa. She asked a million questions and I worked so hard<br/>
on all the answers. Well I was so convincing that the poor kid was 12 and<br/>
still believeing in Santa. The kids she went to school with that it was<br/>
hysterical. Needless to say she was disappointed when she found out<br/>
otherwise. (her dad told her as he thought she already knew) I can&#39;t say<br/>
that she ever really distrusted me because of the whole Santa thing but I<br/>
vowed never to do it again.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was heartbroken when our kids started coming. He loved the Santa<br/>
story. So when Joseph was old enough to ask, I pretty much left it up to my<br/>
husband. And when Joseph got older yet and asked me, I would ask him what he<br/>
thought. It&#39;s worked that way ever since. Kids are 8,7 and 2. I think they<br/>
still believe in Santa and we do have a gift or two from him at Christmas.<br/>
The kids won&#39;t go to see him though or put out cookies or anything. It&#39;s<br/>
really not a big deal around here and I think that will help make it better<br/>
for them to find out that there&#39;s no man flying through the sky with<br/>
reindeer.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids are dd 23 ds 21 ds 18 dd 14.  If you ask any one of them they will <br/>
tell you there IS a Santa Claus.  No questions, end of discussion.  Two of <br/>
them live in their own homes.  The come to my home to sleep on Christmas Eve, <br/>
they hang their stockings without fail, they leave milk and cookies and <br/>
carrots. (and I have to remind &quot;Santa&quot; to go eat the cookies and drink the <br/>
milk)  <br/>
<br/>
They wake up early early and joyfully run from their rooms to see what Santa <br/>
has brought them.<br/>
<br/>
Now other mostly grown children want to be here too.  We always have a <br/>
special meal and go to Church together and to the live Nativity on Christmas <br/>
Eve.  I started that tradition as my children got older and I fretted that <br/>
they would marry and have other obligations so which ever day they could join <br/>
us, be it Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, I wanted to be special.  Little did <br/>
I know that all other bets are off at Christmas, they are going to be HERE. <br/>
<br/>
I love that.  I also realize that the other two might find mates who have <br/>
families who they want to be with too. But for now, it&#39;s great.  They love <br/>
the mystery of it, the joy of being together and for a least a day, they are <br/>
wrapped up in the magic of it all.<br/>
<br/>
Magic and wonder and joy are great to experience at any age!  We have a slate <br/>
that hangs on the door that says WE BELIEVE!  with a Santa on it that one of <br/>
the kids bought and hung there.<br/>
<br/>
The Easter Bunny still comes too, even big kids love candy and goodies and <br/>
season passes to Kings Dominion that always find their way into the baskets.<br/>
<br/>
How long can/should we keep this up?  My grandmother died three years ago at <br/>
age 88, she lived alone until the last two years of her life.  Every <br/>
Christmas Eve she would get out her &quot;socks&quot; (which was a REAL knee sock) pin <br/>
them together and put them over the back of a kitchen chair (and she had a <br/>
fireplace).<br/>
<br/>
The next morning she would go to her stocking which was filled with all kinds <br/>
of goodies that grandma types like, so excited.  I&#39;ve seen her repeat this <br/>
all my life.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the real message, SHE filled her stocking or maybe it was Santa, but <br/>
sometimes we would show up Christmas morning and no one had been there but <br/>
her and there was that filled up to the brim pair of socks hanging there, <br/>
waiting for the kids or the grand kids or great grandkids to show up and <br/>
share her big surprise with.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess the magic of Santa is there, IF you want it.<br/>

Are you actually saying that your children and grandmother really and truly<br/>
believe a fat guy in a furry suit appears in their house with goodies? Or is<br/>
it just a wonderful family tradition that they enjoy yet all together now?<br/>

&lt;They love the mystery of it, the joy of being together and for a least a <br/>
day, they are <br/>
wrapped up in the magic of it all.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess the magic of Santa is there, IF you want it.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not asking them if they REALLY believe.  They say they believe in Santa, <br/>
they tell everyone that they believe in Santa.  Santa comes they have fun.  <br/>
They get their picture taken with Santa every year together and apart from a <br/>
couple of uncomfortable years when the boys were middle teen agers they enjoy <br/>
it.  It&#39;s something they look forward too.<br/>
<br/>
When they say to me there is no Santa, there is no Easter Bunny, stop this <br/>
nonsense, I don&#39;t believe in it.  I will stop it.  They enjoy it, they look <br/>
forward to it, it&#39;s a family event.<br/>
<br/>
Heck my 23 year old even tried to spend the night and put her wisdom teeth <br/>
under her pillow for the tooth fairy.  <br/>
<br/>
Life as an adult can be boring sometimes.  Especially those in between years <br/>
when you feel like you should act all grown up but no children of your own to <br/>
spend the holidays with so if mine want to be indulged a little longer or <br/>
forever really, it&#39;s not a problem for me.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an adventure.  We have LOTS of traditions that we do in the winter <br/>
leading up to Christmas.  Lots of adult things too, like picking a family <br/>
from the angel tree and shopping for them.  Doing the 12 days of Christmas <br/>
for a family we all select.  (if you don&#39;t know what that is, I can explain <br/>
it but it&#39;s kinda involved but great to do as a family).<br/>
<br/>
So a fat man in a furry red suit?  They see him every year, so of course <br/>
there is a Santa.  Is this man at the mall the TRUE Santa?  Of course not, <br/>
he&#39;s the earth science teacher at the middle school, he wears flippers on his <br/>
feet instead of boots, he can&#39;t be the REAL Santa.<br/>
<br/>
The REAL Santa is in your heart where you can carry him for as long as you <br/>
want.  It&#39;s the magical spirit of make believe that somehow comes true.  It&#39;s <br/>
many things wrapped into one.<br/>
