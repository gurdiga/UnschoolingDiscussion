<br/>
We are in Texas as well.  You are free in Texas.  The requirement means that<br/>
IF someone comes to your door and IF that person questions what kind of<br/>
education your son is getting and IF that person has the proper credentials,<br/>
you need to be able to show that y&#39;all are doing something.<br/>
<br/>
Written curriculum could mean library books, computer manuals, magazines,<br/>
cook books, instructions for the GameCube....  You do NOT have to have some<br/>
scope and sequence written out.  You do NOT have to have lesson plans.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695877659">Thank you. That&#39;s very good to know. We don&#39;t have a lot of money so we won<br/>
t have tons of that kind of thing laying around. We don&#39;t even schedule our<br/>
learning. I take it as it comes, whenever an opportunity presents itself.<br/>
Sometimes just driving around I&#39;ll see something and ask her if she&#39;d like<br/>
to play a &quot;game&quot; using it. Our learning happens at all hours of the day<br/>
wherever we are and I try not to plan it because it seems to dim the shine<br/>
on learning. You know what I mean? We use whatever is available and alot of<br/>
it is this computer. So glad for the internet, inexpensive and you can find<br/>
information on EVERYTHING on it. LOL<br/>
<br/>
I do keep a lose notebook of the things we&#39;ve covered along with a level of<br/>
how much we&#39;ve went into. If we just covered the surface or done an in-depth<br/>
research thing. I don&#39;t I could school using a curriculum LOL It bores me!<br/>
