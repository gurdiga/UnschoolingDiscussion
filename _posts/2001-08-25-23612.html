<div id="ygrps-yiv-488211069">What kind of work are you and hubby looking for or does that make a<br/>
difference?<br/>
<br/>
For reasonable pricing you have to head north of Sonoma County in<br/>
CA--Mendocino County (not the town it is PRICEY!), Humboldt and Del Norte.<br/>
And points north in Oregon are still reasonable.  On up the coast in WA but<br/>
when you start getting close to Seattle the prices head back through the<br/>
roof.<br/>
<br/>
You can off-list e-mail me if you have any other questions or want lots of<br/>
links &lt;g&gt;<br/>
