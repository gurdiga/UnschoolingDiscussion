<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522334174"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;For some odd reason, our society seems to think 5 the perfect age to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>start &quot;formal&quot; education, &gt;&gt;<br/>
Seems to me they&#39;re expected to start at 2 or 3, so they will be &quot;ready&quot;<br/>
for kindergarten!  anyone besides me remember kindergarten as a place to<br/>
color, sing songs, and take a nap?<br/>
Don&#39;t know if I ever introduced myself either.  I&#39;ve only been on-line<br/>
since April.  &quot;Newbie&quot;, that&#39;s me!  I&#39;m transplanted to Southeastern<br/>
Washington State from the greater Seattle metropolis.  Am in my second<br/>
year of hs.  Have two dd, Lisa, nearly 7 and Jackie, just turned 4.  We<br/>
fell into unschooling about halfway through Lisa&#39;s &quot;kindergarten&quot;.  I was<br/>
introducing some phonics, but it was clear that Lisa didn&#39;t get it --<br/>
she&#39;d just guess.  So we spent our time going on field trips, cuddling up<br/>
with a good book, attempting to clean the house (never seem to finish<br/>
that one!), and talking about what we do.  Dh is an inventor trying to<br/>
get a new project off the ground.  I love to read & bake &quot;healthy&quot; stuff.<br/>
 My wish list includes learning to play the piano and more sewing.<br/>
I also do La Leche League and sell DKFL books.  If anyone wants to,<br/>
e-mail me directly about those.<br/>
Mary Ellen<br/>
Be absolutely determined to enjoy what you do.<br/>

Yes!  We had half-day kindergarden with a nap.  My friend&#39;s son had full day <br/>
K (until 2 pm), with NO nap, and they were criticising the neatness of his <br/>
printing!   I was flabbergasted!  (A word I did not learn to spell in <br/>
Kindergarden. ;-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is precisely why, when asked what grade  my 6 yr old is/would be in,<br/>
I hesitate.  if i were forced to put him in an instituional educational<br/>
setting (IES--new acronym?), i would have kept him out of K last year (his<br/>
bday is in dec.) because his fine motor skills SUCK!  His printing is<br/>
atrocious.  Even I can&#39;t read it much of the time, no way a teacher could.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, he comes by this &quot;weakness&quot; naturally.....*I* was kept off the<br/>
honor roll until penmanship was no longer a graded part of the curriculum<br/>
and eventually worked with an occupational therapist at jr. high age to<br/>
learn to write legibly.  My dh, said child&#39;s father, writes like a 4th<br/>
grade boy, exactly as he has since he was in 4th grade and didn&#39;t ever<br/>
learn to form letters &quot;correctly&quot; (makes his circles backwards to this<br/>
day, and remembers getting his hand hit for it all those years ago).<br/>
<br/>
However, outside of neatness, there is nothing in the K curriculum that<br/>
would challenge my son, nothing in the grade 1 curriculum, maybe some<br/>
reading in grade 2, and a little more in grade 3.  But, if he were in most<br/>
typical IES&#39;s, his work would come back withthe words &quot;REDO TOO SLOPPY)<br/>
written on it, regardless of the fact that he had just correctly<br/>
multiplied out 24x36 or diagrammed the circulatory system.  I can only<br/>
tell his math problems (which btw, he chooses to do on his own<br/>
initiative--goddess only knows where *that* interest came from....not *my*<br/>
DNA that&#39;s for sure) are correct because I hear him say the answers or I<br/>
can ask him, &quot;Is that a 2 or a 5?&quot;<br/>

and show and tell and crafts.  And it was only half a day.  K was the last <br/>
fun I had in school until college.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Several years ago a friend told me about the entrance test to one<br/>
local very academic school here in Silicon Valley.  Her soon-to-be<br/>
kindergartener was marked incorrect for answering 2+2 = 4 with his<br/>
&#39;4&#39; written backwards.  She didn&#39;t enroll him in the school; we both<br/>
thought it was a bit much.  I feel very sorry for the children attending<br/>
*that* school.<br/>

didn&#39;t have to go to kindergarten!  In fact, I didn&#39;t, I got to stay home<br/>
with my Mom and never knew the difference!<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Mom in first grade was frightening enough for me thank you.<br/>
