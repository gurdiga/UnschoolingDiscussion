<div id="ygrps-yiv-73859362">Hi Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m posting because I&#39;m sad and lonely, and I want someone to hold my hand. <br/>
<br/>
My dh is sick, and the docs tell me he may never get well enough to be able to work or take responsibility for the little guys while I&#39;m at work, although he will probably be able to live at home for a long time (severe chronic illness).<br/>
<br/>
Just as I was about to bite the bullet and face the fact that I&#39;m running out of money and I have to find child care and get to work, I think my son has whooping cough. So it sounds like it&#39;ll be several more weeks before I can put him with someone and work shifts (I&#39;m a nurse). All solutions I figure now sound like they&#39;ll evaporate in five months when my son reaches *mandatory school age* and child care becomes scarce.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve considered in-home care (a nanny) but realize that if my husband is able to return home, it may be difficult to keep a nanny around with a man in the house all day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d appreciate ideas, or just hand holding.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>
<br/>
:-) Diane<br/>

 </span></blockquote>{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{Diane}}}}}}}}}}}}}}} Here are some cyber-hugs. (I&#39;m not sure <br/>
how to cyber-handhold. ;-))<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re going through such a difficult time. Any one of those <br/>
things-sick dh, sick child, money worries, child care needs-could be enough <br/>
to throw a family off balance. You sound very strong in the face of having <br/>
to deal with so much at once. Your family is lucky to have you.<br/>
<br/>
My best advice is to take these life challenges one day (one moment) at a <br/>
time. Make the best child care/work options you can for now and keep an open <br/>
heart and mind to opportunities that might present themselves to you. If you <br/>
worry too much into the future, you may miss what&#39;s available and good <br/>
today.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is that because it would be childcare through your work? Maybe another <br/>
homeschooling family could do childcare for you? Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good, but challenging at times.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve considered in-home care (a nanny) but realize that if my husband is <br/>
able to return home, it may be difficult to keep a nanny around with a man in <br/>
the house all day. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Male in-home care for your husband and your sons?<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s a homeschooling family around you with teenagers, you might get <br/>
inexpensive assistance that way.   It wouldn&#39;t have to be the same person <br/>
every time, and having different older kids to pay with different times would <br/>
be stimulating for your children.  I hardly ever had babysitters, and those <br/>
we had were usually older kids of families we know, so they&#39;re still in the <br/>
kids&#39; lives sometimes.  Weddings and such.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really sorry to hear of so much from so many directions at once at your <br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
Breathe and breathe, since you&#39;re in wait and wait time.<br/>
Sorry for the likely lame ideas, and I wish we were near enough that Holly <br/>
could play with your boys or they could come over while you worked sometimes.<br/>

ultimately solves everything. With dh out of commission, I didn&#39;t have <br/>
anyone to brainstorm with, so all ideas are definitely of value here. <br/>
I&#39;ve been to the support boards for his illness, but of course they <br/>
don&#39;t have unschooling ideas--childcare? Kindercare!<br/>

Red Cross, they have names of kids who have completed baby sitter training.  <br/>
You may be surprised to find someone nearby who is looking for a situation <br/>
like yours to help out with.<br/>
<br/>
Anna ( 13) has got a &quot;job&quot; in the making of being a mommys helper to a lady <br/>
with 5 boys ( 11, 8, 5, 3, and 1) and she is expecting #6.. She is still <br/>
nursing #5.  Needless to say, she is fatigued and overwhelmed at times, along <br/>
with morning sickness.   She asked Anna to help her out about  3 days a week <br/>
3 or 4 hours a day.  Mostly just an extra pair of hands and eyes.  Nothing <br/>
MAJOR.. play with the little kids, keep an eye on them, maybe serve thier <br/>
lunch.   Basically, be around to give Momma a little break.  Anna has been <br/>
looking for this type of situation for a few weeks and it just sort of <br/>
&quot;happened&quot;   We met this lady at our park day.  Anna was talking about being <br/>
her Grandma&#39;s helper while she recuperates from an hysterectomy.   And the <br/>
lady piped in to say that was exactly what she needs, somebody to just help <br/>
her out.    We are still working out the fine details ( like exact schedule <br/>
and rate of pay.. btw, ANY SUGGESTIONS for that??.. )  Anna will probably <br/>
start helping her next week.    She is really excited and so is the mother <br/>
and her boys.<br/>

I used to pay my neighbor $3 an hour if I was home and $5 if I wasn&#39;t.  If it <br/>
was truly babysitting, $5.  But just hanging out to give the kids someone <br/>
else to play with, show their owies to, get them water... $3.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s been a while, and it was New Mexico.  I don&#39;t know what adjustments <br/>
are good and right and what kids are used to getting for babysitting.<br/>

&gt;That is truly an idea I hadn&#39;t thought of. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or how about a mom with a child around your children&#39;s age, especially if <br/>
you could find someone with similar values (not necessarily planning to <br/>
homeschool, but your example might get her interested :-).<br/>
<br/>
My mother didn&#39;t homeschool but she had to deal with a similar situation. <br/>
My Dad had a brain stem stroke when their kids were 18,15,9,5 and 7 months <br/>
(I was the 15-y.o.). It was, as you of all people can imagine, very <br/>
difficult for all of us. After he spent two years in various hospitals and <br/>
the rehab centre he came home. No movement except a bit of head motion, no <br/>
speech, but with his sharp brain intact (&quot;locked-in&quot; they call it). He had <br/>
a nurse part-time but mom did a lot of the rest.<br/>
<br/>
The most important thing I learned from that is that the caregiver is vital <br/>
and must treat herself as such. When you are the one everyone depends on <br/>
you have to be as good or better to yourself than you are to your children <br/>
and husband. My mother couldn&#39;t accept this and had such a hard time.<br/>
<br/>
My Dad is still alive 23 years later but moved to a nursing home after Mom <br/>
died. She had had cancer before his stroke and it recurred about ten years <br/>
later. I&#39;m not willing to say that there is a link, but if there is I don&#39;t <br/>
think her stress helped.<br/>
<br/>
If you can find any other unschooling/relaxed schooling families in your <br/>
area they might be willing to do occasional child-minding, or at least <br/>
getting together with others may be a real sanity saver on the days you <br/>
don&#39;t have to work.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>www.whoopingcough.net is a good resource for &#39;western medicine&#39; info about it.<br/>
I&#39;m on my 6th or 7th week of whooping cough, but I&#39;m down to very minor <br/>
episodes now.<br/>
Didn&#39;t someone else on the list mention their kid/s have whooping <br/>
cough?  ...and I&#39;ve heard that someone had homeopathy work really well when <br/>
her kids got it.<br/>
Good luck with it and don&#39;t let it freak you out too badly.<br/>
It&#39;ll pass...  just watch out for pneumonia!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-526350465">{{{{{Diane}}}}} Hugs from someone on the other side of your chaos! (not OUT <br/>
of the chaos, just in a different form!)  My hubby died two years ago ~ maybe <br/>
you read my introduction (I don&#39;t want to be redundant!) ~ His father was <br/>
diagnosed with lung cancer two months before he was dx with brain cancer.  <br/>
This disease was the trigger for their reconciliation after 27 years of <br/>
estrangement! (not the miracle you&#39;re silently asking for, but it&#39;s a <br/>
miracle!) He was home with the kid/s off and on during the three years <br/>
post-dx.  He had had part of his brain removed and specialists were unsure if <br/>
he had any *immune memory* left, boy was chicken pox FUN!!  Fun, too, were <br/>
the days I went to work and came home to a disaster bigger than imaginable <br/>
because daddy couldn&#39;t leave his chair nor pull his attention from the telly <br/>
and the 2 & 4 year olds reigned supreme!  Laugh? Cry? Scream? All of the <br/>
above, all at once?  YES!!  then you survive ... quietly the days go by and <br/>
though you can&#39;t imagine making it thru one more (*^&*^* day, you do.  You <br/>
make it thru this one and the next and the next.  Somehow your fingertips <br/>
never do slip off the edge of sanity.  You&#39;re hanging there pretty heavy, you <br/>
want to slip over (and some may speculate you already have), but there is <br/>
*something* in you that stops the mind from completely checking out on you... <br/>
and that *something,* I really don&#39;t know what it is, is the difference <br/>
between those of us who receive these lessons and those who do not.  I only <br/>
had to ask Why Me for a short time, I looked around at the other families in <br/>
my life and I understood, that they really *couldn&#39;t* do it, I sure as He!! <br/>
don&#39;t *wanna* do it, but I know I *CAN.*  Once I questioned God&#39;s sanity, I <br/>
told him that HE may think I&#39;m capable but that it&#39;s not true, I can&#39;t see <br/>
the diana he does, the one I see is not willing/able/ready for this. I won&#39;t <br/>
believe in myself until you show me myself thru your eyes.  For a little bit <br/>
that night, I caught a glimpse of that woman.  She is truly amazing.  I now <br/>
journey towards having her be the authentic version of diana that we all get <br/>
to see. (it&#39;s a looooong journey!)<br/>
Wow, I&#39;ve just rambled your eyes out!  :)  I just want you to know that even <br/>
the rough spots on the road can be joyous.  Find something to laugh about <br/>
today.  Remember why you chose each other to be a family, the gifts you have <br/>
for one another.   (see, I&#39;m off and running again...)<br/>
Feel free to contact me privately about anything!  Really!<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
 diana,<br/>

You have my sympathies. I think I read it&#39;s most infectious in the first two<br/>

This was a beautiful post and true for my life in many ways.<br/>
Trying to handle to death of my son Sam, feels very much like hanging <br/>
by my fingertips over the edge of insanity.  Sometimes I feel like <br/>
letting go would be easier.  But I also know that I have to hold on <br/>
tight and remember the beautiful gift that he was to us.  <br/>
I&#39;m so sad, but I&#39;m so joyful at having known him.  <br/>
I try to remember all the joys left for me in this life.  They are <br/>
always surrounding me.  I just have to see.<br/>
