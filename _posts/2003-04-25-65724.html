<div id="ygrps-yiv-654032749"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;I think you are referring to St. Joseph.  I learned this last year when<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we moved.   Something about burying St.Joseph head down or toward the<br/>
house.  He is patron of homes and families,  so this is generally used<br/>
when a family is moving. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
St Joe is also good for when your house won&#39;t sell. Bury him head down in the back yard and pray for a new family. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

There&#39;s St. Anthony of Padua, patron saint of seekers of lost articles.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s the one, if you lose your keys or your passport.<br/>
