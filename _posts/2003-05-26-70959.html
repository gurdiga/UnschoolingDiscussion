<div id="ygrps-yiv-360866445">The nest is better than 30 feet in the air.  We see it but there is no way <br/>
we could get to it.  Two other birds from the same nest are dead in my <br/>
grandparents backyard, nextdoor.  I know it&#39;s illegal, but I&#39;d rather let <br/>
him live than watch him die. :)  There are several cats in the neighborhood, <br/>
a possible reason for the other&#39;s deaths.  We have left him out for extended <br/>
periods of time alone with no luck as far as the mother coming back.  We <br/>
were told by the wildlife rescue organization that deals in wild birds not <br/>
to leave him for longer than an hour because he has to eat.  There are <br/>
permits for rescuing that we can obtain if he does not get out on his own.  <br/>
We&#39;re looking into that as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735309162">&lt;&lt;You&#39;re taking in that baby blue jay...well, if the adults didn&#39;t come<br/>
get him, there&#39;s nothing wrong with you caring for it. Chances are,<br/>
it&#39;ll go out on its own and be a free bird, when it has grown enough<br/>
to do so. Or...you&#39;ll have a charming, funny pet bird. A good<br/>
experience for your kids, don&#39;t you think? As long as they know it&#39;s<br/>
only because the baby needed rescuing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :)  I&#39;m trying to encourage him to fly and find his own food.  The <br/>
wildlife rescue told us to teach him to hunt his own food so he will have a <br/>
better chance at survival once he does go off on his own.  It&#39;s quiet simple <br/>
really.  She also told us to encourage him to fly.  That&#39;s been really fun <br/>
for the kids.  YES!  It has been an amazing experience for all of us!<br/>
<br/>
This week has been crazy, animal wise.  Our cat, Molly, is an avid hunter.  <br/>
She brought us a prize mouse a few days ago and laid it at my husband&#39;s <br/>
feet.  Still alive but shocked beyond belief.  My silly husband recued it <br/>
and nursed it back to health and set him free.  He&#39;s taken 4 mice from Molly <br/>
this week and fixed them all up and sent them on their way.  I keep telling <br/>
him she&#39;s just going to get them again.  Don&#39;t most people LIKE that their <br/>
cats get all the field mice?  Guess my hubby isn&#39;t one of them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134156560">Yep,<br/>
In North carolina I am a Wildlife Rehaber.<br/>
I don&#39;t take in a lot of animals but mostly I am certified so that If <br/>
I find an abandoned animal, or friends or family could bring them to <br/>
me.<br/>
I was getting the regular because my husband&#39;s ex boss&#39; dog would <br/>
bring up baby squirrels a lot. But mine also covers songbirds.<br/>
One of the most important things is they are warm. I have had no luck <br/>
with bunnies {cotton tail} and really don&#39;t want to try them any <br/>
more. :-(<br/>
I would like to one day get my licence for reptiles {snakes and <br/>
turtles and such} But that is a federal licence, not as easy to get <br/>
as the state so I am told.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s pretty typical for nestlings and fledglings to have a high mortality<br/>
rate.   Your one survivor is probably about right.<br/>
I think it&#39;s nice, what you&#39;re doing.   We raised two Magpies to adult<br/>
hood and they were a delight.  For several years they hung around and if<br/>
one of us was in the yard, they&#39;d land on our head or shoulders.  It&#39;s<br/>
pretty cool to have friends like that. <br/>
<br/>
I have a two pigeons at the moment, who had broken wings and are now on<br/>
the mend.   One keeps tearing strips of newspaper and handing them to me<br/>
through the bars of his cage.  I think we&#39;re dating. <br/>
<br/>
I know someone who raised and kept a Starling nestling she found and her<br/>
bird learned to talk.  He will say &quot;Phone!&quot; when the telephone rings, and<br/>
he says, like Jerry Seinfeld,  &quot;you are so good looking&quot; when someone<br/>
sneezes.   He also mimics household noises and the other critters.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your baby.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OH! You sound like the book &quot;Arnie, the Darling Starling&quot;! might have <br/>
been by Jean Craighead-George, too. We found a tiny starling <br/>
hatchling and managed to keep him alive overnight, but it wasn&#39;t warm <br/>
enough, and we probably weren&#39;t feeding it correctly, but I&#39;ll never <br/>
forget him hiking his little behind up over the edge of the &quot;nest&quot; he <br/>
was in, and pooping over the side! <br/>
<br/>
But he was dead on the second morning. :(<br/>
