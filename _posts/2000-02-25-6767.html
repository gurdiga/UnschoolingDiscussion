<div id="ygrps-yiv-535571026"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  Here is another one. Tuesday, a 13 yo girl was on her way to school here<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Port Huron, MI. Holland Woods Middle School backs up to the local<br/>
 </span></blockquote>partially<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  wooded park. As she cut through the park, a man approached her. He asked<br/>
 </span></blockquote>her<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  why she wasn&#39;t in school. She said that she was not allowed to talk to<br/>
&gt;  strangers, and he hit her in the head several times. She hit a tree,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>started<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  yelling, and hitting back. He ran away, and has not been caught. BTW,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  is the same school that became a national media target when 4 boys<br/>
 </span></blockquote>planned a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  pep rally massacre and bomb was found...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow! That&#39;s horrible.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I heard one around here too...<br/>
&gt;  A bus driver got fed up with the kids on his bus.  He stopped the bus<br/>
&gt;  and made all the kids get out and walk home!<br/>
&gt;  There were kids of several ages on this bus.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The sad thing is that I CAN imagine it! A lot of the bus drivers around here<br/>
are nasty...and I can actually see a few of them doing it. I&#39;ve even heard<br/>
it threatened. I went to public school and have heard things like that<br/>
before...and when I was in Kindergarten, the bus driver missed my stop...but<br/>
a few houses up (we lived in a pretty &quot;rural&quot; area and that was VERY far),<br/>
one of the parents said they knew me and my parents...so the bus driver put<br/>
me off there! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...things are just too crazy. We have considered sending the children<br/>
to high school...but I&#39;m not so sure any more.<br/>
