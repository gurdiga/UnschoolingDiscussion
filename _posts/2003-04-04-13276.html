<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630930449"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;While I don&#39;t recommend the method for euthanizing a pet cat, C02 is not a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>horrible way to die. People die that way all the time, accidentally and on<br/>
purpose, and it&#39;s very peaceful.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree, Pam.  CO2 is not car exhaust, nor is it anesthesia.  Having<br/>
anesthetized cats in clear plastic boxes, I can tell you that they do NOT<br/>
sit there and relax.   They are very stressed and fight it.  While it was<br/>
once thought that the gas (I&#39;m speaking specifically about isoflurane, the<br/>
commonly used anesthetic gas in vet med) had little effects on the heart and<br/>
lungs and it was a safe way to anesthetize older pets, we&#39;ve since found it<br/>
is extremely hypotensive (lowers blood pressure) and the chamber is highly<br/>
stressful.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I feel the same way about vet care (or medical care for humans for that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>matter). Frankly, the vast majority of experienced laymen rabbit and guinea<br/>
pig breeders know more about their health and needs than the vast majority<br/>
of general-practice vets. Such is life with &quot;exotics&quot;.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, that is very much the case.  Good exotics vets are few and<br/>
far between.  Unless a vet student is interested in these critters, the<br/>
curriculum lumps them all, from birds and reptiles to gerbils and rabbits<br/>
into 2 weeks.  Then maybe two 2-week in clinics.  Definitely NOT enough time<br/>
to learn about them.  And it is also why I choose not to treat them.<br/>

&gt; Since when are rabbits, guinea-pigs and gerbils &#39;exotics&#39;?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve had all 3 for years and whenever we took one to a vet (our town had two<br/>
 </span></blockquote>vets)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; generally that was the main &#39;pet&#39; they saw. Our vet would neuter male<br/>
&gt; guinea-pigs for £20.<br/>
&gt; The vet in VA wanted $600 for the same operation!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here in Wacky America, they&#39;re exotic. &lt;g&gt; For $600, I would expect that not<br/>
only would the pig get neutered, but &quot;falsies&quot; would be put in (to protect<br/>
his self-esteem) and also he&#39;d receive for free a course of therapy to get<br/>
over the loss. ;)<br/>
