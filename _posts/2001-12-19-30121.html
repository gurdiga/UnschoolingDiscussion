League of Nations Proclamation of the British Mandate, which was made <br/>
public in Palestine on September 11, 1922. The British Mandate was the <br/>
first major step toward implementation of the Balfour Declaration; a <br/>
Jewish State in what is now Israel. September 11 is a day of infamy for <br/>
the Palestinians, and they sought the same for America.<br/>
The media bosses had to know of the significance of that date. But, no <br/>
major news source even mentioned it. The date can be found in many <br/>
historical dating indexes, including [ <br/>

There is much more to this speech, but I&#39;ll refrain from posting it. I <br/>
don&#39;t beleive in choosing ONE faction of people OVER another. But, I do <br/>
beleive in EQUALITY. And America&#39;s prejudicial Foreign Policy over the <br/>
past 60 or more years has brought this tragedy upon itself. I blame the <br/>
people in Washington (past and/or present) that have put all of our lives <br/>
at risk by acting unlawfully and without redemption.<br/>
<br/>
MIT professor Noam Chomsky also wrote some great and indisputeable <br/>
information regarding America&#39;s foreign policy. Its worth it for you and <br/>
the older kids to read it in its entirety.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In my opinion, local news carries more weight with me and seems to filled <br/>
with more integrity than network news.<br/>
<br/>
I live in NYC. On that historic date, local news covered it with extreme <br/>
heroism. When network new took over (and you should of seen Roz Abrahms <br/>
face when she announced that they had to turn it over to network) lots of <br/>
good information disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
It was a perfect example of how large &#39;corporate&#39; business vs the local <br/>
smaller ones.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info Melinda, I appreciate that there&#39;s still integrity!<br/>

When I watched tv on September 11, I watched a local Chicago station because <br/>
as I live in a suburb of Chicago, they were providing the most news of a <br/>
local impact.  (Several relatives and friends work in buildings that are <br/>
prominent and were evacuated that day.)  Anyway, they had a college professor <br/>
(Loyola, I think) who was on that day and periodically on since as their <br/>
analyst who did mention that 9/11 had at least a half dozen historical <br/>
meanings that could apply.  As no one knew where the attacks were coming <br/>
from, he didn&#39;t know if any of those historical footnotes had any importance. <br/>
 He briefly mentioned a few of them, including Balfour, and this was a topic <br/>
mentioned several times that day.<br/>
