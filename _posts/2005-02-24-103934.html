<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025723320">I just reread this today and saw it in a new way, an unschooling way:<br/>
<br/>
*When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don&#39;t blame <br/>
the lettuce.  You look for reasons it is not doing well.  It may <br/>
need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun.  You never blame the <br/>
lettuce.  Yet if we have problems with our friends or family, we <br/>
blame the other person.  But if we know how to take care of them, <br/>
they will grow well, like the lettuce.  Blaming has no positive <br/>
effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and <br/>
judgment.  That is my experience.  No blame, no reasoning, no <br/>
argument, just understanding.  If you understand, and you show that <br/>
you understand, you can love, and the situation will change.*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144821881">Yes, that&#39;s one of my favorite passages. Very reminiscent of Holt&#39;s <br/>
remark that you don&#39;t pull something out by the roots to keep checking <br/>
on it&#39;s progress. Anyone remember that one?<br/>
