deal by Flylady, even though her style sometimes makes me want to puke.  I <br/>
ignore the stuff that doesn&#39;t work for me, like shoes and shiny sink, and <br/>
concentrate on developing  routines that work for me.  My house has never <br/>
looked better, and I&#39;m feeling much better about my ability to cope, so <br/>
something about it is working.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I use Flylady like I use a lot of advice.  I take what I can use<br/>
and I adapt her principles to my life and my personality.  For me<br/>
the shoes and getting dressed is no problem - I don&#39;t feel awake<br/>
until I&#39;ve showered and gotten dressed.  Makeup - no way.  I have<br/>
realized after being a struggling Flybaby for some time that her<br/>
routines don&#39;t fit me that well.  But I do see the need for<br/>
routines - so I am making up my own.  I printed up a chart of<br/>
weekly and monthly things that need to be done around here.  I<br/>
fill the date in when I do them - that way I know that I watered<br/>
the plants last Tues. so they need it again (or don&#39;t need it if<br/>
it&#39;s only Th)!<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps someone else!  The list which is for people who<br/>
don&#39;t like her system is FlySwatters - it&#39;s a pretty high volume<br/>
list so I gave it up!<br/>

<br/>
Just remember when you get through to the site - Don&#39;t let the shoes and <br/>
makeup thing turn you off.  Just ignore that, if it&#39;s not your style.  <br/>
Give her a chance.  She does have a lot of good stuff to offer and has <br/>
helped me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you have to take flylady and make it your own.  Pick one or two <br/>
things that you will do when you do get up in the morning and start just <br/>
doing them.  Same with one or two things before bed at night.  When those <br/>
are routine, start looking around for other routines that would work.  As <br/>
an example, I used to put off cleaning the bathroom until I couldn&#39;t stand <br/>
the smell anymore (didn&#39;t teach the kid to pee sitting down when he was <br/>
little - too late now).  Then I started doing a quick clean while the dog <br/>
eats his breakfast before we go outside.  The bathroom is always quite <br/>
decent now, even though some days things get in the way and I don&#39;t do <br/>
it.  Look for little things like that, one at a time.  You *will* notice a <br/>
difference.<br/>
