 One summer, at the grandparents house, my three kids and a cousin built a raft with 2 liter bottles and those flat shipping crate things.  They named it the COKE Float and christened it with a can of the stuff.  Grammy sent photos to the company and they sent a nice letter and some freebie coupons.  I teased her that if they had actually painted it red instead of green (some left over stuff they had) they might have ended up in a commercial or add or something!!  I have the letter etc in our scrapbook.  Very cool summer fun.<br/>
