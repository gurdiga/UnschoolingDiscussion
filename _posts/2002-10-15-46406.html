 </span></blockquote>I think you are right.  Romans 1:28-29 says:  Furthermore, since they <br/>
did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave <br/>
them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.  They <br/>
have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and <br/>
depravity.  I am sure I could find a similar description in the <br/>
Jewish scripture.<br/>
<br/>
These verses are not only descriptive of evil, but prophetic, <br/>
like &quot;Back to the Future II&quot; in real life.<br/>
