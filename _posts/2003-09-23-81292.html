<div id="ygrps-yiv-994871536">Hi all!  I&#39;m new to this list, though know some of you in &quot;real life&quot;<br/>
and recognize a lot of names from other lists I&#39;m on.  <br/>
<br/>
My name is Alyce, I have 3 kids - 2 of &quot;school&quot; age, and one who&#39;s older<br/>
and trying to find her way/direction in life at the present...<br/>
Technically I&#39;d say she&#39;s being unschooled as well, though the law at<br/>
this point doesn&#39;t require she be &quot;schooled&quot; at all.<br/>
<br/>
OK...now...<br/>
I was avoiding the whole beliefs thread because trying to discuss that<br/>
sort of ultimately abstract &quot;thing&quot; is hard using words... And in the<br/>
end gives me a big fat headache.  BUT I got drawn into to it even<br/>
scrolling past at a relatively high rate of speed... I was compelled to<br/>
add &quot;Illusions, the Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah&quot; by Richard Bach<br/>
is probably my all time favorite book.  I&#39;ve owned several copies... I<br/>
keep lending them out and they never come back to me.  :)  The first<br/>
copy I gave away about 20 years ago to a man (boy then - we were<br/>
teenagers) I ended up marrying 2 years ago this Halloween.  I find that<br/>
interesting and it only just occurred to me in this writing.  Anyway...<br/>
That&#39;s neither here nor there as I&#39;m sure nobody wants to hear the<br/>
meandering tale of the last 20 years of my life.  Finally, Holly, I<br/>
couldn&#39;t have said it better myself and I&#39;d be loathe to try.  That&#39;s<br/>
it!<br/>
