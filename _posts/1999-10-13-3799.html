<div id="ygrps-yiv-296391781">Play clay<br/>
(yield: 1.5 cups)<br/>
<br/>
1/2 cup salt<br/>
1/2 cup hot water<br/>
1/2 cup cold water<br/>
1/2 cup cornstarch<br/>
<br/>
mix the salt into the water and bring it to a boit<br/>
stir the cornstarch into the cold water<br/>
add the two mixtures together and stir vigorously to avoid lumping<br/>
cook the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly until it thickens, it <br/>
should resemble the consistency of pie dough<br/>
remove the mixture from the heat and let it cool<br/>
knead the mixture until it is soft and pliable<br/>
<br/>
This is an excellent dough to roll out and use for flat items and Christmas <br/>
decorations. It can be dried in the air overnight, or in the oven at two <br/>
hundred degrees for one hour.<br/>

        I think that I will move closer to the gym, that way between sets,<br/>
        I can run home and eat something sweet to keep up my energy! s.<br/>
