<div id="ygrps-yiv-620015569">Sorry don&#39;t have links right away... but when i read your line &quot;4 3 to 6<br/>
year olds&quot; i had to write something at least :-)  I have a  5.5 and a 2.5.<br/>
Not sure if you live in an apt. or house... but i live in an apt and<br/>
although its a rental we can work on the walls with non-oil-based stuff.  So<br/>
i get just 2 colors like yellow and blue in larggish tubs adn take on a wall<br/>
with the kids.  lots of splash and fun.  This is possible in a balcony too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also tearing pages out of magazines is fun for my younger one.  the older<br/>
one pretends that each page is something to be attacked.. and goes for them<br/>
with gusto and a scissor.  Also can be glued within a shape.  DD loves<br/>
elephants... so i draw a large elephant on a poster sheet and then we stick<br/>
as many magazine pages , cut and otherwise, within that shape. and of course<br/>
many a time they invent their own games once the materials are beign used in<br/>
the way i perceive :-)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter loves stitching, rolling wool into a ball and also cutting up<br/>
wool.... so does my older one.  so i&#39;ve made them a seperate stitch box...<br/>
some buttons, zippers, large plastic/metal needles and tons of wool.  the<br/>
wool fits thru the large needle.<br/>
<br/>
Also i have kept a couple of those largish 365 days a year activity books<br/>
around.  sometimes i rifle thru it to get inspiration.  they are available<br/>
at some point or the other on sale at Borders (book store that was nearest<br/>
me when in NJ)  and this way i dont&#39; have to open the comp and search.  this<br/>
seems to bug my kids.... they don&#39;t mind me being on the phone... but if i&#39;m<br/>
glued to the screen then it bothers them.  so books are easier right now.<br/>
<br/>
We have a large box of beads (that needs to get refilled soon)... this gets<br/>
used a lot by my daughter.  we keep plenty of pipe cleaners for her to<br/>
string them onto... and older one often uses the beads in his large cement<br/>
mixer and dump truck.<br/>
<br/>
hope something from the above leads to something for you and your children.<br/>
peace, hema<br/>
