I like the message.  But I think they usually break them by fifth grade.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe school is more efficient than you&#39;re remembering!  By the 13th year, <br/>
they&#39;re up to working on breaking the stunted but emerging ADULT spirit!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548166923">I think for me it was 7th.  The school had alot of students, I was used to<br/>
one teacher and maybe 15 kids in class, but now there were 7 different<br/>
classes with 7 different teachers.  I felt like a speck.  A helpless speck. <br/>
We were heavily critisized when we didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; something.  Those (like me)<br/>
who couldn&#39;t take it, were labled shy and remedial.  And so we were.<br/>
<br/>
I went to a smaller private school in 9th through 12th, which was better on<br/>
a social end, we interacted with 6th graders to adult---but by then I had<br/>
forgotten how to learn...so I guess it didn&#39;t really matter whether I<br/>
switched to a small school or stayed where I was at that point.<br/>

<h4>Tim and Maureen</h4>
<time>21 May 2003, at  8:08am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003148190">my son went to preschool and was forced to give up the stool he was sitting on for the teacher(kids were to sit on the floor) and decided preschool was not for him. I remember being puzzled but happy and somewhat amused that my 4 year old could see injustice so easily.<br/>

  I didn&#39;t know it at the time, but in retrospect...I remember seeing the bewilderment and fright in my son&#39;s eyes in preschool.  And it just went downhill from there.<br/>

    &lt;&lt;I&#39;ve always thought that it&#39;s a little closer to 2nd-3rd grade, around the<br/>
    time that school stops being fun and the kids who used to feel sorry for<br/>
    homeschoolers become envious!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    For Tara it was 3rd grade. I thought at the time it was just the teacher. In<br/>
    4th grade I wasn&#39;t so sure. By 5th grade I was very sure.<br/>
<br/>
    For me, I remember vividly, it was the 6th grade. Just totally squashed me.<br/>
    But I fought like hell after that and became a rebel. It served me well.<br/>

 I actually thought it was a typo. I was going to say too bold but knowing <br/>
that MLK said it that would be quite an impressive bumper sticker.<br/>
