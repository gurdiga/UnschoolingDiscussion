10 Great Roll-Up-Your-Sleeves Trades for Smart People<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, I&#39;ve observed there are some trades which are both always in<br/>
demand, and enable a person to earn a comfortable living by North American<br/>
standards.  These are excellent livelihoods for people who aren&#39;t natural<br/>
team players, and who revel in seeing the results of their labor.<br/>
<br/>
I wish more young people would seriously consider learning such a trade<br/>
rather than following the crowd to the university.  This particularly<br/>
applies to those (some of whom may be at the top of their class<br/>
academically) who aren&#39;t troubled by real or imagined blue collar stigmas,<br/>
love to work with their hands, and aren&#39;t afraid to admit they prefer<br/>
learning by doing rather than by listening to lectures, reading textbooks,<br/>
cramming, and taking multiple choice tests.<br/>
<br/>
While in most cases, you can learn these trades on the job, some people find<br/>
a certificate course at a local low-cost community college a good jumping<br/>
off point.  Ideally, all those wanting to become self-employed should not<br/>
only learn their chosen trade, but also acquire a working knowledge of<br/>
computers, and basic accounting.<br/>
<br/>
My top 10 (in no specific order):<br/>
<br/>
1.   Plumber:<br/>
The need for this will never disappear.  Few tradespeople are more<br/>
appreciated than an honest plumber who fixes a broken pipe or clogged line.<br/>
<br/>
2.   Professional Cleaner:<br/>
As long as there are people, there will be dirt.  This is a fact, not a<br/>
criticism.  Believe it or not, there are many specialized cleaning services<br/>
which allow contractors to earn $50 or more per hour.  Some of these include<br/>
carpet, chimney, sewer, and duct cleaning.<br/>
<br/>
3.   House Painter:<br/>
A good, conscientious house painter is always in demand.   Do excellent work<br/>
and your customers will do all of your advertising for you.<br/>
<br/>
4.   Arborist:<br/>
Trees don&#39;t stop growing until they die; dead trees need to be removed,<br/>
growing trees need pruning.<br/>
<br/>
5.   Appliance Repair:<br/>
This one ranks up there with plumbing.  Be a hero on a daily basis.  Talk<br/>
about job satisfaction!<br/>
<br/>
6.   HVAC Contractor:<br/>
This is a sure bet.  People need to stay warm in the winter and cool in the<br/>
summer.<br/>
<br/>
7.  Landscape Gardener:<br/>
Lawns always grow.  So do weeds.  A lot of people don&#39;t have the time to<br/>
tend their gardens.  That&#39;s where you come in.<br/>
<br/>
8.   Locksmith:<br/>
People in a hurry tend to lose their keys or lock them in the car more<br/>
often.  Our society is overflowing with frantically busy people.  Also, with<br/>
so many people changing their residence each year, there is an ongoing need<br/>
for re-keying locks.<br/>
<br/>
9.   Barber:<br/>
Hair just keeps on growing.  No advertising necessary if you have enough<br/>
loyal customers.  Also, it&#39;s a great way to meet and learn from a wide<br/>
variety of people.  Over the years, I&#39;ve quite possibly learned more while<br/>
talking to people in barbershops than I ever did in a college classroom.<br/>
<br/>
10.  Ditch Digger:<br/>
You&#39;d be surprised at how many ditches need to be dug.  General contractors<br/>
send ditch diggers lots of work.  Government agencies, property owners,<br/>
small businesses--all require ditches from time to time.  A skilled digger<br/>
will have more than enough business<br/>
