<br/>
  I was watching old Looney Tunes cartoons with Casey last week. A <br/>
little baby had crawled away without the babysitter noticing, so it <br/>
was up to Tom and Jerry to keep him out of trouble. (Made me thankful <br/>
I didn&#39;t leave my babies with babysitters, but that&#39;s beside the <br/>
point.) Anyway, the baby crawls onto a flagpole extended out <br/>
perpendicular from the tall apartment building. It looks like he&#39;ll <br/>
fall for sure, but when he reaches the end, he crawls right around it <br/>
and is now crawling back toward the building on the underside of the <br/>
flagpole. I was just about to comment &quot;Hey that&#39;s not possible!&quot; when <br/>
Casey says with a smile, &quot;I just love cartoon physics.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, okay then. The learning is everywhere. ~~ Mary Gold ~~<br/>

<br/>
THE VIEW FROM 20 YEARS OUT<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/201.html">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/201.html</a><br/>
<br/>
What then should be the end result of homeschooling? What great goal, <br/>
what worthy purpose do we seek in educating our own? What do we know <br/>
of our journey&#39;s eventual destination, what do we hope for and dream <br/>
of for these children nearing adulthood?<br/>
<br/>
Twenty-plus years of homeschooling have only left me right back where <br/>
I started: With more questions than answers. These are different <br/>
questions, to be sure; they address larger perspectives. Instead of <br/>
&quot;How much should I teach my kids about science?&quot; or &quot;Will they really <br/>
learn to read on their own?&quot; the questions are now &quot;Do they have a <br/>
good grasp of how the world really works?&quot; or &quot;Will they find work <br/>
they like doing, and opportunities to spend their time among people <br/>
they enjoy being with?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have been fortunate to find work I enjoy - communicating with words <br/>
and ideas - and to work with people I like - primarily other <br/>
homeschooling parents. It feels good to know the work we do with this <br/>
magazine makes a difference in the world.<br/>
<br/>
But what of our children? Have we done as much as possible to help <br/>
them prepare to take their places in the world, in this rapidly <br/>
changing, ever-more confusing and perplexing world? And even now, as <br/>
most of them are grown and already working in the larger world, is <br/>
there more we - the older and presumably wiser ones - could be doing <br/>
to help change things, change society, for the better? ~~ Helen <br/>
Hegener ~~<br/>

<br/>
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am furious. My 8 year old is the only homeschooled child, and the <br/>
youngest, in his den of fourth grade Boy Scouts. The den mother does <br/>
everything in her power to make him an outsider. She&#39;s commented on <br/>
his limited reading skills in front of him, has scouting papers <br/>
distributed in school (meaning we aren&#39;t informed about some events) <br/>
and pointedly ignores me. That my son is years ahead of the other <br/>
boys in math, mechanical skills and simple politeness hasn&#39;t come to <br/>
her attention. Last week when I picked him up I noticed most of the <br/>
scouts were inattentive and rough but she only corrected one <br/>
child--mine--for not picking up a paper scrap. My son likes this den <br/>
and I don&#39;t want to burn any bridges by saying the wrong thing to <br/>
this woman. Now what?&quot;  ~~ Derrick&#39;s mom ~~<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My two children aren&#39;t interested in sports or video games like <br/>
their friends. My husband thinks I&#39;ve &#39;made&#39; our kids too different. <br/>
I&#39;ll admit that we&#39;ve had fun learning about ancient history, <br/>
philosophy and drama---in fact my son contributes to a web site about <br/>
philosophic thought. But he&#39;s right, they don&#39;t have much in common <br/>
with their peers. I don&#39;t think they would have been like their <br/>
classmates if they were in school either. These are my children&#39;s <br/>
interests. To what degree do you think we &#39;make&#39; our children <br/>
different?&quot;  ~~ Kim Silas ~~<br/>

<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s very difficult to talk to people without making them think. <br/>
&#39;Thought-provoking&#39; is generally considered, even by most unschoolers <br/>
I know, to be a good thing. I see nothing wrong with intentionally <br/>
arousing a person&#39;s curiosity about any subject, including math. It&#39;s <br/>
not the same as making them sit down and study something that they <br/>
are not interested in and have no need for...<br/>
<br/>
One of the most common objections to unschooling that I hear is that <br/>
children may not find and develop their true talents if they aren&#39;t <br/>
compelled to study a wide variety of unrelated subjects. We counter <br/>
this objection with the concept of &#39;strewing,&#39; which is certainly <br/>
intended to make our children think. Sure, we&#39;re giving them freedom <br/>
to think as much or as little as they please about any given topic; <br/>
but we&#39;re still trying to expose them to as much food for thought as <br/>
we can serve up.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was provoked into doing algebra in her head. Now she wonders <br/>
why. That&#39;s good. It may lead her to wonder if and how other, more <br/>
complicated real life problems can be rearranged into simpler <br/>
arithmetic expressions, which may lead to an interest in scientific <br/>
method, statistics, engineering, economics, or numerous other <br/>
math-intensive fields. She just needs Dad to take a breath and think <br/>
about what it is she&#39;s really curious about and try to develop that <br/>
interest instead of doing a memory dump on her.&quot; ~~ anonymous poster <br/>

LINCOLN FELLOWSHIP CONTEST<br/>
www.gettysburg.edu/academics/cwi/Lincoln_Fellowship/index.htm<br/>
<br/>
The Lincoln Fellowship of Pennsylvania invites students in 7th and <br/>
8th grade to participate in its annual essay contest, &quot;What the <br/>
Gettysburg Address Means to Me.&quot; The deadline is March 31, 2003.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers have dominated this contest the past two years with 2/3 <br/>
of all entries. A homeschool student from MA won in 2001.The prize <br/>
includes a $100 cash award and a Gettysburg family vacation package <br/>
for four featuring 2 nights lodging, 5 meals, tours, and admission to <br/>
many local attractions during the annual November 19th Dedication Day <br/>
ceremony marking the anniversary of Lincoln&#39;s Gettysburg Address.<br/>
<br/>
The featured speaker at this national event, which last year drew <br/>
over 3000 attendees, is always a well-known personality. Past <br/>
speakers have included Gen. Colin Powell and Gov. Christy Todd <br/>
Whitman. Mrs. Lynne V. Cheney, Senior Fellow at the American <br/>
Enterprise Institute, former chairman of the National Endowment for <br/>
the Humanities, and wife of Vice President Dick Cheney, was last <br/>
year&#39;s speaker.<br/>
<br/>
The highlight of the experience for the contest winner is the <br/>
opportunity to read his or her essay at the annual luncheon of the <br/>
Lincoln Fellowship.<br/>
<br/>

HOMESCHOOL VOLUNTEERS<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/nhen/pov/editors/default.asp?id=451">http://www.nhen.org/nhen/pov/editors/default.asp?id=451</a><br/>
<br/>
I do a lot of volunteer work for the National Home Education Network. <br/>
Our motto is &quot;Changing the way the world sees homeschooling.&quot; Earlier <br/>
this year, as I was preparing a speech for our state conference, it <br/>
occurred to me that if the hundreds of thousands of homeschooling <br/>
families across the country donated just ten hours each year, doing <br/>
nothing but helping to further the public image of homeschooling, <br/>
millions of hours would be spent. Can you imagine the result of more <br/>
than a million hours, spent in communities across the nation, doing <br/>
nothing more than helping the public understand homeschooling and <br/>
homeschoolers just a little better? What an incredibly powerful <br/>
effect that would have!<br/>
<br/>
So, I am advocating the just-ten-hours approach. Love to write? Write <br/>
letters to the editor of your local paper or to national magazines. <br/>
Are you a people person? Invite a local reporter to a homeschool <br/>
outing and be your charming, outgoing self. You&#39;re the organization <br/>
queen or king? Volunteer to organize a project or outing for a <br/>
homeschooling organization, then find a way to let the community know <br/>
about it. Work together with others to spread the message that <br/>
homeschooling is a great choice for many families.<br/>
<br/>
Keep track of your hours and let us know, at NHEN, what you&#39;ve done. <br/>
We&#39;d love for your efforts to inspire others. And if you&#39;d like to do <br/>
that volunteer work through NHEN, or just want some ideas, contact us <br/>
at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:volunteers@...">volunteers@...</a> and we&#39;ll be happy to help you get started. ~~ <br/>

find 60 uses each for vinegar, salt and baking soda. You might even <br/>
want to let your kids play too!<br/>

BRIDGE DESIGN CONTEST<br/>

<br/>
The second annual West Point Bridge Design Contest began in January. <br/>
Last year several homeschool kids competed successfully and it would <br/>
be great if we were represented by more this year. Winners receive <br/>
scholarships or notebook computers. If nothing else, the free <br/>
software is good for hours of fun. Both my 10- and 17-year-old <br/>
created bridges with it, although the contest is only open to kids <br/>
ages 13 through grade 12.<br/>

FINAL WORD<br/>
<br/>
If you send up a weather vane or put your thumb up in the air every <br/>
time you want to do something different, to find out what people are <br/>
going to think about it, you&#39;re going to limit yourself. That&#39;s a <br/>
very strange way to live. ~ Jessye Norman ~<br/>
