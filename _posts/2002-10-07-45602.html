Okay, now I&#39;m very interested.<br/>
<br/>
Someone who HAS had blue gatorade around says it hasn&#39;t stained. <br/>

I think truth is very, very important.<br/>
If blue gatorade doesn&#39;t stain skin, but a mom has told children it will <br/>
(based on what?) and told a large public group of unschoolers it will, why?<br/>
<br/>
I might have to buy a bottle and see what it will stain.<br/>
<br/>
My husband drinks the yellowish gatorade sometimes.  He&#39;s used powdered <br/>
gatorade for big camping trips (SCA tournaments/wars) sometimes.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to be thick or strong enough to stain anything.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-773668603">Well, we had some purple gatorade once. Didn&#39;t stain clothes or skin, but it did stain my floor. Weird. I had to clorox twice to get it up. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-520239067">All I can say about Gatorade is what I know from experience. We have had <br/>
every imaginable color in this house of it. My Sierra loves to try them all <br/>
and see which ones she likes better. I drink it and prefer the blue and <br/>
light green (not the lime one) and also the fierce purple. Alyssa, my <br/>
two-year old likes it too. Needless to say, anything she drinks or eats <br/>
eventually gets spilled!! I have had it on her skin and clothes. Blue, <br/>
fierce grape and fierce berry. I&#39;ve never had it stain her skin or clothes <br/>
to where I couldn&#39;t get it out. Meaning couldn&#39;t get it out of her clothes, <br/>
it stained when it happened but washed out.<br/>
