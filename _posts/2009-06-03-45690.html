<div id="ygrps-yiv-239456287">Sandra, it is really fun to hear about the resurfacing of &#39;detox.&#39;<br/>
I like when that happens too.<br/>
<br/>
=================================<br/>
<br/>
I remembered more clearly when I was doing something altogether  <br/>
different last night.  There was a set of files people could download,  <br/>
or that could be sent as single e-mails, and if people requested &quot;The  <br/>
Unschooling Barrage,&quot; there was someone who had volunteered to send  <br/>
them all those files (in batches, every few days, I think).   And I  <br/>
was doing an e-mail newsletter.   People didn&#39;t stay online as they do  <br/>
now, but used to download e-mail, paying by the second, and then read  <br/>
it offline.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  I went to look for it and found this note from old days, on a  <br/>
site I don&#39;t even recognize:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-The Unschooling Information Barrage is a set of 23 pieces of e-mail  <br/>
that consists primarily of unschooling chat logs, articles, and  <br/>
resources available to anyone seeking knowledge about the unschooling  <br/>
philosophy and method of homeschooling.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And the mom who volunteered to do the mailings so I could do other  <br/>
things was Monica Molinar.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some of those 23 pages are surely incorporated into my site already,  <br/>
but now I&#39;ve put in the &quot;detox&quot; transcript:<br/>

<br/>
It was 1995 or 1996; Kirby was nine.  He&#39;ll be twenty-three next month.<br/>

&quot;unschooling barrage&quot; sender was actually Sue Gaffney (AOL screenname <br/>
was Inknote) who passed away in 2004 from lung cancer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880570580">Deb C. pointed out a formatting glitch, and I&#39;ve fixed that.  Instead  <br/>
of pasting an HTML paragraph mark in by itself, I had included the end  <br/>
of someone&#39;s sentence over and over and over and over.   Sorry.  It&#39;s  <br/>
gone now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are some good ideas in there I had forgotten about.   The flood  <br/>
of info-in-the-moment sometimes washes away jewels with the gravel.    <br/>
That&#39;s why websites are so important to me.   There are stunning ideas  <br/>
and truths in many discussions over the years and I hate for them to  <br/>
be lost forever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-345426261">So much good in the historic detox chat. I am thankful for the post. It fits right where I have been lately. I have found that unschooling touches so much more than just the way we learn. It is a way of life. I am letting go of so many &#39;old&#39; learned ideas and replacing them with joy and love. What feels right in my heart. It is amazing and yes, detox happens. Grateful for the support and to see the waves of the ages.<br/>
 So glad to have read the old chat because it gave me new insight and ideas.<br/>
