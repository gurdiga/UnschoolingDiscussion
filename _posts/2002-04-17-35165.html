unschooling is all about, of course. Quite the opposite, imo.<br/>

Lots of homeschoolers probably do homeschool in order to limit and control <br/>
their kids&#39; exposure, though. Even unschoolers want to keep at least our <br/>
younger kids from being exposed to coercive school educational methods, if <br/>
nothing else. And many of us have been accused of keeping our kids out of <br/>
school in order to keep them from being exposed to &quot;the real world&quot; - which <br/>
is sometimes a euphemism for &quot;people of other ethnicities and races.&quot; Such an <br/>
accusation was made on the NHEN Legislative list recently by a highly <br/>
respected (not by homeschoolers) academician, Rob Reich. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents typically (but apparently not always, based on things <br/>
said here) consider it their responsibility to their children TO expose them <br/>
to many possibilities, to make sure that their kids have as wide experience <br/>
of the world as possible so that they have many options, especially, but not <br/>
only, as teens. Far from limiting their choices, unschooling parents usually <br/>
take real steps to make it possible for their kids to have the whole world as <br/>
their &quot;classroom.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I think it would be interesting to make a list of all the ways that <br/>
unschooled kids (of all ages) get exposed to new ideas, options, information, <br/>
possibilities, or learning opportunities. It would be interesting to people <br/>
new to unschooling who have a hard time imagining how the kids learn anything <br/>
that isn&#39;t in a curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids are exposed to learning opportunities by (here is a <br/>
start......):<br/>
<br/>
seeing parents pursuing their interests, work, or hobbies<br/>
other relatives sharing their interests, work, or hobbies<br/>
neighbors&#39; interests, work, or hobbies<br/>
tradespeople who come to the house<br/>
books from libraries, bookstores, garage sales, other people&#39;s houses<br/>
television and movies<br/>
theatrical events<br/>
family vacations<br/>
houseguests<br/>
housework &lt;G&gt;<br/>
yardwork<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But there is more than one way to limit IMHO.  If a child is kept so <br/>
busy doing the things that mom found, when do they have time to find <br/>
their own?  That&#39;s the question I&#39;m asking . . . not because I need it <br/>
answered for me (I&#39;ve already found the right balance for us) but <br/>
because I know several people that may need to ponder it for <br/>
themselves.<br/>
