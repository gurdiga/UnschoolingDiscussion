<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864555057">For those that want to know what unschooling really is all about, all <br/>
the supposed experts in the world are not going to come up with &quot;a&quot; <br/>
definition.  All those definitions are going to be colored by their <br/>
personal feelings of what it is or by their need to be &quot;the&quot; expert <br/>
with &quot;the&quot; answer.<br/>
<br/>
Read, listen and then take what you need because the true definition <br/>
of unschooling is a life style that doesn&#39;t discriminate against <br/>
children because they aren&#39;t old enough to vote yet, a life style <br/>
that not only allows them a voice but a life style that actively <br/>
listens to their voices.<br/>
<br/>
There is no one correct way to unschool and the experts can stomp up <br/>
and down and be blunt (spell that rude) and authoritarian and badger <br/>
people and try to wear them down by repeating over and over their <br/>
opinion (and it is only an opinion) but it won&#39;t change the <br/>
underlying facts, every child is an individual, all families are made <br/>
up of individuals and thus, there is NO ONE RIGHT WAY.<br/>
<br/>
If there is only one rigid, unflexible definition of unschooling and <br/>
only one right way then that equates to &quot;different dog, same smell&quot; <br/>
and is no different than the public school system where everyone is <br/>
pigeon holed by &quot;the&quot; experts.<br/>
<br/>
I, personally, have never understood how anyone can claim all this <br/>
expert knowledge when they have no finished product to prove their <br/>
theories.  Would you go to a person to help you bake the perfect cake <br/>
if they had never done anything but mix ingredients together but <br/>
never finished the job by baking the cake to see if it would indeed <br/>
come out right?<br/>
<br/>
So, my advise, look to those who are successful and not out tooting <br/>
their own horns.  Look to the owner of this list.  Helen has grown <br/>
children who are successful in life--happy and enjoying their life.<br/>
<br/>
Look to people that will share their own journey with you such as the <br/>
people at Winona Farm.<br/>
<br/>
And, in the final answer, trust yourself as you are the only one that <br/>
knows your own family and their INDIVIDUAL needs.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Tery<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have always felt unschooling wasn&#39;t about the finished product, but<br/>
about a life of real meaning, here and now.  As adults, we can take that<br/>
life for ourselves, make our own choices about whatever we like. <br/>
Unschooling, I think, only offers children what they already deserve. <br/>
Freedom, time to find their own joys, make their own mistakes and pursue<br/>
their own interests.  <br/>
Freedom and joy and fulfillment aren&#39;t things that are only valuable or<br/>
worthwhile at the end of a journey, as the reward for achievement.  They<br/>
are really basic needs.   I see my son happy and shining and loving his<br/>
life and I do feel like an expert.  ( not that I ever claimed to be one<br/>
and can&#39;t remember anyone else doing so either )  Mostly I&#39;m just<br/>
grateful the folks who figured it out before me were willing to share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29671458">My advise was that you listen to yourself as you are the only one who <br/>
knows yourself or your children.  Do you have a problem with doing <br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
As to who I am, I am me.  And I&#39;m terribly wounded that you missed <br/>
the post about my grandson and the TinTin books.  I mean that shows <br/>
that I have a grandson and that I have read more than one book.<br/>
<br/>
No one asked *you* to listen to my advise, so don&#39;t.  It is of little <br/>
import to me whether you do or don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
As to knowing the names of someone&#39;s children, I hardly think that <br/>
makes them a reliable source.  It simply means you know the names of <br/>
their children.<br/>
<br/>
What part of the country do I live in, the West.  How many children <br/>
do I have, 4 living.  What ages are they, 3 are grown and on their <br/>
own and one is 17 and still living at home.<br/>
<br/>
What else would you like to know?  The books I am currently reading?  <br/>
Good heavens, yes, that is an area we must cover. I wouldn&#39;t want you <br/>
to think I had only read one book, well, two since you had missed <br/>
TinTin. One would be on Pakistan, another would be about habitat <br/>
reclaimation and &quot;Pipeline,&quot; a novel about the original oil drilling <br/>
in Alaska which was suppose to be the end all answer to our <br/>
dependence on OPEC oil.<br/>
<br/>
What other things do you need to know, hmmm, well, I&#39;m not a soccer <br/>
mom (don&#39;t care for soccer and wouldn&#39;t own a van on a bet), I think <br/>
keeping up with the Jones is pathetic, I don&#39;t belong to any <br/>
political party because although all of their philosophies have <br/>
something to offer, none of them walk the walk, they just talk and <br/>
talk and talk out both sides of their mouths.  Ahh, and least we <br/>
forget the other big arguing point on all of these lists, religion, I <br/>
don&#39;t belong to any organized group, again, they all have something <br/>
to offer but they generally are all about me, me, me and everyone <br/>
else is wrong.  I found my niche in an earthbound spirituality, no <br/>
phoney rules, no phoneys with their hands out for money.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you have all kinds of answers and they don&#39;t mean a thing to <br/>
you, do they?  You really didn&#39;t want answers, you have already <br/>
chiseled your opinion in stone &quot;you don&#39;t care for Sandra&#39;s posts.&quot;  <br/>
So, out of curiosity, why did you bother asking?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; who post regularly here.  How many do you have?  How old are they?<br/>
&gt; What part of the country do you live in?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do look to Helen when she has time to post.  But what worked for<br/>
&gt; her children may or may not work for mine or yours or the next <br/>
person<br/>
&gt; who reads the post.  I enjoy reading what others have to say too;<br/>
&gt; people who have shared some of their journey with others on this <br/>
list.<br/>
&gt; And again I realize that worked for them and their children may or <br/>
may<br/>
&gt; not work for me. All I know about you is that your name is Tery and <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t care for Sandra&#39;s posts...  Oh, and you&#39;ve read &quot;Lies My<br/>

who &quot;have a passion and vision to keep unschooling growing.&quot;  They <br/>
are radical unschoolers and the farm welcomes visitors for &quot;hours, <br/>
days or weeks.&quot;  I think they also put out a quarterly newsletter.<br/>
<br/>
It is really interesting and they live a completely self-sustained <br/>
existance.  They also known quite a few of the really radical <br/>
unschoolers if one is looking for another perspective on unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-989407844">....&gt; And, in the final answer, trust yourself as you are the only <br/>
one that <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; knows your own family and their INDIVIDUAL needs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tery<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So.... if your &quot;self&quot; is telling you to insist on certain skills your <br/>
children MUST learn, and you enforce some sort of required learning <br/>
on them(because your gut tells you to do so), and you still want to <br/>
call yourself an unschooler, because you don&#39;t require &quot;all that <br/>
other stuff&quot;, it should be perfectly okay to tell new homeschoolers <br/>
and others interested in unschooling, that what you do is <br/>
unschooling, because there is no real definition of it, and you like <br/>
the name?  <br/>
I also disagree with your argument that someone must have a &quot;finished <br/>
product&quot;, before they can talk about the benefits of the unschooling <br/>
lifestyle, and the trust they have in it.  The benefits you can <br/>
clearly see in a child, given freedom and trust, at 10yrs old, is <br/>
just as important and considerable in discussions, as one at 20 yrs. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-446077768">I don&#39;t know you, but I have met Sandra and her kids; she was one of the most<br/>
accomodating people I&#39;ve ever had contact with, offering to put up my family<br/>
when we were in town, and cancel her Christmas shopping to do so, all on<br/>
about 2 hours notice.<br/>
<br/>
But I also listen to the opinions of people with preschoolers, degrees in<br/>
something else entirely, or nothing at all! What!? No credentials!? And I<br/>
*speak* to these people?! Yes.<br/>
<br/>
I also have friends with teens or grown children that I listen to, but many<br/>
of them have made choices that are not for me and my family. Still their kids<br/>
are &quot;done&quot; being kids, and are now young adults. They turned out OK. Should I<br/>
drop my life and copy theirs? No. Not I.<br/>
<br/>
I know nothing about the Winona Farm people other than what I have seen<br/>
posted here. They are no more &quot;valid&quot; to me than any other family that posts.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your advice, though. I&#39;ll keep it in mind.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think ideally following the heart is good advice. But if someone wants to<br/>
allow her children to unfold naturally -- *if* she wants to learn how to<br/>
unschool, and her head is full of musts and shoulds, she often needs help<br/>
identifying what&#39;s getting in her way.<br/>
<br/>
For instance if someone thinks that 3 meals a day is a must, but it&#39;s<br/>
interfering with her life and making her and her family miserable, she might<br/>
find it helpful to realize that people can exist just fine eating in other<br/>
ways. It&#39;s not something that most people will even think to question.<br/>
<br/>
For many of us, it&#39;s difficult to separate what must be done from what we&#39;ve<br/>
been told must be done. The way many of us were raised is *based* on having<br/>
the child trust that what the parent or teacher or other adult says is true.<br/>
(You must do your howework or you can&#39;t learn. You must go to bed early or<br/>
you&#39;ll be tired. You must eat a good breakfast or you&#39;ll run out of energy.)<br/>
<br/>
I love structure and order. For me to have &quot;followed my heart&quot; would have<br/>
meant having my daughter do Calvert. It wouldn&#39;t have led me to unschooling.<br/>
I offer the advice I do (at least on the message boards!) because I know how<br/>
difficult it was for me to learn to identify where my &quot;heart&quot; and what I<br/>
believed was best for her was getting in the way of what my daughter needed.<br/>
So perhaps better unschooling advice is to learn how to listen to your<br/>
*child&#39;s* heart.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully the *Unschooling* list and website is a place to do that. It&#39;s not<br/>
a *follow your heart* list, though ultimately many will find that&#39;s what<br/>
they are doing once they identify all the garbage that was getting in the<br/>
way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077504211">I think this is a great point, Joyce. I know on some of the Attachment Parenting<br/>
lists they say one should &quot;follow their instincts.&quot; My mental reply is always,<br/>
&quot;In my family, we would never have been allowed to have instincts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I was a very young mom, 20 years ago, I followed what I truly thought was<br/>
best--put the baby in the crib to cry because nothing I could do seemed to help.<br/>
Was this my instincts? It was what I had at the time. Do I wish someone could<br/>
have told me it&#39;s not the only way--that I could do things differently, as I&#39;d<br/>
never seen or heard of them being done? Yes. I think both the baby and I would<br/>
have profited immensely from that.<br/>
<br/>
So I think you can&#39;t listen only to yourself, because you don&#39;t know what you<br/>
don&#39;t know.<br/>
