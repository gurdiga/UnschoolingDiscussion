&lt;&lt; So each genuine Christian knows in her/his <br/>
heart that s/he has encountered the risen Jesus and has been forgiven <br/>
from all wrongdoing forever. &gt;&gt;<br/>

That&#39;s fine - but that person is not a Jew.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Regarding Jews who have converted to Christianity, I think they know, <br/>
better than anyone, whether they have a new relationship with God.  <br/>
It seems to me that those who study Judaism exclusively, however <br/>
intensely, do not have the experience to criticize the converts. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To say someone is not Jewish is not criticizing them. I know some Jews for <br/>
Jesus and they tell people they are Jewish - but they&#39;re not. I don&#39;t correct <br/>
them, nor do I really care what their religious beliefs are, but if I had to, <br/>
I would say they are not Jews. It&#39;s just like people who say they are <br/>
unschoolers, except for math. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This point, that Jews who have converted to Christianity are <br/>
not &quot;Jews&quot;, is well taken.  Their religious beliefs now come from <br/>
Christianity, not Judaism.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone was intending to state that a person can embrace <br/>
Judaism and Christianity all at the same time.  I believe the <br/>
misunderstanding comes from the possible definitions of Jew:  <br/>
religious and ethnic.  An ethnic Jew (genetically speaking, born of a <br/>
ethnically Jewish mother) who has converted to Christianity is still <br/>
an ethnic Jew, right?<br/>
<br/>
So my understanding of the phrases &quot;converted Jew&quot; or &quot;completed Jew&quot; <br/>
is that they refer to ethnic Jews who are born-again Christians (from <br/>
a religious standpoint).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what Jews believe about being chosen, but Christians <br/>
believe that ethnic Jews are a race that was/is chosen by God <br/>
(Deuteronomy 7:6).  We also believe that when some Jews decided not <br/>
to follow him or to believe that Jesus is the messiah, he added <br/>
Christian believers to his chosen people (I Peter 2:9-10 and <br/>
others).  This is why Christians have (or should have) high respect <br/>
for the traditions of Judaism.<br/>
