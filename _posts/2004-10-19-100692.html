<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124808411">We are dealing with a situation that is difficult especially in light of our newer way of thinking about parenting.  We have found our dog a new home.  Here is the story.  A few months back, dh called me while I was working to say he found the perfect dog.  We had planned to look around for a while, and find one that was a puppy that would grow into a medium sized dog.  I was put in the position to agree, since he had already pretty much told our son who is 5, that they would get her, I was working and couldn&#39;t really discuss it well.  She turned out to be a much older, larger and completely out of control dog.  She chews up everything in sight and has even chewed up the outside of our house.  She has been living in the backyard ever since.  She is very rough with Ben and has even caused him to fall from his play fort and get 8 stitches on his chin.  She nips him, in play, but it hurts and he hardly ever played with her or even remembered that she was there.  She knocks him down and is just too rough.  A sweet dog, just very rambunctious for a kid that is a bit timid around large animals.  They just didn&#39;t click.  <br/>
<br/>
Besides the poor dog was so lonely being outside all of the time.  She had complete access to my dh&#39;s air conditioned gameroom/shed, it wasn&#39;t cruel, just not great for her.  We went out of town this weekend and a friend took care of her.  They asked if they could keep her.  We brought her home, Ben had been concerned that she wouldn&#39;t come back.  So, I wanted to make sure she did.  Dh and I decided that we were not providing a good home for her and that it would be best for everyone if she went to live with our friends.  Ben can visit anytime, he and dh go over there often.  He is now heartbroken and has been crying all day.  I feel awful and so does dh.  But, honestly, he hardly ever paid attention to her.  We talked about getting a dog that fit our family better and that we found a family that she fit better in.   <br/>
<br/>
How do you balance letting your child make choices with doing what is best for the family or the pet?  He is just saying things that really break my heart &quot;you shouldn&#39;t give away a child&#39;s dog, that&#39;s not right.  she is part of our family and you are just breaking the rules and giving her away.  this is the worst day of my young life and you did this to me &quot;  I&#39;m just trying to listen and comfort him and let him feel sad and angry at us.  He feels everything very deeply.  I feel awful.  ,He was not comfortable with her and even went out to say good bye and she knocked him down and jumped all over him and scratched him up.  The main thing is that we just weren&#39;t giving her a good home, adequate, but not good enough.  What would you all have done in this situation?  We will probably wait a while to get the puppy, he says he doesn&#39;t want one right now.<br/>

First of all Laura, {{Hugs}}. It is hard to make a decision like this. If it had been me, I would <br/>
have done the same, however.<br/>
<br/>
There is a difference between honoring a child&#39;s choices and being able to lead a life that <br/>
feels sane for everyone. If there is a stress that is causing you to be unable to function at a <br/>
level that is good for the whole family, then something needs to be done. And that <br/>
something isn&#39;t always perfectly comfortable for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m just trying to listen and comfort him and let him feel sad and angry at us.  He feels <br/>
 </span></blockquote>everything very deeply.  I feel awful.<br/>
<br/>
His expression of those feelings at his young age shows that you all talk about feelings a <br/>
lot. Those ideas are pretty articulate for a 5 year old. (Though I can imagine my youngest <br/>
having had the language for that kind of thought.)<br/>
<br/>
It is good to listen to him. It is also good for him to hear you. It sounds like you&#39;ve given <br/>
him space to feel. Now I&#39;d ask him to hear how it was for you with this dog.<br/>
<br/>

want one right now.<br/>
<br/>
One thing you don&#39;t need to do is to keep justifying why you let the dog go to another <br/>
family. If you do that, you will need to make the dog worse than she was and your son&#39;s <br/>
feelings less important than they are. <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s true is that you and your son are at cross-purposes with reference to the dog. At <br/>
this stage of life, the responsibility for dog care is mostly on you. So you made a choice <br/>
based on what you can handle.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s hard for a little guy to grasp. So hugs for him are in order and some tea for you to <br/>
console yourself.<br/>

I agree, which is why we tried a few times at first.  But, I honestly can say I didn&#39;t try all that hard after my son got the stitches.  She seemed fairly happy out back, for the most part, but I know she could have it better.  We didn&#39;t do our best, I&#39;m glad we found someone who could.  I want to wait a while before we try again, to make sure we do this right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---I wouldn&#39;t get another dog until I learned about dog behavior and  committed <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t, one of the problems was that we were not ready for this dog, she came as an impulse from dh.  He won&#39;t make that mistake again.  I didn&#39;t even get to go and help them pick out our dog.  They were supposed to browse, not buy.  Believe me, he has learned that it needs to be a family decision.  I want to learn to properly train a puppy, maybe have Ben take it to puppy classes.  This dog was a rescue from the HS and dh is insisting we do that again.  She was almost a year old and very wild.  I really want to go with the puppy like someone suggested.  I&#39;m going to really research, just like I thought we were going to last time.  Live and learn.  I&#39;m glad it worked out okay for her.  Dh went by there and she seems happy.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the title, I will look for it.  Any recommendations on breeds?  We want a medium sized dog.  Not purebred, mixed.  Dh still wants a pound puppy. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m looking into this.  I&#39;ve heard it is good, but it sounds awful leaving them in there so much. But, I think the puppy having his own space would be a plus especially with kids around.  And, not having to constantly keep on eye on him.  We go on lots of outings, so that would be hard.<br/>
<br/>
Ben was better today and even said he understands a little better why we had to find her a new home.  I was so worried we were scarring him for life.  He can really turn a phrase that just tears your heart and yes, he did say &quot;this is the worst day of my young life&quot;.  He also said, &quot;my heart is breaking into a million and a half pieces.  I will never get over this.&quot;  He is very dramatic.  Today, he barely mentioned her.   I&#39;m sure he needed a break from his feelings today.   His imaginary friend, Clocky made an apperance today, so that means he is having a hard time.  Clocky only comes around now when he&#39;s feeling sad or nervous.  He showed up at gymnastics and pushed him off the balance beam.  Ben used to have up to ten imaginary friends, quite a menagerie.<br/>
<br/>
He also mentioned wanting a bunny.  So, we might get a bunny.  I always wanted a bunny and never got one.  So, a bunny might be just fine.    <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all of your input and advice.  It was very helpful.  We did the right thing, I know.  But, it was hard hurting him so much.  He seemed so upset.  He does feel things so deeply and almost always to the extreme.  Complete joy, utter sadness, blinding anger, and he so sweet and sentimental, yet a rough and tumble wild boy.    We do talk a lot about feelings and he really has learned to express himself well.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would recommend contacting a rescue group in your area, that has <br/>
their pups in foster homes. That way the dog is more likely to get <br/>
socialization, training, etc, and the foster may have a better idea <br/>
of the temperment of the dog. <br/>
<br/>
It also depends what your local &quot;pound&quot; or humane society is like, <br/>
and how extensive an adoption program they have. Some shelters do a <br/>
thorough evaluation of the dogs, and know what type of home would <br/>
best suit them (and would not place a big, untrained, exuberant dog <br/>
in a home with a young child, unless the home was willing/able to do <br/>
a ton of training)...i&#39;ve rescued alot of dogs (well, like a dozen)<br/>
and have had positive and negative experiences. We adopted what we <br/>
thought was a cute, small, shaggy mixed breed older dog from the <br/>
local SPCA when we lived in cincy, and before i even got him home, he <br/>
had bit me. He bit seamus. He would not let me pick him up without <br/>
trying to bite. (Other than that he was a nice little dog.)He would <br/>
not have been safe around toddlers at all. I took him to the vet, who <br/>
said he was ok, took him to a behaviorist. I had to leave him with <br/>
seamus&#39; grandmother when we moved out of state, and she found out he <br/>
had end stage cancer throughout his body(i personally believe he had <br/>
it when we adopted him). A couple thousand dollars later he was <br/>
finally put to sleep on the oncologist&#39;s recommendation. I still love <br/>
that dog, but it made me realize that i need to be alot more cautious <br/>
about going to a shelter and picking out a dog without it being temp <br/>
tested.  I&#39;ve had really good experiences too, and have had several <br/>
foster dalmatians and no problems with them whatsoever. <br/>
<br/>
You might want to check out <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.petfinder.com">http://www.petfinder.com</a> and browse the <br/>
dogs listed in your state. There should be several shelters and <br/>
rescue groups listed for your area as well. <br/>
<br/>
I think you handled the transition to a new home well....i will never <br/>
forget coming home one day as a child, and my new puppy was simply <br/>
gone. He was too much for my mom, i understand now, but i didnt even <br/>
get to say goodbye. <br/>

though their claws aren&#39;t sharp like cats, their muscles are powerful and<br/>
they can scratch pretty hard.<br/>
<br/>
Feeding them is more than just giving them commercial rabbit food and<br/>
carrots (which actually aren&#39;t good for them). They&#39;re prone to deadly<br/>
intestinal problems if they aren&#39;t getting the right stuff.<br/>
<br/>
And from the bunnies my daughter and I have dealt with at the shelter<br/>
(they&#39;re the 3rd most common shelter animal), there are neat bunnies and<br/>
there are filthy bunnies.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who adore them, but we haven&#39;t gotten past the negatives of<br/>
cleaning up after them to figure out what it is about them that people like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010745320">Crate training:  <br/>
<br/>
The *Super Puppy* book tells you how to do that and talks about WHY <br/>
the dogs LIKE to be crate trained (their den instincts).  <br/>
<br/>
When we *crate trained* our corgi, we lived in a REALLY small home <br/>
and we kept his den in a closet.  When he was tired and wanted to <br/>
sleep for the night, he&#39;d go over to the closet and just STARE at it, <br/>
*asking* to go to bed!  He didn&#39;t realize that he could just *flop* <br/>
down anywhere and sleep!  To him, his den was his *room*, his space, <br/>
and that&#39;s where he felt safe and could rest.<br/>

<br/>
Jmho: Do NOT get a bunny. They are not friendly, they scratch and my heart broke <br/>
watching ours grow fat in a cage. If you let them out in the house, they race around, chew <br/>
the carpet and pee. Unless you have a hutch outside year round and remember to feed her <br/>
and keep her warm in winter, you will find out that bunnies are cute to look at but not very <br/>
responsive to humans.<br/>
<br/>
Our best &quot;pre-dog&quot; pets were rats. And truly, they are the friendliest, smartest, sweetest <br/>
rodents of the entire lot. If you can get over their tails, they make *wonderful* pets for <br/>
children. We loved running ours through mazes. Get two together (same sex) so they have <br/>
each other to curl up on. And they are inexpensive to buy and keep.<br/>
<br/>
We do own a rescue dog and got to meet him first. It was love at first sight and a great <br/>
match. It took us a few tries to find our dog (rat terrier, chihua hua mix) and we&#39;re hooked.<br/>

was so cool and playful.  Every once in a while (while vacuuming or <br/>
moving around furniture) we&#39;d find one of his little nests where he had <br/>
hid sticks of chewing gum, buttons, earrings, just little things.  It <br/>
was funny to wonder what he was thinking was so awesome about an object <br/>
that he just *had* to have it for himself.  LOL<br/>

DH isn&#39;t sold on the pet rat idea, but I&#39;m working on him.  ;)<br/>

&lt;&lt; For example...Celyn doesn&#39;t want to take her<br/>

anti-epileptics. She doesn&#39;t like the tatse. Yet each<br/>

spasm causes further brain damage and she is too young<br/>

to be so brain damaged.<br/>
<br/>
But is it moral? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think so.<br/>
Are there other flavors or media you could get the pharmacy to get for you?<br/>
<br/>
Even with other adults, sometimes a friend or spouse presses someone to do <br/>
something they don&#39;t want to do, like go to the emergency room or try to stop <br/>
drinking.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s immoral.<br/>

My kids could always *taste* medicine even when it&#39;s *masked*.  <br/>
<br/>
Sam always gets such a bad cough after a cold that he can&#39;t sleep at <br/>
night, but he hates cough medicine...so we started making *cough <br/>
medicine cocktails* with Sprite.  It&#39;s not great tasting, but helps <br/>
him get it down, rather than the gagging and vomiting that happens if <br/>
he tries to take the medicine straight.  :-/<br/>
