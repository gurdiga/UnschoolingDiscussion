<div id="ygrps-yiv-326075066">I got a Euro!  It&#39;s a Euro 2 coin.  What is it called, please?  Some Brit or <br/>
European know?  A two-Euro? <br/>
<br/>
It looks like a Canadian toony, more or less.<br/>
<br/>
And...<br/>
I found my little stash of Canadian quarters yesterday.  They had been lost <br/>
for months.  What&#39;s the name of the series of Canadian quarters with different <br/>
art on the backs?  I have a dozen or so.  Holly&#39;s willing to let Brenda and <br/>
Tim have most of them when they visit, but she has a few favorites she wants to <br/>
keep.  I didn&#39;t know the name of the series, though, when I had company last <br/>
night and chucked those and the Euro and the Peruvian set out on the table!<br/>

<br/>
Saturday we had a large party for a child. Several adults had Lottery <br/>
scratchers for their own birthdays. My mom got a coin out of a drawer in my kitchen. <br/>
She didn&#39;t have her glasses on since she had been swimming and asked me to <br/>
read her card when she scratched. While I was reading her card, she got all <br/>
excited about that Million $ nickel out there and thought I should examine the <br/>
nickel she was using since even without her reading glasses she knew it was <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
After handing me the nickel, I began to laugh upon inspection. It was a token <br/>
from Scandia (the local miniature golf/amusement park)!!! So much for winning <br/>
the lottery or finding the million $ nickel.LOL<br/>
<br/>
