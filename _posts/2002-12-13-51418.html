<div id="ygrps-yiv-663626760">This list seems to be the place to get expert advice on this topic<br/>
lately. Rain broke two bones in her arm today, falling off a scooter<br/>
after one of her clogs came off her feet and got under a wheel. I wasn&#39;t<br/>
there, although I arrived to pick her up a few minutes after it happened.<br/>
<br/>
It was a miserable afternoon in the ER, although she doesn&#39;t remember<br/>
them setting the fracture because she was on Versed, and they were pretty<br/>
good about painkillers there. Now she&#39;s home and on Tylenol 3, which<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to be doing much for her. She took 50 mg of benedryl a<br/>
couple of years ago after three bee stings and didn&#39;t fall asleep, so I&#39;m<br/>
thinking she has a pretty high tolerance to stuff. I gave her more than<br/>
they said to and she finally fell asleep...<br/>
<br/>
They put something on her arm that&#39;s not a real cast, and she has to go<br/>
in next week for that part. The orthopedic surgeon said that they rarely<br/>
put casts on in emergency rooms now because after the swelling goes down<br/>
they don&#39;t fit tightly enough. We don&#39;t have any insurance, which sucks.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gone around with her one those clogs for over a year now. I hate<br/>
&#39;em, and every time she wears them to go bike riding or stilting or<br/>
scootering I try to get her to change to a sneaker type shoe, and she<br/>
does... but this was at a friend&#39;s house, and a whole gruop of kids were<br/>
messing around outside, and she&#39;s never very careful and she&#39;s frequently<br/>
getting hurt. If there&#39;s a group of kids and one gets stung by a bee or<br/>
falls out of a boat or falls down a cliff, it&#39;s her... not because she&#39;s<br/>
clumsy, but because she&#39;s gung-ho on doing everything and not especially<br/>
careful. She doesn&#39;t generally mind bumps and bruises... She started<br/>
walking a day or two after she turned 8 months old, and it was running,<br/>
not walking, and she wasn&#39;t very good at it to start off and I wish she&#39;d<br/>
waited a few months.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have not said anything to her about wearing the clogs and<br/>
scootering, but I can&#39;t help thinking it. I know she doesn&#39;t need me to<br/>
say I told you so, but I wish I could have convinced her that this was a<br/>
bad idea before this happened. I did try... and I know I need to just let<br/>
it go, but I had to say it to someone.<br/>
<br/>
So, if anyone with broken bones (current or past) has any ideas on how to<br/>
help her feel better, or help her manage live one-armed, or medications I<br/>
should ask for (I have fioricet for my migaines, which I&#39;m tempted to<br/>
give her next time) I&#39;d love to hear them. <br/>
<br/>
My mom died a year and a day ago, in a hospital with an IV and monitors<br/>
and oxygen prongs in her nose... and Rain and I were both a little<br/>
freaked out today when she had all the same stuff (when they reduced the<br/>
fracture they had to get her really drugged out - the radius was broken<br/>
and also out of place, the ulna was just broken). She mentioned that it<br/>
was like grandma... and I knew she wasn&#39;t going to die but it was scary<br/>
just the same. <br/>
<br/>
We had planned to go visit another friend this afternoon, and all during<br/>
the hours at the ER she told people she was going to her friend Hannah&#39;s<br/>
house next, whenever they talked about her going home soon. And we did<br/>
stop at Hannah&#39;s, although she was so drugged she fell asleep sitting on<br/>
their couch and we left after 10 minutes or so... but she did it. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s been quite a day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258493949">Sorry for your hard day,  and for Rain.  My 8dd, also loves her clogs and she does all the activities with them too.   I&#39;ll maybe tell her about this.<br/>

I don&#39;t have advice on pain relievers, but I&#39;m sure there will be others here that can help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744417680">Dar -<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how sorry I am to hear about Rain&#39;s broken arm.<br/>
<br/>
About the pain.  If the medication isn&#39;t working, call and ask for something <br/>
else.  Don&#39;t wait.  I put up with morphine for way too long.  Not all <br/>
medication works for everyone.  The only thing morphine did for me was make <br/>
me loopy and vomit.  Keep trying different meds until you discover one that <br/>
works.<br/>
<br/>
About the clogs.  I am a clog freak now.  I fell down the stairs wearing <br/>
them.  Every time I see a friend wearing them, I yell at them.  While you can <br/>
train yourself to grip your toes for better traction, they are still <br/>
dangerous.  I&#39;m very opinionated about it.<br/>
<br/>
About the insurance.  I hope you didn&#39;t need surgery, doesn&#39;t&#39; sound like it <br/>
if you came home already.  My three days in the hospital were $18,000.  No <br/>
idea what the surgery cost.  Yikes.  But we have complete coverage.  Work out <br/>
a payment plan.<br/>
<br/>
About your Mom.  We had the same problem with the kids as my father in law <br/>
died last April.  They were afraid to visit me because of that, afraid I was <br/>
going to die.  My three year old said, happily, as she walked in &quot;You died <br/>
yesterday Mama, but you are ok now.&quot;  Last night my four year old drew <br/>
pictures of his Grandpa&#39;s hospital room, with Grandpa in the bed and my <br/>
hospital room with me in the bed.  The children will learn that not all <br/>
people will die in the hospital.  But it&#39;s still scary.  My own father <br/>
freaked when he walked into the ER and saw me on heart monitors.  My Mom had <br/>
heart surgery this summer.  <br/>
<br/>
I think she&#39;ll learn how to adapt to one armedness better than an adult <br/>
would.  And she&#39;ll probably listen to her own body better than adults would, <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
It really sucks for both of you.  I hope her time in the cast is limited.  I <br/>
had two casts too because of the swelling.  And one full week after the <br/>
second one was removed, my blister wounds (from swelling) are still not <br/>
healed.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to you both.<br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth<br/>

too (like no insurance - OUCH).<br/>
Hope you can both help each other through this, and that she feels better<br/>
soon.<br/>
I think I would at least remind her next time she wears clogs to do any<br/>
physical activity that she may want to change her shoes. OR, maybe she&#39;ll<br/>
just do it herself from now on. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705181105">I&#39;ve never had a broken arm.  Keith has, but he&#39;s Mr. Stoic.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the hardest things, I&#39;ve heard, is butt-wiping, and so if that&#39;s not <br/>
going well, there is some stuff called Balneol, at Walgreen&#39;s, and it&#39;s a <br/>
little plastic bottle of stuff to use if that area&#39;s irritated.   You use <br/>
just a tiny bit, on a cotton ball, or on toilet paper (though you&#39;re more <br/>
likely to &quot;miss&quot; or lose it that way), and it VERY gently cleans the area.  <br/>
Use that after paper wiping, or once a day to be sure.    If she can&#39;t stand <br/>
having someone help her, maybeyou could just load a cotton ball and leave it <br/>
and she can use that last.<br/>
<br/>
If you tell the doctor she&#39;s in pain, he should find something to give her.   <br/>
<br/>
For distraction, I always recommend videos.  When I was first home with that <br/>
leg hurting, sometimes suddenly, sometimes constantly, a movie would make two <br/>
hours pass.  Or three and a half, in the case of the extended Fellowship of <br/>
the Ring DVD.<br/>
<br/>
I broke my leg the year before I had Kirby and we didn&#39;t have insurance.    We<br/>
 had had,  until Keith graduated from UNM in May.  I broke it in July, before <br/>
he got a job.  We made $50 payments until it was paid off.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m altogether sorry to hear about it happening.  Clogs...   I doubt you&#39;ll <br/>
have to reason with her in future about how sneakers are safer.  She&#39;ll <br/>
probably remind all her friends.<br/>

broken bones and over 300 stitches, most of them as a kid and young <br/>
teen. Don&#39;t expect it to end any time soon. When I was old enough to <br/>
outgrow scooters, I took up things like motorcycles and skydiving. I <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep, you&#39;re right on the money with that one. Wish I had a penny for <br/>
every time my parents told me I really should be wearing shoes. And <br/>
yet I still don&#39;t, though I&#39;ve had pieces of glass, large needles, <br/>
and a big sharp hunk of metal removed from my feet at various times. <br/>
You think I&#39;d learn, but I don&#39;t, and I still love to go barefoot. <br/>
Stepped on a tack the other day, too. Dang, that hurt ;-)<br/>
I always tell people this story when they still believe that kids <br/>
will learn from &quot;natural consequences&quot;. Some of us never do! But vent <br/>
away here all you want. I&#39;m sure my folks sometimes just didn&#39;t know <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d suggest Homeopathic Arnica for any tissue bruising that occurred <br/>
around the break. Also, if she has to take a shower with a cast on, <br/>
never, NEVER use a breadbag unless you&#39;ve emptied the crumbs out of <br/>
it first! Learned that one the hard way, LOL. Had 3 weeks left with <br/>
those crumbs in my cast, and boy that itched!<br/>
<br/>
Also, try (if you can) not to let her push the limits when she has <br/>
the cast on. I did all kinds of things I shouldn&#39;t have done with my <br/>
cast on when I dislocated my wrist, and it never did heal properly. <br/>
Broken bones probably set a little bit better than a dislocation, but <br/>
still she should try to take it easy. Tell her to take it easy from <br/>
someone who has BTDT. After that, I learned, and the rest of mine set <br/>
up better.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like it! Many hugs to you both. And speedy healing to her!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004640440">We found that a really large size rubber kitchen glove works great for covering an arm cast (when MY child hit a rock on her scooter and broke her wrist and thumb)  Just buy the largest size and use medical tape to seal it around the arm above the cast!<br/>

I woke up this a.m. thinking about Rain.   <br/>

How are things going?    Did you find something to help the pain?<br/>

Hope all is well,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for asking. She&#39;s doing much better now, it was really just the<br/>
first 24 hours that were so painful. She&#39;s taking one or two tylenol 3 a<br/>
day and they seem to be enough, she&#39;s bopping around like her usual<br/>
.bouncy self.  She got her cast on Monday, very  purple, so she&#39;s spent<br/>
the last two days collecting signatures. A note to anyone who ever gets a<br/>
dark colored cast - the only pen that shows up is a silver sharpie, we<br/>
carry them with us...<br/>
<br/>
The power has been on and off but we&#39;ve now had 24 continuous hours of<br/>
electricity and I&#39;m starting to feel, if not caught up, then at least<br/>
less behind. Of course, we&#39;re leaving tomorrow to spend a week in Tucson<br/>
with my family, including the sister I&#39;m feuding with, and we&#39;ll get to<br/>
meet my dad&#39;s new girlfriend, who just happens to be my sister&#39;s<br/>
boyfriend&#39;s mother...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I acquired a third-hand palm pilot from a friend and we&#39;ve been<br/>
having a lot of fun with it - Rain discovered all of the games and has<br/>
been mastering them, and I&#39;ve been making lists that I then never look at<br/>
(okay, I play the games too). When the power was out, the palm was our<br/>
only operational timepiece...<br/>
<br/>
Rain is getting a GBA from my dad for Christmas (and I&#39;m getting a<br/>
laptop... and we got him a plastic banana slug, among other things) and<br/>
she&#39;s been so happy with the palm games, I imagine she&#39;ll love it. I just<br/>
found some old emails I&#39;d found and saved with game recommendations,<br/>
too... this is such a darn useful list.<br/>
<br/>
Dar, off to read email...</div>
