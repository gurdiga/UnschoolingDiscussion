We&#39;re planning on coming.  I thought if it wasn&#39;t going to work out <br/>
for us all to come, I&#39;d come by myself, but then I thought, I don&#39;t <br/>
think they would want me without Bob.  LOL<br/>
We&#39;ll all be there.<br/>

We would have been delighted to have you alone, but I have to tell you I &gt;AM&lt; <br/>
glad Bob is coming.<br/>
<br/>
Bob was such an inspiration to my son Julian with music. He gave Julian that <br/>
funky capo for his guitar, and spoke to him in really cool ways about playing <br/>
and music. I&#39;ll pass along that he&#39;ll be there. Julian will be very happy.<br/>

Isn&#39;t Bob the Spongebob singer-guy I heard so much about???  I told the kids <br/>
that story and now that we&#39;ve committed to going to the conference, they&#39;ve <br/>
been practicing!!  All the way home (340 miles) we sang that song in different <br/>
styles and voices!  See, he inspires people he hasn&#39;t even met yet!  <br/>
<br/>
{{{{{Joanna}}}}} Thanks for the penny story, I have one similar about my <br/>
hubby.  My best friend&#39;s daughter, 14, (my practice child &lt;g&gt;) tells me regularly <br/>
that when she finds a penny with the head up, she can hear Mitch&#39;s voice <br/>
&quot;heads up!&quot;  I&#39;ll be paying closer attention now :)  <br/>
