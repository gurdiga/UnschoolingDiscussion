<div id="ygrps-yiv-769659051">I have a problem.  I am divorced...and remarried.  Well...my ex <br/>
usually doesn&#39;t have any interest in my 5 yr. olds schooling, but <br/>
loves to find something to fight with me about.  I told him that I <br/>
am &quot;relaxed homeschooling&quot; which is where I am at at this point.  I <br/>
haven&#39;t totally started unschooling yet, for different reasons...but <br/>
a big one being that I am afraid that my ex husband will end up doing <br/>
something that will force my son into public school at worst...or to <br/>
be rigid with homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
I am going to be part of a NAPS in our area.  I&#39;ve told my ex that I <br/>
teach him the basics...we work on phonics and math, but that I let <br/>
him go with HIS interests in most of the other areas. I AM keeping <br/>
track of all he things he does on his own during the week...and it is <br/>
clear by looking at all he&#39;s done that he is progressing really great!<br/>
<br/>
I just wondered if any of you had any tips as to how I can argue my <br/>
case with my ex.  My son is just SO healthy all the way around and my <br/>
ex cannot argue that...but...I am afraid he will fight me on it just <br/>
to try to get a little control.  I appreciate any suggestions from <br/>
any of you!  Thank you so much!  :-)  Bridget</div>

<br/>
How much child support does he pay?<br/>
<br/>
If he pays a lot, just keep saying you&#39;re homeschooling and don&#39;t give him <br/>
details.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s not paying much, tell him you&#39;re not willing to compromise your <br/>
well-researched beliefs just to make him feel better while he&#39;s off doing <br/>
whatever he does.<br/>
<br/>
If he pays no child support, tell him to blow it out his ass.<br/>
<br/>
That might not be much help, but it&#39;s heartfelt. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it is very difficult to be divorced and have a new husband and raise a<br/>
young child. Lots of issues there and you have my total sympathy. It usually<br/>
takes a while for emotions to settle down, but the sooner it happens the<br/>
better for any children involved so working toward that goal is important.<br/>
Maybe he likes to get you to fight with him because it shows him that he still<br/>
affects you?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At age five you have quite a lot of leeway in teaching. In kindergarten they<br/>
are working on letter recognition/basic one to one correspondence/ small and<br/>
large motor control. Maybe just learning some &quot;educationese&quot; you can talk<br/>
about with your ex when he asks will calm his fears. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That sounds very positive. What all the charter schools here seem to do is<br/>
mutter about following the Core Knowledge Series. You might want to take a<br/>
look at the Kindergarten and the First Grade volumes just to get an idea of<br/>
what that means. You can even show the books to your ex. ;) That doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
you have to follow them, just that you will be educating yourself on what<br/>
other people say when they say that *they* are following them. It might give<br/>
you a bit of peace of mind to know how some people feel comfortable with a<br/>
guideline like that, while you are able to find resources and support your own<br/>
child&#39;s learning without that crutch. Another thing you can do is if they<br/>
print out a list of books you&#39;ve borrowed from the library, you might keep the<br/>
lists to show your ex or just remind yourself all the subjects you&#39;ve<br/>
explored.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s still so young. Try to really listen to your ex&#39;s concerns and make a<br/>
real effort to hear the words and not react to them, at least to him in<br/>
person, with strong emotion. This can be difficult with ex&#39;s but as some folks<br/>
around here have said at times, using a mental picture, maybe of your ex as he<br/>
was as a child, instead of as a demanding adult, might help. Find out the<br/>
areas that he is concerned about and make an effort to calm *his* fears. He<br/>
does have a right to be concerned about his son&#39;s education. I don&#39;t think it<br/>
is dishonest not to actively bring in the concept of &quot;un&quot; schooling at this<br/>
point, not with a five year old. Who knows where you will be next year or the<br/>
year after that? Right now just work on today and keep the topic current<br/>
rather than inviting argument. Think of this time as the time you and your ex<br/>
will be building a base of communication for the coming years as partners in<br/>
raising your son. Even if the raising has been a bit one sided, the better the<br/>
communication between you two, the better it will be for your son.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236836074">What&#39;s the compulsory school age in your state?<br/>
In Montana it&#39;s 7 years old.   We silenced  friends and relatives and<br/>
grandparents early on with the fact that he wasn&#39;t legally required to<br/>
&quot;do&quot; school for two more years.   By then most couldn&#39;t find a reason to<br/>
question what he was learning.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087977011">If you think he can be reasoned with at all, I would print up some info and <br/>
stats to give your ex to read. The just try talking about what you do with <br/>
your child and how he learns. Small steps and don&#39;t get upset about it but <br/>
be convicted and concerned enough so he sees you do care and watch closely <br/>
what and how he learns. Even if you don&#39;t do school at home, I would make it <br/>
sound more like you do for the moment. At least until he gets more receptive <br/>
to the idea.<br/>
<br/>
It would also help if you found out a little about the court system there <br/>
and how receptive they are to it. See if you can find out about judges <br/>
there. Word of mouth works great for this. You can get a good idea of what <br/>
would happen if you had to go to court for this if your ex decided on it. <br/>
Then you can keep and put together records to have in case that happens. I <br/>
would say make stuff up if you have to. Better to be safe then sorry.<br/>
