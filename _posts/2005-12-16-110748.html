Apparently you could use the previous versions like a VCR but not the  <br/>
newer models. There isn&#39;t a way to tell it to record at a particular  <br/>
time and date (and no way to tell it what the current time and date  <br/>
is.) From what they&#39;re saying it looks like you can&#39;t even press  <br/>
record on a program that&#39;s on though you can pause and rewind live TV.<br/>
<br/>
There are DVR recorders which act like VCRs so you can set those to  <br/>
record manually. Consumer Reports did a report on them this year.  <br/>
Might have been in the past few months.<br/>
<br/>
Is the subscription expensive in your area? In our area with DirectTV  <br/>
satellite (which is cheaper than cable) it&#39;s only $5/mo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-902539454">Nope, you can&#39;t.  But you can use it with any service (cable,  <br/>
satellite, antenna).  However...it is *so* worth the money to us!!!   <br/>
Also, if you get their newsletter they do have some great offers on  <br/>
refurbished tivos.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any other questions about Tivo, I&#39;d be glad to answer  <br/>
them.  We&#39;ve had them for 6 years now and don&#39;t know what we&#39;d do  <br/>
without it.  We even take it to the beach on vacation!!!<br/>
