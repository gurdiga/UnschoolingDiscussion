My first born was born in Rabat and I lived there with my dh for <br/>
four years. My kids love it when we eat tagine so they can use <br/>
their fingers with impunity.<br/>
<br/>
And Moroccans used to say that using steel (forks) ruined the <br/>
flavor of the foods and it also cooled the food down too quickly. <br/>
Fingers preserve flavor and heat! :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oooh -- I&#39;ve been collecting (vegetarian) tagine from online sources. <br/>
 If you have any great ones I&#39;d really appreciate you passing it on to <br/>
me.  I&#39;m eyeing a tagine by Le Creuset over at Amazon.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an awesome Ethiopian restaurant near us and the whole family <br/>
loves the food there.  Best part about it (besides the great food) is <br/>
using soft, flat, spongy bread to pick up the food instead of forks. <br/>
 I&#39;m in my element!  :)<br/>

I have a bread machine that I use to do the first kneading, because I have a <br/>
hard time on long projects.  I get bored and distracted.  But if I just come <br/>
in and do the last kneading, forming and put in pans to rise part after the <br/>
machine beeps, that&#39;s about my speed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve wondered seriously, though, whether the kneading by hand from the <br/>
beginning might be an important part of making the bread be &quot;right&quot; and good.  The <br/>
warmth of human hands to get the yeast going, the positive human energy, maybe <br/>
the salt off people&#39;s skin, maybe who knows what off skin that we don&#39;t even <br/>
know, that has for thousands of years made bread good and real?<br/>

<br/>
When we lived in Morocco, I did make our own bread. They mix <br/>
the ingredients &quot;backwards.&quot; They start with the dry and use cake <br/>
yeast. They don&#39;t measure anything. It&#39;s all by &quot;touch.&quot; You slowly <br/>
add warm water from a tea kettle as you knead the dough. I loved <br/>
the squish, squish of the flour as the water would soak into the <br/>
flour. It was like playing! Once the proper texture was achieved <br/>
(only known by experience), it was shaped into circular loaves <br/>
and left to rest on a bread board with a tea towel over it. The <br/>
hands-on experience was everything in bread making.<br/>
<br/>
I would then carry this board to the local ferhran (public oven) <br/>
and there it would be baked in a wood burning oven with dozens <br/>
of other loaves. You could smell the bread baking down the <br/>
street.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the morning, I&#39;d return to pick up the two loaves.<br/>
<br/>
Such memories. I&#39;ll bet if you could walk in the sweet sunshine <br/>
of Morocco to a public oven, you&#39;d enjoy bread making more. I <br/>
know I did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065294814">I have thought about this too.  I have a bread book called The Tassajahara Bread Book by Edward Brown.  In his intro. to the 1995 edition that I have he writes,<br/>
 <br/>
 &quot;Someone told me recently that learning how to bake bread from my book was like regaining his life from corporate America.  &quot;A rite of passage&quot; he said,... &quot;an initiation&quot;, a reconnection with the earth, our roots, our common heritage...Please carry on the work of feeding, the work of the heart...  What you knead is what you get&quot;   <br/>
 <br/>
The baker/writer, Ed Brown, lives in a zen community.  His book is good. I don&#39;t know that it convinced me completely however since I use a corporate American Kitchenaid to do most of my kneading!  But I got inspired by his recipes to make my own bread, several kinds.  And I know that the more I knead, the better it tastes.  Though I have never asked anyone else eating my bread if they noticed a difference  : )   <br/>
