<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Christians believe that Jesus came to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>earth for the very purpose to die for our sins. He was the<br/>
&quot;sacrificial lamb&quot;, accepted this role, and did not try to flee or to<br/>
defend himself. Mel Gibson has stated that this is the reason it is<br/>
HIS hand that was filmed pounding the first nail into Jesus&#39; palm,<br/>
because he feels HE is as much to &quot;blame&quot; for the death as anyone.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a Christian radio station here handing out buttons that say &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
responsible&quot; as a way of explaining the culpability of all human kind that<br/>
is central to Christian doctrine.<br/>
<br/>
As for teens seeing it, like so many things, it depends entirely on the<br/>
individual and how sensitive a person s/he is.  A bunch of devout teens I<br/>
know are going as a group and plan to go somewhere afterward to talk about<br/>
it.  Some of the kids in the group won&#39;t go.  Someone without a background<br/>
in Bible may have lots of questions after seeing this very intense snapshot<br/>
of the most painful moment in the Christian story.  Without context it will<br/>
just seem like a gore-fest.  To me, it is an expression of the most Holy and<br/>
loving God who became flesh to take the sins of the world on His own<br/>
shoulders in order to reconcile us to Him.  For the Christian, it truly is a<br/>
love story.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more to say, but alas it has little to do with unschooling so I&#39;ll<br/>
leave it at that.<br/>
