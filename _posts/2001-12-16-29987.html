While some unschoolers might claim to allow their children to make <br/>
their own moral decisions and take their own paths in life, there are <br/>
probably very few who actually do.  <br/>
<br/>
Whether she&#39;s a fundamentalist Christian who draws the line at reading <br/>
Harry Potter or a liberal pagan who who draws the line at animal <br/>
experimentation, most unschoolers do draw a line.  <br/>
<br/>
It is probably very important to both moms that they pass on their <br/>
world views to their children, whether it is a Christian mom being <br/>
concerned that her child accept Christ as Savior and follow the Bible, <br/>
a atheist being concerned that her child  be accepting of all beliefs <br/>
and lifestyles, or a pagan who is concerned that her child consider <br/>
animals as important as humans.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045536109">Being as important is not the same as being equal.  All parts of the fabric<br/>
that is mother earth are equally important.  When you start picking out<br/>
threads and discarding them as unimportant one may find that the whole<br/>
fabric unravels.<br/>
<br/>
The kidlets have been taught that everything on this earth is to be treated<br/>
with respect, be that human, animal or plant.  And, if you really think<br/>
about it, you can pretty much tell by the way people treat animals how they<br/>
will treat others that are weaker and more vulnerable than they are.<br/>
<br/>
Almost every serial killer ever interviewed has excused animal cruelty<br/>
because animals aren&#39;t as important as humans or &quot;they are only animals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to dig around and see if I can find the study that was done that<br/>
showed that adults who get their &quot;pleasure&quot; from watching what can be<br/>
considered animal cruelty (dog fights, cock fights, bull fights, bear<br/>
baiting, etc.) are also those that are more likely to be abusive to their<br/>
spouses or children.<br/>
