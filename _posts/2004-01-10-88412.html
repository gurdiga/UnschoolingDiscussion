<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978215333">Kathryn, <br/>
  I have a daughter who will be 12.5 yrs at the time of the conference and <br/>
she says she&#39;d interested in doing a presentation on her life as an <br/>
Unschooler.Which I must admit I found to be quite surprising as she used to be quite the <br/>
introvert until we discovered Unschooling.<br/>
  I&#39;m not sure exactly what you are looking for a teen to talk about or <br/>
convey but I&#39;m quite confident she feels her life as an unschooler is the &quot;BEST&quot;. <br/>
She takes horseback riding lessons and does volunteer work at the stables 2-4 <br/>
days per week depending on her schedule, has a &quot;job&quot; walking a neighborhood <br/>
dog, is frequently asked to baby-sit because of her maturity and kindness to <br/>
young children, takes a yoga class (given by another homeschooler w/ 5 yrs of yoga <br/>
training), has taken a training class to volunteer for Earth Day at our local <br/>
Zoo in April, involved in a once a month book club, drama club and the list <br/>
goes on. By the way, she wants to be a vet someday specializing in equine <br/>
medicine. She lives her life in total_freedom.<br/>
  If you feel she would be an interesting subject just let us know. <br/>
  We enjoyed the Conference so much last year and are looking forward to this <br/>
years as well. We are now planning all vacations around this event!!!<br/>
