<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200066149">Could anyone tell me how I would go about finding a Private School <br/>
to enroll my son with.  I dont especially want him to have to do all <br/>
the testing that the county puts them through, even though he would <br/>
do fine since he has only been out of public school a couple <br/>
months.  I want to get away from the county as far as what he is <br/>
learning.  Since I am new at this I need all the advice I can get.  <br/>
My family was all for us homeschooling, but hate the idea of <br/>
unschooling.  They say he will not learn a thing unless I MAKE him.  <br/>
I think it is just wonderful for children to be free to learn the <br/>
way they want to learn.  Right now my 10 year old is outside with an <br/>
electric wood chiseler making me a wounderful carving, with noone <br/>
looking over his shoulder telling him what to do. <br/>
I just dont want the county to tell me that he should be at this <br/>
level or that level.  That is the reason I want to go through <br/>
Private Schools.  How do they evaluate?  I need help on this, cause <br/>
I dont want to get us in a heap of trouble over this.  Any advice <br/>
will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you all so much.  <br/>

Your family is wrong.<br/>
Is it their decision or yours?<br/>

If I felt I had to sign up with a school, I would use Clonlara:<br/>

Have you contacted your local or state homeschool groups?  There are usually people in those groups who are familiar with unschooling AND meeting any state guidelines.  They vary from state to state, so information you got here may not apply to your particular situation.<br/>
<br/>
I have used Family Learning Organization to meet my state&#39;s requirements for annual assessment. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-574515247">What state are you in?  That would help a lot!  Not all states test.  In<br/>
Washington we test, but donÂ¹t show anyone.  We can choose an evaluation<br/>
instead.  <br/>
