<div id="ygrps-yiv-508002253">FWIW from a lurker, quick and dirty intro: Kim<br/>
Montoya, married 2 dh Chuck 4 10 years, Las Cruces,<br/>
New Mexico, dd8 Carla, ds6 Ted, not/un/de-schooling<br/>
since Oct 2002...<br/>
<br/>
I am typing one-handed with a broken arm gotten<br/>
SKATEBOARDING 2 weeks ago today...I hit a pebble on<br/>
the FLAT...it WILL happen. I now have technicolor<br/>
knees and a bruise on my left boob too&lt;weg&gt;!<br/>
<br/>
{yes, I AM 37, quit yer snickerin&#39;}<br/>
<br/>
I wear pads/guards/helmet for inline, sk8boarding and<br/>
a helmet 4 biking...except that friday! MY rigid wrist<br/>
guards were off &#39;cause I FORGOT them  after changing<br/>
Ted over from shoes 2 sk8s, he is boarding and inline<br/>
sk8ing. My internist broke her wrist inlne sk8ing a<br/>
couple of years back WEARING IDENTICAL GUARDS.  There<br/>
are no guarantees.<br/>
<br/>
Sk8ing is dangerous, done skillfully MORE so, as is<br/>
most kid-type biking.  What fun! But someone biffs it<br/>
bad on sk8s, boards or (next door to the sk8park) at<br/>
the BMX bike run every couple of weeks here--we see<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I think my kids will continue to want to wear their<br/>
padding/helmets. At least they said they will remind<br/>
me to wear mine, they see how much my broken arm sux,<br/>
and they also know that I REALLY believe that if I<br/>
hadn&#39;t forgotten the guard, I MIGHT have just bruised<br/>
it instead----wahhhhhhh &lt;g&gt;...<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have pads or helmet as a kid, I crashed<br/>
bikes, sk8s and boards regularly, nothing ever broken<br/>
but knees scarred to heck STILL, bonked head, jambed<br/>
fingers, bad bruises, a scab somewhere always!<br/>
I have ALL kinds of safety gear as an adult, for<br/>
myself and the kids (and extras). I think some of it<br/>
is well made and does protect, but how well?? Dunno,<br/>
really, but I use it.  <br/>
 <br/>
I did START putting helmets on them as naturally as<br/>
breathing from the first time they toddled over to a<br/>
trike-they see me wear mine 2 bike 2...they have never<br/>
asked if they HAVE to wear them, they think they are<br/>
quite cool.  Mine is purple, has flames and anime<br/>
stickers, what can I SAY? &lt;wink&gt; <br/>
<br/>
There is a pretty steep 7+ foot deep bowl @ our<br/>
sk8park, Ted fell right into it his first day out (of<br/>
course!) got the wind knocked out pretty hard @ was<br/>
glad of his helmet. (Me too)!<br/>
<br/>
Would I FORCE them to wear the safety gear? No. With<br/>
this, like with everything else, I try to set an<br/>
honest example using my best judgement, and talk about<br/>
it sometimes out loud while considering the options.<br/>
And I talked some about my own consequences, so they<br/>
see I am not beating myself up over making a mistake<br/>
and forgetting something!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait till my arm heals, I have a **BRAND NEW**<br/>
Yu-Gi-Oh sk8board (blue, dark Yugi), prezzie from my<br/>
dh &lt;smile&gt;!  4 weeks 2 go till I back in action on it.<br/>
{Huzzah for HEALTH INSURANCE!!}<br/>
Loving this list,<br/>
Kim<br/>

<br/>
Well... <br/>
Good to see someone else from New Mexico here! <br/>
One-armed typing always impresses me.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I try to set an<br/>
honest example using my best judgement, and talk about<br/>

<br/>
The example I set is &quot;Stay out of the skate park!&quot; because I&#39;m a wimp. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have a bike trailer, an old one, rear-facing with  the straps gone, and <br/>
sometimes Holly hooks it to her bike and gives the younger neighbors rides <br/>
around the cul-de-sac.    The other day she hooked it to her unicycle, <br/>
thinking maybe it would give her the tri-cycle effect (because she&#39;s still a <br/>
beginner at the unicycle), but it pulled the unicycle back some and made it <br/>
harder.  She hauled it on around a few times anyway, to see if she could get <br/>
it to work.<br/>

<br/>
From about the age of 12 to 17, I wanted to be a Navy<br/>
pilot...I wanted to fly the F-14 Tomcat. We&#39;d moved to<br/>

I went and bought a couple Hot Wheels planes and went<br/>

remember much from it now, but I remember sitting<br/>
there at an Air Show and when I wasn&#39;t performing<br/>
(cheerleader and dance team) I hung out with the crews<br/>

me seriously and they could have just blown me off,<br/>
you know? I have a photo of me and &quot;my guys&quot; ... maybe<br/>
one of these days I&#39;ll get it scanned. Dish (his last<br/>
name was Petrie!), Gumby, Max and Buster were their<br/>
callsigns. I don&#39;t think I ever knew their real<br/>
names!! They called me Einstein...which of course,<br/>
others found out about and started calling me (not<br/>
like I wasn&#39;t used to being a nerd anyway) so when I<br/>
found a Tshirt with an Andy Warhol-type Einstein on it<br/>
(four blocks of a different color with a different<br/>
colored Einstein in the block)...I took it and sewed<br/>
it onto the back of my jean jacket! <br/>

Ethan at 110 pounds around in that bike trailer..  But he doesnt seem to <br/>
mind.. they take turns hauling each other, thier toys, the dog, sticks.. <br/>
heck, whatever they can find to haul around.  They have also attached that <br/>
bike trailer to all sorts of other &quot;vehicles&quot;  Thier big wheels, thier <br/>
scooters, an old peddal tractor.  Dont ask me how they rig it up, its <br/>
creative engineering :-)<br/>

here such as I requested in my initial posting and<br/>
have received?! <br/>
<br/>
As the main page for the group states &quot;(If) you&#39;d like<br/>
to find out more about how video games and life in<br/>
general are filled with learning, come join<br/>
us!...Everyone with an interest in unschooling is<br/>
welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you<br/>
keep in mind the purpose of this list, which is to<br/>
discuss unschooling in ways designed to help each<br/>
other become unschoolers or become better at<br/>
unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am not above questioning myself and my decisions or<br/>
reasonings for my decisions, like a tree in a storm if<br/>
I don&#39;t bend, I&#39;d break. However bending too fast can<br/>
prove just as damaging as a break. <br/>
<br/>
So what if I&#39;m not ready or able to entirely unschool<br/>
at this time? Does that mean I&#39;m not welcome here<br/>
despite the welcoming opening and things I have<br/>
already gained from being here? Does it mean that if I<br/>
don&#39;t rush into this without a full understanding and<br/>
consideration that I&#39;m bound to ruin my children&#39;s<br/>
lives? I&#39;d rather take the time to learn, question if<br/>
needed, and be certain than to rush things and harm<br/>
them in the process. <br/>

Not &quot;bound to&quot; but you do run more risk of wasting time than if you read and <br/>
honestly consider the ideas people are sharing with you.<br/>

like it is.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone was saying that.  I personally like to have a few<br/>
&quot;instructor&#39;s guides&quot; for early childhood education out of the library<br/>
at any given time.  Not because I buy into their absurd &quot;lesson plans&quot;,<br/>
but because sometimes my son will say something like, &quot;Let&#39;s make<br/>
stuff!&quot; and since I&#39;m somewhat craft-impaired, I like to have something<br/>
to flip through so I can say, &quot;Would you like to make something with<br/>
homemade clay or paint with a string?&quot;  Or if there are a lot of<br/>
pictures, he can browse it and let me know what projects look fun.  If<br/>
we were relying on my lack of craft imagination, it would be crayons and<br/>
white paper every time.<br/>
 <br/>
But if I were to sit down with one of the books and take their<br/>
suggestions seriously, that wouldn&#39;t be unschooling.  I mean, one of the<br/>
books I have out of the library has an &quot;integrated thematic unit&quot; on<br/>
apples, complete with objectives, vocabulary words, and assessment<br/>
criteria.  It&#39;s ridiculous.  But it does have a recipe I might try<br/>
sometime.  I like the fact that through the library I can keep changing<br/>
the books, because honestly these types of books have about 10 or 15<br/>
good ideas per 500 pages.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s sometimes hard to see the difference between unschooling and other<br/>
forms of homeschooling.  I mean, one parent might use an early childhood<br/>
curriculum book to actually sit down for two hours each morning and do a<br/>
&quot;lesson&quot; on each &quot;unit&quot;.  That&#39;s not unschooling by any definition.  It<br/>
could be the very same book I have on my shelf to pull out when my son<br/>
wants to do something and I&#39;m fresh out of ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122296155">If she didn&#39;t want to listen to or learn from what<br/>
we&#39;re using I wouldn&#39;t use it...for example we&#39;ve been<br/>
using Saxon math. She is not wild about it and prefers<br/>
to do her computer games. Again I&#39;m not yet in a place<br/>
to totally do like we would prefer so I can&#39;t not have<br/>
her working on math skills, but I can at least help<br/>
her find other ways to learn it than from this<br/>
curriculum. If she didn&#39;t want to read a book right<br/>
now, or at all, I won&#39;t make her read it or listen to<br/>
it, but I&#39;d look for something else she&#39;d like or read<br/>
her something she has chosen from the library.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Reading ahead and not going in order, but still<br/>
&quot;having&quot; to  use them in some way, is not even close<br/>

they are &quot;school stuff&quot; rely on them primarily? that&#39;s<br/>

That&#39;s about the closest that has come to how I&#39;m<br/>
using Sonlight, not in it&#39;s entirety and strictly<br/>
according to their schedule but as a guide and a<br/>
stepping-stone to more. Maybe I haven&#39;t been very<br/>
clear on that, and for that I&#39;ll apologize. There is<br/>
much with the curriculum that we aren&#39;t using, having<br/>
tried and decided it wasn&#39;t working, or didn&#39;t even<br/>
try because we knew it wouldn&#39;t work just from looking<br/>
at it. But there are things that I DO have to teach,<br/>
in some form. Like I&#39;ve said I&#39;d like to get further<br/>
away from Sonlight than we are at this point, but<br/>
there are many good things to be found within so I<br/>
don&#39;t want to totally throw it out simply because it&#39;s<br/>
a prepared curriculum. My problem has been the<br/>
suggestion that the only way to get away from it is to<br/>
totally ignore it, but is that really necessary if it<br/>
is a good resource for us? <br/>

&gt; anything<br/>
&gt; like it is.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think anyone was saying that.  I personally<br/>
&gt; like to have a few<br/>
&gt; &quot;instructor&#39;s guides&quot; for early childhood education<br/>
&gt; out of the library<br/>
&gt; at any given time.  Not because I buy into their<br/>
&gt; absurd &quot;lesson plans&quot;,<br/>
&gt; but because sometimes my son will say something<br/>
&gt; like, &quot;Let&#39;s make<br/>
&gt; stuff!&quot; and since I&#39;m somewhat craft-impaired, I<br/>
&gt; like to have something<br/>
&gt; to flip through so I can say, &quot;Would you like to<br/>
&gt; make something with<br/>
&gt; homemade clay or paint with a string?&quot;  Or if there<br/>
&gt; are a lot of<br/>
&gt; pictures, he can browse it and let me know what<br/>
&gt; projects look fun.  If<br/>
&gt; we were relying on my lack of craft imagination, it<br/>
&gt; would be crayons and<br/>
&gt; white paper every time.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; But if I were to sit down with one of the books and<br/>
&gt; take their<br/>
&gt; suggestions seriously, that wouldn&#39;t be unschooling.<br/>
&gt;  I mean, one of the<br/>
&gt; books I have out of the library has an &quot;integrated<br/>
&gt; thematic unit&quot; on<br/>
&gt; apples, complete with objectives, vocabulary words,<br/>
&gt; and assessment<br/>
&gt; criteria.  It&#39;s ridiculous.  But it does have a<br/>
&gt; recipe I might try<br/>
&gt; sometime.  I like the fact that through the library<br/>
&gt; I can keep changing<br/>
&gt; the books, because honestly these types of books<br/>
&gt; have about 10 or 15<br/>
&gt; good ideas per 500 pages.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s sometimes hard to see the difference between<br/>
&gt; unschooling and other<br/>
&gt; forms of homeschooling.  I mean, one parent might<br/>
&gt; use an early childhood<br/>
&gt; curriculum book to actually sit down for two hours<br/>
&gt; each morning and do a<br/>
&gt; &quot;lesson&quot; on each &quot;unit&quot;.  That&#39;s not unschooling by<br/>
&gt; any definition.  It<br/>
&gt; could be the very same book I have on my shelf to<br/>
&gt; pull out when my son<br/>
&gt; wants to do something and I&#39;m fresh out of ideas.<br/>

Yes I did leave that part out intentionally. However,<br/>
it is not my nature to sit quietly and hope my<br/>
questions will be answered. They won&#39;t be answered if<br/>
I don&#39;t ask them. So I&#39;m asking. I have been through<br/>
the unschooling.com website and whatnot, but prefer<br/>
the interaction given through discussion as that is<br/>
what this is for, isn&#39;t it?<br/>

I haven&#39;t posted on this board in over a year, and there is a reason.  When I first joined, I came in here with &quot;both guns blazing&quot;, sure I knew what unschooling was and is, and sure I was doing it, and immediately jumped into a confrontation with Sandra over something or other, and left in a huff. (psst...Sandra was right, too, about that other thing, and I was wrong)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I slunk in again about 4 or 5 months ago, and was determined to just lurk forever and glean what I could use and toss what didn&#39;t suit me.  That didn&#39;t work.  Instead, I found myself questioning the way I did things that didn&#39;t fit the unschooling lifestyle.  And those things that didn&#39;t &quot;suit&quot; have become a nice fit.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I strongly urge you to just lurk and read for a couple weeks to a month or even longer, like I did.  Read the archives, which alone will take you a couple months if you spend hours each day.  Read the new posts every day, too.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When you get the urge to post, hold off a while until you hear how others respond.  Several times I have wanted to throw my hat into the ring, but waited and within 24 hours someone had either answered my question or had posted exactly the response I was going to give or had posted a response that was the opposite of my initial reaction since I am still learning how to unschool myself.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In the Corner of Lurkdom, I have seen that many times new posters say things like &quot;My 3 year old won&#39;t learn the alphabet and how to read unless I teach him&quot; instead of saying, &quot;How will my 3yo learn the alphabet if I don&#39;t teach him?  How did your children learn?&quot;  I have observed that the first type of post brings a totally different type of response than the second one.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Your questions will be answered, even if you don&#39;t ask them.  In fact, your questions have already been asked, many times, by other newbies, and then answered, many times, by Sandra and others, and it is in the archives.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going back into Lurkdom now, since my true unschooling journey is only 6 months old, even though I&#39;ve been homeschooling for 9 years, and all nine have been stepping stones to where I am now...I still have much to learn from this list before I will feel comfortable commenting or offering my thoughts here.<br/>

 <br/>
I hope you haven&#39;t left the list.  I like to see people stick around<br/>
until the paradigm shift occurs and they &quot;get&quot; what&#39;s being said.  You<br/>
still weren&#39;t getting what I was saying.  You said:<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;That&#39;s about the closest that has come to how I&#39;m<br/>
 </span></blockquote>using Sonlight, not in it&#39;s entirety and strictly<br/>
according to their schedule but as a guide and a<br/>
stepping-stone to more.&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>
 <br/>
Then a few short paragraphs later, you said:<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;But there are things that I DO have to teach,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in some form.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
See, what we&#39;re doing is coming from a completely different motivation.<br/>
One of the books I currently have out of the library is called &quot;Story<br/>
Stretchers&quot;. I would never say, &quot;I&#39;m homeschooling using Story<br/>
Stretchers.&quot;  It&#39;s just a book that happens to one my shelf this month<br/>
and next month I&#39;ll probably have a different book on my shelf about a<br/>
similar topic.  <br/>
 <br/>
But the key is that it&#39;s *not* there because I think there are things I<br/>
have to teach.  I don&#39;t think that at all.  My son learns amazing things<br/>
each day that I&#39;ve never taught him.  Last night he wanted me to get off<br/>
the computer so he could practice spelling words in Microsoft Word.<br/>
He&#39;s not quite 5, and I&#39;ve never asked him to do any spelling.  He<br/>
wanted to learn to spell words, but doesn&#39;t want to use pencil and paper<br/>
because he doesn&#39;t quite have the fine motor skills to write letters<br/>
he&#39;s happy with.  He&#39;ll learn to spell, and type, and someday even write<br/>
with pencil, and I won&#39;t have to teach him any of it.  <br/>
 <br/>
The reason I have Story Stretchers on my book shelf is because my son<br/>
has lots more energy than I do, and frequently his desire to do things<br/>
is far ahead of my creativity.  I used the example of painting with<br/>
string as something I&#39;ve gotten out of an education manual.  There&#39;s no<br/>
reason on earth I feel children need to be taught to paint with string.<br/>
But he&#39;s always asking to &quot;make stuff&quot; and I can only pass him the white<br/>
paper and crayons so many times before I realize I&#39;m holding him back by<br/>
my lack of creativity.  If he never wants to do another craft project<br/>
again, that would be fine with me (I&#39;d probably be relieved.  Crafts are<br/>
not my forte).<br/>
 <br/>
I hope I&#39;ve made things more clear, but I&#39;ve probably managed to muddy<br/>
them up further.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It isn&#39;t the instructor&#39;s guide or the paper that makes them worthless, it is <br/>
that the child didn&#39;t have the choice.  If she said I don&#39;t want to do that <br/>
would you say OK and chuck it.  Did you ask her?  Unschooling is about trust <br/>
and choice.<br/>
<br/>
What state are you in.  In NC here it is easy, I know that... but I believe <br/>
that someone here might be able to help you with understanding the state <br/>
requirements if you mentioned the state.  Unschooling can be done in any <br/>
state, I believe.<br/>
