&gt; Behind the Redwood Curtain &lt;g&gt;  Humboldt County.  If your kidlets have<br/>
seen<br/>
&gt; Lost World (the Jurassic Park sequel), then you have seen one of the<br/>
places<br/>
&gt; we go on the weekends to let the kidlets run or watch the elk that roam<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; over in huge herds (we have signs on the freeway for elk crossings as they<br/>
&gt; litterly life right on the side of the road) or play in the surf.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We get lots of fog and rain but can drive out of it.  All within an easy<br/>
&gt; drive we have seven rivers, 2 lakes, five lagoons, about half a million<br/>
&gt; acres in state and national parks, miles and miles of play upon ocean<br/>
&gt; beaches, a bay that is calm enough for kayaking and skulling, a zoo in the<br/>
&gt; middle of town and rural enough that we have beer, racoons, fox and<br/>
&gt; occasionally a bear that wander through city streets.<br/>
