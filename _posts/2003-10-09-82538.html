<div id="ygrps-yiv-864813476">Mark and the kids are out getting milk and bread from the shop for me as I<br/>
am feeling a little unwell. At least I hope they remember to buy the milk<br/>
and bread as Mark turns the whole &#39;going to the shop experience&#39; into a<br/>
dangerous mission. So it takes at least 20 minutes to get ready, arming<br/>
themselves, finding out from the &#39;chief&#39; the objective of the mission,<br/>
looking out for the enemy on the way......<br/>
<br/>
Kids are great and husbands who haven&#39;t forgotten how to play are pretty<br/>
awesome too!<br/>
