 </span></blockquote>I would be happy to...please bear in mind that it is my first attempt at <br/>
writing since college. :) I had been thinking a lot about our unschooling <br/>
lifestyle and was trying to express my thoughts on paper.<br/>
<br/>
                                  Learning With Dinosaurs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      My son Trevor (age 5) has developed an obsession that hits many little <br/>
boys between the ages of four and seven years of age: dinosaurs. Apatosaurus, <br/>
brachiosaurus, coelophysis....these names are tossed around our house in the <br/>
course of normal conversation. I&#39;m not sure if he was first introduced to <br/>
dinosaurs through TV or books or even Land Before Time videos but they are <br/>
definitely now a part of our day-to-day life and I have learned far more <br/>
about dinosaurs than I ever wanted to know! This interest has also shown me <br/>
how to trust that learning occurs when a child is allowed to explore his or <br/>
her passions without a parent disrupting the natural flow with explanations <br/>
or &quot;teaching.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
      Here are some examples of natural learning that have taken place during <br/>
the dinosaur phase:<br/>
      <br/>
      As Trevor approached the age of 5, I was beginning to be slightly <br/>
concerned with my son&#39;s &quot;odd&quot; pencil grip and his utter lack of desire to <br/>
write his letters. In my mind, I knew that he was still very young but I <br/>
could not help trying to correct his pencil grip or demonstrating how to <br/>
write &quot;cat.&quot; My efforts were met with his justified refusal to write anything <br/>
at all and I decided to let him move at his own pace (which is what I should <br/>
have done in the first place.) <br/>
<br/>
     Months went by and he developed the interest in dinosaurs. He spent many <br/>
hours pouring over picture books and being an early reader, read them aloud <br/>
to anyone who would listen. After a while, we would find him lying on the <br/>
floor drawing pictures of the various species of dinosaurs. When he showed <br/>
them to us, he would proudly point out each type, &quot;This is a Tyrannosaurus <br/>
rex, this is a stegosaurus, this is an archaeopteryx&quot; and so on. One day, he <br/>
brought me a picture he had drawn of a big, long-necked dinosaur and under <br/>
the drawing was the scrawled word &quot;brachiosaurus.&quot; His passion for dinosaurs <br/>
had prompted him to write that long word better than all my efforts to get <br/>
him to write &quot;cat!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
       Trevor has also learned a lot about science, of course, through this <br/>
dinosaur phase. He&#39;s learned what an omnivore, an herbivore and a carnivore <br/>
are and about predators, scavengers and prey. These concepts led to <br/>
discussions about food chains and life in the wild.<br/>
<br/>
       We&#39;ve also talked about the different theories of the dinosaurs&#39; <br/>
extinction and the evidence which make scientists support the different <br/>
theories. We went to Fossil Park in Sylvania, Ohio and learned about fossils <br/>
and then we read about the tar pits where dinosaurs would meet untimely <br/>
deaths. This led to discussions about the geographical locations of various <br/>
dinosaurs and we located them on a world map. <br/>
     <br/>
<br/>
       The questions about dinosaurs soon exceeded my meager knowledge of <br/>
them and Trevor learned ways to find his own answers. I showed him how to <br/>
search for information online, how to look up specific names in glossaries <br/>
and indexes of books and how to check his own books out of the library. These <br/>
skills will aid him in learning about any subject in which he will be <br/>
interested in the future.<br/>
<br/>
       Just yesterday, he glanced up from one of his books and exclaimed, <br/>
&quot;Hey, Mom, this says that dimetrodons were 29 feet long! How long is that?&quot; <br/>
We got out a 12-inch ruler and marked off 29 feet across the house. &quot;Wow, <br/>
that&#39;s really long!&quot; he said with his eyes wide. I think that was the first <br/>
time he really realized how big some of those creatures were. He spent the <br/>
rest of the afternoon mapping about the lengths of various other dinosaurs <br/>
and then measured the lengths of items around the house, like books, crayons <br/>
and his little sister&#39;s ponytail!<br/>
<br/>
        Watching my son follow his interests and learning about his world in <br/>
the process has been an enlightening experience for me. I have a new <br/>
confidence in children&#39;s curiosity and their drive to learn and explore. As I <br/>
write, Trevor is developing a a new interest in sharks and I can only <br/>
anticipate what paths we will follow and what we will learn. Who knows where <br/>
it will take us?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078958679">Me too! A year or so ago. It is awesome to watch them *suck the marrow* out<br/>
of a subject and they don&#39;t forget what they discover either.<br/>
<br/>
When I think of the subjects we&#39;ve covered when we were schooling at home I<br/>
realize that even though they were happy to *learn*  with me, they haven&#39;t<br/>
remembered much of what we covered.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t important to them. Just to me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009571154">Awesome!  It is so cool to watch your kids branch off from one subject like<br/>
that.  Mine have done exactly the same thing.  I wish other families<br/>
(non-unschooling) could see it in their kids.<br/>
