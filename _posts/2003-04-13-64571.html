<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008201068"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;It was nice to go to a park with Teresa.  We stayed as long as we wanted <br/>
&gt;&gt;and had fun and talked, and not about school work or grades or curriculum. <br/>
&gt;&gt;LOL&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a fledgling unschooling group going here and we had our first park <br/>
day of the season last week. It was WONDERFUL. Not any  mention at all of <br/>
curriculums or even homeschooling for that matter. Lots of kids of wildly <br/>
varying ages playing cooperatively together. And lots of moms sharing life <br/>
stories, not school stories.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so hoping the weather will hold for next week, but I hear it&#39;s supposed <br/>
to snow again. :-(<br/>

earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly alive.&quot;<br/>
