&gt;just had to comment,  my dh also still asks about school and what<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&#39;schoolwork&#39; we accomplished.  Sometimes I&#39;ll give him a bit of educationese<br/>
related to our day&#39;s activities.<br/>
    He&#39;s all for HS,  not sure about unschooling.<br/>

&gt;     Well, now my husband is totally for homeschooling!!!   He never<br/>
 </span></blockquote>suggests<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;putting the kids back in school at all.  And although he doesn&#39;t really<br/>
&gt;understand unschooling (he still comes home and asks how school was<br/>
&gt;today----or asks to see some of the kids schoolpapers), he really loves the<br/>
&gt;difference it has made in our kids.<br/>
&gt;     Let your husband see the difference this year makes to your kids, then<br/>
&gt;he will probably be behind homeschooling 100%.<br/>
