<div id="ygrps-yiv-638899909">dear everyone,<br/>
<br/>
in a lot of posts about the change to unschooling I see my own problems <br/>
reflected, and a lot of it has to do with changing my knee-jerk reaction in a <br/>
situation. To not respond in anger to anger or to be disappointed by whining for <br/>
things, or to even see things in a knee-jerk way, to see an expression as anger <br/>
or as whining.<br/>
<br/>
What has helped me very much, apart from reading the list, is listening to the <br/>
lectures of PemaChödrön. Almost every lecture deals with looking at my own <br/>
knee-jerk reactions, which happens so easily and puts me so quickly in something <br/>
escalating in something I don&#39;t want. By seeing this, by pointing it out to me <br/>
in her lectures she directs me to a different way of reacting, with clear <br/>
examples. (I don&#39;t want to make an advertisement and if Sandra thinks this is <br/>
not good for the list just chuck it out, but it made such a huge difference in <br/>
my unschooling that I didn&#39;t want to withheld it)<br/>
<br/>
Somehow it just clicked so much. And by just making time as much as possible <br/>
before reacting, to accept the moment that is happening and just be as <br/>
compassionate as possible for everyone, life is going smoother, happier and more <br/>
loving. By making the change from reacting to looking, I even see things in <br/>
advance coming and that helps too.<br/>
<br/>
It made me just see that in this turmoil (because of my illness) Alma just needs <br/>
to be in my bed again, before she had to discover it, and it makes us happy. And <br/>
that my big son yesterday was just overwhelmed himself instead of angry and he <br/>
needed help instead of an hard word. It made me see that we all have problems <br/>
with transitioning from one place to another because we are all overwhelmed and <br/>
that a lot of slowness, love and compassion, where-ever possible is the best <br/>
thing we can give each-other. And by giving the compassionate example it makes <br/>
it easier for everyone else in the family to stay connected.<br/>

I think any zen recommendations are good ones.<br/>

A good combo of zen and making connections is the music and movie- <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-366404228">I too find Pema to be a wonderful partner in unschooling!<br/>
In that vein, check out Sandra&#39;s Peaceful Parenting talk (sorry I can&#39;t link<br/>
on my phone). It changed, no continues to change! my life.<br/>
It addresses those knee-jerk moments & gives real options for YOU :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-205429764">Wow Sandra, I really loved the talk, and it was nice to hear your voice (was <br/>
still missing, reading your book, your written words on the pages of this list <br/>
made me wonder). I downloaded it to my mp3 player and listened to it when the <br/>
rest was still sleeping.<br/>
Thanks everyone for pointing it out to me.<br/>
