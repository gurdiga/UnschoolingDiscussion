about how it is the governments fault that kids are in daycares and that<br/>
daycares are what cause violent kids.  The other side of the equation was<br/>
the editor from Working Women who said that working has no effect on kids<br/>
because women who are happy in their jobs raise happy kids.  Both said 75%<br/>
