If this was the list where somebody was seeking a toothpaste without fluoride, I found one.  If so, please let me know so I don&#39;t keep posting this link on every list I&#39;m on!  I hope this is the right one.<br/>

Well, the dentist who wrote the LLL(GB) leaflet on <br/>
breastfeeding and dental health doens&#39;t use fluoride <br/>
tothpaste, and would only use it in teratment as a <br/>
topical application on rampantly decayed teeth.  It&#39;s <br/>
one of those things that&#39;s been seen as &#39;good&#39; and used <br/>
all over, without real &#39;proof.&#39;  I think it was used in <br/>
POW camps at some time/place to keep the inmates <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564484754">Fluoride compounds which are put in water (fluoridation), toothpaste and<br/>
supplement tablets (including some vitamins) were never tested for safety<br/>
before approval.<br/>
<br/>
There has been some research stating that there may be a link between<br/>
fluoride and many things, including cancer (bone cancer specifically).  It<br/>
does cause cancer in rats.  There has been a &quot;statistically significant&quot; tie<br/>
between fluoridation and osteosarcoma rates in young males in New Jersey.<br/>
One thing I know of was an independent thing done by EMUD (East bay<br/>
municipal utility district in california) that showed that rats that drank<br/>
fluoridated water did get bone cancer.<br/>
<br/>
Study by the National Toxicology Program on the effect of sodium fluoride on<br/>
rats and mice showed &quot;that sodium fluoride does cause cancer at cumulative<br/>
doses comparable to those ingested by humans over a number of years. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
There was a study by neurotoxicologist and former Director of toxicology at<br/>
Forsyth Dental Center in Boston, Dr. Phyllis Mullenix, showing that fluoride<br/>
built up in the brains of animals when exposed to moderate levels.  Damage<br/>
was done and there was adverse behavioral problems.  Offspring of pregnant<br/>
animals that received relatively low doses of fluoride showed ADD-like<br/>
symptoms and hyperactivity.<br/>
There has also been research showing it lowers IQs, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The US Center for Diseas Control has stated that fluoride helps teeth when<br/>
it is applied topically, not necessarily when ingested.<br/>
<br/>
EPA scientists have attempted action against the EPA itself for failing to<br/>
protect public health when it comes to fluoridation of water.<br/>
During 1986-87, in a survey of 39,207 children between the ages of 5 and 17,<br/>
the US National Institute for Dental Research found children living in<br/>
fluoridated areas had 18% less tooth decay than children living in<br/>
non-fluoridated areas, based on Decayed, Missing and Filled tooth Surfaces.<br/>
Additional corrections raised this to 25%.  However, in areas that were<br/>
high-decay the rate of decay actually increased in neighborhoods that had<br/>
fluoridated water (9.4%)<br/>
In other studies, including the largest ever carried out (400,000 students)<br/>
showed that tooth decay actually increased when fluoride was added to water.<br/>
It is important to know exactly the number involved when making the decision<br/>
(is it that important?).<br/>
In 1944, the Journal of the American Dental Association reported: ``With 1.6<br/>
to 4 ppm fluoride in the water, 50 percent or more past age 24 have false<br/>
teeth because of fluoride damage to their own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Fluoride compounds in fluordiated water is toxic waste and is often<br/>
contaminated with lead, arsenic, and radio nuclides (something to think<br/>
about if you live in a fluoridated area like I do).<br/>
It has also been linked to excessive hip fractures.  fluoride builds up in<br/>
the bones and causes bad changes to the bone structure.<br/>
In the UK one study showed that perinatal deaths was 15% higher than in<br/>
non-fluoridated areas.<br/>
China, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, The<br/>
Netherlands, Hungary, and Japan have all rejected, banned, or stopped<br/>
fluoridation of their water for various reasons.<br/>
<br/>

human body, one possible site is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bruha.com/fluoride/">http://www.bruha.com/fluoride/</a><br/>

&gt; Fluoride compounds which are put in water (fluoridation), <br/>
toothpaste and<br/>
&gt; supplement tablets (including some vitamins) were never tested for <br/>
safety<br/>
&gt; before approval.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There has been some research stating that there may be a link <br/>
between<br/>
&gt; fluoride and many things, including cancer (bone cancer <br/>
specifically).  It<br/>
&gt; does cause cancer in rats.  There has been a &quot;statistically <br/>
significant&quot; tie<br/>
&gt; between fluoridation and osteosarcoma rates in young males in New <br/>
Jersey.<br/>
&gt; One thing I know of was an independent thing done by EMUD (East bay<br/>
&gt; municipal utility district in california) that showed that rats <br/>
that drank<br/>
&gt; fluoridated water did get bone cancer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Study by the National Toxicology Program on the effect of sodium <br/>
fluoride on<br/>
&gt; rats and mice showed &quot;that sodium fluoride does cause cancer at <br/>
cumulative<br/>
&gt; doses comparable to those ingested by humans over a number of <br/>
years. &quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There was a study by neurotoxicologist and former Director of <br/>
toxicology at<br/>
&gt; Forsyth Dental Center in Boston, Dr. Phyllis Mullenix, showing that <br/>
fluoride<br/>
&gt; built up in the brains of animals when exposed to moderate levels.  <br/>
Damage<br/>
&gt; was done and there was adverse behavioral problems.  Offspring of <br/>
pregnant<br/>
&gt; animals that received relatively low doses of fluoride showed ADD-<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; symptoms and hyperactivity.<br/>
&gt; There has also been research showing it lowers IQs, etc, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The US Center for Diseas Control has stated that fluoride helps <br/>
teeth when<br/>
&gt; it is applied topically, not necessarily when ingested.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; EPA scientists have attempted action against the EPA itself for <br/>
failing to<br/>
&gt; protect public health when it comes to fluoridation of water.<br/>
&gt; During 1986-87, in a survey of 39,207 children between the ages of <br/>
5 and 17,<br/>
&gt; the US National Institute for Dental Research found children living <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; fluoridated areas had 18% less tooth decay than children living in<br/>
&gt; non-fluoridated areas, based on Decayed, Missing and Filled tooth <br/>
Surfaces.<br/>
&gt; Additional corrections raised this to 25%.  However, in areas that <br/>
were<br/>
&gt; high-decay the rate of decay actually increased in neighborhoods <br/>
that had<br/>
&gt; fluoridated water (9.4%)<br/>
&gt; In other studies, including the largest ever carried out (400,000 <br/>
students)<br/>
&gt; showed that tooth decay actually increased when fluoride was added <br/>
to water.<br/>
&gt; It is important to know exactly the number involved when making the <br/>
decision<br/>
&gt; (is it that important?).<br/>
&gt; In 1944, the Journal of the American Dental Association reported: <br/>
``With 1.6<br/>
&gt; to 4 ppm fluoride in the water, 50 percent or more past age 24 have <br/>
false<br/>
&gt; teeth because of fluoride damage to their own.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fluoride compounds in fluordiated water is toxic waste and is often<br/>
&gt; contaminated with lead, arsenic, and radio nuclides (something to <br/>
think<br/>
&gt; about if you live in a fluoridated area like I do).<br/>
&gt; It has also been linked to excessive hip fractures.  fluoride <br/>
builds up in<br/>
&gt; the bones and causes bad changes to the bone structure.<br/>
&gt; In the UK one study showed that perinatal deaths was 15% higher <br/>
than in<br/>
&gt; non-fluoridated areas.<br/>
&gt; China, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, <br/>
The<br/>
&gt; Netherlands, Hungary, and Japan have all rejected, banned, or <br/>
stopped<br/>
&gt; fluoridation of their water for various reasons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For some information on where fluoride comes from and its effect on <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; human body, one possible site is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bruha.com/fluoride/">http://www.bruha.com/fluoride/</a><br/>

Nope, it wouldn&#39;t. The permanent teeth don&#39;t finish forming until well after <br/>
birth, and their structure can be changed by all sorts of things at the time <br/>
they&#39;re forming. <br/>
<br/>
Enamel flourosis isn&#39;t decay, although it can lead to decay, because in <br/>
severe cases the teeth are hard to clean properly, having pits and fissures.<br/>

You&#39;re right.  I was thinking of baby teeth.  Kirby and Holly both had crummy <br/>
baby teeth but their permanent teeth seem much better.  Marty has the teeth <br/>
of the other side of the family, and they were always straight and strong.<br/>

Interested in this, Sandra, I had heard that weak spots <br/>
in &#39;baby&#39; teeth could someitems be caused by illness or <br/>
stress in pregnancy, and it could be traced by the <br/>
pattern of weakness, ie if the damamge was at the tips <br/>
then it would relate to some event at about the time <br/>
the teeth start growing.  Do you know of a different <br/>
explanation?<br/>
