&gt; <br/>
&gt; More and more newer bathrooms found in malls and such are using the &quot;family&quot;<br/>
&gt; bathroom. I think this is great! And its about time! My problem with this was<br/>
&gt; that my then 4-5 yr old never wants to wait until the rest of us are finished,<br/>
&gt; and is always trying to unlock the door. Therefore, my potty breaks have<br/>
&gt; always<br/>
&gt; been done as quickly as the consumption of my food during a lunch break. I<br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; wish I had the energy level that kids do. </span></blockquote></div>
