<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544352995">Sandra, I loved your article on respect. So I have a question along those<br/>
lines of respecting choices and how to put that into practice when it comes<br/>
up against other things. Here&#39;s my current for-instance: my son hates baths,<br/>
bathing, showers, etc. basically anything to do with washing and water. So<br/>
it&#39;s not generally something I force on him, and usually he gets clean when<br/>
we go swimming once or twice a week (he doesn&#39;t mind showering afterwards as<br/>
much as normal because he hates being itchy from the chlorine even more). In<br/>
the last two weeks, we haven&#39;t been able to get to the pool though and he&#39;s<br/>
starting to get a little...um...ripe. In fact, when DH got in the car<br/>
yesterday, he thought he had stepped in dog poop, the smell was that bad. So<br/>
today I&#39;m insisting on a bath or shower, just for common courtesy to others<br/>
(we&#39;re carpooling someplace this afternoon, for instance, and I don&#39;t think<br/>
it&#39;s right to submit others to that kind of enclosed aroma).<br/>
I guess my question for others is this: How do you go about respecting their<br/>
choices and their bodies when those choices cause problems in other areas<br/>
(like assaulting someone else&#39;s nose!). My son has some fairly severe<br/>
sensory issues, and we&#39;ve come up against this before. Teeth brushing was a<br/>
bad one. For two years, I just avoided forcing him to brush his teeth<br/>
because he hated it so much. Then, after $2000 worth of dental work on him<br/>
(two of his teeth were so rotten they broke), I decided I was going to force<br/>
the issue (before that, I had of course tried everything else under the<br/>
sun - singing teeth brushing songs, buying books about dentists and teeth<br/>
brushing, buying cool electric toothbrushes in the shapes of race cars, 18<br/>
different flavors of toothpaste, etc. etc.). It still never felt like a good<br/>
choice, because he hated it so much, but I felt I had ran out of options. So<br/>
how do you go about this when it is unlikely that anytime soon they are<br/>
going to start voluntarily (taking baths, brushing teeth, etc.).<br/>
I did sit down and have a talk with my son this morning about why the bath<br/>
is important, and offered to build some Alpha Team Lego subs with him to<br/>
take in the bath, that has made for grudging acceptance. But I still know he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t do it if I wasn&#39;t forcing the issue (forcing as in me saying, we<br/>
can&#39;t carpool with his friends if he doesn&#39;t bathe).<br/>

<br/>
This is becoming an issue at our house as well.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been lucky in the dental area to find a wonderful dentist that works great with him (not &quot;on&quot; him, and it&#39;s taken them a couple years of appts to get this far), and she seals all his new teeth as they emerge etc.  He even managed a filling in her chair this year!  Wahoo!<br/>
<br/>
I have never made a big deal about baths/showers, but now that puberty is starting (yikes, already?!) the body odour has become issue with the rest of the family over the last couple of months.  When he was younger toys and/or bubbles would usually interest him at least once a week, but that&#39;s no longer the case.  And although he&#39;s really looking forward to swimming in our pool, it&#39;s still too cold here right now to dive in.  However, that will only delay the issue for a few months anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also really appreciate some discussion/feedback on this topic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973401837">When I was in eighth grade, in science class I sat myself down and <br/>
the boy next to me (Randy something. Red hair) said &quot;When did you <br/>
last take a shower??!?!&quot; and it hit me: it had been three weeks. :( <br/>
<br/>
Do you know, I carried a great deal of bitterness towards my mother <br/>
over that. A boy at school is the first to notice that I stink? Where <br/>
WAS my mom? I wasn&#39;t gross out of disrespect or disobedience. In my <br/>
case, it was simple cluelessness. I washed my hair under the faucet <br/>
every day...no shower...so didn&#39;t look greasy. but I stank. <br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re talking about respect, and doing what we can to see things <br/>
from the kids point of view, once we&#39;ve asked him/her why it is so <br/>
awful to get clean (try to get a feel for why he doesn&#39;t want to take <br/>
a bath,) and then tell him &quot;I respect your privacy in this matter, <br/>
but I can&#39;t stand to be around you, and other people can&#39;t, either. <br/>
You smell bad.&quot; I mean, tell it like it is. If you are respecting him <br/>
about the showering, then does the respect go both ways? Should your <br/>
nostrils be assaulted by his odor? <br/>
<br/>
This is an area where kids need lots of parental involvement. <br/>
Brushing teeth and bathing, should be &quot;what we do every day&quot; Part of <br/>
your daily routine. I mean, esp. in the health dept. of life: while <br/>
you are my kid, I&#39;m paying your medical bills, and you will be <br/>
healthier by staying clean and keeping your teeth clean. And maybe it <br/>
will take coercion to get it done...<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps. We haven&#39;t run into this problem. Like I say, I had it <br/>
as a kid, but that was from a neglectful mother. I doubt you&#39;re just <br/>
not noticing his stench. LOL<br/>
<br/>
sorry. I feel like I haven&#39;t been much help. Just venting a bit, I <br/>
guess. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heidi, I agree completely with what you&#39;ve said.    I have this same problem <br/>
with Ethan.  It just comes down to, we can&#39;t stand to be around him.  Its <br/>
offensive, no, its disgusting ( I let him get THAT bad)  His body odor and <br/>
his foot odor both.  ( he won&#39;t wear socks with his shoes)   When we can not <br/>
stand to be around him, and he does not want to go into another room,  I make <br/>
him take a bath.  I have not found another solution.  I have talked to him, <br/>
very respectfully, about WHY he needs to bathe.  He understands about body <br/>
odor.  Heck, we all get it sometimes and he finds it offensive too.   It&#39;s <br/>
not like he does not understand foul odors.  I have picked Landon up from.   <br/>
working outside in the field and  he reeks!  And Ethan does not want to sit <br/>
next to him in the van until Landon can get home to take a shower.  I have <br/>
taken that opportunity to explain that is how we feel when he (Ethan) stinks. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  Sometimes, when he really stinks, and we are going somewhere, I give him <br/>
the option of bathing or staying at home.  He usually chooses to stay at <br/>
home.  Sometimes, I do not have the option of leaving him at home, so I make <br/>
him bathe.  I have to physically walk him into the bathroom, turn the water <br/>
on for him, and then repeatedly check to make sure he gets in the shower.   <br/>
Then I have to remind him to put on deodorant.  I will let him just &quot;wash up&quot; <br/>
under his arms as often as that gets him by.   I buy antibacterial wipes for <br/>
him to use. <br/>
<br/>
 Still, the bottom line is, when he stinks so bad that we can not stand to be <br/>
near him, and/or we have to go be around other people,  I make him take a <br/>
shower.   I wish I didn&#39;t have to, but I DO think it is a matter of <br/>
respecting other folks too.   The only reason he will give as to why he will <br/>
not shower is &quot;because I don&#39;t want to&quot;  Basically, he does not want to take <br/>
the time to do it.  Lots of folks would call it &quot;too lazy&quot;.   Maybe if <br/>
someone outside of our family told him he stinks, it would have more weight <br/>
to it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-895263432">It&#39;s funny.. I just sent my last post about Ethan.. Then he comes in for a <br/>
goodnight kiss from his Dad, he hugs Dh and Dh says.. &quot;eeww tacos&quot;..  Ethan <br/>
just giggles.   Dh says, &quot;Ethan, maybe you should go take a shower&quot;   Ethan <br/>
says, Nah, and goes to bed.<br/>

OK OK.. LIVE NEWS.. Big topic.. unfolding right now..<br/>

anybody ever talk about or discuss how thier husband gripes all the time <br/>
about thier wives not doing any housework?<br/>

I say, uhh, well.. I cant remember anybody saying thier husband gripes about <br/>
it.. Well, yeah, I think maybe some have.. I can&#39;t recall specifically.. (Im <br/>

<br/>
He says, &quot;what, they all just keep thier mouths shut and do it ( the <br/>
housework) themselves?&quot;  I say.. uhh, well, you want me to ask them?<br/>
<br/>
He says&#39; &quot;no, I just figured you told everybody how awful I was for fussing <br/>
at you for not doing housework&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I say,  &quot;Uhm, no, I&#39;ve mentioned several times how bad of a housekeeper I am, <br/>
but I havent told them you give me grief for it. Here, let me ask, I&#39;ll see <br/>
what other folks have to say&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 He says, &quot;What, you think they will all just say what  a dumbass I am for <br/>
wanting you to do more housework?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761827392">Okay, I&#39;m having a hard time understanding this. Sincerely not condemning,<br/>
just wondering how the whole not bathing thing gets so bad that a kid<br/>
smells?<br/>
Around here, from the time our children were very little, bathing and teeth<br/>
brushing was always just something that we all did. They saw us do it and<br/>
although I never have said &quot;you have to bath or shower or brush your teeth&quot;<br/>
it has always been something we just all do. No arguments about it or them<br/>
saying they don&#39;t want to do it. Well maybe once or twice I can remember<br/>
when the kids just didn&#39;t feel like it, it was late, they hadn&#39;t been out<br/>
and one night went by without. But never more than one night. Okay, never<br/>
more than one night of not getting wet. We have a pool so sometimes if the<br/>
kids are in late that&#39;s their shower except Sierra gets rinsed and her hair<br/>
washed out because of her curls and chlorine!<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m just thinking that when a child gets used to it, showering or<br/>
bathing every night, then they feel odd not having one instead of the other<br/>
way around. Now sensory problems aside on this one as I understand how that<br/>
would complicate things. I would also think that if I actually waited until<br/>
my children would ask for a bath or shower, then I have no idea how long<br/>
they would go without one. But we don&#39;t wait and don&#39;t let time go by,<br/>
started when they were little and have never run into that problem.<br/>

It&#39;s interesting how a pessimist thinks.  He doesn&#39;t say &quot;you don&#39;t do<br/>
*enough* housework to suit him&quot; his quote says &quot;... not doing *any*<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I assigned my brain to remember where the long and really fruitful discussion <br/>
was about teens bathing.   My brain is not coming up with it, except maybe it <br/>
was at www.unschooling.com.  I know it was when Elissa&#39;s oldest son, who had <br/>
been living with his dad, came to live with her.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone remember whereabout and wheneabout that discussion was?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428148221">A couple of months ago my husband and I had a pretty big late night<br/>
fight, ostensibly about the sorry state of our apartment. From my POV he<br/>
was being a totalitarian, and lazy, jerk who expected me to do<br/>
everything, while my priorities were looking after Jayn instead of the<br/>
house. He refused to see that any of it was in any way partly his<br/>
responsibility. (I should add he is not working.) As the argument<br/>
progressed the true state of things eventually came out. It turned out<br/>
that he thought I didn&#39;t love him anymore, and feared I was planning to<br/>
leave him, and that&#39;s why I wasn&#39;t paying attention to his home and<br/>
laundry and stuff. Of course this came as an immense surprise to me,<br/>
that he so strongly viewed my taking care of the house as being loving<br/>
towards him. We tell each other we love other all the time, so I was<br/>
floored that he could feel this doubtful. We had been snapping at each<br/>
other for days before the fight, and were certainly crying together<br/>
afterwards. I have tried harder and he has become more relaxed,<br/>
appreciative and pleasant. Still won&#39;t pick up his own socks, let alone<br/>
any of Jayn&#39;s toys, but I have stopped expecting, or more accurately<br/>
hoping, for that to happen. If I need help I have to ask for it, because<br/>
he will absolutely not take the initiative. I&#39;m getting to where that is<br/>
OK.<br/>

and it has actually turned out to be a wonderful thing because we have been <br/>
able to get tons of stuff done on our property and home until he gets called <br/>
back.  But I know when he is not working, he feels much more vulnerable...maybe <br/>
it&#39;s a primal thing...not &quot;hunting and bringing in the meat&quot; makes them feel <br/>
very useless and unnecessary.  It&#39;s great that you can recognize it, it makes <br/>
all the difference if you can understand what&#39;s behind the way they are <br/>

Are you doing OK financially?  Have him take a look at Ebay, it has helped us <br/>

could go for a while and just smell fine.<br/>

Then puberty hit. I have been in a car filled with young pubescent people, <br/>
and I can tell you that I know what hell must be like! My god, they stink!<br/>

Well, I guess some kids are just really resistant to bathing regularly, but <br/>
when puberty first hits...watch out!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ethan is my only child whom I have had this problem with.   He is 11 1/2, and <br/>
the &#39;stinkiness&quot; just started since he began puberty a few months ago.   It <br/>
is very weird.  Yeah, they all take baths &quot;normally&quot;, routinely,  a daily or <br/>
every other day thing with no complaints at all.  They have all enjoyed baths as <br/>
younger children.. LOVED taking baths and it was never an issue.  As Landon <br/>
and Anna got older, it was just a smooth transition.  They just bathed when <br/>
they needed to.. They wanted to be clean.  I&#39;ve never had to tell Landon or Anna <br/>
that they need to shower or wash thier hair or anything concerning hygiene.    <br/>
When Ethan was younger ( just up until the past  year or so)  bath time was <br/>
also a non issue.  As a matter of fact, he would sometimes take a bath 2 or 3 <br/>
times a day just to play in the water.   Honestly, I have no idea why he now <br/>
refuses to take a shower.   Its like, he hit puberty, so, he started having body <br/>
odor ( he has to be reminded to put deodorant on too, and he balks at that).. <br/>
And, then, he just decided he didn&#39;t want to take showers anymore because he <br/>
really NEEDED to.  <br/>
<br/>
 With Ethan, he pretty much refuses anything the feels like the HAS to do.   <br/>
Maybe it does all come from his school experiences.   And, in other areas of <br/>
stuff, I just let it go, don&#39;t insist ( well, except when sometimes he has to <br/>
go somewhere with us and he does not want to)  But with the bathing, I get to a <br/>
point where I have to insist.  <br/>

don&#39;t , none , all, always.. etc&quot;   He does it to me and to the kids too. <br/>
<br/>
  That trait of his has been a point of contention for our whole marriage.  <br/>
He applies to to EVERYTHING, even sex.  Say we havent had sex in a few days, <br/>
he starts getting upset and resentful.  He acts like we never have sex.  <br/>
Insinuates I am not attracted to him, that I do not want to &quot;be with&quot; <br/>
him...The truth is I am probably too tired, or I have a lot on my mind, or <br/>
maybe I am just not in the mood.  Talking turns to arguing, and I usually <br/>
just give in.<br/>
<br/>
 Talk about coercing.. my husband is the KING of it.  His way of getting me <br/>
to do something that HE wants me to do is to badger, gripe, accuse, harrass, <br/>
and guilt  me into it.   <br/>

uncomfortable with his changing body.    We do do all of the things <br/>
suggested.. Baby wipe wash ups,  sink wash ups and shampoos.   These things <br/>
work for about 2-3 weeks.. Then, by then, he gets so &quot;bad&quot;  he just has to <br/>
get in the shower and really lather up.   I&#39;m thining too that when he get <br/>
more through puberty, maybe another 6 months or so, he will fall back into a <br/>
routine of bathing ( I HOPE).  You know, with Anna and Landon, they became <br/>
more aware of thier hygiene when they began puberty and they started taking <br/>
more showers and all that stuff.  <br/>

everyone really notices when you do take a bath or shower.  You are the only <br/>
one who smells clean. LOL  And one benefit you can tell him is that the bugs <br/>
find you less attractive also.  They would always attack the one that smelled <br/>
like soap, deodorant or perfume.  LOL<br/>

never, ever let me brush his teeth without a struggle when he was younger,<br/>
and he *hated* water. Even at 4 1/2, he wouldn&#39;t go in a swimming pool. I<br/>

it. Not wanting to take the time to do it if they&#39;re busy playing. Puberty.<br/>
Just not liking the feel of it, even if they don&#39;t have sensory issues. I<br/>
know that I hated showers as a kid, didn&#39;t like the way the water felt<br/>
hitting my body. Loved baths but hated getting my hair washed. I can see how<br/>
it could occur for different kids. The question is more that given that some<br/>
kids *don&#39;t* like it, how can you respectfully get them to do it. Not easy!<br/>

<br/>
could temperature changes be part of the issue?  personally, i don&#39;t like <br/>
showering when the bathroom is cold.  i just know that getting wet won&#39;t be <br/>
comfortable, and stepping out of the warm shower will be even worse.  (i do <br/>
it anyway, don&#39;t worry!  well, as often as i can... i have 2-year-old twins <br/>
and a 4-year-old son...)  i imagine that if i had sensory issues, it&#39;d be <br/>
worse.<br/>
<br/>
maybe you could try having a space heater in the bathroom?  if the dry <br/>
towel & clothes are ready and in reach, that can help too.  if his hair is <br/>
long, maybe he could wear an extra shirt until his hair is dry enough that <br/>
it won&#39;t saturate his clothes.<br/>
<br/>
i hope this helps,<br/>

<br/>
So much showering is probably another unnatural cleaning situation.  When <br/>
people don&#39;t shower they smell like people, and people communicate things with <br/>
their scents that the culture doesn&#39;t want communicated.   We&#39;re supposed to <br/>
wash up, keep our hands to ourselves, don&#39;t stare at each other, and just use our <br/>
words.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Use your words like a big boy,&quot; I think Dr. Evil said to Mini Me.<br/>
<br/>
When people don&#39;t shower and get into their natural state, they unconsciously <br/>
can broadcast desire and fear, and that&#39;s just tacky (according to this <br/>
culture which keeps telling people they have no instincts remaining, but must learn <br/>
everything out of books).  I was told just that in school when I was a kid!  <br/>
That one of the hallmarks of humanity was that unlike birds and dogs, we&#39;re <br/>
born knowing nothing, and it all has to be inserted through the written word of <br/>
those who came before us, discovered things, and wrote them down.  Without <br/>
that, we would each be born ignorant and just stay that way.<br/>
<br/>
It totally discounted traditional knowledge like how to cook and how to build <br/>
a house.  The existence of cookbooks and houseplans seemed to be in their <br/>
favor!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying to let one wild kid spoil our existing tradition to wash, <br/>
wash, wash!  I&#39;m just acknolwedging what I think might be the basis for our <br/>
insistence on washing.  We&#39;re ignoring an entire facet of biology for a reason.  <br/>
Civilization exists as it does because courtship involves dates and gifts, not <br/>
passing by and getting a whiff that someone&#39;s interested in you.  And The <br/>
Institution of Marriage depends on not getting whiffs of people at work or out in <br/>
public.  So tell him to wash for the sake of western civilization.<br/>

something nice about missing when he was little, but being proud of (something <br/>

They also like to remember I loved the little boy I still remember so well.<br/>

Judging by the gaming shop (LOTS of boys in fairly windowless area, being <br/>

they do later on.  It settles out, or they start washing more, or both.<br/>

I guess I&#39;m just thinking that when a child gets used to it, showering or bathing every night, then they feel odd not having one instead of the other way around. Now sensory problems aside on this one as I understand how that would complicate things. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of sensory issues with son Joseph but up until now there were a couple techniques that worked reasonably well when it came to getting in the bath or shower.<br/>
<br/>
One was what I&#39;d call &quot;go with the flow&quot;, for lack of a better term.  Every few days I&#39;d tell all the kids that it was bath or shower night (so it wasn&#39;t a surprise).  That evening I&#39;d start with one of younger kids who didn&#39;t mind, and Joseph would likely come upstairs since that&#39;s where we all were.  When the others were done I&#39;d just say &quot;your turn&quot;, and engage him in some interesting conversation, about his current video game or a recent fun activity, while I helped him take off his clothes.  Quite often he just &quot;went with the flow&quot; and got in the shower.  Other times he walk into the bathroom, hear the running water, tense up and say &quot;I just can&#39;t tonight, Mom&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If that happened a couple times in a row I&#39;d go with plan B, where I&#39;d tell him it&#39;s been quite a while since he last washed his body, would he like to have a bath or a shower?  I&#39;d mention he could bring up some plastic character toys to play with and I&#39;d colour the water or make bubbles if he&#39;d like for a bath or, if he&#39;s busy with something, a shower is really quick and he can get back to it. Sometimes he&#39;d say &quot;neither&quot;, but after a day or two he was usually clean.<br/>
<br/>
However, neither of these things have been working the last couple of months.  I&#39;ve been thinking about it though and the timing seems to coincide with his more obvious signs of puberty i.e. hair growth and body odour.  Joseph has never been one to  &quot;embrace&quot; change at the best of times, and this is some change!!  I&#39;m thinking he may be uncomfortable with his physically changing body and avoiding showers/baths for that reason.  Right now all we can do when we go out is a wipedown with a cloth and a fresh shirt, and the occasional hairwash in the sink.<br/>
<br/>
So what I&#39;m doing now is trying to make him more comfortable with the changes by mentioning them in conversation when we&#39;re alone.  He doesn&#39;t want to talk much about it, but I figure if he hears me talking/knowing about the changes to expect he will see that they are normal.  And then hopefully time will help him get used to his &quot;new&quot; body.  With swimming season around the corner this should give us a few months leeway!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Any other suggestions for helping him get used to this new stage of his life?<br/>

&lt;&lt;Now Dallen has discovered the greatness in a shower.  He will stand under<br/>
the<br/>
shower until it runs cold.  LOL&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention the flip side of that. Same problem here too!!!<br/>
But I have 3 so far that just love to stay in the shower and play!!! Alyssa<br/>
is the only one that gets in and out pretty quickly unless she showers with<br/>
me and then she stays in the whole time. Of course Tara&#39;s excuse is her<br/>
shaving and having so much head hair to wash.......sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833113864">this post reminds me of a time in a grocery store. a friend and I <br/>
were going up and down the aisles &quot;hunter-gathering&quot; LOL and once in <br/>
awhile, a whiff would hit us. It wasn&#39;t entirely pleasant, but not <br/>
100% yucky, either. There was definitely B.O. in there, but also <br/>
garlic. Strong scent. Not an unclean BO, either. Just Odor of Body, <br/>
with strong garlic overtones. <br/>
<br/>
Lo, and behold, if we didn&#39;t meet up with the source of this strong, <br/>
interesting, difficult odor: a dark haired, dark eyed, nutmeg skinned <br/>
man. Middle-eastern looking, for sure, or possibly Indian. <br/>
Actually, thinking about it, the man was definitely Indian. My friend <br/>
was gagging, I was going &quot;wow. He&#39;s sending out his message loud and <br/>
clear, idn-ee?&quot; I think, in his culture, anyone would have <br/>
known &quot;Here comes a man&quot; without seeing him.<br/>
<br/>
Now! there is also (or was. Haven&#39;t seen them for a long time) a <br/>
couple in Pocatello, live in a trailer in a parking lot near the <br/>
train tracks. And their odor is one of Filthy Human: urine, sweat, <br/>
halitosis, etc. Unhealthy. You could smell THEM before you saw them, <br/>
too. They looked bad, too. Dirty clothing, greasy uncombed hair. You <br/>
wanted to feel sorry for them, but it was very difficult being near <br/>
them. bleh.<br/>
<br/>
The Indian fellow, he was dressed nicely and looked well-to-do. so, <br/>
in that context, it is a shame that we&#39;ve gotten away from it, from <br/>
sending and receiving messages via odor. Not the dirty, unwashed, <br/>
living unhealthily smell, but the strong smell of a man who is <br/>
attracting attention on purpose. I betcha, that guy was vital and <br/>
strong-willed. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-800098029">**No one is this house takes a shower every day.  It just isn&#39;t done!! <br/>
lol  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not the only one am I??  **<br/>

<br/>
When my kid was little and bath-resistant, I didn&#39;t bathe him much more<br/>
than once a week, and he didn&#39;t smell.  I like baths and showers, now<br/>
that my kid is old enough to not pound on the door while I&#39;m in them, so<br/>
I often bathe twice a day for fun.  But I don&#39;t think every kid<br/>
everywhere has to have a bath every day.  My son made a turnaround and<br/>
likes getting wet, now, but he only bathes every two or three days.  If<br/>
I catch a whiff, I tell him he smells and he takes a bath.  But he<br/>
mostly likes baths.  My advice won&#39;t help a bath-hater.<br/>
