  I was getting those &quot;quarantined&quot; messages the other night.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
  worry about it.  I think yahoo or some other layer of provider is hiccuping <br/>
  and sending out weird messages.  I emailed Joyce about the messages the <br/>
  other night, and she didn&#39;t really know what was going on, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
  seem to be affecting anyone&#39;s ability to post.  Weird, though.<br/>

  &gt; &gt; My last message seems to have posted but I got an email<br/>
  &gt;saying it was<br/>
  &gt; &gt; being quarantined for containing banned content!<br/>

  &gt;I got a similar message and my message posted just fine and<br/>
  &gt;all it was was a thank you!<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Not sure what&#39;s up...<br/>
