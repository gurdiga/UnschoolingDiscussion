<div id="ygrps-yiv-54808506">Sandra, this is a great article! Can you explain the 2 things below <br/>
and where to get them? I am not familiar with them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - two or more matching geoboards and colored rubber bands (you could <br/>
&gt; get just<br/>
&gt; one, but then you can&#39;t copy each other&#39;s designs)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; - Cuisenaire rods if you can get them for less than full price (or if <br/>
&gt; you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; rich), but don&#39;t worry about the &quot;real&quot; exercises<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;d say  look them up at google.com so you can see pictures of them.  They&#39;re <br/>
both math tools/toys.<br/>
<br/>
If you live near an educational supply store, you could go in and ask to see <br/>
theirs.  I wouldn&#39;t pay full price for Cuisenaire rods, but you might find <br/>
some used or like on e-bay.   Look at pictures on websites and you might find <br/>
you&#39;ve seen some before but just didn&#39;t know the name.<br/>
