&lt;&lt; Rank? I never even THOUGHT of rank before this thread.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

I never did really, either.  Rank....I don&#39;t care if your the Pope, or the <br/>
President, if I have issues with you, you&#39;re gonna hear about it~~  ( And I have <br/>
issues with both of them!)  <br/>
<br/>
If someone thinks they have rank or authority over me, they better think <br/>
again about whether *I* gave it to them, or not, because they can&#39;t assume <br/>
anything.  For example, I didn&#39;t vote for Bush and I&#39;m not Catholic!!  Mua ha ha ha <br/>
ha.......<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-967236550">Respect needs to be earned, not expected.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gotta say I agree with this.<br/>
<br/>
My parents always expected respect, even when they didn&#39;t earn it.<br/>
<br/>
I refuse to live that way.  I don&#39;t care who a person is, they will *earn* my respect.<br/>
<br/>
Those who earn my respect (who I also may not know personally) would include people who have had to earn their own way from the bottom up.<br/>
<br/>
I dont necessarily respect the President or the Queen of England just bec. of their title or the fact that someone else thought they&#39;d be a great leader.  And if I were invited into their presence and did not respect them, I&#39;d probably decline the invitation, with an explanation to make my point.<br/>
<br/>
As for employers, I may or may not respect my boss, but the choice to show respect has more to do with whether or not I value my job.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose you could argue that the boss has rank and the power to fire me, so I have to show them respect or lose my job.  But in reality, the choice to show respect, and my reasons for doing it are entirely MINE.<br/>

Not if they don&#39;t choose to listen they won&#39;t hear about it!<br/>

<br/>
There are lots of people with rank and authority over you, and there would be <br/>
no matter where you lived.  You can&#39;t be human and escape it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Respect needs to be earned, not expected.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unless you earned their respect they would never have to hear your opinion.<br/>
And if your opening move were anywhere in the range of not acknowledging <br/>
their rank, you couldn&#39;t earn their respect.<br/>

Yeah, sure, whatever!  BUT if you needed to make an introduction (which was <br/>
the original example) would you know how to decide which person, at that <br/>
second, was in the position of honor and should have someone introduced to him or <br/>
her?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254707368">If I were with someone prominent, yes.<br/>
<br/>
But if I am at a family gathering, I don&#39;t worry about who to introduce when, I just do the introductions however they come up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid I may have missed the original example..you might have to refresh my memory.<br/>

Hmm, that sounds like circular logic to me. I don&#39;t think people have to <br/>
respect each other&#39;s rank in order to hear each other&#39;s opinions. <br/>
