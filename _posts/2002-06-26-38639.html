<div id="ygrps-yiv-423576327">I joined this group several months ago. I never introduced myself because<br/>
there was a lot of bickering going on at the time and I wanted to get the<br/>
feel of the group. Sadly, the bickering never went away but I did. I went no<br/>
mail  for a month and tried again. Same bickering, different topic. I went<br/>
no mail for another month and now I&#39;m here again. Same bickering, different<br/>
topic. I&#39;m going to unsub now because I think I now truly have the feel of<br/>
the group. Sad.....some people might come here looking to see what<br/>
unschooling families are like and be very discouraged. Not me, though. I do<br/>
know what unschoolers are like. They aren&#39;t like this.<br/>

<br/>
In high school debating, people argue points they don&#39;t believe, for practice.<br/>
<br/>
This is real life.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who doesn&#39;t believe you learn a lot from real life is going to have a <br/>
TRULY hard time unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to write anything I haven&#39;t tried, thought about really hard, <br/>
or had working well for many years, and I usually try to clarify which (if <br/>
not all of those) applies.<br/>

meant personally at all, and this was one of those.  I&#39;m surprised that it <br/>
even looks like bickering to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100220499">Oops, I must admit that I was not ever on a debate team in High School, just<br/>
to clarify....to clarify what????  Oh, that it was not the correct way to<br/>
phrase what I was trying to say...<br/>

I was under the influence of a terrible, horrible migraine headache when I<br/>
wrote that, so maybe that was my problem.  My Mom took the boys for me so<br/>
that I could go to bed, but I just needed to check my email first.  Should<br/>
of not responded....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, I thought it was a good initial analogy to get the idea across. :-) But<br/>
the analogy does break down in the details. I wasn&#39;t on the debate team<br/>
either but I got some insight into HS debate during one discussion on the<br/>
message board where someone said the point of debate was to win, implying<br/>
any tactics that furthered that goal -- she may have used some nasty names<br/>
or something -- were fair.<br/>
<br/>
But real life debates are about digging with honesty and clarity through<br/>
foggy thinking towards some central Truth. Which is incompatible with a goal<br/>
of winning for to set one&#39;s sights on winning means truth, honesty and<br/>
clarity can be sacrificed.<br/>
