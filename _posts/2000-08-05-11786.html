<div id="ygrps-yiv-978126160">Hi Evelyn:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a Personal  Coach... I work with individuals, small businesses and <br/>
corporations on finding the balance in life with regards to work, <br/>
relationships, spirituality, volunteering, emotional and physical health and <br/>
having fun and enjoying life.  I teach people how to take care of themselves <br/>
first so they can take care of everything else in their lives.  I teach <br/>
people how to schedule their lives, stop being drained by people, places and <br/>
things, organize their finances, give back to their community, do something <br/>
that&#39;s fun, work on their spiritual side and relax.  I have several clients <br/>
that homeschool their kids and many more that want to and don&#39;t know how to <br/>
get the balance in their lives to accomplish that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for giving me the opportunity to put that down in again.  Each time I <br/>
get the opportunity to do that affirms that I&#39;m in the right place in my <br/>
life.  Doing what I love in my life affords my husband and I the opportunity <br/>
to be with our kids.<br/>

Yes Candice it is an incredible job.  However luck has nothing to do with <br/>
it...(LOL)  wish that it did.  It took me a long time to figure out what I <br/>
wanted to do and then had to go and do it.  It&#39;s certainly worth following my <br/>
dreams of having my kids at home and having a business that I can work around <br/>
them.<br/>

to do something similar.  I have some ideas, but don&#39;t know how to start.<br/>
