walk or ride the couple of blocks from the White House to the Willard Hotel, <br/>
and sit in the lobby of the Willard smoking a cigar and drinking brandy. Once <br/>
people learned of this habit, some people who wanted political favors, or to <br/>
try to convince Grant to do something they wanted done, would come over to <br/>
the hotel when he was there and talk to him in the lobby of the Willard <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078819550">&quot;According to the dictionary, lobbyists are people who try to influence the <br/>
voting of legislators or to procure the passage of a bill.  According to <br/>
folklore, the term lobbying goes back to the days of President Grant.  He <br/>
would walk from the White House to the Willard Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue <br/>
in Washington, D.C.   President Grant would sit in the lobby and citizens <br/>
would come and talk to him and ask him to do things.  Thus, the term lobbyist <br/>
was coined.  &quot;<br/>

sometimes hitch rides on produce coming from the jungles and arrive like <br/>
illegal aliens off the boats!<br/>
<br/>
I asked my husband about this, since he was the one (stationed in the <br/>
Marines) in the Philippines and he said that the so called banana spiders <br/>
there really aren&#39;t banana spiders (just called that). They are some sort of <br/>
tarantula. They are elongated in shape and have a golden colored abdomen. <br/>
They weave these huge webs that are very strong, and if a person walks into <br/>
one he would need help extracting himself due to the fact that the strength <br/>
of the web and the stickiness makes it hard to get out of. <br/>
Then he told me about these little snakes that live in the jungle up in trees <br/>
there. They hang down and *catch* rides on the guys packs as the guys pass <br/>
under them. The problem with this is they call the creatures two-step snakes. <br/>
When I asked why that was a problem, Darin said if the snake decides he <br/>
doesn&#39;t like the ride and bites you, two-steps and you are dead! <br/>
I think I will be staying out of the jungle for now!<br/>

<br/>
I saw that in a Tarzan movie.<br/>
They were in the  desert, in the Sahara, and RIGHT THERE, like a line in the <br/>
sand, the jungle started, and Jane went into the jungle and she was totally <br/>
stuck in a spider web.  No wait.  Maybe Jane was in the man-eating plant <br/>
which grabbed her up to the shoulders in half a second, and Tarzan was stuck <br/>
in the Phillipino spider web.<br/>
<br/>
Wow.  Geography is so interesting.  I wonder in which part of Mexico they <br/>
filmed that?  <br/>
<br/>
(No, don&#39;t tell me, I know.  Tarzan didn&#39;t move to Mexico for filming until <br/>
the 70&#39;s TV show, and before that they were in some building in California.)<br/>
<br/>
The biggest spider I ever saw was a wolf spider about a foot across (legs) <br/>
with a body about five inches across.  He was all hairy like a tarantula, and <br/>
kind of orangish or some creepy color.  I was driving my van near Placitas, <br/>
New Mexico, on a dirt road, and had passed over him, not sure what I had <br/>
seen, parked and walked back.  He was fine, still moving across the road.   <br/>
We let him go, because I was sure if we had even poked at him he could have <br/>
emitted a kind of emergency signal and his thousands of speedy and nearby <br/>
relatives would have swarmed over us and eaten us, because I saw this Tarzan <br/>
movie one time, and so although I&#39;ve learned a lot from Tarzan movies, I do <br/>
know that the two elephants at the Rio Grande Zoo will NOT run to Placitas if <br/>
I yell.<br/>
<br/>
When there are spiders at my house someone yells for me.   Even my husband <br/>
hates spiders and will call me if he sees one.  I don&#39;t know all their names, <br/>
but I know if they&#39;re harmless window spiders who don&#39;t make too much web and <br/>
so are worth leaving alone (little jumping spiders who will eat flies), or <br/>
garden spiders who would rather be outside, or black widows who are being <br/>
sent to a quick reincarnation or eternal darkness.   <br/>
<br/>
I should get a field guide to spiders.<br/>

recluses, so I kill all jumping spiders! Most others I leave alone. We have <br/>
beautiful garden spiders, they have a large green abdomen with bright yellow <br/>
designs, and weave large webs that are just beautiful early in the morning <br/>
covered in dew.<br/>

We&#39;re having the worst drought here!! They might cut off irrigation; that&#39;s <br/>
bad.  I&#39;ve never seen that done in my whole life, and I&#39;m OLD!<br/>
<br/>
And Albuquerque might have to start processing river water for city water <br/>
instead of using mountain/reservoir/underground water this year.<br/>

And other places are wasting water making spider webs pretty.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL you scared me Sandra! I thought *geeze! I can&#39;t even spell dew right!* <br/>
Sorry about your drought! I hope it doesn&#39;t come to having to process the <br/>
river water! That is the way our water comes to us, and we have NASTY water! <br/>
It is chock full of minerals and chlorine and... just tastes gross. When we <br/>
make ice, there is a milky white area at the bottom of the cube, yet we get <br/>
all this literature with our bills that tell us how healthy our drinking <br/>
water is. The advertising guys who think up all this cr@p must get paid <br/>
bookoo bucks!<br/>
