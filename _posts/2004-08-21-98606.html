<div id="ygrps-yiv-838023241"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Donna writes:<br/>
&gt;  No, we&#39;re not going back to school, but we did go<br/>
&gt;shopping today <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I found myself walking down the &#39;school supplies&#39;<br/>
aisle today and caught myself mid sentence exclaiming<br/>
to my 3year old, &quot;Oh, look at all the ...art...<br/>
supplies&quot;.  I didn&#39;t know what else to call them; and,<br/>
I didn&#39;t feel the need to introduce the concept of<br/>
&#39;school supplies&#39; to him.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a vignette in my son&#39;s new Little Bill video<br/>
where Bill Cosby is psyching kids up for going to<br/>
kindergarten when they are 5.  I wish I could have<br/>
deleted that from the video *cringe*.  It&#39;s actually<br/>
pretty cute except for the kindergarten part.<br/>
