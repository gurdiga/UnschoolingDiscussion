Hi Shari. Welcome to this list and to the wonderful world of <br/>
unschooling. :o)<br/>

I think you&#39;ll find that the further you get into unschooling, the <br/>
less things like grade levels will come into play in your decision <br/>
making. I too have some ready book lists inspired from Charlotte <br/>
Mason. I don&#39;t &quot;assign&quot; them but they get read anyway. We love good <br/>
literature.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
