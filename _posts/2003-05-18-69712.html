Until last night, when we were at a Greek Festival and we looked at a booth <br/>
where they were offering a free popsicle for kids who completed a 10 or 12 <br/>
question quiz based on these posters about Greece.  He really wanted to do <br/>
it, even though we would have bought him all the popsicles he wanted (since <br/>
we were really there to pig out &lt;g&gt;).  I asked him if he wanted me to write <br/>
down the answers for him, assuming he&#39;d ask me to, but he wanted to do it <br/>
himself.  A first!<br/>
<br/>
So in this crowded noisy and sometimes hot place, he squatted down on the <br/>
cement and wrote probably 30 or 40 words.  I spelled almost all of them for <br/>
him, reminding my voice to be very patient or else this might end in <br/>
frustration like other times when I let that irritated tone creep into my <br/>
voice.  And he did it.  <br/>
<br/>
Very exciting.  But I do have to wonder why he was so motivated by a popsicle <br/>
prize?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-10958179">Wow, Pam that is wonderful.  Doesn&#39;t it feel amazing when they do it <br/>
on their own.  A few weeks ago me and my ds were playing with <br/>
stampers making heiroglyphics.  He loved the idea and I thought since <br/>
he hated writing it would be a great project for him, non stress.  To <br/>
my delight and suprise, he gave up on the stamps shortly and made his <br/>
own heiroglyphics, coloring and drawing all sorts of Egypt things for <br/>
over an hour!  That is the longest he has ever shown interst in <br/>
holding a pencil..LOL!<br/>

Maybe he was motivated by the challenge and not the popsicle?  It was a<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that happened to him. <br/>
I hope you can help him to not feel so bad about the whole thing.  <br/>
That&#39;s crappy.<br/>
<br/>
He never had a reason to have to write before, that&#39;s all.   Lots of<br/>
people aren&#39;t great at a thing if it&#39;s the first time they&#39;ve needed to<br/>
do it.   Someone  might have a heck of a time with driving a standard<br/>
transmission if all at once they&#39;re made to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Schools get kids writing early so they can demonstrate they&#39;re learning<br/>
stuff.   It&#39;s hard to do stacks of worksheets without writing.   But<br/>
unschoolers only need to write when they want or have their own reasons<br/>
to. <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t that he couldn&#39;t write well enough that was the problem in that<br/>
scenario, it was the others silly expectation of what he should be doing.<br/>
   Maybe you already told him that.   <br/>

I certainly need this, thanks for suggesting...another <br/>
question....are there other unschooling conferences east of the <br/>

I discovered the SC conference.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, we did talk about who had different expectations and that he <br/>
was being very hard on himself. A similiar thread here about <br/>
perfectionism reminds me how much Pete is also and that adds to the <br/>
way the situation panned out too. I feel he is ready to write now, <br/>
that he wants to write and was so in hopes the scout thing would be <br/>
the take-off. He has bounced back and I still think it will motivate <br/>
him. :) This summer he has a class at camp on Environmental Science. <br/>
At least it&#39;s only an hour long and not at 8am!<br/>

&quot;Sara, <br/>
Where do you live in NC? I live in Catawba County. I just &quot;met&quot; ( <br/>
online) another lady from HA-NC that lives a few miles from me. Nice <br/>
to see another NC&#39;er here.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Here in Canada they move from Cubs to Scouts at the grade 6 level.  He did<br/>
two years and then quit.  Both years had leadership difficulties, and the<br/>
boys got bored, fooled around, and got heck for it.  They did some fun stuff<br/>
but not enough to keep their interest.  There were also increasing conflicts<br/>
with his sports, which were taking a higher priority in his life.<br/>

Schooled kids learn to fake it. They learn not to admit when they don&#39;t <br/>
understand something, to either pretend that they do or to act as if whatever <br/>
it is too far beneath them to pay any attention to it. They learn to deflect <br/>
scrutiny from themselves. They learn how to scribble good looking nonsense if <br/>
they have problems with taking notes. And they learn not to let anyone know <br/>
they care. They learn that it isn&#39;t safe to show either frustration OR too <br/>
much enthusiasm - that either one can backfire.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I certainly did!  I could take notes and figure out what to write down, but I couldn&#39;t spell things correctly at all.  As late as 5th grade, I remember having spellings so imaginative that no one could decipher it but myself, and sometimes not even myself, if I came back to it later.  So, I never shared my notes and always made sure they were well covered so no one could comment on them.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps Pete could just pretend to keep up with the notes, while really just scribbling and paying attention.  Unless, of course, they have to be handed in, but they probably don&#39;t at Boy Scouts.  (Could be wrong).<br/>
