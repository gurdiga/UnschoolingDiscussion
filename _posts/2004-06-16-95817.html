<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686532827">Last night we were talking about our kids after 18 mos of unschooling. We are amazed at <br/>
them all, yet they don&#39;t fit even what our pictures of unschooling might look like. (So glad I <br/>
let go of those images - you know building science labs in the basement, publishing <br/>
novels at age ten and becoming musical prodigies...)<br/>
<br/>
We were discussing our son&#39;s love of Klingon. Noah told me he found Klingon because he <br/>
had clicked on the Google language preferences option. He tried out each of the <br/>
langauges to see how Google looked in that language. <br/>
<br/>
When he got to Klingon, he found it entirely fascinating and thus began what is now a six <br/>
month study of the language. He&#39;s got a notebook where he translates stuff he reads and <br/>
last night he showed me the first printed page of his personal Klingon dictationary.  All <br/>
from unlimited time on the computer...<br/>
<br/>
My 7 yo daughter yesterday shopped with me at Old Navy yesterday. She wanted to add up <br/>
her purchases on the way home and said, &quot;Yippee! Homeschool math.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
We worked through the adding, then we counted backwards, then we skip counted. She <br/>
had the best time. And it covered in one fifteen minute conversation what she had spent <br/>
six months trying to learn before unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I have no idea how she learned any of the computations she does on her fingers, but she&#39;s <br/>
doing them.<br/>
<br/>
My 9 yo son told me about some very complicated Internet game playing for Warcraft <br/>
(can&#39;t reproduce it here because I really have no clue about that game!) But I sat there with <br/>
jaw dropped at all that he&#39;s learned about the game, Internet ettiquette, and a host of <br/>
other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
So last night after talking about all this, my husband said...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You know, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a difference between learning subjects or learning what <br/>
interests you. It&#39;s all learning. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The important thing is that learning is happening and I just don&#39;t think it is in school for <br/>
many kids. The learning mechanism needs to be turned on and then the subject matter <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter at all... but if it&#39;s shut down or turned off, all the great educational ideas in <br/>
the world won&#39;t equal learning or education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes!<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s so cool, Julie, the whole story, and I&#39;m glad your husband is <br/>
enthusiastic.  I&#39;m glad he&#39;s not going to so nervous about how they&#39;ll compare to <br/>
other new college students.  <br/>
<br/>
Most of the kids I went to school with definitely had their learning <br/>
mechanisms turned off.  They had given up on caring, or finding things interesting.  <br/>
They went through school like zombies.<br/>
<br/>
I kept caring, and still do.  I don&#39;t know what the difference was.  But I <br/>
did get frustrated with the teachers, many of whom were likewise zombiefied and <br/>
didn&#39;t care.  They were going through the motions and rather than discuss math <br/>
or history or whatever *I* thought should have been their passion, they would <br/>
knock me out if the happy air with &quot;You don&#39;t need to know that this year&quot; or <br/>
&quot;That won&#39;t be on the test.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There were a few who WOULD talk about things.  Music teachers.  Art teachers. <br/>
 A couple of my English teachers were thrilled by a good question and would <br/>
actually talk about things I didn&#39;t need to know because they wouldn&#39;t &quot;be on <br/>
the test.&quot;  But I never personally remember a science teacher or math or <br/>
history who would.   If you knew their hobby or personal passion, you might get them <br/>
going for a little bit.  Mr. Clark, my New Mexico history teacher in 7th <br/>
grade, LOVED South America and could go on and on.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t care <br/>
about that.  Miss Gonzales, my 4th grade teacher, really liked  dinosaurs, and <br/>
history, and she would talk &quot;off duty.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But there was an undercurrent of what wasn&#39;t cool to do, and it wasn&#39;t cool <br/>
to WANT to know more just for fun, and it wasn&#39;t cool for teachers to do more <br/>
than they were being paid to do.   Luckily for me, I knew how to nose out those <br/>
who were willing to be uncool. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Trujillo, my 6th grade teacher, had a spark in him about nature and local <br/>
geography.  He was a sportsman, and also just had a good memory for who was <br/>
related to whom and where their grandparents lived.  Howard Gardner calls that <br/>
kind of categorization and thinking &quot;nature intelligence.&quot;  Mr. Trujillo knew <br/>
what and who things were and what they were related to and how.  That was fun <br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Felix, my band teacher from 5th to 9th, was a trivia bank.  When he knew <br/>
or cared about something he knew ALL about it.  Cuban drums.  John Phillip <br/>
Sousa.  When there was something he didn&#39;t know or care about that was fine, <br/>
because when he did know he lit up.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my memories of knowing where to find input and of knowing which <br/>
teachers were how were because I wanted to be a teacher from the time I was six, and <br/>
I was kind of out interviewing/apprenticing.  I noticed who was good with what <br/>
kinds of kids.  I wish I&#39;d had the overlay of the Gardner intelligence <br/>
theories then.  I&#39;d&#39;ve been ahead of my time. &lt;g&gt;  And it would have helped me see <br/>
WHY some of what I was seeing was happening.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching is an art.  Some are naturally good at it.  Some never click.  I <br/>
wonder if it&#39;s the other side of the love-to-learn coin?  Or whether it&#39;s just a <br/>
flexibility of stance that allows them to be upright when things change or <br/>
people are different around them.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s a good teacher, and he has lots of opportunity to practice, at the <br/>
karate dojo and the gaming shop and sometimes in the SCA, with younger kids.  He <br/>
organized a &quot;boffer seige&quot; at Outlandish, and helped coach kids to be safe <br/>
and efficient and work together.  Coaching, kind of, I suppose, but he designed <br/>
the scenario too, and persuaded adults to come and defend against his army of <br/>
40 kids, at 9:00 in the morning. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling needs some of that in the mix.  Kids who are joyful, <br/>
parents who are curious and hopeful and flexible.  The more the better, overall, <br/>
and some of it creates a lot more of itself.  <br/>
<br/>
School tells kids stuff is &quot;stupid.&quot;  Kids tell each other the subject matter <br/>
is stupid, and the teachers are stupid.  Teachers tell kids their little <br/>
friends are troublemakers to say &quot;stupid,&quot; and that the kids&#39; interests are <br/>
stupid.   And the kids can start to feel small and not trust their own judgment.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know exactly how I got through school feeling pretty whole and making my <br/>
own decisions about who I would listen to and why, but somehow I did.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You know, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a difference between learning subjects or <br/>
learning what <br/>
<br/>
interests you. It&#39;s all learning. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s so beautiful.<br/>
&quot;Subjects&quot; don&#39;t really exist outside of school anyway, but a full and <br/>
growing model of the universe, learned by connecting all possible interesting dots, <br/>
will eventually contain all that &quot;subject matter.&quot;  Painlessly.  Seamlessly.  <br/>
Naturally.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I had a wonderful Latin teacher, We called her &quot;Aunt Mardi&quot;---she was  <br/>
Robert&#39;s aunt. Robert and I were the only two in Latin IV & V. We  mostly read <br/>
Virgil&#39;s Aeneid. Well, we mostly got her off on some tangent!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
She stuttered horribly----but NOT when she recited poetry or read Latin.  <br/>
THEN her voice was glorious! But we would be translating some passage about  <br/>
Aeneas&#39; fleeing with his dad and son from Troy; Robert would ask about the REAL  <br/>
Troy, or building wooden horses, or the need to burn ancient cities.....and  <br/>
before you knew it, the hour was over! &lt;g&gt; She was BRILLIANT and knew  <br/>
everything about ancient Greece and Rome and loved to share it<br/>
 <br/>
So----two birds with one stone: No more translation PLUS we got to hear her  <br/>
talk about whatever...and the stuttering made her  story/explanation twice as <br/>
long! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Oh! And she wasn&#39;t stupid! She knew what we were doing! &lt;g&gt; But she  also was <br/>
so passionate about the Classics that she enjoyed talking about  them.<br/>
 <br/>
She also loved Kipling and Lewis Carroll and would recite from them,  leaving <br/>
us speechless!<br/>
 <br/>
I loved Aunt Mardi!<br/>

was really interested in anything they taught.  Most of them you <br/>
could just tell that they hated their job, that they were putting in <br/>
time until retirement.  I had one teacher that actually told us that <br/>
we would be utterly stupid to become a teacher.  In his opinion it <br/>
was the worst and most underpaid job in the world!  (He had been a <br/>
teacher for about 17 years by the time I had him)<br/>
What a sorry state the public school system was in and that was 14 <br/>
years ago that I graduated.  I can&#39;t even begin to imagine what it <br/>
is like today. :-(</div>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I only had a couple---REALLY---that were awful. Mrs Morrison in fifth and  <br/>
sixth grade English---she was just biding her time until retirement. Jimmy  <br/>
Gasque was my English teacher in 8th, 9th, & 10th; I leaned a lot from him  <br/>
because he was passionate about grammar and literature and writing---and  plus I was <br/>
naturally good at those things. But he ruled through fear:  &quot;Might is Right.&quot; <br/>
Looking back as an unschooling mom, I see that he is downright  dangerous! <br/>
And finally Billy Shand----a cruel, sadistic, mean son of a bitch who  hated and <br/>
belitted children. He turned me off history for twenty years! He&#39;s now  an <br/>
episcopal minister----so you episcopalians, BEWARE!<br/>
 <br/>
The rest of my teachers were exceptional. Incredibly inspiring.<br/>
 <br/>
And still, here I am unschoolng my kids! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had the same biology teacher in high school for three years.  It <br/>
was a small private school and there were only about 12 of us in the <br/>
class.  We were all pretty much on the same level.  I loved her <br/>
classes.  She inspired my passion for biology and science.  Since <br/>
all of us were at the same pace, we were able to go into things in <br/>
more detail and enjoy the &quot;subject&quot; more.  The last year we realized <br/>
we were &quot;ahead&quot; a year and she gave us the option of choosing what <br/>
we wanted to study for the last year.  We made up our own class!  <br/>
That was the last time I remember actually enjoying a class. Outside <br/>
of that class, school was monotonous. It was like a seperate world.</div>
