<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087013663">I don&#39;t welcome every new member because I think it gets old to read all the welcoming posts.  Your messages do not seem to be written in poor English, so please don&#39;t think of yourself as less worthy.  Even the occasional mistake is OK - we all have our times of messing up, or things we just can&#39;t get right (just like the kids do!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049505831">please don&#39;t ever let english not being your first language stop you from<br/>
expressing yourself. You have insights we may have never experienced. I know<br/>
how ovewhelming and scary it can be to try to communicate in a different<br/>
language. Welcome to our fellowship of unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063313101">Dear Noemi <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to read your opinions and ideas!!<br/>
Hopefully you have a slightly (at least) different<br/>
perspective on many of the subjects, ideas,<br/>
viewpoints, etc. that have and will come up.<br/>
<br/>
You are right about the silent welcomes.  500 or so<br/>
written ones would be a bit much!!<br/>
<br/>
There was a newsletter originating in Japan a while<br/>
back.  It probably is still in the archives...or, I<br/>
saved it if you would like for me to send it to you.<br/>
If you are interested?  Do you have contact with other<br/>
unschoolers or homeschoolers in the area where you<br/>
are?<br/>
<br/>

share info.<br/>
We had a pen pal/journal relationship with a group.<br/>
