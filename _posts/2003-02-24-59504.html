<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038339150">Hello, all you unschoolers...<br/>
I wanted to offer a response to several posts-here goes!<br/>
Thank you, Sandra, for reminding me to &quot;look into her eyes, and ask her what<br/>
she&#39;s not getting at home...&quot; (I think that&#39;s pretty close to how you said<br/>
it). Of course I had been doing that, but your suggestion reminded me to try<br/>
again, and we (13 yo dd and myself) sat at the table and made a list. That<br/>
seemed to help, because for the last weeks she&#39;s been happier and so am I.<br/>
I also wanted to comment on the post about late readers (sorry, I&#39;ve<br/>
forgotten who that was). The 13yo dd I mentioned above sounds alot like your<br/>
daughter-physical, creative and bright-and she didn&#39;t really read til she<br/>
was about 11. Yes, I&#39;m sure there was some damage to her self esteem, mostly<br/>
from other children. I remember one girl in particular saying to her &quot;you<br/>
can&#39;t be in my play, coz you have to read...&quot; :-(  She could read words, but<br/>
not chapter books then. Now at 13 she&#39;s a voracious reader! I never really<br/>
figured out a way to &quot;help&quot; her, I was reading when I started 1st<br/>
grade,(which did not go over well with the teacher-I spent most of my school<br/>
life getting in trouble for reading books I hid under my desk! and I&#39;d get<br/>
busted because I&#39;d forget and laugh out loud during history class, or<br/>
whatever boring subject it was.), so I figured she&#39;d read when she was<br/>
ready. I have heard that when children are tested, later, you cannot<br/>
differentiate the late from early readers.<br/>
&quot;cigarette smoking, sitting on their butts Texas moms...&quot;<br/>
I wish I had copied your exact quote, Sandra! it was brilliant, and I want<br/>
you to know that there&#39;s a Missouri version! I was raised, sort of, by one<br/>
of those. I say sort of, because my sister and brothers and I like to say<br/>
she didn&#39;t raise us, we just grew up. Okay, I&#39;ll go back to lurking now.<br/>
Thanks to all of you for everything you do...<br/>
Robyn<br/>

He doesn&#39;t care for the chaos already, and we&#39;re adding three rats to the<br/>

What is so great is that he does have his own area, separate from the rest<br/>

&lt;&lt; Our garage is full of neatly shelved boxes of mostly junk.  Dh and<br/>
I are both genetic pack rats.  He actually said we are saving the stuff in<br/>
the garage so that the kids can keep it in their garages when they grow up.<br/>
With a straight face. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This morning I made Kirby the offer to keep his pogs and old toys in my<br/>
&quot;paper room&quot; (where we are starting to move filing cabinets and old boxes of<br/>
stuff we just can&#39;t throw away).  With no hint of disapproval of his keeping<br/>
such things, Keith said &quot;I have some empty xerox boxes in the garage.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After weeks of asking Kirby to at least find all the clothes in his room,<br/>
and<br/>
of it getting to the point that we have to move piles of cards and such to<br/>
find a place to sit, and of Kirby being grumpy that things are lost or bent,<br/>
I finally asked a young grown female friend of his (from his anime club) who<br/>
hangs around with him at least once a week anyway, if she would please help<br/>
him clean his room.  She&#39;s agree, and after midterms they&#39;ll have a fun day<br/>
of &quot;OOOH!  You have one of these!  How COOL!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has Ninja Turtle stuff.  Lots of it.  Really good stuff.  I don&#39;t want<br/>
to ask him to get rid of that.    I just want him to be able to open his<br/>
closet door and use the clothes rack.  And to find various videos other<br/>
people have missed watching since Kirby took them to his room a year ago.<br/>

&gt; Did I mention the 3 moving boxes in the living room?  Jackie has been<br/>
making<br/>
&gt; things with boxes for a while and kept saying she needed a bigger box.  It<br/>
&gt; finally occurred to me to buy her one.  I took her to a moving place and<br/>
she<br/>
&gt; picked out a wardrobe box.  She was SO happy.  Well worth the $10.  She<br/>
told<br/>
&gt; me I was The Best Mom.<br/>
<br/>
Gee, I&#39;d like to get that kind of credit for coming up with boxes.  I do<br/>
that all the time.  I live in a military community.  Getting boxes involves<br/>
intercepting the new neighbors on the stairs, before they collapse and<br/>
recycle all their boxes!  Cheap fun.<br/>
<br/>
Right now my little Calvin-maniac is working on a transmorgifier.  He&#39;s<br/>
upset that it doesn&#39;t work like Calvin&#39;s yet.  I&#39;m doing my part to help<br/>
with it by buying more Calvin and Hobbs books.  Two today -- the one decent<br/>
English-language bookstore actually had some we didn&#39;t already own!  Hooray!<br/>

&lt;&lt;I do get so frustrated when we want to do something, but need to clear<br/>
away something else first and don&#39;t have anywhere to put the something else.<br/>
I&#39;ve been working on organizing our stuff, but I think I&#39;m doing a lousy job<br/>
because it&#39;s all still pretty disorganized.  I have given away so much stuff<br/>
in the last couple of years and the house is still overflowing.  I struggle<br/>
to find that balance between simplicity and frugal living.  One thing that<br/>
has helped me a little is to focus on MY stuff.  I have realized that it<br/>
isn&#39;t fair to tell them what to keep or give away.  Also, STUFF keeps<br/>
flowing into our house.  We simply do not have the space to continually<br/>
acquire stuff without also eliminating stuff.  Help!!  I do get grumpy when<br/>
every surface in the house is covered.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you want clutter away and stuff saved gone, you have to go through the<br/>
stuff regularly. That is of course unless you actually want to be a packrat.<br/>
My dad was, my husband is and so is Tara. Tara saves shirts she no longer<br/>
fits into just because Grandma or Aunt so and so gave it to her.<br/>
<br/>
Stuff is always going to be coming into the house. But some stuff, after<br/>
awhile, can go. Stuff like books and movies and games, well that stuff I<br/>
always keep because one never knows when someone won&#39;t find the urge to<br/>
watch or do or play. But other toys and clothes that aren&#39;t worn and things<br/>
old saved because they were just put away and forgotten about, I get rid of.<br/>
I go through clothes closets every 3 months and get rid of whatever doesn&#39;t<br/>
fit well or hasn&#39;t been worn since I went through it the last time. I have<br/>
the kids go through their stuff once a year in Oct. That&#39;s when our church<br/>
has their bazaar and takes donations of everything. It also gives the kids a<br/>
chance to sort through things and make room for Christmas! They like the<br/>
whole donation idea too. Sometimes things are put aside at other times and<br/>
if we have enough, we donate to other organizations also.<br/>
<br/>
I try to keep up on my husbands stuff too but only really have success with<br/>
is clothes. I must also say here that the kids stuff is always by their<br/>
choice. I never talk them into getting rid of anything. I wish I could talk<br/>
my husband into it though. He saves everything. I regularly go through his<br/>
stuff and just throw out receipts and wrappings from things he bought. I<br/>
think he could easily be one of those people you see on TV who can&#39;t get rid<br/>
of anything. (only half kidding here!) The only boxes of anything in this<br/>
house not used is my husbands. It&#39;s the only way I can deal with his stuff.<br/>
Put in it a box and maybe in 2 years he&#39;ll go through it. No boxes of<br/>
anything else not being played with or used for decorations at one time or<br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
My stuff is a bare minimum. Only what I use and a few keepsakes. I do have<br/>
one small stuff of baby things from when all the kids were little.<br/>

&gt; My kids have a whole cupboard in the playroom of stuff like<br/>
&gt; that. All kinds<br/>
&gt; of paints, glitter, glues, felt, ribbon, yard, different<br/>
&gt; kinds of scissors,<br/>
&gt; stencils, eyes, pom poms, pipe cleaners, beads, etc. We<br/>
&gt; always have tons of<br/>
&gt; paper here too along with all kinds of crayons and markers.<br/>
&gt; My kids very<br/>
&gt; rarely get into that stuff. I keep thinking maybe it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; because of me not<br/>
&gt; being craft minded.<br/>
<br/>
Oh my goodness! This is good to hear. When I worry about unschooling I have<br/>
no fears<br/>
about math or the such, but I do feel as if I am depriving them in the arts<br/>
and crafts<br/>
department LOL! We have tons of supplies as well, but my kids don&#39;t do much<br/>
with them<br/>
either. My oldest hates to draw (he wants his pictures to look right and<br/>
they never<br/>
(in his eyes) do). If I come up with a project, they enjoy it, but they<br/>
rarely just<br/>
pick up craft supplies and create. My youngest seems a little better at this<br/>
though. I<br/>
remember reading on unschooling.com about the tons of things that someone&#39;s<br/>
kids<br/>
did with a box of popsicle sticks and realizing that we had a box that has<br/>
been sitting<br/>
there untouched for months...<br/>
<br/>
I have found that both boys like rubber stamping (my main hobby) and I guess<br/>
that I need<br/>
to pull out my inks and stamps again to get the juices flowing!<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Cleaning isn&#39;t like that for me. I guess maybe I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; like that all my<br/>
&gt;  life. It&#39;s easy for me to do. I enjoy doing it and it&#39;s also<br/>
&gt; important for<br/>
&gt;  me. To be neat and clean. To have a place for everything. So<br/>
&gt; THAT&#39;S part of<br/>
&gt;  who I am. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do think that there is a genetic component to this...my dh is just<br/>
naturally a<br/>
neat person as is one of my best friends. And I see this in my boys...my 6<br/>
yo is<br/>
not really into cleaning and helps out sometimes (if there is a good reason<br/>
like<br/>
needing room to play a game). Kyle (my 3 yo) on the other hand LOVES to help<br/>
me<br/>
clean. And I mean he really actually helps...he helps me unload the entire<br/>
car<br/>
when we food shop, he loves to dust, he loves to help me make the bed and<br/>
the other day when we were folding clothes he wanted to learn how to fold<br/>
shirts.<br/>
It just cracks me up and is so cute. I have told dh that I have decided that<br/>
Kyle<br/>
and he should have full responsibility for keeping the house clean since it<br/>
is<br/>
in their genes...that Jason and I should be exempt since it just isn&#39;t in<br/>
our nature.<br/>
:o)<br/>

Hey if you are making an east coast tour, be sure to stop by Virgina!<br/>

&gt;&gt;I took her to a moving place and she picked out a wardrobe box.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When the kids were younger, I once made them a castle out of 2 wardrobe<br/>
boxes plus 2 smaller ones. The wardrobes were the tall turrets on either<br/>
end. The other boxes were flattened out and attached in between to be the<br/>
body of the castle. We even had windows, secret passages and a working<br/>
drawbridge.<br/>
<br/>
It was very cool. My kids still love boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Oh my goodness! This is good to hear. When I worry about unschooling I<br/>
have no fears about math or the such, but I do feel as if I am depriving<br/>
them in the arts and crafts department LOL! We have tons of supplies as<br/>
well, but my kids don&#39;t do much with them<br/>
either&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay Stephanie E, we can be artsy misfits together!!!! When you mentioned<br/>
the rubber stamping, I remembered we also have a ton of those in that same<br/>
cabinet too. That lasted when we first got them but they&#39;ve been in there so<br/>
long, I had forgotten about them. But that&#39;s one of the things I would never<br/>
get rid of. Who knows when someone&#39;s creative juices may get flowing in<br/>
another direction.<br/>

east coast clean up tour. Unfortunately when I get back home, my house will<br/>
definitely look like I&#39;ve been gone. And of course I could never leave my<br/>

You know, I&#39;ve been putting a lot of these ideas into practice, and I have<br/>
to admit,<br/>
<br/>
I LIKE cleaning up.  I LIKE giving my kids the opportunity to be messy and<br/>
not be obligated all the time to &quot;clean it up&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
There are definitely times that it really works on my nerves, but much less<br/>
than before.<br/>
<br/>
now if I could only convince my husband LOL.  I think he thinks I&#39;m being<br/>
too &quot;permissive&quot;.<br/>

  NO KIDDING!! My poor dh is doomed to feeling slightly edgy around us all<br/>
the<br/>
  time.<br/>
  He eyes the project that is starting up, asks if I know what&#39;s going on, I<br/>
  wave a nonchalant hand and tell him that yes, I do know and don&#39;t worry<br/>
about<br/>
  it and he just slinks off to his hideout.<br/>
  Later, when things are disastrous, he gives me this &quot;I told you this would<br/>
  happen&quot; kind of look....but bites his tongue.<br/>
  Yesterday, it was bingo markers, stamped so hard on the paper that they<br/>
  splattered the floor and table with ink. He looked positively ill.<br/>
  I just don&#39;t have much sympathy for him anymore, as sad as that may be.<br/>
  I think he should have a clue how I operate by now, if not, oh well....:)<br/>
The<br/>
  kids sanity is more important to me than his. I only say that because he<br/>
has<br/>
  his own area of the house to go to....and I refuse to make myself insane<br/>
  trying to keep it to his standard.<br/>
  I try to get things straightened to help him feel calm, but with four<br/>
  creative kids, there is no way it&#39;ll look like his perfect corner of the<br/>
  house!!!<br/>
  I wish I knew how to help him feel calm amidst chaos...it&#39;s a learned art<br/>

  think.<br/>

Subject: Parent-Child conflicts<br/>
<br/>
I just had a thought the other day.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how much of the conflict between parents and children really has to<br/>
do with how a child&#39;s behavior is assumed to be a reflection on his/her<br/>
parents and their parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I am guessing 90% of the &quot;rules&quot; that abound in most homes comes directly<br/>
from parents worrying about their own image.<br/>

<br/>
  Oh and forts!! My house always gets overrun by forts made wherever out of<br/>
  whatever. :o)<br/>
<br/>
  Oh my gosh!!!<br/>
  Ours too.  In fact, the latest is that the girls took the mattresses off<br/>
their bunk beds and are sleeping on the floor while they converted the top<br/>
bunk into a fort with lacy curtains hanging along the sides from the<br/>
ceiling.  Its actually pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
  2 weeks ago, the forts were in the living room and before that they were<br/>
behind the spiral staircase in the basement LOL.<br/>
<br/>
  Forts are a favorite around here.  My son just built a snow fort outside<br/>
in all this great snow we got last weekend.  I did warn him about the<br/>
possibility of collapse.  He used walls and a plywood ceiling that he then<br/>
covered with snow.<br/>
<br/>
  Smart kid :o).<br/>

I&#39;m finding that when I sit down and just start to do crafty stuff, the kids<br/>
will stumble upon me and join in.<br/>
<br/>
I am NOT crafty by any means.  I can&#39;t even wrap a gift right.  But the<br/>
other day i was drawing fractal images (Idea from I hate Mathematics or Math<br/>
Wizardry, I forget which).  I was making tree like fractals with all<br/>
different colors.  The girls were really into it and made some of their own.<br/>
<br/>
THEN we got on the computer and found some REALLY COOL computer generated<br/>
fractals.  You should see them.  We are using them for our desktops.<br/>

  &gt; My kids have a whole cupboard in the playroom of stuff like<br/>
  &gt; that. All kinds<br/>
  &gt; of paints, glitter, glues, felt, ribbon, yard, different<br/>
  &gt; kinds of scissors,<br/>
  &gt; stencils, eyes, pom poms, pipe cleaners, beads, etc. We<br/>
  &gt; always have tons of<br/>
  &gt; paper here too along with all kinds of crayons and markers.<br/>
  &gt; My kids very<br/>
  &gt; rarely get into that stuff. I keep thinking maybe it&#39;s<br/>
  &gt; because of me not<br/>
  &gt; being craft minded.<br/>
<br/>
  Oh my goodness! This is good to hear. When I worry about unschooling I<br/>

much with them<br/>
  either. My oldest hates to draw (he wants his pictures to look right and<br/>
they never<br/>
  (in his eyes) do). If I come up with a project, they enjoy it, but they<br/>
rarely just<br/>
  pick up craft supplies and create. My youngest seems a little better at<br/>
this though. I<br/>
  remember reading on unschooling.com about the tons of things that<br/>
someone&#39;s kids<br/>
  did with a box of popsicle sticks and realizing that we had a box that has<br/>
been sitting<br/>
  there untouched for months...<br/>
<br/>
  I have found that both boys like rubber stamping (my main hobby) and I<br/>
guess that I need<br/>
  to pull out my inks and stamps again to get the juices flowing!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I see no reason for censorship which I see as<br/>
<br/>
diametrically opposed to unschooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t censorship.  It was a request for courtesy, which isn&#39;t opposed to<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It was a request for staying on topic, which is fine.  It&#39;s a big damned<br/>
internet, and you can read all the war humor and commentary and cartoons and<br/>
rude animations and play-by-play commentary anyone could ever want on the<br/>
internet.<br/>
<br/>
Censorship would be someone keeping this list from existing.<br/>
You can start your own list and discuss ANYTHING without being censored, but<br/>
on someone else&#39;s list you&#39;re limited to what they want to allow.<br/>

Subject: Intro and advice request<br/>
<br/>
Hi all,<br/>
My name is Heidi and I am the unschooling mom of three, ages 10, 8 and<br/>
1.  I jsut joined and I know I&#39;m supposed to lurk for a while and see if<br/>
this is where I belong but I&#39;m already sure that it is.<br/>
<br/>
My immediate concern is the fact that I have a 10 year old who is still<br/>
not reading.  I am hanging on by my fingernails waiting for the<br/>
lightning bolt of compregension to hit her.  She knows &quot;how&quot; to read (ie<br/>
she can sound out words and recognize a few on their own) but she<br/>
steadfastly refuses to spend any time really getting comfortable with<br/>
it.  She LOVES to be read to.  She is outrageously creative<br/>
artistically.  She enjoys physical persuits (karate, fencing, biking<br/>
swimming...).  I know this kids wants to read btu she wants the magic<br/>
wand method of learning and I can&#39;t find it.  My concern is that her<br/>
self esteem is now getting involved.  Other people assume that she can<br/>
read and it is going to get increasingly difficult to cover the fact<br/>
that she can&#39;t (or more accurately, won&#39;t).  Of course this pushes all<br/>
my buttons because one of my issues on the self-improvement front is to<br/>
let go of others&#39; expectations.  AARGH&gt;  This is such a tough place to<br/>
be in.  I want her to maintain all her self confidence but I don&#39;t want<br/>
to teach her to cave to the expectations of others.<br/>
<br/>
You are all saved from further rambling by a crying baby.<br/>
<br/>
TIA for any advice!<br/>
<br/>
Heidi<br/>

Holly turned 11 in November.   It was only around then that she said when<br/>
she<br/>
walks into a room she sees words and reads them the second she sees them.<br/>
Like the names of books or the month on the calendar, or the labels on<br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s still not reading &quot;chapter books&quot; with enough speed to make her happy.<br/>
She&#39;s working on The Boxcar Children, but slowly.  She&#39;s reading Harry<br/>
Potter<br/>
cards, though, and pretty fluently.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This is such a tough place to<br/>
be in.  I want her to maintain all her self confidence but I don&#39;t want<br/>
to teach her to cave to the expectations of others.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you want, I&#39;ll send you our copy of &quot;Teach your Child to Read in 100 Easy<br/>
Lessons&quot; (or whatever it is) which helped Holly in some magical way.  We did<br/>
t<br/>
hree or four lessons (Well no, we read through three or four word lists,<br/>
without doing their totally weird lessons, and we started around #18 I<br/>
think.<br/>
  If that would make your daughter feel better, I&#39;ll send it for the<br/>
shipping.  I paid half price for it used.<br/>
<br/>
And this might make you the mom feel better:<br/>

One of Carol Rice&#39;s kids is upstairs right now, 18, can read anything in the<br/>
world, but couldn&#39;t until &quot;late.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Forts are a favorite around here<br/>
<br/>
My boys love forts as well but even better are the spider webs.  A skein of<br/>
yarn and they turn the house into a giant spider web with them being the<br/>
spiders of course.  They love to catch the dogs.  LOL<br/>

Subject: Re: this list has forced me again--fractals<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I am NOT crafty by any means.  I can&#39;t even wrap a gift right.  But<br/>
the other day i was drawing fractal images (Idea from I hate<br/>
Mathematics or Math Wizardry, I forget which).  I was making tree<br/>
like fractals with all different colors.  The girls were really into<br/>
it and made some of their own.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; THEN we got on the computer and found some REALLY COOL computer<br/>
generated fractals.  You should see them.  We are using them for our<br/>
desktops.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been to some cool fractal websites too.  They were really<br/>
pretty, but I still don&#39;t comprehend what a fractal is.  Does anyone<br/>
have a clear definition?<br/>
