<div id="ygrps-yiv-233520296">I mentioned before that we named ourselves The Serendipity Academy when we filed to bring Sarah home from school. Well, tonight we saw some Serendipity in action. <br/>
   <br/>
  I tried to go to the library earlier today with all of the kids, plus Sarah&#39;s friend D. It was a disaster. I went at a less than ideal time (too close to dinner time) and both Gracie and Megan flipped out. Neither wanted to be there, and neither wanted to be in a stroller. I needed to pay fines on overdue materials and couldn&#39;t hold either one of them, so both were in strollers. <br/>
   <br/>
  So as soon as I finished paying for the fines, I checked out the two books Logan had picked and two DVDs Sarah had managed to get Gracie quiet with, and we left for home. Got dinner on the way home, and I asked Paul if he&#39;d mind if I went back up to the library so I could find some books for myself. <br/>
   <br/>
  Sarah went with me. When we got there, she noticed something was going on in the meeting room. It turned out to be a poetry reading by Poetry Alive. ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.poetryalive.com">http://www.poetryalive.com</a> ) So we sat to watch, and ended up both being picked to participate in Casey At The Bat (I was Casey, and Sarah was the umpire). We both had a blast, and I think it sparked an interest in Sarah in poetry :-) We also met another homeschooling family there. <br/>
   <br/>
  I was focused on getting into the library itself and looking for books, and I&#39;d have totally missed a wonderful hour of fun, of connecting with Sarah, and myself (I love to act/read aloud). I&#39;m still beaming from it, and Sarah and I made a connection tonight that I want to hold onto. We are going to see if any of the homeschoolers we know around here might be interested in starting a group to do readings together like that. <br/>

<br/>
Whether or not you get a group going, check this out:  &quot;Joyful Noise:  Poems<br/>
for Two Voices&quot;  by Paul Fleischman.  I picked it up at an IRL bookstore,<br/>
but I&#39;ll bet Amazon has it.<br/>

used it for talent shows.<br/>
<br/>
ALSO - &quot;Math Talk: Mathematical Ideas in Poems for Two Voices&quot; is  <br/>
pretty good. It is by Theoni Pappas (who also wrote &quot;The Joy of  <br/>
Mathematics&quot; and &quot;Math Scandals&quot; and many other great math books and  <br/>
creates the &quot;Math Calendar&quot; every year).<br/>

  You could also check out READER&#39;S THEATRE, which is basically groups of people reading plays, but not acting them out--like a radio broadcast. Mychildren were involved in it when they were younger with a library group.  You can find many books at the libary with Reader&#39;s Theeatre plays in them.   Usually, when performed, the readers will all be dressed in black, sitting on stools, in from of the audience, with few or no props.  We enjoyed it a lot!<br/>

The first link worked in the original e-mail from which I quoted.  To  <br/>
use it from mine, you would need to add the part that the wraparound  <br/>
cut off.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My shorter link should&#39;ve worked, and has a link to that first piece.<br/>
