<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033201350">Hi Bronwen - we use Powerglide also. Have not tried the Learnables, but did<br/>
look at Muzzy and the kids, besides thinking it was funny, didn&#39;t really<br/>
like it for learning. My son started with the Spanish Powerglide at 7 and<br/>
really likes it. <br/>

&gt; Subject: foreign language<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone used &quot;the Learnables&quot; for foreign language?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What about &quot;Power Glide&quot;? , &quot;Muzzy&quot;?  --do you actually kinda know it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; has anyone ever taught themselves a language?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What language should we pick?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are thinking about doing it as a family- maybe Italian (cause my husband&#39;s<br/>
&gt; family is Italian origin-but they dont speak it) or maybe French cause my<br/>
&gt; daughter takes tons of ballet, or maybe Spanish cause there are alot of<br/>
&gt; Spanish speakers around where we live....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for your ideas,<br/>
&gt; Bronwen </span></blockquote></div>

&lt;&lt; I hope you can find some relief.  Maybe you would consider a visit to a<br/>
 naturopath?  There may also be acupuncture or acupressure treatments that<br/>
 can help.  <br/>
 Hang in there.<br/>

worked wonders on me but she is really expensive. I also see an acupuncturist <br/>
and am considering an appt. soon for allergies and my overall well-being.<br/>

   I am very sensitive so earplugs drive me bananas.:o)  I will up my water <br/>
again I promise. I also keep forgetting to take my liquid Calcium before bed. <br/>
I heard this really calms some people. Next shopping trip I&#39;ll buy Kava Kava. <br/>

come to our yard for the grape vines I have planted<br/>
over a pool fence.  One day (actually a few summers<br/>
ago now) I didn&#39;t have my glasses or contacts in yet<br/>
and thought someone&#39;s huge black dog was in our<br/>
garbage (around day break) I walked up to it using my<br/>
big mouth for all it was worth to chase it out of the<br/>
garbage and was within about 3 feet of it before it<br/>
turned around and I was close enough to see it was a<br/>
bear (yes, I&#39;m really that nearsighted.) When I<br/>
realized it meant no harm I went in the house, woke<br/>
the kids and brought them out (with hindsight-not<br/>
smart I know.) But this year it seems they&#39;re in the<br/>
yard an awful lot! (I don&#39;t know between the bears and<br/>
the sharks - think we&#39;ve taken over too much of their<br/>
territory?  At least so far the *bears* have been very<br/>
tolerant of us!!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-77659934">O.K., folks hide all those peanut butter and jelly sandwiches &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When we use to go camping in Yosemite you could tell which families had<br/>
things like peanut butter with them.  The bears would zero in on those<br/>
campers.<br/>

<br/>
One night my DH and I were awakened by a noise on our outside deck.  <br/>
Not being able to see very well without my glasses I thought I was <br/>
seeing a cat out there.  DH (the original &#39;city person&#39;) said &quot;Isn&#39;t <br/>
that kind of a funny looking cat?&quot;  Well, I put on the glasses and <br/>
discovered it was not one but TWO raccoons :o)<br/>
<br/>
Now, those of you who are saying &quot;so what?&quot; <br/>
    --- We lived on the third floor in downtown San Francisco !!<br/>
<br/>
The local animal control told me there were several pair of raccoons <br/>
that live in the city and climb up to balconies looking for trash.<br/>
 <br/>
BTW,  DH used this event as his excuse not to go camping -- he said <br/>
he could see all the &#39;nature&#39; right outside his own window in the <br/>
city :)<br/>
