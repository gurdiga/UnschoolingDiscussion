<div id="ygrps-yiv-74517171">Hi everyone,<br/>
I&#39;m so glad things have slowed down a bit.  I was struggling to keep up,<br/>
and wasn&#39;t able to read everything.<br/>
Was thinking yesterday, and had a sudden realization.<br/>
I was thinking about my doubts about unschooling.  I am the only one in<br/>
our very eclectic group of homeschoolers that is a complete &quot;do nothing&quot;<br/>
( mean curriculum, workbooks ect...)  unschooler.  Very often this<br/>
causes me to have doubts about what I am doing.  I find that I start<br/>
comparing my children and my style to others...not a good thing  :).....<br/>
<br/>
Well, I started thinking about why I unschool.  My reasons I realized<br/>
have nothing to do with academics.  What are my goals?<br/>
It is not to have super academic children.  I don&#39;t care where they are<br/>
according to the public school system ect...  I&#39;m not trying to<br/>
academically surpass their public counterparts.<br/>
I guess my primary goals would be to have well rounded, content<br/>
individuals.  I want them to be content with who they are as people.  I<br/>
want them to love life and all that that entails.  I want them to have<br/>
fun and be happy.<br/>
This has helped me so much to realize that unschooling my way fits those<br/>
goals perfectly.  Now when I have doubts ect...  I will try to think of<br/>
this.<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d share.<br/>
I&#39;d like to hear what others goals are.<br/>

Hello Ann,<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of my goals of unschooling my children and myself.<br/>
<br/>
1.  For my children to have a love of learning which lasts a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
2.  The freedom to choose which activities that want to do.<br/>
<br/>
3.  That it is perfectly o.k. to be different from the norm.<br/>
<br/>
4.  That it is o.k. not the know the answer.  But to know how to find  <br/>
      answer.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few of our goals for our children.  As the years pass we update <br/>
and modifying them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Having two late readers brought me to that conclusion. My 12 yo has only<br/>
this year learned to read, in spite of wanting to, and trying really<br/>
hard. It has been hard enough on him, let alone if we had had a program<br/>
that he was failing at. Because we don&#39;t use a curriculum he has<br/>
continued to explore his world and knows that he is a scientist and a<br/>
musician and a mathematician ...... and is confident in his very real<br/>
abilities. But if his science etc. was curriculum / textbook / workbook<br/>
based....? His &#39;failure&#39; to read, would have extended to all the other<br/>
areas of learning.<br/>
<br/>
We only have to look out at the world to find very successful people who<br/>
&#39;failed&#39; to pass the &#39;necessary&#39; requirements for their careers when at<br/>
school, but went on to surpass their peers. There are a lot more who<br/>
don&#39;t - I believe the difference is in self-esteem - the ones who<br/>
succeed somehow managed to stay &#39;well-rounded, content individuals&#39;. As<br/>
unschoolers, we have a much better chance of producing such people.<br/>
<br/>
I was talking to one of our &#39;Education Review Officers&#39; (the people who<br/>
visit us about every 2-3 years here in New Zealand to check on our<br/>
homeschooling) and told him I would prefer that my homeschooling<br/>
produced a happy, psychologically healthy illiterate, than a neurotic<br/>
PhD. He was somewhat taken aback &lt;vbg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029296694">I would only add that I want to see my children be happy now and as adults.<br/>
If they are happy with their lives then they will have more than most ever<br/>
could dream.<br/>

I totally agree! I couldn&#39;t have said it better. It&#39;s not the academics that <br/>
are important to me, but joy. I want my children to be happy to be alive. I <br/>
also want my children to be kind and helpful to others. And not afraid to ask <br/>
questions. And I also want them to think that learning new things is FUN. <br/>
Gosh, I could go on and on and on....<br/>

Ann,<br/>
    My goals are very similar.  I would like my kids to be able to know how <br/>
to learn, so that anytime in their life, if a desire to learn something comes <br/>
up, they will know how to pursue it.  I also would like them to find their <br/>
&quot;nic&quot; in life.  I want them to find jobs or careers that fit who they are as <br/>
people, so that they enjoy and love what they do.  I also want them to love <br/>
God and others, and to be able to made their own decisions in life, instead <br/>
of having other people tell them what to do.  I want them to be able to stop, <br/>
think, ponder, weigh all options and opinions, and then make their own <br/>
decision (instead of being led by the nose, like so many other poeple <br/>
are-----including myself, at times).  Wellrounded, loving, intelligent adults <br/>
that are wonderful spouses and parents---that is my dream for my children.<br/>
