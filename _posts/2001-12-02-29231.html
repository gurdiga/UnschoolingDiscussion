<div id="ygrps-yiv-822074253">Hi to everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I just had a thought about the person who mentioned that they pay by <br/>
the email. Maybe you&#39;ve thought of this already, but maybe you could <br/>
switch to &quot;no mail&quot; in your group preference, and then just come to the <br/>
group&#39;s messages page to read all the new messages for free whenever <br/>
you want. That&#39;s how I do it because it&#39;s so much faster to scan the <br/>
topic lines, or read every message if you have the time. You don&#39;t have <br/>
to wait for digests, and you can see the threads more clearly also.<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea. Back to enjoying the exchange of so many ideas from lurk <br/>
for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
peace be with you<br/>
Makana</div>
