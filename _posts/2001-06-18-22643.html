<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772161674">There is a Liberty State Science museum in the same general vicinity (sp) of <br/>
the Statue of Liberty.  If you want to go south, there is the Philadelphia <br/>
Zoo and the Camden Aquarium, not to mention the Franklin Institute and <br/>
Natural History Museum.  There is also a fairly impressive art museum in <br/>
Philadelphia.  If you have any extra time, we&#39;d love to meet with you.  My <br/>
kids are 6 and 4 as well.  Let me know if that is a possibility.  We have <br/>
memberships to the zoo, the aquarium and the Franklin Institute.<br/>
<br/>
Have a good time and let me know if you need any more info,<br/>
<br/>

My sister is getting married in New Brunswick, NJ in Aug and we<br/>
are planning on attending.  One of my brothers lives in Montclair<br/>
so we will be in that area too. What are good activities for a 4<br/>
year old and a 6 year old?  We are willing to drive and are planning<br/>
a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Natural History<br/>
Museum one day.  I figure the Ellis Island/Statue of Liberty visits<br/>
are better done when they are older and have learned more about US<br/>
history.  Any suggestions of good things to do would be appreciated.<br/>
We would like day trip suggestions since we want to stay in one area<br/>
for our entire visit.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
