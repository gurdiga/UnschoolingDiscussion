<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771585423">Hello all,<br/>
My name is Madeline. I&#39;ve been lurking for a couple of weeks and i&#39;ve learned a lot.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s my two cents:<br/>
<br/>
As far as a love of reading, my father loved to read and so do i. He said that i just taught myself when i was 4 yo. Years of schooling did not destroy my love. In fact, long before i even heard of unschooling, i was aware that learning to read before i went to school taught me that i did not *need* school to learn things.<br/>
<br/>
My brother, who grew up in the same environment, however, does not really care about books.<br/>
<br/>
Also, even though my father spoke grammatically, he did not obsess about grammar or go around proofreading signs and such. My stepmother, who worked as a writer, *did* do this, and so do i,<br/>
<br/>
As far as math goes, there are three kinds of people: those who can count and those who can&#39;t!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, i&#39;m sending this from my cell phone!  <br/>
 Blessings,<br/>
Madeline<br/>

Not too bad, except for the apostophes coming out as five-character  <br/>
code.<br/>

A tweak to your thinking will give you a giant  step toward  <br/>
unschooling:  If you rephrase in your head that you learned to read  <br/>
when you were four (rather than you &quot;taught yourself&quot;) then it will  <br/>
be easier to see that you learned that you didn&#39;t need school, rather  <br/>
than thinking that learning to read &quot;taught you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It will really make a difference.<br/>

that &quot;Children will learn....&quot; and that never sat right with me.  I <br/>
would like it to say, &quot;Children will have the opportunity to <br/>
learn...&quot;  I will have to correct that!  Laurie</div>
