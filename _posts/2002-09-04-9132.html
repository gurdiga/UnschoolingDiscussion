<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489682199">Dylan and I have been going out in the early morning hours to the river<br/>
to watch the beavers.  There&#39;s also a family of muskrats and a mink and<br/>
one river otter that we know of.   Sometimes the Osprey come to hunt and<br/>
there&#39;s always at least one Heron.  Dylan says Herons were the<br/>
inspiration for Zen, so much stillness...  We watch the Sandpipers and<br/>
the Killdeer.  Dylan saw, for the first time in his life, Mergansers<br/>
torpedoing after fish.  He&#39;s getting really good at identifying ducks,<br/>
something I struggle with. <br/>
<br/>
We just sit there on the bank with our coffee and hot chocolate and watch<br/>
all the life of the river.  We watch the fish jump,  we watch the<br/>
dragonflies.  Dylan wears his big binoculars round his neck in case<br/>
something up or down the river catches his eye.<br/>
He just looks so small and sweet sitting there.  I hope this is the thing<br/>
I&#39;m left thinking of when I&#39;m old and goofy.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted me to wake him up early today so we could go.  He also wants to<br/>
look over the proposal by the EPA for cleanup along the river, he&#39;s<br/>
worried what they do will bother the beavers who are working so hard to<br/>
build there along the east bank.  He&#39;s asked me to take him to see the<br/>
Fish and Wildlife biologist so he can ask questions.   He wants to go to<br/>
the public meeting here about the proposal.  Sometimes I worry that he<br/>
cares so much, but I guess I&#39;d wonder too, if he didn&#39;t care at all.  <br/>
Ten just seems young sometimes for such big concerns. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also his dads birthday today and he wants to make a cake.  When his<br/>
dad leaves for work, if Dylan&#39;s up he always says &quot;Now I don&#39;t want to<br/>
find out you&#39;ve been hot rodding around in my truck&quot;.  It&#39;s funny because<br/>
it&#39;s just an old beater truck and couldn&#39;t hot rod for anything.  So last<br/>
week we took a picture of Dylan in the truck and had it enlarged and<br/>
framed and he&#39;s going to give it to his dad when he comes home today.  He<br/>
thinks he&#39;s so funny.  <br/>
<br/>
We have a pigeon who&#39;s wing was broken and her bandage comes off today. <br/>
We&#39;ll let her flap her wings a few day&#39;s and see if she can fly and then<br/>
we&#39;ll let her go on Saturday.  She&#39;s been a very sweet bird and Dylan<br/>
holds her and is amazed at how light she feels, and how alive.   He<br/>
wondered if we could help with bird banding here somewhere but when I<br/>
told him volunteers don&#39;t get to hold the birds he was disappointed.   He<br/>
held a baby bird this spring who&#39;d fallen from the bird house, little<br/>
House Sparrow.  She fell out twice when she was trying to fly and we&#39;d<br/>
have to get the ladder and climb up there and poke her back in.  We got<br/>
to see her early successful attempts at flight into the lilac bush and we<br/>
watched her come and go from the feeders.  If she&#39;s still around we can&#39;t<br/>
tell her now from the others, but we wonder when we see a House Sparrow<br/>
if it could be that one.<br/>
<br/>
Time to wake a sleepy kid, maybe.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117029499">Dear Deb:  I imagine you are at the river while I am at the computer.<br/>
Tell Dylan that what he does is beautiful.  That one day we will meet<br/>
both of you.  Peace for the day.  Lisa<br/>
