<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311296302">Anytime we go to the bookstore, or library or any other store, my 9 <br/>
year old always finds tons of cool stuff to check out or wants to buy <br/>
some cool game or video or project. He will get so excited about <br/>
whatever new thing he&#39;s found. But as soon as we get it home, it&#39;s <br/>
dropped and ignored. It will end up getting shelved or it is due back <br/>
at the library before he looks at it again. This happens about 90% of <br/>
the time. <br/>

Is this a common thing? An age or stage thing? How can I handle it when <br/>

When he chooses a book to bring home, YOU read it.  Maybe to him, but  <br/>
at least yourself, if it&#39;s fairly short.  Then you can talk about it  <br/>
with him when or if he reads it.<br/>
<br/>
If he wants a toy or some exciting new thing, put it out on the table  <br/>
and you and others can play with it with him.<br/>

If it&#39;s a movie, watch it with him.<br/>

If it&#39;s a game, set him up a good place and time to play it.  Bring  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids at home are 21 and 17, I still sort of keep an eye on things  <br/>
they buy and if something seems to be getting buried or lost in the  <br/>
shuffle of our lives, I&#39;m the one who will pull it out. If it is a  <br/>
book, I might either read a bit myself and then mention it or if it is  <br/>
a game or puzzle I&#39;ll put it out on the coffee table in the living  <br/>
room where someone will see it and very likely start playing with it.  <br/>
I JUST did this on Friday. My husband and I went out of town overnight  <br/>
- before we left I was rummaging in a closet looking for something and  <br/>
found a game we&#39;d bought and never (or maybe just barely) played. I  <br/>
set it out on the coffee table. When we came home the next night it  <br/>
was scattered over the coffee table and had obviously been played by  <br/>
the girls and a couple of friends who were here. For us, it often  <br/>
happens with DVD&#39;s - one of us will buy a DVD that is on sale  <br/>
somewhere (often those bins at drug stores, for example) and then  <br/>
it&#39;ll sit and nobody will watch it. I&#39;m the one who knows that it is  <br/>
sitting there - invisible to everyone else &lt;G&gt;. So - if the time seems  <br/>
right, I will suggest we put it on and my kids will say, &quot;OH, I forgot  <br/>
all about that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This should probably go on the job description for unschooling  <br/>
parents. Not sure exactly how to put it - but it is definitely an  <br/>
important skill for an unschooling parent to have.<br/>
<br/>
However, this afternoon I bought a new game (Bananagrams) and asked  <br/>
the girls if they wanted to play it with me tonight. But, then we got  <br/>
home and cooked dinner and watched a DVD (&quot;The Importance of Being  <br/>
Earnest&quot; with Colin Firth and Rupert Everett) and totally forgot about  <br/>
it. Just as she was going off to bed, Roxana said, &quot;Sorry we didn&#39;t  <br/>
play your game, Mom.&quot; &quot;I&quot; had forgotten, but she remembered. It&#39;ll  <br/>
probably have to wait until next weekend - but I&#39;ll keep it out on the  <br/>
coffee table until then.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would say, go to the library more and the store less.  When we go to<br/>
the book store, we spend a lot of time reading books there, and<br/>
generally buy something that I know without a doubt we will use a lot. <br/>
The last time we went to a bookstore we bought one of those skeletons<br/>
that you put in water and it grows.  The time before that we bought a<br/>
Calvin and Hobbes book, that I knew Margaux would use for a long time,<br/>
for reading and for coloring in.<br/>
<br/>
Many times, once we get library books home, Margaux doesn&#39;t touch them<br/>
at all.  I offer to read them, but she usually would rather do other<br/>
things, so we do.  The exception is reading Calvin and Hobbes, Little<br/>
Bear, Angelina Ballerina, Frog and Toad, or any puzzler look and find<br/>
type books.  Occasionally something strikes her fancy, but those are the<br/>
mainstays.<br/>
<br/>
Our money is better spent on toys or thrift store items, if we want<br/>
stuff to be used ALL the time.</div>

forgetting about, as opposed to strewing things the parents think  <br/>
might be cool.<br/>
<br/>
It is the parental ability to keep track of stuff that I&#39;m talking  <br/>
about, though. Say Rosie buys a book and it gets put on the bookshelf  <br/>
and forgotten (by her). I could be irritated that she bought a book  <br/>
that she never even bothered to read, or I could remember that book is  <br/>
there and pull it out for her when the time seems right (not when  <br/>
she&#39;s already involved in watching tv or playing a game, but when I  <br/>
sense that she&#39;d appreciate a good book. Or I might &#39;strew&#39; it in the  <br/>
&quot;leave it around&quot; sense.<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to add that it could be the act of buying stuff that is  <br/>
interesting, not the stuff itself. In that case, sometimes spending  <br/>
more time at 99 cent stores and thrift stores and garage sales is  <br/>
worthwhile, but also it might be fun for the child to be on the  <br/>
selling side - HAVE a garage sale yourselves (or a lemonade stand or  <br/>
bake sale or ???).<br/>
<br/>
And to see the bigger principle in this situation - I&#39;ve noticed that  <br/>
whenever my kids are doing something that is irritating or concerning  <br/>
me, it is very very often that I&#39;m not picking up signals about their  <br/>
interests. Usually it is because their behavior hooked into something  <br/>
that I don&#39;t like about myself or about someone in my past, so I  <br/>
stopped paying attention to what the behavior really means in my own  <br/>
child. Perfect example would be a kid who always wants to buy lots of  <br/>
stuff in stores. What does that mean? What need does the child really  <br/>
have? How can we pursue this interest? If I&#39;m not asking myself those  <br/>
questions, but, instead, I&#39;m worrying that my child is turning out to  <br/>
be careless with money, materialistic, wasteful, selfish, etc., then  <br/>
THAT shows that I, myself, have issues that are being poked and  <br/>
disturbed by my child&#39;s behavior - behavior that probably has nothing  <br/>
at all to do with greed or materialism or manipulation by Madison  <br/>
Avenue or whatever/however I&#39;m thinking of it.<br/>
<br/>
There does seem to be a human urge to trade (buy and sell) - to give  <br/>
something in order to get something - and to end up better off after  <br/>
the trade. Pokemon and other trading card games are an example of kids  <br/>
getting really into this. There is a game we&#39;ve played at big Girl  <br/>
Scout campouts (not official, something the girls came up with to do  <br/>
in their nonscheduled time). It is called &quot;Bigger or Better.&quot; Girls  <br/>
from one troop or group will find something around their campsite to  <br/>
trade. It might be a pinecone or a marble or a pretty leaf or a stick  <br/>
of gum - anything. They go around to other campsites and ask, &quot;Bigger  <br/>
or Better?&quot; The girls at that site make offers of things to trade for  <br/>
the original item - the original girls keep looking until they get an  <br/>
offer they accept - then both groups keep going and going. It often  <br/>
ends up, at campouts, with a group getting some kind of special food  <br/>
goodie, some specialty treat made over a campfire or something. When  <br/>
you eat what you traded for - that pretty much ends that round &lt;G&gt;.  <br/>
They have a blast doing this and it can go on for the entire 2 or 3  <br/>
days of camping. And the things they are trading? Usually a pretty  <br/>
leaf or a piece of string - never anything &quot;valuable&quot; at all.<br/>

Right.  Rearranging the coffee table, as it were (only various other  <br/>
tables and places in the house) so that there&#39;s always something  <br/>
interesting and new (or older to be revived, or newish and not to be  <br/>
forgotten).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Librarians and teachers and store owners do it with displays and  <br/>
bulletin boards and such.<br/>

I was just over at the Dave&#39;s Garden site looking at offers of seed- <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844775658">Thanks for all the responses. <br/>
<br/>
I do try to engage with him and the new object, but usually he&#39;s not <br/>
interested and instead goes back to his old activities or toys. We <br/>
keep a basket under our coffee table with newer things and I try to <br/>
rotate them out onto the coffee table, but they still don&#39;t get <br/>
attention. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s almost as if he is falling back on habit when he gets home, if <br/>
that make sense. He has his things he enjoys doing at home. When we <br/>
are out he gets excited about something *new* but when back at home <br/>
he&#39;s goes back to his regular stuff. So I&#39;m kinda perplexed as to <br/>
whether or not he&#39;s actually interested in the new thing in the first <br/>
place or if his regular stuff is just overshadowing it.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been out of school for almost 2 yrs so for awhile I thought this <br/>
was still a deschooling thing. Like maybe he still associates certain <br/>
things with school and that&#39;s why he drops them. But why pick them up <br/>
in the first place if that&#39;s the case? My DH pointed out that he <br/>
tends to decline *any* new experiences. He was wondering if it&#39;s a <br/>
throw-back to the timidness he picked up in school when it came to <br/>
new things (he got a LOT of criticism at school). For instance, he <br/>
told DH the other day that he likes to only do his fave things cuz <br/>
he&#39;s good at them and he&#39;s &quot;not good at other stuff&quot;. He used to golf <br/>
with DH but quit when he thought he wasn&#39;t as good as he should be. <br/>
He refuses to touch anything art related because he &quot;sucks at art&quot; <br/>
(but will have fun if it&#39;s a project without a preconceived outcome). <br/>
The other day he didn&#39;t want to go to the Ren Faire but since it was <br/>
the last minute he reluctantly went anyway. Once there he had a <br/>
blast. It&#39;s like when he&#39;s out and about he&#39;s more open to new <br/>
experiences but once at home he feels caccooned in his environment <br/>
and closes up. <br/>
<br/>
Does that make sense? Do you think these two things (disinterest in <br/>
new items and timidness for new experiences) seem like they could be <br/>
related? And if so, should I just continue supporting, strewing, etc <br/>
or should I be trying something new at this point?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212164505">Bigger and Better is an OLD old game; one guy in Canada traded one red<br/>
paperclip up to a house (the book, incidentally, is titled One Red<br/>
Paperclip-my kids and I read that one together). Anywho, I&#39;m<br/>
relatively new to posting here, but my family and I have been<br/>
experimenting with homeschooling (eclectically) for over 4 years or<br/>
so. I have three girls, 15 year old twins and an 8 yo. My 8 yo<br/>
often-like many 8 (38) year olds- wants what she sees. I don&#39;t think<br/>
it is unreasonable to say &quot;let&#39;s sleep on that purchase&quot;. Money is<br/>
tight at our house but I&#39;m frugal by choice as well. My 8yo can go to<br/>
the library and check out an entire section if she chooses. If things<br/>
aren&#39;t so interesting once she&#39;s home, so what? Sometimes the &quot;cover&quot;<br/>
is more interesting than the concept, and often we get caught up in<br/>
the moment. But if I&#39;m paying for it, and she has a habit of wanting<br/>
things that are new and (seemingly) exciting, then I would table it:<br/>
maybe just as long as it takes to run another errand. I suggest trying<br/>
the tactic of putting some time and space between a desire and a<br/>
possible acquisition.<br/>
<br/>
Case in point: my daughters loved the science experiments we did a few<br/>
months ago (making a volcano, blowing up a ziplock bag with baking<br/>
soda and vinegar, making pepper dance, etc.). We liked it so much that<br/>
I went to the library and grabbed tons of books on science experiments<br/>
you can do at home. Well, September came around and my 8 yo joined<br/>
cheerleading, art classes resumed, she started musical theatre dance<br/>
and violin. We have not resumed our reading of the Narnia series and<br/>
we&#39;re both OK with that. We&#39;ve found other interests. The twins are<br/>
taking a formal biology course now, complete with labs, so they are<br/>
not interested in our &quot;homey&quot; science experiments. We haven&#39;t done a<br/>
science experiment since August.<br/>
<br/>
I struggle with the delicate balance of guiding and infringing. I<br/>
don&#39;t necessarily think that because your son drops a game after the<br/>
thrill of receiving it has past that it&#39;s your clue to pick up the<br/>
activity (unless it&#39;s an activity that you want to pick up and YOU are<br/>
interested in). However, if your son drops his new interests then<br/>
claims he&#39;s bored, maybe that is a call for assistance and that would<br/>
be a great time to bring out a new game, book, or conduct an at-home<br/>
science experiment. -<br/>

&gt; was still a deschooling thing. Like maybe he still associates certain<br/>
&gt; things with school and that&#39;s why he drops them. But why pick them up<br/>
&gt; in the first place if that&#39;s the case? My DH pointed out that he<br/>
&gt; tends to decline *any* new experiences.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s like when he&#39;s out and about he&#39;s more open to new<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; experiences but once at home he feels caccooned in his environment<br/>
&gt; and closes up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he&#39;s happy being at home doing what he&#39;s doing, even though he does<br/>
the same things over and over, I would let him be.  Let&#39;s say, for<br/>
example, he really likes a particular video game and plays it a lot. <br/>
Instead of taking him to a bookstore, take him to a game store and get<br/>
him a new game.  Whatever it is that he IS doing at home, at to that.<br/>
<br/>
If he balks at new experiences, yet has fun when he does end up going,<br/>
you are lucky!  I have one child who did that for years and one who will<br/>
refuse to go, even if everyone else wants to.  So he&#39;s good at going<br/>
with the flow, that&#39;s a blessing, really really!<br/>
<br/>
So make outings about him.  Whatever he&#39;s doing at home comes from<br/>
somewhere out there in the wider world.  Go to lego stores, go on thrift<br/>
store hunts to find those collectible &quot;whatevers&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
He used to enjoy golfing with his dad, set up a minature golf course in<br/>
your house or yard.  My grandpa golfed, it was his passion.  When I was<br/>
a kid I was mildly interested simply because he was my grandpa.  When he<br/>
came to visit us, he&#39;d set up a little golf course or driving range in<br/>
our back yard and he let me play with him, it was awesome!  I&#39;ve never<br/>
played on a real golf course, nor do I have the desire to, but I can<br/>
appreciate the game because of my experience.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252348270">-=-It&#39;s almost as if he is falling back on habit when he gets home, if<br/>
that make sense. He has his things he enjoys doing at home. When we<br/>
are out he gets excited about something *new* but when back at home<br/>
he&#39;s goes back to his regular stuff.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe museums and playgrounds would be good things to do when you&#39;re  <br/>
out then.  Or at a mall or shopping center, just take your time and  <br/>
let him explore ramps and such instead of rushing him along.<br/>
<br/>
People who are happy with their old stuff at home... that&#39;s good!<br/>
<br/>
Someone on this list, I think, keeps a notebook in her purse with the  <br/>
lists of things people have said they might want, and the thing to do  <br/>
is to write it in the book. Then later, some things aren&#39;t as  <br/>
desired, or if they are, the mom has a chance to find it on sale or  <br/>
used, maybe.   But action was taking.  The mom wrote it down, she  <br/>
didn&#39;t say no.  And she can ask later (if it&#39;s not nearly a gift- <br/>
giving day) if the kid&#39;s still interested.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298302067">I had another couple of shopping-related thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
If he really likes to buy things, get him to help you with birthday  <br/>
shopping and Christmas gifts for other relatives outside the  <br/>
immediate family, maybe (it&#39;s too hard sometimes for kids to keep  <br/>
those kinds of secrets, so don&#39;t do it for siblings).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s &quot;Toys for Tots&quot; season in the U.S. (maybe other places, I don&#39;t  <br/>
know how widespread it is), when people donate toys for gifts for  <br/>
poorer children.  I think there&#39;s a $5 minimum and the gifts should  <br/>
be new and still in the packaging, if any.   Maybe he would get as  <br/>
much joy out of buying for someone else as for himself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121204864">Hi Tara,<br/>
<br/>
I think I recognise what you&#39;re saying. <br/>
<br/>
My son do play with the same toy or activity for a long period of <br/>
time. It just seems to me, his interest is deep and long and <br/>
always &quot;on-going&quot;. Even tho he might have stop doing something, say <br/>
stop playing the Lego star wars game, it doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s finsihed <br/>
with it. On contrary, he is just taking a break from it, recharge by <br/>
playing with something else, then get back to it eventually.  <br/>
<br/>
So, it is common to see him amusing hismefl with the same old toys <br/>
or games on a regular basis. It&#39;s his way of making sense of that <br/>
toy or testing out that idea he&#39;s got in his mind. He&#39;s playing, and <br/>
that&#39;s what is most important. <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ll say to you, when he&#39;s had enough, he&#39;ll be ready for new <br/>
things. Till then, he&#39;ll just be as happy and content and <br/>
comfortable with what he has and wants to do. <br/>
<br/>
My son is 8, and even tho is open to trying alot of different <br/>
activities, is still not keen to pick up any new activities, and is <br/>
very much happy and stuck with what he&#39;s is doing. Which is playing <br/>
with his Lego, ps2, psp, watching tv, and burning stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kid will always never fails to want something when we&#39;re in the <br/>
mall or library. Well, afterall, when we&#39;re in the mall, he sees me <br/>
buying stuff (even tho it&#39;s household stuff LOL!), so he&#39;s only <br/>
mirroring what I am doing. <br/>
<br/>
So, I make it the point to take him window shopping too, allowing <br/>
him to touch and play to his heart&#39;s content, and SHOULD a toy <br/>
really sticks with him (this means he is definetely sure about that <br/>
toy), he&#39;s allowed to buy it with his pocket money. <br/>
<br/>
If he hasn&#39;t got enough, and if the toy is nothing more than a <br/>
fiver, I&#39;ll either top it up or I&#39;ll buy it for him. Anything more <br/>
than that will require us to &quot;save up for it&quot; which means we&#39;ll be <br/>
able to get it next week. So he&#39;ll have to pick a cheaper option or <br/>
wait for it next week.  <br/>
<br/>
But there are times I&#39;m aware he&#39;s tired, he&#39;s confused and he is <br/>
whiny, and need to buy something, just for the sake of buying <br/>
something- an immediate &quot;happy fix&quot;. Well he need a fix, what can I <br/>
say. <br/>
<br/>
So if he cannot make up his mind, I&#39;ll suggest a few options and <br/>
shops to visit, which is usually somewhere nice and cheap, like a <br/>
bookshop for a book, or newsstand for a magazine that he&#39;ll read <br/>
someday, or something that will come handy to him later on - like <br/>
additional tracks to add onto his model train set. But it is always <br/>
with a fixed budget of nothing more than GBP3. <br/>
<br/>
We have gone into Lush to buy him a bathbomb for his bath later, and <br/>
he had a lovely and happy time touching and sniffing evry thing in <br/>
that shop. We have also bought something for someone else instead, <br/>
like he bought a little toy for his little cousin, happy knowing <br/>
that she&#39;ll be happy receiving it (despite the fact that we won&#39;t be <br/>
seeing her soon,  not in the next 9 months LOL!) <br/>
<br/>
I have suggested driving by the library to rent a movie or a game <br/>
disc which is cheaper. Sometimes he sometimes think is a great idea, <br/>
and gets him happy again, just deciding which movie or game to get.  <br/>
<br/>
So maybe the next time your kid needs &quot;a happy fix&quot; by buy <br/>
something, perhaps you can help him by suggesting more options.   <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes<br/>

&lt;stuff&quot;. He used to golf with DH but quit when he thought he wasn&#39;t <br/>
&lt;as good as he should be. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tara, you need to give him more time. It is possible it&#39;s something <br/>
to do with school, whereby he thinks nothing he does is good enough. <br/>
My son was feeling this way when we first took him out of school. He <br/>
would only do things that he knows he will be able to ace it. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;He refuses to touch anything art related because he &quot;sucks at art&quot; <br/>
&lt;(but will have fun if it&#39;s a project without a preconceived <br/>
&lt;outcome).<br/>
<br/>
My son hates Maths, art and writing and the whole lot. He hates art <br/>
because he doesn&#39;t like the feeling of glue on his fingers. He hates <br/>
painting because it&#39;s a &quot;girl thing&quot;. But he&#39;ll cut and cellotape <br/>
and draw and colour with marker pen and make things (it&#39;s NOT art, <br/>
so he claims).<br/>
<br/>
My son hates anything that&#39;s got a timer on it, still do. He hates <br/>
games with timer on it. He still thinks that he&#39;ll fail if he is <br/>
being time on anything. This is definetely to do with his thinking <br/>
of &quot;in-ability to match up to the expectation&quot;. Which is why I do <br/>
not place any expectation upon him. <br/>
<br/>
I praise by sharing his happiness and sense of achievement with him <br/>
on whatever good work he feels worthy enough to share with us. A <br/>
treat or a smother him with kisses session of which he can actually <br/>
tell me &quot;Stop!! it is only a SMALL thing that didn&#39;t warrant so many <br/>
sloberring kisses !! <br/>
<br/>
In the beginning, I spend alot of time sitting next to him, being <br/>
involve with his daily activities, which is often open-ended. And <br/>
we&#39;re cool with it because it just seems like with DS&#39;s nature to <br/>
have  ongoing and never-ending projects. To him, it is, but of <br/>
course to us parents, we can see how it metamorphed from one mini <br/>
project to another. <br/>
<br/>
By me spending lots of time next to him, it&#39;s helping to give him <br/>
the message that I am enjoying whatever he is doing so much, that I <br/>
am happy to let him lead us into any activities. &quot;Little sense of <br/>
achivements building up into mountains &quot; i used to tell hubby.  <br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, he&#39;s quite happy plodding along on his own. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; The other day he didn&#39;t want to go to the Ren Faire but since it <br/>
was the last minute he reluctantly went anyway. Once there he had a <br/>
&gt; blast. It&#39;s like when he&#39;s out and about he&#39;s more open to new <br/>
&gt; experiences but once at home he feels caccooned in his environment <br/>
&gt; and closes up. <br/>
<br/>
My kid used to have pre-concieved idea to any events, that he&#39;ll not <br/>
enjoy himself, but once there, can have a fabulous time. But he can <br/>
actually convinced himself into a twist, that he&#39;ll have a horirble <br/>
time and still insist on going home when we arrive. <br/>
<br/>
So I always gives him an option. That we&#39;ll go and check it out, and <br/>
should he still thinks he&#39;ll not want to stay for the party or <br/>
event, then it&#39;s fine, we&#39;ll leave immediately. I alway tells him <br/>
that everybody is entitled to feeling horrible for the day. And <br/>
nobody has to do what they don&#39;t want to.  <br/>
<br/>
Over time he has learned that sometimes even tho his brain &quot;plays <br/>
trick on him by making him not want to go&quot;, he can actually change <br/>
his mind and decide to stay on for some fun. <br/>
<br/>
Tara, my kid&#39;s diagnosed as asperger, even tho alot of his <br/>
limitation is no longer in existing or relevant in our happy and <br/>
carefree unschooling life. But what I&#39;ve mentioned above, was and <br/>
still is my support towards his emotional issues, asperger or not. <br/>
It ws just naturally him.   <br/>
<br/>
My kid is a perfectionist, and need constant help to make him <br/>
understand that &quot;it&#39;s ok to make mistake&quot;, and that we&#39;re human, and <br/>
all human makes mistakes. Now that we&#39;re unschooling, we had all the <br/>
time, freedom and space to help him understand that he is allowed to <br/>
make all the mistakes without being label as stupid or incompetent.<br/>
<br/>
He understands now that making mistake is not a crime, and it <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean he is &quot;not good enough&quot;. It&#39;s natural, and is what <br/>
helps makes him a cleverer boy, day by day. I told him the story of <br/>
Thomas Edison. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s coming to nearly 2 years of unschooling now, we&#39;re still having <br/>
alot of inpromtu discussion about all his previous heartaches and <br/>
troubles in school. It&#39;s just him needing to make sense of it. <br/>
<br/>
He still goes back into his comfort zone of predictability and <br/>
familiarity,  when the going gets too much, especially if he has <br/>
extend himself into something new like friends and homeschooling <br/>
groups.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So Tara, my advice will be just accept him for what he is. All kids <br/>
will eventually find the right balance and the right medium for <br/>
thier own development. And most of the time, it is not something <br/>
we&#39;ll recognised. Perhaps, he is already blossoming in his mind now, <br/>
and is yet to manifest it physically, which is why you do not <br/>
recognised it.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
<br/>

with the library books.  i get an idea of some things they find <br/>
interesting and even if we dont look at them again, i might find a <br/>
video on netflix or look online for cool stuff that is related to it.  <br/>
my oldest is interested in WWII for example.  we listened to a book on <br/>
tape about a boy and what life was like living in the U.S. during the <br/>
war.  I then got the movie Empire of the Sun.  When they mentioned <br/>
Pearl Harbor in the movie, my son recognized it from the book and asked <br/>
me about it.  This all came from his looking at a library book about <br/>
WWII for a few minutes.  He plays on Roblox alot and is creating a <br/>
world that has american and german soldiers.  He pulls in information <br/>
from these other sources to feed his immagination in Roblox.  Honestly, <br/>
if someone fromt he outside to spend a day in our house lately, they <br/>
would think all he does is play Roblox.  But, if you watch more closely <br/>
you see how he incorporates things he experiences and learns into his <br/>
play.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461337328">-=-Case in point: my daughters loved the science experiments we did a  <br/>
few<br/>
months ago (making a volcano, blowing up a ziplock bag with baking<br/>
soda and vinegar, making pepper dance, etc.). We liked it so much that<br/>
I went to the library and grabbed tons of books on science experiments<br/>
you can do at home. Well, September came around and my 8 yo joined<br/>
cheerleading, art classes resumed, she started musical theatre dance<br/>
and violin. We have not resumed our reading of the Narnia series and<br/>
we&#39;re both OK with that. We&#39;ve found other interests. The twins are<br/>
taking a formal biology course now, complete with labs, so they are<br/>
not interested in our &quot;homey&quot; science experiments. We haven&#39;t done a<br/>
science experiment since August.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not really &quot;an experiment&quot; if the outcome is known.  Then it&#39;s  <br/>
reproducible results.  But that&#39;s fun!  If you think of it as  <br/>
&quot;playing with backing soda&quot; or  messing around with pepper, then it&#39;s  <br/>
playing.  It&#39;s still learning, because it&#39;s new to each kid, or  <br/>
entertainment, because they&#39;ve done it before but they have an even  <br/>
better idea for it this time, but it&#39;s part of deschooling to  <br/>
discover that what school called &quot;experiments&quot; were really  <br/>
demonstrations of known reactions<br/>
<br/>
Reactions are fun, though--all kinds of balloon play, like flinking  <br/>
helium balloons--weighting them just enough that they stay halfway  <br/>
between the floor and the ceiling; putting little super balls into  <br/>
balloons before adding Helium and bouncing them around the room  <br/>
(Holly&#39;s idea on Kirby&#39;s birthday, when we had rented a helium tank).<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian has some good projects:<br/>

We follow trails, in a connect-the-dots kind of way.  It makes all of  <br/>
life kinda like a board game.  One thing leads to another down all  <br/>
these little trails, and there&#39;s strategy and there&#39;s chance.  It&#39;s a  <br/>
big world-sized cooperative board game.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Holly and I watched The Flight of the Navigator.  It would  <br/>
take me as long to list the comments and connections as it did for us  <br/>
to watch the movie.  In some ways it&#39;s a good movie.  The ship is  <br/>
great!   The logic of the story and the continuity are pretty lame.   <br/>
So great special effects, kinda-cool idea, weird details.   Paul  <br/>
Rubens (as Paul Mall) did the voice of the ship, and Holly&#39;s a big  <br/>
fan of PeeWee&#39;s Big Adventure, which she referenced the other day  <br/>
when we learned that Diana Jenner&#39;s bike was stolen.  I didn&#39;t  <br/>
recognize the teenaged girl (or young woman) in the story but when I  <br/>
read it in the credits, Holly said sure, she had recognized her right  <br/>
away.  Sarah Jessica Parker.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not recommending this movie to others, just recommending being  <br/>
open to all sorts and directions of connections in whatever you do.<br/>

Searching for &#39;bath fizzy&#39; got a lot of results.  Garden Botanika<br/>
calls them bath fizzies/fizzy as does the Body Shop.<br/>

&gt; What&#39;s a bathbomb? I think I want one!<br/>
&gt; My best guesses are bath oil in a little dissolvable ball, or a block<br/>
&gt; of bath salts that dissolves and might have scent and color. Those<br/>
&gt; were common when I was a kid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope it&#39;s better than those, though those were nice to play with.<br/>
&gt; My grandmother (Mamaw, my dad&#39;s mom, in Rotan, Texas) always had some<br/>
&gt; of those things.<br/>

&gt; I went to google uk and it&#39;s FULL of bath bombs. Do they have these<br/>
&gt; in the U.S.?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh. Maybe my kids are just too old or I don&#39;t hang around artsy<br/>
&gt; shops enough. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-932138384">We have a natural soap shop here called Lush, and they sell soap by <br/>
weight. They have loads of lovely things like jelly soap, and <br/>
colourful bubble bath bars and they all have lovely names and smells.  <br/>
<br/>
They fizzle and swizzle around the bath water, creating lovely scent <br/>
and colour.  One of DS&#39;s favourite is Blackberry bombs, which had him <br/>
smelling like blackerry from head to toe!! Hmmmm...yummy!! We had the <br/>
one that turned the water into aqua blue. <br/>
<br/>
Infact, DS uses them to do his water experiments in the bath. I cut <br/>
them into little chunks, so he&#39;ll have little jars with different <br/>
smells and different colours, mixing them up into different scents and <br/>
colours LOL!!  <br/>
<br/>
My current favourite is their shampoo bar.  <br/>

do  <br/>

I went to the mall this morning, just to go to a bath shop, just to  <br/>
ask if they had a bath bomb.  No, and she hadn&#39;t heard of them, but  <br/>
when I described what I had learned this morning, she showed me a  <br/>
peppermint fizzy-bath tablet, which looked like and smelled like a  <br/>

It&#39;s fun to see what the range of stuff is on those, though!<br/>

Thanks, Flo!  I ordered some of hers, and I plan to order some of the  <br/>
Lush ones for Christmas gifts, too.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has decided to stay in Austin and work all the holidays again  <br/>
this year (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year&#39;s) because he&#39;ll make  <br/>
double time, and then come here for ten days in January.  Last year  <br/>
his Christmas box didn&#39;t get there for a MONTH.  He had nothing for  <br/>
Christmas.  I felt deeply terrible.   I mailed it priority mail, but  <br/>
somehow it got in with &quot;just whenever&quot; mail and then lost or something.<br/>
<br/>
This year I&#39;ve already started collecting little items to mail in a  <br/>
couple or three different boxes, with &quot;open on the 23rd, open the  <br/>
24th, put this in the freezer and open tomorrow after work...&quot; stuff  <br/>
like that, so he&#39;ll be entertained and have things to do while his  <br/>
roommate is gone.  One of those gifts is definitely going to be a  <br/>
bath bomb.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad for the sparkly knowledge of people on this list, and I&#39;m  <br/>
glad that I&#39;m easily amused and so are my kids!<br/>

I&#39;ve really been enjoying Kenny Shopsin the last week or two. He&#39;s a cook in New York who just co-authored a cookbook/autobiography called Eat Me the Food and Philosophy of Kenny Shopsin. The food is fantastic, David fixed the most wonderful corn chowder last night. And the mac and cheese pancakes are amazing. He&#39;s written a couple of things that feel like the same thing as being easily amused. And I keep thinking about his words: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I often compare my ideas about cooking to the children&#39;s book Goodnight Moon, by Margaret Wise Brown, where the little boy discoveres that everything he needs in life is in his life already, right in his own room. In a Goodnight Moon  world, it&#39;s pretty easy to be a good home cook. It&#39;s really not about having some terrific skills or exotic ingredients or expensive high_tech equipment. It&#39;s not even about having the right secret recipe. To be a good cook, to turn out good, honest food that satisfies your individual tastes, it is all about having the kind of confidence ans self-awareness that comes from Goodnight Moon living, in which you are happy with what is already in your life. <br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I cook about ninety dozen eggs every Saturday and every Sunday, and I enjoy cooking them each time I do it. I like cracking the eggs into a bowl. I like breaking the yolks and whisking them with cream for scrambled eggs. I like watching the ripples form as they cook, and I like the process of gently running my fork through cooked eggs to create space for the raw egg to hit the pan. When I&#39;m making fried eggs and sunnies, I like heating the butter in the pan; I like sliding the eggs in to the butter; and I like sliding the finished eggs from the pan onto a plate. I like everything there is about making eggs, and no matter how many times I do it, I still like doing it. There&#39;s nothing else I&#39;d rather be doing. I don&#39;t come to the task from a place of drudgery or boredom. I come to it from a place of curiosity and love. To be a good cook you have to. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe those kinds of ideas, the being happy with what you already have in your life opens up access to being easily engaged and amused. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That whole quote was beautiful, but I wanted to say that this reminds  <br/>
me of how I feel most of the time about my dishes.  I like my dishes,  <br/>
so I LIKE to wash them and put them back in their own little patterns  <br/>
and piles, and then I like to use them again and to put food in or on  <br/>
just the right one.<br/>
<br/>
Most of my dishes are from thrift stores.  A few were gifts, some are  <br/>
&quot;SCA dishes&quot; (blown glass or pottery that can be used for  <br/>
medievalesque purposes), a few are things the kids and I did when  <br/>
they were little at paint your own pottery places.  When something  <br/>
has a negative memory or is irritating, I either give it away or  <br/>
stuff it up or back where it&#39;s not in daily rotation.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of a &quot;&#39;Goodnight Moon&#39; world,&quot; as he said, that world  <br/>
(though contained) still had the moon and animals and things that  <br/>
aren&#39;t usually inside.  So that reminds me of patterns within  <br/>
patterns, which goes back to the show about fractals.  If Kenny  <br/>
Shopsin is commending a life of accepting and appreciating what is at  <br/>
hand, then a pattern within that is appreciating the swirls in the  <br/>
pan when scrambled eggs are cooking.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can ideally be about rearranging the interesting little  <br/>
things you already have in your life, in your house, in your mind-- <br/>
sharing ideas, and songs, and clothes, and food.  Puzzles.  Movies.<br/>
<br/>
You quoted Kenny Shopsin:  &quot;I cook about ninety dozen eggs every  <br/>
Saturday and every Sunday...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a professional, so that&#39;s a business expense, the 90 dozen  <br/>
eggs.  But it reminds me of unschoolers who keep a wall of &quot;we can&#39;t  <br/>
do it, we can&#39;t afford it, that costs money&quot; between them and  <br/>
enriching their lives, when they might just need to see things  <br/>
differently (including how money should be spent) or get over the  <br/>
idea that educational materials come from &quot;Gifts for the Gifted&quot;  <br/>
kinds of catalogs, and not from yard sales or dumpsters.<br/>
<br/>
So two videos for those who want some visuals.   Kenny Shopsin making  <br/>
macaroni and cheese pancakes, and an Animaniacs version of Goodnight  <br/>
Moon:<br/>
