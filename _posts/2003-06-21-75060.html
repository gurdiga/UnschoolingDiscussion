<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213923046">I looked up Maroon in an old middle school dictionary we have:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Put (a person) ashore in a lonely place and leave him.<br/>
2.  Leave in a lonely, helpless position.<br/>
3.  Descendant of escaped Negro slaves living in the West Indies and Surinam.<br/>
<br/>
Hmpf.  I always thought of the statement, &quot;What a Maroon&quot; in bugs bunny slang <br/>
as meaning a chump, or fool. <br/>

Bugs)<br/>
<br/>
I loved the scene in &quot;Wayne&#39;s World&quot; when Garth asks Wayne something like, <br/>
&quot;Do you ever get turned on when Bugs Bunny dresses up like a woman?&quot; and Wayne <br/>
looks at him disbelieving and says, &quot;NO!!&quot;  Garth answers back, flustered, &quot;Me <br/>
neither,...I just wondered....&quot;<br/>

maroon....<br/>
<br/>
But to me, mostly, maroon is a color. A deep red. I love deep red, <br/>
but the word maroon is not used very often. Kinda an ugly word. And <br/>
probably the only reason i know it is from a 19-seventy-something <br/>
maroon pontiac lemans that my parents owned-- LOL<br/>

maroon or a moron.. SHE applied the name to herself.. not me.   So, I guess <br/>
me asking whether she meant maroon or moron (and, honestly, I only knew the <br/>
definitions you listed for maroon) is a moot point.    natter natter natter.<br/>
