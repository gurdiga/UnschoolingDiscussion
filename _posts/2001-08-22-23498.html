<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144743413">Send her to www.unschooling.com to the debate boards? <br/>
<br/>
Hand her a stack of John Holt books and say, &quot;Here. Come back when you&#39;ve<br/>
read these and can argue intelligently&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Tell her that you and she are simply too far apart on your opinions of what<br/>
children need to know and why and when they need to know it, and how people<br/>
(including children and lazy, stupid adults) learn, to have any kind of<br/>
reasoned discussion, and just drop it?<br/>
<br/>
If she is *actually interested* in learning about unschooling, you know<br/>
where to point her for resources. If she just wants to argue you into<br/>
teaching prepositions and other lofty and wildly important life skills, you<br/>
don&#39;t have to play.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-906128008">Lazy and stupid adults. <br/>
<br/>
Using her own argument, how come there stupid if they went to p.s.?  <br/>
Why are they lazy?  Didn&#39;t their P.E. teacher &quot;teach&quot; them the <br/>
virtues of being and staying fit?<br/>
