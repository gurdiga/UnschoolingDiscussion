<br/>
The Rolling Stones have a song about that!<br/>
<br/>
The other day I was in the car and heard part of a song, and I&#39;m not sure <br/>
what it was!  <br/>
Maybe someone here will recognize it.<br/>
<br/>
It sounded like the guitar parts of the Beatles &quot;Day Tripper,&quot; but it sounded <br/>
more solidly like the Rolling Stones&#39; &quot;Satisfaction,&quot; and maybe it was <br/>
building up to be neither.  Anyone know who or what that was?<br/>
