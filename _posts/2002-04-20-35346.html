Same here. I&#39;m not obsessed, but I can see why they like it. I&#39;m too awful at <br/>
the game to get obsessed with it!!! I have zero coordination, it frustrates <br/>
my ds to watch me play.<br/>
He just beat the entire game after about a week of ownership. I think that&#39;s <br/>
pretty amazing. I offered to have a party to celebrate....he just looked at <br/>
me funny and said &quot;Mom, it wasn&#39;t that hard.&quot;<br/>
Well  *I* thought it was!!!!<br/>

Actually they aren&#39;t easy, I used walkthroughs because my tolerance level<br/>
for frustration is low.  LOL  If your son was able to get through that<br/>
fast with no help I am impressed!  Of course, don&#39;t we always discount<br/>
the ability to do something that comes easy to us?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-816667136">I haven&#39;t played the game so I can&#39;t say anything about the skill required.<br/>
<br/>
However THAT is the game that got Chaelene reading.  Nothing sparked her<br/>
interest like that game.  Sometimes we were too busy to read for her and she<br/>
had to either wait or figure the words out.  She started figuring the words<br/>
out, quickly!<br/>
