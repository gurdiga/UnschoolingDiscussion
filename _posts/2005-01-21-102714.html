<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091156307">hi,<br/>
my name is Jo and i live in New Zealand with my dh Chris, and our two <br/>
boys Ben 5yrs and Josh 2yrs old...<br/>
<br/>
here in NZ we need to apply for an &#39;exemption&#39; to home educate, and in <br/>
the process of getting ready to write it, started looking around the net <br/>
for ideas and ran across some articles that lead me to this list...<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve been interested in home schooling a while, coming from a <br/>
natural/attachment parenting trust the child kind-of philosophy - so <br/>
learning just seems to flow on from there ...<br/>
<br/>
Ben is lots of fun, a caring kind kid who enjoys doing his own thing on <br/>
his own timetable - he seems to really come alive with millions of <br/>
questions and thoughts on how the world works in the evening, so i <br/>
struggle with that as i am more a thinking in the morning person!<br/>
<br/>
Josh is a bundle of energy and into all sorts of exploring - the higher <br/>
the better as he loves climbing up everywhere! Josh also has CHARGE <br/>
syndrome which keeps us busy with all the specialist appointments and <br/>
operations - but, he generally is doing typical two year old stuff, just <br/>
not walking/talking much yet but can communicate with sign language.<br/>
<br/>
My dh is a chemical engineer, and i am a SAHM and am into trying all <br/>
sorts of different handcrafts - haven&#39;t had much time for them since <br/>
Josh was born, but, as life settles down i&#39;ve been doing a little bit of <br/>
sewing again ... and am trying to get better at knitting lately.<br/>
<br/>
cheers,<br/>
Jo<br/>

 </span></blockquote>hi Robyn,<br/>
thanks for the welcome ... for some reason about half the posts i get <br/>
from yahoo lists are coming through to me several days after they get <br/>
posted, so i&#39;ve only just seen your reply ...<br/>
<br/>
my little &quot;CHaRGE&#39;r&quot; stands for Josh having charge syndrome, (i just <br/>
think it is a cute way of writing it as he is full on fun!), which Debs <br/>
posted a good summary of, it has many conditions that are included and <br/>
each anomoly can be quite variable in its affect on the person, so the <br/>
syndrome itself is variable in its severity. Josh has an anomoly from <br/>
each of the letters except the &quot;a&quot; so that is why it is lower case ... <br/>
he also has other stuff going on - so he gets more letters :0) ...<br/>
<br/>
uclbcp = unitaleral cleft lip and bilateral cleft palate<br/>
<br/>
HPTH = hypoparathyroidism (this affects his bodies abilities to regulate <br/>
calcium levels)<br/>
<br/>
a gtube is a gastrosomy-tube, a tube that goes straight into the stomach <br/>
through the tummy wall so we can fed Josh without him needing to swallow <br/>
- which he cannot do very well as his crainial nerves have probably not <br/>
fully developed (yet - hopefully they will as he gets older) ... he <br/>
actually has what is called a &quot;mic-key button&quot; rather than a tube now <br/>
that is prettier!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hope this helps, feel free to ask more questions if i&#39;ve been <br/>
unclear,<br/>
Jo</div>
