<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830908870">**I think asking someone &quot; why do you ask?&quot; is rude. It puts the other person<br/>
( the one to whom you are directing the question) on the defensive. What a<br/>
way to have a conversation! Maybe the other person is just nosy or curious<br/>
in which case you can take the responsibility of the conversation and say &quot;<br/>
I dont see why that matters.&quot; BOOM! End of subject. Now the other person can<br/>
stop talking about that subject, walk away or or explain why they think it<br/>
matters. In which case, you can yawn, look bored or  walk away.**<br/>
<br/>
Is there a substansive difference in politeness between the response &quot;Why do <br/>
you ask?&quot; and  &quot;I don&#39;t see why that matters.&quot;?  If so, why? Is yawning or <br/>
walking away less rude than answering a question with a question? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything inherently rude about the first question but<br/>
I think some are reading &quot;Why do you ask?&quot; and hearing a suspicious tone so<br/>
it comes across as &quot;Why are you prying into my life?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever used &quot;Why do you ask?&quot; in other than a (jokingly)<br/>
suspicious way but it *could* be asked in a polite curious tone to convey<br/>
&quot;Let me know why you&#39;re asking so I can answer your question better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The second&#39;s tougher to say politely since the words say the person is<br/>
rather foolish to have even asked, but tone and local convention can<br/>
override the connotation of words.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s one of the reasons on line communication is so tough. We<br/>
sometimes don&#39;t decode the words people speak. We just decode the tone or<br/>
apply the local meaning. And then on line we &quot;hear&quot; a familiar tone or<br/>
translate something into a local meaning when obviously there is no tone and<br/>
someone may be a continent away and have no idea how our neighbors use the<br/>
words.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid we&#39;d say in the neighborhood &quot;Drop dead,&quot; to mean &quot;Shut up<br/>
and go away.&quot; (Which, I guess, literally it would have that effect! ;-) But<br/>
now looking at the literal meaning it&#39;s hard to understand how we could have<br/>
used it so casually.<br/>
