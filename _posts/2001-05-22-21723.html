<div id="ygrps-yiv-921289727">I would like to ask again, as calmly and respectfully as possible that you try<br/>
not to be so antagonistic and insulting.[Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] ? Defending <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s easy for people to credit statements to the Indians which aren&#39;t.  I <br/>
think it was done here two days ago with &quot;It takes a village.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you should write a note to every person who&#39;s read the book and say <br/>
&quot;If you were inspired by ANYTHING in this, you should go back and undo that <br/>
feeling of peace and goodness you had.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Inspiration is a biochemical thing which can&#39;t be undone.  <br/>
<br/>
There are people who believe all of Christianity to be fable, myth and lie.  <br/>
And yet there are people who are HUGELY inspired by Christianity.<br/>
<br/>
There are people whose lives were saved many times over by St. Christopher, <br/>
and they gave money to the church in thanks, and they wrote poetry and carved <br/>
statues.  Then one day... OOPS!  Not a saint.<br/>
<br/>
And I repeat what I wrote in the post which was responded to with the new <br/>
title &quot;defending lies&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
.  In the long run, the<br/>
book<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; was recategorized as fiction and is still found useful by lots of people<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; its philosophy and inspiration, I suppose, which is what lots of novels<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not defending the book.  I haven&#39;t read it.  <br/>
