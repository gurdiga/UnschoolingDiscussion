the trash littering the roads. He made the comment, &quot;South Carolinians must <br/>
have the country&#39;s CLEANEST cars, because they throw all their trash out the <br/>
car windows!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Well, he definitely made the papers with THAT quote! &lt;G&gt; But it DID seem to <br/>
get some basketball fans to keep their trash INSIDE their windows! I&#39;ve never <br/>
seen anyone toss trash out he window, but there&#39;s always more crap out there <br/>
than you can count (until they clean it up---the chain gangs (w/o the <br/>
chains), that is!).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to believe how much trash there is here as opposed to in other <br/>
parts of the country. And I remember in Germany (MAJOR clean country!) that <br/>
there was a MOUND of trash just outside the gates of Rhein-Main Air Base. <br/>
Base was clean; Germany was clean; the quarter mile just outside the base was <br/>
a pig sty.<br/>

 NC is clean and green.. NC,  is &quot;the good roads&quot; state.   Every time I <br/>
travel outside of NC, the amount of trash on the road is shocking<br/>
