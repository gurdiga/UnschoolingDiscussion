<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559085594">Well, of course my main interest is in Pendle Hill, and Swarhmore, both of<br/>
which are probably not to far from you, in Lancashire.<br/>
<br/>
(I would have chosen Cambridge, too -- less auto pollution, but my<br/>
fellowship was tied to Oxford).  But Worcester was a GREAT place, where you<br/>
can actually identify the locations of Alice in Wonderland, complete with<br/>
where they paint the roses red! (they actually take out the yellow roses and<br/>
put in red ones around May 15, as I remember -- but it&#39;s almost 30 years<br/>
ago!)  And where they use swans to play croquet.  Unfortunately, the big<br/>
plane tree where the cheshire cat used to sit got taken down around 1987 --<br/>
disease got it after 350 years.  It&#39;s also the place DeQuincy smoked his<br/>
opium and saw ghosts!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569986167">Well, I only really know about Pendle from the beer, you know <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  And if anyone thinks that English beer is warm and flat, <br/>
they&#39;ve not had Yorkshire brewed bitter in a Yorkshire pub.  And <br/>
they&#39;ve never lived, either &lt;G&gt;<br/>
