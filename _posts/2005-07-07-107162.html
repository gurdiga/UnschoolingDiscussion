<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716154648">HI all,<br/>
<br/>
I am a long time lurker, rare poster and was hoping you all could give <br/>
me some advice.  I was contacted today by a friend of a friend who <br/>
wants to do a story on hsing in our city&#39;s monthly  magazine.  Her <br/>
exact words were:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Indianapolis Monthy wants me to feature five or six families that <br/>
homeschool....very different families who homeschool differently and <br/>
for different reasons (religious, intellectual, special needs, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Would you help me find some good folks? The articles will be very <br/>
short with a picture so I am seeking people who are passionate and <br/>
blunt about what they do, even if it alarms mainstream folks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am excited about the opportunity to share the ideas of unschooling, <br/>
but worry about bringing unwanted attention to my family.  I know that <br/>
some of you on these boards have &quot;outed&quot; your lifestyle in articles <br/>
and such and was wondering if there were any negative ramifications.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of things that cross my mind are that Indiana is a VERY easy <br/>
state to hs in and I keep thinking that sooner or later someone is <br/>
going to start a campaign to regulate hsing more in our state and <br/>
don&#39;t want to give them ammo.  Also, my youngest wants to try school <br/>
so, unless she changes her mind before then, she will be going to <br/>
first grade in our local public school.  I don&#39;t live in Indy but <br/>
close enough that it is very probable that some of those at this <br/>
school will read this article.   <br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be appreciated. <br/>
<br/>

Unless you are VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY comfortable and confident in <br/>
unschooling and its accompanying lifestyle, I wouldn&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
*I* have no problem being quite vocal about our decision to unschool, <br/>
and my car is a rolling advertisement for unschooling. BUT---unless you <br/>
exude confidence, unschooling can come across as stupid and neglectful, <br/>
and an interview can do more harm than good. If you KNOW what you&#39;re <br/>
doing is right and you can explain it well, go for it. If you&#39;re <br/>
wavering or the slightest bit unsure, I&#39;d avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
Journalists love sensationalism, and it could be that that&#39;s her angle. <br/>
She actually uses the words, &quot;blunt&quot; and &quot;alarms.&quot; That could be a <br/>
signal! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

circumstances are different, and some towns or states might have a crazy person <br/>
lurking and wanting to cause trouble, or someone&#39;s neighbor might be itchin&#39; to <br/>
call authorities.   I can&#39;t say that just because I haven&#39;t had problems that <br/>
others might not.<br/>
<br/>
My worst problems have been with journalists and their insensitivity and <br/>
ignorance.   Their story isn&#39;t as important as your life, so if it makes you <br/>
uncomfortable or you just simply don&#39;t want to mess with it, just say no.    The <br/>
stress won&#39;t do you and your kids any good, and the odds are small that their <br/>
article will make a big positive change in the world.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would say that I am about two and a half veries worth of <br/>
comfortable and confident--lol.  I have been doing this about four <br/>
years and it is only in the last year and a half or so that I have <br/>
been totally comfortable telling other hsers we unschool. I always <br/>
said unschooling when pressed to identify a style but usually <br/>
avoided having to do so and was always a little anxious about it.  <br/>
Now, I no longer worry about what other hsers think and will respond <br/>
to questions (expecially from newcomers) from an unschooling <br/>
perspective.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My lack of confidence doesn&#39;t come from a wavering belief in the <br/>
philosophy of unschooling but in my ability to do it as well as it <br/>
should be done.  I can explain it well and passionately to people <br/>
but I doubt the ability of a journalist who is just learning about <br/>
it to explain it sufficiently in 250 words. <br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those words concerned me a bit too. But, she is a friend of a friend <br/>
and I thought that she would be less likely to diss a friend of a <br/>
friend. I spoke to her today and explained it to her--I am not sure <br/>
how well she got it. I told her I would help get the word out to the <br/>
hs community that she was looking for people and she asked if we <br/>
would be the unschooling family and I told her yes (mostly because <br/>
my kids are excited about the idea).  But, I haven&#39;t been at peace <br/>
about it and my husband called about an hour ago and said he was <br/>
having second thoughts too--he was a little worried from her word <br/>
choice too that she is looking to stir up controversy.  <br/>
<br/>
I think  Sandra is right when she said that the stress on my family <br/>
isn&#39;t worth the small chance that it will make much of a <br/>
difference.  I will be telling her we change our mind.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you do decide to go with the interview, you could write down your<br/>
&quot;sound bites&quot; and practice them, so you have them to fall back on. <br/>
Writing them down will help you condense your viewpoint and keep you<br/>
very succinct and &quot;on message.&quot; <br/>

more chances to write and speak and have your message heard.<br/>

Someone with either all kids grown or some kids grown might be in the safest position to be the unschooling poster family.  If their methods sound crazy to outsiders, one can simply point out the results.<br/>

first considerations.  If you are &quot;underground&quot;, then you might not<br/>
want the attention.  Otherwise, there really is no harm in it and it<br/>

going to give anyone &quot;ammo&quot;, unless that is the motivation for the<br/>

<br/>
Although I understand some of the various reasons that homeschooled kids might want to &quot;try&quot; school, I think it might, to outsiders, reinforce the idea that most kids either need to or would prefer to spend the day in school with others their age, rather than at home with mom and siblings.  I say this with some personal experience, as my homeschooled since age 5 dd decided to check out 6th grade last fall.  I think the issues with young children &quot;trying&quot; school are quite different than for a child who has been unschooled for many of their school-age years.<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t underestimate the meddlesomeness and narrow thinking of other people.<br/>
<br/>
Here in CA, I&#39;ve run across more than one person who was surprised to find out that homeschoolers (including unschoolers) don&#39;t have to take standardized tests.  The fact that I could plainly state that kids in private schools here are also not required by law to take those tests didn&#39;t reassure them at all.  These people *believed *that conventional testing was worthwhile and necessary to verify the quality of education.  (I disagree strongly.)<br/>
<br/>
(There was a David Albert article years ago in HEM, with sample questions from his (elder) daughter&#39;s 4th or 5th grade Social Studies test.  Does anyone remember this article or know if it is available online?  I thought the sample questions, about the Civil War, really made the test look silly.)<br/>

Aug. 17 and the article won&#39;t run for a couple of weeks.  If I worked <br/>
in the school system and I saw this article, I would read it. And, if <br/>
someone mentioned in the article was from my town, I would take <br/>
special note and if they showed up at my school or in my classroom <br/>
less than a month later, I would remember. <br/>
<br/>
 I used to teach, so I know that, no matter how much an educator tries <br/>
to guard against it, if a parent is seen as a &quot;problem&quot;, this can <br/>
negatively effect attitudes toward the child. Some people are very <br/>
good at treating the child fairly in spite of this and others, <br/>
frankly, suck at it.   Now, they will know we hs and I will have no <br/>
problem being up-front with her teacher about what I think about <br/>
school and its methods should the need arise--I imagine I will be one <br/>
of the most involved, non-invested parents they have ever seen. But I <br/>
would rather not have them know that I think most of what they do is <br/>
counterproductive and a waste of time before they even get a chance to <br/>
know her.<br/>

I think it would be better for everyone involved if the families interviewed <br/>
have several years of experience with homeschooling, and here again is where <br/>
my personal view that children who aren&#39;t school-aged can&#39;t be really <br/>
homeschooled in ANY fashion kicks back in.     A child who starts school in first grade <br/>
can&#39;t really be said to have ever homeschooled.   Even if kindergarten is <br/>
&quot;mandatory,&quot; it&#39;s not mandatory everywhere.   If a child moves from a <br/>
non-kindergarten-requiring place to one where it&#39;s &quot;mandatory,&quot; she doesn&#39;t have to go to <br/>
kindergarten before first grade.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s move the discussion back to how people learn.   It&#39;s getting too far <br/>
from unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
