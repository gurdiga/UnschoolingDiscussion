<div id="ygrps-yiv-583822148">&quot;Point is: coercing chores makes it impossible for kids to offer <br/>
their acts of service as gifts of generosity. They are fulfilling <br/>
requirements, not loving family members.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I loved your whole post Julie...very inspirational!  <br/>
<br/>
I just have to share the latest at my house. My dh has always been a major neat freak and really can&#39;t stand our chaotic methods. Our solution was to make a space for him that is his own, completely separate so he can have peace/quiet/cleanliness that he desires.<br/>
But the upstairs still bugged him. He would quietly fume about it OR occasionally grump about the mess.<br/>
All of the sudden, THIS week, he had the epiphany. He told me that he realized that most of the problem was I didn&#39;t have enough help and instead of bugging the kids about it, he should just help me.<br/>
WOW! Very cool.<br/>
So he&#39;s been helping out more. And when he was sweeping the floor a couple days ago and I thanked him, he said &quot;well, it bugs me so I should be the one to take care of it.&quot;<br/>
Well knock me over with a feather! I just stood there with my mouth open. The unschooling philosophies are invading every corner of his brain, how totally amazing. HE GETS IT!!!<br/>
