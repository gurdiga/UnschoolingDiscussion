<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244014341">Lately when I need a recipe,  I go to google.com and enter enough to get <br/>
exactly the thing:<br/>
<br/>
You could put in <br/>
      peanut brittle microwave<br/>
and probably get several recipes with commentary.<br/>
<br/>
You could put in <br/>
     bath salts epsom baking soda<br/>
and get recipes and proportions and scents and history.</div>
