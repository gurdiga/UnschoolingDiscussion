&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; My <br/>
&gt;&gt; children are only 3 and 4 years old and they watch 6 or more hours per <br/>
&gt;&gt; day.   <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Do you watch it with them?  Do you learn the songs they&#39;re singing and <br/>
&gt;&gt; learn <br/>
&gt;&gt; the names of the characters? <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Do you take them places to get them out of the house? <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; (I&#39;m asking because that&#39;s what I was doing when mine were that young, and <br/>
&gt;&gt; it <br/>
&gt;&gt; didn&#39;t stress me out as much as I think I would&#39;ve been stressed if I&#39;d <br/>
&gt;&gt; just <br/>
&gt;&gt; been watching them watch somethign that wasn&#39;t familiar to me.) <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; These are good points.  I used to watch with them, but I can&#39;t get myself <br/>
&gt; to do it anymore.  This has been going on since September.  I know all the <br/>
&gt; songs, all the characters and stories.  I realize that they&#39;re up for 14 <br/>
&gt; hours per day so 6 or more hours doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not doing something <br/>
&gt; else, but it&#39;s hard to watch them.  I&#39;ve noticed my daughter is getting <br/>
&gt; heavier.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We used to go out a lot, but they don&#39;t want to do that.  My daughter says, <br/>
&gt; &quot;Maybe after we watch Monsters, Inc&quot;.  It usually doesn&#39;t end with one.  A <br/>
&gt; big part of me wants to unplug the tv and say it&#39;s not working, but I would <br/>
&gt; never do that.  We do try to go to gymnastics on Wednesday.  We&#39;ve missed a <br/>
&gt; lot, which is very hard for me because it costs a lot of money.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lately, I&#39;ve been coming to this board to see what people have to say about <br/>
&gt; their family&#39;s lifestyle.  I feel like I need to try something new.  Maybe <br/>
&gt; give them a choice of watching one movie and then doing something else, or <br/>
&gt; doing something first and then watching one movie.  I just can&#39;t let it go. <br/>
&gt;  They seem to have lost a lot of the curiosity, desire to explore, and to <br/>
&gt; do more physical things.  Maybe I&#39;m just concerned for no reason. <br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Patti, look at it THIS way: probably when they&#39;re 9 & 10, tv will have no <br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;hold&quot; on them as it does schooled, deprived, 9 & 10 year olds! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank You.  This makes me feel better.  I think sometimes I tend to worry <br/>
&gt; and be concerned about things when I really don&#39;t need to do that. <br/>

that takes, the more you&#39;ll know they were lacking before.<br/>
<br/>
If the freedom is NOT new, what are their options?  When&#39;s the last time <br/>
something cool came into the house?  When&#39;s the last time you took them to <br/>
see something they&#39;d never seen ever before?<br/>

Our new thing is some colored &quot;peanuts&quot; like used to be styrofoam packing <br/>
material, but now are sometimes made of corn starch, which dissolves in water.<br/>
<br/>
Someone thought to make them in colors and sell them as crafts supplies.<br/>
<br/>
Holly made some stuff, and then dissolved some in water.  The color stayed on <br/>
her and some of the texture.  Since it was brown, it looked truly like she <br/>
had poop on her hands.  She was THRILLED!    So she stuck some to her face, a <br/>
bunch of green ones.  And where they came off, there was rough green STUFF.  <br/>
So she and Marty are already planning costumes with makeup that involves this <br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
It will be easy to wash off, but it&#39;s dramatic in its appearance when it&#39;s <br/>
on!  <br/>
<br/>
The directions for that weren&#39;t on the box at all. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That was a strewing-their-paths moment, when I spent $6 at an office supplies <br/>
store when I was just actually in there for an inkjet cartridge.<br/>

end.<br/>

<br/>
They&#39;ve been watching a lot of tv since October.  I think the reason may be <br/>
that they got some new videos for their birthdays and Christmas.  I think <br/>
they&#39;ll eventually get bored with them all.<br/>
<br/>

see something they&#39;d never seen ever before?<br/>
<br/>
We have recently joined a Homeschool group and there&#39;s many kids for them to <br/>
play with and new activities for them to do, but that&#39;s only one day a week.  <br/>
They got many new things for Christmas, and I&#39;ve taken things down from their <br/>
closet shelves that they haven&#39;t played with or seen in a while.  Once my <br/>
kids have their minds set on something, there&#39;s really no changing it, at <br/>
least for most of the time.  They have always been very decisive, <br/>
independent, and never afraid to tell people what they think or feel, kind of <br/>
kids.  Right now there&#39;s really no talking them into something.  If they have <br/>
their minds set on watching tv, that&#39;s what they&#39;ll do.  I don&#39;t argue with <br/>
them or I try not to make them feel their choice to watch tv is not a good <br/>
choice.  Although they watch a lot of tv, during the other many hours they <br/>
are up, they do a lot of things.  I&#39;m quite sure I am worrying for nothing.  <br/>
Yesterday they only watched about 3 hours of tv.  One thing I noticed is that <br/>
they don&#39;t seem to be as creative, curious and physically active as they used <br/>
to be.  I&#39;m going to see if I can help them with that.  I know when I watch a <br/>
lot of tv, I get tired, lazy, and have no desire to do much of anything.  I&#39;m <br/>
not going to force or argue with them about watching tv, but I&#39;ll see if I <br/>
can excite them, get them out of the house more,  and get them interested in <br/>
something, like an indoor garden.<br/>
<br/>
Our new thing is some colored &quot;peanuts&quot; like used to be styrofoam packing <br/>
material, but now are sometimes made of corn starch, which dissolves in water.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter used to play with that a lot.  They are called Nuudles around <br/>
here.  We still have some and she plays with them now and then.  My son likes <br/>
to sort the colors and line them up.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your help!!<br/>
