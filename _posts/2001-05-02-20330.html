&gt;Hi Valerie!  We will soon be neighbors!  :-)  I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;seem to find my map of counties rght now, but we<br/>

<br/>
Val, you are a neighbor of mine as well :)<br/>
We also live in Tacoma - NE Tacoma on Dash Point<br/>
<br/>
Careful - 3 attempted rapes this last week in Tacoma<br/>
Pearl St ...by the zoo, and two other areas<br/>
I forget the other 2 streets - on tonights news<br/>
5/7&quot; male - grey hightlight hair - mid weight <br/>
35-40 years old ... have occured on main streets most during daylight hours<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nanci just  a note ... I love where I live, I have a wonderful neighborhood<br/>
of awesome neighbors (example: brought us a hot homecooked meal in <br/>
a basket when we were moving in, have block party barbecues - most<br/>
are homeschoolers - AWESOME nrighborhood .... )<br/>
<br/>
BUT ... I am moving out of here this summer most likely :<br/>
<br/>
Reason being : Pierce county is going nuts on raising rates<br/>
Our rent is a mere $1400 a mo ... not a biggie - pretty typical <br/>
and actually a very wonderful price for the beautiful home we <br/>
have by the water, with 4 bedrooms, 3 bath, hot tub - huge floorplan etc<br/>
....<br/>
BUT .... when you add on w/s/g/gas and power<br/>
it is costing us over $2000 a mo and keeps going higher ...<br/>
we have gas heat and conserve on energy more than a lot of people<br/>
but each bill the rates are higher<br/>
<br/>
and car tabs in pierce and king county are so much higher<br/>
my car is 10 yrs newer than my hubbys but registered in whatcom county <br/>
not pierce hubby registered his in pierce when we moved here<br/>
my tabs were 30$ his were almost $100<br/>
it is NUTS what they tax you on and raise down here that they dont in<br/>
other areas of WA state ... Hubby is askin his work to let him telecommute<br/>
so<br/>
we can go back to whatcom county where the air rating is the highest for<br/>
the country<br/>
(saw that on CNN the other night) and it is cheap to live ... <br/>
Just a heads up for some more things to think about ...<br/>
skagit, kitsap, thurston, mason and whatcom counties and across the<br/>
mountains<br/>
are the cheapest areas to live in WA<br/>

***Hi Rita. Yes, I woke up to this on the news this morning. Scary, but at<br/>
least the women were able to fight him off without much trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Hey my brother used to live in Brown&#39;s Point, before they moved across the<br/>
country and broke his mother&#39;s heart. Not that I&#39;m bitter. You&#39;re right, the<br/>
prices on anything around here make no sense. Power certainly shouldn&#39;t have<br/>
gone up like it did. At least the car tabs went *down*, they used to be<br/>
anywhere from $50 to over $500.<br/>
<br/>
later, my husband is nuzzling me....Valerie</div>

&gt;   my car is 10 yrs newer than my hubbys but registered in whatcom <br/>
county <br/>
&gt;   not pierce hubby registered his in pierce when we moved here<br/>
&gt;   my tabs were 30$ his were almost $100<br/>
&gt;   it is NUTS what they tax you on and raise down here that they <br/>
dont in<br/>
&gt;   other areas of WA state ... Hubby is askin his work to let him <br/>
telecommute<br/>
&gt;   so<br/>
&gt;   we can go back to whatcom county where the air rating is the <br/>
highest for<br/>
&gt;   the country<br/>
&gt;   (saw that on CNN the other night) and it is cheap to live ... <br/>
&gt;   Just a heads up for some more things to think about ...<br/>
&gt;   skagit, kitsap, thurston, mason and whatcom counties and across <br/>
the<br/>
&gt;   mountains<br/>
&gt;   are the cheapest areas to live in WA<br/>
&gt; <br/>

  wow, this post makes me glad to live in Tennessee. we have a 200 sq ft four<br/>
  bedroom home on ten acres of land and with mortgage, insurance, utilities<br/>
  and all, we dont pay more than $1200 a month! It costs $25 a year for car<br/>
  tags. Our property tax was $450 for a year and we have no income tax. Sales<br/>
  tax is high though.<br/>

  ***Agh!!! $450 for property taxes on TEN acres? Oh, I don&#39;t even want to<br/>
  talk about it...<br/>
