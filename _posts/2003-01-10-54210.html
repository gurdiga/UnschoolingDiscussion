<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If they do it all at once they don&#39;t necessarily have to use general<br/>

lot more involved than chloral hydrate in the dentists office. The<br/>
chloral hydrate s called conscious sedation. The child is very sleepy<br/>
and usually doesn&#39;t remember. More than nitrous oxide.<br/>

 Is this a liquid? I remember drinking a small cup of something before<br/>
having wisdom teeth out then waking up later all done. No problem.<br/>
