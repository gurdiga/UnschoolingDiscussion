<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027255296"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So I thought maybe my confidence makes people feel<br/>
&gt;uncomfortable.  Maybe I should list some doubts and<br/>
&gt;fears.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know you wrote this as an affirmation that you are<br/>
human and to make it clear that you do have fears and<br/>
doubts.  I know you can probably answer these doubts<br/>
yourself in the same ways that I have below, but I<br/>
thought it would be a good exercise for me in<br/>
affirmation as well, from the other side.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Sometimes I&#39;m afraid my kids will resent not having<br/>
&gt;school stories to tell.  No prom, no team sports, no<br/>
&gt;horrible teacher tales.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Instead they have encounters with weird<br/>
school-at-homers and condemning and judgemental<br/>
relatives, public school families, and even strangers<br/>
to tell.  They have the chip of being &quot;different&quot; to<br/>
bear on their shoulders if they choose, and tons of<br/>
experiences going to parties, events and activities<br/>
that they would not have been able to do if they had<br/>
been in school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I wish they had had the opportunity to be in school<br/>
&gt;band or orchestra or chorus, which they WOULD have<br/>
&gt;done if it had been a better choice than another<br/>
&gt;write-a-report class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe you mean that you wish they had the IDEAL of<br/>
the band experience, without all the crap stuff that<br/>
comes with it, which is not possible.  Instead they<br/>
have social opportunities to play music with family,<br/>
friends and other social groups, and the freedom to<br/>
study as much or as little as they want.  Remember<br/>
that family whose kids all got accepted to Julliard<br/>
(sp?) at the same time recently for piano?  Fist time<br/>
in the history of the school that siblings have been<br/>
there at the same time, let alone 4 of them.  But they<br/>
were all just THAT good.  They were also all<br/>
homeschooled, to give them oodles of time with their<br/>
music.  The parents decided early on that school was<br/>
interferring with their children&#39;s desire to play<br/>
piano.  So they cut out the school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think of friends I still have from school, and<br/>
&gt;realize I would never have met them if I&#39;d been<br/>
&gt;homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think of friends whom we never would have met if we<br/>
had not been homeschooling.  These friends enrich our<br/>
lives, and include adults as well as kids.  I don&#39;t<br/>
have any friends from my years in school, despite<br/>
attempting to maintain relationships with several.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I imagine that Marty and Kirby will blame me forever<br/>
&gt;for their handwriting being scrawly printing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the handwriting is the fault of the &quot;teacher&quot; or<br/>
the learning opportunity, or amount of practice, or<br/>
the amount of &quot;formal&quot; education, than what is the<br/>
excuse of all the professionals whose indeciperable<br/>
heiroglyphics have to be decoded by administrative<br/>
assistants, and technical editors around the world? <br/>
There are many of them who cannot even put together a<br/>
decent paragraph, or spell reliably, and who find<br/>
punctuation hopelessly baffling, despite multiple<br/>
college degrees.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I wonder if Marty won&#39;t do well if he&#39;s on Jeopardy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My sister in law is a lawyer.  She lost on Jeopardy,<br/>
regardless.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Once in a while I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll get in trouble with<br/>
&gt;the state, but then I remember that all they&#39;ll do is<br/>
&gt;notify me that I&#39;m not in compliance, and then I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;just comply.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ahh the homeschooling apocolyptic vision.  We all<br/>
suffer from that sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I worry that I&#39;ll die and they&#39;ll have their peaceful<br/>
&gt;unschooling disrupted.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If a child&#39;s mother dies, I doubt the child&#39;s<br/>
continuing education would be the greatest of the<br/>
child&#39;s concerns at the time, nor the event which has<br/>
the greater impact upon their lives.  However, you can<br/>
always write up your wishes for how your children<br/>
should be educated (including books their chosen<br/>
guardians should read.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I worry that they&#39;ll think they&#39;re not as smart as<br/>
&gt;kids who go to school are. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But then I remember that my children know how to think<br/>
for themselves and are not slaves to peer pressure or<br/>
peer concepts.  They also know, because I tell them<br/>
all the time, that school has nothing to do with<br/>
smarts.  You are either born smart, or you aren&#39;t. <br/>
School is only a place to access information and learn<br/>
to use it (ideally) and access to good and timely<br/>
information may affect how large your knowledge base<br/>
is, it may decrease ignorance.  But how smart or<br/>
intelligent you are is something that is a part of you<br/>
that no school or teacher can take credit for.</div>

Thanks for your entire post.  It is a healthly prespective.<br/>
<br/>
  I know my children have had many experiences, they will cherish the <br/>
rest of their lives, that they would have missed out on if they had <br/>
to be at school 9-3 everyday.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest has gone to a homecoming dance.  She still has friends that <br/>
attend school, she can go to activities with them if it is important <br/>
to her.<br/>

with this. A child&#39;s life is how they live it. They live in the <br/>
immediate present and having to go to school due to the death of a <br/>
parent would be a very significant event. It could definitely add to the <br/>
grief.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing many of us can do about preventing it however.<br/>

I&#39;m with Dar, I just have to keep living for a while at least.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my friend Bonnie died, her four kids had never been to school.  Her<br/>
husband&#39;s major priority was keeping them out of school.  He took a year or<br/>
so and lived on next to nothing while he concentrated on the kids.  Here in<br/>
Canada, widows and widowers with kids get a pension until the kids are<br/>
grown.  Low income parents also get what they call a child tax benefit.<br/>
Between the two, they were able to survive.  Now he works for my husband,<br/>
and the 17 year old looks after the boys while he works.  One of the biggest<br/>
things Dennis had to deal with was the kids&#39; fear that he could die as well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for sharing this Tia. Manys the times I&#39;ve wondered and worried <br/>
about Bonnie&#39;s children. I was orphaned myself and can be very painful. <br/>
I&#39;m so glad that they were able to work it out so that the boys aren&#39;t <br/>
in school.<br/>
<br/>
We get a bit of social security here but it is dependent upon the income <br/>
of the parent at time of death. Still better than welfare since they <br/>
make that dependent upon a lot of other things now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious about poverty in Canada. Do you think it is more or less <br/>
invisible than poverty in the States?<br/>
