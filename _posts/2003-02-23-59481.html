<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<time>23 Feb 2003, at  4:23pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643018627">I just had a thought the other day.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how much of the conflict between parents and children really has to do with how a child&#39;s behavior is assumed to be a reflection on his/her parents and their parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I am guessing 90% of the &quot;rules&quot; that abound in most homes comes directly from parents worrying about their own image.<br/>

Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>
