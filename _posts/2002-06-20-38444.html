No, but there should be a difference between the responsibilities of adults <br/>
and stay-at-home moms, and the responsibilities of full-time-employed other <br/>
adults, and kids, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
My husband doesn&#39;t dress up a lot to go to work, but if I notice the laundry <br/>
pile in our bedroom getting up there, I will at least grab some of the shirts <br/>
and underwear so he can wear his most comfortable favorites.   <br/>
<br/>
It seems that the more I do for my family, the more they&#39;re willing to do for <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just don&#39;t want my son or daughter to grow up thinking that doing laundry <br/>
is woman&#39;s work, or that mowing the lawn is mans work. That is why I don&#39;t <br/>
separate everyone&#39;s laundry, no one does *just their* laundry. Someone will <br/>
put a load of whites in, someone else will separate the clothes in the dryer <br/>
into everyone&#39;s respected baskets. I do the laundry and cook and clean and I <br/>
do it joyfully. I want to do these things. My kids and husband see this and <br/>
they want to help out as well. I suppose if I grumbled and gritched as I did <br/>
these things and made my kids do their laundry, then everyone would think it <br/>
was a pain in the butt to do household chores. As it stands now Moly enjoys <br/>
picking out a recipe, writing down a list of groceries, shopping, paying, <br/>
putting the things away and cooking it all up. Jack loves to do the dryer. He <br/>
loves the warm clothes, they way they smell, how soft they are as he puts <br/>
them into the basket they belong in, and he absolutely loves cleaning out the <br/>
lint trap! (I don&#39;t know why, but he does) Moly gets a kick out of vacuuming. <br/>
I don&#39;t think I am taking advantage of my kids time, if they wanted to do <br/>
something else I wouldn&#39;t care. Besides we have all found that it takes much <br/>
less of our time if we all pitch in for a few minutes a day, doing a little <br/>
bit at a time than the time it takes if we let things pile up and have to <br/>
tackle the mess all at once.<br/>

&gt; five loads of laundry!&quot; then it would be malice and<br/>
&gt; entrapment on my part.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right.  Obviously, as you said later in this email (which I<br/>
snipped), it can happen (that socks don&#39;t get washed).  What<br/>
I am taking issue with is the idea that if children are<br/>
allowed to experience &quot;natural&quot; consequences, they will<br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
I believe it is my role as a parent, to help my children not<br/>
experience negative consequences if I can help it.  Sure,<br/>
you can&#39;t prevent them all but I would not stand by and<br/>
watch that bad thing happen for the sake of a lesson.  Of<br/>
course, running out of socks is not the end of the world,<br/>
LOL.  But I am making a point about what some people call<br/>
natural consequences being used as a learning tool.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another example.  You stay up late, you will miss the<br/>
bus and be late for school.  (An example that won&#39;t step on<br/>
any toes in this group perhaps!)  It sounds logical enough<br/>
but it just isn&#39;t true that if you stay up late you will<br/>
necessarily be late for school.  Maybe you set out clothes<br/>
and stuff the night before so it takes less time in the<br/>
morning.  Maybe you hand the kid a sandwich on their way out<br/>
the door instead of the usual sit down breakfast.  Maybe you<br/>
give the kid a ride to school so the missed bus isn&#39;t an<br/>
issue, skip school that day (hee hee) etc. etc. etc.  Many<br/>
ways to solve the problem so that the supposed natural<br/>
consequence doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
I see no reason to withhold privileges from them in addition<br/>
to being the washerwoman.<br/>
<br/>
No argument from me here :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187558121">Since I am not a stay at home mom  does that make it<br/>
all right for my house to have different rules.  I<br/>
clean houses and do laundry for other people and get<br/>
paid $100 each day I work, but I see what horrible<br/>
things CAN happen when children and adults are not<br/>
held at all responsible for their things (including<br/>
space).  I once cleaned a house in which an 11 year<br/>
old boy had taken a package of oreo cookies licked the<br/>
insides and stuck the black parts all over his room <br/>
which ended up making permanent marks on the walls.  <br/>
I had to spend an extra 2 hours on his room  which<br/>
made the rest of the house suffer because I couldn&#39;t<br/>
do a good job on the rest of the house when I had to<br/>
spend so much time on one room. I think children<br/>
should learn to respect things   my children don&#39;t<br/>
have to clean their rooms I do that  but they have to<br/>
pick up all the things that can fit in the vacuum<br/>
before I vacuum  and once a week I dust in their<br/>
bedrooms and every 4-6 months I clean everything from<br/>
top to bottom.  But all the small toys that aren&#39;t<br/>
picked up I take away for a time.   When they get the<br/>
toys back it is as good as getting new toys.  I do<br/>
give them fair warning about the toys on the floor<br/>
which means I tell my 7 year old that he needs to put<br/>
his pokemon cards in their box  and the action figures<br/>
in their box and all the art supplies need to go in<br/>
the desk.  I don&#39;t tell him  just to do it and then<br/>
come back in a few minutes expecting it done.   <br/>
How does a child learn to respect things if they are<br/>
not held responsible in some manner for them.   My<br/>
children have to pick up popped waterballoons and<br/>
trash they create from out of the yard  out of respect<br/>
for birds that might try to eat it, etc.<br/>

never quite understood the &quot;need&quot; part of that. I understand the sentence<br/>

wants) it.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How does a child learn to respect things if they are<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure if *things* should be respected, actually. But I do think<br/>
they should be well-treated, in general, to avoid having them damaged or<br/>
destroyed. Rain has learned this by mostly through watching how I treat<br/>
things, and by having things of her own that she enjoys having, and<br/>
caring for. She&#39;s as responsible as she wants to be, and she generally<br/>
takes the responsibility as she&#39;s ready for it. Right now, at 9, she does<br/>
an occasionally load of laundry but generally I do it. I&#39;m responsible<br/>
for laundry.  OTOH, she does almost all of the upkeep on her room - it&#39;s<br/>
a tiny room, admittedly, maybe 8x9, but she didn&#39;t have her own room for<br/>
years and she really enjoys having this one, and fixing it up. <br/>
<br/>
That, to me, is how unschooling works - kids do things as they&#39;re ready.<br/>
IMO, if you create power struggles and try to make them do things sooner,<br/>
you shoot yourself in the foot and it often takes years longer, or maybe<br/>
they never really master doing it on their own because whenever they do<br/>
they feel like they&#39;re &quot;losing&quot; the struggle by doing what you coerced<br/>
them into doing. <br/>
<br/>
Just for the record, we&#39;re not especially neat, actually we&#39;re somewhere<br/>
between lived-in and downright messy, most days... but it works for us,.<br/>

&lt;&lt; How does a child learn to respect things if they are<br/>
not held responsible in some manner for them.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people learn not to respect things from their parents&#39; example. <br/>
<br/>
I was just telling Holly this morning that yes, her room has too much stuff.  <br/>
And I would be willing to help her go through and decide what to give away or <br/>
pack away, but I would NOT do what was done to me, which is sometimes things <br/>
just disappeared forever.  A favorite orange skirt; just gone.  Probably <br/>
because it had to be drycleaned and my mom just got drunk and threw it in the <br/>
trash can (which we burned daily).  I&#39;m guessing.  It was just one of the <br/>
gone things.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents throw parts of games and puzzles away.  That creates TOTAL trash <br/>
out of the parts still there, and doesn&#39;t encourage kids to take care of <br/>
things as much as it would if they saved the found pieces and had retrieve <br/>
and refile sessions to get them where they go.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby still has ever issue of Nintendo Power he has ever received, in <br/>
labelled fileboxes.  I didn&#39;t tell him to do that.  But I did provide boxes <br/>
for him, and shelving.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby still has every Ninja Turtle action figure he ever had and all the <br/>
parts.  He has the parts because I helped him keep them.  (He might be <br/>
missing April O&#39;Neil&#39;s original gun.  But I&#39;m guessing it will show up in a <br/>
junk-drawer or can around here somewhere someday.)<br/>
<br/>
Sticking oreos on the wall isn&#39;t the consequence of not making kids do their <br/>
own laundry, I&#39;m pretty sure.<br/>
<br/>
-=- My<br/>
children have to pick up popped waterballoons and<br/>
trash they create from out of the yard  out of respect<br/>
for birds that might try to eat it, etc.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Mine pick up their own trash anywhere, and a fair amount of other people&#39;s.  <br/>
I don&#39;t make them, they&#39;ve just always seen me and their dad and our friends <br/>
do it without fanfare.  I used to take trashbags and gardening tools to the <br/>
park with us and I would pull the goatheads (a weed here that ends up being <br/>
hundreds of caltrop-style stickers when the frost comes, if they&#39;re not <br/>
pulled earlier).  The kids often came and helped me, just because they wanted <br/>
to.  If I had forced them to, they couldn&#39;t possibly have done it because <br/>
they wanted to.  Nobody was forcing me to, I just knew that every one I <br/>
pulled would prevent dozens more the next year.<br/>
<br/>
I could make my kids do things that would make my life easier today, but it <br/>
could be at the expense of making all our lives truly better in five or ten <br/>
years.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Considering that people used to wear their clothes for a week or so at a <br/>
time, I really don&#39;t think two days with the same pair of socks is going to <br/>
get him fired.  If they&#39;re really high, he could sprinkle some baking soda <br/>
into his shoes to absorb the smell. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m more concerned about health issues and comfort than the smell.  And socks <br/>
worn without washing wear out, too, so there&#39;s an expense and <br/>
replacement-bother to consider.<br/>
<br/>
When people wore their clothes for a week or so, at least in the experience <br/>
of my grandmothers (so not into the 19th century, but to the beginning of <br/>
20th), they still washed underwear and small items (handkerchiefs, if they <br/>
didn&#39;t have lots) between laundry days, in a bucket or a washbasin.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just my La Leche League propaganda kicked in, but I still see <br/>
myself as my child&#39;s partner, rather than adversary or &quot;trainer.&quot;   I&#39;ve seen <br/>
divorces materialize out of little things like no clean laundry, and I treat <br/>
my relationships with my children carefully as I do mine with my husband.  <br/>
I&#39;ve seen kids not want to have anything to do with their parents years later <br/>
(if it doesn&#39;t start when they&#39;re 14) and I&#39;m not interested in going that <br/>
route either, just to teach them &quot;habits.&quot;  If they missed being invested in <br/>
their own sock supply as teens, they can catch up on that responsibility <br/>
lesson in just the first month they&#39;re on their own.<br/>
<br/>
But in truth my kids are NOT irresponsible.  I&#39;m backup.  And their <br/>
responsibility isn&#39;t coming from failures when I stood back, but from their <br/>
wanting to contribute to the partnership out of a cooperative nature and <br/>
positive regard.   Kirby keeps an alarm set; I double check, and he&#39;s up and <br/>
in the shower 95% of the time now (up from 80% a year ago; he&#39;s older and <br/>
more experienced).<br/>
<br/>
At night I ask who needs to get up at a certain time, and that&#39;s their <br/>
alarm-setting reminder AND my backup reminder.<br/>
<br/>
With laundry, it&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m doing laundry,&quot; and the three of them deliver their <br/>
dirty clothes, if they&#39;re not already there before I mention it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad we have a washer and dryer in the house.  I have dealt with <br/>
laundramats and apartment laundries, and that is a stress all on its own.  So <br/>
I admit my situation is easier because if things are missed we can do them <br/>
later the same day.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m more concerned about health issues and comfort than the smell.  And socks<br/>
&gt;worn without washing wear out, too, so there&#39;s an expense and<br/>
&gt;replacement-bother to consider.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re talking constant here.  If it was a constant problem, <br/>
I&#39;m sure we&#39;d find some other way to deal with it.  I think Lars has <br/>
forgotten maybe a handful of times since he took over doing his own laundry <br/>
7 years ago.  If I forget, I wear socks and underwear two days in a row <br/>
*once*, and it doesn&#39;t kill me.  But then I&#39;m really good at remembering <br/>
for a long time after that.  (and my memory is *not* one of my strong <br/>
points)  When he forgets, he gets better at remembering, and one day with <br/>
somewhat dirty socks doesn&#39;t seem to kill him either.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe it&#39;s just my La Leche League propaganda kicked in, but I still see<br/>
&gt;myself as my child&#39;s partner, rather than adversary or &quot;trainer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So do I.  And just like my dh and I each have certain things we take <br/>
responsibility for, so does our son.  Dh and I sometimes negotiate <br/>
different responsibilities, and I&#39;m happy to pitch in with his when he&#39;s <br/>
swamped.  He does the same for me.  And we do the same for our son.  I <br/>
guess if Lars acted like it bothered him to do his laundry, I&#39;d look at a <br/>
different plan.  He took it in stride years ago.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt;divorces materialize out of little things like no clean laundry, and I treat<br/>
&gt;my relationships with my children carefully as I do mine with my husband.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If my husband divorced me *because* there wasn&#39;t any clean laundry, I&#39;d say <br/>
there were a lot more things wrong with the relationship than <br/>
laundry.  None of this is done in an adverserial way with either son or dh.<br/>
