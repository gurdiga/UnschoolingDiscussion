<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573698189">We are new to homeschooling (12 weeks) and I&#39;m really enjoying all the <br/>
postings I&#39;ve read that assure me I&#39;m not the only one who thinks like I do. <br/>
My son is nine (the youngest of 4) and the only one who homeschools in our <br/>
family. I can&#39;t believe how much he&#39;s learned since he&#39;s left the public <br/>
school system and stopped taking Ritilan. Our day is pretty much dictated by <br/>
what he wants to do and he always wants to learn something or do something. <br/>
It&#39;s amazing how much your kids will learn when it&#39;s not being crammed down <br/>
their throats. We live in California where the laws are pretty relaxed about <br/>
homeschooling, so I&#39;m not tied down to any specific cirriculum or test <br/>
requirements. Oh the freedom!! <br/>
One of the coolest things about our new situation is that my Andrew teaches <br/>
me something new every day!  I can&#39;t say enough good about homeschooling--for <br/>
us, anyway. My 15-year-old could never homeschool. She&#39;s an honor roll <br/>
student, cheerleader, student body treasurer and all around social butterfly. <br/>
Thank God for differences.<br/>
My  husband was not convinced that this is the best thing for our son until <br/>
our middle daughter called my son from work last week to get technical suport <br/>
for their computer because a whole office full of adults couldn&#39;t figure out <br/>
how to restore the icons on the desktop!<br/>
Have a great day from sunny California!     Nancy</div>
