Unschooling or Homeschooling?<br/>
by Billy Greer<br/>
<br/>
What is the difference between unschooling and homeschooling? At one time<br/>
they were just two terms for the same thing, so the question was like asking<br/>
what the difference is between a car and an automobile. Today, homeschooling<br/>
has remained a generic term while unschooling has come to refer to a<br/>
specific type of homeschooling. So now the question is like asking what the<br/>
difference is between a Ferrari and a car. Just what is it about unschooling<br/>
that differentiates it from other types of homeschooling enough to warrant<br/>
its own term?<br/>
<br/>
Before we look at that question, let&#39;s look at a history of the words. At<br/>
one time, there was no special term for people who took their children out<br/>
of the public school system to teach them at home. If you look at references<br/>
to education before there even was a public school system, you will see<br/>
phrases such as &quot;tutored at home,&quot; &quot;self-taught,&quot; or &quot;no formal education&quot;<br/>
to refer to people we might now call homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
Even after the modern homeschooling movement got started, there wasn&#39;t a<br/>
standard term for what these parents were doing. People simply referred to<br/>
teaching their children at home, or not sending them to school. In issue<br/>
#108 of Growing Without Schooling, Susannah Sheffer tells us that the first<br/>
issue of GWS (published in 1977), did not even make use of the term<br/>
homeschooling. In issue #2, John Holt used the term unschooling, but it was<br/>
used as a general term for what we now call homeschooling. In issue #118 of<br/>
GWS, Aaron Falbel tells us that Holt wrote in issue #2 of GWS (Nov. 1977)<br/>
that they [GWS] would use unschooling &quot;when we mean taking kids out of<br/>
school.&quot; Falbel goes on to say that it wasn&#39;t until the early 1980&#39;s that<br/>
the term homeschooling became more popular.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know when it happened or who first used the phrase, but it is pretty<br/>
easy to see that if most kids went to public school, then people might say<br/>
kids who were taught at home went to &quot;home school.&quot; As the term has become<br/>
more an accepted part of our vocabulary, it has moved from the novelty<br/>
phrase &quot;home schooling&quot; (in quotes) to home schooling (no quotes), to<br/>
home-schooling (hyphenated), and now homeschooling (one word).<br/>
<br/>
John Holt is considered the father of unschooling and the person who coined<br/>
the term. In Holt&#39;s early writings, he seemed to hold out hope that the<br/>
school system could be fixed, but he later became more convinced that<br/>
parents were better off taking their kids out of schools. I imagine that it<br/>
then seemed natural to him to refer to the process of not sending your kids<br/>
to school as unschooling, as in not schooling.<br/>
<br/>
While the terms may have been interchangeable originally, that is no longer<br/>
the case today. Unschooling has become associated with the particular style<br/>
of homeschooling in which no set curriculum is used. Where the split<br/>
originated is hard to say, but part of the reason for the division is<br/>
probably because of the words themselves. Homeschooling carries an<br/>
implication of schooling-at-home, while unschooling connotes that what you<br/>
are doing is the opposite of school. People who accepted the teaching<br/>
techniques of school but wanted more control over the subject matter,<br/>
socialization, or morals that their children were exposed to might readily<br/>
accept the term homeschooling. People who disliked the teaching techniques<br/>
and environment of school might be more inclined to use the term<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, homeschooling is considered to span a spectrum from those who<br/>
school-at-home to those who unschool. The school-at home designation is<br/>
self-explanatory. This group revels in all the trappings of school! They may<br/>
have the same desks used in the public schools, some of the same text books,<br/>
and they may even start each day by ringing a bell and saying the pledge of<br/>
allegiance. The parent assumes the role of teacher, preparing lesson plans,<br/>
assigning homework or tests, and grading papers. Their &quot;holy grail&quot; is the<br/>
search for the perfect curriculum, the one that will cover everything their<br/>
children need to learn.<br/>
<br/>
What is it that unschoolers do? Where do you find a curriculum package that<br/>
will help you to be an unschooler? The reason that unschooling is hard to<br/>
explain and hard for some people to understand, is that it is not a<br/>
technique that can be broken down to a step by step process. Rather,<br/>
unschooling is an attitude, a way of life. Where most homeschooling puts the<br/>
emphasis on what needs to be learned, unschooling puts the emphasis on who<br/>
is doing the learning. This makes it a very personalized experience and one<br/>
that does not lend itself well to the one size-fits-all approach of a<br/>
commercial curriculum package.<br/>
<br/>
What are some of the unintended lessons of a &quot;school&quot; approach to learning?<br/>
First of all, the student is taught that learning is something that takes<br/>
place in a certain location at certain times. From 8 to 3 you do lessons at<br/>
your desk. Learning is also unpleasant and often boring, so it is usually a<br/>
relief when &quot;school&quot; is finally out. Students become used to the idea that<br/>
learning requires a teacher - someone more knowledgeable than them. This<br/>
follows the old model of learning in which students are empty cups waiting<br/>
to be filled and the teacher is the pitcher full of knowledge that will fill<br/>
them. This also emphasizes the idea that students must be taught - in other<br/>
words, what happens to you (learning) is the result of what someone else<br/>
does to you (teaching). School also reinforces the idea that learning is a<br/>
linear process. You work and add knowledge incrementally over time in a<br/>
steady process. To get from point A to point C, you must first pass point B.<br/>
<br/>
In unschooling, learning can happen anywhere and at anytime. It is an<br/>
ongoing, natural process - part of the journey we call life. It is not<br/>
unpleasant or boring anymore than breathing, eating or sleeping are. There<br/>
is no sense of relief that school is out because learning is always<br/>
happening. Students also know that they are responsible for their learning.<br/>
They do not need an &quot;expert&quot; to teach them. If they have an interest, they<br/>
can go out and pursue the knowledge they need. This is another fundamental<br/>
difference between a schoolish approach and an unschooling model. School is<br/>
a case of knowledge (that someone else has determined to be important) in<br/>
pursuit of the student, while unschooling puts the student in pursuit of the<br/>
knowledge (which they have decided is important). In this role, parents are<br/>
not teachers who always know more than their children, they are often fellow<br/>
learners making the journey along with their children. (See the side bar for<br/>
more comments about the non-linear learning of unschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
It is unfortunate that the older term &quot;unschooled&quot; often means uneducated.<br/>
As unschooling gains acceptance and its effectiveness is recognized, the<br/>
dictionaries will have to be corrected to reflect the positive aspects of<br/>
someone who has been educated by unschooling.<br/>

&gt;Nanci... I&#39;m not sure if I have the title correct, but one of the best <br/>
&gt;books<br/>
&gt;I read is the Unschooling Handbook.  I think the author is Mary--- <br/>
&gt;something!<br/>
&gt;  A lot of help I am! LOL! Any way, the book was filled with stories of<br/>
&gt;families and how they unschool.  It was excellent.  I&#39;m sure someone will<br/>
&gt;know more about the name-- is it &quot;Pride&quot;?  Sorry that I can&#39;t remember at <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;moment... :)  ~Karen<br/>
