School is school is school in my book.<br/>
I unwittingly labeled some of our sit down, bookwork time &quot;school time&quot;. This <br/>
was before I had totally come to unschooling though. My dd occasionally says <br/>
&quot;I want to do school Mommy&quot; meaning she wants me to do some workbooky type <br/>
stuff with her.<br/>
I now point out that we aren&#39;t doing school, just playing with her workbook <br/>
for a while.<br/>
But calling a certain time of day &quot;school&quot; and having the child do certain <br/>
activities is not very unschoolish in my mind.<br/>

&gt; bit of a curriculum and sometimes I get ideas about parenting from some bit<br/>
&gt; in a parenting book. I&#39;ve sat at conferences and read through the KONOS<br/>
&gt; books, the Calvert stuff, the Oak Meadow materials, and others. So - looking<br/>
&gt; at them is interesting to me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have piles of curriculum at home - all 4 grandparents are educators of<br/>
some sort.  They send all kinds of stuff.  (I keep it in the basement to<br/>
read while the laundry runs or something.)  I think the thing that facinates<br/>
me about curriculum is how much of what is in it we actually do, just not<br/>
the way it is prescribed.<br/>
<br/>
My mom likes to send these unit studies.  Read about the farm, visit the<br/>
farm, make a diarama, answer these questions, color pictures, write a story<br/>
about them, etc. all laid out neatly for you.  When my son was into farms,<br/>
we DID read about them and visit them, and find answers to our questions.<br/>
The lego people farmed for weeks (closest thing to a diarama likely to<br/>
happen here!).  My son drew pictures of farms (during church, but hey!).<br/>
But I never sat him down to do those things, he just did them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s an oversimplification, but sometimes I think unschooling is not<br/>
all that different from school-y stuff, just in its pace and timing.  Any<br/>
thoughts?  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, the huge difference is that the interest is child owned. How the parent<br/>
then facilitates the child exploring that interest will be different for<br/>
each child and each parent. It may at times resemble something kids would do<br/>
in school. Most times it won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, as a beginning point, look at it as how you&#39;d like your husband to<br/>
help you explore an interest.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d probably appreciate it if he happened to notice a book or video or<br/>
article or event that might interest you and point them out to you or buy<br/>
them for you. You wouldn&#39;t want him to take over the interest and feel your<br/>
learning was his responsibility and how much you learned depended entirely<br/>
on how well he performed for you. You wouldn&#39;t want him to overwhelm you<br/>
with an itinerary of things to do. You wouldn&#39;t want him hovering over you<br/>
to see how much and how well you were learning. I think you&#39;d appreciate<br/>
being left alone to explore at your own pace, to delve as deeply or<br/>
shallowly as whimsy strikes you. Any help he gave you would be a gift with<br/>
no strings attached.<br/>
<br/>
Of course kids are different. Younger kids generally aren&#39;t scanning the<br/>
list of week&#39;s activities in the newspaper and may not even care to look up<br/>
books at the library. (The process of finding the information and sorting<br/>
out the useful from the not useful can be overwhelming.) So we need to be<br/>
more active, but still recognize that the child owns the interest and should<br/>
have the freedom to explore as deeply or shallowly as he or she wishes.  We<br/>
just make sure the resources are available. (And if we get frustrated with<br/>
them not digging deep enough, then *we* should dig deeper for *ourselves*<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
And that doesn&#39;t rule out something that resembles a unit study. Some kids<br/>
like to live and breathe something for a while. (Where our husbands would<br/>
assume we&#39;d be able to set up our own &quot;unit study&quot; to pursue our own<br/>
interests, our kids would proabably appreciate some help.) It doesn&#39;t rule<br/>
out mom coming up with some nifty &quot;learning activities&quot;. But we shouldn&#39;t<br/>
feel their learning depends on it. Their learning depends entirely on them<br/>
and the quality of the environment they have to explore in. (And the<br/>
environment includes parents who are actively learning and interested in<br/>
life -- and interested in their kids too. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t not do some parent-directed activity that my daughter would enjoy<br/>
but I&#39;d be aware of how she&#39;s learning about learning. If she&#39;s getting the<br/>
idea that in order to learn, she needs mom to put on a performance for her,<br/>
then I&#39;d make sure she had more access to child-directed resources too.<br/>
<br/>
Of course another part of unschooling is strewing their paths. We don&#39;t need<br/>
our husbands to run the world past us to help us discover new interests<br/>
because we&#39;re pretty capable of exploring the world on our own. But we do<br/>
need to filter and direct some of the world into our kids&#39; lives so they<br/>
have access to new interests.<br/>

people.  I also know lots of unschoolers whose lives don&#39;t look at all <br/>
lke that.  <br/>
<br/>
Here with my three, Wyndham&#39;s learning probably looks a lot like unit <br/>
studies.  The girl&#39;s learning looks like osmosis!  They just know <br/>
stuff.  I don&#39;t see them learning it or finding it but they pop up <br/>
with interesting bits of knowledge all the time.  What it looks like <br/>
they do, day to day, is hang out, read books and mags, play on the <br/>
computer, poke around the gardens (which are looking great this year <br/>
thanks to Rachel) ride bikes, hike, watch TV and movies, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It was an issue with my mom when we first started homeschooling <br/>
actually.   She could not imagine at that point that they could learn <br/>
anything in the chaos that was our lives then.  She has since seen the <br/>
light, so to speak.  Now her concern with Wyndham is not in teaching <br/>
him things but in offering the stability and structure that he needs <br/>
right now and that I can&#39;t offer (not because I don&#39;t want to, but <br/>
because it just is so out of my nature we would come to a point of my <br/>
mental health or his and that isn&#39;t a choice I want to have to make!)<br/>

I didn&#39;t think you knew lots of unschoolers.  Where do you live again?<br/>
<br/>
I know sometimes a day or two will look a little like unit studies, maybe, or <br/>
someone might develop an obsession (Holly for the 1930&#39;s, for many months <br/>
now) but that becomes a full-on hobby or personal interest, not a temporary <br/>
unit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-582294685">Yes, there are a lot of new people here who don&#39;tknow my son yet.  For <br/>
those of you who think you&#39;ve heard it all already feel free to delete <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
Wyndham is a child with many problems.  He has lots of <br/>
allergies/sensitivities.  He hasn&#39;t been diagnosed by a pro yet, but <br/>
we suspect Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  The therapist he is seeing <br/>
today (who has seen me alone once) thinks he may have Anxiety Disorder <br/>
too.  We are also going to try to rule out Tourette.  There are enough <br/>
symtomps to make us take a closer look.<br/>
<br/>
A year and a half ago, Wyndham was a mess.  Always unhappy, always <br/>
frustrated because he couldn&#39;t do the thing he wanted to be able to <br/>
do and couldn&#39;t learn how.  I was not able to help him with some of <br/>
the things he wanted either.  The things I did with the girls that <br/>
worked so well for them, seemed to make him worse.  Things like <br/>
letting them be.  Letting them choose their own everything from food <br/>
(except corn in Rachel&#39;s case) to books to sleep times.<br/>
<br/>
Then my mom moved into the other house on our property.  She started <br/>
coming over in the morning and getting him.  She would make him <br/>
breakfast, and then &#39;teach&#39; him the things he wanted to learn.  In the <br/>
beginning, he was just going for the food.  But within six months he <br/>
had structured his entire day around his time with her and his <br/>
favorite TV shows.  That&#39;s when I realized that what he had needed all <br/>
along was the one thing I am simply not capable of giving - structure.<br/>
<br/>
What she does over there with him now during his so called &#39;school <br/>
time&#39; varies.  She has textbooks and workbooks and such but they skip <br/>
over the parts he isn&#39;t really interested in and focus more an the <br/>
stuff he is.  He went from not being able to read anything at 9, to <br/>
being an above his age-level reader at 10.  Part of that had to do <br/>
with being more ready, but part of being more ready had to do with <br/>
finding his structure.  That plays into the Anxiety Disorder suspicion <br/>
that the therapist has a lot I think.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, they go for walks, they do experiments, they read his train <br/>
books (although as I said before, she threw that one back to dh and I <br/>
- can&#39;t blame her, I&#39;m sick of trains too!)<br/>
<br/>
The reason I still consider him an unschooler is because I think he is <br/>
still doing exactly what he wants to be doing and I KNOW he is loads <br/>
happier now.  <br/>
