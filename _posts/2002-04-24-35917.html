 </span></blockquote>I cringed when I read this.  My son was potty-trained (by HIS choice) before <br/>
he was three.  (He&#39;s three now.)  My daughter, who is two, is not <br/>
potty-trained, and I am not forcing her to be so.  Nor, in fact, am I <br/>
encouraging her to be so.<br/>
<br/>
I DO, however, allow her to see how &quot;cool&quot; underwear is when Julian (my son) <br/>
is getting dressed.  And he gets the &quot;special privilege&quot; of getting out of <br/>
bed at night to go to the potty if he needs to.  And, I read to him when he <br/>
is on the potty (which is just another &quot;perk&quot; that makes my daughter more <br/>
curious (envious?) about the whole potty thing).  She seems to be interested <br/>
. . . and often asks to sit on the potty seat if for nothing else then to <br/>
enjoy the &quot;thrill&quot; of flushing.  (Go figure . . . maybe I thought it was neat <br/>
to flush the toilet at that age, too.)<br/>
<br/>
My nephew was not potty-trained until he was almost six.  I just couldn&#39;t <br/>
understand how my sister-in-law could change his diaper!  At some point, I <br/>
think I would just have had to say:  &quot;Go change it yourself.  And when you&#39;re <br/>
done, clean up your room.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I am sure that your child will learn, eventually, how and <br/>
when it is necessary to use the toilet.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

almost 6, and I&#39;ve never heard it described like this from <br/>

<br/>
My kids learned to use potties because they wanted to.  They were two and <br/>
three, not five.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a five year old in diapers?  If so, maybe it&#39;s just a <br/>
developmental difference.  Our friend Liam didn&#39;t learn to talk until he was <br/>
three.  He&#39;s fine now, at 17.<br/>
<br/>
If you did NOT have a five year old in diapers, was it just a <br/>
vaguely-insulting example?  I purposeful exaggeration?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t have any in diapers myself, but I&#39;m trying to<br/>
<br/>
understand how far some thinking  goes around here.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It goes this far, for me:  I look at my child as the person he is.  I look <br/>
right into his eyes and I feel him and I smell his head and I remember all <br/>
the things he has learned in peace and joy because he wanted to, and I have <br/>
no doubt that he can learn other, harder things.   Just using Kirby for an <br/>
example:  He learned, in my presence and with my encouragement (but NOT by my <br/>
&quot;Teaching&quot;) to sit, talk, walk, run, climb, sing, read, write, to play all <br/>
kinds of computer and video games, to play complex other card games (Magic, <br/>
Pokemon, L5R, Warlord), since at this point he DOES spell, why would I stop <br/>
his life to teach him to spell?  And if I had &quot;taught him to spell&quot; earlier, <br/>
he wouldn&#39;t have believed he could have learned it on his own. If I had <br/>
&quot;taught him to walk&quot; *I* might think I had taught him to walk.  If I had <br/>
taught him to read, he might think he had to come back later to find out how <br/>
to write a business letter.  But he knows he can learn things by observation, <br/>
experimentation, inquiry, searching out samples, etc.<br/>

Thank you Sandra for this very eloquent description of what unschooling is to &quot;me&quot;. I try to explain it this way when I get into a discussion with my friends who also homeschool but do not unschool. It is difficult because they think I am weird and wacky for trusting that my kids WILL learn what they need to. And not that I need to cram it down their throats. I am still growing and learning how not to school them. It is a process and I am getting somewhere in that process. I feel so passionately that this is the right way for us. that it is usually hard to express to others. I have found that this list is one of the only lists that understands and feels that passion too.<br/>
