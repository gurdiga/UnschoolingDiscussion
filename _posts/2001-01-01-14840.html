<br>Samantha, can i ask how you can be sure an animal is giving its life <br>voluntarily? &nbsp;I know in aboriginal cultures there are understandings with the <br>earth about giving and receiving between humankind and animal life (as well <br>as the earth and plants), but aren&#39;t we far removed from this beautiful <br>concept? &nbsp;I trust you are not referring to grocery store bought meats? <br>Factory farming most certainly removes any relationship of trust between <br>humans and animals.
<br>
<br>peace back to you,

Does that answer you question? Or are you responding<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-797475500">The American Indian beliefs have to do with the respect one shows as a<br/>
recipient of the food.  That includes a state of mind in acknowledging that<br/>
the animal/plant gave its life to feed you.  It includes not taking in<br/>
greed/gluteny.  You only take what you need and respect the giver and their<br/>
gift.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for the vegetarians, by not eating meat does not excuse them from the<br/>
&quot;death&quot; cycle.  The American Indian believes that all things are living<br/>
beings and have a right to that same respect and lack of greed/gluteny.<br/>
<br/>
One does not have to do the actual killing of animal/plant to offer them/it<br/>
respect/prayer/apology for taking their life.<br/>
