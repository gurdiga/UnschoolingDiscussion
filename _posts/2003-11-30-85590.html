 </span></blockquote>       Dunno if this will help, but my little guy wanted to play the violin <br/>
at age four. So I bought one and signed him up for Suzuki, in which the mom and <br/>
child supposedly learn together. Well, the first assignment was to build a <br/>
toy violin, from a box covered in brown shopping-bag paper and strings drawn on <br/>
with red magic marker. One end had a paint paddle attached to be the &quot;neck.<br/>
<br/>
       No sound to worry about sounding bad at least! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       The idea was that little children really need to be able to make <br/>
mistakes, to be rough, to fumble and drop it, whatever. The first task is to <br/>
ingrain the standing still, the standing straight, the tucking under the chin at the <br/>
right spot, the lifting and lowering and repositioning, et cetera, ad <br/>
nauseum. Not making actual sound.<br/>
<br/>
       I don&#39;t mean to misrepresent the method or diss violin playing -- it <br/>
did not work for us, obviously, probably for were many reasons other than this <br/>
and that wouldn&#39;t apply to your situation anyway. My only real point is that <br/>
when this method DOES work, it all starts by building and handling your own toy <br/>
violin and then not playing at all. If you can get anything helpful out of <br/>
this, more power to you! &lt;gg&gt;  JJ<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427764895">I would rent one now and let her goof around with it.  It&#39;s not  <br/>
terribly expensive to rent, and some places will let you rent to own.    <br/>
I was just thinking about renting a viola because I want to learn to  <br/>
play one.<br/>
<br/>
I too would shy away from the toy ones, as I don&#39;t think they sound as  <br/>
good as the real thing.<br/>

Why does she have to wait to play violin?<br/>

I took up ukulele last year.  I own two relatively inexpensive uke&#39;s.  <br/>
They&#39;re good for learning.  I do have to face prejudice from some music snobs who <br/>
snort over them being ukulele&#39;s in the first place.  lol.  A 5 yo friend of mine <br/>
even said, &quot;My daddy said your ukulele is a TOY!&quot;  His daddy owns an <br/>
expensive guitar, but never plays it.  <br/>
<br/>
My ukulele is not a toy.  It is a musical instrument.  It&#39;s not expensive and <br/>
not particularly finely made.  But it sounds good to me and I&#39;m learning a <br/>
lot and I didn&#39;t have to spend hundreds and then feel guilty over the expense <br/>
when I don&#39;t play for a week or two.  It didn&#39;t cost too much to find out that I <br/>
really like playing ukulele and I&#39;m good enough at it to have a good time and <br/>
meet my own goals.  Moreover, now that I can actually play ukulele, I know <br/>
exactly what to look for when I want a new one, if I do.  <br/>
<br/>
Eventually I will buy another instrument.  The best advice I&#39;ve heard is to <br/>
visit lots of music stores and try their instruments.  The instrument you keep <br/>
coming back to should be the one you buy.  It helps if you already know a <br/>
little about how to play, I suppose.  Unfortunately, since I don&#39;t live in Hawaii, <br/>
there are never any ukulele&#39;s in the stores that aren&#39;t the cheap China-made <br/>
variety.  And they&#39;ll have one of those IF I&#39;m lucky.  So what am I supposed <br/>
to do?  Just NOT take up ukulele until I could afford/put my hands on only the <br/>
best one?  Time&#39;s a wastin&#39;, I say.  I took advantage of what was available <br/>
and now...I&#39;m a ukulele player.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I say get your daughter a violin in her size, even if you have to rent it.  <br/>
People have instruments lying around in their closets that aren&#39;t being used.  <br/>
Ask around.  I don&#39;t know about violins, but even if it&#39;s a relatively cheap <br/>
one, you can gauge her interest and aptitude and see if it&#39;s something that&#39;s <br/>
going to stick for her.  Time&#39;s a wastin&#39;.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-763250494">Try www.StringWorks.com for a violin.  They also rent with some of the<br/>
rental payments going toward a purchase price.  I just went through this<br/>
with a cello for me, and will soon be purchasing a new (better) violin for<br/>
my daughter.  After you&#39;ve read everything on the site, call and talk to<br/>
them.  They are patient and wonderful to deal with. They answer all of the<br/>
questions, even the ones you might feel silly asking. I went through pawn<br/>
shops, Shar Music (really sent me a piece of garbage!), and four months of<br/>
looking.  They(StringWorks) have a two week trial period (if you decide to<br/>
buy) before they&#39;ll even charge your credit card, just in case you don&#39;t<br/>
like the instrument.  I believe that their violin rental is only around $18<br/>
a month. If you have any questions and want to e-mail me off-line, that&#39;s<br/>
fine. We loved Suzuki, but no one near us teaches by that method.<br/>
Good luck, and enjoy!<br/>

If your daughter is really interested, get her a nice<br/>
used one.  Providing our kids with the very best<br/>
choices for following their interests helps them<br/>
succeed.  Think of it as &quot;curriculum&quot; (wink).<br/>
<br/>
We did just that for my daughter for her artwork, and<br/>
she is a successful young artist now.  You can see<br/>

time to update that to reflect our unschooling...the<br/>

girl&#39;s interest in violin at length in &quot;And the Skylark Sings With Me&quot; - a<br/>
delightful book. I also wonder why she can&#39;t start violin now - even if it<br/>
is &quot;just fooling around&quot; with it, in the spirit of John Holt. Does she enjoy<br/>
piano? Can you only afford one lesson at a time? Which would she prefer of<br/>
the two?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-37826525">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
My 11 year old son has been playing the violin for over a year now.  <br/>
Fortunately for him he is big enough to have a full-sized violin.  <br/>
Also fortunately (even though we are renting right now--he wants a <br/>
cello and guitar and bass guitar), the rental on the violin is $25 <br/>
per month.  You can actually purchase a used violin for around $300 <br/>
and save yourself the rental interest.  <br/>
<br/>
If your daughter really wants a violin, I say by all means get her a <br/>
violin.  Even if you rent one for a month just to see how she really <br/>
reacts to it and interacts with it, it is well worth the money.  You <br/>
can also purchase the Suzuki program which will have her playing that <br/>
violin befor your month is up (check Amazon for Suzuki).  <br/>
<br/>
As far as a toy is concerned, don&#39;t do it.  My other son (their <br/>
twins) wanted a saxophone (alto) since he was at least 3 years old.  <br/>
First thing we did was go and buy that silly toy.  He hated it, <br/>
completely and totally.  He continued to ask for a sax-o-phone until <br/>
he was able to pronounce it properly.  For his 11th birthday we <br/>
rented a Bundy Alto Sax.  He just looked at it for two months and <br/>
insisted we pay for lessons.  We did, but could only afford about <br/>
five weeks worth of lessons right off.  It really paid off, he had an <br/>
excellent teacher and we are six months out--he&#39;s playing in our <br/>
church&#39;s orchestra.  I have decided to re-employ that music teacher, <br/>
in addition to their other lessons (through the orchestra and our <br/>
public Baltimore School for the Arts which is free).  The orchestra <br/>
members have given him many accessories and expensive books and have <br/>
taught him lessons that will last a lifetime as they are mostly men <br/>
over the age of 40ish.  He has played in a wedding and at many other <br/>
churches.  We are soo proud of him we don&#39;t know what to do.  Since <br/>
the age of three he was convicted in his desire to be a saxophonist.  <br/>
The members of his orchestra have invited his twin brother to join <br/>
with his violin.  He will attend his first practice this Thursday.  <br/>
The violinist will be the only strings player in the all brass <br/>
orchestra.  The orchestra plans to make its first CD in February and <br/>
I am overjoyed at their success.<br/>
<br/>
So, if your daughter wants a violin---get it immediately.  Just <br/>
supervise her care and use of the violin until she is able to take <br/>
care of it herself.  You will know once she has that cute little <br/>
violin in her possession whether she really wants to play it <br/>
seriously or just for fun.<br/>
<br/>
BTW:  Playing an instrument helps tremendously with our school work <br/>
(critical thinking skills) and discipline issues.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-259062218">Auctions or yard sales!  We recently attended an estate auction and picked up two 50 year old clarinets for $30 - and a trumpet for $6.  One of the clarinets simply needed a reed and is playable &quot;as is&quot;, the trumpet needs a little work but is playable.  They also had a banjo and guitar.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115719162">A couple of years ago some of us pooled money to get a cello for a friend <br/>
whose cello had been stolen.  We couldn&#39;t afford really good one, so we got one <br/>
he might not mind taking camping (he&#39;s in the SCA and a lot of those events are <br/>
partly or mostly outdoors).<br/>
<br/>
I was the purchaser.  We had $430 or so.  I found a cello on e-Bay for $300 <br/>
and we spent the rest on a stand for it, a humidifier, a tuning fork and some <br/>
music.<br/>
<br/>
The cello was new.  It&#39;s made in China.  They sell them on e-bay.  If a cello <br/>
is $300, the violins must be much less.<br/>
<br/>
China is CRAZY about western music.  Strange, for a communist country, <br/>
whereas in Russia classical music was considered part of the old ways, and the moved <br/>
toward traditional music and theatre (of the people, not of the ruling <br/>
class), China pushes European classical tradition.  (It&#39;s not of their ruling class, <br/>
maybe?  I don&#39;t know.)<br/>
<br/>
So they&#39;re making instruments for their own billion and some people, and some <br/>
of those flow down to us.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there&#39;s a prejudice against Chinese stuff.   But for a small child, <br/>
maybe lack of prejudice-avoidance.<br/>
<br/>
The cello came with a hard case which would cost way over $100 by itself, and <br/>
a soft case (cloth bag) also.<br/>
<br/>
I took it to a cello-playing acquaintance to be set up and tuned.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could arrange for a violinist (even from the local college or high <br/>
school) to tune it when it arrives.  <br/>
<br/>
I broke a string when Holly first got a violin, because I was used to guitar <br/>
strings and I turned it too fast and too far.  It&#39;s a very slight and gentle <br/>
move compared to a guitar.  I would get help at first, before you give it to <br/>
her, so it will be tuned and useable when she gets it.<br/>
<br/>
There are WONDERFUL books with CDs out.  Some will help you tune (play the <br/>
notes for you), and she could play by ear or you could figure out the system of <br/>
notation (there&#39;s more than one) and help her out with the book while she <br/>
listens to the CDs.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe once in a while you could bring in someone who plays to play with her.  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be called &quot;lessons.&quot;  Ask them to come and do a play <br/>
session with her.  Pay the price of a couple of lessons.  Tell them to just show <br/>
her a few things and not worry about follow-up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m probably a bit late in responding, but we got a good little violin off <br/>
ebay.  We stopped Suzuki lessons because they were taught by an intimidating 4 <br/>
foot tall nun, but should probably get around to taking some more.  We bought <br/>
it used and will resell it some day perhaps when the kids get to a bigger size. <br/>
 My four and five year old get the violins out probably once a week and play <br/>
on them.  Just for fun.  You can&#39;t beat it!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll hunt for more lessons soon...<br/>

**************************************<br/>
I just wanted to add that getting out instruments OURSELVES does so much to <br/>
get the children interested.  My son took accordian many years ago.  He hasn&#39;t <br/>
touched it in years.  The other day I got it out and started trying to learn <br/>
one of the Morris Dance songs for our 4H group.  I hadn&#39;t gotten the first line <br/>
done when he said, &quot;Here mom, let me try.&quot;  So I handed it to him.  2 HOURS <br/>
LATER......he handed it back to me :o).  He went through his entire book of <br/>
music.  &quot;Mom, it&#39;s so fun!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 He&#39;s 15 now, and was about 9 or 10 when he took lessons.  I think with some <br/>
kids maturity will spark interest too.<br/>
<br/>
Another time I got my fiddle out, and the accordian to work on 4H music, and <br/>
next thing I knew, the oldest foster son pulled down his guitar, Michael found <br/>
his harmonica, another pulled out his recorder, another found a different <br/>
guitar and a tin whistle.  Even my husband pulled out his Dobro (which he hasn&#39;t <br/>
touched in about a year) and started picking at it.  Music is so catching and <br/>
I personally love the sound of music being tried!<br/>
<br/>
I took lessons as a kid, hated it, but when I learned that the &quot;old <br/>
fashioned&quot; way that  common folks often learned music, passing it from one person to <br/>
another, I caught on very quickly to the fiddle.  I just always hated reading <br/>
music.  You don&#39;t have to read music to play music.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798927995">Around here, violins often turn up at pawn shops.  I know one shop that<br/>
started selling decent low end new violins he gets from over-seas somewhere.<br/>
They cost about 75 to 100 dollars.  Reasonable enough and when the child<br/>
outgrows it you can recoup some of your money selling it on ebay.  IMHO<br/>
you&#39;re more likely to get a deal from a local pawn shop or music store than<br/>
ebay where the bidding competition is national.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-819831284">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to let you know what we have done for our daughter who <br/>
is 6 yrs old.  She also insisted that she wanted to play violin <br/>
along with her piano lessons.  We shopped around and finaly decided <br/>
to go with a new no brand name one from ebay.  It is just great and <br/>
we only paid $40.00 (violin, case, bow, chin rest and rosin).  This <br/>
way it is no more expensive than one of those toy ones that breaks <br/>
the first time you use it and it is just like the name brand ones.  <br/>
We will be able to find out if she truly is interested or just <br/>
wanting to have a toy.  The good thing is that we can allways turn <br/>
around and sell it on ebay again.  <br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
