old at any other time may hold his attention long enough to get through a <br/>
chapter. When mine were little I kept the play-doh up on top of the frig and <br/>
only got it down occasionally, so it was special. Paints are good too. If <br/>
you don&#39;t feel up to the mess, maybe a paint with water book. I guess I am <br/>
picturing you all around the kitchen table, with him getting to do something <br/>
really fun that he can&#39;t do all the time, so he will have a positive <br/>
association with the reading time.<br/>
<br/>
You can also read in the garden while he plays outside, or at the <br/>
playground, or while he is taking a bath. Maybe you could find a 10 or so <br/>
year old neighbor who would like the practice for baby sitting-one who could <br/>
keep your little one occupied for a bit while you are there for a good <br/>
reference and maybe a bit of pay.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972949506">What about giving the 3yo a stack of his own books that he can flip through<br/>
an his own while you read? I was also going to suggest the activity thing.<br/>
You could even set up play-dough or paints at the kitchen table and you<br/>
could sit across the table and read with the 7yo sitting next to you. I kmow<br/>
this can be frustrating we have a 7yo and a 2yo with a 4yo in between and<br/>
finding activites can be very diificult. Of course, our younger ones usually<br/>
fall asleep earlier so we do have that time. The other thing we do is dh<br/>
takes the older one into one room and reads, while I go in with the other 2<br/>
and get them to sleep. Hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-257600478">Thanks Tracy but you idea wasn&#39;t bad either. Sometimes<br/>
different things work for same child at different<br/>
times. Depends on the mood and temperment of child.<br/>

attendance, but is being kept quiet and content by eating.  Your 7 yo could <br/>
snack, too.  My oldest will be 6 in Sept, and I have a 3 yo that will be 4 in <br/>
Nov.  Giving my 3 yo alternative activities entices my older child too much, <br/>
and he will not be able to pay attention well.  So, for me, playdough, and <br/>
painting would  not work.  Also, my 3 yo&#39;s attention span is not very long, <br/>
and he would want me to &quot;come see&quot; what it was he was working on about every <br/>
30 seconds   :).    I say,  feed him!  hee hee!  Good luck to you!  ~Karen</div>

to fight. Usually, I will say near by not interfering<br/>
but as soon as it starts to turn physical they get<br/>
separated and sent to their rooms till they are both<br/>
calm and can talk about it. I will ask each if they<br/>
love the other. If they are over it they say yes and I<br/>
will have them hug and make up and they run off to<br/>
play together. If not the one/s who is/are still upset<br/>
go back to their room till they are calmed down. It<br/>
helps to keep it peaceful and they learn how to work<br/>
things out and what isn&#39;t appropriate behavior when<br/>
doing so. Sometimes, though I forget to do this and<br/>
just try to solve the problem myself. Sometimes I will<br/>
even forget for a few days/weeks. Then I realize what<br/>
I am doing and turn myself back around. :-) Corallyn<br/>
