<div id="ygrps-yiv-600807858">I usually lurk, but feel compelled to speak up on the &quot;Ned issue&quot;.  <br/>
All of the complaining about the moderators and owners and old timers <br/>
being controlling about the purpose of this list bothers me.  It <br/>
seems to me if the owner/moderator wanted to be controlling they <br/>
would have booted Ned off the list a while ago. It seems to me that <br/>
they have been very patiently trying to point out to Ned where the <br/>
line is and Ned feigns (imo) confusion in order to continue his <br/>
rants. He doesn&#39;t seem interested in discussion to me, as evidenced <br/>
by his total unwillingness and refusal to answer any questions <br/>
directed to him by those that disagree or simply ask him to support <br/>
an assertion he has made.  So my question is, how much longer will <br/>
this go on before Ned is booted?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nobody, that I recall, has ever tried to invalidate Ned&#39;s opinions or <br/>
ideas, only tell him and tell him and tell him and tell him and tell <br/>
him that this is not the place for his rants nor the best place for <br/>
them to reach a receptive audience.  As many have pointed out, most <br/>
on this list have already come to the conclusion that ps is no place <br/>
for their child.  It seems to me, his posts would be more effective <br/>
in forums where people are just considering hsing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoy this list and appreciate all the support and advice I <br/>
have recieved from you all. I hope as just (mostly) a lurker, I am <br/>
not out of line with this post.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-303468859">I&#39;m another lurker and I completely agree with this post. I loved the analogy <br/>
of a list sharing Vegetarian recipes, etc and someone coming on bashing the <br/>
meat industry. How about a list for people sharing tips, patterns and ideas <br/>
for people making clothes for their family and someone coming on bashing <br/>
retail stores, high prices, talking about sweat shops, etc. Or a list for <br/>
stay at home moms sharing ideas and support and someone coming on bashing <br/>
moms who work outside the home. In every instance, most of the list would <br/>
probably agree with the person doing the bashing, but it&#39;s not where the <br/>
bashing should be done. There are other lists for that purpose.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-708946141">OK...I think that it is obvious that there are some on this list who like<br/>
to listen to ned&#39;s points of view and some who do not and who (desperately)<br/>
want the list to go back to the way it was before. We could keep going<br/>
back and forth endlessly and never get  back to talking about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Why can&#39;t Ned start his *own* unschooling list that would be open to whatever<br/>
discussions he wants and anyone on this list could go join it? That would<br/>
leave those of us who are tired of it to continue with this list and it&#39;s<br/>
initial purpose (as stated by the list owner and the old-timers). It is <br/>
incredibly easy to start a new list. This is what we did on our local<br/>
hsing list when debates started taking over the list...<br/>
an off-topic list was created that everyone was welcome to join but those<br/>
who were not interested did not have to get bogged down on the main list.<br/>
Please Ned...start your own list...those who are open to your message and ideas<br/>
will follow. Those of us who are not interested are not going to be swayed by<br/>
your posting here....<br/>
<br/>
And to the person who asked...if given the choice between the old-timers and Ned<br/>
and Bob I would take Sandra, Joyce, Mary, Elissa, Ren, Pam and the like any day!<br/>

they have been very patiently trying to point out to Ned where the <br/>
line is and Ned feigns (imo) confusion in order to continue his <br/>
rants. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Either he&#39;s feigning confusion (which does seem often to be true--he&#39;s <br/>
playing lawyer with words to slip through cracks), or he&#39;s just missing a lot <br/>
of interpersonal and intrapersonal skills which others on the list have.  <br/>
Many times those without those skills just deny they exist rather than <br/>
acknowledge that someone else has a perception they lack.  I have some <br/>
&quot;textbook bright&quot; friends (big on reading and math and logic) who don&#39;t at <br/>
all understand sports (why anyone would participate or watch), have no <br/>
interest in dance or art (because they say &quot;anyone can do that,&quot; although <br/>
they never try), and will deny that someone can tell if another person is <br/>
being honest, or is sad, or is gloating, just by their posture and the look <br/>
in their eyes and the tone of their voice.  They go ONLY by the words spoken, <br/>
oblivious of the hundreds of other behavioral communications.  And because <br/>
they can&#39;t see it they deny that others can either.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the discussions here seem as divided along those lines as if we <br/>
were discussing football and those who think football is an expensive, <br/>
dangerous, stupid waste of time were trying to keep the list from discussing <br/>
it all.<br/>

<br/>
Or someone else here who claims to love Ned&#39;s input could start a &quot;Let&#39;s All <br/>
Love Ned&#39;s Input&quot; list.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think they would get 850 members, but it shouldn&#39;t matter.  Five or <br/>
ten would be plenty, wouldn&#39;t it?  <br/>
<br/>
Unless Ned just wants this as a platform without regard for the feelings of <br/>
those who BUILT the platform.<br/>
