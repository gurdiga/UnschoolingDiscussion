 </span></blockquote>This link is being posted all over homeschooling lists; it&#39;s already<br/>
generating mail to CBS, and we don&#39;t even know what the story is about.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a reply I just posted to my local list:<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t yet know WHAT that story is about!  I mean, think about some of the<br/>
negative &quot;homeschooling&quot; stories of the past: the Randy Weaver family were<br/>
&quot;homeschoolers&quot;; so was Andrea Yates, who drowned her five children.  News<br/>
agencies write stories to get people to consume their particular media<br/>
product.  If it isn&#39;t sensational, it isn&#39;t news.<br/>
<br/>
If I were to guess at what &quot;the dark side to the movement that is putting<br/>
children&#39;s lives at risk&quot; might be, I&#39;d be inclined to look at the parents<br/>
themselves.  We argue for parental rights to guide our children&#39;s education,<br/>
but there may in fact be children at risk, who do not come into contact with<br/>
outsiders who might be able to recognize signs of abuse.  I had a friend who<br/>
grew up in a severely dysfunctional home; for her, school was her salvation<br/>
from the drinking and sexual abuse of the home.  (She homeschooled her own<br/>
kids, though.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking a lot lately about learning disabilities and other<br/>
physical or emotional problems which can effect kids.  Do we shortchange<br/>
them by failing to notice or ignoring problems which someone outside our<br/>
family might see?  I know, I know... schools really screw up the special ed<br/>
kids a lot of the time, so don&#39;t flame me &lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s just something that&#39;s<br/>
been on my mind for both professional and personal reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe CBS&#39;s story will turn out to be some homeschoolers&#39; choice to not<br/>
vaccinate their kids &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
(Look, I came up with three leads and I don&#39;t even work for CBS ;-)<br/>

On this subject -- kinda ot, I know -- did anyone here see ABC new&#39;s story this past Thursday on unvaxed kids being  a risk to others?  My Mom saw part of it and mentioned it to me yesterday.  I had seen the teaser for it, but we were out at the balloon fiesta that night so I missed the actual report.  I can&#39;t find it anywhere on line -- even tried a google after searching the ABC news site.  <br/>

CBS NEWS TRIES TO LINK HOMESCHOOLING WITH HOMICIDE  THIS WEEK<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Homeschooling has produced some brilliant young minds.. but there&#39;s a<br/>
dark side to the movement that is putting children&#39;s lives at risk. A<br/>
special Eye on America investigation only on Monday&#39;s CBS Evening<br/>
News.&quot;--  CBS News website, 10/12/03 <br/>
 <br/>
On Monday and Tuesday of this week (October 13 and 14), CBS News plans to<br/>
broadcast a two-part report which attempts to link homeschooling with<br/>
child abuse and homicide.  See the website at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/08/01/eveningnews/main15214.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/08/01/eveningnews/main15214.shtml</a><br/>
 <br/>
CBS News recently sent a team from Los Angeles to Raleigh and Smithfield,<br/>
N.C., to gather footage concerning a murder-suicide which occurred two<br/>
years ago in a formerly homeschooling family.  In the July 2001 incident,<br/>
14-year-old Brandon Keith Warren shot and killed two teenaged siblings<br/>
and then himself.  The family had been homeschooling at one time but<br/>
prior to the event had dropped out of compliance with state law and were<br/>
presumed truant.  Social Services had been in contact with the family on<br/>
numerous occasions, but charges of child abuse against the parents were<br/>
dismissed in the trial that followed the murders.<br/>
 <br/>
Although the producer has assured NCHE there is no attempt to portray<br/>
this as typical of home educators, CBS repeatedly asked NCHE President<br/>
Hal Young whether inadequate government oversight contributed to the<br/>
tragedy, and whether increased levels of regulation and home inspection<br/>
-- extended to all homeschool families -- could prevent such tragedies in<br/>
the future.  Since the family in question was already in violation of the<br/>
homeschool statute and was well known to local Social Services, there is<br/>
no reason to expect a stricter homeschooling law would have made a<br/>
difference.<br/>
 <br/>
NCHE&#39;s reply has always been that this tragedy was not a result of<br/>
educational choice.  Subjecting over 28,000 North Carolina families to<br/>
additional government scrutiny, paperwork and intrusion would neither<br/>
improve education nor prevent such a rare and unexpected crime.  Our<br/>
previous response to this suggestion in government circles is posted at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hslda.org/docs/news/hslda/200206060.asp">http://www.hslda.org/docs/news/hslda/200206060.asp</a><br/>
 <br/>
The 100,000-plus homeschooling parents and students in our state are<br/>
continuing to prove that home education is an effective means of<br/>
producing intelligent, sociable graduates, well-prepared for adult life. <br/>
In short, a remarkable tragedy in a single dysfunctional family does not<br/>
make a case for more restrictive homeschool laws.<br/>
 <br/>
NCHE is concerned that such a sensational report will encourage a<br/>
suspicious view of homeschoolers and consideration of regulatory issues<br/>
based on a false premise.    Homeschoolers may wish to monitor these<br/>
reports and consider their own response to neighbors, co-workers, or<br/>
family members in the days ahead.  NCHE will issue a public response<br/>
after the report specifics are shown.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Dar.  This is making the rounds pretty fast this morning.  CBS isn&#39;t<br/>
going to know what hit &#39;em &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Last year sometime, my local news station ran an online poll, asking if the<br/>
readers thought homeschoolers needed to be more accountable to the state.<br/>
That link flew all over the country, and they were flooded with NO responses<br/>
-- something like 900 of them.  The typical response to those polls is *far*<br/>
smaller &lt;g&gt;<br/>
