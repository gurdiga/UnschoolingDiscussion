<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I&#39;ve been misunderstood.  I believe that learning is and should be<br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
Learning IS<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;fun!!  Isn&#39;t that the whole point of Unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes I guess it is, I&#39;m new here and I&#39;m just trying to  &quot;learn&quot; the in&#39;s and<br/>
out&#39;s with regards to the whole &quot;unschooling&quot; concept.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Haha...I think most of us can relate to not enjoying math, in some form.<br/>
However, I still think that that is purely a teaching/learning methodology<br/>
problem, and not the material itself.  That is quite a leap for me from<br/>
saying, to myself and others, that I am not any &quot;good&quot; at math.  I never<br/>
was successful at it in school, but I have come to believe and understand<br/>
that my problems stemmed from poor teaching and not from some deficiency in<br/>
myself.  I was not able to learn by the methods that were shown to me, and<br/>
I was not told that there was any other way.  Therefor it became a<br/>
torturous exercise in futility to keep plugging away at it year after year.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes -- this unschooling is new to many of us.  I definitely am not giving <br/>
away my worksheets and textbooks until I&#39;m good an ready.  The beauty of un <br/>
-- doing what works for you and yours.  <br/>
<br/>
Re:  what&#39;s fun and albegra -- we like the CD Zoombinis -- pre-algebra I <br/>
guess, thinking and puzzle solving, who knows -- you may even like it!   <br/>
Personally, I think these games and puzzles and workbooks (computer and not) <br/>
are great for review -- not so terrific for the intial instruction on a <br/>
concept -- but they make practice and repetition, needed in some areas,  fun! <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-731505622">There was a discussion a month back or so about Algebra (I hope it was this <br/>
list  :~)<br/>
It was then, that I realized how much I LIKE ALGEBRA!<br/>
(thank-you to those who helped redefine exactly what Algebra means..)<br/>
Oh, the anticiaption....<br/>
Give a kid a dollar and tell them that the candy costs $3 per pound...how <br/>
much candy can they buy??!<br/>
That&#39;s algebra!<br/>
<br/>
If all &quot;teachers&quot; would put practical uses into the equation, just think how <br/>
many others would enjoy math... (oh...for such a perfect world....)<br/>
