<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878518620">Well, it&#39;s been an exciting day for us all today.  I didn&#39;t use any <br/>
workbooks seatwork or anything like that.<br/>
<br/>
First my husband took the girls grocery shopping, and let them pay <br/>
the cashier.  Then he took them to the bank, and let them talk to <br/>
some of the tellers.<br/>
<br/>
Then they came home and watched Lord Of the Rings cartoon with the <br/>
closed captioning on.  <br/>
<br/>
Then they helped cook dinner, and helped read from the cookbook.  <br/>
They also made eggrolls from scratch, that we fried.  (They LOVED <br/>
that)<br/>
<br/>
After we ate, the had a bath and played with several different kinds <br/>
of soaps.  Then me and Mirial read from the butterfly book.  Mariah <br/>
didn&#39;t want to read anything today, so after all the children went<br/>
 to bed she asked if she could have a satin hands treatment.  Satin <br/>
Hands is a product I sell that includes 4 steps, cream, buff, cleanse <br/>
then lotion.  So I told her I&#39;d give her a treatment if she would <br/>
give me one.  When it came her turn, she asked which tube was first, <br/>
I told her the emollient cream.  It took her about 5 minutes to <br/>
figure out which one was the right one, then we went to the buffing <br/>
cream, then the cleansing gel and last the lotion.<br/>
<br/>
She read every one of the lotion bottles, and didn&#39;t even realize <br/>
that she was learning...lol That may not be a big deal to some, but <br/>
she actually read some, no matter how minor, and that&#39;s a HUGE deal <br/>
to me.  I gave her a traveler size set and told her she could now do <br/>
her own hands every day, and if she had any problems remembering <br/>
which was which, to ask me.  So she may learn buffing before she does <br/>
bird, but hey a word is a word to me...lol<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t get to make the birdhouses, it rained most of the day.<br/>
<br/>
So I think we covered evey required topic today.  Science was the <br/>
soaps and butterflies.  Math was the cooking (they had to measure the <br/>
spoons of filling for each eggroll) and paying for the groceries.  <br/>
Social Studies was at the bank, the teller was nice and explained a <br/>
bit about her job to them, so they learned a bit about economics (no<br/>
we didn&#39;t plan that, but happy go lucky Mirial asked her about what <br/>
she was doing behind the counter and they both started asking <br/>
questions) and the reading was the movie and book and lotions.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the time, I&#39;m going to give them both some money tomorrow to <br/>
buy them a cheap watch each, and I&#39;m also going to buy a larger clock <br/>
with hands.  Next week we&#39;ll schedule some things to do based on time <br/>
of day, and let them &quot;Remind&quot; me when it&#39;s time to go. I think they <br/>
will love that MUCH better than worksheets. Say we have to leave her <br/>
at 2:45 every day to go to the park for 30 minutes.  I&#39;m also going <br/>
to start letting them earn a dime here, and a quarter there for <br/>
various tasks they may do around the house (like help keep an eye on <br/>
baby sister while I cook, or like helping me fold the towels) so they <br/>
can start saving more than just their allowance.<br/>
<br/>
Time and money and measuring are the only things that concern me <br/>
about the math.  <br/>
<br/>
I see tons of ways for them to learn about science and social studies <br/>
and math now that I am sitting back and watchign just what we are <br/>
doing that they can learn from. Still tryign to find other ways to <br/>
throw reading in, but it&#39;s a good start with bug books and the satin <br/>
hands.  I think I may also re bottle all the shampooes, bubble baths <br/>
and conditioners in the house.  Put them in same types of bottles, <br/>
where they can&#39;t see the colors, and just put plain labels on them, <br/>
then let them pick them out as they take thier baths, so they will <br/>
learn those words without realizing it.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, now that i think about it, I can probably get some of those <br/>
little tubs at wal mart also.  Put crayons in one, paper in the <br/>
other, puzzle pieces in others etc. and label those, it&#39;ll help <br/>
organize and also help them recognize those words.<br/>
<br/>
OK anoter loooong post, but I am quite surprised at how the day <br/>
turned out, surprised they did learn some things, and very surprised <br/>
that neither of them got mad, or cried all day except when they were <br/>
trying to fuss over who&#39;s turn it was to do an eggroll.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is going to work!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-247668444">Maria, I&#39;ve enjoyed watching you learn about unschooling, and all of <br/>
the ways the children are learning are great. The real joy, however, <br/>
will come when you realize you don&#39;t even have to think of what they <br/>
are learning or how. Life doesn&#39;t need to be divided into school <br/>
subjects. Cooking doesn&#39;t have to be math, just cooking. There is no <br/>
way you can stop them from learning. It&#39;s going to happen naturally <br/>
and with no effort or worry from you. If everything becomes a <br/>
learning experience in a schoolish way, then the joy of learning <br/>
dissolves. Imagine how much fun yesterday would have been for you if <br/>
you didn&#39;t have to figure out which subjects had been covered. Just <br/>
live and let it happen. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re doing great, btw. You have a wonderful attitude.<br/>
love, Valerie</div>

Maybe this is the hardest deschooling &quot;lesson&quot; of all -- that worry<br/>
isn&#39;t constructive.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maria, it does sound like you are getting there and have the idea. I just <br/>
want to interject one litte thing here. An take it for what it&#39;s worth but <br/>
it seems like you are putting too much effort in having the girls learn <br/>
&quot;naturally.&quot; I mean all this changing bottles and stuff. The girls &quot;will&quot; do <br/>
it on their own whether you lable bottles or not. Are you going to stick <br/>
pieces of paper on all the furniture labeling it too? I know people who do <br/>
that. The kids will get it on their own when they are ready to get it. There <br/>
are labels and signs everywhere, you&#39;ll find them doing it on their own when <br/>
the time comes for each one of them. My son reads everything now becuas he&#39;s <br/>
really into reading. My daughter does some but not like him. In the house, <br/>
when we eat when we drive, it&#39;s endless. Sometimes I have no idea what he&#39;s <br/>
talking about because I&#39;m busy cooking or watching the road. Point is, I <br/>
never labeled anything or closed captioned anything or did flash cards or <br/>
anything even near that. They WILL get it.<br/>

learning. Worry isn&#39;t constructive at any time for any purpose.<br/>
