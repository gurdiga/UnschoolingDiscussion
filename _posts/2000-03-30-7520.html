&lt;&lt; How do you all deal with wanting your child to like/learn<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  something and having it fall flat in realizing it isn&#39;t what they want. &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and Lisa <br/>
&lt;&lt;he barely even looked at them even when I tried to &quot;respark&quot; <br/>
<br/>
his interest in the original question.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
we know kids are not adults yet we sometimes expect them to act like them!  <br/>
their great little minds are on paths unknown... keep good resources around <br/>
and a willingness to help when called upon...<br/>
<br/>
i love what carol says about trust trust trust... it is not easy, not <br/>
quantifiable, but it works.  dont scramble for the castle supplies, or run <br/>
for the encyclopedia, THAT IS THEIR JOB.  if we steal their motivation, what <br/>
will they be left with?  i have heard it called benign neglect, which is a <br/>
term i am comfortable with but sounds criminal to some.  it allows children <br/>
the freedom to persue their interests at their own pace at their own level.  <br/>
to follow their creative juices creating some incredible sometimes tangible <br/>
projects!  if we let them come to us asking for what they need, we get a <br/>
clearer picture of our role in their whole learning deal.  i am excited that <br/>
i have had this opp. w/my kids and hope i will be strong enough to continue <br/>
to trust as each year passes...<br/>
