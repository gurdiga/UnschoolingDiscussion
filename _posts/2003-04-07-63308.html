 I don&#39;t think they stop caring.  They just are in a transition and healing <br/>
stage before they can embrace a new idea.  Sometimes they send their kids to <br/>
school instead.  Sometimes they unschool.  Sometimes they adopt a different <br/>
philosophy.  But I don&#39;t think anyone gives up and doesn&#39;t care anymore.  If <br/>
they didn&#39;t care, they wouldn&#39;t burn out. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know a Mom like that.<br/>
She &quot;homeschooled&quot; by not doing ANYTHING. I suppose being a single Mom and <br/>
not working would have put her in the position to be a fabulous unschooler. <br/>
But she never did anything with the kids.<br/>
She was kind and gentle, but not very aware or interesting.....no passions of <br/>
her own.<br/>
Her kids grew up with virtually NO knowledge of the world. Unaware of <br/>
historical events, mathematical concepts etc....<br/>
I think she really loved her children, and I still think they were better off <br/>
in that situation than in school BUT she was not an unschooler in my opinion.<br/>
She&#39;s close to her adult children, they are kind and well adjusted people, <br/>
finding their way in this world and I think they&#39;ll learn anything she didn&#39;t <br/>
expose them to in their own time. <br/>
But I also think it was educational neglect to just leave them on their own <br/>
and not be involved in showing more of the world to them.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
