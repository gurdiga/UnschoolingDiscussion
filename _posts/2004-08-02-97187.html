<br/>
There have already been some great suggestions. My suggestion would be to<br/>
shift your thinking of the word &quot;simple.&quot; The simple that I&#39;m reading above<br/>
is laden with guilt--at least in how I once saw those same issues. Sometimes<br/>
simple isn&#39;t going to be organic or non-toxic or politically correct, and<br/>
sometimes with small children that&#39;s okay because being with them in peace<br/>
and love is more important (sorry folks) than saving the world. If you think<br/>
in terms of raising peaceful, happy people that won&#39;t repeat the same<br/>
patterns, then you are, in fact, changing the world and making it a better<br/>
place in an arguably far more meaningful way. Sometimes being able to clean<br/>
up a mess quickly and easily is more important than making sure everything<br/>
is labeled organic and non-toxic. Sometimes making things *easy* instead of<br/>
*simple* (which reeks with a certain kind of consumerism) is the easiest<br/>
path towards enjoying your family and achieveing your number one goal: not<br/>
to hit your kids. If you focus on easy and joy and peace and happiness,<br/>
however, maybe you&#39;ll go one step further than that and not *want* to hit<br/>
your kids.<br/>
<br/>
I had three babies under three--all in diapers--1000 miles away from any<br/>
family. I know how hard things can be! I vividly remember laying my body<br/>
across the door to the playroom when I was pregnant with my third. Being<br/>
down on the floor with the girls really seemed to make a huge difference<br/>
rather than sitting on a couch or chair, and I could doze off after building<br/>
a few block towers, knowing that they would have to crawl/ climb over me to<br/>
get out of the room. I didn&#39;t have anyone to come in to help out, so for me,<br/>
life was all about coping strategies--finding ways to meet everyone&#39;s needs<br/>
whenever possible. Not necessarily perfect, but happy.<br/>
<br/>
When my first was born, I vowed only to use cloth diapers, organic food, the<br/>
whole shebang. Her skin was so sensitive that I used only water wipes after<br/>
changes--couldn&#39;t use diaper wipes for months--like 6 or 7. After a month of<br/>
battling with persistent diaper rash and dh&#39;s grandmother telling me that I<br/>
was just going to have to boil those diapers on the top of my stove (no<br/>
diaper service where we lived), I called it quits. Disposable diapers, no<br/>
diaper rash and a much happier baby and mama. When she was 6 mos. old, I<br/>
started making all of her baby food from scratch, mixed only with<br/>
breastmilk--all the while thinking to myself what an amazing mother I was<br/>
and what a great job I was doing. Well, after the fact sometime around the<br/>
time my second was going to start solids (who by the way never took baby<br/>
food anyway and just went straight to table food at around 10 mos), I read<br/>
something about how fresh carrots are too high in nitrites or something for<br/>
babies and that baby food carrots were actually better. Don&#39;t know if that&#39;s<br/>
true, but it did show me that there was a whole lot wrapped up in mothering<br/>
perfectly. Emily&#39;s favorite food had been carrots--her skin had even turned<br/>
an orange tinge because of them. Here I was filled with guilt because I&#39;d<br/>
made her carrots from scratch! Perfect turned out to be not so perfect after<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
Your goals up above still seem to me to be about perfection, and let&#39;s be<br/>
honest--perfection is anything but simple! Shift your goals toward truly<br/>
simplifying your life by first off letting go of the perfectionism.<br/>
Perfectionism also tends to be more about the mother than the children, and<br/>
what folks on this board are trying to get you to do is to focus on the kids<br/>
instead of yourself and on yourself instead of your kids in ways that are<br/>
healthy and productive. Right now the ways that you&#39;re focusing on both<br/>
yourself and your kids seem to be unhealthy, causing you to stagnate in a<br/>
pretty bad place. Shift from trying to mother perfectly to trying to mother<br/>
joyfully. Shift from trying to play with your kids to trying to connect with<br/>
your kids. Shift from trying to escape to trying to find peace and joy.<br/>
<br/>
The specifics strategies to acheive those goals will only come from trial<br/>
and error--finding what works for you and your kids. For me, the strategies<br/>
differ. Sometimes late in the day, I make myself a cappuccino and that&#39;s<br/>
enough to boost and comfort and focus on me. Sometimes the kids and I will<br/>
climb in my bed together and pop in a DVD. Sometimes we&#39;ll pull out a<br/>
boardgame or go play on the climbing wall. Sometimes we&#39;ll jump in the car<br/>
and go someplace we&#39;ve never been. Sometimes we&#39;ll make milkshakes or<br/>
make-your-own sundaes. For us, the key is usually to shake things up a bit,<br/>
because if we&#39;re starting to get on each other&#39;s nerves, it usually means<br/>
we&#39;re in a rut and getting antsy.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
This is soooooo key at my house.  I try to make things as easy as possible. If things are easy for me, then my life is easier, and my attitude is lighter.  I had to learn to not feel guilty over the fact that I was choosing to make things easier.  Our culture prides itself on martyrdom.<br/>
<br/>
I will make one other suggestion though. I&#39;ve been taking anti-depressants.  Without them I was much more more panicked about little things.  I felt &quot;out of control&quot; and &quot;guilty&quot; about everything whether there was a reason to or not.  I mentally rehash things over and over again in order to settle them in my mind.  I decided to try medication as a last resort and I only wish I had done it sooner.<br/>
<br/>
Now I feel like I can settle things in my mind and move on.  I don&#39;t dwell on things, and I feel much more able to focus.  All of this affects my kids because I can enjoy them so much more.<br/>
<br/>
You may want to look into this. It might just make things a little less scary for you while you figure things out.<br/>
