<div id="ygrps-yiv-17665697">Trisha,<br/>
      I too have an only child not from choice. We are in the process of <br/>
adoption but as my daughter is now 11, this new baby will not be much of a <br/>
playmate.  My daughter also needs me to do everything with her.  Some people <br/>
might label that behavior &quot;dependent&quot;. Me, I don&#39;t believe in labels.  My <br/>
daughter  needs my companionship and I give it to her.   This has led to the <br/>
most beautiful and pure relationship I have ever had and I feel blessed.  <br/>
Don&#39;t worry about your son - enjoy him and paint with him and spend as much <br/>
time with him as possible!  We all know they grow too fast...   jackie</div>
