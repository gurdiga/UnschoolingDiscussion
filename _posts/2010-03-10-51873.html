<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523912723">It isn&#39;t that I&#39;m skeptical about unschooling. I LOVE the ideas behind it, <br/>
the philosophy, the foundations. It&#39;s just that I couldn&#39;t SEE (I&#39;m very <br/>
visual, if you hadn&#39;t guessed) how it would play out in our family, so it <br/>
was a lot like stepping out on a limb for me. I have a learner&#39;s heart that <br/>
seems to also contain a heavy desire to teach. But then do we not naturally <br/>
desire to teach what we learn, just out of pure enthusiasm?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this morning I noticed my (almost-15) daughter&#39;s laptop open to some <br/>
research she is doing on healthy eating habits for dancers. She chuckled and <br/>
said, &quot;I just read this entire page, Mom. Can you believe that?&quot; The joke is <br/>
because my daughter does NOT like to read, especially for information. I <br/>
have no idea how that happened, either, with both parents and all four <br/>
brothers being avid readers, but I digress. The bigger surprise came when <br/>
she told me that one of the website&#39;s suggestions was a certain percentage <br/>
ratio of fruits/veggies to protein to carbs. You have to understand: you <br/>
mention a term that even smells like a math word and my daughter breaks out <br/>
in hives. She said it herself, even smiling, and no hives.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s a nice start to our day, personally. :D<br/>

If you change the word &quot;teach&quot; to &quot;share,&quot; will agree wholeheartedly.<br/>
