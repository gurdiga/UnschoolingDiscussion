This was very interesting,  however, this method of relating to, or parenting <br/>
the indigo child, that is the way most of us are already raising our <br/>
children, with respect and love.  To me, this whole thing fits &quot;the second <br/>
child&quot;  the one who is outside the box, who doesn&#39;t fit the pattern but is <br/>
loving, caring and will say to his dad &quot;can we talk? &quot; But I also treat the <br/>
eldest with the same love, choices, and respect.  I have always explained to <br/>
my children why I say to do or not to do something.   I guess the bottom line <br/>
is, I don&#39;t know if  I believe this, about the indigo children, but I do <br/>
believe in the method of parenting!</div>

What a wondrful post. Reminded me a lot of my oldest dd (8 in Nov.). She<br/>
too, naturally gravitates toward adults that are open and receptive to her<br/>
and gets along much better with those that are 40 something than 7 or 8<br/>
(provided they understand her).  Guess I&#39;ll have to reaed the book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215341456">Thanks for this interview!  I got the book some months ago after having many <br/>
people recommend it after meeting my daughter.  It is very clear that she is <br/>
a great teacher and my whole life has changed by having her.   <br/>
<br/>
  She does not fit in.  She just doesn&#39;t.  She has her own agenda and is very <br/>
intelligent.  Her second grade teacher told me she wasn&#39;t just asking <br/>
questions, she was providing alternative ways to teach the lesson itself.  <br/>
Needless to say, this did not go over well in a typical classroom.   <br/>
 <br/>
 I&#39;ve found my major &#39;job&#39; as her mother is to get out of her way.  She has a <br/>
great heart, but she also speaks her mind.  I have found there are a lot of <br/>
adults that still believe in the &#39;be seen and not heard&#39; child, and those <br/>
adults have a big problem with her.  The ones that don&#39;t think of children as <br/>
inferior and as little people they need to &#39;control&#39; actually &#39;hear&#39; her and <br/>
are amazed at the things that come out of her at times!   She also seems to <br/>
naturally gravitate to people who are open and receptive to her and who treat <br/>
her as an equal and to shy away from those who see her as less.  She has a <br/>
hard time relating to a lot of kids and her best friends are other adults.  <br/>
She just walks right up to people and starts conversations and she&#39;s done <br/>
this ever since she could walk and talk.  I never discouraged this, and it <br/>
taught me how friendly and wonderful people actually are, as I would end up <br/>
in the conversation when I came to get her.  She opened up my whole world.<br/>
I have heard &#39;she&#39;s going to be president someday&#39; so many times I can&#39;t tell <br/>
you, but, I really have no idea what her path is and what she came here to <br/>
do.  I am only here to support and encourage her and that by being her <br/>
teacher to never forget that I am also her student.<br/>
<br/>
I am very grateful to books like Indigo Children because it comes from the <br/>
perspective that there is nothing to &#39;fix&#39;, nothing to manipulate or control, <br/>
only to understand and work with.  And that these are not characteristics to <br/>
merely tolerate, but to accept and love because they are a part of <br/>
themselves, that, given expression in the right arena, will prove to be their <br/>
contribution to the world.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you all for your comments on this book.  I&#39;ve got to have it, now.  <br/>
This so sounds like my son.  We were all getting our hair cut today, and he <br/>
was sitting across from me having an annimated conversation with his stylist. <br/>
 What struck me was that it wasn&#39;t a monologue.  He kept asking her if she <br/>
knew anything about Pokemon, what her favorite TV show was, did she like to <br/>
play board games, etc.  I was quite impressed -- he&#39;s 7 and he has never felt <br/>
intimidated by an adult.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-243744035">Jennifer, how old is your daughter? She sounds like a great person.<br/>
<br/>
I also learn so much from my kids. Jenny, my baby, has been my joy teacher, <br/>
as I have mentioned before. She is 3 now. When she was a baby she had to be <br/>
in the garden every day. We would usually go out in the morning for <br/>
coffee-if we missed that time for some reason or other she would get fussy <br/>
and we realized that was the problem so we would take her out for a bit and <br/>
all would be fine. To her, a leaf falling onto the tray of her walker was a <br/>
precious gift from the heavens. She was filled with wonder at the song of a <br/>
bird or a butterfly passing by. When that baby smiled, the joy came from <br/>
every ounce of her being. You can&#39;t be near that without realizing that <br/>
these things are available to us as well. Bliss truly is our inherent <br/>
nature.<br/>
<br/>
Now that she is 3, she talks so much more and I can show her so many things. <br/>
She has a garden of her own-full of zinnias so she can pick as many as she <br/>
wants, and it attracts loads of those butterflys that she loves. We made a <br/>
picture a few weeks ago from shapes that I cut out and she glued, of <br/>
construction paper. It disappeared from the refrigerator, and I saw this <br/>
light in her face when I said &quot;We&#39;ll just have to make another on.&quot; She <br/>
didn&#39;t realize that we could do it again! Then she wanted to duplicate the <br/>
first picture exactly-I suggested making it a night picture, and we made <br/>
stars and a moon instead of a sun and clouds. You can see the connections <br/>
and the ideas growing in her mind as the possabilities opened up for her. <br/>
And I get to share it all-I get to see all the things that I have taken for <br/>
granted through these new eyes. I get to feel the joy and wonder at flowers <br/>
and falling leaves and the magic that happens to a cookie through the window <br/>
of the oven door. We share in the learning-I may be the one who knows how to <br/>
cut the shapes or mix the dough, but she is the one teaching how wonderful <br/>
it is to be able to.<br/>
<br/>
Gosh, thanks for getting me inspired to write all of this-I think that now <br/>
with my house all quiet and the sun coming up I will turn off the computer <br/>
and take my coffee to the garden! I have 4 more kids, so maybe tomorrow I <br/>
will write of another of my teachers.<br/>
<br/>
Love, Cathie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393597416">Jenny sounds like a great teacher Cathie!  I loved your post!!  Ariel is 9 <br/>
and when she was at Jenny&#39;s age she had that sense of just loving the world.  <br/>
I saw that  disappear to a certain degree when she went into school for three <br/>
years.  I&#39;m so fortunate I&#39;m able to be home with her now!  We&#39;ve been home <br/>
one year and I see that enthusiasm for life coming back. <br/>
She had taught me how to &#39;see&#39; a butterfly again and reminded me how <br/>
wonderful and  mysterious the world around us really is.  I had forgotten.  <br/>
Since she is so intuitive,  she reminds me of those innate abilities I had <br/>
shut off for so many years.   Now that I think about it, I mostly run my life <br/>
now through intuitive/gut feelings because I have found they never steer me <br/>
wrong.  Since I have started doing that, my life is 100% better.  I know I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be the same person without her , she woke me up and made me remember <br/>
who I am.<br/>
<br/>
I was looking through the book again and see that they do talk about things <br/>
like auras, and it is definitely a &#39;new agey&#39; kind of book.  I&#39;ve had so many <br/>
experiences though, of  things that the book talks about.  One of my friends <br/>
said when his daughter was young she used to see &#39;colors&#39; around people, and <br/>
I know my daughter has telekinetic abilities, she showed me once, but said <br/>
she never wanted to use it to make money or anything  because that would be <br/>
wrong.  She was so matter of fact about the whole thing.  It suprised me at <br/>
first, but there was a part that wasn&#39;t suprised at all, that knows there is <br/>
so much more going on here than we can imagine.  I guess the natural reaction <br/>
is to be scared of something we don&#39;t understand, but, why?  Oh well. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your posts guys, oh, and a quote I heard recently, twice this week <br/>
actually, don&#39;t know who it said it originally--<br/>
<br/>
The soul would rather fail at it&#39;s own life<br/>
Than succeed at someone else&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Really liked that one,,,inspiring, and also helps me to remember that my <br/>
daughter is a wise old soul who already knows a lot of things.<br/>
<br/>
Love,,,,Jennifer</div>
