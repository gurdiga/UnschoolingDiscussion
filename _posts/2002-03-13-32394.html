<div id="ygrps-yiv-756807281">im an unschooler...i just keep a journal of our life and it turns into a <br/>
paragraph for each subject quarterly which is what we are required....we <br/>
havent tested yet. that i s where I will be as creative as possible ~ perhaps <br/>
Seton which costs $20~ but minimal pre-requisite learning. 5th grade is the <br/>
first we have to t est. and they only have to pass 33% to be legal. IM HOPING <br/>
FOR A LOT MORE THAN THAT! Denise</div>
