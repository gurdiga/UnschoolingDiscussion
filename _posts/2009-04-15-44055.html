<div id="ygrps-yiv-620880459">Hello all!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Darcel. I&#39;m a SAHM to two girls 4 and 2<br/>
I&#39;m in VA and will be attending the HEAV conference with my husband in June.<br/>
I always said I would never homeschool my kids, then one day I woke up with it heavy on my heart. It was a hard pill for my husband to swallow. He&#39;s not completely on board either. He doesn&#39;t understand that I want unschooling to be a way of life for us. The way I see it, we&#39;ve been unschooling since birth, why stop now? I read John Holt&#39;s &#39;Learning all the time&#39; Loved it!<br/>
<br/>
DH grew up with education pounded into his head. Go to school and learn this this and that.<br/>
He often tries to teach dd things when she is having fun on her own. Every single time she stops and finds something else to do.<br/>
I hated school and now wish I had been homeschooled. I think I would&#39;ve done so much better.<br/>
<br/>
Everything our girls know they taught themselves.<br/>
My oldest is in speech therapy 5 days a week for 3 hours a day. She loves riding the bus and going to &quot;school&quot;.<br/>
When she was 3 she scored on the level of a 5 yr old for colors, numbers and letters and word recognition.<br/>
My husband said we could try homeschooling this year. She is supposed to register for Kindergarten next year. She&#39;ll be 5 in December.<br/>
He was totally against the idea at first, but now he&#39;s open to it and wants to read more and learn more about homeschooling. Whenever I say unschooling to him he gets tense, lol<br/>
I know it&#39;s because he doesn&#39;t get it yet. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m scared. It feels natural, but I can&#39;t completely get the school way of thinking out of my head.<br/>
We paint, color, go for walks, do puzzles and my girls have tons of play w/out me. They also like to help me cook and clean. My oldest has some Kindergarten workbooks that she got for her 3rd bday from a friend. I leave them out and she picks them up every now and then. Sometimes she asks for help and others she just browses the pages with her sister.<br/>
I feel there is more I should be doing with them. There is more I want to do with them, but finances are tight.<br/>
I guess I just need encouragement.<br/>
<br/>
I know that was long and I apologize. <br/>
Thanks for reading<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If there won&#39;t be unschoolers there, don&#39;t go.  Regular conferences  <br/>
are about politics and about the sale of school-at-home materials.   <br/>
Save your money for better, real-world things.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You should let that go.  It&#39;s not worthy of your attention.  Your  <br/>
daughter would have as much ability to learn if she had scored as a  <br/>
one year old at three.   Colors, numbers and letters are an  <br/>
infinitesimal part of the world.  They&#39;re a huge part of school, which  <br/>
is itself a small part of the world.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Whenever I say unschooling to him he gets tense, lol<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t say it then.  Say unstructured homeschooling or personalized  <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>

You can, but it takes desire and conscious thought and time.<br/>

For your husband, he might like Joyce&#39;s site better than mine.  Mine  <br/>
is more emotional than Joyce&#39;s (in a way).  Hers is very logical in  <br/>
more ways than one.   It&#39;s not that mine isn&#39;t logical, it&#39;s just that  <br/>
I&#39;m not at all above using emotionally manipulative rhetoric. &lt;bwg&gt;    <br/>
And I&#39;m not above shining a light on other people&#39;s bad ideas.   Joyce  <br/>
does that too, but her light is operating room light and mine&#39;s as  <br/>
likely to be a torch or a candle.<br/>

<br/>
I think most of us grew up this way!  It&#39;s hard to overcome that.  It&#39;s<br/>
hard to get over the fact that for years, we had to do things for other<br/>
people, completely unrelated to our own selves.  Then one day, you<br/>
realize that life doesn&#39;t have to be that way!  It sounds like that is<br/>
where you are at, but perhaps your husband hasn&#39;t gotten there yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; He often tries to teach dd things when she is having fun on her own.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Every single time she stops and finds something else to do.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Does your husband enjoy that?  Would he enjoy just playing with her with<br/>
no motivation behind it other than joy and time shared together? <br/>
Perhaps he needs some gentle coaching on how to play with his kids. <br/>
Some fathers really don&#39;t know how to do that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I hated school and now wish I had been homeschooled. I think I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>would&#39;ve done so much better.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean!  One of my good friends growing up was<br/>
homeschooled.  She was able to do all the stuff that I wished I had time<br/>
for but never did because I was in school all day, then homework, then<br/>
down time from all that stress.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Everything our girls know they taught themselves.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Everything your girls know, they learned from living.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This sounds like way too much school.  Speech therapy is becoming really<br/>
popular these days.  I think it&#39;s way overused for issues that resolve<br/>
themselves on their own.  I don&#39;t know why your child is in speech<br/>
therapy, but, wow, 3 hrs a day, 5 days a week!  That is a LOT of school,<br/>
for not even being school age.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t hold your daughter to her score that she got at the age of 3.<br/>
Lots of kids have lots of talents, sometimes they are way ahead of<br/>
others their own age in various things and sometimes they are way<br/>
behind.  OR you could see it like this;  All kids are exactly where they<br/>
need to be, knowing exactly what they need to know, for who they are,<br/>
and all kids know lots of things that other kids don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; My husband said we could try homeschooling this year. She is<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know it&#39;s because he doesn&#39;t get it yet. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe don&#39;t say unschooling to him.  Maybe talk about good reasons not<br/>
to push academics on young children.  There is a lot of information out<br/>
there about that, there are expensive private schools that base their<br/>
education on it!  Maybe, for now, do lots of things with your kids that<br/>
are involved and interesting and engaging, keep them busy with fun<br/>
activities where your husband can see physical results of those<br/>
projects.<br/>
<br/>
I did that a lot when my oldest was little because my husband didn&#39;t<br/>
really get unschooling.  We did a LOT of projects and field trips.  He<br/>
could see that she was creatively engaged with life and that helped him<br/>
relax and let me do what I wanted to do.  He did eventually come around.<br/>
It was slow and it took many years until he &quot;got it&quot; to the point that<br/>
he was doing it too.  That daughter is 15, and she&#39;s an awesome kid!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m scared. It feels natural, but I can&#39;t completely get the school<br/>
 </span></blockquote>way of thinking out of my head.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s always hard to buck the system!  School is so integrated into<br/>
people&#39;s lives, our culture, and the way people live.  As my oldest has<br/>
gotten older, so have her schooled friends.  Something that my husband<br/>
and I have noticed is how parents stop really seeing their kids.  By the<br/>
time they are in middle school they are so far into seeing their kids<br/>
through the lense of how well they do in school, that nothing else<br/>
really matters.  As long as the kids are getting good grades the parents<br/>
and kids get along fine.  Parenting is no longer about raising kids, and<br/>
helping them become wonderful people, it&#39;s ALL about making sure they<br/>
get good grades and graduate.<br/>
<br/>
We have something different than that!  We have real people for kids,<br/>
real people with real feelings and real likes and dislikes.  Unschooling<br/>
preserves that &quot;sight&quot;, being able to see your kids for the people that<br/>
they are.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; We paint, color, go for walks, do puzzles and my girls have tons of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>play w/out me. They also like to help me cook and clean.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It might help for you to see those activities and how and what your kids<br/>
are learning from them.  Puzzles build math and spatial skills. <br/>
Cleaning builds organizational skills, detail data.  Cooking can be oh<br/>
so many things.  A walk in the park can be one huge discovery of<br/>
ecology, or it could be all about physical exhertion and knowledge of<br/>
how bodies work.  These are just examples, small examples.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; My oldest has some Kindergarten workbooks that she got for her 3rd<br/>

then. Sometimes she asks for help and others she just browses the pages<br/>
with her sister.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We always had workbooks and coloring books and the like.  We have some<br/>
still from when my oldest was little, that my youngest has pulled out<br/>
and played with.  They get used sometimes, and sometimes not.  I&#39;ve<br/>
recycled loads of them over the years.  I never graded them or had any<br/>
investment in them as fill in answer type things.  They were toys,<br/>
things to play around with.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I feel there is more I should be doing with them. There is more I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>want to do with them, but finances are tight.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the time you have with them while they are little and thrills are<br/>
cheap!  There are so many things you can do with young kids that don&#39;t<br/>
cost loads of money!  Sometimes I wish I was still there... the ways in<br/>
which I need to support my older daughter these days costs money, there<br/>
is no way around that!  It&#39;s a fact of life that kids cost money! <br/>
Unschooling costs money, homeschooling costs money, even public school<br/>
costs money (do you even know how many fundraisers they have?)!</div>

Yes.  Think it, share it with your husband, but don&#39;t tell the kids.   <br/>
And before long you&#39;ll be trusting that learning is happening even  <br/>
when you don&#39;t analyze the activities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456090204">Thank you both so much for the insight! You&#39;ve given me lots to think about. DD is not enrolled in the school yet. She was supposed to start 2 weeks ago, but for some reason we haven&#39;t taken her back. I asked DH yesterday why we were putting her back in the program anyway. She keeps asking to go to school like she did back home. She went 3 days a week then. I can honestly say back then she truly needed it and has improved SO much.<br/>
Now we were thinking of putting her back in because she keeps asking to go to school. <br/>
<br/>
I talked with DH more yesterday and sent him the link to Joyce&#39;s site.<br/>
Thanks again Jenny and Sandra!<br/>

provide that &quot;school&quot; like activity, it&#39;s not forever or high pressure. <br/>
The time commitment is more relaxed, you can skip a class if you or she<br/>
wants to, or even drop the whole thing if needed.  School isn&#39;t so easy<br/>
about that sort of thing, you have to attend or be penalized.</div>
