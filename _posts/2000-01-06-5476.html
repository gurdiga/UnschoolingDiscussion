&gt; Welcome to TMM&#39;s annual paleontology showcase! The Texas Memorial<br/>
&gt; Museum has millions of fossils in its collections. Spanning hundreds<br/>
&gt; of millions of years, our fossils tell the story of the natural<br/>
&gt; history of Texas. At any given time, however, only a fraction of TMM&#39;s<br/>
&gt; fossils are on display in exhibits. The rest are in our research labs,<br/>
&gt; on loan to other museums around the world, or stored in our collection<br/>
&gt; areas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This exhibit allows us to show off some of TMM&#39;s finest fossils. Some,<br/>
&gt; like the saber-toothed cat and the exquisite starfish from South<br/>
&gt; Austin, are old favorites that haven&#39;t been on display in<br/>
&gt; years. Others, like Chasmosaurus and the plesiosaur, are newer<br/>
&gt; acquisitions that have never been seen in public. In addition to our<br/>
&gt; own specimens, we are fortunate enough to have a few rare pieces on<br/>
&gt; loan for this exhibit. Two specimens are on loan from other museums:<br/>
&gt; Confuciusornis from the Beijing Museum of Natural History, and<br/>
&gt; Thrinaxodon from The University of California at Berkeley. In<br/>
&gt; addition, Diplocaulus is on loan from a private collector. We are<br/>
&gt; grateful to these lenders for allowing us the chance to display their<br/>
&gt; specimens.<br/>
