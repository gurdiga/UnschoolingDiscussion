<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Let me know what comebacks you receive.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I received a piece of advice here a while back on this, and it&#39;s worked<br/>
fairly well.  When people start in on my homeschooling, I wait for them to<br/>
take a breath and then start in on a looooong discourse about how<br/>
wonderfully things are going, how happy we all are, how much Tim has learned<br/>
lately, how grateful I am to have people in life who are supportive of what<br/>
I do, how educational life is, how many interesting things we&#39;ve read or<br/>
seen videos about lately, Tim&#39;s talents, his music lessons, his theatre<br/>
work, how helpful he is, etc. etc.  By the time I finished, only my MIL was<br/>
dumb enough to make another comment, and I just prattled on for another few<br/>
minutes and she left me alone for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My own mother called CPS on me<br/>
&gt; for homeschooling my kids. She is a teacher and feels that they are more<br/>
&gt; qualified for the job.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>SO WHAT!  They&#39;re not her kids, so the fact that she thinks she could do it<br/>
better is totally beside the point.  And calling CPS for homeschooling is,<br/>
in my humble opinion, a waste of CPS&#39;s time.  They have better things to do.<br/>
Obviously she needs something better to do, eh?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have to disagree my husband has 2 1/2 yrs. of<br/>
&gt; Mechanical Engineer and I am a Certified Legal Assistant in the State of<br/>
&gt; Texas. I feel that we as parents are equally qualified.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The last statement is true.  As parents, you are wonderfully qualified.<br/>
Your education is not relevant.  If someone truly wants to homeschool,<br/>
they&#39;ll find a way to do it, because they love their kids and believe in it.<br/>
You don&#39;t need any particular education to do this, just a healthy curiosity<br/>
about the world which you can communicate to your children.<br/>

into your house they can find all kinds of things to get involved <br/>
with and it&#39;s sometimes hard to get rid of them.  <br/>

into one-upmanship at the family holiday party too.<br/>
