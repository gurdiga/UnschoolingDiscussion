<div id="ygrps-yiv-333358642">I&#39;m not trying to start controversy I&#39;m truly learning here. Some thoughts I&#39;ve had lately.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us don&#39;t let our small babies play in danger zones of the house unsupervised. For eg. letting them stick a toy into an outlet. We protect them by either removing them or covering the outlet. We wouldn&#39;t let them crawl up and pull a pan of boiling water onto themselves because the consequences of that would be horrific.  We often gate the stairs if we think there is a chance that an active 6 month old might fall down them. We remove things from their level that might cause them harm.<br/>
<br/>
So how do you all decide the difference between letting your children do what they wish and keeping them safe? How do you know for sure that your 3 year old or 4 year old  or 10 year old really understands the dangers of certain situations? Sure it&#39;s easy to see physical damage but how do we know what phsycological damage is happening?<br/>
How do you know that the psychological damage of certain choices couldn&#39;t be just as bad to them. Eg. if we just let them sit from the age of 18 months or  even 5 years in front of a t.v. watching shows full of violence or sex etc.? I mean afterall we don&#39;t come into the world knowing everything. Their brains are still growing. If they are allowed from an early age to choose to sit and watch violence or to just  do nothing day after day, what says we aren&#39;t damaging them?  No we can&#39;t protect them forever but how do we know that a  3 year old is ready to handle it.  If they sit watching people killed in movies or video games day after day after day aren&#39;t we desensitizing them from these types of things. Making them think it&#39;s normal or acceptable. I see the fear sometimes on my 9 year old after she watches the news. She thinks all those bad things might happen to her. Then she has nightmares. But she will still watch and then become worried all the time about it happening to her. Then this effects the way she acts in the time period following making her afraid of the world. I noticed this actually when Elizabeth Smart was found. We turned on the coverage of her being found and it was a happy time, but my 9 year old was obsessed with the fact that she had been taken and was very scared for a while after.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really struggling on just letting them do whatever  interests them and realizing that they are still not able to completely comprehend the consequences of some choices and by the time they do it might be too late as the damage might be done already either physically or mentally.   <br/>
<br/>
I really struggle with these thoughts every day which keeps me from enjoying this journey with my kids.<br/>

to sit in front of the TV all day watching violence or sex.  This assumption <br/>
just doesn&#39;t hold true in the families that I know where children do have the <br/>
choice.  <br/>

<br/>
Well, from my experience, given the freedom of choice, my kids just didn&#39;t choose to sit and watch violent shows when they were younger ... they just weren&#39;t interested.  In fact, they still aren&#39;t interested and they are 6, 9, and 11.  But, even if they were, you don&#39;t just leave them alone for hours in front of the TV; you watch with them.  Probably not all the time, but regularly.  And you engage them in conversation.  Maybe you say &quot;Yuck, I think that&#39;s gross!&quot;, or &quot;I wonder how they got that to look so realistic?&quot; (whatever you&#39;re really thinking) and by enjoying the moment with them, as a byproduct you will learn what it is that is interesting to them and why.  It&#39;s a win-win situation!  By talking about what is interesting to them, you get to share your knowledge about the subject and they get to share their knowledge and excitement with you.  And you&#39;ve enjoyed each others company.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
As for doing nothing, it may look like that to you, but there is definitely something going on, even if it&#39;s not physical ... unless they are sleeping ;-)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m really struggling on just letting them do whatever  interests them and realizing that they are still not able to completely comprehend the consequences of some choices and by the time they do it might be too late as the damage might be done already either physically or mentally.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t suggest you just screw up your courage and drop all imposed limits.  But you can definitely ease into it.  For example:<br/>
<br/>
Next time they want to do something they find interesting, but you think has no redeeming value, say sure and join in.  I bet you&#39;ll be interested to see why they are interested, and you may be surprised to find that they are learning.<br/>
<br/>
Next time they want to stay up past bedtime because they are in the middle of something, just say okay.  And marvel that they are so engaged in something that makes them happy.<br/>
<br/>
Next time they want a snack close to dinner, realize that they are hungry now and that you want them to listen to their bodies, not watch the clock.  And if they&#39;re not hungry when dinner is ready, save them a plate for later.<br/>
<br/>
Next time they want to build a big fort (or get out all the craft stuff etc.) in the family room, don&#39;t start to get all twitchy and grim and remind them they better clean it up after they&#39;re done.  Smile, help them carry the blankets over, and maybe surprise them with a snack or hot chocolate for you all to enjoy inside.  The joy you will see in their eyes is infectious and worth way more than a tidy family room.<br/>
<br/>
The great thing is that you&#39;ll learn to trust them - their goal is not to make you miserable - and they&#39;ll learn to make good decisions, not just how to follow someone&#39;s rules (Joyce had a great post about this yesterday).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468050174">Thanks Pam!  I really have been letting go little by little. Letting them eat if they are hungry if they dont&#39; think they can hold out the extra 30 minutes till dinner  for eg.  I&#39;ve always let them build and construct things in our home. But I  guess I don&#39;t understand the logic of them not having to clean up such creations they make if it&#39;s in the center of our home. I don&#39;t understand the allowing of them to play violent video games. I&#39;m against violence of all type and to me personally, violent movies and video games glorifies it in their minds. My oldest has friends that play these games every free moment they get and I do think that it can cause damage to one&#39;s mental thinking. I might be wrong but this is one place I&#39;d rather take a chance on being wrong then just hoping that it&#39;s doing no harm. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard sometimes to express what one is really getting at. I just read a lot on this list about no limits, but yet we do set limits for safety reasons for infants and I&#39;m wondering why/when that necessarily  jsut changes.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Most of us don&#39;t let our small babies play in danger zones of the house <br/>
unsupervised. For eg. letting them stick a toy into an outlet. We protect them <br/>
by either removing them or covering the outlet. We wouldn&#39;t let them crawl up <br/>
and pull a pan of boiling water onto themselves because the consequences of <br/>
that would be horrific.  We often gate the stairs if we think there is a chance <br/>
that an active 6 month old might fall down them. We remove things from their <br/>
level that might cause them harm. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the same way with my adult friends, though.  If they&#39;re about to <br/>
accidently do something dangerous (sit on scissors, walk on a wet floor, change a <br/>
lightbulb without standing on something I know for sure to be safe) I&#39;ll quickly <br/>
intervene and help make the situation safer.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How do you know for sure that your 3 year old or 4 year old  or 10 year old <br/>
really understands the dangers of certain situations?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that my 14 and 17 year olds really understand the dangers of all <br/>
situations, but I know they have a lot of experience with making respnsible <br/>
decisions and with being analytical, because for 14 and 17 years I&#39;ve give them <br/>
safe opportunities to practice.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sure it&#39;s easy to see physical damage but how do we know what phsycological <br/>
damage is happening?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m with my kids a lot, and not just in the same house, but right beside <br/>
them, watching what they&#39;re watching, answering their questions about what we all <br/>
saw elsewhere, or about why another family is not like ours, or why the cat&#39;s <br/>
walking funny or why the air smells like smoke.   We have, since they were <br/>
little, helped them analyze the world around them, and one result is that we are <br/>
near enough to feel their moods and responses in a more visceral way.   We <br/>
don&#39;t wait for them to come and tell us they&#39;re uncomfortable about something.  <br/>
We can tell by how close they sit, how long they stand around where other <br/>
people are, by how they eat and sleep afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
A moment of time out:  many people ignore entirely any instinct they have <br/>
toward the interpersonal or intrapersonal skills they have.  Partly they&#39;ve been <br/>
around too many rules and truisms about what should be and so they&#39;ve shoved <br/>
aside their perceptions of what is.  And none of that &quot;counts in school.&quot;  When <br/>
a kid is good at interpersonals, they&#39;re criticized for talking too much and <br/>
for not leaving the other kids alone to take care of their own problems <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How do you know that the psychological damage of certain choices couldn&#39;t <br/>
be just as bad to them. Eg. if we just let them sit from the age of 18 months <br/>
or  even 5 years in front of a t.v. watching shows full of violence or sex <br/>
etc.?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had three eighteen month olds, and three five year olds.    Not once did <br/>
they say &quot;OOOH!  Violence and sex.&quot;  And they rarely if ever &quot;sat in front of <br/>
a T.V.&quot; in the way I&#39;m guessing you mean.  If there was a TV on, they were <br/>
never required to &quot;SIT.&quot;  Holly surprised me when she was five by sitting down <br/>
to watch part of Twelfth Night (Helena Bonham Carter version) with a little <br/>
girl from across the street.  I expected them to watch a bit and wander off.  <br/>
They watched all the rest of it.  I neither made them nor forbid them from <br/>
watching it.  There were movies they liked parts of, but they weren&#39;t usually <br/>
sitting through a whole movie.  <br/>
<br/>
I still haven&#39;t really concentratedly watched all of The Lion King or Beauty <br/>
and the Beast--I wander in and out so some parts I&#39;ve seen ten times, and some <br/>
not yet.  Very same with my  kids and some movies.  And what they&#39;d tend to <br/>
walk out on is sex and violence.  They come back for kid and animal scenes, or <br/>
songs, which is what made Rocky Horror Picture Show an exception.  There was <br/>
cartoonish sex and violence, but some good songs.  When the music was boring or <br/>
gone, they&#39;d go back to legos or swings or Ninja Turtle figures or the dog or <br/>
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I mean afterall we don&#39;t come into the world knowing everything. Their <br/>
brains are still growing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are people who say we come into the world knowing nothing.  That belief <br/>
is called &quot;tabula rasa,&quot; meaning &quot;blank slate.&quot;  If you want to read more <br/>
about it, just put in in at google and there will be all kinds of claims one way <br/>
and another.  But the only way people believe it is to discount ALL of <br/>
instinct.  And they do!  I was taught in school in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s that humans have <br/>
no instincts, that all we learn has to come from books.   I mentioned this <br/>
derisively in the 1980&#39;s and a friend who was in college then said he&#39;s just <br/>
been taught that at school himself.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s one of the kernals of the book-worshipping culture which bites <br/>
unschoolers in the butt.  IF humans are blank slates, and if books are our <br/>
artificial replacement for instincts we don&#39;t have, then books are like parts of us, <br/>
parts of our culture without which we would be like birds that didn&#39;t know how <br/>
to build nests, or monkeys who had no idea of their social positions and so <br/>
would be chucked violently out of the nearest tree and killed.  TERRIBLE things <br/>
would happen if we didn&#39;t study hard and listen to our teachers, because we <br/>
had no instinct.<br/>
<br/>
Add to that Christianity&#39;s fear of evil, and the idea that Satan lurks to <br/>
tempt the weak, and let people steep in that for a few hundred years, and what <br/>
you get is parents who are afraid to step out of the lines.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If they are allowed from an early age to choose to sit and watch violence <br/>
or to just  do nothing day after day, what says we aren&#39;t damaging them?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This question can only come from someone who&#39;s never seen a kid free to <br/>
choose in a rich environment.   A serious question to bstamp@carolina...:  Have you <br/>
ever seen a kid &quot;just do nothing day after day&quot;?  Please respond to the list, <br/>
because I&#39;ll have questions.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If they sit watching people killed in movies or video games day after day&gt;&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
Why would a three year old sit watching violence?<br/>
What are his other choices?  DOES he have freedom of movement and choice?  <br/>
And if so, why do you think he wouldn&#39;t choose other things day after day?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I see the fear sometimes on my 9 year old after she watches the news. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why is she watching the news?<br/>
Are you watching it and modelling that it&#39;s important to do so?<br/>
Are you encouraging it?  Is it on in the kitchen or where she needs to be and <br/>
it&#39;s hard to get away from it?<br/>
<br/>
Because I&#39;ve had three nine year olds, and they never chose to watch the news.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But she will still watch and then become worried all the time about it <br/>
happening to her. Then this effects the way she acts in the time period following <br/>
making her afraid of the world. I noticed this actually when Elizabeth Smart <br/>
was found. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I read about it online and in magazines.  I didn&#39;t bring that story into my <br/>
house.  The older kids were vaguely aware from overhearing things.   <br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t let the OJ Simpson trial into the house either.  Not that the kids <br/>
couldn&#39;t have gone there if they&#39;d had an interest from things outside the <br/>
house, but neither my husband nor I cared, so most of what we heard was on comedy <br/>
routines.  EASILY the details are available later if someone wants to catch up<br/>
 on a story like that.<br/>

<br/>
Saturday the youngest kid at Holly&#39;s party wandered off by himself, and was <br/>
bored, and I pulled out some toys for him.  A bag of Power Rangers and vehicles <br/>
(some fast food toys from long ago), a suitcase with Fisher Price viewers and <br/>
animation cartridges (I don&#39;t know what those are called) and a plastic <br/>
shoebox with Mr. Potatohead stuff.<br/>
<br/>
He played with it all and it was scattered around the den and I thought that <br/>
was fine with me, and I&#39;d pick it up later, and organize it better when I did, <br/>
and put that cloth bag in the laundry because I think a cat peed on it long <br/>
ago...<br/>
<br/>
When the party was closing down, I saw that all that stuff had been packed <br/>
and stacked up.   Wow.  I was almost disappointed!! &lt;bwg&gt;  It was cool.  Marisa <br/>
Martinez had helped him (he&#39;s a once-removed relative of hers).  That was <br/>
unexpected (Dave and Nancy, if you&#39;re reading, that was great!)<br/>
<br/>
And a few weeks ago Holly and two friends made a big maze/ playhouse of <br/>
folding futons set up on their sides and chairs and sheets and blankets draped over <br/>
all that, and it was a whole room FULL of stuff.  I admired what they showed <br/>
me and went away figuring later I&#39;d help Holly clean it up.  Nope, they put it <br/>
all back.<br/>
<br/>
If I were holding the idea that **they better not leave that mess for ME, <br/>
grumble, darn it, I&#39;ll just tell them they can&#39;t get the stuff out at all** I <br/>
couldn&#39;t have been happily surprised by ANYthing.  I would resent it if it were <br/>
not clean, and feel just smug if it were.<br/>
<br/>
But by deciding that I would be willing to pick it up happily, I could be <br/>
happily NOT required to pick it up.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I really have been letting go little by little. Letting them eat if they <br/>
are hungry if they dont&#39; think they can hold out the extra 30 minutes till <br/>
dinner  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why not give them a bite or two of something so they never have to &quot;hold <br/>
out,&quot; not even thirty minutes?  It will make a difference in the peace and <br/>
happiness of all involved (except those who enjoy control, and they NEED to lose some <br/>
of the peace and happiness they&#39;re deriving from others&#39; discomfort).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But I  guess I don&#39;t understand the logic of them not having to clean up <br/>
such creations they make if it&#39;s in the center of our home.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to understand, but it&#39;s worth trying.<br/>
(And they way you&#39;ve phrased it isn&#39;t a match for the eventual thinking.  <br/>
&quot;Not having to clean up&quot; isn&#39;t the same as you will word it when/if you come to <br/>
understand the difference.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t understand the allowing of them to play violent video games. I&#39;m <br/>
against violence of all type and to me personally, violent movies and video <br/>
games glorifies it in their minds.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Playing a video game isn&#39;t violence. It&#39;s playing a game.<br/>
Preventing someone else&#39;s non-harmful behavior comes closer to violence than <br/>
sitting with a game controller on a couch in one&#39;s own living room comes.<br/>
<br/>
You start &quot;to me personally...&quot; and then go on to say what is happening in <br/>
someone else&#39;s mind.   Your idea about what happens in their minds isn&#39;t the <br/>
same as what DOES happen.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t believe everything you think.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My oldest has friends that play these games every free moment they get and <br/>
I do think that it can cause damage to one&#39;s mental thinking. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think that?<br/>
(and &quot;mental thinking&quot; is the only kind there is)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I might be wrong but this is one place I&#39;d rather take a chance on being <br/>
wrong then just hoping that it&#39;s doing no harm. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What might be the harmful thing is the limitations and the explanations which <br/>
turn out not to be true.    You are taking a chance.<br/>
<br/>
People who spank don&#39;t want to take the chance that by not spanking their <br/>
kids grow up to ... (whatever:  get pregnant, steal cars)   So they don&#39;t want to <br/>
&quot;take a chance,&quot; and they hit their kids as prevention against something <br/>
someone else told them might possibly be a result.<br/>
<br/>
How many levels removed from your actual children, in this actual moment, are <br/>
you willing to risk being so that you can comfortably accept vague advice <br/>
from people who&#39;ve never tried respecting kids?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
It&#39;s hard sometimes to express what one is really getting at. I just read a <br/>
lot on this list about no limits, but yet we do set limits for safety reasons <br/>
for infants and I&#39;m wondering why/when that necessarily  jsut changes.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It  never &quot;just changes.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341125170">&lt;&lt;If I were holding the idea that **they better not leave that mess for ME, <br/>
grumble, darn it, I&#39;ll just tell them they can&#39;t get the stuff out at all** I <br/>
couldn&#39;t have been happily surprised by ANYthing.  I would resent it if it were <br/>
not clean, and feel just smug if it were.<br/>
<br/>
But by deciding that I would be willing to pick it up happily, I could be <br/>
happily NOT required to pick it up.   Sandra&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had the same kind of experience last night.  Over the past couple of weeks (again!) my daughter has been spending most of the time in her room listening to her Harry Potter audiobooks.  What she loves is that she can do other things while she&#39;s listening.  So her room had become home to: our entire bead collection (she&#39;s been making wire jewelry - just figuring it out on her own, designing clasps etc.); all our playdoh stuff (we made a new batch and she took it upstairs); all the HP books & lots of paper (she has been looking up stuff and writing down her fave parts); some sort of potion she&#39;s making (cutting up bits of paper and putting them in a glass of water); tons of material, thread, stuffing, and needles (we visited a fabric store nearby and rummaged through the end of roll bin and she&#39;s been sewing up a storm - pillows, clothes for her stuffed animals, HP scarf etc.); lots of candy wrappers from Halloween; a collection of the pop cans she&#39;s worked her way though the past few days ... you get the picture!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she&#39;s been having a great time but as you can imagine, her room is pretty full of stuff by now!  Yesterday she had two spilling accidents from the crowded TV table beside her bed .. which we just wiped up and then went about our business.  And she noticed how hard it was for her to see her clock on her night table.<br/>
<br/>
So I was trying to get to sleep just after 10pm last night when I heard some repeated banging from her room and I got up to ask her to keep it down a bit.  Well the banging was from the broom she was wielding around her floor - while listening to an audiobook, of course!  And this morning I peeked in (she&#39;s still sleeping) and her room is all tidied up.  Without me mentioning it, or hounding her to do it, she just decided it was too messy for her, so she cleaned it up.  And she knows she can ask me to help, or to do it all for that matter if it&#39;s overwhelming for her, but she did it on her own.<br/>
<br/>
There is now a pile by the stairs of stuff that she doesn&#39;t want to keep in her room, and I&#39;ll happily carry that stuff down.  And it will be interesting to see what new stuff she decides to do when she gets up today!<br/>
<br/>
On a related side note, something I&#39;ve been thinking about lately.  One of the things I personally enjoy about unschooling is the freedom the kids have to be creative; not being told that there is a &quot;right&quot; way and a &quot;wrong&quot; way to do things.  My daughter loves to figure out ways to make/accomplish things (as you can see from above!).  A few weeks ago my kids were together with their cousins and my daughter suggested they make things with the fabric bits my Mom had laying around.  My niece (10) said she&#39;d like to make a ladybug, to go with the theme in her bedroom, and asked my daughter how to make one.  She replied, &quot;I don&#39;t know, just figure it out.  That&#39;s most of the fun!&quot;  Well, my niece was quite taken aback.  She&#39;s so used to being given directions on how to do things, that&#39;s there&#39;s a &quot;right way&quot; (i.e. the teacher&#39;s way), that open-ended, creative stuff is confusing and difficult - definitely not very fun.  Eventually my daughter gave her some ideas and she set about making her ladybug.  It really hit me that the kids at school are not learning how to analyze a situation and figure out a solution, just being taught what to think / do.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, just made a connection!  To the posts yesterday and today about kids just learning to follow the rules, not how to analyze a situation and make good decisions.  Extend it to kids just learning to follow instructions, not how to figure out a path for themselves.  I would bet that many school and school-at-home kids get easily frustrated in open-ended situations because they feel they have to figure out the path that their teacher / parent wants them to follow, not just a path that will work for them (I remember I hated that at school).  Put them in a situation where they have no rules or set of instructions to follow, and they will often be lost as to how to successfully get themselves out of it.<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like you&#39;ve mistakenly assumed that those of us who have no <br/>
limits have kids who do watch anything and everything. Even the wording <br/>
you&#39;ve used, &quot;sit in front of..&quot; is indicative of an attitude - do you <br/>
also use that wording when kids are reading? Would you ask us if we <br/>
condone kids sitting in front of a book all day long? My kids are not <br/>
just sitting there in front of the tv having something done to them. <br/>
They no more disengage their brains when they watch tv and movies then <br/>
they do when they read a book or watch a play or the opera or ballet or <br/>
anything else. Its a lie that watching tv is more passive than those <br/>
other things.<br/>
<br/>
My kids at 9 years old seldom, if ever, watched the &quot;news&quot; - not the <br/>
network or local news broadcasts. They don&#39;t have the ability to <br/>
discern that there are lots of awful things that happen every day and, <br/>
yet, are extremely unlikely to happen to them. Why is your 9 yo <br/>
daughter wanting to watch the news?<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that it was not her choice - that it was just &quot;on&quot; - some <br/>
adult in the family watching it - and so she watched. THAT is not a <br/>
responsible adult behavior - to watch that while young children are <br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
No limits on children&#39;s tv watching doesn&#39;t mean that adults should <br/>
stop behaving responsibly.<br/>
<br/>
Far from my kids watching anything and everything, they are <br/>
discriminating about what they choose to watch. Knowing that it is <br/>
their decision, they think about it. There is no sense of demanding to <br/>
be allowed to watch - because being &quot;allowed&quot; isn&#39;t an issue. My 18 yo <br/>
(19 in less than three weeks - sob, sob, sob they grow up TOO FAST) has <br/>
always been very careful about things that are too scary - still is. <br/>
Sees NO reason to frighten herself and will STILL go find something <br/>
else to do if people she&#39;s with are wanting to watch something that <br/>
might be scary. I can easily see how this self-awareness of her own low <br/>
tolerance level for scary stuff developed when she was little - she <br/>
made a few mistakes, but we were very respectful of her fears - always <br/>
described things carefully - told her honestly if we thought something <br/>
might have some scary bits - watched ahead of time and warned her - <br/>
fast forwarded through them - sometimes offered up substitute shows or <br/>
movies. I remember her saying, &quot;Mommy, I want to watch &quot;Jaws&quot; because <br/>
people refer to it and I haven&#39;t seen it, but will you sit close to <br/>
me?&quot; She was maybe 12 or so then.<br/>
<br/>
My 16 yo seems to like scary stuff. She isn&#39;t scared by it. She <br/>
analyzes it and is very very into the drama and theatrical aspects. I <br/>
think it is her analytical nature - doesn&#39;t let her get fully sucked in <br/>
and she never loses track of the fact that these are actors. She&#39;s <br/>
extremely interested in &quot;how&quot; things are done and &quot;why&quot; the director <br/>
chose what he/she did and what effects actors&#39; choices had on how the <br/>
show goes. She&#39;s a natural critic - and that attitude keeps her just a <br/>
bit disengaged.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest is careful, too, about what she watches. She is especially <br/>
careful about things that are TOO sad. So am I, by the way, for myself. <br/>
She sometimes chooses to wait to see movies when we can watch them on <br/>
TV instead of in a theater where they might be overwhelming or where <br/>
she can&#39;t easily escape if things get too intense.<br/>
<br/>
We also don&#39;t have the tv &quot;just on&quot; very often - and the tv is out in <br/>
the middle of the main room in the house and so we do all have to be be <br/>
considerate of each other. The hardest thing was probably for my dh who <br/>
wanted to watch things in the evenings that he didn&#39;t really want the <br/>
kids to watch - nothing awful, but just more adult shows like Hill <br/>
Street Blues (popular when we had little kids) which was somewhat <br/>
violent. The kids weren&#39;t asking to watch it &lt;G&gt; - they were into Mr. <br/>
Rogers and Sesame Street. There were MANY times that I took kids in the <br/>
other room to play a game or read or something else - so that my dh <br/>
could watch a show. There were also many times he just videotaped a <br/>
show and we watched later. Mostly we went along with what the kids <br/>
wanted to watch - lots of Raffi - and we all had a good time with that.<br/>
<br/>
As the kids got older, we didn&#39;t worry as much about what they watched <br/>
in terms of &quot;pretend&quot; tv - but still didn&#39;t typically have the &quot;news&quot; <br/>
on. We read the newspaper - we don&#39;t get our news from tv and, to be <br/>
honest, I don&#39;t need the visuals of all the nasty stuff that happens in <br/>
the world to be the wallpaper background in my brain either.<br/>
<br/>
If kids are WANTING to watch something that I find offensive or that I <br/>
have major reservations about them watching, I tend to watch with them <br/>
and engage in conversations that help me figure out what it is they are <br/>
after. Sometimes I can&#39;t figure it out - but I&#39;m still not forbidding <br/>
it - because I think the forbidding would have more negative impact on <br/>
our relationship than whatever it is they are watching.<br/>
<br/>
If kids are spending hours and hours in front of the tv in a <br/>
brain-not-engaged kind of way - I&#39;d take that as a giant hint that I&#39;m <br/>
not being responsible as a homeschooling parent for providing what they <br/>
need in their lives to engage their brains OR I&#39;d take it as a sign <br/>
that something is wrong in their life in some other way and I&#39;d work <br/>
hard on figuring that out.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s because their &quot;free moments&quot; are being limited. When all the<br/>
moments are &quot;free&quot; then there will be more variety in how they are<br/>
spent. My husband plays violent video games a lot. It is an opportunity<br/>
for catharsis. He is loud while playing, then calm and normal. Damage to<br/>
thinking occurs when a child is repeatedly made to feel afraid and<br/>
unsure - because of punishments or what they perceive as conditional<br/>
love. They are damaged by being made to feel that their choices are<br/>
wrong and stupid. They may have nowhere else to take their frustrations<br/>
than these games.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-907116909">The fires have been in the news and were covered ubiquitously here in<br/>
Los Angeles. The TV was on quite a lot, mostly I think because my<br/>
husband is fairly fascinated with how fires work, and a lot of the air<br/>
support technology. Jayn looked at some of it, but mostly would go do<br/>
something else when it was on. She also heard us discussing various<br/>
topics and joined in the conversations on: how to protect your home from<br/>
fire, what we would take if we were ever evacuated from this apartment<br/>
(really unlikely), fireproof safes, the bark beetle infestation, the<br/>
cool helicopters, the ash landing in our pool, the time we stayed in a<br/>
hotel with a wood burning stove, candles and fire, remembering times we<br/>
were burnt (while cooking or something), how we will have fire drills<br/>
when we move into our own home one day. She invented a new game for her<br/>
and I to play that I guess I would call &quot;Fire Rescue&quot; where I am a<br/>
firefighter who has to rescue her doll from a &quot;fire&quot; and then we both<br/>
use an imaginary hose (with sound fx) to put the fire out. I actually<br/>
think the game came more from watching a scene in Spiderman, than the<br/>
news, but I could be wrong. So far she has asked no questions, or<br/>
changed any of her behavior in such a way that would make me think she<br/>
might be worried or scared.<br/>

playing with toy guns when they were little always spoke about things that <br/>

I&#39;m getting annoyed, are you done playing with this, or will it fit somewhere <br/>
else?  <br/>
<br/>
       Leaving it there is logical because there&#39;s enough room for the <br/>
creation there and they might want to play with it later.  It&#39;s not logical to add <br/>
on the expectation that they should know it&#39;s annoying and they should know <br/>
that they should move it to avoid bothering you, for example.<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s they kind of stuff I was trained to &quot;know&quot; when I was a kid, and <br/>
it&#39;s anxiety inducing and inconsistent and crazy making.  Trust me, you don&#39;t <br/>
really want your kids to have *that* kind of logic!!  lol <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;but yet we do set limits for safety reasons for infants and I&#39;m wondering <br/>
why/when that necessarily jsut changes.  &gt;.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t magically change one day, it&#39;s gradual, and the parents see it <br/>
happening, and the child&#39;s world opens up a little more, and the parent is there <br/>
for the child if he/she needs it (safety).  <br/>
<br/>
Does a child who understands the concept for hot need to have a rule (limit) <br/>
for not touching the stove, or does it make more sense to show the child that <br/>
when the little knobs are turned that means the hot is &quot;on&quot;.  The latter is <br/>
informative and interactive, and the former is limiting and condescending to the <br/>
child.  <br/>
<br/>
I think many people are under the impression that no limits means no parental <br/>
interaction, but that&#39;s just not true or fair. It&#39;s about more parental <br/>
interaction, not less.  <br/>

<br/>
Sandra what  I get then is you do choose to shelter your kids. I never got that impression from you before. See I do shelter my kids from things like that which is why I asked all the questions in the first place. Most of what I asked was hypothetical but my dd watched the story about Elizabeth Smart because a neighbor called with the news she had been found and of course I was excited and turned it on. Yes I was right there in the room with her and we talked about it quite a bit with her to help her feel safe but that didn&#39;t seem to really help. The seeds of worry had been planted. <br/>
<br/>
No I don&#39;t know any 3 year olds that sit and watch horror movies personally, but I do know some 4 year olds (not mine) that will sit and watch as their older siblings play the shooting video games for very long periods of time.<br/>
<br/>
Yes I do watch the news. It is important to me to know what&#39;s going on in the world.  If she comes into the room I will turn it off but often she may have caught some of it before this happens. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I don&#39;t always understand what you ladies are saying. Must come from all those days in public school. From your response today I see things a little differently then I have from some of your other responses. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s always interesting here and I continue to learn. I will state though that our home is a very rich environment where children are free to pick and choose what they do. Hasn&#39;t stopped them from saying they are bored and that there&#39;s nothing to do but I will admit they have never sat for days and days doing nothing.  But certainly they can get unmotivated at times. I guess we all do.<br/>

  &lt;&lt; Most of us don&#39;t let our small babies play in danger zones of the house <br/>
  unsupervised. For eg. letting them stick a toy into an outlet. We protect them <br/>
  by either removing them or covering the outlet. We wouldn&#39;t let them crawl up <br/>
  and pull a pan of boiling water onto themselves because the consequences of <br/>
  that would be horrific.  We often gate the stairs if we think there is a chance <br/>
  that an active 6 month old might fall down them. We remove things from their <br/>
  level that might cause them harm. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m the same way with my adult friends, though.  If they&#39;re about to <br/>
  accidently do something dangerous (sit on scissors, walk on a wet floor, change a <br/>
  lightbulb without standing on something I know for sure to be safe) I&#39;ll quickly <br/>
  intervene and help make the situation safer.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;How do you know for sure that your 3 year old or 4 year old  or 10 year old <br/>
  really understands the dangers of certain situations?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not sure that my 14 and 17 year olds really understand the dangers of all <br/>
  situations, but I know they have a lot of experience with making respnsible <br/>
  decisions and with being analytical, because for 14 and 17 years I&#39;ve give them <br/>
  safe opportunities to practice.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;Sure it&#39;s easy to see physical damage but how do we know what phsycological <br/>
  damage is happening?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m with my kids a lot, and not just in the same house, but right beside <br/>
  them, watching what they&#39;re watching, answering their questions about what we all <br/>
  saw elsewhere, or about why another family is not like ours, or why the cat&#39;s <br/>
  walking funny or why the air smells like smoke.   We have, since they were <br/>
  little, helped them analyze the world around them, and one result is that we are <br/>
  near enough to feel their moods and responses in a more visceral way.   We <br/>
  don&#39;t wait for them to come and tell us they&#39;re uncomfortable about something.  <br/>
  We can tell by how close they sit, how long they stand around where other <br/>
  people are, by how they eat and sleep afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
  A moment of time out:  many people ignore entirely any instinct they have <br/>
  toward the interpersonal or intrapersonal skills they have.  Partly they&#39;ve been <br/>
  around too many rules and truisms about what should be and so they&#39;ve shoved <br/>
  aside their perceptions of what is.  And none of that &quot;counts in school.&quot;  When <br/>
  a kid is good at interpersonals, they&#39;re criticized for talking too much and <br/>
  for not leaving the other kids alone to take care of their own problems <br/>
  themselves.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;How do you know that the psychological damage of certain choices couldn&#39;t <br/>
  be just as bad to them. Eg. if we just let them sit from the age of 18 months <br/>
  or  even 5 years in front of a t.v. watching shows full of violence or sex <br/>
  etc.?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve had three eighteen month olds, and three five year olds.    Not once did <br/>
  they say &quot;OOOH!  Violence and sex.&quot;  And they rarely if ever &quot;sat in front of <br/>
  a T.V.&quot; in the way I&#39;m guessing you mean.  If there was a TV on, they were <br/>
  never required to &quot;SIT.&quot;  Holly surprised me when she was five by sitting down <br/>
  to watch part of Twelfth Night (Helena Bonham Carter version) with a little <br/>
  girl from across the street.  I expected them to watch a bit and wander off.  <br/>
  They watched all the rest of it.  I neither made them nor forbid them from <br/>
  watching it.  There were movies they liked parts of, but they weren&#39;t usually <br/>
  sitting through a whole movie.  <br/>
<br/>
  I still haven&#39;t really concentratedly watched all of The Lion King or Beauty <br/>
  and the Beast--I wander in and out so some parts I&#39;ve seen ten times, and some <br/>
  not yet.  Very same with my  kids and some movies.  And what they&#39;d tend to <br/>
  walk out on is sex and violence.  They come back for kid and animal scenes, or <br/>
  songs, which is what made Rocky Horror Picture Show an exception.  There was <br/>
  cartoonish sex and violence, but some good songs.  When the music was boring or <br/>
  gone, they&#39;d go back to legos or swings or Ninja Turtle figures or the dog or <br/>
  whatever.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;I mean afterall we don&#39;t come into the world knowing everything. Their <br/>
  brains are still growing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  There are people who say we come into the world knowing nothing.  That belief <br/>
  is called &quot;tabula rasa,&quot; meaning &quot;blank slate.&quot;  If you want to read more <br/>
  about it, just put in in at google and there will be all kinds of claims one way <br/>
  and another.  But the only way people believe it is to discount ALL of <br/>
  instinct.  And they do!  I was taught in school in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s that humans have <br/>
  no instincts, that all we learn has to come from books.   I mentioned this <br/>
  derisively in the 1980&#39;s and a friend who was in college then said he&#39;s just <br/>
  been taught that at school himself.<br/>
<br/>
  So that&#39;s one of the kernals of the book-worshipping culture which bites <br/>
  unschoolers in the butt.  IF humans are blank slates, and if books are our <br/>
  artificial replacement for instincts we don&#39;t have, then books are like parts of us, <br/>
  parts of our culture without which we would be like birds that didn&#39;t know how <br/>
  to build nests, or monkeys who had no idea of their social positions and so <br/>
  would be chucked violently out of the nearest tree and killed.  TERRIBLE things <br/>
  would happen if we didn&#39;t study hard and listen to our teachers, because we <br/>
  had no instinct.<br/>
<br/>
  Add to that Christianity&#39;s fear of evil, and the idea that Satan lurks to <br/>
  tempt the weak, and let people steep in that for a few hundred years, and what <br/>
  you get is parents who are afraid to step out of the lines.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;If they are allowed from an early age to choose to sit and watch violence <br/>
  or to just  do nothing day after day, what says we aren&#39;t damaging them?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  This question can only come from someone who&#39;s never seen a kid free to <br/>
  choose in a rich environment.   A serious question to bstamp@carolina...:  Have you <br/>
  ever seen a kid &quot;just do nothing day after day&quot;?  Please respond to the list, <br/>
  because I&#39;ll have questions.  <br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;If they sit watching people killed in movies or video games day after day&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
  Why would a three year old sit watching violence?<br/>
  What are his other choices?  DOES he have freedom of movement and choice?  <br/>
  And if so, why do you think he wouldn&#39;t choose other things day after day?<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;I see the fear sometimes on my 9 year old after she watches the news. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Why is she watching the news?<br/>
  Are you watching it and modelling that it&#39;s important to do so?<br/>
  Are you encouraging it?  Is it on in the kitchen or where she needs to be and <br/>
  it&#39;s hard to get away from it?<br/>
<br/>
  Because I&#39;ve had three nine year olds, and they never chose to watch the news.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;But she will still watch and then become worried all the time about it <br/>
  happening to her. Then this effects the way she acts in the time period following <br/>
  making her afraid of the world. I noticed this actually when Elizabeth Smart <br/>
  was found. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I read about it online and in magazines.  I didn&#39;t bring that story into my <br/>
  house.  The older kids were vaguely aware from overhearing things.   <br/>
<br/>
  We didn&#39;t let the OJ Simpson trial into the house either.  Not that the kids <br/>
  couldn&#39;t have gone there if they&#39;d had an interest from things outside the <br/>
  house, but neither my husband nor I cared, so most of what we heard was on comedy <br/>
  routines.  EASILY the details are available later if someone wants to catch up<br/>
  on a story like that.<br/>

<br/>
Same here. Conor (14) watches CNN and MTV News sometimes lately. <br/>
He&#39;ll give me updates on the fires in CA or the situation with the <br/>
feeding tube in FL. I think he usually checks out the TV news if he&#39;s <br/>
heard or seen a story about something that he wants more detail <br/>
about. We&#39;ve had some really interesting discussions about ethics, <br/>
forest management and Eminem. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We lived in Utah during the Elizabeth Smart kidnapping. My kids found <br/>
out about it because there were flyers and billboards everywhere. <br/>
Because of that, they needed discussion and reassurance. Like Sandra <br/>
though, I don&#39;t invite news like that into my home. Just because the <br/>
TV is there, doesn&#39;t mean I have to watch every channel or every <br/>
show. I&#39;ve found that my kids didn&#39;t want to see the dark and <br/>
frightening stuff. <br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t even watch the news on 9/11!! I flipped it on when I found <br/>
out and then would check in private at short intervals during the <br/>
day. The kids knew I was terribly shaken and we talked about what was <br/>
going on. I saw no reason to have those visuals coming in too. I <br/>
didn&#39;t forbid them, I just didn&#39;t turn it on and they didn&#39;t ask. My <br/>
kids make good choices about their well being for the most part.<br/>

&gt;  jsut changes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I aim for the &quot;least restrictive environment&quot; because I think it is the <br/>
most conducive to exploring and thinking and pondering and <br/>
experimenting and, thereby, real learning. I don&#39;t neglect my kids&#39; <br/>
safety - I protect it in the least restrictive way I can figure out. <br/>
AND - I keep a long-term focus so, whenever possible, I opt for less <br/>
protection now if I think protecting them now might interfere with them <br/>
developing their own internal self-protection mechanisms.<br/>
<br/>
Its an attitude that permeated our relationship from the time they were <br/>
babies. In each situation I tried not to confine them, for example, any <br/>
more than was truly absolutely necessary. I tried not to get into too <br/>
many situations where it would be necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to look at it is that I try to do everything IN my power to <br/>
set things up so that I don&#39;t exert that power over the kids. I know <br/>
that this is the opposite of what a lot of child-rearing experts say, <br/>
today. They talk about not being afraid to be the parent and not <br/>
letting kids get away with anything and so on. This is all a response <br/>
to the supposedly overly-lenient irresponsible parenting that led to my <br/>
generation (I&#39;m 50-something) being such self-centered lazy <br/>
good-for-nothings &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
But - I&#39;m not &quot;lenient&quot; - I&#39;m very demanding, in fact. I have very high <br/>
expectations of my kids in terms of behavior - generosity, kindness, <br/>
honesty, individual search for truth, openmindedness, appreciation of <br/>
diversity, etc. Everything we do is gist for an examination of how it <br/>
demonstrates our &quot;character.&quot; And books and tv and movies and plays are <br/>
the primary source material for that kind of constant evaluation. Far <br/>
from my kids thinking that what they watch on tv is somehow &quot;normal&quot; <br/>
and expected and far from them emulating whatever they happen to be <br/>
watching, they are examining life decisions and coming to their own <br/>
decisions. I have NO fear, for example, that my 12 yo watching Cheers <br/>
reruns is in danger of thinking that hanging out in bars is the best <br/>
way to develop an interesting social group. Why not? Well - because we <br/>
talk about alcohol and what it really does to people and why they drink <br/>
and why it feels good and what it does to people&#39;s brains (physically) <br/>
and when it is a problem and what AA is all about and what its like to <br/>
be the child of an alcoholic or the friend of someone who drinks on a <br/>
daily basis and so on and on. We talk about these things when they come <br/>
up in natural everyday conversations.<br/>
<br/>
I really really loved Ben Lovejoy&#39;s topic at the Live and Learn <br/>
conference - principles versus rules. That really described how I&#39;ve <br/>
tried to raise my children based on general principles - &quot;We try to be <br/>
considerate of each other&quot; as opposed to rules &quot;No watching tv after 10 <br/>
pm.&quot; Principles always make sense - rules can be nonsensical if <br/>
situations change. Principles invite people to be creative in getting <br/>
what they want while still living up to them while rules invite people <br/>
to bend or break them to get what they want.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sandra what  I get then is you do choose to shelter your kids. I never got <br/>
&gt;that impression from you before.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I got the impression that she was sheltering herself more than the kids by <br/>
not watching TV news. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;See I do shelter my kids from things like that which is why I asked all <br/>
&gt;the questions in the first place. Most of what I asked was hypothetical <br/>
&gt;but my dd watched the story about Elizabeth Smart because a neighbor <br/>
&gt;called with the news she had been found and of course I was excited and <br/>
&gt;turned it on. Yes I was right there in the room with her and we talked <br/>
&gt;about it quite a bit with her to help her feel safe but that didn&#39;t seem <br/>
&gt;to really help. The seeds of worry had been planted.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Once she&#39;d seen a bit of it, probably the best thing you could have done <br/>
was let her watch more, or get her more info about the relative infrequency <br/>
of stranger abductions (which it turns out the Elizabeth Smart case <br/>
wasn&#39;t). Maybe you could explore the statistics with her, so she doesn&#39;t <br/>
think that the TV spin is reality.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;No I don&#39;t know any 3 year olds that sit and watch horror movies <br/>
&gt;personally, but I do know some 4 year olds (not mine) that will sit and <br/>
&gt;watch as their older siblings play the shooting video games for very long <br/>
&gt;periods of time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do those 4 year olds have a lot of other interesting things to do? Do they <br/>
have parents who interact with them a lot? Are *they* not allowed to play <br/>
and so can only watch?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Yes I do watch the news. It is important to me to know what&#39;s going on in <br/>
&gt;the world.  If she comes into the room I will turn it off but often she <br/>
&gt;may have caught some of it before this happens.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The main reason I don&#39;t watch the news is because it makes people afraid. I <br/>
don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve told this here or not. If I have, most of you can stop <br/>
reading. When my mother was still alive, my son and I would go down and <br/>
visit her once a year for a week. She always watched the news for about an <br/>
hour and a half every day. Her apartment wasn&#39;t big enough to get away from <br/>
it, so I listened. What I gradually noticed was that the news stations <br/>
seemed to have a quota for violence and tragedy. If there was enough in the <br/>
local area, those were the featured stories. But if there wasn&#39;t enough <br/>
there, the stations would feed in stories from elsewhere. It&#39;s very subtle. <br/>
Probably the only reason I noticed it was the fact that I was only <br/>
subjected to it for one week every year. No wonder so many people are <br/>
fearful and convinced that violent crime is increasing when in fact it&#39;s <br/>
decreasing.<br/>
<br/>
I do want to know what&#39;s going on in the world, so I read the paper and <br/>
check the internet news sources, both mainstream and alternative. The thing <br/>
I prefer about reading the news rather than watching it is that *I* get to <br/>
decide what I&#39;ll take in. I can just skim the headlines of the horrific <br/>
stuff. I don&#39;t have to take in all the details.<br/>

you, in effect, coerced a child into watching something inappropriate.  <br/>
I&#39;m not saying this to criticize, but because you seem to sense there <br/>
is a difference between that and what we&#39;re talking about and so I&#39;m <br/>
trying to make it clear for you.<br/>
<br/>
I KNOW, you didn&#39;t tie her down and make her watch. But your neighbor <br/>
called and made a big deal about it and you acted like it was so <br/>
exciting that you had to watch it right that minute and you didn&#39;t wait <br/>
to find a time when your little girl was busy with something else.<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;re talking about is the exact opposite of that - it is being <br/>
far more in tune with your own children. In fact, even if my little <br/>
girl had come running in saying, &quot;They found that girl and I want to <br/>
watch it on TV&quot; then we&#39;d watch and I&#39;d talk to her and so on, but we&#39;d <br/>
probably watch just a bit - and I&#39;d flip around and try to find the <br/>
parts where they showed her happy parents and avoid the parts where <br/>
they speculated about what had been done to her, etc.<br/>
<br/>
No limits means we don&#39;t have rules that say, for example, &quot;You may <br/>
watch 1 hour of tv, only between the hours of 5 and 8 pm, and only if <br/>
you&#39;ve done your schoolwork and chores and only these specific shows.&quot;<br/>

- what would happen if you suddenly stopped enforcing the rules or <br/>
limits. That&#39;s different than what we&#39;re talking about. Maybe if you <br/>
spend time thinking in that direction it&#39;ll be useful to you -- instead <br/>
of thinking about what we do NOT do (don&#39;t have rules or limits) - put <br/>
your focus on what people here are saying they DO instead.<br/>
<br/>
That is harder because we&#39;re all so different - our children are <br/>
different and our family situations are different and so on -- but <br/>
maybe if you do focus on what we say we DO instead of what we do not <br/>
do, you can come up with some general principles that you can then try <br/>
out in your OWN way in your own home with your own unique children.<br/>
<br/>
If you think about what you can DO instead of having rules and limits, <br/>
you might just suddenly discover yourself saying, &quot;Hmmm, we don&#39;t find <br/>
that we have any need for rules or limits on tv watching.&quot; And, you <br/>
might find that it is hard to explain exactly why - but it&#39;ll be the <br/>
truth and you&#39;ll know that it is a good thing.<br/>

No I didn&#39;t. I made a mistake in doing so and I felt badly for it.  I&#39;m assuming we&#39;ve all made a few of those at least those of us who are still learning about being a parent(even after 15 years).<br/>

Actually I&#39;m glad I posted this even if I am being made to feel like the &quot;stupid&quot; kid in school because I&#39;ve learned that you all do impose limits when you think they are necessary and up until this topic I never got that impression.<br/>

  &gt; Most of what I asked was hypothetical but my dd watched the story <br/>
  &gt; about Elizabeth Smart because a neighbor called with the news she had <br/>
  &gt; been found and of course I was excited and turned it on. Yes I was <br/>
  &gt; right there in the room with her and we talked about it quite a bit <br/>
  &gt; with her to help her feel safe but that didn&#39;t seem to really help. <br/>
  &gt; The seeds of worry had been planted.<br/>
<br/>
  So - in fact, you did the OPPOSITE of what people here try to promote - <br/>
  you, in effect, coerced a child into watching something inappropriate.  <br/>
  I&#39;m not saying this to criticize, but because you seem to sense there <br/>
  is a difference between that and what we&#39;re talking about and so I&#39;m <br/>
  trying to make it clear for you.<br/>
<br/>
  I KNOW, you didn&#39;t tie her down and make her watch. But your neighbor <br/>

<br/>
  What we&#39;re talking about is the exact opposite of that - it is being <br/>
  far more in tune with your own children. In fact, even if my little <br/>
  girl had come running in saying, &quot;They found that girl and I want to <br/>
  watch it on TV&quot; then we&#39;d watch and I&#39;d talk to her and so on, but we&#39;d <br/>
  probably watch just a bit - and I&#39;d flip around and try to find the <br/>
  parts where they showed her happy parents and avoid the parts where <br/>
  they speculated about what had been done to her, etc.<br/>
<br/>
  No limits means we don&#39;t have rules that say, for example, &quot;You may <br/>
  watch 1 hour of tv, only between the hours of 5 and 8 pm, and only if <br/>
  you&#39;ve done your schoolwork and chores and only these specific shows.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-568734957">We&#39;ve all made mistakes - and I used it as an example because clearly <br/>
you felt it was a mistake. And as I said I didn&#39;t point it out to <br/>
embarrass or criticize you but ONLY because you seem sincere in trying <br/>
to figure out what people really mean when they say &quot;no limits.&quot; To go <br/>
along with the &quot;no limits&quot; you&#39;d have to ALSO add in what the parents <br/>
do -- and one thing would be limiting our OWN watching tv news when <br/>
little kids are around, if they are made nervous by it.  I figured <br/>
you&#39;d realized that - so am using it as an example of something we&#39;d DO <br/>
as opposed to just not having rules.<br/>
<br/>
Mistakes are okay - they&#39;re good if they mean we&#39;re trying out needed <br/>
changes in our lives. I mean - assuming we don&#39;t keep repeating <br/>
mistakes for too long - that we eventually learn from them. Kids are <br/>
remarkably able to withstand ineptness in their parents - and even to <br/>
learn from OUR mistakes. And they totally understand that we&#39;re <br/>
learning too - they are great about not expecting us to be perfect. <br/>
Thank goodness. Your daughter probably learned to be more careful, <br/>
herself, about what she watches on tv and you could apologize to her <br/>
for not realizing that it would be something that would later bother <br/>
her and having it on while she was there. She&#39;d learn some good stuff <br/>
from that too.<br/>
<br/>
And so on --  I mean - none of these are &quot;rules&quot; - try principled <br/>
conscious hopeful loving living in place of rules. Things become <br/>
ambiguous and more complicated and harder to figure out - but worth it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238321667">We don&#39;t have rules and regulations about tv and video watching. We have<br/>
cable and the children are free to watch whatever it is they want to watch.<br/>
That includes the news.<br/>
<br/>
I have never found any of them watching anything that may have made me feel<br/>
a bit uncomfortable about what they were seeing. My younger three find the<br/>
news very boring and not worth even a second of their time. My oldest finds<br/>
it depressing and doesn&#39;t watch either. And we do watch news here and I have<br/>
never not allowed a certain news broadcast to come into the house. If my<br/>
kids watched and became upset about it, I&#39;m sure that would change. Or at<br/>
least how we approached it would.<br/>
<br/>
The times that the younger 3 have watched something from beginning to end is<br/>
very rare. Even movies we all get to watch together, Joseph and Alyssa will<br/>
leave at times to do other things. Sierra is a watcher and enjoys certain<br/>
movies and TV programs. Joseph is the least interested in tv. Joseph also<br/>
doesn&#39;t like scary things, so if he comes into a room while we are watching<br/>
something like that, we will warn him. He always choses not to watch. He<br/>
just doesn&#39;t like them.<br/>
<br/>
There are only two times I can remember changing the channel when watching<br/>
something and one of the kids came into the room. One was the show Real Sex<br/>
and the other was Nip/Tuck. Didn&#39;t make a big deal out of it, just changed<br/>
the channel to answer a question and then put it back on.<br/>
<br/>
Once, I told Joseph about a show that was on here. I thought it might<br/>
interest him. It was supposed to be about dinosaurs and people living among<br/>
them. So he put on the channel and when I came back in the room, it was<br/>
changed. He told me it was real stupid with women running around naked and<br/>
guys chasing them instead of worrying about the dinosaurs!!! He had no<br/>
interest at all in that. I&#39;m sure the day will come when he will, but so<br/>
what. We&#39;ll all watch and talk about it just like we do about anything new<br/>
and interesting for them. And if he wants to watch it alone, I have no doubt<br/>
he&#39;ll ask us about that stuff too.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my kids aren&#39;t the kind of kids that get all caught up in tv and<br/>
zoming out on it. Maybe my kids just have a lot of really neat things to do<br/>
so tv isn&#39;t the best of their choices most of the time. I wouldn&#39;t really<br/>
know as these are the only kids I have and I&#39;m not about to make a boring<br/>
household to see what would happen!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026525735"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Its an attitude that permeated our relationship from the time they <br/>
 </span></blockquote>were babies. In each situation I tried not to confine them, for <br/>
example, any more than was truly absolutely necessary. I tried not to <br/>
get into too many situations where it would be necessary.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU for writing was I was thinking Pam. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were toddlers, I baby-proofed my home completely so that <br/>
they were free to explore their world without me having to hover or <br/>
constantly tell them no. As they got older, they got access to  more <br/>
things. If they&#39;d see or ask for something that they might break or <br/>
might be dangerous to them, I&#39;d show it to them with me right there <br/>
guiding the process as they learned what this new object was.<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;re doing now is just a continuation of that baby-proofing. I <br/>
don&#39;t put dangerous or spirit-breaking stuff deliberately in their <br/>
path. BUT, if they&#39;re aware of something that&#39;s out there and they <br/>
want to explore more, I&#39;ll be right in there talking and guiding and <br/>
parenting as they do.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Another way to look at it is that I try to do everything IN my <br/>
 </span></blockquote>power to set things up so that I don&#39;t exert that power over the <br/>
kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Nope. No one here is making you feel anything. You&#39;re imposing that <br/>
latent school crap on yourself. People here are willingly answering <br/>
your questions because we want to help you understand what we have <br/>
found so helpful in our own lives. What is it that someone here <br/>
called mistakes? Learning-takes? And you didn&#39;t even make a mistake <br/>
really. You misunderstood, we&#39;re explaining. It&#39;s all good.<br/>

For me it&#39;s still not about imposing limits. It&#39;s about creating a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316766879">Well I disagree just  a little bit. When someone makes a written expression mistake as I did....ie. I  said &quot;mental thinking&quot; instead of just &quot;thinking&quot; and I&#39;m corrected on my error it tends to lead to the &quot;stupid student&quot; feeling that I received in school.  Yes probably left over pent up feelings from school no doubt.<br/>
