&gt; I had a performance tonight (Saturday) with my group GaiaWolf.  It&#39;s more<br/>
&gt; of a mixed bag of genres from world music to R&B to reggae to contemporary<br/>
&gt; acoustic.  GaiaWolf&#39;s mission has to do with promoting universal harmony<br/>
&gt; amongst species, so to that end we sing about wolves in Yellowstone, how<br/>
&gt; drought in the Serengeti affects the elephants who live there, peace, the<br/>
&gt; manatee, pilot whales, starting over, what the Statue of Liberty might say<br/>
&gt; if she could talk and tell us what she&#39;s been seeing, and on and on.  If<br/>
&gt; you&#39;d like to hear some of the music we do, you can listen for free at<br/>

&gt; most favorite tune on there is Abby, Stay.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds really cool.  I&#39;m going to have a look and listen.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; What&#39;s your instrument, Tia?  Do you perform often?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I play French horn.  One orchestra I&#39;m in gives 4 concerts a year.  Another<br/>
one gives a big concert in June and 3 chamber concerts during the spring.<br/>
This year I&#39;m going to be in all of those.  They&#39;re also doing a Christmas<br/>
concert, but I&#39;m not in that one.  The concert Friday night was with a<br/>
chamber orchestra that&#39;s usually just strings.  We did a Mozart divertimento<br/>
for 2 horns and strings.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do with Gaia Wolf?  Play something?  Sing?<br/>
