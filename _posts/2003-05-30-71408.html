&lt;&lt; Your kid should get together with my kids.. They can REALLY let the <br/>
language <br/>
fly. LOL.  But,  I have not lost any friends over it.  Mostly because my kids <br/>
only use  foul language around thier immediate family.  I think they curb <br/>
thier language in public because of going to school and getting conditioned <br/>
that <br/>
bad language is not acceptable.   Anybody who is that offended by a kids <br/>
language is pretty shallow, if you ask me.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because mine have always been able to at home, they don&#39;t seem to feel the <br/>
need to do it away.  From when they were little, we reminded them there are <br/>
times and places for things, and that grandma&#39;s wasn&#39;t the place to even say <br/>
&quot;poop&quot; if they could remember to avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
At the gaming shop there&#39;s a 25 cent fine or push-ups for swear words other <br/>
than &quot;crap&quot; (I think it is--there&#39;s one word they can say, and it&#39;s not &quot;a <br/>
swear word&quot;).  Marty says he&#39;s had to pay a few quarters over it, but not many.  <br/>
(He mentioned this because they&#39;re going to have a ten pushups per bad word <br/>
rule at the junior police academy.)   Holly says that she&#39;s impressed that when <br/>
Kirby&#39;s running a kid&#39;s tournament, Pokemon or YuGiOh or whatever, that he <br/>
speaks very gently and never says bad words.<br/>
<br/>
What I told mine is that I don&#39;t mind the words, but some people do, and so <br/>
they should be careful because deciding to use them all the time will cost them <br/>
socially with some people.<br/>
<br/>
So mine were conditioned without school. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was having an exchange with another mom I&#39;ve known since she was young and <br/>
single.  She&#39;s homeschooling and has a mid-age-kid (13?) and a toddler.  I was <br/>
recommending she watch Eddie Izzard&#39;s &quot;Dress to Kill,&quot; but then I remembered <br/>
&quot;the language,&quot; and we discussed that.  They don&#39;t shelter their kids from <br/>
&quot;the f-word&quot; either.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids would know MUCH less than they know about things which have nothing <br/>
whatsoever to do with sex or meanness if I were to ban anything with bad <br/>
language.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322416665">Choosing the style of language we use, to fit the circumstances, is a <br/>
way of showing respect to the people around us.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told my kids:<br/>
Knowingly doing something that you are aware feels insulting to certain <br/>
people IS insulting those people.<br/>
Sometimes it is worth it, to make a point or for shock value to wake <br/>
them up or for other reasons, I&#39;m sure. But, to just casually, for no <br/>
good reason, use language that you know is unsettling to someone else <br/>
is discourteous and uncaring. Doing anything that makes another person <br/>
uncomfortable or feel insulted should be done only for a good reason. <br/>
So what if it is &quot;their problem?&quot; If we have the ability, simply by <br/>
avoiding the use of certain words when they might be unappreciated, to <br/>
create more harmonious social situations and avoid offense, why not do <br/>
it?<br/>

Bryn never swears, he doesn&#39;t like it and Heather does when she and I argue. But then so do I.<br/>

anyway. Sigh.<br/>
I have explained to him that it affects me and sometimes he&#39;ll agree and say he will stop but then the beserk rage descends and all rationality is lost. Red hair I think ;-)<br/>

they come across kissing etc in films they all hide and ask me to tell them when its finished :-)<br/>
We&#39;re off to see The Matrix Reloaded next week and I&#39;ve been told there&#39;s a bit of bed activity at one point. No doubt my brood will be loudly saying &#39;yuck, thats gross&#39; etc etc in the cinema.<br/>

For me that would be the problem. It&#39;s that he&#39;s using his words to <br/>
hurt someone else by name calling. My kid could be saying &quot;poopy <br/>
head&quot; and I&#39;d still stop and talk to him about it. <br/>
<br/>
I make a BIG distiction about what society considers &quot;bad&quot; words and <br/>
what I do. My definition of &quot;bad&quot; is words that are intended to hurt, <br/>
be they colorful, shocking or the plain old boring variety. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not words, it&#39;s the intent. Remember the above words (&#39;f***** <br/>
b*****&#39;) could be used in a fairly innocent sentence about one&#39;s <br/>
female dog copulating with the neighbor&#39;s studly mutt. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Same with gender distinctions. My two boys sometimes want to plunder my <br/>
make-up case so I have a stash of stuff for them. Up until recently <br/>
Evan would ask for lipstick when I was applying mine before going out <br/>
and would proudly wear it to the playground. I never said no because, <br/>
really, even the studliest of actors has to wear makeup at some point.<br/>
