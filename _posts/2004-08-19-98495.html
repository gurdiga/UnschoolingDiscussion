What about seed intended for wild birds?  We just bought 50 lbs or so at <br/>
Costco for $8 or so, and I did stick my hand in and it felt great!  It could also <br/>
be used for sorting.  You could plant some later and see what grows, and sweep <br/>
the rest up and put it in a bird feeder, or throw it out for pigeons <br/>
somewhere.<br/>

Here&#39;s the bit on birds and rice:<br/>
==========<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.snopes.com/weddings/horrors/birdrice.htm">http://www.snopes.com/weddings/horrors/birdrice.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Claim:   Rice thrown to wish newly-wedded couples well can kill their fine<br/>
feathered friends. <br/>
<br/>
Status:   False. <br/>
<br/>
Origins:   We&#39;re  cautioned not to throw rice at the bride and groom,<br/>
because the grain will prove harmful to the birds who swoop down   to eat<br/>
it. The rice expands in those little birdy stomachs, causing our avian<br/>
companions to explode, we&#39;re warned. Let&#39;s quit worrying about the birds.<br/>
They&#39;ll be fine. Seagulls don&#39;t explode when they eat Alka-Seltzer; pigeons<br/>
don&#39;t explode when they eat rice.<br/>
<br/>
This response to a 1996 Ann Landers column in which she &quot;informed&quot; readers<br/>
about the danger rice poses to birds just about says it all:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The USA Rice Federation in Houston has a message for advice columnist Ann<br/>
Landers - straighten up and fly right when you talk about birds. In a recent<br/>
column, Landers warned readers that throwing rice at weddings is  unhealthy<br/>
for our feathered friends: &quot;Please encourage the guests to throw rose petals<br/>
instead of rice. Rice is not good for the birds.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This silly myth pops up periodically, and it is absolutely unfounded,&quot;<br/>
responded rice expert Mary Jo Cheesman at the USA Rice Federation. Many<br/>
migrating ducks and geese depend on winter-flooded rice fields each year to<br/>
fatten up and build strength for their return trek to northern nesting<br/>
grounds. <br/>
<br/>
Uncooked, milled rice is no more harmful to birds than rice in the field,<br/>
Cheesman said. The Curator of Ornithology at the University of California at<br/>
Berkeley agrees. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s a myth. There is no reason why birds, including small songbirds, can&#39;t<br/>
eat rice,&quot; said Ned Johnson, a professor of biology at Berkeley who lectures<br/>
frequently on the food and feeding of birds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many churchs and reception halls have rules prohibiting the throwing of<br/>
confetti or rice. These rules work to keep the property clean so that the<br/>
next happy couple doesn&#39;t get its send-off amid the leavings of the previous<br/>
pair. Confetti is notoriously hard to clean up; not even vacuuming a lawn<br/>
will return the grass to its pristine condition.<br/>
<br/>
Rice poses a unique danger. Not to birds, though; to people. Scattered on a<br/>
hard surface (such as the steps of a church or a dance floor) it puts anyone<br/>
who walks across that surface at risk of taking a nasty spill. Far better to<br/>
prohibit rice throwing at a wedding than to end up with an injured guest.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t do it for the birds, do it for the inlaws.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s important for unschooling parents not to report things or <br/>
believe things without really looking at them and thinking about them, and maybe <br/>
double-checking.   <br/>
<br/>
Kids at school are given textbook, watered-down versions of truth.<br/>
<br/>
I worry that some homeschooled kids are being given tidbits of nonsense their <br/>
moms overheard or learned in e-mail and didn&#39;t really think about and just <br/>
passed on as &quot;they say.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;They say&quot; coke will dissolve a nail, but why repeat it?  Stick a nail in <br/>
some coke and see if it&#39;s true or not.  (Or just think about it, with all the <br/>
information you have in you about what coke does or doesn&#39;t do. Does it dissolve <br/>
a plastic bottle?  An aluminum can?)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They say&quot; rice will blow up in a bird&#39;s stomach?    Did people invent rice <br/>
and birds?  What protected birds from eating rice before people were around, or <br/>
out in the wild, do forest rangers put netting over all rice?  In Japan are <br/>
there blown-up birds littering the ground?  For the hundred(s?) of years that <br/>
throwing rice at weddings was common, are there any stories of sweet little <br/>
flower girls bursting into tears after sparrows blew up around her during the <br/>
reception?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really okay to use our own powers of reason.<br/>
It&#39;s better than okay, for unschoolers.  It&#39;s crucial.<br/>
