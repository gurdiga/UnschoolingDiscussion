I know this is off-topic, but if I were in this dad&#39;s position, I would want<br/>
to get the word out any way possible.<br/>

<br/>
Please keep an eye out for this missing homeschooled teenage boy. He is<br/>
possibly in Oregon or California. Last known destination was Portland<br/>
Oregon. He does not know Oregon, but does know Northern California. Much<br/>
of our family lives in Northern in California. Also if any of you<br/>
running web sites could post a link to this URL it would be greatly<br/>
appreciated. Mike has never run away before and is not street wise. He<br/>
has lived a somewhat sheltered life. We do not know why he ran away, he<br/>
told his girlfriend it was not about his family or her. His family and<br/>
friends are very worried about him.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
Mike&#39;s Dad<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434432996">I thought for a while about whether to let this announcement through to the <br/>
list, but after I read the dad&#39;s website, I thought I should.<br/>
<br/>
This information can help people understand unschooling better, I think, or <br/>
at least to appreciate the value of the kind of parenting we have long promoted <br/>
on this list, even in the face of criticism and rejection.<br/>
<br/>
On a day when this boy is missing, I was saying yes to Marty who wanted to go <br/>
and do something at 7:00 in the morning (I could have said no, but I said yes <br/>
because it wasn&#39;t going to hurt anyone for him to stand in line for 18 hours <br/>
to try to get an XBox 360).    On a day when a 16 year old who has been <br/>
sheltered has run away, my 19 year old who has enjoyed huge amounts of freedom chose <br/>
to sit down (in the restaurant where he&#39;s employed) after his shift ended <br/>
with me, his sister, and another unschooling family and talk for nearly an hour, <br/>
even though there were cooler people, and friends his age, in the restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
Children cannot choose to be with their families if they have no choice.<br/>
<br/>
The relationships parents have with their children ARE important to the <br/>
children&#39;s growth, learning and safety.   In not keeping my children sheltered, I <br/>
have children who voluntarily come home every night.   A life of pressure, <br/>
nagging, pushing, guilt and sheltering has resulted in a teen who would rather <br/>
risk the dangers of traveling alone than to stay home.   If running away seems <br/>
safer and freer than being at home, perhaps there should have been a safer, <br/>
freer way for that family to live.<br/>
<br/>
If I knew where Michael Thompson was and that he was safe, I would just write <br/>
to his parents and tell them so.   I&#39;d probably send them some unschooling <br/>
links, and then get a hateful e-mail, and that would be that.   I would not call <br/>
the sheriff and help them return them to his parents, who make him work and <br/>
make him feel giuilty that they gave up careers and professional success for <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Though I do feel for his parent&#39;s and their fears, and I hope he&#39;s well and <br/>
that he contacts them, I hope the situation can be resolved without him being <br/>
forced back into the same situation (or worse, as sometimes happens when <br/>
runaways return and are then grounded and shamed).<br/>

If you click on &quot;letter from dad&quot; (or something like that) in the upper<br/>
left hand corner you can read what the dad wrote to his son.<br/>
<br/>
I found it very sad.  Father acknowledges the son felt pressured and<br/>
nagged but then goes on justify that treatment and to say how much they<br/>

good thing to set out on the table for a day or two at this list, though, to <br/>
remind people that children CAN make their own choices even if you don&#39;t &quot;let <br/>
them.&quot;   Parents think they can command their children&#39;s presence and attention <br/>
and service and gratitude, but it&#39;s not doable, and can backfire badly.<br/>

Really?  I wonder if you could be charged with holding him or  something?<br/>
 <br/>
Fifteen is still a minor, and I wouldn&#39;t want to be in a position of being  <br/>
charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor or maybe a trumped up  <br/>
charge of holding him against his will or whatever.  What if he wanted to  <br/>
stay with me but didn&#39;t want me to call his parents?  I would give him  every <br/>
opportunity to make contact himself before I did so, and I&#39;d have a  deadline.  I <br/>
have sympathy for the kid, but I also have sympathy for his  parents, who <br/>
must be heartsick with worry.<br/>
 <br/>
My son&#39;s in Iraq and could be killed at any moment and I wouldn&#39;t know how  <br/>
or where for a long time.  I would want someone to tell me as soon as  <br/>
possible, if they knew something about him that I wouldn&#39;t otherwise know.   He&#39;ll be <br/>
home for good next month, and then I will finally exhale and won&#39;t be  <br/>
mentioning it again, but for 18 months he has been in the forefront of my mind  at <br/>
all times.  He choose to go and I can email him and call his wife who  talks or <br/>
IMs with him every day, and he&#39;s 23.  The dad of this boy who ran  away at 15 <br/>
doesn&#39;t have those options, and no matter how mainstream his  parenting was, I <br/>
think he deserves to know if someone knows where his son  is.  <br/>
 <br/>
But I agree that the letter points up some very sad misunderstandings on  the <br/>
father&#39;s part, and I hope he is so relieved when he gets his son back that  <br/>
he finally understands.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130942450">I don&#39;t agree that someone who reads this list couldn&#39;t find or help find<br/>
this boy.  I first heard of this on this list and it has caused me to think<br/>
of the unschool friends I have in the northwest and email the information to<br/>
them, thinking it may be possible that their teens have heard of him and his<br/>
plight.  I will make phone calls as well.<br/>
<br/>
Like Sandra, I would not turn him in either if I found him.  I might simply<br/>
let the father know he was seen (but not say where) and that he is ok or has<br/>
a message for his family, or whatever the boy asked for.  The fact that you<br/>
chose to let the announcement go through to your list in the first place<br/>
should now be followed up with a discussion, if one occurs.<br/>
<br/>
I like to think that unschoolers make up some sort of community of folks,<br/>
despite whatever geographic distance exists between us, that allows us to<br/>
help and comfort one another.  The fact that this boy may not have been an<br/>
unschooler, but rather a homeschooler, is an irrelevant point to me.<br/>
<br/>
Just because Sandra says her kids would never run away from home does not<br/>
mean that they never would, nor that other unschool kids wouldn&#39;t.  Life is<br/>
too complex, with too many variables, to make predictions that involve<br/>
&#39;never&#39;.  I too empathize with the son... but also with the parents.  I<br/>
agree that this list supports such tenets as unconditional love, respect for<br/>
the unique learning styles of each child, good communication vs. top-down<br/>
discipline, etc.  How is this relevant however to the fact that a family in<br/>
our broad homeschool community is in crisis and needs help?<br/>

We had a neighbor whom we told could come here any time she needed a safe place. Her father called one night and asked that we tell him when she was here. I refused, saying that she needed a safe place. His brother-in-law, the lawyer, got a restraining order against us.<br/>

But they made their bed. Seriously. They set up the adversarial relationship. I would also encourage him to let them know he was safe, but I wouldn&#39;t turn him in. Basically he&#39;s doing to them what&#39;s been done to him for 15 years. The tables have simply been turned.<br/>

or where for a long time.  I would want someone to tell me as soon as  <br/>
possible, if they knew something about him that I wouldn&#39;t otherwise know.   <br/>
He&#39;ll be home for good next month, and then I will finally exhale and won&#39;t be  <br/>
mentioning it again, but for 18 months he has been in the forefront of my mind  <br/>
at all times.  He choose to go and I can email him and call his wife who  talks or <br/>
IMs with him every day, and he&#39;s 23. <br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m glad he&#39;ll be home soon! I can&#39;t imagine what you&#39;ve been through.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 The dad of this boy who ran  away at 15 <br/>
doesn&#39;t have those options, and no matter how mainstream his  parenting was, I <br/>
think he deserves to know if someone knows where his son  is.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s kind to let him know the child is safe. The *child* obviously felt he was OUT of options. His parents did that.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
But I agree that the letter points up some very sad misunderstandings on  the <br/>
father&#39;s part, and I hope he is so relieved when he gets his son back that  <br/>
he finally understands.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=--=<br/>
 <br/>
Yeah---that would be nice. But I doubt it&#39;ll happen. The letter to his son is very telling. It&#39;s sad, and there&#39;s no way to go back and change what&#39;s happened. But telling the boy that they&#39;ve sacrificed so much for him is pretty shitty. It would make *me* want to stay away forever.<br/>
 <br/>
We only get one chance to make our children&#39;s childhoods magical. To shame him into coming home??? Wouldn&#39;t work on me. I&#39;d just be more resentful.<br/>
 <br/>
Barb, I hope that it all works out well and that he&#39;s safe and happy. Maybe give the dad a copy of Rue&#39;s book???<br/>

<br/>
Really.   I wouldn&#39;t BE &quot;holding him.&quot;   There are hundreds of people whose <br/>

If I knew this boy&#39;s whereabouts I would reassure the parents without calling <br/>

it&#39;s just a hypothetical point.)<br/>

I&#39;ve not ever yet seen or heard of a case in which a runaway went home and <br/>
the parents gave him all the space and respect   he needed.      (Anyone here <br/>
have stories of parents really feeling in the wrong and changing their ways when <br/>
a runaway came home or was delivered by the sheriff?)<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
We had a neighbor whom we told could come here any time she needed a safe <br/>
place. Her father called one night and asked that we tell him when she was here. <br/>
I refused, saying that she needed a safe place. His brother-in-law, the <br/>
lawyer, got a restraining order against us.-=-<br/>
<br/>
A restraining order saying you couldn&#39;t come near the girl!?   I wonder that <br/>
he could do that on her behalf (as it were) without her consent.     A <br/>
restraining order against the father, sure.   Or the uncle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682961691"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; -=-I don&#39;t agree that someone who reads this list couldn&#39;t find or help <br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; this boy. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those in New Zealand, Australia, England, France and Canada won&#39;t.<br/>
He seems to be gone from Florida.   Few other parts of the U.S. are affected <br/>
one way or another.<br/>
<br/>
The list isn&#39;t for local discussion, and the runaway child of someone who&#39;s <br/>
not an unschooler is thrice removed from the list&#39;s purpose.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Like Sandra, I would not turn him in either if I found him. -=-<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll, you&#39;ve forwarded the father&#39;s request for people to turn him in, so <br/>
you might be contributing to that, as was I by letting the announcement through. <br/>
  I hope he&#39;s not turned in, still.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I like to think that unschoolers make up some sort of community of folks,<br/>
despite whatever geographic distance exists between us, that allows us to<br/>
help and comfort one another.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t prevent those who want to help and comfort from doing so, but the <br/>
purpose of this list isn&#39;t   &quot;support&quot; of the parents.   It&#39;s the discussion <br/>
of the benefits of unschooling and how they play out in everyday life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The fact that this boy may not have been an<br/>
unschooler, but rather a homeschooler, is an irrelevant point to me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s fine for you.   Each of us makes decisions in different ways.   Five <br/>
hundred different angles on the idea of community still shouldn&#39;t keep this <br/>
list from discussing how parenting affects relationships.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just because Sandra says her kids would never run away from home does not<br/>
mean that they never would-=-<br/>
<br/>
If they do or don&#39;t, it won&#39;t be because of what I wrote on this list, that&#39;s <br/>
for sure.   They&#39;re 19, 16 and 14 and they haven&#39;t so much as slammed a door <br/>
in anger for years.   <br/>
<br/>
If I wanted to frustrate a child to the point of running away, I&#39;m sure I <br/>
know how to do it.   I&#39;ve seen others do it my whole life.   I wouldn&#39;t WANT to <br/>
do it, but if I snapped and wanted to, or wanted to win some big bet or <br/>
something I can only imagine... here&#39;s what I would do:   I would attempt to force <br/>
the kid to do what I said, eat when and where and how I said (OF COURSE eat WHAT <br/>
I said), and stop eating when I said, and not snack between meals.   I would <br/>
force the child to clean his room to my satisfaction and on my schedule.   I <br/>
would force him to go to school even if he didn&#39;t want to, or just as good, <br/>
maybe I would force him to homeschool even though he wanted to go to school.   I <br/>
would make him help me and then complain about the quality of his work.   I <br/>
would give him very little money and never help him out financially, but make <br/>
him live within his allowance.     I would tell him what to wear and how to wear <br/>
it.   I&#39;d make him be home and in bed at a certain time.   I wouldn&#39;t let him <br/>
listen to music or watch TV to go to sleep, because that would be wasting my <br/>
electricity.   I would make him fill out college applications, and then <br/>
complain about his handwriting.   If I let him play video games at all, I would make <br/>
him sell his old system and put that money toward a new one.   I wouldn&#39;t let <br/>
him watch R rated movies.     If I let him drive the car I would charge him <br/>
by the mile and make him pay his own insurance and remind him frequently what a <br/>
big favor I was doing by not making him wait until he had enough to buy his <br/>
own car.   When he turned 18, I would start charging him rent.   Happy <br/>
birthday.   <br/>
<br/>
I doubt the family in question did al those things, but they probably did <br/>
some of them.<br/>
They&#39;re all things I&#39;ve seen done by families I know or have known.<br/>
<br/>
None of those families has kids happier than mine, nor relationships with <br/>
their kids as good as Keith and I have with ours.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I<br/>
agree that this list supports such tenets as unconditional love, respect for<br/>
the unique learning styles of each child, good communication vs. top-down<br/>
discipline, etc.  How is this relevant however to the fact that a family in<br/>
our broad homeschool community is in crisis and needs help?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about &quot;unconditional love&quot;--it&#39;s a concept often misused and <br/>
abused.<br/>
<br/>
What is relevant about what the list supports is that this list doesn&#39;t exist <br/>
to help a family in &quot;a broad homeschool community.&quot;    Even it this were a <br/>
Washington State unschooling list, it wouldn&#39;t be the purpose of the list.<br/>
<br/>
Support and help come in different ways.   We&#39;re working through and honing <br/>
ideas and ways to express those ideas that have helped MANY families have <br/>
better relationships, more peace, more stability and security in their family <br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
The woman whose husband and church made her homeschool against her will... <br/>
(yeah, which one?) , the one who drowned her kids.   Was she part of our broad <br/>
homeschool community?   The mom who killed kids with a rock (was she in Texas <br/>
too?)   Did we owe her help and support?     The family with all the adopted <br/>
kids they can&#39;t take care of (yeah, which one?) and so they left some in the <br/>
house and hungry (still doesn&#39;t narrow it down to one family...)--them too?<br/>
<br/>
I have more in common with others who grew up in Northern New Mexico than I <br/>
have in common with the people in the paragraph above.   I have more in common <br/>
with other folksinging guitar players, even those who are childless or send <br/>
their kids to school, than I will ever have in common with a family whose <br/>
children are dressed for school each morning by 8:00 and report to their in-house <br/>
schoolroom or kitchen table.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce, one of the listowners, wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Everyone who is interested in unschooling or finding out more about it is <br/>
welcome to join. But be aware that the list is for those who are seeking a <br/>
deeper understanding of unschooling, a more respectful relationship with their <br/>
children, to move out of their comfort zone to reach for something better. That <br/>
means, though we recognize how hard the journey is and how far people come to <br/>
just let go of one schoolish thing, this list can&#39;t offer on line support for <br/>
people who are pausing at some comfortable spot on their journey towards <br/>
unschooling. We are here to support those who are actively pushing beyond their <br/>
comfort zones.-=-<br/>

find a way because I knew they loved him through and through.<br/>

all doing fine, today. Dad and son have both thanked us.<br/>

We don&#39;t know why this 16 year old has left home. We don&#39;t know what  <br/>
his relationship with his parents is really like. We don&#39;t know much  <br/>

We also don&#39;t know that the dad didn&#39;t write what he did out of an exagerrated sense of guilt.  Parents who have things like this happen many times will put more blame on themselves than maybe they deserve.  I agree his letter is telling, but I don&#39;t think we should jump to conclusions.

<h4>Barb Lundgren</h4>
<time>22 Nov 2005, at  5:12pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978325207">I was voicing a counter opinion, I thought, to what I read was Sandra&#39;s<br/>
opposition to help this father find his son.  It is entirely possible I<br/>
misread her intentions.. this is only email afterall, and a far cry from<br/>
person-so-person communication.  I totally understand if this discussion is<br/>
not appropriate for this list, although since the announcement was allowed,<br/>
I think a discussion should follow.<br/>
<br/>
Insight on the family:  I know the father professionally and somewhat<br/>
personally.  He and his wife gave up their NYC jobs and moved to lower key<br/>
Florida, starting a home business (home school related) so they could spend<br/>
more time with their young teen... about 3 years ago.  They are admittedly<br/>
not unschoolers and we have had discussions about the difference.  They<br/>
definitely have had more of a plan to &quot;produce the well educated child&quot;.<br/>
So, while we all have our opinions about that, and we have seen a taste<br/>
through this family of a possible outcome of this approach which we are all<br/>
sensitive to and certainly empathetic, the fact remains that a child is<br/>
missing.  Even though parents believe he is in the northwest, they don&#39;t<br/>
know and don&#39;t know how he got there, why or where he is, nor what condition<br/>
he is in.  All this is as troubling as it gets for a parent, and I am deeply<br/>
concerned for them.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to see this unschool list jump at any opportunity to help<br/>
locate the boy, if for no other reason to come to his aid and help him get<br/>
what he is after.<br/>

&gt; top-down<br/>
&gt; discipline, etc.  How is this relevant however to the fact that a<br/>
&gt; family in<br/>
&gt; our broad homeschool community is in crisis and needs help?<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what you&#39;re complaining about, Barb. Sounds like you and<br/>
Sandra (and I) are in agreement. We wouldn&#39;t automatically &quot;turn in&quot;<br/>
a 16 year old who has left home. He could have really good reasons,<br/>
we just don&#39;t know. I would let parents know that I knew he was okay,<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
I DID call a runaway kid&#39;s parents, once, because I read some of his<br/>
email and he appeared to be suicidal. I KNEW his parents and I knew<br/>
what the problem was - he was gay and he didn&#39;t think they could<br/>
accept that. HE was wrong - as hard as it was for them, I knew they&#39;d<br/>
find a way because I knew they loved him through and through.<br/>
<br/>
I called his dad and read him some of his son&#39;s email and told him<br/>
where he was. They got help for him and for themselves and they are<br/>
all doing fine, today. Dad and son have both thanked us.<br/>
<br/>
But - in that case, I knew the child and the parents and I knew what<br/>
the problem was, exactly. And I was very certain that the son was<br/>
wrong about what his parents&#39; reaction was going to be.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t know why this 16 year old has left home. We don&#39;t know what<br/>
his relationship with his parents is really like. We don&#39;t know much<br/>
of anything, except he isn&#39;t a young child and it isn&#39;t obvious to me<br/>
that a 16 year old young man should automatically be returned against<br/>
his will to parents he&#39;s run away from.<br/>
<br/>
Barb, if you know them, them maybe you have some insight that the<br/>
rest of us do not have. That might make a difference in how you feel<br/>
about it.<br/>

We&#39;ll, you&#39;ve forwarded the father&#39;s request for people to turn him in, so<br/>

<br/>
It doesn&#39;t prevent those who want to help and comfort from doing so, but the<br/>
purpose of this list isn&#39;t   &quot;support&quot; of the parents.   It&#39;s the discussion<br/>
of the benefits of unschooling and how they play out in everyday life.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s fine for you.   Each of us makes decisions in different ways.   Five<br/>
hundred different angles on the idea of community still shouldn&#39;t keep this<br/>
list from discussing how parenting affects relationships.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just because Sandra says her kids would never run away from home does not<br/>
mean that they never would-=-<br/>
<br/>
If they do or don&#39;t, it won&#39;t be because of what I wrote on this list,<br/>
that&#39;s <br/>
for sure.   They&#39;re 19, 16 and 14 and they haven&#39;t so much as slammed a door<br/>
in anger for years.<br/>
<br/>
If I wanted to frustrate a child to the point of running away, I&#39;m sure I<br/>
know how to do it.   I&#39;ve seen others do it my whole life.   I wouldn&#39;t WANT<br/>
to <br/>
do it, but if I snapped and wanted to, or wanted to win some big bet or<br/>
something I can only imagine... here&#39;s what I would do:   I would attempt to<br/>
force <br/>
the kid to do what I said, eat when and where and how I said (OF COURSE eat<br/>
WHAT <br/>
I said), and stop eating when I said, and not snack between meals.   I would<br/>
force the child to clean his room to my satisfaction and on my schedule.   I<br/>
would force him to go to school even if he didn&#39;t want to, or just as good,<br/>
maybe I would force him to homeschool even though he wanted to go to school.<br/>
I <br/>
would make him help me and then complain about the quality of his work.   I<br/>
would give him very little money and never help him out financially, but<br/>
make <br/>
him live within his allowance.     I would tell him what to wear and how to<br/>
wear <br/>
it.   I&#39;d make him be home and in bed at a certain time.   I wouldn&#39;t let<br/>
him <br/>
listen to music or watch TV to go to sleep, because that would be wasting my<br/>
electricity.   I would make him fill out college applications, and then<br/>
complain about his handwriting.   If I let him play video games at all, I<br/>
would make <br/>
him sell his old system and put that money toward a new one.   I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
let <br/>
him watch R rated movies.     If I let him drive the car I would charge him<br/>
by the mile and make him pay his own insurance and remind him frequently<br/>
what a <br/>
big favor I was doing by not making him wait until he had enough to buy his<br/>
own car.   When he turned 18, I would start charging him rent.   Happy<br/>
birthday.   <br/>
<br/>
I doubt the family in question did al those things, but they probably did<br/>
some of them.<br/>
They&#39;re all things I&#39;ve seen done by families I know or have known.<br/>
<br/>
None of those families has kids happier than mine, nor relationships with<br/>
their kids as good as Keith and I have with ours.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know about &quot;unconditional love&quot;--it&#39;s a concept often misused and<br/>
abused.<br/>
<br/>
What is relevant about what the list supports is that this list doesn&#39;t<br/>
exist <br/>
to help a family in &quot;a broad homeschool community.&quot;    Even it this were a<br/>
Washington State unschooling list, it wouldn&#39;t be the purpose of the list.<br/>
<br/>
Support and help come in different ways.   We&#39;re working through and honing<br/>
ideas and ways to express those ideas that have helped MANY families have<br/>
better relationships, more peace, more stability and security in their<br/>
family <br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
The woman whose husband and church made her homeschool against her will...<br/>
(yeah, which one?) , the one who drowned her kids.   Was she part of our<br/>
broad <br/>
homeschool community?   The mom who killed kids with a rock (was she in<br/>
Texas <br/>
too?)   Did we owe her help and support?     The family with all the adopted<br/>
kids they can&#39;t take care of (yeah, which one?) and so they left some in the<br/>
house and hungry (still doesn&#39;t narrow it down to one family...)--them too?<br/>
<br/>
I have more in common with others who grew up in Northern New Mexico than I<br/>
have in common with the people in the paragraph above.   I have more in<br/>
common <br/>
with other folksinging guitar players, even those who are childless or send<br/>
their kids to school, than I will ever have in common with a family whose<br/>
children are dressed for school each morning by 8:00 and report to their<br/>
in-house <br/>
schoolroom or kitchen table.<br/>

There should be no issue outside of discussion on how the situation applies <br/>
to unschooling, and as that family isn&#39;t unschooling the situation turns <br/>
quickly to the relationships we ARE involved in.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;His&quot; pain the dad&#39;s?   Or his-pain the son&#39;s?<br/>

In such cases I personally am more concerned with the child&#39;s feelings than <br/>
the parent&#39;s.   Your choice can certainly be different.   But the discussion <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be about a particular family or person, it&#39;s about the ideas and how <br/>
they apply to this list.    Even if it were an unschooling family, even if they <br/>
were on the list, we&#39;re here to discuss ideas and philosophies.   <br/>

I like to see this unschooling list discuss unschooling.   <br/>
This list can&#39;t locate a boy.      I doubt he left home in order to garner <br/>
the help of other parents.   If he trusted parents better, he might have stayed <br/>
with his own.   Maybe he has gone to some adults he does trust.   I hope so.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No. *For the purposes of the list*, how this father&#39;s life turned out  <br/>
is not as important as how an unschoolers life turns out. His child  <br/>
didn&#39;t run away because he was unschooling and practicing respectful  <br/>
parenting so *for the purposes of this list* we should stick to  <br/>
discussions that help us make better lives for our families.<br/>
<br/>
People in this world make all sorts of decisions that create  <br/>
unpleasant situations for themselves. *The purpose of the list* is  <br/>
not to express the hurt we feel for those people. Individuals on the  <br/>
list can feel how ever they wish, discuss whatever they wish. They  <br/>
just need to express it elsewhere so this list can be what the list  <br/>
discription says its purpose is: discussing unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I know once people find a place where others they like gather, the  <br/>
list can start to feel like a comfy place to come chit-chat about our  <br/>
lives and hopes and fears. But that&#39;s not its purpose. The purpose is  <br/>
to discuss unschooling -- which *can be* our lives and hopes and (how  <br/>
to get past our) fears about unschooling ;-)<br/>

to stress out over it for years before it happens.  The dad in this runaway<br/>
family may have been giving his son the same message but because the son<br/>
chose to leave on his own terms (if he did and we don&#39;t know he did), he is<br/>
freaked.  The fact that he doesn&#39;t know where he is or what condition he is<br/>
in would concern any parent obviously.  It would be interesting to see what<br/>
happens to the boy if and when he is found.<br/>
<br/>
Any person&#39;s greatest mistake is thinking they have control over anyone but<br/>
themselves.  Parents most commonly fall victim to this way of thinking, but<br/>
they have learned it and been conditioned to it themselves all their lives<br/>
so they think it&#39;s natural, right and unquestionable.  I often wonder how<br/>
and why things lined up magically for me such that I consciously chose to<br/>
abandon all I had learned and move in a complete and total opposite<br/>
direction from how I was raised.   It&#39;s good we can find support for<br/>
alternative ways of parenting among our unschool support networks.<br/>

From a personal perspective the father is using emotional blackmail in<br/>
his letter to try and get his son back. It might work this time but<br/>
eventually it won&#39;t. Using emotional blackmail such  &quot;see what I&#39;ve<br/>
done for you&quot; and &quot;see what I&#39;ve given up for you&quot; does not make<br/>
people want to be with you or do things for you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had this kind of thing from my mother most of my life. Not as<br/>
overtly as the dad has done, it was much more subtle, but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
make you feel loved it just makes you feel permanently disapproved of.<br/>
Both me and my brother had left home by the age of 18.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482360067">I don&#39;t think we ever need to tell our children &quot;all&quot; we have given <br/>
up for them.  Mostly my children know what choices I have made to <br/>
give my life to them.  It is not giving something up from my <br/>
perspective it is just making a better choice of what to do with my <br/>
life.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a line in the movie Cheaper By the Dozen where Steve Martin <br/>
quits his new job that is taking so much time from his family and <br/>
his boss asks &quot;Are you giving up the dream?&quot; and he replies &quot;No, <br/>
just going with a different one!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That is how I feel about my life.  I had many ideas about my life <br/>
before I had children.  Now my dream is to make as many of my <br/>
children&#39;s dreams come true as I can.  I don&#39;t deny myself <br/>
everything either but I do make choices in how I spend the time in <br/>
my life.  If I wanted it to be all about me then I should have <br/>
remained childless. <br/>
<br/>
My kids know what I &quot;gave up&quot; if we have to say it that way, because <br/>
they ask &quot;Mommy what did you used to do before you had kids?  Did <br/>
you like it? Will you ever do it again?  What will you do when we <br/>
grow up?&quot;  And so forth.  I chose to have 5 wonderful children and <br/>
my children, I hope, will always feel that I have no regrets in they <br/>
way I chose to spend my life staying home and raising them.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have one childhood and I intend to make it magical as much <br/>
as I can.  I missed out on childhood and realized it after I was an <br/>
adult.  I was a runaway teen at 16 and NEVER went back.  I have <br/>
never lived at home again and I just turned 33 two weeks ago. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&quot; didn&#39;t want anyone turning me in.  If I had I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
looked for an escape route.  My mother was smart though and began to <br/>
try and work on our relationship.  She didn&#39;t force me to come home <br/>
when she found me.  She flew to where I was and talked with me and <br/>
left me there and told me she would always be there if I wanted to <br/>
come home.  When I came back to town I had my own apartment and a <br/>
job!  She supported me in those choices because she realized her <br/>
mistakes and loved me so much that she wasn&#39;t willing to lose me or <br/>
my love.  I love her for it to this day.  <br/>
<br/>
This pretty much alienated her from my family, but my relationship <br/>
with her was better for it and we were closer than ever and remained <br/>
that way until she died at 44 years old.  I am grateful for the time <br/>
that I had in the relationship with her in the years that followed.  <br/>
It didn&#39;t make up for or I should say take away the years of <br/>
pressure and disappointment in me, but it did enable me to have a <br/>
closer relationship with her than I had ever had and learn from her <br/>
decision to respect me.  It taught me alot in how I parent my <br/>
children and how I treat my friends for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that things will work out with this family, but I know that <br/>
for me it wouldn&#39;t have if my mother had chased me down and made me <br/>
feel guilty over all she had given up for an ungrateful child like <br/>
me.  Some relatives reacted just like this and to this day the <br/>
relationships are strained at best if there is even a relationship <br/>
at all.  Being a military family we always look for orders as far <br/>
away as possible because I feel strangled by family and always <br/>
disapproved of even to this day.  We just put in for Hawaii, nope no <br/>
family there! It&#39;s sad but I really hope we get those orders.<br/>

<br/>
Those two lines, right next to each other, seem contradictory.    This isn&#39;t <br/>
something parents have much time to really contemplate, because babies and <br/>
toddlers overwhelm us, but to keep the perspective that we ARE living our lives <br/>
is good.<br/>
<br/>
When I get frustrated when having to do things for my kids sometimes, maybe <br/>
laundry or taking care of one who&#39;s sick or has had dental surgery (liquid diet <br/>
and painkillers for three days or so after Kirby&#39;s wisdom teeth came out), I <br/>
give myself an internally stern reminder to STOP IT.   Every one of my <br/>
children is strong and whole.   I have no wheelchair bound child.   I have children <br/>
who can see, hear, and speak.   I have no child whose ass I have to wipe as a <br/>
teenager; many parents do and I&#39;m grateful and happy that mine will likely move <br/>
out of our house by choice, carry their own boxes, and not have to have <br/>
government subsidized health attendants to do it.    <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not off topic for me and myself, in my mind.   My role as a mother <br/>
hasn&#39;t been all that hard.   I could have made it more difficult by making a bunch <br/>
of rules my kids would have failed to follow, and by setting a hurdles of my <br/>
own creation that they might have failed to jump.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My kids know what I &quot;gave up&quot; if we have to say it that way-=-<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have to say it that way. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
If we choose how to think and choose our words, we don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
I could leave my family today, but I&#39;m choosing to stay.   I don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; <br/>
be here.   I WANT to be here.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;I&quot; didn&#39;t want anyone turning me in.  If I had I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>

<br/>
That is very cool.   That&#39;s one of the best outcome stories I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
Keith says one friend of his who ran away had a better life when he got back <br/>
in that his parents gave him the privacy of his room, and less grief about <br/>
going out with friends, but they also immediately formed his &quot;exit plan&quot; so that <br/>
he was scheduled to be OUT when he turned eighteen.   They gave him a <br/>
kind-of-nicer last couple of years in their home before they booted him.    Not as <br/>
nice as your mom&#39;s response.<br/>
<br/>
My mom was nicer to me after I was grown, and for a few years she stopped <br/>
drinking and we hung out more (before she started again because she said simply <br/>
that drinking was more fun than being sober).   She apologized for some things <br/>
she had done, and she was supportive of my parenting, but I accepted it pretty <br/>
neutrally.   It didn&#39;t change my childhood for her to change her mind years <br/>
later.   It was &quot;nice&quot; (wanly nice, better than nothing) but not thrilling or <br/>
lifechanging.   It was easy for her, after she was living alone, to claim she <br/>
wished she had done better.   It was a &quot;whatever&quot; situation for me, though.   <br/>
She generally chose not to do better when it mattered and when she had the <br/>
chance.<br/>
<br/>
We all have the chance to learn from others&#39; mistakes (and our own) and make <br/>
better choices today, and tomorrow.   That&#39;s why this list exists and has <br/>
survived, because it has helped and is helping real children&#39;s lives be better <br/>
now.<br/>

The concerns of any parents aren&#39;t the topic of this list.<br/>
The boy probably knows where he is, and it&#39;s the boy&#39;s life I&#39;m more <br/>
concerned with.   His parents knew about unschooling, I presume, and decided it wasn&#39;t <br/>
what they wanted.   There&#39;s where the topic touches this list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It would be interesting to see what happens to the boy if and when he is <br/>

We all know stories of runaways being found, don&#39;t we?   The details of a <br/>

<br/>
-=-Any person&#39;s greatest mistake is thinking they have control over anyone <br/>

<br/>
Control over decisions and thoughts we don&#39;t have, but control over affecting <br/>
the environment of others we absolutely DO have.    <br/>
<br/>
I have three children all still in bed.   The house was cold, so I turned up <br/>
the heat and lit the oven to make cake.   They will awaken to warmth and a <br/>
good smell.   <br/>
<br/>
I *could* (legally, and it is within my power) turn music on really loud, and <br/>
slam doors and run the vacuum cleaner and bitch at them about being lazy when <br/>
they do wake up.   I am choosing not to do that.    That is within my <br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
What my kids will think about me is not in my control, but it is within my <br/>
sphere of influence.   I make choices every moment of my life, and those choices <br/>
matter.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s good we can find support for<br/>

-=-<br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t a support group.<br/>
<br/>
One thing a person needs to feel supported is information and ideas, and this <br/>
list does try to help people have ideas they need to change their thinking so <br/>
that unschooling can thrive, but this list isn&#39;t intended to be the be-all, <br/>
end-all for any unschooling family&#39;s life.   We&#39;re not going to call to remind <br/>
people of dentist&#39;s appointments or bring casseroles if someone&#39;s injured.   <br/>
It&#39;s an international all-spread-out list for the discussion of unschooling.    <br/>
That&#39;s a lot already, and we don&#39;t need to feel bad about what we&#39;re NOT <br/>
providing people.   No sense going to the sporting goods store and complaining <br/>
that you really needed eggnog and some earrings.<br/>
<br/>
There are lists for discussing missing persons, right? <br/>
<br/>

age<br/>
18 by being given one of three options:  go to college, join the military or<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ve all lived in the same world, and many of those on this list are trying <br/>
to live differently.<br/>

avenues set before me (by me), one being a career and the other to <br/>
stay home and live with my kids and spend my life being with them, I <br/>
picked to stay home.  Not because I felt obligated because at 21 <br/>
years old I didn&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; obligated.  But I found that I really <br/>
liked my kids on top of loving them.  I liked being with them and <br/>
watching them grow.  I liked to play with them. I liked it so much <br/>
that I had 5 (never really thought I liked kids that much &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
<br/>
I had an option that some may not have the luxury of to choose not <br/>
to work and made what I feel is the better choice.  I knew I <br/>
couldn&#39;t give 100% to being a parent if I wasn&#39;t there to do it. I <br/>
love my life and can&#39;t even begin to imagine all I would have missed <br/>
with my kids if I had chosen the career. That list would be <br/>
endless...<br/>
<br/>
I left the newly started career and never looked back.  It has been <br/>
11 and a half years and what a fun ride it has been.  I look forward <br/>
to having teenagers that are happy and confident and free to think <br/>
and be who they want to be.  <br/>
<br/>
My life is more wonderful than I ever knew life could be, even with <br/>
my health issues, I never imagined it could be like this. I <br/>
certainly didn&#39;t grow up this way.  My children have shown me how <br/>
happy I can be by showing me how to be free from some ridiculous <br/>
expectations that someone else feels the need to impose on me.<br/>
<br/>
As I sit and type this my 6 yr old is sitting on the arm of the <br/>
chair singing &quot;sweet, sweet Mooommmyyy, sweet, sweet mooommmyyy to <br/>
the the tune of Sweet Sweet Nightengale from Cinderella.  My life is <br/>
so wonderful.<br/>

many, many jobs. I don&#39;t think I was ready for &quot;ADULT&quot; life untill a <br/>
few years ago (I&#39;m 30 now); right out of high school, I went to <br/>
college, and then got married. I was well educated and intelligent, <br/>
but I really had no common sense or maturity. The biggest problem I <br/>
had/have is no one will help some one that they think should &quot;know <br/>
