&lt;&lt; The difference between an artist who becomes an artist and one who just <br/>
takes <br/>
 art classes, or the difference between a pianist and a piano student is <br/>
 likely to have to do with how much they did beyond and above the class <br/>
 assignments.<br/>
 <br/>
 Doing extra makes you &quot;real&quot; but it doesn&#39;t make you self-taught. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess I see it more as the attitude with the person learning.<br/>
I have learned a lot of art from just looking and reading and doing.<br/>
But then I&#39;ve picked up some techniques at classes, without following <br/>
everything the teacher taught.<br/>
So I feel self taught, but have had teachers. I didn&#39;t get a formal <br/>
education, or take courses at a college, so that seems self taught enough to <br/>
me, even though there have been teachers.<br/>
It&#39;s maybe just semantics and degrees, but how do you define self taught? I <br/>
know it means the person did it themselves, but then at what point does it <br/>
fall out of the self taught realm?<br/>
The minute another person shows them a tip or technique? A formal class?<br/>
I think it&#39;s more the attitude of the person and whether they simply pick up <br/>
bits and pieces from another person, or if they rely completely on the <br/>
teacher to teach them everything.<br/>
Obviously this is all arguable. I&#39;m just thinking about this and to what <br/>
degrees a person uses classes or other teachers and at what point it isn&#39;t <br/>
self teaching.  Another thing to roll around in the brain and ponder.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t see it as just semantics and degrees.  I&#39;m seeing it as truth and <br/>
integrity.<br/>
<br/>
No great artist is just a subset of his teacher&#39;s knowledge.  EVERY great <br/>
musician goes beyond or around or broader than his teacher or teachers.<br/>
<br/>
I had one guitar lesson and then learned lots more on my own.  My teacher (an <br/>
older teen) was quite willing to do regular lessons, but I was too impatient <br/>
and just went.  Sometimes I asked her questions.  But if I ever say &quot;I never <br/>
had a lesson,&quot; I&#39;ll be lying because I HAD a lesson, and the offer of more.  <br/>
I only needed one, and I jumped on and surpassed her within a year or so.  <br/>
But I was not &quot;self taught&quot; entirely.<br/>
<br/>
I learned to play recorder one afternoon in order to go into a recorder class <br/>
as an intermediate instead of into the beginning class.  John Truitt had <br/>
offered recorder classes through the free university in 1970.  I called him <br/>
and asked what was the difference between beginner and intermediate.  He said <br/>
beginners didn&#39;t know how to read music, intermediates knew the fingerings of <br/>
at least a full scale.<br/>
<br/>
So I learned the fingerings.  It was easy because I had played clarinet in <br/>
Elementary and Jr. High.<br/>
<br/>
I played with John Truitt throughout the rest of college.  We both ended up <br/>
taking lessons from Floyd Williams (who later went to Australia to teach), <br/>
who was really interested in the period-instruments revival of Renaissance <br/>
music in the 1970&#39;s.   <br/>
<br/>
I would credit John as having taught me to play recorder, and he would be <br/>
embarrassed and say &quot;You already knew how!&quot;  But he gave me the pointers that <br/>
took me from hooting badly into it and playing with some finesse.  I went <br/>
regularly to his intermediate class.  I never ignored his advice.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
be telling the truth if I said &quot;self taught&quot; about recorder, but I played <br/>
songs I chose myself, and I did research myself all along, in addition to <br/>
doing things John and Floyd thought would be good for me.<br/>

&lt;&lt; But exactly how can a person self teach without the help of others?<br/>
We get help from others from the day we&#39;re born. If only by observance. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think books have always fallen under &quot;self taught,&quot; because when the idea <br/>
came along, many of those authors were dead, or thousands of miles away.  And <br/>
if you ONLY learned it from a book, then you were self taught.  You were <br/>
lacking the advantage of someone saying &quot;Wait--turn that 30% and it will help <br/>
immensely.&quot;  You did all your own trial and error.<br/>
