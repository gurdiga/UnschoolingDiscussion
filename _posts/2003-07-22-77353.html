&lt;&lt; So, this person was a liar and/or hypocrite!  But that doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
everybody <br/>
who spanks is.  When I said I only did it in rare emergencies, I meant what I <br/>
said.  I meant literal emergencies with the potential of death, like the <br/>
running in the street example.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You would like to have meant that.  In retrospective you would like for it to <br/>
seem that&#39;s what you meant.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to justify spanking without being a hypocrite.<br/>
It&#39;s really difficult to justify spanking to THIS list without backpedalling <br/>
at least and retracting or painting over original statements.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s baffling, and a little amusing, that you keep trying to do it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a traditional story in New Mexico (and along some of the rivers in <br/>
northern Mexico), especially common in Northern New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
A version I heard in Tesuque, just north of Santa Fe, was told about a place <br/>
in an arroyo right below where I was living, and concerned the one tiny <br/>
grocery store in that town.<br/>
<br/>
The story is generically called &quot;La Llorona,&quot; and usually involves a baby <br/>
drowning in a river, but this town has no running water, just a deep arroyo, a <br/>
canyon where water only runs in heavy rains.<br/>
<br/>
The mother had gone shopping and on the way back she had her baby in one arm <br/>
and her groceries in the other.  She tripped and was falling and she didn&#39;t <br/>
want to drop the groceries, so she squeezed them really tight, but she <br/>
accidently squeezed the baby side too tight and the baby died.  (So she moans and cries <br/>
at night, when the wind blows, because she misses her baby.  All those <br/>
stories are told to explain wind-in-trees noise, and to warn children not to wander <br/>
around alone in the dark at night, and to take good care of babies.)<br/>
<br/>
When you first told your spanking story, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:OomYaaqub@...">OomYaaqub@...</a>, I thought about <br/>
how you AND la llorona might have just dropped the groceries to take care of <br/>
the baby.  Maybe the life and death situations shouldn&#39;t value groceries so <br/>
highly.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is too young to understand the difference between the road and <br/>
not-the-road, isn&#39;t he young enough to be carried in a backpack or a stroller?<br/>
