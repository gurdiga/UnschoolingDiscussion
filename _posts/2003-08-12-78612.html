<div id="ygrps-yiv-505770237">It&#39;s 4:30 am Pacific time... and we&#39;re on our way to the airport...me and <br/>
the kids.   We&#39;re going to try to catch the 6:40 am flight to San Jose, <br/>
which gets in at 9 am or so.  Then we sit for about 3 hours and then its <br/>
really crunch time as we try to get the flight from San Jose to Kansas City <br/>
(booked 139) which goes on to Raleigh/Durham, NC.  Keep your fingers <br/>
crossed.  If you hadn&#39;t already guessed, we fly standby.  Hubby&#39;s a pilot <br/>
with Southwest and has a thing about not buying tickets since &quot;he&quot; can fly <br/>
for free.  Anyway...IF all goes well, we will arrive in Raleigh by 9:30 pm <br/>
Eastern standard time!  Whoooo.  Then its 8 or 9 days tripping around the <br/>
state sighting seeing and down to Charleston and back to Columbia and then <br/>
catching up with hubby and the conference!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to meet some of you all there for the first time....<br/>
<br/>
Your friendly lurker from the Seattle area....wish us luck!!<br/>
