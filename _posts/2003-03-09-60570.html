&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve never heard anyone else mention having those dreams.  I wonder <br/>
if it&#39;s just more common than I realize or if it&#39;s just more common <br/>
among unschoolers?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re just about universal among schooled people.  I guess you <br/>
just hadn&#39;t talked about dreams much is all.<br/>
<br/>
The scariest for me is that it&#39;s time for a final in college, I&#39;ve never <br/>
really quite even figured out where the room was, had pretty  much forgotten <br/>
I was even enrolled, it&#39;s within fifteen minutes of the starting time and I&#39;m <br/>
walking around campus looking for the building with a piece of paper in my <br/>
hand which maybe I should have looked at four months before that.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had it for a few years, but I did have it a fair number of times <br/>
long after I was in school.<br/>
<br/>
One day in 4th or 5th grade I really did accidently go to school wearing <br/>
bedroom slippers.  That&#39;s not ALL I was wearing, but I had forgotten to put <br/>
my shoes on and the bus came and I wore cheap, worn, fuzzy slippers all day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked people a few times what they think their stress dreams will be.  <br/>
Adults with homeschooled kids have dreamed they would be about sports or <br/>
theatre, maybe.  Unschooled kids haven&#39;t known what I was talking about.   (I <br/>
do know one neurotic thought-spinning theatre-involved homeschooler.  I could <br/>
ask him.  But he went to school for seven years or so, too, so he won&#39;t be a <br/>
clean catch.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OH! In third grade I was told by my best friend that it was &quot;Dress Down Day&quot;, <br/>
which at this school meant that girls could wear PANTS! &lt;g&gt; So I did. <br/>
<br/>
Well, NO ONE else had pants on; so I took mine off, dumped my lunch out, and <br/>
stuffed them into my lunchbox. I wore my long raincoat ALL DAY. The teacher <br/>
though I was sick because I had my coat on all day--even inside---and I <br/>
didn&#39;t eat lunch.<br/>
<br/>
I was too afraid to say that I&#39;d worn pants.<br/>
<br/>
DAMN!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I did this, too.  Just LAST SUMMER for goodness&#39; sake!  My husband, my good <br/>
friend, and I went to a workshop together about two hours from home.  I <br/>
drove.  I was so comfortable and feeling peaceful.  But, when we arrived to <br/>
our destination and I got out of the car and started hoofing it across the <br/>
gravel parking lot, I noticed that something was amiss.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago, life 15  or so, I was working in New York City.  I used to <br/>
drive to a train station and catch a train into the City.  My husband and I <br/>
both wore black Reebok running shoes.  Anyway, I was running to catch the <br/>
train but I felt I had to keep stopping to tie my left shoe, which I felt <br/>
was not tied.  It was tied, but I thought it wasn&#39;t tied tight <br/>
enough.  Sure enough, just before I got onto the train, I looked down and I <br/>
had one great big left foot and a normal-sized right foot.  I was stuck <br/>
wearing one of Jimmy&#39;s shoes all day (he had worn different shoes that <br/>
day).  When I called Jimmy to tell him, we were howling on the phone about <br/>
it for quite a while.  Then, when he caught his breath, he asked me if I <br/>
was pulling to one side as I walked.<br/>
<br/>
The benefit of these things is that I have a keenly developed sense of <br/>
humility and it takes a lot to embarrass me.  (g)<br/>

<br/>
We stayed with friends in Maryland a few years ago.  Family with a kid, our <br/>
family, our kids.  The parents both would go to the train station and into <br/>
Washington DC to work.<br/>
<br/>
One morning we got up and Kirby&#39;s black shoes were GONE.  Really, truly gone. <br/>
 We ended up buying him some, I think, or maybe he wore flip-flops.    That <br/>
night, the dad of that family came in, wearing Kirby&#39;s shoes.  <br/>
<br/>
The kids had all watched TV in the parents&#39; bedroom, and had taken off shoes. <br/>
 Gerry the dad had a new pair of black shoes he wasn&#39;t totally used to.  <br/>
Kirby&#39;s were kind of new.  Gerry woke up, put shoes on, and went to work.   <br/>
<br/>
Mystery solved.<br/>

1200 students.<br/>
<br/>
I was &quot;ball monitor&quot; in kindergarten and had to stay outside and close <br/>
the ball cabinet up while everybody else went back inside after recess. <br/>
Well - I got the cabinet closed up and turned around and ALL the kids <br/>
had gone inside, the doors were all closed, and I had NO CLUE which of <br/>
the doors was to my classroom - there were a bunch and they all looked <br/>
alike. So I walked home - about 3 blocks.  They didn&#39;t notice I was <br/>
gone. I sat on the porch and waited for my mom to come home (she was a <br/>
teacher). She walked me back over and showed me how to tell which room <br/>
was mine so that it wouldn&#39;t happen to me again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That must have been scary.  I know that a friend (more of an acquaintance) <br/>
that has a son.  When he was in Kindergarten the principal looked out the <br/>
window of the school after all the buses had left and saw the boys walking in <br/>
the field next to the road.  The parents were called in and scolded and the <br/>
son was disciplined (code for spanked).  My question was what happened to <br/>
whoever was supervising him.  When I was in school the teachers made sure the <br/>
younger kids got on the bus and got on the right bus.  Is there no one <br/>
watching while the kids get on the bus.  He saw something in the field and <br/>
walked away instead of getting on the bus and when he turned around the bus <br/>
was gone.<br/>
So sad<br/>

<br/>
Just last week here in Fl there was a boy that drowned when he was <br/>
out at the beach for a day with his friends. They were all in middle <br/>
school. They spoke with the father and he was asking how this could <br/>
happen. That he pays for transportation to take his child to and from <br/>
school. The bus picked his child up that morning and somewher along <br/>
the line, the boy and his friends were able to skip out and head to <br/>
the beach. <br/>
