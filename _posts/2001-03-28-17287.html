<div id="ygrps-yiv-611263980">Perhaps she misunderstood the nature of Lisa&#39;s article which was left for <br/>
reading by some (nice, I&#39;m sure) man with his pants down.    :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been told before that my articles had been stuck on refrigerator doors <br/>
and tapes had been left in husbands&#39; car stereos, but I&#39;ve never been <br/>
informed that anyone was reading my stuff in the bathroom.  (Not that it <br/>
might not happen...)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A couple years ago I posted that when you were interviewed in HEM, I read<br/>
it out loud to my husband when we were on a date.  <br/>
<br/>
And I do fold HEM open to key articles and sometimes underline stuff and<br/>
leave it in the bathroom.  But, I think he enjoys it and it can lead to<br/>
good discussions.<br/>

Extremism in defense of unschooling is no vice!   ;-)<br/>
