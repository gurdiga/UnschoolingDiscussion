<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just wanted to add my thoughts to what other wonderful unschoolers <br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; said.  For us unschooling is more than &quot;schooling&quot;.  By that I mean <br/>
&gt; it is <br/>
&gt; more than your approach to education.  It is the way we live.  How <br/>
&gt; we treat <br/>
&gt; our children.  For us it means that our children are people already <br/>
&gt; living <br/>
&gt; and being. ( I hate that question:  &quot;what are you going to be when <br/>
&gt; you grow <br/>
&gt; up?&quot;) We treat our children with respect and I believe that they are <br/>
&gt; doing <br/>
&gt; the best they can all the time.  I let them decide how they want to <br/>
&gt; spend <br/>
&gt; their time each and every day.  They are intelligent people and <br/>
&gt; learn what <br/>
&gt; they need to learn to do what they want to do.  I am just a <br/>
&gt; facilitator.  I <br/>
&gt; have more life experience and may have more ideas about where the <br/>
&gt; information <br/>
&gt; they need is located, someone that can help, books, museums, <br/>
&gt; classes, etc <br/>
&gt; etc.  I may be able to help them locate what it is they are <br/>
&gt; searching for.  <br/>
&gt; And we learn together.  <br/>
&gt; Just some of the thoughts rambling around in my head.<br/>
&gt; LOL<br/>

more.<br/>
