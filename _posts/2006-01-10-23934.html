<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857660362">&quot;Deb kindly asked Hannah if there was<br/>
something *she* could do to make riding lessons less angstful for her.<br/>
Hannah told her &quot;it&#39;s just today, I don&#39;t feel like riding today&quot; and<br/>
Deb accepted it. Hannah&#39;s now looking forward to her next lesson. I&#39;m<br/>
so glad I didn&#39;t put an anxiety ridden child on the back of a huge<br/>
animal -- so dangerous!! -- but instead honored her feelings for that<br/>
moment and kept the role of &quot;mom-as-protector&quot; in her heart.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was a great story, and a fabulous example as a parent being a <br/>
buffer for a child. Awesome.<br/>
