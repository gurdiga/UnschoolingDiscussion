<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-387779054">I have a question.<br/>
<br/>
What character traits do think an unschooling parent has to have, or usually has, to be the kind of parent who unschools?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean:  love and accept your kids or broad things like that.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I mean, in comparison to a working person, who lets say, doesn&#39;t have kids.<br/>
