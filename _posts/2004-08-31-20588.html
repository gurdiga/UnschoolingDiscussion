<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904460291">My 6 yo has decided that he doesn&#39;t want to grow up, he doesn&#39;t want <br/>
any responsibility for himself, he doesn&#39;t want to be strong, smart <br/>
or anything likewise &quot;grownuppy&quot;. By the way I rarely talk about <br/>
anything &quot;grown up&quot; other than you will be able to drive when your <br/>
16 if you can pass the tests to get your liscence, etc. I don&#39;t ever <br/>
tell him to &quot;grow up&quot; and frankly I think he&#39;s getting some of this <br/>
from the Cartoon Network show &quot;kids next door&quot; where the kids are <br/>
against the adults and even the teenagers. So anyhow I promised him <br/>
that I made the pancakes we had for supper &quot;especially week&quot; just <br/>
for him so I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t make him too strong, just enough <br/>
energy to get you by until the next meal. Has anyone else been <br/>
though this? I&#39;m trying to get him to talk about it but he&#39;s not <br/>
giving me any clues to this new behavior. Any advice would be <br/>
appreciated. Moza</div>

<br/>
I am still laughing about this line :-0. It was a brilliant way to go!<br/>
<br/>
When my ten year old was eight, he said he didn&#39;t ever want to be a grownup.<br/>
It seemed too stressful. That made us look at ourselves, and what we<br/>
experience and project as his parents. Yes, a reality check and a reminder<br/>
about the priorities in life (have fun! enjoy!) (not that that is what&#39;s<br/>
going on with your guy...it was for us though).<br/>
<br/>
We also asked him questions about what looked hard about being an adult, and<br/>
what he liked about being his age. We talked about ways he could keep doing<br/>
things he liked (playing chess whenever he wanted, keeping his room messy)<br/>
when he got older. We talked about how he gets to choose what he does as an<br/>
adult so that it&#39;s fun too. And we needed to have more fun as adults around<br/>
him!<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t heard him say anything for a long time like this, but I am<br/>
interested in his perception now so I&#39;m going to ask him again.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-645175328">When Sophia has fears, and I am in my best frame of<br/>
mind, I treat her fears very patiently and genuinely. <br/>
Not that the goal should be for her to &quot;get over them&quot;<br/>
(it should be for me to live in the moment with her),<br/>
but that&#39;s what happens.  She does &quot;get over them&quot; (or<br/>
mostly). <br/>
<br/>
That sounds pretty scary, I bet.  Growing up.  Just<br/>
imagine all the pressures.  The bills and jobs and<br/>
expectations and worries.   We don&#39;t really have to<br/>
imagine.  I don&#39;t anyway.  But a six year old.  Well,<br/>
I think their imaginations are among the best.  <br/>
<br/>
Have you tried taking a few days off and really<br/>
watching those Cartoon Network shows together?  Talk<br/>
about what you think about the shows and growing up ~<br/>
the realities...the good and the bad.  And your<br/>
dreams.  And your fears.  That&#39;s my best advice.  Be<br/>
real and treat his fears REAL-LY.<br/>

<br/>
My son had this too.  Well, the growing up part.  He<br/>
never said he didn&#39;t want to be strong or smart.  But<br/>
he didn&#39;t even want a birthday because that would mean<br/>
he was getting closer to being a grown-up!  He wanted<br/>
to stay 6 (or 7, I don&#39;t remember).  So I just agreed,<br/>
&quot;Okay, that&#39;s fine with me&quot;.  I told him he could just<br/>
stay 6 even with a birthday party.<br/>
<br/>
When he was willing to talk about it, he was afraid <br/>
 - he wouldn&#39;t be able to PLAY anymore<br/>
 - he wouldn&#39;t have lots of TOYS to play with<br/>
 - he would have to move out on his own<br/>
<br/>
So I told him he could live with us as long as he<br/>
wanted too.  I think this helped a lot.  I told him he<br/>
could still play and have toys.  I think he was also<br/>
afraid he&#39;d have to leave and go work somewhere.  My<br/>
dh works at home but ds remembers when dh used to go<br/>
work at an office.  He has since said he wants to work<br/>
on the computer at home like his dad.  <br/>
<br/>
He is now 8 - almost 9, and I haven&#39;t heard the &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t want to grow-up&quot; line in quite awhile.<br/>

Anyone know of a good park with playground in El Paso<br/>
or Midland/Odessa near the interstate?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450666631">Around the time my daughter was 4 or five, she would sometimes express that she wished she was still a baby; this would happen generally when more would be expected of her because of her increased maturity and capabilities.  I think we all feel that way sometimes.  I guess perhaps we just need to be aware of how we express our expectations to our children, either verbally or otherwise, and consider the possible resulting anxiety.<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck,<br/>
 <br/>
