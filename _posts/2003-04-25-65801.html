<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520558574">I just wanted to say thank you to this list for the amount of mind opening I have gleaned from it. I just rolled<br/>
<br/>
a character for Dungeons and Dragons with my kids and husband.Now in my early adult years I played d but I <br/>
<br/>
was raised Catholic so this was my first exposure to it.I have not been against or for it. I guess somewhere in my <br/>
<br/>
thinking I have not given much credit to learning coming from activities like this. I have also struggled with feelings <br/>
<br/>
of so much work to play games with them. Being exposed to the different ideas on this list has moved me in <br/>
<br/>
miraculous directions. I cannot believe the amount of natural math used in this game. My daughter looooves this <br/>
<br/>
game and has taken to figuring out modules and adventures for herself,her brothers and her sister while they are <br/>
<br/>
waiting for their dad to get home to play.<br/>
<br/>
The other cool thing is my 7 year old is teaching me how to play Yu Gi Oh. Now that has been incredible because <br/>
<br/>
of the time I get to interact with this enthusiastic, animated toothless person who makes me laugh minute after <br/>
<br/>
minute. He has a wide eyed wonder of the world that can make me young in a second. Wow I know I am gushing <br/>
<br/>
but it  is an unbelievable experience all because I was able to chance looking at learning as something beyond <br/>
<br/>
letters, numbers etc..<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling at a new level<br/>
