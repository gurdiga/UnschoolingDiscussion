<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928990861">Joel, as a public school teacher for 23 years, your description of Educationese as &quot;gobblelygook and bafflegab&quot; made me laugh out loud. When I am alone and laugh out loud, I KNOW it is funny! Not really funny in the long run, however! I taught in public schools, knowing full well that classroom education is a poor last resort for parents who just don&#39;t have time to teach their own children! I am excited now to be participating in the home education of my granddaughter. As a teacher, I participated in the search for the appropriate educational phrase for something simple. It is an ongoing thing, this search for the bafflegab that will satisfy the reader and keep him from asking more questions! I think it is done more for the purpose of making &quot;education&quot; sound &quot;professional&quot; than for any other reason. Some people really do not know what professional means!<br/>
Keep on keeping on! I really enjoy this list. Also, unless you write and tell me not to do it, I would like to post that short reference to g and b to my home list, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.heartofalabama.com">http://www.heartofalabama.com</a> We would all enjoy it.<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

&gt;Somebody should provide a service wherein you send the activities of daily living of your child and then they send you back a log with everything translated into educational gobblelygook and bafflegab.  I&#39;ve seen something like this in Growing Without Schools newsletter wherein someone did just that by which I<br/>
&gt;mean they wrote an article translating their kid&#39;s everyday play into  &gt;educational goals stated in that arcane blather educators use.  They eat it up.<br/>
&gt;And what&#39;s more it was all true.  Tossing a rock, doing somersaults, playing with Playmobile, all contain every aspect of &quot;Education&quot; and many that schools don&#39;t provide.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008981188">Dear Nancy --<br/>
<br/>
Glad to see you&#39;re out there!  After my new homeschooling book comes out<br/>
(in about a month), I&#39;m starting work on another on &quot;Teacher<br/>
Turncoats&quot;.  There will be information on it when my website goes up<br/>
(www.skylarksings.com) in about two weeks, but I thought I&#39;d send along<br/>
a snippet of description so if you know anyone...<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s true for the whole list too!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;TEACHER TURNCOATS&quot; ï¿½ I&#39;m putting together a book on schoolteachers<br/>
(mostly public school, but I&#39;ll accept material from all kinds) who have<br/>
chosen to homeschool their own kids.  Some of you may still have<br/>
continued in your teaching careers; others of you may have deserted.  I<br/>
want to know about your own teaching experiences, and what prompted you<br/>
to teach your child(ren) at home.  Was it a difficult decision for you?<br/>
If you continued schoolteaching, what kind of response did you get in<br/>
the school?  Were there things which you learned in your teacher<br/>
education that was helpful or harmful in providing a better learning<br/>
environment for your child?  Were there things the school could have<br/>
done differentily which would have convinced you to keep your child<br/>
there?  What does the decision look like in hindsight (and how are your<br/>
kids doing?)<br/>
<br/>
Again, I&#39;d love to receive your recollections and your thoughts on the<br/>
subject.  As above no names will be used in the book, though it is<br/>
possible my publisher will end up preferring full interviews with a<br/>
small number of you, so I may contact you again via e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
