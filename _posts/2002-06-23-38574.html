<div id="ygrps-yiv-373210664">&lt;&lt;For those of you who say kids will learn responsibility&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think a lot of responsibility-type behaviors depend on<br/>
personality.  Some may even be inherited.<br/>
<br/>
My kids were adopted and none of them are biologically related.  However, I<br/>
know their birthfamilies (even had siblings live with us at times) and the<br/>
kids&#39; &quot;responsibility levels&quot; tend to be closer to their birth siblings than<br/>
to their adoptive siblings.  Let me say that all the kids have lived with us<br/>
since they were newborns.  We are the only family they have ever known.<br/>
<br/>
Adriane is  &quot;Miss Responsibility&quot;.  Her room is clean, her animals cared<br/>
for, used her allowance to start a savings account to save for a trailer for<br/>
her 4-H project, when considering having her ears pierced she talked with<br/>
about 20 people to get their experiences, talked to the people who do the<br/>
piercing and paid for it herself.  She has rarely done anything we have<br/>
asked her not to.  Her birthmother is much the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Zach is &quot;Wild Man&quot;.  His room is raunchy, money burns a hole in his pocket,<br/>
he breaks or loses most things he comes in contact with.  His birthfather is<br/>
much the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Marsie is &quot;Everybody&#39;s Best Friend&quot;.  She has never met a stranger, would<br/>
think nothing of getting in the car with someone she didn&#39;t know, makes<br/>
friends everywhere she goes, has no problem &quot;mooching&quot; off acquaintances,<br/>
dismantles everything she plays with whether it is hers or not.  Her<br/>
birthsister lived with us for 8 months prior to Marsie being born and the<br/>
girls are very similar.<br/>
<br/>
Danny is &quot;Mr. Destructo&quot;.  He lives his life at full speed, is heedless of<br/>
any dangers even after being pointedly warned about them, he runs off,<br/>
constantly explores and climbs, has big falling in the floor fits whenever<br/>
any little thing doesn&#39;t happen the way he wants.  He is a carbon copy of<br/>
his brother.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle I don&#39;t know about because I have little contact with her<br/>
birthfamily.<br/>
<br/>
All my kids have had the same behavior modeled for them, the same<br/>
explanations, the same cautions about things......very different results.<br/>
