<div id="ygrps-yiv-382002663">We don&#39;t drink often - an occasional drink now and then. The kids know all<br/>
about addiction from the theoretical side. That&#39;s a comfort. When April<br/>
turned eighteen she went to a slumber party with her girlfriends (no boys)<br/>
and they bought enough booze to sink the Titanic. April came close to<br/>
poisoning herself... This was the tail end of a three month experiment with<br/>
alcohol stage during a time she was meeting and making new friends... After<br/>
her binge episode she she couldn&#39;t touch a drop of alcohol for about three<br/>
years without feeling very ill. She was then able to introduce the odd half<br/>
glass of beer, and then a half glass of spirit with cola/juice. She<br/>
invariably can&#39;t finish her drink and usually doesn&#39;t bother. It&#39;s six<br/>
years on now and she can put away a couple of glass of beer now and then.<br/>
We were rapt that her body rejected the alcohol so vehemently - it&#39;s been a<br/>
good lesson for her brothers too. We made sure she had a safe place to<br/>
experiment with alcohol (she wouldn&#39;t smoke pot because of her asthma and<br/>
hates cigarettes with a vengeance). We didn&#39;t say no or prohibit and things<br/>
worked out well. But we&#39;re not overly addictive people and we have a<br/>
history of allergies, so that probably helped.</div>
