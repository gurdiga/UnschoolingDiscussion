<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684451411">&lt;&lt; i often stay up late (like now) just to get some solitude after a <br/>
 long day with the four children.  but hubby wishes i would snuggle in with <br/>
 him....   all these needs to deal with (including my own!) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Erin,<br/>
  How do you deal with all these struggles? I was reading this note and I saw <br/>
myself! My partner sometimes doesn&#39;t understand that after being &quot;on&quot; all <br/>
day, I need to unwind and have MY time, even if it is past midnight! LOL!<br/>
I&#39;ve started putting some of my own needs on the top of my list, and I&#39;m <br/>
trying really hard to avoid feeling guilty :)<br/>

Karen,<br/>
 that is exactly what you have to do.  I just finally sat my dh down and <br/>
explained to him that I had to have some time to myself, to do nothing or a <br/>
lot, whatever I wanted.  We talked it over and he is very understanding once <br/>
I explain what is going on.  I think that he thought that I just didn&#39;t want <br/>
to be with him anymore.  WRONG, but without the discussion he didn&#39;t <br/>
understand me and I had no idea why he was so upset, he was asleep!  LOL.<br/>
