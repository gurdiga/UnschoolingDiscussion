<div id="ygrps-yiv-958498128">Something wonderful was just posted at unschooling.com yesterday, about<br/>
deschooling ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
This list is only the tip of an iceberg of information and support at<br/>
www.unschooling.com and you should definitely check all of that out!<br/>

I give up. I looked in every message board there and couldn&#39;t find the deschooling message. Where is the post?  Could you post the link here?  Thanks.<br/>
