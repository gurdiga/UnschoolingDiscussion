<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136142490">Hi. Been lurking for a while, thought I&#39;d jump in with my intro. We&#39;re a<br/>
family of natural learners, I&#39;m Cheryl, dh Jay, dd Jayme, 17 and ds<br/>
J.L., 13, with many children waiting in heaven.  We are presently, for<br/>
the past 10 years, living in Pa.  Neither of our children have ever<br/>
attended school and so far, they have decided not to let college<br/>
interfere with their learning.  We love our lifestyle of learning and<br/>
enjoy the freedom it gives.  (All of which has been  progressively<br/>
learned, as my dh and I were, at first, perfect products of public<br/>
schooling.)  Although I personally feel I am way over 40 years behind in<br/>
discovering this freedom and constantly want to know *everything*,<br/>
yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
FYI for those that worry as I did in the beginning. (from reading some<br/>
emails.)  My children were both different from myself in that they<br/>
weren&#39;t reading &quot;steadily&quot; until the age of 11 and 12 respectively.<br/>
When I first worried about this, my dh informed me that he never<br/>
&quot;enjoyed&quot; reading and read poorly until he found Sci Fi books in the<br/>
eleventh grade.  My younger sis and db both admonished me for worrying<br/>
about reading and spelling.  Reminding me that they also were poor<br/>
readers and spellers &quot;during school years&quot;.  However they both went on<br/>
in life and have great careers and families.  Picking up what they<br/>
needed when they had a &quot;use&quot; for it.<br/>
<br/>
Jayme became a voracious reader at age 11.  However, my dd has been only<br/>
been enjoying writing for the last 3 years since finding a friend who<br/>
became her email pal.  This was also when her spelling improved as she<br/>
&quot;had a desire/need&quot; to be understood.  She&#39;d also kept very sporadic<br/>
journals from a young age but only recently *enjoyed* writing and is<br/>
keeping her journal regularly these days.<br/>
<br/>
My ds, this year, has found writing lists for his pokemon cards<br/>
interesting.  I&#39;ve seen amazing improvements in his handwriting.  One<br/>
day recently, he was drawing and came running downstairs yelling, &quot;Look,<br/>
my fine motor skill have kicked in, I can draw!&quot;  LOL  It was true, he<br/>
had noticed that he was able to control his hand and was now able to do<br/>
better curves.  Before this day, his drawings, although good, were done<br/>
on graph paper and consisted of mechanical type drawings of robots,<br/>
planes, etc.  His reading has been improving steadily as well.  He is<br/>
more the &quot;technical book&quot; style reader.  Give me the information, I&#39;m<br/>
not here to loligag, type.  *I&#39;ve read that a child should acquire fine<br/>
motor skills before reading, otherwise learning is a pain and not well<br/>
retained.*<br/>
<br/>
We are a magazine family as well as books.  I&#39;ve enjoyed &quot;HEM&quot; for<br/>
several years now.  Hi, Helen.  We miss &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;<br/>
tremendously.  I didn&#39;t notice any mention lately of the recently<br/>
started magazine &quot;Life Learning&quot; nor did I see it in the archives.  Hope<br/>
it&#39;s ok to talk about it and some of their articles.(?)<br/>
<br/>
I received my second copy of this magazine last week.  It is<br/>
delightful.  Though not as thick yet as others, so far I have been<br/>
thoroughly enjoying it.  Of course, anyone that knows me, early on<br/>
realizes I&#39;m extremely partial to John Taylor Gatto.  As the magazine&#39;s<br/>
writers include this well known author and some of Pennsylvania&#39;s own,<br/>
such as Christine Gable from Natural Learners Center in Marietta, I<br/>
wanted to pass copies out to my relatives and friends.  I called the<br/>
company when I received my sample and asked if they could send me more<br/>
sample copies for the members of my monthly support group meeting.  They<br/>
did and it was really well received by my group.<br/>
<br/>
In the first issue, John makes no bones about schools and the &quot;school at<br/>
home&quot; mentality.  I don&#39;t know if John&#39;s article from the March/April<br/>
magazine titled, &quot;Schools Do Violence to Children...& Society&quot; is posted<br/>
somewhere online, but it was spectacular, as his all are. ;-)  Once<br/>
again laying out where schools went wrong and the multitude of error<br/>
stacked upon error.  The worst mistake being the connection of school to<br/>
work.  Does STW- School to Work sound familiar?  It&#39;s REAL prevalent<br/>
<br/>
here in Pa.  So is their switching from Diploma&#39;s to Certificates of<br/>
Mastery. :-(<br/>
<br/>
The same months issue included an article by Jan Hunt, &quot;&#39;Leaning<br/>
Disability&#39; A Rose by Another Name&quot;.  I love the opening analogy of a<br/>
plant nursery assistant trying to make all the roses bloom the same<br/>
week.  Hah, the entire article was good, but the opening was hilarious.<br/>
So true.<br/>
<br/>
The May/June issue includes Wendy Presnitz&#39;s article &quot;College...How to<br/>
Get There and If You Need to Go&quot;  She speaks of  colleges recruiting<br/>
self-educated students and some alternative, progressive post-secondary<br/>
institutions.  I was glad to see mentioned that not all natural learners<br/>
care to go to college.  I&#39;ve noticed the tendency among autodidacts to<br/>
question the &quot;need&quot; for higher facilities of *indoctrination*.  Many<br/>
I&#39;ve met are finding no reason to change their life style of natural<br/>
learning and choose as she said, &quot;a life of simplicity&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this company will grow.  They already have added to their<br/>
online sight.  I hope in the future, they will post online some of the<br/>
magazine&#39;s articles.  The link to: FAQ About Self-Directed Learning page<br/>
is now working:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/faq.html">http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/faq.html</a><br/>
It&#39;s a great magazine.  Great authors, well written materials and sites.<br/>
www.autodidactic.com is just one.<br/>
It&#39;s right up this family&#39;s alley.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s it for now.<br/>

I love when kids&#39; concepts and vocabulary are ahead of their &quot;abilities&quot; (in <br/>
school lingo).  I&#39;m pretty sure most educators would say any neurologically <br/>
sound kid without fine motor skills &quot;isn&#39;t old enough&quot; to know what &quot;fine <br/>
motor skills&quot; are.  <br/>

that have been held at our home.  Or maybe its the endless counseling phone<br/>
calls he&#39;s overheard.  It is amazing what our children pick up from adults when<br/>
they&#39;re not age segregated.<br/>
Reminds me of all the &quot;expert&quot; doctors that for ten years told me I&#39;d &quot;never&quot; be<br/>
able to carry a child to full term due to a partially divided uterus.  I was<br/>
told I&#39;d never go past two months.  Then I had five births, four of them full<br/>
term children.<br/>
Nope, I guess &quot;the experts&quot; don&#39;t know everything.<br/>
