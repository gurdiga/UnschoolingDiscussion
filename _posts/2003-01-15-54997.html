daughter finished first grade, after I stumbled across an article on <br/>
homeschooling by Becky Rupp, in an organic/alternativeish/liberal magazine <br/>
called &quot;Harrowsmith&quot; and I was bonked on the head (the apple hit me &lt;g&gt;) with <br/>
the amazing discovery that--gasp!--left-wing, secular, alternative, <br/>
feministic types homeschooled, too!  Then I discovered HEM, AOL (when it was <br/>
Homeschool Paradise), lots of great women friends, and it&#39;s been full speed <br/>
ahead, since then.  <br/>
<br/>
  Before I became a career mother, I was a Ph.D. candidate in American <br/>
Studies (no dissertation completed &lt;eg&gt;), and taught for about a decade.  I <br/>
removed my daughter from school for &quot;educational excellence&quot; reasons, but <br/>
we&#39;ve clearly become lifelong unschooling/attachment parenting/non-coercive <br/>
educational ideologues, since then.  Dh is a semi-employed counselor--both <br/>
mental health and vocational rehabilitation. &lt;sigh..$$$ isn&#39;t our best friend&gt;<br/>
  I take care of my invalid but (thankfully) wonderfully interesting parents <br/>
and thus have become a member of the &quot;sandwich generation.&quot;  Ellie is an <br/>
artist, with a passion for social justice and liberal politics, and piano.  <br/>
Grace is a poet, instigator, violinist, and Wild Child like her Mom <br/>
was.....We have five bad cats, one sweet Corgi dog, two turtles, a homocidal <br/>
lovebird, and a lop-eared bunny.  When we have money and time, we camp and <br/>
travel everywhere we can get to (all of us have wanderlust in our hearts.)  <br/>
I&#39;m currently VERY interested in supporting heritage seed saving efforts, <br/>
sustainable agriculture, &quot;slow food&quot;, artisan/small farm food <br/>
efforts....__Fast Food Nation__has become my bible. ;-)   I help my dad with <br/>
his Green Party protests and organizational efforts, but am still an ever <br/>
hopeful yellow dog democrat.  I grow lots of perennial flowers and sigh over <br/>
how much I miss my farm in Central Iowa, where the soil was a black as night <br/>
and as rich as Donald Trump. <br/>

&quot;To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we are <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-52322975">Becky I wish you lived in my neighborhood! I am a home school <br/>
advocate (8 years and four boys, two are in college now) who lives <br/>
in the midst of an ultra conservative region of the country where <br/>
the main objective of home schooling is based on ultra conservative <br/>
religious beliefs that tend to ostrasize those who are not like <br/>
thinkers. <br/>
<br/>
My ultra liberal pascifist mentality marginalizes the heck of my <br/>
family in the home school circles. Mainstream is just to leming <br/>
oriented so here I sit wondering how I can generate interest in this <br/>
area toward a home school support group with unschool focus.<br/>
<br/>
I am still actively involved with the education of my 11 and 14 year <br/>
old sons but wish I could talk to someone who has similar ideas. <br/>
Perhaps that is why I am here?<br/>
