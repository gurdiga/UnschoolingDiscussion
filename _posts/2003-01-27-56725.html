&gt; Looking for anyone with any gun knowledge who might know how to go about<br/>
&gt; getting one cheaper.  I would just say forget it, but Zach is having soooo<br/>
&gt; much fun, I want to try to work this out if we can.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I clipped your message and sent it over to my husband, Julie, he&#39;s our<br/>
resident gun nut. :) He&#39;s an expert on handguns, not rifles, but he might<br/>
have some ideas about cheaper places to buy, and I asked him to email you<br/>
privately.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518603966">&lt;&lt;Does it have to be an over and under?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think so and yes that is what makes it so expensive.  The kids are<br/>
shooting skeet and at times, two birds will go at the same time so an over<br/>
and under is much faster than a regular shotgun.  But I talked with my Dad,<br/>
a police officer and Pam Hartley&#39;s husband was nice enough to give me a line<br/>
on a gun auction  (Thanks Wally) so maybe we&#39;re in business.<br/>
