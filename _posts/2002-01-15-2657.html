<div id="ygrps-yiv-632034779">I first learned about German childrearing in education courses, reading what <br/>
psychologists (mostly German or German/Austrian trained then) wrote, and <br/>
thinking they were mean.<br/>
<br/>
Then several years ago I read Alice Millers&#39; _For Your Own Good_, with lots <br/>
about Hitler.<br/>
<br/>
This site is very scary, but might be worth looking at for those who are <br/>
considering what is natural and what we should avoid as parents, and to <br/>
consider that some people raised this way are still living great-grandparents <br/>
(or younger).<br/>
<br/>
-=-German family maxims described the lack of love of mothers toward their <br/>
children, saying tenderness was &quot;generally not part of the mother&#39;s <br/>
character. Just as she kept her children short on food and clothing, she also <br/>
was short on fondling and tenderness [feeling] the children should regard <br/>
themselves as useless weeds and be grateful that they were tolerated.&quot;285 <br/>
Children were expected to give love to their parents, not the parents to <br/>
their children: &quot;We always appeared trembling before our parents, hoping that <br/>
our official kiss of their hands would be accepted&quot;286 One boy reported his <br/>
mother once dropped a word of praise, saying to someone that &quot;He is good and <br/>
well-liked,&quot; so that the boy remembered it all his life &quot;because the words <br/>
were totally new sounds to my ear.&quot;287 But kind words were rare in German <br/>
homes, so most Germans remembered &quot;no tender word, no caresses, only fear&quot;288 <br/>
and childhood was &quot;joyless,&quot; &quot;so immeasurably sad that you could not fathom <br/>
it.&quot;289 Yet this hatred of children in German families was not something that <br/>
they felt guilty about. German parents endlessly impressed upon the children <br/>
their pride in their family atmosphere of hatred. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be loved,&quot; <br/>
said one typical father, &quot;I want to be feared!&quot;290 Another father summed up <br/>
his feelings about family discipline as follows: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is good to hate. To hate is strong, manly. It makes the blood flow. It <br/>
makes one alert. It is necessary for keeping up the fighting instincts. To <br/>
love is feebleness. It enervates. You see all the nations that talk of love <br/>
as the keynote of life are weak, degenerate. Germany is the most powerful <br/>
nation in the world because she hates. When you hate, you eat well, sleep <br/>
well, work well, fight well.291&quot;  -=-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-975344602">I am learning something new every day here.<br/>
Yesterday I was quite shocked by some of the stuff I read from Joyce&#39;s link she provided on nursing and sexual stimulation and how it quite common in some cultures. Never head of THAT!<br/>
<br/>
The German childrearing seems to lean in the complete opposite direction:<br/>
&lt;snip&gt; &quot;saying tenderness was &quot;generally not part of the mother&#39;s character. Just as she kept her children short on food and clothing, she also was short on fondling and tenderness ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, I am somewhere in the middle!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-569885747">As dismal as finding things like this can be, on the other hand it gives<br/>
me hope, hope that if only people get it together to raise the world&#39;s<br/>
children lovingly then world peace could actually be achieved. I so<br/>
believe that raising children in violence creates a violent world.<br/>
