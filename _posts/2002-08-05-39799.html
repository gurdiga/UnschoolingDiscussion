<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband and I loved our son&#39;s little speech mistakes.  Things like<br/>
am-i-nal and maz-a-gine.  I never corrected them...they were his last bit of<br/>
cuteness.  (My son is intense, wonderful, etc., but not cute.)<br/>
<br/>
I can still see the fury in his eyes the day he realized, reading those two<br/>
words in the same sentence, that he had been saying them wrong all this<br/>
time, and that I had LET him say them that way.  It took him less than 24<br/>
hours to purge them out of his vocabulary.<br/>
<br/>
It took just slightly longer for him to forgive me!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-156012335">Here&#39;s another one my middle daughter just reminded me<br/>
of-,&quot;Thinger&quot; for &quot;finger&quot;.  The same two out of three<br/>
daughters who pronounced &quot;Tim Hortons&quot; as &quot;Tim<br/>
Portons&quot;, were pronouncing it this way. The strange<br/>
thing is, I didn&#39;t realize it. My 11 year old was<br/>
pronouncing them this way up until about a year ago.<br/>
