<div id="ygrps-yiv-52150303">Thank you all for your responses to my question regarding my brother and<br/>
his wife Unschooling their children.  The reason that I ask is because I am<br/>
still learning all about it myself and haven&#39;t even figured out the words<br/>
to say why I am going to start it, just that I know it is right for us.<br/>
My brother and his wife never went to high school and are now in their 30&#39;s<br/>
with two boys age 6 and 10.  They both work but I think if they felt they<br/>
could do better for their kids educationally, one of them would quit to do<br/>
that.  They are in a position of having such a lack of education themselves<br/>
(including the fact that my brother was labeled learning disabled in grade<br/>
school) that considering the difficulty that their sons have had in school,<br/>
feel that they need to do everything that they can to help them.....ie,<br/>
special ed teacher, counselors, etc.  They live in MN and I live in FL so<br/>
there is little I can do to help them out except give them information and<br/>
I want to be able to give it to them clearly so that they can make an<br/>
informed choice.<br/>
I am still learning myself as I read all your posts and can&#39;t wait till the<br/>
conference in October.  They have not asked me about this as we do not live<br/>
in the same state and do not talk about our kids education very often but I<br/>
want to at least share my info with them and someone else&#39;s similar<br/>
experience so that they can at least relate.<br/>
Thanks for all your help and I will check out the websites that you<br/>
suggested so far.<br/>
<br/>
