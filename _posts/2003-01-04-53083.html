rollerblading. They also have a gymnastics camp. All in the beautiful Penn&#39;s <br/>
Valley. Indoor and outdoor parks. Pool, horseback riding, you name it. <br/>
<br/>
My &#39;puter&#39;s slow or I&#39;d give you the site. Plug in &quot;Woodward skateboard&quot; in <br/>
Google; you&#39;ll get it.<br/>
