&gt; We live in Monroe, WA. Maybe we will see yah next time<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Small world - my hubby and I were married in Monroe, WA. In the big old<br/>
brick Methodist church on the street coming into town from Duvall (can&#39;t<br/>
remember the highway number). We went to church there for years, but lived<br/>
in Duvall. Also used to fly in and out of the little airport there from time<br/>
to time, it&#39;s a hairy approach coming in right over the fairgrounds. Great<br/>
town!<br/>
