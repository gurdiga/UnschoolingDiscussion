&gt; true - at least here in the North East.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, yes, I do think that, since I wrote it!  &lt;g&gt;  But it&#39;s interesting to<br/>
consider that perhaps it&#39;s not true everywhere.  Maybe I shouldn&#39;t assume<br/>
that everywhere is the same!<br/>
<br/>
I guess I was figuring that with kids back in school and parents working,<br/>
fall, especially shortly after labor day, would be pretty quiet for<br/>
travelling.  <br/>
<br/>
I just want to come to the Northeast, since I&#39;ve never been there!  So pick<br/>
a time and schedule a conference!  :)<br/>

work pretty hard on it.  Then, she would point to an aspect of it and say <br/>
to me, &quot;Do you like this here?&quot;  I used to shake my head in wonder.  What a <br/>
question!<br/>
