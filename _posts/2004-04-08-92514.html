<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964146159">Well, I DO know what an indirect object is, and truly have no desire to <br/>
acquire livestock.<br/>
<br/>
And, well, figs don&#39;t fly. PIGS fly. You&#39;d think you Livestock chicks would <br/>
know that.<br/>
<br/>
Oh...while I do know what an indirect object is, I don&#39;t think anyone really <br/>
NEEDS to know what it is. In fact, I have never been asked to diagram a <br/>
sentence in real life. It&#39;s stupid.<br/>

are plugged in that hole.<br/>
<br/>
When pigs fly is a different idiom.  <br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s what about flying livestock, poetry from my childhood:<br/>
<br/>
Birdie, birdie in the sky<br/>
Why you do dat in my eye?<br/>
Me no laugh, me no cry;<br/>
Me just glad that cows don&#39;t fly.<br/>
<br/>
and from Shakespeare<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Where the bee sucks, there suck I<br/>
In a cowslip&#39;s bell I lie<br/>
There I couch when owls to cry<br/>
On a bat&#39;s back I do fly <br/>
After summer merrily...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But when Keith and I were young and in a madrigal group, we taught all our <br/>
friends to sing &quot;there I crouch when cows do fly&quot; on the third line, when we <br/>
weren&#39;t performing, which made performances harder, and more fun.<br/>

<br/>
From my youth:<br/>
<br/>
Spring is sprung,<br/>
The grass is riz.<br/>
I wonder where the flowers is?<br/>
The bird is on the wing.<br/>
Isn&#39;t that absurd -<br/>
I always thought the wing was on the bird.<br/>
