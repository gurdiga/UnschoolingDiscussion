&lt;&lt; &quot;Make sure you have clean undies on in case<br/>
 you are hit by a car&quot; Apparently that is standard triage procedure - Check<br/>
 her blood pressure, vital stats and undies... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I actually WAS in a car wreck this past fall.  When we got to the hospital I <br/>
was in AGONIES of embarrassment because -I&#39;m still blushing-I wasn&#39;t wearing <br/>
any!  LOL  I was 30 weeks pregnant and was just too big for regular undies (I <br/>
couldn&#39;t even wear them UNDER my belly) and hadn&#39;t gotten to the store for <br/>
maternity undies.  Yikes.  Although, to be truthful, my regular undies are <br/>
normally so tatty that going au naturel isn&#39;t that much more embarrassing.  I <br/>
guess it&#39;s a sign of middle age and complacency - I don&#39;t buy those slinky <br/>
matching bras and panties anymore.  (I HATE those ridiculous Victoria&#39;s <br/>
Secret commercials) And yes, now that I&#39;m not pregnant I DO wear underwear!  <br/>
