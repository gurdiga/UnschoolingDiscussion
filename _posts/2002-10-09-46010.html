&lt;&lt; And, frankly, none of us are being paid a salary here. We have our own<br/>
 opinions. If I just disagree that calling a child specifically &quot;lazy&quot; is an<br/>
 okay thing, I am under no obligation to say it is &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Pam, except I didn&#39;t notice where Myranda said she ever called <br/>
her son lazy,  with the exception of her post, which she apologized for <br/>
sounding negative in.<br/>
I do agree that it could come through to the child if we view them as &quot;lazy&quot; <br/>
or any other number of labels.<br/>
But, I didn&#39;t read where she thought calling him lazy was acceptable AND she <br/>
mentioned that they don&#39;t call him lazybones very often, just a term used in <br/>
the family.<br/>
We have terms like that.<br/>
Dh and I call each other &quot;goober&quot;.<br/>
We get some strange looks, but in our family it&#39;s equal to sweetie or honey.<br/>
&quot;Hey goober, will you hand me that book?&quot;<br/>
And we aren&#39;t really trying to call each other peanuts!! lol<br/>
I think that names and labels can be very harmful, and the child can smile <br/>
and laugh themselves right through some hurtful things. Happened to me. My <br/>
Dad brought home a button once that said &quot;second best, that&#39;s for me&quot; because <br/>
they always felt I was a bit &quot;lazy&quot; about schoolwork and such.<br/>
It hurt a little. Not too bad, because I was defiant and wore it anyway. But <br/>
I then knew that my Dad saw me that way, and it bothered me, even though it <br/>
was just a joke.<br/>
So it&#39;s good to examine the &quot;fun&quot; things in our own families and make sure we <br/>
aren&#39;t acting from only our point of view, but thinking of how the other <br/>
person may be taking it.<br/>
Jared got really upset over his nickname &quot;Science&quot;.<br/>
Yep, they nicknamed him science guy because he was smart and curious about <br/>
scientific type stuff. It bugged the heck out of him. I had to get very mean <br/>
with dh and bil over it because they thought it was SO funny. And they <br/>
couldn&#39;t understand why it bugged him because they were paying a compliment <br/>
in their minds.<br/>
But he hated it, and that&#39;s really all that mattered.<br/>
They finally let up when I got mad.<br/>
And I tried to help Jared find ways to stand up for himself. Men can be such <br/>
dunderheads sometimes (not the ones here...just in our family, lol)<br/>
And sometimes Trevor will tell me I&#39;m being a doofbean when I am being <br/>
forgetfull. Said with fun and lightheartedness it doesn&#39;t bother anyone that <br/>
I can tell.<br/>
And they aren&#39;t afraid to tell me if it does.<br/>
So doofbean or goober are ok with everyone, but don&#39;t dare say &quot;science&quot;!!!<br/>
