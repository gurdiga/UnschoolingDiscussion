<div id="ygrps-yiv-84432772">Hi. I have been no mail for several months since I moved to Austin, <br/>
TX.  I recently switched to Daily Digest to ease back into my groups <br/>
and I found many of your posts too interesting too miss out on!  So <br/>
I&#39;m back.  I probably wasn&#39;t too involved before because I&#39;m a bit of <br/>
a group junkie and often found myself overwhelmed with emails.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway......my name is Angela and I have 2 girls (4.25 yrs & 22 <br/>
months) and I&#39;m expecting #3 in early March.  I am enjoying <br/>
unschooling my girls even at this young age.  I finally started to <br/>
get it when my oldest dd didn&#39;t show any interest in learning her <br/>
numbers until she wanted to know what time it was!  She also taught <br/>
herself to swim this summer (creating her own unique stroke, of <br/>
course).  I love observing their little minds at work.<br/>
<br/>
Nice to be back- <br/>
Angela McGinn</div>
