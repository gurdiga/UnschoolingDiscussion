<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782085258">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to add my two cents worth. Feeling things intensely,<br/>
Hyperactivity,  ADD can be complicated.  I have another suggestion.<br/>
Sometimes children are also reacting to the cleaning products in their<br/>
home that have things such as bleach, ammonia, formaldehyde, cresols,<br/>
dioxin.....  If often helps getting natural organic cleaners.<br/>
Increasing water intake.   We also have are son on well absorbed<br/>
vitamins, antioxidants and ginkgo (small amount).  Read up on ginkgo, to<br/>
much is not good for children.   I took him off the antioxidant and<br/>
ginkgo once and he asked to have it back as he felt more like himself.<br/>
Of course, some children just feel things more intensely and aren&#39;t we<br/>
glad we homeschool them!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings and Success,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659516582">how old is your son, sherry? I had wondered about<br/>
gingko. but I just haven&#39;t looked into it much. I<br/>
haven&#39;t read anything on it yet, though, except the<br/>
warnings on the &quot;grown up&quot; bottles we&#39;ve had. <br/>
