&gt;    I&#39;m just wondering if you realize how you are beating people down and not<br/>
&gt; letting them express themselves if they don&#39;t wholly agree with you (even the<br/>
&gt; brand spanking new unschoolers who come her for help).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra has no power here to &quot;not let&quot; people express themselves (nor do I,<br/>
nor does anyone that I know of except Joyce the Moderator -- sounds like a<br/>
feudal title, Joyce &lt;g&gt; -- or Helen the Listowner, and they use their power<br/>
with a very light hand. Too light, sometimes, for my grouchy taste &lt;g&gt; but<br/>
it is their list and their call, I just hang out here. ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; FYI, unschooling is<br/>
&gt; not only done one way ... and another FYI, one can be a christian and an<br/>
&gt; unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends on what you mean by &quot;one way&quot; -- if you mean that you can<br/>
unschool &quot;except for math&quot;, I think you&#39;re wrong. If you mean that some<br/>
unschoolers sleep later and some go to bed earlier, I think you&#39;re right. If<br/>
you mean one &quot;can be a Christian&quot; and hit their children and unschool, I<br/>
think you&#39;re wrong. If you mean one can take what Jesus modelled, kindness<br/>
and compassion, and believe he is the Son of God and still unschool, I think<br/>
you&#39;re right.<br/>
<br/>
I also haven&#39;t seen Sandra say you can&#39;t be a Christian and unschool. I also<br/>
happen to think she wouldn&#39;t say such, as probably some of her friends here<br/>
are Christians who unschool.<br/>

&gt; way to unschooling. Someone mentioned changing the yahoo description, you<br/>
&gt; really should consider it, this is not a welcoming, supportive list!<br/>

some of his followers who cause me internal bleeding (not to mention what<br/>
they do to their children).<br/>
<br/>
The one sure way to cease all dialog and not let anyone hear your point of<br/>
view is to storm out. Don&#39;t let the door hit you on your way by. ;) If you<br/>
think leaving will stop the conversation here, it grieves me to disillusion<br/>
you. Pretending we&#39;re not here talking won&#39;t stop us from helping other<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I personally like their light hand. :)  Discussion lists that are <br/>
overly moderated are no fun.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve checked out other unschooling lists and other unschooling <br/>
forums.  Nothing comes close to this one for unschooling advice or <br/>
intellectually stimulating conversation.  I am uncomfortable <br/>
sometimes with the low tolerance on this list towards Christianity.  <br/>
It is openly scoffed at and made fun of, yet if a Christian openly <br/>
scoffed at or made fun of pantheism, atheism, or the new age <br/>
movement, you can bet it wouldn&#39;t be well tolerated.  Sandra is <br/>
great.  The list wouldn&#39;t be the same without her insight.  She is <br/>
blunt and honest about her opinions, but her posts don&#39;t have the <br/>
iciness in them that some others occasionally do.  Except for the <br/>
occasional jab at Christianity, I&#39;ve never felt anything but benefit <br/>
from her posts.  Even the jabs at Christianity wouldn&#39;t be a problem <br/>
with me if jabs at other belief systems were equally tolerated on the <br/>
list in general.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you&#39;re right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to comment on Christian unschooling.  I&#39;m a Christian and I&#39;m <br/>
an unschooler.  However, there aren&#39;t any good resources out there <br/>
that I&#39;ve seen that are specifically for the Christian unschooler.  <br/>
The Christian Unschooling book is good for helping Abeka <br/>
homeschoolers relax, but it&#39;s more about relaxed or ecclectic <br/>
homeschooling as opposed to unschooling.  It talks about unit studies <br/>
and stuff.  Christian unschooling lists also are usually more relaxed <br/>
homeschooling lists.  I think there&#39;s a new Christian unschooling <br/>
book coming out soon, so maybe that will be better. <br/>
<br/>
Ok, you&#39;ve got me thinking about the can&#39;t spank and be a true <br/>
unschooler thing.  I have to think about it a lot, and it might take <br/>
a couple of months. &lt;g&gt;  I still won&#39;t agree that spanking equals <br/>
abuse, but if this comes up again in a few months, maybe I&#39;ll agree <br/>
with you on the spanking/unschooling thing.  Or maybe not, we&#39;ll see. <br/>

religious folks of His day either. <br/>

&gt; sometimes with the low tolerance on this list towards Christianity.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that Christian Homeschoolers and Christians-in-general in American<br/>
society are under the same burden as white males -- basically, they have so<br/>
much power already (in government, in business, in society, in our smaller<br/>
society of homeschooling) that, while not nice and probably not actually<br/>
helpful, poking fun in that general direction is considered more socially<br/>
acceptable than kicking the guy (the pagan unschooler, the African-American<br/>
next door, the woman in the workplace) who&#39;s already down.<br/>
<br/>
Some of it is stuff that some Christian homeschoolers DO bring on<br/>
themselves. When HSLDA exists and is powerful, when Michael Farris exists<br/>
and is powerful, when large statement-of-faith-requiring southern<br/>
homeschooling umbrellas exist and are powerful, pointing this out and<br/>
listing the ways it&#39;s unhealthy isn&#39;t low tolerance, it&#39;s fighting for the<br/>
survival of those not of that mindset, because these are not &quot;you say<br/>
tomayto, I say tomahto&quot; kinda people. They won&#39;t just live and let live.<br/>
(Sidebar: Which is a great deal of the problem and the<br/>
difference-in-tolerance, too: pagan, Jewish, Buddhist, atheist homeschoolers<br/>
are not looking for converts to their faith or lack of it. There is no<br/>
blatant or hidden agenda.)<br/>
<br/>
Here on this list, Christian homeschooling/unschooling is the minority (at<br/>
least the fundamental-Christian types of homeschooling that are actually<br/>
being held up as doing harmful things to homeschooling in general and their<br/>
own families in particular), but I&#39;m betting there are still lots of people<br/>
here who would define themselves as Christians. They may not be speaking up<br/>
out of fear of being yelled at, but I think it more likely that many don&#39;t<br/>
speak up &quot;for the side&quot; because they think that part of &quot;the side&quot; is just<br/>
wrong and can&#39;t and won&#39;t defend it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a cradle Catholic -- the sorts of Christians Sandra talks about don&#39;t<br/>
think I&#39;m a Christian, but non-Christians and Catholics themselves would say<br/>
I am, by birth and somewhat by inclination (G-d and I are still working that<br/>
part out &lt;g&gt;) -- and I can&#39;t and won&#39;t defend what fundamentalist (for lack<br/>
of a better term) Christians do. I lack the zeal or interest to leap into<br/>
the discussions much, but never have I felt as a sorta-Catholic-Christian<br/>
that I personally am being ostracized or attacked or mocked for my beliefs.<br/>

The only jab-worthy large group within &quot;the homeschooling movement&quot; is the <br/>
Christian homeschoolers.   They very largely disapprove of an belittle <br/>

None of the above has anything to do with Jesus or with Christianity as a <br/>

rulership)  to become an ascetic.<br/>
<br/>
The memory is fading ;-) but the gist of the story goes that someone<br/>
prophesied to Siddhartha&#39;s father that his son would either become the<br/>
greatest ascetic or the greatest leader. Prefering king as a career path for<br/>
his son ;-) Siddhartha&#39;s father was determined that his son would never<br/>
experience any of the saddness of life so there would be no reason to become<br/>
an ascetic. He lived a protected life in the palace. If he ever left,<br/>
runners were sent ahead to remove anything that might upset him. He married.<br/>
Had a child. (Or children?)<br/>
<br/>
Then one day he went out without things being cleared for him and he saw the<br/>
4 things over 4 days that he wasn&#39;t supposed to see: a sick man, an old man,<br/>
a dead man, and an ascetic.<br/>
<br/>
The ascetic said he&#39;d become an ascetic because of all the suffering in the<br/>
world. This so disturbed Siddhartha that after many days of depression he<br/>
left behind everything -- including his heavy earings that had deformed his<br/>
earlobes (a sign of wealth) that are usually represented in images of him --<br/>
to wander the land as an ascetic. He devoted himself to it and during one<br/>
fast nearly died before someone fed him. This revived him enough for him to<br/>
meditate beneath a Bo Tree where he became enlightened. What he realized was<br/>
that neither end of the spectrum that he&#39;d experienced was the proper path,<br/>
that there was a Middle Path or Middle Way (which is what his teachings are<br/>
called).<br/>
<br/>
And so he became The Buddha.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve never known how Christians could merrily avoid looking at <br/>

<br/>
Jesus&#39; ministry on earth lasted three years (ages 30-33).  I don&#39;t <br/>
think the apostles &quot;left&quot; their families for good during that time.  <br/>
Maybe they left from time to time like a traveling salesperson goes <br/>
on the road.  And I think they continued with their families after <br/>
Jesus was gone.<br/>
<br/>
John the Baptizer had disciples also.  It must have been common in <br/>
those days for prophets and teachers to have a following of <br/>
disciples.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a Bible story where Jesus&#39;s disciples went to visit Peter&#39;s <br/>
wife.  She was sick but they healed her and she got up to prepare a <br/>
meal for them.  She couldn&#39;t have been too mad at Jesus.  (I can&#39;t <br/>
find the reference offhand, but if anyone is interested I&#39;ll keep <br/>
looking.)<br/>
<br/>
Also James and John must not have been married at that time.  Their <br/>
mother went to Jesus to ask that they be allowed to sit at his right <br/>
and left hand when he took his throne.  She must appreciated Jesus&#39; <br/>
influence on her sons, known as the &quot;sons of thunder&quot;.<br/>

not seeing anything anti-family in Jesus&#39; teachings<br/>
although Jesus did recommend that we put a love of God ahead of our <br/>
family </span></blockquote></div>
