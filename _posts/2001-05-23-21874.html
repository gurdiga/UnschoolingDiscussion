 I wish they hadn&#39;t blocked pulibcation of the alternative Gone with the<br/>
 Wind, told from the point of view of Mammy&#39;s daughter (Scarlett&#39;s<br/>
 half-sister.)  I would have been fascinated to read it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Wow, I must have somehow missed this and I&#39;ve read the book half a dozen <br/>
&gt;times! Tell me about this...Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The new book, which the courts have ruled may not be published, is titled<br/>
_The Wind Done Gone_.  I don&#39;t remember the author&#39;s name.  The ruling came<br/>
just recently, which is how I happened to read about it in the newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that this book paints a completely different picture of the<br/>
pre-war South than _Gone with the Wind_.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m starting to wonder if Margaret Mitchell read a little too much<br/>
Elsie Dinesmore when she was young and uncritical.   Hmmm.<br/>
