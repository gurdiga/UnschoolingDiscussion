Homeschooing parents do not have to teach the androgyny demanded by  <br/>
radical feminism.  They are free to teach boys and girls separately and  <br/>
differently and let their boys enjoy plenty of recess to work off their  <br/>
excess energy and avoid giving them Ritalin to make them behave like  <br/>
girls.<br/>

Homeschoolers do not have to take a course every year in Diversity, the  <br/>
code word for gay rights, as is now mandated K-12 by the California  <br/>
State Legislature.  Parent educators are free to teach that it is OK to  <br/>
be judgmental about illegal and immoral acts.<br/>
This is why we homeschool. We didn&#39;t want the kid to turn out queer.<br/>

kids to be judgemental about them surely?<br/>
