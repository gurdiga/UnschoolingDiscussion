  The only really limit us in that they ask us to keep our advice in accord with their philosophy, which only makes sense.  If we want to offer other advice, then we should start our own parenting group and not align ourselves with API.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

Wouldn&#39;t THAT be something: if we could get people to spew ONLY unschooling advice or (if they won&#39;t,...) start their own groups and not align themselves with *us*?! &lt;BWEG&gt;<br/>
