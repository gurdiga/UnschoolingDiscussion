A man was riding on a crowded bus, standing room only. The bus stopped<br/>
  and an elderly lady got on carrying a large picnic basket. She stood right<br/>
in front of the man and grabbed the overhead rail so the picnic basket<br/>
  was above the man&#39;s head.<br/>
<br/>
Being a gentleman, he offered his seat to her. She quickly declined as<br/>
she was only going a short distance.<br/>
<br/>
Soon the picnic basket began to leak. The man felt something drop<br/>
on top of his head. As he looked up it hit beside his nose and ran down<br/>
  across his lips. He tasted it, looked up at the lady and asked, &quot;Pickles?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She replied, &quot;No, no, puppies.....&quot;<br/>
