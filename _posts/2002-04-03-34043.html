<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347850353">I&#39;ve really enjoyed the posts on what&#39;s happening in people&#39;s unschooled<br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
In our recent days,  oldest dd,  Katy,  has listened to Harriet the Spy on<br/>
tape.   She&#39;s now into The Toothepaste Millionaire.  And we&#39;re reading Nancy<br/>
Drew,   Mystery at Lilac Inn together.   Last week something (I can&#39;t<br/>
remember what - I think she found a partially melted crayon) prompted her to<br/>
ask what crayons are made of - I&#39;ve &lt;shamefully&gt; been slow in helping her<br/>
find resources for this,  though she&#39;s coming up with some of her own<br/>
&#39;hypotheses&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
All four have been exploring the world of balance as they have been trying<br/>
out some roller skating - even the 16 month old wanted to do this.  Abby,<br/>
7yo dd,  wanted to move up to a in-line scooter. She has been saving her<br/>
spending money from her paper route and I noticed some Schwinn scooters at<br/>
Big Lots.  (Of course,  they sold out before we got there.....but since<br/>
she&#39;d worked so hard for this,  we drove aound to about four or five<br/>
toy/department stores and dound one on sale - though not as good as Big<br/>
Lots!  Anyhow,  I chpped in the difference for her.)<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s amazing to me is that the 16 month old wanted to ride that,  too.  SO<br/>
I pushed him around while he held one finger of mina anf held the steering<br/>
column with his other hand.   None of my dd&#39;s have been this interested in<br/>
things with wheels at such an early age!<br/>
<br/>
All of us have finally switched gears from playing computer games.  Our<br/>
major collaborative effort has been Commander Keen:  Episode four. (If<br/>
anyone can tell me where to get other episodes,  we&#39;d love to see something<br/>
else.)  We think we&#39;ve explored most everything there - except we can&#39;t find<br/>
the secret entrance to the Pyramid of the Forbidden.  We know it&#39;s under the<br/>
Pyramid of the Moons.....just can&#39;t seem to get there.)   It&#39;s amazing that<br/>
even our three yr old has managed to find several secret passages and new<br/>
moves to get past some of the creatures!<br/>
The 3 yo and 7yo have asked about the proper way to shut down the computer,<br/>
and I have complete confidence they can do it.   Unfortunately,  Simon,  the<br/>
toddler,  has discovered the CD-rom open close button.....he has tried<br/>
putting in a diskette,  and some kleenex so far,  my to my chagrin :-)<br/>
<br/>
The kids are exploring lots of music.  Monster Mash is a favorite these<br/>
days.  And Katy likes some of the Moulin Rouge music.</div>

There was a little film on Mr. Rogers about the crayola factory and how they <br/>
make them and pour them and sort into boxes.  And we have Scholastic <br/>
paperback book on crayons too.<br/>
<br/>
But you have a resource we didn&#39;t have when my kids were younger, and here it <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771960142">I don&#39;t think it is a gender thing.  I think it is a hand/eye coordination<br/>
thing.  My sister and I learned at different ages, not because we weren&#39;t<br/>
interested but because of daring and hand/foot/eye coordination.  She was<br/>
much more daring and tried to learn earlier but it took her longer (many<br/>
bumps and scrapes!).  I learned at about 5 and carefully learned first time<br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
Son #3 learned to ride at age 2, by himself, no training wheels to start.<br/>
Simpy on the bike and gone.  Son #2 was a terror with one of those<br/>
low-riding 3 wheeled thing (I don&#39;t remember what they are called, was it<br/>
Big Wheels?) but it took him forever to learn on a bicycle.  Son #1 was<br/>
another dare devil.  Eldest daughter was always very careful and didn&#39;t show<br/>
any interest until she was older.  Kidlet #4 has almost terminal<br/>
uncoordination and it took him almost a year to learn and not until he was<br/>
about 10.  Kidlet #5 is our resident stubborn Taurus and she &quot;decided&quot; she<br/>
would learn to ride a bicycle when she was 5 and she kept at it one day<br/>
until she could do it.  The same with roller blades.<br/>
<br/>
And all of them played with cars and loved Tonka toys and loved going to the<br/>
races (both round and rounds and rails).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461575278">I have to chime in here to second that it is not a guy thing but rather a motor skill. My 19 month old loves wheels anything you can steer or ride on and she has for about 3 or so months. She even likes to try to ride the older two scooters and skateboards. And my 6 year old daughter was much the same. She has always been really good at large motor skills while her more refined motor skills -like typing- have come more difficult to her.<br/>

could cope with at the moment :-).      I noticed the Crayola book about how<br/>
crayons are made on the website, too.<br/>
 We&#39;ll see where it leads us......so far it&#39;s led us to look at how crayola<br/>
markers are made,  and to see how far the Crayola factory is to determine<br/>
whether a trip is do-able.<br/>

here...but I can&#39;t retrieve it.  I read it first in Oliver Sacks,  The Man<br/>

Third child (dd) is quite physically daring.  She&#39;s quick in running and<br/>
fearless in jumping.  Speedy on her tricycle,  trying scooters and skates<br/>
lately.  Abby (7) still doesn&#39;t ride her two wheeler- no interest.  She also<br/>
walks into walls occassionally,  falls off chairs,  twists her ankle....just<br/>
seems to have low awareness of her body in relation to her environment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081028683">I would also like to share about what we are doing in unschooling.  14<br/>
y.o. Rex is working on filling out applications and making a resume. <br/>
Went down to the state building and got a food handlers card and a form<br/>
for employers to send to the state so he is legal to work.  Coloring a<br/>
coloring book about the human anatomy-he loves art.  Studying body<br/>
building and wants to join the local gym when he gets a job.  Studying<br/>
the drivers book for his permit next summer.  Wrestling season and club<br/>
are over for now.  Wants to go to wrestling camp in the summer.  Has a<br/>
math book that he is studying.  Still designing how he wants his room and<br/>
the dog house he is planning to build.  Sort of took a break for spring<br/>
break since all his friends were out of school.  Every night stays up<br/>
until about one oclock reading books.  Right now reading Sherlock Holmes<br/>
stories.  Discovered a talent for window painting/art.  Wants to do that<br/>
when he gets a fast-food job for the restaurant he works at.  Wants a job<br/>
so he can save ahead of time for college.  Wants to be an architectural<br/>
engineer.  Sometimes does drywall with his dad, but wants a steady wage.<br/>
We plan to do a lot of hiking this spring.  Spring is finally here and it<br/>
is gorgeous.  No more Oregon drizzle.  My kids put together kites from<br/>
kits.  They&#39;ve been flying them every day.  11y.o. Caleb is very<br/>
interested in comedy and is always coming up with new ways to express<br/>
himself humorously.  Is an observer of human nature.  Saving up for a<br/>
video camera.  Wants to be a movie producer.  9y.o. Seth is making<br/>
slushies and selling them to the landscapers who&#39;ve been working in our<br/>
neighborhood.  Was disappointed that they took his jobs away from<br/>
him-they outbid him.  So making a profit off of them.  Follows them<br/>
around the trailer park asking questions about why they do it this or<br/>
that way and how he thinks it might be done.  Still wants to make a lot<br/>
of money and give to the poor.  His 7y.o. sister, Phoebe, assists him in<br/>
his business venture.  She is a little book-writer/illustrator.  I am<br/>
thinking of scoring more paper at the labs and doctors offices I used to<br/>
work at.  Maybe if I make my rounds I will save some money.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
babysitting to make money to spend on their interests.  We will divide<br/>
that money evenly between the five of us, but I will be the treasurer,<br/>
for now.  My daughter sticks like glue when the baby is around.  She<br/>
loves helping me take care of him.  She wants to be either an animal or a<br/>
people doctor some day, so she says.  Lately, I&#39;ve noticed that my<br/>
younger kids like to read what I read.  I read a lot of psychology type<br/>
books.  They ask me questions about them all the time.  <br/>
Husband Kevin is coming around to all the unschooling business.  He<br/>
acknowledges that the only things he remembers from school were art and<br/>
sports and shop, because those were what he was interested in.<br/>
My best friend&#39;s daughter may unschool with us next summer.  But her dad<br/>
may require some sort of written proof of what she is learning.  She<br/>
wants to be a doctor.  I asked her what school she wanted to study to be<br/>
a doctor in.  She didn&#39;t even know (parents didn&#39;t tell her) there is one<br/>
only two hours away.  I told her how she could ask them to send her a<br/>
