Dave  collects the systems (going back to Pong, Atari and Amiga), <br/>

 <br/>
Speaking of that....Atari...have you seen those systems with the old games  <br/>
that consist of only a controller, and you hook the controller directly to the  <br/>
TV?  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m dying to play Break Out again, but I want to know if they&#39;re worth the  <br/>
$20.  Anyone tried one, yet?<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s amazing how far the technology has come.  I find myself wishing  the PS2 <br/>
wasn&#39;t so BIG so it would fit in better on the shelf.  :)<br/>

  Margaux has one and she likes it, but the controlls are sticky--not a high quality piece.  I&#39;m sure there are different brands.  I recommend not buying one from a kiosk if they say no refunds.  Also, I think that the old games are made for playing on the PS2, but I can never remember the name of the thing.  Those games were so small that tons of them can fit on a disk.<br/>

Thanks!  Exactly the kind of feedback I was hoping for!<br/>
 <br/>
It still might be worth $20 to play Break Out for 3 weeks.  :)<br/>

while  the graphics aren&#39;t spectacular, we&#39;ve enjoyed it. We&#39;ve had it about 6 <br/>
six weeks. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  You can get a lot of those old games on abandonware sites. Many of the sites have old computer games you can download but some are devoted to computer version of old C-64, Coleco, Atari, etc. games. I&#39;ve filled my computer with neat older games (incredible machine, broderbunds playhouse, C-64 game knights of Legend). Legally, it&#39;s not always proper. Many have had their copyrights abandoned but some you&#39;ll find haven&#39;t though and are available for download because they aren&#39;t availible for purchase. Or that&#39;s how the websites excuse it. Regardless, most of the people who run sites with abandonware feel as if they&#39;re performing a service, a kind of very accessible archive, keeping older games in circulation (regardless of copyright status) when the copyright holders have not made them available and will remove any game that is rereleased for sale by the copyright holders. <br/>
    The best of these sites and a good place to start is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.the-underdogs.org/">http://www.the-underdogs.org/</a> . They have great links and a huge list of games that are well sorted and have well written reviews. <br/>

<br/>
I can understand that reasoning.<br/>
<br/>
I have never once felt guilty for photocopying a book if I&#39;ve already tried <br/>
to buy it and it&#39;s just not available anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t feel guilty buying Asian DVDs of movies I had tried for years to buy <br/>
&quot;for real&quot; (and maybe those versions are perfectly legal anyway), of El Cid <br/>
and of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead.   <br/>
