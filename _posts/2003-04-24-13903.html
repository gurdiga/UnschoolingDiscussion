Radio&#39;s big bully<br/>
A complete guide to Salon&#39;s reporting on Clear Channel, the most <br/>
powerful -- and some would say pernicious -- force in the music industry.<br/>
<br/>
- - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>
For the past few months, Salon reporter Eric Boehlert has been tracking <br/>
the story of Clear Channel Communications, the little-noticed media <br/>
giant that has quietly taken over the country&#39;s radio and concert <br/>
industries.<br/>
<br/>
The company owns nearly 1,200 radio stations and effectively controls <br/>
the rock radio market. It also owns SFX Entertainment, the nation&#39;s <br/>
dominant concert-venue owner and touring promoter.<br/>
<br/>
In the stories below, Boehlert has detailed the corporation&#39;s evolution <br/>
under the aegis of Randy Michaels, the one-time shock jock who has <br/>
turned the industry upside down with rampant cost-cutting and a <br/>
good-ol&#39;-boy approach to management.<br/>
<br/>
And in &quot;Pay for Play&quot; Boehlert details the new payola -- the complex <br/>
arrangements under which the world&#39;s major record companies pay for <br/>
virtually every rock song broadcast on commercial radio.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, there is a link to the Clear Channel Web site, on which you can <br/>
easily find the stations the company operates in your town.<br/>

Pay for play<br/>
Why does radio suck? Because most stations play only the songs the <br/>

Tough company<br/>
Clear Channel is as big as NBC or Gannett. Chances are it owns a <br/>
half-dozen radio stations in your town. And it&#39;s fighting employee suits <br/>
alleging everything from broken contracts to sexual harassment.<br/>

Napster&#39;s out of the picture, but for the first time in a decade, album <br/>
