<div id="ygrps-yiv-683180899">Thanks to all for math cd-rom suggestions recently... We got Mathquest with <br/>
Aladdin by Disney a couple days ago, and my 7yo boy really seems to enjoy <br/>
it. It&#39;s giving him good practice in adding and subtracting and has a lot of <br/>
little logic games. Nice calm music too.<br/>
<br/>
Chumbo.com was out of stock on many of the titles that interested me, <br/>
though. Several of the titles were by a publisher called Broderbund, but <br/>
when I tried to get to their web site, I was directed to Mattel instead. I <br/>
suppose there&#39;s been a buyout or something. Even there many of the title <br/>
were out of stock.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any other good sources for educational CD-roms, I&#39;d be <br/>
interested!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Annette<br/>
