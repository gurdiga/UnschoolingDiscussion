 </span></blockquote>Fay and Cline have a brand new book coming out applying Love and Logic <br/>
principles to toddlers and preschoolers, but it&#39;s so new that I don&#39;t have a <br/>
copy yet.  Maybe that&#39;s one of the ones you&#39;re looking for.  <br/>
<br/>
By the way -- one of the consequences of not making a choice is that mommy <br/>
and daddy get to make the choice.  So, when one of my kids said, &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
want to make a choice,&quot; I&#39;d say very calmly, &quot;OK, then I get to choose, and I <br/>
choose (whatever).&quot;  It didn&#39;t take them long to figure out that they were <br/>
giving away their control over the situation.<br/>

she screams I could tell her, &quot;this is the consquences of you not making a <br/>
decision.  You end up having to do things you really don&#39;t want to&quot;  This is <br/>
the conversation that I get...&quot;I WANT to do this.........&quot; &quot;That is not one <br/>
of the choices.  Here are the choices........&quot; but &quot;I want to do <br/>
this..............&quot; over and over again....<br/>
