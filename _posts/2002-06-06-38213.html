 Second, what is MSM.  I think I read that same thing in a post about <br/>
fibromyalgia. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am on MSM right now for my back injury.<br/>
The full name is Methyl-sulfonyl-methane, it&#39;s naturally occurring organic <br/>
sulfur....very safe. <br/>
It has multiple health benefits. The reason I&#39;m  on it is to assist my <br/>
inflamed disc in calming down, it has anti-inflammatory effects.<br/>
Miraculously, all of my allergy symptoms disappeared when I started taking <br/>
it. Here&#39;s what it says on the bottle:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;MSM provides the body with a bio-available form of organic sulfur to form <br/>
connective tissue for healthy joints and muscles.  It is necessary for <br/>
collagen synthesis for healthy skin, hair and nails.  MSM is an antioxidant <br/>
and also cleanses the body of pathogens, benefiting those who need seasonal <br/>
respiratory support.  This miraculous nutrient improves digestion and <br/>
metabolism, increases blood circulation, and enjances memory and <br/>
concentration.  MSM found in natural foods is easily lost during food <br/>
processing, making MSM suppplementation a safe and natural way to optimize <br/>
your health.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not sure why it would be useful as a poultice, unless it was for the <br/>
anti-inflammatory effect?<br/>
All I know is it helped my back heal much quicker, and I&#39;m not sneezing all <br/>
the time from pollen!! My son is on it now with his sprained knee, to help <br/>
heal the tendons.<br/>
