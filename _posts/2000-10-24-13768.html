<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043122728">Dear folks, <br/>
    Lots of great posts on reading!  As for the question of dealing with the <br/>
school district, in some places there are homeschool umbrella organizations <br/>
that are legally set up as private schools. If you enroll with one then you <br/>
interact with them rather than with the public school people. They are <br/>
generally inexpensive as they provide only protection, support and a bit of <br/>
record keeping.  Each state has it&#39;s own laws about the relationship between <br/>
private and public schools. In Maryland only private religious schools are <br/>
exempt from interference by the state (at least when I was there) in <br/>
California it&#39;s all private schools.<br/>
     When we were in Baltimore I signed up with the public school district. <br/>
It didn&#39;t work out very well. I couldn&#39;t offer them enough &quot;proof&quot; that my <br/>
daughter who was then 11 or 12 was doing schoolwork, Even though she was a <br/>
voracious reader how did I KNOW she understood what she was reading etc. They <br/>
decided I was not complying with the law and educating my children properly <br/>
and scheduled another review. I then called &quot;The Learning Community&quot; an <br/>
umbrella group which was run by Manfred Smith and legally connected with some <br/>
spiritual community and signed up. One of the most fun experiences of my life <br/>
was calling the school district guy and saying, &quot;I won&#39;t be keeping the <br/>
appointment for the review. I&#39;ve signed up with TLC.&quot; He said, &quot;You can&#39;t do <br/>
that!&quot; and I replied, &quot; Oh yes I can, give Manfred a call and ask him.&quot; I <br/>
must admit I derived tremendous satisfaction from this. Manfred was one of <br/>
the main people involved in changing the Maryland laws about homeschooling <br/>
and the guy knew who he was.<br/>
    So anyway, perhaps one of these organizations might be available in your <br/>
area. Manfred might know about these in other states. He is currently the <br/>
president of the Maryland Hone Education Association. His e-mail and voice <br/>
mail info are on their website at www.mhea.com. Writing this prompted me to <br/>
find his website. I haven&#39;t thought about him in years, how delightful to <br/>
remember!  <br/>
