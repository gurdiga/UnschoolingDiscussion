<br/>
Perhaps I misunderstand, but it seems you are saying that you pay your kids<br/>
money to do workbooks.  That coupled with the information you posted about<br/>
unschooling at home while your kids were in ps, leads me to question your<br/>
understanding of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t something done part time or occasionally.  It is 24/7 of<br/>
the child pursuing his own dreams and desires, not completing pages to get<br/>
money.<br/>
<br/>
Again, perhaps I misunderstood.<br/>

Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but Dorinda&#39;s message looks like nothing so much as <br/>
a big fat worm-on-a-hook to me. Did you take the bait, or am I <br/>
totally wrong about this post? Could this possibly be an unschooler, <br/>
and not some really creative troll?<br/>
<br/>
Dorinda -- i most heartily apologize if you were not pulling this <br/>
list&#39;s collective leg (legs?). I mean it -- you had me reading your <br/>
post to my daughter -- had my HUSBAND (MR. <br/>
Homeschooling/Unschooling/Whatever) exclaiming, &quot;She&#39;s an<br/>
UNschooler???&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Well, maybe a really creative unschooler with too much time on her <br/>
hands.<br/>
<br/>
Delicious post.<br/>

Well, actually,  I never &quot;told you&quot; you *should* do anything.  I merely<br/>
asked questions about whether or not it may be a good idea if newer list<br/>
members are interested.     Believe me,  I am hesitant to have you try it<br/>
again. And your response here reminds me why.<br/>
   And apparently,  you don&#39;t want to....I&#39;m certainly willing to take that<br/>

16. I think reading is a basic skill for survival in this society. My kid<br/>
is almost six and he is just starting to read. We do phonics stuff and sound<br/>
games every day *at his request*. But even if he weren&#39;t into it, I&#39;d<br/>
start &quot;making him&quot; at a later age. Not at the age he is now, but certainly<br/>
by 10 or so. Yup, you betcha I would! It is the one thing I feel strongly<br/>
that he has to learn. Years ago, it was illegal for my ancestors to learn<br/>
how to read (we are African American) in this country. I feel it would be<br/>
a slap in the face for all their struggles for me to neglect this one<br/>
aspect of his upbringing.<br/>

Now this is the kind of thinking that just begs for a response along the<br/>
lines of unschooling!  I&#39;ll just ask,  Lynn,  you&#39;re willing to give up<br/>
unschooling if your child can&#39;t read by age 10?  I&#39;m wondering whether you<br/>
fully understand it then.  And I won&#39;t speak for Tia,  but she has commented<br/>
many times that her experience of intervening with her son seemed to make<br/>
things worse in their relationship.<br/>
<br/>
I truly understand your dilemma,  for I have experienced what you are simply<br/>
talking about as a possible situation.  Let me share a bit of my experience.<br/>
Since we moved away from the school track for our family (my oldest had<br/>
attended kindergarten and two yrs of preschool),  I explored aspects of<br/>
educating our children at home and found that unschooling resonated as the<br/>
most genuine way to allow my children to grow.<br/>
    When my very intelligent dd wasn&#39;t reading by the end of &#39;first grade&#39;,<br/>
I worried.  She had even forgotten the sight words she had memorized in<br/>
kindergarten.  All the veteran homeschoolers advised me to take a deep breat<br/>
h and be patient.  I had to trusyt a bunch of people I&#39;d never met in<br/>
person?  Well,  I did.  For several months.  And as dd did NOT &#39;take off&#39; in<br/>
her reading,  my patience left me.  I once again struggled to &#39;let go.  A<br/>
discussion came up here ...about whether or not it&#39;s ok for a parent to<br/>
&#39;just let them grow up illiterate&#39;.  But again,  the those who had older<br/>
children,  children who learned to read &#39;later&#39;,  others coping with the<br/>
same circumstance all recommended being patient.   I went up and down this<br/>
roller coaster....though the hills and valleys became less and less<br/>
pronounced.<br/>
    Finally,  about a year ago,  I *truly got it*!!!  I had *really* missed<br/>
the point of unschooling in regard to reading!  All along,  I was pushing dd<br/>
into word games, shaming her at times (I didn&#39;t consciously intend to...I<br/>
was ashamed it camed out that way).  In my roller coaster ride,  I was still<br/>
pushing her...only it became more subtle usually.  Or I&#39;d think...ok,  I&#39;ve<br/>
been patient for 6-7 months,  and that hasn&#39;t &#39;worked&#39; (meaning it didn&#39;t<br/>
get me what *I* wanted - her to read AND enjoy it!)<br/>
    Intead of allowing her the freedom to learn when,  how,  as much as SHE<br/>
chose,  I was trying to get her to meet MY expectations.  When she was 8,<br/>
dh and I even devised a *plan* to have her tested if she couldn&#39;t read by<br/>
age 9.  Then it was,  we&#39;ll start a stringent structured program by age 9;<br/>
then it was....maybe I&#39;m not handling this right,  maybe we should pay a<br/>
tutor.  Well, all this didn&#39;t settle well with me.  And whenever it came up,<br/>
dd felt like she had disappointed me,  like a failure.  She was stressed and<br/>
tense about reading and &#39;tried&#39; to do it for me....yet became increasingly<br/>
resistant.<br/>
    When I examined this situation more closely,  I realized I had some<br/>
major de-schooling to do of my own thinking.  I had to examine how<br/>
mainstream ideas had infiltrated my thinking about how it&#39;s my *job* to make<br/>
sure she knows certain things.<br/>
    And your post almost exactly states my thinking on it.<br/>
Maybe you&#39;ll not be able to understand unless you go through it.  But I was<br/>
wrong in my attitude and it only harmed my dd.  She was not truly allowed<br/>
the freedom she neede in this area (i.e., NOT unschooling) until I had this<br/>
breakthrough in my thinking and attitude.<br/>
    I need to go now......I hope you can look at this with an open mind!<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m trying to, believe me. Is your daughter reading now? How old is she?<br/>
Does anyone know any unschooled kids who are/were not reading by<br/>
adulthood? I&#39;d be interested in hearing those stories.<br/>
