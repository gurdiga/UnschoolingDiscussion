 Also, the boxes that things come in are sometimes useless.  After the first <br/>
 few times, many things end up in zip-loc bags here.  Chess pieces, etc.   &gt;&gt;<br/>

I just wanted to comment that I found and excellent re-usable resource....the <br/>
plastic zip bags that sheets come in!!  Seems that everyone in my family got <br/>
a set of sheets, matress pad or something bed related that had these <br/>
wonderful, heavy duty, zippered bags -- they have come in handy for games, <br/>
&quot;little people&quot; and their accesories (my kidlets are under 4), legos, and <br/>
other building blocks.  If you can find the kind that have snaps instead of <br/>
zippers you can snap them over a hanger and hand things out of the way...many <br/>
art supplies are in this type of bag and hand in my coat closet (when it&#39;s <br/>
not BURSTING with coats and winter gear!!).<br/>
