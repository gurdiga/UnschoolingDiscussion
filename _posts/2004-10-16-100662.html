<div id="ygrps-yiv-655316681">Hi people, <br/>
<br/>
I have been gone for a long while, busy writing about politics on my<br/>
blog, www.culturekitchen.com. I&#39;m coming back because I am looking for<br/>
writers. I would like to have homeschoolers opinion pieces about<br/>
political issues affection homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
My site is being tracked by the Washington Post as a political blog to<br/>
read throughout the elections. I am opening my blog to other writers,<br/>
especially homeschoolers because, as far as I know, NOT ONE POLITICAL<br/>
BLOG is covering anything about homeschooling issues. This is your<br/>
opportunity people. Sieze it! <br/>
<br/>
FYI : I am an unapologetic progressive, some say to the left of<br/>
liberal. I am also an atheist. At my site I once in a while use<br/>
language that some would find offensive. If you have a problem with<br/>
this, this is not the forum for you. <br/>
<br/>
Still, I am open to post both liberal and conservative homeschooling<br/>
political POVs because, at the moment, there are NONE whatsoever in<br/>
the national political discussion; even less so in reference to the<br/>
elections. <br/>
<br/>
Subjects I am looking for : <br/>
<br/>
NCLBA; especially Bush&#39;s opinion that it is a &quot;jobs program&quot;<br/>
Compulsory education laws<br/>
Accountability<br/>
Independent learning movement vs. Homeschooling<br/>
Schooling vs. Learning<br/>
Cyberschools / Cybercharters / Homeschooling<br/>
<br/>
If there is anything else you feel needs to be addressed that I have<br/>
omitted from this paltry list, please feel free to send it in. Hotly<br/>
contested states like PA, OH, FL, please speak up! <br/>
<br/>
You have only 3 weeks to have your voice heard before the elections.<br/>
If you write for an e-list such as this one, you can write for a blog.<br/>
Word count does not matter either, as long as you can make your point<br/>
clearly. <br/>
<br/>
Please remember that many people coming to the site might not know<br/>
much about homeschooling. Your opinions have to be educational and<br/>
informative as well. Links to sources over the net or books about the<br/>
subjects you are writing about are an absolute must. Also include a<br/>
small bio about yourself and links to any websites, blogs or<br/>
Yahoo!Groups where readers can find you. <br/>
<br/>
Please respect do not respond to this list (this is a list about<br/>
discussion Unschooling after all). Send all your submissions to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:liza@...">liza@...</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
