<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There&#39;s harm in NOT being able to see it, and there&#39;s even more harm in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>not <br/>
&quot;seeing learning&quot; until it looks like school-style busywork.<br/>
<br/>
And I think  there&#39;s harm in telling children &quot;NOW you&#39;re learning!&quot;  or &quot;OH <br/>
GOOD!  That&#39;s science!&quot; instead of being with them where they are in the <br/>
moment.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
But I think that there ARE times when it&#39;s OK to say, &quot;See? That&#39;s science!&quot; <br/>
Or history or math or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after we left school, Cameron&#39;s friends would say mean things like <br/>
how stupid he was going to be or how he&#39;ll never get into college or what about <br/>
algebra.?<br/>
<br/>
He was thinking that *I* had made a HUGE mistake because he wasn&#39;t learning <br/>
anything &quot;schoolish&quot;----that would &quot;count&quot;. (He was also DEschooling).<br/>
<br/>
When we were visiting Gettysburg or packing the car or doubling the 2/3 cup <br/>
in a recipe, I would casually mention that this WAS history/geometry/fractions. <br/>
It wasn&#39;t that *I* wanted to know that he was learning. He NEEDED to know <br/>
that the learning was *happening*. <br/>
<br/>
This was very hard to do. I didn&#39;t want it to sound &quot;preachy&quot;; nor did I want <br/>
him to &quot;count&quot; that as his &quot;history for the week&quot;. I wanted him (a SCHOOLED <br/>
CHILD) to realize that everything we do every day IS educational. It took a <br/>
loooong time for him to see the value in life. That he CAN learn from living. <br/>
That he can SEE the learning.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to explain. It clicked for him when he was finally finished <br/>
deschooling. It clicked even more when his schooled friends got to high school and <br/>
realized that school is really stupid! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now he can SEE that everything counts----but for a while he thought I was <br/>
just crazy! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Well he already had school.<br/>
When kids haven&#39;t had any school, it&#39;s not at all helpful to divide the world <br/>
schoolishly up for them.<br/>

don&#39;t divide the world up.  I guess we never thought about it since we have <br/>
pretty good laws here in NC, no portfolio, no review etc.  Never had a reason to <br/>
say &quot;this is math...or this is science&quot;.  <br/>

Even with portfolios there is no need to separate. I did my portfolio last <br/>
year without speaking the subjects to my kids. I simply divided what he did <br/>
throughout the year into what it fit into. With the lady who does ours I dont even <br/>
think I needed to do that. Laura<br/>
