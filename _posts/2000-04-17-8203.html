        I&#39;m sure that was a delight for you to find your son happily playing <br/>

I should add that, while my son got along well with some of the kids, there<br/>
was one that was a challenge for him.  It took several years for the two<br/>
boys to work through their differences.  Part of it was my son learning to<br/>
get along with others.  Fortunately, I could talk freely about this with<br/>
the other boy&#39;s mom.<br/>
