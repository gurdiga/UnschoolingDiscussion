<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252671551">Hi everyone,<br/>
I&#39;m with Janis and Laura D,I too enjoyed the e-mail that was sent. <br/>
It struck a chord in me also because I got from it &quot;a awy of living&quot; <br/>
I didn&#39;t pay much attention to the history of it because I went to <br/>
school and I never learned about all that LOL......... I am truly <br/>
just learning everything now with being HOME (not homeschooling)with <br/>
my son so desparately wishing DAD could be joining our FUN. I long <br/>
for the day where we can all be together and he doesn&#39;t have to work <br/>
so hard to support two families(ex-wife).  I always tell him that my <br/>
mission is to find a FAMILY based business that we can do as a <br/>
family so he can enjoy the closeness that we have.  Also he is not <br/>
getting any younger and I don&#39;t want to see him working outside in <br/>
the elements of his contracting / construction business.  He has a <br/>
dream that his children will follow in his shoes but it doesn&#39;t look <br/>
that way as of yet.<br/>

<br/>
P.S. I think it would be helpful to describe the whole concept of <br/>
unschooling that is why I printed it for my husband who doesn&#39;t <br/>
quite understand HOMEschooling.  He questions me daily on what we <br/>
are doing for our homeSCHOOLING.  I really like that comment of <br/>
offering no explanation of why we are not in school.  It is none of <br/>
their business :)</div>

 </span></blockquote>The point was that it was all made up history. And you wouldn&#39;t have even<br/>
learned it if you had been a fundamentalist Christian homeschooled child.<br/>
It&#39;s relatively recent revisionist history.<br/>
<br/>
Tuck has the advantage of having met him, but what I&#39;ve read of the<br/>
philosophy of the Elijah Company they seem to be very thoughtful people.<br/>
They have a really good page that discusses why they&#39;ve chosen to include<br/>
fantasy in their curriculum, despite the feelings among many<br/>
fundamentalists.<br/>
<br/>
He may believe this history and may be passing off conclusions based on what<br/>
he believes is truth, but that doesn&#39;t turn the arguments he&#39;s basing it on<br/>
into truth.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m with Janis and Laura D,I too enjoyed the e-mail that was sent.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Truth shouldn&#39;t need lies to support it. Maybe someone else can write up<br/>
something that comes to the same conclusions that doesn&#39;t need to rely on<br/>
made up history and catch words that racists use as a foundation.<br/>

and the Sonlight page on fantasy I&#39;ve pointed people to.<br/>
<br/>
Elijah was the first homeschooling catalog I got when I started <br/>
out and I read it cover to cover. All that stuff! And the detailed <br/>
descriptions! But it was, ultimately, uncomfortably fundamentalist <br/>
for me. They had and have books on the God-dad-mom-kids <br/>
family structure, how to start your own business to be self-reliant <br/>
because that&#39;s a Christian&#39;s duty. They carry Mary Hood&#39;s book <br/>
Onto the Yellow School Bus... (&quot;Over four centuries ago, Martin <br/>
Luther warned that if God were removed from education, the <br/>
schools would prove to be the gates of hell. In this very <br/>
interesting book, Mary Hood discusses home schooling as a <br/>
form of spiritual warfare.&quot;) There&#39;s a book section &quot;Families <br/>
Interested in Social Action & Restoring America to Her Christian <br/>
Roots.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t know about their philosophy but that point of view is <br/>
definitely reflected in their book offerings. Now it&#39;s making more <br/>
sense that he&#39;d write an article like that.<br/>

<br/>
One homeschooling family I knew through the SCA, I met when Kirby was one and <br/>
their kids ranged from 2 - 12.  Five kid.<br/>
<br/>
Years passed, I liked the kids, one had the same birthday as I did, and Kirby <br/>
got to be five and then didn&#39;t go to school.<br/>
<br/>
Years passed, and once they all spent the weekend with us and we had a GREAT <br/>
time.  Part of the great time involved video games, on the cutting edge system <br/>
the time, which was a Nintendo 64.<br/>
<br/>
The mom had been homeschooling by then for maybe twelve years.  <br/>
We discussed exchanging some of our information.<br/>
<br/>
I gave her some printouts from online discussions that I&#39;d really liked about <br/>
then, a copy of the interview with me in Home Education Magazine (which I <br/>
thought would be fun because she&#39;d known me before I&#39;d ever considered <br/>
homeschooling) and a couple of little articles I had written.<br/>
<br/>
She gave me an Elijah Company catalog.<br/>
<br/>
That was it.<br/>
I was interested in the vast array of inexpensive illustrated history books <br/>
(many of which I already had) but kind of appalled at the creationist science <br/>
and the number of religious bios (all Protestant, which ended up skewing their <br/>
history offerings around the Renaissance).<br/>
<br/>
When we next met to trade back our stuff (they needed their catalog back) the <br/>
dad said very testily and privately to me:  &quot;We don&#39;t need YOU to tell us how <br/>
to homeschool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yah.  Well.  He had never been in on the original conversation.<br/>
<br/>
But not long after that they got a Nintendo system.<br/>
And they loosened up on their lessons.<br/>
And the mom eventually ran the dad off (to the other end of their rambling <br/>
hippie property, but off from the main house).<br/>
<br/>
They had been living off his mental disability payments (and social security <br/>
and welfare), but the kids came up with a very cool magic and juggling act, <br/>
and some of you probably have seen them or will someday.   &quot;The Clan Tynker.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
At one time they had a webpage (an advertisement, not much more) but I didn&#39;t <br/>
find it.<br/>
<br/>
The girls&#39; real names were Sarah and Mary (Biblical) but they messed with <br/>
them (which is fine).  Rebekah is the one with the same birthday as mine.  Sam is <br/>
dating Sadie, one of the unschoolers I&#39;ve talked about here sometimes, who <br/>
has done two years of college and is off this year doing construction and <br/>
studying karate in Santa Fe.<br/>
