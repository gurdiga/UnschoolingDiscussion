If you start when they&#39;re fifteen it&#39;s not going to work as well as it will <br/>
if they grew up with choices.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-917414072">As a semi-serious cook (who gets to build a house adn pick out all the<br/>
kitchen stuff soon!!!) Igot tired of the kids complaining about what I made.<br/>
I told them that it hurt my feelings to hear the complaints as I spent a lot<br/>
of time, energy and love cooking their meals. &quot;Take it or leave it&quot; was way<br/>
too harsh for us, it reminds me too much of eat what I made, even though you<br/>
don&#39;t like it or starve. So I asked for them to at least taste it, and if it<br/>
was not okay to go make a PB sandwich. I was not interested in making a<br/>
variety of meals but had no problem with them helping themselves. Max (3) is<br/>
of course too young to make a PB sandwich so I don&#39;t mind being a little<br/>
more accomodating for him. There are many choices Between eat what I made<br/>
becasue It&#39;s what *I* wanted to make and go eat whatever.<br/>
LOL Here&#39;s an example of strewing relating to food.<br/>
Guess what Max just wanted for breakfast!!<br/>
ICE CREAM! so what did he get?<br/>
Ice cream and a bowl of mandarin oranges (Del Monte in the JAR--MMMMMM!!!!<br/>
Try some)<br/>
He didn&#39;t ask for the oranges, I&#39;m not forcing him but they are there and he<br/>
may eat them. He also ate a granola bar earlier. Even mainstream<br/>
Pediatricians will tell you to look at a childs diet over a week long period<br/>
to determine their nutrition.<br/>
~Elissa Cleaveland, who just went into the dining room to pick up a fork Max<br/>
dropped and the ice cream was sitting and melting and the oranges were<br/>
half-gone. &quot;Mm!&quot; He said. Even a three year old can be trusted to make food<br/>
choices.<br/>
&quot;It is nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction<br/>
have<br/>
not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry.&quot; A. Einstein</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not out to burn anyone. :o) This is not a concept you&#39;ll see discussed <br/>
just anywhere. Trusting kids to makes good choices does come up a lot in <br/>
unschooling discussions, though. It seems counter-intuitive, too permissive <br/>
and whacky maybe, at first. But from what I&#39;ve seen and experienced, in <br/>
practice, it works better than the accepted norm of take it or leave it. Or <br/>
good food vs. bad foods. Or appropriate times to eat vs. eating when the <br/>
need arises.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825156063">My kids are 2 and 4. The main food choice that is limited (by me) is CLOSE THE<br/>
REFRIGERATOR DOOR! We have all kinds of foods on hand and I have to reach stuff<br/>
for them out of the freezer, but they have A LOT of choice in what they eat.<br/>
Usually we&#39;ll fix whatever they ask for or they&#39;ll eat what we&#39;re eating.<br/>
