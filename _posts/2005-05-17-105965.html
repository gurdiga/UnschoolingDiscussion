If I  can&#39;t &quot;measure&quot; his learning with <br/>
grades will my head explode:)?  How  do you let go of that kind of <br/>
mindset?<br/>
<br/>

------------------------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
How did you learn to ride a bike?<br/>
 <br/>
How did you walk from your house to the store the first time you ever  did?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
You don&#39;t do it by thinking about it.  You do it by getting up out of  your <br/>
comfortable chair, walking toward your goal, and learning to do it.<br/>

Don&#39;t just read that one.  Follow the links and see how others  describe it.<br/>
And then don&#39;t just read it, and don&#39;t just think about it.<br/>
 <br/>
Reading about bicycles isn&#39;t learning to ride, and looking at the sale  <br/>
flyers isn&#39;t going to the grocery store.<br/>
