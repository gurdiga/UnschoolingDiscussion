If local<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     governments take<br/>
     care of broken bridges without fed funding (adhering to safe practices, <br/>
of<br/>
     course), then you don&#39;t have to send money to someone to make a <br/>
decision to<br/>
     send<br/>
     money back.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are not many states that could afford to build adequate highways and<br/>
bridges; monitor wastewater treatment (or is that &quot;unnecessary<br/>
regulation&quot;?); pay for their own military defense; and so on, on their own.<br/>
In states that can, an attitude like this would soon devolve into the urban<br/>
parts of the state refusing to send tax dollars to the rural parts (&quot;We<br/>
built our own overpass. That 137-mile stretch of highway is your problem.&quot;)<br/>
Where does it end?  Isn&#39;t it to the advantage of all Americans to have<br/>
modern transportation, safe working conditions, etc.,  everywhere in the<br/>
country? Even people from perfect states sometimes have to do business with<br/>
or travel to other parts of the nation, don&#39;t they? I&#39;m sure there are times<br/>
when you need a vacation from all that glorious perfection.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     Being in Wisconsin, (a negative balance fed dollars state) we are very<br/>
     aware<br/>
     that the only net product we receive from the fed government is <br/>
promises<br/>
     and<br/>
     regulations.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The federal government represents all of us in this country. By extension,<br/>
me. By extension, you&#39;re calling me a freeloader. I take exception.<br/>
<br/>
And even for those among us -- I refer, of course, to Wisconsin residents --<br/>
superior enough to regulate themselves properly, federal regulations protect<br/>
the quality of water and food we get from other states or abroad (after all,<br/>
man does not live on cheese alone) as well as our civil rights and those of<br/>
our fellow Americans.<br/>
<br/>
So be grateful.<br/>
<br/>

government to be involved in that issue?<br/>
