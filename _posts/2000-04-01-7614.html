 </span></blockquote>Hi Kyle,<br/>
My name is Joshua and my wife is Selina.  We have 2 boys, Jordan (8) and<br/>
Daylon (just about 6).  I too am the &quot;primary domestic engineer&quot; in our<br/>
household.  I find it wildly challenging as well as wildly rewarding.  I<br/>
find that we are a pretty rare breed... actually I have yet to actually meet<br/>
another full-time homeschooling dad.  It is good to have you on the list...<br/>
It has been my experience that there are a lot of unique challenges to being<br/>
a stay at home dad in terms of relating to the &quot;rest of the world&quot; or<br/>
&quot;society&quot;.<br/>
This is a great list... lots of people on here that have very insightful and<br/>
caring things to say.<br/>
Where abouts do you live?<br/>
I am in Kelowna B.C. Canada.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Wow,  I&#39;m impressed two Dads who not only stay home as the <br/>
primary domestic engineers [I love that] but also homeschool!!<br/>
<br/>
Now my partner wonders what you share with your children.  He <br/>
seems to have a problem with Dads staying at home with the kids <br/>
as he wonders what example they are setting. <br/>
<br/>
In defense of you guys,  I asked him what example his Mother <br/>
showed him and pointed out that all his strong traits [he&#39;s a <br/>
scrounge] and interests were fostered by his Mother and what she <br/>
did.  Way back when he was a child his Mother was very frugal, <br/>
she was divorced but never took a job, instead she rented rooms <br/>
and lived simply.  This rubbed off on Dick and he worked many <br/>
hours as a teen, was in the marines for three years during the <br/>
Korean thing, and saved most of his money and had a sizeable <br/>
sum to put down as a deposit on the farm.   She was a keen <br/>
gardener and knew the benefits of adding organic matter to the <br/>
sandy soil to improve it.  This has turned Dick into an organic <br/>
fanatic, you should see the size of our compost pile...  we even <br/>
composted the neighbours dead cow!!   She was very interested in <br/>
birds and at an early age Dick learned all he could about birds in <br/>
an unschooled way.   Also his Mother was a very tidy person, and <br/>
while this didn&#39;t rub off onto him the desire for order did, making for <br/>
some frustrations, as sometimes we have a bit too much to do <br/>
here for the place to be kept orderly.<br/>
<br/>
So hopefully he may now look at the role of stay-at-home parents <br/>
of any gender as the most important job there is.<br/>
<br/>

    Great to here from you!  I was beginning to believe I was the only<br/>
one out there.  You are right there are many challenges that come with<br/>
being a male that stays at home.  I am from South Texas and the<br/>
stereotype of the macho male that brings home the bacon and keeps his<br/>
wife and children in tow is very strong.  I get allot of looks  and<br/>
headshakes when I respond to the question &quot;What do you do for a<br/>
living?&quot;.  Mostly from other males who automatically think I don&#39;t work<br/>
since I stay at home.  To them I say I have never worked harder n my<br/>
life, although I do not think they believe me.<br/>
    Have you been unschooling the whole time?<br/>
     Do you have time for a home business?<br/>
    Thanks for responding and I hope to hear more from you soon.<br/>

    Great to hear from you Sue.  I have enjoyed reading your other post<br/>
on this list.  My wife and I are hoping to be able to move to 32 acres<br/>
we have and &quot;homestead&quot; it in the near future.<br/>
    As for what I am teaching my children by staying home, well I hope<br/>
that We are teaching them to break down allot of those archaic<br/>
stereotypes we hold so dear and give them freedom to be themselves.  We<br/>
want them to know that we are a family and everyone works together<br/>
whether that means mom at work and dad at home or visa versa.  I hope<br/>
that in the future if my son has to make the decision to stay at hom<br/>
society won&#39;t be so hard on him, and if it is he will have an example to<br/>
look at.  As far as academics, we have never had a true curriculum.  It<br/>
has always been put together by going to goodwill and used book stores<br/>
searching out the best books I could find for them.  Although in the<br/>
past I have held the to a very ridged schedule.  I guess in the long run<br/>
we just want them to learn that they are special, loved and that we are<br/>
always here for them, beyond this I don&#39;t know what else I can do.<br/>
Enough of the rambling for now. Kyle</div>

when they have room to move about and a place where they can <br/>
have some adventures.<br/>
Where is your land?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well put Kyle, I&#39;ll pass it on to Dick, I&#39;m really not sure why he has <br/>
this thing about Dads staying home with the kids while the Mother <br/>
works, maybe it&#39;s just due to his age.....   Though in some ways I <br/>
think he may be envious.<br/>
