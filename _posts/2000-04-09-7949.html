&lt;&lt; my daughter received formula as her first meal.  IMO, if she was poorly <br/>

How do they decide who gets the donor milk?  Do you have to sign a medical <br/>
release form first?  That is surprising that they wouldn&#39;t give a sick baby <br/>
formula if possible.  Is SCBU the same as our NICU (neonatal intensive care <br/>
unit)?</div>
