<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240246126">Glad things are looking up for you Jill.  I can&#39;t remember how many <br/>
children you said you had,  but it sounds like you have a lot of <br/>
laundry.  If we had that many baskets full, nobody would have any <br/>
clothes left to wear.   Seriously,  we have tried to simplify in many <br/>
ways.  One thing we did was clean out our closets and get rid of all <br/>
the extra clothes.  We saved what we really like and will wear and <br/>
de-cluttered by getting rid of the rest.  We try not to have a lot <br/>
more than we really need.  This also helps with laundry because we <br/>
only have so many clothes and if they don&#39;t make it into the laundry, <br/>
they don&#39;t get washed.  It also helps us to be aware of who needs <br/>
what.   I feel so much better with less clutter around,  but I still <br/>
have some work to do.  It likes to creep back in when I&#39;m not <br/>
looking.   The hardest thing to part with (and we don&#39;t even try), is <br/>
BOOKS!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-17032372">I got home from retreat yesterday.  I did a lot of praying about the <br/>
condition of my home and my family while I was away.  As I drove up to my <br/>
house, I noticed 5 big black garbage bags out front.  And when I came up to <br/>
the door, the kids all came out of the house, bathed, wearing clean clothes, <br/>
and with their hair combed out.  Mark did a great job with them.  The 5 <br/>
garbage bags barely made a dent in the mess here, but it showed me that he <br/>
was making an effort.<br/>
<br/>
I prayed with him last night, which I haven&#39;t done in a long time.  I prayed <br/>
with the kids this morning.  We picked up all the dirty laundry from the <br/>
downstairs&#39; floors together -- 3 laundry baskets full.  Then I folded the <br/>
clean laundry (4 baskets) and each person put away their own clean clothes -- <br/>
and closed their dresser drawer.  <br/>
<br/>
I did not cook tonight, because the kitchen was still a mess.  I ordered <br/>
pizza with my last $20.  But then Sheila (age 7) and I cleaned the kitchen -- <br/>
washed all the dishes, picked up all the garbage, washed the counters, stove <br/>
and fridge.  Then Sheila wiped down the table.  We carried more clean laundry <br/>
upstairs (3 baskets), folded them and put them away.  The Sheila helped me <br/>
gather up dirty clothes that were laying around the floor upstairs (4 <br/>
baskets).  In case you lost count, that means I currently have 7 baskets of <br/>
dirty laundry to be done, and we still have 4 rooms to go through upstairs.  <br/>
Unfortunately, my washing machine is broken, so we have to wait until the <br/>
weekend to go to the laundromat.<br/>
<br/>
I bought 4 more laundry baskets today at the dollar store, and 4 smaller <br/>
baskets for the kids&#39; toys.  Somehow I lost my broom, so I have to get <br/>
another one as soon as I have some more money.  Oh well, it&#39;s always <br/>
something!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Jill</div>

 </span></blockquote>The fact that there are six of you explains a lot.  My daughter (19) <br/>
lives on her own so there are only three of us left at home.  You <br/>
probably have a lot of hand-me-down clothes to from on kid to <br/>
another.  We didn&#39;t have too much of this because my kids were 6 <br/>
years apart and one was a boy, one a girl.  We&#39;ve done the same thing <br/>
though - tried to get down to what we really need.  Anybody else <br/>
interested in simplifying.  I&#39;d love to hear ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-615899556">You know, whenever I go on a retreat  my husband is Sooooo glad to see me.  He<br/>
usually is at the door with open arms even before I get to the door.  He has told<br/>
me many times when I have gotten back (I go at least 2x a yr.) that he respects<br/>
me so much as a wife and mother because he gets a taste of what I deal with<br/>
daily!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad things are going better, now.  You need to get away more often.  What<br/>
kind of a retreat was it.  I belong to Aglow, a non-denominational, Spirit-filled<br/>
women&#39;s orginization.  They have spring and fall retreats each year.  They also<br/>
have national and international retreats.  It is a huge, world wide<br/>
orginization.  I come back so refreshed and ready for whatever fiery darts come<br/>
at me, if you know what I mean!<br/>
<br/>
Retreats are definately a God send!  Bless you!<br/>
<br/>
Living for Him,<br/>
Faith<br/>
Love is doing the highest good for the object of your love.<br/>
