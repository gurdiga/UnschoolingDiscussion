&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve been offering various books, opportunities to cook, he <br/>
<br/>
participated in helping to plan a cooking class for local homeschool <br/>
<br/>
kids that I offer once per month to a few local groups we belong to, <br/>
<br/>
we talk a lot, read, watch History Channel (his choice, not mine), <br/>
<br/>
etc.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not a very broad or exciting list, for my tastes and range.  <br/>
MAYBE he&#39;s a big reader and cook.  Otherwise, it doesn&#39;t sound like much <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He has a lot of opportunities presented daily.  There is no <br/>
<br/>
lack of opportunity or myself.  I am with him everyday and <br/>
<br/>
available. -=-<br/>

Maybe you should plan some things that are more than opportunities.  A day <br/>
trip (or overnighter, maybe, to see relatives and do something in the other <br/>
town), or a movie marathon (maybe you can borrow favorite videos from friends) or. <br/>
. .  something entirely different.<br/>
<br/>
Below are some ideas pre-written and maybe you&#39;ll get others on this list too.<br/>

That is about as broad as he likes.  Adrian is a one track kind of <br/>
guy and does not respond well to an overload of options.  Also, those <br/>
are items that he DOES find exciting.  If he was not interested, I <br/>
would not continue to offer them.  He LOVES to cook and plan meals.  <br/>
That is one thing that has not changed for him.  He has always liked <br/>
food.  Adrian also likes books VERY much.  He prefers to be read to, <br/>
so I make myself available for reading whenever possible.  We spend a <br/>
lot of time reading.  He is into the Series of Unfortunate Events.  <br/>
We are on book 6, and he owns them all.  He did read one of them <br/>
himself, but still prefers me to read to him.<br/>

<br/>
I have been thinking the same thing.  Thank you for reminding me.  <br/>
Adrian has a strong desire to travel.  It&#39;s definately time to do <br/>
something on the road.  Unfortunately, that can be rather difficult <br/>
for us, but we&#39;ll just have to figure a way.<br/>
