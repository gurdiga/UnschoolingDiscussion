&lt;&lt;when there is no one to argue with you, it changes everything i think.<br/>
you&#39;re sounding like you expect a trial to determine whether or not you<br/>
are a fit parent.  i think that only comes into play if someone else is<br/>
standing there wanting custody of your children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks so far to Lisa, Juli and Carolyn.  I think you are right above, <br/>
Carolyn. During this time,  I was also disabled from a motorcycle accident I <br/>
was in with him and I&#39;ve worried about that, and you know what it is really-  <br/>
I have had no support from family at all (upon finding out how badly I was <br/>
hurt and that her father had left us- my brother told my then two year old <br/>
that she needed to go home with him- it really cut me to the core.  If he <br/>
were the last human on earth, she would NEVER go with him or anyone else in <br/>
my family of origin), and the more hurt and in pain I was, the more they <br/>
tried to scare me with all kinds of things.  My family is crazy.  Very <br/>
self-centered people.  I think because they have given me such a hard time in <br/>
the past (now, I am much better and everything is coming together- so I don&#39;t <br/>
care much or allow them to hurt me any longer- I will also be leaving them <br/>
behind soon), I have had this fear that a higher &quot;authority&quot; will try to hurt <br/>
me or judge me in some way and I&#39;ll have to explain myself.  It does make <br/>
sense inside my heart and mind that they won&#39;t even ask me anything.  I <br/>
really know it will come together very easily, in the way that Ariel and I <br/>
need.  <br/>
<br/>
Boy, what a load off my shoulders this is!  :-)  I guess I just need(ed) some <br/>
reassurance.  I&#39;ve had a tough time with people (usually those supposedly <br/>
&#39;close&#39; to me) judging me and my life.  When it is the best and most pleasant <br/>
life for us I know.  I&#39;m starting to believe that people are actually jealous <br/>
of the way we choose to live our lives, and in this jealousy, they try to <br/>
hurt us.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you! Vic</div>

parents. I am different from them and they can&#39;t handle it, so they <br/>
have chosen to say all kinds of awful, hurtful things to me. They are <br/>
nuts. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>**Yes, for me, after some therapy, I realized it was jealousy, too.<br/>
It sucks, doesn&#39;t it? People (mostly family, for me) get jealous just <br/>
because I&#39;m living my life MY way. Most people don&#39;t have the guts to <br/>
live their lives in their own way, so I can understand the jealousy <br/>
they harbor at people that do. I don&#39;t say the jealousy is right, I <br/>
just understand where they are coming from. Do you have supportive <br/>
friends? I believe we have two families in this life: the one we were <br/>
born into and the one we form with friends that love us for who we<br/>
are and what we try to do. I have lots of friends that think I am a <br/>
wonderful person and they can&#39;t understand WHERE my family comes off <br/>
thinking that way about me!<br/>
