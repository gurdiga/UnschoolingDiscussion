<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589965653"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I just went and voted...I cannot believe that there are 27% of the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>voters that think it hurts :o)  Boy, they must not know too many<br/>
homeschooled/unschooled children!!!&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I had to mention that a friend of mine went to visit the school her dc<br/>
would be going to next year (her dd wants to Homeschool because a lot of<br/>
her friends do)  at the school her dd expressed her discontent at having<br/>
to go to school and mentioned her friends homeschooled.  The teachers<br/>
response was &quot;but think of all the new people you are going to meet next<br/>
year.  All the kids that Homeschool will have to play by themselves,<br/>
they won&#39;t meet any new people!&quot;  I&#39;m glad my eyebrows are attached to<br/>
my face because when my friend told me that I think they almost flew<br/>
off!  I was a bit shocked that the teacher would tell her such a lie.<br/>
Some kids may stay home, but on the average, at least here, the kids get<br/>
to meet and know some really interesting people all year round.<br/>

This is actually something that I get every time I tell people that <br/>
we homeschool.  &quot;But, how will she interact with other people.&quot;  Or, <br/>
when I suggest that someone take their child out of school (after <br/>
they have complained over and over that they hate the school <br/>
systme) &quot;But, she/he won&#39;t get to see other kids, I would feel bad <br/>
about that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I then go on to explain that my DD gets to meet lots of <br/>
people, and not just kids &quot;her own age.&quot;  That we go to playgroups <br/>
and activites with other homeschooling families, &quot;fieldtrips&quot; to <br/>
lots of interesting places.  And, that we get to do it all year <br/>
round and whenever we feel like it.  I usually get shocked looks and <br/>
responses....not sure what they thought we actually did all day?<br/>

activity, when do your children do school??&quot; ROTFL!<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>
