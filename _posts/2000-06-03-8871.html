Thanks for rambling....I am just getting into organic and natural foods, so I <br/>
am always interested in what others are doing and how the are thinking.  You <br/>
make some very good points.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-717737098">Hi everybody, can anyone give me some info on &#39;washing soda&#39;? Emily, 5,<br/>
found a recipe for growing crystals and it called for washing soda. We found<br/>
some, made by Arm and Hammer, and it appears to be very similar to Borax. I<br/>
use Borax in laundry and to pick up stains on the carpet and to wash the<br/>
floors, as it is supposed to be environmentally friendly. Does anyone know<br/>
if washing soda is as well?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!!!<br/>

I use Washing Soda... for me it has worked better than borax.  As far as I<br/>
know, all A&H products are PH balanced and phosphate free.<br/>
