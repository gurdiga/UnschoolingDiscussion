<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079096075">Tia asked about Elizabeth Haydon, who I mentioned in my last post. She is a<br/>
fantasy writer-put the &quot;writer&quot; before the &quot;fantasy&quot; because she is<br/>
extremely talented.<br/>
Her first book is called &quot;Rhapsody&quot;, and it&#39;s the first of a trilogy. It&#39;s<br/>
got a lot to offer---action, steamy romance,  magic, weird otherworld<br/>
creatures, and a female protagonist who kicks butt.<br/>
&quot;Requiem for the Sun&quot; is her fourth. You can read a sample at<br/>
