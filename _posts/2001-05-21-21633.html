<div id="ygrps-yiv-70909138">BlankDo you restrict your child&#39;s TV time?? I read somewhere in the (Unschooling Handbook??) that one should trust your child to be responsible about it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried that, but I do worry that my three-year old might veg out too much infront of the TV if I let him. He watces videos - so that is okay, but he can really get mesmerised by it all. I don&#39;t restrict it yet, but I always try to suggest another activity when he asks to watch TV. Sometimes he takes it and others not. I don&#39;t mind some vegging.<br/>
