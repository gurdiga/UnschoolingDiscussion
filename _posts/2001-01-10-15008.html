&lt;&lt; What I would love is maybe we could do a thread on our<br/>
 kids if you feel like sharing about what they are<br/>
 doing. Maybe if we get others looking from the outside<br/>
 we might see what our children are doing from another<br/>
 perspective.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Melina (10) has had three teachers identify her as academically &quot;gifted&quot; but <br/>
not tested. My husband identifies her as socially gifted. She gets along <br/>
incredibly well with people of many different backgrounds and ages. We have <br/>
moved numerous times and she has always found a best friend within days. The <br/>
gift I most appreciate in her is her capacity for empathy and compassion.<br/>
<br/>
What she&#39;s up to.....She has decided she wants to create an original recipe <br/>
for a dessert. Last night she made a list of ingredients and we went to the <br/>
store so she could shop for them. Today she&#39;ll start experimenting. She is <br/>
very excited about all this, and really enjoys cooking. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s taking swimming lessons, looking to get back into karate and waiting <br/>
for the next session of Junior Rangers to start. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39; reviewing fractions, percentages, and decimals, and working on improving <br/>
her Spanish vocabulary and reading skills. In English, she is reading A <br/>
Wrinkle In Time again, as well as this month&#39;s mother/daughter book club <br/>
selection. She also likes going to cafes with me to do some fiction writing, <br/>
but only in small doses. <br/>
<br/>
She continues to be a great help to me around the house and with the younger <br/>
kids, and I can see her level of responsibilty growing considerably.<br/>
<br/>
She has expressed an interest in sewing, so we&#39;re going to get her some <br/>
supplies this weekend. She&#39;s on her own, because I am domestically challenged.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She hasn&#39;t designed any rockets or won any chess tournaments (though she does <br/>
like to play with Daddy), but we&#39;re having a great time. <br/>
