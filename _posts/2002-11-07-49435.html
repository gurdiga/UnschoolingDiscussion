<div id="ygrps-yiv-413677991">If I am following all these qualifications of what it means to be<br/>
a non-fundamentalist Christian, insofar as the term is used here, you<br/>
must have these characteristics:<br/>
<br/>
- you believe vile acts of crime are ok and we should feel criminal&#39;s<br/>
pain<br/>
- you believe that the wife should not submit to the husband whatsoever<br/>
- you believe that right and wrong are grey areas and there is no Hell<br/>
- you believe that your church pastor is never right<br/>
- you believe you have a duty enforce &quot;if it feels good do it&quot; philosophy<br/>
- you believe that there is no accurate translation of the Bible and it<br/>
what it says anyway is just a myth...but its a pretty good book like<br/>
Grapes of Wrath or the Koran<br/>
<br/>
Have I missed anything? Must all or some number be present?<br/>
Have I misstated any?<br/>
<br/>
There is no doubt that this is EXACTLY what you believe so don&#39;t try to<br/>
change anything because I am right and know all of your beliefs.<br/>

Hey, Doug, I don&#39;t think the poster WAS stereotyping - I think she was trying to get a handle on what people here  may mean when they  might talk disparagingly of Christians/ fundamentalists. And pointing out the stereotyping herself...Leoni W.<br/>

&gt; Hey Nora or Dev...get a life and learn not to stereotype and<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Doug Constant<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wowee, Doug!  I have to stick up for Nora.  I&#39;ve seen her posts for a <br/>
number of weeks now and they seem to me to be filled with dry wit and <br/>
a willingness to get to the heart of a situation.  I have to admit <br/>
that one of her posts was so subtle in its humor that even she didn&#39;t <br/>
think it was funny (but I did).<br/>
<br/>
I read the entire day&#39;s worth of posts tonight and it looks to me <br/>
like Nora was wanting to capture in one place all the characteristics <br/>
that others were listing about fundamentalist Christians.  And by the <br/>
way, &quot;fundamentalist&quot; is not being used in the classical dictionary <br/>
sense, but is...well, I think Nora&#39;s list summed up the sense of <br/>
today&#39;s posts quite succinctly.<br/>
<br/>
If you didn&#39;t read the whole thread today, then let me add that many <br/>
of these posters grew up as, or knew, people like this, and continue <br/>
to meet people who match this description.  It was a shock to me to <br/>
read, because the Christians I&#39;ve known (even fundamentalists) do not <br/>
match most of those characteristics (well, some have a couple of <br/>
them).  But this is their experience, summed up in Nora&#39;s post.<br/>
<br/>
May I ask why you suggested that she get a life?  I think this post <br/>
proves she knows about stereotyping and discrimination and is subtly <br/>
recommending against it.  <br/>
<br/>
By the way, a couple of posters from this group are accepting your e-<br/>
mailed invitation to join the Pentacostal homeschoolers listgroup.  I <br/>
did so myself.  I wonder if we&#39;ll see many of the characteristics <br/>
that Nora listed?<br/>

<br/>
NO.  At least that list DID list beliefs of fundamentalist Christians.<br/>
<br/>
Your list was provocative bullshit.<br/>
Reminds me of the LAME argument that EITHER the earth was created in six <br/>
days, or evolution is true.  Oh no, that&#39;s not how the argument goes.  It&#39;s <br/>
IF evolution isn&#39;t exactly true, THEN that proves the earth was created in <br/>
six days.<br/>

<br/>
THAT is who has used the addresses from this list to invite people onto a <br/>
Pentecostal Homeschooling group?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If YOU want to know about unschooling, this is a good list to be on.<br/>
<br/>
If I want to know about Pentecostalism (more than I already know from having <br/>
attended with relatives in Texas), I will go online and get that information.<br/>

Wow, good catch Mike!! I didn&#39;t even notice it was the same person.<br/>
Is that how we all got an invite from the pentacostal list, really? They must <br/>
be trying to save us all!!<br/>
