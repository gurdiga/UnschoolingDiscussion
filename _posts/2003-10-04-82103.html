.  When I stopped just leaving other people&#39;s stuff <br/>
around for them to notice and pick up, and just started doing it myself,<br/>
I <br/>
noticed they started picking up more.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was a happy day when I started using all the time I was &quot;nagging&quot; at<br/>
them to put away thier clothes and just started doing it myself! What a<br/>
time saver. I was the only one who cared that much that they go away<br/>
&quot;right now&quot;. So I started doing it &quot;right now&quot;, which was really alot<br/>
faster because all that nag-time was missing! And now...they see thier<br/>
clothes and take them back on the way to their room. Maybe once I stopped<br/>
making it an issue, they felt free to.<br/>

My husband dislocated his shoulder when our son was only a few weeks <br/>
old.  And for several weeks there after he was unable to hold the baby, <br/>
so he couldn&#39;t carry him to the bathroom for diaper changes.  Even <br/>
though I was exhausted post-partum, I actually did find it easier to <br/>
change every single diaper, by necessity, than to &quot;negotiate&quot; with him. <br/>
  The negotiating and the nagging were more exhausting, truthfully.  I <br/>
was certainly surprised to discover this.<br/>
<br/>
Nagging is more misery-inducing, even in the nagger, than a diaper full <br/>
of sh*t.  That&#39;s something for me to remember when the nagging mood <br/>
strikes! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
