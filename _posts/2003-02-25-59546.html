 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t necessarily call Sierra an &quot;early&quot; reader, I&#39;m assuming you mean <br/>
children under five. But this totally unschooled child is teaching herself to <br/>
read at age five and doesn&#39;t have any program or coaching, just a Mom that <br/>
reads to her, answers her questions and has a lot of paper and pens available.<br/>
She writes more neatly than Trevor did at age 11, loves to write and can <br/>
sound out a lot of words now.<br/>
It amazes me constantly how into it they get when there is a desire.....and <br/>
no coercion.<br/>
This is a very strong willed, independent child and if it was someone elses <br/>
idea that she &quot;should&quot; learn to read, I have a feeling it would have taken <br/>
much longer!!<br/>

magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son&#39;s 6 and can read basic stuff. He seems to take a phonic-like <br/>
approach in sounding words out as he goes along. I don&#39;t have a clue <br/>
at what age he will become a fluent/proficient reader, but he seems <br/>
to be approaching it in large spurts at times and then plateaus off <br/>
for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is already sight-reading lots of words (she&#39;s 3) (the <br/>
other day she read the word &quot;organic&quot; from a label) and I have a <br/>
feeling that she might learn to read like I did. I learned to read at <br/>
age 4, just from my parents reading out loud to me. One day I just <br/>
realized that I knew what all the words were. At first, I think my <br/>
parents thought that I had just memorized everything, but I was <br/>
really reading it. By the time I entered first grade, I was reading <br/>
adult chapter books, so they put me in a 4th grade reading class. I&#39;m <br/>
guessing that my daughter&#39;s brain works the same as mine, because she <br/>
seems to have a lot of our books &quot;memorized&quot; and I&#39;m guessing that <br/>
will probably someday just click into reading for her.<br/>
<br/>
I just recently read an interesting article about brain research and <br/>
how they&#39;ve discovered that there&#39;s two major groups of readers. I&#39;m <br/>
going to paraphrase this really badly from my poor recollection, but <br/>
from what I recall, in one type of people, the words go directly to <br/>
one spot in their brain with no translation. I would say this is how <br/>
I read - I&#39;m not really even aware of the words I&#39;m reading, I just <br/>
see the pictures in my head, kind of like thoughts, and I read really <br/>
fast. For me, listening to books on tape are a form of torture, <br/>
because I actually hear the words, which I don&#39;t when I&#39;m reading.<br/>
<br/>
For the other type of reader, the words actually have to be <br/>
translated in another part of the brain first. They determined this <br/>
via MRIs I believe. In the study, they showed that these types <br/>
of readers were pervasive throughout their lives. I saw it as more <br/>
evidence that it makes absolutely no sense to push kids to read early <br/>
when they&#39;re obviously not ready for it. If you have a kid whose <br/>
brain is the decoding type, they&#39;re going to seem like a &quot;late&quot; <br/>
reader, but in reality their brain has to take more steps to read, it <br/>
has to go through this whole translation scheme. Other kids just seem <br/>
to get it via osmosis, and those are probably the early readers, and <br/>
people who are very fast readers in later life. There&#39;s not anything <br/>
inherently &quot;better&quot; or &quot;smarter&quot; about these people, they just have a <br/>
different brain setup with regards to this one skill of reading.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d hazard a guess that the &quot;translator&quot; kind of reader is more <br/>
common than the &quot;straight through&quot; type of reader, therefore it would <br/>
be more likely for unschoolers to read later than the norm if more of <br/>
them have to pick up these translating skills without being <br/>
arbitrarily forced to do it early, before their brains are ready to <br/>
do it easily.<br/>
<br/>
What I felt really sad about is how many kids are convinced that <br/>
they&#39;re stupid because they can&#39;t read at age 7, or whenever our <br/>
school system says that they should, when maybe they just have this <br/>
totally different brain pattern than the early readers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-424159863">Keith reads the words, and so he&#39;s more likely to remember the people&#39;s names <br/>
and exact quotes than I am.  I have the story, but not so much in order as I <br/>
remember scenes and feelings.  (That&#39;s about non-fiction stuff.)<br/>
<br/>
I read non-fiction differently, and more often.  <br/>

Robin, do you have any idea where you read this, so I have some idea where to <br/>
start searching for it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
