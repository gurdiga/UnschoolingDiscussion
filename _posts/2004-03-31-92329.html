<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931493666"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Is there a list for single parent homeschoolers?  You would think perhaps <br/>
 </span></blockquote>there might be.  I know several in our local area and while it&#39;s definitely <br/>
challenging and sometimes a seemingly daunting task - women make it work (and I <br/>
suppose some men would as well - just don&#39;t know any).&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Here are two single parent list to check out, and the last link is a great <br/>
homeschool resource site.  The last link contains a list of resources for single <br/>
parent homeschoolers. Hope this helps.<br/>

This is a list for single moms who homeschool their children. This is open to <br/>
all single moms, no matter what type of curriculum they choose to use. It is <br/>
predominantly a Christian list -- though others are welcome, also. To allow <br/>
for free conversation and protect the privacy of the list members, it is a <br/>
restricted list. New members will have to be admitted by the list owner. <br/>

I am a single mom who homeschools. It can be done:) <br/>
Please join for support or comfort. <br/>
Lets share together how we do it. Whether you are Christian, Jew, Muslim or <br/>
Atheist, I want you to feel comfortable. We all have a common bond in being <br/>
single parents and homeschoolers. So let&#39;s remember the Golden Rule in all our <br/>
posts. <br/>
