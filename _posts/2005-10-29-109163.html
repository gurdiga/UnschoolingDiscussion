<div id="ygrps-yiv-252461905">Hi folks!<br/>
 <br/>
At the recent Live and Learn Unschooling Conference in St. Louis, Kelly  <br/>
Lovejoy ran a Funshop about conference planning. The conference has become so  big <br/>
she recognized that there was a need for additional local conferences.   <br/>
Sooo.......<br/>
 <br/>
I wanted to give people early notice about the  Northeast Unschooling <br/>
Conference to be held in the spring (Memorial Day  Weekend) in Peabody, <br/>
Massachusetts. There&#39;s a VERY preliminary website up, but  there will be updates soon. <br/>
 <br/>
The website is _www.NortheastUnschoolingConference.com_ <br/>
(http://www.NortheastUnschoolingConference.com) . <br/>
 <br/>
Check us out, and we&#39;ll have more details soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-388783618">Hi folks!<br/>
Finally, the first update of the Northeast Unschooling conference web site  <br/>
is complete!  We&#39;re ready to take registrations, and the hotel is ready for  <br/>
your reservations. The conference will be held Memorial Day weekend, May 26-28  <br/>
at the Marriott Hotel in Peabody, Massachusetts, north of Boston.There will be <br/>
 additional optional activities to be announced for Monday, so consider <br/>
whether  you&#39;d like to reserve an extra night at the hotel and stay and make a <br/>
great  Unschooling Long Weekend. <br/>
 <br/>
I am taking proposals for Funshops and Presenters for a few more spaces,  and <br/>
I am now also taking Scholarship applications. (By the way, two people  wrote <br/>
with proposals for some presentations, and the e-mails got lost. If you  have <br/>
not heard from me, PLEASE write again!!!)<br/>
 <br/>
Visit _www.northeastunschoolingconference.com_ <br/>
(http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com)  for  more information.<br/>
