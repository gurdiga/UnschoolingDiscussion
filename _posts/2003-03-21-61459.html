I am reading The Plug-In Drug.  It was recommended, during a discussion on<br/>
another list, as a book that explains why TV is bad for kids and other<br/>
people.<br/>

I have the 2002 revised edition.  The author uses false logic and parent<br/>

I&#39;d be glad to put it on a website.   I&#39;ve been collecting good parts for a <br/>
free-media-access page for my website already.<br/>
<br/>
When I read that book years ago (before it was &quot;improved&quot; ? &lt;g&gt;) I was struck <br/>
by its assumptions and wanted to say &quot;Yeah, but...&quot; all the time I was <br/>
reading.  I didn&#39;t bother to finish it or to write to the author and say <br/>
&quot;yeah, but...&quot; because she had her fervent agenda, but it wasn&#39;t anything <br/>
like my own.<br/>
<br/>
Good for you, Mary Ellen, if you&#39;re willing to share a detailed review so <br/>
others don&#39;t have to read it if they don&#39;t want to.<br/>

My most verbal anti-TV acquaintance is also so narrowly &quot;intelligent&quot; that <br/>
she&#39;s practically an idiot-savant (only I&#39;m not sure where here savantitude <br/>
might lie, but she&#39;s proud to be second generation Mensa, so fine; whatever). <br/>
  Someone here or at the forum last year had found something about a <br/>
&quot;disability&quot; in which the person could only learn from the printed word.  <br/>
Nothing else worked at all as to useful input.  That&#39;s her!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s also the anti-TV author.<br/>
<br/>
I notice lots of times that an expert will say &quot;THIS is the one way learning <br/>
and education and school should work for all kids,&quot; and then I note that it <br/>
seems to be most likely the way it worked for THAT person and his own kids.<br/>
<br/>
And I think that about unschooling sometimes.  Yeah, sure swirling through <br/>
all the info in the world around me works for me.  TONS of it sticks.  Works <br/>
for my kids too.<br/>
<br/>
Are there people for whom it won&#39;t work?  Seems so.  What are the criteria?  <br/>
I don&#39;t like to think about it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-886331946">Safe TV limits declared!!  Here is the amount that kids can watch before<br/>
their school grades will be impacted.  A 1999 *survey* showed that children<br/>
could watch 4 hours and 34 minutes of &quot;screen activities&quot; (TV, video games,<br/>
etc.) and still get good grades.  Kids who watch 5 hours and 27 minutes will<br/>
get &quot;fair to poor&quot; grades.<br/>
<br/>
The book didn&#39;t tell what happens to the kids who watch 4 hours and 35<br/>
minutes.  Maybe they are the ones who get &quot;good to fair&quot; grades.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Course, this is an unschooling list, so the impact of TV upon grades is not<br/>
relevant here.<br/>

TLC, Food Network (my 3 year old LOVES Emeril &quot;I watch<br/>
BAM! Mommy?!), National Geographic shows, Nova, A&E,<br/>
History Channel...there is SO much on there that is<br/>
great. Sarah is an audio learner and while she may not<br/>
pay attention to something that is on TV, she&#39;ll later<br/>
come up to us talking about something she heard about<br/>
sharks, or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
Me, if I threw out the TV (and I&#39;m tempted to often<br/>
when all they want to do is watch cartoons) it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t bother me a bit as long as I had books and a<br/>
radio. But my husband isn&#39;t a reader, so we&#39;ll keep it<br/>
and do our best to use it wisely!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951448482">I don&#39;t know how much time and energy I am willing to put into this, but it<br/>
is tempting to look up all of the studies cited and see for myself what the<br/>
studies say, how they were performed, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Winn mentions another study where two groups of boys were compared.  They<br/>
were looking for a link between TV viewing and violence.  &quot;One group had<br/>
seen little or no TV in the previous two years while the other had watched<br/>
an average of 42 hours a week for the same period of time&quot;  (This study was<br/>
in the 70&#39;s and was only TV, didn&#39;t include other video activities.)<br/>
<br/>
How did they track the hours spent watching TV over the &quot;previous two<br/>
years&quot;?  Did they find a bunch of kids to study, then have them keep track<br/>
of TV viewing for two years?  I doubt it!<br/>
<br/>
As I continue to read this book I find myself increasingly annoyed with it.<br/>
However, I think it will be helpful to know where people are coming from<br/>
when they argue against TV, to better counter their arguments.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-61226654">I got a book out of the library called Ready for Reading: A Handbook<br/>
for Parents of Preschoolers.  It took about two paragraphs of the<br/>
introduction to alienate me.  It looked like a book full of fun<br/>
activities to do that expand on childrens books, but right from the<br/>
start it turned out to be a lecture against electrical toys: a TV,<br/>
electronic games, a joystick, a VCR, a stereo, and an astonishing<br/>
variety of remote controls.<br/>
 <br/>
It gives an example of a family that promotes reading.  The kid is read<br/>
to quietly before bed and is learning.  In the second example, of a<br/>
family that apparently has idiot kids who wont ever read, has harsh<br/>
sounds emanating from whatever electronic device is being played<br/>
within.  The first child drifts quietly off to sleep.  For the second<br/>
child, sleep, when it comes, is not gentle.  All this right in the<br/>
intro.<br/>
 <br/>
I really resent the implication that letting kids play video games means<br/>
that your home doesnt promote reading.  I have my choice of TV, videos,<br/>
the computer, or books, and I use each daily.  I read more books than<br/>
anyone I know.  The more I read, the faster I read, and Ive been<br/>
reading three books a day for a long time, not to mention all the books<br/>
I read to my children.  I read them hundreds of books each year, which<br/>
is why Im always on the lookout for books that recommend childrens<br/>
books.  And I dont read bedtime stories.  My son plays computer games<br/>
before bed.  His recent choices have been Thomas the Tank Engine Railway<br/>
Adventures, Zoo Tycoon, and Blues Clues Kindergarten.<br/>
 <br/>
I was telling my husband earlier (after reading the intro and tossing<br/>
the book down) that its really naïve in this day and age for educators<br/>
to ignore the learning that goes on when children use computers and<br/>
videos.  Im a huge bibliophile, but come on.  How could anyone say, in<br/>
2000 (the copyright date), that the kid whos read a bedtime story is<br/>
learning more than the kid who play video games before bed?  Gag.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-381891528">I have had a real problem with the TV. When the boys were little they<br/>
watched it all day! It was all they ever wanted to do.<br/>
<br/>
We have had pretty strict rules about the TV since they were 5 and it has<br/>
been the one area I have been very reluctant to loosen up with.<br/>
 When we officially began homeschooling the TV could only be watched on the<br/>
weekend. It seemed to work well and the kids played longer.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, now I am questioning everything!!! It&#39;s driving me nuts! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think they would go back to waching it all day coz life is much more<br/>
fun than it used to be now that we are unschooling. Well, maybe my oldest<br/>
boy would.<br/>
<br/>
I am hugely biased toward books but I guess I am getting past the idea that<br/>
everyone has to think that.<br/>
<br/>
Once you start to remove the rules, you begin to question all the rules you<br/>
ever set. I haven&#39;t come up with any good answers yet!<br/>
<br/>
So, as of yesterday, TV limits are off. Wish me luck!<br/>

&gt; I notice lots of times that an expert will say &quot;THIS is the one way<br/>
learning<br/>
&gt; and education and school should work for all kids,&quot; and then I note that<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; seems to be most likely the way it worked for THAT person and his own<br/>
kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I think that about unschooling sometimes.  Yeah, sure swirling through<br/>
&gt; all the info in the world around me works for me.  TONS of it sticks.<br/>
Works<br/>
&gt; for my kids too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are there people for whom it won&#39;t work?  Seems so.  What are the<br/>
criteria?<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t like to think about it.<br/>

&gt; I wonder too that children&#39;s picture books aren&#39;t mentioned as a problem,<br/>
&gt; only TV.  TV is bad, according to the author, because it gives you the<br/>
&gt; image, whereas in reading you have to form the image yourself in your<br/>
brain.<br/>
&gt; Maybe the real culprit behind lower reading scores, etc., is children&#39;s<br/>
&gt; picture books!<br/>

I understand and agree with everything you have said. My oldest<br/>
learned to read by playing the role-playing game Harvest Moon. {she<br/>

Any one who has seen this game knows just playing it a little is<br/>
mind work {there is a storyline of a &quot;young man&quot; that receives a run<br/>
down farm and it&#39;s his job to get it up and running again and get<br/>

&gt;I got a book out of the library called �Ready for Reading: A Handbook<br/>
&gt;for Parents of Preschoolers.�  It took about two paragraphs of the<br/>
&gt;introduction to alienate me.  It looked like a book full of fun<br/>
&gt;activities to do that expand on children�s books, but right from the<br/>
&gt;start it turned out to be a lecture against �electrical toys: a TV,<br/>
&gt;electronic games, a joystick, a VCR, a stereo, and an astonishing<br/>
&gt;variety of remote controls�.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It gives an example of a family that promotes reading.  The kid is read<br/>
&gt;to quietly before bed and is learning.  In the second example, of a<br/>
&gt;family that apparently has idiot kids who won�t ever read, has �harsh<br/>
&gt;sounds emanating from whatever electronic device is being played<br/>
&gt;within.�  The first child drifts quietly off to sleep.  For the second<br/>
&gt;child, �sleep, when it comes, is not gentle�.  All this right in the<br/>
&gt;intro.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I really resent the implication that letting kids play video games means<br/>
&gt;that your home doesn�t promote reading.  I have my choice of TV, videos,<br/>
&gt;the computer, or books, and I use each daily.  I read more books than<br/>
&gt;anyone I know.  The more I read, the faster I read, and I�ve been<br/>
&gt;reading three books a day for a long time, not to mention all the books<br/>
&gt;I read to my children.  I read them hundreds of books each year, which<br/>
&gt;is why I�m always on the lookout for books that recommend children�s<br/>
&gt;books.  And I don�t read �bedtime stories�.  My son plays computer games<br/>
&gt;before bed.  His recent choices have been Thomas the Tank Engine Railway<br/>
&gt;Adventures, Zoo Tycoon, and Blues Clues Kindergarten.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was telling my husband earlier (after reading the intro and tossing<br/>
&gt;the book down) that it�s really na�ve in this day and age for educators<br/>

&lt;&lt; My 12 yodd and 10yodd enjoy listening to books on tape just before they <br/>
fall <br/>
<br/>
asleep.  I wonder what the author of that book would say about that.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My guess would be that they would say the most important thing about a parent <br/>
reading the child to sleep is the interaction.  But I think that partly <br/>
because I think the book is about control more than anything, and the author <br/>
seems to want to tell people what to do, and give it a pseudo-scientific <br/>
justification.   <br/>
<br/>
A book on tape beats my reading at night, because I fall asleep reading if <br/>
it&#39;s dark and there&#39;s a bed involved in any way.  <br/>
<br/>
And by that &quot;interaction&quot; argument it should be just as good for the parent <br/>
to sing to the child or to tell how the day went, or make up fantasy stories. <br/>
 *I* think it&#39;s as good.  But those who defend book reading are, I believe, <br/>
influenced by the belief that there are certain books people must have in <br/>
them.  I think there are ideas that are good to have, but they&#39;re in places <br/>
other than specifically prescribed books.<br/>
<br/>
And the bigger thing is that all those researchers and theorists and <br/>
parenting advisors of the past (and most of the present) had not even <br/>
considered the differences there would be if a child didn&#39;t go to school, but <br/>
spent the whole week, the whole year, at home with parents, and out and about <br/>
with parents.  Bedtime is no longer the only possibility for quiet <br/>
interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s been wanting me to tuck her in lately, and I do.  I wish she&#39;d go to <br/>
sleep earlier sometimes!  And in the past week I&#39;ve gone to sleep before her <br/>
twice, but I did all the set-up I  usually do, and put the bedlamp on and <br/>
turned the covers down and got her &#39;s the mom-prepared bed-nest she seems to <br/>
really want.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think it will be helpful to know where people are coming from<br/>
&gt; when they argue against TV, to better counter their arguments.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think TV does work for many families, but for my own reasons I<br/>
decided to get rid of it...  having it completely gone was a lot<br/>
easier for me than trying to sift through the programming in order to<br/>
find shows that were worth watching.  There weren&#39;t very many.  I am<br/>
also highly selective with books I pick out to read...  I just find<br/>
that there is so much over-stimulation these days that I want my home<br/>
to be a refuge from the media.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure why people say that they can have unrestricted TV in<br/>
their house *and* also find the time to do all the other things they<br/>
want to do with their kids.  I say, &quot;Bravo!&quot; if you can do that.  I<br/>
sure can&#39;t.  It is my experience that the television watching directly<br/>
interferes with contact with other human beings, contact with the<br/>
natural world, and relaxing and getting enough sleep, among other<br/>
things.  It directly interfered with or replaced story-telling, music,<br/>
walks outdoors, and the like in our family, all things that I love and<br/>
my daughter loves.  The other thing I hated about television was that<br/>
when we did have it, it was too easy for me to use it as a babysitter.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I have watched children&#39;s television programming, all it said<br/>
to me is: here is the way to train little kids to be good members of<br/>
society.  get them excited about compulsory schooling, distract them<br/>
from what the world is REALLY like-- make them think it is always<br/>
happy, with bright, primary colours, and animals that smile and talk<br/>
and also go to school.  I do think television is addictive-- our<br/>
physiology has no way of dealing with it, because it is so different<br/>
than anything in nature, and believe it or not, we have evolved over<br/>
millenia to be part of nature.  TV is not a waterfall, it is not a<br/>
flock of geese, it is not a replacement for an actual sensorial<br/>
experience of nature.<br/>
<br/>
i haven&#39;t read any of the anti-TV books, but these are some of my<br/>
thoughts anyway.<br/>

is something that we do on our &quot;down time&quot;, when we&#39;re tired and <br/>
need to relax. <br/>
<br/>
Or sometimes we use it because tv is full of really cool ideas.  <br/>
Today at the park when my kids were pretending that the merry-go-<br/>
round was a time machine, I thought about the movie &quot;Back to the <br/>
Future&quot;.  They have never watched it and I think that my son <br/>
especially would REALLY like it.  He loves the idea of inventions <br/>
and cool contraptions that he can make and would REALLY find <br/>
enjoyment from that movie.  I can&#39;t wait to watch it with him.  But <br/>
not tonight--Blank Check is on tv tonight, and I think they&#39;ll <br/>
really enjoy that too.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hate the &quot;stay in school&quot; commercials, the constant preaching from <br/>
the media that &quot;school is cool&quot;, the getting kids excited about <br/>
school and even daycare on Barney, Sesame Street, Arthur, etc.  I <br/>
REALLY think it would be cool, as part of their accepting others <br/>
themes, to have homeschoolers and UNSCHOOLERS represented on their <br/>
shows.  Can you picture it?  The Barney kids come out of their <br/>
school and there is a new boy already playing with Barney.  They <br/>
introduce themselves and ask him why he&#39;s not in school.  He <br/>
explains that he&#39;s homeschooled and that he spends ALL DAY playing <br/>
with Barney while they&#39;re in school, but that he would be glad to <br/>
come by after they get out of school to play with them too.  ;)   <br/>
<br/>
I do think television is addictive-- our<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Personally, I find the computer to be much more addictive than tv.  <br/>
Dh is more attracted to the tv than I am.  Different personalities.  <br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t resist pointing out that you&#39;re putting down tv because <br/>
it&#39;s not a replacement for an actual sensorial experience of nature <br/>
while you&#39;re typing on a COMPUTER.  A computer isn&#39;t a replacement <br/>
for actual sensorial experience of nature either. ;)  Or are you on <br/>
a high-tech laptop sitting beside a waterfall as you type?  &lt;grin&gt;  <br/>

&lt;&lt; I am not sure why people say that they can have unrestricted TV in<br/>
their house *and* also find the time to do all the other things they<br/>
want to do with their kids.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They say that because it&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
I AM sure why people suggest that unrestricted TV would mean TV on all day.  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t happen when people actually lift restrictions.  It is a fantasy or <br/>
fear of the restricted.<br/>
<br/>
If I limit or banish TV and then my kids do things with me, will they will be <br/>
doing it because they have no choice. I want to be interesting enough that my <br/>
kids will turn the TV off to do something with me, and I am, and they do.  <br/>
But unless it were an emergency I would never ask anyone, kid or adult, to <br/>
turn a show off if they were really interested and it wasn&#39;t on tape or DVD. <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t ask someone to stop reading NOW and help me do something.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t wake someone up from peaceful sleep just because I wanted them to do <br/>
something with me.  I see all those things as similar.  People make choices <br/>
about where to be and why and then will amend their choices to do something <br/>
different or better. <br/>
<br/>
It happens here all the time, every day.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It is my experience that the television watching directly<br/>
interferes with contact with other human beings, contact with the<br/>
natural world, and relaxing and getting enough sleep, among other<br/>
things. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That has not been my experience at all.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It directly interfered with or replaced story-telling, music,<br/>
walks outdoors, and the like in our family, all things that I love and<br/>
my daughter loves.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It IS music.  We have and do live music too, here, and other means of <br/>
recorded music.  But if there&#39;s to be recorded music, I&#39;d rather the kids <br/>
have a chance to see the musicians at work than just to hear the music in the <br/>
absence of knowing what instruments are being used.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I do think television is addictive-- our<br/>
physiology has no way of dealing with it, because it is so different<br/>
than anything in nature, and believe it or not, we have evolved over<br/>
millenia to be part of nature. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds good but doesn&#39;t make clean sense to me.    I hope others will <br/>
comment, because I have only 20 minutes until two other musicians are coming <br/>
over to play with me and my husband for a couple of hours.   Kirby&#39;s at work, <br/>
Marty&#39;s gaming with friends, and Holly is painting a doll bed and watching <br/>
Friends.  One of the musicians has a young son who will be here to play with <br/>
Holly.<br/>
