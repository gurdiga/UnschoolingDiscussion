&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Laraine,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a die-hard unschooler,  but that doesn&#39;t mean that my 13 year old <br/>
son never uses curriculum.  Today, in fact he was using a geometry <br/>
textbook.   We make textbooks available just like we make fiction <br/>
available.  Textbooks are a resource at our house and my son uses <br/>
them how and when he wants to.  We recently had a discussion here <br/>
about the University of Missouri correspondence program - maybe <br/>
that&#39;s what you are referring to.  I think that courses like these <br/>
can be another unschooling resource, as long as it follows the <br/>
child&#39;s interests, goals, and desires.  Last year my son returned to <br/>
ps briefly.  We considered that unschooling because it was what he <br/>
wanted to do.  We approached it in a very unschoolish fashion and <br/>
when he had gotten what he needed, we moved on.  <br/>
<br/>
Often, homeschoolers come to unschooling gradually.  First they give <br/>
up the spelling tests,  then the grammar lesson.  It seems like the <br/>
last to go is often the math book.  That&#39;s the way it was with us.<br/>
Also,  some families are &quot;eclectic homeschoolers.&quot;  They may use <br/>
curriculum for certain subjects and unschool others.  For us though,  <br/>
that didn&#39;t work.  Once my kids tasted unschooling,  they wanted it <br/>
all.  I&#39;d probably still be sitting here happily doling out math <br/>
assignments,  but they weren&#39;t going for it.  Now,  it&#39;s such a <br/>
pleasure to watch my son (daughter is in college), tackle math <br/>
because he likes it - geometry no less........<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182217045"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So tell me more about how this happened.  Somehow I can see it coming for<br/>
&gt; us but it scares me to death.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes it still scares me to death,  but I love it anyway :-)  We <br/>
started unschooling our son in 5th grade.  We started with a variety <br/>
of resources, not a specific curriculum,  but a lot of schoolish <br/>
ideas.  Within the first week,  my son would question why we were <br/>
doing this or that.  What was he learning.  I begin to question it <br/>
too.  Plus,  I figured out really quickly that he was forgetting the <br/>
things he wasn&#39;t interested in.  Within a couple of months we were <br/>
doing math,  a little writing,  plenty of free-choice reading, and <br/>
unschooling the rest of the time.  Then I saw that the little bit of <br/>
math I was still &quot;assigning&quot; was becoming very tedious.  We were <br/>
using Saxon and even leaving out a lot,  there was too much <br/>
repetition.  He began to dread math and he had always loved it, and <br/>
really understood it.  All the while,  I had been reading everything <br/>
I could get my hands on about unschooling and sharing it with dh.<br/>
He&#39;s a college professor that sees on a daily basis what&#39;s happening <br/>
to education.  Anyway,  we finally decided to go for it.  We felt <br/>
like if we only stuck our toe in intead of jumping in completely,  we <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to convince our son that he really was in charge of <br/>
his education and that it was his choice from now on.  <br/>
It took a while - quite a bit of deschooling to do,  but he&#39;s such a <br/>
believer now that I can&#39;t imagine going back.  <br/>
<br/>
How do I make sure that they get all they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; need in math with unschooling and be sure they would not be thrown for a<br/>
&gt; loop if, God forbid, a truck hit me head on and they were thrown back into<br/>
&gt; ps?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling involves a lot of trust.  You have to trust that your <br/>
child will learn what he needs to know when he needs to know it.  And <br/>
- if God forbid something happens,  your child has the benefit of the <br/>
time he/she has spent learning on their own - learning how to learn, <br/>
trusting themselves - becoming self-directed, independent learners.<br/>
If they do go back to school,  it&#39;s with a different attitude.  <br/>
They will still take more responsibility for their education instead <br/>
of expecting the school to have all the right answers.  <br/>
<br/>
At the end of 6th grade,  my son decided that he wanted to try 7th <br/>
grade.  He was worried that he might be behind in math so he asked me <br/>
to help him work throught the rest of a math book at that level.  <br/>
Well, you can imagine what happened.  He went back,  and they put him <br/>
in the advanced math class.  He only stayed for one quarter,  but it <br/>
was so different from when he had been in school before.  He jumped <br/>
through the hoops that he had to,  but for the most part,  he took <br/>
what he could use and left the rest.<br/>
<br/>
 Another concern I have is once they learn what they need to know is it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hard for them to put it down on paper or do they know what to do with<br/>
&gt; problems on paper if/when they encounter them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think so.  For instance, one way to become a good writer is <br/>
to read a lot.  Areas overlap and strengths make up for weaknesses.<br/>
Plus,  I think that when you need these skills,  you can practice <br/>
them and become proficient rather quickly.  I would imagine that <br/>
if my son decides to take the ACT or SAT that we will practice because he <br/>
won&#39;t have had a lot of experience with standardized tests.  It will <br/>
be useful to practice,  but it wouldn&#39;t have been worth it to have <br/>
had him take them every year just so that he had the experience.<br/>
He does a lot of math in his head that I have to write down.  It&#39;s <br/>
just different - not good or bad.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My one dd, age 10, had a horrible time in ps with math and now has a bushel<br/>
&gt; of attitudes to show for it.  This makes it hard - I know she is already<br/>
&gt; behind where she would be in ps and I don&#39;t want her to lose any more<br/>
&gt; ground.  Suggestions welcome!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know how you feel.  I felt like this when we first took our <br/>
daughter out of high school.  Be patient.  It&#39;s more important that <br/>
she comes back to math on her own terms.  Then she&#39;ll remember what <br/>
she learns and have a chance to enjoy it.  She has the rest of her <br/>
life to learn math if she wants to.  It doesn&#39;t matter where she <br/>
&quot;should&quot; be right now.  When she&#39;s ready,  she&#39;ll be able to learn it <br/>
so much better and faster than she will now if coerced.  You&#39;ll lose <br/>
more ground in the long run if she continues to develop a dislike for <br/>
math.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to ramble so!  Hope it helps!<br/>

have the freedom to try anything and everything. If something doesn&#39;t fit,<br/>
you throw it out and find something else.  This process brings incredible<br/>
joy and transformations.  Don&#39;t let fear ruin the journey.  :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, how were you going to be sure with a textbook?  What if the textbook<br/>
left something out,or didn&#39;t stress it enough or was just plain wrong about<br/>
something? Those texts were written by humans, so they are magical.<br/>
<br/>
There is a secret here and it&#39;s hard to believe at first.....but you don&#39;t<br/>
have to be sure they will get all they need.   THEY will be sure they get<br/>
what they need, because the NEED it.   This sometimes means that their time<br/>
table will be vasty skewed from the public school time table, which can be<br/>
uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;and be sure they would not be thrown for a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you die, their ability to do math in concert with some public school<br/>
classroom will be the least of their concerns.  Living in fear isn&#39;t a great<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hard for them to put it down on paper or do they know what to do with<br/>
&gt; problems on paper if/when they encounter them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not following you here.  Our kids use real life, need to solve real life<br/>
problems, writing them down to sort them out is one option.  Thankfully it&#39;s<br/>
not the only option.  I create many word problems......but I rarely write<br/>
them out. I TALK them out.  There are members of this list snorting about<br/>
now, as they have tried to sort out my written problems.  It&#39;s better to<br/>
call me on the phone. :)<br/>
<br/>
Now what do I do when I encounter a written problem, or something to sort<br/>
out?  I go read it out loud to myself or I have my dh read it.  I  talk<br/>
through my answer and THEN I write it out.  Sort of.<br/>
<br/>
School Math ruins Real Math.  There are mathie types on the list that will<br/>
do justice to what math really is.  Just rest assured that out unschooled<br/>
kids *get* and *do* math just fine.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First put away all those Shoulds. They are a false set of ideas.  Should all<br/>
3 month olds be able to sit up? 6 month olds?  When should all babies be<br/>
walking?  If we know enough not to put our babies on a timetable, why do we<br/>
think all 9 year olds ought to understand multiplication or all 13 year olds<br/>
should be introduced to algebra??  Each child has his or her own time<br/>
table. Cognitive growth comes in spurts just like physical growth.  We<br/>
should wait for it and enjoy it when it happens.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 5 year old that just sounded out her first word a couple of days<br/>
ago. She&#39;s spending tons of time trying to read everything that comes her<br/>
way.  Her 7.5 year old brother hasn&#39;t discovered the existance of the<br/>
alphabet yet.  Wait.. he knows on and off and ok and a few other words that<br/>
appear on his video games. Otherwise that son exists in a word of things.<br/>
Things to do, things to take apart, things to break, things to talk about.<br/>
No words and no reading allowed, at least not yet.<br/>
<br/>
Losing ground can&#39;t be done.  Think of learning as a huge amusement park.<br/>
Lots of rides, shows and sights to see. It matters not what you do first or<br/>
how many times you choose to do the same thing. It only matters that you<br/>
take care of yourself while there and that you explore until your heart is<br/>
content.  Some of us will hone in and only ride the very fast, daredevil<br/>
rollercoasters. Some will only see the shows.  We all will have a great time<br/>
and feel we got out money&#39;s worth.  Not everyone has to ride the<br/>
rollercoaster and not everyone has to be a math whiz.  And not everyone has<br/>
to do math first thing, they can ride the rollercoaster first, then<br/>
somewhere around 13-14 they can work on math. :)<br/>
<br/>
Did ya ever go anywhere with someone who wanted to see ALL the sights and<br/>
ride ALL the rides??  Did ya notice they spent so much time trying to cram<br/>
everything in they forgot to have fun?  Don&#39;t do that to your homeschooling<br/>
adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have to go back to writing the stuff I was writing, cause I need to.<br/>
But this was a whole lot more fun. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; problems on paper if/when they encounter them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not following you here.  Our kids use real life, need to solve real<br/>
life<br/>
&gt; problems, writing them down to sort them out is one option.  Thankfully<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not the only option.  I create many word problems......but I rarely write<br/>
&gt; them out. I TALK them out.  There are members of this list snorting about<br/>
&gt; now, as they have tried to sort out my written problems.  It&#39;s better to<br/>
&gt; call me on the phone. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now what do I do when I encounter a written problem, or something to sort<br/>
&gt; out?  I go read it out loud to myself or I have my dh read it.  I  talk<br/>
&gt; through my answer and THEN I write it out.  Sort of.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; School Math ruins Real Math.  There are mathie types on the list that will<br/>
&gt; do justice to what math really is.  Just rest assured that out unschooled<br/>
&gt; kids *get* and *do* math just fine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; My one dd, age 10, had a horrible time in ps with math and now has a<br/>
&gt; bushel<br/>
&gt; &gt; of attitudes to show for it.  This makes it hard - I know she is already<br/>
&gt; &gt; behind where she would be in ps and I don&#39;t want her to lose any more<br/>
&gt; &gt; ground.  Suggestions welcome!&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First put away all those Shoulds. They are a false set of ideas.  Should<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; 3 month olds be able to sit up? 6 month olds?  When should all babies be<br/>
&gt; walking?  If we know enough not to put our babies on a timetable, why do<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; think all 9 year olds ought to understand multiplication or all 13 year<br/>
olds<br/>
&gt; should be introduced to algebra??  Each child has his or her own time<br/>
&gt; table. Cognitive growth comes in spurts just like physical growth.  We<br/>
&gt; should wait for it and enjoy it when it happens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a 5 year old that just sounded out her first word a couple of days<br/>
&gt; ago. She&#39;s spending tons of time trying to read everything that comes her<br/>
&gt; way.  Her 7.5 year old brother hasn&#39;t discovered the existance of the<br/>
&gt; alphabet yet.  Wait.. he knows on and off and ok and a few other words<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; appear on his video games. Otherwise that son exists in a word of things.<br/>
&gt; Things to do, things to take apart, things to break, things to talk about.<br/>
&gt; No words and no reading allowed, at least not yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Losing ground can&#39;t be done.  Think of learning as a huge amusement park.<br/>
&gt; Lots of rides, shows and sights to see. It matters not what you do first<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; how many times you choose to do the same thing. It only matters that you<br/>
&gt; take care of yourself while there and that you explore until your heart is<br/>
&gt; content.  Some of us will hone in and only ride the very fast, daredevil<br/>
&gt; rollercoasters. Some will only see the shows.  We all will have a great<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; and feel we got out money&#39;s worth.  Not everyone has to ride the<br/>
&gt; rollercoaster and not everyone has to be a math whiz.  And not everyone<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; to do math first thing, they can ride the rollercoaster first, then<br/>
&gt; somewhere around 13-14 they can work on math. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Did ya ever go anywhere with someone who wanted to see ALL the sights and<br/>
&gt; ride ALL the rides??  Did ya notice they spent so much time trying to cram<br/>
&gt; everything in they forgot to have fun?  Don&#39;t do that to your<br/>
homeschooling<br/>
&gt; adventure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I have to go back to writing the stuff I was writing, cause I need to.<br/>
&gt; But this was a whole lot more fun. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844062684">Here-here. I am one of the types that do some unschooling and some<br/>
curriculum. And that is why I home learn...because I love the freedom of<br/>
choice in whatever shape and configuration my family chooses. Things change<br/>
year to year and I find that I loosen up more all the time but I do believe<br/>
that there is a process to the parent/teacher letting go of our old<br/>
perceptions of how we all learn...and that (like our children &lt;g&gt;) we need<br/>
to go through this process at our  own special pace.<br/>
<br/>
My three cents...or more .  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, how were you going to be sure with a textbook?  What if the<br/>

- for a high school life sciences course.  The introduction, trying to<br/>
get preachy about the process of science, talked about &quot;man&#39;s&quot; (hmm.)<br/>
first adventures to explore our nearest planet Mars!  From her room we<br/>
heard a maddened &quot;That&#39;s not right!!!&quot;  Anyhow, the first assignment we<br/>
agreed upon was that she write letters to the publisher, editor, and<br/>
University of Missouri instructor pointing out the error.<br/>
<br/>
Great lesson, too!  Now she NEVER takes anything for granted.<br/>

&gt;Hi Laraine!<br/>
&gt;&gt; So tell me more about how this happened.  Somehow I can see it coming for<br/>
&gt;&gt; us but it scares me to death.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t be scared!  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, now I see where my kids get their melodrama from.  :o)  When I say<br/>
scares me to death what I really meant was - I can&#39;t see where it is going<br/>
and what I will use to continue.  If find that more unsettling than I&#39;m<br/>
ready to deal with I suppose.  I can&#39;t see the next step if I toss the text<br/>
book. Is that any more clear?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&lt;&lt;How do I make sure that they get all they<br/>
&gt;&gt; need in math with unschooling &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, how were you going to be sure with a textbook? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As magical as they &#39;are&#39; &lt;VBG&gt; I&#39;ve met the wrong answers.  They don&#39;t<br/>
bother me.  I just explain that the books are done by people and we all<br/>
make mistakes.  BUT, the textbook supplies me with the outline of what,<br/>
i.e., 2 digit multiplication, division, fractions, decimals, geometry (they<br/>
could leave that one out as far as I&#39;m concerned :o)  and the steps that<br/>
get the kids to the understanding of how to do these things.  I don&#39;t see<br/>
how they learn long division unschooling.  Hope that helps.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  This sometimes means that their time<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;table will be vasty skewed from the public school time table, which can be<br/>
&gt;uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find that very uncomfortable.  My own mother died young thus I think of<br/>
these things.  And in my first year attempt (just starting year 2) of hsing<br/>
I had to consider what approach I would take in each subject to keep the<br/>
kids at a point where no subject would be an albatross during a time where<br/>
they already had enough to deal with, specifically the loss of any parent.<br/>
That loss is enough in and of itself.  To be burdened with an extra problem<br/>
of not being where they need to be in a subject, whether it be English<br/>
Grammar, Spelling or Math is something I don&#39;t want to put my kids through.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;If you die, their ability to do math in concert with some public school<br/>
&gt;classroom will be the least of their concerns.  Living in fear isn&#39;t a great<br/>
&gt;way to live.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t really live in fear of this I&#39;m just aware that none of us have any<br/>
promise of tomorrow or even later today.  I look at it more as a reason<br/>
behind my choices.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not following you here.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, let me try again.  Does unschooling teach a child to recognize the<br/>
mathematic symbols used in textbooks?  From the unschoolers I&#39;ve known math<br/>
is mostly mental math - which is great - yet I don&#39;t see where they<br/>
experience the math sentence and different layouts of mathematic problems<br/>
on paper.  I would think this could potentially cause a problem at some<br/>
point would it not?  <br/>
<br/>
I once worked with a guy (ps high school grad) that couldn&#39;t count to 5 let<br/>
alone write a sensible math statement.  Talk about scary!  This kid (18 or<br/>
19) couldn&#39;t even count items from one box to another - he must have never<br/>
used manipulatives.  LOL  It was scary to me to think that any 18-19 yo<br/>
could be so unknowledgeable in basic math.  This it is possible for a child<br/>
to end up in such a state.  Obviously this is an extreme in life, not one<br/>
that many will experience but I want to be sure my children can read and<br/>
write math problems in such a way as to be employable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;School Math ruins Real Math.  There are mathie types on the list that will<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346629057"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; So you are saying that ages 13-14 is where math should begin?  Thus<br/>
&gt;&gt; entering into the algebras, trigs, geometry, etc.?  Then where is the<br/>
&gt;&gt; child&#39;s base?  Math like any other subject must have a foundation.  When<br/>
&gt;&gt; did they learn multiplication (note I didn&#39;t say memorize the entire<br/>
&gt;&gt; multiplication table) and division, fractions, decimals, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i think the foundation is the life they live before that. isaac was adding<br/>
at 2 cus he loved to play with numbers. i will say that unschool math.<br/>
actaully we do use books too but i dont &quot;teach&quot; a subject or i use the term<br/>
try to help him learn it til he brings it up and most of it comes up in<br/>
every day life.<br/>
<br/>
how many plates do we need to set the table<br/>
we have tons of math games exp muggins with has really worked on multi and<br/>
division. ( no he does not the table by heart but he knows how to figure it<br/>
out. )<br/>
<br/>
we havent even considered doing long division.<br/>
<br/>
but we recently did fractions, he said he didnt know enough about them/<br/>
<br/>
then last week he needed to figure out tax so now we are working on percent<br/>
which of course will bring up decimals.<br/>
<br/>
BTW , by him self he is trying to put in letters for numbers which is basic<br/>
algebra.<br/>
<br/>
i am much more concerned about writing, he hates to write adn it is ahrd to<br/>
read. but i dont wnt to push him. i just freak out about it every month or<br/>
so. which is my prob not his!<br/>
