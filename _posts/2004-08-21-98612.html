If you get the HBO stable of channels, keep a look out for a documentary<br/>
titled &quot;Jackie Chan: My Stunts&quot; in which he talks about, well, his stunts.<br/>
I think I may have seen that, one of those months we had free so&so channel. <br/>
He explained how thay set up and practice all the stunts in his gym. One thing <br/>
I remember is the amount of fun and laughter between the crew.<br/>
I think Jackie Chan needs to be on my &quot;Who would you invite to dinner&quot; list.<br/>
&quot;Excuse me Mr. Chan, would you please pass the peas?&quot;<br/>
