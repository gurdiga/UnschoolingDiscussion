 who can&#39;t believe you actually read that whole thing.<br/>
 curiousity killed the cat you know. :)<br/>

   I read it too, I can go off on a tangent in my brain that I cannot stop <br/>
and it really gets to me. I have to get out of bed then and get on here to <br/>
stop the crazies (my term for my thoughts). Now that we&#39;ll have TV again next <br/>
week I can turn on some goofy show. It has always helped me.<br/>

Probably because you laugh.  And you calm down.  And those two things (like <br/>
the deep breathing, like the recommendation of Yoga) will slow down that <br/>
adrenalated anxiety.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753266076">yay for shows! or a movie I&#39;ve already seen twelve<br/>
million times...I frequently fall asleep during them.<br/>
:) OR ms.pacman on the computer...a nice tedious thing<br/>
to do over and over again while thinking and then be<br/>
tired enough to fall asleep, and when you turn off the<br/>
game, you just fall straight to the bedroom. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, everything that has ever helped me with stress is something that<br/>
alters breathing: breathing techniques, exercise and laughing.  But I want<br/>
to add singing to the list.  It works for me.  (And it&#39;s cheap, clean and<br/>
available, as they say.)<br/>
