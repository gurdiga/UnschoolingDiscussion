<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001306889">this morning we decided to take advantage of a nice COOL weather and <br/>
get lost @ the zoo ... however, we FORGOT that the schools take their <br/>
spring field trips, tooooooooooooo ... ugh, we&#39;ve gotten so spoiled <br/>
w/ having places like this to OURSELVES!!!  after a couple of hrs of <br/>
listening to the SCREAMING/HOLLERING teachers, my youngest ds (10) <br/>
asked *WHY* did the kids get YELLED @ JUST FOR ASKING ???&#39;s  *AND*, <br/>
WHY didn&#39;t the teachers *answer* their ???&#39;s&quot;  dh laughed and <br/>
said &quot;it&#39;s PROBABLY b/c the teachers DON&#39;T KNOW THE ANSWERS!!!&quot; (lol, <br/>
my thoughts EXACTLY!!!)  ds also noticed the children were told to <br/>
MOVE ALONG through the lines when they were TRYING to watch the <br/>
animals, etc while we took all the time in the world to *observe* ... <br/>
he also said &quot;WHY can&#39;t they just walk *NORMAL* and not like SOLDIERS <br/>
w/ their hands on the person&#39;s shoulder in front of them???&quot; (looked <br/>
like a bunch of cattle going to slaughter to me) ... the boys also <br/>
noticed each group had an official *ed list of ???&#39;s* to answer and <br/>
they thought this&#39;d be a AWFUL to keep up w/ while @ the zoo and WHY <br/>
don&#39;t they just let the kids ENJOY the animals???  *good points*, I <br/>
thought ... I explained that is called &quot;BUSY WORK&quot; and OBVIOUSLY had <br/>
to justify their school day; poor p-s&#39;rs ... afterwards we had a <br/>
picnic @ the park and the boys started talking about the <br/>
teachers/kids again ...  I think both of our fellas realize they have <br/>
it PRETTY GOOD @ *HOME*, b/c even on the WORST of dayz, mom&#39;z *NOT* <br/>
quite *THAT* BAD!!!  lol!!!   nope, no <br/>
SCREAMING/YELLING/FILLING~IN~THE~BLANKS @ OUR HOUSE!!! :P<br/>
<br/>
I know it prob sounds as if my youngens have never seen p-s&#39;rs before <br/>
but for some reason, today they just seemed to *GET IT* and ohhhhhhh, <br/>
we&#39;re SO GRATEFUL they don&#39;t have to deal w/ any of this <br/>
foolishness on a daily basis; talk about *STRESS*!!!  (my brain is so <br/>
fried, does this make any sense???)  <br/>
<br/>
... *also*, just for laughs ... *apparently* I made an old goose MAD <br/>
while we were feeding the ducks @ the pond ... I couldn&#39;t believe it, <br/>
I was *ATTACKED* by an ole goose while my fm stood by LAUGHING @ ME <br/>
(GRRRRR)!!!  goodness, I&#39;m NOT SURE *WHAT* I did to OFFEND the ole <br/>
gal (she prob knew I was female, too???) but I was DEFINITELY on her <br/>
LIST, that&#39;s for sure ... she let dh and the boys pet her/feed her <br/>
but whenever I *tried*, she&#39;s start CHASING, HISSING, NIPPING @ MY <br/>
HEELS!!!  mannnnnnn, my fellas really got a kick outta this <br/>
(whattaSADISTICfm)!!!  :I   sooooooooo, except for the LOUD p-s&#39;rs/ <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004571251">Oh boy, when I read this I had to respond!  We went to the county museum a few weeks ago!  I guess it was ps day!  I heard the lady at the front desk grumbling about how they acted the last time before they came in and I thought, &quot;Boy, how can you think that way about kids!&quot;  Well, later I figured out why she was grumbling!  (Of course I don&#39;t blame the kids) The kids were tearing around the museum, crawling under and over the exhibits, screaming!  I could see the precariously balanced stuffed animals shake and shimmy with the thundering children!  And the parents that volunteered to come along on this field trip had no control over the kids at all!  They were screaming at the kids to no avail!  How can anyone learn anything in that chaos?  My kids just shook their heads and asked if we could go to a quieter part of the museum!<br/>
<br/>
Another time we went to a play put on by a local children&#39;s theatre.  Half of the audience was full of homeschooled kids and the other half was full of ps kids.  Boy, you could sure tell the difference!  One half of the audience could absolutely not stay still in their seats, could not keep their voices down, was throwing objects!  The other half was well-mannered quiet and attentive to the play.  I&#39;ll bet you can guess which is which!<br/>

Reminds me of me and dh looking for the cottage t spend <br/>
our honeymoon in, decided it needed to be just-right so <br/>
we went and toured round the area for a day, saw 23 <br/>
cottages!  Anyway, at one of these, lovely place but <br/>
too far from anywhere else (and I mean anywhere, like <br/>
three houses and a lake and 600 sheep...) for us, there <br/>
was this flock of geese.  guarding the place.  They ALL <br/>
turned on me and were herding me away, dh had to look <br/>
through the windows by himself and I didn&#39;t get to see <br/>
anything!<br/>
<br/>
The place we did get was in a tiny village miles from <br/>
anywehre, except that the village had a farmhouse-<br/>
restaurant :-)  Oh and there were even more sheep it <br/>
was lambing season...<br/>

23rd. Woo hoo! Say it with me, don&#39;t be shy. <br/>
Yes, it&#39;s soon, but we&#39;re kind of spontaneous like<br/>
that. We want  a June wedding and don&#39;t want to wait<br/>
til next year. <br/>
Anyway, Honeymoons. Trying to decide what to do for<br/>
one. I have the two kids that my fam will watch, but<br/>
who knows how long I can go without them!<br/>
Seperation anxiety. :)<br/>
Any ideas for a nice semi-short honeymoon?<br/>
Also, any ideas for any eccentric or cheapy touches to<br/>
the wedding will be appreciated. It will be the<br/>
farthest from &quot;traditional&quot; weddings. <br/>
With this diverse group, I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll hear some<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961057054">Where are you located? Budget problems? WE had a wedding on a shoestring. Outside by the river at my granddads house. It was beautiful. When I saw Forrest Gump, I was surprised to see almost my own wedding. We had lots of fresh flowers twined around an arch with tissuepaper streamers too. We each personalized our vows and shared what we loved about each other. I asked guests to share what they thought the most important thing to make a marriage last was. Makes a great scrapbook. We only got one night alone at a friends house (with cozy fireplace) for our honeymoon and just enjoyed being together alone. Do you like nature, maybe you could find a cabin in the woods thing? Or maybe a few days in the big city if thats more your style.<br/>

invitations or any of that, just made calls and passed<br/>
it on, word of mouth. We asked for them to bring a<br/>
dish. A potluck wedding. :) It was a beautiful day and<br/>
everyone was happy to be outside. For music at the<br/>
beginning of the ceremony, we had two talented<br/>

All I Ask of You from Phantom of the Opera. Nothing<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916157392">And yes you can all be bridesmaids...<br/>
you just have to agree to wear whatever I tell you and<br/>
lots of glitter.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, we were talking the other day about how cool<br/>
it would be to have a web cam there. Then all of our<br/>
out of town relatives and friends could &quot;be there&quot;<br/>
with us and he would put it up at his site (s)<br/>
(http://rocktoons.com  http://celebritoons.com....had<br/>
to do it, folks), and so in that case, if that<br/>
happens, you all really are invited to &quot;attend&quot;. <br/>
:)<br/>
Just to share...I&#39;m not having a &quot;maid of honor&quot;.<br/>
I think that&#39;s just an unfair tradition. For me,<br/>
anyway. I have two VERY close friends....one more than<br/>
a friend really, we call each other split-aparts...<br/>
but she wasn&#39;t really around when I started dating Ty,<br/>
and my other really close friend was, and said &quot;when<br/>
you get married, I better be your maid of honor, cuz<br/>
I&#39;m helping you out.(wink wink nudge nudge)&quot;<br/>
and then there&#39;s my &quot;little&quot; sister, who I am so close<br/>
to, and I was her maid of honor. <br/>
So I decided, who says we both have to choose ONE<br/>
person that is more special to us in relation to our<br/>
relationship with each other?? WE don&#39;t. <br/>
So I&#39;m just calling them &quot;maids&quot; and &quot;men&quot; and one of<br/>
his &quot;men&quot; is a girl, and she will walk with my &quot;maid&quot;<br/>
who wanted to either give me away, or walk by herself.<br/>

***They&#39;re all different, I guess. I&#39;ve stayed in three I think. You&#39;re<br/>
right, you&#39;re sharing a house with other people, but you have your own room<br/>
and usually your own bath. They&#39;re rather romantic. We stayed in a nice old<br/>
victorian b&b on the coast and we all waited for the honeymooners to come<br/>
downstairs so we could start breakfast together....they had left before<br/>
anyone was up! The food is a huge reason to stay in one, but maybe they<br/>
wanted their privacy, also. If you could find a b&b guide book for your area<br/>
it would tell you about the various aspects...cost, size, pets allowed?,<br/>
atmosphere, food...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-3406979">Woo hoo! Now that is a lovely unique story!<br/>
I especially like the vows to your daughter part. <br/>
Mind if I steal it? Although then there will be a<br/>
definite crying factor involved. <br/>
Make up everywhere will run. <br/>
Noses will swell and speeches will be made. But<br/>
definitely some variation on it. Definitely. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I would like everyone&#39;s input on this one,<br/>
too.<br/>
His cousin might do the actually marrying part...the<br/>
official part...being a notary and all, but instead of<br/>
having her, or one specific person give a speech of<br/>
some sort, we were thinking of having each person in<br/>
our wedding party come up and say a few words about<br/>
marriage or love. Just short ones, and not about US,<br/>
but about love or marriage in general. Then his cousin<br/>
come up and do the official part. <br/>
Any ideas along those lines?<br/>
And any ideas about incorporating the kids vows part<br/>
in there somehow?<br/>
thankyou thankyou thankyou guyz for sharing. <br/>
:)<br/>
I&#39;m lovin it.<br/>

Everyone said something a little different. . . it was kind of neat because <br/>
the two sides (families and friends) knew very little about Bryan or I, so <br/>
hearing stories or tidbits by our friends was a way to learn things they may <br/>

all the other ideas about the reception you are getting. . . doing off the <br/>
wall things. My best advice is trust your instincts and do what feels best <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051645959">I missed my cousin&#39;s wedding because my baby was due any day (95) but he gave a little gold ring to his step daughter and the three of them held hands while he said his vows to his new daughter.  I thought I&#39;d cry and I wasn&#39;t even there.  ambersand<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Woo hoo! Now that is a lovely unique story!<br/>
I especially like the vows to your daughter part. <br/>
Mind if I steal it? Although then there will be a<br/>
definite crying factor involved. <br/>
Make up everywhere will run. <br/>
Noses will swell and speeches will be made. But<br/>
definitely some variation on it. Definitely. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I would like everyone&#39;s input on this one,<br/>
too.<br/>
His cousin might do the actually marrying part...the<br/>
official part...being a notary and all, but instead of<br/>
having her, or one specific person give a speech of<br/>
some sort, we were thinking of having each person in<br/>
our wedding party come up and say a few words about<br/>
marriage or love. Just short ones, and not about US,<br/>
but about love or marriage in general. Then his cousin<br/>
come up and do the official part. <br/>
Any ideas along those lines?<br/>
And any ideas about incorporating the kids vows part<br/>
in there somehow?<br/>
thankyou thankyou thankyou guyz for sharing. <br/>
:)<br/>
I&#39;m lovin it.<br/>

&gt; couple of years ago on a <br/>
&gt; baseball field in the middle of January in<br/>
&gt; Louisiana, notorious for lots of <br/>
&gt; rain in the winter.   Each &quot;side&quot; had 9<br/>
&gt; player/attendants. My daughter sang <br/>
&gt; the National Anthem to start us out, which was<br/>
&gt; followed by 9 innings, each of <br/>
&gt; which was a poem or song, followed by the vows which<br/>
&gt; we each had written our <br/>
&gt; own. Then my husband turned to my 9 year daughter<br/>
&gt; old with rhyming vows he <br/>
&gt; had written for her and a ring as well. Not a dry<br/>
&gt; eye in the stadium!! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In case anyone is wondering why a baseball field, my<br/>
&gt; husband worked in minor <br/>
&gt; league baseball and is a fanatic and it had always<br/>
&gt; been his dream to get <br/>
&gt; married at home plate. . . I thought why not  make<br/>
&gt; his dream come true. . . <br/>
&gt; my preference would have been a garden, but this was<br/>
&gt; a lifelong dream of his. <br/>
&gt; . . people were very very skeptical about it. . .<br/>
&gt; all my attendants thought I <br/>
&gt; was nuts, but after it was over, everyone told me it<br/>
&gt; was the most unique and <br/>
&gt; best wedding they had ever attended.  I have to say<br/>
&gt; it was the best one I <br/>
&gt; attended as well. ;)<br/>
