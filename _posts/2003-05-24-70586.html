 </span></blockquote>My first was my hardest!  I was 22yo and into attachment parenting <br/>
and La Leche League, and family and friends blamed his personality <br/>
and &quot;behavior&quot; on that.  In other words I was &quot;too nice&quot; and let <br/>
him &quot;control me.&quot; <br/>
I also had a friend with 2 girls, and when we&#39;d get together, even <br/>
at a playground, they&#39;d sit on a blanket and play with dolls while <br/>
my son ran around like a wild man. :-)  I can still remember how <br/>
shitty and frustrated I felt when she said things like &quot;my kids <br/>
would *never* do that.&quot;  I&#39;ve since lost touch with her but know <br/>
that she later had a son and I wonder if she ever had to eat her <br/>
words.<br/>
My youngest son is my calmest and easiest.  <br/>
Whenever I see a mother with a busy or active or &quot;difficult&quot; toddler <br/>
I go out of my way to say something nice and affirming to her since <br/>
I remember how difficult it was and how judged I always felt.<br/>

long as they&#39;d like. But this way they can have privacy too. We figure <br/>
Cameron,15, will never move out. Duncan, now seven, will be gone in a year or two! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
