<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776857132">I&#39;ve been gone for almost two days, and need to leave today for several more <br/>
hours (to help bring the camp back home, which will take three pickup loads, <br/>
my van at least once, and two other cars--medieval villages aren&#39;t <br/>
backpacking situations!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read through this thread and might comment more later, but here are a <br/>
few things which struck me as vital to share, and they&#39;re things I have <br/>
always shared with my kids, too.  It was a good kid-weekend, and I got lots <br/>
of positive feedback on my kids.  Kirby got an award of arms (and is now Lord <br/>
Magnus Gunwaldtsson instead of just plain &quot;Magnus&quot;), and Marty was made a <br/>
member of the Order of The Desert Fawn, which is only for kids whose work an <br/>
potential are inspiring even to the adults.  Good feedback.<br/>
<br/>
So my sharings (which I have shared with my kids) are these:<br/>
<br/>
The way to be truthful is not to speak unless you&#39;ve carefully checked your <br/>
facts and thought about what you&#39;re going to say.  Thinking before talking is <br/>
something we&#39;ve encouraged always in our kids, and they got it as kids, not <br/>
having to figure it out later as adults.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re wrong, don&#39;t dodge.  If you make an error of fact, accept the <br/>
correction, admit you were wrong, and go on!  Digging in and defending <br/>
something which isn&#39;t true leads to no good, and you lose integrity points <br/>
and people lose faith in you.  <br/>
<br/>
In the SCA (which has been a big part of our lives, and was the overwhelming <br/>
part of life this weekend) there are people who are trusted and dependable, <br/>
and they created and maintain that reputation by attention each moment to <br/>
what they&#39;re doing and saying.  There are people my kids have known all their <br/>
lives, whom I&#39;ve known twenty-five years, who have not in all that time lost <br/>
the positive regard of other people.   It&#39;s a goal in their lives, and they <br/>
just do it.<br/>
<br/>
There are other people my kids also know who are NOT reliable, NOT considered <br/>
good sources of information or assistance, and that&#39;s just how it is.  They <br/>
look at both kinds of people and their choices in life are easier to make.  <br/>
There are people who used to be unreliable and less than truthful and less <br/>
than honest who have turned their lives around consciously and become <br/>
respected, high-ranking participants.  One was in our camp, one of my <br/>
students (now a knight).  This isn&#39;t lost on my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s godfather, Sir Raymond the Quiet, who was knighted in 1971 or (before <br/>
I joined), had a heart attack on Saturday and was taken to the hospital.  <br/>
Angioplasty, probably home today.   For those reading who are <br/>
SCA-knowledgeable, Raymond was the founding baron here, and is a triple peer. <br/>
 If he says something is so, it is so.   Not because he&#39;s a peer, but the <br/>
other way around.  If he doesn&#39;t know he finds no shame in saying &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
know, but I&#39;ll try to find out.&quot;  He makes (mostly cast bronze and silver) <br/>
jewelry reproductions.  I watched his booth for a bit Saturday afternoon, and <br/>
Most pieces were displayed on top of a color print of a painting or <br/>
archeological photograph.  Those which were based but not copied exactly from <br/>
history were displayed on a photo of the original piece.  It was clear by the <br/>
backgrounds which were which.  In no way whatsoever was the sales place of <br/>
these 150 or so different items misleading or &quot;wrong.&quot;  Each piece was <br/>
described straightforwardly and plainly.<br/>
<br/>
Ray&#39;s been a friend of mine for a long time.  Many people&#39;s lifetimes.  He <br/>
just won&#39;t say things he doesn&#39;t know to be so, or know could prove useful to <br/>
the listeners.  There are many such people in my life, and in my kids&#39; lives. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He said he had been working on his website lately.  I haven&#39;t looked since I <br/>
spoke with him about that Saturday, before the heart attack, but here is the <br/>

The other preliminary comment I have about the thread is about whether I&#39;m <br/>
flattered when people discuss me and argue over my comments.  I am not <br/>
flattered.  It&#39;s irritating like being stalked.  But how can it be prevented? <br/>
 I could go away, I could be less honest, I could water down my advice.  But <br/>
I couldn&#39;t do that and maintain my integrity.<br/>
<br/>
Those who focus on me instead of on unschooling are showing something about <br/>
themselves, their own growth and confidence and sureness about the world.  If <br/>
I&#39;m trying to keep things clearly focussed and others (not many, a couple <br/>
from time to time) are expending energy to say &quot;Clarity isn&#39;t all that,&quot; or <br/>
&quot;My clarity is as clear as yours is&quot; that&#39;s kind of an embarrassing moment.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need to (nor can we) take turns &quot;being right.&quot;  This began because I <br/>
stated what I saw clearly, and stated it simply.  Having been proven right, I <br/>
didn&#39;t come in and do a happy dance.  It was a simple fact.  Had looking at <br/>
the first post proven wrong, I would have said &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry.  You&#39;re right. <br/>
 Sorry for the confusion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I looked carefully at the first post before I ever wrote anything in the <br/>
first place, and that&#39;s why I was right.  Because I&#39;ve learned over the years <br/>
the value of being careful about what I say and write and do.   <br/>
<br/>
My husband is a respected man in the SCA.  He&#39;s always right.  People respect <br/>
his word in meetings, about site maps, about schedules and policies.  If it <br/>
ever turns out he&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s usually because a policy was changed after he <br/>
learned it.  And he admits being wrong with sweet honesty.  And then other <br/>
say, &quot;No, you would have been right if they hadn&#39;t changed the schedule this <br/>
morning.&quot;  If he dug in his heels and insulted those who disputed him and <br/>
claimed to be right just because he was him, the respect would start to <br/>
erode, but he doesn&#39;t.  He knows the harm that comes to reputations from <br/>
defending an indefensible position, and I have never seen him do that.   <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s &quot;always right&quot; not because I say he is, but because those who have tried <br/>
to trip him up by finding error have failed to do that.  He&#39;s not right for <br/>
meanness nor out of arrogance or anything bad or evil.  He&#39;s just right <br/>
because he&#39;s careful.  He&#39;s truthful because he values truth.<br/>
<br/>
This would be off topic if it weren&#39;t the very topic itself, and if it <br/>
weren&#39;t something that my three unschooled kids have learned from example and <br/>
osmosis and reminder and discussion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And - it is related to that Zen-ish quality of being fully present in the <br/>
moment, too, which is ultimately what unschooling is about, imo.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I can articulate why these things seem related, to me. By <br/>
even bringing it up I&#39;m perching on the very edge of my own personal grasp of <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
But - what I&#39;ve learned from some people is that the kind of &quot;taking care&quot; <br/>
that Sandra just posted about in terms of careful reading of people&#39;s emails <br/>
before responding or careful attention to detail or careful attention to <br/>
integrity - is a way of being that transcends everything or maybe it is more <br/>
accurate to say it permeates everything and gives everything we do a deeper <br/>
meaning. It is maybe comparable to how an artist sees with an artist&#39;s eyes - <br/>
so that everything is made up of shapes and lines and space and color and <br/>
pattern - and the most mundane items become unordinary - beautiful or <br/>
meaningful. <br/>
<br/>
That kind of &quot;taking care&quot; is a way of &quot;seeing&quot; everything as &quot;sacred&quot; - in <br/>
the sense that everything matters, even the most mundane and the most <br/>
seemingly trivial things.<br/>
<br/>
For me, unschooling is largely about that kind of &quot;taking care&quot; -- especially <br/>
taking care of my children&#39;s inner core of natural love of life - which <br/>
includes their intrinsic urge to learn. To do that, it means applying that <br/>
&quot;taking care&quot; to the mundane things in everyday life - making as many of them <br/>
as possible into sacred and wonderful moments where we are fully and <br/>
immediately present with each other.<br/>
