<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651309029">Hello all.  My daughter is 10 and wants to find other kids to chat <br/>
with on-line.  Anybody know of a chat room where unschoolers <br/>
congregate?  I have never used the chat room thing myself, so I <br/>
guess I might need to try it, too.  Deirdre</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252511518">About a year ago I set up a chat for kids.  It was tricky because of time zones and some kids prefer to chat during the day while others prefer evenings or even late night.  I think the kids who participated had fun though.<br/>

The message boards at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/board-topics.html">http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/board-topics.html</a> have a kids folder.  Scroll down to Unschoolers in Action.<br/>
<br/>
yahoogroups has a chat feature too.  I used it once with my local HS group.<br/>
