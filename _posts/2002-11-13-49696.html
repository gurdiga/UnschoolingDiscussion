<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654748160">Find Dr. Phil horribly obnoxious when it comes to the care of children?  How does anyone recommend severing a child from a pet as a form of financial responsibilty?  If you didn&#39;t watch the show, then suffice it to say a couple has over-extended themselves horribly, and had approximately 6 pets, one of which was a lizard, the rest cats and dogs.  While I feel they should not have bought them in the first place, to give them up seems to me brutal for both the children and the pets.  I would seek to cut back in other ways,  and just not purchase pets anymore....  at least until I was more financially solvent.<br/>
<br/>
I was also extremely annoyed by his constant use of the words *sacred cow* which, after awhile, seemed to be to actually be an ethnic slur. (against those from India who do not eat cows)<br/>

be well,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092515557">I agree with Rachel Ann and Mary B. His child rearing strategies are<br/>
often off, IMO, although he does help adults with their<br/>
relationship/communication issues. He can&#39;t seem to apply the same<br/>
listening strategies to kids! However he does say not to fight with each<br/>
other in front of your children, and helps people not to speak nastily<br/>
and judgmentally to their children - saying shut up or calling them<br/>
names for example. And he is absolutely against spanking. On the other<br/>
hand, he certainly has not read &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot;! He&#39;s all about<br/>
charts and gold stars.<br/>
<br/>
Recently he did a &quot;toilet training in a day&quot; show - totally plagiarized<br/>
from the book of that title, only mentioning that these were not new<br/>
ideas! I turned it off after a few minutes, because he skipped over the<br/>
readiness concept. :/<br/>
<br/>
I have learnt here that children like and will respond to being treated<br/>
with the same respect/courtesy as you would treat another adult. I don&#39;t<br/>
think Dr. Phil has grasped this concept. He is still looking at children<br/>
as needing behavior modification to be controlled, to fit into adult&#39;s<br/>
needs.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I am ambivalent about him.<br/>

He was right on, though, with the Mom telling her daughter she was a fat pig. <br/>
 Except that I saw a bit of his action plan with her, how to get her to <br/>
reduce her weight, and that annoyed me.  I&#39;m just not a chart and gold star <br/>

That&#39;s exactly where I think Dr. Phil faulters. I happened to turn him on <br/>
late today just out of curiousity. The part I saw was where an 11 year old <br/>
girl was dressing as her mom didn&#39;t want her to. When the girl stated it was <br/>
her face and body and clothes, Dr. Phil said it wasn&#39;t her face and body at <br/>
her age. It was her mom&#39;s responsibility. I thought that was just way too <br/>
much. He pretty much told the mom to raise the stakes of punishment when the <br/>
mom had already taken away everything the kid had and grounded her too. <br/>
Maybe prison would work??<br/>

show about child beauty pageants (as in are they a good or bad idea) and <br/>
girls who want to dress too sexy too soon.  IMO, he&#39;s turned a bit Maury <br/>
Povich with this show.  I turned it off before the end because he was telling <br/>
the mother of an 11 year old that she had to take control and not allow the <br/>
daughter to do what she was doing.  Who&#39;s the parent here?  You need to stop <br/>
wanting to be her friend and stop caring if she complains about your <br/>
punishments.   Yada, yada, yada.  Granted, I&#39;m a long way from having to face <br/>
this situation, but I really feel that his approach is not at all respectful <br/>
of the child.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You mean there is hope??!! Yea! Jason (almost 6) is even pickier then I was as <br/>
a kid (which is saying something!). He just stopped eating chix patties and <br/>
tonight he did not eat his pb&j sandwich because the bread was too hard to <br/>
tear (it was brand new perfectly fresh bread, just too chewy or something<br/>
like that). Of course now that we have given up junk food restrictions he<br/>
eats all kind of sweet stuff too...at this point I am happy if he eats a<br/>
junk food snack that has some nutrition...like pudding or ice cream. Anyone<br/>
have any good muffin or home made cookie recipes??<br/>
<br/>
As far as Dr Phil goes, I definitely do NOT like his parenting advice and I <br/>
am not too keen on his new format. I liked him when I caught Oprah every once<br/>
in awhile, but his new show seems to cater to the extremes (a la Jerry <br/>
Springer but for educated women types). I saw a show for helping couples who<br/>
had sex incompatibilities in their relationship...had a husband who wanted sex<br/>
2-3 a day and every time his wife even bent over he was all over her (she of<br/>
course only wanted it  a couple of times a month), they had a guy who did not<br/>
want to have sex at all with his wife because she was a mother (from a previous<br/>
marriage) and he felt she was too good and pure (he had only had sex based shallow<br/>
relationships prior to her). And they had a woman who had been taught by her mother<br/>
that sex was &quot;dirty&quot; and her husband had been sleeping on the couch for 3 years.<br/>
Talk about extremes...not too hard to give advice on <br/>
that...how about a woman who wants it a couple of times a month and a man who<br/>
wants it weekly etc. <br/>
<br/>
Plus it also seems kind of like drive by advice giving... they have 3 people and<br/>
spend maybe 10-15 mins a person. They listen and then Dr Phil gives his advice<br/>
and solves the problem. Viola...mission accomplished. Too pat and dry for me. <br/>
Seems like a lot of his issues are a little more complex then he makes them out<br/>
to be. <br/>
<br/>
my 2 cents!<br/>

<br/>
With nine people in the house, we never manage to get together one meal that everyone likes/wants. I usually do the cooking here, and cook one thing that I know is popular with many - the rest of us get our own quick meal/snack - or I make something  else that is easy for others  - or we do this together.  For eg, we had a fish and vegetable curry  that I made, the other night, I  also made some chips, with the help of the 7 yo , for those who don&#39;t eat curry but will eat home cooked chips and salad! <br/>
:-)... Sometimes they just have a sandwich and fruit, or cereal and mik or beans on toast...Works out in the long run. And much better than forcing  or coaxing anyone to eat what they don&#39;t want...Leonie<br/>

<br/>
I remember a friend complaining that her child would eat nothing but chicken, apples and cherrios...I think with milk, but not sure about the milk.<br/>
<br/>
I told her that was actually a pretty well rounded diet!<br/>
<br/>
I have been known to give my daughter slices of butter, because she doesn&#39;t want the bread and why waste it?   <br/>
<br/>
BTW,  certain foods are . from what I understand, really considered pretty complete, and if your child is eating bananas/bread/potatos you really don&#39;t have too much to worry about.  Good if you can get them to eat something else, and I would try to add condiments,  or make food plainer, etc. etc.  But if they are eating one of the above, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much....especially for a short period of time ( a couple of months.)<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621644591">Well,<br/>
<br/>
Think about it: bread is called the staff of life.  Especially if you are talking about whole grain breads; they get what they need.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the Irish Potato famine; why was it so devestating?  Because that is what they were living on...and I think I learned about bananas from a diet I was on which promoted the idea of eating what you want, when you wanted it, the way you wanted it.  If you were hungry, and couldn&#39;t get the above (lets safe you had this intense craving for a tex-mex omlette with hot sauce, and you were out of hot sauce.) the suggested food was half a banana.  It satisified, and it has a lot of vitamins etc.<br/>
<br/>
I happen to think that maintaining to strict a hand about food, demanding a child eat certain foods at certain times, is what leads to obesity and aneorexia.  (one of the things)<br/>
<br/>
MHO...<br/>
be well,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-438010655">I was once present when an aquaintance,  who will go nameless, was feeding her child dinner.  I can&#39;t remember all that the child was served, but she was in the traditional high chair, bibbed, etc, and had a choice of three foods, one of which was blueberries, a protein of some sort and a veggie.  Child starts reaching for the pile of blueberries and mom pushes her hand away...not till she has more veggies!  I had to ask her why!!!  I mean, first off, why have so many blueberries piled up there if she didn&#39;t want the child to have it, and why fuss about more blueberries?  It had something to do with wanting her not to have too much sweet stuff...<br/>
<br/>
give me a huge break..<br/>
but this particular mom is very controlling...<br/>

yesterday at 12:30 when my children finally started emerging, I was hungry.  <br/>
Knowing Holly&#39;s abilities, I asked for a hot dog.  I wanted the mustard, <br/>
actually, and the dab of protein.  She made a face, and wasn&#39;t feeling well, <br/>
so I asked her to wake Marty up.  He was cranky and said Holly could have <br/>
done that.  We had words, he and I both cried some.  He said &quot;Well then what <br/>
DO you want, mom?  Just tell me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;I want a green-chile omelette, but I don&#39;t want you to have to learn <br/>
to cook to make me one.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all happy again, and I&#39;m eating frosted mini-wheats, counting the days <br/>
until I get my walking cast and can go upstairs and eat.  Seven days.<br/>

settled on obesity in my 30s.  Which is why I&#39;m totally letting the children <br/>
