<div id="ygrps-yiv-275609081">Ren,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you! <br/>
<br/>
Y&#39;all, we had such a good time with Ren and her kids (and stayed up WAAAY too <br/>
late both nights!). And Ren really DOES chase Jalen all over creation! &lt;g&gt; I <br/>
wish you all could experience a weekend like that. Almost 200 unschoolers <br/>
under one roof---So cool! Our little utopia. <br/>
<br/>
Plan on next year! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kelly<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you exactly what Kelly does.<br/>
I lived with her for a weekend, and seen her under a LOT of stress, so I <br/>
think I gathered a fairly good idea of how she operates.<br/>
Yes, she yells at people that get on a list, unaware of it&#39;s feel and start <br/>
advocating things that the majority have worked hard and long to rid their <br/>
lives of.<br/>
But with her children?<br/>
She is kind, gentle, TRULY respectful and all this on a weekend where she had <br/>
<br/>
to have been stressed to the max.<br/>
Her children are interesting individuals that treated me and my children just <br/>
<br/>
like they would treat any other person, as a friend.<br/>
Duncan asked me to get him cereal in the morning, without hesitation, because <br/>
<br/>
adults have always treated him with respect and he does not assume they are <br/>
the enemy.<br/>
When he asked Kelly for something, she responded with love, kindness and <br/>
empathy.</div>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thank you, Joyce.   <br/>
&gt; &gt; I used to get angry when others were sarcastic or belittling, now I <br/>
&gt; just get sad because it means they don&#39;t know (maybe don&#39;t want to <br/>
&gt; know) ME. I&#39;m even more sad when I see those who share some of my <br/>
&gt; beliefs behaving the same way, PEOPLE are more important than an urge <br/>
&gt; to prove one is superior. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Kris<br/>
&gt; I can empathize.  Though currently I feel both anger and sadness :-p <br/>
&gt; when people are sarcastic, I would like to come to the point of <br/>
&gt; feeling only sad, as you describe.  Especially since I&#39;m trying to <br/>
&gt; teach my children this outlook (not to lash back angrily in response <br/>
&gt; to being belittled).<br/>
&gt; Mike<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m guessing that this is directed at me. I&#39;m more than willing to take that <br/>
heat.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is: <br/>
<br/>
This is one of the three places in the world (and for a brief few days, there <br/>
was a fourth, the conference) where the unschooling utopia IS. There actually <br/>
is a lot of tolerance and a lot of generosity and a lot of patience here. I&#39;d <br/>
say more than anywhere else that&#39;s group-related. Our homes are/can be that <br/>
tolerant and generous and patient on a daily basis. <br/>
<br/>
There is not a group anywhere, in my opinion, that is more willing to offer <br/>
help and suggestions and a path to gentle parenting and unschooling. And <br/>
&#39;though a few may disagree, the main posters/lurkers on this list truly <br/>
believe that unschooling is a LIFESTYLE (not yelling, just emphasizing! &lt;g&gt;), <br/>
NOT just an educational choice. Because, here, LIFE is educational. How can a <br/>
child REALLY understand that HIS choices are the right choices if his choices <br/>
are constantly limited? How can HE show respect until he receives respect? <br/>
How can HE decide what to believe if it&#39;s all laid out in black and white <br/>
(and red) in front of him? Unschooling---the lifestyle---is understanding <br/>
that our choices define Who We Really Are. Educationally and Personally. <br/>
<br/>
But when folks come in---brand spanking &lt;g&gt; new to the group---and start <br/>
insisting that a parent&#39;s right outweighs that of a child, that choices <br/>
should be limited, that spanking&#39;s ok because it&#39;s legal, that politics <br/>
should enter every conversation, or that Christianity is the ONLY way,  then <br/>
they&#39;re stepping on too many toes. We&#39;ll try for a few dozen posts to get our <br/>
point (and the point of this LIST) across; but after that, if the newbie <br/>
won&#39;t let it rest, it can, and occasionally does, come to verbal blows.<br/>
<br/>
There are countless people that have changed their parenting style by reading <br/>
here daily (me included) because the regulars here gently and respectfully <br/>
guide and suggest and openly discuss their ideas, roadblocks, and successes. <br/>
We are incredibly tolerant (some more than others &lt;g&gt;) of questions and <br/>
challenges from newbies. But I&#39;d say few, if any, of us are tolerant of <br/>
belittling children or arguing for the sake of arguing. Maybe belittling <br/>
children and arguing are common in the homes of newbies, so they don&#39;t see it <br/>
as offensive. HERE, though, it comes across as inconsiderate and totally <br/>
disrepectful of the list.<br/>
<br/>
So I apologize for any inconsiderate remarks I made. I hope that one day the <br/>
newbies will (after stepping back, quietly reading, and digesting what they <br/>
read) come to see the possibilities that this list tries to provide without <br/>
arguing every point.<br/>

<br/>
Yay! that&#39;s just what I&#39;m looking for!<br/>
And having been on this list now for less than 24 hours (wow, there&#39;s a lot of mail!!), I have to say I feel really excited and confident that being here will help meet my needs for companionship, support, challenge, growth, humour, and acceptance.<br/>
<br/>
Do you do intros here? Here&#39;s mine: I&#39;m ingrid (40), live with my French partner (44) and three children (ds 17yo, ds 5.5yo and dd 17 months) on an island in British Columbia, Canada. WE are a trilingual/multicultural family (French, German, English). My younger son was just offically registered this year for the first time as a &quot;homeschooler&quot; --i&#39;m grateful for the freedom in this province which means no testing, evalutions or interference whatsoever. <br/>
<br/>
The oldest has been unschooled much of his life but also private schooled, alternative schooled and has presently decided to quit public highschool after quasi-attending for a couple of years. Concerns i had regarding him are the reason that prompted me to find this list--i may post about that soon.  But as I read today I realise just how incredibly deep are my needs for like-minded folks--not just people who love and accept me as I am (which I have plenty of) but folks who *really* share my deepest principles and convictions about parenting and life and who will challenge and learn with me.<br/>
<br/>
Respectful parenting and interpersonal communication are my passions. I&#39;ve been studying these since childhood and used to know a lot about them :-). Almost daily i am discovering how little I truly know, how often i screw up (and my teen confirms this :-)), how much parenting is really mostly about *me* growing, how much i still want to learn about practising respect and compassion. I&#39;m excited about that journey!<br/>
<br/>
Though I find myself having less and less to write these days too, language and writing are my medium. I work at home as a freelance writer and have written and self-published a book on Natural Infant Hygiene (or Elimination Communication--both phrases I coined to refer to an age-old concept) about tuning in to and meeting an infant&#39;s elimination needs without relying on diapers. (I have a website at www.natural-wisdom.com ) My dh works at home too, mostly outdoors.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m presently enthusiastically studying and trying to put into practice the work of Marshall Rosenberg on Compassionate Communication (anybody here familiar with it? www.nonviolentcommunication.com ) Other family interests include anything to do with nature and our &quot;natural&quot; way of being, raw paleolithic nutrition (after 16 years as a vegetarian and 2 years as a raw vegan, wow! talk about a major paradigm shift!), reading, skateboarding, gardening, natural animal husbandry, engaged spirituality, acrobatics, travel, community, sustainable living, music (from early music and classical to hip-hop and dj&#39;ing), taking things out of boixes and putting them back in, mountain horse-trekking, and more!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to taking part here.<br/>
warmly,<br/>
ingrid<br/>

    That&#39;s really great news. I&#39;ll start putting a little back now that I<br/>
know for sure. We had a great time. I&#39;m going to have to hang with you all<br/>
for the food aspect. I just wasn&#39;t too great at finding stuff. McD not being<br/>
open sunday morning was an awful disappointment. LOL!<br/>
