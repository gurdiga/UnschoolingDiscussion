I&#39;m letting the parent be anonymous because I had this by e-mail, and<br/>
am taking it down to component topics. Please respond!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I used to make my kids brush teeth every night but then came mindful <br/>
parenting and an article about teeth being genetic not wether you <br/>
brush or not. I decided to rethink the everynight thing and see what <br/>
happened. My 2 yr old like to climb up on the sink and brush her <br/>
teeth sometimes 5 times a day and will then go a few days the 4 yr <br/>
old sometimes wants to brush and sometimes not. She usually ends up <br/>
brushing every other day. I now say &quot;do you want to brush teeth?&quot; <br/>
The teenager was raised with us always nagging and i have no idea if <br/>
he brushes at night but does in the morning to get rid of bad <br/>
breath. <br/>
<br/>
My two year old chipped a tooth and at dentist said to lay them on <br/>
the ground (almost sit on them if you have to) and brush and floss. <br/>
i thought how degrading would you like to have your teeth brushed <br/>
laying down on the floor? Duh..... But saddly this is what my sister <br/>
does to her kids and it is soo sad. <br/>
<br/>
Some people have good teeth and others have soft teeth that get <br/>
cavities no matter what so why fight over it.</div>

Wow, Anika needed a pediatric Dentist at age 3 because of tooth pain.  She<br/>
ended up having several fillings and two extractions all at once while<br/>
sedated.  The wonderful anesthesiologist talked to her in the waiting room<br/>
and let her color and sit on my lap while she gave her the initial dose of<br/>
medicine out in the waiting room.  She was allowed to stay with me right up<br/>
until she was ready for the procedure and I carried her to the dentist chair<br/>
after she was out.  Making the visit pleasant for her was a big priority to<br/>
avoid anxiety at future visits.  Halleluiah.<br/>
 <br/>
During the follow up visit the Dr. admired how clean her teeth were and<br/>
started to talk to me about letting her brush for herself.  His opinion was<br/>
kids should be allowed to do it themselves and come to good habits on their<br/>
own terms.  He was really pleased when I told him she brushed for herself<br/>
and I didn&#39;t make her.<br/>
 <br/>
I thought He&#39;d be lecturing me (under the circumstances ) but he told me<br/>
that decay is largely genetic and that his own daughter had lots of carries<br/>
and decay at a young age but that her teeth hardened up as she got older -<br/>
which is also what we experienced.  Mostly, I was floored by how respectful<br/>
and caring he always is with her.  Turns out he only works with children and<br/>
special needs adults.  <br/>
 <br/>
We went and talked to three different dentists before we found him but it<br/>
was worth the trouble.<br/>
 <br/>
So grateful,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think this is what happened to my son who had cavities in almost all <br/>
his baby teeth. I call them marshmellow teeth but as is big teeth came <br/>
in they must have hardened because there have been no problems. <br/>
<br/>
Some dentists would tellme he needed 10 fillings in the baby teeth and <br/>
the next would say they are baby teeth let them fall out.</div>
