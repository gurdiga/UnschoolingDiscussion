&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a fan of Dr. Phil McGraw, who is most famous for his appearances on<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oprah, but has done a lot of other really cool things.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I can&#39;t stand him.  Just goes to show you!  :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And *I* can&#39;t stand him AND have grown to be a fan.  That good advice from<br/>
