<br/>
This is a great forecast if you ask me.  Just like communism did, corporate<br/>
capitalism will probably collapse under its own weight.<br/>

From the article:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;As for his view on the demise of corporations, Drucker says people will<br/>
 </span></blockquote>still work for a living but will not cast their lives with a single company.<br/>
What Drucker calls the knowledge workers of today will save their best<br/>
efforts for non-profit social service organizations, where they can make a<br/>
bigger difference. &quot;The 20th century was the century of business,&quot; he said.<br/>
&quot;The next century is going to be the century of the social sector.&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>
