Wow...kinda cool!<br/>
<br/>
I remember as a kid, reading a book about poor kids who were sent out into <br/>
the woods by their parents (no, not the gingerbread house story) and they ended <br/>
up wasting away and dying.  I was so fascinated by it, and the pictures of the <br/>
kids wasting away.  Kinda wierd, I know.  Or the &quot;Little Match Girl&quot; story.<br/>
<br/>
It was a really old story (I remember the pictures were the old carved in <br/>
wood and stamped type pictures).  It seems, when children died more often and at <br/>
younger ages, these sort of stories were common.<br/>

&lt;&lt; It was a really old story (I remember the pictures were the old carved in <br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a ballad called &quot;Babes in the Wood.&quot;  It&#39;s very short and comes in <br/>
different versions, but the one I know best they were lost, not abandoned, &quot;as <br/>
I&#39;ve heard people say&quot; (it says, so it puts that into question too).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And when they were dead, the robin so red<br/>
brought strawberry leaves and over them spread;<br/>
and sang them a song the whole winter long<br/>
poor babes in the wood who never done wrong&quot;<br/>
<br/>
During the early 20th century, such &quot;tearjerkers&quot; were really popular.  I <br/>
guess with flu epidemic,  polio, rheumatic fever (which my mom had, and which her <br/>
15 year old brother died of), scarlet fever...   they were both less attached <br/>
and more sentimental in some ways.<br/>
