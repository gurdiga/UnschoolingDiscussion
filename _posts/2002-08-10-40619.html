constitutional rights (based on their own interpretation of the <br/>
constitution).   <br/>
<br/>
I personally couldn&#39;t understand why they were willing to put their kids at <br/>
such risk but they felt very strongly about it.  <br/>

apologize. I should have put quotes around the: They claimed that the school<br/>
committee&#39;s process of approval runs counter to their unschooling appraoch.<br/>
That sentence came from the decision. (I won&#39;t put quotes around it now<br/>
since I&#39;m not certain I didn&#39;t paraphrase it.)<br/>
<br/>
It seems to suggest one thing was said in court and another on the state<br/>
list.<br/>
