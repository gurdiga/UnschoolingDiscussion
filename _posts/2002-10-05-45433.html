<div id="ygrps-yiv-453777944">Perhaps thing are different state to state in 4-H but I wouldn&#39;t think so.<br/>
I am a co-leader of our 4-H group and lead several animal projects here.<br/>
What I like best about 4-H is that YOU decide your level of commitment.<br/>
<br/>
In our county at least, you can most certainly show animals without even<br/>
being in an animal project, per se.  If you do join a project group, you<br/>
don&#39;t have to do everything that the group offers.  Here a project is<br/>
defined as 6 learning activities and a community service activity.  I run<br/>
the rabbit project and offer 6 meetings with different topics.  Kids can be<br/>
involved in the project and simply not complete it if they don&#39;t do all six<br/>
meetings OR they can do some of the meetings and do other things, like talk<br/>
to breeders, do a rabbit judging contest, etc., to make out 6 learning<br/>
activities and complete the project that way.<br/>
<br/>
In 4-H, very little is MANDATORY.<br/>
