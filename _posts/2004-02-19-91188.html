<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534670593">School shootings may be rare events but we had one HERE in a small town <br/>
outside of Albany, NY last week.  A 16 year old boy shot a teacher with a shot gun. <br/>
 The teacher is ok, was shot in the leg.  <br/>
But of course, you never think it will happen near you.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know if it made the NATIONAL news or not because no one was killed, <br/>
but perhaps these do happen more often and we don&#39;t hear about them.  Did <br/>
anyone out there hear about this incident?  It was at Columbia High School in East <br/>
Greenbush, NY.<br/>
