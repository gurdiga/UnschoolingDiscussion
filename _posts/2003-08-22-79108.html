<div id="ygrps-yiv-325027775">Did someone here say they have a Turkish family member (husband was it?) or<br/>
was that on one of the other Unschooling spawned lists?<br/>
<br/>
I  have a friend who would like to get a song or two translated and she has<br/>
been able to find the Turkish lyrics, but no English.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone help?  She described the song and it sounded really neat, I&#39;d<br/>
love to see her get the lyrics.<br/>

I&#39;ll hope she sees this when she gets back, and maybe post it again in a<br/>
week or so.<br/>
