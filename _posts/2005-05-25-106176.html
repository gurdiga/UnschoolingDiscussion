<div id="ygrps-yiv-78386984">-=- The only real obsession I have is <br/>
that Ellis read, and read  well.  To me, that is a key to almost <br/>
everything else he will want to  explore on his own.  And we&#39;re book <br/>
junkies anyhow-=-<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;We&quot; doesn&#39;t include Ellis and might never, on the &quot;book junkie&quot;  part.<br/>
 <br/>
Please, before you think another book-related thought, read some or all of  <br/>
this (still a-building, as is all of my site, always):<br/>

There was a time when the only way for a kid to get information from  outside <br/>
his home and neighborhood was books.  (Think Abraham Lincoln, log  cabin in <br/>
the woods far from centers of learning.)   Now books tend to  be outdated, and <br/>
google.com is better for information.  If Abraham Lincoln  had had full-color <br/>
DVDs of the sights of other countries, of people speaking in  their native <br/>
accents and languages,  and of history, he would have  shoved those books aside <br/>
and watched those videos.<br/>
 <br/>
When someone thinks books are the one crucial step to any  further learning, <br/>
then books and school have crippled that person&#39;s ability to  think <br/>
expansively, and to see what&#39;s unfolding in front of them in the real  world.<br/>
