 </span></blockquote>My older two kids are 15 months apart too, the oldest being my daughter then <br/>
my son.  It was a lot of work to begin with but lots of laughs too.  My older <br/>
two kids are like the best of friends tho and hardly ever fight.  I have <br/>
always been totally amazed with this as my sister and I hated each other <br/>
until we were in our 20&#39;s.  One of my favorite memories of having a baby and <br/>
a toddler was my daughter being so curious about the vaseline I used on the <br/>
diaper table.  It got incredibly quiet one day while I was reading and I knew <br/>
I had to investigate.  I go into my sons room and there&#39;s my daughter up on <br/>
his diaper table slathering herself us with vaseline.  I was worried about <br/>
her falling off so I rushed over to pick her up and couldn&#39;t.... she was too <br/>
darn slippery.  I had to rush off and get a towell to wrap her up in to carry <br/>
her.  I laughed the whole time.  (I think it took me the better part of a <br/>
week to get all the vaseline out of the tub.)  Cherished memories.<br/>

We had a Vaseline moment when Andy was about 1.  We accidentally shut the cat <br/>
in his room during his nap.  When we opened the door about 1-1/2 hours later, <br/>
she shot out of there like a bat out of hell.  He was sitting on the floor <br/>
looking decidedly pleased with himself, with an open jar of vaseline and <br/>
well-lubricated hands.  When I found the cat, she was completely greased from <br/>
head to the tip of her tail.  She must not have minded it all that much, <br/>
because she hadn&#39;t scratched him.  The upside - no hairballs for a loooong <br/>
time!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302217900">Kim,<br/>
your postjust cracked me up.<br/>
<br/>
Here is another tale;<br/>
<br/>
WHEn  Ave was two we were visiting my mom and had set up a makeshift crib<br/>
in the very small spare bedroom. We listening for her little girl noises as<br/>
she was getting ready for her afternoon nap..and then suddenly it became<br/>
VERY quiet. Too quiet. <br/>
I became suspicious and crept upstairs to find that she had reached over<br/>
into my mom&#39;s makeup bag (full of archaic eyeshadows and the like) and<br/>
applied a glimmering bright blue liquid/paste eye shadow over her entire<br/>
face leaving very clear ovals around her eyes and mouth. It was beautifully<br/>
done ...really. She looked like a cross between a martian and a clown. <br/>
My mom and I nearly pee-ed ourselves laughing and she just stared at us<br/>
like we were deranged. <br/>
<br/>
Luckily I took some photos while we tried to clean her face off. THeyare<br/>
priceless. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-945843353">I love these stories!!!! I&#39;ll add my own. My kids werew 1 and 2, I was on the <br/>
phone(of course) and I heard wild chortling. going to investigate I found <br/>
that they had discovered the flour in one of the cupboards. My son, the <br/>
oldest had covered his sister in flour to the point that she was pure white <br/>
except for her blue eyes! She looked like the pillsbury doughboy! I couldnt <br/>
stop laughing but did manage to get a picture before plopping her in the <br/>
bath...... yes the tub... for further information.... dont do that, it makes <br/>
for instant plaster of Paris!<br/>
