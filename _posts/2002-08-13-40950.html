<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576574894"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What if every parent who intended to and did send a child to kindergarten at<br/>
&gt; 5 said &quot;up until that time, we were unschoolers, but now it&#39;s time for him to<br/>
&gt; go to school&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, Sandra, I&#39;d be estatic if everyone in my neighborhood WOULD<br/>
unschool, even if only until kindergarten.  Unfortunately, they don&#39;t.  I<br/>
have to agree with Ned that unschooling is, to a certain extent, good<br/>
parenting.  But many children don&#39;t enjoy the benefits of good parenting.<br/>
Many spend time in preschool and/or daycare, which I also wouldn&#39;t consider<br/>
unschooling environments.<br/>
<br/>
I think how I feel about homeschooling changed when my son hit kindergarten<br/>
age; I felt like there was a bit more pressure to &quot;do it right&quot;.  (Hence I<br/>
came looking for a nice email list to reassure me that maybe what I was<br/>
doing WAS &quot;right&quot;!)<br/>
<br/>
But I felt extremely isolated when my son was 3 and 4 years old.  The<br/>
homeschoolers told me he was &quot;too young&quot;, but virtually everybody had put<br/>
their kids in preschool at that age, and a fair number of the mothers I knew<br/>
had gone back to work.  I didn&#39;t fit in anywhere.  So I can relate to folks<br/>
who say they unschool from birth.  At least they can feel that they fit in<br/>
somewhere.<br/>
