<div id="ygrps-yiv-180440840">I have been on here alot lately, reading as much as I can in spare <br/>
time and playing with the kids, watching them play, and I have to say <br/>
honestly having the best time we have had in a long time.  I ask about <br/>
one of my sons difficulties with transitions just a few weeks ago... <br/>
we have had so few difficulties since I quit trying to rush him <br/>
through stuff and started really listening to his concerns.  I am not <br/>
saying I have been perfect in anyway but have tried to just relax.  We <br/>
have been talking alot more about what they would like to do, their <br/>
interests, just trying to listen to them more.  It is easier in some <br/>
ways with my two older boys  My 6 year old has always had a wide range <br/>
of interests and has talked alot about several things he would like to <br/>
do.  I found him software so he could do the stop motion animation <br/>
video he has been talking about and he is excited.  So my question, <br/>
using that as an example, is how much do I know get involved.  I dont <br/>
want to take over, of course, but he does need some help figuring out <br/>
the software.  How do you resist teaching, but continue to guide?  I <br/>
dont want to push him past his interest, but dont want him to get so <br/>
frustrated he quits before his interest is satisfied.  How do you find <br/>
a balance?</div>

<br/>
If he asks for help try to help him (and not take it over from him,  <br/>
and not &quot;make him do it your way&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had that trouble too.  Sometimes they want just a little help.   <br/>
Sometimes they want a lot.  Sometimes they don&#39;t know how much help  <br/>
they need.  Make it a dialog, a dance, a partnership.  Help a little,  <br/>
gauge his reaction, ask if he wants you to look something up, or call  <br/>
someone, or something indirectly helpful, and he might not even have  <br/>
thought of that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I dont want to push him past his interest, but dont want him to  <br/>
get so frustrated he quits before his interest is satisfied.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Some ways to help forestall frustration are to bring food or water or  <br/>
a drink; offer gum or mints or music or more silence or better  <br/>
lighting or close the blinds...   Help see to his comfort.   If he&#39;s  <br/>
getting tense, say something sweet or light or funny.  If he&#39;s  <br/>
getting REALLY tense, maybe ask him to help you do something physical  <br/>
(change a light bulb or get something off a high shelf or check the  <br/>
maibox or feed the dog)--something that gets him out and away from  <br/>
the project for just a minute or five, so he can breathe and think  <br/>
and get calmer.  If he doesn&#39;t go right back to it, don&#39;t worry.   <br/>
Don&#39;t mess up his workspace in the meantime.<br/>

provide it. If he gets frustrated, he might need and want help getting  <br/>
past it (just listening to his frustration is good) or he might not.  <br/>
Sometimes, it helps to watch and figure out when to step in and when  <br/>
to step back.<br/>

My dd had a game on her DS that she struggled with. She put it aside  <br/>
for awhile, until she felt more ready to deal with the challenges -  <br/>
her challenges. If I had suggested she should keep at it because she  <br/>
said she wanted it so bad and wanted to learn to play it, it wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
have helped. She definitely would have quit before her interest was  <br/>
satisfied, because I would have been interfering with her process. I  <br/>
just asked her about the situation and she said &quot;I recommend taking a  <br/>
break and going back to it later.&quot; Perhaps I suggested that, perhaps  <br/>
she came to that on her own. In any case, I tried to be responsive to  <br/>
what she needed and wanted at the time.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible that she might not have pursued that game again at all.  <br/>
And that would have been okay. Letting go of the expectation of a  <br/>
certain outcome was a helpful principle for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321610248">When Megan (7) gets a new computer/video game she likes to sit on my lap so I can see what she has created/found.  I&#39;m also there to read any instructions that pop up, but she generally doesn&#39;t want any input about how to do things.  <br/>
<br/>
This was hard for me at first because I&#39;m more of a &quot;read and follow the instructions&quot; kind of person.  By the time she needed my help I didn&#39;t know what to do.  I learned that it was a good idea for me to work through the game (as much as I could) and read the instructions after Megan went to sleep.  By doing that I could help her when she wanted me to help.<br/>
<br/>
One of her favorite games is Zoo Tycoon Extinct Animals.  She&#39;s had it for about six months and has spent many hours playing with dinosaurs and creating breeding groups.  This week we&#39;ve been working on a zoo together.  In the past she has let me pick which animal she places next.  This is the first time she&#39;s invited me to help her create a zoo and we are taking turns adding animals.  We&#39;ve been talking about how to keep zoo guests and animals happy.  Yesterday she found a new aspect of the game.  I&#39;m pretty sure I told her about it when we bought the game, but it didn&#39;t interest her at the time.  Now she is interested and I can offer help when she needs it.<br/>
<br/>
It also helps her if I ask her if she is getting frustrated and if she needs a break.<br/>

The good thing about vocalizing that is that the kids will get the  <br/>
idea &quot;if I&#39;m frustrated, I could take a break.&quot;<br/>
The bad thing is it can sound like criticism to a sensitive child (or  <br/>
if the mom says it in a critical way).<br/>

My sanity has been saved, and my relationship with H as well, by on-line<br/>
walk-throughs!! Not only am I willing to sit with him and read the<br/>
step-by-steps, I&#39;m also always on the lookout for the best directions I can<br/>
find... I&#39;ll start reading from the first walk-through and continue to check<br/>
out a few more, to compare details and writing styles, committed to finding<br/>
one that *speaks* the way Hayden needs to *hear.*<br/>
Console games don&#39;t *do* for me what they *do* for Hayden. Researching this<br/>
info for him is right up my alley. It&#39;s a win/win proposition, with far less<br/>
stress than the both of us working to figger it out (read: get frustrated)<br/>
alone.<br/>

Wyl, too. And he often likes to read with me over my shoulder as I&#39;m  reading <br/>
what I&#39;ve found to him. More and more, lately, he&#39;s looking things up  for <br/>
himself-which is good and growing and learning and confidence... but I miss  <br/>
&quot;doing for him&quot; a bit. That&#39;s something I wouldn&#39;t have thought of before  <br/>
reading here about finding ways to be joyful when doing for others. Some things  <br/>
still take more... concentration and effort to be joyful while doing, but it  <br/>
gets easier with time-and the rewards are wonderful. When I first started  <br/>
contemplating the idea, I thought, &quot;If I had to do the chores when I was a kid,  and <br/>
I&#39;m doing them for my kids so they don&#39;t have to do them, when is it *my*  <br/>
turn?!&quot; But once I got over that idea that it was turn-based or that I was owed  <br/>
&quot;time off&quot; from chores, it got easier. In a way, I still pick up candy <br/>
wrappers  on the floor for my inner child, but it is also partly for my kids. I  <br/>
wholeheartedly believe they will get more from observing me do it and living in  <br/>
a house with a picked-up carpet than if I yell and &quot;make them&quot; pick it up  <br/>
because &quot;they dropped it&quot;. Well, they&#39;d probably &quot;get&quot; the same from either  <br/>
method, but I prefer they &quot;get&quot; the former than the latter. With the latter  <br/>
they&#39;ll learn resentment and grumpiness and bigger/older folks being able  to boss <br/>
littler, less powerful folks. With the joyful method they&#39;ll learn that  we <br/>
can do things for others out of joy, love and wanting to be helpful, and that  <br/>
strings don&#39;t have to be attached to everything.<br/>
 <br/>
They grow up too fast. I don&#39;t want to be old and alone wishing I had done  <br/>
more for my kids while they were home.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

Last week, Sorscha in her excitement to show some new friends one of her <br/>
handheld games, accidentally deleted the entire thing.  She has been so <br/>
upset over it ever since.  That sadness & worry over possibly deleting <br/>
another game has spilled over into all her video helds, TV games, and <br/>
on-line games. She&#39;s chosen not to play any of them because she&#39;s concerned <br/>
about making the same mistake.  Dave is out-of-town, Sorscha has asked him <br/>
to play her WoW character to &#39;keep it up&#39;, and he&#39;s supporting her that way. <br/>
He doesn&#39;t see any of this as &#39;teachable moments&#39; but more as support for a <br/>
sad buddy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She has chosen to read A LOT - hence the Warriors reread!  I think it is <br/>
sidetracking her mind while she&#39;s processing how to work through her <br/>
feelings.  Nothing I try to &#39;teach&#39; is going to help - it&#39;s just gonna piss <br/>
my kid off - she&#39;s experienced that &#39;teach&#39; vibe from me before and finds <br/>
it&#39;s condensing, I see it in her eyes.  This past week, she&#39;ll look up from <br/>
reading and say, &quot;Mom, I&#39;m sad still and need a hug.&quot; I hug her and love <br/>
her.  Often times this past week, I&#39;ll just sit beside her as she reads. <br/>
She just needs support and understanding - not teaching.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I could choose to say things that I felt would &#39;teach&#39; her some life-type <br/>
skill like<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ohhhh well, life&#39;s not fair.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Get over it, it&#39;s just a game.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well if a video game has ruined your week then maybe you just shouldn&#39;t <br/>
play them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, if you weren&#39;t trying to show-up for your new friends&#39; maybe it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have happened.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re over-reacting.  Are you hormonal?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*I could go on and on with these yuckies because they&#39;re childhood type <br/>
memories for me - BUT I WON&#39;T because they&#39;re yucky.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Instead, I choose to support my daughter.  I give lots of hugs and love.  I <br/>
choose to say things like,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I love you and I&#39;m so sorry that happened.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do you need some extravagant lovins?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you need my help in anyway, just let me know - I&#39;m one of your biggest <br/>
supporters.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I know how it feels to make a mistake that you can&#39;t fix.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, I keep my mouth shut and love, love, love.  She&#39;ll work through this <br/>
in her own time without any teachable moments from me.   Opps, just got a <br/>
&quot;Mommy, I want you to snuggle with me for a moment.&quot;  That&#39;s more important <br/>
than finishing this so I&#39;m gonna end now.<br/>

Monday night we were in a condo in Santa Fe for the night.  Holly  <br/>
talked to her boyfriend on the phone and was frustrated and jealous  <br/>
because he was back home having a very good time with Marty her  <br/>
brother.  She cried, and came to talk to me about it in the next  <br/>
room, where I was in bed reading.  I asked if she wanted to lie down  <br/>
with me.   She said yes, and she lay down with her back to me and I  <br/>
stroked her hair and her back and her arm while we talked. Even  <br/>
though I thought she was being unreasonable and selfish, I comforted  <br/>
her instead of shaming her.  Soothingly, I reminded her of why it was  <br/>
GOOD for them to have things between them that they didn&#39;t share with  <br/>
her, that they were friends before she was Brett&#39;s girlfriend, and  <br/>
that there&#39;s a huge advantage to her and to all of us of them having  <br/>
a strong bond.   I wasn&#39;t saying it in any &quot;You should know this&quot; way  <br/>
(because she does &#39;know&#39; that, but it wasn&#39;t preventing her gut  <br/>
reaction to the fact that they were drinking and staying up late  <br/>
watching movies and laughing and having fun.  I reminded her (softly  <br/>
and gently) that they hadn&#39;t invited a bunch of people over, they  <br/>
hadn&#39;t gone out anywhere to drink, they were just at home, just the  <br/>
two of them.<br/>
<br/>
She calmed down (and got quiet, which was important to me, because  <br/>
Joyce and Kathryn were trying to go to sleep and there were other  <br/>
neighbors), and I wasn&#39;t asking her to agree with me or to respond, I  <br/>
was just speaking to her in gentle, reassuring ways that had the  <br/>
undercurrent of helping her see that it wasn&#39;t really an ideal reason  <br/>
for anger or jealously or frustration.<br/>

It&#39;s always seemed a bit strange to me when parents shame and belittle<br/>
those feelings that their kids have, when really what they need more<br/>
than anything is calm reassurance that they are feeling these things and<br/>
they can get through them calmly and rationally.  Telling a child to<br/>
&quot;get over it&quot; without them knowing why or giving them tools to do so,<br/>
seems like such a bad idea, yet it happens all around us.<br/>
<br/>
I know waaaaaay too many adults that grew up with shaming and belittling<br/>
that mentally stunted them from feeling those things and unable to talk<br/>
themselves out of those feelings in calm and rational ways.  They take<br/>
those feelings and make decisions large and small based on them without<br/>
knowing that they really can step out of those feelings and that there<br/>
are good reasons to do so.<br/>
<br/>
It seems so obvious to me that the simple act of calming a kid of any<br/>
age with compassion and kindness and calm will help them be adults that<br/>
behave that way.</div>

There&#39;s a continuum, and this was WAY toward the safe and what is  <br/>
your PROBlem end of it.<br/>
<br/>
So I didn&#39;t say that, but I also didn&#39;t coo and soothe her with &quot;I  <br/>
know, they&#39;re awful, I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re hanging out together  <br/>
without you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said to me &quot;Don&#39;t you even CARE that Marty&#39;s drinking?&quot;  She  <br/>
pretty much wanted me to take her side over Marty&#39;s and Brett&#39;s, but  <br/>
Brett is 24, Marty is not drinking lots, nor alone, and that&#39;s the  <br/>
first time I know of (besides Kirby&#39;s party in late July) that he has  <br/>
had a single drop of alcohol at home.  So no, I pretty much didn&#39;t  <br/>
care.   He wasn&#39;t out driving, he wasn&#39;t being sneaky, he was safe on  <br/>
his butt on a couch in the den with his dad two rooms away, and after  <br/>
a while he was going to go to sleep in his own bed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Never once while I was imagining the scenario, did I imagine cooing! <br/>
You&#39;ve never struck me as one who does that, you&#39;re just nice and<br/>
calming.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m kind of the same way, so I can envision how it came out. <br/>
Margaux likes to be cooed and soothed, and it is really really hard for<br/>
me to do that when she&#39;s upset because it&#39;s not my style.  Chamille<br/>
would run, and fast, if I cooed her when she&#39;s upset!<br/>
<br/>
Chamille gets irritated when I coo Margaux, the way Margaux likes.  It&#39;s<br/>
funny because when Chamille watches Margaux when us parents aren&#39;t<br/>
around, Margaux doesn&#39;t do any of those dramatic upsets that need to be<br/>
calmed.  She knows without a doubt that her sister absolutely won&#39;t<br/>
tolerate it and Margaux strives to be in her sister&#39;s good graces.  It&#39;s<br/>
kind of cool really, we go out and come home to happy peaceful children<br/>
that are getting along.</div>
