****************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>
