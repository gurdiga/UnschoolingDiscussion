<div id="ygrps-yiv-706479880"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: Bobbie &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:insomniaaks@...">insomniaaks@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; less than a week?? try ONE day! My theory is people<br/>
&gt; with houses/rooms that are clean alllll the time must<br/>
&gt; clean 3 times a day and never LIVE in the house, and<br/>
&gt; keep the kids in cages somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm... we have a nice clean house and our kids definitely live and learn in<br/>
it all day long! As I speak, DS is building a pirate fort in the living room<br/>
and DD is scattering crayons to kingdom come.<br/>
I used to think that too  - that people couldn&#39;t possibly interact with<br/>
their kids and have a clean house (confessions of a former un-housekeeper,<br/>
mess-a-holic :-). My husband is a very neat and tidy guy and over the years<br/>
has showed me how to keep a clean house most of the time. Sure, the kids&#39;<br/>
toys are still out sometimes, but we have little routines that keep it all<br/>
in order. Anyone going upstairs carries toys or clean laundry and puts it<br/>
away, anyone coming downstairs brings dirty laundry, or anything else that<br/>
needs to come down. Before we get anything new out, we clean up the old mess<br/>
(unless it is going to be used later - the pirate fort will probably stay up<br/>
for awhile, but the crayons will get picked up before we go on to anything<br/>
else). In the evening, we have a little picking up routine so that the house<br/>
is in order when we wake up in the morning. Any given room usually takes<br/>
less than 5 minutes to straighten out. In the morning, I clean the kitchen<br/>
up while the kids eat breakfast, and straighten up the bathroom after<br/>
everyone&#39;s all washed up. The kids take their dishes to the sink and hang up<br/>
their towels and such.<br/>
I must confess that I love having the house so organized and I really<br/>
don&#39;t miss doing the panic drill if someone is coming over to visit :-). My<br/>
mom was like that when I was a kid and I just hated it! That and the<br/>
marathon house or room-cleaning sessions because everything had gotten in<br/>
such a terrible state, or the fact that we could never find anything we were<br/>
looking for. I remember my mom trying to bribe me into keeping my room<br/>
clean, at the same time that the rest of the house was always a total mess<br/>
(we only ate dinner on the dining room table during holidays, the rest of<br/>
the time it was a repository). She never taught me by example the skills<br/>
necessary to just *keep* a clean house.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But maybe that&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; how all kids are. Mine are though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids learn from example. If you&#39;re not a tidy housekeeper, they won&#39;t learn<br/>
the skills either. I&#39;m not saying this is necessarily true for you, but it<br/>
might be one reason they&#39;re &quot;not that way&quot;. I was never great at picking up<br/>
my room (as my folks like to remind me, it was pretty much a trash heap),<br/>
but now I&#39;m good at it, it&#39;s a learned attribute. Kids that live in a house<br/>
where people cheerfully put in the daily work to keep it neat also learn<br/>
those skills. Now whether or not they take root for awhile might depend more<br/>
on personality and such, but without the example the skills never have a<br/>
chance. I have to say I am convinced that in the long run it takes far less<br/>
time and effort to keep a house clean than to clean it after it has gotten<br/>
fairly messy and dirty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I figure as long as it&#39;s not dangerous and/or<br/>
&gt; unsanitary then I&#39;m not going to waste my energy<br/>
&gt; picking up allll day long everyday. What a grouch I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; be! :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Honestly, I used to hate housework too but now I love it. I don&#39;t know<br/>
how/why/when I made the switch. Maybe just from having a clean house and<br/>
wanting to keep it that way. I now find I&#39;m way grouchier in a cluttered<br/>
room (like my office is right now, LOL!) than I am in a clean one. Choosing<br/>
to make housework a joy was somewhat of a conscious choice for me. And the<br/>
more joyous about it I am, the more fun my kids have with it. We make<br/>
everything a game and they actually beg (!!!!) to scrub toilets or floors.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying anyone should or must change or even that it&#39;s better to have<br/>
a clean rather than a cluttery place. Just sharing my own journey. But if<br/>
anyone is interested in a great system for learning how to joyfully keep a<br/>
clean house, I&#39;d recommend <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.FlyLady.net">http://www.FlyLady.net</a> . I&#39;m trying to get my mom<br/>
to do this as every time we visit her, we have to spend 5 minutes cleaning<br/>
off the table before we can eat on it, and 10 minutes cleaning the kitchen<br/>
before we can cook, and, and, and..... And then there&#39;s my grandma. She&#39;s<br/>
got tons of boxes scattered around her house filled with all kinds of just<br/>
stuff. The boxes are marked &quot;DSA&quot; (for &quot;Do Something About&quot;) and some are<br/>
dated from 30 or 40 years ago. :-)<br/>

One of the coolest stories from the separated twins study was grown men who <br/>
both were meticulous and kept house the very same way, arranged their desks <br/>
and closets the same way, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
When asked why they were that way, one said it&#39;s because his mom was neat and <br/>
taught him to be that way.  The other said it was in reaction to his mother&#39;s <br/>
sloppiness.  <br/>
<br/>
Obviously neither could be right, as they were the same as adults although <br/>
they came from different backgrounds (nurture) but same background <br/>
(genetic/nature).<br/>
<br/>
I have packrattishness from both sides of the family.  I have it, but my <br/>
sister doesn&#39;t.  When she wants something kept longterm, she gives it to ME!  <br/>
And says &quot;Keep this for me!&quot;  &lt;g&gt;  (Hey, lots of my friends to too...)<br/>

<br/>
These studies sure have set some long held notions on their ear.<br/>
<br/>
My mom was organized to the hilt and while I enjoy the &quot;idea&quot; of being<br/>
this way it&#39;s often missed.  Before my kids entered the picture my house<br/>
was a study in chaos to perfection.  If I didn&#39;t have the time to keep it<br/>
absolutely perfect it stayed in a state of decline.  Then I would clean<br/>
until it was ready for the cameras from Better Homes & Gardens.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned a new skill now.  I&#39;m able to keep it &quot;sanitary&quot; and fairly<br/>
organized.  I&#39;ve had to override my instincts and settle for &quot;better&quot;<br/>
instead of &quot;perfect&quot;.  It makes me a more fun mom and THAT had to be the<br/>
priority.<br/>

While I was pg with dd2 I read Siblings Without Rivalry <br/>
and one thing that really hit home with me was that <br/>
describing what you see, either &#39;good&#39; or &#39;bad&#39; or how <br/>
you feel is much more use than labelling a child or <br/>
even a behaviour as &#39;good&#39; or &#39;bad.&#39;  So saying &#39;that&#39;s <br/>
naughty!&#39; to a 2yo doesn&#39;t mean much, but &#39;I see a cut <br/>
chair!!&#39; or &#39;I&#39;m mad, I don&#39;t like to see furniture cut <br/>
up!!&#39; tells the child exactly what the problem is and <br/>
how it&#39;s affecting you right then.  So &#39;good girl!&#39; has <br/>
been used very little, but &#39;ta, love, that&#39;s just where <br/>
I wanted it&#39; has been used more.  I also dislike <br/>
&#39;naughty&#39; cos it&#39;s the kind of thing that means that <br/>
the problem is that they&#39;ve been caught, not what has <br/>
been done.  I could go on at length (can you tell? LOL) <br/>
about &#39;good girl&#39; but I&#39;ll spare you that one...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-132935611">The kidlets named the &quot;ghost&quot; when we first moved in the house.  We would be<br/>
sitting in the diningroom and knobs from the stove would suddenly come<br/>
flying off.  Hubby insisted it was vibrations or the stove was old or<br/>
something.  The kidlets and I aren&#39;t buying it &lt;g&gt;  I mean, &quot;vibrations&quot;????<br/>
So strong they made the knobs going sailing across a room but not strong<br/>
enough for us to feel them &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He cured that &quot;problem&quot; by selling the stove and buying a new one.  But he<br/>
hasn&#39;t cured the dresser drawers that keep being opened in the middle of the<br/>
night &lt;g&gt;  And we&#39;ve informed him he is not &quot;curing&quot; that problem by selling<br/>
the dresser cause my grandfather built it (one for each of his<br/>
grandchildren).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I hear you! That&#39;s one reason I like having routines though. At any<br/>
given time, I know that the house is *clean* and even if there&#39;s a bit of a<br/>
mess to pick up here or there, I don&#39;t have to worry that the laundry also<br/>
is piled up and the toilet needs scrubbing and the oven is dirty, and...etc.<br/>
I expect that with little kids around all day the house is going to get<br/>
untidy, but I&#39;m happy that it&#39;s not also filthy, KWIM? :-) In the evening,<br/>
we tidy everything up a bit more and when I wake up in the morning it is to<br/>
a clean house. That sure helps my day go better!<br/>
<br/>
The thing I really need to do now is to just start reducing stuff. There&#39;s<br/>
absolutely no reason that I have so many T-shirts that when they are all<br/>
clean they will not fit in my drawer. Or have so many CDs that I never<br/>
listen to, etc. etc.  This is such a freeing thing. Last year we got rid of<br/>
our hodgepodge of tea mugs and just got 6 nice matching blue ones. They all<br/>
fit in my cupboard (half don&#39;t have to reside in my dishwasher), they look<br/>
lovely, and every time I open my cupboard I&#39;m not in danger of being felled<br/>
by a mug. Baby steps, baby steps...<br/>
