<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681405618">Well, this may be the second time i de-lurked.. i forget.. but here <br/>
i am, i&#39;m Linda and i&#39;m in Texas and i have an eight year old gifted <br/>
child who i am beginning to unschool--and a fourteen year old who <br/>
has just survived jr hi.. and is off to high school.. to see if it <br/>
is okay for him.. i told him if he didn&#39;t find a way to enjoy high <br/>
school.. we&#39;d make some other arrangements.. <br/>
<br/>
i was just perusing the past couple of weeks of messages to get up <br/>
to speed here.. i see someone else noticed the &quot;bickering&quot; i did <br/>
that kept me at arms length from the group for a while, but what the <br/>
heck.. i can delete messages i find non productive, right?? hahah..<br/>
<br/>
also noting discussion on housework that seems to have sparked some <br/>
conflict.. haha. HOUSEWORK ARGGHHH... it is my nemisis.. and i tend <br/>
to order my kids to do it.. --my justification to them for these <br/>
demands is that as a member of the family they enjoy the percs of <br/>
their situation..i.e. lots of STUFF.. video games, food, shelter, <br/>
computers etc.. so as members of the family that provides this for <br/>
them they have a responsibility to contribute to said family at <br/>
their own level of ability--  as do i and their father.. adn their <br/>
older sister when she was living  here. this works very well.. IN <br/>
THEORY<br/>
<br/>
In reality, the eight year old just tells me NO and refuses to do <br/>
anything and the fourteen year old says oh yes he&#39;ll do it.. and <br/>
then never does.. i give up.. my house is very messy.. lolll... my <br/>
husband occasionally stirs us all up and gets we get the house <br/>
clean.. (i&#39;m great at teaching them <br/>
philisophical/spiritual/touchyfeely truths etc. of life, but their <br/>
dad is in charge of the real world. (the &quot;real world&quot; and i have, it <br/>
seems always been at odds with each other.. )<br/>
<br/>
I am also very happy to see such a large group of unschoolers. i <br/>
myself grew up going to public school but looking back see i learned <br/>
most of what i know at home from my mom and her parents.. and from <br/>
reading myself.. (well, except algebra, geometry etc.. ) .. my mom <br/>
saw public school for what it is--obedience training--back in the <br/>
sixties. <br/>
<br/>
i also relate to what oh.. i forgot who... said about her son --the <br/>
one with the bike and not stopping at stopsigns trying to impress <br/>
other kids.. this is very like my own eight year old and is one of <br/>
the very reasons he is going to stay home for his education. the <br/>
stress of trying to be perfect to everyone (teachers, bad kids, <br/>
popular kids, sporty kids etc etc) so they will like him has really <br/>
done damage to his self esteem. i can see him beginning to relax a <br/>
little already just knowing he will not have to go back to school. <br/>
He said school was boring and that he already knew most of what they <br/>
were trying to teach him.. of this i have no doubt.. well maybe <br/>
some, but he knows a lot from growing up with me and spending time <br/>
with my mom-the-compulsive-pedagogue and obsessive naturalist. <br/>
<br/>
my grandfather &quot;read the law&quot; himself and became a lawyer in the <br/>
early twenties just by passing the barr, so i figure unschooling is <br/>
in my blood... <br/>
<br/>
i am trying to find more unschoolers here in san antonio. I would <br/>
very much like my son to be in contact with other kids like himself. <br/>
he tends to isolate himself in the summer --except for an <br/>
increasingly active online life with other video gamers and <br/>
wrestling (ARGGHH) fans.. <br/>
<br/>
I am an artist who is trying to find a way to support myself without <br/>
a job as i am moving out to an apt across the creek (we live in a <br/>
suburban area on the edge of the houses and across the creek from an <br/>
apt complex) and get a divorce.. all quite friendly.. the kids are <br/>
for it.. they would like some peace in the house.. i will be sort of <br/>
in the back yard for them.. the youngest (the homeschooler) will <br/>
probly spend most of his time with me.. <br/>
<br/>
SOOO any of you from texas? anybody from near san antonio?<br/>
let me know because i have joined a mailling list for san antonio <br/>
homeschoolers.. a few of which are unschoolers--a very small group <br/>
that needs more participants. it is for those homeschooling for <br/>
secular rather than religious reasons.. and it is safe to say that <br/>
most homeschoolers in this area are doing so for religious reasons. <br/>
(something i dont really get.. but hey, to each his own.. si?)<br/>
<br/>
sorry for so much writing..<br/>
any of you would not be the first to point out that i talk too much..<br/>

live in the same house but not together because we can&#39;t afford 2 <br/>
households.   Anyway good luck and thanks for coming out of lurkdom<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you look at it from the child&#39;s point of view, or change it around to a<br/>
new sitaution, it becomes clearer why the children don&#39;t see the<br/>
reasonableness of this.<br/>
<br/>
Adults get to choose where to live and pretty much dictate how money gets<br/>
spent (or at least can veto any purchase). We may think we&#39;re pretty<br/>
generous about kid choices but if we turn it around it is very controlling.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine your husband deciding on his own where you would live, which house<br/>
to buy (to primarily suit his needs but taking into account any needs of<br/>
yours that he deemed worthy) and how the decor would look. He would listen<br/>
to your suggestions but they&#39;d only be taken into consideration if they<br/>
didn&#39;t interfere with his needs. Say he&#39;s a big sports fan (and you&#39;re not)<br/>
and he decided the house would be a shrine to his favorite team.  If you had<br/>
a special non-sports related picture he might suggest it could hang on the<br/>
refrigerator or in a corner of your room so it didn&#39;t interfer with his<br/>
decorating scheme.<br/>
<br/>
All meals would conform to his idea of good with maybe a little concession<br/>
to your tastes (potato chips instead of pretzels). You might get to go to<br/>
your favorite restaurant once in a while but your order couldn&#39;t be too far<br/>
off what he thought you should eat and couldn&#39;t be too expensive.<br/>
<br/>
If you wanted to buy something outside your regular allowance -- like a book<br/>
or something -- you&#39;d need to convince him that it was worthy of purchase<br/>
and you&#39;d need to later demonstrate that you were using it enough for it to<br/>
have been worthy of purchase or you&#39;d hear about it the next time you wanted<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
If you wanted to go somewhere or get something at the store, it would have o<br/>
wait until it was convenient for your husband to take you.<br/>
<br/>
In a way, ending up in a family is not unlike going to school. There&#39;s no<br/>
choice about being born/going to school (at least not for most kids!) or<br/>
what family/school you&#39;ll end up with. The adults are supposedly thinking of<br/>
everything the kids need and supplying them with it and expecting the kids<br/>
to appreciate it. The kids don&#39;t, of course, because what the adults are<br/>
really supplying is what the *adults* want the kids to have, not what the<br/>
kids want.<br/>
<br/>
We may have decided what we wanted for our kids was a big backyard. Then it<br/>
seems reasonable since the kids live there and should appreciate it, they<br/>
should mow it when they&#39;re old enough. But as much as the kids might enjoy<br/>
the backyard, they didn&#39;t choose it and knowing what they&#39;d need to do to<br/>
&quot;pay&quot; for it (for the rest of their childhoods) they might have chosen --<br/>
had they been able to be informed and been allowed the choice -- to buy a<br/>
house with a miniscule yard next to a park. So why should they appreciate<br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sort of like getting showered by nothing but expensive Barbies and<br/>
parephernalia at every gift giving occasion when you&#39;ve told people that<br/>
what you really love is dinosaurs. Should you think it&#39;s wonderful and<br/>
appreciate the &quot;thoughtfulness&quot; of the gift givers? Or are the &quot;gifts&quot;<br/>
really forms of control?<br/>
<br/>
But if we act as though our children are partners without demanding that<br/>
they act as partners then they will be partners because it&#39;s more joy<br/>
inspiring to be invited with open arms with no strings attached than it is<br/>
to be required to uphold your membership in something you never asked to<br/>
join.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-394340407">Linda L. and all of you wonderful people,<br/>
<br/>
Hi. I am de-lurking too.  This is my first post.  I just signed on<br/>
yesterday.  I just wanted to say &quot;Hi&quot; to all of you and tell Linda that we<br/>
live in Austin.  We occasionally go down to San Antonio.  We love the zoo<br/>
and my grandmother lives there.  I have a 6 year old son - Joey and a 3<br/>
year old daughter - Skylar and one due in September.  We are thrilled to<br/>
be in Texas where it is so easy to homeschool and we are dedicated<br/>
unschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
Hello to all of you.  I am very glad that you are all out there.  The<br/>
support is so needed.<br/>
<br/>
Sherry<br/>
