Subject: New Unpreschool List starting<br/>
<br/>
Many  of you already know Diane Flynn Keith.  She&#39;s the Editor of Homefires,  <br/>
author of Carschooling, and owner of several yahoo groups, including  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ClickSchooling/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ClickSchooling/</a> and  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Carschooling/.">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Carschooling/.</a>  Did I leave anything  <br/>
out?  Probably!   She&#39;s also a long time homeschooler and CHN  Local <br/>
Contact, not to mention a person who is often interviewed by the media  <br/>
regarding homeschooling.  She&#39;ll be speaking at next year&#39;s CHN Family  Expo <br/>
too, which I&#39;m looking forward to.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, Diane is one  busy person!  Even so, her passion regarding <br/>
the intense government  push to make preschool and kindergarten compulsory <br/>
not just in California  but nationwide is leading her into a new activity.<br/>
<br/>
Please read what she  has to say and forward it to all the people you know <br/>
who are also interested  in young children (homeschoolers or not).  Join her <br/>
new list and please  contribute ideas that will help support parents of <br/>
young children so that  they don&#39;t feel that they MUST send their children <br/>
to preschool in order for  them to have a successful start in life!<br/>
