<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226767513">I have a friend who  lives in Irealand. She only writes at christmas <br/>
and keeps me up with what her children (all grown now) are doing.    <br/>
They all went to ps and all have qualificatins and degrees and have <br/>
won scholarships to study in America and taught english in French <br/>
schools.  These children are the same age as my older children.  I am <br/>
very proud of my childrens attainments - none did well at school - <br/>
but all have succedded in life.  So why does this friend make me feel <br/>
as though her children are better than mine - Oh! she doesnt do it <br/>
intentionally.<br/>
I feel the same way about h/s ing.   We do hear so much about how <br/>
succeful h/s ers are, that we expect miracles from our own children - <br/>
acedemically miracles.  When my dd has no interest in anything much <br/>
at all, I wonder why...... why isnt she like all these other h/s <br/>
children who greed for knowledge......<br/>
<br/>
I loved grandma on the computer!!!!!<br/>
