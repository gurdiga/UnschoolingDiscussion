<div id="ygrps-yiv-280020384">Hi Michele!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I knew he had dyslexia and the<br/>
&gt;school waited until 5th grade to do something about it even though I am<br/>
&gt;a fierce advocate for my son. By then they wanted him tested up the<br/>
&gt;wazoo to &quot;prove it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The school took no time in &quot;proving&quot; that Chris was ADHD...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He was so damaged by frustration and trauma from<br/>
&gt;public school humiliation, etc. and being molested there that - in my<br/>
&gt;opinion - the stress triggered something like the label bipolar.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because I am bipolar I see all these symptoms and think that maybe Chris is.<br/>
But listening to you, I am wondering if I am right. Maybe ha is just<br/>
reacting to all the stress that he is under. He is so normal at home.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He is 90% calmer in the summer when he is not in school.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same here. The difference between home and school is night and day, no<br/>
matter if its summer or just a three day week end.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;The school said &quot;we have no money, no space,<br/>
&gt;no time, no tutors, etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They tell me that they do not have the resources to deal with Chris&#39;<br/>
behavior so they want to warehouse him with other kids who they can&#39;t or<br/>
don&#39;t want to deal with. And then they talk about how I am stunting his<br/>
socialization by taking him out of school. Their reasources are so lacking<br/>
but they have taken the time to call me three seperate times and try to talk<br/>
me out of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;Thankfully &quot;they&quot; gave me<br/>
&gt;&quot;permission.&quot; I am angry, hurt, wounded, etc. over all of this. They are<br/>
&gt;MY kids not the school&#39;s. Now that we are &quot;out&quot; we can begin the healing<br/>
&gt;process:) Michele<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t know how it galls me (actually you probably do know) that I have<br/>
to wait on permission to do what I know is best for my child. I don&#39;t worry<br/>
about jail. I worry that they will take him from me. That&#39;s the nightmare<br/>
that keeps me up at night. And when I finally get him out of school I swear<br/>
I am going to find a state where DSS is not called out abitrarily on people<br/>
and homeschooling is not a dirty word and that is where I am going to move.<br/>
<br/>
OK... jumping down off the soap box. WAIT! I&#39;ll stay up here. This climbing<br/>
up and down is making my bad knee hurt&lt;GGG&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Brightest Blessings,<br/>
