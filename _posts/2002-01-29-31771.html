<div id="ygrps-yiv-351821463">&lt;&lt;many unschooling parents seem to have kids that don&#39;t struggle with<br/>
choice&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Think there might be some correlation there?<br/>
<br/>
I have 5 kids.  My oldest makes very responsible, classy choices for herself<br/>
most all the time. She is 11 and completely makes all of her own decisions.<br/>
Sometimes she is pleased with the results and sometimes not.<br/>
<br/>
My 8yo is a wild man.  He is running flat out all day.  He is loud,<br/>
rambunctious, tense, etc..  He makes all of his own decisions and he is very<br/>
often disappointed in the results.  I talk with him about how others may<br/>
view the things he does, possible consequences to his actions that I see,<br/>
but he makes the final decisions.  Just now is he starting to make the<br/>
connections between actions and consequences.  It took him a long time and<br/>
he still has very far to go, but if I was setting the limits he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have gotten this far.<br/>
<br/>
My others are still little but continue to make most of their own decisions.<br/>
I have noticed that if they are doing something that seems &quot;wrong&quot; to me, if<br/>
I stop and ask them about it, they have very valid reasons for doing what<br/>
they are doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258713972">Actually, I said if I sound defensive it is because I haven&#39;t gotten <br/>
over the past here.  And I also said that it is frustrating right now <br/>
because we are not supposed to bring up past grievances but that <br/>
hamstrings us when someone paints an inaccurate rosy picture of <br/>
certain things that can be answered by pointing directly to a <br/>
specific post from back then.<br/>
<br/>
As for the issue of Wyndham, I just can&#39;t win here.  If I talk about <br/>
him I get blasted because he is not unschooled by certain people&#39;s <br/>
standards and I&#39;m told to stop talking about it because I <br/>
am &quot;watering down the term&quot; even when I specifically say there are <br/>
things we do with him that are not his choice and that even I think <br/>
he probably should not be considered an unschooler right now.  In <br/>
other words, even after Sarah pointed out that I was not making it <br/>
clear enough that he is not unschooled but rather on a journey trying <br/>
to get there and I started being careful to include that in every <br/>
post in which I talked about him, I was still being told that I was <br/>
giving an inaccurate picture of unschooling and watering down the <br/>
term. <br/>
When I say I am done talking about him because I think most of you <br/>
have heard enough, I&#39;m told that I should explain again.  <br/>

<br/>
Me:  I do see that there could be a strong correlation, but the rest <br/>
of your post clearly shows that there is a process involved. You <br/>
spend time talking to your children and examining their decisions <br/>
without forcing or coercing them to do what you think is best.  Their <br/>
decision making abilities didn&#39;t develop in a vacuum simply because <br/>
they are unschooled.  Your parenting style appears to be a great <br/>
influence, and, from reading the messages here, I&#39;m starting to see <br/>
that one&#39;s parenting style cannot be divorced from unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My two oldest children, by contrast, haven&#39;t been unschooled, but my <br/>
12yo daughter makes very responsible, classy choices for herself most <br/>
of the time as well.  This I attribute to my parenting style and her <br/>
personality bent. My 12 yo son, on the other hand, does not make <br/>
decisions that are in his best interest.  His decisions have been a <br/>
threat to his own safety and the safety of others, at times.  Like <br/>
you and your son, we spend a great deal of time talking him through <br/>
the cause and effect of his actions, but he often doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; <br/>
until he has experienced a consequence that is painful for him. He <br/>
has been this way since birth, it seems. Would unschooling/NCP change <br/>
his personality bent,I wonder?</div>

 </span></blockquote>I suspect he would still take risks but perhaps learn sooner how to search<br/>
out the consequences and deal with them since they&#39;d be his responsibility.<br/>
(To some extent.) Some people are wired that way. To some people the actions<br/>
are worth the consequences even if the rest of us can&#39;t see how it possibly<br/>
could be so. Why would it be worth the risk to jump your motorcycle across<br/>
20 tractor trailer trucks? Why would it be worth the risk to test fly<br/>
experimental planes? Why would it be worth the risk to experiment with<br/>
explosive chemicals to create bigger and better fireworks?<br/>
<br/>
What kind of risks does he take?<br/>
