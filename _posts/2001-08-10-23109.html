<div id="ygrps-yiv-636214080">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
   I just joined this group and thought I should introduce myself...<br/>
<br/>
My name is Elizabeth and I&#39;m a mother of three, ages 11, 9, and 2 <br/>
1/2. My 9 year old daughter is currently living with her dad in <br/>
California, but the two boys both live with me near London, England. <br/>
The 11 year old is now in his second (non-consecutive) year of <br/>
homeschooling. The littlest can&#39;t quite be said to be &quot;homeschooling&quot; <br/>
until he is &quot;school age&quot; I suppose, but he is definitely learning <br/>
lots... that being the thing kids do and all. ;)<br/>
<br/>
My situation is probably a lot different from most in one key way -- <br/>
I am not a full-time stay at home mom, and neither is my partner. The <br/>
little one goes to a childminder every morning plus two afternoons a <br/>
week and the oldest often comes with me to the office or out to <br/>
meetings. I do have the luxury of being able to get most of my work <br/>
done anywhere (since I&#39;m building Web site software and such), so at <br/>
the moment I work from home three days a week.<br/>
<br/>
The first year of homeschooling was frought with myriad fights over <br/>
the time it took Noe to get work done. That boy has an amazing way of <br/>
making a simple task turn into a two hour long chore and it grates on <br/>
me like nothing you can imagine. Last year Noe went back to a regular <br/>
school -- a very good one, mind you, where he was quite happy and <br/>
everything -- but he still managed to nearly flunk all of his <br/>
academic subjects. I could listen to him talk for hours about <br/>
everything he was learning, but he simply didn&#39;t turn assignments in, <br/>
and could not make the grade. This year I realized that there was <br/>
going to be no education at all if it wasn&#39;t a self-guided one. He <br/>
has to want to learn what he&#39;s learning, there has to be a purpose to <br/>
it in HIS mind, and then I have to get out of the way and let him get <br/>
to it. <br/>
<br/>
At the moment there are a few things that are paramount in his eleven <br/>
year old brain: 1) Warhammer 4000 games (a role playing game with <br/>
miniatures and things)  2) Sci-Fi fantasy stories/movies/art and his <br/>
own inventions based on same and 3) his personal quest to be <br/>
financially independent by the age of 12 (one month away). While none <br/>
of these seem very sensible or realistic to me (though I do love the <br/>
sci-fi!), I&#39;ve been looking for ways to use them as hooks to get him <br/>
to learn subjects that he needs. I&#39;ve used the role playing games as <br/>
a way to get him to study history and write about it -- to make new <br/>
scenarios. I&#39;ve used his desire to create sci-fi type &quot;inventions&quot; of <br/>
his own to teach him math (by way of mechanical drawing to design <br/>
things) and science (by way of the details he needs to create a <br/>
theoretically functioning &quot;invention&quot;). And I&#39;ve finally decided to <br/>
let him loose with his entrepreneur&#39;s bug and have hooked him up with <br/>
Young First Tuesday so that he can start a business of his own(which, <br/>
by the way, he has been bugging me about since he was 6!).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m nervous as all get out...  I&#39;m afraid he won&#39;t learn things <br/>
quickly enough. I&#39;m afraid he won&#39;t be able to keep up with others <br/>
when (if?) he goes back to school or when he goes to university. I&#39;m <br/>
worried sick that he will forever find ways to make a ten minute math <br/>
assignment take 3 hours. And so, here I am to learn from all of you <br/>
very wonderful and confident (or at least more experienced?) <br/>
homeschooling parents.  :) <br/>

<br/>
There ARE no ten minute math assignments in the real world.<br/>
If he&#39;s not in school let him be OUT of school, away from school, and let <br/>
school be out of and away from him.<br/>
<br/>
In the real world if it takes him a second or an hour to figure something out <br/>
it doesn&#39;t matter.  If he&#39;s always an hour guy, he just needs not to count <br/>
out change, or work where the cash register tells him what to give back and <br/>
spits the coins out.  <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry about how long it&#39;s taking him to do arithmetic, but I <br/>
*would* stop giving him math assignments.<br/>

you need to be able to do something in a given amount of time. There are <br/>
many times when the ability to focus even through a period devoid of <br/>
motivation is vital for success. While it is most important for my son to <br/>
learn the concepts in general so that he can do them, I believe that it is <br/>
also important for him to be able to function within the structure that <br/>
society provides when necessary. I think that it&#39;s about balance, not extremes.<br/>

&quot;Well, if he doesn&#39;t learn enough to fit into corporate culture or be an <br/>
independent business owner, he can take a minimum wage job at Burger King.&quot; <br/>
Burger jockeying may be wonderfully honest work, but it sure makes it a lot <br/>
more difficult to scrape the money together to raise a family. I&#39;ve been <br/>
poor. I don&#39;t want my kids to have to be poor for lack of the tools to <br/>
support themselves better.<br/>

I would think it would just be called eclectic or relaxed which is perfectly <br/>

also.  I think it also depends on what you mean by &quot;slip in&quot;. For instance I <br/>
purchased some colorful little workbooks for my kids and tossed them<br/>
on the table.  When the kids came home from a day in the water with<br/>
dad they were all over them, wanting to know who&#39;s is who&#39;s.  Next thing<br/>
I know my oldest is bored (which I figured she would be), but the two<br/>
younger ones are eating them up. Turns out I could only help one at a<br/>
time so older sister helped the youngest &lt;g&gt;.  Nice little benefit.  I do<br/>
not assign. I do not tell them they have to do it ever.  I suppose at some<br/>
point in life if they can&#39;t make exact change I might say, hey you know<br/>
this is something I think is going to be very important to you you might<br/>
really want to try learning this.  I might even say it more than once.  But<br/>
I think its the child&#39;s choice.  And I think the child will most often choose<br/>
knowledge.  (ps my kids have learned about money using money that<br/>
was just an example).  The workbooks were just something different <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-795004834">We are purchasing a curriculum even though we are unschooling for a similar<br/>
approach - my son needs some structure or else he is not controllable, and<br/>
he loves to sit down with me and figure out problems, color, do workbooks,<br/>
etc.  I think a curriculum was an easy way for me to have things he may be<br/>
interested in on hand and also a way for me to get new ideas on what to do<br/>
with him when he definitely is needing guidance...<br/>
<br/>
Now let me explain something though, my son is only 2 1/2 but is doing<br/>
Kindergarten work - he eats up anything we throw at him and is quite bright.<br/>
And we have some behavioral issues that is from a combination of his age<br/>
(terrible 2s!), him being gifted (he is incredibly intense), and his<br/>
need/desire to do things that are out of his capability in some way (ex: his<br/>
fine motor coordination is that of a 3 year olds, not of a kindergartener,<br/>
so he gets frustrated VERY easily on a lot of things).  He is, at least at<br/>
this age, a child who needs some structure, a predictable rhythm throughout<br/>
the day, and lots of cuddles and assurance or else he literally breaksdown<br/>
and bounces off the walls, screams and hits and throws and cannot control<br/>
his own actions, so this is something that works best for our situation.<br/>
I usually wait for him to initiate anything, unless I see him getting a<br/>
little out of control and needing help focus, then I direct him to<br/>
something.<br/>
I would not, however, insist on him learning anything.  If he gets bored or<br/>
doesn&#39;t like something, I simply offer other alternatives or let him think<br/>
of something else he&#39;d like to do.<br/>
But he is often jumping up and down asking if we can have &quot;worksheet time&quot; -<br/>
it is what he enjoys, at least for fifteen - thirty minutes at a time a few<br/>
times a day.<br/>
And I follow his interests.  If he&#39;s asking a lot aout garbage trucks or how<br/>
our car&#39;s engine works we run to the library or get online and see what we<br/>
can find, and incorporate that into our &quot;structure&quot; :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362982009">By assigning math worksheets/problem sets/textbook pages, enforcing their <br/>
completion, and lamenting his tardiness and lack of interest, you set math <br/>
apart from all the other things you don&#39;t assign and enforce. You set it <br/>
apart as something too tedious to learn from real life uses, or something <br/>
boring and uninteresting. Mathematics is way too interesting and exciting a <br/>
pursuit for me to destroy the joy of it by forcing it in unsuitable ways on <br/>
unwilling children. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about who owns the learning. As long as you&#39;re assigning the <br/>
task, it isn&#39;t unschooling, whether you&#39;re assigning math worksheets or <br/>
staring at the clouds time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102385620">Carrie, I love what you said about all or nothing.  This is my first year unscooling and to me it is the ability to choose what I think is neccessary at that time.  I am obviously no expert, but I have found a very real sence of self in the last few months, when it first occured to me that the most wonderful things in life do not come from textbooks and fire drills.  All of the pros kept flowing with few doubts at all.  I found all that I need to know on the message boards at unschooling.com and here in my mail box.  Oh, the fact that my hubbie loves the idea too really helps.  So all of that aside, I love most the idea that I CAN drill and &quot;test&quot; and give &quot;assignments&quot;  I CAN also deside what to drill and how.  I have quickly learned how to &quot;test&quot; for knowledge and if they are &quot;getting&quot; it.  I have also seen how they love to apply what they have learned in the &quot;real world&quot;.  They don&#39;t need to do it on paper or sitting down or even be in a quiet room.  Once they think they ha!<br/>
ve got it, I let go try it out.(ie. grocery shopping, going on ther own throught the store, reading signs and lables, finding all of the things on the list, counting all the way.  They feel so grown up and they act so grown up too.  They seeped the reward from searnig things that are boring in text books and run through quickly and catered only to one style of learning...the rarest kind.  I like to teach them and they (usually) like learning.  As soon as they get bored or aare too frustrated, then that lesson is over, and what to do next.  I ask them all day over and over, questions about what they did learn.  They get it down eventually.  I must say that in the last 3 months of (mostly summer break) my dd has moved up 2  &quot;reading levels&quot;  i don&#39;t really care much, but her teacher tried for 9 months and couldn&#39;t do it.  it sort of proves me right, YK?<br/>
<br/>
This has gotten way too long, but I am so excited about my new found adventure<br/>

I will go with that<br/>

&lt;&lt; I believe that being largely an unschooler...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you said &quot;largely...&quot; instead of just &quot;being an unschooler.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I like the vegetarian analogy.  There are a lot of people who say &quot;We are <br/>
largely vegetarian&quot; or &quot;we rarely eat meat&quot; but it isn&#39;t a religion for them. <br/>
 Total vegetarians are probably sorry for them that they&#39;re not getting the <br/>
maximum benefit, and wish they wouldn&#39;t say &quot;vegetarian&quot; just because they <br/>
only eat chicken and fish but avoid pork and beef.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am more than justified calling<br/>
myself an unschooler even though I occasionally (I don&#39;t know, once a<br/>
week, twice a week?) ask my kids to fill out a math sheet whenever they<br/>
feel like it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You are acting like an unschooler all but in that thing.<br/>
<br/>
But inside you there must be other doubts and scheduling situations, I&#39;m <br/>
thinking.  If you really believed children could and would learn all the <br/>
things they need, then you would not think to assign with a deadline a math <br/>
worksheet.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not justifying my calling myself an unschooler.  I&#39;m not being anything <br/>
else.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I can&#39;t be an unschooler???&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
SURE you can be!   As soon as you understand how assigning math can harm your <br/>
children&#39;s learning it their own way and with joy, you&#39;ll be one step closer <br/>
to being an unschooler instead of just justifying calling yourself an <br/>
unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Each of my kids has figured out his or her own way to do arithmetic as it <br/>
came along, and in their heads.  If you said &quot;Do you know your times tables?&quot; <br/>
you would get cow looks, but Kirby explained simply and quickly to some other <br/>
kids at the gaming shop last month how to multiply by 18 in your head, and <br/>
they got it and were glad.<br/>
<br/>
School doesn&#39;tids have figured out 6% (sales tax) in their heads since they <br/>
started getting allowance.  It&#39;s easy.  Doing it the written-out school way <br/>
is NOT easy.  They can figure tax, but the wouldn&#39;t be able to do that <br/>
worksheet right now.  Someday, maybe.  Someday, because they understand in <br/>
their gut what 6% means, and 30% (the discount Kirby&#39;s employment earns them <br/>
all at the gaming shop), they&#39;ll be able to plug those numbers into the <br/>
equation and see easily how to figure out 19.7 percent.<br/>
<br/>
But if they had had to learn the formula first, if I had TAUGHT them 6% in a <br/>
decimals way, or in a fractions-equation way, they would probably think they <br/>
did not know, nor were they smart enough to know, how to do that.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to be an engineer, it will probably be because math is easy <br/>
for him, because his mind and soul are full of patterns and causes and <br/>
effects.  So is all of nature.  So is all of every day.  Setting math <br/>
worksheets in the midst of all that will break up more patterns than it will <br/>
create.  And it will break up the pattern of his building his own, personal, <br/>
cool, workable model of the universe inside himself.  <br/>
<br/>
None of your kids are old enough to being studying engineering, but they&#39;re <br/>
all old enough for you to dampen their joy and to cause them to think math <br/>
isn&#39;t as fun as other things are.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;... but her teacher tried for 9 months and couldn&#39;t do it.  it sort of <br/>
proves me right, YK? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It might only prove she wasn&#39;t ready during those nine months and became <br/>
ready while you were &quot;teaching&quot; her (if you were).<br/>
<br/>
First year is full of awareness of what they would have been doing in school, <br/>
and while that probably never can go away totally, it can be stored in the <br/>
background with other school considerations (like what grade they would be <br/>
in, and how long til the end of the semester, and other constructs which <br/>
don&#39;t exist in nature).<br/>

<br/>
I will look into that book, thank you.   He does get a lot of rough play<br/>
though.  Wrestling with daddy, running and climbing at the park (daily),<br/>
crashing cars at home, dancing to music daily (until he collapses from<br/>
exhaustion! LOL), stuff like that.  His meltdowns aren&#39;t really forms of<br/>
aggression, I don&#39;t think.  I just don&#39;t think he knows how to get himself<br/>
back under control after he starts going downhill.  That and he would, 80%<br/>
of the time, prefer to sit and read than play actively.  He takes after his<br/>
father :)<br/>
<br/>
From my pediatrician and my research on his situation I followed the advice<br/>
of giving him things to do, to sit down with him and let him figure things<br/>
out, create things, read, etc, give him the extra stimulation he needs.  And<br/>
as for his intensity, that will always be there.  That extra sensitivity to<br/>
anything, and he just needs guidance on how to ground himself and come back<br/>
after something sets him off, and hopefully he&#39;ll learn as he grows to<br/>
control himself better.  Now I just hold him a lot, as he screams and kicks,<br/>
until the wave wears out and he is finally calm and thankful I was there to<br/>
hold him through a scary situation.<br/>

<br/>
My oldest is that way, and we taught him early on (maybe not as early as <br/>
three, though) to breathe deeply, hold it, let it out, breathe deeply... (and <br/>
that&#39;s often as much as it takes--two really deep breaths.<br/>
<br/>
My kids will say to each other and to me sometimes &quot;breathe.&quot;  <br/>
Stubbed toe?  &quot;Breathe.&quot;<br/>
Dropped a bowl of food and it&#39;s splattered all over the floor and cabinets <br/>
and refrigerator?  &quot;Breathe.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some things cause/create the breathing which bring the oxygen to settle the <br/>
biochemical storm.  Laughing.  Singing.  For some kids, maybe just sitting <br/>
still, or having mom hold them and breathe slowly herself.<br/>

talent in my first three children.  All started school<br/>
as (poor spellers but) very talented authors.  All won<br/>
awards for stories they wrote in first and second<br/>
grade - yet by 4th grade they hated anything to do<br/>
with writing - refused to read - and got failing or<br/>
near failing grades in Language Arts!)<br/>
Thanks in advance for anything you can tell me about<br/>
