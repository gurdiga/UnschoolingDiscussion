<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273703159">I am finding this thread very interesting.<br/>
It is an issue that I seem to struggle with a  lot.<br/>
We seem to have so much &#39;stuff&#39;<br/>
I don&#39;t have enough space or storage for it all. The result is<br/>
piles of &#39;stuff&#39; which make the place look more untidy and also<br/>
make it harder to clean or vacuum without a great big upheaval.<br/>
We have bags of dolls which the kids don&#39;t want to get rid of.<br/>
There are also other numerous toys which they intermittently play<br/>
with. We have about 7or 8 doll pushchairs and prams. 4 or 5<br/>
bikes. We have a similar number of Sylvanian family houses and<br/>
assorted buildings and lots of families and accessories for them.<br/>
Of course we also have craft projects, pet caterpillars, snails,<br/>
ant farm, books, books and more books and clothes, clothes and<br/>
more clothes!<br/>
In short I have got to the point where I don&#39;t feel that I can<br/>
make our house look  like a house anymore.<br/>
There is so much &#39;stuff&#39; in our living room that it is fairly<br/>
impossible to make it look neat, unless I stack it all behind the<br/>
sofa and then the kids can&#39;t play with their stuff.<br/>
We have a trailer caravan and awning erected in our back garden<br/>
and the children like to play in there.  A lot of the &#39;stuff&#39; is<br/>
out there at the moment.<br/>
The kitchen table is often covered in craft projects and when we<br/>
want to eat a meal, we are using the caravan at the moment. Once<br/>
the bad weather returns it will be a real problem if I don&#39;t do<br/>
something.<br/>
We have a small house and not enough bedrooms for the kids. 7yod<br/>
has a very small bedroom and 3yod has to share with me and dh.<br/>
19yod has just returned from university with LOTS of stuff and<br/>
has dumped out surplus which she doesn&#39;t want in her room but<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to throw out either!<br/>
On top of all this the kids don&#39;t go to sleep until about 11pm so<br/>
I don&#39;t get much time to clear up when they are asleep- I am too<br/>
tired out by then.<br/>
I enjoy being with my children but I do not enjoy our house at<br/>
the moment.<br/>
I daren&#39;t invite anyone in :o)<br/>
Sorry to go on like this in my first message!<br/>
thanks for listening.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765730102">Stella, we moved last year to a bigger house, with the same stuff <br/>
and we still don&#39;t have room!  The problem for us is while the <br/>
house has more rooms, there&#39;s less storage space :-(  You&#39;ve <br/>
probably heard this rant before &lt;g&gt;  Anyway, since the girls <br/>
decided to throw a load of their stuff away, rather than tidy it up <br/>
(it still involved picking everything up, go figure) we&#39;ve had more <br/>
space in the house, but two great sacks of stuff in the garage...  <br/>
Oh, for a freak act of nature to blow my house down and solve all <br/>
my problems &lt;big grin&gt;<br/>

<div><font color="#000080" size="2">Early in December, the kids and I go through 
their rooms, to give toys to kids that are less fortunate (in time for them to 
have something under their Christmas tree too, not after Christmas when it&#39;s too 
late).&nbsp; They know they are also getting rid of the toys they&#39;ve outgrown to 
make room for whatever they might get for Christmas. When they get a little too 
stingy, I set a limit - when we did stuffed animals, I let them keep two for 
every one they gave away.&nbsp; This got rid of 1/3 of the pile, 
anyway.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">We also have a summer camp and bring toys up 
there and leave them. When we arrived last month, it was like Christmas - all 
the toys they had left up here last year and forgotten about.&nbsp; We do the 
same with toys at grandma&#39;s</font><font color="#000080" size="2"> 
house.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">As for organizing what&#39;s left - I love wire 
drawers. We have them in my 6yo son&#39;s room, so he can see what&#39;s in each drawer 
without pulling everything out.&nbsp; He can pull the entire drawer out and put 
it on the floor, then load it back up when he&#39;s done. We have the same thing in 
the garage/playroom - last year my husband cleaned out the garage and put down 
indoor/outdoor carpet, and that became our &quot;project&quot; room. We have thousands of 
K&#39;nex, and I bought plastic drawers for those.&nbsp; Then against one wall I put 
all wire drawers (with a countertop over them) for all the bigger toys.&nbsp; It 
works pretty well.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">They also collect Playmobils - I have 5 folding 
card tables set up in the &quot;project&quot; room (garage) and they keep their &quot;Playmobil 
City&quot; there (up off the floor).</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">But alas, with 4 sets of grandparents, and 9 
sets of aunts and uncles, my kids STILL have too much stuff!</font></div>
