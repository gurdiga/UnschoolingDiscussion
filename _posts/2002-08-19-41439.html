On the subject of circuses and animal exploitation, I&#39;ve spent the summer trying to teach my dd (4) where her meals come from (she asks constantly &quot;what animal is this&quot; at each meal).  I&#39;m so strongly against Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) and I was working toward a simplified explanation of them for her.

 </span></blockquote>Hi Cathy!<br/>
<br/>
I first found out that there was such a thing as &quot;vegetarian&quot; when I was <br/>
13, but I didn&#39;t have the guts to cut out meat until I was 15.  I did a <br/>
tremendous amount of reading about it back then (at first it was an ethical <br/>
choice but later, after doing a lot of reading, I realized that it was a <br/>
big-time health issue also).  I took a lot of grief from my family back <br/>
then; they did not support me in my efforts and ribbed (no pun!) me quite a <br/>
bit.  But, I stuck to my guns (as your amazing daughter is doing), and I <br/>
never took another bite of meat.  It&#39;s been 30 years!  Now, my mother and <br/>
sister are adopting a vegetarian lifestyle to deal with serious health <br/>
issues they face.  I&#39;m honored and grateful to be able to be their &quot;coach.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You and your daughter can learn quite a bit about ethical vegetarianism, <br/>
but I would strongly recommend that you filter the information through you <br/>
rather than allowing her to discover this with you; there are some horrific <br/>
things that are done to animals in the farm industry.   Here are a couple <br/>
of web sites to get you started with dietary choices.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tryvegan.com/intro.php">http://www.tryvegan.com/intro.php</a> These folks offer a free vegan starter <br/>
kit, and they will be happy to mail it to you on request.  But you can also <br/>
view it online in its entirety.<br/>

<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.veganoutreach.org/starterpack/recipes.html">http://www.veganoutreach.org/starterpack/recipes.html</a>  (this page has a <br/>
bunch of great recipes and also an article entitled &quot;Do You Really Need a <br/>
Recipe?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is a ton of information out there, and these links are a good place <br/>
to start.  Other folks will probably have a lot more information, too.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-589595012">Dear Kathy,<br/>
<br/>
I have a great cookbook called &quot;Something for<br/>
Everyone&quot; bt Carol Gelles, that gives 150 recipes,<br/>
each of which is a basic dish with a variation for<br/>
meat-eaters and vegetarians, so you don&#39;t have to cook<br/>
more than one dish. It&#39;s pretty cool!<br/>

 Questions to her: <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; where are you finding recipes?  How are you<br/>
&gt; explaining nutritional needs?  And is the rest of<br/>
&gt; your family omnivorous?  If so, how are you handling<br/>
&gt; meals?  <br/>

&gt;meals?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve cooked for a mixed family.  We had lots of vegetarian meals.  I made <br/>
chili and tacos and spaghetti without meat.  Or I cooked meat separately <br/>
and the ones who wanted it could throw some in.  It&#39;s a bit harder to do <br/>
casseroles, but my guys don&#39;t like them much anyway.  If you cook the <br/>
traditional meat potatoes and vegies, you can just offer something like <br/>
cottage cheese or a tofu shake or something for the protein.<br/>
