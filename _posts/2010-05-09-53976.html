<div id="ygrps-yiv-755091571">I was wondering if anyone could direct me to some links regarding two specific things. I am having an online discussion and I would prefer to provide links as opposed to writing my *personal* perspective on this one. I know how I feel and what I want to say but I think it would be much more well-received from some experts. The blogger takes things from me a little too personally. I looked on Sandra Dodd&#39;s site but didn&#39;t see anything specific, although I&#39;m sure it&#39;s there. <br/>
