How old are your children?<br/>
Do you have a teenaged boy?<br/>
<br/>
When one of them has sex will you lie about it or accept it?<br/>
How will it look in practical terms when you do not &quot;tolerate&quot; it?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m willing to discuss it further if you answer those questions for me.<br/>

<br/>
What does that mean, would not be &quot;tolerated?&quot;  Exactly, how are you going<br/>
to do anything BUT tolerate it, unless you plan on kicking the kid out or<br/>
locking them up in their room?<br/>
<br/>
Sandra posted that she talked with him about the possible consequences, that<br/>
she talked to him about protecting himself.  Kirby, although I only know him<br/>
&quot;virtually&quot; through email with his mom, appears to have been working to make<br/>
an informed choice on how to handle his very natural urges.  He is a teen<br/>
after all, not a child.<br/>
<br/>
I was engaging in sexual behavior by the time I was Kirby&#39;s age.  But I knew<br/>
how pregnancy occurred, so I didn&#39;t have intercourse until I was 19 and<br/>
engaged.  Didn&#39;t lead to promiscuity....I&#39;ve only engaged in sexual activity<br/>
with 3 men....and only one for the last 20 years &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-marital sex can be a &quot;not so terrible&quot; thing provided people have access<br/>
to information.  Uninformed sex of any kind can be a disaster.<br/>
<br/>
I guess Sandra could have screeched at Kirby or grounded him or had him read<br/>
Bible verses about how he will go to hell for it.......the most that would<br/>
accomplish is that he will simply be sneakier about it next time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941174600">There was a time when teens would be married and living their own lives, were considered young adults with all correlating responsibilities. <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Teen&quot; is a modern concept, and one artificially invented in post-industrial revolutionary times in part to help people to accept the continued indoctrination of children of immigrants into American society. By labeling young adults as children, they could then be forced to stay in the school system until their indoctrination into our values and belief systems was completed, regardless of their natural abilities and inclinations towards other things. <br/>
 <br/>
The biological impulses that occur with puberty occur without regards to our modern concept of &quot;teenagers.&quot; It&#39;s not wrong per se for them to be fulfilling those desires. They will do it irregardless of our desires for their lives. Either they do it behind our backs, and in riskier ways both physically and mentally; or we teach them to take care of themselves, and let them know that while we may not agree with their decision to be sexually active, it is THEIR decision and not ours. We can encourage them to be responsible in their decisions by pointing out to them things they might not have thought about in regards to their physical and/or emotional health, and let them know that we will be there to help them to sort out any physical and/or emotional repercussions. <br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s alot better than freaking out and risk losing your children&#39;s love and respect for you because of a decision they make. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
And it&#39;s not like I went to Kirby and said &quot;Seems maybe this happened.  GOOD <br/>
IDEA!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And as of December 2003, he is not &quot;sexually active.&quot;  He might have lost his <br/>
virginity nearly a year ago, or possibly not quite.  If that had awakened a <br/>
crazy urge in him, he has opportunity, female friends, a driver&#39;s license, all <br/>
of that.  Yet he doesn&#39;t maintain much flirtation.  He went out a couple of t<br/>
imes (not date-like, high school &quot;date&quot; style, but to a movie, to eat, to hang <br/>
out) with a girl who has made clear for years that any time Kirby wants a girl <br/>
friend and doesn&#39;t have one she wants the job.   He went to her apartment, <br/>
where she was living alone.  They watched a movie and he drove home.  She came <br/>
too, in her car, because he wanted to bring the van back ( I didn&#39;t make him, <br/>
nor even call a time he should be home), but they still wanted to hang out.  <br/>
They hung out at our house, lots of lights on, playing board games or cards with <br/>
Holly.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the most recent date of a teenager at my house.  Not &quot;sexual activity.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&quot;Teen&quot; is a modern concept, and one artificially invented in <br/>
post-industrial revolutionary times ....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In a way, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
But in Europe the ages 18 (in France) and 21 (in England) have had <br/>
significance in the past as the ages at which young men who were destined to be knights <br/>
were knighted.  So the idea of those birthdays as hallmarks of something or <br/>
other are not new.<br/>
<br/>
And as to marriage, there are also periods in history in which girls didn&#39;t <br/>
marry boys their own age.  Teenaged girls &quot;of society&quot; more likely married <br/>
older men (late 20&#39;s, 30&#39;s) who had finished their education, had their business <br/>
steadily going, and had a house.<br/>
<br/>
Among other classes, teenagers might be off and running at their own <br/>
apprenticeships or real work long before 18.  They were sailors or bakers or whatever, <br/>
at least at apprentice level, whether for their dads or someone who would <br/>
take them to train them (to have cheap labor) and that was the end of their being <br/>
at home with their parents.  Fourteen or fifteen years old.<br/>
<br/>
I still think the suggestion that parents who allow kids to play &quot;violent <br/>
video games&quot; are inviting or condoning &quot;extreme behavior&quot; sounds like the <br/>
suggestion of a mother with little children, not teens.   <br/>

okay, in spite of my efforts ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I look at parents who have one or maybe two very<br/>
little children who are trying so hard to teach them<br/>
and train them and I smile remembering I was like that<br/>
too, and hopefully I can talk to them and reassure<br/>
them that they can relax and enjoy them.  Sometimes<br/>

<br/>
I am very curious as to how this seems like a contradiction to you. I don&#39;t<br/>
see sex as extreme behavior at all. At least not in the the way Sandra<br/>
explained it. Now a teen having sex with multiple partners consistently is,<br/>
imo, extreme behavior. That&#39;s when one should take great measures in helping<br/>
the teen with the motive behind that behavior. Taking a &quot;not tolerated&quot;<br/>
stance is not going to help that person find what it is they are really<br/>
looking for.<br/>
<br/>
If a teenager has a girlfriend and thinks about having sex with her, and is<br/>
knowledgeable about all the facts, how can having sex with her be an<br/>
intolerable choice to make? Whether he keeps on seeing her or decides he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to anymore? And is there an age where sex for your teen would<br/>
be okay? Or is it just marriage that makes it alright? And on that note,<br/>
does one need to not live at home, be engaged or married, and is married<br/>
young still an okay so they can have sex?<br/>

<br/>
Anyone feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong. I dont know of any unschooled<br/>
kids under 14 that have the desire to be having sex. I see unschooled kids<br/>
as being so mature and responsible that they don&#39;t fall into the trappings<br/>
of what is acceptable and when as far as how other kids feel about wearing<br/>
certain fashions, having sex, trying drugs, etc. The fascination just isn&#39;t<br/>
there. When parents and children can talk openly about all those things, and<br/>
there is no taboo and rules of &quot;you absolutely can not,&quot; the wants just<br/>
aren&#39;t the same as with schooled kids.<br/>

We just went to Target. I was looking for long pants to fit them. I know the<br/>
cold weather will hit and they will pantless! They also wanted gloves.<br/>
Anyway, even though the store was crowded, we all managed well. We had a<br/>
good time. So we go to check out and Joseph wanted to see the YuGiOh cards<br/>
which are right by a check out lane. One guy came by with his cart and just<br/>
yelled at the kids to get out of the way yelling to them &quot;kids, move, c&#39;mon<br/>
you kids, get out of the way!&quot; Well it didn&#39;t take but a second for me to<br/>
tell him that wasn&#39;t a very nice way to say excuse me along with a look that<br/>
would kill. I know I used the word rude in there somewhere too. His wife<br/>
sheepishly followed behind him and apologized to me and the kids. Then when<br/>
we were checking out, the check out lady in the next aisle commented about<br/>
Alyssa wanting candy. I asked Alyssa that didn&#39;t she still have the Nestle<br/>
crunch she got the other day. She ate about half. The lady told me to eat it<br/>
myself and then she&#39;ll not leave it next time. Yeah lady, that&#39;s a good<br/>
idea. So I was saying candy is no big deal in our house as it&#39;s always there<br/>
and they have no need to eat it all. Then she started on about how she<br/>
doesn&#39;t allow her son any candy at all. She said that she was severely<br/>
restictive with him. This is the same lady who told me to eat my kids<br/>
candy!!!! Well I had some words for her, I wasn&#39;t nasty but not really nice.<br/>
She pissed me off by butting in on whether my kids should have candy or not.<br/>
I guess maybe that&#39;s abusive in her eyes. After telling Joe he said he&#39;s<br/>
going to have to keep me at home from now, I start trouble when I go out!!!!<br/>
I feel bad for a lot of kids out there.<br/>

Anyone feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong. I dont know of any unschooled<br/>

I do know a family of unschooled children who fit into that category.  They <br/>
were most certainly unschooled, but not well.  Not enough parent involvement <br/>
from what I saw.  Lots of time alone to explore which isn&#39;t all bad, but <br/>
certainly can be if like anything else extreme enough.<br/>

They are the only unschoolers that I know in real life that are like this.  <br/>
They have two boys one girl, all three VERY promiscuous in many ways.<br/>

I know MANY more schooled kids that behave like this though, even 11 year <br/>

No, it&#39;s not.  In many cultures, people don&#39;t shake hands. <br/>
In THIS culture women didn&#39;t shake hands until within the last hundred and <br/>
fifty years or so.  So shaking hands is NOT a natural human behavior; it&#39;s <br/>
cultural.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&quot;Everyone&quot; is NOT &quot;doing it&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Nobody&#39;s advocating teens having sex.<br/>

<br/>
Getting back to unschooling philosophy, what do the children want?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand why celibate is &#39;better&#39; than sexually active, either.<br/>
Safer perhaps, but not necessarily better.  Never letting kids ride in a car<br/>
is safer, but not necessarily better.  Never letting the kids out of your<br/>
sight is safer, but not necessarily better.<br/>
<br/>
As with most things, I think it depends on the kid, the situation, etc..  I<br/>
am surprised to find unschoolers with such a black and white interpretation,<br/>
to be honest.<br/>

So I&#39;m hoping I can do a well enough job of parenting that my kids will realize this themselves by the time they begin to think of it. I don&#39;t want my teenager thinking her/his body is under anyone else&#39;s control, even mine.<br/>
  Great sex? I want that myself. Sex is sometimes little more than a hug, sometimes a gift, sometimes great...sometimes barely worth mentioning...even in the middle of a loving relationship. Sex is no one thing and I find it and it&#39;s meaning change a lot within a relationship. In fact I have no aspirations for the quality of my kids sex, simply that it happens within a respectful, loving relationship. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432055602">All this talk about teens and sex....quite interesting. Do parents REALLY believe they can control these human beings that have been in their care? REally?<br/>
We can guide, we can mentor, we can advise and assist and model....in the end we do not, can not control another human being. Those that believe they can are lying to themselves. And control by fear is the very least effective long term...oh, it seems to work, but all it does is create less communication and more sneakiness.<br/>
<br/>
My mother talked very openly about sex, to a point. She also said that she hoped we would wait for marriage to begin a sexual relationship but if we didn&#39;t, she hoped we would use birth control. Knowing how they felt about other topics made us QUITE sure there was no way in hell we could admit we were having sex to them. They shut down effective communication quite well, and yet believed their kids could talk to them about anything. PPPFFFTTT! Yeah, right.<br/>
<br/>
I had sex with two different partners in High school, both of whom I cared deeply for. I was pregnant with Trevor when dh and I got married (I was 20) and never told them until we had moved far away and the wedding was long over. Sad. That&#39;s what happens when parents are not calm and contemplative and non-reactionary over their children&#39;s behavior. <br/>
<br/>
The fact that someone is using the term &quot;rebellious&quot; tells me a lot about parenting style. My children don&#39;t need to &quot;rebel&quot;, they do need to be themselves though. If I&#39;m not setting up our lives to where I&#39;m being their adversary, or trying to control them, what is there to rebel against? They speak their minds, sometimes we disagree, but as far as extreme behavior...why? Why would they need to do something extreme? And I don&#39;t see sex as extreme, I see certain behaviors as extreme. <br/>
In medieval times, in certain cultures, 14y.o. girls were getting married. THere are cultures today in which it is common for teen girls to get married, have sex and have babies. So is it truly extreme and dangerous for teens to have sex? Or is it partly culture, partly religion that views this as extreme? I think healthy attitudes towards sex and a good heap of self confidence are more important than WHEN sex begins.<br/>

<br/>
I think those are legitimate questions for people to consider on their own <br/>
(meaning I&#39;m not asking for the answers from people &lt;g&gt;).   I&#39;ve heard a whole <br/>
range of beliefs, and I think everyone here is aware there&#39;s a whole range.<br/>
<br/>
So given that, maybe we&#39;re asking the wrong questions, or not turning our <br/>
object/idea around to see it from enough different angles.<br/>
<br/>
Getting married can be dangerous.<br/>
Getting married can be more &quot;extreme&quot; a behavior than having pre-marital sex. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My dad was married four times, basically because he wouldn&#39;t have sex outside <br/>
of marriage.   Some people (himself included) considered that more moral than <br/>
the four-year relationship I was in from 17 to 20, because I didn&#39;t get <br/>
married.  That relationship lasted longer than two of my dad&#39;s marriages.  (And we <br/>
stayed in contact for several years, considering getting back together.  Then <br/>
after almost 20 years of loss of contact, he called me last year and so my <br/>
follow-up was better than my dad&#39;s too.)<br/>
<br/>
There are violent spouses, dishonest ones, gold-digging spouses, murderous <br/>
spouses.  Dangerous, getting married.  You could end up with children who are <br/>
half made of the genetic material of someone who is dishonest and violent.   I <br/>
think that has happened WAY more times than people have contracted a deadly <br/>
disease from sex.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going through some questioning of some of my Christian beliefs, <br/>
and one thing that bothers me is the fear. I hate making decisions <br/>
based on fear, but the fear is still there.  Not so much fear for <br/>
myself (&#39;Cause I was raised with the &quot;once saved always saved&quot; <br/>
belief, but for my kids.  I SO want to do everything right for them <br/>
and what if through my questioning and doubting I make a wrong choice <br/>
that ends up with me not leading them toward a decision that ends <br/>
them up in hell. <br/>
