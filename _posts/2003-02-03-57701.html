<br/>
Bring a sheet or blanket you don&#39;t mind getting dirty.<br/>
<br/>
The boys pretend to be frogs hopping around the sheet/lilly pad<br/>
<br/>
When the music turns off all the frogs jump on the pad.<br/>
<br/>
Then frogs get off and the lilly pad/sheet gets smaller<br/>
<br/>
The sheet lilly pad gets smaller and smaller until the kids/frogs have <br/>
to get really cooperative to stay on the sheet/lilly pad<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some kind of animal forms game you whisper an animal to one kid and he <br/>
trys to imitate it and the other kids guess what it is?<br/>

<br/>
Dead lions.<br/>
<br/>
We used to call it dead pirates, because we first played it at a pirate <br/>
party.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone plays asleep, lying on the floor.  One is it and can stand up and <br/>
walk (but not touch) and say funny thing.  Any who laugh are up too, and they <br/>
can speak but not touch.  The last one still and unlaughing is it next.<br/>
<br/>
LITTLE cupcakes (if you have a miniature muffin pan).<br/>
<br/>
Pin the wings on the fly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-816724532">Charades<br/>
 <br/>
I Packed My Bag:  1st player says, &quot;I packed my bag and in it I put a<br/>
_____&quot;.  Next player says, &quot;I packed my bag and in it I put a (what 1st<br/>
person said) and a ______&quot;.  Each player adds a new item.  Any player<br/>
who can&#39;t remember the list is out of the game.<br/>
 <br/>
What Are You Doing?:  Player 1 pretends to be doing something, for<br/>
example reading a book.  Player 2 says, &quot;Excuse me, what are you<br/>
doing?&quot;.  Player one says something that has nothing to do with the<br/>
action he&#39;s doing (for example, &quot;I&#39;m riding my bike&quot;).  Player two<br/>
pretends to be riding a bike.  Player three says, &quot;Excuse me, what are<br/>
you doing?&quot;, etc.  This makes us laugh hysterically for some reason :0).<br/>
 <br/>
Magazine Scavenger Hunt:  Teams of two look for listed items in<br/>
magazines for a set amount of time.  Team who finds the most wins.<br/>
 <br/>
Memory:  Spread objects on a tray and cover it with a towel.  Remove the<br/>
towel for a minute and then have each player list what they can<br/>
remember.<br/>
 <br/>
Musical Chairs<br/>
 <br/>
Odd Bean:  Each player gets 12 dried beans.   The first player hides a<br/>
number of beans in one fist and asks the next player, &quot;Odds or evens?&quot;.<br/>
If the next player guesses correctly, he collects those beans from the<br/>
first player.  If the guess is wrong, the second player must forfeit the<br/>
same number of beans to the first player.  Any player to lose all of his<br/>
beans drops out of the game.  The winner is the player with the most<br/>
beans at the end of a given time period, or the player who has collected<br/>
all the beans.<br/>
 <br/>
Tongue Twisters:  Truly rural; toy boat, lemon linament; red leather,<br/>
yellow leather; she sells seashells by the seashore; whistle for the<br/>
thistle sifter; six thick thistle sticks; the bootblack brought the<br/>
black boot back; the sixth sheik&#39;s sixth sheep&#39;s sick; Sarah sits by six<br/>
sick city slickers; fresh flesh of fresh fried fish<br/>
 <br/>
Twenty Questions<br/>
 <br/>
A great book for this kind of thing is Hopscotch, Hangman, Hot Potato &<br/>
HaHaHa by Jack Maguire.  Have fun!  ~Rue <br/>

The boys will love this! Give them each 3 Saltine crackers. On your mark<br/>
get set go! They have to eat the crackers and first person who is able to<br/>
sing &quot;It&#39;s a Very, Merry Unbirthday To You, To You!&quot; audibly is the<br/>
winner. Beware, the crumbs fly!<br/>
