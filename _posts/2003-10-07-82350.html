The Age of Consent for heterosexual activity is 16 in Australia as I<br/>
recall, and I guess from your remark in UK also. However in the USA it<br/>
varies from State to State, and with or without parental consent, and<br/>
seems to be mostly 16 or 17 or 18. Young as 14 with parental consent in<br/>
some places. Homosexual varies from &quot;illegal&quot; to 18 to 21. I found<br/>
charts about worldwide ages when I Googled. <br/>
Those ages are not different anymore after the Supreme Court ruling. It also <br/>
applied to that, according to attorneys I know.<br/>
