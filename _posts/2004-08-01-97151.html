&lt;&lt; All men weren&#39;t, in fact, created equal.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Still aren&#39;t, never could be.<br/>
<br/>
The best they can hope for is equality under the law. But even then, when <br/>
Kirby went to court he was dismissed to go home by a clerk, without even having <br/>
to stand up in front of the judge.   Why?  Because he was anglo, some would <br/>
say, without hesitation, I bet.   There were only two other anglos in that batch <br/>
of 30 some people at traffic court that day, the rest were hispanic.   But <br/>
Kirby was dismissed because his offense was small (forgot to turn his headlights <br/>
on, crossing a street going three blocks from home), and...  He wore dress <br/>
pants, a shirt and a tie.  Nobody else came close.  They dressed like they were <br/>
dressing to work in the yard or stand on a street corner and see and be seen <br/>
(the young girls, short sleeveless tops over low hiphugger jeans as though the <br/>
summons had said &quot;Please, dress in crop tops and hiphuggers&quot; instead of <br/>
&quot;appropriate dress is required&quot; or whatever it said.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
Just a little respect goes a long way in legal situations.<br/>
<br/>
But even before that, some are born smart, rich and good looking.  Some are <br/>
born base and mean, in the Shakespearean-era sense.  Poor, angry, bad genetics. <br/>
   Those things aren&#39;t equal.<br/>
<br/>
A 5&#39;4&quot; man will have to have more charisma, skills, and desire to succeed <br/>
than a 6&#39;, broad-shouldered, pleasant-faced man of lesser intelligence and <br/>
ability.  Does that make the other humans around them horribly ignorant and <br/>
prejudiced?<br/>
<br/>
There are instincts beyond reason.   There are biological impulses, and if we <br/>
deny them entirely (as some people pressed others to do for a long LONG time <br/>
in this culture, claiming humans possessed no instincts) we pretend to live <br/>
instead of living our own real lives from our own real selves.<br/>
<br/>
-=- For me rights and respect need to be<br/>
<br/>
mutual. I don&#39;t feel my kids gain anything by learning that they can coerce<br/>
<br/>
those around them because no one will step in to coerce them out of it. I&#39;m<br/>
<br/>
much more of a &quot;your right to extend your fist stops at my face&quot; kind of<br/>
<br/>
person.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Me too.  But I want their fist quite out of my personal space, so that I <br/>
don&#39;t even flinch.<br/>
<br/>
If we think we shouldn&#39;t be coercive or bullying, how can we condone bullying <br/>
in, of or among our children?  The principle that coercion isn&#39;t right would <br/>
(for me, in the logic that has worked for me)  mean that as a parent I should <br/>
try to rid my home of coercive elements, and if one of my children were become <br/>
a really excellent spin-doctor/politician/leader/dictator, I would (and this <br/>
is not theoretical in our family) counsel him/her on benevolence and <br/>
generosity and not hogging the air.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t try to extinguish the behaviors, just refine them.  Those might be <br/>
what takes that child far in life, when they&#39;re in an appropriate venue and <br/>
channelled for good.<br/>
<br/>
Most people are followers, not leaders.  They want to think for themselves <br/>
only insofar as they can choose their own leader to follow blindly.<br/>
<br/>
Not all are born leaders, and so not all are created equal.<br/>
<br/>
But mythology (and the U.S. is steeped in eagle/flag/frontier/cowboy <br/>
mythology) has its uses and its own realities, and destroying it completely is as bad <br/>
as believing it all to be objective reality.<br/>
