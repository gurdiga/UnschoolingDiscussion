<div id="ygrps-yiv-637164456">My family and I live in Ohio, and we are unschooling our 8 year old. <br/>
We have a 6 year old who attends an alternative school (informal) and <br/>
loves it.  My husband is a computer animator and, after ruling the <br/>
possibility out for a long time, I am wondering if we really should <br/>
seriously consider having him start looking for work outside of Ohio.<br/>
That thought scares the crud out of me, because it took so much <br/>
effort to get everything in place that we have here--homeschooling <br/>
notification, funding for services for the homeschooled child who <br/>
also has Asperger&#39;s syndrome, the actual services (social skills <br/>
group, music therapy, occupational therapy).<br/>
<br/>
I tend to be the one who does all of the planning and paperwork, or <br/>
at least coordinates it, and it would be putting it mildly to say <br/>
that it is not my favorite activity.  The thought of starting from <br/>
scratch is quite overwhelming.  But with the trouble we have had <br/>
finding employment here--especially finding my husband work in his <br/>
field--it seems like we need to be open to some different <br/>
possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
*Any* information any of you can pass along about homeschooling in <br/>
California, how simple or complicated the regulations are, and <br/>
especially if you know anything about the Asperger&#39;s issue and <br/>
services we might be able to apply for, would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226717130">There are several legal options for homeschooling in California.  I would<br/>
suggest looking at the California Homeschool Network website at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.californiahomeschool.net/">http://www.californiahomeschool.net/</a>  This group is a statewide group and<br/>
has all kinds of homeschoolers from the &quot;school at home&quot; to &quot;unschooling&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As for the help with Asperger&#39;s I don&#39;t know how that works.  My nephews<br/>
have Asperger&#39;s, but they are in OR and I only know what they can get for<br/>
them there.  I&#39;m sure however, if you make contact with CHN that they can<br/>
help you with this issue.<br/>
<br/>
Just for your information I file a Private School Affidavit, which has very<br/>
little paperwork involved and no testing is required.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-96218817">Hi --<br/>
<br/>
I belong to a very unschooling-friendly state support group in CA called<br/>
HSC.<br/>
<br/>
On their website, at www.hsc.org , there is a detailed section about<br/>
homeschooling in California titled &quot;From Chaos to Confidence&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you are forewarned that housing prices in the larger California<br/>
cities are insanely expensive.  That means almost no houses in LA, SF or<br/>
Silicon Valley that cost less than 400,000, unless they are seriously<br/>
slummy.  (But if interest rates keep coming down, maybe the payment on that<br/>
will be affordable.)<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can work something out!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377683839">Along those lines, lots of the small town areas are much more<br/>
unschooling/homeschooling friendly AND you won&#39;t have to hock all your<br/>
children to buy a home &lt;g&gt;  Brand new houses on 1/4 acre lots with between<br/>
2500 and 3000 sq ft are going to about $189,000 and &quot;used&quot; &lt;g&gt; houses are<br/>
going from $59,000 and up with lots of owner financing.<br/>
<br/>
Up here in &quot;real&quot; &lt;g&gt; northern CA we have only once been asked any of those<br/>
snippy off the wall questions that so many other folks seem to have gotten,<br/>
the local school district has phone numbers for homeschooling support groups<br/>
and there are 2 or 3 charters if you need to go with a program that provides<br/>
you with special classes.<br/>
