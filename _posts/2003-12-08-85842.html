 </span></blockquote>This is kind of funny to me, because I go to a fundie<br/>
Christian church, and used to listen to the quiverful<br/>
conversations and feel bad because we only had two (at<br/>
the time), but not from lack of trying.  (My third<br/>
child was born 7 years after my second, and he has<br/>
been my total joy because I had been told I<br/>
couldn&#39;thave any more.)<br/>
<br/>
I was told that sin in my life kept me from having<br/>
more children, or told in a patronizing way, &quot;well,<br/>
dear, God only gives us just what we can handle...&quot; as<br/>
if I weren&#39;t as capable of these other mothers of<br/>
handling more children.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the reason this is amusing to me is that now<br/>
that these women are approaching or just past 40,<br/>
suddenly all the husbands seem to be getting<br/>
vasectomies.  They suddenly have a &quot;peace&quot; about not<br/>
having any more children.  Yes, some of them have<br/>
anwhere from 3 to 8 children, and one family has<br/>
10...but the husbands are all getting snipped, and it<br/>
didn&#39;t have to do with how many children they have but<br/>
how the moms were getting close to 40 and deciding<br/>
they were through.<br/>
