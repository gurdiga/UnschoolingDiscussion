<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747148616">Hi,<br/>
Have your children had to deal with serious illness?  Buzz, I know yours <br/>
have.  How did they cope?  Do you think it has shaped them in any way?  <br/>
<br/>
My lupus is flaring right now and I just can&#39;t do all the things I normally <br/>
do.  The kids are somewhat frustrated when I can&#39;t jump right up and join <br/>
them in work or play.  I am forgetful (I just found the salad from last <br/>
night&#39;s dinner in a plastic bag in the drawer with the paper clips and <br/>
stuff), and my mind loses a lot of its agility. It takes me a while to find <br/>
the words I&#39;m looking for.  I can&#39;t run up and down the stairs everytime they <br/>
need help with something.  Sometimes I worry that the children will think I&#39;m <br/>
a couple of nuggets shy of a happy meal.  Am I an embarrassment to them?  <br/>
Will I be as they get older?  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, has my illness taught them compassion, perserverance, <br/>
endurance, and faith?  Our 3 month old baby daughter was in the hospital all <br/>
week with RSV.  The boys are so accustomed to my illness that they weren&#39;t <br/>
frightened for her at all.  She came home yesterday and the boys help me by <br/>
giving her the breathing treatments.  I don&#39;t envision that being &quot;normal&quot; <br/>
for most 8 and 5 year olds.  Does that mean that they have been strengthened <br/>
and tempered by their experience with illness?  Are they better for it?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts.  This has been zinging around in my mind for <br/>
the last few days and it&#39;s cathartic to write it down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030699034">I&#39;m a walking medical mess from kidney problems to a weird hip problem<br/>
which means I don&#39;t walk too much and sometimes I fall without any warning.<br/>
 All the kidlets are pretty good about it and none seem the least bit<br/>
embarassed even though one is a preteen and one is 16 (he still gives mummy<br/>
a kiss and a hug good-bye no matter where we are, even in front of all his<br/>
friends at the mall).  Youngest kidlet (7) is designing me a special<br/>
wheelchair (purple, of course &lt;g&gt; and with lots of special pockets and sand<br/>
tires, would you believe?) so we can go and do more things.  Occasionally<br/>
they forget or they get frustrated but they quickly get over it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-161841434">Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
   When I fought my battle with breast cancer 2 1/2 years ago, my son had <br/>
just turned seven.  I went through two surgeries and six months of weekly <br/>
chemotherapy, which wasn&#39;t fun to say the least.  My son was incredible.  We <br/>
gently led him along the path with us, and he knew everything that was going <br/>
on.  He called me &quot;the droid&quot; when I had three drainage tubes coming out of <br/>
my body.  Those tubes had to be drained and the liquid measured twice a day, <br/>
and my son watched my husband handled that disgusting process with such love <br/>
and tenderness.  It was an invaluable experience for him.<br/>
<br/>
   I was pretty sick from the chemo, but we kept homeschooling.  Sometimes <br/>
all we could manage was snuggling together in bed and reading wonderful <br/>
&quot;living&quot; books, but it was enough.  I remember one night when we prayed <br/>
before dinner.  We have a standard prayer that we say every night, but on <br/>
this night Colton wanted to pray something different.  He prayed that I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t become extinct like the dinosaurs, and I was very touched by that.  <br/>
It opened the door for a wonderful conversation where we talked about <br/>
fighting cancer and the beauty of appreciating each moment.<br/>
<br/>
   My cancer was a gift, because we all have a heightened appreciation of <br/>
what is truly important.  This life is indeed fleeting and fragile, and I <br/>
have resolved to live and love recklessly because I don&#39;t know how long I <br/>
have.  It&#39;s a lesson that I have taught my son, and we are all the better for <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34592221">Hi, I too have an auto-immune disease ( Rheumatoid Arthritis) which I firmly<br/>
believe is caused my the emotional neglect and abuse I suffered as a child.<br/>
My kids are wonderful about it. They will often ask to help, and they take very<br/>
good care of me!!!!<br/>
They would rather not go somewhere exciting if they thought the driving there<br/>
would make me sore, in fact Anna was in tears one time with worry for me!<br/>
Sometimes I wonder though if that is just too much for a six year old and I<br/>
really worry sometimes if that will cause some sort of negative outcome in my<br/>
daughters lives. On the other hand the girls are filled with compassion for<br/>
everyone that is hurting and they seem to have developed without the typical<br/>
egocentric behaviour I see in kids their own age. (mostly &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
I also worry about how this affects my friendships with others. This is one<br/>
reason why I don&#39;t get involved as much as I should with our local support group<br/>
as I can&#39;t always commit to things and<br/>
sometimes show up and sometimes don&#39;t. I wonder what they think! :o)<br/>
Katie and Anna don&#39;t seem to be suffer embarrassement from my illness - yet, but<br/>
the other day I broke down crying in public over a seperate situation and Anna<br/>
was mortified!! She said afterwards she pretended not to know me. Hopefully<br/>
though we will through avoiding alot of revolting peer pressure etc, be able to<br/>
help them grow even more in compassion and kindness and an ability to see the<br/>
&#39;person&#39; inside. So yes - I think I can say my illness is shapING my kids for<br/>
good! YAH!!<br/>
As for me.....it is a continual struggle, but sometimes I hate to think of what<br/>
type of person I would be without it. Weird huh?! Maybe* I* would lack<br/>
compassion? :o)<br/>
It is nice (and sad)  to know I&#39;m not the only homeschooling mum who has to cope<br/>
with these things.<br/>
<br/>
Wow this post got long! OOPS.<br/>
Michele.<br/>
NZ. It is hot!<br/>

earlier. My mom had been in the hospital almost 7 months after open heart<br/>
surgery (she had had rheumatic fever as a child and had severe valve<br/>
damage). My children learned a lot about compassion, love, difficult<br/>
decisions, and pain, too.  These were lessons of the heart.   Would that it<br/>
had not happened, but since it did, i feel blessed to have shared it.<br/>

<br/>
Buzz,  I have the exact same thing with my lupus.  Because my lupus causes <br/>
inflammation and scarring in the central nervous system, it mimics MS very, <br/>
very closely.  I know EXACTLY what you&#39;re talking about.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got this too.  In fact, optic neuritis is one of my most frequent <br/>
problems.  I&#39;ve just finished a course of steroids to treat the most recent <br/>
bout of it.  My vision didn&#39;t return to normal this time, which is <br/>
frightening to me.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;and I passed a  kidney stone last week&gt;&gt;<br/>
OK, now I&#39;m laughing WITH you, not AT you!  I also currently have a kidney <br/>
stone (also my third round with them).  Are we sure that we were not <br/>
separated at birth?  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, I&#39;ve got the boot camp hairdo again.  It&#39;s been falling out in huge <br/>
chunks since Josephine was born and I couldn&#39;t stand having one more chunk <br/>
plop into my breakfast cereal.  I got out the clippers and - VOILA!  Actually <br/>
I love it, although it isn&#39;t terribly slimming...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your response.  It&#39;s a comfort just to be reminded that others <br/>
have gone through the same thing.  I&#39;m glad your kids are largely OK with the <br/>
whole thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids are pretty good about it now. The oldest (14) sometimes resents<br/>
the *extra* work she has to do. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really extra. She<br/>
does the supper dishes, wipes the counters and sweeps the kitchen floor<br/>
every night. She changes the cat litter on Tuesday night for garbage day<br/>
and takes out the recycles to the curb once a week. She does her own<br/>
laundry. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a lot but to hear the *walking hormone*<br/>
wail and moan sometimes drives me up the wall.<br/>
I do however offer to pay for what I consider *extra* jobs. Jobs like<br/>
washing the kitchen floor or helping me spring clean, changing the<br/>
sheets on her brother and sister&#39;s beds. Jobs that are a little taxing<br/>
for me. She could make a really decent wage too if she wanted too(g).<br/>
I&#39;ve offered to pay her up to what a local cleanning lady would<br/>
get....she&#39;s not interested except when there is something she wants to<br/>
buy.<br/>
The other two younger ones deal with it pretty good. The youngest is<br/>
ready to help at the drop of a hat. The middle one sometimes needs a<br/>
nudge. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote> I feel bad when this happens to me too. I can&#39;t drive well at night any<br/>
more because of damage to my optic nerve from the MS. Sometimes Sam has<br/>
to miss Brownies &#39;cause I won&#39;t endanger us by driving in the dark.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I worry about this too....some days I take my cane out with me even<br/>
though I&#39;m not visibly disabled, it&#39;s for when I get tired walking and<br/>
then I start to stagger and I think that it emarrasses them a little.<br/>
Some days I must appear sooooo dense in the head to them. Other days I&#39;m<br/>
in a state of manic silliness and will laugh hystericaly at anything<br/>
odd/silly until the tears are streaming and I&#39;m snorting.<br/>
The kids love those days though ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On the other hand, has my illness taught them compassion, perserverance,<br/>
&gt; endurance, and faith?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it really teaches them compassion. They also learn that things<br/>
just happen and you really don&#39;t have any control over ANYTHING in life.<br/>
So just pull up your socks, set you jaw and tackle the problem head on.<br/>
I think it teaches them perserverance. They&#39;ve watched me tear out a<br/>
sweater piece I was knitting. I tore it apart and re did it three times.<br/>
They asked why when the mistake (which I kept making over and over,<br/>
duh!), wouldn&#39;t show,why was I tearing it out......so I told them...I<br/>
wanted it done properly and I would keep at it until I&#39;d done it right.<br/>
They watched me perservere until it was correct. I explained how it<br/>
might affect the final fit, how all the pieces needed to be right to fit<br/>
together properly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Our 3 month old baby daughter was in the hospital all<br/>
&gt; week with RSV.  The boys are so accustomed to my illness that they weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; frightened for her at all.  She came home yesterday and the boys help me by<br/>
&gt; giving her the breathing treatments.  I don&#39;t envision that being &quot;normal&quot;<br/>
&gt; for most 8 and 5 year olds.  Does that mean that they have been strengthened<br/>
&gt; and tempered by their experience with illness?  Are they better for it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps they knew they couldn&#39;t change the situation and, that moaning<br/>
and fretting wouldn&#39;t change the siuation. They met it head on and<br/>
proved to them selves that they can be helpful in stressful situations<br/>
and a comfort to you. <br/>
This is great! Perhaps they will be able to use this strength in a<br/>
future career.....nursing, couselling, social work etc. <br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;m laid up with walking pneumonia......went to the doctors<br/>
yesterday.....cost me $134 for medication and two different inhalers.<br/>
Katie has it too but her antibiotics were less expensive than mine<br/>
&#39;cause she can&#39;t get pills down so she&#39;s on a supension liquid and the<br/>
same two inhalers as I ($106). I&#39;m sooo glad hubby has %100 presciption<br/>
coverage! We&#39;re soo lucky to have that!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Geez....MS....pneumonia .....and I passed a  kidney stone last week (at<br/>
least this time I didn&#39;t have enough pain to warrant a third<br/>
*kidneystone hospital visit*!)......what a life eh!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-619305616">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i have still&#39;s disease, which is and autoimmune disease akin to rheumatoid<br/>
arthritis and lupus.  my whole life i have been really healthy (i.e. 5 years<br/>
between colds) but when i hit my 30&#39;s and was vaccinated with mmr vaccine my<br/>
health took a turn for the worse,  but it wasn&#39;t until  rene&#39; was 20 months when<br/>
this disease actually surfaced and i was finally diagnosed.<br/>
<br/>
the whole experience of the 1st 3 weeks, when the dr. thought i was a hippy<br/>
scamming for drugs and would not help me, not being able to move , losing 20 lbs<br/>
of muscle -mostly in my shoulders (it was so severe that i could not pick up an<br/>
empty paper cup let alone dress myself or even get up) were completely surreal.<br/>
my husband is deaf so i had to kick a 5 lb weight off the bed to vibrate the<br/>
house so he would come help me (creative problem solving:)   we were new to the<br/>
area and no family or friends to speak of so my husband had to stop working for<br/>
2 months.  it was a real nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
since rene&#39; was not really talking yet and i was so overwhelmed - kind of like<br/>
being stuck in an undertow and not knowing which end is up- he&#39;s emotional needs<br/>
kind of got lost in the mayhem.  it was about 2 months after the onset and<br/>
things started to quiet down, when it dawned on me that i hadn&#39;t talked to him<br/>
about what was happening- he had been very distant and would not look at me,<br/>
especially in the hospital, which he hated.   when i came home (he and i had<br/>
rarely spent anytime apart, no babysitters - mostly because we had no $ or<br/>
friends or family in the area) he stood on the porch laughed and laughed when he<br/>
saw me get out of the car.  i really think he thought i had moved out and into<br/>
the hospital and he was very angry i had left him.  at this time he had the<br/>
worst diaper rash ever.  i think it was because he was so stressed and he is<br/>
very stoic by nature that he toughed it out causing his body to get very very<br/>
acidic.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, we revisit this time periodically.  especially when i go some place to<br/>
have treatment. i&#39;ve done this twice - once to the chopra center in san diego<br/>
for 10 days and the 2nd to dallas maharishi ayurvedic center for 3 weeks.  both<br/>
times were very hard on him.  he hangs in there and is fine or appears fine but<br/>
after a few days some minor incident crushes him and he inevitably get sick and<br/>
stays sick until i return.  it&#39;s very sad.<br/>
<br/>
recently, about 2 1/2 years after onset, we were talking about horses and i was<br/>
telling him about the horses we had when i was a kid.  he asked me if he was<br/>
going to meet them and i said no because they were dead - well he broke down and<br/>
cried and cried, which is very unusual for him.  we talked about it and i asked<br/>
him if part of the reason he was so upset about the horses dying was because of<br/>
me being sick and he said &#39; i thought you were going to die&#39;.  it was so sad but<br/>
also very good that we  found a way to release some of this stress that had been<br/>
burdening him.<br/>
<br/>
the wonderful thing about this situation for him (for me is a whole other<br/>
story:) is that he has developed compassion, flexibility,  independence, a<br/>
deeper ability to cooperate and think of others,  as well as a good<br/>
understanding of the human body - before he was 4 he knew the different body<br/>
systems and the name of the organs, their basic functions and where they<br/>
belonged in the body.  i&#39;ve spent a lot of time and energy feeling very guilty<br/>
for not being able to do things with him, for relying so heavily on tv to make<br/>
it through the day, for not being able to drive a car (because of the severe<br/>
lost of muscle in my shoulder i get fatigued just by sitting up) etc. but now i<br/>
have accepted it as a wonderful gift rather than seeing as a burden and<br/>
something that ruined rene&#39;s chances at  having a happy childhood.  we learn<br/>
things in so many diverse ways who&#39;s to really say what is the best way to<br/>
learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-597151808">When I was a child my aunt, who was my mom&#39;s best friend and lived with us for a while, had lupus.  She passed away when she was 24 and I was 10.  My mother has always had health problems, which they&#39;re still not positive what it is.  Fibromaylsia ,sp?&gt; I think is what they&#39;ve decided.  When my aunt lived with us I would get up with her a 5 am to help her do her hair for work.  On her days off we would tiptoe around the house so she could sleep until noon.  When her hair fell out I went to help her pick out a wig.  I was devastated when she died.  I have always helped my mother with housework and taking care of my brother.  To be perfectly honest, I do have to say that I feel that my mother depended too much on me (my dad left when I was 6) and was too hard on me (C&#39;s on my report card was not acceptable no matter what).  But, I think that was because of her circumstances and not really illness related.  I loved helping my aunt and never thought anything about it.  After all I feel that we are on this earth to help each other.  I think it has helped me to be more sensitive to others and also more intutive.  And it a way it has been a blessing in my life.  So I&#39;ve grown to be unmateralistic and I think I cherish life perhaps a bit more then I would have without the experience.  That which does not kill you should make you stronger.  And I think that life&#39;s pain and difficulties are lessons that we need to learn from in order to become more well rounded people.  Also, to let you know I have never been embarrassed by my mom or aunt even though we have plenty of stories that we look back and laugh about now.<br/>

<br/>
Oh, Susan.  I&#39;m so very very sorry.  I miscarried at 13 weeks about 1-1/2 <br/>
years ago.  It was probably related to my immune system.  Fortunately, my <br/>
lupus calmed down immediately afterward and I got pregnant again 4 months <br/>
later.  I&#39;m very happy to say that she is now almost 4 months old!  To calm <br/>
my immune system down I have done several rounds of chemotherapy.  During <br/>
pregnancy I took a baby aspirin each day, at my doctor&#39;s suggestion.  This <br/>
helps a lot.  Please accept my condolences.  I know that it can be a crushing <br/>
loss, even early in pregnancy.  Take good care of yourself during this hard <br/>
time.  Grief often triggers an autoimmune response.  Peace be with you.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337257159">Hi Brooke,<br/>
<br/>
I am so sorry to have offended you, I certainly didn&#39;t mean too. I think it is<br/>
wonderful that you love and support your daughter in your journey thru her<br/>
illness, if my parents had been as loving as you are I would be very grateful. My<br/>
parents never bothered to be so interested in me, in fact they told me that my<br/>
condition was probably my fault so I could fix it on my own. However, I know why<br/>
*I* have my illness and I hope so much that I will never be proved wrong and have<br/>
to see one of my girls go thru what I do each day. I know that not every auto<br/>
immune disease is caused by abuse and neglect and I know that there is no reason<br/>
for alot of suffering. Just as I know that my condition is caused by hearing<br/>
everyday how much my mother never wanted me, how much she hated me, how hopeless,<br/>
lazy, blah, blah, blah I was. I know that the suffering in my soul that my father<br/>
caused by hitting me, swinging me around the room by my hair, and holding up<br/>
against the wall by my throat at least weekly caused *my* condition.<br/>
I certainly never meant to offend you or anyone else but if you re-read my post<br/>
you will see that I referred to myself only.<br/>
Perhaps you could be so good as to let me have my own opinion as to why *I* am<br/>
sick.<br/>
Please accept my apologies as sincere, I would never mean to hurt anyone.<br/>
Good luck with your daughter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095560249">hi brooke,<br/>
<br/>
i am so sorry.   i did not mean to say the sole cause of autoimmune disease was<br/>
abuse experienced in childhood.  i wanted to keep my reply short because i tend<br/>
to go on at some length.  there are many reason why this happens and each case is<br/>
truly unique so no sweeping generalization makes any sense.  i know as a parent<br/>
guilt is a very difficult to avoid and i certainly would not want to contribute<br/>
to yours, so please accept my heart felt apology for my utter insensitivity on<br/>
this subject.<br/>
<br/>
what was told to me by western drs is: &#39;we simply have no idea what precipitates<br/>
autoimmune diseases&#39;;  but that they have found that emotion is a component, that<br/>
a good attitude tends to minimize the flares - the stress factor - the better you<br/>
can process and release stress the fewer symptoms you will experience.   beyond<br/>
that they are really at a loss as to the cause as well as a &#39;cure&#39;.  what they<br/>
told me to do was to go home take a few meds, and advised me to enjoy my family<br/>
and to try to wean off the meds asap because of the side effects of long term<br/>
use.  though there are lots of theories based on patterns seen in patients,<br/>
treatment to date has been based on symptoms and trying to make the person as<br/>
comfortable as possible.<br/>
<br/>
in my case, simply stated, the disease appears to have developed over a period of<br/>
time as a reaction to the mmr vaccine i was give at the age of 29 (they think i<br/>
was over vaccinated),  but according to the vedic dr i saw (on the advise of my<br/>
admitting  allopathic dr at the hospital at onset) autoimmune disease is<br/>
basically a problem with digestion, both literal and figurative (the digestion<br/>
system is now believed by some to be a major component of the immune system).<br/>
when food (or experiences) is not properly digested, it creates toxins and these<br/>
toxins then accumulate in the joints - rheumatoid arthritis, the connective<br/>
tissues or systemically - lupus, the myelin surrounding the nerves - ms etc.<br/>
when the body tries to rid itself of these toxin it also rids the body of the<br/>
tissue the toxins have accumulated in.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve read, in a study of people with rheumatoid arthritis, that100% of those<br/>
studied (the exact # in the study escapes me) were found to have toxic intestinal<br/>
linings making digestion and absortion nearly impossible which creates more<br/>
toxins and then the disease continues to progress.  this in combination with the<br/>
side effects of the meds (e.g. destruction of cartilage & bone  by the steroids)<br/>
creates more and more difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
the vedic perspective links the mind and the body (much like einstein linked time<br/>
and space) so their approach is to eliminate toxins, but these toxins can be<br/>
created through the mind (experiences) leading to a disruption in the physiology<br/>
(poor digestion of food).   this is were the abusive childhood plays in.  the<br/>
vedics see that we digest experiences much like we digest food.  if we experience<br/>
something we find overwhelming then we store what we can&#39;t process which creates<br/>
stress which in turn creates toxins then we find ourselves with difficulties of<br/>
all sorts - not just autoimmune but allergies as well as others maladies.  the<br/>
vedics also hold similar perspectives as the buddist and see karma and past lives<br/>
as additional contributing factors.<br/>
<br/>
regardless of the perspective there seems to be a consensus that something in the<br/>
brain - a switch of sorts - seems to be stuck in the on position and until this<br/>
switch moves freely in response to a genuine need the symptoms will continue.<br/>
for some of us this comes in the form of unconditional love, which was not<br/>
experienced in childhood,  and for others like your daughter other factors are at<br/>
issue.  perhaps one of the reasons autoimmune diseases prove to be such a<br/>
mystery, especially for allopathic dr, is because there are so many variables,<br/>
that generalization just don&#39;t hold water, making it impossible to have one fixed<br/>
approach - identify & name the disease then treat with standard protocol.<br/>
<br/>
again i want you to know i am so sorry, i was being completely thoughtless in my<br/>
comments. having a sick child is so difficult, when i put myself is your place my<br/>
condition/situation pales.  thank you for pointing out my insensitivity and<br/>
narrow minded comment and please know it was not my intent to make such a<br/>
generalization but was given simply as support and acknowledgement of one portion<br/>
of reality not the whole picture.<br/>

&gt; Dear Susan and Michele and others....,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We love, support, nurture our darling daughter. She has a tremendously<br/>
&gt; secure environment.<br/>
&gt; ..with a loving mom :), a super Dad, and an empathetic and fun-loving<br/>
&gt; sister (to keep her laughing).<br/>
&gt; Our daughter&#39;s life is full, rich, bountiful...and we feel blessed every<br/>
&gt; day that we can home-learn together.<br/>
&gt; She is LOVED and NURTURED and SHE HAS a chronic auto-immune disorder.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, I found the  comments regarding abuse and neglect in regard to<br/>
&gt; having disease  insensitive to all parents of children with auto-immune<br/>
&gt; disorders. These parents (me included) don&#39;t need any guilt trips.  We have<br/>
&gt; met many, many parents of sick kids in our numerous visits to clinics and<br/>
&gt; med. specialists. These parents are dealing with huge issues on behalf of<br/>
&gt; their children. And these parents are , from what we have seen, loving and<br/>
&gt; supporting and caring parents as well.<br/>
&gt; Parents of children with auto-immune disorders live with constant stress.<br/>
&gt; We worry about what our sick children eat, and how they sleep, and how to<br/>
&gt; manage their chronic pain, and how to manage their many medications and<br/>
&gt; treatments, and how to support the family during emotionally stressful<br/>
&gt; times, and how to just carry on from one day to the next.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had to write this note in support of any other parents who are on this<br/>
&gt; list and are dealing with similar issues with sick children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know there are terrible abuses inflicted on some children...and certainly<br/>
&gt; if children with auto-immune disorders had to deal with that abuse it would<br/>
&gt; exacerbate their conditions. But please do not  suggest that abused and<br/>
&gt; neglected children get auto-immune disorders. It is a sweeping<br/>
&gt; generalization that does not deserve much merit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Brooke<br/>
&gt; P.S. I agree with your earlier post, Susan, that stated that dealing with<br/>
&gt; these issues makes one a deeper and richer person with a profoundly<br/>
&gt; empathetic heart. Our daughter has certainly exhibited this on many<br/>
&gt; occasions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562640862">hi  michele,<br/>
<br/>
i took your advise and reread both our posts and i didn&#39;t interpreted<br/>
either of them as saying  anything other than abuse in childhood as a<br/>
real cause, not the sole cause.  i too am very sorry for the<br/>
misunderstanding and feel that&#39;s all it was.<br/>
<br/>
i personally have experienced similar &#39;annihilation&#39; and invalidation as<br/>
you- and still do though to no avail.  my family not only never came to<br/>
see me in the hospital (where the drs kept me for 10 days and thought i<br/>
might die) they treated me as if i were lying and looking for<br/>
attention.   a few years later they hired a pi to investigate all the<br/>
kids (weird put true:),  apparently the pi told them i was telling the<br/>
truth because now they seem to accept that i was ill.  but i&#39;m so<br/>
distant from them it just has no value and no real effect on my life.<br/>
what i have learned is to love them and accept them for who they are and<br/>
where they&#39;re at but i do it from a distance and keep my interactions<br/>
with them as superficial as possible.<br/>
<br/>
i think if you have an autoimmune disease trust in yourself is critic no<br/>
matter what caused the disease.  one should never undermine another&#39;s<br/>
self expression,  especially in cases such as these, because development<br/>
of the self is paramount.  we know and can all agree that stress is a<br/>
critical element in managing autoimmune diseases.  when one experiences<br/>
acceptance of one&#39;s self expression, stress is reduces, which helps the<br/>
disease not to flare or at least the flares aren&#39;t as great.  the vedics<br/>
see that self referral is the only real way to balance the system and<br/>
create homeostasis - the desired state.  to do this you need to find<br/>
your own inner intelligence (the balanced functioning of the entire<br/>
system) this they view is done by connecting with everything around you<br/>
and seeing life as unified rather than disparate.  so keep on know the<br/>
cause of your disease and loving your family - i find that this has<br/>
helped me tremendously too.<br/>
<br/>
best wishes<br/>

&gt; Hi Brooke,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am so sorry to have offended you, I certainly didn&#39;t mean too. I<br/>
&gt; think it is wonderful that you love and support your daughter in your<br/>
&gt; journey thru her illness, if my parents had been as loving as you are<br/>
&gt; I would be very grateful. My parents never bothered to be so<br/>
&gt; interested in me, in fact they told me that my condition was probably<br/>
&gt; my fault so I could fix it on my own. However, I know why *I* have my<br/>
&gt; illness and I hope so much that I will never be proved wrong and have<br/>
&gt; to see one of my girls go thru what I do each day. I know that not<br/>
&gt; every auto immune disease is caused by abuse and neglect and I know<br/>
&gt; that there is no reason for alot of suffering. Just as I know that my<br/>
&gt; condition is caused by hearing everyday how much my mother never<br/>
&gt; wanted me, how much she hated me, how hopeless, lazy, blah, blah, blah<br/>
&gt; I was. I know that the suffering in my soul that my father caused by<br/>
&gt; hitting me, swinging me around the room by my hair, and holding up<br/>
&gt; against the wall by my throat at least weekly caused *my* condition.<br/>
&gt; I certainly never meant to offend you or anyone else but if you<br/>
&gt; re-read my post you will see that I referred to myself only.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps you could be so good as to let me have my own opinion as to<br/>
&gt; why *I* am sick.<br/>
&gt; Please accept my apologies as sincere, I would never mean to hurt<br/>
&gt; anyone.<br/>
&gt; Good luck with your daughter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532105948">hi,<br/>
<br/>
thank you so much for share this with me.  i really appreciate it, more than i<br/>
can say.  family is so important to me especially since i wasn&#39;t blessed with a<br/>
loving and supportive birth family.  i met my husband, who is 8 years younger<br/>
than me, when i was 34 and had rene&#39; when i was 36.  we originally wanted just<br/>
one but after a while i realized how much i really loved our family and being a<br/>
mom and want to pursue that rather than a career as a painter (at least for a<br/>
long while).   so we decided to have another kid.  we were just about to try,<br/>
about a week before i was to ovulate, when out of the blue i got sick and the<br/>
drs said i had still&#39;s disease.  so we tried 6 months later, and i miscarried<br/>
but that was no big surprise - i was still quite sick but off meds for 3+ months<br/>
but still very laid up.  so we waited, about 2 years, while i tried many<br/>
alternative treatments.  i began to feel much better so we tried again and i<br/>
miscarried again.  so hopefully &#39;3&#39;s a charm&#39;:) and this acupuncturist will be<br/>
of help.  though i&#39;ll be happy either way.  rene&#39; was upset because he really<br/>
wants to be a big brother but he got over it very fast.  he had requested 3 sets<br/>
of twins lol.   i told that perhaps he would father 3 sets of twins one day and<br/>
his dream can be fulfilled that way:) but i most certain got not grant that<br/>
request.  he said that was fine and that he would be ok if he ended up an only<br/>
child.  so the pressures off &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again,<br/>

&gt; Hello Susan,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We actually had our second two daughters after the infertility treatment.<br/>
&gt; The Clomid and progesterone are to regulate your hormones.  The baby aspirin<br/>
&gt; to calm down whatever little problem seemed to be causing my body to reject<br/>
&gt; the fertilized eggs.  After 6 (count them, not fun!) endometrial biopsies<br/>
&gt; while taking the hormones, and no good results, the physicians threw up their<br/>
&gt; hands and just said go ahead and try to get pregnant, taking all this<br/>
&gt; medication.  The very next month was when I got pregnant with Carolyn, my 6<br/>
&gt; 1/2 year old.  Had a totally normal and easy pregnancy.  At age 39.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We thought we were done, or at least, couldn&#39;t get pregnant without medical<br/>
&gt; assistance.  Yuk yuk.  At the ripe old age of 43, I had to call my husband at<br/>
&gt; work and say, &quot;I hope you&#39;re sitting down.&quot;  My precious Annie, now nearly 3,<br/>
&gt; is the joy of our lives.  I had a totally sick nine months with her, and both<br/>
&gt; of us almost died during the C-section.  She was the only one of my three<br/>
&gt; whom we thought we would have to leave in the hospital.  Fortunately, that<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t happen, at the last minute.  She is now the most rip-roaring two year<br/>
&gt; old you&#39;d ever want to meet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband had a vasectomy last year.  For me, a baby at 43 is one thing; a<br/>
&gt; baby at 53 would be another.  My dream is to move into a sprawling farm house<br/>
&gt; and adopt some older kids who need homes.<br/>

<br/>
Being estranged somewhat from my parents and definitely from my siblings, I <br/>
can empathize with what you must feel.  My parents have done many invasive <br/>
things to me; they used to live down the street from us but moved south in <br/>
September.  The distance is helping.  <br/>
<br/>
My mother chose to call my family physician at the beginning of my <br/>
miscarriage problems.  Fortunately, he told her that it was none of her <br/>
business.  And my parents lived right down the street from us, and the <br/>
confrontation was difficult.  My mother did apologize to me.  That was 9 <br/>
years before we had the nearly family-destroying confrontation over their <br/>
50th anniversary.  My mother told me that she didn&#39;t believe that I was <br/>
seeing a psychologist because I wouldn&#39;t give her her name.  More control <br/>
issues.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, having a renewed faith through a new church has helped me more <br/>
than the psychologist ever did.  But that&#39;s only me and my own personal <br/>
experience.<br/>

Many blessings to you,<br/>
