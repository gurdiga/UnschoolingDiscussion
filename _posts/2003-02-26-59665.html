&lt;&lt; I think sometimes outsiders think that the way I parent is &quot;the easy way <br/>
out&quot; <br/>
but I really think it is the harder road.  I force myself (and they force me) <br/>
to treat my children like any other person... if I want my way it is about <br/>
compromise.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OH!!!<br/>
The other night Marty had had a long day, was frustrated with various things <br/>
and people, and we got into an argument.  Yelling.  I finally said &quot;WHY are <br/>
you yelling at me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said &quot;Because you were yelling at me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Simple fact.<br/>
<br/>
I think he started it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But if I&#39;m going to treat him like a person I shouldn&#39;t yell at him and I <br/>
can&#39;t get made because he yelled at his mom.  He was yelling at another <br/>
person.  I&#39;m the one who made the groundrules, so I couldn&#39;t say &quot;You can&#39;t <br/>
yell at your mother.&quot;  The little voices inside me said &quot;Don&#39;t let him yell <br/>
at you like that,&quot; but the bigger wiser voice told me to stop yelling at him <br/>
and the whole thing would be over.<br/>
<br/>
We hugged and touched and checked on each other sweetly more the next day <br/>
than we had for two weeks before that.  And maybe that was part of the <br/>
problem too.  We hadn&#39;t connected as much as usual for several days before <br/>
the incident.  He had lost his normal contact with what I needed and was <br/>
doing and why, and I wasn&#39;t aware of the frustrations of his day.<br/>
<br/>
We had failed to be together.<br/>
