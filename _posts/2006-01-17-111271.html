<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556995187">My son really wanted to go and see Glory Road, so we went Sunday. It <br/>
was very good and brought up a lot of issues for discussion. (We sat <br/>
in the back, so I&#39;m hoping that all of our talking through the movie <br/>
didn&#39;t bother anybody - nobody shushed us, anyway!) If you&#39;re not <br/>
familiar with the movie, it&#39;s based on the true story about the 1965 <br/>
NCAA basketball championship where the west Texas coach started 5 <br/>
black players - the first time in basketball history. My son asked <br/>
questions all through the movie, mostly about the racism in the movie.<br/>
<br/>
As far as rentals go, my son&#39;s current favorites are the Horatio <br/>
Hornblower series (we&#39;ve been getting them from the library). <br/>
