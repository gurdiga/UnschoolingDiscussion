<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311098229">I know I haven&#39;t been available online lately, very sorry about that.<br/>
I want to give a quick plug to the raffle for the upcoming conference <br/>
though!!<br/>
If you have an interesting/fun or unique item to donate for this <br/>
awesome unschooling event, please contact me ASAP.:)  Donations can <br/>
be brought to the conference if you&#39;re attending, or I can give you <br/>
an address if you&#39;d rather mail it.<br/>
In the past, items have varied from handmade to corporate donations, <br/>
magazine subscriptions, games etc... the more variety, the better.<br/>
<br/>
All of the proceeds from this raffle support the scholarship fund!<br/>
<br/>
Please think about donating something....it&#39;s greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

Thanks a million!!<br/>
