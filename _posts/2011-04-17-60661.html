<div id="ygrps-yiv-651569554">Reading the turn off the TV thread has triggered some of my fears about media, despite some of the obvious absurdities, isn&#39;t that funny?  My son just turned three.  We don&#39;t have a television in our house, but we have internet and laptops and we watch dvds, netflix and you tube. I actually just cancelled netflix as we are sick of the watch instantly selections and with nicer weather can walk daily to the library to pick new dvds. We&#39;re relatively new to our area so our library dvd selection is largely untapped.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how batman first came into our lives.  Sometimes we buy a shirt or a plate that has a picture on it, sometimes we get a DVD at the library, or we just hear about something,  We get on the internet, surf around, and see what we can find. My son loves heroic figures.  The first one he loved was Don Quixote, we had gotten a DVD and he rode around on his pole horse with his foam sword shouting &quot;Dulcinia, I am here to save you!&quot; He loves underdog very much as well. But Batman has been his favorite.  No one else is ever allowed to enact batman but him, which of course is fine with us. We have a batman cape, and I&#39;ve put in many hours as robin and catwoman. We&#39;ve made a shadowpuppet theatre with all of the figures from the television program, The Batman. We&#39;ve managed without television to watch this program many, many times and we all actually enjoy it. i think it is nicely drawn and stunningly colorized, and there are some ironies that my DH and I appreciate. Its themes, on the other hand, do cause me some concern. Batman, the hero, is also a wealthy industrialist with little or no relationships or connection to the world around him except through his masked identity. I could speak at length about my objections to the shows premise but it doesn&#39;t matter-- I do not think my son appreciates all of that. However, this is being drilled into his head at an age when he has no critical capacity to defend himself.  Also a concern, for me, is the ever-present good/bad identity that I see in many of these shows.  Many good characters have a bad double...is this split a healthy psychological construct for a young child? Bad batman acts,good batman fixes it...<br/>
<br/>
In the thread about turning off the television someone cited the Waldorf teachers concern about a camera lens coming between a child and the world too soon.  I am not so concerned about this, but I worry in exactly the same way about narrative.  Is narrative obscuring the world for my son, what attitudes is this narrative tracing in his young mind, what other facets our world could it be potentially blinding him to?  <br/>
<br/>
Many of our other activities have become batman themed. I often introduce batman themed activities In our play because it so delights my son. Our shadowpuppet theate has a cast of superheros and villians from all different shows. I do see that my son is sometimes testing the limits of the many narratives we&#39;ve seen, but more often we are just reenacting the shows.  I like that we&#39;ve seen so many different batmans via the amazing internet, but I am worried that my son will be limited by these core narratives. narrative is what causes us to select from the vast stimuli, to choose what to preference and notice.  <br/>
<br/>
Many days go by with no shows at all, we spend entire days outside in our yard, playing with sand or in the water table, working on the garden, and reading in our tent. My son has chosen to take numerous books out to our thin mesh tent and it has become a reading room.  Of course, I have the same fears with books as I do with media, concerns about narrative. I do not think I am bringing these fears into my play with my son, I am somehow able to suspend disbelief. Probably because my son is so adorable and funny I really love playing with him! Nor are my concerns all about batman, or necessarily related to the violence of those shows.  we wrestle and play fight with our very physical son and always have. <br/>
<br/>
We were playing at our water table last week, adding colors and leaves and dirt and grass and mixing things up. He started calling me scientist mommy and talking about doing experiments, like we&#39;d seen on the Backyardigans.  i worry--is he experiencing the tactile expereince, feeling the textures, the sunlight on the water, etc. if he is preoccupied with playing a role?  I fear something is being lost!    <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t restrict my son, we will even watch the same show multiple times if he requests.  He sometimes requests a particular scene. I know he is doing this in order to get the part down better, as he is able to imitate the characters very well. But he is also totally enamored with the heroic figure in all its forms and told me the other day that he wants to protect me and save me. I hugged him and told him I feel the same way. The other day he asked me after his nap (did he have a dream I wonder?) if there are bad things in the world. When I admitted, mildly, that there were, he said, in a voice with trembling with emotion, that he would fight those things.  I don&#39;t know what to think of this. When he&#39;s frightened by something he slips on his batman gloves and is brave. Sometimes he is very timid and whispers...is this the real child beneath all the barman bravado? Is all of this playacting, with dh and I following his cues, healthy? Please help!   <br/>

<br/>
Not funny.<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling takes a long time, for adults, and must be consciously pursued.  <br/>
Every word you use, every thought, is either getting warmer (regarding coming to a deep understanding of natural learning) or getting cold (moving you away from unschooling and toward fears and schoolish thinking).<br/>
<br/>
-=- I actually just cancelled netflix as we are sick of the watch instantly selections...-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sick of&quot;?  <br/>
Too strong.  Too emotional.<br/>
New selections are added all the time.<br/>

<br/>
I think you would be comforted and excited to read some of what Gerard Jones has written about these things.   There are things online, but he wrote a book called Killing Monsters:  Why Children NEED Fantasy, Super Heroes, and Make-Believe Violence.<br/>
<br/>
Something free and quick:   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/people/kathyward/gerardjones">http://sandradodd.com/people/kathyward/gerardjones</a><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Above you said &quot;We are sick of...&quot; and now &quot;We have a batman cape.&quot;<br/>
This might seem very minor to you, but it might help for you to listen for such things.  If you&#39;re not differentiating between you and your child (and he is very young, I know), it will make it harder for you to separate your concerns from his reality.<br/>

That surprises you.  By saying you &quot;actually&quot; enjoy it, you&#39;re implying that you didn&#39;t want to, and didn&#39;t expect to.   And in a large way, you don&#39;t.  So you&#39;re not being honest with yourself.  <br/>

Apparently it DOES matter, to you, in your head, where it&#39;s darker than Batman-world, because you wrote:<br/>

Don&#39;t think so much.  Seriously.  You&#39;ve spun three-year-old learning into a bunch of big words and fears and negativity.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think of his play as ANY kind of &quot;psychological construct.&quot;   If a child likes The Three Little Pigs and is glad when the wolf doesn&#39;t eat them, is that &quot;a psychological construct&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Please, when you&#39;re writing for this list, try to use your own words and your own thoughts.  Unless you can see your child directly, and not through layers of other people&#39;s warnings and words, you will be BE with him.  He will be with Batman, and you will be with the voices in  your head that are talking about the danger of narrative, and of unhealthy psychological constructs.  <br/>

This is a concern for me because of my own troubles with this kind of<br/>
thinking. I want my son to be a fully integrated person, and by this I mean<br/>
I want him to embrace all of his actions and qualities in a whole person,<br/>
and not have a dark side he splits off and doesn&#39;t acknowledge or projects<br/>
onto other people. Isn&#39;t this healthier?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Please, when you&#39;re writing for this list, try to use your own words and<br/>
&gt; your own thoughts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These are my own thoughts and words, as much as words and thoughts can<br/>
belong to anyone.  Language is collaborative, we all share thoughts and<br/>
ideas.  I did give an example with the water table of my concern of<br/>
narrative getting between my son and his experiences.  He&#39;s focused on a<br/>
story or a role and not experiencing sensations, not experiencing the world<br/>
in all its astounding sublimity.<br/>
<br/>
My worry is this: stories can be useful shortcuts to understanding, but they<br/>
simplify things and sometimes oversimplify them.  I&#39;m afraid this might lead<br/>
him to a less nuanced understanding of the world, which is a problem I see<br/>
in people thinking all around me.  If my son is seeing the same simple story<br/>
over and over he&#39;s being directed to pick up on certain motifs and themes,<br/>
and I worry about this. Not because any so-called child expert has alerted<br/>
me to the dangers of narrative, but because of my own understanding of<br/>
stories, which I do have a passion for; I write fiction. I&#39;m concerned<br/>
because I do believe in the power of a story and I&#39;m worried that<br/>
foundational narratives (my words!) are being laid in his young brain.  I&#39;m<br/>
not able to explain myself entirely to my satisfaction due to time<br/>
constraints, but perhaps I&#39;ll take a hack at it later.  I do want to rewrite<br/>
the section you asked me to rephrase as it is the heart of my concerns and I<br/>
want to express myself clearly on that point.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, i do know that netflixs adds new watch instantly, sick of was a<br/>
strong word, tired of would be better. Every six months or so we drop<br/>
netflix for a month or two so we can explore new resources, save a little<br/>
money, and then we&#39;re always happy when we get it back.  I didn&#39;t mean to<br/>
imply we were finished with netflix, just taking a break. With our budget,<br/>
even the small fee we pay them can be used for something else like swimming<br/>
pool fees. :)<br/>

The trouble is, you&#39;re assuming that without this thing - tv, movies, narrative, whatever, there&#39;s be some kind of special freedom to choose and as a result he&#39;d choose something you&#39;d find more comfortable. In reality, though, he&#39;s drawn to some aspect of that narrative. Without batman, he&#39;d find something else and it might be something you weren&#39;t thrilled with. Ray had a fascination with poo for a time. I&#39;d have preferred batman ;)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Imitation is an important aspect of learning. To tell a good story, you have to know the parts of a story and how they hang together, so you study stories. You read them or listen to them or watch them as shows or plays and then repeat them as exactly as you can to be sure you have the parts right. There are writing classes that give people modles to study. There are painting schools that start students by copying the work of &quot;great masters&quot;. How do people learn ballet? Lots and lots of repetition of other people&#39;s work. <br/>
<br/>
Kids know all that, already, so they find things that intrigue them and repeat them over and over, to get a sense of how they go together. Not all kids all the time, but its a big, big part of learning for many people. Parents and teachers find that upsetting because the child has chosen what to imitate - but batman isn&#39;t inherently worse than the Brothers Grimm or folk tales or religious stories. The themes aren&#39;t worse, that&#39;s for sure. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>********************<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t think playing a role could be a natural part of his process? It is for many people. It&#39;s one of the quirks of our human nature, that we can imagine ourselves as someone or something else - and for some people that&#39;s part of how we learn and grow. Don&#39;t impose how you imagine he should be learning on how he really learns. <br/>

I totally agree with Meredith on that.  The boy is three years old.  36 months, and some, old.  <br/>

Any time &quot;just&quot; is used, it&#39;s good to look at why.  It&#39;s often a belitting put-down, or a defense of something.  He&#39;s just playing.  He&#39;s just joking.<br/>

To speak of &quot;narrative&quot; rather than directly of stories, when speaking of a three year old, is too distant, too technical.  You&#39;re being up in your head, not down with your child.<br/>
<br/>
This list has the mothers of MANY, many former three year old boys, and some current ones.  We can help you see other angles if you can accept input and not &quot;yeah, but&quot; everything.  We can help you see the joy and beauty and learning  rather than the buts and &quot;justs&quot; and the fears.<br/>

<br/>
Role playing is what kids DO!  Would it make you feel better if you were living <br/>
in a hunter/gatherer culture and he was role playing hunting with sticks or role <br/>
playing building fires?  What would be lost if he stopped watching <br/>
 Backyardigans?  Maybe he wouldn&#39;t be inspired to make stories around mudpies?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My oldest was little when Pokemon came out.  Many parents created hysteria <br/>
around it, schools banned it.  We knew kids whose parents banned it or barely <br/>
tolerated it as a soon to be passing fad.  We embraced it.  Our daughter loved <br/>
it, never wanted to miss a show.  We bought our first gameboy color with a <br/>
Pokemon game when she was 4.  She took that everywhere with her.  She just <br/>
turned 17 and STILL loves Pokemon.  She got a new game for her birthday. <br/>
 Everything she is today can be traced back to her love of Pokemon.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of person would she be if she never loved Pokemon?  Does it matter? <br/>
 What if she had fallen in love with American Girl dolls or horses?  Would that <br/>
be better?  What if she had become a fan of Barbie dolls? What if she delved <br/>
into baseball and her life had become centered around that?  Maybe she would <br/>
have become fascinated by Nancy Drew, like I did as a kid, and played detective. <br/>
 Would that be better?<br/>
<br/>
***The other day he asked me after his nap (did he have a dream I wonder?) if <br/>
there are bad things in the world. When I admitted, mildly, that there were, he <br/>
said, in a voice with trembling with emotion, that he would fight those things. <br/>
I don&#39;t know what to think of this. When he&#39;s frightened by something he slips <br/>
on his batman gloves and is brave. Sometimes he is very timid and whispers...is <br/>
this the real child beneath all the barman bravado? Is all of this playacting, <br/>
with dh and I following his cues, healthy? Please help!*** <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The ways that kids play are how they can incorporate big ideas.  It IS what kids <br/>
do.  It&#39;s normal to process the world through play, especially role playing. <br/>
 Would it be better if he incorporated fairies like Waldorf?  How is that any <br/>
different?<br/>
<br/>
These are little things.  Focus on peace and happiness.  If what you do is <br/>
helping his life be peaceful and happy, then keep doing it.  If it isn&#39;t causing <br/>
peace and happiness, then stop doing it.  Would taking away Batman be peaceful <br/>
and happy?  Would finding harshness in Batman create peace and happiness?  Would <br/>
it stop your child from waking up from a bad dream and realizing the world is <br/>
bigger than him and potentially scary?  One day he&#39;ll be bigger and more aware <br/>
of the world.  Will his lens be one of happiness and peace or will it be one of <br/>
worry and fear?<br/>
<br/>
What you do can create a divide if you let it.  You could alienate your son by <br/>
diminishing his joy of the things he loves by fearing and worrying, or you could <br/>
do what you know works already, love and enjoy and embrace it in his play and <br/>
stop worrying.  If you make too big a deal of little things he&#39;ll grow to <br/>
believe that you are full of crap and stop listening to you.  Parents can do so <br/>
much to damage their relationship with their kids and it starts with the little <br/>
things.<br/>

stories, which I do have a passion for; I write fiction. I&#39;m concerned<br/>
because I do believe in the power of a story and I&#39;m worried that<br/>
foundational narratives (my words!) are being laid in his young brain.***<br/>
<br/>
Good vs. Bad is the most classic and simplistic narrative in existence!  Yet, it <br/>
is also the most complex!  Which is why it gets played over and over and over in <br/>
so many different contexts.  If you are interested in exploring more complex <br/>
narratives on good vs. bad, try some Hayao Miyazaki movies.  His approach seems <br/>
to be that there is good and bad in everyone and it&#39;s not so dualistic and <br/>
simplistic.  Actually a lot of anime comes from that approach.  Even Batman is a <br/>
bit like that, the &quot;bad&quot; guys have reasons for being that way.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter has spent her life in narrative.  She loves stories, she&#39;s <br/>
watched a lot of movies and read a lot of books and it&#39;s fueled her imaginative <br/>
play.  It is so much a part of who she is that I don&#39;t think I could have kept <br/>
that from her, even if we&#39;d decided that all media was banned.  She would have <br/>
been the kid secretly reading with a flashlight at night to get stories, or <br/>
going to sleepovers just to watch movies.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are a fiction writer, it&#39;s likely your own childhood was imbued with <br/>
stories.  It could be genetic.  It could be how your child processes the world! <br/>
 When my oldest gets in a funk, the best thing I can do for her is to invite her <br/>
to watch a movie or TV series for hours.  It is a huge part of how she processes <br/>
her world.  She feeds her mind with stories and ideas, it inspires wonderful <br/>
crafts and conversations!<br/>

<br/>
In your life, was the Only place you saw black and white thinking on tv or in books? I bet not. Schools can be very extremist in terms of categorizing people - good girls and sluts, mama boys and jocks, popular kids and nerds. Those aren&#39;t just images in the media, those are the real dynamics people fight with in school. I was bad at sports because I was a smart girl. Five years after I graduated high school I realized I&#39;d never been bad at sports, I had Learned to be bad at sports because that was my role in school. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then don&#39;t sweep what he loves under the rug. Seriously. People have a &quot;dark side&quot; when their passions are seen as undesirable. My dark side was (brace yourself) handcrafts. Yes, smart girl me who had succeeded in being bad at sports, felt I had to hide the fact that I liked to cross stitch and knit. As dark sides go, that might not seem so bad, but its tied up in a whooooole lot of scary sexist baggage about what makes people good and strong and smart and right. <br/>
<br/>
Boys run into that kind of baggage too, and it can lead to other kinds of &quot;dark sides&quot;. It can lead to stuffing down feelings until all that&#39;s safe to express is anger. But your son won&#39;t learn to stuff his feelings watching batman - he&#39;ll learn to stuff them if you say &quot;what you love isn&#39;t important&quot;. Your words and actions are far, far more powerful than a tv show. If your son is free to exult, free to bounce up and down for joy, free to tear up and free to cuddle with his mama, then he&#39;s not going to have any Need for an alter ego. If he doesn&#39;t need to hide Who He Is from the people he loves, he won&#39;t. <br/>

You could not prevent that short of keeping all stories away from him. He&#39;s choosing what&#39;s interesting to him - that&#39;s a good thing! What other story do you think he&#39;d pick, without Batman? Do you think it would be better?<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, with a black and white tv, no less, we played WWII for days on end with one set of neighbors and Hells Angels for days on end with another set and my brother and I played magic castles and ghosts in the woods together. All of those had essentially the same themes - heros and villains, victims and traitors. Take some time to read a bunch of folk tales from a variety of cultures - all across the world - and see what the similarities are. See what they have in common with Batman. That might ease your fears a little. <br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a classical theme in that quote - the human struggle to meld the intellect and the physical: the gods and the demons, struggling for power over the soul. You don&#39;t get to step in and push the demons out of the way for someone else, not even your own child. That&#39;s one of the universal themes of parenthood. You can&#39;t even know what his gods are demons are or will be, because he&#39;s not you.<br/>

It doesn&#39;t have to be one or the other. What&#39;s the difference in being brave and pretending to be? I have a lot of fears and I couldn&#39;t tell you the difference. When I was building my house (myself, alone, with a fear of heights and power tools) I would play dress up. I had my &quot;power femme climbs ladders&quot; outfit with red white and blue striped leotards and a spangly top and I&#39;d shimmy up the ladder with my nail-gun and pretend I was brave. I had others, too, but that was the most memorable. Actors have hoards of superstitions to help them get by. Sports professionals have rituals before big games. How many brides won&#39;t let the groom see them in the dress? Those are alllll tricks for getting over a case of nerves. Congratulations! Your 3yo has figured that trick out already!

Yes, I am very susceptible to narrative, I give myself over to it very<br/>
easily and now protect myself from it and feel that I need to protect my son<br/>
as well.  My experience with stories has been both wonderful and terrible.<br/>
Some narratives that I internalized were very destructive and I want to<br/>
protect my son.  cant explain it other then to say that some narratives and<br/>
metaphors have held me captive, forcing me to reenact them over and over. Of<br/>
course there is much in my history that is not my sons.  My husband has a<br/>
very different experience with film then I do, he picks out visual or<br/>
auditory elements and ignores the story it doesn&#39;t bother him but some<br/>
stories irritate or upset me to the point I leave because I just am unable<br/>
to achieve the same distance. I get sucked into it.  And I wish that I&#39;d had<br/>
access to different stories as a child, rather then the stories that were<br/>
forced unto me and made me feel so imprisoned, many of them religious. So, I<br/>
don&#39;t want to trap my son in my fears. I let him choose. I support his<br/>
choices even when I can&#39;t understand them.<br/>
<br/>
Meredith comments about WWII reassured me somewhat, because it is the overly<br/>
simplistic theme of Batman that worries me.  But at three-years old is it a<br/>
good idea to see and enact such a repetitive good/evil theme over and over<br/>
and over? I wasn&#39;t belittling my son when I said he just reenacts the same<br/>
thing, but it does worry me. It doesn&#39;t seem like its enriching his<br/>
imagination, but stifling it.<br/>
<br/>
I love folktales, and even love Brothers Grimm which many people think is<br/>
terrible for children.  I don&#39;t read those stories to my son because he<br/>
isn&#39;t interested. I love Hans Christian Anderson. i wish I&#39;d had him as a<br/>
child. I don&#39;t know if my son will like him, I somehow doubt it.  I know hes<br/>
different from me. But these tales offer a level of complexity and richness<br/>
that Batman doesn&#39;t, though I do realize that such complexity is cognitively<br/>
beyond him right now. But perhaps the Batman does offer that complexity,<br/>
though not in its story.  Visually or in some other way perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
My son gets so into batman that his whole body tenses up and I can see that<br/>
emotions are overwhelming him. He seems to enjoy this. I just fear that such<br/>
intense experiences centered around a single simple idea have to be creating<br/>
some kind of chemical tendency...I&#39;m just worried that I&#39;m making a horrible<br/>
mistake. And I&#39;m feeling more worried then ever, rather then reassured as<br/>
I&#39;d hoped to feel after posting. But I&#39;ll give it a rest for now while still<br/>
welcoming any other thoughts,  Thanks again to all.<br/>

but when he was little I remembered my own passive seeming relationship with the <br/>
television and predicted that it was what his life would be like if I let him <br/>
watch television. I wanted to protect Simon from my own experience and when <br/>
other folks would tell me about how they don&#39;t let their children watch <br/>
television I would think with some kind of envy that they must be better parents <br/>
them me. The problem was that Simon enjoyed television. He liked Tellytubbies <br/>
and Bear in the Big Blue House and Blues Clues and Barney. He liked to sit in my <br/>
lap and have me enjoy the shows with him. He liked to talk about the things he&#39;s <br/>
seen, he liked to dance to the music, he liked to dance with me to the music. <br/>
And when I watched him watching the shows and when I engaged with him watching <br/>
the shows, I didn&#39;t see a passive seeming relationship, I saw an engaged and <br/>
happy little boy hanging out with his happy and engaged mum. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I was watching television as a child and as a teenager and as a young adult <br/>
I was often using it to relax, to zone, to obscure other aspects of my life. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t an addiction, it was a kind of self-medication, without really any <br/>
negative side effects. But people talked about me being helpless in front of the <br/>
television, and I believed them. I believed that it was an evil thing that <br/>
overpowered me, I accepted that narrative. You mention liking Hans Christian <br/>
Andersen. I reread the Snow Queen recently and thought a lot about how Kai&#39;s <br/>
changed perspective is about an evil entering him, an evil that is separate from <br/>
who he is, and how wonderfully passive that is. I don&#39;t buy into that narrative. <br/>
I don&#39;t believe that a happy little boy, living a good life in a garret with his <br/>
best friend across the balcony would be struck down by a piece of glass from an <br/>
evil mirror. But you seem to. Maybe back up and look at your happy boy enjoying <br/>
Batman (which is a really cool story) and let go of the notion that he is going <br/>
to be destroyed by a piece of glass that enters his heart and his eye. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525095813">There is so much here, and I couldn&#39;t read all of the other&#39;s responses.  But I had a few very clear thoughts as I read and felt prompted to contribute. <br/>
<br/>
From what I understand of the world and history, narrative has been a piece of human culture since... well since the birth of culture.  People tell stories, always have.  Its just the medium that has changed over time.  Narrative is used to explore uncomfortable, scary, bad, lovely, great, beautiful, wondrous ideas. Various mythologies, Shakespeare&#39;s plays, biblical stories, modern literature - they are all exploring what it means to be human through narrative.  I even dream in a sort of narrative.  If TV and books weren&#39;t around (since you don&#39;t seem to be afraid of the medium, but more the idea of narrative), your son might be play-acting the stories you passed down orally, or that he saw in theatre, or from other children&#39;s play.  This is one way to work through ideas that scare or delight us.  <br/>
<br/>
Repetitiveness is also very common in young children. My kids love to watch the same episodes of shows again and again, or read the same books over again, or sew the same embroidery, cook the same recipe, etc. (They also delight in new things to do).  My daughter goes through the same play-acting with me day in and out, with occasional changes.  Right now we are Alicia and Dora nearly every day all the time (and little brother is Baby Jaguar).  As it goes on for weeks at a time, it gets slightly more sophisticated... although I have to be paying attention to notice. <br/>
<br/>
I posit that this is the mental equivalent to what kids do on the jungle-gym, mental gymnastics, building/flexing their minds.  Following his cues is allowing him to build/flex his mind-muscle so much more than if you weren&#39;t following his cues.  Instead of shutting down that play, you are participating in its growth.  And I&#39;m fairly sure this is somewhat true, because my own mental flexibility has grown as I&#39;ve re-learned how to really play with my kids.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070811">-=- You mention liking Hans Christian <br/>
Andersen. I reread the Snow Queen recently...-=-<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to say something about Hans Christian Andersen and  Grimm&#39;s Fairy Tales.   The Grimms&#39; tales were collected from various places, and the stories were old and traditional.   Hans Christian Andersen was writing new stories in a kind-of-fairy-tale format.   His were little sculptures by one person, unlike the smoothed-by-generations stories in the Grimm collection and in the basic tales Charles Perrault was dealing with in France over a century before that.<br/>
<br/>
Oh hey.  Just found a site with sound files.    Nice.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://storynory.com/archives/fairy-tales/">http://storynory.com/archives/fairy-tales/</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;Fairy tale&quot; is the problem.  One general term for those sorts of stories puts Andersen in a category he probably shouldn&#39;t be in, as his weren&#39;t traditional.  That term doesn&#39;t exist in other languages, I don&#39;t think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-129965082">My son and I played Batman and Robin all afternoon with full abandon.  I<br/>
noticed quite a few things that I hadn&#39;t before.  One thing I noticed for<br/>
sure: My son does not take batman as seriously as I do. I&#39;m definitely going<br/>
to check out a comic book store, that&#39;s a great oh duh suggestion that I&#39;m<br/>
embarrassed not to have thought of.<br/>
<br/>
My fears have subsided somewhat and although I can&#39;t say they are resolved,<br/>
its almost as though my son responded to my fears through some aspect of our<br/>
play today.  It really amazed me. Once when he fell down he looked up at me<br/>
and made a funny wah wah wah sound while smiling gently at me, almost to<br/>
say, see, mom, it&#39;s ok. And he&#39;s only three.  I could give you more<br/>
examples, such an amazing afternoon, but hes taking a rare nap and I&#39;m off<br/>
to do dishes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read through everything and am going to let it all saturate. Thanks<br/>
again for all of your thoughtful responses.<br/>

When one or two adults is managing fifteen or twenty or more children, that&#39;s not the time to encourage a child to be rough, hit, or express a full range of emotions.<br/>

<br/>
School doesn&#39;t exist for the mental health of individual children, and one child&#39;s expression of rage can&#39;t be allowed to endanger another child, even if the other child somehow could have overtly and purposefully created the rage.  (And no child can create rage in another child anyway.)<br/>

one thing will lead to another and the world will be opened up to them. <br/>
Any interest can open doors to all kinds of other things.<br/>
<br/>
I think you SHOULD take it seriously - not in the way you mean it, <br/>
though. Take it seriously because your son loves it. Think about what <br/>
kind of message you are sending him if you act like there is something <br/>
wrong with his passionate interest. He will stop trusting his own <br/>
interests. He will feel guilty about them, like there is something wrong <br/>
with him for liking them. And he will eventually hide it from you.<br/>

There is a lot of negativity there.  &quot;HATED&quot; and &quot;morons&quot; are the worst of it.<br/>

<br/>
Opera is be definition people ALWAYS singing and not talking. :-)<br/>
<br/>
You seem to be suggesting that having been exposed to sing-songy voices closed you off to the possibility of liking opera. That it was external to you rather than your reactions and thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible you&#39;re just irritated by singing.  <br/>
<br/>
I sing, my kids sing, there&#39;s a lot of singing at our house, and my kids know some musical theatre (not classical opera much).   Yesterday I said &quot;Marty, Holly and I are going to see Gilbert and Sullivan at Popejoy, but I didn&#39;t invite you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said eagerly, &quot;Really?  Gilbert and Sullivan themselves are going to be at Popejoy!?&quot;  Very enthusiastically and sarcastically.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s on a Sunday at 3:00, the only showing, and he has something he always does on Sundays.  He asked which one it was and I said &quot;The Mikado,&quot; and he said &quot;Don&#39;t know it; don&#39;t care.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If it had been HMS Pinafore, you&#39;d&#39;ve wanted to go?&quot;  He shrugged positively and waggled his head some.<br/>
&quot;Pirates of Penzance?&quot; Nodded solidly.<br/>
He&#39;s 22.<br/>
<br/>
The day before, I had told him, &quot;When I go to England, I should forget modern stuff.  No Lion King or that.  I should go see Gilbert and Sullivan.&quot;  The next morning by e-mail there was an offering for tickets for a single local performance of a traveling show. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m telling that for a couple of reasons.   People ask, &quot;Yes, but HOW...&quot; about conversations and suggestions, and there&#39;s a fresh example.  <br/>
<br/>
Communicating things lightly and positively gives kids an opportunity to think on their own rather than to be reactive to a parent&#39;s suggestions or opinions or attitudes.  It&#39;s worth remembering.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I wrote &quot;It&#39;s possible you&#39;re just irritated by singing&quot; is that a girl I&#39;ve known since birth, a bit older than my kids, has two parents who are artists but not good singers.  She was very artistic as a kid--sculpted things, built things out of paper and cardboard and foil, drew.   When she was at our house she would sometimes say &quot;Stop singing,&quot; to my kids who didn&#39;t even realize they were singing.   She asked me once, &quot;Why are they always singing?&quot;   It just bugged her.  She preferred it quiet.<br/>
<br/>
The sing-songy voice is good to avoid, even for people who didn&#39;t mind it much as a child.   Here&#39;s a fun story:<br/>
<br/>
Even the nicest of words can be ruined, though, if they&#39;re spoken in a condescending, treacly way. It&#39;s not bad for infants, and it&#39;s great for French poodles. It&#39;s that talking-to-a-French-poodle voice, and the thoughts that go with it, that should be avoided when parents are talking to their children. Dan Vilter shared this story on the AlwaysLearning list in 2001:<br/>
<br/>
At a park day, we were having a discussion about the usefulness of praise and sincerity. The unschoolers in the group were trying to point out the fallacy of over and insincere praise, and indirectly about treating your children as people first. After much talk getting nowhere, one of the other unschooling parents turned to me and in the French poodle voice started thanking me for all the things I had done for the group that day. Something like,&quot;Oh Dan, thank you for bringing the stove for hot cocoa. You did such a good job setting it up and heating the water! You&#39;re so strong carrying that big jug of water all by yourself!&quot; Everyone had a good laugh and the point was succinctly made.<br/>

I know a couple families who&#39;ve been rejected by Waldorf schools because their kids were energetic, explorative types. I&#39;ve heard of kids being kicked out of those schools, too, for behavior issues. <br/>
<br/>
I mention that lest someone think there&#39;s something special in the Steiner approach that lets them *create* gentle children out of a mixed bag of personalities. Unschooling, otoh, is applicable to All children ;)<br/>
