<br/>
I believe that there is a sense of &quot;Look what I&#39;ve achieved. I am special, I am better than these mere mortals....I deserve what ever it is I want because I can pull millions of people into the box office or to the concert hall. These people love me and I am a god!<br/>
<br/>
I really think there&#39;s a sense of that. Look at some of the actions! Sylvester Stallone broke up w/ his live in girlfriend via a fax! That one really got me!!<br/>
There&#39;s a sense that because these people are famous, their words carry more weight, or they are absolved from certain responsibilities. That&#39;s crap! If a person is living in the public eye - they should behave accordingly. Would it have killed Tom Cruise to quietly talk w/ Nicole? Would it have killed him to respect her? Couldn&#39;t he have used discretion and patience? Did he have to let her know long distance? Couldn&#39;t he have waited before jumping into the limelight w/ Penelope Cruz? And her....look at her record...she&#39;s had an affair w/ most of her leading men? What does all of this say about her?<br/>
It&#39;s a lack of respect; it&#39;s an lack of responsibility.<br/>
And w/ Tom Cruise - anyway - I simply won&#39;t go see his work - not that I was ever a big fan.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I expalin this ok.<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;m being judgemental. I think I&#39;m &quot;voting with my pocketbook&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh boy, I feel myself tensing up at this one. I fully comprehend what you are <br/>
saying Jana, my issue is that unless you are Nicoles sister, mother or best <br/>
friend, how would you know what actually transpired? Even then stories are <br/>
often skewed to make one party appear in better light than the other. I mean just <br/>
because People or Rolling Stone say something doesn&#39;t make it the full story. <br/>
Besides which, when they made that stupid flick together, which title escapes <br/>
me now, where they were the married couple and he got into that alternative <br/>
sex scene, it became public that they got a sex therapist to help them with <br/>
those parts for the movie. Hello, red flag!!! The day I need someone&#39;s help making <br/>
love to my husband, I should be aware that we have some issues. That was long <br/>
before their break up. Needless to say that she met Tom while he was married <br/>
to his first wife, and while he was her leading man in that other stupid flick <br/>
they did about race car driving. What goes around, comes around as the saying <br/>
goes.<br/>
<br/>
Tom and Nicole&#39;s marriage is none of our business just because they are in <br/>
the lime light of Hollywood, just as it isn&#39;t our business whether the President <br/>
is doing an intern or not. Either way it doesn&#39;t change anything in my daily <br/>
life nor my pocket book. Watch or don&#39;t watch, listen or don&#39;t listen, vote or <br/>
don&#39;t vote, spend or don&#39;t spend. Frankly, I&#39;m sick and tired of judgements. <br/>
He said, she said, we never know the truth and why should we? Is it because we <br/>
have become a world obsessed by gossip. And what about one man&#39;s vice is <br/>
another mans virtue? For instance, a devout Catholic may find divorce an <br/>
abhorition to the word of God, but to a Pagan it may simply mean moving on in lifes <br/>
lessons. <br/>
<br/>
Ok, said my peace, not trying to prolong the argument, but I had to get that <br/>
out.<br/>

Before I moved here to the boonies and married an organic vegetable farmer, I was an actress/director in NY and Boston.  I knew a lot of clebrities.  My best friend in acting school was Lisa Roberts, sister to Julia and Eric Roberts.  There were lots of others as well. <br/>
<br/>
***** They aren&#39;t private people - they gave up some of that right to privacy in their quest to be celebrities****.  I promise you, many celebrities are celebrities by default.

Don&#39;t you think that there are those who would love to dissect what unschoolers do  (and do dissect it) without any real first hand knowledge of what we do, just based upon sensationalized stories?  I don&#39;t believe that most celebrities think they are &quot;Gods&quot;.  I think they are often just trying to hang onto some sense of who they are underneath all the bogus identities thrown upon them.  Granted they don&#39;t always do it very gracefully but I don&#39;t think I could either.  It can be a rough life.  I&#39;m glad to be on a farm with my kids and not there.  : )<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am very disgusted w/ Tom Cruise. According to an interview w/ Nicole<br/>
Kidman, she knew they were having problems, but she had been assured and she<br/>
believed that the problems were not major. As a matter of fact - the<br/>
interior design for their newest home was - she thought - the biggest<br/>
problem.<br/>
He dumped her - in full view of the world.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do understand what you are saying. But again I would just like for people<br/>
to see that there is so much more to people&#39;s lives that what we see. I&#39;ll<br/>
get personal here to try and prove a point. My first marriage ended with me,<br/>
after 10 years saying I needed out. Just took off and moved to my moms and 6<br/>
months later moved in with a younger guy. Looked pretty slimy because my ex<br/>
was lamenting about me leaving and taking his child and how much he loved me<br/>
and we were his whole life. His family, my family and all our friends<br/>
couldn&#39;t understand why I did what I did. I was a pretty private person. I<br/>
kept my problems to myself and the therapist. I was trying for 2 years to<br/>
get him to go to counselling with me. And I do mean 2 years. I was begging<br/>
for him to realize we had a problem. He was not helpful, understanding,<br/>
supportive or respectful &quot;of me.&quot; To everyone else he was a great guy. He<br/>
really was. When I just didn&#39;t love him anymore after 2 exasperating years,<br/>
I left. Everyone, absolutely everyone was shocked. We had such a perfect<br/>
marriage. To everyone else but us. I looked like the bad guy. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
until years later and through therapy I realized I was abused. Not<br/>
physically, but getting hit would have been easier for me than what he was<br/>
doing. One just never knows what goes on behind closed doors. (didn&#39;t mean<br/>
to sound like a CW song)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If a person is living in the public eye - they should behave accordingly.<br/>
Would it have killed Tom Cruise to quietly talk w/ Nicole? Would it have<br/>
killed him to respect her? Couldn&#39;t he have used discretion and patience?<br/>
Did he have to let her know long distance? Couldn&#39;t he have waited before<br/>
jumping into the limelight w/ Penelope Cruz? And her....look at her<br/>
record...she&#39;s had an affair w/ most of her leading men? What does all of<br/>
this say about her?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do agree that people in the public do have some responsibility to act<br/>
differently in public. I&#39;ve heard public people even say the same thing. If<br/>
they can&#39;t handle it, then get out. I also believe that &quot;stars&quot; get paid<br/>
ridiculous amounts of money for what they do. I love a good actor and<br/>
appreciate their ability. I could never do that. But a million dollars or<br/>
more for one movie? I think that&#39;s excessive. And I also think that goes<br/>
hand in hand with what they think of themselves and how they act. But again,<br/>
private lives and what and how they do it are something different. You use<br/>
Tom Cruise as an example. He probably could have been more respectful and<br/>
patient. But again we don&#39;t know the whole story and maybe he just had<br/>
enough and didn&#39;t know any other way to get out. Maybe he is just a<br/>
slimeball, but we can&#39;t say either for sure unless we know him. And P. Cruz,<br/>
did she really have affairs with most of her leading men or just go out with<br/>
them or have her picture taken? Was she bedding them all? I don&#39;t see where<br/>
star public behavior really says a lot about them at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-539935658">One thing I did like was Nicole on Oprah, saying that she didn&#39;t want to<br/>
go into details about the breakup because her children would be able to<br/>
read it in the media in the future, and Tom was still their father.<br/>
Reading what seem like details from odd sources makes me wonder how much<br/>
of it is genuine and not just speculation or subjective. I think that as<br/>
celebrities get older most of them get more circumspect than when they<br/>
were young and hungry for publicity to help their rise. It seems like<br/>
many of the celebs who are &quot;media shy&quot; have had a bad experience of<br/>
being misquoted or manipulated in some early interview. Perhaps they<br/>
didn&#39;t realize how others saw them, and the &quot;truth&quot; as the reporter saw<br/>
it, upset them. One responsibility that celebrities have is to be<br/>
gracious to members of the public whenever possible. The old stars were<br/>
taught that I think, and accepted it as part of the territory. But<br/>
reporters weren&#39;t climbing trees with zoom lenses in the same way<br/>
either. (Well maybe Hedda Hopper figuratively speaking).<br/>
<br/>
What responsibility celebrities have to the world in general, and the<br/>
use and abuse of access to the media, are some issues I have been<br/>
thinking about a lot since the Gulf War began. I haven&#39;t any answer yet,<br/>
and I&#39;m glad I wasn&#39;t a contestant in Miss America (or whatever pageant<br/>
it was) recently when one of the questions was &quot;should celebrities use<br/>
their status to speak out on political issues&quot;. I think this is a<br/>
question that anyone who has access to the media will probably consider<br/>
- even if vaguely, say along the lines of: &quot;What an idiot that guy is.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another issue I have pondered for a long time, is how an artist&#39;s<br/>
political stance and their private personality affects their work,<br/>
whether it is or should be relevant or not (Picasso&#39;s &quot;Guernica&quot; is not<br/>
lessened just because he was a misogynist dickhead - or is it???)  This<br/>
first came up for me when my enjoyment of Jane Austen  was severely<br/>
curtailed in 10th grade, by our English teacher giving us a lengthy<br/>
expose on the absence of the underclasses and lack of critique of social<br/>
inequities in &quot;Persuasion&quot; and others. This brought up the question of<br/>
whether an artist always has the mandate to seek social change in their<br/>
work. It took me a few years after leaving school to get to back to<br/>
enjoying Austen. I notice that many of the movie representations seek to<br/>
address this glaring problem in her work by having servants in the<br/>
backgrounds.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in college studying Creative Arts (what USA would call Fine<br/>
Arts) one of the topics lectured about was that &quot;Is All Art Political?&quot;<br/>
I remember it was a bit circuitous - begging the question if Art is<br/>
first defined as a political statement, as it was by some of the<br/>
teachers. <br/>

<br/>
But if a picture makes $100 million, who should get it? It&#39;s the actors and<br/>
director (and sometimes the special effects people ;-) who are pretty much<br/>
responsible for whether the movie brings in money or not.<br/>
<br/>
Their pay is in relation to what the studios expect to make off of their<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
Same with sports figures. Everyone complains about how much they make, but<br/>
the franchises are bringing in huge amounts of money. Advertisers and<br/>
consumers are the ones responsible for giving them all the money in the<br/>
first place. So where should it go? It&#39;s not like anyone holds a gun to<br/>
someone&#39;s head and makes them pay $200 for a jacket with a licensed image on<br/>
it, or makes them pay $1.6 million for 30 seconds of air time during the<br/>
Superbowl.<br/>

<br/>
For starters I would say some of the people that hardly get acknowledged<br/>
that do work on the sets. People that are there a lot longer than the<br/>
&quot;stars&quot; and work their butts off. Costumers, make up artists, grips,<br/>
caterers, etc. I really think they deserve more than they get. They also can<br/>
get the bad end of the starts temperaments too.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the rest, I&#39;m not sure really. In sports I think some of the<br/>
players do deserve some of the money they get. If nothing else, their health<br/>
is put on the line more than some of us. I&#39;ve seen older football starts.<br/>
They can be pretty crippled up. I know no one makes them do it, but it&#39;s<br/>
something they love and I think turning pro makes them play a little longer<br/>
than they would normally. I mean it&#39;s their job and it&#39;s scary to have to<br/>
quit.<br/>
<br/>
Sure would be nice if they could set up some kind of cap on major money<br/>
makers and have them donate a percentage. So many charities out there could<br/>
benefit. That will never happen though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Like what?<br/>
I can&#39;t think of any legal harassment that could happen to them that would <br/>
not also be legal if it happened to little-old-me.<br/>
HeidiWD <br/>
<br/>
Well, I was thinking specifically of this little item:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) Any person who willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows or harasses <br/>
another person commits the offense of stalking, a misdemeanor of the first <br/>
degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. <br/>
<br/>
But because it&#39;s done by the media, it&#39;s legal.<br/>
<br/>
If someone followed you, pried at your life and wouldn&#39;t leave you alone, it <br/>
would be considered stalking.<br/>
But because a person is famous, and considered newsworthy, that suddenly <br/>
brings us back to constitutional rights. It doesn&#39;t make it right though.<br/>
