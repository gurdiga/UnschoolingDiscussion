<div id="ygrps-yiv-686763068">Hi Susan,<br/>
I don&#39;t know if anybody has answered this. I just got back online after a few <br/>
weeks off, so I&#39;m trying to catch up :o)<br/>
I sent in one NOI when my oldest son was 6 (almost 7), he&#39;s 13 now. That was <br/>
my last dealing with the state. I now belong to West River Academy. Peggy <br/>
started it for unschoolers. Once a year I send her a list of what we do. I usually <br/>
just take it off of the calendar: classes, field trips, appts., etc. She then <br/>
would use those to make a transcript, if I ever needed one. She also provides <br/>
HS diplomas if your kids are interested in them. You also don&#39;t have to test <br/>
or evaluate, unless you choose. Here is her web site:<br/>

<br/>
CO is a really homeschool friendly state, as far as the law is concerned, <br/>
even if you think it should be more like Texas :o)<br/>
If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask away. I used to be a <br/>
homeschool liaison here in CO.<br/>

Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
My family and I currently live in California, but are considering a <br/>
move to Colorado.  Do any of you have any information or first-hand <br/>
experience with unschooling in Colorado?  In particular, my main <br/>
concern in the state mandated testing.  We have none of that in CA <br/>
and the thought of subjecting my kids to standardized tests is quite <br/>
bothersome!  Any info is much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
TIA - Susan<br/>
