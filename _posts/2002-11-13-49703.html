<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The following poem caught my eye as I browsed through a product catalog.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The author is unknown but appears to have been published in a book<br/>
<br/>
&gt; called &quot;Sensory Secrets: How to Jump Start Learning in Children&quot;. You<br/>
<br/>
&gt; may already be familiar with it. It reminded me of your work. I hope<br/>
<br/>
&gt; you enjoy it:<br/>

<br/>
&gt; PLAY WITH ME<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I tried to teach my child with books;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; He gave me only puzzled looks;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I tried to teach my child with words;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; They passed him by, oft unheard.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Despairingly I turned aside;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; :How shall I teach this child!&quot; I cried<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Into my hand he put the key;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; :Come,&quot; he said, &quot;play with me.&quot;<br/>
