<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029213131">I have been letting the kids self regulate for several years now.  If I make<br/>
a dinner and make them plates, they can eat what they want and leave the<br/>
rest.  I try to stock the house with healthy foods and foods easy to grab or<br/>
prepare (bananas, apples, grapes, melon, crackers, peanut butter, cereal,<br/>
milk, juices, baby carrots, broccoli, yogurts, whole wheat bread, sliced<br/>
turkey breast or ham, etc).  DD will eat these things, but when left to her<br/>
own devices (which she is, 99.9% of the time) she will eat cereal, ice<br/>
cream, popsicles, cookies, gum, anything sweet before she&#39;ll eat the healthy<br/>
stuff.  If there isn&#39;t anything sweet in the house (we ran out, they didn&#39;t<br/>
ask when we were at the store, or whatever) she&#39;ll eat the chocolate chips<br/>
in the baking cupboard or make sticky sweet lemonade from lemon juice,<br/>
sugar, and water.  Or she&#39;ll ask to make cookies.  If there&#39;s truly nothing<br/>
sweet (we don&#39;t have all of the ingredients for cookies), she is grumpy and<br/>
begs to go to the store for something sweet (even if the house has other<br/>
good, fresh, healthy alternatives).<br/>
<br/>
I understand where she&#39;s at:  I, too, am a sugar addict and have been since<br/>
I was a child.  Now that I&#39;m an adult, I still find it hard to self regulate<br/>
(though I tend to eat healthy stuff during the day and snack on the junk at<br/>
night when the kids are in bed; you know, trying to set a good example).  I<br/>
personally feel 1000% better if I eliminate sugar and refined flour from my<br/>
diet, with limited pasta.  I can eat sweet fruits with no problems.  It<br/>
seems to be the refined stuff that&#39;s the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone who has had a child with a sweet tooth seen them self regulate<br/>
after unlimited access to all foods?  I haven&#39;t seen it completely happen<br/>
with my dd.  I&#39;m wondering if certain people process these refined flours<br/>
and sugars differently making it harder to self regulate (when your body is<br/>
screaming for sugar, it&#39;s hard to ignore!!)<br/>

&gt; snacks (except omit peanut butter..too dangerous for<br/>
&gt; allowing free access)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why is peanut butter dangerous?<br/>
<br/>
I struggle with food issues. I know how I want to handle things, but I<br/>
don&#39;t always live up to it. I struggled with bulimia and anorexia in my<br/>
teens and early twenties, although I&#39;m really over it now. I eat what I<br/>
want at the time, I don&#39;t worry about calories, and I trust my body to<br/>
crave what it needs. And it works... however, I&#39;m 5&#39;8&quot; and about 130<br/>
pounds, so it&#39;s pretty easy for me to talk.  My mom was constantly on a<br/>
diet, my sister went on her first diet at 5 and ate nothing but celery<br/>
and water chestnuts, stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
Cacie, OTOH, was a 9 pound baby and has always been big, tall and heavy<br/>
and solid. My friends tell me she&#39;s not fat, but I have some skewed<br/>
perceptions and I think she is sometimes. Actually, she was a chubby baby<br/>
and toddler and 3 yr old, and ever since then she&#39;s gained a bunch of<br/>
weight and then grown a lot taller, so to me she looks chubby for a<br/>
while, then she grows taller and looks average, then it all repeats. <br/>
<br/>
Last Septemeber she apparently gained 20 pounds in a couple of months,<br/>
and weighed 102 pounds at 4&#39;9&quot;. She was 8... and she looked fat to me,<br/>
she had a big belly, and I had a really hard time with it. I really do<br/>
think it was mostly her natural growth pattern  again, because she just<br/>
seemee constantly starving,  but there was also a lot of food around that<br/>
we didn&#39;t usually eat, mostly processed snack foods like chips and kudos<br/>
bars and stuff like that... plus we were all busy and stressed, and so<br/>
for whatever reasons, she ate a ton of &quot;junk food&quot; and gained that<br/>
weight. <br/>
<br/>
I had a really hard time with it, probably more than when she was little<br/>
because it&#39;s not cute and chubby anymore, she ws developing physically<br/>
and it was preteen and chubby. I did start to realize how much I still<br/>
bought into the ideas that fat was ugly and bad, and fat wasn&#39;t  as good<br/>
as thin and all that, especially with my own kid. I felt ashamed that she<br/>
was fat. I have friends who are overweight, and somehow I don&#39;t feel the<br/>
same was about them - I&#39;ve tried to talk them out of going to Weight<br/>
Watchers, I think because I was afraid they&#39;d develop an eating disorder,<br/>
now that I look back on it.... another branch on thsi whole issue.<br/>
<br/>
 I really struggled with limiting food for Cacie - I wanted to, but I<br/>
also knew it was the wrong thing for me to do, I didn&#39;t want to give her<br/>
a complex about what she ate, I didn&#39;t want food to be an issue like<br/>
that. I faltered a few times but recovered, basically. I did consciously<br/>
do some things, like make sure I was cooking healthy, filling meals that<br/>
she liked, and offering to do things with her that were physically active<br/>
(and she&#39;s always been very physically active, she loves soccer and<br/>
softball and football and stilting and hiking, all of it). They were<br/>
optional, of course, but they were things she liked and she almost always<br/>
took me up on it, and  I felt better, it gave me some fuel against my<br/>
inner tapes... but I was almsot always clear that it was my issue, my<br/>
problem, she was fine, happy, and healthy...<br/>
<br/>
So, now Cacie&#39;s grown an inch or two, I think; she looks taller and<br/>
slimmer again. She&#39;s not constantly hungry... and it&#39;s easier for me, I<br/>
feel like I&#39;ve gone through the gauntlet. Maybe next time I&#39;ll be better,<br/>
I don&#39;t know. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148467311">Anyone heard of Ellyn Satter&#39;s &quot;How to Get Your Kid to Eat, But Not Too<br/>
Much?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I read it nearly 8 years ago, but I remember thinking that she had a lot<br/>
of great stuff to say about the benefits of parents NOT controlling their<br/>
kid&#39;s eating from the very beginning, the psychology of eating, what is a<br/>
&quot;normal&quot; body size/type, etc.  Her bottom line is that it is the parent&#39;s<br/>
job to provide the food and the kid&#39;s job to eat... or not eat.  Reading<br/>
her book also helped me get over some of my own food hang-ups.<br/>
<br/>
Pudginess before a growth spurt is normal for children, with some getting<br/>
more pudge than others.  Although extreme overweight is a risk factor for<br/>
several common American diseases, there are also skinny people having<br/>
heart attacks, strokes, or other health problems.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, now I remember the other book I read that dealt with this issue! <br/>
Mother Dance, by Harriet Lerner.  She is a psychologist.  I found the<br/>
book hilarious and insightful on the issue of motherhood.  One of her<br/>
chapters deals with food and she tells of her own experience with<br/>
&quot;de-controlling&quot; her sons&#39; eating.  Very interesting.  At one point her<br/>
son ended up sneaking grapes at a buffet bc the parents were boycotting<br/>
something that had to do with grape-growing industry and would not allow<br/>
grapes in the house.  Sneaking food has more to do with control than with<br/>
whether the food is &quot;healthy&quot; or not.<br/>
