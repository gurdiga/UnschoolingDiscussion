I am new too and haven&#39;t started yet but I have a similar<br/>
situation.  My husband is very disciplined and likes<br/>
structure so we compromise.  I need my kids to have a<br/>
regular bedtime for my sanity.  We allow them to stay up<br/>
later on weekends but they still have to be in be by 9:30.<br/>
I usually allow two of the three to sleep later on<br/>
Saturdays.  I think you should introduce some structured<br/>
time into each day where your son knows he has certain<br/>
things he needs to accomplish in that period.  If your<br/>
husband sees an improvement in your son he is more likely to<br/>
support the less structured schooling. It may be that your<br/>
husband wants more adult time with you and having children<br/>
up late seems to prevent adult conversation without<br/>
distractions. Just my thoughts.<br/>

Hi and welcome.  You have come to the right place for support, and you are <br/>
going to get lots of feed back.  I just want to say that both my sons, 9 and <br/>
11, and I are night people.  We stay up late and sleep late.  We have always <br/>
done this.  My husband works late most nights, we eat dinner VERY late, when <br/>
the boys are in sports, their practice and games can get us home and eating, <br/>
therefore up late. When the boys were about 8 and 10 my husband started to <br/>
have a problem with the getting up late.  I asked him why they needed to get <br/>
up.  His response was that they needed to get up and get the day going, or <br/>
that they needed to learn to get up.  Again I asked why, if they have to get <br/>
up early for something, they do, but why should they if we get our work done <br/>
during the day?  If it is because someday they will have to work, well, so <br/>
what, that is why the world runs on shifts!  I worked 3-11 and 11-7 all my <br/>
working career, cause I hate to go to bed at 9pm and get up at 5:30am.  <br/>
People work from home, set their own hours. There are to many alternatives.  <br/>
So, why get up early? If it is so we can get school out of the way, and then <br/>
have the day to go play, that is fine, and we do that, but not just because <br/>
you should be up by 8am cause that is what people do.  So, now he doesn&#39;t say <br/>
anything, I don&#39;t know if he agrees with me or not, but he doesn&#39;t say <br/>
anything.  I think he secretly thinks it is being lazy or unchristian to stay <br/>
in bed. hehehe<br/>
Anyway, my two cents, and again, welcome<br/>
Teresa</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-310120821">Dear Kim,<br/>
              Reading your letter, I felt like Wow! she really has it <br/>
together!  You may not realize it but you are already doing the most <br/>
important thing in Unschooling- you are listening to your child!  You have <br/>
already figured out how he learns and that&#39;s another important thing to know. <br/>
 I think if you follow your obviously good instincts, you are going to do <br/>
great!  Your husband may take longer to trust that your son is learning since <br/>
he learns differently than either of you. But as time goes on, I&#39;m sure he <br/>
will see the wonderful results of unschooling!  jackie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983214611">Hi Kim,<br/>
            The beauty of home/unschooling is the flexability. My kids do<br/>
some of there best learning at 10 P.M. and sleeping as late as we want<br/>
allows all of us to start our day well rested and refreshed. Of course, you<br/>
have to do what works best for your family, but I know more families than<br/>
not that find listening to their bodies instead of watching the clock makes<br/>
them better learners. Good Luck.<br/>

&gt; son is 8 & 1/2 and has been home since about Feb 1.  He was in public<br/>
&gt; school (3rd grade) in Arkansas.  I am so interested in doing this for<br/>

&gt; school!  I need some advice and feedback, I think.  My husband is<br/>
&gt; very, very supportive of all of this, but is having trouble with the<br/>
&gt; &quot;unstructuredness&quot; of it all.  Both my son and I are similar in that<br/>
&gt; we are very unstructured, spontaneous learners, where my husband is<br/>
&gt; completely the opposite..very methodical, very routine-oriented.  I<br/>
&gt; am trying NOT to push my son.  He is resisting ANY schooling right<br/>
&gt; now.  All he seems to want to do is play video games and watch TV!<br/>
&gt; He hates to write, for one thing.  Which is one thing he detested<br/>
&gt; about school.  I haven&#39;t seemed to find the &quot;spark&quot; for him yet.<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s interested in EVERYTHING, it seems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756028938">Hi Help!<br/>
<br/>
In my not-so-humble opinion, there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with your<br/>
son staying up late and sleeping late.  From birth, none of my 3<br/>
children were sleepers.  They were all nighthawks.  Our schedule,<br/>
therefore, has been quite &quot;off&quot; for the last 10 years.  For the longest<br/>
while I thought we were freaks and had to deal with constant criticism<br/>
that somehow my children would not thrive unless bedded down by 9 pm the<br/>
latest, and up by 7 am.  I hate to disappoint the world, but kids grow<br/>
just as tall and are just as healthy, watching midnight programming and<br/>
often missing mornings altogether.  (Though there are times when my<br/>
children experience sunrises-particularly at this time of year as the<br/>
days are getting longer-simply because they have been up all night!) <br/>
The good news is, I have recently aligned myself with a group of<br/>
unschoolers here in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and to my great surprise<br/>
many of my cohorts have come clean and confessed to the same schedule! <br/>
(i.e. late nights, late mornings)  Then a big-wig university professor<br/>
from the faculty of education no less, proudly announced that his<br/>
unschooled daughter was up past midnight every night watching the late<br/>
movies!  And she had better English than any of her peers!  She had a<br/>
much greater command of language, from a young age, just from watching<br/>
and hearing the dramatic dialogue in some of the world&#39;s most classic<br/>
movies.  (I think she&#39;s in university now as an English major)  Anyway,<br/>
I&#39;ve also come to realize that we non-conforming unschoolers DO have<br/>
routine worked-out with our kids.  If being in bed by 8 and up by 6 is a<br/>
routine, why isn&#39;t being in bed by 1 and up at 11? People who work the<br/>
late shift aren&#39;t on a routine?  But 9 to 5-ers are? What kind of<br/>
discrimination is that?  The other thing I&#39;ve learned from my university<br/>
prof friend is people get up in the morning when they have incentive. <br/>
For instance, his formerly late-night daughter does not object to<br/>
getting up early now for class because she has found what she truly<br/>
loves.  And face it, money i.e. a job, can be a great motivator too when<br/>
necessary.<br/>
Your son will be fine and will thrive if this is what he needs right<br/>
now.  It&#39;s not to say this is how it will always be.  And as time goes<br/>
on if he decides he hates mornings, he&#39;ll be primed for late shift duty<br/>
on the job.  In the meantime, rest assured you&#39;re in good company.  At<br/>
least up here in Canada!<br/>
<br/>
Sonia<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Did I mention how great it is for family time when the kids stay<br/>
up late?  Firstly, my 10 and 7 year olds have established the most<br/>
intimate and loving relationship with their 17 mo. old baby sibling<br/>
since they stay up with him.  If I insisted my older ones get to bed<br/>
earlier they would miss out on some of the baby&#39;s best moods.  Obviously<br/>
traditional schooling and same schedule would greatly hamper that whole<br/>
bonding process.  And secondly, we find we don&#39;t have the usual<br/>
disturbances of phones, appointments, other people, etc. after 10 pm. <br/>
We can then have our quiet bonding down time, undisturbed.  Family<br/>
closeness is usually the number one reason for homeschooling.<br/>

<br/>
we find that this works for our family as well.  i love our private time in the<br/>
mornings.  our son is only 4 1/2 but he has always prefers to go to sleep<br/>
between 11 and 12 while i prefer 10ish so we taught him how to put himself to<br/>
bed.   now when he wants to stay up later than we do he can (he does share our<br/>
bed).  he enjoys the freedom and independence and i really believe that he<br/>
experiences profound respect and thoughtfulness and is learning how to return<br/>
that to others.  this is one of things we would love for him to learn.<br/>

of on summer vacation.<br/>
They are allowed to play outside until about 10pm and sleep in until <br/>
8-9 am.<br/>
This works out particularily well for me with my MS because with dh<br/>
working shifts and mornings being my best time of day (energy wise, heat<br/>
is the enemy in summer)) it&#39;s lovely when he get&#39;s home after nightshift<br/>
(about 6:30am) and we get some quality *snuggle* time.<br/>

about 5:30. Meggy on the other hand loves to stay up till all hours, like her <br/>
mama&lt;g&gt; I stopped fighting and now enjoy having her up. She really comes <br/>
alive after 9 and gets very creative and artistic. Since I do most of my <br/>
writing after 9, I can relate! The other night she made a life-size sculpture <br/>

We head to bed about midnight and If I want to sleep in my own bed I merely <br/>
wait her out.<br/>

I have one son who&#39;s nearly six and he often stays up til midnight or even <br/>

problems when I was in school. In high school I often missed my first 2 <br/>
classes, and when I was there I was a zombie. I feel strongly that we should <br/>
follow our own rythms, but I&#39;ve often felt self conscious when freinds or <br/>

hear that there are others who would back me up!<br/>

What is it with the world and the waking up early thing?! My gang wakes up <br/>
9ish-the 13 yo is another matter-he would wake up at noon and stay up till <br/>
2am which IO wouldn&#39;t mind -moving furniture, etc.-except we have a tiny <br/>
house and he acts as if it is the middle of the day at Midnight and we have a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851435138">First, hello to all. I was on this list a while ago, but had to unsub<br/>
because of all the email. I couldn&#39;t take it anymore and missed the support<br/>
and info!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
My son (9yo) and daughter (4 1/2 yo) also have &#39;different&#39; hours  :-) At<br/>
about 9:30 or 10:00 a certain energy comes over our house. Nicholas and<br/>
Emily sometimes get a project out and start working on it, or maybe a game,<br/>
or sometimes we all read or talk, maybe doing dishes and a late batch of<br/>
cookies, who knows! Some of our best discussions happen in the evening.<br/>
Saturday nights are usually late ones, last night the kids got to sleep<br/>
about 12:30, but Nicholas woke up at about 9:15 and Emily rose at 10:00.<br/>
They are well rested and having a blast right now. Nicholas seems to need<br/>
less sleep than me at times. There are some nights that they end up in bed<br/>
at 9:30 or 10:00. I think it&#39;s all following their natural schedule.<br/>
Sometimes they know that it&#39;s a get-to-bed early night as they may be a<br/>
little more tired than usual.<br/>
<br/>
Emily, probably because of her age, gets to sleep shortly after we&#39;re done<br/>
reading to her at night. Nicholas, on the other hand, listens to some of<br/>
Emily&#39;s stories ( I think he like the American Girls books just as much as<br/>
we do!) then starts reading his book. He&#39;s been hooked on the Redwall books<br/>
lately, and stays up for an hour or two after Emily, reading. Reading<br/>
reading reading. DH and myself comment at times at what the heck would we<br/>
have done if we had the opportunity to read like that. How wonderful that<br/>
would be. I remember getting so &#39;into&#39; a Stephen King book when I was in<br/>
high school that I stayed home from school for three days to finish it. Now<br/>
the schools make kids read for homework-a chore???? Nicholas and Emily get<br/>
absolutely baffled when they hear a child say they have to read a certain<br/>
book for homework. Yesterday Nicholas crawled back into bed after breakfast<br/>
( this was at about 11:00) and read until almost 2:00. The weather was too<br/>
nice to stay inside any longer....<br/>
<br/>
I agree that when there is something that someone needs to get up early for,<br/>
the will do it. We are ever changing and evolving. Schedules, plans,<br/>
interests.......I say relax and enjoy it. A lot of people don&#39;t understand<br/>
it. I know that I couldn&#39;t possibly make my kids go to bed at 9:00, it would<br/>
be torture. ESPECIALLY with the days getting longer, we are out in the<br/>
garden usually until 9:30 or later! The kids are happy, and I figure that<br/>
something must be going right  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
