<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769338636">My daughter never really was a big fan of taking baths or showers, <br/>
and it was never much of an issue because a young child who doesn&#39;t <br/>
produce body odor CAN go days without showers and it&#39;s not a huge <br/>
deal.  <br/>
<br/>
But now that she&#39;s getting older (11), she smells pretty bad and has <br/>
greasy hair if she goes a few days without a shower.  I&#39;ve talked to <br/>
her about the importance of regular bathing.  She doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>
fair that she has to take a bath regularly and I pointed out that <br/>
it&#39;s not just her, it&#39;s ALL people past a certain age who will smell <br/>
if they don&#39;t stay clean.  I told her that people might think poorly <br/>
of her if she smells bad and has greasy looking hair.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried getting her nice soaps and shower gels(she likes that when <br/>
they&#39;re new but the novelty wears off soon and she doesn&#39;t care <br/>
anymore), I offered to light candles for her (she says she doesn&#39;t <br/>
care about candles), I offered to take a shower with her and we could <br/>
wash each other&#39;s backs (she said no)...<br/>
<br/>
So my question is, how much would you remind/try to convince an 11 <br/>
year old to shower?  For example, I noticed on Thursday that she <br/>
really needed a shower, so I suggested it to her.  She said, &quot;Maybe <br/>
later&quot;.  So I reminded her again later in the day (like 9 pm) and she <br/>
said, &quot;later&quot;.  She never did.  Friday she was REALLY smelling bad, <br/>
and I told her that.  She said, &quot;later&quot;.  I reminded her again, and <br/>
she said, &quot;First thing tomorrow morning, I promise&quot;.  Saturday <br/>
morning she didn&#39;t shower.  Nor did she all day Saturday.  Today, I <br/>
said, &quot;How about if you take a shower and then pick out some nail <br/>
polish and I&#39;ll paint your toenails after your shower?  So she did.  <br/>
<br/>
Am I nagging too much?  If I remind her once and she doesn&#39;t do it, <br/>
should I keep reminding her or just let it go?  What about the issue <br/>
of body odor and not wanting other people to look down on her?  <br/>

IF my kids stink, I&#39;m probably going to ask them, do you want to take <br/>
a shower or a bath? Do they want to take it in my bathroom or theirs? <br/>
Not *IF* they will take one. But then, they are 3 and 6.<br/>

<h4>Homeschool</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-125311842">This is my first reply on this list.  So, I hope I&#39;m doing it correctly.  I<br/>
just<br/>
had to write when Sandra asked if there were any other families that<br/>
had been unschooling for a while, and didn&#39;t have a problem with <br/>
showers.  We don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If we are going out somewhere, my two, (almost 10, and 11) just<br/>
automatically shower.  And since, we are going somewhere almost<br/>
everyday, they shower daily.   It&#39;s never been an issue, and I&#39;m sitting<br/>
here<br/>
asking myself why.  Maybe it&#39;s because I always gave them baths before<br/>
we went out, when they were younger.  They have very thick hair, and the<br/>
only way to make it look brushed, was to condition it.  So, if you&#39;re going<br/>
to wash the hair, you might as well wash the whole kid.  There were<br/>
always so many toys in the tub, that they never felt they were missing<br/>
anything by being there.  Perhaps the feeling of fun has lasted.<br/>
<br/>
It could be because their cousins showed up at my daughter&#39;s birthday<br/>
party , two years ago, smelling.  One of her older homeschooling friends<br/>
whispered that her cousins should take a shower, and it embarrassed my<br/>
daughter, (and me too).  There was a very long discussion after that .<br/>
<br/>
It could be because we are really into the way things feel around here.  And<br/>
there is nothing like putting on warm clothes, right out of the dryer, on<br/>
a clean body, right out of the shower, after a long day.  Unless, you <br/>
also have just washed sheets, but I&#39;m only human.<br/>
<br/>
They have deodorant in their upstairs bathroom, which they use.  I only<br/>
explained it&#39;s purpose to them once, but they had  watched me use it<br/>
for years, (I never get any privacey).  They are really into conditioner now<br/>
<br/>
because the chlorine in the Y&#39;s pool has been making their hair feel<br/>
stale, (my son&#39;s word).  My daughter asked the lifeguard to tell her<br/>
10 minutes before the pool closed today, so she could take a shower there,<br/>
complete with conditioner, before she went home.  My son automatically<br/>
took a shower before getting dressed to pick up his friend. <br/>
<br/>
So, we don&#39;t have a shower problem.  However, we do have a dirty towel<br/>
problem, which I&#39;m  going to stop complaining about.   Okay, it<br/>
was only muttering to myself, but I&#39;m going to stop it anyway.  <br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-42071287">We&#39;ve never had shower problems here either.  Not sure why.  I know my friend&#39;s daughter doesn&#39;t like showers.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters could hardly wait to shave their legs (and do it even though theydon&#39;t really need to), and use deoderant, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My son doesn&#39;t take quite as many showers, but always makes sure he is clean.<br/>
<br/>
Teeth brushing is where our issues are LOL.<br/>
