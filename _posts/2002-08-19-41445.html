<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319794716">I truly do realize that there are unethical trainers out there and I realize<br/>
that demonstrators at circuses are working against those; however, it does<br/>
some unreasonable to paint all training with the same brush.<br/>
<br/>
We have show animals.  Many people who show animals are cruel to them.<br/>
Examples commonly used in 4-H goat programs:  tying a goat with his head<br/>
pulled as high as possible for at least an hour per day, keeping goats in<br/>
small pens, chasing goats with dogs or 4-wheelers to &quot;exercise&quot; them,<br/>
overloading the animals with vaccinations and wormers rather than providing<br/>
a semi-natural habitat for them, overloading them with grain to increase<br/>
weight which leads to medical problems.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t treat our animals that way.  Ours are treated as humanely and<br/>
respectfully as possible.  We use attention and relationships with our<br/>
animals to train them.  We would not want to be lumped in with people who<br/>
mistreat their animals simply because we train and show animals.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that in most areas of animal showmanship there are &quot;bronc busters&quot;<br/>
and there are &quot;horse whisperers&quot;.<br/>
