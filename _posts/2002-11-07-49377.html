<div id="ygrps-yiv-19828489">My son, soon to be 8, just plainly doesn&#39;t want to leave the house much.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t care if we go anywhere, he doesn&#39;t care if he plays outside, he is <br/>
such a homebody.  When he is in social situations he choses to be in he does <br/>
great, every friends house that he has ever gone over to say he is a lovely <br/>
child, should I worry about how social he is or allow him to be a hermit if <br/>
that is what he wants?  I&#39;m new to this and I guess this is on of the areas <br/>
that concerns me.<br/>

hours or so of being gone before he starts asking if we can go home. Like <br/>
your son, he plays well in groups and with friends but he just prefers home. <br/>
My thought is just that this is his personality. <br/>

Well he sounds like he&#39;s doing just fine to me. Obviously not a hermit as <br/>
you said he does fine in social situations of his choosing and also when he <br/>
goes over friends homes. It looks like he&#39;s happy with his choices and maybe <br/>
you think he should be more outgoing. I use to worry about my kids like that <br/>
too. Only because you hear so much crap about homeschoolers being shoved in <br/>
the house all day. My kids are happy with spending a lot of time at home. <br/>
They actually miss it when we have a busy week. I&#39;m open to the idea that it <br/>
may change as they get older, but for now, they know what they want. Sounds <br/>
like your son does too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-651108815">My never want to go anywhere, speak to anyone but family child now routinely stays (overnight sometimes) at a friends house, is is cheerfully anticipating a week long stay with Bubby and Zayde (grandma and grandpa) come March or April....<br/>
<br/>
It does change.  And, fwiw, I think by allowing  the child to develop their own schedule, they are bette able to go out and face the world, and less likely to have social anxiety as an adult...just my supposition...<br/>
<br/>
be well<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461627927">Hi, I&#39;m new, but wanted to weigh in on this.  I&#39;ve always been this way, as a kid and as an adult.  I would rather be at my house.  I&#39;m social, but I want people to come to my house.  Even as a kid I made my friends sleep over at my house, I had no desire to sleep over at their houses.  I would encourage your son to have friends over as much as he wants.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902303402">My 5 year old son is also like this.  He loves to be home, and too <br/>
much activity that requires him to leave the house very often <br/>
stresses him out.  <br/>
<br/>
My 9 year old daughter also loves sleepovers but likes them in our <br/>
house.  <br/>
