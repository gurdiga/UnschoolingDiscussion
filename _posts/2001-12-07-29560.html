<div id="ygrps-yiv-217820398">Oh, I don&#39;t believe that hogwash that there HAS to be consistency in how <br/>
2 parents raise their children.  I am very unschoolish, but my husband <br/>
is not.  Thank goodness he&#39;s not nearly as controlling and conservative <br/>
as he used to be.  I credit myself.  He learns from my modeling just as <br/>
well as my boys do.<br/>
<br/>
OK.  I&#39;ll just come right out and say it:  My boys know what they can <br/>
get away with when they are with me (almost anything!) and they know <br/>
that they can&#39;t do all those things when Papa is around.  They make the <br/>
adjustments very well and I don&#39;t particularly think it is harmful.  It <br/>
is just real life.<br/>
<br/>
I truly wish he had the same philosophy I have, but he doesn&#39;t.  We make <br/>
our compromises and we are happy.  The boys are very happy too.  <br/>
Children are very smart, and they will adjust to different personalities <br/>
and parenting styles.<br/>
<br/>
I refuse to give up my unschooling practices and my husband knows this.  <br/>
I am happy to say he has made more changes than I have.  He&#39;s come more <br/>
to my side than I have come to his.  Actually, I have not moved in his <br/>
direction at all.<br/>
<br/>
He has learned a lot.<br/>
