&lt;&lt;  I couldn&#39;t get past the exposure.  I always<br/>
 loved finding ways to climb up a short cliff when we were camping, but I<br/>
<br/>
 never liked being where a fall was potentially fatal. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Well we always did non-technical mountain climbs, or at least bare minimum <br/>
tech stuff. No rock climbing, my dh is not attracted to that. I am however <br/>
and have climbed indoors a couple times and once on a short cliff.<br/>
Lifes got too many interesting things to try and I just don&#39;t have enough <br/>
money and time to do them all...maybe when the kids are a bit older.<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
