<div id="ygrps-yiv-398465124">To those of you who I was discussing religion privately with (now if <br/>
that ain&#39;t poor grammar...):  I lost all names and addresses (though <br/>
I still remember most in my head) in a computer crash, and was hoping <br/>
to continue the conversations.  And anyone else interested, please e-<br/>
mail me privately.  Thank you.<br/>
