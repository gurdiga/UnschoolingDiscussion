&lt;&lt; also, (totally diff. subj.) can anyone speak to the neccessity of having a <br/>
 child hold a writing utensil &quot;the correct way&quot; and why it is important (or <br/>
 not?)  and whether it matters in what direction letters and numbers are <br/>
 formed (bottom up instead of the customary top down on say, a &quot;L&quot;)?   i am <br/>
 really feeling unqualified on the decision of whether to correct my dd in <br/>
 these ways.  <br/>
 <br/>
 thanks for any input!! &gt;&gt;<br/>

Ok -- my opinion only --<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of telling my kids to use their right hand to write with, <br/>
etc.  My reasoning is that it is easier, they are definitey right-handed but <br/>
sometimes get mixed up and then can get frustrated if they are trying to <br/>
write, or whatever, with their left hand.  Not forcing them to be <br/>
right-handed -- they are right-handed -- just have to remind them sometimes <br/>
of what will feel more natural, easier, if they will try it.  Then they do <br/>
and &quot;Oh yeah -- that&#39;s better.&quot;  So, I think that might apply to how you hold <br/>
a pen/crayon in general.  It is easier, once you get used to it, and have the <br/>
manual dexiterity to handle it, to hold a pencil, etc., &quot;correctly&quot; -- for a <br/>
lot of people -- maybe not yours -- but a lot.  It produces a better product, <br/>
easier and more naturally.  <br/>
<br/>
OTOH -- I see no reason why the letters or numbers have to be written in a <br/>
particular way -- up then down or whatever -- I am happy if the end product <br/>
is legible and I think that is all that matters.  <br/>
<br/>
Ease of use and legibility -- this is all I want.  <br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>
