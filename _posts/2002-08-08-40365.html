There isn&#39;t any other one language that makes an American jump up and say<br/>
wow, this could be really useful! Lots of languages could be useful for some<br/>
Americans in specific instances but not one that has universal usefulness.<br/>
Even being bilingual doesn&#39;t have universal uses. Unless that second<br/>
language is English! English is becoming a universal language like Latin<br/>
used to be.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was said in the video series &quot;The Story of English&quot; that the<br/>
second largest publisher of English language books is India. They couldn&#39;t<br/>
agree on which of the major languages to make the official language of India<br/>
so English became the de facto official language. I couldn&#39;t find the exact<br/>
reference in the book but ran across an Indian scientist who said &quot;if you<br/>
meet an active, working scientist abroad, more often than not you can get by<br/>
speaking English with him.&quot; This is just a guess but if a non-English<br/>
speaker is bilingual it&#39;s way more likely his second language is English<br/>
than any other language.<br/>
<br/>
Native speakers of other languages aren&#39;t looked down on for not learning<br/>
another language to demonstrate they aren&#39;t ethnocentric. If non-English<br/>
speakers learn another language it&#39;s because they think it will be useful. I<br/>
don&#39;t see why Americans should be held to different standards.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433263725">OH MY.. there are SO many people on this earth that do NOT speak english.. perhaps because i live so close to mexico i am particularly aware of the value of speaking more than one language. speaking to people from other cultures is so fascinating and educational.. and to be able to learn from them in their language would teach me so much more. <br/>
<br/>
besides, it&#39;s fun to speak another language.. and a bit egocentric (ethnocentric?) nto think that our language is better than others.. they are different, not better or worse.. the reason most business is done in the world in english is because america is like a MAJOR market.. people want to sell us things.. AND english has a lot of words and things can get nailed down fairly well with it.... i am sure there are other languages that could fill that bill, but they dont have the money we do<br/>

Mandarin Chinese but that won&#39;t do much good in Somalia, France, Czech<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong. I think it would be &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;good&quot; for Americans to<br/>
be multilingual. But nice and good don&#39;t translate into practical. And<br/>
aren&#39;t we unschooling so our kids aren&#39;t subjected to other&#39;s ideas about<br/>
what it would be &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;good&quot; for them to know? So that our kids can<br/>
learn what they want and need to learn? For what practical universal reason<br/>
do our kids need to know another language? And, again, what language?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; perhaps because i live so close to mexico i am particularly aware of the value<br/>
&gt; of speaking more than one language.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suspect you&#39;re aware of the value of speaking both English and Spanish in<br/>
particular. I would bet the percentage of English speakers near the border<br/>
who are bilingual is considerably higher than anywhere else because there&#39;s<br/>
a *practical* reason to be bilingual.<br/>
<br/>
As a New Englander what *practical* use would I find in speaking another<br/>
language? And which language? Spanish? Korean? Hindi? Chinese? (Which<br/>
Chinese?) Arabic? Thai? Those are probably some of the most commonly spoken<br/>
other languages around here but I&#39;ve never met a sufficient number of any of<br/>
those groups to have made knowing their language of practical use. (And if<br/>
it isn&#39;t used it fades away just like my high school Spanish.)<br/>
<br/>
And of course they all speak English anyway!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; besides, it&#39;s fun to speak another language..<br/>

languages for &quot;fun&quot; is the same as in the US. Everyone else has learned for<br/>
practical reasons. Why should Americans be put down because they aren&#39;t<br/>
multiligual for *impractical* reasons?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and a bit egocentric (ethnocentric?) nto think that our language is better<br/>
&gt; than others..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*I* never said English was better. But the fact that someone is far more<br/>
likely to encounter someone who speaks English in a randomly chosen foreign<br/>
country than any other language makes English more practical to know.<br/>
<br/>
What other language is as practical to know as English? I suspect the second<br/>
most practical language is a distant second.<br/>
