<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126505490">&quot;Oh, I&#39;d join you in Columbi hell in a heartbeat. I LOVE warmer <br/>
weather but not<br/>
so hot that you roast either.<br/>
<br/>
What is your weather like most of the year. Maybe we&#39;ll move there!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You want Eastern TN!:) Jonesborough is at 1700feet, so it keeps <br/>
summers relatively mild. It can get hot but not for that long (I&#39;m <br/>
comparing to that other hellishly hot place though...Pensacola).<br/>
<br/>
Winters are colder, with some snow, but each season only lasts about <br/>
three months. Perfect.<br/>
