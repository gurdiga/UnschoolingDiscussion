&gt; courses, but getting familiar with the work of their future <br/>
&gt; professors. This means, reading their articles or books and, if <br/>
&gt; possible, even sitting in some classes. The more they get to know a <br/>
&gt; place or a department, the less likely your son or daughter will <br/>
&gt; waste their time (and your money) in what we used to call at the <br/>
&gt; admissions office a &#39;bs BA&#39;.<br/>

covered....but it doesn&#39;t give the poor kid a CLUE about what he/she&#39;d be <br/>
DOING in the future if he/she majored in that subject. <br/>
<br/>
I KNOW this because I blew it. I LOVED learning economics and statistics <br/>
(econometrics). It was satisfying to me to master all the technical stuff and <br/>
to finally feel like an ADULT (because adults understood how the economy, <br/>
business world, and government all worked and interacted and kids didn&#39;t, in <br/>
my mind). I loved LEARNING it. But I did NOT at all love the work itself - it <br/>
was boring to me once I&#39;d learned it. I should have known, too. I&#39;m a person <br/>
who needs a group of people interacting around me to be happily productive, <br/>
much of the time. But econometricians work mostly in isolation - they are <br/>
analysts. I made the best of it - worked on as many collaborative projects as <br/>
I could. But I really didn&#39;t enjoy it at ALL.<br/>
<br/>
I encourage kids (my college students and hsed teens I talk to) to think <br/>
about &quot;what will I be doing with this degree?&quot; before deciding on a major. <br/>
Not that they have to have a specific job in mind - but they should think <br/>
about what KIND of work they are getting prepared to be doing. Nobody is <br/>
stuck - I got out of what I was prepared to do after some years - but it is <br/>
worth THINKING about, anyway, in advance.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You&#39;re talking about such a small percentage of people in a smaller <br/>
&gt; percentage of situations.  I&#39;m having a hard time coming up with the <br/>
&gt; right words to describe this attitude except it&#39;s all just a bunch of <br/>
&gt; New York elitist bull.  But I don&#39;t wish to be impolite.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the point is a good one though. Lots of people with young children <br/>
assume that their kid is going to go to a selective university someday and <br/>
they worry that homeschooling will interfere with their dreams. The point is <br/>
that it won&#39;t, first of all, and a second point is that even IF they end up <br/>
wanting a highly selective university degree then it doesn&#39;t make much sense, <br/>
economically, to spend the money getting a BA or BS from a highly selective <br/>
university -- better to go to a much much less expensive state college (and <br/>
even start out at community college) and then, IF a highly selective degree <br/>
is still desired, that might be the time it makes sense to spend the small <br/>
fortune it costs - in getting a graduate degree.<br/>
<br/>
Again, this is to relieve the fears and trepidations of those considering <br/>
homeschooling but who think it might interfere with THEIR college plans for <br/>
their still-young child &lt;G&gt;. But it is good advice, too, for those with older <br/>
teens who are considering college --- consider NOT spending too much money on <br/>
a BA or BS degree and then going to grad school - an extra year or two for an <br/>
MA or MS degree - at that expensive place (there are more financial aid <br/>
opportunities for grad school, too, lots of teaching and research <br/>
assistanceships that cover all tuition expenses plus a monthly stipend, for <br/>
example).<br/>
