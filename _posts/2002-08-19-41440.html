&lt;&lt; I have also heard of kids who were philosophically opposed to <br/>
testing, so when their parents dropped them off at the test site, <br/>
they filled in their names and personal info and then left the test <br/>
blank. <br/>

 </span></blockquote> Hi Everyone, I&#39;m new to the list but I&#39;ve been lurking around and reading <br/>
and this caught my attention. Last year I was in the 10th grade in a <br/>
Massachusetts pubic school. As some of you may know MA requires public school <br/>
kids to take a state mandated test called the MCAS (Massachusetts <br/>
comprehensive assessment system) in grades 4 6 8 and 10 I believe. Recently a <br/>
law was passed that 10th graders must past the test in order to graduate from <br/>
high school. There are many things wrong with the test and a group of <br/>
students at my school have found the need to actively protest it. This year <br/>
along with 10 of my classmates (and others across MA) I participated in <br/>
boycotting the test. We did just what you mentioned above. On the day of the <br/>
test  (after a morning protest with the  students from other grades that <br/>
didn&#39;t believe in it, and the 10th graders that also supported the cause but <br/>
couldn&#39;t boycott) we went into our assigned  rooms (sporting T-shirts that <br/>
said &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a MCASualty&quot;) and sat down we waited patiently while <br/>
the proctor explained the directions and filled our names in. then when the <br/>
proctor said &quot;you may begin&quot; we got up from our seats put our tests down on  <br/>
the desk and said &quot;I&#39;m not taking this&quot; to which we received wicked applause <br/>
from the others in the room. (The proctor knew in advance that we weren&#39;t <br/>
going to take it.) we walked out into the hall and met up with the other <br/>
boycotters from the other rooms  then we held hands and walked out the front <br/>
door of our school ceremoniously snapping our number two pencils in half we <br/>
were greeted by the former boycotters, parents, press and other supporters. <br/>
right now as it stands the 10 of us (plus the boycotters from the previous <br/>
year who are now seniors)  wont be graduating, ( which is why I&#39;m on the <br/>
unschooling list) but I wouldn&#39;t change what I did for anything.</div>

chain&quot; bookstore. but they had a very pittiful section on education, let <br/>
alone unschooling. hopefully it will give me some good tips on &quot; breaking <br/>
into unschooling&quot; I&#39;m not an unschooler yet, but my heart is there.</div>
