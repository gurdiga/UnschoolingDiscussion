<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189538084">Arg! I&#39;ve read through 5 digests now, and only caught bits and pieces of<br/>
the puppy conversation. Has anyone suggested the best way to find them GOOD<br/>
homes and I&#39;ve maybe missed it? We have a stray and her 9 pups that will be<br/>
ready for homes next week, and I&#39;m undecided about whether to just take them<br/>
to the flea market and give them to whoever will take them or to take them<br/>
to the rescue shelter. We&#39;ve also got a stray cat that just had 3 kittens<br/>
two weeks ago under the house, so we&#39;ll have to do something with them too<br/>
in about a month. I don&#39;t have the money to run an ad or to keep any of them<br/>
 much as I&#39;d love to. Three dogs, four cats, and a horse is our limit, I&#39;m<br/>
afraid. These have got to go. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907859688">Which reminds me that a fair number of folks look on the Yahoo Classifieds <br/>
for pets.  I got my three Pomeranians that way, and they&#39;re wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
Folks with pets might want to check the Yahoo Classd&#39;s out.  I think <br/>
they&#39;re free.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815786142">Where are you? We&#39;re in need of one or two kittens here! Any chance you&#39;re<br/>
in <br/>
reasonable distance to Salem, MA? (Yeah, right)<br/>

*** I don&#39;t think we&#39;re close enough, although in the grand scheme of the US<br/>
 we&#39;re not as far away as we could be... I&#39;m in SC. <br/>
