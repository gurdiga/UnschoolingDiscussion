Just because the symbolism is meaningless to you doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not<br/>
extraordinarily important to the family.  Some of us really like symbolism.<br/>
Some people *need* the symbolism of their religion to support their faith.<br/>
Is that wrong?  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m about to say something unpopular here. I don&#39;t think it is that important <br/>
to keep the foreskin. I don&#39;t think it traumatizes boys. That said...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you took my question wrong. I didn&#39;t write it with any sarcasm or mal <br/>
intent. I think that religion and symbolism are beautiful and important. That <br/>
wasn&#39;t the basis of my question. I see it didn&#39;t come across that way. I <br/>
should have said. *Since you feel the removal of the of the foreskin is so <br/>
terrible for a baby, why is cutting it any different?* And I do understand <br/>
that many people feel that the removal of the foreskin is a malicious thing. <br/>
And I do understand that if you are Jewish and faith is important and you <br/>
believe the above as well, then you are in conflict. What I don&#39;t see is how <br/>
you can believe in keeping the foreskin because of not wanting to inflict <br/>
such pain on a baby, and still make even the smallest of cuts. I mean, I DO <br/>
understand why, I&#39;m not that dense, the idea just doesn&#39;t sit with me very <br/>
well.  <br/>

<br/>
The anti-circumcision arguments are about more than just the SEVERE pain it <br/>
inflicts on infants, but that a useful, operational part of a man&#39;s sexual <br/>
organ is taken off by people who didn&#39;t know or care what its natural <br/>
function was.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t read much about circumcision problems, or about female <br/>
circumcision, I&#39;m not really recommending that you do.  It is HORRIBLE.  <br/>
Really sickening.  But if you&#39;re not willing to read it, maybe consider <br/>
backing off of saying it&#39;s not a big deal.<br/>

signatures...<br/>
<br/>
The DuckfordU I have for yahoogroups was NOT my first choice.  I used to have <br/>
Sandra Dodd, but when yahoo took over whatever chatgroup company I had been <br/>
with, mine wouldn&#39;t work anymore so I had to use another screename.<br/>
<br/>
My SCA name is AElflaed of Duckford, and DuckfordU was for Duckford <br/>
University, the kinda joke name for me and my SCA apprentices and proteges.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays I have no students.  They all advanced to a higher level.  And I&#39;m <br/>
not doing much SCA.  But this week there was a spate of activity.  That&#39;s why <br/>
I accidently morphed. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
