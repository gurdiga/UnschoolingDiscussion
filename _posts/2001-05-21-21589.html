We watched The Education of Little Tree movie this past weekend, and were<br/>
happy to<br/>
see such a movie made so honestly. It didn&#39;t glamorize one way against<br/>
another as being<br/>
The Anwer, yet it well-addressed a long history of intentional blindness<br/>
that some don&#39;t<br/>
recognize as being alive and well.<br/>

the great thing to learn about life is, first,<br/>
to not do what you don&#39;t want to do, and,<br/>
second, to do what you want to do.<br/>
