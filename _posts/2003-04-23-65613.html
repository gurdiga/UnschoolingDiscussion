<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019895932">It&#39;s one of the books that &#39;sent me over the edge&#39; when deciding if I <br/>
should treat my kids like human beings, or (as I had been raised) vassals <br/>
(small grin.)<br/>
Obviously read before I started Unschooling!<br/>
I think it&#39;s a great book.<br/>

John Holt never had children so you must be thinking of another author.  I think the new Teach Your Own is a good starting point.  I also like Learning All the Time, especially if you have younger kids.  There&#39;s also Mary Griffith&#39;s, The Unschooling Handbook.<br/>

 I think I need to go get it and see who&#39;s book I bought. <br/>

I picked up the Unschooling Handbook a few years ago, that&#39;s the book that <br/>
brought me to Unschooling.  <br/>

Baby&quot; and has plenty in it about observing young nieces and nephews. <br/>
Which is where the idea may have come from, that John Holt had <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be getting his &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; soon as we can afford it.<br/>

Definitely.  It just came out.  Did anyone save that discount link?<br/>
<br/>
One is about school and so will be depressing, and the other other is largely <br/>
about music (which *I* thought was cool, but not as a main John Holt source).</div>

<br/>
I LOVE Learning All the Time.  It&#39;s good too.  So between that and Teach Your <br/>
Own...<br/>
<br/>
The latter was out of print for years and so it&#39;s cool to have.  The other, <br/>
though, if it&#39;s cheaper, is really inspiring and (if I remember correctly) <br/>
easier reading, more flowing.  (And if I&#39;m wrong AGAIN in so short a time, I won&#39;t <br/>
even be surprised.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14510508">The book i have is &quot;How Children Learn&quot; by John Holt<br/>
<br/>
He was writing about a child named Lisa.  I assumed she was his child. I <br/>
looked further into the book and I guess there are other children. I am <br/>
thinking they are children he observed. Opps<br/>
<br/>
I found the book by accident. Barnes and Noble said they didn&#39;t have any John <br/>
Holt books in stock. When I went back to the Isle to look for a different <br/>
book there it was right in front of me. <br/>
<br/>
I am going to read this one I just think I was attempting to read the Preface <br/>
and the first few pages while feeding the baby in the am and it was not <br/>
grabbing me.<br/>

children are still very young.  We&#39;ve been homeschooling about 13 years, and <br/>
I read my first John Holt book about 2 weeks ago...it&#39;s &quot;How Children Learn.&quot; <br/>
 I just ordered the new &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; and have started it.  <br/>
<br/>
I WISH WISH WISH I had read these books a long time ago.  We have always been <br/>
very eclectic and often went for months and months without a curriculum, and <br/>
even then tended to just use library books.  But there are so many arguments, <br/>
frustrations, and tears that could have been avoided through the years had I <br/>
known about unschooling and peaceful parenting/NCP when my kids were much <br/>
younger. :o(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-427735885">I have to admit I also found it hard to get into How Children Learn and How Children Fail.  However, if you get interested in John Holt&#39;s life and how he came to his ideas these might be interesting to you.  I also like A Life Worth Living which is edited by Susannah Sheffer and includes his many letters throughout his life. Never Too Late is a fascinating look at the way he taught himself to play the cello.  Interesting if you like that sort of thing, though not really about homeschooling kids.  I haven&#39;t read Escape from Childhood in a really long time, but I remember it being pretty radical.  <br/>
<br/>
I just thought of another one that really grabbed me when I read it about 7 years ago.  It&#39;s called Real Lives- eleven teenagers who don&#39;t go to school by Grace Llewellyn.  I read it when my daughter was 3 and was just amazed at all the possibilities for older kids.<br/>

Subject:	Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] John Holt books<br/>
<br/>
The book i have is &quot;How Children Learn&quot; by John Holt<br/>
<br/>
He was writing about a child named Lisa.  I assumed she was his child. I <br/>
looked further into the book and I guess there are other children. I am <br/>
thinking they are children he observed. Opps<br/>
<br/>
I found the book by accident. Barnes and Noble said they didn&#39;t have any John <br/>
Holt books in stock. When I went back to the Isle to look for a different <br/>
book there it was right in front of me. <br/>
<br/>
I am going to read this one I just think I was attempting to read the Preface <br/>
and the first few pages while feeding the baby in the am and it was not <br/>
grabbing me.<br/>

it to my favorites but I cannot find it.<br/>
I think it&#39;s 16.20 online but in the store if you have your HS discount card <br/>
it&#39;s 20% off.  Online you have to buy two books at B & N to get free shipping. <br/>
 I ordered mine in the store and strongly suggested they order in more with <br/>
it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-375327586">I read Learning All the Time when my oldest was a baby and it is the reason I decided to homeschool.  truly.  I did lend it out and got away from its inspiration as a result and am just now, having gotten it back, getting back into unschooling. This is my first post here on this list.  Get this book and don&#39;t lend it out!!  Buy it for other people before you lend it.   Teach Your Own looks great.  Thank you so much Sandra for sending that link for the discounted copy.<br/>

LOL!  I got quite a chuckle out of this.  I often start a book from the back, or the middle :o).  Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever added illustrations though &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-180768414">&quot;How Children Fail&quot; records a lot of his experiences with the elementary<br/>
school children in his classes and other kids of that age he observed.<br/>
&quot;How Children Learn&quot; records his observations and interactions with<br/>
toddlers and pre-school aged kids before the school experience had<br/>
destroyed their natural learning. Lisa was the child of two of his close<br/>
friends, and there was also another boy in the same family. He seemed to<br/>
be kind of like a favorite uncle to them, often visiting. I have the<br/>
latest edition of these books, and what I love about them is that he<br/>
made notes about previous statements, sometimes elaborating, and<br/>
sometimes to the effect of &quot;I was wrong then, and sorry I wrote that.<br/>
Here&#39;s what I believe now.&quot; This was a man of immense compassion and a<br/>
love of children. If you can afford it, buy the latest revised updates.<br/>
