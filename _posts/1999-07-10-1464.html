&lt;&lt; My son is 6, we&#39;ve been back here for about 3 years now.  It&#39;s interesting<br/>
 that with as many homeschoolers as there are in this area, that there aren&#39;t<br/>
 many unschoolers.  This will be our first year homeschooling, after a very<br/>
 bad kindergarten year.  I actually found out about homeschooling by trying<br/>
 to find anti-homeschooling info for a case I&#39;m working on... and lo and<br/>
 behold I started to really like the idea of child-led learning and the<br/>
 entire unschooling theory.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Wouldn&#39;t ya know......I have a girl 14 and you have a boy 6!!  Couldn&#39;t be <br/>
more opposite!! Oh well!!  I started homeschooling Valerie right after <br/>
Kindergarten also...we had been to a museum in Chicago and she was very <br/>
interested in Egypt (the museum had a great pyramid) so we bought lots of <br/>
books, etc.  When she came back to school, she asked the teacher when they <br/>
could study Egypt and was told that &quot;you aren&#39;t scheduled to be interested in <br/>
that until you&#39;re older&quot;!!!  We started with Calvert (which as you may or may <br/>
not know is veeerrrry  structured) because I wasn&#39;t sure if I could do it <br/>
alone,  but pretty soon we couldn&#39;t stand the one-lesson-a-day, <br/>
&quot;school-at-home&quot; stuff...that was not what I thought home education was going <br/>
to be like.  I first learned about unschooling when I read Mary Pride&#39;s &quot;Big <br/>
Book of Home Learning&quot; (or something like that) and she described all the <br/>
different approaches to home education.  Unschooling was one way and she <br/>
mentioned John Holt and his theories.  I bought &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; and that was <br/>
it!!<br/>
<br/>
What do you do??.....you mentioned working on a &quot;case&quot;.  You said you came <br/>
back to Jax...are you natives?  We&#39;re all from Los Angeles with a <br/>
hubby-career stop in St. Louis, but we love it here...a lot like &quot;home&quot; <br/>
without all the problems of LA (so far....fingers crossed).<br/>
