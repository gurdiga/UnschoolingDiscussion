Sorry, but I&#39;ve been to New Zealand for your so-called summer and I must<br/>
say it was cold and rainy and never got hot (it was only 60 Degrees F,<br/>
that&#39;s 16 for you kiwis!).  Going to the beach was a chilly experience.<br/>
Where in NZ do you live?  I&#39;ll guess Gisbourne -- the only summery place<br/>
in NZ I know of.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807909281">Hi Wini<br/>
<br/>
Actually, that was me, Carol, speaking, not Michelle. I live west of Hamilton,<br/>
near Raglan, on the west coast of the North Island, and I promise you that it<br/>
has been warmer than 16 degrees lately. Not hot compared to some places, but<br/>
about 28 degrees and humid. I am just getting over a dose of sunburn -<br/>
foolishly thought that swimming in late afternoon I wouldn&#39;t need sunscreen.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you found New Zealand cold and wet. Places don&#39;t always live up to their<br/>
reputation - many years ago when we were travelling, we were in Scotland for 3<br/>
weeks and never saw a single cloud, but Hawaii, while hot, was very grey.<br/>
<br/>
