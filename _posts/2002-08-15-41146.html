&gt; That is a touching post. It is indeed sad that what comes in the language <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; liberation, is instead the intent to control. I have experienced the same <br/>
&gt; myself.<br/>

(Ignore me if you&#39;ve already founnd or looked into support.) It will help<br/>
not having to shoulder all this guilt yourself. And they won&#39;t be full of<br/>
people who have soured on Christianity. I do know people who have held onto<br/>
their Christianity while dropping the fundamentalism.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some things that turned up from Google by typing in christian<br/>
fundamentalism recovery support. This isn&#39;t necessarily the best of best.<br/>
There&#39;s lots more and changing the search words will turn up even more.<br/>

Here&#39;s a bit from that:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Generally, a person who breaks involvement with a dysfunctional group will<br/>
&gt; encounter the following problems:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *    Depression  the product of group-induced self-doubt and self-blame.<br/>
&gt; *    Isolation and loneliness  the shock of crossing the barrier from one<br/>
 </span></blockquote>social <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; environemnt to another.<br/>
&gt; *    Impairment of decision-making and other intellectual skills.<br/>
&gt; *    Floating  occasional lapses into the group&#39;s imposed mindset, often<br/>
&gt; triggered by certain stimuli (music, symbols, key words or phrases, etc.).<br/>
&gt; *    Difficulty in talking about group involvement  often related to strong<br/>
&gt; feelings of guilt, fear, and bitterness.<br/>
&gt; *    Interpersonal difficulties  communication, expression, making new<br/>
 </span></blockquote>friends, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; organized activities, dating, emotional and physical intimacy, etc. Recent<br/>
&gt; walk aways are frequently mistrustful and suspicious of other people and<br/>
&gt; groups.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, how does one recover? How does a person heal the wounds of religious<br/>
&gt; abuse? Hopefully, within a caring and understanding new social setting. This<br/>
&gt; can be a family, a support or therapy group, or an organized community such as<br/>
&gt; a mainstream church, religious group, or humanist society. It should also be<br/>
&gt; done with patience and the consideration that recovery will take time and<br/>
&gt; effort. The following are some ideas for persons who have walked away from<br/>
&gt; religious abuse and who are on the road to reclaiming their lives.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *    Work towards trusting yourself and relying on your own abilities.<br/>
&gt; *    Put your experience down in writing. This will help you to evaluate,<br/>
&gt; understand, and cope with your past involvement in the abusive group.<br/>
&gt; *    Get in touch with other people who have gone through similar experiences,<br/>
&gt; either one-on-one or in a support group.<br/>
&gt; *    Find a hobby or pastime to reinforce a positive sense of accomplishment.<br/>
&gt; *    When floating occurs, firmly remind yourself that the episode was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>triggered <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; by some stimulus. Remember also that it will pass. Identify the trigger, learn<br/>
&gt; to make a new association, and repeat the new association until it overrides<br/>
&gt; the old one. Talking it over with someone who undersands can really help, too.<br/>
&gt; *    Handle decisions, tasks, and relearning of interpersonal skills one setp<br/>
 </span></blockquote>at <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a time. Don&#39;t rush yourself, talk and think things over, and don&#39;t be afraid<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and exercises your problem-solving skills.<br/>
&gt; *    Take a breather from organized religion for about three to nine months,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>at <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; least. Deal with your questions about religion, ethics, and philosophy in an<br/>
&gt; honest and challenging manner.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Remember, you are no longer a victim but a survivor!<br/>
