<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690682936">*THANK YOU, Brynn* ... I&#39;ve seriously considered UNSUB due to the VERY<br/>
things you stated last night ...  thanks for saying what I&#39;m sure a LOT of<br/>
the other mbs are thinking, as well ...  its very pathetic situation when a<br/>
FEW self-centered people feel they can CONSTANTLY run roughshod over their<br/>
fellow loop mbs w/ rude,<br/>
inconsiderate and narrow-minded posts and RUIN a perfectly informative loop<br/>
for everyone else ... as a newbie UNschooler, I joined this list for SUPPORT<br/>
not ARGUING ... *eeegads*, if I want arguing, I can just call my mil for<br/>
*THAT*!!!  &lt;NO LOL&gt;<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s easy to hide behind the anonymity of a computer monitor when taking pot<br/>
shots, criticizing and picking @  others just b/c they DON&#39;T SHARE *YOUR*<br/>
PHILOSOPHY ABOUT LIFE!!! ... ha, chances are I DOUBT these *FEW* would have<br/>
the nerve to speak in this manner if we were chatting fact to face; sort of<br/>
*BRATTY* don&#39;t you think???<br/>
<br/>
my reaction to all of this *MONITOR RAGE* is similar to how I feel when<br/>
hearing of *yet* another ROAD RAGE incident; total disgust!!!   basically<br/>
*SANE* people hiding behind their computer monitors like those who involve<br/>
themselves in road rage *hide* behind their cars ... it&#39;s SO RIDICULOUS!!!<br/>
ha ...<br/>
<br/>
Pris ~&gt; who&#39;z in complete agreement w/ you, Brynn AND WHO&#39;Z EVER SO GRATEFUL<br/>
FOR HER DELETE BUTTON!!!<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Ok, yet another one here that was going to stay out of this one, but can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; help myself. I am not here to agree or disagree with anyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am here to say that even though I have been quite tolerant and patient<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; these emails filling my inbox these last few days, it&#39;s a bit tiring<br/>
seeing<br/>
&gt; some really judgmental and quite rude statements. Everybody does things<br/>
&gt; differently, and what works for some doesn&#39;t work for all. I can<br/>
understand<br/>
&gt; soapboxes, and how people feel very passionately about certain things. But<br/>
&gt; all of the rudeness has gotten to the point that it&#39;s embarrassing to<br/>
think<br/>
&gt; that anyone would visit this list to subscribe and see so much harshness<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; downright meanness. It&#39;s one thing to make room for other&#39;s views and also<br/>
&gt; to disagree with them. It&#39;s another to be so intolerant and rude. I&#39;m<br/>
weary<br/>
&gt; of all of this, and yes Dia, I have given you some attention that you seem<br/>
&gt; to be needy of by directing this email toward you, as it&#39;s mainly your<br/>
&gt; defensive, aggressive, condescension that I am addressing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, I&#39;m sure this email won&#39;t make a bit of difference to some, but there<br/>
&gt; are so many other topics that we can introduce rather then allowing some<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; this rudeness to continue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dia, could you possibly reply to someone&#39;s email without dissecting it and<br/>
&gt; flaming them? (and if you want to copy and paste this into an email with<br/>
&gt; excerpts from other emails that you have replied to without flaming<br/>
someone,<br/>
&gt; feel free).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Much love to all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Brynn<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;.  Anytime you physically touch someone without their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permission, it could be constituted as abuse&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;.  Accidental contact is one thing and that<br/>
&gt; &gt; is not what I was talking about.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These are two different statements.  The first is what I was replying to.<br/>
&gt; You said &quot;anytime&quot;.  On another list I probably would have realized that<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; writer was exaggerating somewhat, here I just don&#39;t know.  It&#39;s like<br/>
jumping<br/>
&gt; into a group of pirahnas.  I am very glad that you don&#39;t scream &quot;abuse&quot; if<br/>
&gt; someone bumps you in line.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Spanking is intentionally hurting someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; in a way that is not acceptable. &lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It may not be acceptable in your opinion, that does not mean that it is<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; acceptable to everyone.  Your opinion is not the only one in existence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You are humiliating your child any time you lay a hand on them.  Trust<br/>
me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been one of those children.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am not humiliating my child, I am correcting my child.  I was beaten as<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; child, and I know full well the difference between beating and spanking.<br/>
&gt; No, I don&#39;t trust you.  Not even a little bit.<br/>
