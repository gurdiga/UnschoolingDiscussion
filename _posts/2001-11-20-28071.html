<div id="ygrps-yiv-213193745">I have *tried* to teach my children breathing techniques for relaxation.  My<br/>
oldest resists/fights this like crazy.  We&#39;ve tried doing, discussing it at<br/>
emotionally neutral times....she gets argumentative.<br/>
In the face of something painful or upsetting,  if you remind her to breathe<br/>
deeply,  she gets more angry and hyperventilates!!!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s quite frustrating.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We didn&#39;t teach techniques, just said &quot;Breathe.&quot;<br/>
For the babies we would say &quot;Breathe air down to your toe!&quot; or wherever the <br/>
wound was.  Oxygen cuts the panic and helps dissipate the adrenaline.  <br/>
<br/>
I was impatient with &quot;breathing techniques&quot; in childbirth classes and from <br/>
coaches.  The necessity was &quot;breathe,&quot; and it irritated me for someone else <br/>
to say when in and when out.  Even holding breath can help, with kids, <br/>
because it means the next breath in will be a big one.<br/>

<br/>
Okay, this is going to sound really weird but . . .<br/>
 . . . instead of telling them to breath in a crisis, encourage them <br/>
to exhale slowly.  I discovered that I could &#39;cure&#39; an asthma attack <br/>
by singing a while back and it does work in a pinch to at least get <br/>
me through until I can get an inhaler.  I&#39;ve used it with the kids <br/>
too. Jenni and Wyndham have both gone through me making them blow <br/>
bubble soap when they were little and in distress(see previous post <br/>
about their asthma.)  I sort of understand why it works but I can&#39;t <br/>
explain it at all.<br/>
