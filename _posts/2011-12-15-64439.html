This made me smile.  My kids will eat sandwich crusts but not pizza crusts<br/>
so they always bring them to me.  My 7 yr old daughter always says &quot;Here&#39;s<br/>
some yummy crust for you!&quot; and my husband and I always pretend to fight<br/>
over who gets the yummy crust.  We laugh and laugh and enjoy the pizza.<br/>

Yes, me too!  My dog LOVES it when people don&#39;t like various food items!  Once the crust is cut off, we keep it on the plate, and sometimes it gets eaten separate and sometimes it is used to keep the dog from being too near someone&#39;s plate, to toss and have the dog go to whatever it is that got tossed in the direction away from a plate.<br/>
