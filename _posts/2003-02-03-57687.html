<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114899963">Hey<br/>
<br/>
About a decade ago, or a little less, I did a &quot;word study&quot; on the <br/>
words &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;learn,&quot; to see what the Bible has to say about <br/>
those concepts. You define your words (dictionary) and you find <br/>
usages of your word in the Bible (concordance) and then you write an <br/>
essay about what you found. It&#39;s very educational, to say the least.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I just this morning remembered that word study, and I can&#39;t <br/>
find it right now, but I do remember what I found.<br/>
<br/>
1) teach has a connotation of piercing. Of an arrow finding the mark. <br/>
Has anyone on this list ever had that happen? I&#39;d liken it to <br/>
an &quot;aha&quot; moment on speed! L &quot;wow. This is TRUE. or This is BEAUTIFUL. <br/>
or This is GOOD.&quot; and it sets your heart flying, when this happens. <br/>
It IS like being pierced, with joy or profundity or deep <br/>
understanding.<br/>
<br/>
2) there is one passage in the Bible that directly says &quot;teach&quot; about <br/>
Parent to Child. It is in Deuteronomy, and it says <br/>
(paraphrased) &quot;Teach these things to your children when they rise, <br/>
when you are walking along the way with them, and when they go to <br/>
sleep.&quot; IOW, throughout the day, be with your kids, teaching them. <br/>
The context happens to be about teaching God&#39;s Law to them, but I say <br/>
it&#39;s about teaching them. Period. This group has mentioned teach by <br/>
example/ Well, how, if they aren&#39;t with you every day, for the major <br/>
portion of their time?<br/>
<br/>
3) other mentions of teach deal with a pleading with God, to teach <br/>
His statutes directly to the &quot;pleader.&quot; i.e. &quot;teach me thy ways, Oh <br/>
God, and I will know them.&quot; and, going to the Creation to learn. <br/>
i.e. &quot;Go to the ant, thou sluggard...&quot; if you want to learn about <br/>
working and being prepared. <br/>
<br/>
Indirectly, (not necessarily with the words teach or learn right <br/>
there in the passage) you can find examples of eagles, badgers, <br/>
serpents, locusts, lizards, lions, roosters, male goats, ships at <br/>
sea, a weaned child, a tree by a river of water, kings, slaves, <br/>
women, men, babies...TEACHING. <br/>
<br/>
This was the main thing I remember from my word study: that God <br/>
teaches, and that His creation teaches. Here is where I can take the <br/>
main ideas of unschooling (people will pursue knowledge if let to do <br/>
so) and say &quot;It&#39;s Biblical, for even God himself says to learn from <br/>
the creation.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t find any mention in scripture of sittin em down and makin em <br/>
do seatwork...but plenty about listening to your father&#39;s instruction <br/>
and the guidance of the Word in a person&#39;s life, about diligence and <br/>
doing good, about working vs. being lazy...hmmm, about DOING?<br/>
<br/>
anyways. Just some thoughts this morning.<br/>
<br/>
peace, Heidi</div>

<br/>
&quot;To learn from creation&quot; doesn&#39;t exactly say &quot;creation teaches.&quot;<br/>
