<div id="ygrps-yiv-5332963">I agree with Joyce all the way on this.  There&#39;ve been discussions on<br/>
whether or not &#39;unschooling&#39; is the best word for what people do......but<br/>
I&#39;ll go with a Holt idea on this.  He said in talking about long and short<br/>
vowels....the adjectives are meaningless in terms of the definition of<br/>
&#39;long&#39; and &#39;short&#39;  ...but that those words were picked in regard to vowels<br/>
and there use continued.  In the same way we have come to know a certain<br/>
type animal as a &#39;dog&#39;.... the word seems to have stuck and we keep using it<br/>
for what we mean.<br/>
    So I do believe the meaning of unschooling...and clarifying it&#39;s<br/>
definition is very important.<br/>
Susan<br/>
P.S.  Thinking about other words/phrases that have been used....learning all<br/>
the time, always learning, growing without schooling...led me to think of a<br/>
way to respond to some of my friends who send their children to school,  but<br/>
offer much enrichment outside the paremeters of schooling....perhaps they<br/>
are &quot;growing in spite of schooling&quot;...?...<br/>

&gt; He isn&#39;t seeking out a path that leads to someone&#39;s definition of &quot;Jimmy&#39;s<br/>
&gt; goal in life&quot;. He&#39;s setting his own goal and taking his own path.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But, though that may be the *method* of unschooling, the *philosophy* of<br/>
&gt; unschooling *isn&#39;t* whatever goal that a family decides suits their family<br/>
&gt; best. It *is* a very definite definible goal and helping people reach<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*that<br/>

&gt; *doesn&#39;t* mean I advocate jumping all over newbies who are unclear on the<br/>
