<div id="ygrps-yiv-184380833">&lt;&lt;&lt;I can&#39;t tell you the number of well meaning parents that have suggested I<br/>
needed to watch my children better,  that have taken it upon themselves to<br/>
tell my children to get down, etc..  The first few times I kind of blew it<br/>
off.  Now, I am likely to be the one staring daggers.  It gets old.  Just<br/>
because my children are doing something that their kids couldn&#39;t handle<br/>
safely doesn&#39;t mean my kids can&#39;t handle it.<br/>

This just proves (again) to me that each child is so individual and you cannot make judgements of others without knowing more about the situation.  ( I am not talking about spanking....I don&#39;t think that is appropriate in ANY situation.)  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is one of those who has to be more cautious than others.   She has cried numerous times in disgust because she isn&#39;t able to perform some trick or stunt that others can do without getting injured.  She&#39;s not had any broken bones herself thankfully, but many, many scrapes and boo boos.  She doesn&#39;t even want to think about taking off the training wheels on her bike.  She will be 7 in  a few weeks.  My son was 4 and was/is a daredevil of sorts.  Each child is so different.  Thanks for giving me another viewpoint to think about.  It makes it even more difficult to decide when to speak up for a child and when to just keep my trap shut................<br/>

Not to pick on you Kimber but this type of stuff drives me insane.  All of<br/>
my kids have excellent gross motor skills, since they were babies they have<br/>
been phenomenal.  My 3yo has been able to climb an 8 ft pole for many<br/>
months.  My then 2yo could dribble a basketball and bat a baseball thrown to<br/>
him.  They climb all over everything, initially with my right there to catch<br/>
them but soon very independently.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t worry if it&#39;s just my daughter - I remember her climbing up a<br/>
slide that was taller than I am at the park and going down by herself<br/>
before she was a year old. I worry about carts, though, because of the<br/>
other people involved. My kid might know her own abilities, but she (at<br/>
2) wouldn&#39;t know that some other person who wasn&#39;t watching where they<br/>
were going was going to come out an aisle and bump her cart and make her<br/>
lose her balance...<br/>
