<div id="ygrps-yiv-725684140">I don&#39;t know where to get a white noise CD, but I can tell you that two of<br/>
my daughters had reoccuring ear infections even though they were completely<br/>
breastfed. The problem was food allergies. If I took in any milk products,<br/>
they would react to it. One major symptom is ear infections. The body<br/>
produces fluid as an allergic reaction and it&#39;s a big problem with those<br/>
little baby ear canals. Many times it&#39;s not even an infection...it&#39;s a lot<br/>
of fluid in there making them uncomfortable. The only way to find out if<br/>
this is the problem is for the mom to stop eating one kind of food for a<br/>
week or so and see if it makes a difference. Milk and wheat are the #1<br/>
culprits. If the baby is on any kind of formula or baby food, this could be<br/>
a problem, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-612390997">Hi Tracy;<br/>
<br/>
One of my breastfed babies had stubborn ear infections for a time and no<br/>
antibiotic seemed to clear them up. Finally I read somewhere about the<br/>
merits of vitamin C and vitamin E therapy for ear health and once I<br/>
began daily doses my child NEVER had another ear infection! How old is<br/>
the baby you are refering to? I find even a 9 month old can handle a<br/>
vitamin E capsule but if this is not practical I wonder if the Mom took<br/>
massive doses herself she would then share it with the babe in her<br/>
breastmilk. Doses of 500mg of vitamin C 3-4 times a day, and one 400mg<br/>
of vitamin E for mom would be good with no adverse affect.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, I have also heard from other Moms how their children<br/>
benefitted from chiropractic adjustments specifically geared for ear<br/>
health. Some chiropractors seem to understand this better than<br/>
others...Ask around who has experience with infants. Apparently<br/>
chiropractic can also help with fussy babies to a certain extent.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to the Mom in question,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Count me as yet another mom whose breastfed baby had tons of problems until<br/>
I stopped all dairy (and that means checking labels for ingredients like<br/>
Casien and Whey as well). The other day I splurged and had an ice cream<br/>
cone, I haven&#39;t had dairy in 10 months. Within 24 hours, my poor little girl<br/>
had a totally stopped-up runny nose, was pulling on her ears, not sleeping<br/>
at night, etc. Food allergies are definitely the first thing she might want<br/>
to investigate. Worse than the sleeping problems are the other issues - is<br/>
her child hearing well enough for early language acquisition, etc. Food<br/>
allergies can be to anything, but the first things to eliminate are probably<br/>
dairy & wheat. It takes up to 6 - 8 weeks to get the dairy out of the<br/>
system, so tell her to keep with it for a couple of months if she can. Other<br/>
common allergens are soy, corn, nuts, and fish/shellfish.<br/>

I remember reading a post by a nurse on another list, saying <br/>
that feeding babies lying down could cause problems.  Here&#39;s an <br/>
extract fromt he post - I&#39;ll write and ask her whether it&#39;s OK to <br/>
forward the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;We all have eustacian tubes that run from our throats to our ears.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>In adults, the end in our throat is inferior/lower.  In babies, it is <br/>
straight across.  This is why it is a bad thing to feed a baby lying <br/>
down. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>

she remembers the post!  Guilt...guilt....)</div>
