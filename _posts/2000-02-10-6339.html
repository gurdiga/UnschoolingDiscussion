<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061315264">OOooh, I forgot to mention that I like the Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula LeGuin, for the fantasists out there!!  And I have Piers Anthony&#39;s Incarnations of Immortality and the series with the jockey, the robot woman and the Tourney, if you&#39;ve read it you&#39;ll know what I mean!!  I can&#39;t remember the name and it&#39;s in a box in the garage and I&#39;m not looking for it!!<br/>
<br/>
The gardening book is an ooooold (1976!!) uk edition of The No-Work Garden Book by Ruth Stout, with UK relevant addition by Richard Clemence.  She used hay and normal vegetable waste for mulch, and it&#39;s a book in LLL-ish style of &#39;this is how I did it and it worked,&#39; rather than this is how it must be done :-)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of LLL, I&#39;m really fired up by the flyer I got this morning for the LLL European conference to be held in Nottingham this year.  Any Europeans on the list who will be going?  Or non-Europeans either, it sounds like a really good do!!!  Talk about mixing causes, huh?  I&#39;ll get struck off before I get struck on at this rate!!<br/>

  &gt;No Work Garden<br/>
  maybe &quot;Lasagna Gardening?&quot; - have been using the &#39;method&#39; for a year or <br/>
  so and it IS easy and very effective, too. It suits our style - not a lot <br/>
  of work, pretty foolpfoof and LOTS of results<br/>
<br/>
  For reading - have a look at Diana&#39; Gabaldon&#39;s series -<br/>
  Outlander, Voyager, ( forget one title) and Dragonfly in Amber - 3 more <br/>
  books to come. David got me the Companion to the series for Christmas and <br/>
  acknowledged with a kiss that he was unlikely to get the chance again <br/>
  until the book was devoured (hee hee).<br/>
  Make sure your library has all volumes before starting - or get that <br/>
  interlibrary loan thing going!  There is a site I like (clevermoms.com) <br/>
  that has quite a few book discount coupon codes for Borders, B & N and so <br/>
  on.<br/>
<br/>
  David is reading Clive Cussler&#39;s newest novel - says it is almost as good <br/>
  as the Dirk Pitt ones (new main character) and is on the 3rd Harry Potter <br/>
  with our daughter Hannah.  14 year old son Davy - who started reading at <br/>
  8 and a half - is now reading Lord of the Rings series again and <br/>
  impatiently waiting for another David Eddings (read that ENTIRE series <br/>
  twice, too).  Recently discovered a novel by David Drake, &quot;Lord of the <br/>
  Isles&quot; and is scouting today for a prequel or sequel. I read it, too - <br/>
  very good.  Armus is having us read him fish stuff fish stuff and more <br/>
  fish stuff as he just started an aquarium.<br/>
