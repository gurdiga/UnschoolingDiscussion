<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136707822">We are!  My mom got us excited about it several years ago.  We went to the Columbia River today, to splash around in the warm September sun.  One of the first things we saw was a group of geese.  Lisa said it was a family.  I disagreed at first, but as we observed them, we noticed that there were two that were distinctly different from the other 6.  We spent a while pointing out the details so we could look them up later.  She went off somewhere else after the park, and I can&#39;t find these in my bird book!  The adults had black bill & eyes, dark &quot;stripe&quot; down back of neck & dirty white in front.  The male had a black protuberance at the top of his beak with an orange mark at the top and white stripe between the bill and his face.  Under his neck there was a bulge that resembled an Adams apple or that thing under a turkey&#39;s neck.  The young all had orange bills tipped with white and orange circles around black eyes.  Their necks had a variegated pattern, but were also slightly darker on the back of the neck than the front.  All had orange feet and white rumps.  They looked similar to the greater white-fronted goose, but not exactly.<br/>
<br/>
I let the kids jump off the new dock today.  I&#39;m a bit paranoid near the river, as it runs swiftly and is often murky.  The water today was clear.  After a while the kids decided to swim from the dock to the shore (not very far).  We&#39;d brought a neighbor boy. He got scared the last yard, but Lisa was there in the water and reached out to him.  I thought it was interesting because he has had swimming lessons every year for the last 4 years.  My girls took one session of swim lessons 3 years ago, but have had lots of opportunity to just be in the water.  Mine are more confident and better swimmers than he is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-514229037">I just have to effuse a bit about birds. We&#39;ve got our corner in the <br/>
kitchen ready for Project Feeder Watch (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://birds.cornell.edu/)">http://birds.cornell.edu/)</a>. <br/>
We&#39;ve posted the poster with all the eastern backyard birds and <br/>
we have a calendar up. Just outside is our bird feeder (a <br/>
hanging cylinder one) with black oil sunflower seeds inside it. <br/>
We also strew the seeds on the fence rail of our deck so the <br/>
bigger birds (jays and cardinals) can get to it as well.<br/>
<br/>
It took our little bird community a week or so to really figure out <br/>
that the good eats were here at our house. But this morning, as <br/>
we ate breakfast, a gala of birds darted in and out of view at our <br/>
feeder:<br/>
<br/>
One tufted titmouse (who returned over and over again for over <br/>
an hour)<br/>
Carolina Chickadees (5 or 6 at least!)<br/>
A big red male cardinal<br/>
Our very first female junco!<br/>
Our first Whitebreasted Nuthatch<br/>
Multiple robins (who don&#39;t really eat the seed but enjoy flying onto <br/>
the branches of the littler birds scaring them off. )<br/>
House sparrows who fought over the entry way to Liam&#39;s bird <br/>
house (it&#39;s been quite the highly sought property in our neck of <br/>
the woods). We saw at least 4 females and 7-8 males.<br/>
An unidentified yellow breasted bird with grey wings. (He didn&#39;t <br/>
stay long enough for us to determine whether he was a warbler <br/>
or a goldfinch or an evening grosbeak.)<br/>
Female Downy woodpecker (who joined us at the end of over an <br/>
hour of watching)<br/>
And a blue jay!<br/>
<br/>
It was quite a morning. Every time we thought we&#39;d seen it all, <br/>
another new bird arrived and we&#39;d jump from our seats to talk <br/>
and look at the chart and open our book and identify. My two <br/>
younger kids (9 and 7) are totally into this bird watching game. <br/>
They alert me constantly to new birds in our yard and we also <br/>
watch for them when we drive or go to the park. It&#39;s become a <br/>
real family passtime!<br/>
<br/>
Liam (9) started a feather collection and we even figured out <br/>
what kinds of feathers they were (not just which bird they came <br/>
from but what kind: flight or warmth or what ever else...).<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t wait to start our tallying the birds in our yard for the Project <br/>
Feeder Watch (which begins in Novemeber). It&#39;s a great way to <br/>
learn about birds, to help keep track of bird flight/feeding patterns <br/>
and to enjoy the fun of being a part of a larger mission!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084682684">Oh, I just LOVE bird watching! We live in a good area for it, too.<br/>
Juncos fly through every year in Feb. and the bald eagles make a stop<br/>
on the nearby river on their way north. we have raptors all year<br/>
round: red-tailed hawks, kestrels, falcons, all in a glance out into<br/>
our valley.<br/>
<br/>
Sandhill cranes, too. Pelicans, and great blue herons. Saw some swans<br/>
one spring. <br/>
<br/>
The best backyard birds, IMO, are the pine siskins. They are bold,<br/>
even staying with a feeder while my daughter crept up beneath them,<br/>
and actually was able to touch one before it darted off. They eat the<br/>
same things as goldfinches, and loved our upside-down feeder we had a<br/>
couple of years ago.<br/>
<br/>
This year, our biggy was the hummingbirds. At times we had more than a<br/>
dozen fighting over our front yard feeder...wonderful evening<br/>
entertainment. They aren&#39;t ruby throated, but I *think* rufous sided<br/>
hummingbirds. And my favorite, the blacl capped chickadee, won&#39;t even<br/>
come near the place. I&#39;ve scattered seed (the juncos love that) and<br/>
put out tray feeders and such...nope. they stick close to the spruce<br/>
trees. <br/>
<br/>
such a cool activity. I love birds!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596986805">Here I am waving at you from the Rocky Mountains of Montana.<br/>
<br/>
I just signed up for feeder watch, but haven&#39;t received the stuff yet. <br/>
We watch all the time anyway and make special trips just to look for<br/>
birds.  We have a little sun room off the kitchen with windows facing<br/>
east, north and west.  We have nine feeders in the trees in the back yard<br/>
which can be viewed from that room.<br/>
<br/>
Last week we had Red-winged Blackbirds and Common Grackles and Brewer&#39;s<br/>
Blackbirds by the hundreds.  The sound was incredible.  This week we have<br/>
a few dozen.<br/>
 <br/>
We don&#39;t get Cardinals here, and the Red Crossbills, Evening Grosbeaks,<br/>
Black Headed Grosbeaks, Lazuli Buntings, American Goldfinches and Pine<br/>
Siskins have all moved onward in their migration.<br/>
<br/>
We do have Dark Eyed Junkos and Red Breasted Nuthatches (no white here)<br/>
and Blue Jays and Stellers Jays, (who come if I put out peanuts)<br/>
<br/>
All the Hummingbirds are gone.  We had Calliope and Rufus Hummingbirds<br/>
this year.<br/>
<br/>
There are still some Warblers, mainly Yellow Rumped and Yellow warblers. <br/>
<br/>
We will have House Sparrows, White Crowned Sparrows, House Finches and<br/>
Cassin&#39;s Finches all winter here, along with Mountain and Black Capped<br/>
Chickadees.  Redpoll will be showing up in another month or so and will<br/>
stay all winter.   <br/>
The Crows will probably stay all year too.<br/>
<br/>
If we put out peanut butter we get Flickers and Downy and Hairy<br/>
Woodpeckers. <br/>
<br/>
Bird watching is contagious.  If you&#39;re exposed to a bird watcher  (or a<br/>
feeder watch program, it&#39;s a plot!)  long enough you&#39;ll catch it and be<br/>
stuck forever in bird geekdom.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962638372">Well, you have really made this former New England girl transplanted to<br/>
beautiful Kauai REALLY jealous with all this talk of bird feeders and the<br/>
marvelous variety of species flocking to the handouts! I grew up on<br/>
Connecticut with feeders and the same chatter at the breakfast table inside<br/>
and the feeders outside. As an adult I had several of my own feeders in my<br/>
yards on Long Island. Went to work for a time with Audubon in NYC and went<br/>
on several birding trips. But, those feeders are the most fun! Now, the<br/>
species we have on Kauai are surely exotic and lovely - but the variety of<br/>
woodland birds doesn&#39;t even touch my mainland experiences. Sigh. Now, the<br/>
only feeders we have are my gardens of sunflowers I plant year round - and<br/>
the cardinals love those! This is always the time of year I grow nostalgic<br/>
for New England and you have given me more reason than the foliage to feel<br/>
so tonight! <br/>
Lee<br/>
Who does feel luck to live on Kauai, but realizes you don&#39;t ever take all<br/>
the New England out of the girl, even if she leaves New England!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184630388">Hey, everyone.  Was just browsing messages and had to talk &quot;bird&quot; <br/>
with other &quot;birders&quot; (and, btw, to be TRUE bird-watchers, you have to <br/>
use the word &quot;bird&quot; as a verb...to bird...! ;-).<br/>
<br/>
My Jake (13 on Sunday!) has been into birds for the longest time.  It <br/>
started with wild &quot;birding&quot; and then when he was 9 or 10, he wanted <br/>
to get a pet bird.  So he got an English Budgie.  He watches any bird <br/>
programs on TV that he can, he gets magazines, and we go &quot;birding&quot; <br/>
quite often, armed with bird books.  He was thrilled to see his first <br/>
pelican in South Carolina this August when we visited Charleston <br/>
before the conference (and then we had a &quot;debate&quot; over which kind of <br/>
pelican it was, and he was right, of course...it was a brown pelican, <br/>
the only pelican that dives for fish).<br/>
<br/>
When we do fall kayak trips on our river, their main purpose is <br/>
birding, as on the Delaware River (where we have our cabin), we see <br/>
bald eagles, osprey, great egrets, great blue herons, kingfishers, <br/>
geese, merganzer ducks, and, our all-time favorite, the green heron <br/>
(that bird is SO cool!) (last weekend, we saw a bear swimming across <br/>
the river!).<br/>
<br/>
Last year for Jake&#39;s birthday, we went hiking in the birding trails <br/>
at Cornell&#39;s Sapsucker Woods sanctuary.  That was great.  This year, <br/>
we&#39;re going to the Bronx Zoo, as they have about five bird exhibits.  <br/>
Jake can&#39;t wait to see the bee-eaters and watch their feeding (the <br/>
keepers throw them live crickets).  He can&#39;t wait to see the puffins, <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
I got Jake a life-list for his birthday, and can&#39;t wait to give it to <br/>
him!  Does anyone else have a life-list?<br/>
<br/>
Deborah, we almost moved to Montana, and we LOVED the magpies <br/>
(probably quite common to you).  But here at our country home in NY, <br/>
we get loads of chickadees, juncos, rose-breasted grossbeaks, <br/>
pileated woodpeckers...loads more that I can&#39;t think of right now!  <br/>
We are high in elevation (2500 ft.), so we have our own private hawk <br/>
migration watch.  That&#39;s really cool.  It&#39;s also so cool when the <br/>
Canadian geese migrate, although a bit sad for us...we feel left <br/>
behind!<br/>
<br/>
Did any of you birders see the movie &quot;Winged Migration&quot;?  It&#39;s <br/>
playing at artsy theaters...and it&#39;s a MUST-SEE for serious birders.  <br/>
I think you can check on-line to see where it&#39;s playing...put the <br/>
words in a google search.  It&#39;s fabulous.<br/>

***I took our three birders to that movie and we were mezmerized. <br/>
The camera work was truly astonishing. We can&#39;t wait to own our <br/>
own copy so we can slow it down, rewind and replay. Made me <br/>
want to go on a birding trip!**<br/>
<br/>
Me, too...but Jake and I had to close our eyes and cover our ears for the sad parts!  :-(  My mother had seen it before, and she went with us, and told us when they were coming...but then after the movie, she talked about them...so we knew what was going on.  Nature can be pretty brutal and too much to bear at times for us highly sensitive folks!<br/>
