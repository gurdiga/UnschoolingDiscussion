Brain teasers<br/>
<br/>
Here are the questions<br/>
<br/>
1. There is a man who lives on the top floor of a very tall building.<br/>
Everyday he gets the elevator down to the ground floor to leave the<br/>
building to go to work. Upon returning from work though, he can only travel<br/>
half way up in the lift and has to walk the rest of the way unless it&#39;s<br/>
raining! Why?<br/>
<br/>
2. A man and his son are in a car accident. The father dies on the scene,<br/>
but the child is rushed to the hospital. When he arrives the surgeon says,<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t operate on this boy, he is my son!&quot; How can this be?<br/>
<br/>
3. A man is wearing black. Black shoes, socks, trousers, jumper, gloves and<br/>
balaclava. He is walking down a black street with all the street lamps off.<br/>
A black car is coming towards him with its light off but somehow manages to<br/>
stop in time. How did the driver see the man?<br/>
<br/>
 4. One day Kerry celebrated her birthday. Two days later her older twin<br/>
brother, Terry, celebrated his birthday. How?<br/>
<br/>
 5. Why is it better to have round manhole covers than square ones?<br/>
<br/>
 6. A man went to a party and drank some of the punch. He then left early.<br/>
 Everyone else at the party who drank the punch subsequently died of<br/>
 poisoning. Why did the man not die?<br/>
<br/>
 7. A man died and went to Heaven. There were thousands of other people<br/>
 there. They were all naked and all looked as they did at the age of 21. He<br/>
 looked around to see if there was anyone he recognized. He saw a couple<br/>
and he knew immediately that they were Adam and Eve. How did he know?<br/>
<br/>
 8. A woman had two sons who were born on the same hour of the same day &gt; of<br/>
the same year. But they were not twins. How could this be so?<br/>
<br/>
 9. A man walks into a bar and asks the barman for a glass of water. The<br/>
 barman pulls out a gun and points it at the man. The man says &#39;Thank you&#39;<br/>
 and walks out.<br/>
<br/>
          *What if The Hokey Pokey really IS what it&#39;s all About? </span></blockquote></div>
