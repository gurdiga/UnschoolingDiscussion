&gt; My dh and I are potters/artists. We KNOW that the process IS the product!!!<br/>
&gt; When we&#39;ve done clay programs, we always emphasize that there is no right or<br/>
&gt; wrong way to explore --that the exploration of the materials is what is<br/>
&gt; important. One time we read &quot;A House is a House For Me&quot; then we asked<br/>
&gt; everyone to construct a house--kids did a wonderful variety of things: a<br/>
&gt; bird&#39;s nest, a stable, a bee hive, a tree house among others.  I think that<br/>
&gt; often people who &quot;teach&quot; art exploration classes mean well, but, in matters<br/>
&gt; of consequence, they are truly off base.<br/>

&gt; &gt; When my dd a(now 11 1/2)<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; was in kdgn, she was admonished for &quot;messy coloring&quot;. This doesn&#39;t fan<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; fire of creativity!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;   Debra<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Claire and I went to an arts and crafts get together. We went only twice.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Each week there was a different &quot;project&quot; - making a marionette or<br/>
&gt; &gt;working with clay....There were many different materials - seemed neat...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I spoke to the &quot;teacher&quot; after she explained about the &quot;class&quot;.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;explained my point of view - that it was the creative *process* that is<br/>
&gt; &gt;interesting and important. That I was seeking something free and<br/>
&gt; &gt;*unstructured*.  I must have been dreaming.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I hung out reading a book.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The teacher took the black marker that Claire chose for her marionette,<br/>
&gt; &gt;explained that it was dark and not good - and she began to show<br/>
&gt; &gt;Claire how to do it - coloring almost all of the marionette as Claire<br/>
&gt; &gt;watched.  I put my book down, and explained again to the teacher that<br/>
&gt; &gt;it is *Claire* who is creating something in her own way.  &quot;Where is the<br/>
&gt; &gt;problem with black&quot;, I asked?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;It&#39;s sad&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Really&quot;?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Yes&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;No. Claire does not see this black color as sad.  *You* see the<br/>
&gt; &gt;black color as sad.  I like it.  Nice contrast&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I placed the black marker back within reach of Claire and said she<br/>
&gt; &gt;was free to choose any color she wishes and that her Marionette is fine<br/>
&gt; &gt;and beautiful.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I gently recapped my ideas.  The teacher said she thoroughly understood<br/>
&gt; &gt;my point of view, but went on to stress the importance of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;finished product. She discussed that the *parents* were going to see<br/>
&gt; &gt;the artwork.  She went on to tell me how much more &quot;free&quot; and &quot;open<br/>
&gt; &gt;minded&quot; she was.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I felt as if I were talking to a tree trunk.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Anyway - I was told the following week that I could not stay - that<br/>
&gt; &gt;no parents were permitted to stay.  Needless to say - I no longer<br/>
&gt; &gt;wanted to stay.  Claire and I left - went to the park to breath some<br/>
&gt; &gt;fresh air.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The pottery class that we attended months before at the same place<br/>
&gt; &gt;(Maison du Temps Libre - House of Free Time - Ha!) had the same<br/>
&gt; &gt;overwhelming structure and pressure.  Claire was enjoying forming<br/>
&gt; &gt;clay into a shape, then poking and sculpting it with a tool when she<br/>
&gt; &gt;was told to make a mobile.  Stars and moons were set in front of<br/>
&gt; &gt;here and she was told to quickly get going - with much rush and clapping.<br/>
&gt; &gt;She ignored the instruction, thoroughly engrossed in what she was doing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I mentioned she seemed to be enjoying what she was already making.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I explained the same stuff to this teacher, once again, as I had done<br/>
&gt; &gt;only moments early, just as I did with the other teacher.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Another tree trunk.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Gymnastics was even worse - but a better end to a story:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The teacher explained that no parents were permitted to cross the metal<br/>
&gt; &gt;barrier. This was unacceptable to Claire, as the &quot;class&quot; was being held<br/>
&gt; &gt;in the other corner of a huge gymnasium.  We bowed out but I hung out<br/>
&gt; &gt;to check out her &quot;program&quot; and to watch what was supposedly free choice<br/>
&gt; &gt; - using any and all of the gym equipment (one staying on the trampoline<br/>
&gt; &gt;for as long as one wanted - and moving onto the rings if one chose to,<br/>
&gt; &gt;for example...)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The teacher sat upon a &#39;horse&#39; and had a big queen paper hat on.<br/>
&gt; &gt;She sat upon this explaining something to all the children who sat<br/>
&gt; &gt;around her below.  This went on for about 10 minutes.  The children<br/>
&gt; &gt;all moved together - following the teachers instructions - back and<br/>
&gt; &gt;forth - and then gathering around her again.  I have no idea<br/>
&gt; &gt;what she was saying - her back was to me and she was far away...Seemed<br/>
&gt; &gt;to me, though, that these kids did little more than listen to the Queen<br/>
&gt; &gt;talk.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;In front of us, though, there was a group of boys - 6 - from ages 5 to<br/>
&gt; &gt;about 11.  They were not sitting and listening to someone talk - they<br/>
&gt; &gt;were *moving*. They jumped onto a &#39;horse&#39; from a spring board and flipped<br/>
&gt; &gt;off onto a huge thick mat.  The teacher, Jean Pierre, invited Claire,<br/>
&gt; &gt;who was watching and wanted to join in, into the line.  She did a few<br/>
&gt; &gt;jumps and was having a ball.  They did &quot;tarzan&quot; on the rings, swinging<br/>
&gt; &gt;out onto a huge mat. I took my shoes off and hung out by the edge of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;mats - crossing the No Parent barrier.  The queen didn&#39;t kick me out<br/>
&gt; &gt;and JP didn&#39;t seem to mind...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I asked later if it were possible for Claire to join the boys group.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;No way.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;She had to be in the baby class with only children her age (3/4).<br/>
&gt; &gt;This group - the *fun* group that *moved*, was only for boys.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve gone on much too long here - I just wanted to share that it is<br/>
&gt; &gt;my experience that any activity (or class - or book or program or idea)<br/>
&gt; &gt;*specifically designed for children*, often *stinks*.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It seems to me that incorporating children into the real world<br/>
&gt; &gt;- of all that we are already doing or choose to do - offers so much.<br/>
&gt; &gt;And so, if I feel like doing pottery - or if Claire feels like doing<br/>
&gt; &gt;some pottery - I&#39;ll get some clay and just do it.  Or take a class<br/>
&gt; &gt;for adults and bring her with me.  She can join in without limits that<br/>
&gt; &gt;are imposed on her simply because she is a child.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Last night, too, I saw a first ray of hope when Jean Luc, my husband,<br/>
&gt; &gt;told me he did understand the no schooling thing - that he wished<br/>
&gt; &gt;he had been free to choose to seek out freely what he wanted to know<br/>
&gt; &gt;- and without testing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks for reading my ramblings...<br/>

The three people who are signing the song are almost dancing as they sign - the<br/>
interpretation of the song as they<br/>
sing it through signing - is beautiful like a dance<br/>
we have this video and concur with your take and this is my favorite song as well:)<br/>
<br/>
I would like to learn more about sign language - not just letters but learning to<br/>
sign and understand.  Are there any good videos that you could recommend that are<br/>
very good?<br/>
a good place to start is dawn sign press.  this is a deaf owned business<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dawnsignpress.com/">http://www.dawnsignpress.com/</a>  they produce a set of videos called Signing Naturally<br/>
which are used by many colleges.  they also have lots of other stuff.   we have<br/>
Fingerspelling: Expressive & Receptive Fluency  which is very helpful in many ways,<br/>
like how to hold your hands so you won&#39;t get carpal tunnel or other degenerative<br/>
conditions, and how to read without identifying individual letters (something i<br/>
didn&#39;t realize i did naturally in english yet did not apply to reading<br/>
fingerspelling).   a really great book that can give you a good cultural<br/>
understanding is  A Journey into the DEAF-WORLD.   this place is a very good place<br/>
to check out because it&#39;s from the deaf culture and not the hearing culture.<br/>
<br/>
another good place is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.signenhancers.com/.">http://www.signenhancers.com/.</a>  this is owned by an asl<br/>
interpreter and also has a good selection especially in way of grammar and<br/>
interpreter skills but has lots of stuff as well.  what we have is from them is<br/>
their independent study of asl grammar called course 2001 and would highly recommend<br/>
it if you want more structure than the signing naturally offers (we have both and<br/>
i&#39;ve learned a lot from each and think they balance each other well)<br/>
<br/>
finally and the biggest company harris communications <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.harriscomm.com">http://www.harriscomm.com</a><br/>
they carry both dawn sign publications and sign enhancers, among others (their<br/>
catalog is over 150 pages,  though i can&#39;t seem to connect to their web site so<br/>
their voice tel# is 800-825-6758).   what we have from them is mouth morphemes which<br/>
is very helpful (and rene&#39;, our 4 year old son, really has fun with it because of<br/>
all the challenging/funny faces) and this rounds out our (and i would say any)<br/>
collection covering the most basic aspects of asl.<br/>
<br/>
(What&#39;s up about not being allowed to sign in some schools?)<br/>
this topic is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the injustices done to<br/>
deaf people.   the book i mentioned before journey into the deaf world can answer<br/>
this in great depth, if you want some good info that&#39;s a great place.   but for now<br/>
let me say it has to do with a standard method of &#39;disempowerment&#39; (something &#39;we<br/>
americans&#39; are perfecting).  if you keep people from bonding and forming a group<br/>
that can communicate with any sort of true mastery you will have &#39;slaves&#39;, a<br/>
subgroup without a &#39;voice&#39;.  the issue is so much deeper and more complex than this<br/>
(i.e. history of prejudice in terms of sub level intelligence, insanity etc.), and<br/>
the deaf are not alone in this plight.   there is a party line, some rhetoric about<br/>
how teaching asl will keep the kid from wanting to learn english and if the kid<br/>
doesn&#39;t learn english s/he will be at a disadvantage.   this might sound logical to<br/>
some but it fails to take into account that every infant strives to communicate with<br/>
those around them, and for a deaf baby, a spoken language is impossible to relate<br/>
to.   so, if deaf children are prevented from a natural form of communication<br/>
(sign/visual), the emotional isolation will most certainly take it&#39;s toll.   &#39;we&#39;<br/>
are always saying &#39;we must do what&#39;s best for the child&#39;, well in my opinion what is<br/>
best is to communicate and the only language a deaf person can truly master and have<br/>
equal advantage is sign (&quot;functionality&quot; in society be damned).  my question to the<br/>
people who push oralism is why can&#39;t the child (and parents) be taught both -to be a<br/>
stickler for one alone is just elitist garbage.<br/>
<br/>
expression often makes others feel so uncomfortable.  Too intimate,<br/>
<br/>
i think because asl itself really &#39;demands&#39; that you not be self-conscious and<br/>
really be involved physically (body and face) with what you are expressing, that it<br/>
runs contrary to every form of english language &#39;etiquette&#39;.  also because the deaf<br/>
rely on what they see and use this to identify and describe it proves to be all to<br/>
real for many speaking people who prefer to ignore what is right in front of their<br/>
face.<br/>

Very interesting and very sad, too.<br/>
<br/>
Sign language is very beautiful.  Claire and I just received a sign/song video<br/>
cassette.  Aside from some irritating songs about having no &quot;dessert&quot; until <br/>
you clean your plate and a little girl who never says please and is sent <br/>
off into the woods ntil she can &quot;learn&quot; to say please, it was a neat video.  <br/>
There is a song about the wind.  The three people who are signing the song <br/>
are almost dancing as they sign - the interpretation of the song as they <br/>
sing it through signing - is beautiful like a dance.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to learn more about sign language - not just letters but learning<br/>
to sign and understand.  Are there any good videos that you could recommend <br/>
that are very good? <br/>
<br/>
(What&#39;s up about not being allowed to sign in some schools?) <br/>
<br/>
There seems to be a very special deep communication between people who are<br/>
not speaking and sign.  Makes me think back on the time when Claire was<br/>
a newborn baby.  Language seemed to get in the way of a very deep and real<br/>
communication.  Deaf people seem to have a special connection/link that<br/>
speaking and hearing people have &quot;lost&quot;.  Interesting what I read on<br/>
the art site about how this special connection and expression often <br/>
makes others feel so uncomfortable.  Too intimate, I suppose - distance <br/>
and pretentiousness become more &quot;comfortable&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-468463533">hi,<br/>
<br/>
personally i think asl is a beautiful language.  two things i would recommend is<br/>
videos over books because it&#39;s hard to really get all the aspects like movement,<br/>
orientation and mouth/facial expression from a book.   the second would be to<br/>
meet deaf people - i&#39;m admittedly am very poor at this- i&#39;m kind of a &#39;home<br/>
body&#39; but if you can you will learn much faster.  just some ideas.  being deaf<br/>
is such a different reality from hearing.   i never realized how much of the<br/>
information i unconsciously use i get from hearing.   it was a bit of an<br/>
adjustment for me to live with a deaf person - honestly he was the first deaf<br/>
person i met and on our first date he taught me the alphabet.  but often i envy<br/>
him so i don&#39;t think of being deaf as a loss but rather a shift.<br/>
