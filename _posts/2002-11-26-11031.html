<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063033011">Don&#39;t forget, Mary B and her daughter Tara are going to be on Oprah <br/>
tomorrow.<br/>
Also, I forgot to tell Nancy HAPPY BIRTHDAY (belated that is). I was <br/>
supposed to remind everyone on the 15th, the real day of celebrating <br/>
her birth, but I totally ignored the note on my computer (doh!!).<br/>
So Happy Birthday Nancy!! The world is a better place with you here.<br/>
<br/>
And I can&#39;t wait to see Mary B live!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Ren. You are very sweet, and you made my day! Ugh, what a bad day I <br/>
had. :o(  What is on Oprah tomorrow? Rather, why are Mary and her daughter <br/>
going to be on? Unschooling on Oprah? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656848886">-=-We love getting letters and e-mails from you! Especially when you tell us <br/>
that something you saw on the show changed your life...-=-<br/>

(The description of the Oprah show for Tuesday/today/11/26)<br/>
<br/>
Mary said they might only be in the front row.  Any updates now that it&#39;s <br/>
been taped?<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t going to be about homeschooling, but about the show with Jamie Lee <br/>
Curtis talking about body image changing the way Mary felt about and treated <br/>
her daughter, I think.<br/>
