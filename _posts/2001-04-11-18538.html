<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700671497">I came across this and thought I would pass it on because of the recent<br/>
discussion of cats & birds.  Family Pastimes has a cooperative (players<br/>
work together rather than against each other) board game called MAX<br/>
(which won a top-rating from Canada Toy Testing).  Here is the<br/>
description from the catalog:<br/>
<br/>
We must help get the little Creatures safely home before Max, the Tomcat,<br/>
catches them.  In an exciting way, children learn logic, consultation &<br/>
decision making.  An important issue to discuss is also raised: we don&#39;t<br/>
like Max catching those Little Ones, yet we recognize that he is a<br/>
natural hunter.  How do we resolve this in our minds & hearts?  Let&#39;s<br/>
talk it over.  Ages: 4-7 Play alone or with as many as 8 players.  ($14<br/>
US, includes shipping)  1-888-267-4414 or <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:fp@...">fp@...</a><br/>
