<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130057321">&lt;&lt;My name is Lorrie. I am new to the list and to unschooling. I have three kids.  17 yo girl, 7 yo boy and a 10 month old boy.  My daughter is unfortunately a victim of the system.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Lorrie. May I ask you what you mean when you say your daughter is a &quot;victim&quot;? Is she still in school or is she home now?<br/>

When I said my daughter is a victim of the system I meant on that was passed <br/>
on year to year even though she was not at her level.<br/>
<br/>
I fought with the school for years because my daughter started have a lot of <br/>
trouble in school at about 4th grade.  They kept telling me that unless she <br/>
was failing there was nothing they could.  When the schools still allowed <br/>
this I sent her to summer school every summer even if the school did not <br/>
recommend it.  I finally had her tested at a private facility and took the <br/>
results to the school.  The results said that by the time my daughter got to <br/>
7th grade she would no longer be able to cope in school.  Well, the school <br/>
said they did not recognize out side testing.  They said they would give <br/>
their own test but never did.  She is now in 11th grade and still reads and <br/>
writes on a 6/7th grade level.<br/>
<br/>
By the time I found out about homeschooling and persuaded my husband to let <br/>
me do it, he was afraid to allow my daughter as she was so close to <br/>
graduating.  I try to work with her however, we fight a lot.  She thinks I&#39;m <br/>
picking on her.  She has friends who she likes to get help from so I guess <br/>
that is better than nothing.  She has finally showed an interest in reading <br/>
other than required reading so I guess that is good too.  My only fear is <br/>
that she thinks she is too stupid to go to college.  I just keep talking to <br/>
her everyday to see how she is doing.<br/>
