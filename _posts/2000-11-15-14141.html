<div id="ygrps-yiv-250531133">Things seem to be going well and bang I feel as though we have gone <br/>
backwards again.<br/>
Just to recap my dd is 12yrs old and we removed her from school in <br/>
may of this year.  After a few weeks of school at home we moved onto <br/>
unschooling - it was/is very new to me and I did what I was adviced, <br/>
let her deschool and do what ever she chose to do for a while - I had <br/>
just about given up on her ever doing any learning again when she <br/>
surprised me by working with her math work book along with other <br/>

watching TV and moping around the house bored to death.  She cant <br/>
wait for 3.30pm when her friend gets home from school.<br/>
I suggest we have a day out. perhaps the museum or somthing......even <br/>
a walk in the park or do some gardening - she gets very short with me <br/>
when I talk to her about doing something with our days instead of <br/>
lying around bored..........................There is a h/s swimming <br/>
club at the local pools on a tuesday, i thought she might like to go <br/>
there.  I for one would like to meet some more h/s ers - dd doesnt <br/>
want to.  She hates meeting new people.....<br/>
I want her to make her own choices to what she wants to do - but this <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275225757">Hi Marianne;<br/>
<br/>
Could it just be that your daughter is a typical pubescent 12 year old<br/>
with all the hormonal changes etc?  That would explain the moodiness,<br/>
laziness, and uninspired lifestyle.  Young teens, like pregnant or<br/>
PMS-ing women, tend to be depressed in a hormonally-induced way.  I hate<br/>
to give you such news but this could continue for the next few<br/>
years?!...After a transitional phase she could yet get back on track on<br/>
her own, with your loving support.  Then she&#39;ll be ready to move on.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought, Good Luck!<br/>
<br/>
Sonia<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331645240">Hi Marianne<br/>
Wow when you describe your daughter it sounded as if you were describing my<br/>
son.<br/>
I have no answers for you I&#39;m afraid just letting you know you are not alone<br/>
with these feelings, I am in exactly the same situation.<br/>
Matt has an odd spurt of doing something and then it&#39;s gone as soon as it<br/>
came and he is back to being bored, playing computer games or watching t.v.<br/>
He would like to meet individual H.Ers but they have to be the same age as<br/>
him (his words) but he won&#39;t go to any groups to meet up with people to<br/>
start with.<br/>
It can be exhausting constantly suggesting things and having them turned<br/>
down.<br/>
I just wish he could find an interest of his own.<br/>

     Would your son be interested in a penpal? I don&#39;t know how old your son <br/>
is but mine is 11. He is very quiet and would never go to any type of <br/>

has done wonders for him. (Hi Soni,Nika, and Oleksa) His address is <br/>

I can talk my son into it. My sons name is Ashton.<br/>

My son is also 11, he thinks it would be a great idea to mail each other. We<br/>
are just about to go out but Matthew says he will send a mail when he gets<br/>
back.<br/>
My daughter is 8 if your 7 yr old son does&#39;nt mind writing to a girl. Let me<br/>
know and then she will also write this afternoon.<br/>
Thank you for your message   :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-410541855">I hope you&#39;re all reading at www.unschooling.com and not just here.  This <br/>
list is sometimes a little like a few people sitting on the lawn outside a <br/>
building in which there&#39;s a gigantic, happy homeschooling convention going <br/>
on.  GET IN THERE!!!!<br/>
<br/>
-=- I had  just about given up on her ever doing any learning again when she <br/>
 surprised me by working with her math work book along with other <br/>
 learning things. -=-<br/>
<br/>
HUGE alarms are going off in me about this.  If a parent is hoping that <br/>
unschooling will result in a child somehow wanting to do schoolwork, or if <br/>
the parent has the world divided into &quot;learning things&quot; and lazy nothingness, <br/>
unschooling is going to be invisible to that parent.   The overlay or the <br/>
template the parent has with which to measure success needs to be a vision of <br/>
unschooling, of learning in and from everything.  If that template looks like <br/>
school, then the parent hasn&#39;t deschooled her own self and unschooling is <br/>
doomed to fail.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-she gets very short with me when I talk to her about doing something with <br/>
our days instead of lying around bored-=-<br/>
<br/>
Lying around bored *is* doing something.  Do you know what she&#39;s thinking?  <br/>
What she&#39;s doing in her head?  And when you &quot;talk to her about doing <br/>
something&quot; is it a shaming speech telling her she&#39;s wrong but if she does <br/>
something that looks like school she&#39;ll be right?  If you make it sound fun <br/>
and you smile and ask her to go with you to do something (it doesn&#39;t have to <br/>
look like a school field trip and it doesn&#39;t have to involve other <br/>
homeschoolers), why wouldn&#39;t she want to go?<br/>
<br/>
Are there other things for her to do at home?  Are there crafts kits, cool <br/>
cake mixes and a new pan, art supplies, videos of musicals?  A <br/>
keyboard/piano?  What are her options?  What alluring new and different stuff <br/>
is there to stimulate her thinking?  If the answer&#39;s not much, how about a <br/>
mother/daughter trip to the thrift store?  And don&#39;t look just on the games <br/>
and books shelves.  Look in those little bags of weird kitchen and sewing and <br/>
deck-of-cards and sets-of-candles stuff.  Do you know how to dip candles?  <br/>
Ratty old candles can be recycled before Christmas.  Does she know how to <br/>
play rummy?  Poker?  Solitaire?  You could get out of there with hours of <br/>
thoughtful, smiley fun for a couple of bucks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I want her to make her own choices to what she wants to do - but this <br/>
bordom is really getting to me - when we could be doing so much more -<br/>
 and life is so short-=-<br/>
<br/>
When the boredom is really getting to her, she&#39;ll do something.  Life is so <br/>
short that shaming kids for a few days or weeks of stillness is not a good <br/>
use of life.  For her to make her own choices she has to HAVE choices, and if <br/>
the best thing she can think of to do is sit alone, something&#39;s wrong with <br/>
her other options.  If she DOES get out of her room and do something <br/>
interesting, is she going to hear anything remotely resembling &quot;It&#39;s about <br/>
time&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m so proud that you broke out of your useless funk&quot; or &quot;Now <br/>
you&#39;re homeschooling like you&#39;re supposed to&quot;?   Doing that could send her <br/>
back into her room, I&#39;m guessing.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want her to find interests for your sake or hers?  Will she get gold <br/>
stars for doing learning stuff?  The learning itself should be the joyous <br/>
reward.  <br/>
<br/>
Someone else wrote: <br/>
-=- I hate to give you such news but this could continue for the next few<br/>
years?!...After a transitional phase she could yet get back on track on<br/>
her own, with your loving support. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I wish to paraphrase the last part of that.  In this sensitive stage, with <br/>
her just barely out of school (summer didn&#39;t count at all for deschooling, <br/>
and you&#39;re still in the first semester of not-at-school), with her probably <br/>
in the throes of puberty, you could screw it up so that she won&#39;t get back on <br/>
track if you shame and pressure her instead of loving her and being with her.<br/>
<br/>
Again, please, go into the folders and read about what unschooling really <br/>
looks like.  Replace that math workbook with something surprising and happy <br/>
for a while (or forever).  <br/>
<br/>
If you believe that learning always looks like schoolwork, just put her in <br/>
school.  <br/>
If you&#39;re determined to have her out, find out what learning looks like in <br/>
the real world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206075267">From  my experience with having gotten to the other side of 15 with two <br/>
kids, I have found that the years from about 11 or 12 - 15 tend to be very <br/>
inwardly focused ones. Huge internal changes are happening and kids need a <br/>
lot of time to &quot;lie fallow&quot; as it were. Then somewhere around 15 they start <br/>
to re-emerge and engage in more outwardly focused pursuits. Hang in there! <br/>
I&#39;ll write more later when I have more time.-Amalia-</div>

Thank you so much. I know this advice was meant for<br/>
someone else, but it hit home with a bang! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480707229">To add to Sandra&#39;s reply (Hi Sandra!! :-) ) I was wondering what <br/>
interests you have?  Does your daughter see you getting involved <br/>
with stuff, for profit or fun or just because it&#39;s got to be done?  <br/>
Unschooling is hard to get your head round if you&#39;re used to the <br/>
&#39;schooled&#39; perspective.  It&#39;s not about Maths or English or Physics <br/>
or French, it&#39;s about learning what you want/need to learn, when <br/>
you want/need to learn it.  If that means learning how to deal with <br/>
not having someone else program your time, then that&#39;s a useful <br/>
lesson, I think.  My children switched the telly off yesterday, <br/>
without being asked, in the morning while I was still asleep!  <br/>
When I figured it out, I nearly cheered!  My eldest is learning that <br/>
she can walk away from situations she doesn&#39;t want to be in, and <br/>
the youngest is learning that people don&#39;t want to be around her <br/>
when she&#39;s behaving bossily.  Not bad for nearly-4 and 5yo&#39;s :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you really want advice (and I don&#39;t like giving &#39;advice&#39; it&#39;s really <br/>
tricky, information is much more useful) I&#39;d say carry on relaxing, <br/>
keep on offering her choices, don&#39;t suggest anything that remotely <br/>
whiffs of &#39;education,&#39; and leave her to it.  Wish someone had done <br/>
this for me when I was 12.<br/>
