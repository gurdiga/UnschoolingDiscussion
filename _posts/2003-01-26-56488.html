Here are the New Testatment references to Jesus clearing out the temple:<br/>
<br/>
Mathew 21:12-13 (NAS)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all those who were buying and<br/>
selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and<br/>
the seats of those who were selling doves.  And He said to them, &quot;It is<br/>
written, My House shall be called a House of Prayer, but you are making it a<br/>
robbers den.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
John 2:14-16 (NAS)<br/>
<br/>
And He found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves,<br/>
and the money changers seated at their tables.  And He made a scourge of<br/>
cords, and drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen;<br/>
and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their<br/>
tables; and to those who were selling the doves He said, &quot;Take these things<br/>
away; stop making My Father&#39;s house a place of business.&quot;<br/>
