Dinosaur &#39;mummy&#39; still holds part of last meal <br/>
<br/>
October 22 2002 <br/>
<br/>
Move over, Ice Man. Scientists have found a 77-million-year-old dinosaur so<br/>
well preserved<br/>
that they&#39;re calling it a &quot;mummy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Most of the leathery skin on this creature, discovered two summers ago in<br/>
Montana, is<br/>
intact, though turned to mineral. Its throat and shoulder muscle are still<br/>
there. Its face retains<br/>
traces of its nail-like beak. Its discoverers even say it contains the<br/>
remnants of its last meal,<br/>
a half-digested mass of plant material.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Once in a blue moon we have an opportunity to get greater insight into life&#39;s<br/>
prehistory,&quot;<br/>
says Nate Murphy, curator of paleontology at the Phillips County Museum in<br/>
Malta, Mont.,<br/>
where the fossil is being studied. Murphy described the find this month at a<br/>
news conference<br/>
in Norman, during the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology annual meeting.<br/>
<br/>
The creature was a duck-billed dinosaur known as Brachylophosaurus.<br/>
<br/>
In life it would have been a two-legged, plant-eating animal that measured<br/>
about 20 feet (6.1<br/>
metres) long. It died while just three to four years old, and is the first<br/>
juvenile of this species<br/>
ever found, Murphy says.<br/>
<br/>
The young Brachylophosaurus may have died in an isolated place such as on a<br/>
sandbar,<br/>
then dried out before becoming buried by sand, Murphy speculates. That could<br/>
have allowed<br/>
the dinosaur to fossilise with much of its muscle and other tissue intact.<br/>
<br/>
Paleontologists occasionally find pieces of dinosaur-skin impressions, or<br/>
other soft tissue,<br/>
but usually such features are lost when the dinosaur turns to stone.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All too rarely do paleontologists find more than bones and teeth,&quot; says K.<br/>
Christopher<br/>
Beard, a paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, who was not<br/>
involved in<br/>
the work.<br/>
<br/>
Often such discoveries are controversial. For instance, a North Carolina<br/>
dinosaur, once<br/>
thought to have a fossilised heart intact inside its rib cage, may contain<br/>
nothing more than a<br/>
rock.<br/>
<br/>
Still, Murphy is confident that he has a scientific treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Only a few such well-preserved dinosaurs have been found before, he says. One<br/>
is the<br/>
dinosaur mummy discovered nearly a century ago that is at the American Museum<br/>
of Natural<br/>
History in New York. Another belongs to a natural history museum in Frankfurt,<br/>
Germany.<br/>
<br/>
A third dinosaur mummy was found in Alberta, Canada, but was sunk by the<br/>
Germans during<br/>
World War I as it was being shipped to the British Museum, Murphy says.<br/>
<br/>
An amateur fossil hunter discovered the new specimen during an expedition to<br/>
Montana&#39;s<br/>
Lower Judith River Formation in July 2000. Team leaders nicknamed the dinosaur<br/>
Leonardo,<br/>
after one of a pair of lovers&#39; names found scrawled nearby with the date 1916,<br/>
says team<br/>
member Mark Thompson.<br/>
<br/>
In 2001, the excavators removed the fossil in a single six-tonne block, trying<br/>
to preserve as<br/>
much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Calling it a mummy is a bit misleading, Murphy says.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike Egyptian human mummies, which were elaborately prepared after death,<br/>
the dinosaur<br/>
underwent a rare series of natural circumstances to keep it preserved.<br/>
<br/>
The team plans to study what allowed the fossil to stay so intact.</div>
