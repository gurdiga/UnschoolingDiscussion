Hi Carli,
<br>SOunds to me you are unschooling!&nbsp; :)
<br>YOu are following what your daughter enjoys doing.&nbsp; That is the
essence of unschooling to me.
<br>Enjoy your fun!

<p><tt>Hi, my name is Carli and I just joined this list.&nbsp; My oldest
daughter is 4</tt>
<br><tt>1/2 years old.&nbsp; We (my hubby and I) know that we want to do
homeschooling.</tt>
<br><tt>I am just not sure what avenue to take.&nbsp; Unschooling philosophies
are</tt>
<br><tt>appealing to me and make sense.</tt>
<p><tt>My question is, what do you do?&nbsp; I got a pretty good idea of
what</tt>
<br><tt>unschooling is not.</tt>
<p><tt>Currently my daughter loves the time that her sister takes a nap
and we do</tt>
<br><tt>&quot;homeschooling.&quot;&nbsp; This is more a term than an actuality.&nbsp;
But a couple</tt>
<br><tt>times a week, we do practice writing letters and spelling her name.&nbsp;
On</tt>
<br><tt>occassion I have been teaching her the names of different coins
and</tt>
<br><tt>teaching her how to classify fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; These
are both done</tt>
<br><tt>through game like activities.&nbsp; I chose these 2 areas, because
she seems to</tt>
<br><tt>have been picking up on it on her own and I wanted to strengthen
her</tt>
<br><tt>knowledge.&nbsp; Anyway, the time we do spend is usually focused
time.&nbsp; It&#39;s</tt>
<br><tt>easiest to do when her 2 year old sister is napping.&nbsp; Oh,
and we always do</tt>
<br><tt>some craft or cooking activity too.</tt>
<p><tt>Like I said, she absolutely loves this time, and begs for it everyday.&nbsp;
I</tt>
<br><tt>get the feeling that unschooling would be much less casual than
this</tt>
<br><tt>focused time I have been spending.</tt>
<p><tt>In your opinion, what are some things I should be doing.&nbsp; And
should I</tt>
<br><tt>continue what I am doing, since she enjoys it so much?</tt>
<p><tt>Thanks a lot.</tt>
<p><tt>Carli</tt>

&gt;  Are you a well-balanced and happy person?  {Smile}  Can you support yourself<br/>
&gt; and live a &quot;normal&quot; life?  I&#39;m basically asking because I have these fears<br/>
&gt; sometimes in the middle of the night that I might be doing a horrible<br/>
&gt; disservice to my daughter as I know she doesn&#39;t know all of the science,<br/>
&gt; history, math, etc. as other kids her age.  In my waking moments, I know that<br/>
&gt; she is becoming the most incredible human being and has so many special gifts<br/>

&gt; I would love it if you could share some of your thoughts.  Thanks,  Jackie<br/>

(says my daughter the 12-year-old scientist), and hence gravity acts upon all<br/>
parts equally, keeping it spherical-like.  HOWEVER, she points out, the earth<br/>
(and other planets) &quot;bulge&quot; at the equator due to centrifugal force -- the<br/>
spinning of the earth tends to encourage &quot;spinning off&quot;, making the diameter<br/>
there the widest.  She points out that you can actually see this clearly with<br/>
Jupiter (a gas planet) that spins very quickly, and has a big bulge in the<br/>
center.<br/>

So here&#39;s a another question for all of you who haven&#39;t read my book:  &quot;What<br/>

which has less density than land, and therefore the gravitational pull upon it<br/>
is less.  Secondly, a theory holds that when the moon split off from earth, the<br/>
distribution of material was unequal, and what we live on still contains<br/>
vestiges of that split.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>well imo semi spherical is rather general (as is round) and lacks scientific<br/>
exactness as well.  regardless round is highly descriptive and communicates a<br/>
genuine quality whether is be among scientist or lay people.<br/>
<br/>
i am curious has to why both you and david (et al) have a problem with the use<br/>
in this context.  maybe my understanding of the word round is too broad but when<br/>
i read the definition in webster&#39;s it was exactly what i thought it meant and it<br/>
seems to be use correctly.  does your problem stem from  understanding round as<br/>
a 2d quality and not a 3d one?<br/>
