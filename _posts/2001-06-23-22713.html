<div id="ygrps-yiv-728489727">Dear Molly, <br/>
A debate will always have at least two sides.  My personal advise is this. Use &quot;I&quot; statements when speaking to her.  She can not debate you when you say, &quot; I feel my children will greatly benefit from...&quot; .  Will she try to say you do not feel that way? No. (at least I would hope not)  Next remember:  Never raise your voice when you should reinforce your argument.  That keeps a cool head and gives you the advantage. She will likely not see it coming...you have the advantage of role playing with your husband every conceivable thought she will have to change your mind...which has already been made up.  Be VERY clear of the laws and follow them to the letter.  Finally, if you feel the need to pull out the BIG guns and you feel really gutsie, encourage her to be supportive of your decision to catch the children up from being &quot;behind&quot; under her tutilage.  Above all do not forget she is your mom.  My mom didn&#39;t always agree with my decisions either(although she and Daddy were my backbone about the education of the girls-even before hubby), but now she is gone...and missed daily.  Try not to say things you believe will alter your longterm familial relationship.  I&#39;m sorry you are feeling these stressful concerns.  You never know, maybe it won&#39;t be as bad as you think.  : ) <br/>

P.S.  Crystal:  I do not know how to do that thing about sending the e-mails without the stuff tagging along, but I will learn VERY soon.  Forgive this time please.  I am new with the computer but learning q day.  : ) <br/>

Subject: RE: writing and unschoolin<br/>
<br/>
I have a daughter who wasn&#39;t really writing at 9. At that time we were still<br/>
doing &#39;school at home&#39; and I tried to &#39;make&#39; her write. It didn&#39;t do much<br/>
good.(there&#39;s my regret, trying to force her to write) I finally left it<br/>
alone. Now, at almost 15 she writes a lot. Sometimes out of need, sometimes<br/>
for pleasure. She would rather type than write but she&#39;ll do either. Her<br/>
penmanship isn&#39;t great, but neither is mine or her Dad&#39;s so I&#39;m not worried<br/>
about it. My 12 yr old wrote much earlier, and much prettier. My 10 yr old<br/>
who is just now reading can write beautifully, knows the basic rules (spaces<br/>
between words, periods, cap. letters) but only writes thank you notes and to<br/>
label his intricate drawings of inventions and such, nothing else. His time<br/>
will come. As long as they have the tools, when the need or desire to write<br/>
comes, they will put it all together amazingly fast and be just fine.<br/>

<br/>
Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list and subscribed because I am<br/>
interested in the opinions of other unschooling moms<br/>
and how your children have learned writing skills. We<br/>
unschool in the sense of trusting that our children<br/>
will know when they are ready to take on tasks and<br/>
following their lead for what they want to learn and<br/>
how they want to learn it. My daughter is nine this<br/>
month and took off on reading about 6 months ago. She<br/>
spends a fair amount of time reading both fiction and<br/>
non-fiction, but also still loves to spend time with<br/>
her various critters and engage in make-believe play<br/>
with her sibling and other children. She loves to<br/>
draw, but she HATESs to write. If she wants to leave<br/>
herself a note, for example, to bring her tortoise in<br/>
for the night instead of writing out the words she<br/>
will draw a picture of the tortoise grazing and post<br/>
that where it reminds her. I have been fine with this<br/>
approach and have trusted that when she is at a point<br/>
in her life where she wants to truly express her<br/>
feelings she will feel compelled to write. I have<br/>
kind of expected this will happen in adolescence.<br/>
Recently an event happened that is causing me to<br/>
question my judgement. Has anyone else out there left<br/>
it up to divine providence that their children will<br/>
indeed want to, and then proceed to, learn to write<br/>
when they are ready? Has anyone any regrets about<br/>
not being more proactive with their child in teaching<br/>
writing? Thanks in advance for any input.<br/>
<br/>

knew then that it was a crock and I still do.Sorry I feel very strongly about <br/>
this.<br/>

My dd and I just do our thing everyday. There is no sit down and learn <br/>
time. Many times we learn while driving,walking,and whenever. It just seems <br/>
to happen. It is very spontaneous and we love it. It is 99% child led here. <br/>
She asks the questions I answer or look it up. I am finding out how much I do <br/>
not know. :o)<br/>
<br/>
My dd learn to write one day from asking me to write letters on a box I <br/>
was addressing so she could copy them. It worked. The box luckily was going <br/>
to a relative,it was covered in letters. This was just an example to show you <br/>
it will happen.<br/>

My daughter is 6 and hates to write as well, though when she wants to she<br/>
will write herself notes (spelled phonetically). Her handwriting (printing,<br/>
actually) isn&#39;t that great and my mother keeps harping on me to &quot;make&quot; her<br/>
practice. Nope. I just figure if she wants to she will, or when she&#39;s older<br/>
she&#39;ll learn to type. If your daughter can write but chooses not to, that&#39;s<br/>
fine. As long as she can express herself on paper when she wants to. And<br/>
if she can&#39;t, she&#39;ll ask for help when she wants to.<br/>

&gt; We unschool because we want to choose the lives we lead, instead of having<br/>
&gt; them decided for us. We want our children to have the opportunity to do<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; same. To badly paraphrase Thoreau, there are no philosophers anymore,<br/>
only<br/>
&gt; philosophy teachers. I think that&#39;s true, and I&#39;d rather be and raise a<br/>
&gt; philosopher.<br/>
&gt; Do your children currently go to pre-school? If not, and they&#39;re spending<br/>
&gt; their days with you, you are already doing what we do here. If it feels<br/>
&gt; right now, there&#39;s no reason to believe it won&#39;t feel right when they turn<br/>

&gt; Unschoolers,<br/>
&gt; My wife, Kim Jansen, and I recently moved to the woods were I work<br/>
&gt; as a Challenge Course Manager. We live on site at an Environmental<br/>
&gt; Education Center that serves about 20,000 people a year. We choose<br/>
&gt; the green land for our three boys; Tristan (4 years old), Chase and<br/>
&gt; Devon (2 year old twins). For the last two months we&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; discussing the idea of home schooling and this is our first inquiries<br/>
&gt; to people who are doing the do. Our question is this: Why did you<br/>
&gt; choose to unschool?<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve read information about benefits and other reasons to go this<br/>
&gt; route but we&#39;re eager to hear from people involved right this moment.<br/>
&gt; If you have any other advice or suggested reading please feel free to<br/>
&gt; contact us. Please e-mail me directly. Be well,<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; like him. We&#39;re choosing a different way to live but aside from ideas<br/>
&gt; and words we&#39;re very concerned about the practical application of<br/>

&gt; everyone here) is to read the library and archives at www.unschooling.com,<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; HEM&#39;s site, at NHEN&#39;s site. There is a wealth of current information<br/>
added<br/>
&gt; to daily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Read John Holt if you haven&#39;t already. Teach Your Own is my<br/>
recommendation<br/>
&gt; if you&#39;re only going to read one. Learning all the Time and Never Too<br/>
Late<br/>
&gt; inspired me too.<br/>

&gt; Dear Ann,<br/>
&gt; If you have ANY questions about it: condition, manufacturer&#39;s warranty,<br/>
etc. etc.,<br/>
&gt; ask BEFORE you place a bid. If they don&#39;t answer you back, or don&#39;t give<br/>
an answer<br/>
&gt; that satisfies you, don&#39;t bid. Wait. Another item just like it will come<br/>
along.<br/>
&gt; If it turns out not to be what was advertised on the eBay site, try to<br/>
resolve any<br/>
&gt; problems with the seller. If nothing gets settled to your satisfaction,<br/>
turn them<br/>
&gt; in to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:abuse@...">abuse@...</a>.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Having said all that, most people selling on eBay are wonderful people to<br/>
deal with.<br/>
&gt; I have bought several items (too many items!) and have only had one bad<br/>
turn.<br/>
&gt; But, ask questions first, bid second.<br/>

&gt; We bought our digital camera on ebay (and my wedding dress and veil and<br/>
&gt; tiara and all our kids&#39; tuxes and my wedding stationary and and and...).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My rule of thumb is to *only* buy from vendors who have sold a *ton* and<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; have been selling for several months. Also, many times I will write<br/>
someone<br/>
&gt; privately and make the sale that way. They often have more than one of the<br/>
&gt; same product and will sometimes sell for cheaper because I save them the<br/>
&gt; hassle of putting the item up for bid (and the cost, albeit minimal).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So if you know exactly what product you are looking for, check out the<br/>
&gt; person&#39;s selling history, other items up for bid, rating, etc. This tells<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; a lot about what kind of seller the person is. And also keep in mind a<br/>
good<br/>
&gt; ebayer will be as leery of you (first time buyer) as you are of them. They<br/>
&gt; have a lot to lose too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve never had a bad ebay experience. I did buy something once that wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; exactly what I expected (a toy - the picture made it look *much* larger<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; it was but clearly stated the size) but I am still extremely happy with it<br/>
&gt; and that was *my* error.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When we bought our digital camera, we also negotiated (behind the scenes,<br/>
&gt; after we won the auction) for extras at a lower price. A bag, an extra<br/>
&gt; battery, etc.<br/>
