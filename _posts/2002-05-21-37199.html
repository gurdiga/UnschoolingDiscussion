<div id="ygrps-yiv-325567764">Quick intro: I&#39;m mainly a lurker just now researching and<br/>
deciding about h-schooling or school-building schooling.  My son is <br/>
only going to be 3 this year, so I obviously have some time to <br/>
decide.  I already know I do NOT want him to go to preschool, which <br/>
is a strange thing in this neighborhood, apparently.  That is what <br/>
started me on this information-gathering quest.  =)  I guess we <br/>
unschool already, as he has learned his ABC&#39;s, counting to 20, <br/>
colors, shapes, etc as well as some Spanish just by playing and <br/>
reading books and watching TV and such.  My question is about the <br/>
comment below:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Making a game for her would still be &quot;doing school.&quot;  Why not just <br/>
 </span></blockquote>turn the TV on and watch the Price is Right???   Or go to the mall <br/>
and guess prices with her and then look at the price tags.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
How come going to the store and guessing at tags is ok but<br/>
&quot;making&quot; a game  which I&#39;m not even sure what that<br/>
entails  is not <br/>
unschooling?  I mean, if a child is interested in the artsy-crafty <br/>
part of making a game, which I am imagining will be cutting and <br/>
pasting things with construction paper or maybe setting up the <br/>
playroom or kitchen or whatever in a game-show fashion, why is that <br/>
not valid?  Just curious.  <br/>
<br/>
If you say you&#39;re an &quot;unschooler,&quot; do you have to NEVER<br/>
pick up pen <br/>
and paper or whatever?  Writing something down or doing anything <br/>
organized or scheduled is not unschooling?  I just thought U-S was <br/>
more a mindset of &quot;we&#39;re not going to follow anyone<br/>
else&#39;s schedule, <br/>
curriculum, etc&quot; or we don&#39;t believe you have to learn XYZ<br/>
by a <br/>
certain time or even EVER!  Would you care to elaborate to a<br/>
&quot;newbie- <br/>
lurker&quot; ?  TIA!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not so much the what but the why. Just about any activity a child has<br/>
the option of saying no thanks to can be unschooling. But it&#39;s why the<br/>
parent is offering that activity over another activity that determines<br/>
whether it&#39;s unschooling or not.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent is still of the mindset that math must be taught, then going to<br/>
the trouble of making up a fun game that involves math more than likely has<br/>
&quot;math mastery&quot; behind it as a motive. So it&#39;s just helpful in terms of<br/>
&quot;getting&quot; unschooling to suggest that people trying to understand<br/>
unschooling not do such things. It&#39;s a whole lot better for such a parent to<br/>
go out into the world and get used to seeing math in its wild state. The<br/>
math involved in real things with real prices that reflect real social and<br/>
economic processes in the real world is more meaningful -- because the<br/>
numbers are in their meaningful context -- than made up prices. It&#39;s the<br/>
difference between a child adding 27+14 on paper and a child having $27 and<br/>
getting $14 for a big chore and figuring out if she has enough money for<br/>
that game she wants to buy.<br/>
<br/>
So the suggestion was mostly as a way of breaking that mindset of needing to<br/>
do something artificial to get the child from where they are to where you<br/>
want them to be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you organize and pick up paper and pen for yourself in the process of<br/>
living life? Then that&#39;s the type of thing that unschooled kids will be<br/>
doing if they want to, or asking for help doing if they need to.<br/>
<br/>
An individual child may need organization or schedules to feel comfortable<br/>
with how the day runs just because that&#39;s part of their personality.<br/>
<br/>
But organization and schedules aren&#39;t necessary for learning. That&#39;s the<br/>
type of thinking it&#39;s helpful to break out of when trying to get<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
colors, shapes, etc… as well as some Spanish just by playing and <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Any kid with sufficient exposure would learn those, so it&#39;s not &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
that causes toddlers to learn, it&#39;s being human that causes toddlers to learn.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How come going to the store and guessing at tags is ok but<br/>
<br/>
&quot;making&quot; a game – which I&#39;m not even sure what that<br/>
<br/>
entails – is not <br/>
<br/>
unschooling? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Making a game which was created for the purpose of something educational to <br/>
do is a little like drawing a picture of a sunset with crayons, never looking <br/>
away from that paper, no matter what glorious REAL sunset is unfolding right <br/>
there in the real sky if you just look up from that paper.<br/>
<br/>
When people are learning how to get away from school and schooling and <br/>
teaching and ideas about scholarly education, they need to get AWAY from <br/>
it--180 degrees, not five degrees.  If people play an educational game and <br/>
their kids learn the material, the parents and kids might then believe that <br/>
the game was necessary for that learning, and will look for another <br/>
educational game instead of just being alive in the world where the same <br/>
information exists in other forms.<br/>
<br/>
We have educational games, but they&#39;re just mixed in with any old games and <br/>
puzzles.  We haven&#39;t made the distinction between &quot;educational&quot; and &quot;fun,&quot; <br/>
and therefor at our house there is no distinction.  At first this probably <br/>
seems like blatant nonsense, but when you get more into unschooling you&#39;ll <br/>
understand it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you say you&#39;re an &quot;unschooler,&quot; do you have to NEVER<br/>
<br/>
pick up pen and paper or whatever? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, that&#39;s not a good guess.  And &quot;You never use books!?&quot; is not a good guess <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
There is picking up pen and paper, and there is picking up pen and paper in a <br/>
schoolish or teacherly fashion.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the materials as much as it is the philosophy and belief.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Writing something down or doing anything <br/>
<br/>
organized or scheduled is not unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.  But if you organize and schedule your life in a schoolish way it&#39;s not <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I just thought U-S was more a mindset of &quot;we&#39;re not going to follow anyone<br/>
<br/>
else&#39;s schedule, curriculum, etc…&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re following any curriculum at all, you&#39;ll be missing the happy <br/>
unfolding of real life.  If you schedule so carefully that you can&#39;t change <br/>
your schedule when something really cool happens or you pass by a folk <br/>
festival or you get invited last-minute to see a magician, that schedule <br/>
could be detrimental.   <br/>

<br/>
This is what we did (looking back). For about the last 8months, we (I)<br/>
completely avoided anything remotely schoolish and spent alot of time doing<br/>
the &quot;junk&quot; (not my word) things. Watching TV, barbies, Tiger beat magazines,<br/>
Fluff stuff. Emily has started to become less intertested in them and more<br/>
into quality. Not quality things as in Educational, but as in value, desire<br/>
to share, things that make her feel like she has accomplshed things.<br/>
OK, Max is really bored and I neeed to go pay attention to him. He&#39;s<br/>
shrieking..<br/>
