<div id="ygrps-yiv-739632999">We have 5 children ranging from 23-13.   Our home has always been busy with activity as each one was creating; learning new things; pursuing their different interests.  <br/>
<br/>
Our youngest daughter is 13.  She has become more selective in her choices and activities and doesn&#39;t seem as interested or have a passion for anything in particular......She is always bubbly and joyful so she isn&#39;t depressed or anything.....but I know the lack of interest in learning bothers me.<br/>
 <br/>
I am sure that all my children went through different seasons like this throughout the years, but it didn&#39;t affect me as much as now, possibly because I was so busy with another one that needed my attention?  Where now it is just her and I, and our 16 year old son, but he is purposely pursuing his interests on a daily basis.   Has anyone had similiar experiences?<br/>

Does it bother her?<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re thinking of &quot;learning&quot; as being schoolish  <br/>
learning, and that you&#39;re not seeing what connections she might be  <br/>
making within herself by her own interests and thoughts.<br/>

<br/>
You seem very concerned with your own feelings about it and the affect  <br/>
on you.    Maybe you could pay more attention to her and what she&#39;s  <br/>
doing, thinking, watching, reading, listening to.<br/>

<br/>
Good!  He&#39;s busy.  You can spend more time with your daughter now!<br/>
Don&#39;t waste any of that time trying to make her more like her brother,  <br/>
or telling her you&#39;re bothered that she doesn&#39;t have interests or  <br/>
isn&#39;t learning, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-601504461">A child&#39;s perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I was a &#39;genius&#39; kid - whatever that means. The only connection I see was<br/>
that I was always at the top of my class, and never paid attention in class<br/>
or did homework. I used to read textbooks out of curiosity when they were<br/>
purchased (before the school year began) and the rest was stray bits of<br/>
explanations that fell on my ear in class when I wasn&#39;t daydreaming. That<br/>
label never was anything useful to me. I consistently endured school rather<br/>
absently, not really believing I had any choice, accommodating my real<br/>
interests around it. I &#39;played with the rules&#39; with seeming disregard,<br/>
including a joking bet with a teacher to earn 76 marks out of 100 in maths,<br/>
which I remembered and solved the paper for only 76 marks months later.<br/>
<br/>
In a way, I unschooled myself with school as one of the conditions I lived<br/>
with. I have consistently disappointed parents, teachers and everyone I<br/>
encountered by not being interested in learning - not just textbooks. I<br/>
pretty much didn&#39;t learn at all in any recognized way. I just did stuff and<br/>
experimented. I dropped out of hobby classes from everything ranging from<br/>
drawing to karate, I never used to do homework, never minded punishments or<br/>
praise, just flowed around it all. It didn&#39;t really matter to me one way or<br/>
the other, as long as I was able to do what I wanted to do, which didn&#39;t<br/>
appear to be learning to them.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned a lot from life I think, without ever setting out to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I did not become a brain surgeon. If it weren&#39;t boring (for me) I don&#39;t<br/>
think it would have been difficult at all (maybe that is why it was boring).<br/>
I did become whatever I wanted to be countless times, being successful in<br/>
many professions, having parallel careers, starting from scratch, mixing and<br/>
merging seemingly unrelated streams of knowledge to consistently come up<br/>
with out-of-the-box methods that got widely adopted after creating waves of<br/>
&#39;double-takes&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
My father still bemoans what I could have been &#39;if only I had been<br/>
interested in learning&#39; :D<br/>
<br/>
My parents want the best for me, so they worried. I see it as a sign of<br/>
their caring now, though I resented what I perceived as judgments then. I am<br/>
a parent now and I still don&#39;t have a degree, but I have top professionals<br/>
from many fields coming to me for guidance. I think I turned out okay, even<br/>
if I didn&#39;t &#39;learn&#39;.<br/>

I think it is REALLY common at about that age to have a kind of vegging-out<br/>
period. You may be product-oriented - you may have a family full of people<br/>
who are purpose-driven. But she might be happy just &quot;being.&quot; Maybe you could<br/>
take a more zen-like approach and learn from her how to be fully present in<br/>
the moment, not looking ahead and feeling like you have to accomplish<br/>
something to justify your existence.<br/>

<br/>
My friend Jeff had perfect visual memory and if he got a whiff of a  <br/>
smell, a perfume, a food, he could just go off on all the connections  <br/>
that made for him.  My memories were about emotions, and we would  <br/>
remember different aspects of the same incidents.<br/>
<br/>
My connections didn&#39;t help me a bit in school.  Jeff&#39;s made him seem  <br/>
like a genius.  But it was a parlor trick.  It wasn&#39;t about studying  <br/>
or understanding (though he did those too)--it was being able to see  <br/>
the chalkboard from last month in his mind, or the pages of the book.   <br/>
I&#39;d say that should be considered cheating!!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I were talking about Adam Daniel, who&#39;s nearly five years  <br/>
old and VERY verbal and analytical.  Just because he talks a ton now  <br/>
doesn&#39;t guarantee he&#39;ll be &quot;ahead of the curve&quot; forever.   It sure is  <br/>
fun to hang out with a four year old who can talk all about what he  <br/>
thinks and sees and learns!<br/>

can be big, especially with teen girls. Phones and IMs and Facebook  <br/>
are likely to be her &quot;thing&quot; for the next few years so it will be  <br/>
good for your relationship to embrace that. For some parents that  <br/>
type of learning may be harder to accept than TV and video games ;-)  <br/>
But for many teens it&#39;s hugely important.<br/>

purposely scoring low, so that my friends got a chance too :D I honestly<br/>
used to be happier about it, because I hated my family talking like I &#39;won&#39;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maria Montessori studied what kids liked to, and learned the most from, at certain ages.  In the teenage years, she found that the thing that was most important to them was connections with their peers.  Her idea for junior high/ high school was a place where kids that age could be extremely extremely SOCIAL with people of all ages and types.  One example was them (a whole group of teen peers, like a classroom) running a bed & breakfast so they&#39;d meet tons and tons of new people all the time.  They&#39;d also interact with their peers all the time, in a meaningful way in order to accomplish day to day tasks. <br/>
<br/>
Running an inn is the &quot;learning&quot; part of it, but the real part of what she found is that teens are SOCIAL and this is how they learn at that age, no matter what they are doing.  I&#39;m sure your daughter will get back to other things she enjoys.  Perhaps you could look for teen groups she could get together with, or ask her if she&#39;d like to try a job somewhere she could be social.  Or just let her be, doing what she&#39;s doing, and enjoy.  :)<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Aha. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s because she&#39;s becoming a woman!<br/>
<br/>
Meaning - it is in her nature to pursue learning all about relationships and<br/>
how they work and don&#39;t work and to experiment and to compare notes. It is<br/>
probably a biological imperative. So - what you could notice in this is a<br/>
passion for experiencing interactions with people. Help her get as much of<br/>
it as possible. Texting and facebooking are great ways to learn all about<br/>
people and how they react and respond and what they think and so on. She<br/>
might be interested in some other activities that support that same<br/>
interest. Polls are often big for girls at that age. My oldest daughter, at<br/>
13, had a couple of books that were filled with psychological questionnaires<br/>
and loved to go around having all her friends fill them out (pre-facebook). <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Think of this as supporting her ability to be a wonderful friend and wife<br/>
and mother and coworker - in the future. She&#39;s learning about the variety of<br/>
human experience - how people are the same and different. She&#39;ll almost<br/>
certainly be disappointed in some of her friends - they won&#39;t be as honest<br/>
as she thinks they should be or they&#39;ll be mean or petty or something. And<br/>
she&#39;ll learn to deal with that. And she&#39;ll learn to speak up for what she<br/>
believes in and when to just be quiet and not argue and on and on. Great<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you want to &quot;do things&quot; together - try to be creative and focus on things<br/>
that have relationships as their core. And, of course, include her friends<br/>
in things. If you want to go to an art museum, take a couple of her friends<br/>
along. If you think of something she might enjoy - baking, etc. - invite a<br/>
friend to do it with her. Support this interest - it is a great one!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also - watch tv and movies and talk about the relationships. Good time for<br/>
chick-flicks and romantic comedy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333137242">phone and FB...so it will be good for your relationship to embrace that. For some parents that <br/>
type of learning may be harder to accept than TV and video games ;-) <br/>
But for many teens it&#39;s hugely important.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it thanks Joyce<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290086382">*** I guess texting, and FB I have never seen as learning***<br/>
<br/>
Time to start seeing it differently then!  Everytime I log into FB, I learn something new and interesting.  Social networking IS learning.  Being social is learning, making social connections is important.  Yet, even if you ignore that obvious part of FB, people&#39;s status updates and &quot;fan&#39;s of&quot; links point us to new thoughts and ideas everytime we see them.  I can&#39;t even begin to tell you how much *I* have learned from these things!  I&#39;ll be cruising along reading status updates and somebodies link or update will peak my interest because it was something I didn&#39;t know before, and I&#39;ll check it out!<br/>
