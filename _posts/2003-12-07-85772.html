&gt; (I have the beginnings of a list, but nobody quite thinks I&#39;m  the one to <br/>
&gt; make that decision, and if anyone tries to make such a decision for others <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; seen as evil.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah, I&#39;d like to see that list.  &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&quot; (as in those who don&#39;t know our own limits when it comes to population) <br/>
would be all of us on this list because of the culture we were born into . . . <br/>
and most of the six billion people on the planet.  The exceptions to &quot;we&quot; are <br/>
those people that still live tribally, usually as hunter/gatherers.  (i.e., <br/>
the !Kung in Africa.)  Tribal peoples keep their own population down so that <br/>
they don&#39;t outgrow their food source.  <br/>
<br/>
People of our culture (&quot;Takers&quot; in Ishmael&#39;s lexicon) decided that we would <br/>
have no such limits, and have started making all the world about providing food <br/>
and other goodies for us.  We try to exterminate species that also eat our <br/>
food, such as wolves.  We approach our food and our population growth in a way <br/>
that is unbalanced -- we are wiping out biological diversity on the planet, and <br/>
the planet needs that diversity to survive.  Therefore, *we* need it to <br/>
survive.<br/>
<br/>
The solution is not about who gets to reproduce and who doesn&#39;t, because, as <br/>
you&#39;ve said (and I agree), it&#39;s icky when people decide that for others.  The <br/>
solution is about gradually reducing the food supply.  I know this seems <br/>
counter-intuitive when you hear about famines and starvation, but those trends <br/>
started in agrarian societies, not among hunter/gatherers (who just kept walking <br/>
until there *was* food again).  If there is less food (gradually), there will <br/>
be fewer of the species that consumes that food.  Ask any biologist.<br/>
<br/>
All this is in _Ishmael_.  I&#39;m still figuring out if I agree with it all, but <br/>
the ideas in this book are the newest, most exciting things I&#39;ve read.  <br/>
Period.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
There was no moment, and no councel meeting, and not even a good conspiracy, <br/>
in which any such thing was decided.<br/>
<br/>
Three major world religions have it right in the story of the creation of the <br/>
first man that the animals and plants are his to use, and he can name them <br/>
and do whatever he wants with them.  (Except have sex with them, some say was <br/>
clarified later.)<br/>
<br/>
One of those major world religions came to hold it as a lack of faith in God <br/>
to concern oneself with anything longterm, because they were going to be taken <br/>
away from this temporary earth and SOON.<br/>
<br/>
So insofar as culture is based on religion, we have a basis for that thinking.<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;we&quot; is the people on this list, one thing we all have in common is that <br/>
we&#39;ve all had children.  Most of us more than one, and lots of more than two.<br/>
<br/>
Another absolute commonality is we use computers.  Glass, expensive plastics, <br/>
expensive metals (small amounts, but still) chips prepared in ways that waste <br/>
water in Albuquerque (speaking only for Intel).  Then there&#39;s the electricity <br/>
and the radiation.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
But there&#39;s some amount of killing each other for the food that&#39;s left.<br/>

Unschooling is kind of exciting to me, and I can actually do it (unlike <br/>
changing the course of food production on the planet, or changing the basis for <br/>
Judeo-Christian and Islamic cultures).<br/>

the courage to investigate it again.  I wouldn&#39;t be here if I hadn&#39;t started <br/>
reading that series.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep, and I appreciate that you&#39;ve helped me to be able to do it, too. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought of and agreed with most of your points before, but I think they <br/>
can more or less be integrated into this way of thinking.  What I love about <br/>
this POV is that I don&#39;t have to feel guilty for owning a computer or having 2 <br/>
kids -- there&#39;s no one right way to live.  The problem is less in the <br/>
individual choices we&#39;re making and more in the fact that there are just too many of <br/>
us.  We&#39;ll either fix that or we won&#39;t -- but I like to think about how to go <br/>
about it.  It&#39;s my own personal unschooling -- I am compelled to think about <br/>
these ideas.<br/>
<br/>
  But I can certainly do it on my own time -- I just wanted to reply to your <br/>
point and flesh out my POV a bit.  And get the name _Ishmael_ out there for <br/>
any readers that might be interested. &lt;BEG&gt;  I&#39;m done.<br/>
<br/>
