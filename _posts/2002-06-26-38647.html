 </span></blockquote>Try clearing chaches and deleting cookies. (Both are part of Preferences<br/>
under Edit on the menu.) Just go through each page and click on anything<br/>
that says Clear History, Empty Now. Try Reset to Default too.<br/>
<br/>
On Macs putting the program&#39;s preferences file in the trash sometimes helps<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Have you upgraded AOL or your operating system? The version of IE may not be<br/>
entirely compatible.<br/>
<br/>
You might try the same with AOL.<br/>
