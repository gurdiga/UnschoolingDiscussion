children&#39;s say so (I consider their toys to be their property) and they <br/>
decide which toys can go and which stay and where they go.  To charity, trash <br/>
or just to the garage if they aren&#39;t ready to part with them yet.<br/>

your children that said this is what the room should look like or you?<br/>
