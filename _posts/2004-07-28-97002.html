&quot;getting into it&quot; but like I said it was forever ago. <br/>

an interesting take on the story!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-207669281">I have to second this.  Ahab&#39;s Wife is amazing!  I just read it for the <br/>
second time.  There are so many wonderful connections to history.  I read <br/>
Moby Dick in high school and don&#39;t remember much except the endless search <br/>
for the white whale.  I am dying to go to Nantucket now and see the places <br/>
mentioned.  We go to Cape Cod every summer and I&#39;ve been trying to fit in a <br/>
Nantucket trip each year but it hasn&#39;t worked for one reason or another.  I <br/>
hope it will happen next summer.  Another good read in this vein is In the <br/>
Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex by Nat Philbrick.  I <br/>
read this at the same time as my first read of Ahab&#39;s Wife.  It is the true <br/>
story of The Essex which was the story that inspired Moby Dick.  The books <br/>
really complimented each other.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Reading!<br/>
