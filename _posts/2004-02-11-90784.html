give you 1/3 of it, would they give you $33 or $34? <br/>
<br/>
Me: Um.... excuse me?<br/>
<br/>
Patrick: Would they round it up to 34 or down to 33?<br/>

Me: Um, why would they round it either way? That would depend on what your <br/>
contract said, I guess. Um... why would they give you only 1/3?<br/>

<br/>
that is SO cool! As for following it up, I&#39;d ask &quot;So, are you still <br/>
mulling those numbers around in your head?&quot; and get into a <br/>
conversation about it.<br/>

and round down otherwise. As if that is a rule.<br/>
<br/>
So 33.3333333 would always, in school, round down to 33.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s convenient for school - since there is a always a right answer <br/>
that way. Lots of school teachers think that it is &quot;right&quot; in some more <br/>
ultimate sense, but it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If you had a hundred kids and were dividing them into 3 groups and you <br/>
wanted to know how many kids should be put into each group, you might <br/>
divide by 3 and get 33.33333333 and decide to round down and put 33 <br/>
kids in each group. There would be one kid left out and maybe glad (if <br/>
this was school - maybe glad not to have to be in a group? &lt;G&gt;) or <br/>
maybe sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Even a teacher who had taught &quot;if the number ends in a digit less than <br/>
5, round down&quot; for years would NOT round down in this situation &lt;G&gt;. <br/>
And probably wouldn&#39;t even realize that what she/he was teaching <br/>
contradicted her/his own behavior.<br/>
<br/>
What I can think of to follow up on with Patrick on his question, <br/>
though, would be that they&#39;d probably pay him $33.33 -- they probably <br/>
would not round up since, first just teachers always say round down if <br/>
the last digit is less than 5 and since it would be in THEIR best <br/>
interest to round down, anyway! If they had a hundred employees, how <br/>
much would they save by rounding down for everybody? What if they had a <br/>
thousand employees? What if they did that every WEEK for a thousand <br/>
employees? Etc.<br/>

<br/>
The computers at the grocery store charge 34 cents for the first 3-for-$1 <br/>
item, and 33 cents for the other two.  Maybe if at a job they paid someone 33% <br/>
they could round up once for every two downs.<br/>
