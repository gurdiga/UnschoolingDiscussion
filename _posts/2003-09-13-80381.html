  **No crappy mother is raising that sweet, lovey little girl!  I think lots<br/>
  of 11 year olds have trouble expressing their feelings.  It sucks that you<br/>
  landed in Stickuptheirbutts USA.**<br/>
<br/>
  I have to agree with Rue,  Shyrley.<br/>
<br/>
  I saw you with your kids, both at the conference and at your home.  You are not a crappy mother.   <br/>
<br/>
  It does take time for all of us to learn how to live peacefully.  Especially when we weren&#39;t raised that way.   On bad days I tell myself, &quot;one day at a time&quot;.   Then we talk and talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
  You are doing a good job, but its hard to realize that in &quot;Stickuptheirbutts USA&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  **Ever since the conference we&#39;ve all been feeling more<br/>
  lonely, because we know you all are out there.**<br/>
<br/>
  Ah,  yes,  its the same here  :(<br/>
