My Jalen loves a neighbor girl named Shai (prounounced Shay) and when he <br/>
yells her name it sounds like shit. And he likes to repeat it over and over very <br/>
loudly....I get some strange looks.<br/>

with the movie, &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot;. Of course they would beg in unison <br/>
whenever we were in public, &quot;Hurry mommy, want to see Fuckin the Hound!&quot; Over and <br/>
over and over. <br/>
<br/>
They crack up whenever I tell this story. <br/>
