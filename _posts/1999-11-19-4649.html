set on a plastic dropcloth.  That way they could paint to their <br/>
hearts content and I could relax.  Of course,  sometimes they needed <br/>
a bath afterwords.  I know you&#39;ve heard this many times,  but your <br/>
kids are little for so long.  They NEED to make messes.  Sometimes we <br/>
also used to paint at the kitchen table or counter.  Of course they <br/>
got paint all over the table.  Fingerpainting on the table with <br/>
shaving cream cleans it right up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497853422"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; If my kids were in school they would get to paint.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve bought paint and<br/>

&gt; do with all of those &quot;masterpieces&quot;<br/>
&gt; Any ideas?  What do others do for art?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Paint:  watercolor (both the dried cakes and liquid), tempera, biocolor<br/>
(dries like plastic!), poster, fingerpaints.  Ideally, I take everything<br/>
off the table, and cover it with newspaper (taped on underneath so it<br/>
stays).  If I don&#39;t have time to do that (often I don&#39;t), we either use<br/>
paper on one section, or do without and wash up soon after.  But I don&#39;t<br/>
particularly care about stains on the table, so that&#39;s an option for us<br/>
that might not be an option for others.<br/>
<br/>
Other than paint:  we use markers, rubber stamps (lots!), different kinds<br/>
of crayons, colored pencils, other pens and pencils, ink pads and<br/>
fingerprints (get the washable kind!).<br/>
<br/>
Most of these aren&#39;t particularly messy.  We also use a variety of sizes of<br/>
things to paint on- postcards, small circles (to be made into ornaments).<br/>
Keeping things small reduces mess and clutter some.<br/>
<br/>
We also do stuff with paper and scissors (that&#39;s messier than paint, I<br/>
think), hole punches in various shapes, folding paper (origami and other<br/>
stuff), fimo clay, stuff from nature (pine cones, twigs, dried flowers,<br/>
whatever is around).<br/>
<br/>
One of my three is very much into art.  We bought her a large portfolio to<br/>
keep her work in after it dries, and a small rack thing to dry paintings in<br/>
(it is really a thing designed to organize paperwork- several page sized<br/>
shelves in a wooden thing like a cube, found it at a yard sale)  She<br/>
decides what to keep.  She also has several cheap frames, and she puts some<br/>
work in the frames and changes that from time to time.  I also have a<br/>
laminator, and occasionally, will laminate a very special piece.  We have<br/>
also made color copies of special pieces, and laminated those to send to<br/>
relatives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve gotten some wonderful ideas re art--I&#39;m filing them away!-- but I<br/>
just thought I&#39;d say what we do with Annie&#39;s masterpieces.  We let her say<br/>
where she&#39;d like them put up.  We have a lot of them up on the glass of the<br/>
windows of our sunroom --no blinds or curtains so it kind of looks like<br/>
stained glass windows--and a rotating display on the refrigerator and the<br/>
walls of the kitchen.  Sometimes she doesn&#39;t want to keep them, and that&#39;s<br/>
fine too.<br/>
<br/>
But we make that her choice.  If she wants to decorate our entire house<br/>
that&#39;s fine too! (with pieces on paper or sculptures, etc.  although I&#39;m<br/>
seriously toying with painting walls with her--we&#39;re gonna have to paint<br/>
them back to white when we leave anyway, so why not have some fun?)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really artistic, but I&#39;m looking forward to the progress of this<br/>
particular part of Annie&#39;s childhood so much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260103244">Went to the Salvation Army and found some old artists folding older<br/>
thingies and gave one to each kidlet in which they choose the pieces of<br/>
&quot;art&quot; they wish to keep.  They fit nicely in the back of a closet and they<br/>
have a wire on one wall with clothes pins and they hang their current fav<br/>
on that.  I date the backs so that in later years they can see what they<br/>
did when.  Sometimes they go through and toss some oldies out but we have<br/>
agreed that they can&#39;t toss all the oldies out cause I do the &quot;mom&quot; thing<br/>
and like to get &quot;mushy&quot; on them every now and again.<br/>

<br/>
I am an art person. I love to do all the messy stuff but I do understand. <br/>
Paper Mache is another one that takes longer to set up and clean up than to <br/>
do.  I keep all our art stuff together. I have taken photos of the kids in <br/>
action and of the finished work with them holding it. Then we can put it in a <br/>
scrapbook. (another art class LOL) This works great for pieces too big and <br/>
bulky to save. Then you have to set it aside until they can part with it. <br/>
    I also bought a nice size portfolio folder at Jo-Ann etc. (fabric and <br/>
craft store) to keep their flat art work in. My kids take an art class every <br/>
other week so I like to keep as much of what they do as I can.<br/>
    Put on old oversize shirts backwards to paint in. If you get them in the <br/>
habit of doing things in an organized manner that will help some. We only do <br/>
one creative thing at a time. Spread out lots of newspaper. I use foam plates <br/>
or washed meat trays to put paint on. then toss it out. I give them each <br/>
their own jar of water and paper towels to blot the brush on. For the longest <br/>
time my youngest painted everything black.Ugh! My kids love colored pencils <br/>
also. You can also buy water color pencils. They color with the pencil then <br/>
use a wet brush and it turns to paint.<br/>

Take a large shirt, cut it down the back, so that it is open, for the little <br/>
one to put it on like the surgeons. <br/>
Take a thin strap of material (I cut up the back again, to make the strip, <br/>
and then cut the strip in half) sew to each side. <br/>
Allow child to color on the front of his/her smock for personalization...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-538298651">Love the art topic--and all the great ideas<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 8 now,,,,,when we used to do a mommy & me &#39;preschool&#39; class <br/>
sometimes us moms would start doing our own things,,,fingerpainting, <br/>
clay-molding, etc,,,and were still going even when the kids got tired of <br/>
it-----it&#39;s one of the great things about being a parent-you get to be a kid <br/>
again.  A lot of the time when my daughter wants to get somethng out,,i&#39;ll <br/>
get on a little creative binge myself----and when i started painting oils <br/>
again,,,,i let her start on her own canvas.  I love the freedom of just <br/>
doing, without any outcome,,,and try to instill that more than anything,,just <br/>
to have fun,,,let it go where it wants to go,,,not as trying to do it <br/>
perfectly.  <br/>
We also hang some of the finished products around the house.  I remember when <br/>
i was young a few things would make it to the refrigerator, but that was it.  <br/>
I see how much it means to her, to have things she has created hung <br/>
respectfully on the walls along with &#39;real&#39; art.  Hers are just as real.<br/>

Love this network,,,,,take care,,,jennifer</div>
