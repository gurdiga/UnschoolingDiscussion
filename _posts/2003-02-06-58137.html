unschooling.. There was absolutely no research cited to support her <br/>
conclusion.   Landon has had to write 2 research papers for school.   One was <br/>
the history of Vampirism.. and the last one was about King Arthur,.. .. Myth <br/>
VS Facts... both were immensely more interesting that this students work.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s listed as a model paper. If this is representative of their &quot;method&quot;, I <br/>
believe I would avoid them!<br/>

<br/>
I thought it looked like she had read the Teenage Liberation Handbook, was <br/>
refuting points (it&#39;s not &quot;research,&quot; that book...), defending school, and <br/>
justifying tradition.<br/>
<br/>
Tradition is never based on research.  It&#39;s tradition.<br/>
School is traditional.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t based on research.  It&#39;s experimental and reactionary.  The <br/>
times it works are &quot;anecdotal evidence.&quot;  But school&#39;s evidence is <br/>
statistical evidence.  Not TOO many kids kill themselves to get out of tests. <br/>
 LOTS eventually reproduce and pass on the tradition.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704538628">I couldn&#39;t get through the whole thing. Don&#39;t they provide teachers <br/>
to correct things? My word...Abbie loves to write, but I would NEVER <br/>
let her submit a piece like that for anything. It reads like a rough <br/>
draft or some airhead&#39;s diary entry. ugh.<br/>
