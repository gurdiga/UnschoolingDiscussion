<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103655270">goodness, this has been a LONG 72 hrs but I&#39;m GLAD TO SAY, I&#39;m finally RID<br/>
of the kakworm.virus ... our phone bill is going to be OUT OF THIS WORLD<br/>
next month b/c I was on the phone off/on for *4* hrs w/ my ds (away @<br/>
college) b/c he helped me to get rid of this thing ... *ACK*!!!  I also<br/>
realized how ADDICTED I&#39;ve b/c to the internet ... I guess I&#39;ll be signing<br/>
myself up for a 12~step computer~addiction~anoyn~group asap!!!  seriously, I<br/>
was quite a pathetic basketcase OFFLINE :I<br/>
<br/>
Tracy, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t return your e-m but since I knew I had this virus,<br/>
I didn&#39;t want to spread it around by resending it ... besides, I don&#39;t have<br/>
the foggiest notion about *WHAT* my ds did nor would I EVER be able to<br/>
explain the steps, either ... good luck if you&#39;ve contracted this ... AND,<br/>
my ds tells me another virus is due out June 1st but hopefully, I&#39;ll be ok<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
thanks Shannon Brophy for trying to help me but, like I said, I had no idea<br/>
what you were trying to say and since I knew I was infected, I didn&#39;t want<br/>
to spread it to you, too  ... but, thanks so much ...<br/>
<br/>
ohhhhhhhhhhh, the joys of technology :}<br/>
Pris ~&gt; *BONK* ~&gt; that ladies, is the sound of my head hitting my keyboard<br/>
from UTTER EXHAUSTION :I</div>

<div><font size="2">yes, as a matter of fact, we realized my&nbsp;signature was 
functioning so this prob had something to do w/ it???&nbsp;&nbsp; ACK, 
I&nbsp;didn&#39;t even KNOW what a signature was!!!&nbsp; well, now I 
do!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I was really very lucky b/c both the&nbsp;Housecall and McAfee 
scanners said the kak-v&nbsp; was in 4 major files but luckily/thankfully, I 
didn&#39;t lose anything ... btw, I did realize my scanner was outdated; it&#39;s funny 
how something only 1.5 yrs old can be obsolete!!!</font></div>

<div><font size="2">just glad I&#39;m up and running again ... Amy, the 12-Step 
meeting will be held weekly @ my house, just until we get our&nbsp;addictions 
under control!!!&nbsp; LOL!!!</font></div>

  <div><font size="2">Well, good for you for getting debugged!&nbsp; As I could 
  figure out, (which I could have mentioned)&nbsp; if one doesn&#39;t use the 
  signature function (which despite becoming more tech-y by the hour &lt;g&gt;) 
  one isn&#39;t spreading it, at least, when I had the full-fledged version I didn&#39;t 
  get told I was spreading it.&nbsp; I almost think I should get re-infected so 
  I could debug myself properly.&nbsp; BTW, what did it do to your &#39;puter, apart 
  from infecting others?</font></div>
