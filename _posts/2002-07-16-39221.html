<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375337200">Have any of you ever noticed that in our culture, we read novels about <br/>
interesting, exciting characters that are usually what one would call type <br/>
A or ADHD, such as Anne of Green Gables, Tom Sawyer, the Lila Fenwick <br/>
series, yet our society squelches and damages our real Anne Shirleys, Tom <br/>
Sawyers and Lila Fenwicks and Ramonas?<br/>
<br/>
Why is it that these &quot;interesting&quot; kids are only allowed to exist on the <br/>
pages of a story book?  Why is society bent on dumbing down the rest of <br/>
them?<br/>

Have any of you ever noticed that in our culture, we read novels about<br/>
interesting, exciting characters that are usually what one would call<br/>
type A or ADHD, such as Anne of Green Gables, Tom Sawyer, the Lila<br/>
Fenwick <br/>

Tom Sawyers and Lila Fenwicks and Ramonas?**<br/>
<br/>
I was just reading &quot;Talking Back to Ritalin&quot; yesterday and really<br/>
enjoying it.  There was a specific mention that Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn<br/>
would undoubtedly be on Ritalin if they were in public schools today.<br/>
<br/>
I thought the book was fascinating, in discussing how drug companies<br/>
promoted Ritalin, in light of the very similar story about how female<br/>
hormones were promoted.  Lots of publicity for &quot;benefits&quot; even if the<br/>
scientific proof of the evidence was not strong.  Very little coverage<br/>
of side effects.<br/>
<br/>
The author of Talking Back to Ritalin suggests that kids who can&#39;t<br/>
attend to boring lessons need better schooling, and he recommends<br/>
homeschooling as an option.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-662716204">As an adult with ADD, I must respond to this. I&#39;ve never read anything with Lila Fenwick, but Anne, Tom, and Ramona do not present characteristics symptomatic of ADD.<br/>
I refuse to allow the uneducated beliefs of schoolteachers to define any neurological condition. Just because they label any nonconforming child &quot;ADD&quot; does not make it so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-445752421">as yet another adult with ADD.. it IS normal.. one of many configurations of normal.. i think brains all work differently.. but the so-called ADD brain creates behavior that doesn&#39;t fit the environment created by brains that are accepted as &quot;normal&quot; by many--alas the ones in charge of so much of our society<br/>
<br/>
as i read somewhere and my son (15 and ADD) and i like to say.. those who are not ADD are simply the &quot;Multiple Thought Impaired&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-298983831">Please note that I didn&#39;t use the word &quot;abnormal&quot;. That&#39;s your word choice.<br/>
I have read Hartman&#39;s writings. His portrait of ADD as &quot;Hunter&quot; is a first step toward acknowledgement of positive aspects of atypical neurological conditions. Unfortunately, most of us out here in the real world don&#39;t fit into Hartman&#39;s paradigm any more than we fit into those offered by a regimented conformist society.<br/>
I see those fictional characters as having many qualities, including being highly imaginative, daring, curious, outspoken, unrestrained, exuberant.<br/>
But I don&#39;t see ADD in them. ADD is not a personality type.<br/>
