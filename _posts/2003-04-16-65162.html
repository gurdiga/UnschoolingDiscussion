<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347355230">I can&#39;t get a DANG person on the phone to share this with, so please <br/>
excuse me whilst I gush... :)<br/>
<br/>
My littlest princess Chloe, who, mind you is only 6 months old, was <br/>
playing in the crib today.  (I keep a crib in the living room so she <br/>
has a safe place to play without being trompled by her siblings.  <br/>
BIG problem around here &gt;g&lt;)  I was on the computer and all of the <br/>
sudden all my munchkins started howling for me to hurry and get in <br/>
here!!!<br/>
<br/>
Chloe had pulled herself up onto her knees!  They were all so <br/>
excited they were screaming and there is little Chloe, just beaming <br/>
with the biggest wide-open-mouth grin EVER!  So, while we are all <br/>
gushing over her, telling her what a big girl she is, she just <br/>
decided to pull herself up to a standing position!  She&#39;s only 6 <br/>
months old!  Mind you, my other kids were, shall we say, not so <br/>
motorly inclined.  (If that&#39;s a word.)  Most of them were 9 months <br/>
before truly sitting up on their own, much less crawling or pulling <br/>
up.  Chloe started rocking on her hands and knees at 3 months and <br/>
crawling a couple of weeks ago.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, today, I guess she found her &#39;guts&#39; or something, ;), she <br/>
decided since she was such a big girl, she may as well get herself <br/>
up into a sitting position from laying down.  Crazy nut!  This is <br/>
my &#39;baby&#39; who has never been one.  When she was 18 hours old, my <br/>
best friend came over to see her and Chloe just smiled and coo-ed <br/>
and agooo-ed at her for ever.  She&#39;s been talking ever since.<br/>
<br/>
The really funny thing is she is so tiny.  Just 14 pounds, loooong <br/>
and skiinny.  It looks super funny!  And damnit, my husband is out <br/>
of town with BOTH the digital camera AND the video camera.  I&#39;m <br/>
going to go buy another of each, I think.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m off to drag out the calendar and write down another <br/>
first...a whole batch of them!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Just glowing with pride and had to share.  Enjoy your babes!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just thought I&#39;d add how very happy I am that ALL my children are <br/>
home with me.  The girls were just beside themselves this afternoon, <br/>
watching their baby sister.  These are moments I treasure that would <br/>
be missed had they been away at school today.  Chloe fell down just <br/>
after a few minutes and had the girls not been screaming for me to <br/>
rush in, even *I* may have missed this wonderful moment.<br/>
<br/>
Still smiling,<br/>
