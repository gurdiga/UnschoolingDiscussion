concrete examples, real life situations, and in depth descriptions of things <br/>
going on in childrens lives.    Folks usally use &quot;labels&quot; or familar terms <br/>
just to summarize some general  behaviors thier child has.    When folks have <br/>
had a specific concern or question about how to deal with situations or <br/>
behaviours, they have been very specific and concrete in giving details about <br/>
the issue.   I know I get some flack for being too long winded and giving too <br/>
much detail.    But, I&#39;m not the only one here that gets carried away when <br/>
telling about life&#39;s events.   As a matter of fact, I see many many more <br/>
postsexplaining and describing the situations in detail than being vague and <br/>
just throwing out &quot;labels&quot;<br/>

This is an example:<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;I sometimes find it confusing figuring out<br/>
how unschooling &quot;works&quot; or fits into our lives with kids who have <br/>
special<br/>
needs. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is the kind of thing people are reacting to, where all kids with <br/>
special needs are lumped together.<br/>

<br/>
 Folks who regularly read this list know about my children and the challanges <br/>
we face.  I dont think I need to describe them in detail when I&#39;m not talking <br/>
about them.. For instance, if someone  made a comment about racism,,maybe <br/>
they said, &quot; Being an african american,  I find it difficult to find groups <br/>
who will embrace our culture differences&quot;   Do they need to list and describe <br/>
thier cultural differences in order for folks to understand what they are <br/>
having difficulty with???     You took my statement out of context to make a <br/>
point about vagueness.  Do you REALLY think I am vague?<br/>

<br/>
No we don&#39;t. You assume WAY too much for a list with 1,000 members. I can <br/>
only barely keep track of stuff from folks I&#39;ve either met in real life, or <br/>
have read posts from for over a year.<br/>
Believe me, most of us are talking to folks in more than one place on the <br/>
internet, taking phone calls from new homeschoolers etc...<br/>
I can NOT keep track of who has what kids, what problems they face etc...<br/>
And from everything I remember of what you&#39;ve written, unschooling is not <br/>
what you&#39;ve been doing, or at least that&#39;s what you said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do you REALLY think I am vague?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, you sound confused. Confused and like you want to retract everything <br/>
after you&#39;ve said it, which is NOT very clear for those of us trying to offer <br/>
advice.<br/>

I took that bit out to point something specific out to you, to help you <br/>
possibly understand better the point about the &quot;special needs&quot; label <br/>
and why it isn&#39;t useful here.<br/>

You are word-wrestling - I&#39;m not getting the slightest bit of sense <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Teresa, Pam is trying to help you. And again you&#39;re defending as though she<br/>
were attacking you. Rather than defending your statement, why not ask why<br/>
*she* felt it might cause problems for people reading. (Well, you could do<br/>
that if she hadn&#39;t already explained it.) She saw something in your sentence<br/>
that you didn&#39;t. And that information could be valuable in figuring out how<br/>
to help yourself better.<br/>
<br/>
Think about the concept of defense. When we defend something, we put up a<br/>
barrier around it to protect it from harm.<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;re putting up barriers and protecting things that people feel might<br/>
be hindering you. The things people are trying to point out to you are<br/>
things that it would help you to examine in order for you to figure out how<br/>
to help you and your family.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe try seeing yourself as separate from the choices you made. Think of<br/>
your choices as a hammer that you picked up. People with nicely screwed in<br/>
screws are trying to suggest that a screwdriver might be more useful for<br/>
screwing in a screw. They aren&#39;t saying you&#39;re a bad person for picking up a<br/>
hammer. But if you defend your choice of the hammer, you&#39;re not helping<br/>
yourself and you&#39;re turning away the people who could offer some useful<br/>
insights.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe people are guessing wrong. That&#39;s going to happen because it&#39;s<br/>
impossible to communicate perfectly in any media. But they&#39;re guessing wrong<br/>
for legitimate reasons. And if you want people to give you advice that makes<br/>
more sense for your family, you&#39;ll have to figure out what it is you&#39;re<br/>
saying that&#39;s giving people a wrong impression. *Not* because *they* need<br/>
you to. But because *you* need you to.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe people are guessing right and your defenses won&#39;t let you see<br/>
that. I&#39;ve met Pam&#39;s and Sandra&#39;s and Mary&#39;s and Anne&#39;s kids. They all seem<br/>
like perfectly ordinary kids even though they&#39;ve all described the special<br/>
issues they&#39;ve dealt with and are dealing with. Their kids are where it<br/>
seems like you&#39;d like your kids to be. They have something you don&#39;t. It&#39;s<br/>
hard to know what it is. And it will be impossible for you to figure it out<br/>
if you put up barriers to protect yourself when part of what you have isn&#39;t<br/>
working for you.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than seeing this list as a force trying to get you to change, see it<br/>
as a resource to mine for help. Rather than resisting what isn&#39;t being<br/>
forced, ask questions. Ask why do you think that? What has worked for you?<br/>
How could I do that?<br/>
