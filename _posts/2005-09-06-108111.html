My son is not &quot;school age&quot; yet. Yesterday I was visiting a friend<br/>
whose son just started kindergarten last week. We walked to the bus<br/>
stop together to meet him coming home. She said, by way of calculating<br/>
when he would show up, &quot;They release him at 2:32, and the bus takes 20<br/>
minutes to get here...&quot; and then went on to complete the thought.<br/>
<br/>
That phrase reverberated in my ear: &quot;release him.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It sounds just awful!<br/>
<br/>
When we first met about two months ago, I tried to turn her on to the<br/>
idea of unschooling instead of sending her kid off to school, but I<br/>
didn&#39;t get anywhere. She was too enthusiastic about &quot;first day of<br/>
school&quot; as a big exciting thing. Shopping for supplies, all that.<br/>
<br/>
Later that afternoon, when her son was showing her the crafts project<br/>
he had made that day, she turned to me and said, warmly, &quot;Oh, just<br/>
wait until that first day you see your son coming off that big yellow<br/>
school bus. It just touches my heart.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I smiled and nodded politely. I was thinking: <br/>
<br/>
A: &quot;Hello! Remember, we are planning to homeschool/unschool!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
B: &quot;Yeah ... coming off that bus after he&#39;s BEEN RELEASED. From a<br/>
place where he can&#39;t just decide to go home if he feels like it, or do<br/>
a different activity from whatever some adult being given by some<br/>
bureaucracy decrees, where the crafts are carefully guided, where I<br/>
couldn&#39;t just decide, hey, let&#39;s go to the zoo instead and take him<br/>
with me ... I DON&#39;T THINK SO!&quot;</div>

Where?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
South Carolina---specifically, Columbia. But I think most of the state <br/>
was in school the first or second week of August. The kids get out the <br/>
last week of May though. Many of the yankee states are in until the end <br/>
of June or beginning of July. (Can you imagine those poor kids who are <br/>
relocated at the end of the school year in the north to begin again in <br/>
the South???)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure it originally had something to do with heat and <br/>
snow---weather-related reasons that we do this. But for the life of me, <br/>
I can&#39;t understand why you would want to run the zillions of AC units <br/>
in SC in August!<br/>
<br/>
My teacher friend (yes, I have one! &lt;g&gt;), says that it&#39;s so they have <br/>
more time to teach to the standardized tests that are taken in April. <br/>
Now, why they can administer those tests in June, I have NO idea!!!<br/>

My husband wishes they were given in September and scored promptly, so <br/>
that he could actually use the information that the tests are supposed <br/>
to provide about student performance and weak areas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278051827">I thought the first day of not going to school would be a big deal <br/>
for me, but it wasn&#39;t and I&#39;m glad. <br/>
<br/>
First off, most of the kids here (Maryland) were in all day pre-k <br/>
(public) or 3-5 day private pre-k. So last year Mikey was the only 4 <br/>
yr old not in school most of the week.<br/>
<br/>
Then this year he missed the cut-off date for kindergarten by one <br/>
day. (Yipee, no paperwork for me!) So he wouldn&#39;t be going this <br/>
year. Except that that is completely crazy and you can have kids <br/>
born Oct-Dec tested to be admitted which I&#39;m sure I would have done <br/>
if I&#39;d sent him to school.<br/>
<br/>
The school buses started driving by before school started--dry runs, <br/>
I guess--and I actually didn&#39;t notice the day they started having <br/>
kids on them! Plus our friends are moving in a couple weeks and <br/>
didn&#39;t bother to send their kids to school here...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s been nice to have life and learning just continue on <br/>
with us only vaguely aware of some other way of doing things!</div>
