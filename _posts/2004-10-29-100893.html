<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237030853">I wrote this on the New Mexico Homeschooling list.  I had asked there if <br/>
people knew where I might find orange knee socks.  There were a few leads, Holly <br/>
and I spent some time at Coronado Mall, and I reported back to the list.  <br/>
Thought I&#39;d share it here too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I might be too late, but I would try the soccer stores.  I seem to remember <br/>
being on a team as a child that required orange socks. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
They had orange and white, I learned by phone, but not solid orange.<br/>
<br/>
Macy&#39;s had some nice long white cotton socks, and we got two pairs and some <br/>
dye from Langell&#39;s (Rit didn&#39;t have orange or I probably would&#39;ve have used the <br/>
cheap grocery store dye).  Then we had to buy soda ash to follow the <br/>
instructions.  Then I realized the instructions are overkill, to make the dye bright <br/>
and life-long-lasting, and we only needed them for Halloween. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But at the same time we got a pair for Holly&#39;s fairy costume and dyed them <br/>
opposite stripes (small purple and large pink stripes on one, and the other way <br/>
on the other). <br/>
<br/>
Expensive project, for two pairs of socks, and my fingers are still purplish, <br/>
but while I did that Holly carved a couple of jack-o-lanterns from pumpkins <br/>
we grew, and we listened to Fred Astaire (one of Holly&#39;s favorites and <br/>
interests, and fairly foreign to me because I generally avoided that kind of music <br/>
most of my life).   I really like it when one of my kids knows more about <br/>
something and shares that interest with me.<br/>
<br/>
So if we&#39;d found orange socks it would&#39;ve been easier, but I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
been in the kitchen for an hour and fifteen minutes discussing small jazz band <br/>
vs. &quot;big band&quot; music, and Irving Berlin, and black and white movies vs. color <br/>
movies.  Holly knows Madelyn Kahn from both Paper Moon and Young Frankenstein, <br/>
both of which are in black and white although they were filmed in the 1970&#39;s.  <br/>
Each of those movies has an Irving Berlin song, and both those songs were on <br/>
the Fred Astaire CD we were listening to.  But Fred Astaire doesn&#39;t sing them <br/>
in the movies.  One is done by Gene Wilder and Peter Boyle as Frankenstein and <br/>
the monster (&quot;Puttin&#39; on the Ritz&quot;) and the other done by Tatum O&#39;Neal as <br/>
Addie (&quot;Let&#39;s Have Another Cup of Coffee,&quot; which she sings parts of to herself <br/>
while putting on her new hat and looking forward to getting a piano, I think it <br/>
is, and after hearing that part Holly wanted to learn the whole song which led <br/>
me to buying the same CD).<br/>
<br/>
Everything&#39;s connected!<br/>

------------<br/>
Another thing from that conversation was Holly asking me &quot;Was Fred Astaire an <br/>
actor?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Good question.  She meant what was he primarily considered.  I said, since we <br/>
were listening to a CD of music, he was &quot;a crooner,&quot; the word for singers of <br/>
that style.  But that above singing and acting, he was considered &quot;a hoofer,&quot; <br/>
a stage dancer.  He was an actor too, but he sure wasn&#39;t acting like he was <br/>
singing or dancing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays sometimes that&#39;s faked, but in the 1930&#39;s there was no way and no <br/>
reason, really.   Fred Astaire wasn&#39;t really &quot;good looking&quot; by modern standards <br/>
(or even by the standards of his day), but he was so talented and charismatic <br/>
that the idea of a funny-looking guy who could fit in any company and be <br/>
gentlemanly was a big, attractive deal to men and women both.<br/>

<br/>
My kids like Dean Martin, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and others of <br/>
that era.  I found it almost too weird to comprehend but then I <br/>
listened while they played it and it is pretty good music.  I <br/>
realized I was just prejudice because it was my parent&#39;s music and it <br/>
would have been so uncool to listen to.  My kids don&#39;t have those <br/>
prejudices and have no need to be cool so they find what they like.<br/>
<br/>
Courtney, my 16 yo, is doing a Kander and Ebb revue at her college.  <br/>
One of their songs is New York, New York.  She was the only student  <br/>
who already knew it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same here. And that music brings back such a flood of memories, <br/>
especially of my dad, who always had Perry Como or Sinatra or somebody <br/>
similar going on the hi-fi - to have my children supplying those <br/>
memories to me is so weird - and somehow so right.<br/>
