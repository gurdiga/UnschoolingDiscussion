<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987258944">This will be the third night I will get little or no sleep because a child <br/>
started vomiting in the evening and continued through the night on a <br/>
regular schedule. Luckily they have chosen alternate nights so I got to <br/>
sleep Saturday and Monday nights after being up Friday and Sunday nights <br/>
and being sick myself all day yesterday. Blech. The bright side is I caught <br/>
up on my e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
So now a little rant.  Is it just me or are there a lot of plain-awful <br/>
kids&#39; books out there?  I love our library system but it seems a lot of the <br/>
books in there are stinkers.  Mostly it is the condescension I don&#39;t like <br/>
and my kids see right though it as well. Some are trying too hard to teach <br/>
a lesson, such as word recognition or a certain value, some are just plain <br/>
bad.  How do these get published? Luckily there are a fair number of good <br/>
books. One of my favourites is Something From Nothing by Phoebe <br/>
Gilman.  The illustrations are beautiful. Rosemary Wells and her Max and <br/>
Ruby books are favourites, too. And Sheree Fitch&#39;s wonderfully rhythmic <br/>
poems and stories. In the non-fiction I don&#39;t like the Usborne books that <br/>
so many homeschoolers like.  I find them too busy. I like Dorling <br/>
Kindersley books, and the Eyewitness series. My ten-y.o. likes the cutaway <br/>
books (they show objects, e.g. spacecraft, s if part of it was cut away so <br/>
you can see the workings), and any National Geographic book.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone recommend some good picture books for older children, around age <br/>
seven?  Eric likes to have chapter books read to him but also still likes <br/>
picture books with a good but not too long story.<br/>
<br/>
Rant over, not much of a rant, and I only had to get up once to hold a <br/>
bucket.  Poor baby, I hate when they are sick.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-743594615">Hi Andrea,<br/>
<br/>
One of our favorite authors is Cynthia Rylant.  She has several series:  Poppleton;  Henry and Mudge; and Mr. Putter and Tabby.  These might be too young for him, but maybe not, if he likes the Max and Ruby books.  She also wrote the best book if your dog dies:  Dog Heaven.<br/>
<br/>
You could check out Chinaberry for ideas.  www.chinaberry.com  They are a wonderful resource for us.  <br/>
<br/>
Wishing you healthy times ahead!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think some of it is blatant because that&#39;s what many parents want. They<br/>
want to feel like their children are learning something and not wasting<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
But it might also be your kids and the way they learn. I don&#39;t remember<br/>
coming across that many kids books that bothered me so it could be Kathryn<br/>
liked the books you see as condescending. Some of them are exploring<br/>
patterns in English and to kids who are figuring out the patterns, it&#39;s like<br/>
delightedly finding someone else who has noticed the same patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe it&#39;s your librarians! Maybe they&#39;re only buying books that are<br/>
overtly teaching.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-513389316">I love Cynthis Rylant, but for some reason none of my kids do. Another <br/>
author I thought of is Jean Van Leeuwen who wrote the Oliver Pig books. I <br/>
especially like the story where the mom gets her two piglets dressed to go <br/>
out in the winter and while she is getting ready they undress themselves, <br/>
so she sits down and cries. &quot;Mamas aren&#39;t supposed to cry,&quot; they tell her. <br/>
I can really identify with that one.<br/>
<br/>
I had a twenty minute nap at 5 a.m.  Eric was sick all night but has <br/>
stopped vomiting and is feeling and looking better. I expect him to sleep <br/>
most of the day. The one good thing was that I got to watch Gosford Park, <br/>
which I had borrowed from the library, though it took about 4.5 hours with <br/>
all the pauses - ick. Thank goodness I don&#39;t have to go to work or anywhere <br/>
else.<br/>
