<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340061863">Hey everyone,<br/>
 <br/>
I have somewhat of a quandary,,<br/>
 <br/>
We have a friend(Amy) whose roommate is a newspaper reporter.  This reporter does features on education and this time around she&#39;s going to do a feature on homeschooling.  Amy had been over to our house a couple of days ago and we were discussing our unschooling.   She&#39;s pretty cool about it,, she thinks it makes a lot of sense.<br/>
 <br/>
So naturally when her roomate tells her she&#39;s going to do a feature on homeschooling she asks her if she wants to go into the different types of homeschooling.  <br/>
 <br/>
Amy called me yesterday asking me if I&#39;d like to be part of it all.  Maybe get interviewed, don&#39;t know what else.  I said yes, but yet I&#39;m apprehensive.  Our school district has been pretty out of the picture in our whole homeschooling time.  We&#39;ve been doing it for about 3 years now.  I just don&#39;t know if I want to draw attention to ourselves,  yet if I can get the word out about unschooling,, I&#39;m excited to do that.<br/>
 <br/>
I know there&#39;s a few of you out there who have done some interviews and they have seemed to go pretty well.  It probably is going to depend on how it ends up being interpreted, how well I come across and how our school district responds.  I live in a pretty small city, 12,000 people.  So it wouldn&#39;t be hard to find me.  :(<br/>
 <br/>
I was tempted to just say no and stay silent,,yet I also want to let other people know that there are other options.<br/>
 <br/>
What do you think?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve done many interviews - local, national, international - my <br/>
congressperson even talked about my family in a speech which is in the <br/>
Congressional Record. No problems. Occasional misquotings. Once, we <br/>
were interviewed for tv (Rosie and I and our friends Dan Vilter and his <br/>
son Matthew). Imagine our surprise when the voice-over at the beginning <br/>
of the segment announced, &quot;Rosie and Matthew score high on standardized <br/>
tests.&quot; Nobody&#39;d asked us about testing - and we&#39;d been extremely open <br/>
about our unschooling, and the reporter had seemed to get it and like <br/>
what he heard. The rest was us and was fine. It can be annoying to talk <br/>
to a reporter for hours and end up with a paragraph that doesn&#39;t seem <br/>
representative of what you said, but that is not too uncommon.<br/>

If you go to the NHEN website and to the &#39;for the media&#39; area, you <br/>
might find some useful ideas of things that might help the reporter.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah,, I guess that is one thing I worry about. Not much I can do about it though.  Like you said, it happens a lot.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am leaning toward doing the interview.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll check into that.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One reason I&#39;m really wanting to do this is that there really isn&#39;t a whole lot of knowledge about unschooling here.  I guess that&#39;s pretty normal everywhere.  Most of the time when homeschooling is mentioned in our paper its because the parents want to shelter their children from the big bad world.  I want to point out that one of the reasons we pulled our kids from school is that there are so many more opportunities out in the world.  This type of thing is never mentioned.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>****** When Laurie and I did an interview for our local paper (it&#39;s <br/>
on my website <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ubpub.com">http://www.ubpub.com</a> under Media) we were pleasantly <br/>
surprised at how positive the whole thing turned out. An elderly man <br/>
did the interview and while he got a few facts mixed up, he <br/>
basically gave us two thumbs up. <br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t have any fear from the interview though because Laurie was <br/>
already in college by that time. In our southern community we didn&#39;t <br/>
utter the word &quot;unschool&quot; until she was 16 or so - past the age of <br/>
school board bs. <br/>
<br/>
However, that was so many years ago and while Unschooling is still <br/>
unknown and misunderstood by the majority, it is far more acceptable <br/>
now than then.<br/>
<br/>
So basically, Kelli. I have no advice. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sure,, Valerie,, thanks a lot!  &lt;G&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
No,  I knew when I posted the question that I would have to think through my own circumstances.  Just hearing that others have done it, helps.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll go and read through some of the interviews and then decide if I&#39;m feeling secure enough in my own definitions and answers.  I don&#39;t doubt unschooling a bit.  Its my ability to communicate details of why I don&#39;t doubt it is my worry. People ask, &quot;don&#39;t you worry that they&#39;ll fall behind?&quot;  or &quot;don&#39;t you worry that this will screw them up?&quot;  Nope.  :)  Now I just have to be able to defend that &quot;nope&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One thing that I am a bit afraid to go into (within the interview) is the whole joy/happiness thing.  I don&#39;t think I dare mention that that&#39;s what is important to me now.  It would probably be seen as neglect. Isn&#39;t that crazy.  Why can&#39;t that be enough?!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I know that my children will learn what they need to learn.  Its just so hard to convey that to people who are new to these thoughts.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll have to speak a lot of educationese. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248938864">FWIW, from my one experience at being interviewed for parenting issues (extended nursing for a local alternative weekly).  Don&#39;t assume that someone who is giving you social cues of &quot;I get it&quot; actually gets it.  I went into the interview expecting that the reporter wanted to understand what I was saying and that if I wasn&#39;t clear  she would ask more questions or at least look puzzled.  But so far as I can tell, she was either formulating her next question while I was speaking or just nodding her head and looking as she were following the conversation in order to keep me talking.  I know that happens in ordinary conversation (I do it myself when I&#39;m more interested in the connection than whether I actually understand what the person is saying).  I just didn&#39;t expect to find that behavior in a reporter doing an interview.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess that is just a warning that even if the interview seems to be going well, it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you&#39;ll like the article. <br/>

Yeah,, that&#39;s one thing I&#39;m worrying about.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Even if I don&#39;t like it,, just the reporter&#39;s own spin on it scares me.  Amy, my friend, says that this reporter is very conscious of staying obvective and presenting facts that way.  But you just never know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-760716681">I did an interview on TV once and swear I will never do it again.  It was right after Sept. 11 and the reporter asked me NOTHING about whether or not I think more ppl were deciding to homeschool as a result of the tragedy.  Well, I watch it on the news a few days later and their &quot;expert&quot; trashed homeschooling and safety up and down...<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s quite funny because their expert was a school board member who had a fw months earlier contacted me and asked me to be on his advisory board, and we knew each other quite well.  When I was talking to the reporter I had no idea he would be on the other end, and when he was talking about the &quot;homeschooler&quot; he had no idea he was talking about me!<br/>
 <br/>
Perhaps a newspaper article won&#39;t be so easy to twist around, but know that the reporter may use only half of a sentence, or place the sentences awkwardly so it seems to twist what you are saying.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t defend it, either, in the way my natural inclinations would <br/>
like me to. Meaning - I can&#39;t give evidence of research, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So that has always left me feeling a little vulnerable - even though I <br/>
am FULLY confident - too much of my confidence is based on some kind of <br/>
resonance within me that this is just RIGHT.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, now I have evidence of my own - my older kids are old enough <br/>
to be considered &quot;success stories.&quot; So odd. I consider Rosie, at 13, <br/>
just as much a success right now as Roya, who is going to college - but <br/>
she doesn&#39;t constitute &quot;evidence&quot; the way Roya does.<br/>
<br/>
And I suppose some people wouldn&#39;t see Rox as a success story, because <br/>
she puts nearly all her time and energy into musical theater and some <br/>
would see that as too one-dimensional or something. Last night I bought <br/>
her the boxed set of dvd&#39;s of Broadway: the American Musical -- which <br/>
recently showed on PBS. The DVD&#39;s have, of course, hours of extras. It <br/>
was $60 and my friend was surprised I&#39;d spend that on such a thing. <br/>
Would somebody hesitate to pay that for an advanced astronomy series <br/>
for a kid who was into rocket science? They&#39;d think that was a bargain. <br/>
&lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the world through the lens of musical theater has been <br/>
fascinating for me - EVERYTHING is connected - we&#39;ve done every social <br/>
issue, all periods of history, politics, world events, psychology, and <br/>
on and on.<br/>

I think it is worthwhile to ask if you can look it over.  At the very least, you should be able to see how they said what you said, to check if they caught your intent.<br/>

I have been interviewed for newspapers before and they do offer you a chance (usually) to <br/>
review the article. I had to have something changed in the last interview because the <br/>
interviewer had misunderstood me and then wrote her perspective which was not mine. <br/>

If they don&#39;t offer you a chance to review the article, definitely request the opportunity. <br/>
Most newspapers will be willing to honor that request.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900145336">**I think it is worthwhile to ask if you can look it over.**<br/>
 <br/>
Good point.  I was pretty much thinking it was wishful thinking, but how do you know if you don&#39;t ask.  Duh...<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
**Will you have notes for yourself?  Particular phrases or points you&#39;d like to make?**<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I think I will.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also questions to ask, that will make her think.<br/>

OK,  so now I know that it is common practice.  It wouldn&#39;t be off of me to ask, if they don&#39;t offer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

Thanks guys,  I&#39;ll let you all know how it goes.<br/>

Have you read anything this reporter has written? There are good and <br/>
bad writers, some who evenly show different views and some who are <br/>
going to write about their personal opinions and put down others. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is so far outside of what a lot of people have considered <br/>
that I would worry about how some people might mangle an explanation <br/>
(heck, including me on a bad day).<br/>

I&#39;ve been told no.  I&#39;ve been asked to help review.  It&#39;s going to be <br/>
different every time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been interviewed by radio twice, promised a taped copy both times, <br/>
received one neither time.  I was interviewed by phone by a newspaper far far away <br/>
(Portland Oregonian) and DID receive a copy of the finished article by mail.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t count on advance anything. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

It&#39;s like a river flowing, and into each river a little crap must fall.<br/>
