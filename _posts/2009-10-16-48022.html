<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252003006">Hi all. I&#39;m new(ish) here and not really unschooling, as my son is only 9 months old, but I&#39;ve been learning so much from following this group and from Sandra&#39;s site. I&#39;m so grateful that I&#39;ve found unschooling while my son is so young.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking lately about all the arguments against unschooling (and homeschooling in general) that I see and hear in various places, such as the assertion that &quot;everyone NEEDS to learn algebra, calculus, biology, chemistry, and physics, etc., and that no mom can teach those subjects as well as a certified, trained, professional teacher, blah, blah, blah.&quot; So for the last couple months I&#39;ve been thinking to myself when I see that argument, &quot;well, yeah, they are necessary subjects, but unschoolers can learn those things on their own, or from a tutor or mentor, or a college class.&quot; But I&#39;ve gradually come to feel that they really aren&#39;t necessary for everyone (or even most people), since not everyone has a need for calculus or chemistry every day. I never took chemistry, and aside from losing a couple bets with my husband, it hasn&#39;t impaired my life at all. ;)<br/>
<br/>
It seems like there are so many other subjects that are far more USEFUL in life, but that aren&#39;t offered in K-12 schools at all. Relevant, helpful, important information. Just off the top of my head, here are subjects that are more interesting and relevant to my life than calculus, chemistry, et al.: politics, philosophy, comparative religion, home maintenance, architecture, ecology, weather systems, sources of energy, war, journalism, gardening/farming, nutrition, electrical engineering, statistics, health and the healthcare industry, law, ethics, computer programming, web development, business organization, and so on. John Taylor Gatto mentions dialectics as an important subject no one teaches anymore, and I don&#39;t even know what that word means!<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve finally gotten over the notion that there are certain &quot;subjects&quot; everyone needs to learn between ages 6 and 16. Now I just need to get over being pissed off about wasting so much time in school.<br/>
<br/>
So tell me... what are your answers when people question you about these &quot;necessary&quot; subjects? It took me months, with a LOT of learning and reflecting, to get over my hangups just about this topic - how do you talk about this kind of thing with a highly skeptical questioner (say, a family member who you have to see all the time) when they have no interest in an actual conversation, let alone to have their entire worldview challenged?</div>

 </span></blockquote>One argument that I have used is this: Most of us create garbage, drive <br/>
cars, eat food, and live in buildings, etc, etc. People who provide <br/>
these goods and services are essential to us in the way we live our <br/>
lives, now. It is elitist for me to assume  my children are above these <br/>
things, and that we are a part of class that must pursue an &quot;academic&quot; <br/>
path to professional careers, in order to avoid manual labor or service. <br/>
Part of really being okay with unschooling for me was to accept that all <br/>
paths were acceptable, and valid, and  potentially wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was an english major who is now a carpenter. Some might  <br/>
argue that he is more useful in his current profession- though I am sure <br/>
english majors can be quite useful, sometimes. He uses lots of geometry <br/>
and math, and some science, but has learned that on the job, or at least <br/>
REALLY learned it. He runs into customers and people new to the business <br/>
who don&#39;t know how to read a tape measure. Presumably most of them went <br/>
to school, and learned about measurement there, but don&#39;t use it, so <br/>
don&#39;t know it.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many different ways a person can be useful or enjoyable, to <br/>
themselves, and to others. SO many. I find it presumptuous to think that <br/>
anyone would know what another person might need to know in pursuit of <br/>
their as yet unknown path. I have seen time and time again that my kids <br/>
can pick up very quickly what they need and want to know. So can I. I <br/>
have a degree in my field, but have learned most of what I use everyday <br/>
from doing it. The use of computers has changed everything so completely <br/>
that I really had to learn all of that on my own after returning to it <br/>
after a break when my kids were young.<br/>
<br/>
The knowledge needed for many careers is changing daily, as technology <br/>
changes. You could mention that. So the most needed skill for adapting <br/>
in a rapidly changing world is the ability to learn what one needs in <br/>
any situation, with confidence. My kids have that. I am not at all <br/>
worried that they will find ways to be useful, and get compensated for <br/>
that. What that is and what they might need to know for it is unknown to <br/>
me at this time. It is actually unknown to me what I might need to know <br/>
for the future, too.<br/>
<br/>
However, you don&#39;t HAVE to talk to them about it. Changing the subject <br/>
is fine, too. Mostly staying off the subject of what we DON&#39;T do at home <br/>
has been the best strategy. People are usually pretty satifistied to <br/>
hear about what we ARE doing. As that is really cool, and pretty <br/>
distracting. Listening to NPR also provides me with lots of distracting <br/>
topics of conversation, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-701191925">Rachel,<br/>
I tend to not enter in to conversations about unschooling with people who aren&#39;t interested in understanding it.  Your child is so young that you could just stick with telling them that you plan to homeschool and tell them of all the online schools and wonderful curriculum available, just to get them off your case. <br/>
<br/>
 Unschooling doesn&#39;t need defending and unless they are your spouse, you don&#39;t need their permission.  As my kids have gotten older some of our skeptical relatives have come on board with the idea of open source learning (everyone a child meets is a possible teacher) if not unschooling (children can learn on their own).  This has allowed the relatives to get involved as facilitators in the kids learning.  It took time and the understanding that this was the direction we were taking with or without blessings from those around us.<br/>
<br/>
I think the amount of effort you put into it should depend on how integral the person is in your lives.<br/>

<br/>
This is a good suggestion, and it&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve done when people clearly seemed to be in challenge and put- <br/>
down mode, certain they were about to ask some question I had never  <br/>
considered (yeah; what are the odds?) is I would give them a book and  <br/>
say that if they wanted to know more they should read that, and then  <br/>
if they wanted to discuss it I&#39;d be glad to.<br/>
<br/>
It was a big if/then condition on any further conversation about it.<br/>
<br/>
If they read the book (used to be Linda Dobson&#39;s Book of Homeschool  <br/>
Answers, sometimes, or Mary Griffith&#39;s Unschooling book, or maybe a  <br/>
website), I wouldn&#39;t have to answer their questions because the book  <br/>
did it for me.  If they don&#39;t read the book, I don&#39;t have to answer  <br/>
their questions because they haven&#39;t fulfilled the condition I put on  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Basically I was saying they weren&#39;t qualified to discuss it with me,  <br/>
but if they wanted to study up, I&#39;d give them some of my time.<br/>
<br/>
If you do that now, you could use my new book! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/bigbook">http://sandradodd.com/bigbook</a><br/>
<br/>
But if they come back with anything at all like &quot;Yeah, but...&quot; you can  <br/>
say &quot;Have you finished that book I gave you?&quot;  If they say they don&#39;t  <br/>
want to read a book, they want you to tell them, you could say that&#39;s  <br/>
the problem with school, is that it keeps people from wanting to learn  <br/>
on their own, but that you&#39;re not in the business of spoon-feeding  <br/>
people information.<br/>

<br/>
Really?  I&#39;m 56 years old and never &quot;took&quot; calculus, and never learned  <br/>
it on my own. I haven&#39;t needed it yet.   I married a guy who  <br/>
understands it well enough to tutor others, but he works mathishly and  <br/>
knows lots of mathematical ways of thinking.    So as community  <br/>
property goes, our family has calculus, but there are families all  <br/>
around us who don&#39;t know it, I&#39;m sure, and their cars run and their  <br/>
dogs bark.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Necessary&quot; is worth reconsidering.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=&quot;everyone NEEDS to learn algebra, calculus, biology, chemistry, and  <br/>
physics, etc.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Biology&quot; is a huge field.  My kids have picked up lots of information  <br/>
about cells and skin, reproduction of animals, plants and humans,  <br/>
health, diseases and strength, nutrition (for plants and animals)...   <br/>
Holly had a boyfriend with a degree in genetics.   He didn&#39;t live a  <br/>
better life than my kids do, nor get along with people better, nor  <br/>
earn and save money better.<br/>
<br/>
Little boys learn more about physics by playing with toy cars and  <br/>
balls, from sports and wagons/bicycles/skateboards than someone  <br/>
sedentary learns in a basic physics classroom.  Someone can listen and  <br/>
take notes about angles and force without a clue what it might be good  <br/>
for.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832162838">  ***I think I&#39;ve finally gotten over the notion that there are certain &quot;subjects&quot; everyone needs to learn between ages 6 and 16.***<br/>
<br/>
Seperating the world into subjects, in and of itself, is something to question and ponder, let alone whether or not some of those subjects are needed or not.<br/>
<br/>
The real natural working world doesn&#39;t work that way.  Everything is interconnected with everything else.  My kids are exposed to other kids who go to school, so they are familiar with the notion of &quot;subjects&quot;. It&#39;s something I wish I could take away from their knowledge.  In the age of DaVinci, math, art, and science were all studied together.  Throughout history, knowledge and learning have been lumped together in many different ways.<br/>
<br/>
If you go way back to Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, the people who have been attributed with starting the basis of western philosophy, you see that they all studied everything, each with their own personal reflection on the world, writing and discussing things that were more relevant to each of them as individuals.  It wasn&#39;t until modern, post Renaissance thinking, that educational theories and thoughts started narrowly defining the world and breaking them up into mini subjects.  (correct me if I&#39;m wrong here, anyone who may know more about this than I do)<br/>
<br/>
When you hear the phrase Renaissance Man, what does that imply?  Simply a very wide breadth of knowledge, in modern terminology, one who has studied and excelled in many subjects.  But, I don&#39;t think scholars of the Renaissance were breaking everything down into &quot;subjects&quot; like what we do today in modern schools, and even then, not everyone was actually in an academy, DaVinci is a prime example.  Learning was an all encompassing thing.  The Renaissance was hugely influenced by Greek scholars, which doesn&#39;t surprise me in the least.  Even so, there were even more people using skilled labor and thinking and passing on their skills to the next generation, who weren&#39;t scholars.  If I had to guess, I&#39;d say that DaVinci was so very important because he directly impacted skilled labor.  From the middle ages until somewhere about the mid 1800&#39;s, coinciding with compulsory schooling, most young people learned through apprenticeships, or through skills<br/>
 passed on from their own families&#39; trades.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my very brief summary of how I think about &quot;subjects&quot; and education and why I don&#39;t like everything broken down into neat little packages called &quot;subjects&quot;.  I think it inhibits real thought and real learning.  Not to even get into the fact that scholars were adults, not children ages 6-16, and young people, roughly ages 13-16, were already working and in apprenticeships.  While I have no doubt that many children worked, they were still children.  I know I&#39;m hugely oversimplifying here.<br/>

From that website:***Oddly, by this I do not mean &#39;literacy&#39; in the traditional sense, but rather, how to look at some text and to understand, in a deep way, what is being asserted (this also applies to audio and video, but grounding yourself in text will transfer relatively easily, if incompletely, to other domains).***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While I agree with much of that, I&#39;d just like to point out that the reverse is true also.  Acquiring knowledge and literacy through audio and video, translates very nicely to real reading, when the person is ready to read.  By the time Chamille picked up her first book and read it, she&#39;d already acquired many books through cd&#39;s and tapes and videos.  Since she had heard the written word, and stories, and ideas, it made it very easy for her to have a solid understanding of literature and vocabulary. <br/>

 <br/>
You&#39;d have to start at square one and you just can&#39;t do that with some people!  Sometimes talking politics IS much safer!<br/>
