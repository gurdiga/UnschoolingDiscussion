<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944176769">I just posted another message with this quote from an article that I <br/>
think Sandra referred me to and I wanted to start another  message <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Choice is a really important conceptÂ—not just semantics. It&#39;s the <br/>
difference between anger, regret, resentment and happiness, comfort <br/>
and joy in life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
About 4 years ago, we lived with my husbands grandma to care for her <br/>
after grandpa died and she couldn&#39;t live alone any longer.  To try to <br/>
make a long story short, she fell, broke both arms, it was cheaper <br/>
for me to quit my job and take care of her than going into a nursing <br/>
home/rehab center so yes, I chose to care for her.  I should have <br/>
known better - for as long as we knew her, she was known to say mean, <br/>
spitefull things, talk behind your back, be very demanding <br/>
etc....Well, I took care of her for about 18 months full time - alone <br/>
because no one else in the family could stand to be around her.  I <br/>
almost fell apart - I think I must have had a nervous breakdown - I <br/>
made some really bad choices because I was so miserable - I turned <br/>
into her - I was just awful to be around but didn&#39;t feel like I had <br/>
any choices.  Even though she was so awful to me, I couldn&#39;t stand <br/>
the thought of putting her in a nursing home, I was afraid that she <br/>
would feel so alone and out of place so I wouldn&#39;t consider it.  My <br/>
family & marriage suffered terribly until she passed away.  After she <br/>
was gone I told myself &quot;never again&quot;.  But as I see our parents <br/>
aging, I&#39;m already telling myself I couldn&#39;t put them in a nursing <br/>
home - yes that&#39;s my choice I guess but it&#39;s also my responsibility?  <br/>
or my guilt?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m kind of in the same boat now - I&#39;m not very happy with my life <br/>
but I feel I have no choice and it&#39;s due to guilt.  I work for my <br/>
dad&#39;s small business, it&#39;s going under, they just filed bankruptcy <br/>
but if we can someone just make it work until dad&#39;s full retirement <br/>
kicks in in about a year, I&#39;m barely getting paid anymore, we are <br/>
falling behind on our bills, but if I quit (which I really would have <br/>
liked to do years ago) then my mom would have to do my job and the <br/>
last time they tried working together they almost got a divorce and <br/>
still have marriage problems.  So I stay, also I tell myself it&#39;s a <br/>
good flexible situation with my daughter being homeschooled and them <br/>
being her grandparents!  Then throw my 28 year old brother into the <br/>
picture, he&#39;s back home with my mom & dad, trying to recover from <br/>
prescription drug abuse.  He&#39;s been home 3 years and driving us all <br/>
crazy - we think he&#39;s bipolar, there&#39;s no money for counseling etc.. <br/>
his pride prevents him from going to the county for help unless one <br/>
of us take him by the hand etc.... I learned my lesson from taking <br/>
care of grandma - I don&#39;t want to be around a situation like that <br/>
again but I kind of am now.  BUT my guilt makes me stay or my feeling <br/>
of responsibility.  I&#39;d love to say that I quit because I need a <br/>
paycheck, and not worry about what that will do to mom and I love to <br/>
work somewhere else where I&#39;m not around my brother all day BUT <br/>
again, I stay..........Is that my choice?  or my guilt?  or my <br/>
responsibility?<br/>

What if you and your mom together go to your dad and say &quot;This isn&#39;t a doable <br/>
job.  It&#39;s killing me and it would kill mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Can your brother do the job you&#39;re doing, at least half time?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You can&#39;t get this time back.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe make a list on paper with the &quot;pro&quot; column and the &quot;anti-&quot; column.  <br/>
What are the advantages to your staying there?    What harm can (or is) coming of <br/>
it?  What harm might come of your quitting?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an easy question.  Try to look at it, too, from five years away.  <br/>
Run several mental simulations, if you can, kind of like thinking ahead a few <br/>
moves in a game.  What are the best possible outcomes?  Some of the worst ones?  <br/>
Don&#39;t just think of one or two.  Think of six or seven.  Take notes, or draw <br/>
pictures.   Breathe deeply and don&#39;t let the stress of all this get you stuck <br/>
and sleepless.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not a whole &quot;answer,&quot; it&#39;s just some ideas to help you back out of the <br/>
mire and look at it in a less tangled way.   Maybe you do need to finish, but <br/>
how can you see it clearly enough to feel better about it?  (That&#39;s what the <br/>
suggestions are intended to help with, I hope.)<br/>
<br/>
Another idea is to take a break from it for a week or two.  Leave town.  See <br/>
how it goes with your mom or brother doing it instead.  Then when you come <br/>
back (if you come back) you can tell your dad more clearly what you see (maybe).<br/>

 <br/>
It must be paying off for you in some way to be a doormat.  Have you  read <br/>
Sandra&#39;s Certificate of Empowerment?<br/>
 <br/>
Another thing...you&#39;re taking care of your parents business, but because  <br/>
you&#39;re not getting paid enough, your family is suffering.  <br/>
 <br/>
You should feel guilty about that.  Your parents are grown up and  you&#39;re not <br/>
responsible for their choices.  Do you want your kids to feel  obligated to <br/>
you like you feel to your parents and ignore their families true  and rightful <br/>
needs?  No, of course not.  Don&#39;t model misplaced  martyrdom for them.<br/>
