<div id="ygrps-yiv-227237533">Hi Vivian, I was thinking about that lately, too.  I tell people &quot;They<br/>
follow their interests, and the bases end up being covered.&quot;  It is sort<br/>
of a political answer.  Another political answer I tell people, &quot;They<br/>
choose their own custom-made curriculum.&quot;  But another thought is to<br/>
answer their question with another question.  &quot;How do you know they will<br/>
learn with a curriculum?  If someone isn&#39;t interested, or ready to learn<br/>
something, it will just go in one ear and out the other.&quot;  <br/>
I am not a very trusting person, so I don&#39;t tell people that I unschool<br/>
unless they are close.  I guess that&#39;s why I give political answers.<br/>
My daughter (Phoebe age seven) started unschooling in the fall and hated<br/>
flashcards, (so I didn&#39;t push it), then recently decided to make her<br/>
own-she didn&#39;t want me to make them.  Guess what, they are all large<br/>
numbers.  She must have been so bored with the small numbers.  She also<br/>
(I&#39;ve said this before) will say how many of a number is somewhere<br/>
without counting one, two, three-just by glancing at something.  She<br/>
plays a lot with the calculator.  I bought her some modeling clay, and<br/>
she will share one fourth of it with her brother, (see the math?).  She<br/>
asked, so I showed her on graph paper how you can color in the squares to<br/>
see how multiplication works, but she hasn&#39;t pursued it (so I let it go).<br/>
Her brother (Seth age nine) is finally starting to get unschooling.  He<br/>
decided he wants to make a lot of money to share with the poor.  I told<br/>
him to talk to a friend who runs a local charity.  After talking to him,<br/>
he decided to make money by doing yardwork for people.  He then wants to<br/>
buy bulk candy with half of it, sell the candy for a greater price, give<br/>
half of it to a local hunger organization, and reinvest a portion of the<br/>
rest.  To figure out the price of each candy, he will count the<br/>
individual candies and divide the amount he wants to make by the number<br/>
of candies.  He plans to sell it to the neighbor kids who eat lots of<br/>
candy anyway.  (I don&#39;t like candy because I think sugar is very<br/>
unhealthy, but I don&#39;t want to keep him from following his passion.)  He<br/>
has made money this way from selling candy before, but he gave it up<br/>
since it had no purpose.  Now that there is a reason for it, he is<br/>
gung-ho.  See the math?<br/>
He is also learning a lot from computer games, including vocabulary and<br/>
spelling.<br/>
My other boys (Rex age fourteen, Caleb age eleven) have math textbooks,<br/>
but only look at them when they feel like it, which is actually quite<br/>
often.  Plus they do like the jokes and ideas I get from Natural Math.  I<br/>
just present it in a conversational way.  They have been learning things<br/>
that they were &quot;supposed&quot; to know from doing it in school, but since they<br/>
only did it for a grade or to pass a test, they didn&#39;t get it.  <br/>
Maybe you could just give the answer, &quot;They will learn math by<br/>
experience.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-894501198">I think that is one of the myths of ps, that math has to be taught that<br/>
way, in boxes.  Why not learn addition, subtraction, multiplication and<br/>
division at the same time, as it relates to something that needs to be<br/>
done?  My dad never learned to read because he skipped school throughout<br/>
childhood because of running away from his abusive father so much.  So,<br/>
how did he learn math?  I used to see his writing on cardboard and boards<br/>
in the barn figuring out how many bails of hay he&#39;ll need to get through<br/>
winter or how much he&#39;ll need to spend on grain, or charge for services. <br/>
You see, when he ran away from home it was to his sister&#39;s ranch to hang<br/>
out with the horse show and rodeo cowboys.  He learned to rope and ride<br/>
and care for animals, to do everything he later did as a very successful<br/>
rancher.<br/>
I remember when I was in the fourth grade, looking at my seventh grade<br/>
sister&#39;s math and yearning to do it.  They were using graphs and axes. <br/>
It looked so fun.  I could not figure out why they were going to make me<br/>
wait three years to do it.  As it turns out, the only math I ever loved<br/>
in school was Geometry and Trigonometry.  That&#39;s because we were really<br/>
drawing.  I didn&#39;t know it then, since they killed my passion for math,<br/>
but that is the foundation of computer programming.  <br/>
My brother works for microsoft and he was allowed to pursue his passions.<br/>
 My stepmom let him get into all sorts of stuff when he was little.  He<br/>
would dismantle our phonographs, tape-recorders and blow-dryers.  When we<br/>
complained, he put them back together.  He would watch my dad fix the<br/>
truck, and understood how an engine worked when he was only four years<br/>
old.  My brother almost didn&#39;t graduate high school, from all his f&#39;s in<br/>
English.  He skipped English to go to the computer lab and play with<br/>
computers.  Fortunately my sister tutored him that last six months of<br/>
prison, I mean high school, so he was set free, I mean graduated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848222803">Bonni- Thanks for the answer. Your kids sound alot like my children. Well I had this Math conversation with a trusted friend of mine who is a homeschooler and leaning more and more towards unschooling every day. Her arguement for the math curriculum was very legitimate. She says dont the kids need math in some sort of order and doesnt it need to be built on? Meaning doesnt learning math need to be like a stair case, where you start with a step and learn and add more as you go up the stair case. (is this making sense?) I could understand exactly what she meant and I tried to point out that it is more for the teachers that they teach math this way. It is easier for them to start teaching in September if they know where the teacher left off in June. Any thoughts on this?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-940438849"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;My brother almost didn&#39;t graduate high school, from all his f&#39;s in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>English.  He skipped English to go to the computer lab and play with<br/>
computers.  Fortunately my sister tutored him that last six months of<br/>
prison, I mean high school, so he was set free, I mean graduated.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This was my Dad! Well, except that they didn&#39;t have computer lab in 1939. <br/>
;-) But he also had loads of trouble in school due to poor English grades. <br/>
And they&#39;d also mark his math papers wrong, or worse failed for cheating, <br/>
becasue he didn&#39;t show his steps when he solved problems.<br/>
<br/>
This man definitely dreams in numbers. I wouldn&#39;t recognize his house if he <br/>
didn&#39;t have long strings of numbers listed on papers on various desk tops <br/>
and counters throughout the house. He hated his one year in Cooper Union <br/>
College and went on to become an Electrical Engineer on his own. He told me <br/>
that the schools step by step process didn&#39;t make sense to him. He had to <br/>
make sense of the numbers on his own.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the best part of the story follows. This man who failed every English <br/>
class, who hated to read, who swore he couldn&#39;t write or spell, has written <br/>
a book. When he retired he became one of those guys who does geneology. He <br/>
does nothing but read, write, research and use his beloved numbers <br/>
practically every day. He wrote a book on his findings and they put it in <br/>
his local library for other researchers to use. He is just my best example <br/>
of *they&#39;ll learn it because they need it and have an interest*.<br/>

Stanford to become an electrical engineer a few years earlier.  I wonder if <br/>
he realized he could have done it on his own.<br/>

very interested in all the alternative energy stuff and done something in <br/>
that area.  He was always inventing little things and also very much an <br/>
environmentalist.<br/>

<br/>
  That&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to give you, though.  Take the doubters some copies <br/>
