<div id="ygrps-yiv-317394544">I have list-confusion a lot but I&#39;m pretty sure Joylyn posted here... <br/>
<br/>
Joylyn Fowler&#39;s daughter, Lexie, is in the hospital. She fell and broke<br/>
her femur yesterday, and just got out of surgery this morning. She&#39;s in<br/>
good spirits (Joylyn shared some very classic Lexie-remarks) but it&#39;s a<br/>
serious injury with a significant possibility of permanent lasting<br/>
effects.<br/>
<br/>
Good thoughts or prayers would be very welcome. Joylyn says that Lexie<br/>
should be going home tomorrow, but will be in a full-body cast for 3<br/>
weeks. She suggested that any home-made cards would also be very welcome,<br/>
and also if anyone wants to send along a favorite book for Lexie to read<br/>
while recuperating that would be appreciated. They also have a<br/>
playstation and Joylyn said that some new-to-them games for Lexie to<br/>
borrow while on bedrest would be another good idea.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t ask about sharing her home address - I don&#39;t think she&#39;d mind<br/>
but I&#39;ll wait to hear it from her. Her email addresss is<br/>

Lexie is one of the Dragon Tree kids - our local park day group.<br/>

She&#39;s in a cast from her chest and to her foot on one side and part way <br/>
down other side.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s 9. She&#39;s a voracious reader, so fun things to read would be <br/>
appreciated, I&#39;m sure. And anything else you can dream up to keep her <br/>
occupied and entertained. In fact, I&#39;m sure Joylyn would appreciate <br/>
some suggestions - it is going to be a long long month.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314178748">Hi everyone<br/>
<br/>
Lexie is home, and watching tv, and as OK as possible.  She was thrilled <br/>
by the ambulance ride home (she has a body cast that has her hips/legs <br/>
positioned very strangely and will not fit in a car, at least not <br/>
initially). <br/>
<br/>
A better email is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:joylyn1@...">joylyn1@...</a> and if anyone wants my address I <br/>
agree with Dar that a favorite book would be an excellent thing, she&#39;s <br/>
going to have many hours of immobility, and playstation (one) games <br/>
would also be great.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your healing thoughts/prayers/candle lighting, etc.  <br/>
We won&#39;t know for 2-3 months if there is permanent damage, but sadly the <br/>
good outcome is only about 40%, so we need to focus on that 40% (Lexie <br/>
is unaware of the bigger picture...she is very positive and strong and <br/>
assertive about her needs, which is what she needs to be.)<br/>
