<div id="ygrps-yiv-865251883"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; How do you all feel about weekly allowances?  Did/do you give your<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think Harriet is ready for some spending money of her own, but it seems<br/>
like she tends to pick the first thing she sees.  We went clothes shopping<br/>
the other day and I decided to let her put just about everything she wanted<br/>
in the cart.  Then I went to a quiet corner in the store and asked her to<br/>
pick 2 things.  We talked about why she picked those 2 things and she<br/>
changed her mind on one of them, not sure why but any how, she was very<br/>
happy with the 2 things she picked.  Unfortunately, I forgot completely<br/>
about giving her money to buy it herself.  I think she would enjoy that.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s 4, a little shy but very articulate.  I seem to be feeling the need to<br/>
make this more complicated than it probably needs to be.  She isn&#39;t asking<br/>
for money yet, or to buy things herself.  I&#39;m a recovering control freak<br/>
trying to figure out how to let go ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Of course, because she is 4 and because buying her own stuff is new.  Right<br/>
now, for her, it isn&#39;t about WHAT she is buying but simply that she is<br/>
BUYING.  It is the thrill of control, of decision, of owning.<br/>
<br/>
It will wear off and she will be more discerning.  It takes awhile.  So give<br/>
her the amount of money you can be comfortable with and let go.<br/>

***************<br/>
<br/>
Lydia (now 6) went through nearly a year of having her allowance (5/wk) burn a hole in her pocket.  If she got it, she had to go spend it and if the store didn&#39;t have what she wanted, then she bought something just to buy it.   Gradually, though, she changed until now she can walk into a toy store with $20 in her pocket and walk back out because they didn&#39;t really have anything that she wanted.  <br/>
