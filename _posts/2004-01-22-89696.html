in blue.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not on yahoogroups e-mail, I dont think.  If you stay within one system <br/>
(yahoo to yahoo, aol to aol) you can sometimes keep some HTML stuff in an e-mail, <br/>
but generally it will fall out, and for some older computers no such a thing is <br/>
going to show.<br/>
<br/>
If e-mails have plenty of broken-up space (paragraphs) and marks to show <br/>
quotes, then anyone can follow.<br/>
