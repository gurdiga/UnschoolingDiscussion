<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; was working in the dark most of the time, knowing in my heart this was<br/>
&gt; right, but unaware of just how incredible it would turn out to be.  My<br/>
&gt; children are much more aware of what they are working toward and options<br/>
&gt; available as they home/unschool their own kids and doing a beautiful job!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandi, I would love to hear more about both how you knew to trust, and just<br/>
how incredible things turned out.  Can you name those illusive qualities for<br/>
us?  I know people are asking me about my teen and I honestly can&#39;t give<br/>
them a coherent answer at times.  I have a very self-possesed, very<br/>
intelligent young adult.  She puts me to shame on many days.  I know that my<br/>
ability to trust her set the stage for developing herself, but it would be<br/>
great if we could define trust just a bit more.<br/>

 &lt;&lt;of the other hs&#39;ing families we met early on in person were Fundies<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and we had such strong philosophical differences that they seemed as weird<br/>
&gt; to us as I am sure we seemed to them.  By the time we came to Oklahoma, I<br/>
&gt; was beginning to feel that others within the homeschooling community were<br/>
&gt; far greater threats to our right to homeschool in the way that best fit<br/>
 </span></blockquote>our<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; family than anyone outside could be, so we were fairly isolated in<br/>
&gt; homeschooling,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I would like to hear  more about what you see presently within the<br/>
homeschooling community.  Are we going forward?  Where are  our current<br/>
threats?<br/>
<br/>
(As you might have guessed,  I&#39;ve saved some email to respond to.  It&#39;s<br/>
spring cleaning time around here, and this mailbox was next on the list.<br/>
;))<br/>
