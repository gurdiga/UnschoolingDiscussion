&lt;&lt;  My son paused and considered.  &quot;Well,&quot; he said <br/>
 thoughtfully, &quot;we&#39;re unschoolers, so the possibilities are endless!&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    We are still working on getting to this point. I decided to try something <br/>
different with my 11yro. today.I read an essay about a family&#39;s journey <br/>
through hsing. It was a little over his head but he has me so frustrated <br/>
trying to figure out what I&#39;m supposed to do with/for him as far as hsing <br/>
goes. The woman who wrote the article told how they decided to hs and <br/>
expressed the doubts they had along the way. What I really wanted him to hear <br/>
was how they came to believe that letting a child find his own way was the <br/>
best way to learn. After they had been hsing several years she became a sub. <br/>
teacher. This really cemented for her that hsing is the best for children. <br/>
The story had much more than that but I hope you get the point.<br/>
    We have had a couple of bad days with the boys bickering, fighting and <br/>
worst of all older chasing younger around house. UGH! Today was better. <br/>
    Anyway I think the article did help. He gets angry and accuses me of not <br/>
teaching him anything. A ridiculous accusation since he has accomplished <br/>
quite a bit of work and mastered a few things that eluded him in school. <br/>
    I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that possibly he is acting out of fear. The <br/>
same fear we experience day to day on this journey. I think he becomes afraid <br/>
he&#39;s missing something or won&#39;t learn something important. <br/>
    Our conversations led to some very interesting comments by him. He told <br/>
me why he hated art class. He who is an artist. He would get excited when the <br/>
teacher would say we are going to draw something today...Then she would ruin <br/>
it by telling them what they had to draw and continue with how to draw it. He <br/>
would have rather she let them draw and be there when they needed help. Wow! <br/>
He said the same with clay, why couldn&#39;t they make what they wanted. I guess <br/>
it&#39;s kind of hard to grade someone&#39;s original work isn&#39;t it. If you have a <br/>
model than one is to copy it.<br/>
    The other was about the library. He said we looked forward to library, <br/>
but when we got there the librarian (at school) would give us these handouts <br/>
and we had to write over and over for several weeks who was author, when <br/>
printed, things about alphabetical order etc. I was so surprised, he had <br/>
never told me this before. What a way to ruin the joy of going to the <br/>
library. I have been wondering why he always says he hates the library when <br/>
he used to love it.<br/>
    I know this is long and I&#39;ve been thinking about it a while how to <br/>
explain it. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve done a good job or not. I have a hard enough <br/>
time reassuring myself so when he explodes I feel panicky. Not because I <br/>
doubt what I&#39;m trying to do but because he is having such a time adjusting. I <br/>
don&#39;t want to be angry with him since I do believe this is what he is <br/>
expressing but some days are so hard.<br/>
    Has anyone else dealt with this and if so how did give reassurance?<br/>
