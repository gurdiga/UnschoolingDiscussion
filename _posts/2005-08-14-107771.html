Marty got his full driver&#39;s license last week.   He&#39;s 16.   His handwriting <br/>
is a quick kind of printing where he makes each letter without any regard to <br/>
the one before or after it.   He&#39;s more likely to go clockwise than <br/>
counter-clockwise when &quot;good&quot; writers (school-trained practitioners of Palmer cursive, I <br/>
mean--good American writers who were unlucky enough to be stuck with the <br/>
old-time cursive) would go counter for loops and bowls.<br/>
<br/>
Marty writes VERY small.   So does Kirby.   I think they got it from writing <br/>
as small as the printed words they were seeing in books and on gaming cards.   <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So at motor vehicles, you write your signature on paper and they put all the <br/>
stuff in the machine and it comes out a little smaller in the finished <br/>
version.   Marty&#39;s is already nearly too small to read, so the &quot;signature&quot; looks like <br/>
little boxy marks.     Luckily, he&#39;ll be able to reproduce that signature in <br/>
any situation requiring him to do so, and others wouldn&#39;t be able to begin to <br/>
do it, and that&#39;s the purpose of signatures anyway.<br/>

I ask because I grew up there and still live within 30 miles :)<br/>
Oh yeah, we lived on Oak Ridge, not Ash (hee hee)<br/>

Now SEE??? &quot;Oh yeah, we lived on Oak Ridge, not Ash<br/>

<br/>
Oak Ridge. <br/>
<br/>
We have Central Ave, but even that gets lengthened to &quot;old Rt. 66&quot; and we did <br/>
have Grand Ave, but it got lengthened to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <br/>
Boulevard.  Didn&#39;t even keep &quot;Avenue.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And other street names (without digging for extra long ones)...<br/>
We&#39;re near the intersection of Juan Tabo and Candelaria.<br/>
Our old house (on Princess Jeanne) was nearest Wyoming and Constitution. <br/>
<br/>
Paseo del Norte (pretty short as such names go) is the way Keith and Kirby <br/>
both go to work.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh well...  I can write small. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

abbreviated to: MLK Jr. Blvd-is yours? We also have a street nearby that is <br/>
long: Cleveland-Massillon Road, which at least at some parts, has 5 and 6 digit <br/>
house numbers. Most freeway signs can&#39;t even hold the whole length and it has <br/>
to be shortened... I never thought about streets being hard to put on forms <br/>
until this thread, but have always wondered about the name sections-especially <br/>
those ones with the little boxes for each letter that are such SMALL boxes, and <br/>
very few of them. I&#39;ve been lucky enough to have short enough last names all <br/>
my life to fit, but have always wondered how people with long or hyphenated <br/>
names cope with that. Do they just fill in what fits and end up with an <br/>
abbreviated name on their important documents and mail? Are there special forms or <br/>
exemptions for those situations? Some day I&#39;ll find out those answers...  <br/>

<h4>Pam Sorooshian</h4>
<p><small><time>15 Aug 2005, at 11:28am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-148188477">My name is Pamela Sorooshian-Tafti. Usually they seem to run it  <br/>
together as: Sorooshiantafti.<br/>
<br/>
The whole last name was my husband&#39;s - it would have been Sorooshian- <br/>
Tafti-Kerwin if I&#39;d added my own last name to it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Taft is the name of the town in Iran where my husband came from.  <br/>
Taft-&quot;i&quot; just means &quot;from Taft.&quot; So really it is his name and address  <br/>
all in one! But it was translated to English, from his passport and  <br/>
entry papers, as if it was his full name, so he was stuck with it.  <br/>
Then we got married and you just don&#39;t want to be fooling around with  <br/>
name differences when immigration (INS) is already suspicious of all  <br/>
Iranian marriages - that they might be fake in order to get permanent  <br/>
residency status.<br/>
<br/>
I totally IGNORE little boxes or too-short lines/spaces to write in,  <br/>
on forms. I write right over the boxes and I use other spaces and  <br/>
cross out what it asks for - lots of forms have a second extra space  <br/>
for address, I just write in that, too.<br/>

I took a typing class in summer school the year I turned 15.   Paid money for <br/>
that class.   It involved all those things no one needs to know now.   How to <br/>
clean a typewriter with a toothpick (or needle), a brush, a cloth and some <br/>
alcohol; how to justify margins (involves typing the whole thing once with //// <br/>
until the carriage return stops you, and then re-typing it using the <br/>
halfspace--oh yeah, they had halfspaces) and so forth.   At the end of the summer I <br/>
could type 42 words per minute and we had done a portrait of JFK by typing what <br/>
the teacher called out (space space space space dollar sign dollar sign dollar <br/>
sign...) for about 120 lines.<br/>
<br/>
So I learned to type in school.   Kind of.   <br/>
And I got fast by typing newsletters and letters and song lyrics and handouts <br/>
when I was teaching and made my own materials instead of using the textbook, <br/>
and word-search puzzles for kids at school and later for my own kids (until I <br/>
found a Macintosh program that would just make them) and gradually learned to <br/>
use computers by taking part-time word-processing jobs, and never stopped <br/>
&quot;learning to type&quot; once I started.<br/>
<br/>
Only thing is, my kids could &quot;keyboard&quot; (sounds like it should need elbow and <br/>
kneepads and be one at the skate park) before they knew what it was, and are <br/>
quick and at home with computers.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe early facility with a computer takes unschooling. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
A friend of Holly&#39;s is going to a charter school this year.   Mornings are <br/>
group projects (like the family school, we were told, which might mean something <br/>
to locals here) and afternoons are computers.    Computer *what* I don&#39;t <br/>
know, and I partly suspect computer coursework, but there it is.   Something for <br/>
people to learn at school when others tell them it&#39;s time.<br/>

Except my kids, who happen to be older than yours, had  computers in school <br/>
before we had one at home.  I used them at work,  and taught people how to <br/>
&quot;word process&quot; &lt;g&gt;, and when we got the home  computer, all of us knew how to use <br/>
it.<br/>
 <br/>
(1991 when we got our first PC--but my husband had a Commodore  when he was <br/>
in high school that is still sitting in my fil&#39;s living room--and I  got an <br/>
electric typewriter for my birthday when I was 12).  <br/>
 <br/>
The bottom line is exposure and access.<br/>

<br/>
I got my first secretary job in 1984 as a temp. I tested at 35 words a<br/>
minute on a typewriter. :) When I switched to a computer (Kay-Pro 64)<br/>
in the dark ages, I got my speed and accuracy up to over 65 words per<br/>
minute in less than a month by typing every day eight hours a day and<br/>
not having that danged carriage return to hit all the time. Plus, that<br/>
letter &quot;a&quot; key gave me fits with my small hands on a typewriter. On a<br/>
keyboard, I flew!<br/>
<br/>
Once they added taperecorders with headsets for the letters dictated<br/>
to us (rather than reading handwritten notes on a stand next to the<br/>
computer) my speed increased again.<br/>
<br/>
Today, who knows how fast I type? It is irrelevant. But it is also<br/>
very fast.<br/>
<br/>
My husband worried that my daughter might not have learned to type<br/>
correctly using a program (you know for accuracy and using all the<br/>
fingers). He was about to mention it to her one day when he actually<br/>
listened to her typing. He turned to me and burst out laughing. &quot;She&#39;s<br/>
fast with those four fingers!&quot; We&#39;ve never looked back. All five kids<br/>
keyboard and never took a course.<br/>
<br/>
One funny.<br/>
<br/>
A Kay_Pro 64 was so named because it had this astounding amount of<br/>
memory for its day - 64 K. :)<br/>

 It had a steel case, and the keyboard was the lid.   When it was open, I <br/>
think the screen/bigger box leaned on the edge of the screen (or on the handle or <br/>
something and the keyboard was in front.   Then you could fold it shut and <br/>
latch it (with big steel latches) and carry it around.<br/>
<br/>
I had a daisy wheel printer with three different wheels.   If you wanted to <br/>
change fonts in a document you could put a printer pause mark, I think, and it <br/>
would wait for you to change wheels, then resume, then pause, so you could <br/>
change wheels again (Like, for example, to put in italics.)   For boldface, it <br/>
went back and typed twice (like a typewriter, I think).<br/>
