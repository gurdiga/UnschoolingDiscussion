 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel the same way you do when reading those books. Maybe that&#39;s why I enjoy going back to Mankato (Deep Valley) so much because I imagine a more gentle society.<br>

Bar none, these were my favorite books to read to my daughters when they were little. They truly capture what it is (was?) like to be a child and my girls sat mesmerized as we read. Someday I&#39;ll get to read them to my grandchildren.... &nbsp;<br>

It makes me ache to think how different society is today than it was then. <br>
