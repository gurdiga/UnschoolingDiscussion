<div id="ygrps-yiv-969378137">The other night Tara and I were talking about when she was little and all the things we remember happening that were funny. Like her getting her finger stuck in a whiffle ball, which wasn&#39;t really so funny then!<br/>
She had so many memories about her hermit crabs. I knew she loved them. She had many for years but I never realized how much she actually played with them and enjoyed them. So since we were off the next day to return our tadpole frogs to the park, why not fill the critter keeper with something else?<br/>
<br/>
We ended up at Petsmart and naturally I had to get a new 10 gal. tank as the critter keeper wasn&#39;t large enough to my liking. I still had wood and rocks and even shells leftover from the crabs Tara had. The kids each picked out a crab and named it. Joseph has a big one named Spike, Sierra has a medium one named Cutie and Alyssa has a wee little baby one named Brock. (not sure where that name came from!)<br/>
<br/>
We have been so involved in crabs ever since. On the internet and in books and mainly just watching them crawl around. The kids are building all kinds of homes out of Lego&#39;s, wood and foam blocks. Even going as far at to decorate them. This morning they set their alarm clocks so they could get started on a race track complete with obstacles. We spent the better part of the morning racing crabs!!!<br/>
<br/>
This is the first time Joseph showed interest in any critters we have had here. I would imagine we will all have wonderful crab memories to talk about when the kids are older. Thanks to Tara really.<br/>
<br/>
Now if only I would have imagined how enthralling these critters would have been a year ago, we could have saved us the trouble of dealing with this incorrigible Beagle we have!!!!!<br/>

LOL!! Yeah Ren,. that&#39;s what Joseph said too. She doesn&#39;t even watch Pokemon<br/>
but I think she may have heard the kids talking. It was just so funny to<br/>
hear her say that when I asked what she wanted to name her crab. When Joseph<br/>
was that age, eveything was named John. For Sierra at that age, everything<br/>
was named Kelly. (hence the incorrigible Beagle!) This little whipper<br/>
snapper is altogether different!<br/>
