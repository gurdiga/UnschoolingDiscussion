<div id="ygrps-yiv-864714230">I&#39;m new to this list, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve posted an Intro yet.  My dh<br/>
and I have a daughter who is 4-3/4.  I&#39;ve always planned on homeschooling,<br/>
and then when I read John Holt I was convinced that what I really wanted to<br/>
do was unschool (this is what *I* really wanted as a kid.) <br/>
<br/>
We live rurally with *very* few homeschoolers nearby, and we&#39;re now<br/>
starting to run into frustrations with all her friends being in school<br/>
during the day.  This is a tough one, because my dd is very social and<br/>
loves to play with other kids.  She gets lonely, and at times I really<br/>
don&#39;t have any ideas to solve this problem.  What do other families with<br/>
only one outgoing child do??<br/>
<br/>
I plan to be part of our school&#39;s homeschool program when my dd turns 5 so<br/>
that we can participate in some of the school things if we want to (like<br/>
after school art classes, plays, etc.)  The homeschool coordinator is<br/>
great; when I met her 2-3 years ago she introduced me to John Holt and the<br/>
whole idea of unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
So far it&#39;s been easy to unschool.  We live our lives, my dd helps when she<br/>
wants to, she is almost always with me, and we find lots to do.  She<br/>
currently has gymnastics, music, and dance classes.  These classes were<br/>
originally my idea starting about 2 years ago, but I never had any<br/>
expectations that we had to stay and finish them -- it was just<br/>
exploration.  Now she wants to be in all of them, and has even asked for<br/>
more (ballet, art, flute, and swimming!!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So here is our reading situation.  My dd has told me numerous times that<br/>
she wants to learn to read.  I&#39;m starting to take this as a request from<br/>
her for me to help.  Even though she is in several classes, none of them<br/>
&quot;teach&quot;, so I don&#39;t think she has the notion to ask me to &quot;teach&quot; her; in<br/>
fact, I expect that for her a teacher is someone who gives you fun<br/>
resources to play and explore with.  So, since she wants to learn to read I<br/>
could give her fun resources to play and explore with.  But, I am at a<br/>
total loss as to what this would look like!!  I must admit that I did have<br/>
an image that she would just pick up a book one day and magically start to<br/>
read it, perhaps after asking a few questions.  My dh taught himself to<br/>
read at a very early age, and I was the kind of kid who, if I had not been<br/>
in school, wouldn&#39;t have been bothered to read until a very late age - and<br/>
then would have been reading voraciously overnight.  She seems to be<br/>
somewhere in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have an understanding of what works better for her.  She seems to<br/>
be a sight word reader, learning whole words.  I don&#39;t think she&#39;d be that<br/>
keen on phonics.  On the other hand, she loves sounds and often recognizes<br/>
words because of some of the letters/sounds she sees (like &quot;it must be open<br/>
because there is a P in the sign&quot;) - so what do I really know.  Perhaps<br/>
she&#39;s just learned the words she knows because of sight and context and<br/>
phonics would fill in some missing pieces for her.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice?  Do I get a reading workbook to see if she likes that?  Do I<br/>
try phonics in some fun way to check this out?  My initial reaction is to<br/>
avoid anything like this...  that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing for over a year<br/>
now.  But she continues to bring up the desire to read, even more so<br/>
recently.  I don&#39;t want to ignore her request, even if it isn&#39;t explicit.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong... I am not in a hurry.  If she didn&#39;t start reading<br/>
until she was 12 (or whatever) that would be fine with me.  I love reading<br/>
stories out loud; we love to listen to books on tape together.  What I<br/>
don&#39;t want to do is miss her request for some specific resource to help her<br/>
explore.  If she were older and had more experience/exposure I expect she&#39;d<br/>
be able to say &quot;Mom, I want to know all about whats-it, could you find me<br/>
some things to help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really starting to ramble now, but I just thought about our experience<br/>
with art.  We collect all sorts of stuff from art stores, crafts stores,<br/>
nature, even the trash.  We have so many boxes and cupboards full of art<br/>
materials to explore.  There is no right or wrong way to explore the paint,<br/>
glue, glitter, stencils, pens, paper, beads, feathers, pine cones,<br/>
acorns... oh you get the idea.  She creates art, and loves it.<br/>
<br/>
So other than reading lots of stories, or seeing signs around us when we&#39;re<br/>
out and about in towns -- what do we do to have lots of stuff around to<br/>
help with the exploration of reading?  Like with the art, there must be<br/>
lots of ways to explore reading (I just can&#39;t think of any - LOL!)  On the<br/>
other hand, it isn&#39;t anything like art in that you can&#39;t really do it until<br/>
you have some additional knowledge.  Like telling time... it doesn&#39;t make<br/>
sense until all of a sudden - click; then there is some knowledge and now<br/>
you can do it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, sorry for the rambling.  It is helpful to put my thoughts down in an<br/>
email; thanks for reading ;-)  I&#39;m glad to be part of the list and<br/>
connected with others who know what unschooling is and don&#39;t ask me the<br/>
&quot;socialization&quot; question!  I look forward to learning more about what<br/>
unschooling looks like in your lives, and seeing it unfold for us in ours.<br/>

Hi, Barb:<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter was younger we would sit down together and choose <br/>
which of her interests she wanted to investigate more.  Then we would <br/>
let it be known through our homeschool support groups that we were <br/>
organizing a club based on her interests.  At various times she had a <br/>
doll club, a board games club, a chess club, a writing club, a fossil <br/>
club, a sewing club, a baking club, a book club, a drama club, and <br/>
many more.  We would list the information letting folks know when and <br/>
where we would be meeting and usually attracted a small group of <br/>
other homeschoolers who would join her for an hour or two of great <br/>
socializing.  <br/>
<br/>
We would also meet at local parks for play days, and I also would <br/>
help organize classes for home educators for some of her special <br/>
interests, like: gymnastics, horseback riding, figure skating, <br/>
ceramics, art.  And I was always finding and taking advantage of <br/>
things that she liked to do that already had programs for home <br/>
educators, like:  nature programs, craft programs, museum programs, <br/>
zoo programs, music programs, theatre programs, aquarium programs, <br/>
history programs, Native Anmerican programs, other animal programs <br/>
(local shelters, farms, dairies).<br/>
<br/>
She is 16 now and believe me, she has no problem socializing!  As a <br/>
matter of fact she is the one who is always organizing activities for <br/>
everyone else.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-416321721">Sounds like you&#39;re already on the reading road. One of the things my <br/>
son gobbled up was a phonics workbook that had stickers in it. It was <br/>
totally fun to him and he saw it in the book section of Kmart. So see <br/>
if she is interested in some books like that. They&#39;re fun and if she <br/>
likes them and wants to do them she is directing herself. Try to find <br/>
reading games too. Playing games is the other thing that got us <br/>
started. Sara</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943246175">When my kids were learning to read they loved books with just one or two <br/>
words on a page--very early toddler books and &quot;word&quot; books. They would <br/>
also ask me to show where it said a particular word or phrase when I was <br/>
reading to them.  For months my dd wanted me to follow along with my <br/>
finger when I read to her--still does sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
They also had a book with just pictures of signs they loved--again only <br/>
about one word at a time.<br/>

Some--or none--of these may work for you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245270886">I haven&#39;t read anyone elses posts, yet.  Sorry if this is redundant.<br/>
Things we do for a curious about reading, non reader.<br/>
<br/>
We have lots of software like Reader Rabbit.  They like to play these <br/>
every once in a while.<br/>
<br/>
Gameing systems (Game Boy, play station....)require reading in lots <br/>
of the games. <br/>
If they like the game, they need help with the reading at first, but <br/>
in my experience, they eventually stop asking for help and are <br/>
figuring it out for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Reading easy readers over and over, til they can do it themselves.<br/>
Go Dog Go is my favorite.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had my 6yo tell me a story.<br/>
I wrote it down in his exact words in a little book we made by <br/>
folding paper.  He drew pictures for it.  He could &quot;read it&quot; <br/>
immediately.<br/>
<br/>
We play  question games in the car.  My older dd likes to be <br/>
challenged with spelling words (cause she is good at it).  My little <br/>
ones get questions like &quot;what does duck start with&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My ds 6 wanted to learn words to write.<br/>
His first words were his name, then Dragon, Zorro, and poop.<br/>
He wrote them all the time!<br/>
He hasn&#39;t asked for more, but I do know he knows,  yes, no, Enter, <br/>
Quit, Play, Stop, Exit....<br/>
<br/>
We have workbooks in a basket here.  They rarely look at them after <br/>
they have looked at them origianlly.  <br/>
I picked up a Pokemon workbook at the thrift store yesterday.  <br/>
I&#39;m betting Jack will ask for help with it a few times then forget <br/>
about it.<br/>
I suggest the workbooks when they want some one on one time, <br/>
occasionally.  But I also suggest board games, cooking, reading, <br/>
playing catch......<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is off limits here, even if it looks like school.  It&#39;s just <br/>
not put in higher ranking if it does happen to look like school.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; what do we do to have lots of stuff around to<br/>
help with the exploration of reading?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here are some things we did which were just games, not &quot;lessons,&quot; and I <br/>
discontinued at the last sign of boredom or distraction, usually going to something <br/>
MORE fun.<br/>
<br/>
Ah.  Before the reading stories, that might be a good point to make.  If <br/>
you&#39;re &quot;doing  math&quot; or something with a child because they asked and you&#39;ve come <br/>
up with something, be prepared to bail.  And instead of bailing from something <br/>
to nothing, or seeming to quit, or worst of all, blaming them for the end of <br/>
the interaction (like &quot;Fine, I guess you&#39;re not that interested after all&quot; or <br/>
something that leaves a bad taste and less desire to try again later), go to <br/>
something better.   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s go to the park!&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
&quot;Are you hungry?&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
&quot;Do you want to play cards?&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s time for Simpson&#39;s!&quot; <br/>
or something.<br/>
<br/>
Some games we&#39;ve done, for two minutes or half an hour sometimes:<br/>
<br/>
mixing up labels, with sticky notes.  <br/>
<br/>
I would label 15 things or so (12 to 20ish) with little stick-it notes, all <br/>
in one room, like<br/>
chair<br/>
table<br/>
wall<br/>
bowl<br/>
lamp<br/>
book<br/>
couch (ours had wooden arms the note would stick to)<br/>
duck (or whatever toy is in there could be named)<br/>
box<br/>
<br/>
and then mix them up, with the kid who&#39;s playing out of the room, and call <br/>
him back in.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they did it in groups, sometimes they took turns, sometimes an <br/>
older kid who could read better gave clues.<br/>
<br/>
Usually they went just by initial sound.<br/>
<br/>
They couldn&#39;t &quot;lose&quot; or be wrong, it just might take longer.<br/>
<br/>
We had flashcards of various sorts, given to us, found at thrift stores, and <br/>
have a set of little plastic word cards which were part of some school reading <br/>
program probably in the 60&#39;s.   Sometimes when a kid said &quot;I want to learn to <br/>
read&quot; I would go through some pack of word cards and lay some out I thought <br/>
she might be able to read (this was mostly a Holly game) and lay some out and <br/>
ask if she recognized any of those.  Sometimes she was too frustrated to do <br/>
much so I&#39;d just look for some I knew she DID know, and sometimes she was really <br/>
interested, or I&#39;d find similar words (silent e on the end or starting with <br/>
&quot;ch&quot;) and tell her what they had in common.   Those sessions never lasted very <br/>
long.<br/>
<br/>
When she did feel she could read well, we did one set of cards one whole time <br/>
through and then gave them to the thrift store.  That was a kind of <br/>
graduation moment for her, seeing that a set of cards designed to help learn to read <br/>
were too easy for her now.<br/>
<br/>
We just used them as toys, though, not any more seriously than we would guess <br/>
what hand a quarter was in, or care about who won a rummy game or could swing <br/>
higher.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I would list all their friends names and they could see which ones <br/>
they could read, and puzzle out the rest by elimination.  Sometimes cartoon <br/>
characters or the names of their friends&#39; dogs or last names of families we knew.<br/>
<br/>
We still find parts of home-made word-strip things, with a piece of cardboard <br/>
and a strip of paper with letters that can be pulled through to change one <br/>
letter in a word, like <br/>
_ A T  <br/>
with two slit-holes in the cardboard to pull through a strip of paper that <br/>
had letters which would make a word of _AT<br/>
like <br/>
B<br/>
C<br/>
F<br/>
H<br/>
M<br/>
P<br/>
and maybe some blends at the end<br/>
FL<br/>
DR<br/>
but not too many<br/>
<br/>
Keep it light and fun and don&#39;t count on it to do anything more than give <br/>
them a little more confidence and a few more clues, because confidence and clues <br/>
are all they need.<br/>

You mean (I think) that the game will speak the questions aloud to the player.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323021273">Thank you everyone, this is just the sort of thing that I needed, some<br/>
ideas that will be fun to try, and confirmation that I&#39;m on the right path.<br/>
<br/>
Also, with your ideas I am seeing that yes I am in fact giving her<br/>
resources and fun games to help her when she needs it.  We&#39;ve actually done<br/>
many of the ideas that you have all suggested!!  She can read many books<br/>
from memory, and just loves to read aloud to us, we play various word games<br/>
in the car (our favorite is &quot;I&#39;m thinking of a word that starts with the<br/>
letter ___&quot; and then the other person gets to ask questions to guess the<br/>
word), I&#39;ve helped her write words that she wants to do, we spell things on<br/>
the refrigerator all the time, and a few weeks ago she produced her own ABC<br/>
book; she wrote each letter, then drew a picture of something starting with<br/>
that letter, and then asked me how to spell each word and wrote most of<br/>
them.  She asked for some help with a few things, and at one point we took<br/>
a break to look at abstract art because she was getting a little frustrated<br/>
that some of her drawings weren&#39;t &quot;perfect&quot;.  Yes indeed, we are well on<br/>
our way.  It&#39;s so funny that it&#39;s possible to lose sight of this.<br/>
<br/>
I think I just interpreted her continual requests to mean that I wasn&#39;t<br/>
helping her.  Today, after reading your posts I see her requests as meaning<br/>
that she wants more, or perhaps she is asking for another new challenge.<br/>
She&#39;s soaked up all the fun reading stuff we&#39;ve done so far and wants<br/>
something new.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once again thanks!  And if anyone has any more ideas about additional fun<br/>
reading challenges I&#39;d love to hear them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ciao<br/>

Another thing about reading is that the child in the original post *is*<br/>
starting to read.  I think it&#39;s good to point that out, something I didn&#39;t<br/>
do with my son and wish I had.  I still considered him a non-reader when he<br/>

Yikes!! I lost this whole message in a freak power glitch on a nice, sunny day. This is me having taken a few deep breaths and rewriting (I thought Outlook would have saved my draft every 5 mins .. aaarrrgh, not).  So ....<br/>
<br/>
A couple of nights ago my 6yo son leaned over while we were laying bed together and said &quot;I really want to learn how to read but only if I don&#39;t have to go to school.&quot;  I assured him he didn&#39;t and that he could learn it on his own.<br/>
<br/>
All the suggestions int his thread have been great!!  I think though, that the advice above is really important.  Even when they express an interest, don&#39;t get invested in the idea that they will be &quot;reading&quot; soon or it will just become an experience in frustration for everyone involved.  Keep it light and fun and interesting for them.<br/>
<br/>
Since Michael mentioned this I have been paying extra attention to the reading connections around us.  If we come across a short word or two I sound them out for him (no more than 10-15 seconds) - this is something he used to ask me not to do but he doesn&#39;t seem to mind now.  I point out words I know he already recognizes (from his games and interests - play, exit, scooby-doo, on, off etc.).  I&#39;ll probably install and reading computer game or two and start them up to see if he&#39;s interested, or not.  I&#39;ll ask regularly if he&#39;d like to read a book together - we used to read Scooby-Doo books every night but lately he wants to watch the show instead.  I&#39;ll make a point of playing video games with him more often so I can read more of those words, so that even though he&#39;s figured out how to play them on his own, I can bring out more of the storyline, if he&#39;s so inclined.  We do have fun playing with rhyming words - we take turns coming up with words that rhyme until we run out of them and start making up new ones.  I can transfer that game to reading like Sandra mentioned with her __ AT example.  Find what they already enjoy and extend the reading component for them, but only while it&#39;s fun.<br/>
<br/>
Just this morning he was playing on the Scooby-Doo website and I pointed out to him the words he had read - &quot;play&quot; and &quot;exit&quot; (I could tell he had read them by what he was doing and what he was asking me help with).  For one game he was typing in a question and he asked me how to spell the words.  I sounded out the shorter words, and the longer ones that made sense, as I was spelling and he didn&#39;t object.<br/>
<br/>
And later this morning when I was walking to the mailbox I thought up a game he might like.  I&#39;ll write down the words he already knows along with some other words that he/we could sound out or recognize easily on separate pieces of paper and we could mix them up to create and read &quot;silly sentences&quot;.  He seems to like that kind of stuff.  Or maybe not.  We&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
Just keep your eyes open for connections with their everyday life and interests.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and one other thing.  Don&#39;t tell them there are things they can&#39;t do until they learn to read.  It&#39;s amazing what they will figure out on their own without reading (I remember Sandra&#39;s computer game story along these lines).  For example, my daughter got the Harry Potter Clue game for her birthday this past spring (it&#39;s jsut like the old Clue game but set at Hogwarts with Harry Poter characters etc).  When we first played I played with Michael so I could read the cards and mark down the clues.  When a few weeks ago he wanted to play on his own, I said sure.  I didn&#39;t tell he couldn&#39;t play because he doesn&#39;t read yet.  Though in the back of my mind I was wondering how I could allow him to win once in a while so he didn&#39;t get discouraged.  I needn&#39;t have worried!  He had the cards and the board memorized.  He makes meaningful guesses and remembers the clues all on his own.  It&#39;s just amazing watching him search his mind to remember all the info when he gets to Fluffy to make his guess.  Soemtimes he&#39;ll ask me to read out all the spells so he can sort out in his mind which one hasn&#39;t been played, and he always figures it out on his own.  We play together quite often and he wins regularly ... definitely more often than I do!<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a great point, Tia.<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned in my previous post, I do point out to my son the words he does read and understand now that he&#39;s interested, mostly I think because this was (and still is in a way) a big issue with my 9yo daughter.  She came home and we started unschooling in the middle of grade 2 and she was convinced she couldn&#39;t read and that it was too difficult.  I didn&#39;t push it at all, just dropped it altogether and we all got into the Harry Potter series, she especially, and I read aloud regularly for the next year.  <br/>
<br/>
I eventually came to realize that her definition of being able to read was to be able to sit down and read a large chapter book (like Harry Potter).  And she disliked the early readers and such intensely.  She would tell anyone and everyone who mentioned it that she couldn&#39;t read, and nothing I said would convince her otherwise.  I occasionally pointed out to her that she could read quite a few words and that she just hadn&#39;t met them all yet.  I mentioned that I was still coming across new words, nobody knows them all!  I told that if she was interested in reading a book herself, she could just ask me any words she came across that she didn&#39;t know yet and I&#39;d tell her.  No thanks, was her reply.<br/>
<br/>
After a few more months I noticed that she was reading signs while we were driving, commercial stuff on TV etc that she wasn&#39;t before.  I just continued to point this out to her every so often.  Lo and behold about a month ago she was chatting/teasing with her older brother about something and I heard her say &quot;I can read, you know!&quot;.  Woohoo!!!  It may not seem like much, but I feel like she has turned a corner.  It&#39;s no longer about her &quot;being a reader&quot;, it&#39;s about her being interested in reading.  And I didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; anything except occasionally point out to her what reading she was already doing.<br/>
<br/>
After me reading Harry Potter aloud very regularly over the past year (books 1-4 four times each, and #5 once), we have gotten them on CD and she is listening to them often (she just spent the last 3 days in her room listening to book 5 again .. she loves when I bring food & drinks up to her).  I know she loves a good story.  And although she hasn&#39;t ventured to pick up a book on her own yet, I know now it&#39;s just a matter of time and finding something interesting enough.  <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm ... maybe the Puppy Patrol pack in the book orders this month, I&#39;ll have to mention it to her (she loves dogs and is eager to volunteer at our local humane society shelter walking and feeding the animals - another thing for me to follow up on!).  Or poetry, she seems to really enjoy the one book of young kids poetry she has ...<br/>

I scrapbook and have lots of supplies. I don&#39;t know how many of you who do <br/>
this, but one of the things I made for my kids were ABC scrapbooks. I went <br/>
through pictures and picked out things that went with each letter and made a page <br/>
for each. I had trouble with some letters, but for example, the letter Z, I <br/>
made a page for Jack about his friend Zack. For the letter Q I had pictures of <br/>
the kids with their Uncle Will at the races and labeled it Quickly. Both kids <br/>
still have their books, and look through them often. Two years ago I made Jack <br/>
some more books on this theme. He went through pictures and I made pages based <br/>
on what he told me about the ones he had picked. He loves his picture books, <br/>
and reads through them all the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-909055464">** So, since she wants to learn to read I<br/>
could give her fun resources to play and explore with.  But, I am at a<br/>
total loss as to what this would look like!!**<br/>
<br/>
One reading resource that we had a lot of fun with when my son was at <br/>
this stage is the PBS TV show Between the Lions.  It takes several <br/>
approaches to literacy that I think are worthwhile.  (If you don&#39;t like <br/>
TV or puppets, then ignore this message. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
