 </span></blockquote>My dh spends time every eveing with the kids. They clean up the ktichen after dinner, they <br/>
play cards or X box, they play a game called Black Panther where one hides upstairs and <br/>
the others have to find the black panther in the dark and there is lots of big screaming. :)<br/>
<br/>
For years, my husband would send me to the library once a week alone for several hours <br/>
so I could have somepeace and quiet.<br/>
<br/>
Today, I&#39;m back to doing that now that I&#39;m in grad school and he spendes that time with <br/>
the kids - going to their games or driving to activities.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - What things do they do with their kids?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Watch them! Ask them what they like to do. It doesn&#39;t matter so much what they&#39;re good at <br/>
as what they&#39;re interested in.<br/>

<br/>
My husband isn&#39;t on this list but I think I can fairly respond for him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How much time, on average, do the fathers out there in this<br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion group spend with their kids?<br/>
What things do they do with their kids?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband works at home so various times during the day he is able to stop<br/>
and spend some time with the children. Sometimes to play on the playstation<br/>
with them, go outside and throw and bat some balls, or just chase them<br/>
around the house for ahwile. Sometimes just to talk and watch what they are<br/>
doing. In the evening he gets the 3 younger ones ready for bed by taking<br/>
care of the showers and snacks for them. There&#39;s also evening time to watch<br/>
tv together, take walks or scooter rides, read books, play games and just<br/>
talk. His time may not be for long periods with them, but he finds a lot of<br/>
time during the course of the days to connect. There is also YuGiOh<br/>
tournaments and baseball games that our son is involved in. Every outting on<br/>
the weekend my husbands always comes along and sometimes during the week too<br/>
when we have certain field trips with my group. He also makes a point to try<br/>
and take some one on one time with each one. Even if it&#39;s just taking one of<br/>
them along to run errands.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How do you discover what your kids are good at?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By doing everything that my husband does, it&#39;s rather easy to see what<br/>
direction the children are going in and what their likes and dislikes are.<br/>
Just by being with them on a regular basis, he sees.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How do you support your wife?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My husband supports me a great deal. Just by spending time with the children<br/>
and helping out with them means a lot to me. When we have somewhere to go,<br/>
he&#39;s here to help with breakfast and such. He&#39;s also a great support of<br/>
SAHM. He&#39;s the first one to say what a great job I do and how hard it is to<br/>
others who may not seem so understanding. His verbal defence in public means<br/>
a lot to me. He&#39;s also very confident about the decisions I make concerning<br/>
the children on a daily basis. He trusts my decisions and supports me 100%.<br/>
He also calls me on some things like me having a frustration day and not<br/>
being so joyful. I appreciate that and he&#39;ll come and take over and let my<br/>
&quot;moment&quot; pass without taking it out on the kids. We both do that for each<br/>
other and it helps so much with our parenting. I have a great guy.<br/>

~~~<br/>
 <br/>
The unschooling dad in our house spends every waking moment that he&#39;s not  at <br/>
work with our kid (and me).  Sometimes he&#39;s with our kid at work,  too!  <br/>
 <br/>
Dads should do the same things with their kids as the moms do.  Like  <br/>
changing diapers and refilling the sippy cups and folding the towels.  And  then dads <br/>
should do the things with their kids that dads do, like  &quot;wrestle-fighting&quot; <br/>
and changing the oil in the van and watching a football  game.  Just like when <br/>
mom weeds the flower bed, drives them all to  the park, or cleans out the car.<br/>
 <br/>
Live in relationship with your kids.  Forge your own relationship with  them <br/>
that is not dependent on or filtered through mom.  Don&#39;t ask her  permission <br/>
to hold the toddler against the ceiling over your head.  Be  fun, have fun, do <br/>
what they like, do what you like, point out stuff they didn&#39;t  know about <br/>
something that interests them.  Shut up about things that  don&#39;t.  Be your <br/>
authentic self.  Let them get to know you.  Tell  them about the time in high school <br/>
you rolled a giant rock in front of the  school door.  Tell them about the <br/>
fight you had with your brother over a  game of Monopoly.  Let them help you <br/>
write the check to the gas  company.<br/>
 <br/>
Speak up for your wife when she&#39;s not being heard.  Ask her what she  would <br/>
like for you to do.  Do things without being asked.  See the  dirty sock that&#39;s <br/>
been in the corner for 3 days, and pick it up.  Do  the dishes.  Don&#39;t expect <br/>
gratitude for it.  Get the grocery shopping  done.  Buy her favorite brands <br/>
and go by the list.  Help your  kids show gratitude for what she does.  Don&#39;t <br/>
be mean to them.<br/>
 <br/>
Trust your kids to know what they want to do even if they&#39;re not good at  it. <br/>
 Let them try new things even if it&#39;s hard for them and they will never  be <br/>
good at it.  Figure out why you think it&#39;s important to you for them to  be <br/>
good at something.  Recognize that they&#39;re good at being  themselves.  Don&#39;t put <br/>
unjust expectations onto them.  Follow them  along and strew interesting <br/>
things.<br/>
 <br/>
You sound like a good dad.  Trust yourself.  Trust your  children.<br/>

<br/>
There are a couple of lists for dads, linked here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/other">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other</a><br/>
<br/>
But having input from here AND there couldn&#39;t hurt, huh?<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s quite an introvert and needs more time alone than I do.  <br/>
<br/>
When our kids were little we had that age range minus the four year old, more <br/>
or less.  They&#39;re 13, 15 and 18 now.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is Keith.  He used to do a lot of holding the baby, when there was <br/>
a baby, and many times a baby or toddler fell asleep on dad, and then was put <br/>
in the bed.  I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s an unschooling thing, but I also don&#39;t <br/>
know where unschooling ends, and I think it&#39;s gloriously useful if the <br/>
children trust dad to be as safe and reliable as mom.  Some kids are nervous around <br/>
or afraid of their dads, so any soothing, still, quiet kind of dad stuff seems <br/>
a positive to me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-- How much time, on average, do the fathers out there in this <br/>
<br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion group spend with their kids? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Some days Keith spends none.  Some days he gets quite involved with one or <br/>
another, or two, and spends a couple of hours involved.  He and Holly do Celtic <br/>
knotwork together and talk about that, or he&#39;ll show her something he&#39;s <br/>
planning on wood, or she&#39;ll show him something she&#39;s discovered on graph paper.   He <br/>
and Marty like the same kinds of movies, and they watch the dollar movie <br/>
schedule to go together.   Keith&#39;s having a heavy SCA involvement (medieval combat <br/>
stuff, and music, for his part) but I haven&#39;t been going lately, and though <br/>
both the boys have been involved in the combat some, neither is very into it in <br/>
the past year, so they&#39;re missing a potential opportunity, but everyone&#39;s <br/>
calm about it.  I kinda wish the boys were more into it, but I don&#39;t want to <br/>
pressure them because everyone&#39;s happy these days.<br/>
<br/>
-=-How do you discover what your kids are good at?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Just by giving them all kinds of opportunities to catch interests or to try <br/>
things.  And when one does perk up about one thing or another, don&#39;t peg them <br/>
with it and press it.  They might have a big interest in dinosaurs or airplanes <br/>
or horses that plays itself out someday.  They&#39;ll reach satisfied saturation <br/>
and go on to other things.  A kid who LOVES playground equipment might have no <br/>
interest in gymnastics.  And sometimes a kid&#39;s favorite activity might be one <br/>
he&#39;s not noticeably &quot;good at,&quot; but enjoys anyway.  Singing, drawing, <br/>
puzzles... some do those things who aren&#39;t loaded with talent, but they like it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Howard Gardner lists different intelligences (you could google for details) <br/>
in these areas:<br/>
kinesthetic<br/>
musical<br/>
verbal<br/>
spatial<br/>
logic<br/>
interpersonal<br/>
intrapersonal<br/>
nature<br/>
<br/>
I left one out, I think.  Others will fill it in.  I&#39;m expecting a plumber <br/>
any minute or I&#39;d google it myself.<br/>
<br/>
People will have combinations of those, typically, so instead of looking for <br/>
a major or primary talent or interest, assume and aim for finding several!<br/>
<br/>
-=- How do you support your wife?-=-<br/>
<br/>
The best thing my husband used to dofor me was to the kids all away so I <br/>
could take a long shower or do something alone for half an hour or an hour.  He <br/>
could take them to Burger King or just to the store with him, or to a city park <br/>
to throw a ball for the dog, and it seemed like a real, major vacation.  The <br/>
kids thought it was fun too, and got to do something without me, which is good <br/>
in small doses.<br/>
<br/>
With a tiny baby, sleep is good.  <br/>
<br/>
If you can afford to bring prepared foods in more than you would without the <br/>
baby, that would be helpful too.  Seems minor, and seems expensive sometimes, <br/>
but it won&#39;t be for always.  Someday you&#39;ll have four teenagers and they&#39;ll be <br/>
old enough to get their own food, cook for the family, or find their food out <br/>
and about with the money they make from working.   It&#39;s weird, but it happe<br/>
ns. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275570770">I liked Karen&#39;s list a lot.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  Get the grocery shopping  done.  Buy her favorite brands <br/>
and go by the list.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keith &quot;does Costco.&quot;  That&#39;s his main house job, and it&#39;s wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
We keep a list for things from Costco, and another list for stuff not-Costco. <br/>
 He always does Costco (and is willing to go three or four times a week, too, <br/>
because he really enjoys it), and sometimes will do the other store too.   So <br/>
what we write down comes home.  And we can write down the names of new DVDs.  <br/>
That&#39;s fun.  We only do it sometimes.  Aladdin was the last one.     And we <br/>
can write down nuts or candy and he doesn&#39;t ask us why or try to talk us out of <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
He keeps the giant laundry soap in the garage, and we have two <br/>
many-times-reused smaller mismatched laundry soap bottles.  When one is empty, we put it by <br/>
the front door, and it shows back up later that day or the next, refilled.   <br/>
That&#39;s sweet.<br/>
<br/>
From my point of view it&#39;s magic.<br/>
From his point of view, it&#39;s saving money.  <br/>
So we&#39;re both happy.<br/>

The greatest support my dh gives me is by totally getting Unschooling. The<br/>
second thing he does is be acceptant of Jayn and my unusual rotating sleep<br/>
