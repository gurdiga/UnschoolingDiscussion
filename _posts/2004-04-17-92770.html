<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939366661"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How old are you? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>-=-Sandra, you keep asking this. Are you an ageist? I find <br/>
ageism very imcompatible with unschooling. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That was from a post that was bounced (by someone else) but I did want to <br/>
discuss it.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting thought &quot;ageism.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My personal prejudice is against bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known young people who were not louder than they were worth, who knew <br/>
how to qualify their statements even though they were young, and who were aware <br/>
that they would (if they didn&#39;t resist it) get wiser as they got older even <br/>
though they were out of high school, or college graduates.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known more, though, who were wholly cocky.  As soon as they were in a <br/>
position to state their opinions, they did so with embarrassing assuredness to <br/>
anyone who would listen, and without apology if they were cluelessly missing <br/>
the mark they hadn&#39;t even seen.<br/>
<br/>
And so when someone comes to insult the experienced unschoolers here and <br/>
won&#39;t show their hand, it&#39;s not an unreasonable question, I think, to ask if <br/>
they&#39;re just young and stupid.  Because that&#39;s forgiveable.  But older and stupid <br/>
might need different advice.<br/>
<br/>
There.<br/>
<br/>
My prejudices laid out.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think older people are smart just for being older.  Some people never <br/>
analyze much that they&#39;ve seen or done, so they can&#39;t say anything too <br/>
helpful.  Some, though, DO.  And if they were bright and curious to begin with, <br/>
they&#39;ve probably picked up some good insights over the years.<br/>
