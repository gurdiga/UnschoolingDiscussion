&gt; &gt;&gt; So the question I&#39;ll throw out is--Why do some kids act this way?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Sheila<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;    I believe it is b/c when the parent says no the kid knows she/he<br/>
&gt; Also, the eating issue (I really wish S was here to answer this one) My<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand your struggle!  My 3yo dd used to wake up and request ice cream<br/>
for breakfast.  I let her....and went ahead and prepared oatmeal,  scrambled<br/>
eggs,  toast,  grits....whatever else I or someone else was having.  She ate<br/>
ice cream a few times....and at times she&#39;d ask for something else.<br/>
    I did find I had to stay a step ahead of her.  It took an awareness and<br/>
some creative work,   but I realized I could change the environment. For<br/>
instance,  I began making a concerted effort to have a variety of healthy<br/>
alternatives, too - like I&#39;d have prepared a bowl of melon chunks.....or<br/>
made bueberry puree to put over waffles.....even Carnation Instant<br/>
Breakfast,  cereal bars,  etc.  The smell of fresh baked bread or bacon and<br/>
eggs was under my control....and it offered her other things to<br/>
consider....I&#39;ve even had one dd who makes things like turkey sandwiches for<br/>
breakfast...and leftover pizza works well for us!<br/>
     So I left her alone....she did begin choosing other things.  She<br/>
sometimes goes on a streak......for quite awhile,   the only vegetable she&#39;d<br/>
eat was sliced fresh red bell peppers (expensive at times!!);  and she still<br/>
eats peanut butter and honey sandwiches almost daily....sometimes 2 or 3 in<br/>
a day!<br/>
