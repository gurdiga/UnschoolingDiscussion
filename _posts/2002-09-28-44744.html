<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769606972">Wow, what a wonderful magazine.  I just got my first issue and the <br/>
one past issue I requested.  And you were right Ren, Ann&#39;s <br/>
article, &quot;I am what I am&quot; was so good.  It made me cry and hit <br/>
home.  Needless to say, I stayed up until the wee hours reading <br/>
front to back of both issues.  I am so thankful to have this <br/>
resource and the encouraging words of so many people.  The kids <br/>
chose penpals from the bakc of the magazine and they wrote them <br/>
today.  It is so important to make contacts ...networking is a <br/>
must.  Thanks all for the reommendations.<br/>
