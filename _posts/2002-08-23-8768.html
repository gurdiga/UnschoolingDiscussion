&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=Like Traditional Unschooling, Accelerated Unschooling understands that<br/>
&gt;children are best able to determine their interests and talents and gifts.<br/>
&gt;People are naturally drawn to activities and topics that fit their<br/>
&gt;personalities-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Have you read Frank Smith&#39;s _The Book of Learning and Forgetting_?  I <br/>
&gt;really<br/>
&gt;think you&#39;d like it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, but I will look for it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&lt;&lt; Many children and adults<br/>
&gt;have very strong gifts and interests that they&#39;d like to pursue, but <br/>
&gt;limited<br/>
&gt;resources, and, even more, procrastination or laziness keep them from<br/>
&gt;pursuing them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In any unschooling family it&#39;s the parents&#39; part to provide opportunities <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;inspiration.  I&#39;m not really picturing what would &quot;accelerate&quot; it and still<br/>
&gt;keep it in the realm of unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My original question was where are the support groups in various states, or<br/>
&gt;where is this written up on the internet, because I had never heard of it<br/>
&gt;until the other day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thus far I don&#39;t know of any formal support groups. There was a web page <br/>
that the Menapolits maintained, with its own message boards, but it seems to <br/>
be down.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&lt;&lt;Accelerated Unschooling allows the parent to take control of<br/>
&gt;the motivation piece.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Once parents have &quot;taken control&quot; of ANY piece, how is it then still <br/>
&gt;learning<br/>
&gt;at one&#39;s own pace ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;This is especially important for children who are<br/>
&gt;Gifted or Talented, but who often lack motivation. Accelerated Unschooling<br/>
&gt;allows them to reach their potentials.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tell me more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;My personal experience with Accelerated Unschooling has been particularly<br/>
&gt;dramatic. I have fo have begun Accelerated<br/>
&gt;Unschooling, they have excelled in all of their areas of giftedness &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What method were you using before &quot;accelerated unschooling&quot;?<br/>
&gt;Were the children ever in school?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My older children were in school when they were tested, in different areas, <br/>
for giftedness. We were very unhappy with the school&#39;s response, which was <br/>
if they&#39;re gifted, they don&#39;t need any special programming. The children <br/>
were bored and miserable.<br/>
<br/>
We took them out of school and began traditional unschooling. We pictured <br/>
happy children enjoying the resources and time available to them. We didn&#39;t <br/>
pressure them, and offered flexibility and options. This went on for two <br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
Finally my two oldest children came to us in tears. Both were angry that we <br/>
hadn&#39;t pushed them more to make use of their gifts, and demanded to go back <br/>
to school. Both were very unhappy, and felt they had wasted time. <br/>
Coincidentally, two days later I discovered that the workshop was happening, <br/>
and arranged to fly to CA. (SF) I was reluctant to try the approach, because <br/>
it just didn&#39;t seem to fit into the John Holt framework, but my children <br/>
said that if we didn&#39;t try it, they wanted to go back to school -- which I <br/>
KNEW wasn&#39;t good for them.<br/>
<br/>
They bloomed. They started working on things that interested them, they got <br/>
happy... Then a year ago we adopted my youngest son. He was my sister&#39;s son, <br/>
and we hadn&#39;t been in touch for a long time bgecause my sister has drug <br/>
problems and hid from the family. Finally, she was arrested, and asked me to <br/>
take him. She will be in jail for at least seven years. I agreed, IF I could <br/>
legally adopt him. He needed stability so badly.<br/>
<br/>
Nate came to us a boy who alternated between silent and screaming. We&#39;re not <br/>
sure, but we suspect there&#39;s been lots of abuse, and certainly neglect. He <br/>
seems to be thriving with a LOT of structure. When we offered little <br/>
structure, he screamed most of the time. He seems happiest when he is doing <br/>
some activity with one of his siblings. Well, that and watching Pokemon <br/>
videos, which he did for up to fourteen hours a day when he came to us. He <br/>
still watches two-three hours a day, which is fine. I&#39;m hoping soon he won&#39;t <br/>
need that, but he&#39;s still a very hurting little peanut.<br/>
<br/>
I think I just told you far more that you wanted to know about my family!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&lt;&lt;Accelerated Unschooling is becoming more popular. I attended a workshop<br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;its inventors, Conrad and Lydia Menapolit, in California, and it has <br/>
&gt;changed<br/>
&gt;our lives. We are hoping that Conrad and Lydia will be doing more <br/>
&gt;workshops,<br/>
&gt;but they are presently in Austria writing a book about Accelerated<br/>
&gt;Unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When and where was the workshop?  At a conference?<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m really surprised I hadn&#39;t heard about it, so yes, please give me any<br/>
&gt;resources you have so I can understand it, since I get VERY many inquiries<br/>
&gt;from others about unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sandra<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I will try to get you more information soon. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on <br/>
with the website, but I&#39;ll dig out some materials from the mess I call my <br/>
house and find more official sources.<br/>
<br/>
It was nice hearing from you. I hope I haven&#39;t bored you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-851188706">I don&#39;t think there is any such thing as safe<br/>
anonymous snarking.<br/>
<br/>
Nor can one safely DECLARE themselves to be<br/>
unschooling if they aren&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
There is something so OPEN about unschooling...if that<br/>
is what is happening there is just no way to keep it<br/>
secret. Nor is it possible to fake it (like on a<br/>
multiple choice test).  Ya&#39;ll see right though<br/>
everything!! Even artificial sweeteners (flattery and<br/>
such).  Ya&#39;ll even see through the parts that are<br/>
omitted....as evidenced by the types of questions that<br/>
show up whenever absolution for continued wrongness is<br/>
sought. <br/>
<br/>
If a person doesn&#39;t want to be scrutinized they<br/>
shouldn&#39;t DECLARE themselves to be something when they<br/>
don&#39;t know what it is, (or isn&#39;t). And if they don&#39;t<br/>
want to be judged  they should not have children,<br/>
especially unschooled ones!<br/>
<br/>
Actually she sounds like some of my relatives, of this<br/>
generation. One in particular likes to go to<br/>
motivational workshops so he could be motivated to<br/>
pass along motivational comments and tips to motivate<br/>
his children (and friends and relatives) to be<br/>
motivated to do mo&#39;. And so he would be motivated to<br/>
do his motivating with a motivated smile.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t do anything anonymously....make mistakes, skip<br/>
spell check, say stupid stuff.....my name is posted<br/>
with the post. <br/>
<br/>
And all of the time there is a child observing.<br/>
Always. Everything a parent says or does is up for<br/>
scrutiny with unschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
And sometimes while trying to post, that sharp little<br/>
chin rests on my shoulder....and that breathing is<br/>
right in my ear when Roy says....its MY turn, now. But<br/>
he is asleep, and now it is MY turn.....<br/>

than being dumped from school into unschooling without any guidance.<br/>
<br/>
And it sounds like just about anything is a step up from where the youngest<br/>
was. If she was fine with 14 hours of Pokemon and now says he&#39;s down to 2-3<br/>
and she&#39;s fine with that, then it sounds like she&#39;s letting him heal. And if<br/>
he&#39;s been with a druggy mother, maybe it&#39;s healthier to see that he needs<br/>
&quot;remedial&quot; attention -- recognizing that he may be at the level of a typical<br/>
4 yo in emotional response/intelligence for instance, or at the level of a 5<br/>
yo in his understanding of a child&#39;s world -- than assuming he should be<br/>
behaving as a typical 7 yo.<br/>
<br/>
Now if someone came onto an unschooling list promoting this so called<br/>
accelerated unschooling as better than unschooling then it&#39;s open as a<br/>
discussion of ideas. It&#39;s not a place I would direct anyone to and I&#39;d<br/>
certainly have a great deal to say if they asked. But judging someone&#39;s life<br/>
-- who hasn&#39;t asked for opinons -- as not being where it could be ... well,<br/>
it seems to me as long as someone is responding to her kids&#39; unhappiness,<br/>
trying to find something that makes them happier then she&#39;s going to<br/>
continue to grow and create something better for them.<br/>

This is an accessible-by-yahoo list, and accessible by my website.<br/>

I do think the whole accelerated unschooling thing is unfortunate and touches <br/>
on some things I&#39;ve said &#39;eek&#39; about for years, especially the giftedness <br/>
stuff.   But the original bravado seems NOT to be the tip of a big iceberg.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still wondering whether the people did just one single little workshop or <br/>
whether it does have some grassroots basis, and if there were even a hundred <br/>
people, whether it&#39;s something they&#39;ll maintain or whether they&#39;ll fade into <br/>
the general unschooling population.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t ask about sharing the letter.  Since the original question and <br/>
discussion was here, when I got more information I posted it here too.<br/>

&gt; sandra said: I fear dilution.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can you be more specific?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Who does it hurt when people say they&#39;re unschooling but still coerce in<br/>
&gt; some way?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I find myself irritated at people who say they unschool but don&#39;t do it<br/>
&gt; the way I do, it is because I have some ego invested in the hard work of<br/>
&gt; changing my perspective, of deschooling myself. So when I see someone else<br/>
&gt; take credit for that work who hasn&#39;t done it, it bugs the heck out of me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For some reason, I find it irritating to hear someone describe what they do <br/>
as unschooling to someone else looking for answers, if what they do isn&#39;t <br/>
really unschooling. I don&#39;t know why, but I just feel that the (if you want <br/>
to call it a label) idea of unschooling has evolved to mean certain things, <br/>
and it doesn&#39;t include coercion. <br/>
On another list, a lady was telling a newcomer all about her idea of <br/>
unschooling. This included, among other things, her idea that if one of her <br/>
children expressed an interest in a subject or idea, she would make <br/>
worksheets, reading lists, and unit studies. All this was presented as a good <br/>
&quot;child-led&quot; learning experience. I made the mistake of stating that, while I <br/>
felt things like unit studies and reading lists were fine, it wasn&#39;t *true* <br/>
unschooling. And that, if they were eclectic schoolers that was fine but they <br/>
shouldn&#39;t pass it off to others as unschooling. Big heated debate followed <br/>
(many making statements to me that I was putting a label and restrictions on <br/>
unschooling, that I was making it sound like a members only club) with most <br/>
declaring that with unschooling, everything goes. That my way was too <br/>
uncertain, and that what I was doing was tantamount to educational neglect. &gt;<br/>
:(  That it was a parents duty with unschooling to see that if a child was <br/>
interested in something to provide said unit studies and worksheets. <br/>
Another view was expressed that if a child never showed an interest in a <br/>
certain subject and a parent felt that subject was important, then the parent <br/>
should make sure the child learned it as well. Cajoling allowed. I said that <br/>
it was certainly a narrow minded view that children couldn&#39;t be trusted to <br/>
learn anything without boxing things into school like subjects and *making* <br/>
them learn. Needless to say, I was the oddball in that group! &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021988366">Sometimes people hear things from a variety of sources and experiences. <br/>
When I first heard of unschooling it sounded great to me, but when I <br/>
mentioned it to Bill, who had never heard of it, he thought of a friend <br/>
of ours.<br/>
<br/>
She claimed to be homeschooling, but actually her son was being raised <br/>
by the dog and the TV, while she worked and came home. They never did <br/>
anything &quot;educational&quot; it&#39;s true, but as far as we could tell, they <br/>
never did anything else either. They&#39;d never, neither mother nor son, <br/>
been to the library. No Internet access (although this was before it was <br/>
terribly widespread--WWW was just becoming common), no hobbies.<br/>
<br/>
When I started being excited about unschooling, this was the picture <br/>
Bill had. I think it&#39;s what many people think of when they hear the <br/>
term. Sometimes, too, it&#39;s with the expectation that if you totally <br/>
ignore the kid for six months, he&#39;ll suddenly pick up Shakespeare and <br/>
the Algebra book.<br/>

Often this doesn&#39;t succeed. ;-)<br/>

lead people astray.  Textbooks or no textbooks, outside classes or no<br/>
outside classes, etc, aren&#39;t the defining factors for unschooling. You<br/>
could come to our house, notice the Daily Spelling Word on the whiteboard<br/>
written in both cursive and print with room for it to be rewritten below,<br/>
with another list of spelling words on the side, and assume lots of<br/>
things about us. Of couirse, the truth is that the current word has been<br/>
up there for three weeks at least, that the whole spelling thing was<br/>
Rain&#39;s idea and she seems to have lost interest in the whole project, and<br/>
that that&#39;s totally okay, and I&#39;m not going to chase her down and make<br/>
her write &quot;round&quot; 10 times.<br/>
<br/>
If someone believes that children should not be coerced into learning,<br/>
but instead should be supported in learning how and when they wanted, and<br/>
should have a variety of options available, then they&#39;re unschooling.<br/>
There may be textbooks or classes or spelling words on the whitebaord,<br/>
but it&#39;s still unschooling. OTOH, you may have no textbooks at all, but<br/>
require children to write about &quot;anything they chose&quot; for 30 minutes a<br/>
day, to read from anything for an hour, and to do &quot;some kind of math&quot;,<br/>
and you&#39;re not unschooling. It actually is pretty black and white, in my<br/>

&lt;&lt; Still, it seems like a waste of my energy to spend time snarking on people<br/>
who aren&#39;t really hurting me or anyone else.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes their kids are victims.<br/>
<br/>
And if they&#39;re justifying what they do based on our hard perspective-changing <br/>
work, but they don&#39;t really do it, it can come to reflect on the rest of us.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving aside the overly-industrious and non trusting for a moment, just <br/>
imagining a worst-case scenario of neglect.  Let&#39;s say not even &quot;benign <br/>
neglect,&quot; which can be pretty cool for some personalities.  But a bad <br/>
situation in which the parents aren&#39;t protecting their kids from other <br/>
people&#39;s bullying or abuse, in which the child has little access to people, <br/>
places or things, etc., if called &quot;unschooling,&quot; could endanger the rights of <br/>
the rest of us.<br/>
<br/>
So it makes more sense to press for a minimal compliance with attention to <br/>
parenting business.  I think it is possible to be too unconcerned with a <br/>
child&#39;s growth and wellbeing.<br/>
<br/>
Is there then a point (and is it equidistant from the balanced middle, if we <br/>
can imagine a hypothetical such place) at which parents are too concerned <br/>
with a child&#39;s growth and wellbeing?  Where the child&#39;s life is set aside to <br/>
be lived once he has been sufficiently unschooled to the parents&#39; <br/>
satisfaction, and then he can start making his own educational and personal <br/>
decisions?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s what the responses to &quot;accelarated unschooling&quot; are about.<br/>
<br/>
If we think kids need food, safety, shelter, etc., there&#39;s an edge at which <br/>
we might say &quot;not enough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If we think kids need antonomy and freedom, where&#39;s that other edge?<br/>
<br/>
If there is no identifiable good-example range and theory of unschooling, <br/>
then those who say &quot;we unschool history but not science&quot; might as well define <br/>
unschooling as anyone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t really feel threatened so much as I do aggravated or maybe <br/>
frustrated.  I think the whole unschooling thing comes from respecting the <br/>
child as much as an adult would be respected.  When folks say they <br/>
&#39;unschool&#39;, but they don&#39;t grant that kid as much respect as they would <br/>
their best friend, it irks me.<br/>
<br/>
(and this will be an imperfect analogy!)  For instance, say my best friend <br/>
Jan gets interested in Peruvian Bullfrogs (or whatever.)  I might pick up a <br/>
book on Peruvian Bullfrogs at the local bookstore or a video at the library <br/>
and she might enjoy that.  What do you think she&#39;d do if I showed up with <br/>
worksheets to &#39;circle the Peruvian Bullfrog&#39;, sat her down for a lecture on <br/>
Peru (which, after all is where the bullfrog lives) and emphasized the <br/>
economic impact of the Bullfrog on Peruvian immigration...what if I asked <br/>
her to write a paper for me on Peruvian Bullfrogs?  She&#39;d think I was nuts <br/>
and would probably stop being so enthusiastic when I was around.<br/>
<br/>
So, folks who do such things to their kids interests, aren&#39;t really <br/>
respecting them as they would an adult and so, aren&#39;t really <br/>
unschooling...   it&#39;s the blinders folks seem to have when it comes to <br/>
respecting kids that bugs me the most.  The kid&#39;s interested in the subject <br/>
matter, so that&#39;s how I&#39;ll get in the worksheets and report writing that I <br/>
want so much to happen.  He won&#39;t mind because he&#39;s only a kid and after <br/>
all, it *is* based on his interest area...<br/>

Can you be more specific?<br/>
<br/>
Who does it hurt when people say they&#39;re unschooling but still coerce in<br/>

<br/>
When I find myself irritated at people who say they unschool but don&#39;t do it<br/>
the way I do, it is because I have some ego invested in the hard work of<br/>
changing my perspective, of deschooling myself. So when I see someone else<br/>
take credit for that work who hasn&#39;t done it, it bugs the heck out of me.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225517594">&quot;For us, the most valuable aspect of our unschooling is that it is led by<br/>
the interests of my kids. I would say that is the deciding factor - either a<br/>
child&#39;s interests are considered, or they aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
By that definition, we could say that if a child showed an interest in<br/>
whales and the parents then designed a curriculum very whale-intensive<br/>
(considering the interests of the child) and enforced it at the kitchen<br/>
table from 8 to 2 each weekday, it would be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Interest is one thing, but for me unschooling is about choice: who decides<br/>
if to do it and when to do it and how to do it and why to do it and what to<br/>
do in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
(Highly important caveat: this kind of statement often incites people to<br/>
say, &quot;Well, if I just waited around for him to start doing linear algebra<br/>
we&#39;d wait forever!&quot; so I have to add: this doesn&#39;t mean I sit staring at the<br/>
child until she springs up like a performing seal, we just help our<br/>
daughters do what they want, occasionally to often offering things we think<br/>
they MIGHT want, and do that offering without prejudice -- i.e, we take no<br/>
for an answer and don&#39;t take that answer personally. We also -- and here<br/>
perhaps is the radical side of unschooling, or perhaps not -- don&#39;t have an<br/>
agenda. I don&#39;t sit up nights plotting things that will encourage Brit to<br/>
read, or Mikey to engage in arithmetics, or either of them to ground them in<br/>
the fundamentals of science and logic. Such schoolish agenda, however well<br/>
hidden from the children, seems to me -- though not necessarily to all<br/>
unschoolers -- to be contrary to unschooling in the first place.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It seems that for some people, it is also an equally important goal that<br/>
adults not exercise any influence over the learning process,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen an unschooler write this, or say this, or imply<br/>
it. You can&#39;t live with another person without influencing them (and this<br/>
works both ways, parent to child, child to parent, or spouse to spouse for<br/>
that matter). What have you seen written or heard said that makes you<br/>
think/feel this?<br/>
<br/>
I hope I don&#39;t seem to be picking on you -- it&#39;s not my intent. But I find<br/>
it interesting (and sometimes frightening &lt;g&gt;) to see how ideas are<br/>
interpreted and passed on, and I&#39;m curious about the root of the ideas<br/>
you&#39;ve expressed.<br/>

&gt; coerce in<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because it makes the word unschooling meaningless, if we don&#39;t have a<br/>
common definition.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s reminding me of all the threads I&#39;ve read in the past few years trying<br/>
to define attachment parenting. People would define themselves as attachment<br/>
parents bc they do extended bfing and cosleep, but still spank, or still<br/>
circumcise, or still use disposable diapers. No one family does things<br/>
identically, but there are some common denominators. The word certainly<br/>
hasn&#39;t lost meaning because some people interpret it way too loosely.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, with this (absurd, I agree) accelerated unschooling, although the<br/>
children aren&#39;t 100% sovereign, their interests are being considered in ways<br/>
they would not be in school or school-at-home.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just don&#39;t think the whole thing is so fragile. I mean, worst case<br/>
scenario: Tens of thousands of families across the country are calling<br/>
themselves unschoolers yet coercing their children into unit studies. Oh<br/>
no!! I&#39;ll just start calling our home education &quot;fully child-led learning.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It might be that folks like you and I wouldn&#39;t really be hurt by some<br/>
watered down version of unschooling, but there are kids out there who&#39;s<br/>
parent are really struggling to find answers, who really need some way to<br/>
heal the hurt caused by school, or school at home.  <br/>
<br/>
After my father in law had a heart attack his doctor told him to change<br/>
his diet, no more fat, etc.  His wife thought no more fat meant cooking<br/>
the bacon until it was crispy.    Knowing the truth of what a thing is<br/>
makes a real difference.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think watered down or rearranged versions of unschooling can work<br/>
like the real thing can.  I think the string of failures, the  -<br/>
unschooling doesn&#39;t work for my kids - that can and will come from such<br/>
versions can really hurt people who are desperate to find a better way<br/>
for their kids.   What can you choose if school isn&#39;t good and school at<br/>
home didn&#39;t work and now everyone&#39;s saying unschooling can&#39;t work either?<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a vegetarian for thirty years.  I can&#39;t just order the<br/>
vegetarian special at a restaurant because now everybody has a different<br/>
idea of what that word means.  I might get fish, or a cheese omelette or<br/>
something.  So now I&#39;m vegan and I don&#39;t even like that word.   I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be wild about a group of folks coming along and saying vegan<br/>
means what ever you want it to, go ahead and stir fry those grubs, or<br/>
whatever.  No, I wouldn&#39;t be happy at all.  <br/>
<br/>
And, if the local unschoolers organized a kids day at the park, (I&#39;m<br/>
actually the only local (loco?) unschooler, but IF there were others) <br/>
I&#39;d go expecting it to be a fun day of play and adventure.  But if Boris<br/>
and Natasha showed up and decided to accelerate every kid there it&#39;d be a<br/>
real shock, and NOT the fun unschooler&#39;s day I had pictured.  <br/>
<br/>
There are folks coming along the path behind us who&#39;s kids deserve the<br/>
life our kids are having right now and I worry that the wrong information<br/>
about what unschooling is could make all the difference in the world.  <br/>

put in the position of making my kid do something. I don&#39;t want to be the<br/>
enforcer. The only time something like this has come up for us is when<br/>
Rain wanted me to &quot;make her&quot; go to bed at a certain time, so she&#39;s get<br/>
enough rest to do something early the next morning. I wouldn&#39;t agree to<br/>
make her go to sleep, but I did sit down with her and figure out what<br/>
time she&#39;d have to fall asleep so that she would still get 8 hours of<br/>
sleep if she woke on time the next morning, and we came up with a time<br/>
about an hour earlier and set an alarm for that time, and I agreed to be<br/>
available to read to her and rub her back during that hour if she asked.<br/>
Those are the sorts of things I&#39;m willing and happy to do. I don&#39;t think<br/>
it&#39;s so much about valueing noncoercion as it is about not wanting to<br/>
have that role, because once you become the enforcer you&#39;re on the<br/>
opposite side as the child (even if the child put you there) and you<br/>
become someone to outwit, or rebel against, and you also take on the<br/>
responsibility for the completion of the task. I don&#39;t want any of that.<br/>

  It seems that for some people, it is also an equally important goal that<br/>
adults not exercise any influence over the learning process, which seems<br/>
rather impossible Of course, the degree to which we influence, and our<br/>
intentions, are very individual. Clearly, most of us aren&#39;t influencing to<br/>
the point of acceleration :P<br/>
<br/>
  But, there are a million shades of coercion - cajoling, reminding, nudging<br/>
and even the seemingly benign cooperative goal-setting. Personally, I am not<br/>
sure total non-coercion wrt learning is ideal for every kid and family,<br/>
although my kids are still very young and it&#39;s working nicely here.<br/>
Unfooding, unbedding, unruling, and so forth can be a very obvious extension<br/>
of unschooling, but I guess I see the coercion aspect on a spectrum.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think of this as a goal.<br/>
<br/>
My *goal* is for the four people in this house to live happy and fun-filled,<br/>
joy-filled lives.<br/>
<br/>
Not coercing my children (or husband) in matters pertaining to learning is<br/>
just a side effect  of that goal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-644326732">By that definition, we could say that if a child showed an interest in<br/>
  whales and the parents then designed a curriculum very whale-intensive<br/>
<br/>
  You&#39;re right - that would not seem to me like unschooling. However, I<br/>
really wasn&#39;t *defining* unschooling. I&#39;m not interested in doing that. (If<br/>
I were being asked to go speak at conferences, I guess I&#39;d have to pin that<br/>
down ;-)  What I was trying to say is that for me the *greater emphasis* is<br/>
on being interest-led. Now I think I would like to add, also respect. The<br/>
scenario you presented would not be respectful at all; however, I&#39;ve seen<br/>
parents make requirements of kids wrt learning in a way that is much more<br/>
respectful, cooperative and spare.<br/>
<br/>
  Interest is one thing, but for me unschooling is about choice: who decides<br/>
  if to do it and when to do it and how to do it and why to do it and what<br/>
to<br/>
  do in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
  Oh, this is really helping me clarify. Choice is good. For me, I think<br/>
respect is the most important goal. I&#39;ll let someone else define respect.<br/>
<br/>
   &quot;It seems that for some people, it is also an equally important goal that<br/>
  adults not exercise any influence over the learning process,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen an unschooler write this, or say this, or<br/>
imply<br/>
  it. You can&#39;t live with another person without influencing them (and this<br/>
  works both ways, parent to child, child to parent, or spouse to spouse for<br/>
  that matter). What have you seen written or heard said that makes you<br/>
  think/feel this?<br/>
<br/>
  An example I recently heard was a parent whose child practically implored<br/>
them to &quot;make her&quot; follow through with some goal or other, because the child<br/>
knew she was likely to back down from the work when the time came, but truly<br/>
wanted to achieve the overall goal. I can&#39;t remember what the goal was. It<br/>
seemed to me that the parent&#39;s value of noncoercion was greater than her<br/>
desire to help her child learn upon request.<br/>
<br/>
  Perhaps &#39;influence&#39; is the wrong word. Would you agree that it is the goal<br/>
of many unschoolers to never coerce their children in matters pertaining to<br/>
learning? IMO, this influence that we all have over each other is on the<br/>
same spectrum as coercion, and there are many shades of gray between.<br/>
<br/>
  I hope I don&#39;t seem to be picking on you -- it&#39;s not my intent. But I find<br/>
it interesting (and sometimes frightening &lt;g&gt;) to see how ideas are<br/>
interpreted and passed on, and I&#39;m curious about the root of the ideas<br/>
you&#39;ve expressed.<br/>
<br/>
  Oh, no - you don&#39;t seem to be picking on me. In general, this list doesn&#39;t<br/>
give me the feeling that it&#39;s safe to post things in disagreement, so I&#39;m<br/>
pleased to get responses like yours that are thoughtful without the barbs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840967881">I think one of the best reasons to argue/discuss the meaning of <br/>
unschooling is because people (like, perhaps, our accelerated <br/>
friends) will end up saying, oh, we tried traditional unschooling and <br/>
it didn&#39;t work for us.  One can&#39;t even begin to understand what didn&#39;t <br/>
work for them until you understand what they mean when they use <br/>
the term.  I suspect it wasn&#39;t unschooling at all since accelerated <br/>
unschooling seems to have more in common with unit studies than <br/>
unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, at the end of the recent conference someone who had just learned <br/>
about unschooling mentioned that other name by which it is referred <br/>
to, unit studies.  I felt it was important to point out that they are <br/>
not the same thing.  <br/>
<br/>
And another mom I know, who says she is an unschooler, mentioned to me <br/>
back in June that they had finished up a week before public school <br/>
ended and were starting their summer early because she really needed <br/>
the break.  How could we even have a meaningful conversation if we <br/>
didn&#39;t start by coming to an understanding about what our terms mean?<br/>
