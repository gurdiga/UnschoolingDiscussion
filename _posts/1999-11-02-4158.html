<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The following I received off another loop and thought everyone<br/>
here may be<br/>
&gt; interested:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Below you will find a copy of a letter I just emailed to<br/>
Corporate Offices<br/>
&gt; at Toys R Us (I used their website).  I will also be sending it<br/>
to Walmart<br/>
&gt; and over time, any other store I learn of that is carrying this<br/>
so-called<br/>
&gt; &quot;toy.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I learned of this product, (I refuse to call it a toy) from<br/>
yesterday&#39;s<br/>
&gt; editorial section of the Atlanta paper, p. G5.  Words simply<br/>
cannot express<br/>
&gt; the turmoil I feel after reading it.  The authors make a point<br/>
about the<br/>
&gt; connections between the toy and abuse of women, but it really<br/>
doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; matter &quot;what kind&quot; of head it is--it&#39;s violence against *people*<br/>
in the<br/>
&gt; guise of a plaything.  Playing with heads ripped off bodies just<br/>
isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; right.  I could go on and on but at this point would rather keep<br/>
it short.<br/>
&gt; Please read the article, carry copies with you to the stores<br/>
when you shop,<br/>
&gt; speak to managers, email corporates, do what you feel led to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for listening,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To Corporate Officers of Toys R Us:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am writing in response to the article printed in the ATLANTA<br/>
&gt; JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION of Oct. 31, 1999, p. G5 concerning the WWF<br/>
toy &quot;Summer<br/>
&gt; Slam 99.&quot;  This is a product sold by your stores, and marketed<br/>
for children<br/>
&gt; ages 4 and up.  This &quot;toy&quot; includes, along with the two<br/>
wrestlers, a<br/>
&gt; disembodied woman&#39;s head with the words &quot;help me&quot; written on her<br/>
forehead.<br/>
&gt;    Simply put, I am appalled and outraged that anyone would<br/>
distribute such<br/>
&gt; a product in a children&#39;s toy store.  I realize the toy is<br/>
designed to<br/>
&gt; &quot;follow along&quot; with the &quot;story line&quot; of the TV show.  But<br/>
pulling people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; heads off is not children&#39;s play.  As the authors so succintly<br/>
put it,<br/>
&gt; &quot;What meaning are they (the children) supposed to derive from<br/>
this toy?<br/>
&gt; The most obvious conclusion is that the package contains a<br/>
female victim<br/>
&gt; who did not survive her encounter with the muscled figures who<br/>
surround<br/>
&gt; her.&quot;  (I do not even care what kind of victim the head is; be<br/>
whatever<br/>
&gt; sex, gender, race, it is wrong).<br/>
&gt;    I could say more, but words almost fail me.  In the meantime,<br/>
I will no<br/>
&gt; longer shop at Toys R Us until this toy is pulled from your<br/>
shelves.  I<br/>
&gt; will also be forwarding this letter to every friend and email<br/>
list.  We<br/>
&gt; cannot continue to abide by such irresponsible actions for the<br/>
sake of<br/>
&gt; making a dollar.  My children will never see such a toy (or such<br/>
a TV show)<br/>
&gt; much less play with such, but they are harmed as well by having<br/>
to grow up<br/>
&gt; in and live in a world that supports such.  The dollars made<br/>
from such<br/>
&gt; products are at the expense of all our children.<br/>
&gt;    I would appreciate a response.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

I am going to forward this to my lists. I will also go and check our stores <br/>
here in Port Huron, Michigan, and see what is here. I may even consider a <br/>
drop to the local paper. Thanks for the eye opening...<br/>

Linda in FL:)<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
WWF TOY<br/>
    Wal-Mart says it&#39;ll stop selling an action figure based on a World<br/>
Wrestling Federation competitor...following complaints by two Georgia<br/>
woman that the package includes a woman&#39;s head with the words &quot;help me&quot;<br/>
written on it.<br/>
    The toy is called &quot;Summer Slam &#39;99: Road Rage Al Snow.&quot; It&#39;s based<br/>
on WWF wrestler Al Snow...who sometimes carries a female mannequin&#39;s<br/>
head into the ring.<br/>
    Kennesaw State University professor Sabrena Parton - one of the two<br/>
women who complained - says she &quot;just couldn&#39;t believe that something<br/>
like this was being sold to children.&quot; In her words - &quot;We are<br/>
normalizing violent treatment of women. We&#39;re teaching little boys this<br/>
is acceptable behavior. We need to stop the way that women have been<br/>
treated in this society for generations.&quot;</div>
