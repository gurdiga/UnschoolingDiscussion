<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694125518">Last night the kids and I were having a pre-bedtime snack, and they started<br/>
asking me all kinds of questions about school: What were the subjects<br/>
taught?  How long were classes?  How long was recess?  What is it like<br/>
riding the bus?  Then one of them said that he would like to try school for<br/>
a week to see what it was like.  As we talked more about that possibility<br/>
they all decided they would like to check it out.  I&#39;m feeling very anxious<br/>
about the idea of them going, for a variety of reasons and was hoping to get<br/>
some other perspectives on this.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s Someone on the list<br/>
willing to share their thoughts ;&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the thoughts whirling around in my head:<br/>
If they want to go to school, am I failing as an unschooling mom?  Are they<br/>
not challenged?  Are we not doing enough fun and interesting stuff?<br/>
I&#39;m in some ways looking forward to a week &quot;off&quot;, which makes me feel very<br/>
guilty.<br/>
They may try it and realize how lucky they are to be home.<br/>
They may like it, then do I allow them to stay, even if I think it&#39;s not in<br/>
their best interest?<br/>
They may feel &quot;stupid&quot; since we have not been following the traditional<br/>
school schedule and I&#39;m sure there are areas where they would be &quot;behind&quot;.<br/>
What if some want to stay, and some come back home. How hard would it be to<br/>
accomodate such different schedules?<br/>
I&#39;m mostly worried about my oldest, because he is very sensitive and has<br/>
some problems with both social skills and fine motor control, and I&#39;m<br/>
worried that school could be especially hard on him.  How long would it take<br/>
to &quot;deschool&#39; from one week of school?<br/>
<br/>
We leave on vacation on Saturday, then the next week is Thanksgiving, so if<br/>
they are going to go, it won&#39;t be until December.  I have several weeks to<br/>
work this all out in my head.  I would appreciate any input.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Last night the kids and I were having a pre-bedtime snack, and they started<br/>
<br/>
asking me all kinds of questions about school: What were the subjects<br/>
<br/>
taught?  How long were classes?  How long was recess?  What is it like<br/>
<br/>
riding the bus?  Then one of them said that he would like to try school for<br/>
<br/>
a week to see what it was like.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I just went through that.  She said she&#39;d like to go next year, at <br/>
least for a while, &quot;just for the experience.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Last week I drove her slowly by two schools while kids were outside.  One was <br/>
a Catholic mid-school.  We actually turned and parked until they all went in <br/>
after lunch.  We discussed the uniforms and the lining up and the reality that <br/>
not all the kids were having fun out there, some were alone or afraid to go <br/>
back in or wishing they could be at home.  I wasn&#39;t pushing anti-school stuff, <br/>
just sharing observations with her.   Then on the way to the post office, kids <br/>
were out at a public elementary.  I went the longest way around so we she <br/>
could check them out.  I said &quot;being on the playground is a very small part of <br/>
their day,&quot; and she said impatiently, &quot;I know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said she might ask her friend (a neighbor two blocks up) to show her her <br/>
books and homework sometime and that might help satisfy her urge.<br/>
<br/>
I told Holly I would hate it if the other kids were mean to her because she <br/>
couldn&#39;t write as fast as they could or something.<br/>
<br/>
Last night my husband and I were out driving kidlessly and I talked to him <br/>
about that.  He said she probably wouldn&#39;t last long, and I said maybe long <br/>
enough for them to make her think she wasn&#39;t too bright.  But we convinced <br/>
ourselves that it wouldn&#39;t take her long to figure out the few things she wouldn&#39;t <br/>
understand (like where to put her name on the paper, and looking at other kids&#39; <br/>
work could get her in trouble; or math notation).  He figured she&#39;d only need <br/>
to be reminded that she would have three hours straight of not getting to eat <br/>
or walk around, and she&#39;d be hapy to stay home.<br/>
<br/>
His one concern was that she&#39;s never been registered, and if she goes to <br/>
school they might care.  I wasn&#39;t worried.  I said if she decided to quit I could <br/>
just give them a filled-out copy of a state registration form and they&#39;d be <br/>
happy.  (That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;d have to mail the original to the state.)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re open to her trying it.  I hope she changes her mind, but if she gets to <br/>
be 17 and never tried it, she might really wish she had.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If they want to go to school, am I failing as an unschooling mom?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Probably not.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Are they not challenged? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
?  Maybe they wouldn&#39;t be challenged at school either, except for the <br/>
challenges to their patience and boredom-stamina.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Are we not doing enough fun and interesting stuff?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They might imagine school is fun and interesting.  Maybe go to some <br/>
school-field-trip places and follow along near a school group.  That might cure them <br/>
some too!  That group probably will be goofing off, being told to be quiet and <br/>
listen, totally missing the zoo/museum/play for the most part out of the joy of <br/>
being with the other kids outside the classroom.  That&#39;s a valuable thing to <br/>
see.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m in some ways looking forward to a week &quot;off&quot;, which makes me feel very<br/>
<br/>
guilty.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How much &quot;off&quot; time will be spent in school prep and homework help and all <br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t read this, or read it since they said &quot;school,&quot; you might want <br/>
to look again:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>
<br/>
One of your considerations would be how much you as a parent would aid and <br/>
abet the teachers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; How long would it take<br/>
<br/>
to &quot;deschool&#39; from one week of school?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
About a minute if he really wanted to come home. <br/>
A small part of him might harbor feelings for years, if they shame or scare <br/>
him.  Some kids handle that better than others.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We leave on vacation on Saturday, then the next week is Thanksgiving, so if<br/>
<br/>
they are going to go, it won&#39;t be until December.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
NOOO, no no...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d tell them to wait until the beginning of next school year for several <br/>
reasons.  December will be just before midterms.  They can&#39;t do themselves or <br/>
anyone else any good getting there just before review and test time.  And the <br/>
school can&#39;t give them credit for the session without transfer from another <br/>
school anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have several weeks to<br/>
<br/>
work this all out in my head. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you should consider that you have several months.  <br/>
<br/>
If they start next fall, they&#39;re just a few more among the new kids from <br/>
other schools.  If they start in December, the other kids will already all know <br/>
each other, the routine, the building, etc.  At the beginning of school lots of <br/>
kids are learning who&#39;s who and where&#39;s what.<br/>

than&quot; for their differences, rather than special, like they are.<br/>
<br/>
I also think you are right about not starting school in the middle of<br/>
everything.  If they don&#39;t change their minds, I think January, after the<br/>
winter break, would be the soonest we would try it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My granddaughter did a week in grade two about that time of year. She got <br/>
the perfect teacher for it (in my daughter&#39;s and my minds). This woman was <br/>
a b*tch. She wouldn&#39;t let Skye call her mother when she wasn&#39;t happy there, <br/>
even though Heather had told her that she could. Even when she came with a <br/>
note, the teacher wouldn&#39;t let her call.<br/>
Her take on school after a week? &quot;School is boring. My teacher is mean. I <br/>
liked lunch and recess.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of homeschooled kids want to try school just so they&#39;ll have <br/>
a better idea what their schooled friends are talking about. Letting them <br/>
dip their toes into that will usually be enough.<br/>

<br/>
Depending what grades they would be in, that might not work well either.  <br/>
They might not be able to &quot;promote&quot; on half a year&#39;s work.  Schools are crazy.  <br/>
They like to think every year counts. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yet they have social-promotion requirements.  <br/>
<br/>
So even though there&#39;s only probably a three-year window in which they can <br/>
juggle kids, I&#39;d hate to see a kid &quot;held back a grade&quot; when he&#39;d only wanted to <br/>
try school out for his own curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
Also if Holly DOES go to school I absolutely plan to write to the principal <br/>
and teachers and say that it is NOT my choice for her to be there, but they <br/>
have the opportunity to show her how cool school can be and how much they really <br/>
care about her as an individual.<br/>
<br/>
Then when she says &quot;I&#39;m going home now,&quot; nobody will be surprised, and it <br/>
will be clearly their fault or not keeping her fascinated. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-361292550">&lt;&lt;Here are some of the thoughts whirling around in my<br/>
head:<br/>

<br/>
From what you&#39;ve said, I don&#39;t think so!  It seems to<br/>
me that they were interested in something, they feel<br/>
free to bring that to ya and have a thoughtful,<br/>
probing conversation about it, and they feel free to<br/>
experiment and learn more about it.  The fact that<br/>
it&#39;s about school might give you the impression that<br/>
unschooling is not working?  But from what I see it&#39;s<br/>
proof that it is!  <br/>
<br/>
Look at it differently, I say.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, about them actually going to school, I don&#39;t have<br/>
any advice on how to get them in and outta there. <br/>
<br/>
But I would definitely involve them in the whole<br/>
process of finding out how to enroll them, how hard it<br/>
would be to take them out when they want to leave,<br/>
etc.  <br/>
Are there legal issues to take into account? <br/>
Personally, I don&#39;t want &quot;the man&quot; to even know that I<br/>
have a school age child!  <br/>
<br/>
Talking to them about how school doesn&#39;t really work a<br/>
week at a time and that it might be tough to do that<br/>
and why,  might give them second thoughts.  If that<br/>
doesn&#39;t turn out to be an issue, than a week of <br/>
school might be a great learning experience, just like<br/>
anything else in unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t envy you the process, but I think it&#39;s kinda<br/>
cool.  See what happens when we give our kids freedom,<br/>
they do things we&#39;d never do!  That&#39;s scary, but it&#39;s<br/>
part of respecting them as individuals.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck! Keep us updated? <br/>

Have any of you thought of enrolling the kids in a different sort of group <br/>
class?  Like an art class for kids, or music, or band?  I know in the past, when <br/>
my kids were pretty little, they got their school &quot;fix&quot; from going to CCD and <br/>
sitting at desks with workbooks, having holiday parties there, etc.  It gave <br/>
them a taste of &quot;school&quot; without being enrolled in an actual school.<br/>

In Ohio we notify every year.  &quot;The man&quot; knows!  I could enroll<br/>
them(although I don&#39;t know exactly what that involves), then whenever they<br/>
are ready to come home again I just re-notify, which in this case would mean<br/>
printing out the same letter I&#39;ve used for the last five years (with a new<br/>
date on it of course) and turning it in to the Superintendent&#39;s office.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923273693">**Last night my husband and I were out driving kidlessly and I talked to <br/>

<br/>
I always seem to want to prescribe works of fiction to make a point to <br/>
people. (I can&#39;t be sure if I&#39;m promoting &quot;information&quot; or &quot;propaganda&quot;. <br/>
  Is the difference caused by my intentions?)<br/>
<br/>
So, a couple of books to consider, about homeschooled girls who try school:<br/>
<br/>
_Libby on Wednesday_ is an interesting book about a middle school aged <br/>
girl being homeschooled by eccentric aunts and uncles.  Her absent mom <br/>
presses for her to start attending school.  On the way to the <br/>
predictible pro-school ending her experiences as a new girl in school <br/>
being treated very poorly by the other kids seem quite realistic to me. <br/>
  I think the author is Zilpha K-something Snyder.<br/>
<br/>
_Stargirl_ is a very intriguing book about an open and loving <br/>
homeschooled teen who stands out in both good and bad ways when she <br/>
attends high school.<br/>

Exactly. From what I remember about your post, (sorry,<br/>
I delete) is that they want the social and &quot;normal&quot;<br/>
parts of school.  I&#39;m wondering how old your<br/>
child(ren)  is/are, and how many unschooling kids<br/>
think about school at a certain age range for those<br/>
reasons. Hopefully, when they see the trade offs<br/>
involved they can see for themselves why you kept them<br/>
outta there! lol <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess since it&#39;s about school I tend to take it <br/>
personally.<br/>
I AM glad they feel comfortable discussing it and<br/>
exploring the idea of<br/>
school.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 And it seems like you stayed open to hear them even<br/>
tho you were uncomfortable, and I&#39;ll pat ya on the<br/>
back for that, that&#39;s tough to do!  <br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear the legal stuff isn&#39;t complicated.  <br/>
<br/>

Again, good luck!<br/>

truly repulsive, and much too scary for my kids.<br/>

&gt;  And it seems like you stayed open to hear them even<br/>
&gt; tho you were uncomfortable, and I&#39;ll pat ya on the<br/>
&gt; back for that, that&#39;s tough to do!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Glad to hear the legal stuff isn&#39;t complicated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again, good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the moral support.  I really did feel uncomfortable talking about<br/>
sending them to school..  I felt like saying &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you guys rather talk<br/>
about sex?  Politics?  Religion maybe?&quot;  My oldest(11)  said yesterday he&#39;s<br/>
over it.  He doesn&#39;t really want to try it after all.  Who knows what will<br/>
happen with the other two in the next few months?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Each parent decides what aspects of reality to protect their children from <br/>
until they&#39;re ready. I showed this one to Zeke (13) and he looked a bit <br/>
stunned, then shook his head. We talked a bit about rights and the Drug War <br/>
and what it means when we abandon rights in pursuit of protecting ourselves <br/>
from our own bad decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Would I show it to Ian (7)? Nah, he&#39;s not ready for that.<br/>
