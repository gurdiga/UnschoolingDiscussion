<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500811460">Dear Friends:<br/>
<br/>
The Breast Cancer site is having trouble getting enough people to click on it <br/>
daily to meet their quota of donating at least one free mammogram a day to an <br/>
underprivileged woman. It takes less than a minute to go to their site & <br/>
click on &quot;donating a mammogram&quot; for free (pink window in the middle) their <br/>
corporate sponsors/advertisers use the number of daily visits to donate a <br/>
mammogram in exchange for advertising.  Here&#39;s the website! Pass it along to <br/>
all your friends!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Tell 10 Friends Today! Please take a minute and help us spread the word about <br/>
The Breast Cancer Site. By telling 10 friends about this fast, free way to <br/>
provide mammograms to underprivileged women, you make a real impact on the <br/>
number of women we help. In the first month of this year, we generated funds <br/>
to provide 200 women with mammograms. With your help, we can impact the lives <br/>
of more than 2,000 women in 2001. 43,000 women will die from breast cancer <br/>
this year. Please click daily and tell others about The Breast Cancer Site. <br/>
This is genuine! Please take a moment to pass it along.<br/>
