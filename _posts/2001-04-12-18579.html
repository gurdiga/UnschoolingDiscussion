&lt;&lt; So, that&#39;s my contribution to the ghostliness. Am I<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s melodramatic.<br/>
<br/>
If we were in less isolated surroundings, and you knew all your neighbors, <br/>
your instincts would have been more useful.<br/>
<br/>
I was told throughout my school days (and a friend was told in college just <br/>
15 years ago or so, so they havne&#39;t stopped saying it) that humans no longer <br/>
had any instincts--they had all been extinguished, and so we had to learn out <br/>
of books, and learn from other people with language, or else we wouldn&#39;t know <br/>
how to do anything.<br/>
<br/>
Many other things are pooh-poohed because that &quot;no instinct&quot; theory (&quot;fact&quot;) <br/>
is so strongly believed by so many people.<br/>
<br/>
Teenagers have as real an urge to leave home as a two year old has to STAY <br/>
home.  But in the two year old it is a virtue (unless relatives say &quot;He needs <br/>
a good pre-school to get him over this &#39;attachment to mom&#39;&quot;), but in the <br/>
teenager the just-as-strong instinct is called defiance and rebellion.<br/>
<br/>
We should pay more attention to our instincts sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
(Big tangent to say, &quot;no, you sensed something wrong, I bet.&quot;)<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely!  I have learned to save myself a LOT of trouble by listening<br/>
to my &quot;gut&quot;.  I&#39;ve ignored it too often with negative results.  I think<br/>
the intstincts were a birth right, what I had to &quot;learn&quot; was to pay<br/>
attention.<br/>

<br/>
What a cool quote!!<br/>
<br/>
This is what Howard Gardner (and the similar others studying cognition and <br/>
intelligence) is getting at with his &quot;intrapersonal&quot; and &quot;interpersonal&quot; <br/>
intelligences.  They&#39;re  never going to be on standardized tests.   <br/>
Mathematical, and verbal will get you praise and jobs and college.  Spatial <br/>
helps.  Musical and kinesthetic might get you full scholarships, but are <br/>
still considered something you do until you get a REAL job (unless you teach <br/>
music or dance, or become a coach or trainer).   But the inter- and <br/>
intra-personals, although supremely useful, are edgy and unmeasureable, and <br/>
therefor suspect.  Not &quot;real,&quot; in the way that production and results can be <br/>
measured.<br/>

I love Einstein&#39;s mind.  I have a poster of him with the quote, &quot;I want<br/>
to know God&#39;s thoughts.  The rest is just details.&quot;  His thoughts were so<br/>
unfettered, the secret of genius IMO.<br/>
