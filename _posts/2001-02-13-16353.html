One of my favorite writers said that he always thought a person should have <br/>
two dryers, then you could just leave your clothers in there. He said you <br/>
could turn it on for a second and have warm underwear! <br/>
He also wanted two dishwashers then you would never have to put dishes away! <br/>

anymore. They don&#39;t seem to like me. They always are<br/>
