<div id="ygrps-yiv-717050634">We recently moved and the kids took it well, especially since my 5 yo dd<br/>
has a lot more freedom here.  She is on her bike at 7:30 a.m. riding up<br/>
and down the street (its a dead end that comes out to a side street<br/>
with another dead end road attached), we keep in touch with walkie<br/>
talkies, too.  Thats great although difficult to keep her from waking<br/>
people up by knocking on their doors too early.  Bel is what I would<br/>
call extremely social.  She is an extrovert and gets a lot of energy<br/>
from playing with other kids.  Im not like that at all.  When she cant<br/>
find anyone to play with, she gets extremely frustrated.  She doesnt<br/>
like to do crafts, she will not play alone and plays with her 2 ½ yo<br/>
sister only when there is no one else.  Only since we moved here has she<br/>
said to me that her sister is just a baby and she doesnt want to play<br/>
baby games.  I know that was bound to come up at sometime but I know one<br/>
of the older kids said it to her.  Thats a different issue.  I cant<br/>
shelter them from life but can only explain how unfair that statement is<br/>
to her sister.   My problem lies in the fact that if there is no one to<br/>
play with, Bel wants me to be her playmate for hours on end and I cant<br/>
do that.  I will play games and read books, go for walks, the park, etc.<br/>
but at some point I need to answer the phone for our business and get<br/>
things done.  When it comes time to go somewhere, she gives me such a<br/>
hard time because there are kids out and she wants to be playing (thats<br/>
probably pretty typical but it makes things extremely difficult).<br/>
Sometimes its hard for the other kids, too, because they will come in<br/>
and she will have me set up a project for them to do but wont let the<br/>
other kid finish.  Bel has a hard time finishing projects which is fine<br/>
but she wont let the other kids finish if shes ready to move on.   <br/>
 <br/>
I dont know how to help her keep herself occupied.  If she isnt<br/>
playing with friends, shes watching tv.  She knows how to read but<br/>
doesnt pick up a book that often for pleasure.  I have picked up many<br/>
books for her that are about the things she is interested in right now.<br/>
I have read her those same books but she doesnt just pick them up<br/>
unless there is nothing on tv.  I am worried that come September when<br/>
all these kids go to school, she is going to spend 8 hours a day<br/>
watching tv or screaming at me because there is no one to play with.  We<br/>
try to do outside things with other homeschoolers and just going to<br/>
places where kids can play but thats only a couple hours here and there<br/>
and she has a hard time with stopping.  She would be content going from<br/>
an amusement park to a party to another amusement park all in the same<br/>
day.  I have no clue how to deal with this.  I get my energy from quiet<br/>
time where I can write or do rubberstamping or scrapbooking.  I not only<br/>
have a hard time understanding her boredom but have a harder time with<br/>
her constant in and out routine when she sees kids out in the<br/>
neighborhood.  I want most of all for her to be able to be herself while<br/>
taking into consideration the familys needs as well.  Her sister gets<br/>
left in the middle of a game if Bel sees a friend outside.  I cant<br/>
establish any kind of a loose routine (which I need to stay sane and run<br/>
the business) because she wants to be outside knocking on everyones<br/>
door so early!  I could use advice from other parents of really<br/>
extroverted kids who cant seem to do any thing without another persons<br/>
involvement (including going to get dressed  she insists her sister<br/>
needs to go upstairs with her) and how they handle the issues that arise<br/>
when the neighborhood kids go back to public school.  We keep busy but<br/>
for Bel its not enough unless she is playing and involved with others<br/>
from waking to sleeping.  <br/>

Kirby was that way.  Luckily, I&#39;m extroverted too, but my husband is not, and <br/>
our second son was not.  <br/>
<br/>
MAYBE, perhaps, you could babysit?  I wouldn&#39;t commit to something longterm, <br/>
but maybe seeing if keeping someone else&#39;s (maybe slightly older!) child <br/>
sometimes would satisfy the need for non-stop play and also keep you from having to <br/>
be the playmate.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there&#39;s a homeschooling family with working parents and you could be <br/>
the babysitter, at least sometimes.  If you found someone your daughter really <br/>
likes, and especially if it&#39;s someone older or calming or both, you could <br/>
accomplish several things at once.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-144743071">I have even been considering a non-compulsory &quot;preschool&quot; for my son <br/>
to meet his social needs. Totally at his discretion to come or go and <br/>
I can attend apparently. It is called Open Door. <br/>
<br/>
But as you mentioned, when these children go off to school that <br/>
leaves him alone. I think by then he will have more specific <br/>
interests that may have other participants his age hopefully. We also <br/>
do the music and gym classes locally.<br/>

<br/>
My first and fourth sons are/were like this - whereas the youngest two just love to stay home ( and thats another different story!). <br/>
<br/>
A couple of things we did  --started homeschool playgroup in our house one day a week - so there was always a core bunch of kids who came over with their mums for the day. I also set up a weekly homeschool park day. Maybe fit your work schedule in around this?<br/>
<br/>
We  also have set up many play dates - homeschool friends coming over  or  schooled friends after school, or J going to a  friend&#39;s house.  My eldest sometimes went to after school care activities, even though he didn&#39;t go to school - he liked the group social things in the afternoons and school holidays. I found that when   they had friends over, playing, I could get other stuff done, spend time with other kids - cos the social child was having his social needs met....Leonie<br/>
