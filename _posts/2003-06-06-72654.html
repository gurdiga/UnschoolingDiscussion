&gt; <br/>
&gt; so much fun, and everyone glared at us, because, dammit, don&#39;t we know that <br/>
&gt; grocery shopping is supposed to be a boring chore?  Nope.  And I don&#39;t care <br/>
&gt; what other people think it&#39;s &quot;supposed&quot; to be.   Seeing a parent and child <br/>
&gt; together having fun doing the shopping was probably quite a shock, as I <br/>
&gt; never see <br/>
&gt; it, either.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We went to Krispy Kreme last Sunday, after church. It was just Jared, Sierra <br/>
and I. We were having so much fun trying to pick which donuts, &quot;oooh, oooh, <br/>
look at these ones with sprinkles&quot; or &quot;HEY, this has cream filling!&quot; abd every <br/>
kind of donut they picked I asked for two of.<br/>
The lady was laughing and she asked &quot;are they YOUR kids?&quot;<br/>
When I said they were, she got this funny look on her face, like she couldn&#39;t <br/>
quite believe it. I guess a Mom that said yes and had fun was just too much <br/>
for her???<br/>

Think of it another way Ren. Maybe you just don&#39;t look like a mom! Take that<br/>
as a compliment!!<br/>

you can only do that with other people&#39;s children, and not your own?  Btw, I <br/>
have a lot of fun with cousins and nieces and nephews, too, but *sigh*.....<br/>

(well not most but many) would either do the choosing for the kids, or LIMIT the <br/>
choosing or number of donuts, because maybe too much sugar, too messy, spoil <br/>
the appetite for lunch, for all those &quot;motherly&quot; reasons that sometimes just <br/>
spill out of the mouths of mothers who are trying so hard to be mothers they <br/>
sometimes forget what it&#39;s like to be the child.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, we LOVE the krispy kreme here and it&#39;s such great fun to drive to <br/>
Alexandria in the middle of the night to get donuts on a whim and watch through the <br/>
glass outside and see them being made.  Lots of fun to see all the different <br/>
types of people at the Krispy Kreme in the middle of the night too.<br/>
<br/>
Big adventure, sometimes we even wake up the little kid next door to go, he <br/>
seems way less impressed than my own do though...<br/>
