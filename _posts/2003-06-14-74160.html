having NOTHING to do with his parenting.) Perry was wonderful with Julian when <br/>
he was little. Perry worked as a teacher in a hippy-dippy co-op day care <br/>
center before and after Julian was born. He&#39;s always been great with little ones, <br/>
and my only criticism of him with little kids is that Perry has very high <br/>
energy and tends to overstimulate the crap out of them.<br/>
<br/>
They have a blast.<br/>
<br/>
As Julian got older, though, Perry started to get authoritarian and worried <br/>
and weird. Not all the time, but he&#39;d periodically wory that Julian couldn&#39;t do <br/>
structure, or that the homeschooling wasn&#39;t covering enough, or just not <br/>
listen to him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll need to ask him what made him mellow out. He doesn&#39;t yell very often at <br/>
him anymore, and he really seems to be listening to him, and he&#39;s REALLY <br/>
lightened up on the unschooling.<br/>
