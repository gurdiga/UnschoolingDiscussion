<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789031981">These are quotes from an article on the Michael Jackson trial, and it&#39;s an  <br/>
interesting that that such information could be court testimony.  They&#39;re  not <br/>
crimes, but it&#39;s still interesting to see.  The first quote is from a  <br/>
maid/housekeeper who worked there for ten years, until 2003 (I think).  THe  <br/>
parenthetical notes are my own, the rest is from an article online:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;With the absence of authority figures, these children became wild,&quot;  <br/>
Fournier said. Jackson&#39;s child guests were allowed to watch movies, eat as much  <br/>
candy as they liked and stay up as late as they wanted.<br/>
 <br/>
. . . .<br/>
 <br/>
Mesereau (defense attorney) also asked Fournier (former  housekeeper) <br/>
whether, given that Neverland was designed to be a fantasy  land for children, it <br/>
would be surprising that &quot;they would go a little  wild.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;No, that would not be unusual,&quot; she said. <br/>
======================================================= <br/>
It&#39;s a fantasy land for children who don&#39;t have such great lives otherwise, I <br/>
 think. <br/>
My house is a fantasy land for children (but without the ferris wheel or  <br/>
whatever all) and my kids watch movies, eat all the candy they want, stay up as  <br/>
late as they want and they do NOT go wild. <br/>
Interesting juxtaposition. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s always hard with stuff like this to know what &quot;wild&quot; means through<br/>
the filter of the person doing the reporting.  Perhaps this woman would<br/>
look at your household and describe kids &quot;going wild&quot; there because she<br/>
simply disagrees with kids having that much freedom ;)  Eating candy and<br/>
staying up late might have been &quot;going wild&quot; in her book.<br/>

From what I also read, she was talking about the children running all over<br/>
and destroying things too. Making a mess by actually breaking things and<br/>
throwing things. That&#39;s what I thought she was referring to as wild.<br/>
