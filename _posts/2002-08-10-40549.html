  Julie asks:<br/>
  &gt; How many people do you figure Christianity has killed?  We&#39;ve got the<br/>
  &gt; Crusades, Spanish Inquisition, Converting of Celts, Native Americans,<br/>
  &gt; Africans, etc...<br/>
   <br/>
  Ned butts in: <br/>
  Julie, you get my vote.<br/>
  Recently there have been tallies made about how many people have been killed<br/>
  by their own governments. I&#39;ll try to find the numbers. (Hope this isn&#39;t OT,<br/>
  but no one has objected to this thread yet)  The numbers are as astronomical<br/>
  as the ones for religions killing people, and for racial murdering, or<br/>
  simple plunder and other reasons. The government killings include, of<br/>
  course, Gallileo, Socretes, and Jesus. Then there are the 24 Salem<br/>
  &quot;witches&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
  It takes government to make a war.<br/>
<br/>
  Does anybody know the penalties for homeschooling a child in the countries<br/>
  in Europe in which it is prohibited?<br/>
<br/>
  In Massachusetts, there is a homeschooling family whose children are under<br/>
  the jurisdiction of the state dept of something, not for abuse or neglect of<br/>
  any kind -- it has never been about inadequate parenting -- but for not<br/>
  submitting a curriculum to the local school district.<br/>
