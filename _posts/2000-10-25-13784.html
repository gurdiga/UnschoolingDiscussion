&lt;&lt; Just that he has never seen it done sucessful.  I am a hands on learner so <br/>
I want to teach that way.  At least until I see my chilren wanting to learn <br/>
in another way.  He just doesnt see why try something that has &quot;failed.&quot;  I <br/>
can see how to make it succeed because it is basicly the way I learn. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I agree with the people who suggest that you sit down with your <br/>
husband, and eventually your child to determine your goals and decide what <br/>
you consider success.<br/>
<br/>
I think my 10yo daughter is a success story as are the children of many <br/>
others on this list. Try David&#39;s book And the Skylark Sings with Me. In it he <br/>
tells the story of homeschooling his daughters using the community as their <br/>
greatest resource. It&#39;s a very interesting story with lots of good <br/>
suggestions for resources in many different areas.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s our story. When my daughter was starting 2nd grade, we carefully <br/>
researched all the schools in the area to which we were moving and purchased <br/>
a house based on the school we thought would be best for her. There were lots <br/>
of positive aspects to the school and she enjoyed herself and was a <br/>
&quot;successful&quot; student.<br/>
<br/>
I began to have doubts about the school as I volunteered in her classroom of <br/>
second and third graders each week. It seemed that the teachers spent a lot <br/>
of time on regaining order and trying to convince some of the children to <br/>
learn. I could also see clear favoritism and an inability on the teachers&#39; <br/>
parts to get to everyone&#39;s questions. Often Melina would come home with <br/>
questions which she said the teacher wouldn&#39;t answer because she would learn <br/>
it next year as a third grader.<br/>
<br/>
The final straw came for me when her teacher corrected her homework stating <br/>
that her classification of peppers and cucumbers as fruits may have been <br/>
technically true, but was not the way they were learning it in class. The <br/>
message I got from that was &quot;The teacher is the final authority in all <br/>
things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At that point I started researching private schools, but was unimpressed with <br/>
what I saw. We had friends in a far away state who homeschooled their <br/>
daughters, so I decided to consider the option. I set about doing lots of <br/>
research on the Internet, and at libraries and bookstores. After discussing <br/>
it with my husband, who had reservations but trusted my judgment I decided to <br/>
do it. Melina was thrilled with the idea of being home with her baby sister <br/>
and me each day.<br/>
<br/>
We started out with a couple of hours of school at home every day and she did <br/>
very well. She was perfectly happy with this method and my husband and I both <br/>
liked the results we saw. Then the holidays came and we took a Christmas <br/>
break. We were amazed at what we saw. She spent the whole time reading, <br/>
writing, making and creating things, and just laying around coming up with <br/>
great ideas. She was learning without any incentive from me.<br/>
<br/>
At that point I did more research about unschooling and decided to give it a <br/>
shot. Melina has gone from reading on a 4th or 5th grade level to reading <br/>
adult books, including many classics. She has dabbled in geometry and <br/>
informal studies of physics. She has taught me things that I should have <br/>
known about U.S. history. She is fast becoming an expert on African-American <br/>
history. She has learned to read Spanish, which she already knew how to <br/>
speak. She is looking for an opportunity to volunteer with Spanish-speaking <br/>
children when she returns from her visit back East. She is learning to read <br/>
music and play the recorder. She knows much more than I about local plant and <br/>
animal life. <br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on about the things she has learned but that&#39;s not the <br/>
point. the point is that she has learned them because she wanted to and has <br/>
enjoyed most of the journey. She is absolutely passionate about learning and <br/>
knows how to go about finding answers to questions. Sounds like a success to <br/>
me.<br/>
