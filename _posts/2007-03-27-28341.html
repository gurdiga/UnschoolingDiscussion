Beethoven could do that--he needed to, when he was deaf and kept<br/>
writing.   In Victorian times, there were people who could write<br/>
music so well they would go to performances and transcribe the music<br/>
they heard and then sell it illegally.  It was like bootleg DVDs of<br/>
the 1880&#39;s.<br/>

One of my favorite scenes in Amadeus is when Mozart is on his death bed <br/>
having Salieri transcribe notes for him.<br/>
<br/>
Badaba-bumpbump-badaba-bumpbump-badaba-bumpbump---then a solo <br/>
flute---then the voices---the strings.....&quot;Do you have it? Do you have <br/>
it? Let me see it!&quot;---he&#39;s going so fast Salieri can&#39;t write fast <br/>
enough---But he can &quot;hear&quot; it, and it&#39;s beautiful!<br/>
