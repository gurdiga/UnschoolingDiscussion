Living in Portland with our rainy weather, we&#39;ll be lucky to see the moon<br/>
that night, but others of you may have the chance.  Be sure not to miss it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Something to look forward to on December 22, 1999.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This year will be the first full moon to occur on the winter solstice, Dec.<br/>
22nd, commonly called the first day of<br/>
winter.  Since a full moon on the winter solstice occurs in conjunction with<br/>
a lunar perigee (point in the moon&#39;s orbit that is closest to Earth), the<br/>
moon will appear about 14% larger than it does at apogee (the point in it&#39;s<br/>
elliptical orbit that is farthest from the Earth).<br/>
<br/>
Since the Earth is also several million miles closer to the sun at this time<br/>
of the year than in the summer, sunlight striking the moon is about 7%<br/>
stronger making it brighter.<br/>
<br/>
Also, this will be the closest perigee of the Moon of the year since the<br/>
moon&#39;s orbit is constantly deforming. If the weather is clear and there is a<br/>
snow cover where you live, it is believed that even car headlights will be<br/>
superfluous.<br/>
<br/>
On December 21st. 1866 the Lakota Sioux took advantage of this combination<br/>
of occurrences and staged a devastating retaliatory ambush on soldiers in<br/>
the Wyoming Territory.<br/>

 ::::::::In laymen&#39;s terms it will be a super bright full moon, much more<br/>
than the usual AND it hasn&#39;t happened this way for 133 years!&lt;&lt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213753423">We saw a beautiful moonrise on Monday December 20th, but it clouded up<br/>
for the rest of the week.  It did look a bit larger than usual, somewhat<br/>
like a harvest moon.  We also watched Apollo 13 that night.<br/>
