<div id="ygrps-yiv-452134329">I can so relate to this!!  I got my period at 10 and it was super heavy <br/>
crampy.  Every time I bled through my clothes, the school insisted I be <br/>
taken to the doctor to make sure I wasn&#39;t having a miscarriage, can you <br/>
imagine?!  I just hope Harriet starts at a more reasonable age.  That <br/>
was a lot to handle - I wasn&#39;t ready yet.<br/>

  &lt;&lt;&lt;I was the first one in my class to get my period and I was beaten up by a<br/>
  5th grader (I was at the tail end of the fourth grade) for getting my period<br/>
  before her. I will never forget her grabbing my pads out of my purse and<br/>

  Jeez!  I&#39;m sorry that happened to you.  Gosh.  There were some freaky girls at my school, too, that would expose other girls having their periods.  It&#39;s such a sensitive special time and some girls that age can be so terribly cruel.  I could never understand that.  I&#39;m so glad I have my girl at home and when that time comes for her, we can celebrate that milestone, instead of me having to teach her how to deal with cruel kids at school.  <br/>

I&#39;m so sorry this happened to you. Our cycles should be  a source of empowerment and strength.<br/>

Be well,<br/>
