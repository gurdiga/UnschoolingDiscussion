<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517469378">&lt;&lt;let my 6yo watch Howard Stern&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOL.  This is exactly the example I used awhile back in my argument FOR<br/>
controlling the content of my kids&#39; television shows.  After considering<br/>
what Sandra and other posters stated, I realized that my 8yo has no interest<br/>
in Howard Stern, is not even interested in anything along that line.  If he<br/>
did watch the show, it would just to be with me while I watched it.<br/>
<br/>
Can you really envision your 6yo walking into the den, turning on the tv,<br/>
flipping past shows on army guys, snakes, construction, Spongebob, etc., and<br/>
tuning in to E! and naked ladies?<br/>
<br/>
True story....last night 8yo said he wanted to watch a show called &quot;The<br/>
scariest places&quot; or some such thing.  I told him that I didn&#39;t think he<br/>
would like it because it is really scary.  He started to argue and I backed<br/>
off.  He wanted to put the show on timer which makes it difficult to change<br/>
channels.  I asked him not to so he could change channels if he became<br/>
frightened.  He watched less than 2 minutes of the show, deciding for<br/>
himself that it was too intense for him.  If I had made the decision, I<br/>
would have robbed Zach of that knowledge of himself and his environment.<br/>
<br/>
Just my .02<br/>
