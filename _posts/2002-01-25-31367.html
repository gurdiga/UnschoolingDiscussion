<div id="ygrps-yiv-434734126">Hi Pat,<br/>
 <br/>
I just had to respond to your question. Unschooling.com is so special <br/>
to me because that was my first inspiration to start unschooling. I <br/>
have been going there every day since September. Yes, it is different <br/>
than this list. I joined this list a month or so after I found <br/>
unschooling.com.<br/>
 <br/>
I really love the way the message board is set up. It is getting <br/>
really full lately because of all the different threads started. I <br/>
think they need to and will be sprucing it up a bit soon, at least <br/>
what is what I read there. There are just VAST amounts of <br/>
informations there from all the different past conversations that <br/>
have taken place.<br/>
 <br/>
If you go down to the bottom of the page, you will see New Messages. <br/>
If you click that, you will see all the most current conversations <br/>
taking place, in case you want to join in on any. You can join in on <br/>
any conversation you want to if you think you have anything to say <br/>
about it (or not). You can post questions there and get feedback. You <br/>
can even post questions or comments on old threads and usually the <br/>
conversation will start again with you. You can just lurk for a while <br/>
and read and learn about things that way.<br/>
 <br/>
If you have any more questions about it, please feel free to ask me. <br/>
I think I have a good understanding of the place and definitely a <br/>
fondness for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378816492">Hi Karin, <br/>
<br/>
I am just the opposite.  I HATE message boards like that.  Oh, I&#39;ll <br/>
go read them from time to time, but something about them turns me <br/>
off.  I much prefer these groups.  But then I know there are loads  <br/>
of people out there who like the other kind.  I guess it is just one <br/>
of those things.<br/>
