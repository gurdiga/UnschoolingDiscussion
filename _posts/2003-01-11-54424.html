<br/>
After Camp Fire we went to a family reunion held specifically for my aunt, my <br/>
dad&#39;s twin, and the person who I was named for.  She begins chemotherapy <br/>
tomorrow for brain and lung tumors, and so came up from Florida for to see <br/>
everyone before she gets really sick.  Everyone came, because of her special <br/>
status (they&#39;ve given her less than 6 months, and a couple of those are <br/>
already gone).  So I spent my birthday hugging and being hugged on by lots of <br/>
people I haven&#39;t seen in ages, and some I just saw in November at my <br/>
grandmother&#39;s 97th birthday party.  Aunt Linda remembered my birthday and <br/>
told everyone about it, and so everyone wished me a happy one when I hugged <br/>
them.  When I hugged Betty Ann for the last time before we left, I almost <br/>
burst into tears, which would have really ruined the joyful mood.  So I <br/>
reached down and stuck both hands in a cooler full of ice water.  It didn&#39;t <br/>
work very well, but nobody noticed, and just thought I was looking for a cold <br/>
drink.<br/>
<br/>
We stayed for several hours, then went to some friend&#39;s house and visited <br/>
with them and then drove the 200 miles back home.  <br/>
<br/>
We got home at midnight and I didn&#39;t get any physical birthday presents <br/>
(because we are going to Vegas on Thursday for our anniversary/mybirthday).  <br/>
But I sure got a lot of love yesterday!  And now here&#39;s some more.  :)<br/>
