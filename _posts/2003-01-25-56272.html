<div id="ygrps-yiv-179680420">Forgive me if this post is a little &quot;off&quot;. It&#39;s waaay past my bedtime, but I <br/>
felt I had to write.<br/>
<br/>
Seems that when we write about children&#39;s rights, it&#39;s (sometimes) coming <br/>
across that the parent has NO rights. That we when we say no bedtimes, that <br/>
people think we mean the children are swinging from the chandeliers until all <br/>
hours. That when we say that kids can eat what and when they want, that they <br/>
eat ice cream and M&Ms all day. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s NOT how it IS. <br/>
<br/>
If your household has been restrictive and you suddenly &quot;let go&quot;---YES, <br/>
things may go a little wild. But it&#39;s really not that black and white.<br/>
<br/>
If dad needs to go to bed early because he must be UP early, EVERYONE in the <br/>
family MUST respect that. Why WOULDN&#39;T a child respect and understand that? <br/>
It&#39;s NECESSARY for dad&#39;s well-being (and to keep that paycheck rolling in! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
). There don&#39;t need to be a million rules, just-----what&#39;s the word???? (I&#39;m <br/>
tired, forgive me!)<br/>
<br/>
Showing children respect does NOT mean that they show NONE to the parents. <br/>
It&#39;s MUTUAL respect. EVERYone&#39;s needs must be met. It&#39;s not the OPPOSITE of <br/>
the top-down family . Ummmm--OK---It&#39;s like the opposite of school is NOT <br/>
homeschooling. That is replicating school at home. The OPPOSITE of school is <br/>
UNschooling where we don&#39;t DO school---or anything that resembles it.<br/>
<br/>
The opposite of the topdown family is not that the children &quot;run the show&quot;. <br/>
It&#39;s an equal partnership. We ALL work together. If dad needs relative quiet <br/>
in the house after 10:00pm, everyone should try to respect that. It&#39;s UNFAIR <br/>
to dad for the kids to be monkeys.  JUST as it&#39;s unfair to set arbitrary <br/>
limits &quot;because I&#39;m the dad&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Could someone elaborate? Seems there&#39;s some &quot;not quite there&quot; newbies who are <br/>
struggling with this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In our house we are considerate of other people.  And having always been <br/>
considerate of our children has modeled that and they are considerate of us.  <br/>
They are young so sometimes need reminding.  &quot;That is getting loud and dad <br/>
does need to sleep to go to work in the morning.&quot;  I liked what someone said <br/>
about not saying things to your children that you wouldn&#39;t say to your DH.  <br/>
You would never tell your DH to do the dishes or else be punished (well maybe <br/>
not, LOL).  You would ask for his help.<br/>

Because kids who haven&#39;t been controlled don&#39;t exhibit crazed wildness.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah...this has been the hardest thing for me to realize...I do not<br/>
really think of myself as a controlling person. But in certain areas<br/>
I am. To see Jason go wild as I have eased up on the restrictions has<br/>
been very eye opening (and at times difficult for me).<br/>
<br/>
But we are getting there...slowly. I have noticed that it is getting easier<br/>
for me to change little things throughout the day that seem to make things<br/>
easier for both of us. I am catching myself before making arbitrary decisions<br/>
and am thinking things through a lot more. The scary thing is that I am noticing<br/>
more and more how much the people around me really treat kids without even thinking<br/>
about it...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, when you change your outlook and your point of view.. it is a revelation <br/>
to see others from a different perspective.     It&#39;s been a true eye opener <br/>
for me too.<br/>
