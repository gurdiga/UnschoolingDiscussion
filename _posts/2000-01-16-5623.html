<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044274577">Sorry - I&#39;m kind of behind...<br/>
<br/>
At my elementary school, we were not allowed to talk in the lunch room<br/>
at all.  We had to raise our hands to be excused, but we were only<br/>
allowed to go out and play if we had eaten EVERYTHING.  So most kids<br/>
didn&#39;t get to play at lunch.  We weren&#39;t allowed to talk during class,<br/>
of course, and we weren&#39;t allowed to hang around school after it was<br/>
over or show up early.  Just the &quot;rules.&quot;  So that left two 15 minute<br/>
recess periods (unless it was raining) for socialization - unless we<br/>
walked home together.  The kids on the bus were not allowed to talk<br/>
either, or to talk while waiting in line for the bus.  <br/>
<br/>
And, while I&#39;m on the subject (kind of), in fourth or fifth - or maybe<br/>
it was sixth - grade, my teacher said that we shouldn&#39;t be feeding the<br/>
starving people in Africa because it was their fault anyway, and<br/>
something about overpopulation.  I came home and told my mom (she always<br/>
asked what we learned at school), and she said she was going to call my<br/>
teacher.  Well, I knew that if she did, the teacher would make school<br/>
even MORE unbearable for me, so I told my mother that I had lied.  I<br/>
figured one lecture at home, and a few extra chores, would be easier for<br/>
me than the rest of the school year with my teacher mad at me.<br/>
<br/>
Am I the only one raised in a school system like this?  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, this is not the only reason I&#39;m keeping my kids out of<br/>
school.  But it sure makes me think.<br/>

        And I bet the principal and teachers still used a paddle. Yes this<br/>
was the way I was raised. I do recall when paddling in the school was<br/>
&quot;outlawed&quot;. As a child I felt releif (for the boys, rarely girls(girls<br/>
where sent to the principals office to scare you) and also unfairness. I<br/>
couldn&#39;t understand how a teacher could keep control of so many kids<br/>
without it. Hummm interesting.<br/>
        Now... well now others on this list can say it better than I. I<br/>
follow my heart. I have grown to respect the voices out there in cyber<br/>
space, Mags, and people in my area of the country. Thanks you all.:-)<br/>
