want to figure out a way to help you help your sons, no one here would bother. <br/>
It&#39;s because it seems like you really want to find a way to help him that <br/>
people are responding to you.<br/>
<br/>
And I understand your frustration. $500 is a lot of money. But from what <br/>
you&#39;ve said, he&#39;s been pretty responsible so far in his life, with good <br/>
follow-through. Already that&#39;s remarkable for a still-young kid. <br/>
<br/>
What you might need to do is to sit down calmly, alone, and figure out what <br/>
your real goal is. Is it not to &quot;waste&quot; this money, or to find out what your <br/>
child needs and wants. (I already know the answer, but I also know that $500 is <br/>
sticking in your craw!)<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that I read in your posts is that maybe you had a lot of <br/>
deprivation as a child. You seem to be very afraid of wasting anything, even food <br/>
you don&#39;t really want. It sounds like maybe you need some care and nurturing <br/>
yourself.  I think unschooling might be really good and wonderful for YOU!<br/>
