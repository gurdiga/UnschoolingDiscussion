Wild  book.  I&#39;m not sure I even recommend the book unless you enjoy  <br/>
something that&#39;s WAY out there. lol   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I love _Illusions_. One of my faves---and I&#39;ve read it again and again. I  <br/>
keep it in the car to peek into when I&#39;m in a bank line or stuck in traffic.  <br/>
Sometimes I find the inspiration I need from the page that opens!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
But I don&#39;t read it believing that everything is &quot;truth&quot;. I read it knowing  <br/>
that it&#39;s fiction and that I can take what I want out of it---which seems to <br/>
be  something different every time (which is a something else the book says as <br/>
well!  &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
 <br/>
If ALL you&#39;re getting out of it is the souls&#39; travels, read it  <br/>
again----&quot;what you think may change!&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
To me, right now, it&#39;s about stepping outside and looking at things from a  <br/>
different PoV. Rather important for an unschooling mom! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, not all that I got out of it at all!  It&#39;s just that the point of <br/>
how people could believe that people choose their destinies was <br/>
brought up, and I remembered that one part of that book and <br/>
commented.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree, that was only one tiny little part of the book. :) <br/>

I read _Illusions_ for the first time a little less than a year ago, and I<br/>
read it as an unschooling manifesto because I was immersed in unschooling<br/>
and letting it permeate our lives. I remember thinking how unschoolers are<br/>
like the messiahs in the book: in the early allegory, unschoolers are the<br/>
folks who stop holding onto the rocks for dear life and just let go,<br/>
allowing life to carry them along and take them to a new way of<br/>
understanding living itself.<br/>
<br/>
Funny how much a story changes depending on what lens we use to read it.<br/>
That&#39;s what I love about writing!<br/>

school....About 8 years ago my mom got to see Richard<br/>
Bach, and had him sign a copy for me, since she knew<br/>
it was my favorite :)<br/>
