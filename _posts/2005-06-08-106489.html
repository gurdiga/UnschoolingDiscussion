<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120139077">Recently I was telling a dad at Karate about homeschooling.  When I <br/>
told him there are a lot that shelter their children to protect them <br/>
from world views he asked me if I had seen The Village.  Well, I <br/>
rented it yesterday and my oldest son and I watched it. It lead to a <br/>
very interesting conversation about sheltering for my oldest son and <br/>
I.  It&#39;s PG-13 but I was scared to death, lol.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-124148854">I personally loved that movie, we own it. My family however wanted to<br/>
 <br/>
be &quot;Scared&quot; and wasn&#39;t. My kids are 23, 17, and 13. My two older <br/>
children are boys, and they wanted more from the plot than just <br/>
the &quot;Love&quot; story that came from it. I loved the deeper meaning of <br/>
the <br/>
film...it spoke to me. My husband said, it was an &quot;okay&quot; movie for<br/>
him <br/>
and he sided with the boys on the whole plot issue. <br/>
<br/>
I loved it, and I loved how it made since to me. Not too many <br/>
movie&#39;s <br/>
speak to me, but that one did. <br/>
<br/>
On that note...have you seen the movie &quot;Whale Rider&quot;? I loved that <br/>
movie...the young girl in it is wonderful, the music is haunting and <br/>
wonderful at the same time, and the story is so touching. <br/>
