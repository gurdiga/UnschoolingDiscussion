equation---or whether Duncan will EVER learn to read and do long division. <br/>
They seem to be very concerned about whether the boys will be able to &quot;deal <br/>
with people they don&#39;t like&quot; (?!) and other &quot;school issues&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We just come across as some kind of radical new age hippies as far as our <br/>
permissiveness in &quot;parenting issues&quot; goes.<br/>
<br/>
I guess they see &quot;TV freedom, movies, internet and fears of kids seeing <br/>
sex or hearing bad language&quot; as being parental choices and the school stuff <br/>
to be more of a requirement of a child&#39;s life and education. <br/>
<br/>
We see it all as interrelated and intertwined. How can we trust them in one <br/>
area and not in another?<br/>

My experience has been different.  The reality that I let my kids <br/>
watch PG-13 and R movies causes other homeschoolers much more <br/>
distress (and it *is* genuine concern) than the lack of any <br/>
educational program.  When other homeschoolers learn I have no <br/>
parental controls programmed onto our computer, and that my kids have <br/>
free access to the internet, it worries them much more than whether <br/>
my dd-13 is doing math.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>AH! HOMEschool parents, NOT parents of schooled children. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get involved with school-at-homers (doh!). &lt;G&gt; ;-P~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
The parents of SCHOOLED kids think we&#39;re way out in left field somewhere as <br/>
parents, but they&#39;re SERIOUSLY concerned about the boys&#39; *education*. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that school-at-homers (doh!) would be a bit freaked at our <br/>
permissiveness--especially here in SC! My stomach turns every time I see <br/>
those HORRID aol and msn commercials.<br/>
