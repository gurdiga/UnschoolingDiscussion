<div id="ygrps-yiv-828965624">Hi  I am new here  I have 2 boys  7 and 3 and after the older one <br/>
suffered thru 2 years of public school I just started homeschool.   I <br/>
am trying to unschool and I found the kids do great at it and learn <br/>
alot.  The only subject I can&#39;t think of how to do is math.  When the <br/>
kids are interested we measure in different ways and the money thing <br/>
is on going   but how will my kids learn multiplication and division <br/>
and such?</div>

<br/>
It&#39;s not a stupid question, but don&#39;t worry.  it happens.<br/>
<br/>
My kids divide in their heads.  They don&#39;t write down the problems they way <br/>
they looked when I went to school, but they understand it better and can do <br/>
it better than I could.   When/if they really need some long division with <br/>
decimals and there&#39;s no calculator at hand (because that&#39;s what they do now <br/>
with bigger problems than they can handle), they&#39;ll ask and someone will show <br/>
them.   But until then, they&#39;re doing two and three digit stuff  mentally, <br/>
however they figured it out.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly and I were looking at a site of school-year stuff because a <br/>
friend&#39;s husband is going crazy about unschooling and we&#39;re trying to find <br/>
her some stuff to keep him shushed.   Holly asked what prime numbers were.  <br/>
(That was listed as a fourth grade thing.)  I showed her the first few, and <br/>
she said &quot;Don&#39;t show me any more, I want to figure it out myself.&quot;   So she <br/>
went off and was going through the numbers finding more primes.  She came and <br/>
asked me questions after a while, twice, and then went back to it.  She&#39;ll <br/>
think of it off and on for the rest of her life.  There&#39;s not going to be a <br/>
test, or a report.  She gets it already.<br/>
<br/>
We have games that use mathematical principles and some of the best don&#39;t <br/>
even have numbers involved.  A board game called &quot;Bazaar&quot;  (look at thrift <br/>
stores, because it&#39;s out of print).   Computer games:  <br/>
The Logical Journey of the Zoombinis<br/>
Math Arena (general concepts, not all low level, very cool, some numbers)<br/>
Treasure Math Storm (some numbers)<br/>
Treasure Mountain (patterns)<br/>
Third Grade Adventure<br/>
<br/>
If you go to www.unschooling.com and look for math topics you&#39;ll find lots of <br/>
ideas.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m guessing that www.google.com might cough up some good stuff if you <br/>
enter math and unschooling.  And you might find ten references to people <br/>
asking how they will learn math, but it does work, it just works differently. <br/>
 They learn the language and manner of mathematical thinking first and THEN <br/>
factoids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715881565">Thank you so much.  I know that my kids learn best<br/>
with unschooling because they tend to be a bit<br/>
stubborn about things  and I am alot stubborn about<br/>
things and curriculum based homeschooling would amount<br/>
to us sitting at the table yelling at each other all<br/>
day whereas  when they see something that interests<br/>
them they want to learn all about it and there are no<br/>
problems.   That is impressive about the prime numbers<br/>
thing.  Her finding out on her own means she will<br/>
always remember...very cool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Real life math probably bears the least resemblance to it&#39;s schoolish<br/>
counterpart than any other &quot;subject&quot;. Because real life math is about<br/>
discovering how numbers work rather than memorizing formulas to impose on<br/>
numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Real life math is, as an example, casually encountering percentages in a<br/>
dozen different contexts and therefore slowly building up an idea of what<br/>
percentages are and how they&#39;re used.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s similar to the process of how we acquire new words. Usually when we&#39;re<br/>
reading or listening to conversations we don&#39;t run and get the dictionary to<br/>
look up a word we don&#39;t know. Generally we can get a good enough idea of its<br/>
meaning from the context. And the next time we encounter it we add another<br/>
facet to our understanding and the fuzzy impression of what the word means<br/>
gets a bit more clear. And so on. The process probably accounts for our<br/>
often not being able to define a word for someone else that we&#39;ve not only<br/>
read and heard dozens of times but even used.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason people think multiplication and division are such difficult<br/>
subjects that, after algebra, that&#39;s the one thing they question under &quot;how<br/>
will they learn?&quot; But once a child realizes that multiplication is just a<br/>
fast way to do repeated addition and that division is just a fast way to do<br/>
repeated subtraction, a great deal of what causes math phobia in adults<br/>
disappears. Multiplication and division aren&#39;t mysterious at all. They&#39;re<br/>
just computation short cuts.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve found helpful is expressing things in a couple of different<br/>
ways. When we&#39;ve come across percents, I&#39;ve said &quot;17% or 17 out of every<br/>
100,&quot; or &quot;25% is the same as a quarter.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is solving problems out loud without pencil and paper so they<br/>
can see how numbers can be manipulated. So for instance to add 138 + 53.<br/>
(Hmm, a bit tougher than I normally pull off the top of my head! ;-) but<br/>
kids *do* pick up on the process when they hear similar processes dozens of<br/>
times.) 39 is almost 40 and 53 is almost 50. 40+50 is 90. But we added 2 to<br/>
the 38 so we need to take away 2 from 90. And we subtracted 3 from the 53 so<br/>
we need to add 3. That brings us up to 91. Then just add 100. So 191.<br/>

right...you, right to left---this is necessary to avoid any dyslexia<br/>

the word digits or digital comes from the word finger.<br/>

But truly you don&#39;t have to &quot;teach&quot; either one.  They will figure it out, and <br/>
the more actual reason there is to count, add, subtract, measure, wonder, the <br/>

There&#39;s no big rush, though.  If they&#39;re young enough not to know what the <br/>

There&#39;s a going-to-sleep tape called &quot;Sounds Like Fun&quot; that my kids listened <br/>

been just another song, and since they did care, they learned it without <br/>
discussion or teaching.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885656741">Hi guys...I&#39;m relatively new here and have been reading most of the posts <br/>
coming through (I say most because you guys post a whole lot and I don&#39;t <br/>
have time to read it all lol).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I wanted to make a little remark about the whole math/life <br/>
thing.  I agree completely that math is one of the most confusing things to <br/>
realize that you actually are teaching, but one of the easiest things to <br/>
teach!!<br/>
<br/>
I have been homeschooling my son for about two years now.  He just turned <br/>
9.  We are pretty much unschoolers, unless he goes to his grandparents <br/>
where they request that I send school work, which he is just fine with!  He <br/>
thinks it is kind of fun to do with his grandma, so I send stuff they can <br/>
do together.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just to share a little story:<br/>
<br/>
We were at our Friday night open gym at the gymnastics place when my son <br/>
came running up to me and asked, &quot;Mom, do I know fractions?&quot;  I told him <br/>
yes, fractions are like the 1/4, 1/2 stuff we always mess around with.  He <br/>
was satisfied with that answer and ran back off again to play.  Later on I <br/>
asked him why he asked me that.  He told me that one of the little girls <br/>
that was there had learned he was homeschooled and was trying to figure out <br/>
if he learned the same kinds of things she did in school.  I personally <br/>
thought that was quite comical!  Especially when my son is always asking to <br/>
learn stuff about math.  He started asking me about multiplication when he <br/>
was about 6...then wanted to learn division right away.  So we talked about <br/>
it, worked out a few little problems, and he just keeps plugging away at <br/>
asking his questions.  He has no idea how much he actually knows and this <br/>
question really struck me funny, because even in our conversations of how <br/>
things work, he now knows how to add fractions, so I know he is figuring <br/>
something out here!!<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to say that I too have a great challenge in getting my family <br/>
to understand why I am homeschooling and that I plan on doing this until <br/>
the end!  My mother is a Kindergarten teacher, and insists that when he <br/>
gets to middle school I will have to send him back to school.  I tell her <br/>
&quot;whatever&quot; my most favoritist word.  LOL  The thing is, I honestly don&#39;t <br/>
know what grade my son is in.  He works at all different levels at <br/>
different things, as he likes.  People don&#39;t really get that and always ask <br/>
&quot;what grade is he in&quot;.  My son always looks at me with a look of &quot;HELP!&quot; <br/>
when someone asks because we don&#39;t really know the answer.  So we tell them <br/>
he is whatever grade he wants to be in! lol  He reads wonderfully, loves <br/>
books, and reads whatever he can get his hands on.  Presently is reading <br/>
The Hobbit, cause I told him he couldn&#39;t read The Lord of the Rings until <br/>
he read The Hobbit! LOL  He is on his computer all the time, programming, <br/>
making games, playing games, whatever.  His passion is to make a new, <br/>
unique video game, one that Nintendo or Sony will buy for the game <br/>
systems...or both!! lol  So I let him!  It really is funny how people don&#39;t <br/>
understand the concept of unschooling at all...sometimes very frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
Although, okay, here is another story.  I have another friend who unschools <br/>
as well, and being that all of us unschoolers do it differently and all of <br/>
our kids learn at different ages, he started talking about how his 10 year <br/>
old boy had just learned how to read on his own and how proud he was of him <br/>
for that!  He was delighted that he had read a book all the way through the <br/>
previous night, some Mrs. Piggly Wiggly book or something that I wasn&#39;t <br/>
familiar with.  Well, he then turns and asks me when Ronnie learned to <br/>
read.  I really didn&#39;t want to tell him because I didn&#39;t want to make him <br/>
feel bad.  I wanted him to continue to be proud of his son and let it stand <br/>
at that!  But he persisted, so I told him...he started to read at the age <br/>
of 4.  He was writing and telling me his letters and numbers by the time he <br/>
was 2.  My mother used to show him off at her school when he was 2 or <br/>
3...asking him to tell the other teachers the letters cause no one believed <br/>
he knew that stuff.  I thought it was pretty funny, considering the child <br/>
is the one who drove me nuts all the time asking me to do this with <br/>
him!  Anyway, then he asks me what he is reading right now.  Ugh...not a <br/>
question I wanted to answer either!  He was in the midst of reading Mary <br/>
Shelley&#39;s Frankenstein.  The man just kind of looked at me as if I had <br/>
three heads and said &quot;OH!&quot; That was the end of THAT conversation! LOL<br/>
<br/>
So, that is my story, and I&#39;m sticking to it!  My son and I live in SW <br/>
Florida.  My husband was killed in an accident almost three years ago, so <br/>
it is just the two of us.  WE have a ton of family here, so we have a lot <br/>
of support and love.  I hope I will be posting agian some time soon, but <br/>
with me and my life, you just never know!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236756335">I am Amy  (2 sons  7 and 3) and I wish I had<br/>
homeschooled from the start (oldest went to ps  for k<br/>
and 1)   my son was a math geek from the age of 3   ps<br/>
 ruined him  because they didn&#39;t think 5&6 yo could<br/>
know multiplication and division (just simple stuff) <br/>
and all that sort of thing   so my son was stuck doing<br/>
simple addition and subtraction for 2 years and now<br/>
hates math.   He never learned to read in school<br/>
because  first of all he had a problem with the eye<br/>
muscles and couldn&#39;t focus downward  and then the<br/>
school taught memorizing whole words   and when I<br/>
started him on hooked on phonics he started reading<br/>
1st real book was Harry Potter (I helped with the big<br/>
words)  <br/>
It is so impressive that your son wants to make video<br/>
games  using the computer to do that takes alot of<br/>
talent  plus math skills!    Thanks for writing  it<br/>
inspired me as I have only been homeschooling since<br/>

Your post was so familiar. My daughter started to read at about 3 1/2 and she reads very well - and most anything she gets her hands on. Most people feel I am doing this fabulous job homeschooling her - because she is &quot;excelling&quot; - However, my little ones 3, &4 have absolutey on interest in reading - other than being read to. This is fine with me. Although I do sometimes wonder if her early reading had a lot to do with the fact that it was just her in the beginning. My husband used to work 2nd shift and in the morning they would do puzzles and read together all the time - because that was what she wanted to do. Her favorite puzzle was the alphabet puzzle. The other two don&#39;t touch it with a ten foot pole! They play all kinds of things together - digging in the dirt, etc. yet it&#39;s my older daughter that always wants to read with me - or go to the library.  <br/>
<br/>
We just started unschooling this past December - and I am still unsure of myself. Reading here helps quite a bit - especially when I tend to stress about the days when we all seem to not &quot;do&quot; much. And sometimes it takes listening to everyone else describe different aspects of unschooling, and I will think - Hey we worked in the garden - that&#39;s science. We tried to find and catch frogs...or made cookies ( those fractions!)<br/>
<br/>
In any case, Welcome - I am sure you will find some useful posts here.<br/>

done is tell the person that we don&#39;t believe in grades but that he&#39;d be in <br/>
x grade if he were in school.  And at least around here that would be <br/>
true.  They don&#39;t fail kids and rarely double-promote.  They just keep them <br/>
in with their age group.  So a six year old would be in grade one.  A <br/>
twelve year old would be in grade seven, etc.<br/>

Hi Caroline,<br/>
<br/>
I can very much relate to what you wrote.  My daughter could write <br/>
her name at 2 1/2, which I thought was because her name is Emma and <br/>
easy to write.  However, over the next few months she could write the <br/>
whole alphabet and write simple words. Reading soon followed and by 4 <br/>
she was a fluent reader.  People ask me those questions too, about <br/>
when she learned to read, what she&#39;s reading, or worse, they ask her <br/>
what she&#39;s reading and don&#39;t believe her.  Then they want to know how <br/>
I taught her to read so young and I try (unsucessfully) to say I <br/>
didn&#39;t do anything.  It was all Emma&#39;s work.  From the time she was 2 <br/>
1/2 until she was 4 she was determined and tenacious.  She wanted to <br/>
make the connection between the words I was reading to her and the <br/>
letters that made up those words.  She practiced for hours writing.  <br/>
I didn&#39;t drill her, it was what she wanted to do.  When I read out <br/>
loud to her she stopped me all the time to ask about the words, <br/>
what&#39;s this word, where&#39;s that word.  I always stopped to tell her.  <br/>
There are people who dont pay attention to what their children are <br/>
learning and would consider a question during a story very rude, but <br/>
my thinking was the more questions the more learning. <br/>
<br/>
Her Kindergarten teacher made her the &quot;class helper&quot; which created <br/>
conflict with some of the other kids.  When they were writing Emma <br/>
would go around and show the kids the &quot;proper&quot; way to write.  This is <br/>
what the teacher wanted her to do.  She thought it helped everyone, <br/>
but it just made some of the children resentful of Emma.  Emma didn&#39;t <br/>
care, she loved being the teacher and to this day is a boss hog, <br/>
lol.  I&#39;m laughing in jest, because it now causes conflict at home <br/>
where I operated a home day care.  I have to explain that the <br/>
children are learning through practicing and getting it wrong and she <br/>
did the same thing.  In school they do not let children do that and <br/>
Emma spent a whole school year correcting children. <br/>
<br/>
I can sure relate to what you are going through and hope to hear more <br/>
from you.<br/>
