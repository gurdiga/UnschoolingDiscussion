<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143759052">The description of The Deluxe Transitive Vampire reminded me of a game my son and I saw at a software store the other day.<br/>
<br/>
It was called Typing of the Dead and seemed to be a typing instruction programme wrapped up as a zombie zapping game.  Players destroy the zombies by typing quickly and accurately.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s any good, but it struck my fancy.  Really silly and probably fun to develop.<br/>
