<br/>
Depending on the kid, &quot;Truly, Madly, Deeply&quot; could be good.  It&#39;s comforting <br/>
without being in any particular religious tradition.  A woman is grieving her <br/>
husband/partner&#39;s death, and he returns.  I really liked it.  It was <br/>
original, and touching.  Holly was able to watch it, but in parts, not all at <br/>
once (because it&#39;s a little slow).   Maybe it&#39;s too much talking for some <br/>
people&#39;s tastes, and there is some implied sex (I don&#39;t remember nudity, but <br/>
then I wouldn&#39;t).  There&#39;s also music, and that&#39;s great.  And there&#39;s humor.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Cure&quot; is a kid buddy-movie/adventure about a boy with AIDS and his next <br/>
door neighbor who comes to like him and decides to &quot;scientifically&quot; find a <br/>
cure for AIDS for him.  And they go on an adventure to find an AIDS doctor in <br/>
New Orleans (by starting in a stream in Minnesota or somewhere far north <br/>
where the Mississippi is small, and they have adventures on the way).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that would be comforting.  Might NOT be.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly couldn&#39;t think of anything.  <br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t much help, but might be up the road some.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-599704948">Hi Patti.  I would also like help with this one.  I remember being exactly<br/>
10 and having an uncontrollable fear of death come over me like a tidal wave<br/>

die alone.  My mother just told me I was being silly.  So, you can pretty<br/>
much guess I didn&#39;t bring it up again.  I don&#39;t remember how long it lasted<br/>

<h4>Have A Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>15 May 2003, at  9:51pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731982865">My 7 year old (soon 8) is going through this same thing right now.  She is worried about getting old and dying.  She is also worried about ME getting old and dying.<br/>
<br/>
I have been listening and reassuring her that I think as we get older, we become less afraid.  I believe in heaven, so we talk about that too.<br/>
<br/>
I sympathize (or is it empathize??) because I have ALWAYS had a fear of death (in spite of my beliefs).  Its only been recently that I have started to come to terms with the idea of growing old and dying.<br/>

Interesting...I don&#39;t think that&#39;s really true.  I know plenty of middle<br/>
aged and old people who are terrified.  And I &#39;ve visited cancer wards<br/>

*much* less fear than most people.<br/>

When my children asked questions about death and dying and what&#39;s after,<br/>
I often found myself saying, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  From there I asked them<br/>
what they thought about it.  One dd thought about these things<br/>
intensely....still does... and I try to listen to her.  Plus,  we read<br/>
some books like I mentioned in my other post....and more. I tried to<br/>
give her a broad perspective on what some other people think and believe<br/>
and hope...but mostly I tried to allow her to express herself and her<br/>
ideas and thoughts about it.  She came up with some beautiful thoughts.<br/>
And challenged me to look at what I believe more in depth.  <br/>
<br/>
One big difference is that she has never expressed a fear about death<br/>
and dying.  She,  in fact,  was excited about it for her Grammy and<br/>
Peepaw. (My mom died in Sept last year and my dad died nine days later<br/>
in Oct...so death, dying, illness,  etc has been a major theme in our<br/>
lives for awhile.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005875750">I asked my son.<br/>
We took care of my dad while he was dying from cancer.   A few months<br/>
later we brought my father in law here when his wife couldn&#39;t manage him<br/>
anymore.  He died from Alzheimer&#39;s disease two months later.<br/>
<br/>
My son was eight and just turning nine when he lived in the &quot;house of<br/>
death&quot; as my brother called it.<br/>
I have regretted putting my son through that every day since, but at the<br/>
time it seemed the best choice for these men who didn&#39;t want to be in a<br/>
hospital or nursing home somewhere, and who&#39;s wives didn&#39;t want them<br/>
there either. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan was right here every day for two months during my dad&#39;s final<br/>
illness.  He&#39;d hold his hand and talk to him, read him stories, draw him<br/>
pictures.  <br/>
<br/>
So I asked Dylan if he knew why a little child might be worried about it<br/>
and what a parent could do, but he said he didn&#39;t know.   He said no one<br/>
wants to dye or even think about the possibility but we can&#39;t change it.<br/>
He said he&#39;s not afraid now after seeing his grandfathers die.   My<br/>
fathers death was by no means peaceful, he was medicated out of his mind<br/>
on morphine the last weeks.   But however he managed it Dylan has come to<br/>
terms with it better than most of us.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe death and dying is just so vague and mysterious to these children,<br/>
like monsters or ghosts, there doesn&#39;t seem any way to understand it.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if you could find a friendly nurse from your local nursing home<br/>
who might explain how someone who is dying is taken care of?   Maybe<br/>
that&#39;s a terrible idea.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep thinking.  I&#39;m sorry for your little kid.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have been listening and reassuring her that I think as we get <br/>
older, we become less afraid.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I was little I was afraid of death because... ?  I don&#39;t know why.  It <br/>
might hurt or be scary.<br/>
<br/>
Now when I&#39;m afraid of death it&#39;s a whole different kind of fear.  I&#39;m afraid <br/>
if I die the things I&#39;ve borrowed won&#39;t get returned, or that my relatives <br/>
will be muttering evil things about me behind my dead back about what a <br/>
packrat I was and that if I had just given that stuff away or thrown it away <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t have to be sorting through it.  And I&#39;m afraid my kids would be <br/>
really sad and changed in negative ways forever.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told my kids that though some people have reasons to REALLY believe <br/>
certain things about the afterlife, nobody knows for sure, but that since so <br/>
many cultures have beliefs in spirits continuing one way or another, that it <br/>
could well be.  But whether they go somewhere and stay, or whether they go to <br/>
another plane, like another world, or whether the soul is reborn in another <br/>
body, I just don&#39;t know.  Even that vague stuff seems comforting.  They <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be all alone, and they might still have awareness.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118856677">My children have been going through this as well.  Their great great <br/>
grandparents have been ill and the discussion of dying has been brought up <br/>
on many occasions.  For a long time, I found myself saying &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, <br/>
to myself and them.  Strange as this may sound, The Lion King changed all <br/>
that for me.<br/>
<br/>
Remember the line, &quot;He lives in YOU,&quot;?  Suddenly, it began to make sense for <br/>
me.  At this point in my life, I identify as being agnostic.  I don&#39;t <br/>
believe in heaven or hell, but this really spoke to me in a time of deep <br/>
soul searching.<br/>
<br/>
I tell my children that Grannygirl and Pops (g-g-grandparents) believe that <br/>
when they die, they will go to heaven and that heaven is a happy place where <br/>
they won&#39;t hurt or be sad anymore.  I told them that Mommy and Daddy believe <br/>
that when we die, our spirits will live on in the hearts of people who love <br/>
us through the stories they tell about us and the things they remember.  We <br/>
talked about The Lion King and how Simba remembered Mufasa and heard his <br/>
voice in his heart.  I told them that Simba wasn&#39;t really seeing Mufasa in <br/>
the clouds, that those were his heart pictures.  Then we watched the movie <br/>
again which brought up even more discussion.  It was a very moving <br/>
experience to share with them.<br/>
<br/>
This brought up questions about my brother, Michael.  They wanted to know <br/>
why we buried Uncle Mike in the ground and what happened to his body.  We <br/>
talked about flowers and animals dying and how their bodies replenish the <br/>
earth and grow new life.  This lead us into a discussion about other faiths <br/>
and beliefs which the kids found very enlightening and interesting.  <br/>
Nicholette decided after all this discussion that everyone believes <br/>
basically the same thing.  That dying is scary to people who are alive <br/>
because they don&#39;t want to think about missing people they love so much but <br/>
after we die there is nothing to be afraid of.  My wise child told me that <br/>
she wants to make everyday special with Grannygirl and Pops so she will have <br/>
stories to tell the babies about them, since they are so young and might not <br/>
remember them and so Grannygirl and Pops will live forever.  I really liked <br/>
that.  I&#39;m facing the loss of them as well and it helped me to put the <br/>
situation in perspective.  I found myself wanting to pull away because the <br/>
closer we are to them, the harder their loss will be for us.  They live <br/>
right next door, so we see them everyday.  I realize that the more we are <br/>
with them the more heart stories we will have to carry their spirits with <br/>
us.  I am thankful that my precious daughter made that so clear to me.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know your beliefs, Patti, but perhaps this might be something you <br/>
can share with your children.  The more the kids and I discuss the topic of <br/>
death the more we begin to find ways to focus on making every day count, <br/>
which leads us closer to finding peace and further from fear.  We spend more <br/>
time now discussing ways to live for today and cherish every moment we have <br/>
together.  I hope this helps in some way. :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From: &quot;averyschmidt&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:patti.schmidt2@...">patti.schmidt2@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Do any of you have any insight as far as how to help a child (age<br/>
&gt; &gt; 10) who is intensely afraid of dying?  There&#39;s nothing in his life<br/>
&gt; &gt; right now specifically that has brought this on (nobody sick or<br/>
&gt; &gt; passed away recently).  I think it&#39;s just something that he&#39;s been<br/>
&gt; &gt; pondering lately- probably in part because we saw parts of the movie<br/>
&gt; &gt; My Girl which brought on lots of questions.  I remember being the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same age and having the same fears and questions for *my* mother and<br/>
&gt; &gt; only feeling worse the more information (or non-information as<br/>
&gt; &gt; in &quot;nobody knows&quot;) that I got.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is there a perspective on the mystery of death that could possibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; be comforting to a young child who&#39;s interested and worried?  Any<br/>
&gt; &gt; suggestions for books or movies that explore death in a sensitive<br/>
&gt; &gt; and comforting way?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I second the recommendation for &quot;The Fall of Freddie the Leaf&quot;. Both of my<br/>
kids have loved that book, and we lost my grandmother this month.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a gut feeling I have that says that at early ages, kids know<br/>
instinctively, perhaps from memory before being born, that dying is okay. My<br/>
daughter came in and announced yesterday &quot;When I get really, really old and<br/>
die, I want my body burned up so it can help some trees grow.&quot;. There was no<br/>
fear in that statement (she&#39;s 3). Obviously, we&#39;ve talked a bit about what<br/>
happened to grandma&#39;s body (cremation) lately.<br/>
I&#39;ve written before on this list about how both of my kids have told me<br/>
(each at the age of two) of their memories of hovering over DH&#39;s and my<br/>
wedding. I&#39;m fairly sure that there&#39;s no way they could&#39;ve made that up.<br/>
Neither of them had even seen a picture of our wedding at the age they told<br/>
me these things. I have a feeling that&#39;s one reason why they were not afraid<br/>
of death at those ages.<br/>
By the age of 10, however, kids are pretty fully incarnated in this world,<br/>
and the tenuous connections that they might&#39;ve had with whatever other realm<br/>
they came from must be thin or gone by about that age. Then they start to<br/>
realize their mortality, and since they don&#39;t have the younger child&#39;s<br/>
innate sense of peace about it, they feel fear. 10 is also the age when most<br/>
kids become very, very cognizant of their bodies. I doubt that this is a<br/>
coincidence.<br/>
If it was my kids, I guess I would re-tell them the stories they told me as<br/>
toddlers about having chosen to come down to life on this earth with DH and<br/>
I. I would think that it would give them some comfort to know that they came<br/>
from someplace else that they were not scared of at the time. With older<br/>
kids, I might even read some life-after-death books such as &quot;Embraced by the<br/>
Light&quot;. I know some people believe that those accounts are hokey, and I<br/>
can&#39;t say that I agree with every interpretation that&#39;s been put on the<br/>
afterlife, but there certainly is something compelling in knowing that<br/>
people who have died for brief periods of time almost universally come back<br/>
with no fear of death and with only joyous stories of what lies beyond.<br/>

the book.  My son always asks &quot;why he has to live with them?&quot;.  I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-951510291">In response to Glena and others:<br/>
<br/>
Glena,<br/>
Thanks you for your kind words.  I think I may have said this before (not <br/>
sure &lt;g&gt;) but I truly respect the fact that you are able to look past our <br/>
differences and be able to respond to me in this way.  I hope you understand <br/>
that while I may disagree with with you on some things, I find your ability <br/>
to look past those differences admirable.  I may come across as rude and <br/>
assuming at times, but I am attacking and debating the principles, not the <br/>
person.  I hope you understand that now or in any future &quot;bickering&quot; that <br/>
may occur that may occur between us....or anyone on this list for that <br/>
matter!<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers,<br/>
(This is not directed at anyone in particular...) I don&#39;t know a person yet <br/>
that hasn&#39;t made bad parenting choices at some point during their lives.  I <br/>
certainly have!   There will always be people we don&#39;t like and people we <br/>
do.   People we agree and disagree with.  What I find so wonderful about <br/>
this group is that even those that I may not choose to be &quot;friends&quot; with IRL <br/>
have wisdom and meaningful experiences to share.  I cannot think of a single <br/>
person in my life (friends and loved ones) that I haven&#39;t had disagreements <br/>
with, sometimes heated and downright rude.  Likewise, I haven&#39;t met an <br/>
&quot;enemy&quot; yet that didn&#39;t have something wise and meaningful to offer.<br/>
<br/>
If we can confront our inner demons, those things that cause us to feel <br/>
defensive, and look past the skin of a seemingly attacking or rude post, we <br/>
may find a bit of wisdom to ponder and guide us on to better parenting <br/>
paths.  It isn&#39;t important that we acknowledge our parenting mistakes to <br/>
others here, unless, of course, we choose to do so.  What IS so vitally <br/>
important is that we admit our mistakes to ourselves and our children and <br/>
make every effort to learn and recover from those mistakes.  If the end-all <br/>
is battling who said what, then what have we learned?  If the battle is <br/>
openeing eyes to the mistakes in who said what, then we can come away with <br/>
wisdom and strength to be better parents.  Better communicators.  Better <br/>
human beings.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Joy!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500111809">Patti,<br/>
<br/>
First,  I apologize for reading this thread somewhat &#39;backwards&#39;.  I<br/>
sent a few replies before reading your original post!<br/>
<br/>
AS we faced the illnesses and death of each of my parents,  each of my<br/>
dc had their own experiences.  My then 4yo dd was the most verbal and<br/>
the most.  It was easier in some ways because she always speaks her mind<br/>
and ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
The Freddie the Leaf Book was really cool for the eight and 10 yo.  I<br/>
have noticed my 8 yo dd has wrangled much more with some fears about<br/>
death as we have been on this journey.  She is the one who quietly wept<br/>
in her bed at night.  She is the one who,  recently, became terrified of<br/>
her younger siblings bathing because it made her think of Andrea Yates<br/>
and children being drowned.  (She heard about Andrea Yates at a friend&#39;s<br/>
house....that was definitely one news story Abby wouldn&#39;t handle<br/>
peacefully!)  And Abby is the one who recently became upset and cried<br/>
because seeing her younger brother reminded her of what she was like<br/>
when she was little (he&#39;s 2),  and she &quot;missed being little&quot;.  I have<br/>
hypothesized that she misses the relative safety she had...that maybe<br/>
being older and more aware of the power and mystery of death is scarier.<br/>
Or maybe that getting older means being closer to death.<br/>
<br/>
We are still working through much of this.  Death IS powerful...And<br/>
mysterious.  And in addition to their own experiences,  they have<br/>
watched me cope with the power and mystery of complicated grief.<br/>
<br/>
It sure has given me occasion to look at what I believe about death,<br/>
life, eternity.  And it&#39;s certainly a growing process....at this point I<br/>
couldn&#39;t say where it will lead me and the little ones here.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you well in looking at this with your child,<br/>
Susan<br/>

pondering lately- probably in part because we saw parts of the movie <br/>
My Girl which brought on lots of questions.  I remember being the <br/>
same age and having the same fears and questions for *my* mother and <br/>
only feeling worse the more information (or non-information as <br/>
in &quot;nobody knows&quot;) that I got.<br/>
Is there a perspective on the mystery of death that could possibly <br/>
be comforting to a young child who&#39;s interested and worried?  Any <br/>
suggestions for books or movies that explore death in a sensitive <br/>
and comforting way?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Patti<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959278774">&lt;&lt;  I hope<br/>
 someone has some wonderful insight on this.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I simply explained to my child what I believed.  I talked to him about the <br/>
changing seasons, how the leaves and flowers die and then when the season is <br/>
right, they come back.  I told him I believed that there was part of each <br/>
human being, not the boy named Alex, but part of him, that never dies, that <br/>
comes back like the leaves on the trees.  I asked him if the tree looks dead <br/>
in the winter, and he said yes, and I asked him if it then comes back alive <br/>
in the spring?  He said, &quot;Oh, it doesn&#39;t die, it just seems like it until <br/>
spring!&quot;     I told him that I believed humans were the same, that we seem <br/>
dead, but really, part of us lives on until the right time, or season.  <br/>
<br/>
This is my personal spiritiual belief, and I don&#39;t know if it helps at all <br/>
with your child, but the familiarization of the concept of change can help <br/>
with death issues, I think.  <br/>

At the risk of being completely goofy, I think that may be one of the <br/>
reasons there are so many different types of people and so many different <br/>
perspectives.  Who&#39;d have looked upon disagreements and discord as <br/>
insightful gifts?<br/>
<br/>
Well, frankly, this is a hard one for me to remember, because my first <br/>
reaction is often defensiveness.  But, if for no other reason then for <br/>
Liam&#39;s sake (but definitely for my own growth, too), it would be helpful <br/>
for me to pin this little gem up on the wall and try to keep it in the <br/>
front of my mind so that I can live it and, as I had once heard, be what I <br/>
hope to see my son to become.<br/>

be happy with the time we do have.<br/>
If we can control it, by all means, put effort into making it <br/>
positive.  If not...don&#39;t worry, be happy.  <br/>

about the sun shine then worrying about the rain, then worrying about <br/>
the end of summer when she knew they would all die.  The other flower <br/>
next to her was joyful and full of awe in everything that life had to <br/>
offer, but the other flower kept on worrying about what was to come. <br/>
In the end, all the flowers die.  The ones who appreciated <br/>
everything, accepted their death.  The one that worried, regretted <br/>

growing up away from being known by everyone as the one who defeated<br/>
Voldemort so that&#39;s why he was raised by Muggles, rather than his father&#39;s<br/>
side of the family. (If there were any at the time. There don&#39;t seem to be<br/>
any now since no one has come forward. Though maybe there&#39;s a reason there<br/>
are none or they haven&#39;t come forward.) Though it doesn&#39;t explain why the<br/>
Dursleys in particular.<br/>
<br/>
At some later point Dumbledore remarks that Harry would be safe (from<br/>
Voldemort) with the Dursleys because they&#39;re blood relatives. So I think<br/>
something else will be revealed later about why Harry is safe (relatively<br/>
speaking) there and also perhaps why Voldemort perhaps *couldn&#39;t* come back<br/>
until Harry left the protection of the Dursleys and reentered the world of<br/>
witches and wizards.<br/>

&quot;<br/>

<br/>
And here&#39;s another one that was posted to the Canadian homeschooling list a<br/>
while back:<br/>
<br/>
Buscaglia, Leo.  &quot;The Fall of Freddy the Leaf&quot;<br/>
Burningham, John.  &quot;Grandpa&quot;.<br/>
    someone said it is wordless, extremely eloquent.<br/>
DePaola.  &quot;Nana Upstairs, Nana Downstairs&quot;<br/>
Marisabine, Russo.  &quot;Grandpa Abe&quot;<br/>
    someone found this good for a five year old, not scary, very loving<br/>
Miles, Miska.  &quot;Annie & The Old One&quot;<br/>
Schneider, Antonie.  &quot;Good-Bye, Vivi!&quot;<br/>
    supposed a good book for death of grand parent and methods of<br/>
    dealing with it.  for ages 4-8<br/>
Turner, Barbara.  &quot;A Little Bit of Rob&quot;<br/>
    someone said it is a picture book that deals with sibling death<br/>
    and is comforting<br/>
Varley.  &quot;Badger&#39;s Parting Gift&quot;<br/>
    (Ruthann talking here....We rather like this one.)<br/>
Viorst.  &quot;10th Good Thing About Barney&quot;<br/>
Wilhelm.  &quot;I&#39;ll Always Love You&quot;<br/>
Yolen, Jane.  &quot;Grandpa Bill&#39;s Song&quot;<br/>
One family found a great comfort in the coloring book<br/>
&quot;When Someone Special Dies.&quot;<br/>
Two children&#39;s books you might find helpful in dealing with the possible<br/>
loss of your beloved pet are:<br/>
    &quot;Cat Heaven&quot; by Cynthia Rylant<br/>
    &quot;For Every Cat an Angel&quot; by Christine Davis<br/>
or alternately, by same authors:<br/>
    &quot;Dog Heaven&quot;<br/>
    &quot;For Every Dog an Angel&quot;<br/>
Nadia the Willful.  by Sue Alexander  (it&#39;s an old book, found it in the<br/>
library)<br/>
This story tells about different reactions to grief told through the eyes of<br/>
a Nadia, whose family has lost her beloved oldest brother, and teaches us<br/>
that the ones we love live on in our hearts.<br/>
A favorite of one person, one that she always used to suggest when she<br/>
ran a bookstore- &quot;Everett Anderson&#39;s Goodbye&quot;, by Lucille Clifton. It&#39;s in<br/>
picture-book form, but is really an illustrated poem about the seven stages<br/>
of grief, and is appropriate for almost ANY age, including adults.<br/>
&quot;The Magic Moth&quot; by Virginia Lee(?). Told from the point of view of a five<br/>
or<br/>
six year old.<br/>
<br/>
Hope these help somebody.  I can remember that fear at about the same age.<br/>
It&#39;s really powerful and scary.<br/>
Tia<br/>
<br/>

Buscaglia, Leo. &quot;The Fall of Freddy the Leaf&quot;<br/>
Burningham, John. &quot;Grandpa&quot;.<br/>
     someone said it is wordless, extremely eloquent.<br/>
DePaola. &quot;Nana Upstairs, Nana Downstairs&quot;<br/>
Marisabine, Russo. &quot;Grandpa Abe&quot;<br/>
     someone found this good for a five year old, not scary, very loving<br/>
Miles, Miska. &quot;Annie & The Old One&quot;<br/>
Schneider, Antonie. &quot;Good-Bye, Vivi!&quot;<br/>
     supposed a good book for death of grand parent and methods of<br/>
     dealing with it. for ages 4-8<br/>
Turner, Barbara. &quot;A Little Bit of Rob&quot;<br/>
     someone said it is a picture book that deals with sibling death<br/>
     and is comforting<br/>
Varley. &quot;Badger&#39;s Parting Gift&quot;<br/>
     (Ruthann talking here....We rather like this one.)<br/>
Viorst. &quot;10th Good Thing About Barney&quot;<br/>
Wilhelm. &quot;I&#39;ll Always Love You&quot;<br/>
Yolen, Jane. &quot;Grandpa Bill&#39;s Song&quot;<br/>
One family found a great comfort in the coloring book<br/>
&quot;When Someone Special Dies.&quot;<br/>
Two children&#39;s books you might find helpful in dealing with the possible<br/>
loss of your beloved pet are:<br/>
     &quot;Cat Heaven&quot; by Cynthia Rylant<br/>
     &quot;For Every Cat an Angel&quot; by Christine Davis<br/>
or alternately, by same authors:<br/>
     &quot;Dog Heaven&quot;<br/>
     &quot;For Every Dog an Angel&quot;<br/>
Nadia the Willful. by Sue Alexander (it&#39;s an old book, found it in the<br/>
library)<br/>
This story tells about different reactions to grief told through the eyes of<br/>
a Nadia, whose family has lost her beloved oldest brother, and teaches us<br/>
that the ones we love live on in our hearts.<br/>
A favorite of one person, one that she always used to suggest when she<br/>
ran a bookstore- &quot;Everett Anderson&#39;s Goodbye&quot;, by Lucille Clifton. It&#39;s in<br/>
picture-book form, but is really an illustrated poem about the seven stages<br/>
of grief, and is appropriate for almost ANY age, including adults.<br/>
&quot;The Magic Moth&quot; by Virginia Lee(?). Told from the point of view of a five<br/>
or<br/>
six year old.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope these help somebody. I can remember that fear at about the same age.<br/>
It&#39;s really powerful and scary.<br/>

I have the opposite problem with DS.  We&#39;ve made daddy out as having such a <br/>
good time *on the other side,* that Hayden is absolutely NOT afraid to die.  <br/>
He had a breathing issue going thru the mountains in Colorado on our vacation <br/>
and I was reminding him to breathe deep.  &quot;So I won&#39;t die?&quot;  &quot;yeah, so you <br/>
won&#39;t die&quot; &quot;Oh, it&#39;s okay if I die mommy, I&#39;ll go live with daddy&quot;  I think I <br/>
flew down the ding dang mountain to get that boy oxygen ~ I felt/feel very <br/>
conflicted about it, we worked really hard for them to accept the reality of <br/>
death and we came up with some incredible wisdom about what happens after <br/>
your body dies, but I didn&#39;t expect them to *embrace* death ... <br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I&#39;ve not found many good books for children regarding death ... <br/>
maybe you&#39;ll get some enlightening responses and we&#39;ll have to collectively <br/>
write that book!! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I want to share that I lay all of my known options out there for the kids.  <br/>
We talk of Heaven, filled with all the things and people that Mitch loved <br/>
[they serve beer at the taco bell in heaven&lt;bg&gt;].  The Grandfathers, the <br/>
spirits of all the fathers and mothers who are available to us with wisdom <br/>
and protection, on *the other side.*  We also talk of the *nirvana* aspect, <br/>
becoming one with the cosmic force.  Then there&#39;s reincarnation, that we will <br/>
meet Daddy&#39;s spirit again, though there is no longer a *Mitch* he will be a <br/>
different person this time.  We discuss at great lengths the purpose of our <br/>
individual life, why we are human instead of animals, etc, etc, etc...  I <br/>
tell them I don&#39;t have all the answers, just enough to make me continue <br/>
questioning :)  <br/>
