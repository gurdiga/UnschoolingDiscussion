<div id="ygrps-yiv-487953864">Hey fellow posters!<br/>
<br/>
You all were so helpful with my email a month or so ago regarding dyslexia, <br/>
I hope you can help this friend.  She is on my bipolar homeschooling <br/>
e-list.  Bipolar kids often have particular cognitive problems that really <br/>
effect their learning math.  Have any of you had any similar experiences <br/>
and ideas that might help Dorothy?  We would both appreciate any <br/>
suggestions you might have.  I know she is just tearing her hair out!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!!  Christina in Seattle<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Kristin, I am very impressed about your 15yo learning multiplication <br/>
and division. My 16yo still can&#39;t do either. We&#39;re doing a Survival Skills <br/>
math course, and it&#39;s just killing him. Simple things like keeping a check <br/>
register, or reading a bank statement, are incomprehensible. He just <br/>
learned a couple of years ago to know the months of the year in order, and <br/>
now he sees a banks statement with a date like 06-24-02 and he just freaks! <br/>
I explained what it means, and if he counts them off on his fingers he can <br/>
do it, but it makes him furious because he feels like they&#39;re &quot;tricking&quot; him.<br/>
<br/>
And of course, aside from math, he&#39;s very bright, very verbal. I have him <br/>
signed up next month to take his PSATs, but who am I kidding? AS bright as <br/>
he is, this math thing is going to keep him from doing everything. How can <br/>
he go to college? How can he even do vo-tech stuff, if he cannot subtract <br/>
38-12? How can he have any job if he can&#39;t remember what time it is, or <br/>
what day it is, or what month comes next? Some days I just despair!<br/>
<br/>
