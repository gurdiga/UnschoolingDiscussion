<div id="ygrps-yiv-230356024">Last night we watched School of Rock on DVD. The kids loved it.<br/>
 Jesse air-guitared and drummed alternatively for the last 10-15 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a great unschooling movie! Has anyone seen it?<br/>
Very funny too, in a Jack Black kind of way.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We saw it in the theater and thought the same thing.  Very cool.  :)  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Before seeing the movie, my dd kind-of wanted to learn the electric guitar.  After the movie, my dd now has an electric guitar.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We loved Jack Black&#39;s passion throughout the movie. And all the old classic rock in it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Oh,  and we had to buy it so we could watch it over and over. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>

guitar.  After the movie, my dd now has an electric guitar.  &lt;g&gt;***<br/>
<br/>
Today Mia (5) has asked for an electric guitar and Jacob (8) asked if I<br/>
could buy him an old set of drums for his birthday (not till July &lt;g&gt;). It<br/>
will have to go on the list of things to get along with a video camera. Jess<br/>
(10) wants to make a movie. Maybe they could make a music video.<br/>
<br/>
Mia has made a mini stage in the form of an old chest which she stands on to<br/>
sing. Mostly Eminem. I can see her asking for ACDC soon.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago we would have boycotted the movie on the basis of the low<br/>
level coarse language warning. What a shame that would have been. Jess has<br/>
been trying out ass the last couple of weeks. He said it to Mark yesterday,<br/>
who didn&#39;t lose his cool but patiently explained that we are Australian so<br/>
it&#39;s arse young man, arse. Draco Malfoy style. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
