<div id="ygrps-yiv-422892881">Is it appropriate to write cosmic coincidences on the list if they pertain<br/>
to former posts? Yesterday was quite remarkable. First, someone mentions<br/>
Burning Man on the list (Burning Man is an event that happens in the summer<br/>
in the desert every year where people come and build a huge self-sustaining<br/>
art &quot;town&quot; where everyone contributes something. It becomes a 10,000 person<br/>
town complete with supermarket and post office). Then I posted about the<br/>
indie documentary &quot;Nothing Without You&quot; about a man who goes to Burning Man<br/>
with nothing, including clothes, to see how far human generosity will go.<br/>
Two hours later, I get an email from the man who made the documentary<br/>
&quot;Nothing Without You&quot;...out of the blue. I have never received an email from<br/>
him before. I haven&#39;t even spoken about this film for many months. So then I<br/>
email him about this &quot;coincidence&quot; and he emails me back,<br/>
&quot;Yes...that was a coincidence......Though I just saw the film &quot;What the<br/>
*&%$# Do We Know?&quot; ....so maybe it wasn&#39;t a coincidence.&quot; !!! We just talked<br/>
about this small indie film on the list as well!<br/>
<br/>
It really seemed important to share this, though maybe it wasn&#39;t. I do<br/>
recommend both movies for unschooling families (or all families), as each<br/>
tells a story that promotes thinking outside the &quot;box&quot;.<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Jacki<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141846673">I wanted to see that - I&#39;ll have to catch it here in Colorado or when I am<br/>
in NY. I&#39;ve heard about it - it was designed to test the gift-economy at<br/>
burning man but caused some controversy as one of the other points in the<br/>
burning man temporary culture is radical self-reliance, and showing up with<br/>
nothing for your own survival is not at all self-reliant. Further, as a<br/>
member of that community myself, I think it&#39;s one of the most exciting<br/>
lessons in community, culture, and an immersion in the actual development of<br/>
a society. The burning man experience changes as its numbers increase. There<br/>
is dissent and creative impulse gives way to rules as the growth indicates<br/>
needs for safety and other concerns. The experience really gets people<br/>
talking about what makes a society run, and which of our rules are needed<br/>
vs. which are not. <br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of the process art of Cristo and Jean Claude - going into a<br/>
community and creating some extreme change but the real art is the process<br/>
that has to happen to make the creativity possible - the people in the<br/>
community and how their understanding changes. Burning Man also offers this<br/>
exploration of the definition of process art - one which eludes many outside<br/>
the art community.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Issues of individual freedom vs. interdependent community building, rules<br/>
vs. expression, personal responsibility, alternative energy, alternative<br/>
commerce, and much more are brought out from the hidden architecture and<br/>
made points of discussion by their rawness as the experiment grows. I highly<br/>
suggest everyone try it at least one year to experience that. I would<br/>
caution that the community standards lean heavily toward freedom and might<br/>
be too much for some people or for some parent&#39;s ideas about what their<br/>
children should  be exposed to and at what ages. Radical unschoolers<br/>
shouldn&#39;t have much of a problem but I would have to point out that there is<br/>
a heavy sexual and nudity content and there are drugs (although they are not<br/>
as open as the sexuality and nudity.) There is no way to create an event<br/>
this size devoted to radical self-expression and not have these things be a<br/>
part of it. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested, I&#39;m heavily involved with KidsCamp at burning man -<br/>
a sort of subset that is involved but a little more protected from some of<br/>
the outside freedoms to make it a little easier for families with children<br/>
to experience this radical experiment - and I&#39;d gladly put you in touch with<br/>
the mayor and help you to set up a trip for next year. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932455521">Oh boy - burning man and coincidences or serendipity go hand in hand for me.<br/>
For the record - this year we had 35,000 people at burning man. That&#39;s a<br/>
5,000 person increase from last year too. <br/>
<br/>
My most interesting experiences there have been with the kind of<br/>
serendipitous moments you are describing. So how did he contact you? We can<br/>
take this off-list if it&#39;s not interesting to anyone else - but I&#39;ve been<br/>
thinking a lot about the relationship between freedom and creativity and<br/>
whatever the life-force is that allows serendipity to rule. Perhaps a<br/>
fear-based, rules oriented society damages our ability to focus this strange<br/>
energy we share. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875873255">&quot;Nothing Without You&quot; does show the man naked, but in no other way than his<br/>
humble self. No sex or drugs are shown (well, there may have been something<br/>
passed around a circle of people, but it wasn&#39;t highlighted, and it may not<br/>
have even happened). There might be swearing, I don&#39;t remember. It has lots<br/>
of quieter talk and moments, that may be boring for a 5.5 yo to be<br/>
interested in, but I don&#39;t recall anything disturbing (I watched it with my<br/>
15 yo, so my younger child eyes weren&#39;t on...sorry!). I have been trying to<br/>
get a copy of the movie, but alas it is not for sale, so the only way to see<br/>
it now is on the indie film festival circuit.<br/>
<br/>
If you were by chance talking about the movie &quot;What the @#$%&* Do We Know?&quot;,<br/>
that has sex, drunkedness, and deep depression in it (along with lots of<br/>
inspiring things). I was a little uncomfortable with my 10 yo seeing it, but<br/>
the message came through well, and it seemed okay by the end. I mention this<br/>
because earlier I encouraged families to see it, and didn&#39;t qualify it with<br/>
some of the stuff that may not be great for younger ones to see.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222642708">FYI  Burning man has a café at center camp that sells coffee and a camp<br/>
arctica which sells ice. My understanding is that these concessions fund<br/>
Gerlach high-school programs and succeed in making the locals in the area<br/>
amenable to 35,000 strange people pouring through their town every year.<br/>
Theres also a burner sponsored and/or supported movement to save the<br/>
Gerlach water tower. Other than the two concessions, there is nothing for<br/>
sale at burning man once you enter the gates. Everyone is supposed to bring<br/>
everything they need to survive for a week  including food and all their<br/>
water  approximately 2.5 gallons per person/ per day. In addition, this is<br/>
a gift economy and participants are encouraged to freely give of themselves<br/>
to other participants. These facts create an immediate lesson on the value<br/>
of independence and its eventual evolution to interdependence as there<br/>
really is no way that anyone new to this can possibly foresee what will be<br/>
necessary for seven days in such a harsh climate. There is some barter but<br/>
the preferred culture is gift based. Its truly one of the most amazing<br/>
experiments in which Ive taken part and you can only scratch the surface in<br/>
understanding it until you experience it yourself. <br/>
