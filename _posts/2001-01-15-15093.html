<div id="ygrps-yiv-455868928">Hello! :-)<br/>
I&#39;ve been on the list for a bit now, just lurking, but loving all the topics<br/>
and discussions! I don&#39;t get to read all the posts, so I&#39;ve been reluctant<br/>
to jump in until now. Now I have an idea, and I need help. For starters, I<br/>
wanted to respond to the request for homeschool books: My favorite, one I<br/>
tell anyone who will listen to read, is the Art of Education. Excellent,<br/>
excellent, it clinched our decision to take our then 9 year old out of p.s.<br/>
Also, the Unschooling Handbook is very good, fun to read, and it has lots of<br/>
ideas. Once you&#39;ve decided, Homeschooling the MiddleYears was very helpful.<br/>
I hope these help. Of course, this book depends on the ages of your children<br/>
;-)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;From: &quot;Ashley&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:aharvie@...">aharvie@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What titles<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;would you all recommend for someone who is just beginning to learn about<br/>
&gt; &gt;homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Second and third, I am in need of some help.<br/>
To begin, what does anyone have to say about motivation? My two boys, 7 and<br/>
the oldest just turning 11 today, are unmotivated. I worry that it is the tv<br/>
and video games, but I don&#39;t allow them to play or watch during the &quot;school<br/>
day.&quot; We are basically an unschooling family, though, and we don&#39;t have<br/>
regimented routines. Do you think we need them? Our oldest takes German and<br/>
a computer skills class at a local homeschool family center, but that&#39;s the<br/>
extent of our routine. We used to be signed up for activities like P.E. (at<br/>
the local YMCA, it was a brand new &quot;homeschool class.&quot;) and gymnastics. It<br/>
seemed like there were a lot of complaints about having to go. But when<br/>
we&#39;re home, there is no interest for anything, and my ideas don&#39;t usually go<br/>
over very well. When I try to do my own thing, fighting erupts. Do I<br/>
actually have to take them by the hand, pick it up, and put it on the pen,<br/>
draw it on the paper.......and on and on???  I just don&#39;t know what to do. I<br/>
am basically unable to &quot;make&quot; them do anything, not that I really want to<br/>
force them into anything anyways. I want their interests to lead us, but<br/>
it&#39;s just that they&#39;re not leading us anywhere! heh heh  Any help with this<br/>
issue is greatly appreciated.<br/>
Ok, now here&#39;s a more personal topic, and one I am not entirely comfortable<br/>
discussing. The problem is, our 11 yo ds year old wakes up nearly every<br/>
night in the middle of the night and wakes me up, and asks me to sleep with<br/>
him. If  I don&#39;t, he will get back up 2x, 3x, in a row, and keep asking.<br/>
Usually I just get up and go instantly, because luckily I can go back to<br/>
sleep very easily, and also because once my dh is awake, he can&#39;t go back to<br/>
sleep (and he can be very touchy about this in the middle of the night with<br/>
work the next day looming on the horizon, if you get my drift.). My dh asked<br/>
me the other day if I didn&#39;t think it was weird our 11 year old asked his<br/>
mom to sleep with him every night. I said I didn&#39;t; I don&#39;t want there to be<br/>
anything weird about it, and I hope that if I don&#39;t imply there isn&#39;t a<br/>
problem with it, then there won&#39;t be. Does that make sense? But I know that<br/>
dh thinks it&#39;s weird (just fyi, we&#39;re not entirely &quot;functional,&quot; so it&#39;s not<br/>
always easy to talk about these things!). I have to admit, I have not been<br/>
able to talk to a dr. about it since ds was little. He has always gotten me<br/>
up in the night to sleep with him, so this is not new. I desperately need<br/>
help here. I am hoping this isn&#39;t a &quot;psychological&quot; problem, but I admit<br/>
that I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d keep doing it this long, either. We&#39;ve tried the<br/>
talks before bed, no drinking or eating just before bed, going to the<br/>
bathroom, we&#39;ve discussed what to do instead of waking me up, i.e. reading.<br/>
Oh, incidentally, he is terrible at going to bed, too! He gets up on average<br/>
5x before falling asleep! We&#39;ve tried later bed times, more activity, oh, I<br/>
don&#39;t know. Like I said, I really don&#39;t mind; I go back to sleep just fine.<br/>
What I do mind, is the thought of him on a psychiatrist&#39;s chair when he&#39;s 30<br/>
talking about sleeping with his mother! Any ideas here?<br/>
Ok, that&#39;s it. Sorry about the novel-length posting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-349098398">Hi Casey<br/>
Welcome!<br/>
I just thought THat I would respond to a couple of points. Sorry for<br/>
snipping you post to bits, but I now that I won&#39;t have tome to address<br/>
everything...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Second and third, I am in need of some help.<br/>
&gt; To begin, what does anyone have to say about motivation?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only thing I would say is that you cannot motivate somebody else.<br/>
<br/>
 My two boys, 7 and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the oldest just turning 11 today, are unmotivated. I worry that it is the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>tv<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and video games, but I don&#39;t allow them to play or watch during the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;school<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>TV and video games can really motivate people you know.  I know of so many<br/>
boys whose parents worried about lack of motivation but their dedication to<br/>
their children&#39;s autonomy meant that they didn&#39;t try to interfere.  They<br/>
still made suggestions, invitations, and were available, but didn&#39;t stop<br/>
what was going on in the children&#39;s heads.  I have seen games turn into so<br/>
much creativity.  Whole civiisations being created, trading cards beign<br/>
designed, enactments of videos,  and I have seen what appeared to be just<br/>
plain laziness.  My opinion is that it is okay.  Once anybody finds<br/>
something which motivates them, they are on it, they do it. Kids don&#39;t need<br/>
to practice anything by doing stuff that is boring or that they hate, just<br/>
so they will be ready later in life to do what they want to do .<br/>
<br/>
We are basically an unschooling family, though, and we don&#39;t have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; regimented routines. Do you think we need them?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think most children need them.  If your children did, they would ask<br/>
or at least resopnd positivley when you suggested it.  Perhaps you need a<br/>
more regimented routine.  DO you get to do enough of the things that are<br/>
important to you.  If you realize your own goals, that is the best lesson<br/>
that you children can learn.  If they see you doing something you want to<br/>
do, making it happen, then they will learn that when it is thier turn, they<br/>
can do the same, and you will be there to help them.<br/>
<br/>
Our oldest takes German and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a computer skills class at a local homeschool family center, but that&#39;s<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; extent of our routine. We used to be signed up for activities like P.E.<br/>

&gt; actually have to take them by the hand, pick it up, and put it on the pen,<br/>
&gt; draw it on the paper.......and on and on???  I just don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the hardest lesson that many of are learning as unschoolers is to be<br/>
patient.  I want to do things all the time, to them, for them, etc.  But I<br/>
have to sit back and bite my tongue, and wait to be asked.  I want them to<br/>
know that I trust in their abilities, and i want them to trust that I will<br/>
be here to help.<br/>
 I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; am basically unable to &quot;make&quot; them do anything, not that I really want to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Let your interests lead you for a while. Maybe they will follow.   You can<br/>
aways turn around and follow them when they do find somthing that sounds<br/>
good for them.<br/>
<br/>
 Any help with this<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; issue is greatly appreciated.<br/>
 </span></blockquote> I t is hard not doing anything.  But sooner or later you will look back and<br/>
make a list of all that they have done, and go &quot;WOW&quot; .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352263068">Hi Casey,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your suggestions about homeschooling books. My dd is only 19<br/>
months old, so I have plenty of time to do all of this reading :).<br/>
<br/>
Did you ever have a family bed with your 11-year-old or any of your other<br/>
children? My first thought is that if you didn&#39;t, your son may not feel<br/>
completely comfortable being alone all night. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything<br/>
wrong at all with him wanting you to sleep by him, and I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll<br/>
suffer major psychological damage because of it :). Does he have his own<br/>
room or does he share one with his brother? Perhaps it would help him to be<br/>
in the same room with his brother if he isn&#39;t already? Or how about bringing<br/>
in a mattress or small bed or futon so he can sleep in your bedroom? I get<br/>
the impression that your dh might not be too keen on that, but perhaps that<br/>
would help?<br/>

helps him sleep and makes him feel safe and secure, that&#39;s good and <br/>
important. I highly doubt that sleeping with you is going to make him feel <br/>
the need to go to a psychiatrist when he&#39;s 30. And eventually he will grow <br/>
out of it. I did! FYI, I am only fourteen years old. I slept with my mom <br/>
until recently actually, when I was little I was scared of the dark and I <br/>
would cry and work myself into a state and sleeping with my parents made me <br/>
feel safer. More recently, I know that I -could- have slept alone, but I <br/>
-liked- to sleep with Mama. It made me feel secure knowing she was there <br/>
next to me. I&#39;m none the worse for it and now I sleep by myself all the <br/>
time. I know I&#39;m young, obviously not a parent, and that some people would <br/>
pay no attention to my opinion because of it, but I hope my experience helps <br/>

&gt;You know, I wish I could remember the web address for the Natural Child<br/>
&gt;Project. It has tons of essays(many written by psychiatrists!) about the<br/>
&gt;benefits of co-sleeping, late breast feeding, and topics of the like. We<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t know anything about this when I slept with my parents, I found their<br/>
&gt;website when I was searching for information about unschooling(just over a<br/>
&gt;year ago). Before that I didn&#39;t have a name for it or think about any of <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;benefits-I just felt safe sleeping with Mama and Daddy! -Ren<br/>

Actually I think having your child sleep with you is a <br/>
good thing. If it <br/>
helps him sleep and makes him feel safe and secure, <br/>
that&#39;s good and <br/>
important. I highly doubt that sleeping with you is <br/>
going to make him feel <br/>
the need to go to a psychiatrist when he&#39;s 30. And <br/>
eventually he will grow <br/>
out of it. I did! FYI, I am only fourteen years old. I <br/>
slept with my mom <br/>
until recently actually, when I was little I was scared <br/>
of the dark and I <br/>
would cry and work myself into a state and sleeping <br/>
with my parents made me <br/>
feel safer. More recently, I know that I -could- have <br/>
slept alone, but I <br/>
-liked- to sleep with Mama. It made me feel secure <br/>
knowing she was there <br/>
next to me. I&#39;m none the worse for it and now I sleep <br/>
by myself all the <br/>
time. I know I&#39;m young, obviously not a parent, and <br/>
that some people would <br/>
pay no attention to my opinion because of it, but I <br/>
hope my experience helps <br/>
you.<br/>
love, Ren Mills<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-772493832">You know, I&#39;m glad you posted that too, Ren. You seem<br/>
like a very cool beans mature person.<br/>
I slept with my parents for a long time,too, though I<br/>
can&#39;t say an age cuz I got my own bed and room at some<br/>
point. I guess I always had them, really, since I was<br/>
little. And there were a few times that they would<br/>
really try to make me stay in them,----as a grown-up I<br/>
think I now understand WHY they needed a little &quot;alone<br/>
time&quot;, though.;) yuck. did I just say that about my<br/>
parents? ----but even then, they would lay down with<br/>
me in my bed until I fell asleep and then sneak off.<br/>
:) -&gt; and all I can say about those times is, well, it<br/>
frankly hurt my feelings. And I was scared. Not just<br/>
of the dark, of everything. monsters, ghosts,<br/>
burgulars, earthquakes, flies, trees, dying, etc, etc.<br/>
 I thought what if something happens in the middle of<br/>
the night, what if a burgular comes in my window? what<br/>
if I hear a noise or have a bad dream, and I&#39;m not<br/>
allowed to come in there? How horrifying. They<br/>
realized it though and always made sure I knew I could<br/>
come in there if I wanted to. My mom is very<br/>
claustraphobic though and I liked to entwine myself<br/>
with whoever I slept with by throwing my legs over<br/>
them, so eventually I just slept on dad&#39;s side. :) But<br/>
this continued til I was around 11, I think. Not all<br/>
the time every night, but sometimes I would wake up, <br/>
even when i was 13 or 14 and just instinctively want<br/>
to go in their room. I got teased, especially when it<br/>
happened a couple of times that i would have friends<br/>
over to spend the night and i would somehow end up at<br/>
the foot of my parents bed, I guess I went there half<br/>
asleep. And i really did want to sleep on my own but<br/>
it was just so scary to me, so I started choosing to<br/>
just bring a pillow and blanket and lay on the floor<br/>
in their room when i woke up, and then it was at thier<br/>
doorway, then my room just somehow seemed safer than<br/>
the hallway, so it was back in there, eventually i got<br/>
to where i was satisfied with just going in there,<br/>
looking at them and going back to bed. or staying up<br/>
reading till I passed out, cuz I knew realistically I<br/>
was just too big to fit. :) (after the at least<br/>
walking in there part, though. I think I would still<br/>
do that if it were possible. lol)<br/>
But I agree with Ren, it made me feel very secure and<br/>
safe to know i was welcome there, no matter what my<br/>
friends and my parents friends said. :)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m so glad you posted and gave us your perspective<br/>
&gt; as a person who did<br/>
&gt; cosleep with her parents. As a parent, my instincts<br/>
&gt; tell me it&#39;s the right<br/>
&gt; thing to do and there&#39;s research to back that up.<br/>
&gt; But it&#39;s so nice to hear<br/>
