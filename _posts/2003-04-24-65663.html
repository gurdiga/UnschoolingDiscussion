I wanted to say that my baby, my son, didn&#39;t really talk til he was about 3. When you&#39;re the baby, why would ya need to? I assumed he would, he did and does...my 2 cents.<br/>

LOL!  That&#39;s what I keep telling everyone!  (And myself occasionally!)  My <br/>
husband and I were talking about this last night (he&#39;s worried) and I told <br/>
him I bet he will rue the day he ever complained!  Our 2 yr old and 6 yr old <br/>
talk our heads off!  My friends son didn&#39;t talk until right after his second <br/>
birthday, then he came up to her one day and said, &#39;I wanna go to Grandma&#39;s <br/>
house!&#39;.  I was on the ohone with her when he said it.  It was SO funny!  He <br/>
had only ever said Mama before and that was it!  I expect that Caeleb, too, <br/>
will bypass single and double word sentences for paragraphs.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the comments.  Sometimes, after a long spell of my husband&#39;s <br/>
doubts, I begin to doubt myself and just need some reassurance.  The baby <br/>
was up all night last night, so I guess I had a LOT of time on my hands to <br/>
worry about everything!<br/>
