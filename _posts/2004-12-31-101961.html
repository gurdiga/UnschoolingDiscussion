<div id="ygrps-yiv-106300518">Hello all, a little update,<br/>
<br/>
I sent the mom a letter of apology and there is one in the mail to the officer. I have my eyewitness account and I brought the issue up in my support group. I have a lot of support from some and am being attacked by others. One mom who I pulled into the general topic fired back a note telling me I excuse Riley&#39;s bnehaior, do nothing, and blame the victims for the problem. Yuck, but such is life with any group. I&#39;ll let you know what happens next.<br/>
<br/>
