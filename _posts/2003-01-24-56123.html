&gt; In the year 325 CE, Constantine (a non-baptized Pagan) convened the Council <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; of Nicea to settle disputes in the Church. The council changed Jesus from <br/>
&gt; man <br/>
&gt; to God in the flesh, they changed the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, and <br/>
&gt; the Passover was changed to Easter. So what does this say about the Bible? <br/>
&gt; It <br/>
&gt; says that MEN, not god, composed the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would hope that parents are helping their children to gain a more nuanced <br/>
understanding of history than this kind of statement represents.<br/>
<br/>
So, for example, if they read that Emperor Constantine was not baptized until <br/>
his death bed, is the point brought out that he was a Christian catechumen?  <br/>
As a &quot;student&quot; Christian he was not a pagan.<br/>
<br/>
Why did Constantine convene a council of the whole church throughout the <br/>
Roman Empire?  (The word &quot;catholic,&quot; by the way, means &quot;according to the <br/>
whole.&quot;)  He banked on using Christianity to renovate the Roman Empire, and <br/>
therefore thought the bishops had to get their act together since there <br/>
seemed to be disagreements among and within the local churches in various <br/>
cities and provinces.  So he convened the first ecumenical (empire-wide) <br/>
council of all the bishops of the church and asked them to set forth the <br/>
beliefs and practices of the church.  In the process they produced a creed <br/>
that was constructed by comparing all the baptismal professions of faith used <br/>
in the local churches.  They produced a canon of Scripture by comparing the <br/>
books read in the local Christian assemblies.   In the battle against <br/>
gnosticism Christian assemblies had already agreed to four canonical gospels <br/>
and excluded gospels they regarded as gnostic.  They accepted the canon of <br/>
Old Testament books that the Jewish rabbis had already established, although <br/>
they changed the order in the Old Testament so that the prophetic books came <br/>
last.  They believed that all of these books in the Old and now in the <br/>
canonized New Testaments were inspired.  The bishops affirmed the doctrine of <br/>
the Trinity (which necessarily includes the co-divinity of Christ with the <br/>
Father and the Holy Spirit) by appealing to the statements in the gospels and <br/>
epistles and the devotional practices of their people.  Confessing one God in <br/>
three co-equal persons excluded the Arians who taught that the Son was <br/>
subordinate to the Father.  They synchronized the Christian calender <br/>
throughout the Empire by agreeing that the Pascha (later called &quot;Easter&quot; by <br/>
the Anglo-Saxons) should be observed on the first Sunday after the first full <br/>
moon of spring and not on the 14th of Nisan, as the Christians of Asia Minor <br/>
had been doing.  So Rome won on this one. <br/>
<br/>
After the Council Constantine decreed that Sunday would be a day of rest <br/>
throughout the Empire.  That meant that sabbath ideas were transferred to the <br/>
Lord&#39;s Day.  But catholic Christianity has always understood that the Lord&#39;s <br/>
Day and the Sabbath are two different days.  In the Latin church calendar <br/>
Saturday is still called &quot;Sabbato&quot; (&quot;of rest&quot;) and Sunday is called &quot;Dominca&quot; <br/>
(&quot;of the Lord&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
I would hope that homeschoolers would learn to understand the dynamics at <br/>
work in history, and not just facts which, in and of themselves, might not be <br/>
true. or conclusions which usually, in the study of history, are untrue.  As <br/>
I&#39;ve tried to indicate by the above discussion---as an illustration of this <br/>
principle---it simply would not be true that Constantine remained a pagan or <br/>
that he turned Sunday into the Sabbath.  The reality was more complicated <br/>
than that.<br/>
