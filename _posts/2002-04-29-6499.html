&lt;&lt; . But I do have to have an evaluation or <br/>
 testing done at the end of every year here in FL. So how would <br/>
 I &quot;prove math&quot; in an evaluation, if we have no book? Gosh, I hope I <br/>
 don&#39;t get a bunch of hate mail over this.... :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Welcome Rebecca.<br/>
First of all, nobody would want to ever send you hate mail from this list (at <br/>
least none of the people I&#39;ve met here!!) But it is a list of experienced <br/>
unschoolers, so the advice will be pointing you to unschooling, which does <br/>
not include &quot;teaching&quot; math.<br/>
Another thought for ya, I live in FL too. I had previously kept a scrapbook <br/>
full of pictures for our evalutation...so you can just find a really cool <br/>
evaluator.<br/>
But there are also a couple umbrella schools for unschoolers....and they are <br/>
very inexpensive. I will e-mail you the info. on the one I plan to sign up <br/>
with, if you want it.<br/>
<br/>
What you have transitioned into with the unit type thing, is what I did <br/>
before totally coming to unschooling. So perhaps you are on your way? <br/>
It&#39;s a much more joyful, carefree way to live imo. But it does take a leap of <br/>
faith to know that your children will learn all that they need without a <br/>
single math lesson....<br/>
Stay and read, you&#39;ll surely learn a lot.<br/>

  That is what I started doing this year too. I have been doing most of the Portfolio in a scrapbook form. Actually, I have been letting my girls do most of it. They absolutely love to make their own pages.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; But there are also a couple umbrella schools for unschoolers....and they are <br/>
  very inexpensive. I will e-mail you the info. on the one I plan to sign up <br/>

  I would love to have that information. I heard of one umbrella school. They don&#39;t require testing or evaluations, only attendance records. BTW, that is really all the state of FL requires of &quot;private schools&quot;, which is what an &quot;umbrella school&quot; really is. I have lost who they are, I have been getting so many emails, it&#39;s in there somewhere.... :)<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; What you have transitioned into with the unit type thing, is what I did <br/>
  before totally coming to unschooling. So perhaps you are on your way?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s what I thought. I&#39;ve been, hanging around this group for a week or so, and from what I was seeing in the discussions I could see wasn&#39;t quite there. I am really trying hard to &quot;trust&quot; my kids. But if you don&#39;t mind. I have one question... (actually it was asked by my dh). How does this happen? How do our kids just learn? He is concerned about, how do kids just know what to learn. (This is a very hard question to ask, the words aren&#39;t coming) I guess what I am meaning is, if we don&#39;t direct them to... say Ancient Egypt or something else, how will they arrive there?  <br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; But it does take a leap of faith to know that your children will learn all that they need without a single math lesson....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I have gone to the unschooling.com and have read a lot, and plan to go back and read more... but I am feeling a little better about math. It really is hard to break &quot;Bad Habits&quot; &lt;g&gt; .<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you all, I will grow....<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; How does this happen? How do our kids just learn? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By playing.  They learn to count and sort and categorize and speak and <br/>
describe and discuss by playing.<br/>
<br/>
They learn history by going to museums, looking at paintings and sculptures <br/>
in books or wherever, by watching movies about Spartacus or The Patriot or <br/>
Henry VIII or ...<br/>
<br/>
They learn science by playing with mud, balls, pivot boards in the yard, <br/>
ramps for little cars or big bikes or skateboards, kites, tops, frisbees...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; if we don&#39;t direct them to... say Ancient Egypt or something else, how <br/>
will they arrive there?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How did you and your husband learn about ancient Egypt?  Really think about <br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
Church?  Watching The Ten Commandments on TV?  Mummy movies?  Heiroglyphics <br/>
puzzles in books?  Scooby-Doo? Raiders of the Lost Ark?<br/>
<br/>
There are some WONDERFUL kids and pop-up books and kids&#39; books about Egyptian <br/>
history.  We have lots.  I don&#39;t &quot;direct&quot; the kids there, they just come <br/>
across things, and sometimes we look things up, and sometimes a book is on <br/>
the dining room table, or in the bathroom, and when we get to go to museums <br/>
we do.<br/>
<br/>
The other day we had a rented twilight zone DVD and one of the stories <br/>
involved scarabs from Egypt.  It was science fiction, but there was one point <br/>
of information.  Enough dots get connected, enough vocabulary, <br/>
pictures-in-heads, factoids, references, and the child has his own model of <br/>
Egypt building, which he will add to for the rest of his life.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; if we don&#39;t direct them to... say Ancient Egypt or something else, how <br/>
will they arrive there?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keep their lives busy and open and encourage their joyous curiosity, and if <br/>
your family is never stagnant, the whole world will be right there, in your <br/>
house, outside your house, in all kinds of literature and art and movies and <br/>
artifacts all over the place.<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re living in the world instead of in school, Egypt is a lot closer <br/>
to you than to school-kids, who need to wait for that one two-week unit on <br/>
Egypt, out of their whole twelve years.  But if your kids have an aversion, <br/>
they can avoid two weeks.  And if they have an interest, they can &quot;study <br/>
Egypt&quot; all they want to.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How does this happen? How do our kids just learn?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How did they learn to speak English? This is an incredibly amazing process<br/>
that kids start out without even realizing language exists and within a fe<br/>
years have mastered it. We shrug it off as mysterious but trivial because<br/>
all kids do it.<br/>
<br/>
But I think we really need to pay attention. They learn English purely as a<br/>
side effect of living life and trying to get what they want. English is a<br/>
useful tool they happen to pick up and use one day because it was more<br/>
effective than pointing. And the more they find it useful and the more they<br/>
pick it up the better at it they get. (And then compare how effective that<br/>
is to how effective formal foreign language instruction is.)<br/>
<br/>
Everything is like that. Math and science and history and writing are all<br/>
tools we use to get what we want and explore the world. Adding 15+23 isn&#39;t<br/>
important. What&#39;s important is who is winning the game. And how much<br/>
allowance they have accumulated versus how much they need. And how far away<br/>
this trip is compared to a trip they know well. And how much longer until<br/>
Daddy gets home. And how can you double 3/4 cup so we can make a double<br/>
batch of cookies. Kids pick up how numbers work (and nature and people and<br/>
communication) by using the tools. Despite what years of torturous math<br/>
instruction has led us to believe, kids don&#39;t need to be told to work<br/>
numbers in order to work them. They figure them out. Just as they figured<br/>
out the intricacies of the English language.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He is concerned about, how<br/>
&gt; do kids just know what to learn. (This is a very hard question to ask, the<br/>
&gt; words aren&#39;t coming)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you need everything you were taught? Don&#39;t you use the things you need<br/>
and have pretty much forgotten the things you don&#39;t? If kids&#39; learning is<br/>
based on acquiring what *they* need (and find interesting or intriguing)<br/>
then how can they not know what to learn?<br/>
<br/>
One point is that learning that way doesn&#39;t take nearly as long as it does<br/>
in school. Plus there aren&#39;t years of experience with learning being dull.<br/>
If a kid needs math to explore what he wants to in college, he&#39;ll have<br/>
learned (by using) enough math to get him as far as he is and can build on<br/>
that understanding to get the rest of what he needs. It *won&#39;t* take him<br/>
years. It will take months at most.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess what I am meaning is, if we don&#39;t direct them<br/>
&gt; to... say Ancient Egypt or something else, how will they arrive there?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do they want to go to Ancient Egypt? If they do they&#39;ll stumble across<br/>
something that&#39;s interesting. Then they&#39;ll stumble across something else<br/>
that&#39;s interesting that will hook into the first. And so on.<br/>
<br/>
Then you&#39;ll say, hmm, maybe if I pointed out a show or brought home a book<br/>
or a kit on hieroglyphs or pyramids or mummies .... And you can guage how<br/>
much more to direct depending on their level of interest.<br/>
<br/>
But their learning won&#39;t be about &quot;topics&quot; like that. If you see learning<br/>
that way you won&#39;t be able to see learning when they&#39;re playing.<br/>

 Maybe I probably used the wrong word!<br/>
<br/>
My dad made us a merry-go-round when I was a kid.  Steel frame, big bearings, <br/>
on a steel post set in concrete.  It was totally cool.<br/>
<br/>
We moved, though, and he didn&#39;t have access to the same equipment (he had <br/>
been building trailers for boats and such and the angle iron was scrap).  <br/>
Then he made us a teeter-totter better than any we&#39;d ever seen.<br/>

Not if both ends are equal and not if one end isn&#39;t underneath something <br/>

I think something can pivot on one plane only.  &quot;Pivots 360 degrees&quot; is what <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558282961">Whew! I had to go through a whole lot of yahoo list names to find this one, I <br/>
couldn&#39;t remember the name of the list I was on a few years ago, thought it <br/>
was unschooling dotcom or something like that but it didn&#39;t come up in a <br/>
search. Then a while back a friend sent me a couple of group names (Heidi are you <br/>
here?) but I couldn&#39;t find them either and I am sooo desperate to talk to <br/>
someone else to sort through this unschooling life without first having to explain <br/>
the difference between hsing, unschooling and noschooling. If I have to explain <br/>
it you don&#39;t get it. I am still getting it, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, hello, my name is Laura and I do see at least one or two people I <br/>
know here. I live and learn with the youngest 2 of my 6 sons a 12 and a 16yro, we <br/>
are in our 5th year of having the boys home. My older kids were all schooled <br/>
and are all out of school, only the youngest of them still lives here and he <br/>
is 20.<br/>
<br/>
We have been slowly migrating to the unschooling life over the past 5 yrs, <br/>
last year we were very close but not quite there, can&#39;t say exactly what <br/>
happened this year but it seems we have arrived. Has it happened for anyone else that <br/>
way? It&#39;s really odd because 5 yrs ago my DH was not even sold on hsing,yet,  <br/>
I know he is fully aware of how we are living these past several months and <br/>
even he seems perfectly OK with it!! <br/>
<br/>
I hope no one minds me posting right away after joining but I can&#39;t wait any <br/>
longer, I have about a million things to talk through and I&#39;d like to do it <br/>
with people who are on the same page, I am exhausted from being the most <br/>
challenging person on my lists. From what I have been reading ya&#39;ll are up to it. <br/>
