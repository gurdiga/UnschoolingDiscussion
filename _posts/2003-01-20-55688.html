<div id="ygrps-yiv-17399582">&lt;&lt;my 10 year old daughter is very interested in designing clothing&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You might contact your local county extension agent.  At least in Texas,<br/>
clothing design and sewing are big activities in 4-H.<br/>

OH YES!<br/>
<br/>
And here, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s 4-H but there is THE coolest contest called <br/>
&quot;Sheep to Shawl,&quot; where people raise the sheep, spin the thread, weave (or <br/>
knit or crochet) and make a garment.  WOW.  I was stunned the first time I <br/>
saw their stuff.<br/>

VERY large Christmas stockings. The tag said, &quot;Stocking knitted by Mary/Wool <br/>
donated by Bessie&quot;. TOO SWEET!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057247822">We love Sheep to Shawl - here, they set up a festival in the<br/>
Spring and you can spend a couple of days going through each<br/>
step, learning in some detail how the steps are done.  The 6 y.o.<br/>
and I are about ready to replace the emus with some sheep, though<br/>
friend husband remains enamoured of the &quot;dinosaurs&quot; in the back<br/>
yard.<br/>
