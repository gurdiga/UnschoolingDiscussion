<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849160901">Okay All,<br/>
<br/>
I can be pretty level headed to a point. It&#39;s that point when it get on your <br/>
nerves and I start having issues!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I have this 1 neighbor that has homeschooling issues....he&#39;s not for it <br/>
or believes in it....<br/>
<br/>
So, they other day he asks my kids again don&#39;t they get bored? Do they have <br/>
any friends? Do you know any neighborhood kids (mine you that my kids <br/>
associate with the neighborhood kids & adults) and do they they think that <br/>
they would have more friends if they went to school?<br/>
<br/>
These are among the many constant questions and these questions are repeated <br/>
all the time even though they are answered. It&#39;s like how many times do you <br/>
have to answer the darn question. It&#39;s like maybe he is hoping that 1 of <br/>
those times, he would get the answer that he is looking for once they change <br/>
the answer.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just plain driving me nuts!!!!!!!<br/>

<br/>
Cheer up, his kids are probably asking him &quot;Daddy, why do WE HAFTA go to<br/>
school?&quot;  I&#39;m sure he&#39;s struggling to come up with good answers.  That<br/>
may be why he is rehearsing some of them with you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145706131">Okay you used the words &quot;constant&quot; and &quot;all the time&quot; in your post. As far <br/>
as I&#39;m concerned, that&#39;s harrassment. If the guy was concerned or wanted <br/>
information, there are other ways to go about it. I don&#39;t like people <br/>
messing with my kids. But, look at your kids and see if it bothers them. If <br/>
it does I would take action. Depending on the age of your children and what <br/>
they are comfortable with. Like coming up with some kind of quick not smart <br/>
ass remark or approaching the neighbor myself.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve commented to my relatives about grilling my children on certain things. <br/>
Only when I saw it bothered them and they were too young to answer anything <br/>
but what the questons were.<br/>
<br/>
I may get some flack for being a hard ass but I don&#39;t like people messing <br/>
with my kids. (ooh, I said that already!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632271008">Why not send him a letter asking him not to address the issue at all with the <br/>
children when you are not there?<br/>
When you are just say, where all doing fine thank you or MYOB or whatever.<br/>
There is a point when people get too involved with things that aren&#39;t any of <br/>
their business and they need to have that pointed out.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Okay you used the words &quot;constant&quot; and &quot;all the time&quot; in your post. As far <br/>
as I&#39;m concerned, that&#39;s harrassment.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just one of those kind of canned conversations, though.  When the <br/>
kids are in school people say &quot;How are your kids liking school this year?&quot; <br/>
and the parents tell a story or two about sports or a play or who knows what.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he just can&#39;t think of something to converse about and has a little <br/>
list of boring questions.<br/>
<br/>
Holly complains that the next door neighbor kid asks her the very same <br/>
questions every single time they play (which is rare, partly because of that).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do you still do homeschool?&quot;<br/>
but that&#39;s progress from when she used to just say &quot;Where do you go to <br/>
school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Poor children!!!!!  Nothing to discuss but school.  Yuck.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m teaching my kids that quizzing is a two way street.  So far they&#39;ve just <br/>
been tested to see if they know anything.  (My brother once expressed in <br/>
amazement that he couldn&#39;t believe the state wouldn&#39;t step in if I ended up <br/>
raising a bunch of idiots.)  You know, like what color is your boot?  Do you <br/>
know how many fingers I&#39;m holding up?  After a while my kids say &quot;Ok, MY <br/>
turn.  Why is the blade of the grader in the middle instead of the front of <br/>
the machine?&quot;  (Or some other burning question.  Shuts folks right up.  <br/>
Sometimes I remind them to take turns with questions.<br/>
<br/>
It might help in your situation.  Neighbor:  don&#39;t you get bored at home?  do <br/>
you have any friends?  can you read?  kids:  MY turn!  How often do you leave <br/>
your house?  can you fix your own toilet?  what did you have for dinner last <br/>
tuesday?<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion...<br/>

brought him about 20 minutes ago, my father said (with a slightly concerned <br/>
air) &quot;Amy, he doesn&#39;t know where we get milk from. I asked him and he said &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t know.&quot;  I told my dad that I know that he does so know where milk comes <br/>
from; he was just saying that he didn&#39;t know &#39;cause he didn&#39;t feel like <br/>
answering, which is common for him. It made me wonder if he was being quizzed <br/>
during his visit. <br/>

the idea of homeschooling (haven&#39;t mentioned unschooling yet!)<br/>

say &quot;I&#39;ve never met anyone who enjoyed a pop quiz.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If my father had better hearing ( or wore his hearing aids more often) we <br/>
would surely get more quizzes.  He&#39;s an emeritus high energy nuclear <br/>
physicist, though, so he&#39;s sure to get a LOT of questions thrown his way <br/>
pretty soon!<br/>
