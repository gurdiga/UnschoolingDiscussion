&lt;&lt; I think there&#39;s a point where you&#39;re only<br/>
considering the child, and ignoring your opinion of the games, the tv,<br/>
whatever, and making a decision based on the child. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Brenda&#39;s son got in a frightening funk a few weeks ago.  His dad is in the <br/>
military.  They&#39;re living in Germany.  There&#39;s a war imminent.  His dad&#39;s not <br/>
home.  He needs to stay connected with a human instead of escaping into his <br/>
own six year old fear.<br/>
<br/>
He knows where the Gameboy is and when that seems more important again than <br/>
what he&#39;s doing, he&#39;ll play again.<br/>
<br/>
I had a whole sick family.  I with my still-swelling, often hurting, <br/>
October-broken leg and sick myself, was still the healthiest one here for a <br/>
couple of days.  People drank juice.  They ate chicken soup I made.  They <br/>
used kleenex I brought them, and they got their sheets changed when *I* said <br/>
it was time.  They washed their hands extra much.  They called people to say <br/>
they were sick if they were going to need to miss something (I didn&#39;t have to <br/>
enforce that, because they all remembered.  Kirby missed a day of work and <br/>
one session of teaching karate, but he called in advance so people could <br/>
arrange around him.  Holly missed a Harry Potter tournament she usually goes <br/>
to, and a visit she had arranged.   Marty missed a usual get-together, but he <br/>
cancelled by e-mail.  Keith missed two days of work.)<br/>
<br/>
Because the conditions were special and unusual, they were totally willing to <br/>
be directed.  If one of them had said &quot;I really don&#39;t want soup and juice, <br/>
I&#39;d rather have a Dr Pepper and a hot dog,&quot; I would have brought it to them, <br/>
but they had no reason to believe I was being pushy for any reason other than <br/>
that I really thought it was the best way I knew to take care of them.<br/>
<br/>
I rented favorite videos, kept a fire in the fireplace, and brought people <br/>
heated up &quot;corn bags&quot; and blankets if they wanted to sit in the den.<br/>
<br/>
Exceptions and emergencies are different from baseline philosophy and <br/>
practice, pretty much!<br/>
And kids whose relationship with a parent is based on mutual communication <br/>
and trust will be receptive to parentl advice in problem situations.<br/>

My son got into some trouble because of some friends he was hanging out with.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him if he wanted my advice and he said &quot;ok&quot;.  I told him I think he needs to find other friends.  He agreed, and in the past month he&#39;s done just that.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t be prouder of him.<br/>
