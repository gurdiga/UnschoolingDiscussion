&lt;&lt; How do you ever keep track?  It seems like every time we get lots of <br/>
books, <br/>
we end up making a significant &quot;donation&quot; to the library book fund when we <br/>
can&#39;t find a couple of them. Invariably something gets mixed up in our own <br/>
stash at home and we don&#39;t find it for months!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
ditto this for me!!!!!!!  help!  also, i thought the library had some sort of <br/>
maximum, apparently not?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279704346">I&#39;ve kept the receipt fromt the library in a folder for documentation & for<br/>
reference when the books are due.  We mark the calendar for a return day.<br/>
The day before we do a library book find game, the kids have to find every<br/>
book on our lists (dd & ds & me each have a card).  They are then put in a<br/>
bag to return the next day.  My problem is with stepdd (16) who feels this<br/>
too childish.  She now owes $27.00 for books & CDs, she thought they were<br/>
all lent for two weeks at a time & didn&#39;t bother to look at the due dates.<br/>
Anyway I&#39;ll be getting some house cleaning help from her to work this off.<br/>
I think for awhile she&#39;ll have to join our book find process till she&#39;s<br/>
developed her own dependable method to return books on time.  By the way the<br/>
kids think this is great fun, at least for now.</div>

I think they differ but ours used to have a 10-book limit.  Now they don&#39;t.  <br/>
Which just means that they check out all of our books on one card instead of <br/>
having to split it between 3.<br/>

really has been a big help here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-915938342">I keep a list of duedates and books on the computer as a spreadsheet. <br/>
Then before our weekly trip, I check the list and gather the due <br/>
books together from around the house.<br/>
