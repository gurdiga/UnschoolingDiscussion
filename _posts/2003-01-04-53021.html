<br/>
Good point! <br/>
<br/>
(And I want to generalize here, without picking on Tia.  Please excuse me.)<br/>
<br/>
Overall, our culture (in the US) has what feels to me like a nasty,<br/>
schoolmarmish, red-pencil-wielding tone about not knowing the &quot;right&quot;<br/>
stuff at the &quot;right time&quot;.  There are certain &quot;important&quot; things that<br/>
we&#39;re all supposed to learn the day before the test.  Learning anything<br/>
after the test doesn&#39;t count as learning.  Those red marks pointing out<br/>
ignorance don&#39;t go away.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s lip-service in our culture to &quot;learning&quot;, but what we reward is<br/>
&quot;already knowing&quot;.  (I think in school it&#39;s often those that already<br/>
know the subject being presented that are going to get the best grades<br/>
in the class.  It&#39;s very hard for a teacher to detect who in a class has<br/>
actually learned the most.)<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s all do what we can to quash this &quot;you should know that already&quot;<br/>
attitude and encourage questioning and learning at any age and on any<br/>
day.  (I think everyone can agree to that.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a rather strange interpretation of the reality of this list.  In the<br/>
recent past, a number of new people have come on and posted.  Those people<br/>
have not been jumped on or criticized.  Every so often someone comes on and<br/>
posts something that could steer new unschoolers in a less productive<br/>
direction.  Those posts (not the people, their posts) have been commented<br/>
on.  The suggestion to wait a couple of weeks before posting is just that, a<br/>
suggestion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011796361">&lt;&lt; Is it rude to &quot;crash&quot; a party or a conversation??   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that qualifies as a stupid question.<br/>
&quot;Crashing&quot; a party is the definition of rudeness.<br/>
But this isn&#39;t a party.<br/>
<br/>
Causing a conversation to turn away from  unschooling to other issues isn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;crashing&quot; it, but if after those who were trying to discuss unschooling say <br/>
one thing or another isn&#39;t unschooling, then carping on the original thing <br/>
isn&#39;t helpful.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Every so often someone comes on and<br/>
posts something that could steer new unschoolers in a less productive<br/>
direction.  Those posts (not the people, their posts) have been commented<br/>
on.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
