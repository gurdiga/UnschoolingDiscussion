<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582380894">I thank you all for the information and the interesting discussions. <br/>
I am unsubbing for awhile but I hope our paths will cross again. IN <br/>
particular, I thank you for all the help you offered me last month <br/>
when I wrote about my son&#39;s hitting and saying &quot;Shut up&quot;...the <br/>
behavior is still going on but I&#39;m a bit calmer about it. This too <br/>
shall pass, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
Thanks and blessings to all of you!<br/>
Hikaru</div>
