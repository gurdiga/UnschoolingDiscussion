<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165474104">HI,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading this message board for a while now and find it <br/>
wonderful for relieving the unschooling anxiety I feel at times...I <br/>
guess &quot;schoolishness&quot; still gets in my way. along with the <br/>
dreaded &quot;what ifs&quot;  :)<br/>
<br/>
I see my middle son in a lot of the posts lately... the &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; <br/>
thing.  He is also an extremely kinesthetic person in every way you <br/>
can think of.  But, he&#39;s the perfect unschooler, inquisitive... you <br/>
can just see him learning away from everything he&#39;s doing.  Yet he <br/>
still has those moments of whining &quot;what can I do&quot;.  He too will not <br/>
take any of my suggestions (but my favorite suggestions unfortunatley <br/>
often involve some sort of chore that needs to be done).  Usually <br/>
when he hears that the floor needs to be washed he finds something to <br/>
do :)  He&#39;s 8 by the way.<br/>
<br/>
I also have 2 other children, an 11 y/o boy with ADD who is perfectly <br/>
happy and self-contained, he rarely says he&#39;s bored, he can spend <br/>
hours playing Playstation, educational games, building legos or <br/>
 carving intricate swords and knives out of sticks, wood, anything he <br/>
can get his hands on.  My best bet is he&#39;s going to be an artist or <br/>
designer some day.  We also have a soon to be 7 y/o daughter who is <br/>
nearly obsessed with stuffed animals... she dresses them up, role <br/>
plays a lot.  She&#39;s the one that gets teased by the neighbor girls <br/>
for not having a &quot;real teacher&quot;.  I know it&#39;s happening again when <br/>
she asks for worksheets.  She really hates those things but peer <br/>
pressure is strong for her.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just dropping in to say Hi...I really love unschooling and <br/>
feel very fortunate in not having kids that need a schedule!  I&#39;m <br/>
about as disorganized as you can get, always getting excited about <br/>
something, like making solar ovens or cement bird baths.  Did any of <br/>
you see &quot;Frontier House&quot; on PBS?  I had a week long frenzy of bread <br/>
and baking powder biscuit making from watching that!  Olivia was so <br/>
proud of the ones she made all by herself... the boys were heavy <br/>
into &quot;hunting&quot; around the house (which is pretty hard to do living in <br/>
a subdivision in Florida!).  I&#39;m looking forward to reading more of <br/>
all of your comments and suggestions... as I said, it&#39;s all very <br/>
reassuring!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504497266">What a wonderful post!.  Thank you.  <br/>
Reassuring to those just starting out and also nice for those whose children have &quot;graduated&quot;  into adulthood.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you find time to write again. <br/>
