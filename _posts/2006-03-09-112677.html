<div id="ygrps-yiv-96639097">Here in Hawaii rice cookers are common (I guess because of all the Asian<br/>
influence) - but I have, as yet, never been able to find one with an inside<br/>
that was not aluminum, which I&#39;d rather not use. Anyone know of one with a<br/>
stainless inner pot?<br/>
Thanks and aloha, Lee<br/>
