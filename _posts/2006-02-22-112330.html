<div id="ygrps-yiv-91681309">Hi All, <br/>
<br/>
I am Laura. I am an unschooler. I have been married 11 years as of <br/>
this last saturday! We live in Oklahoma City. I am originally from <br/>
Oklahoma, but just got home in December from a two year move in the <br/>
Houston, TX area. I have been unschooling since the beginning, <br/>
although I didn&#39;t realize it until about 4 years ago. I have 3 kids. <br/>
I have a boy 8, girl 5, and a baby girl 1. I am so glad to be apart <br/>
of this group. I have been posting my intro to several groups as I <br/>
have been on *no mail* for quite some time. I have loved reading the <br/>
posts recently. I especially liked the ones about what unschooling <br/>
looks like this minute.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine and I just started a new yahoo group tonight for <br/>
christian unschoolers in the OKC area. If any of you are here in <br/>
Oklahoma, please come and join us too on a local level! We are <br/>
wanting to get together with people that are in our area as well as <br/>
online! <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to being a part of this group! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-836483746">Hey Sandra<br/>
I was surprised that there were no groups listed from Canada. I wonder <br/>
if I should bite the old bullet and start one...hmmmm. Do you know of <br/>
any unschooling groups in Canada, more specifically Ontario?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re not trying to fill in a map, though.  If you feel that  <br/>
organizing a group would help your kids or people you know in your  <br/>
area, and if you want to go to the trouble to create and maintain a  <br/>
group, then do it for that reason.  It&#39;s okay with that webpage if  <br/>
there&#39;s not an Ontario listing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
