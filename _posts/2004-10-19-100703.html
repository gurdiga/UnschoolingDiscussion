<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276526924">Netscape News has this up.  I don&#39;t mind being from &quot;the dumbest state,&quot; but <br/>
I do have questions:<br/>
<br/>
Who &quot;Morgan Quitno Press&quot;?  <br/>
If high drop out and physical violence might be the direct result of the <br/>
other negatives, is it fair to grade a state down (as it were) for responding <br/>
naturally to an already-bad situation?    And is the state dumb because they don&#39;t <br/>
spend a whole lot on schools, or do they mean to suggest every child is dumb <br/>
because the state didn&#39;t spend more?<br/>
<br/>
I was amused, in a sad way.   <br/>
<br/>
But if a state had a lot of homeschoolers, that might contribute to making <br/>
the state seem dumber  (on this brilliantly designed scale).  I think it&#39;s an <br/>
insurmountable problem. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
States Ranked: Smartest to Dumbest<br/>
<br/>
The smartest state in the union for the second consecutive year is <br/>
Massachusetts. <br/>
<br/>
The dumbest, for the third year in a row, is New Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
These are the findings of the Education State Rankings, a survey by Morgan <br/>
Quitno Press of hundreds of public school systems in all 50 states. States were <br/>
graded on a variety of factors based on how they compare to the national <br/>
average. These included such positive attributes as per-pupil expenditures, public <br/>
high school graduation rates, average class size, student reading and math <br/>
proficiency, and pupil-teacher ratios. States received negative points for high <br/>
drop-out rates and physical violence.<br/>
<br/>

My guess is you&#39;re somewhere between 11 and 20 because those numbers were  <br/>
skipped.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
All I can say once again, being from Arkansas which is usually ranked 49th  <br/>
in lots of educational rankings, is &quot;thank heavens for Mississippi (and  <br/>
everyone else after #37).  <br/>

It&#39;s a bit like suggesting that the person with the most expensive <br/>
bicycle is certain to win the Tour de France.  Or maybe the person who <br/>
trained for the most years.  (Fifty? Eighty?)<br/>
