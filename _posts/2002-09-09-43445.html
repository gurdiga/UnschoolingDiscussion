<div id="ygrps-yiv-24074616">This temporarily went astray but here it is in the right place if a day<br/>
or two late.<br/>
<br/>
****It seems to come from some long time <br/>
members who have a tendency to jump on the newcomers who are honestly and<br/>
<br/>
hopefully looking for support in their new found or difficult journey of <br/>
unschooling, whether it be recent or not.****<br/>
<br/>
Might it be that you feel jumped on when that&#39;s not the intent?  It is so<br/>
easy to feel like we&#39;re being criticized because so many of us have had<br/>
to deal with criticism from family and friends and sometimes spouses<br/>
about our choice to unschool.  When it seems like it comes at us from<br/>
everywhere maybe we loose perspective some.<br/>
<br/>
 ****What it does look like, from some, is the &quot;not in <br/>
my house never with my kids I always know exactly what to do and always<br/>
have <br/>
attitude.&quot; ****<br/>
<br/>
And this might be what it looks like to the people on the other side of<br/>
the discussion.  So many times we hear &quot;I know what&#39;s best for my kids&quot;<br/>
and what the person is hiding behind is their excuse to spank, or shame<br/>
or control their kids.  I&#39;m not talking about any one here personally,<br/>
but when we hear this<br/>
&quot;I monitor&quot;  &quot;I won&#39;t allow&quot; to people who know they can trust their<br/>
children, those are words with &quot;attitude&quot;.  This really is the kind of<br/>
thing that gets addressed on unschooling lists.  <br/>
<br/>
****Some have actually said, &quot;what I do when that happens is, or why <br/>
don&#39;t you try etc&quot; but for the most part, no solutions have been<br/>
mentioned, <br/>
just nit picking terms and words and some saying that what they are doing<br/>
is <br/>
wrong. ****<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really sorry if it feels like nit picking and not help.  The thing is<br/>
sometimes people need to really think about what they are doing that<br/>
might be prompting certain behaviors in their kids.  That&#39;s not always<br/>
the case, but sometimes it is and it really can&#39;t hurt parents to think<br/>
about their parenting and how they could improve on what they&#39;re doing. <br/>
No, it&#39;s not the job of anyone on this list to tell anyone else how to<br/>
parent, BUT if people come and ask a question on an unschooling list they<br/>
are going to get unschooling responses.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it would help to &quot;assume&quot; every post is meant in the most helpful<br/>
way and not meant as a criticism.  If it feels like a criticism  maybe<br/>
there really is something inside  that needs to be examined.  <br/>
<br/>
What if you really did get &quot;What I do when this happens&quot;  responses and<br/>
you just didn&#39;t read them that way.  I DO see the responses here that<br/>
way.  <br/>
Saying that building trust with your kids is a good way to give them<br/>
healthy attitudes about sex and women isn&#39;t a criticism of the kind of<br/>
parenting that&#39;s been going on so far, it&#39;s just the unschoolish way to<br/>
say, control and monitoring might do it but wouldn&#39;t everyone be better<br/>
off if there was no reason to control and monitor.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes things that really make me mad and defensive are things I need<br/>
to look at within myself and sort out.  <br/>
People here really are trying to offer good unschooling information.  No<br/>
one wants to hurt anyone else.  If you start from there, maybe the posts<br/>
will seem less threatening to you. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You posted a lot more than this but I just wanted you to know I was <br/>
responding to your whole post without reposting it all.<br/>
I understand and agree with it. I see all your points and some of what I <br/>
wrote wasn&#39;t always coming from my point of view but maybe from what I <br/>
understood someone else saying.<br/>
<br/>
It takes quite a lot to scare me away or even offend me, and if I am, I will <br/>
say so first to let someone clarify if it was meant that way or not.<br/>
