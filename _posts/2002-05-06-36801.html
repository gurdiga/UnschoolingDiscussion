<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073600566">Here is another example - I&#39;m not sure which one is more clear - they are <br/>
different and its good to fool with more than one way to do it.<br/>
<br/>
******************************<br/>
If you have 3 kids standing in a line, all facing east, and they each take <br/>
two forward (toes first) steps, then you&#39;ll have a total of 6 steps to the <br/>
east.<br/>
<br/>
If you have 3 kids standing in a line, all facing east, and the each take two <br/>

<br/>
If you have 3 kids standing in a line, all facing west, and they each take <br/>
two backward steps (heels first), then you&#39;ll have a total of 6 steps to the <br/>
east.<br/>
<br/>
Try it first before going farther.<br/>
<br/>
If you have three people - stand up and actually follow the directions. If <br/>
you don&#39;t have 3 people, draw it - be sure you draw it so you can tell which <br/>
way they step - heels first or toes first.<br/>
******************************************<br/>
Okay - now to put some math notation to it.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s let the sign of the first number stand for the direction they&#39;re <br/>
facing. If they&#39;re facing east, we&#39;ll make the number positive and if they&#39;re <br/>
<br/>
facing west, we&#39;ll make it negative. <br/>
<br/>
The value of the first number is how many kids there are standing in the <br/>
line.<br/>
<br/>
Now let the sign of the second number be whether they walk forward (toes <br/>
first) or backward (heels first). If they walk forward (toes first) we&#39;ll <br/>
give it a positive sign and if they walk backward (heels first) we&#39;ll give it <br/>
<br/>
a negative sign. <br/>
<br/>
The value of the second number will be how many steps each takes.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll let the sign of the answer be positive if they end up to the east of <br/>
where they started and negative if they end up to the west of where they <br/>
started.<br/>
<br/>
The value of the answer is the total number of steps taken by all kids.<br/>
<br/>
If you have 3 kids standing in a line, all facing east, then the first number <br/>
<br/>
is a +3.<br/>
<br/>
As they each take two forward (toes first) steps, the second number is +2.<br/>
<br/>
Since they are facing east and walking forward, they&#39;ll move east. So the <br/>
sign of the answer will be positive. <br/>
<br/>
Since there are three of them, each taking 2 steps, you&#39;ll have a total of 6 <br/>
steps to the east and the answer is +6.<br/>
<br/>
We have:  +3 X +2 = +6<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**********************<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Since there are three of them, each taking 2 steps, you&#39;ll have a total of 6 <br/>

We have:  +3 X -2 = -6<br/>

<br/>

I understand this example better than the car one. The car and east/west/mph<br/>
etc. was confusing to me and I got lost about 1/2 way through. This &quot;3 kids<br/>
in line&quot; seems more basic and easier for me to understand.<br/>
But it&#39;s just a formula for helping one to remember how to do these kinds of<br/>
problems, right?<br/>
<br/>
What would really help me understand is if there is ever a time IRL when<br/>
there is a need to multiply 2 negative-signed numbers, or a postive times a<br/>
negative, etc.. Is there such an example? Or do these problems exist<br/>
exclusively on paper?<br/>
<br/>
I got pretty good grades in math when I was in school - even algebra,<br/>
because I could usually understand how to apply the learned formula to the<br/>
problem. But all that has left me a LONG time ago. Seems I&#39;m back to &quot;basic&quot;<br/>
math knowledge and I can help myself in most cases to figure out whatever<br/>
real-life problems that come up. Beyond that - I&#39;d need a refresher course<br/>
or something, or learning formula&#39;s on an unschooling e-mail list. ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Usually people explain positive and negative numbers to kids as having and<br/>
owing money. But the positive and negative can represent *anything* that&#39;s<br/>
opposite. In Pam&#39;s example, they represent opposite cardinal directions.<br/>
They can also represent charges on a particle, whether something is<br/>
increasing or decreasing, coming after or before or above or below some<br/>
chosen point.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s from being taught how to do arithmetic before we&#39;ve had lots of<br/>
experience with numbers that has cemented the idea that positives are<br/>
something and negatives are less than nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Multiplying 2 negatives numbers is just multiplying 2 qualities that come in<br/>
opposite flavors to their 2 positive counterparts. The positives and<br/>
negatives sometimes make sense like up and rising being positive and down<br/>
and falling being negative. Sometimes they&#39;re just chosen so everyone is<br/>
using negative the same way. (The &quot;negative&quot; charge of an electron isn&#39;t<br/>
really negative. It&#39;s just opposite the &quot;positive&quot; charge of the proton.)<br/>
<br/>
The numbers can tell you *how big* something is. The positives and negatives<br/>
can tell you *where* it is in relation to some (sometimes arbitrarily<br/>
chosen) reference (zero) point.<br/>
<br/>
Life came first. Then we invented math as a way to describe life. Teaching<br/>
math out of the context of what it&#39;s describing is like teaching a foreign<br/>
grammar and vocabulary without ever hearing or using the language.<br/>
<br/>
Math makes sense in context. Out of context it&#39;s just memorization.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But it&#39;s just a formula for helping one to remember how to do these kinds of<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No - not a formula. It is a way to give some MEANING to the signs so that you <br/>
won&#39;t have to memorize a formula or so that, at the least, the formula will <br/>
have some sense behind it. I searched math books - dozens of the most popular <br/>
of them - almost every one just gave the formula, none gave understandable <br/>
examples. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do - write up more understandable <br/>
examples.<br/>
<br/>
It is an example of the positive and negative signs having an actual meaning, <br/>
instead of just a formula.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;formula&quot; says: &quot;When multiplying two numbers, if the signs of the two <br/>
numbers are the same, the product is positive and if the signs are different, <br/>
the product is positive.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
That is just a formula - no meaning and hard to remember since there is no <br/>
&quot;reason&quot; or &quot;explanation&quot; for it - just a rule to follow.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve become very aware of (and this might help some of you) is that <br/>
people who consider themselves &quot;nonmathies&quot; often don&#39;t really read EACH <br/>
little bit of an explanation. My mom and my sisters are all very math anxious <br/>
- when I explain something to them, they don&#39;t &quot;hear&quot; it all. Their attention <br/>
wanders, they block bits, they are too used to the kind of reading where they <br/>
can skim a little and still follow the action. Whatever the reason - the fact <br/>
is that these kinds of explanations require someone to focus on one bit at a <br/>
time and make sure that each bit is understood before moving on to the next. <br/>
It is SLOW reading, sometimes painstaking. But - the understanding you can <br/>
get from doing it that way is very very empowering.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard, in writing, to make this clear, because I can&#39;t watch your eye <br/>
movement, facial expression, body language, etc., and so I can&#39;t (gently &lt;G&gt;) <br/>
bring you back to the step where you got lost (it almost always is because of <br/>
lack of enough attention to the step right before that one).<br/>

<br/>
TOO early and too much emphasis on arithmetic is looking to me like the REAL <br/>
cause of all the math anxiety and math ignorance in this country.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to start doing a little research about other countries. The PROBLEM <br/>
is that comparisons are based on standardized tests and you don&#39;t have to <br/>
understand much, just follow formulas, to do well on standardized tests. Kids <br/>
in other countries might just be better &quot;drilled&quot; on formulas and do better <br/>
on standardized tests. So I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;m going to compare countries - <br/>
but I&#39;m interested in it.<br/>

Games, puzzles, building sets, computer games with math elements (I&#39;m really <br/>
liking this new Math Arena), poker chips, cash, card games, dominos (spinner, <br/>
where all scores are multiples of five), measuring, sewing, menus.  Just from <br/>
not calling anything &quot;math&quot; but having lots of opportunities to see patterns <br/>
and figure out odds and percentages and keeping scores on games.<br/>
<br/>
And totally without me, they have math exposure from video games, D&D, Magic, <br/>
Pokemon, pooling money with friends to get snacks while playing games, <br/>
figuring out how many weeks&#39; allowance it will take to pay for a concert <br/>

Plots on graphs, fine--that&#39;s already a mathematical construct.  Tell us of a <br/>

mean I think it should be &quot;taught&quot; as a separate subject  to kids. I haven&#39;t <br/>
done that with my own kids. <br/>
<br/>
In fact, what I&#39;m in the process of doing is gathering anecdotal evidence, <br/>
really, about what happens when math IS taught to children in a formal, <br/>
progressive, systematic, programmed way and what happens when it is not. My <br/>
theorem is that bad things often happen when arithmetic computational skills <br/>
are taught BEFORE concepts have been absorbed and integrated. A corollary is <br/>
that concepts can be absorbed in daily life, through fun and games, through <br/>
conversation and argument and by observation.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Math&quot; is something. Just like &quot;reading&quot; is something. But that doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
that &quot;math&quot; has to be learned separately in a series of out-of-context steps <br/>
any more than it means &quot;reading&quot; has to be learned separately in a series of <br/>
out-of-context steps. And neither has to be &quot;taught&quot; in the usual meaning of <br/>
the word.<br/>
<br/>
However, only a few unschooling parents have &quot;reading anxiety&quot; and I doubt <br/>
very many at all have serious &quot;reading phobia&quot; - where they zone out, feel <br/>
faint, get sweaty, feel like throwing up, or black out when faced with <br/>
reading. So - we unschoolers spend a fair amount of time talking about how <br/>
our kids learn to read, yet that seems to me to be a sort of &quot;no-brainer&quot; &lt;G&gt; <br/>
compared to the question of how our kids learn mathematics, especially given <br/>
that the vast majority of the population, including unschooling parents, <br/>
suffer from moderate to severe math anxiety or phobia.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One general problem is that if you don&#39;t know how to do it, you won&#39;t see <br/>
uses for it. <br/>
<br/>
Negative and positive numbers are just a tool - something useful IF you know <br/>
how to use it. I don&#39;t find a lot of uses for soldering iron in my life --- <br/>
but I have a friend who does. Why? Because he knows how to use one and, when <br/>
something comes up that he wants to do, he thinks of it as part of his tool <br/>
kit. If I am faced with the same situation, a soldering iron won&#39;t be in my <br/>
tool kit and so I won&#39;t even see the situation as one that requires a <br/>
soldering iron. I&#39;ll see it as needing glue or tape or maybe as needing a <br/>
friend who might have more tools &lt;G&gt;. So - with negative and positive numbers <br/>
- if you don&#39;t have a facility with them, you won&#39;t notice all the times they <br/>
could have been useful.<br/>
<br/>
That is the case with algebra. People often say they never got algebra and it <br/>
never hurt them because they never had any use for it anyway. But, I use <br/>
algebra frequently in my regular day-to-day life (not counting using it <br/>
professionally in statistics and economics). I use it because I have a <br/>
facility with it and so I use it to figure things out that other people might <br/>
have figured out (with more difficulty, less flexibility, and more likelihood <br/>
of error) some other way or might have just ignored or might have guessed at <br/>
or might have taken someone else&#39;s word for.<br/>
<br/>
So - this isn&#39;t an argument that everybody SHOULD learn algebra or how to use <br/>
positive and negative numbers. No more than that everyone SHOULD learn to use <br/>
a soldering iron. But it is just to explain why you don&#39;t always notice all <br/>
the possible &quot;uses&quot; for all these mathematical tools in your daily life.<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;m also uncomfortable leaving the impression that I might think <br/>
understanding math is only worthwhile because it is useful in daily life. <br/>
Reading is good for more than understanding assembly instructions, filling <br/>
out job applications, reading traffic citations &lt;G&gt;, and other &quot;practical&quot; <br/>
applications - it is a way to communicate and to understand the world <br/>
(reading literature, poetry, interesting information, biographies, history, <br/>
etc.). Mathematics is another way to communicate and understand the world, <br/>
too, and goes far beyond day-to-day utilitarian purposes.<br/>

&gt; If anybody really did find that reading these examples was uncomfortable - or<br/>
&gt; if you keep intending to do it, but just can quite get around to it, or if<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t have time (but have time for all the other mail) or have any other<br/>
&gt; reason for not reading it --- YOU are the people I really want to hear from<br/>
&gt; about your own math backgrounds.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is me, raising my hand over here.  I got it last night, skimmed it,<br/>
saved it to read when I wasn&#39;t so pooped.  Skimmed it again this morning,<br/>
thought &quot;I&#39;ll save it to really read when Matthew gets up and I can kill two<br/>
birds with one stone - and he can explain it to me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, my math background?  I have choppy memories of school as it is.  I<br/>
recall pretty early on having to fill in grid papers with numbers. 1 through<br/>
as far as we could go, apparently.  I also remember stuffing them into the<br/>
black hole that was my desk and &quot;losing&quot; them, I think out of sheer boredom.<br/>
Looking back now that seems a Sisyphusian challenge and to what end?  Skip<br/>
ahead to memorizing multiplication facts with my dad in the kitchen.  I<br/>
wasn&#39;t getting them in school, so we drilled and drilled on them at home.  I<br/>
remember some tears and oddly enough, a few good times too.  Skip ahead to<br/>
jr. high and me taking and only squeaking by in pre-algebra.  I repeated the<br/>
class, even though no one was going to force me to do so.  Got slightly<br/>
better grades that next year, and took no more math after that.  Ever.  Got<br/>
an AA and a BA and an MFA, all without taking any more math.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

&gt; bumped into and expanded on - like you would for other stuff?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I knew early on that I didn&#39;t want to do to Matthew what had been done to<br/>
me, mathwise.  Like most kids, he seemed interested in numbers early and<br/>
used to love to count things and play around with them.  He liked to have us<br/>
ask him math questions in the car, so I used to say what&#39;s 5 + 6 and he&#39;d<br/>
think a minute and answer 11, so I&#39;d say what&#39;s 8 +3 and he&#39;d think a minute<br/>
and answer 11.  We&#39;d do several of these in a row, and what I always found<br/>
interesting, was that he&#39;d take the time to think it through, even though he<br/>
saw what I was doing - he was delighted with the idea that there was more<br/>
than one way to get the same answer.  We noodled around with other number<br/>
things too.  Multiplication for example - he&#39;d want me to make up problems<br/>
for him, so I&#39;d say what&#39;s 3 x 5, then I&#39;d rephrase it what are three fives.<br/>
I find that that subtle difference in wording really helps me to actually<br/>
SEE what it is I&#39;m supposed to be doing.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s always had access to computer games and board games and card games and<br/>
puzzles and real life use of money as well.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never drilled him on memorizing tables or spent much time on writing<br/>
&quot;problems&quot; down, most of this stuff is all verbal.  I find he gets concepts<br/>
very easily and is able to jump to the next level in stuff pretty<br/>
intuitively.  I&#39;m just barely hanging on by my fingernails, but I think<br/>
we&#39;re pretty safely over the hump of me having to worry about having passed<br/>
on math phobia to him.<br/>
<br/>
It helps a lot that his dad is not nearly so much a mathphob as me.<br/>
<br/>
It also helps a LOT that we know Pam in real life, so that when he has a<br/>
question about some concept that has me baffled, he can talk to her about<br/>
it.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-989708098">Tonight  I was telling some people about how an increase in government <br/>
spending or a decrease in taxes works to stimulate the economy and how the <br/>

better, and, lo and behold, discovered myself using a negative number to <br/>
indicate a reduction in taxes. I won&#39;t bore you with the rest of the details. <br/>
But this was an example where there was a sensible meaning to using a <br/>
negative number (which did get used further in multiplication) so I just <br/>
thought I&#39;d mention it.<br/>

the Ohio Historical Society&#39;s sites.  We call stuff about stars <br/>
&quot;astronomy&quot; when we go to the astonomy club&#39;s events and meeting.  But <br/>
knowing that the world has categories to help us learn and find things <br/>
is a far cry from saying everything has to be kept in it&#39;s own <br/>
category.  The girls are learning lots of &#39;math&#39; at their HAM radio <br/>
classes.  They learned some at chemistry too - I think we need to add <br/>
a chem lab here so they don&#39;t have to take the class anymore, but <br/>
that&#39;s another thought.<br/>
<br/>
Other things my girls &#39;study&#39; would include library science, botany, <br/>
biology and I suppose english.  That does not mean they sit down and <br/>
focus on one thing at a time.  It merely means they know how the <br/>
categories are set up - maybe that comes from using the library so <br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
As for me, I don&#39;t *tell* Rachel to go study botany.  Or Jenni to go <br/>
work on her library science.  They just do and we all know where each <br/>
fits into the world.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*Everyone* who has been to school categorizings things into subject areas.<br/>
We&#39;re *trained* to do that from the moment we enter school.<br/>
<br/>
The point of talking about not categorizing things by subjects is to *help*<br/>
new (and old!) unschoolers break out of a way of thinking that can hamper<br/>
their getting or being better at unschooling. It&#39;s not a way to get people<br/>
to stop categorizing things into subjects. It&#39;s an exercise to *help* people<br/>
free their minds.<br/>
<br/>
*Anyone* can categorize an historical museum as history. But how many people<br/>
can see English and math and science and geography and architecuture and<br/>
sociology and so on there? The point is most people coming to unschooling<br/>
will see the historical museum as *just* history when in reality it drew on<br/>
all those tools (subjects) to be what it is.<br/>
<br/>
And even that thinking is a trap but it&#39;s a step towards unschooling. It<br/>
hopefully helps people to get to two places:<br/>
<br/>
1) where they can be comfortable that helping a child figure out their game<br/>
score is math in a much bigger sense than seemingly having done one practice<br/>
problem that schooled kids would be doing 100 times more of and<br/>
<br/>
2) that if everything is in everything then they can start to ease the<br/>
worries about whether their kid has done any math or history or writing<br/>
recently.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;If anybody really did find that reading these examples was uncomfortable - or<br/>
&gt;if you keep intending to do it, but just can quite get around to it, or if<br/>
&gt;you don&#39;t have time (but have time for all the other mail) or have any other<br/>
&gt;reason for not reading it --- YOU are the people I really want to hear from<br/>
&gt;about your own math backgrounds.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I found the first one hard to stay with, but I did stay on and understood <br/>
it.  Then the second one arrived, and it just seemed like to much work.  I <br/>
put it off, and now I have 20 or 30 math messages to read that I <br/>
skipped.  (I did finally read your second example and found it easier than <br/>
the first.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember anything at all about my math (arithmetic) experiences <br/>
before grade 4.  I think I didn&#39;t have any problems with it.  In grade 4, I <br/>
bogged down on long division.  I probably stayed after school every day <br/>
that year trying to finish my work.  It just seemed to take so long with <br/>
each problem to figure out how many times a number would &quot;go into&quot; another <br/>
one.  I&#39;d try one number, and it would be too big.  Then I&#39;d try another, <br/>
and it would be too small, etc. etc. etc.  From that time on, I was in the <br/>
lowest math group.  In grade 5, we didn&#39;t finish the book (by about <br/>
half).  In grade 6 we finished even less (because of having to finish the <br/>
previous one) and then I got to grade 7, where we were tracked.  I got put <br/>
into the top (college bound) track because of my language arts skills.  We <br/>
were expected to do grade 7 and 8 math in that year and go on to algebra in <br/>
grade 8 instead of 9.  Remember I hadn&#39;t come close to finishing the grade <br/>
6 book.  I got through because we had a teacher who would raise our grade a <br/>
little bit for each oral report we did about math.  I did tons of them, <br/>
even though I hated public speaking, and managed to get through.<br/>
<br/>
Algebra completely stumped me, not because I couldn&#39;t get the concepts but <br/>
because I took so long to do the arithmetic and got behind.  Maybe I would <br/>
have been ok if we could have used calculators for the arithmetic, but that <br/>
was before calculators.  And we weren&#39;t allowed to use slide rules, even if <br/>
I had known how.  On to geometry after barely managing to get a C in <br/>
algebra.  I did great until we hit square roots . . .<br/>
In college, I had to take a math course and took &quot;math for liberal arts <br/>
students&quot;.  It was symbolic logic, and I *loved* it.  I even took a more <br/>
advanced course and was told I should go into programming.  (I did but <br/>
didn&#39;t finish before moving to Canada.  Here, you had to have a whole pile <br/>
of math and science to even get in, even though I had been getting straight <br/>
As in programming in California.)<br/>
So there you have my math experiences.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I also want to hear, especially from that above group, how you handle math<br/>
&gt;stuff with your kids -- how do you make sure you don&#39;t pass on your math<br/>
&gt;anxiety to them? How do you create an environment in which math concepts get<br/>
&gt;bumped into and expanded on - like you would for other stuff?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d love to know the answers to those questions.  I fear I haven&#39;t <br/>
succeeded well at all in that area.  My son was actually &quot;ahead&quot; of his <br/>
schooled friends in the early years.  He managed to learn most of the <br/>
practical arithmetic up through percentages and some fraction stuff, mostly <br/>
through his interest in money.  After that, he&#39;s had no need for the stuff <br/>
they learn in school and so hasn&#39;t learned it.<br/>
