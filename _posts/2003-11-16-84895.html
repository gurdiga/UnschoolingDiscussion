Dh heard something on the radio about the author.  They said the <br/>
author is a homeschooled boy.  Looks interesting!  I wonder if <br/>
he&#39;s &quot;homeschooled&quot; or &quot;unschooled&quot;? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah I read about him and they said they exspect his books to be <br/>
more popular than the &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. <br/>
I was wondering the same thing myself home schooled or unschooled.<br/>

 I read an article in the paper a couple of weeks ago. He&#39;s <br/>
definitely homeschooled. Had read 3000 books by the age of 15, into <br/>
mythology, makes his own armor, speaks Norse......<br/>

I keep a list of the books we read together to give with my program to the<br/>
education department each year. I couldn&#39;t make a complete list of all the<br/>
books my kids looked at though.<br/>
<br/>
The article about Christopher Paolini says he has never been to school, has<br/>
read 3000 books, watched 4000 videos and claims to be unbeatable at video<br/>
games. His parents, fugitives from a doomsday survivalist cult, taught him<br/>
all he knows in their little wood-and-shingle home in a remote Montana<br/>
valley. By the age of fifteen, their precocious son had learnt a passable<br/>
version of Old Norse and picked up enough about iron-forging tomake his own<br/>
armor and sword. He had also written the first draft of an epic novel,<br/>
Eragon.<br/>

and sit in our rooms typing all day,&quot; says Paolini, who, while he doesn&#39;t<br/>
see college in his immediate future, listens to university lectures from The<br/>
Teaching Co. &quot;We come down to dinner, watch a movie or something, and then<br/>
go back up.&quot;***<br/>
<br/>
I liked this quote from the article.  My husband was all for unschooling in<br/>
the beginning when he thought we were going to do school-at-home.  Once he<br/>
saw what unschooling was he&#39;s had nothing but complaints like &quot;we don&#39;t take<br/>
homeschooling seriously like other people do&quot; and stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
One of his complaints has been that Erica spends all her time online talking<br/>
to her friends and writing stories.  Last night he floored me when he said<br/>
that it is good that Erica stays home all day typing because she was going<br/>
to be a better writer than anyone!   Of course he had to add that since<br/>
she&#39;s home typing, she&#39;s not out where we don&#39;t know where she is (he&#39;d<br/>
prefer she and I both be in the house every day where women belong--lol),<br/>
but I&#39;m happy that he&#39;s noticed one small glimps of something good in<br/>
unschooling.  That&#39;s a big step for him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to translate the Eragon article into Portuguese and print it out<br/>
for him to read.<br/>

Maybe some other reason, because Montana doesn&#39;t require portfolios.  I<br/>
guess they could have been using a correspondence school or something<br/>
that might have required it.  <br/>
<br/>
Can we count little kid books because I bet we read those Thomas the Tank<br/>
Engine books to Dylan at least three thousand times.&lt;g&gt;   I used to dream<br/>
about Sir Topham Hat.  (Not THAT kind of dream!!)  He read a couple<br/>
hundred Goosebumps books which are now in boxes in the eves. <br/>
<br/>
We have that book, Eragon but haven&#39;t read it yet.  It&#39;s in the &quot;read<br/>

But two of those are bird books and I&#39;m probably the only one interested<br/>
