Yeah...definitely. I didn&#39;t think anyone was reacting in an extreme manner enough to warrant a &quot;lighten up&quot; that&#39;s all. Different sense of humor I suppose.<br/>
I see the way Trevor pulls away now, and I know that most of the time if I just ask him &quot;Can I give you a hug, it seems like you need one&quot; he nods his head and suddenly all his bravado fades away. They&#39;re still the same person, just going through another phase in life. I wouldn&#39;t like someone using an analogy that I&#39;m like a loyal, loving dog most of the time but when my period hits I become aloof like a cat. I don&#39;t think Trevor would enjoy the analogy either...I guess that&#39;s how I try to analyze things, how it looks to my child and how it would make them feel.<br/>

<br/>
This is so true.<br/>
Just today my 10yo had some friends over, and they were all <br/>
skateboarding out front.  He&#39;d had a sleep over the night before and <br/>
was pretty tired, and I could sense that he was getting touchy and <br/>
grumpy with his friends and needed some input, some mothering, some <br/>
SOMEthing.<br/>
When he came inside I had a quick talk with him about thinking <br/>
before speaking or acting, and then I was overcome with this urge to <br/>
hold him.  So I said &quot;do you need a hug?&quot; and pulled him on my lap <br/>
in a sort of goofy/giggly way and rocked him and started to sing to <br/>
him a favorite lullaby song from when he was a toddler.  I was <br/>
pretending he was still my baby in a goofy sort of way.  He got all <br/>
smiley and happy and pretended to struggle, and then when he finally <br/>
got away to go back outside he had a huge grin on his face just like <br/>
a rainbow came out, and he was better with his friends after that.<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about it... it&#39;s almost like he&#39;s torn between a <br/>
part of him pulling away and a part of him needing that physical <br/>
nurturing, and I&#39;ve realized that pretending that I&#39;m kidding with <br/>
him allows him that &quot;babying&quot; and at the same time lets him see <br/>
himself as &quot;too old&quot; for that.  (Since I&#39;m pretending to be the <br/>
needy Mom and he&#39;s pretending to struggle).  It&#39;s difficult to put <br/>
into words, but I think it&#39;s my close connection with him that <br/>
allows me to perceive the non-verbal stuff so well.<br/>
<br/>
As far as that cat/dog thing being either funny or sadly reflective <br/>
of society... I think some jokes can be both.<br/>
Does anyone remember the commercial a few years ago- I think it was <br/>
for Staples or a store like it- about back to school supplies?  It <br/>
aired at the end of the summer, and consisted of the song &quot;It&#39;s the <br/>
most wonderful time of the year...&quot; (a part of the Christmas song) <br/>
and the Dad was all happy and jauntily tossing school supplies into <br/>
the shopping cart while the kids pouted behind him.  While one part <br/>
of me thought it was a very, very sad reflection (I don&#39;t need to <br/>
explain to any of you why), at the same time I could see why the <br/>
average Joe would find it amusing.<br/>
