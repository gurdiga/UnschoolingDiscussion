I will definately be visiting at least twice, in order to get to know her,<br/>
and talk with her foster parents, Case Worker and others about her history.<br/>
 I will probably be staying for a little bit at least, to give her some<br/>
time to know me alittle and make her own decision.  I have two babies at<br/>
home and I have to make sure that she can adjust to our home and family and<br/>
will not act out abusively towards the little ones.<br/>

&gt;Hey Nanci, Columbia is only a couple hours from us too.  If you feel like<br/>
&gt;traveling, come see us.<br/>
&gt;Though if you are picking up your daughter that will probably be enough.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hi ya Priss,<br/>
&gt;&gt; I just had to say something to you for a couple of reasons.  First of all,<br/>
&gt;&gt; are you anywhere near Columbia, South Carolina?  The little girl we are<br/>
&gt;&gt; adopting is located somewhere near there (her Case Worker is in Columbia.)<br/>
&gt;&gt; The other thing is, my husband is an Engineer too!  What type of engineer<br/>
&gt;&gt; is your dh?  Mine is Mechanical, and he is behind the unschooling 120%  He<br/>
&gt;&gt; can see the benefits from the more relaxed, unforced methods.  He learns<br/>
&gt;&gt; better himself that way, with his own motivation.  The first thing he said<br/>
&gt;&gt; when I told him about unschooling, the day I discovered it here, was about<br/>
&gt;&gt; the best class he ever took in college and how relaxed the teachers style<br/>
&gt;&gt; was.  &quot;I remember more from that class than any other class I took.&quot; he<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638941094">Will you be traveling with the kids, or do just you come and meet her first?<br/>
Such a huge step.<br/>
I know I&#39;m not the kind of person who could do such a thing, I&#39;m glad there is<br/>
people like you who will.  There are so many kids in need.<br/>

I am sure that I will be coming on my own at least the first time.  That<br/>
will be when we decide if she is a good match for us, and if we should then<br/>
proceed with her adoption.  We have purely selfish reasons of wanting a<br/>
little daughter all our own, and a sister for our boys, so don&#39;t go making<br/>
saints out of us!  I don&#39;t think I could live up to that!<br/>
