<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968693886">I just want to say thank you all so much for your ideas, experiences, <br/>
and suggestions! It helped Eric so much to hear other people&#39;s <br/>
experiences! He was getting so down on himself that it was making his <br/>
situation even harder for him. The reason he wanted to change the <br/>
earring is because he wants a small silver loop. Right now he has a <br/>
gold one, and wants to change it. However, finding a small loop that <br/>
has a straight post has been difficult. Sandra, thank you for <br/>
mentioning that it should be straight, the one we were planning to put <br/>
in is a bit curved. So, for now I think we will clean it with sea <br/>
salt, and wait awhile. In the meantime, we will try to find a small <br/>
loop with a straight post. It was a great idea to find a place that <br/>
does piercings as an art, I think we will try to find one. <br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you for your ideas! The stress level for Eric has gone <br/>
down dramatically. He is feeling more positive today-thank you thank <br/>
you!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Amie</div>

Maybe you can straighten the end, and the curve it back with small  <br/>
pliers after it&#39;s in.<br/>
