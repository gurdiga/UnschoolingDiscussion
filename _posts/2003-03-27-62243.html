 So... the consumerism is me and my washing machine, proof of income and <br/>
 status. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too.<br/>
It gives me a feeling of abundance to have a washer and dryer, very important <br/>
to me.<br/>
My memories of a laundromat aren&#39;t nearly so dim as Sandra&#39;s, but it was <br/>
during the time in my married life in which money was scarce.<br/>
We had one beater car, a new baby and barely made it paycheck to paycheck. At <br/>
least it was an apartment laundromat most of the time, but all those memories <br/>
are tied up with lack, collections and stress.<br/>
So I really like my washer and dryer.<br/>
<br/>
Good for Holly not having those lame associations with laundromats!! :)<br/>
<br/>
And I wish I saved my Downy ball, I just threw it out recently while <br/>
organizing.<br/>
It IS a cool thing, but I like the way laundry smells and feels when I pour <br/>
it in myself.<br/>
It is more concentrated or something.<br/>
I may just switch back to vinegar again, it does work really well and it&#39;s so <br/>
much cheaper and better for the environment.<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, it was worth trying. That would be a good unschooling quest, <br/>
what is in the dumpsters in the northern part of the province and <br/>
what is in the dumpsters in the southern part of the province.<br/>
My mom was talking to a fellow in the dumpster in her building today, <br/>
and he was having a good time and finding good stuff. When my son <br/>
sees people in the dumpster, we have a good old talk about recycling, <br/>
helping others with challenges, etc. Now I will have to add the <br/>
search for large green garbage bags full of herbs.<br/>

&lt;&gt;Nice try, Nancy.  &lt;G&gt;  I don&#39;t think he&#39;d be happy for me to tell <br/>
anyone, if I knew, which I don&#39;t.  But I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s true all <br/>
over the province.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For those who are interested check out Ann Arbor, MI, the city that <br/>
went to decriminalization of certain green stuff back in the &#39;70s and <br/>
has maintained that position, off and on depending on fluctuating <br/>
political regimes, allowing folks to  practice their agrarian skills <br/>
with small amounts of their own homegrown greenery and to taste the <br/>
fruits of their efforts without going to jail.  Of course that was <br/>
only within the Ann Arbor city limits, not on campus (University of <br/>
Michigan) and not in the surrounding county areas.  No need to go <br/>
dumpster diving in Ann Arbor, or many other little secret pockets of <br/>
sanity around the country.  Since 1973, 12 state legislatures -- <br/>
Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, <br/>
Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Oregon -- have <br/>
enacted versions of decriminalization. In each of these states, MJ <br/>
users no longer face jail time (nor in most cases, arrest or criminal <br/>
records) for the possession or use of small amounts of greenery. <br/>
Internationally, many states and nations have enacted similar <br/>
policies.<br/>
<br/>
I cite Ann Arbor because that&#39;s the place I know about personally and <br/>
research data from Ann Arbor revealed that during a period where drug <br/>
policy oscillated between &quot;prohibition, reduction of penalties (but <br/>
still involving possible imprisonment), &#39;decriminalization&#39; (maximum <br/>
penalty of a $5 fine), reinstatement of severe penalties, and <br/>
finally, a return to &#39;decriminalization&#39;&quot; there was no change in MJ <br/>
use rates. Finally, the researcher Single reports through the <br/>
analysis of national drug use surveys of students conducted since <br/>
1975, the impact of the changing law resulted in no effect on this <br/>
substance&#39;s use among high school seniors. <br/>
<br/>
Just that I don&#39;t think many folks know about these kinds of things.  <br/>
Nor about the studies that indicate that decriminalization does not <br/>
lead to higher crime rates or other abuses that certain groups like <br/>
to tout.  Anyone know of any other pockets of sanity they might want <br/>
to acknowledge?  Isn&#39;t it still legal to grow your own in Alaska?  Or <br/>
did that one change, too?<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record I am not a member of NORML and I do not advocate <br/>
use of this substance, nor do I personally use it.  Heck, I don&#39;t <br/>
even drink coffee!  And as a homeopath I don&#39;t advocate the use of <br/>
any substance that might complicate the symptom picture for me.  <br/>
However I also have been involved in several prison reform study <br/>
groups and find that the kinds of laws that throw people in jail and <br/>
force them to pay for lawyers, set them up with a criminal record for <br/>
this type of activity, including points toward various states&#39; &quot;3 <br/>
strikes&quot; policies, often do contribute to criminalizing people and <br/>
turning them from happy productive citizens to those of branded <br/>
criminality; a stigma that isn&#39;t always easy to shake, unless you are <br/>
a rock star or movie icon, of course.<br/>

Alaska is no longer on that list, at least it wasn&#39;t right after I moved away.<br/>
While I was growing up it was legal to buy, but not sell marijuana. Go figure.<br/>
And it was illegal to grow it...always. So it wasn&#39;t exactly complete <br/>
decriminalization.<br/>
It&#39;s not legal now,  my Dad was one of the major people fighting to make it <br/>
illegal again. <br/>
