Once things are put out in public they&#39;re public!  <br/>
Posting it back to a similarly public place (or the same one, I don&#39;t <br/>
remember &lt;g&gt;) is fine.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4555228">Hi Heather,<br/>
I&#39;m glad that you found something useful in my story and that you can relate. Your struggles and conflicts you are feeling sound so familiar to me. I always felt better after we &quot;accomplished&quot; something during the day. But achieving the accomplishment was always our problem. I think you are well on your way to unschooling, you are listening to your children! Now you just have to work on deschooling yourself a bit more. For me, that entailed reading and reading. Learning about how others went through the same experience and how happy they were now. Knowing that I wanted those things for my family, too. And learning to let go and trust and respect my kids. To live our lives joyfully without chains dragging us down.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I can do this, but I hope Sandra won&#39;t mind. It&#39;s something she wrote about what moms can do if they feel the need of accomplishing something, or checklisting their day while still unschooling. I saved it and refer to it sometimes if I feel the need. I really like the ideas she had. <br/>

One way for moms who love to checklist their days to provide without managing <br/>
is to go afield of verbal presentation.  Go through a list of the senses.  <br/>
And if each day you try to provide something interesting to taste, touch, <br/>
hear, see and smell, his day will be more full than flat.  Too many families <br/>
stop at things to hear and see. (Because school stops there, I guess.)<br/>
<br/>
But you don&#39;t have to do this until he&#39;s 17.  You can do it until you&#39;re <br/>
confident that he&#39;s filled with experiences to cross-reference at his own <br/>
leisure (in dreams, in fantasies, in future incidents which remind him of <br/>
those, etc.) and you feel satisfied that you&#39;re not a slacker.<br/>
<br/>
If just &quot;the five sense&quot; seems a lame checklist and you want four dimensional <br/>
instead of three, maybe each day work into conversation something about the <br/>
past and something about the future.  (I can hardly imagine a day without <br/>
those coming up naturally in my own family, but in case you&#39;re not really <br/>
talkative or something, it&#39;s something for the checklist.)  If it comes up <br/>
naturally in conversation you could say &quot;They didnt&#39; even have chainsaws <br/>
until... [whenever little gasoline engines were common, or whatever the <br/>
seminal technological feature is] and would have had to do all this with a <br/>
hand saw, or an axe.  (That&#39;s if you cut firewood with a chainsaw, not if <br/>
you&#39;re sitting around working a jigsaw puzzle of tiger cubs in the forest.)  <br/>
Or you could say &quot;How long do you think we will have these dishes?  When too  <br/>
many are broken, what kind should we get next?&quot; (if you have a girl with <br/>
those sorts of interests).  Various kinds of mind-casting conversations into <br/>
the past (personal past or technological past or cultural past or planetary <br/>
past) or into the future (tomorrow, next year, next century) help kids build <br/>
their internal model of the universe.  I know I&#39;ve used that phrase half a <br/>
dozen times talking about unschooling, but I think it&#39;s one of the coolest <br/>
ideas.  <br/>
<br/>

Thanks so much for writing this - I am going through this exact thing myself. I feel this tremendous guilt sometimes that if I am not &quot;schooling&quot; - then I am not doing my job... Today for example, my 7yr old has a drama class - she loves it. They are doing The Tempest by Shakespeare and the woman who is doing it is wonderful - She gets the kids moving and doing all kinds of fun things while she is introducing the story and the plots - they don&#39;t even feel like they are &quot;learning&quot; Shakespeare.  Today it snowed and though it wasn&#39;t too bad, they must have cancelled class . I come home and feel somehow that we should DO something... and start suggesting - when all she really wants to do is go out and play in the snow. So of course, she does - it may be the last snow for us in New England - but I feel that I have somehow failed to do my job today... as if the day was a waste...   I struggle with this constantly... I think I am not totally won over to the unschooling philosophy. I love the idea of it - but when it comes down to it - I think it is that I am impatient and unsure of myself. I love this list - I hope I will get to the point that you did... and really believe it whole heartedly. Thanks for your story - it does help some of us that are struggling with the same issue - to hopefully overcome it :)<br/>
