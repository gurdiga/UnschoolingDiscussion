<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988291502">Here here to Karen and her advice on portions....That is how I lost and <br/>
still am losing/maintaining my weight after the last baby (4 years <br/>
ago).  That and exercise.  Heidi, you said you were undermoving, maybe <br/>
you and your Daughter could find some form of exercise to do together.  <br/>
My boys (8 and 4) try to do some &quot;exercise&quot; everyday to &quot;keep our hearts <br/>
healthy&quot;.  Right now my older son is really into Yoga which probably <br/>
isn&#39;t doing his heart any good, but it is beneficial in other ways...Is <br/>
there any chance your daughter is eating because of emotional reasons?  <br/>
Bored, stressed, lonely, anxious?  My 4 year old will eat carrots and <br/>
yogurt all day and leave the cookies to his brother.  But even the 8 <br/>
year old leaves those for fruits and peanut butter most of the time, so <br/>
while I say I have an open kitchen policy, our choices are also <br/>
mostly&quot;healthy&quot; choices....certainly the ones within reach...and so far <br/>
I haven&#39;t had to be concerned about what they are eating...just to let <br/>
you know from what point of view I am coming....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a great suggestion - for both kids and adults! As a family, <br/>
we are very active and personally I know that I feel better <br/>
emotionally and eat way better when I stay active. When I am really <br/>
in active training (I do triathlons in the summer), I almost *can&#39;t* <br/>
eat sweet foods. They no longer taste good to me. It&#39;s very odd <br/>
(since usually I love my ice cream and chocolate!)<br/>
<br/>
Some things we do over the course of the week:<br/>
<br/>
- Homeschool gymnastics day (we rent out a big gymnastics place and <br/>
the kids have the run of it)<br/>
- Bicycling - if we go somewhere, we often bicycle. Both of my kids <br/>
(8 & 5) have been bicycling with me for years (we have a kid&#39;s <br/>
tandem attachment) and even my daughter (5) can go 7 or 8 miles on <br/>
her little 1-speed bike<br/>
- Walking - we have a little corner market we can walk down to. <br/>
Often if the weather is nice, we sit out and eat a popsicle or I <br/>
read the comics to them from the paper<br/>
- Swimming - we made a commitment to do at least one family swim <br/>
night a week. We often take some of the kids&#39; friends along and they <br/>
all have a blast. They can easily spend an hour or two in the pool.<br/>
- Mini-trampoline - we just have one of these in the house, for <br/>
whenever the kids want to use it<br/>
- Kids&#39; track meets and fun runs. Well, we do live in &quot;Track Town <br/>
USA&quot; so we are lucky there. There are lots of kids runs and the <br/>
local track club sponsors a kids&#39; track meet once a week in the <br/>
summer. They use the big real stadium at Hayward Field where greats <br/>
like Steve Prefontaine have competed and they can do any of the <br/>
track and field events they want.<br/>
- Just getting out and playing. Often we&#39;ll take gloves, mitts, and <br/>
bats out to the cul-de-sac, or a soccer ball, or chalk and mark out <br/>
a hopscotch game, or just go swing on the swings.<br/>
<br/>
These are all things we love to do and do for fun, so the kids stay <br/>
pretty active most of the time. Of course, they also have plenty of <br/>
indoor time and activities too. I think when kids feel active and <br/>
strong and healthy, it&#39;s great for their emotional health and also <br/>
they tend to eat healthily to fuel their bodies. <br/>
