On a list I&#39;m not on someone is being divisive and derisive.<br/>
I could&#39;ve ignored it as Jr. High girl behavior had it not contained a lie <br/>

I&#39;m leaving for a conference now.<br/>
Please be patient if approvals of moderated posts take a while on this list, <br/>
as some moderators will be at the Live and Learn conference. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>
