<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371742188">Ok, I have to throw my two cents in on this one.<br/>
<br/>
If you have come from a church that is firm in its need for everyone to be<br/>
indoctrinated, you should know that there are other sorts of churches in the<br/>
world.  There are churches where the sermon is designed to make you think,<br/>
to challenge you to see God in a different way.  There are churches that<br/>
worship in three completely different ways on Sundays, but still are held<br/>
together by a common foundation of faith.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t agree with everyone who worships at my church.  I have been a part<br/>
of 9 churches in my 10 years of marriage (military...we move a lot!).  While<br/>
my beliefs aren&#39;t a perfect match for perhaps any church, I&#39;ve had clergy<br/>
who encourage me to read, study, think, pray, and consider why I believe<br/>
what I do believe, so I can grow personally.  Much like I do as an<br/>
unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what you miss when you don&#39;t go to church: community.  I regularly<br/>
hear from people on this list that they&#39;re so glad to find this group,<br/>
because they don&#39;t know any other unschoolers.  So I know that community is<br/>
important to us.  <br/>
<br/>
Community isn&#39;t necessary, plenty of folks believe and are comfortable being<br/>
alone in their faith.  But community does provide you with much support.<br/>
Don&#39;t give up on churches entirely because you haven&#39;t found one that<br/>
doesn&#39;t ask you to check your brain at the door.  They&#39;re out there.<br/>
Really.<br/>

Episcopalian and proud of it.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I never liked the group<br/>
&gt; thinking mentality of church, or any other corporate entity for that<br/>
&gt; matter. I get so tired of hearing &quot;we believe&quot; and &quot;we think&quot; that I just<br/>
&gt; want to scream &quot;NO! WHAT DO *YOU* BELIEVE! WHAT DO *YOU* THINK!&quot; Anytime<br/>
&gt; an entire group of people *think* the same thing, there is no thinking at<br/>
&gt; all, imo. I have come to the belief that a vast majority of people like<br/>
&gt; to be indoctrinated. It releases them of all responsibility and reason.<br/>
&gt; If everyone at a church believed God could only be worshipped in one way,<br/>
&gt; I would doubt the motives of the church.  If everyone on a list thought<br/>
&gt; that there was only one way of unschooling, I would seriously have doubts<br/>
&gt; about the integrity of the list. Even though we sometimes disagree, I<br/>
&gt; value the free-thinking-ness of this list. Unfortunately, I have yet to<br/>
&gt; find a church<br/>
&gt; that offers the same. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680518283">A big part of what bothers me about churches is the clergy/laity <br/>
distinction.  The whole idea of sermons and no input from the <br/>

This is the church that I am unchurching from,  I do think that they tend to be on the more liberal side, but not quite liberal enough for me!           And each congregation can have its own personality,  even if the synod says its going to be a certain way, doesn&#39;t mean the members are going to be that way!       <br/>
 <br/>
What&#39;s been interesting around here is explaining to the kids why we aren&#39;t going to church right now.  Very good conversations.     Although if they wanted to go, I&#39;d take them,     hasn&#39;t happened tho&#39;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Although at first it sounds like you are giving up on a vital <br/>
institution in Christianity, there is actually a belief these days <br/>
that the institutional church (organized denominations with <br/>
buildings) are not carrying out the Christian mission anymore, and <br/>
true Christians should get out and seek other ways to live out their <br/>
faith.  <br/>
<br/>
One proponent of that belief is Harold Camping, and here is his <br/>
website on that subject:  http://www.lmsusa.com/Scripts/Job1/H%<br/>
20Camping%20Bible%20teachings.html<br/>
<br/>
Naturally there is disagreement, and here is a website to the <br/>
contrary:<br/>
http://www.familyradioiswrong.com/<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t studied either website (so don&#39;t flame me if you don&#39;t like <br/>
them) but, in my opinion, if you can&#39;t find a true solid Christ-<br/>
centered church and pastor, you are making the right choice to seek <br/>
fellowship and fulfillment outside a church.  Several Christian women <br/>
on this and other lists have stated that they are unchurching for <br/>
various yet similar reasons to yours.<br/>
<br/>
I would encourage anyone who unchurches to study the Bible daily to <br/>
keep up your spiritual enthusiasm.   The devil can quite easily <br/>
convince you to slack off and get discouraged about life, but the <br/>
Bible does a perfect job of chasing him off.<br/>

welcome to enjoy the fellowship of no one, or of small group Bible studies,<br/>
as you point out.  However, you said:<br/>

friends.  It&#39;s not a perfect place.  It&#39;s full of the fallible sort of<br/>
people you meet everywhere else.  But I hear a lot of people who have left<br/>
the church believing there is absolutely no place for them there.  But<br/>
different churches can be different.  That was merely my point.<br/>

the old style liturgy, although each denomination also has a<br/>
conservative<br/>
branch as well.  ELCA Lutherans for the most part do the same liturgy,<br/>
with<br/>
fewer words. (Episcopalians are wordy!)<br/>
<br/>
I often go church shopping on the internet.  Most places have webpages<br/>
that<br/>
are VERY revealing.<br/>

of their unschooling. They cite differences in philosophy and <br/>
theology, and have even received criticism of their lifestyle.  I <br/>
(and perhaps they) can relate to whomever said &quot;I love mankind; it&#39;s <br/>
people I can&#39;t stand.&quot;  I personally have visited a lot of churches <br/>
that make me wonder what their purpose is; it doesn&#39;t seem to be the <br/>
traditional one of praising and thanking God.<br/>
<br/>
My family and I belong to a church that we all love.  But when we <br/>
can&#39;t get to church, we read a portion of the Bible as a family, or <br/>
listen to a segment on tape.  The kids will retain what they heard <br/>
and be able to apply it to life for months or years afterwards <br/>
(rather to my surprise). <br/>
<br/>
If I didn&#39;t have a supportive, enjoyable church to attend, I would <br/>
spend regular time in the Bible.  Among its 66 books, I can always <br/>
find a chapter that applies to my situation, to encourage me or to <br/>
give me advice.<br/>

Gee, Mike,  even this 66 book thing is a problem for some.....ya know<br/>
those Catholics have more books in their Bibles.   And some people have<br/>
read a lot of the Gnostic gospels, though that doesn&#39;t make them part of<br/>

There aren&#39;t records of the discussions on which those decisions were based.  <br/>

Interestingly, those people who have been solidly involved with the very same <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-945714544">I think it depends on how you define church.  Most people define <br/>
church as a group of people who believe in Christ.  Therefore to be <br/>
an &quot;unchurcher&quot; would imply that you&#39;re believing in Christ without <br/>
participating in the institutional church rituals.  If you don&#39;t even <br/>
believe in Christ, you&#39;re probably not unchurching, you&#39;re simply a <br/>
non-Christian. <br/>
<br/>
Not that it&#39;s a huge deal what you call what it is that you do, it&#39;s <br/>
just how I see the word &quot;unchurch&quot;. <br/>

I&#39;ve also heard many many Christians describe a Jewish Synagogue as a &quot;Jewish <br/>

point. I assumed that unchurching meant finding spirituality outside of <br/>
religion, which is what I do, and I am not christian. <br/>

number of others. Those experiences lead me to think that the beliefs <br/>
of individual church members and pastors is what gives such a variety <br/>
to Christian church experiences today, rather than official doctrines <br/>
of different denominations, which are quite similar.  <br/>
<br/>
I recently ran across a statement by someone who has taken the time <br/>
to study this phenomenon.  He comes to a similar conclusion:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In John 17:21, Christ prayed for the body of Christ to be one.  One <br/>
of the goals of my ministry when I started over 11 years ago, was to <br/>
do what I could be bring unity to the body of Christ.  In some of my <br/>
post graduate theological studies, I did extensive research on over <br/>
150 mainline Christian denominations and what they believed, and what <br/>
separated them.  The fact is, they all hold the basic tenants of the <br/>
Christian faith.  It was usually on a wide array of theological <br/>
issues that made no difference to the main body of our faith that <br/>
there is disagreement and division.&quot;<br/>

groups turned into more organised churches they all bickered among themselves. the &#39;discussions&#39; weren&#39;t sit down and talk about it discussions but different congregations using different books and<br/>
scriptures. As the Roman church grew stronger they wished to establish themselves as the *real* church and wanted to decide what was doctrine and waht wasn&#39;t. Mosy congregations were autonomous of Rome<br/>
and a lot of the teacings that spread out were word of mouth and &#39;have you seen this bit&#39; type teachings.<br/>
Discussions makes it sound like there was a unified church before the Council of Carthage but there wasn&#39;t. There wasn&#39;t really unification afterwards either, not for a  hundred years or so as the power<br/>
of the Church of Rome grew, aided by military might.<br/>
The History of the early Church is fascinating and pretty gory.<br/>

interpreting what God is asking of them that causes the division. And it&#39;s<br/>
not just the people and pastors causing the differences. If that were so,<br/>
every denomination would have the same percentage of liberal congregations<br/>
and conservative as every other denomination. No, there are teachings that<br/>
are unique to the Baptists and Episcopalians and Catholics and other<br/>
denominations that keep them each centered around their own unique spot on<br/>
the scale.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the basic tenant of every healthy parent is to provide what&#39;s best<br/>

not going to come to any peaceful consensus on how to go about that.<br/>

you trying to say &quot;Lack of consensus does not imply there must then be a<br/>
lack of toleration?&quot; Are you seeing intolerance because there is<br/>

ways to practice that religion with my family without going to church.  I <br/>
find that the church can be very draining and I don&#39;t agree with some of <br/>
their interpretations.  In the same way my boys learn without school.  I <br/>
worship without church. (simplistic I guess)<br/>
