from every experience and experiences happen IN ORDER to teach us something.<br/>
Many things happen for no reason, but you can still take a valuable lesson<br/>
from them.<br/>
<br/>
Many years ago, someone blew up a house I was living in. Some people<br/>
actually asked me what it was about my life that caused that to happen. I<br/>
have learned many things through having had that experience, but no one<br/>
could ever convince me that there was anything about my life that CAUSED<br/>
that.<br/>
