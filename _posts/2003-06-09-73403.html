<div id="ygrps-yiv-360204202">My very intense 2y.o. came out to the kitchen and upon seeing his brothers <br/>
quilt in the laundry, hauled it out and started trying to lay it flat.<br/>
He struggled and struggled with it and finally screamed in frustration. I <br/>
offered to help and got it layed flat and neat, but it took several tries and <br/>
some tears and screaming before we finally got it just right.<br/>
<br/>
At that point, I&#39;m just glad he isn&#39;t loudly crying anymore. I can&#39;t think of <br/>
why he could possibly want this blanket layed out JUST RIGHT but he seems <br/>
happy now.<br/>
You have to visualize this quilt. It&#39;s got several squares of a little boy <br/>
with a fishing pole and four outside squares with different scenes.<br/>
Jalen excitedly points to the pictures and does his &quot;tttttttthhhhhhhhhhhh&quot; <br/>
sound. <br/>
Then I see him squatting in front of the quilt, just staring and pointing and <br/>
being very quiet. I watch for a long time...it&#39;s really quite amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, he shows me some items in one of the pictures. A football, a <br/>
baseball and an apple. Familiar things he is happy to see there.  We sit and point to <br/>
different items, each one gets a &quot;ttttthhhhhhhhhh&quot; of course. :)<br/>
I go and get a real apple. He sees it and gets REALLY excited. We cut it up <br/>
and he grabs a chunk and goes back to his squatting/picture watching again. <br/>
This goes on for some time, this apple grabbing and squatting back down in front <br/>
of the quilt. It was really cool.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier today, a newer friend called. She said she had dreamed about Jalen <br/>
and it had to do with his mind and his intellect. Told me I really, really <br/>
needed to go buy &quot;The Indigo Child&quot; (which I&#39;d heard of from some of you) because <br/>
she feels very strongly he is an Indigo Child.<br/>
The day she first came to our group, this child of mine had the connections <br/>
between her and her belongings so quickly, that when a piece fell off of her <br/>
cell phone, he brought it to her immedietly. (she was on the other side of the <br/>
room at the time, I hadn&#39;t even noticed she HAD a cell phone with her and she&#39;d <br/>
been there all of 15 minutes).....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just thought it was really cool to see the 2.5 y.o. connections <br/>
being made tonight. And he said &quot;Appo&quot; when I pulled the apple from the fridge <br/>
instead of the usual &quot;tthhhh&quot;.:) Quilts and apples......who needs preschool?<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s so great. I pictured every moment as you wrote it. I could see him<br/>
and you. Thanks for sharing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Alyssa is 2 1/2 and had a rough day. She fell off the playroom table again<br/>
for like the 5th time. I was out with Sierra and she had been very busy even<br/>
after I came home. Building things with Joseph and then Sierra too. Big<br/>
things with foam blocks that the cat would go in. Not sure if that&#39;s what it<br/>
was for but she liked that Schnell (Chanel) liked it too.<br/>
<br/>
Lat night she came and laid in my arms and hugged me and said, &quot;what&#39;s that&quot;<br/>
as she pointed to my chest and then gave my nose a tap when I looked down.<br/>
Then she said, &quot;Mommy, you&#39;re my friend.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tonight as I tucked her in bed, she told me I was her favorite mommy. Sierra<br/>
thought that was real funny. Alyssa was totally serious. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for making me remember again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-347585274">That is really neat!  I love watching them do things.  Especially now that<br/>
we&#39;ve found joy again.  Thanks so much for sharing that.<br/>
