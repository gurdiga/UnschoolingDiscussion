<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295985841">Just curious ... does anyone have statistics on the reasons why people <br/>
choose to homeschool (I&#39;m lumping unschooling into that term)?  It <br/>
irritates the hell out of me when people, who are in no way involved in <br/>
any form of homeschooling, try to tell me why people choose to do it!  <br/>
One friend in particular told me that &quot;it&#39;s a fact that MOST people <br/>
choose to homeschool for religious reasons.&quot;  I know of no such fact!  <br/>
However, I generally don&#39;t have a good arguement without solid <br/>
information (in other words, I&#39;m not interested in shooting off my <br/>
mouth if I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about).  Can you tell this bugs <br/>
me?  I don&#39;t really know why, as I shouldn&#39;t care what other people <br/>
think.  I&#39;m just looking for information ...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734913089">-=-One friend in particular told me that &quot;it&#39;s a fact that MOST<br/>
people choose to homeschool for religious reasons.&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
I believe that&#39;s true.  If it&#39;s not true now, it was ten years ago  <br/>
when there was a big survey and people said why they were unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Why does it make you mad, though?<br/>
<br/>
What if it made mer mad that people who didn&#39;t live in New Mexico  <br/>
tried to tell me stuff about New Mexico?  Someone who has read recent/ <br/>
current articles or history or who just knows a lot about some aspect  <br/>
or other of government or geology could EASILY tell me things about  <br/>
New Mexico that I don&#39;t know.  I have a friend who knows WAY more  <br/>
English history than probably anyone in England knows, outside of a  <br/>
small handful of medieval history professors, and he was there once  <br/>
(to be in the re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings a few years  <br/>
ago).  He knows LITTLE details, because of his interest and memory.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s not worth getting emotional about other people knowing about  <br/>
homeschooling.  It&#39;s not a secret society or anything.<br/>
<br/>
It kinda bugs me when people who are  homeschooling like to assume  <br/>
they&#39;re the norm or the average.  NO unschoolers are the norm or the  <br/>
average.  There are way (WAY) more families using school-at-home, and  <br/>
some of them don&#39;t even know we exist.  That&#39;s fine.  But I don&#39;t  <br/>
think it&#39;s nearly as fine for unschoolers not to know of the huge  <br/>
conservative body of Christian homeschoolers in the United States.   <br/>
Some countries are spared.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here is unaware of the HSLDA, of Bob Jones University&#39;s  <br/>
ties with unschooling, with  (is it Liberty College?) the college  <br/>
that&#39;s preparing young homeschooled men to take over the U.S.  <br/>
government?  Which college is that?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a peek through a pinhole at portion of the tip of that iceberg:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>US Dept of Education did statistical studies in 1999 and 2003.<br/>
<br/>
In 1999, they found that three reasons for homeschooling were most  <br/>
frequently cited:<br/>
49% said &quot;ability to give child a better education;&quot; 38% gave  <br/>
religious reasons; 26% said it was because of a poor learning  <br/>
environment at school.<br/>
<br/>
In 2003, they first asked parents to state any/all reasons contributed  <br/>
to their decision to homeschool, and then they asked them which was  <br/>
the most important reason.<br/>
<br/>
So - in answer to the first question, 85% said they were concerned  <br/>
about the school environment, 72% said they wanted to provide  <br/>
religious or moral instruction, and 68% said they were dissatisfied  <br/>
with the academic instruction in schools.<br/>
<br/>
When asked what was the most important reason, 31% said it was concern  <br/>
about the school environment; 30% said it was to provide religious or  <br/>
moral instruction; 16% said it was dissatisfaction with academic  <br/>
instruction in schools.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are pretty good studies - reasonably reliable data. They  <br/>
definitely have less bias than all the NHERI/HSLDA studies.  The  <br/>
studies were done by the National Center for Education Statistics and  <br/>
I think they&#39;re titled: &quot;Homeschooling in the United States:1999&quot; and   <br/>
&quot;Homeschooling in the United States:2003,&quot; although I may have the  <br/>
title of the first one wrong.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Patrick Henry College - young men AND women.<br/>
<br/>
There is a book about Patrick Henry College that is fascinating - here  <br/>
is the Publisher Weekly review of it, which contains some info about  <br/>
Patrick Henry College itself:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Envisioned by its founder as a &quot;Christian equivalent of the Ivy  <br/>
League,&quot; Patrick Henry College positions itself as a training ground  <br/>
for God&#39;s cultural soldiers to take on the secular mainstream; at the  <br/>
seven-year-old Virginia school for evangelicals, religion and  <br/>
political journalist Rosin reports, girls are warned by e-mail if  <br/>
their bra strap is showing, dating requires parental permission and  <br/>
students fast forward through sex scenes in movies. Though they might  <br/>
seem out of touch, students here are as ambitious as any Ivy Leaguers,  <br/>
interning in the White House and Hollywood, volunteering on political  <br/>
campaigns and doggedly pursuing studies like baraminology (creationist  <br/>
biology). Having spent a year and a half immersed in the campus  <br/>
culture, Rosin weaves a deft and honest narrative of evangelical  <br/>
education, combining historical background (the roots of evangelism,  <br/>
the story of founder Michael Farris), close observation and skeptical  <br/>
wit. Among other students and faculty, Rosin introduces Derek, the  <br/>
fresh-faced, idealistic political volunteer; and Farahn, who gave up  <br/>
dancing for the Lord. Making it clear that the American evangelical  <br/>
population is growing in political and cultural influence, Rosin  <br/>
provides an illuminating, accessible guide to the beliefs, aspirations  <br/>
and ongoing challenges of its next generation. &quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can relate to some of your feelings of frustration.  I had a schoolteacher cousin once tell <br/>
me what unschooling was without ever asking me one question.  She is a &quot;need to know <br/>
more than you&quot; type who, after her first child, was looking at tapping into the <br/>
homeschooling market as a tutor, so she&#39;d done her research.<br/>
<br/>
Although a little irritating, I just  chalked it up to her issues in not wanting to create <br/>
connection with me around the topic--she just wanted to establish superior knowledge <br/>
because that&#39;s who she is.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your friend is a little threatened by your lifestyle--or maybe she&#39;s even thinking <br/>
about it in the back of her mind and trying to see if she might fit into that world.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny how clear it is from the outside that engaging her in arugument isn&#39;t going to <br/>
make your life happier, because there can be steep costs to either engaging or winning an <br/>
argument with a friend.  When I&#39;m in that kind of situation it&#39;s not always clear!  lol<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s for sure.<br/>
<br/>
When the adrenaline is upon me, I just want to win, and in the case  <br/>
of someone thinking they knew more about unschooling than I did, I&#39;m  <br/>
sure I would not look back to my friends saying &quot;let it go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Twice  now adults (unschoolers I think both times) have left snarky  <br/>
notes for Holly somewhere.  I guess it&#39;s because they have something  <br/>
against me and are too afraid to leave something directly to or for  <br/>
me, so they went to Holly!?  The urge came upon me to go and do or  <br/>
say, but they&#39;ve already proven they&#39;re small and lame by picking on  <br/>
a little girl.  So probably the best thing to do is nothing.  But the  <br/>
emotional core of me thinks otherwise. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-792059940">This reminded me of when I was in school, and other children tried to tell me what I believed in - as in,  my &quot;religion&quot; was not Christian and did not believe in Christ - DUH - the word Christ was in the name of our church!   ;)  I always just laughed and moved on (unless I was on the bus and then I&#39;d just ignore them) .  They wanted to argue and I think it frustrated them that I would not argue with them.  We were the only family of that &quot;religion&quot; in that elementary and then high school.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-990986676">When unschoolers express disbelief that unschoolers are a small  <br/>
minority, it&#39;s good for them to know that a big unschooling  <br/>
conference will draw a few hundred people from EVERYwhere, but a big  <br/>
homeschooling conference can draw thousands of people in some of the  <br/>
states of the SE U.S. and the people there will be almost exclusively  <br/>
Christian (or overtly exclusively Christian, depending on the  <br/>
conference).  THOUSANDS of people.  One state (any of several).<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of other kinds of homeschoolers, in the range between  <br/>
the most conservative and the most liberal (if we get the &quot;most  <br/>
liberal&quot; end of the single line I just made up &lt;bwg&gt;), but we are an  <br/>
elite group, doing something that can&#39;t be bought off the shelf, that  <br/>
can&#39;t be picked up and put down, that can&#39;t be forced on anyone.  A  <br/>
church or a support group or even a judge can say a family must use a  <br/>
certain curriculum, in the way it&#39;s designed to be used.   Trying to  <br/>
force someone to unschool would be like pushing a rope.<br/>
