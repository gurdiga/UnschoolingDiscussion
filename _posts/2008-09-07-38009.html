<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437835556">&lt;&lt;&lt;The reason the AlwaysUnschooled list was created is that I objected<br/>
to people with babies saying they were unschoolers. Sometimes I feel<br/>
one way about it and sometimes I feel another, but I just found this<br/>
comment on a blog, out there, by &quot;anonymous&quot; and it reinforces my<br/>
feeling that it clutters up unschooling for people to say they&#39;ve<br/>
done it if they give up at &quot;school age.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As one of the original founders of Always Unschooled, I feel gently <br/>
called to defend the concept of the list very simply by paraphrasing <br/>
the list description: to discuss how the principles of unschooling <br/>
apply to young children up to the age of 8 or so. Part, a really big <br/>
part, of the goal was to help people see how the attachment parenting <br/>
ideas and ideals they were living, or could be living, *could* <br/>
seamlessly and beautifully carry forward to the school years, that <br/>
there was no need to change what they were doing in response to their <br/>
kids suddenly becoming school age.<br/>
<br/>
It was not to promote how like unschooling AP is, but rather to point <br/>
out how like AP unschooling is, especially when it is real radical <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If someone posted the sentiments expressed in that disappointing blog <br/>
post on Always Unschooled a pretty spirited discussion of all those <br/>
issues mentioned would ensue. That person would be strongly <br/>
encouraged to rethink those plans. <br/>
<br/>
Probably the authenticity of their &quot;unschooling&quot; up to now would be <br/>
questioned. They would be challenged to justify their beliefs and the <br/>
clarity of their thinking. Many of the ladies over on AU are <br/>
extremely rigorous intellectually, and just as picky about word use <br/>
and mindful speech as anyone here. (And much smarter than me!)<br/>
<br/>
I relinquished co-ownership of the list once Jayn was a little past <br/>
school age in CA, because I felt it kept me looking backwards instead <br/>
of focussing such writing as I had time for on how Jayn is now. I was <br/>
overwhelmed by the volume and time I was spending on line - so I cut <br/>
back on participating in many lists, leaving the archives available <br/>
when I need to refresh my memory.<br/>
<br/>
But up to that time, the list was extremely valuable to me and <br/>
definitely helped me with my unschooling foundation.<br/>

I know.  It wasn&#39;t criticism of that list, it was criticism of me.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s probably best for readers to have that place to focus on  <br/>
very young children, and this list to more for older ones.   It&#39;s not  <br/>
as though either list is hurting for members or traffice.  But there  <br/>
are problems.  If people there are hearing mostly from others with  <br/>
only very young children, they&#39;re not getting the depth and breadth  <br/>
of advice they would get from people who have done it long enough to  <br/>
look back and see what they might&#39;ve done differently.    I&#39;m pretty  <br/>
sure there are people there who are on other lists too, though, so I  <br/>
hope that has taken care of that concern.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991591252">I don&#39;t think AlwaysUnschooled needs defending.  It is a great list<br/>
and there are a lot of good things about having a list focused on<br/>
younger children.  I read AlwaysUnschooled for quite a while and found<br/>
it to be very helpful.  It was what got me from where I started<br/>
(planning to be an ecclectic or relaxed homeschooler) to really having<br/>
radical unschooling ideas sinking in and deciding that this is how I<br/>
wanted to live.  I ended up stopping reading it and finding myself<br/>
more interested in this list at some point, but that&#39;s just me.<br/>
AlwayUnschooled is an excellent list and I am really glad that it was<br/>
created :)<br/>
