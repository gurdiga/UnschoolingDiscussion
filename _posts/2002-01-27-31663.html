Dalai Lama Hospitalized in Bombay<br/>

<br/>
BOMBAY, India  Looking weak but still smiling, the Dalai Lama was <br/>
admitted into a Bombay hospital Sunday after doctors detected a lump in his <br/>
stomach.<br/>
<br/>
Wearing his red Buddhist robe, the supreme leader of Tibetan Buddhists <br/>
walked into Lilawati Hospital with the help of aides.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Dalai Lama is cheerful and talking to his associates,&quot; Prakash Mhatre, <br/>
a director at Lilawati Hospital, said later.<br/>
<br/>
Mhatre said doctors were taking X-rays and conducting ultrasound and blood <br/>
tests. He said test results were expected Monday.<br/>
<br/>
The Dalai Lama, 66, had undergone a medical checkup at the same hospital in <br/>
early December. &quot;He was found to be completely normal then,&quot; Mhatre said.<br/>
<br/>
The Dalai Lama was earlier flown to Bombay in a private airplane from <br/>
Patna, the capital of the eastern state of Bihar, with two federal <br/>
government officials, his close aides and doctors.<br/>
<br/>
He was taken to Patna in a government helicopter from the religious hub of <br/>
Gaya, where health problems forced him to cancel his engagements at the <br/>
most sacred worship ceremony of Tibetan Buddhists.<br/>
<br/>
The Tibetan spiritual leader had been complaining of abdominal pain and <br/>
exhaustion and was examined by a team of doctors in a Buddhist monastery in <br/>
Bodhgaya, where he had been staying since last week, said Masood Butt, his <br/>
press coordinator. It then was decided he would fly to Bombay.<br/>
<br/>
A member of the medical team, A.M. Rai, said the Dalai Lama had a lump in <br/>
his stomach, but gave no further details.<br/>
<br/>
On Thursday, the Dalai Lama postponed his teachings before tens of <br/>
thousands of followers at a special service. He said he would not be able <br/>
to finish the rituals, which require him to sit still for at least five hours.<br/>
<br/>
The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 with thousands of supporters after a <br/>
failed uprising against China. Since then, he has headed a <br/>
government-in-exile in the northern Indian town of Dharmsala. He was <br/>
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his nonviolent struggle against <br/>
Chinese rule.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266046724">Thanks for the post. I read today that he is leaving the hospital and did<br/>
not, in fact, have a lump at all. Some member of his medical team mistakenly<br/>
said that. Thank goodness :-)<br/>

email from my Buddhist list today!  Stomach cancer is a major cause of<br/>
death in the Tibetan refugee community. <br/>
