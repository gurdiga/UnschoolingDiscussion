<div id="ygrps-yiv-487918340"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Whether or not they are &quot;getting him/her ready for school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just got a notice in my mailbox yesterday that our local school district is<br/>
sponsoring a &quot;school readiness workshop&quot; -- an all-day Saturday workshop for<br/>
parents, free of charge, where they will listen to early childhood educators<br/>
talk about how to help their child be ready to face the challenges of<br/>
kindergarten.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously. No joke. Sometimes I forget what the rest of the world (the<br/>
nonunschooling part of it) is really like.<br/>

<br/>
The schools here last week had a four hour orientation on Saturday for<br/>
middle-schoolers (6th grade). Four hours? To know how to find a locker and<br/>
where your classes are? Without parents, of course. And without what you<br/>
really need to know to survive middle school, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
Public school started here yesterday. I hugged my six year old until she<br/>
asked me what was going on and I told her I was so glad she was here and not<br/>
gone on a school bus at 7 a.m. She still doesn&#39;t have the concept that we<br/>
homeschool; when people ask her where she goes to school, she&#39;ll mention the<br/>
enrichment classes she takes. What we do here, that&#39;s just fun, for her (and<br/>
for me!)<br/>
