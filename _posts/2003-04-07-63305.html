 </span></blockquote>Ugh. Me too. From someone who got it somewhere in the middle. We started <br/>
unschooling at age 9. Damage was already done. I had never heard of <br/>
homeschooling until I had online access back in &#39;96 or so. I didn&#39;t think I <br/>
could handle being her teacher. Didn&#39;t hear of unschooling until my dd was in <br/>
3rd grade. This morning I found an old file full of 3rd grade report cards, <br/>
school letters, and even notes I made preparing for another conference on how <br/>
to handle my misbehaving daughter. Double UGH. Is there anyway to undo the <br/>
damage? For so long I insisted that she behave and go to school and perform. <br/>
I can remember in 2nd grade the teacher would send home a daily <br/>
accountability note, and the tone of the whole evening was set on whether she <br/>
got a good note or bad, most times she never measured up. I was so worried <br/>
about how I looked as a parent who couldn&#39;t control her child. Ugh all over <br/>
again. Now that we have unschooled for over a year, and it all makes sense, I <br/>
worry about all the years that we forced schooling and learning and behaving. <br/>
It breaks my heart to hear other unschoolers on this list say their kids <br/>
never lie, they don&#39;t have to. Their kids are not afraid of punishment. My <br/>
daughter has been lying to me for years. I try so hard to just forgive <br/>
myself, I truly didn&#39;t know any better. But as the end of the school year <br/>
approaches, and she wants to go back next year to middle school, I can&#39;t help <br/>
but think it is a result of being in the system so long. She thinks she needs <br/>
schooling. She doesn&#39;t feel right &quot;doing nothing&quot; around here, and when she <br/>
does get into certain topics, she hardly finishes anything and calls herself <br/>
lazy and stupid. I have tried to explain learning happens all the time. How <br/>
can she trust me? After I sent her to school for so long and demanded <br/>
ridiculous things of her. I am not the same parent to my 3yo and 1yo that I <br/>
was to my 10yo, with attachment parenting and unschooling. I feel so guilty, <br/>
that I wasn&#39;t a good enough mother to her. How do we heal? <br/>

You had the BEST of intentions and that counts in childraising because <br/>
kids KNOW when they are loved and that is the most important thing to <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Heal by having a good life now. Even if she does go to middle school - <br/>
enjoy your time together when you have it. Enjoy the moment when you <br/>
pick her up from school - enjoy the car ride - enjoy the shopping for <br/>
clothes - enjoy  whatever moments you have to connect. Be supportive of <br/>
what is important to her - even if it is not what you&#39;d want. Enjoy <br/>
your time together. Look her in the eyes and tell her how much you love <br/>
her. Do that even if she&#39;s not being all that loving. Do it even if <br/>
she&#39;s disinterested. Do it even if she lies. If she&#39;s old enough to go <br/>
to middle school, she might be old enough to read the Teenage <br/>
Liberation Handbook and catch the unschooling spririt from that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You did the best you could with what info you had at the time!!  I was <br/>
public school and so were my kids, the oldest through sixth grade until we <br/>
&quot;discovered&quot; homeschooling by medical necessity.  It&#39;s my youngest, a <br/>
daughter, who was taken out at the end of 2nd grade, and who is now also <br/>
10, almost 11, who has had the hardest time adjusting.  She misses the <br/>
company of all the kids, not the work frankly.  We&#39;ve been out of the <br/>
system for over three years now, but I heard the protests for months on <br/>
end.  At first I had to remind her of all she would miss, like the field <br/>
trips, as well as all she would end up with that she would hate like the <br/>
homework, spelling, the math, etc.  And I also knew that I just wasn&#39;t <br/>
going to give in.  I also came to realize that she needed to have a little <br/>
more structure than my oldest kid.  So I began looking around for classes <br/>
in things she enjoys like art etc, that would give her a feeling of <br/>
accomplishment and organization and structure and yet wouldn&#39;t overwhelm <br/>
her (or me!) as far as structure was concerned.  This was/is very much an <br/>
ongoing process of exploration of comfort and discovery of why she <br/>
wasn&#39;t/isn&#39;t happy with what we were doing at home or what she felt <br/>
&quot;school&quot; could offer her.  Get her out of the house and look into your city <br/>
park and rec classes as well as local homeschool coop groups.<br/>
<br/>
The healing will take years....the guilt is something else...how were you <br/>
to know?  I didn&#39;t?  And I consider myself an educated, intelligent <br/>
woman.  Give it a rest and yourself a break.  Talk to your kid and be up <br/>
front.  You don&#39;t have to carry the whole burden...it&#39;s her life too.  Let <br/>
her share some of your concerns and ask her what she really want&#39;s from <br/>
&quot;school,&quot; and explain why you don&#39;t want her there.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>
above her ability to understand.<br/>

Hi, Ang --<br/>
<br/>
My husband taught in a Middle School last year, and had 6th grade, 7th<br/>
grade and 8th grade students.  I got to compare his efforts to cram<br/>
learning into them with our unschooling at home.  Many of the school<br/>
kids hated school and had a big chip on their shoulders marked &quot;you<br/>
can&#39;t make me learn.&quot;  (I don&#39;t blame them a bit!)<br/>
<br/>
I feel so sad that your daughter feels lazy and stupid.  <br/>
<br/>
I only have an 8 year old, so I&#39;m not really good at guessing how<br/>
philosophical a 10 year old can be.  Can you have useful discussions<br/>
with her about how learning works, or is the topic too complex, or too painful?<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned yesterday, I really, really like the beginning of Grace<br/>
Llewellyn&#39;s Teenage Liberation Handbook.  (And I think it&#39;s suitable for<br/>
reading aloud to children.)  Maybe you could request it from the library<br/>
or find a copy to borrow from someone in your homeschooling group if<br/>
money is an issue. (It is for me.)<br/>
<br/>
I also think the part of Frank Smith&#39;s book, The Book of Learning and<br/>
Forgetting, that explains the &quot;forgetting curve&quot; is cool and insightful.<br/>
 This whole book used to be available online, but I don&#39;t currently have<br/>
a link.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to ask, does Megan&#39;s father believe in unschooling?  Does he<br/>
believe in her innate intelligence?  That&#39;s awfully important.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  Meeting other relaxed homeschoolers can be really validating for a<br/>
child, especially one who is social or group-oriented in the way she<br/>
makes decisions.  A kid who wants to be like other people.  (Some don&#39;t care.)</div>
