Homeschooling<br/>

&gt; &gt;You can send them to ps, get paid less for the effort OR you can choose<br/>
&gt; &gt;private school. 6 months to a year of Waldorf or Sudbury isn&#39;t going to<br/>
&gt; &gt;hurt your child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Those kinds of schools aren&#39;t always available anywhere nearby.  There&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; Waldorf school over an hour from here, nowhere near public transit.<br/>
That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; about it for the whole Victoria area.  I&#39;m guessing it won&#39;t be any better<br/>
&gt; on the Olympic Peninsula.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also have the experience of starting to homeschool after a divorce.  I<br/>
&gt; tried to talk with my ex about taking my older boy out.  He didn&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; want to discuss it.  I finally decided that Noah&#39;s sanity was the most<br/>
&gt; important thing and took him out.  The ex put up with it for a year and a<br/>
&gt; half and then announced that we were going to court if I didn&#39;t put him<br/>
&gt; back in school.  Being 8 months pregnant at the time, I didn&#39;t want a<br/>
court<br/>
&gt; fight.  Neither did Noah, so he went to school.  Worst thing that ever<br/>
&gt; happened to him, and his father even agrees......now.  What I&#39;m trying to<br/>
&gt; say is that waiting until the divorce is final does not guarantee that he<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t fight homeschooling.  I&#39;m inclined to say that stability for the<br/>
&gt; children would be the thing to argue for.  They&#39;re going to be going<br/>
&gt; through a lot of changes because of the divorce.  Their education should<br/>
&gt; stay the same, at least for a year or two after.<br/>

She&#39;s in Seattle--in one of the northern suburbs, I think.  Used to be<br/>

find her.<br/>

with a changed decision down the line.<br/>
<br/>
On another note:<br/>
When I lived in Sunnyvale, Ca, we had a recently divorced mom drive an <br/>
hour from the Santa Cruz mountains everyday to bring her son to a Sudury <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
I think an hour would be my limit on a choice of private school.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose its all up to one&#39;s choice in how they need to run their life.<br/>

I had wanted my son in the Waldorf school, I would have had to either spend <br/>
the day there myself or make the drive twice.  The road is a nasty one, and <br/>
often gets shut down in winter.<br/>

perhaps a bit east.  But those schools are public schools so her <br/>
children are, legally speaking, public school students.  Perhaps<br/>
there are public school programs like hers at some of the public<br/>
schools near where this family is considering relocating.<br/>
