<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505144142">I stayed out of the recent discussion about this list and Sandra and <br/>
others - on the RUL list, just read quietly, because it seemed <br/>
pointless to me, I couldn&#39;t figure out what good I could do by saying <br/>
anything at all - seemed anything I said would just add fuel to the <br/>
firestorm which was already out of control.<br/>
<br/>
But I was then left feeling I&#39;d not done right - not stood up to be <br/>
counted and thereby let stand some things that should have been <br/>
corrected - some things that I do have firsthand knowledge of and could <br/>
have corrected.<br/>
<br/>
There was commentary by a couple of people, at least one who was just <br/>
guessing based on things people had posted there on that list, that <br/>
Sandra seems more &quot;enlightened&quot; in her writing in magazines and in her <br/>
conference talks than the way they see her behaving on email lists. <br/>
They questioned whether or not Sandra would admit she is still learning.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra and her family have stayed at my house and I&#39;ve stayed at her <br/>
house and we&#39;ve been at conferences together as well as other <br/>
homeschool activities like park days and field trips. She is an <br/>
extraordinarily kind and gentle person who absolutely FULLY lives what <br/>
she writes. She is excruciatingly honest. She has talked, online, <br/>
frequently about what she, herself, is still learning. She has talked <br/>
about her own mistakes and her own regrets and weaknesses. She <br/>
questions and examines her own behavior constantly. She has never held <br/>
herself up as perfect - just as certain as one can be that &quot;unschooling <br/>
works.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Sandra has a tremendous amount of personal integrity and cares very <br/>
deeply about all children. She lays bare her own family&#39;s experiences, <br/>
both good and bad, in great detail, in her published columns in HEM as <br/>
well as online on email lists and on the unschooling-dotcom message <br/>
boards and on her website. Sandra attracts &quot;followers&quot; because some <br/>
people feel a very strong attraction to someone who gets right to the <br/>
heart of matters and says exactly what she thinks - she&#39;s not <br/>
infallible, of course, but she is very often absolutely right on target <br/>
in her perceptions and often says just the right thing to shake someone <br/>
out of whatever kind of box they might have been stuck in. She helps <br/>
many of us push out our own boundaries and we are braver and stronger <br/>
and our children are healthier and happier because of what she helped <br/>
us see and learn.<br/>
<br/>
That same insightfulness combined with directness and very very literal <br/>
writing, always saying exactly what she means, clearly is not <br/>
appreciated by all. I just wish that when they don&#39;t like it, they&#39;d <br/>
just ignore it and I especially wish that other people would <br/>
investigate for themselves and not be influenced by the backbiting and <br/>
not repeat things when they have no firsthand knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
So - that&#39;s my personal testimony - not the first time many of you have <br/>
heard it. I have nothing to gain by defending Sandra, nothing other <br/>
than my own sense of doing the right thing. We met online - she shook <br/>
me up and my life has never been the same.  I pay her back by doing my <br/>
own work - speaking, writing, and helping other parents give their <br/>
children the gifts that unschooling can bring. That&#39;s all she cares <br/>
about - she&#39;s not in competition with anybody, not out for power for <br/>
herself, just for the ideas - the principles - of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra exemplifies selfless devotion to making the world a better place <br/>
for as many children as she can. And she doesn&#39;t deserve to be raked <br/>
over the coals for it.<br/>

<br/>
It was admirable for you to stand up for someone you so much admire and I<br/>
thought it was well put and interesting. I want to point out tho that people<br/>
make up their minds about things and people and oftentimes will not budge.<br/>
Call it human nature, call it &quot;nothing can be that good&quot; syndrome but it is<br/>
very hard to change mental images once they are ingrained.<br/>
<br/>
I see it in religion all the time the people that work with me are often<br/>
zealots in some of their beliefs I think it makes us feel like we are<br/>
&quot;protected&quot; if we do not re-think our positions. I am not condoning this<br/>
behavior, merely noting that it exists.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691289773">Thank you for this Pam. I very much appreciate your courage in bringing this up. Your actions are a testimony to your integrity.<br/>
<br/>
It is good for me to hear others opinions. <br/>
