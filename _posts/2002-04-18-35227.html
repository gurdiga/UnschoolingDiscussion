years before and after 1994 are suspect (excuse the pun &lt;G&gt;). The changes had <br/>
to do with how they get the crime rates for the US as a whole. Each local <br/>
jurisdiction reports, based on the very detailed requirements of the uniform <br/>
reporting law. About 95 percent of local jurisdictions report. So - to get <br/>
the numbers for the country as a whole, they have to sort of fill in the gaps <br/>
- estimate the rates for those counties, for example, that don&#39;t report. They <br/>
do this based on information from other similar local areas. The methodology <br/>
used for this estimation was changed in 1994. <br/>
<br/>
I think acts of terrorism are collected in a separate database by the Justice <br/>
Department. <br/>
<br/>
Since the FBI crime statistics are really intended only to look at reported <br/>
crimes, there is another database which complements it by looking at crime <br/>
from the point of view of victims. I believe it is based on surveys which <br/>
attempt to get a sense of how many unreported crimes there are. This is <br/>
called something like the National Victims of Crime Survey?? (Sorry - it has <br/>
been a while since I studied these things.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you saying that you would prefer that we just trade opinions?<br/>
<br/>
In discussions about unquantifiable things: which flowers are prettiest, who<br/>
makes the best pizza, I think opinions work well.<br/>
<br/>
In discussions about quantifiable things like breastfeeding, learning, crime<br/>
to mention a few, I think opinions need to be examined and questioned and<br/>
supported and refuted or they are no more than just words.<br/>
<br/>
If we were discussing learning and a teacher came on and said children<br/>
needed to be taught to read, should her opinion be accepted just because she<br/>
held it?<br/>
<br/>
Many of us at one time held the opinion that school was the best place to<br/>
get an education. No matter how strongly we held that opinion, no matter how<br/>
strongly lots of people continue to hold it, what is that opinion worth in a<br/>
discussion of how children learn best? Unless it can be supported with logic<br/>
it isn&#39;t worth the electrons it&#39;s written with.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t enjoy debates. They can skip them. (If we remember to<br/>
change subject headers.)<br/>
<br/>
Some people do enjoy debates. So the debates need to be here for them.<br/>
<br/>
Some people enjoy &quot;this is what worked for my family&quot;, days in the life,<br/>
suggestions and so forth. Those need to be here for them. And those who<br/>
don&#39;t like them, should skip them so others can enjoy them. If we try to<br/>
limit the list to just the types of things we need, then we limit it&#39;s<br/>
usefulness for other people.<br/>
<br/>
I think *especially* on a list covering a topic that is cutting edge debate<br/>
is essential. It&#39;s one thing to believe unschooling can work. It&#39;s another<br/>
thing entirely to be able to support your claim against opposition. If<br/>
someone doesn&#39;t care about supporting their beliefs and just wants to hold<br/>
them, so be it. They can drop out and stick to the other discussions. But<br/>
for some people it&#39;s essential, personally or legislatively or<br/>
philosophically, to be able to defend their beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Debate is useful even when it isn&#39;t specifically about unschooling because<br/>
then it becomes about how to think critically, which is also unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-869144995">Okay I stand corrected and apologize.  I was just getting the impression<br/>
that you were criticizing and finding fault with every post I was posting,<br/>
regardless of the subject.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for becoming defensive.  Sorry also for not realizing you were the<br/>
list moderator and giving you the proper respect.<br/>
<br/>
I will keep quiet if I can not give better facts.<br/>

&gt; &gt; AHH!  Here we go with *opinions* again.   I am not having a contest<br/>
here.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have not asked you to supply your proof to back up your theories or<br/>
&gt; &gt; opinions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are you saying that you would prefer that we just trade opinions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In discussions about unquantifiable things: which flowers are prettiest,<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; makes the best pizza, I think opinions work well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In discussions about quantifiable things like breastfeeding, learning,<br/>
crime<br/>
&gt; to mention a few, I think opinions need to be examined and questioned and<br/>
&gt; supported and refuted or they are no more than just words.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If we were discussing learning and a teacher came on and said children<br/>
&gt; needed to be taught to read, should her opinion be accepted just because<br/>
she<br/>
&gt; held it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many of us at one time held the opinion that school was the best place to<br/>
&gt; get an education. No matter how strongly we held that opinion, no matter<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; strongly lots of people continue to hold it, what is that opinion worth in<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; discussion of how children learn best? Unless it can be supported with<br/>
logic<br/>
&gt; it isn&#39;t worth the electrons it&#39;s written with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some people don&#39;t enjoy debates. They can skip them. (If we remember to<br/>
&gt; change subject headers.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some people do enjoy debates. So the debates need to be here for them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some people enjoy &quot;this is what worked for my family&quot;, days in the life,<br/>
&gt; suggestions and so forth. Those need to be here for them. And those who<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like them, should skip them so others can enjoy them. If we try to<br/>
&gt; limit the list to just the types of things we need, then we limit it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; usefulness for other people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think *especially* on a list covering a topic that is cutting edge<br/>
debate<br/>
&gt; is essential. It&#39;s one thing to believe unschooling can work. It&#39;s another<br/>
&gt; thing entirely to be able to support your claim against opposition. If<br/>
&gt; someone doesn&#39;t care about supporting their beliefs and just wants to hold<br/>
&gt; them, so be it. They can drop out and stick to the other discussions. But<br/>
&gt; for some people it&#39;s essential, personally or legislatively or<br/>
&gt; philosophically, to be able to defend their beliefs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Debate is useful even when it isn&#39;t specifically about unschooling because<br/>
&gt; then it becomes about how to think critically, which is also unschooling.<br/>
