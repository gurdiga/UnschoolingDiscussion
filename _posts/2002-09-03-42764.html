<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374813606">I have been unschooling for just about two years now - homeschooling overall for three.  I started off with unit studies and when I heard myself sounding like the horrible teacher at the PS we pulled the kids out of --- I knew I had to change!!  I am a highly organized - structured - if the directions say so...type of person.  I am thrilled with my ongoing transformation into the unschooling way of life!  I organize the pantry - alphabetize my CD&#39;S etc. when I feel those moments of &quot;structure panic&quot; coming on (it&#39;s getting easier every day!).  I am the co-editor and person to contact for &quot;new to HS packets&quot; (catalogs of curriculums, etc.) for our local HS newsletter.  I am finding it increasingly difficult to answer questions of those wanting to begin the HS experience without scaring the crap out of them with my talk of unschooling.   :0) <br/>
<br/>
 I guess my question here is how to continue helping those just getting their feet wet with homeschooling - - letting them know that I unschool, but being available to answer other questions too without sounding phony - because that is truly how I feel when I talk about using the pre- packaged, workbooks, unit studies, etc. Unschooling makes perfect sense and I get frustrated when people just don&#39;t seem to get it.   I remember just starting out though and if all I heard about (at the time) was unschooling...I may have been too afraid to even try homeschooling.  For me it was a voyage of self discovery and time spent with the kids showing me the way.  I struggle with scaring people off before they have the chance to experience what I get to everyday.  Any advice?<br/>

<br/>
Just as we try and put ourselves in our childrens place when they run into<br/>
adversity, maybe you can remember those days long ago when you just started.<br/>
Remember how excited or maybe scared you were to start on this strange new<br/>
journey. Remember that everyone isn&#39;t going to unschool or even homeschool<br/>
the way you started out. Just starting to homeschool is hopefully a step in<br/>
the right direction. Take it slow and try not to overwhelm. I say that<br/>
because I do it. I happen to be very passionate about how I parent. I have a<br/>
tendency to make peoples eyes glaze over too when it comes up. All I need is<br/>
a little hint of someone needing help or changing or asking a question and<br/>
I&#39;m off. I&#39;ve actually had my husband nudge me to cool it when I go off on a<br/>
rant. I just need to understand that if it&#39;s someone in person that really<br/>
wants information, I can be of more help to them by taking it slower and<br/>
understanding that they aren&#39;t in my place. At least just yet!!!!<br/>
Of course if it&#39;s a fly by night kind of meeting, then all bets are off. I<br/>
go for it!<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; I am the co-editor and person to contact for &quot;new to HS packets&quot; (catalogs <br/>
of curriculums, etc.) for our local HS newsletter.  I am finding it <br/>
increasingly difficult to answer questions of those wanting to begin the HS <br/>
experience without scaring the crap out of them with my talk of unschooling.  <br/>
 :0)  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For years I was one of the only local contact people here, and I would refer <br/>
people to other places if they wanted to use structure.  There&#39;s a bookstore <br/>
here that sells used homeschooling materials, and that was a great place to <br/>
send people. <br/>
<br/>
For years I had an unschooling group, at first with another family, and <br/>
eventually they wandered away and it was just us and from five to fifteen <br/>
other families, depending on the season and year.  Not all the families were <br/>
unschoolers, but since it was clearly called an unschooling group, they kept <br/>
the curriculum talk down, and kids played, and parents socialized and played, <br/>
and we had fun.<br/>
<br/>
My boys got to old to want to be in a group, and were tired of it.  Holly was <br/>
still fairly young, 8 or 9, when another group started in town with lots of <br/>
kids.  I used to take her, and then I started letting her arrange to go with <br/>
other families if she wanted to, but I have a hard time going.  I only go <br/>
once in a great while.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s why:<br/>
<br/>
People want to talk to me.  They want to take me aside and sit down and say <br/>
my kids are SO wonderful and they want their kids to be like mine, but their <br/>
kids just won&#39;t do their math, or as soon as their kids can read well enough <br/>
to learn on their own, they might think about considering unschooling too.<br/>
<br/>
My choices at that point are to smile and nod and think about England until <br/>
they&#39;re through talking or to talk about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If I do the former, I&#39;m being dishonest.  I think there&#39;s nothing to smile <br/>
and nod about if people want me to coo and agree that gosh darn, it IS hard <br/>
to make kids do math.  Because I&#39;ve never made kids do math, and I don&#39;t want <br/>
to start.  I think they&#39;re wasting their own time and their children&#39;s joy by <br/>
doing it.  They&#39;ve gone to an inclusive group meeting and not an unschooling <br/>
meeting.<br/>
<br/>
If I do the latter, I&#39;m spending twenty minutes of time I could have been <br/>
hanging around with Holly or talking to people I&#39;ve known for years about <br/>
other teenged homeschoolers I&#39;ve known since they first left school.  THAT <br/>
would be okay, but I invariably am asked to talk to someone individually.<br/>
<br/>
If my choice is being dishonest or honest, I&#39;m going to be honest.  <br/>
If my choice is to be at peace or stressed, I&#39;m going with peace, so I&#39;d <br/>
rather stay home.<br/>
But if my choice is being useful or pissing my time away, I&#39;d rather be <br/>
useful.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s better for me to write where I can leave things for people to come <br/>
back to.  It&#39;s better for me to only be involved with clearly-delineated <br/>
unschooling sites and activities, and put no effort into helping people learn <br/>
about what curriculum to buy, or how to inspire kids to like workbooks, or <br/>
how to design unit studies.  I cannot in good conscience help someone do <br/>
something I don&#39;t think is good for their kids or for their relationship with <br/>
their kids.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel guilty about not going to the playgroup (which is not just a <br/>
playgroup, though they call it that), because I&#39;ve totally done my time for <br/>
years and years, locally.  I maintain the local mailing list and I still get <br/>
phone calls and e-mail every week or two for having been listed as local <br/>
contact years ago and in paper publications people still come across.<br/>
<br/>
As much as people would like for me to reassure them about something I don&#39;t <br/>
believe in, I think if I did that my advice would be compromised and my <br/>
integrity be impaired.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are willing to say things they don&#39;t believe. I&#39;m not.<br/>

&lt;&lt; For myself, I&#39;ve always been fascinated by all the different <br/>
curriculums out there - so I know a lot about them (especially math) <br/>
and so it is natural that people ask me about them. That is my own <br/>
personal difficulty - that people want me to help them evaluate math <br/>
curriculum. It isn&#39;t like they are all created equal - there are some <br/>
that are MUCH more harmful than others, imo. So - I try to be <br/>
goodnatured about it - I can&#39;t make myself withhold information, so I <br/>
do give my opinions, but I constantly (albeit gently) remind them that <br/>
they don&#39;t NEED it at all.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I used to do that too.  At first I looked at the various things so I&#39;d know <br/>
what people were talking about, and after talking to some local person I <br/>
could recommend which they should definitely avoid, at least, and could <br/>
converse with them about the differences and what was good for Catholics or <br/>
Protestants and what was good for none-of-the-above, and what Clonlara might <br/>
be good for in their lives, or Oak Meadow.<br/>
<br/>
But too many times people said later &quot;I wish I had never spent any money on a <br/>
curriculum.&quot;  So I started at that point after a while, and said, &quot;First, <br/>
don&#39;t spend ANY money on formal materials.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And once that was my first advice, I quit caring what was what.  I was <br/>
recommending the avoidance of all of it.<br/>

This seems to be THE biggest reason people have trouble switching to unschooling.  For most relaxed homeschoolers/eclectics who like the idea of unschooling, imposed school structure doesn&#39;t seem like a bad thing, if its only done in very small amounts and combined with large amounts of freedom outside of those very small amounts.<br/>
<br/>
Is there any research that shows that imposed structure, even in SMALL amounts is also not good for kids?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read Holt, but I got the impression from his books that he was talking about &quot;all day&quot; kinds of structure.  I&#39;ve also read the Teen Lib Handbook, but even in there, it sounds like she is referring to kids who have *already* learned basic skills like basic arithmetic, etc. that should &quot;quit school and get a real education&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Any other reading suggestions?<br/>

  I&#39;m glad you said that.  It helps me put Holt into perspective with &quot;unschooling&quot;.  so many think of Holt as the founder of unschooling.  But I from what you are saying, and its probably true:  Unschooling is bigger than Holt.<br/>

England because they don&#39;t seem to get it and I don&#39;t know how to<br/>
respond. How do you respond at that point Sandra? It does feel dishonest<br/>
to not to take the conversation to the next step.  Recently, I used a<br/>
phrase which seemed to serve me well. I prefaced my statement with<br/>
...&quot;but unschoolers would say that is because...&quot;, which made me feel<br/>
like I wasn&#39;t being so critical of them.<br/>
 <br/>
Any other ideas are welcomed.<br/>

I know you didn&#39;t ask for advice, but there&#39;s something about other<br/>
people&#39;s issues that gets the brainstorming juices flowing.  (And<br/>
anything posted is fair game for free advice, I suppose.)<br/>
<br/>
In situations like this, where the semi-structured homeschooler is<br/>
burned out and venting to you, it might be worthwhile to say &quot;Yes,<br/>
forcing someone to do something (lessons) IS exhausting.  And it puts a<br/>
lot of hostility and stress into you relationship.&quot;<br/>

Unfortunately the conversation can&#39;t just stop there.  You are right<br/>
that the ability online to make one&#39;s point and then disengage is valuable.<br/>

his own life that does. What a horrible burden to not want college and know your <br/>
parents really want you to go!<br/>
He&#39;s smart to hate school, it has nothing to do with learning.<br/>
And if he figures out that true learning is fun, then college might not be <br/>
what he wants ever!!  I think you both need to do some major deschooling right <br/>
now. Drop the expectations for his life and let him find himself.  Unschooling <br/>
in HS years is the same as unschooling at any time in your life. You do the <br/>
things you LOVE. Follow your interests and your heart and you&#39;ll be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like a lot of damage has been done, so he  probably needs a lot of <br/>
&quot;down&quot; time to just find himself again. Be patient...it may look like he has <br/>
zero interest in anything for a while. But healing can happen!<br/>

<br/>
I have to agree with that.  I worked hard in school, as an Electrical<br/>
Engineering major and good pretty good grades, but when I graduated I<br/>
didn&#39;t know the material.  (Worse, I didn&#39;t even like the material at<br/>
that point.)<br/>
