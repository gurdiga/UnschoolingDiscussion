<div id="ygrps-yiv-460017196">. The woman<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; actually said I had too much information and kept very good records of<br/>
&gt; what my two boys and I had done for unschooling. I am  SO relieved that<br/>
&gt; the process went so well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Michele, Congratulation!  What and encouragement your experience is for me.<br/>
Would you be willing to share your record keeping habits with us?  Did you<br/>
use a portfolio - if so, what did it look like, and what did you include?<br/>
Can you also share a bit about the types of information/activities that you<br/>
recorded.  If you included samples of work, what type of work was it?<br/>
Thanks so much, Annette</div>
