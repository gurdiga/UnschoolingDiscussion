&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 295<br/>
&gt;Date: Sat, Nov 13, 1999, 3:15 AM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Someone asked her age she is 10 1/2 yo.  And I know she wants me to direct<br/>
&gt;her more because she told me directly that is what she thought I should do.<br/>
&gt; Part of my panic came in when her younger sister (who loves math) suddenly<br/>
&gt;joined her boat and quite doing any at all!  Part of my panic is the<br/>
&gt;importance I place on math itself.  And can she write off doing math?<br/>
&gt;Maybe not completely, but then again, have you ever worked with a 18 yo<br/>
&gt;that could literally not reliably count to 5 - even when counting<br/>
&gt;merchandise?  I have - I believe it is possible to be nearly completely<br/>
&gt;illiterate when it comes to math.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s highly likely that the 18 year old was schooled, and in a position<br/>
where people sat him down and tried to force him to learn math for an hour a<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
The thing to be teaching our children is *how to learn* when they are *ready<br/>
to learn*. If your daughter did absolutely NO MATH for four years (an<br/>
impossibility, by the way, I&#39;ll get to that in a minute) but she learned the<br/>
priceless lesson of how to learn something, it would not matter a whit. In<br/>
four years, she could say, as Lisa&#39;s daughter did, &quot;Ack! I do not know<br/>
fractions!&quot; and sit herself down and learn them. Same with anything.<br/>
<br/>
But, really, she can&#39;t &quot;not do math&quot; for four years (or four days). She can<br/>
&quot;not pick up a math book&quot;, but so what? She could not pick up a math book<br/>
for the rest of her natural life and still be a math genius.<br/>
<br/>
Math is not just (and not best) in books called &quot;Learn Math in 170 nearly<br/>
pain-free lessons&quot;. Math is all around us. We breath it and live it and sit<br/>
on it all day, every day.<br/>
<br/>
Every time your daughter goes to the store and buys something, she uses math<br/>
(how big a bill do I give them? How much change do I get back? Are these<br/>
peaches a better bargain, or are those? I have $20.00 and I need to buy<br/>
these five things, so can I get the big box of noodles, or only the small<br/>
one?). Every time she looks through a TV Guide she is using math (When does<br/>
that program start? Oh, look, this program is on for an hour and overlaps<br/>
the other one I want by half an hour, when do I need to start the VCR?).<br/>
Every time she helps you pay the bills, budgets the family&#39;s weekly money,<br/>
is put in charge of the map for a family trip, earns money babysitting the<br/>
kid next door, has her own savings account and calculates the interest to<br/>
make sure the bank has not made an error against her, sits down with her<br/>
father and builds a bat or bird or doghouse, she is DOING MATH.<br/>
<br/>
It is extremely valuable to an unschooling parent to learn to see what<br/>
&quot;subject&quot; is inherent in what their children are doing. MUCH more valuable<br/>
than sitting and fretting about the child &quot;not doing math&quot; (or science, or<br/>
reading, or history). The textbooks have nothing to do with it. Look at what<br/>
your daughter is *really* doing, play the fun game of translating it all<br/>
into &quot;subjects&quot; and ENJOY. It often helps to have other people look at a<br/>
list of your daughter&#39;s activities for one week (post it here, I love<br/>
breaking things into subjects.) It often helps to keep a journal for a month<br/>
on &quot;what my kids did all day&quot; and then read back and be amazed by what they<br/>
did learn.<br/>
<br/>
There is a the overwhelming myth that learning is hard, must be linear,<br/>
comes only with textbooks and teachers. One afternoon building that<br/>
birdhouse teaches your daughter more about geometry than a semester of<br/>
sitting bored in a classroom (or against her will with Mom at the kitchen<br/>
table).<br/>
<br/>
It is entirely likely that at some stage your daughter will want to do more<br/>
&quot;academically formal&quot; work. The key here is that the timetable is HERS. She<br/>
may want to do three &quot;chapters of math&quot; next week, or it might not be for<br/>
three years. It doesn&#39;t matter, in the meantime she is still learning and<br/>
living math.<br/>
<br/>
Give her real life things that involve math. Teach her to balance the family<br/>
checkbook and put her in charge of it each month when the bank statement<br/>
comes. Put her in charge of clipping coupons on things you use and let her<br/>
have half the money she saves from the grocery bill for her own use. Play<br/>
poker for penny stakes to teach about probability. Yahtzee is the best math<br/>
game ever. There are a million ways for a child to see the fun and use of<br/>
math, and one sure way (enforced drudgery over math books) to kill any sense<br/>
of that fun. If she has been schooled, or forced into curriculum, in the<br/>
past, she will have a lot of healing to do.<br/>

&gt;And I know she wants me to direct<br/>
&gt;her more because she told me directly that is what she thought I should do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is part two. :)<br/>
<br/>
She has deschooling to do. She probably truly believes that she cannot do<br/>
this. It&#39;s no surprise -- most of society, the local teacher&#39;s union, her<br/>
Aunt Mathilda and you also have varying doubts.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s dangerous to direct our children&#39;s learning, even when they ask<br/>
it. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s dangerous to take them very seriously in their fear<br/>
and sit down with them and say, &quot;Look, I&#39;m not going to direct you. That<br/>
would be emminently silly since I am not you and do not know what you want<br/>
to learn, or what you should learn, or when you should learn it. This is<br/>
your life, and your education. However, I am MORE than happy to talk to you<br/>
about what you feel you &#39;should be doing&#39; right now, and help you to get<br/>
whatever resources or materials or assistance from me you need in using<br/>
them. I will also be happy to watch you practice the fine art of Sensible<br/>
Quitting and abandon working on anything that it turns out you are not<br/>
actually interested in at a given time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot in there. There&#39;s confidence in her abilities, an offer of<br/>
assistance without becoming Grand Poobah, and most important to a formerly<br/>
schooled or schooled-at-home child there is the assurance that if she finds<br/>
out that she *doesn&#39;t* want to raise mice for profit as an avenue to<br/>
learning about the market economy that you will not hesitate to help her<br/>
sell off critters, cages, and the whole caboodle rather than lecturing her<br/>
on &quot;quitting&quot;. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-658801511">&lt;&lt;We made fraction wheels out of pizza cardboard rounds and had great fun<br/>
making them but there they lay.  So the other day I took out the math books<br/>
again and started in the chapters on fractions - trying to make this<br/>
interesting and meaningful.  I&#39;ve scaled it back to no more than 15<br/>
problems in a day but still sense her boredom, frustration and general<br/>
dislike of the topic.<br/>
<br/>
Help!  How can I ignore this???  Math is in every possible thing we do. She<br/>
can&#39;t just right it off for the rest of her life.  In ways she wants me to<br/>
tell her what to do (still thinking I should do what the school did)  and<br/>
yet, she resents it when I push even a little.  Ack!<br/>

Laraine&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, Laraine, remind me of what I say here, next month when I need it -<br/>
LOL.  <br/>
<br/>
Have you tried cooking as a way of teaching fractions?  With measuring cups<br/>
and spoons?  Saving a bunch of change for a couple of weeks, and counting<br/>
it out (5&#39;s, 10&#39;s, 2&#39;s and multiplication).<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to teach our son to count by 2&#39;s (guess what... He learned to<br/>
count by 10&#39;s from the table of contents from a book I read to him!  The<br/>
chapters were by 10&#39;s!) and as I was laying out the pennies, he was<br/>
ignoring me completely (or so I thought).  Next thing I know, somehow I&#39;d<br/>
laid out a group of pennies by 3&#39;s (didn&#39;t do it on purpose.  Remember I<br/>
was trying to show counting by 2&#39;s here).  He looked at the pennies and<br/>
declared, &quot;Mama, look!  Did you know that three 3&#39;s is 9?!&quot;  And he<br/>
remembered it from that experience!  The year before, he was looking at his<br/>
guitar and noticed the three tuning knobs on both sides, and realized that<br/>
3+3=6, and never forgot it.  If he&#39;d written it 50 times, it would have<br/>
stayed in memory, but this applied it in such a way that he never forgot.  <br/>
<br/>
Our son learned 10% from the tithe.  Also, you may be surprised at some<br/>
things she knows.  I saw on the &quot;curriculum&quot; we were shown, that we were<br/>
suppose to &quot;cover&quot; perimeter this year.  I thought this was absurd, for<br/>
such a young child.  Dh disagreed, reciting examples as: &quot;Well what if he<br/>
wants to put up a fence one day?  He&#39;ll have to know that.&quot;  Well I asked<br/>
dh when he was ever going to fix the gate, and he said that was beside the<br/>
point!  Well, I said, &quot;fine&quot;, and asked our son to pretend that the box was<br/>
a backyard and he wanted to build a fence around it.  Than I asked him how<br/>
he would know how much wood to get to build it, how many inches long.  He<br/>
said, &quot;Well, first I&#39;d need a ruler.&quot;  So I got the ruler.  than he said,<br/>
&quot;And I guess I&#39;d have to measure&quot; and he measured each side of the box! <br/>
etc!  I looked at dh and said, well, perimeter covered! LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how old your daughter is.  But what about helping out with the<br/>
registry of the checkbook, or other everyday house mathematical<br/>
responsibilities, etc. <br/>
<br/>
There are also some okay computer programs (i.e., math blaster, jump<br/>
start).  they have some fall backs, but she may enjoy it.  I view them as<br/>
just another game.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a book I have not seen yet, so I don&#39;t know how good it is (or<br/>
what level it is, but I know it covers fractions to some extent), but the<br/>
book is called &quot;Math Art&quot;.  Our son really likes art, so I&#39;m checking out<br/>
the book.  Our library system has a copy of it, and it comes from<br/>
Scholastic.<br/>
<br/>
Well, none of this may be useful to you, LOL.  But I hope something is :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096758152">I know it is not very unschooling-like to ask about this but...<br/>
My 7 yo has gotten to a point where he has expressed a need for some <br/>
help learning basic math (for scorekeeping in games and managing <br/>
money, etc.). He has little confidence in this area. I am not sure <br/>
how to proceed to help him without turning him off to math concepts, <br/>
as has happened in the past. He doesn&#39;t like doing math on paper and <br/>
has a hard time calculating in his head because he says he can&#39;t <br/>
remember math facts. I thought he might like some program (Math-U-<br/>
See?) that uses blocks because he is very hands-on and enjoys <br/>
building with Legos. So, what do you do if a child asks for help in a <br/>
specific subject? I don&#39;t think it is anti-unschooling to provide <br/>
help through a special program as long as it has been requested. Any <br/>
suggestions for math?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-61098466">I don&#39;t know about you, but I encourage my children to learn math and <br/>
reading by providing games that teach these concepts. Then I make <br/>
sure they don&#39;t just sit on the shelf. I will say, &quot;Hey, you wanna <br/>
play bing, boggle, dominos, etc.&quot; Usually, they are excited to play. <br/>
Sometimes they want to do something different. I always let them <br/>
decide if they want to play or not and never force them too. I don&#39;t <br/>
think unschooling is always completely letting your child go on their <br/>
own, so much as it is the manner in which you approach their <br/>
learning. Always, always help and offer help to a child who is asking <br/>
for it, or seems to be struggling with something they are trying to <br/>
do. As for suggestions on learing basic math we play dominos. There <br/>
are many different ways to play. We match the dominos, we play by <br/>
number so that the dots that are placed together have to equal a <br/>
certain number either by adding or subtracting, which ever the case <br/>
may be. There are also board games you can get at the store that <br/>
require math. The only other one that comes to mind is Hi Ho Cherry <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155177888">Olivia,<br/>
<br/>
Our favorite math program for younger kids is Miquon math. I should warn you<br/>
that I am an independent bookseller and Miquon is one of the products we<br/>
carry so I may seem biased, but the reason we carry the Miquon is because we<br/>
like it. We could make more money selling Saxon or Math-U-See, but when it<br/>
comes to pre-highschool math, we just don&#39;t like them as much and they are<br/>
more expensive so we don&#39;t carry them.<br/>
<br/>
Here is something I previously wrote up in response to questions about why I<br/>
like Miquon:<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people are surprised that in the very first Miquon book you get<br/>
into things like multiplication and division of fractions. Traditional math<br/>
programs don&#39;t get into this type of stuff until much later, but using the<br/>
rods makes it seem like common sense.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Labsheet Annotations&quot; is important to have. Using the Labsheet<br/>
Annotations not only gives you explanations of answers and other activities,<br/>
but it also has a chart that explains the code letters and numbers on the<br/>
work book pages. These codes enable you to use the system in very different<br/>
ways. You can take a standard approach and just go page by page through the<br/>
books. If your child suddenly develops a fascination with fractions, you may<br/>
decide that you want to pursue that. The codes will tell you how to skip<br/>
through the books so you can find just the sections on fractions, going from<br/>
the introductory concepts to more advanced concepts. This means you can<br/>
either go through the books page by page to focus on the level of the<br/>
materials, or you can decide to focus on concepts (adding, length, area,<br/>
volume, factoring, squaring etc)<br/>
<br/>
There are several things I like about the program. One of the first things<br/>
is the idea of using colors for the different levels instead of ranking them<br/>
by grade or age. This frustrates some people because they want to know what<br/>
grade level their child is at, but I think ability is more important than<br/>
age and kids should work at their own level and not have to endure negative<br/>
pressure because the book says its for kids younger than them. If grandma<br/>
asks what level math youre doing and the response is I finished orange and<br/>
am just starting red, theres no judgmental information there. Colors are<br/>
neutral unlike grade levels or numbers. (By the way, I think there can be<br/>
just as much negative pressure if everyone is complimenting the child for<br/>
being ahead of their grade level).<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I like is the variety of approaches used. There is good use of<br/>
manipulatives and the presentation of problems in a variety of ways. There<br/>
are also different strategies given for solving problems. For example, one<br/>
section on the  addition of a string of numbers shows 8+1+2+9+3=  ? The<br/>
solution is not to just get the totals, but to do it by drawing lines to<br/>
connect the numbers that add to 10 and then adding them (8+2, 1+9, 3+7).<br/>
<br/>
Kids too often memorize multiplication tables and learn how to get correct<br/>
answers but dont really understand what they are doing. Math is usually<br/>
taught as if there is only one right answer and only one right way to get<br/>
it. But that is not true. At a recent support group meeting, most people<br/>
said that 3x9=27, and they just knew it from memorizing the multiplication<br/>
tables. I was one of two people that said they rounded the 9 up to 10 and<br/>
thought of the problem as (3 x 10)- (3x(10-9) or 30-3. This may seem more<br/>
convoluted, but it actually can help build important estimation skills and<br/>
make it easier to do quick calculations in your head. If your mind works<br/>
that way, you should be encouraged to approach math that way instead of by<br/>
rote memorization of multiplication tables.<br/>
<br/>
I also like that the program is fairly inexpensive. If you find it doesnt<br/>
work for your child, you dont feel the urge to force them to use it to get<br/>
your moneys worth. If it works very well and your child wants to move more<br/>
rapidly, you dont have to feel like holding them back because the next book<br/>
is so expensive. Although the program is designed for grades 1 through 3,<br/>
many people use it for 1 through 6 as you are basically at a pre-algebra<br/>
level when you complete the program.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is that I think most programs teach you to do math, while this<br/>
one puts more emphasis on understanding it on several levels. You see<br/>
different strategies for solving problems, you do hands on activities that<br/>
are fun, and you apply what you learn to different situations. Rote<br/>
memorization may be good for tests where there is a time limit and you have<br/>
to answer quickly, but understanding concepts will help you solve more<br/>
problems in the long run (especially later in life after you forget all<br/>
those equations that you so diligently memorized for a test).<br/>
<br/>
If you made it this far and are interested in more information or a place<br/>
where you can get the entire set of Miquon books for under $50, go to the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503863511">Hi,<br/>
  I&#39;m wondering how many of you actually unschool for math?  Is there <br/>
ever a point in one&#39;s life where one *must* learn her addition facts, <br/>
or her multiplication tables?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a true unschooler--I&#39;m more of a relaxed homeschooler.  <br/>
However, I totally unschooled my daughter for math last year, because <br/>
she had become so frustrated with math and was going nowhere.  I just <br/>
decided to give her a year off.  In that year she did make some <br/>
improvement on her own.  She learned how to do double digit addition <br/>
with carrying and double digit subtraction with borrowing because she <br/>
wanted to buy stuff from her American Girl catalog and adjusted how <br/>
much money she had, how much she still needed.  Even though she can <br/>
do the double digit addition, she sometims forgets what 6 + 5 is. She <br/>
is now 8 and we started back with a math curriculum and she&#39;s  <br/>
struggling again.   She is having trouble with place value--if you <br/>
give her  a number of 39, she can&#39;t put 3 10 blocks in the 10 place <br/>
and 9 one blocks in the ones place.  If I go back to unschooling her, <br/>
will she ever get this?  <br/>
<br/>
Any and all thoughts are much appreciated.  <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is there <br/>
ever a point in one&#39;s life where one *must* learn her addition facts, <br/>
or her multiplication tables?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
is there ever a life in which someone who is actually using math daily when <br/>
they could avoid learning those things?<br/>
<br/>
(And as to &quot;learning multiplication tables&quot; most people haven&#39;t really <br/>
thought a lot about what that means, and many of those of us who &quot;learned&quot; <br/>
them have tricks for remembering which we figured out on our own, or just <br/>
plain don&#39;t remember 7x8 or whatever was hard.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She <br/>
is now 8 and we started back with a math curriculum and she&#39;s  <br/>
struggling again.   She is having trouble with place value--if you <br/>
give her  a number of 39, she can&#39;t put 3 10 blocks in the 10 place <br/>
and 9 one blocks in the ones place.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s young.<br/>
<br/>
And it is not a life skill to put three ten blocks anywhere.  Using <br/>
school-designed math manipulatives can be fun IF the child thinks it&#39;s fun, <br/>
if they&#39;re treated as a toy, as a game, but the &quot;need&quot; to use them as the <br/>
&quot;math experts&quot; intended them to be used is an artificial need.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I go back to unschooling her, <br/>
will she ever get this?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Giving someone a year off&quot; from a curriuculum you went back to wasn&#39;t the <br/>
same as unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
If you want her to learn math, she needs toys, money, games that need <br/>
scorekeeping, hobbies that need measuring.  Music and dance involve math (and <br/>
it doesn&#39;t have to look like numbers and equations to be math).  Lots of <br/>
kinds of puzzles and logic problems involve math.  And they don&#39;t need to be <br/>
chosen for just that purpose, although if it makes you the mom feel better to <br/>
play Yahtzee and rummy with her DO IT!  And probably the effect on you will <br/>
be as great as the effect on her.  When you see her learning naturally (if <br/>
you leave it alone and let it happen, because natural learning cannot happen <br/>
in the lap of All Teaching All The Time) you&#39;ll learn more about how natural <br/>
learning works. <br/>
<br/>
If during your daughter&#39;s year off you just left her alone about math, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t say that was necessarily &quot;unschooled.&quot;  For one thing, if anything <br/>
is &quot;taught&quot; then the whole world isn&#39;t left as a fully-open learning <br/>
opportunity.  So I personally believe that if you taught reading but <br/>
&quot;unschooled&quot; math you didn&#39;t really unschool.  Others aren&#39;t as radical about <br/>
that.  <br/>
<br/>
Halfway between totally leaving someone alone and teaching them is the &quot;just <br/>
right&quot; balance that is unschooling.  If you want someone to have the <br/>
opportunity to learn to cook without teaching them to cook, they&#39;re going to <br/>
need to have ingredients, tools, cook books, freedom to screw up, and a mom <br/>
willing to cook where they see her cook, and a mom to clean up a lot, and a <br/>
mom willing to answer their questions and point out cooking shows on TV, and <br/>
interesting specialty pans at the thrift store, and new recipes at <br/>
restaurants, and...   <br/>
<br/>
A child without a kitchen can&#39;t possibly discover cooking.<br/>
A child not allowed to &quot;waste sugar&quot; or turn on the oven can&#39;t discover <br/>
baking.<br/>
<br/>
There are some similarities with math and everything else.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;m wondering how many of you actually unschool for math?  Is there<br/>
&gt; ever a point in one&#39;s life where one *must* learn her addition facts,<br/>
&gt; or her multiplication tables?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on the life.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think humans ever fail to learn addition facts (your daughter is<br/>
probably well aware that if you have a pile of this and put more in, it is<br/>
now more, and can probably or will probably be able to count them to find<br/>
out how many, i.e, add them) -- whether they need in their particular lives<br/>
to memorize this-plus-that-equals-such is a matter for them to decide.<br/>
<br/>
Multiplication tables are not like knowing to come in out of a lightning<br/>
storm -- they aren&#39;t &quot;necessary&quot; for every human to memorize. Many people<br/>
find them helpful, and an unschooled child may memorize them because she<br/>
does. Some people don&#39;t find them helpful at all, and lead fine upstanding<br/>
productive lives not knowing them.<br/>
<br/>
So, no, there is no &quot;must&quot;. She will learn what she needs and wants to know<br/>
when and if she needs or wants to know it. If there is a &quot;must&quot; it&#39;s a must<br/>
for her and she&#39;ll be the first to be clamoring for help if she needs it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s unschooling. Nobody &quot;unschools math&quot; -- they just unschool or they<br/>
don&#39;t, and those things that could be placed under the category of &quot;math&quot;<br/>
are of no more or less importance than those things that could be placed<br/>
under the category of &quot;purple&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We unschool purple, too. ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-639482938">Hi Sheila, <br/>
She really will &quot;get&quot; it.  Schools really push &quot;mastering &quot; certain<br/>
skills and sometimes it&#39;s hard to get past that.  Maybe it would help to<br/>
ask yourself  how important is it in her  real life to know what 6+5 is? <br/>
 How often does it come up in the natural course of a day ?  Does she<br/>
really have a NEED, right now, in her life to know this?  <br/>
<br/>
You believing she should know it already is not the same as a need to<br/>
know.  When it&#39;s important to her, she will learn it. <br/>
 <br/>
My son used to watch us play cribbage and wanted to join.  He would play<br/>
with his dad, dad at first adding up for him then gradually he was adding<br/>
on his own.  He can tally his score in yahtzee now faster than any of us!<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>

&gt; ever a point in one&#39;s life where one *must* learn her addition facts,<br/>
&gt; or her multiplication tables?<br/>
<br/>
In a word? No, there isn&#39;t any single point in time where quoting &#39;addition<br/>
facts&#39; becomes a life and death issue.<br/>
<br/>
In another word? Yes, there comes a point where understanding the definition<br/>
of &quot;addition&quot;/&quot;adding.<br/>
<br/>
Which facts are you speaking of?  The fact that 344908452934032 +1 =<br/>
344908452934033??<br/>
<br/>
Or the fact the fact that *addition is the concept of combing two or more<br/>
units to find a sum?  And that understanding this *addition fact* (ie the<br/>
definition) comes at the time that each individual is ready to comphrend the<br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
Most children come to understand the concept of one cookie plus one cookie<br/>
equals two cookies rather early.  Way before they are even capable of<br/>
explaining with other words that they understand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Repeating math additions facts by rote at an early age is a parlor trick.<br/>
Learning them over time because you use them happens to 99.57% of us by<br/>
default.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not a true unschooler--I&#39;m more of a relaxed homeschooler.<br/>
&gt; However, I totally unschooled my daughter for math last year, because<br/>
&gt; she had become so frustrated with math and was going nowhere.  I just<br/>
&gt; decided to give her a year off.<br/>
<br/>
Giving her a year off of school math was a wonderful thing to do. It,<br/>
however, is not unschooling.  There was an expecation of returning to school<br/>
math that sort of gets in the way.<br/>
<br/>
 In that year she did make some<br/>
&gt; improvement on her own.  She learned how to do double digit addition<br/>
&gt; with carrying and double digit subtraction with borrowing because she<br/>
&gt; wanted to buy stuff from her American Girl catalog and adjusted how<br/>
&gt; much money she had, how much she still needed.  Even though she can<br/>
&gt; do the double digit addition, she sometims forgets what 6 + 5 is. She<br/>
&gt; is now 8 and we started back with a math curriculum and she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; struggling again.<br/>
<br/>
This speaks volumes to me, but I&#39;d be interested in knowing your thougths on<br/>
why she&#39;s reacting to textbook math by struggling?<br/>
<br/>
She is having trouble with place value--if you<br/>
&gt; give her  a number of 39, she can&#39;t put 3 10 blocks in the 10 place<br/>
&gt; and 9 one blocks in the ones place.  If I go back to unschooling her,<br/>
&gt; will she ever get this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Inherent in this question is an absolute boatload of foundational issues<br/>
that I&#39;m not sure we can ferret out together.  Can you see her being 40 and<br/>
still unable to understand place value?  It matters not whether you unschool<br/>
her or continue to make her struggle with a math text, one day this concept<br/>
of place value will be an aha moment.   She&#39;s gonna get this one way or the<br/>
other, simply because the world she lives in runs on money and taxes and<br/>
mortage payments.<br/>
<br/>
The question is, rather, is the struggling necessary?  Is knowing place<br/>
value to the hundred thousands something an 8 year old should know or should<br/>
be made to struggle to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I, of course, as a long term unschooler will say no. It&#39;s not necessary to<br/>
waste a part of her life struggling to get this concept at 8 years old.<br/>
Life will bring too many of it&#39;s opportunities for this to be learned.  I do<br/>
not find value in forcing my children to learn any one fact just because<br/>
someone put it in a book and called it an age appropriate activity.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if this same 8 year old was begging for her own bank account or wanting<br/>
to run her own business or any other aspect of living where she NEEDED to<br/>
understand this, then yes, it might be worth sitting with her while she<br/>
struggles to grasp the concept.  But then if it&#39;s needed, she&#39;ll be driving<br/>
the train and will be willing to struggle.  Yes? </span></blockquote></div>

Sorry I chopped up your e-mail so much, I didn&#39;t want to have tons <br/>
underneath this.  I am very interested in this whole unschooling <br/>
process and understanding more about it.  The other day I was <br/>
measuring the garden and Zak wanted to help.  We wrote on the wall in <br/>
columns the numbers of feet we needeed to add together (tape measure <br/>
wasn&#39;t long enough).. He was very fascinated by the columns with <br/>
carrying the &quot;1&quot; idea.  When Son #2 took his nap later I asked Zak if <br/>
he&#39;d like to solve some more of those puzzles.  He was very happy and <br/>
said &quot;yes please&quot;.  So I wrote down about 20 sums on a paper and sat <br/>
with him and helped him understand how to carry the one, so to <br/>
speak.  After about half an hour he&#39;d had anough of that.  Is this <br/>
considered unschooling?  If he&#39;d said no he didn&#39;t want to do it I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have pushed it.  I also have some of those books I keep <br/>
picking up in Target for reading, phonics, spelling and math at <br/>
different grade levels.  I offer them to him and he thinks of them as <br/>
puzzle books.  If he wants to use them he does but if he says no I <br/>
don&#39;t say anything.  Am I going in the &quot;right&quot; direction here to be <br/>
considered an unschooler?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re right on track.  I believe now that one of the mistakes I <br/>
made as an unschooler was not offering activities enough.  I hoped that <br/>
just leaving interesting stuff lying around would be enough.  For him, it <br/>
wasn&#39;t.   If the activities are merely offered, he knows he can say no, and <br/>
you stop when his body language says &quot;enough&quot;, I&#39;d say you&#39;re unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I do think you can go too far with the offering, so the child begins to <br/>
realize how important something is to you.  Many children would go along <br/>
with you at that point, even if they weren&#39;t interested.  We do have to be <br/>
sensitive to their body language.  And it can be hard to tell.  A woman on <br/>
another list could tell that her daughter didn&#39;t really want to take piano <br/>
lessons anymore, but every time she asked her she wanted to quit, the <br/>
daughter would say no.  Years later the daughter insisted that she had kept <br/>
on with it because, &quot;she knew how much her mother wanted her to&quot;, even <br/>
though the mother truly didn&#39;t care one way or the other.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m wondering how many of you actually unschool for math?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is something I wrote to someone else a while ago that might be helpful.<br/>
Or put you to sleep depending on your patience for long windedness ;-)<br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{Do you consider doing math from a book &quot;out of context&quot;?}**<br/>
<br/>
Yes, if it&#39;s pushed on a child.  No, if the child chooses it.<br/>
<br/>
Which is too simplistic, of course, because it&#39;s based on certain<br/>
assumptions.<br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{I have a degree in computer engineering from MIT and there are<br/>
definitely prereqs. in math that I think my son would need for most math,<br/>
science, engineering, or computer majors.}**<br/>
<br/>
Okay, here comes the math spiel.  ;-)  I have a degree in Electrical<br/>
Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University.  I certainly agreed with your<br/>
assumptions about math when I first started reading about unschooling.  I,<br/>
too, was a victim of contextless, rote-learned math.  It really seemed the<br/>
only way.  There were specific ways to do addition, multiplication,<br/>
division, and on up the math scale that just had to be explained step by<br/>
step and sat down and practiced ad nauseum.  And what child was going to put<br/>
in all those necessary hours on her own?<br/>
<br/>
It took me several years of reading what other unschoolers had to say but it<br/>
really wasn&#39;t until I saw my daughter actually manipulating numbers without<br/>
being specifically shown how that I understood how unschooling could work<br/>
with math.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with school math, and as far as I&#39;ve seen all math curriculums,<br/>
is they start kids off immediately with the abstract.  A child may be able<br/>
to see they have one brother and one sister and therefore have two siblings,<br/>
or one gray cat and one yellow cat to make two cats, but put 1+1 on paper it<br/>
becomes incredibly abstract.  Why would anyone want to add 73+48?  The<br/>
process is meaningless.  The answer is meaningless.  It has no context.<br/>
<br/>
Many math programs do have kids adding sorting bears or manipulating rods or<br/>
any number of other hands-on things, but they&#39;re still basically<br/>
meaningless.  The teacher has created the problem and dumped it on the<br/>
child.  Why does anyone want to know how many blue bears there are?  Why are<br/>
the red and blue bears being added together?<br/>
<br/>
Now, on the other hand, my daughter is quite intrigued to find out how many<br/>
Jurassic dinos she has versus Triassic.  How many plant eaters versus meat<br/>
eaters.  (And whatever other classifications she can come up with, limited<br/>
only by her imagination -- versus the 2 or 3 categories of the sorting<br/>
bears.) How many years separated the various ages of the dinos.  The heights<br/>
and weights of them.<br/>
<br/>
And though counting and graphing M&M&#39;s by number and color seems the same as<br/>
doing these same things with the counting bears, it&#39;s not.  She&#39;s gaining<br/>
information in the form of patterns and relationships (that are often<br/>
expressed as numbers) about her own world, things *she* cares about.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously there&#39;s only so far counting will get you in life ;-) but we<br/>
manipulate all sorts of numbers in her life and I make sure she&#39;s immersed<br/>
in patterns and relationships between various things in her life for her to<br/>
examine (or not).  Like fractions in cooking and time: &quot;Since the cup is<br/>
dirty, how can I make 1 1/2 cups?&quot;  &quot;The recipe calls for 1 Tablespoon but<br/>
we&#39;re cutting it in half.  And a Tablespoon is 3 teaspoons.  So what would<br/>
that be?&quot;  &quot;It&#39;s an hour and a half or 3 Bill Nyes until Daddy comes home.&quot;<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s 20 minutes or a third of an hour until Xena comes on.&quot;  Though<br/>
learning to take 1/3 of 60 is more universally applicable, she can *feel*<br/>
the 20 minutes wait out of 60 minutes and she can get the feel that<br/>
fractions are ways of relating one thing to another.  Decimals come up with<br/>
money.  Percentages come up with sales, tax, food labels, possibility of<br/>
winning a contest, shrinking an image in a paint program.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s gaining a feel for the contexts the various concepts are used in, she<br/>
sees me manipulating them and helping her manipulate them.  And in the<br/>
course she&#39;s adding pieces to the puzzle of her world, making new patterns<br/>
and relationships clearer.<br/>
<br/>
Up until recently we&#39;ve done zero in the way of formal math.  Only a few<br/>
months ago she wasn&#39;t totally consistent on her addition but I asked her if<br/>
she knew what 8x5 was.  She said that was 16 +16 + 8.  *Not* 8+8+8+8+8,<br/>
which would have been a good answer showing she understood the concept of<br/>
multiplication, but she manipulated the numbers properly into something she<br/>
could feel more intuitively.<br/>
<br/>
Recently she has been doing paper and pencil math under protest.  Sort of.<br/>
<br/>
She wants to earn money for Pokemon cards.  I buy the packs at any where<br/>
from $4-$6 a piece, pull out the trainer cards and then calculate how much<br/>
she needs to pay for each Pokemon card.  (Or have her do it for a whole<br/>
card, though that&#39;s still a bit beyond her true understanding even if she<br/>
does get the answer right.)  I suggested all sorts of household tasks for<br/>
her to earn 25 cents or a dollar or whatever which were met with groans.<br/>
(She even turned down *$2* to clean out the floor of my car!  ;-)  I<br/>
suggested she do pages in the Miquon math workbooks that have been gathering<br/>
dust on the shelf at 10 cents per page.  Being a low energy child (like her<br/>
mother ;-) she usually opts for the math.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s getting *much* better at the pages, but I can still see a huge<br/>
difference between what she does on paper versus what she does with the real<br/>
meaningful numbers in her life.  She quickly calculates in her head how much<br/>
she&#39;s earned and how much she needs and how much she&#39;ll have left over after<br/>
buying a card, tells me how many 36 cent cards she can get with her $2<br/>
allowance versus how many 41 cent ones.  (And she does this without drills<br/>
and without pages of workbook practice, just from messing around with the<br/>
numbers in her life in a very low key way -- the stuff she&#39;s doing in the<br/>
workbooks is actually much simpler.)  She told me the way she figured out<br/>
16+16 was it was just 10+10 then 6+6 which is 12 which is 10+2, so that was<br/>
10+10+10+2 or 32.  She&#39;s discovering for herself how to break numbers apart<br/>
and play around with them.  And she *knows* why someone would want to do<br/>
that.  If it were taught in a book, it would take weeks and most kids would<br/>
still be baffled about what the purpose of it was.<br/>
<br/>
Pencil and paper math and head math *are* different.  The pencil and paper<br/>
math are a new language she&#39;s learning.  And yet, I&#39;m quite confident if we<br/>
had gone on without much pencil and paper stuff (other than the normal<br/>
things that come up in life) she would have caught onto it *way* quicker in<br/>
a couple of years without the agony she was putting herself through.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s obviously a far way from algebra and trig and calc.<br/>
<br/>
Someone pointed out that algebra is just figuring out what you don&#39;t know<br/>
from what you do know.  Now how did I get all the way through engineering<br/>
school without realizing that insight?  Maybe because I enjoyed identifying<br/>
the problem types and figuring out which methodology to apply to them.  It<br/>
didn&#39;t make any difference whether I truly understood why I was doing what I<br/>
was doing.  The fun was it worked.  Because that&#39;s how algebra is taught.<br/>
It&#39;s all about practicing manipulating different types of equations.  It&#39;s<br/>
not about what those equations mean.  Or why anyone would want to write a<br/>
quadratic equation let alone solve it.  It&#39;s all just preparation for<br/>
potential contexts.  But the equations themselves have no context.  They&#39;re<br/>
meaningless.   (Unless you&#39;re one of the &quot;good&quot; ones who rise to the surface<br/>
through this bizarre math-teaching process just because you happen to like<br/>
to manipulate equations for the sake of manipulating equations.)<br/>
<br/>
Quadratic equations don&#39;t come up in real life often, but I can help my<br/>
daughter to think algebraically when we tackle real life problems.  (I may<br/>
be doing it already unconsciously, but you&#39;ll have to wait a few years for<br/>
me to be conscious enough of it to provide real life examples of her using<br/>
it.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Of course that isn&#39;t enough to get her into CMU.  Or into MIT either ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Now, given the choice, I&#39;m quite certain I wouldn&#39;t have gotten in enough<br/>
math on my own to get into CMU.  So what makes me certain my daughter will?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m *not* certain, but what leads me to believe that my daughter&#39;s<br/>
outlook will be different is, for one thing, I was the victim of force-fed<br/>
learning.  I needed to be force fed math because I&#39;d always been force fed<br/>
learning.  I needed to be force fed school math because it had no<br/>
relationship to my own world.  I didn&#39;t *need* it.  I can&#39;t imagine learning<br/>
what I learned on my own because the only thing I have to base my imaginings<br/>
on are the process I went through.<br/>
<br/>
What I *can* imagine, though, is being so intrigued by something that the<br/>
math gets learned because it makes what I&#39;m interested in make sense.  I<br/>
*can* imagine forcing myself to learn something in order to achieve<br/>
something else.  (HTML comes to mind ;-)  Though that was more a combination<br/>
of both of them.)<br/>
<br/>
What my daughter has going for her is a different experience with math.<br/>
Other than the workbook pages :-P, she&#39;s used to seeing math as a tool.<br/>
She&#39;s used to using math because she wants the information it can give her.<br/>
So when she gets to high school, she won&#39;t have the memory of 8 previous<br/>
years of drudgework associated with math.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll also have a better foundation of understanding what she&#39;s doing.<br/>
Though she might be behind her PS counterparts in calculation speed, she&#39;ll<br/>
be ahead in understanding what the processes mean.  (But the speed will<br/>
depend on her.  If she feels working around gaps in her multiplication<br/>
tables is more annoying than learning the tables -- and if she knows that<br/>
drilling them or doing other things will help her (and it&#39;s my job to help<br/>
her learn to identify when a problem exists and to seek out solutions) --<br/>
then she&#39;ll learn them.  If not, she won&#39;t.  (*I* still have gaps in my<br/>
tables.)<br/>
<br/>
So she&#39;ll hit her high school years with a different attitude towards math<br/>
and learning math.  (And this really applies to *all* subjects.)<br/>
<br/>
But will she be able to pick up all the math she needs to get into college<br/>
just by living?  Well, yes and no.<br/>
<br/>
This is where it gets hard to explain because our thinking is based on<br/>
oodles more assumptions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so easy to project a schooled teen (which includes most of us) as a<br/>
normal teen and assume all kids given the chance will watch TV and eat<br/>
concoctions centering on sugar, fat and salt all day and want nothing more<br/>
in life than 256 channels and a clicker in the hand ;-)  That behavior is<br/>
caused by the stress of school (and a lot of other factors.  I have another<br/>
rant about being forced to spend 12 years working towards a vague goal that<br/>
someone else has chosen for you. ;-)  But in an environment where the adults<br/>
and everyone else in the family are curious about life, where everyone&#39;s<br/>
interests are taken seriously (even the so-called non-educational ones), the<br/>
kids are actively curious too.  There&#39;s no reason for them to want to shut<br/>
their brains down as a life&#39;s goal.  (Which doesn&#39;t mean my daughter doesn&#39;t<br/>
watch TV.  At times she even watches a lot of TV.  But she chooses it for<br/>
other reason than shutting off the world.  (Though that&#39;s a legitimate use<br/>
too.  It&#39;s just that she doesn&#39;t have to spend a goodly portion of her free<br/>
time recovering from 6 hours of force fed learning in a high-stress<br/>
environment everyday.)<br/>
<br/>
Had unschooling been thrust upon me as a teen, I imagine I would have spent<br/>
as much time as possible doing nothing.  It&#39;s hard to imagine a teen<br/>
learning on their own something that we ourselves would avoid.  It seems<br/>
obvious that given the choice most teens would avoid Shakespeare or American<br/>
History or Algebra or whatever school made us hate because we know *we&#39;d*<br/>
avoid it.  But, given a choice, would we have avoided it because it&#39;s<br/>
inherently dull or because school made it dull?  It isn&#39;t fair to assume the<br/>
behavior of a schooled teen is normal behavior.  The only experience<br/>
schooled kids have had with most subjects is dull textbooks.  The life has<br/>
been sucked out of all subjects for them.  Why *would* they pursue them on<br/>
their own?  Especially if they assume the only way to learn them in a<br/>
worthwhile way is the way schools teach them?<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no reason for my daughter to avoid learning because she&#39;s never been<br/>
forced to do it.  To her learning is something you do to find out more about<br/>
what you&#39;re interested in and to become better at it.  It&#39;s not something<br/>
someone makes you do because they tell you you need it.<br/>
<br/>
She *will* avoid learning in ways that aren&#39;t natural for her or don&#39;t suit<br/>
her needs.  Some kids like workbooks.  That doesn&#39;t make them better<br/>
learners than those kids who don&#39;t.  It just means they learn differently.<br/>
She *will* avoid learning anything that isn&#39;t relevant to what she wants to<br/>
do or is interested in.  Which makes parents nervous for two reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1) What if she never gets interested?  It&#39;s possible she won&#39;t on her own.<br/>
But it&#39;s my job/pleasure to run as much of the world in front of her as<br/>
possible.  The broader her experiences, the more likely something will<br/>
connect to something else in her life and be relevant.  (Though I can&#39;t<br/>
depend on when.)  Everything is connected to everything else. And everything<br/>
relevant is inherently interesting.<br/>
<br/>
*But* it&#39;s also possible she won&#39;t get interested in something &quot;important&quot;.<br/>
Math?  Writing?  Chemistry?  If she has absolutely no interest in it, then<br/>
it&#39;s unlikely she&#39;ll be drawn to a profession that needs it to an extent<br/>
greater than she can pick up by living.  Though she won&#39;t leave the house<br/>
without being able to figure out sales tax or write a letter to a friend or<br/>
know that baking powder is important in cookies because she&#39;ll have used<br/>
those.  She&#39;ll have enough to get by.  But it&#39;s possible she&#39;ll need higher<br/>
math than she has.  Or better writing skills.  Or an entire chemistry<br/>
course.  Well, if it&#39;s just chemistry standing in her way, wouldn&#39;t it make<br/>
sense for her to go down to the community college and take it rather than<br/>
deciding on a different career just because of one course?  And if that&#39;s<br/>
too much trouble, how much did she want that career anyway?<br/>
<br/>
But math and writing?  Well, I hope something I&#39;m saying here helps you see<br/>
why I believe there&#39;s a middle ground between &quot;no math&quot; and 4 years of high<br/>
school math from textbooks.  And writing I talk about below.<br/>
<br/>
2) And the second reason it makes parents nervous is supposedly there are<br/>
things kids need to learn that they won&#39;t need until college.  And<br/>
supposedly it takes 12 years to learn them.<br/>
<br/>
But does it?  Does it take 12 years to learn math?  Or does it take 12 years<br/>
for *schools* to force feed a child math (and writing and history, et al) by<br/>
the methods they need to use to force feed 30 kids at a time?  Methods which<br/>
are also limited to ways that can result in outcomes that can be tested to<br/>
demonstrate progress.  Also limited only to methods that must be progressive<br/>
along a specific track so the next year&#39;s teacher can pick up where the<br/>
previous teacher left off.  Does *math* need taught that way?  Or do schools<br/>
need to teach it that way to satisfy the needs of schools as assembly lines?<br/>
<br/>
In a way, school math is rather like learning to spell thousands of words<br/>
and decline hundreds of verbs of a foreign language without hearing that<br/>
foreign language spoken.  The rationale being that once all the parts are<br/>
learned, the whole can be built from that.  But how many kids survive the<br/>
rote process?  How many kids conclude not before long that the language is<br/>
useless because the parts have no meaning?  My daughter is hearing the<br/>
language and using it, without formally declining the verbs and learning the<br/>
spellings.  Even if she&#39;d never been exposed to reading it (but already had<br/>
the decoding skills from reading English) how long would it take her to<br/>
learn to read that foreign language after having learned it from using it?<br/>
<br/>
Once my daughter has a thorough understanding of what it means to do<br/>
division, she won&#39;t need umpty gajillion problems to practice.  Once she has<br/>
a thorough understanding of problems with a range of potential solutions<br/>
(programming and robotics come right to mind), and has encountered and<br/>
understood powers and negative numbers she won&#39;t need years of practice to<br/>
grasp algebra.  <br/>
<br/>
My job is to make sure there are reasons in my daughter&#39;s environment to<br/>
need the skills and see them being used.  (Just as I talked to her well<br/>
before she could talk.)  Though she finds a lot of uses for the skills on<br/>
her own, given the freedom to do so.  There&#39;s no reason for her to avoid<br/>
writing or reading or math (until the workbooks) on her own because she&#39;s<br/>
never been forced to do them.  The hard part is waiting for *her* timescale.<br/>
I need to wait until these things are internally important to her.  I can&#39;t<br/>
worry, well, she&#39;s 8 now and should be doing ... because natural learning<br/>
doesn&#39;t have anything to do with calendars and time schedules.  It has to do<br/>
with needs.<br/>
<br/>
If she has a goal in mind, she won&#39;t have anything except natural barriers<br/>
between her and it.  She won&#39;t have what someone thinks she needs to get<br/>
there and someone else&#39;s *way* she needs to get it standing in her way.  If<br/>
she decides to become a vet, she&#39;ll know what colleges require for her to<br/>
get there.  *If* her desire is strong enough, she&#39;ll learn what she needs to<br/>
learn because she wants what the learning can get for her.  (Desire is an<br/>
incredible motivator.)  *And* most importantly she&#39;ll have better resources<br/>
to achieve it than sitting down with a textbook and slogging through it.<br/>
(Though that&#39;s an option too.  Fortunately she won&#39;t have the history of<br/>
slogging through textbooks putting up a psychological barrier for her.)<br/>
She&#39;ll have a good foundation of *understanding* math concepts and will see<br/>
it and other math being used (and use it herself) as she explores what it<br/>
takes to be a vet: taking care of animals, working in a vet office or a<br/>
horse stable.<br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{So, if your kids aren&#39;t prepared enough to go to a university, then<br/>
you assume that they will be motivated to study once they get rejected?}**<br/>
<br/>
The answer to this one is probably obvious from the above.  No, I don&#39;t<br/>
expect rejection to spur her.  I expect wanting to do something will spur<br/>
her to do something.  And perhaps that something won&#39;t even be college.  I<br/>
too had visions of my daughter going onto CMU or MIT.  But now my vision has<br/>
shifted from preparing her to be anything she wants to be to helping her be<br/>
the best her she can be.  Yet I&#39;m not sitting around waiting to pounce on<br/>
her interests to nurture them.  I&#39;m also directing things through her world<br/>
that I think are important or I think will interest her.  When (if ever) she<br/>
picks up on them is up to her.  The more important I think something is, the<br/>
more likely I&#39;ll keep directing it in her path in a way that will interest<br/>
her, or connect it to something she is interested in.<br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{ We do provide a very stimulating environment.  We have books and<br/>
materials everywhere.  Lots of interesting folks float in and out of our<br/>
home and office.  While my 9 yo son likes to read and mess around with the<br/>
computer, he wouldn&#39;t ever just open up a math book.}**<br/>
<br/>
Nor would most kids.  For a child to choose the more formal learning in a<br/>
book requires an interest and need that the book can fulfill.  The<br/>
environment may be there, but he&#39;s not ready to ask the questions that the<br/>
books will answer for him.  Or he may be discovering the answers on his own<br/>
through self-discovery or talking to people.  Unfortunately for nervous<br/>
parents, you can&#39;t put unschooling on a time schedule.  You can&#39;t set up the<br/>
environment and expect there to be a specific outcome at a specific time.<br/>
(Though I can just about guarantee that if the innate talent or desire is in<br/>
him for what the computers and people and books can provide, by the time<br/>
he&#39;s 14 he&#39;ll have sucked the environment for all it&#39;s worth ;-)  9 is way<br/>
too soon for most kids to be doing more than playing around with things and<br/>
exploring broadly.  They may be delving deeply into some things, but the<br/>
cognitive development necessary to make them open a math book for<br/>
information just isn&#39;t there until the teen years.  (Of course there&#39;re<br/>
always exceptions.  But do the exceptions mean that the nonexceptions are<br/>
falling behind?  Or are the nonexceptions just learning other perhaps less<br/>
obvious things?  A HS&#39;d friend of my daughter&#39;s has *at 8* read all the<br/>
Little House books and all their sequels and is well into other historical<br/>
novels.  Am I jealous?  Well, yeah, of course ;-)  Yet my daughter is, less<br/>
obviously, picking up bits and pieces of world and American history.  She&#39;s<br/>
gaining a broad overview of it all, expanding some bits here and there as<br/>
she finds out more about someone or something she&#39;s heard interesting things<br/>
about.  Is one learner better than the other or are they just different?)<br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{My son also wouldn&#39;t write anything on paper, which I understand is<br/>
fairly typical for boys.  Writing skills don&#39;t progress overnight.}**<br/>
<br/>
Who says?  Okay, not overnight, but does it take *years* of practice?  Or<br/>
does it take years of *using* the skills in ways that are meaningful for the<br/>
learner?  <br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{Are you saying that I should encourage, but not demand?  I am still<br/>
missing something in terms of how this unschooling plays out.}**<br/>
<br/>
How well would you learn Hindi if someone decided it would be important for<br/>
your future because they used Hindi in their lives and so made you practice<br/>
for the next 10 years?  Wouldn&#39;t your goal be to learn as little as possible<br/>
to satisfy them?  But if you were moving to India, then wouldn&#39;t learning<br/>
Hindi take *way* less time?<br/>
<br/>
What your son needs is being immersed in an environment where it&#39;s important<br/>
to communicate his ideas.  He also needs to see others using communication<br/>
in a meaningful way and to read and hear others communicating in various<br/>
ways.  When *he* needs to communicate using the written word, he will.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, you can make sure he has access to the skills.  Listen to a<br/>
variety of things: conversation, books and books on tape, comic books,<br/>
movies (reading the scripts of favorites is really cool), plays, puppet<br/>
shows, poetry, folk tales, nonfiction, cereal boxes, TV Guide, political<br/>
talk shows, lyrics, ministers, magazine articles, Nintendo magazine, science<br/>
shows, letters to the editor.  *Anything* as long as he&#39;s interested.  He<br/>
needs to hear good (and bad) literature so his ear can learn the rhythms of<br/>
language.  I&#39;ve pointed out to my daughter why it&#39;s tough for me to read the<br/>
Magic Tree House books outloud to her and she can now pick up on parts that<br/>
sound awkward.  (It wasn&#39;t a lesson, just an outgrowth of a natural<br/>
discussion.  Which is probably the heart of unschooling: just talking<br/>
naturally about things that happen along.  Despite the fact that I&#39;m not a<br/>
great talker, some amazing things have come up in conversation.)  It has<br/>
probably inadvertently sowed the seed of her being more conscious of there<br/>
being a range of how well written things are.  She would have learned that<br/>
anyway though perhaps unconsciously.<br/>
<br/>
(That &quot;happen along&quot; part of unschooling is misleading.  It&#39;s not that I&#39;m<br/>
leaving things to chance, nor am I deliberately bringing something in as a<br/>
lesson.  I direct a lot of things her way and just from experience know that<br/>
from the wealth of things, there will be unexpected learning.  Nothing I can<br/>
plan though.  She learned more than anyone would imagine from a few weeks<br/>
watching Gilligan&#39;s Island.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Writing is just talking on paper.  You&#39;re trying to see where someone<br/>
mentally is relative to where you intend your words to take them and then<br/>
you plan out a course to get them there.  Talk to your son.  Ask him to<br/>
explain what he&#39;s doing and ask questions to help him learn to order his<br/>
thoughts and learn to see from the point of view of who he&#39;s communicating<br/>
with rather than from his own position.  (But only ask if you&#39;re interested.<br/>
Kids have good radar for lessons masked as conversation ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Unless someone has gotten the idea that writing is hard by being forced to<br/>
write before they are ready or need to, or being forced to write in ways<br/>
that aren&#39;t natural to them, once they realize it&#39;s just talking on paper,<br/>
that little extra step is hardly any step at all.  There&#39;s additional skills<br/>
they can learn, like how to organize their thoughts for something longer,<br/>
but it&#39;s not a skill that needs 12 years of practice.  (A schooled friend of<br/>
my daughter&#39;s came over to play with my daughter and they decided to make<br/>
books together.  The schooled girl told her there were all these things you<br/>
had to do: title page, a plan, and some other things.  My daughter said<br/>
&quot;Oh,&quot; and just made books.  The schooled girl never did finish.  Merely an<br/>
anecdote that may mean nothing, but it is a piece of data.)<br/>
<br/>
I think it only takes years to learn to write when people are forced to<br/>
write things they don&#39;t care about.  Where does most writing practice end<br/>
up?  In the trash, right?  Real writing should make a difference in people&#39;s<br/>
lives.  Sure there&#39;s project reports and documentation to write, but do we<br/>
need to force kids to write boring stuff so they&#39;ll be prepared to write<br/>
boring stuff?<br/>
<br/>
High school is when it&#39;s more common for kids to feel the need to put words<br/>
on paper.  But, again, they need real reasons.  Perhaps letters of complaint<br/>
about a product, letters to the editor, a family newsletter, a pen pal,<br/>
email, message boards, an article for the local paper, or one of the<br/>
websites out there that kids can submit their writing to.<br/>
<br/>
But many of these things can be &quot;laying around&quot; for him right now, suggested<br/>
when it&#39;s possible he&#39;d be interested.  And dropped when he&#39;s not or carried<br/>
as far as his interest carries him.  As long as he sees writing as<br/>
purposeful, then there won&#39;t be anything other than natural barriers between<br/>
him and putting words to paper.<br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{Studies I have read show that certain windows open for certain math<br/>
concepts at specific times.  There seems to be accumulating evidence for a<br/>
certain scope and sequence for math too.  I am talking primarily about<br/>
getting skills so you can do higher level math.}**<br/>
<br/>
The studies, of course, are based on kids whose basically only exposure to<br/>
math is in school.  Math to them is artificial, irrelevant to their own<br/>
world.  How many parents are helping their kids use the math that&#39;s all<br/>
around them?  Math, to most kids (and adults!) is just the stuff in math<br/>
books.<br/>
<br/>
But, my daughter *is* being exposed to math right now, using it in ways that<br/>
are meaningful to her.  She&#39;s using the skills she needs right now.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sitting around waiting for her to pick up a math text.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, there probably is a window of opportunity for math knowledge.  But<br/>
there&#39;s no way to miss it if a child&#39;s curiosity is being fed and she is<br/>
immersed in the language of math.  There&#39;s a window for learning to speak<br/>
too, but the only way to miss that is by not speaking to the child.  As long<br/>
as we speak math to our kids, they&#39;ll learn the parts they are<br/>
developmentally ready for.<br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{What if she chooses no math?  How do you handle that?}**<br/>
<br/>
Obviously she hasn&#39;t yet.  It is possible she&#39;ll decide to be a painter and<br/>
won&#39;t need math beyond consumer math and what&#39;s relevant to the science of<br/>
color.  But she&#39;ll have been exposed to fun stuff like Fibonacci numbers and<br/>
probabilities and algebraic thought.  But, honestly, how many people need<br/>
algebra?  Why torment a child with &quot;what if&quot; when it&#39;s more likely to cause<br/>
them to dislike the subject than to learn it?<br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{If I tell my wife that I want to try this unschooling approach<br/>
starting tomorrow, then what we would do at 8 AM?}**<br/>
<br/>
Sleep?  Eat?  Watch TV?  Go outside and enjoy the sun shining through the<br/>
trees?  Read a book?<br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{Would my son choose when he gets up?}**<br/>
<br/>
Unless he stops breathing, he&#39;s always weighing his options and making<br/>
choices.  They may not be the choices *you&#39;d* want him to make.  But, what<br/>
if you knew your wife had an agenda for you and there were &quot;right&quot; choices<br/>
in her eyes and &quot;wrong&quot; choices and you knew she was weighing the choices<br/>
you were making against her idea of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; and judging the<br/>
quality of your choices?  How would that affect your relationship?  I assume<br/>
there are some things you each do to please the other, but they are *still*<br/>
choices.  The more pressure someone feels from the other to make the choices<br/>
the other wants them to make, the more strain there is in the relationship.<br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{Would he choose what he wants to learn?  Should we let him mess with<br/>
the Star Wars games on the computer all day?  I am going to go out on a limb<br/>
and guess you would say that he would eventually get bored and look for<br/>
something else to do or that I should keep offering interesting tidbits he<br/>
couldn&#39;t resist?}**<br/>
<br/>
Yup.  If he&#39;s interested, he&#39;s learning.  It may be hard to see how what<br/>
he&#39;s learning relates to what is &quot;important&quot; in life.  In fact, it may only<br/>
be relevant to his life right now.  But it *is* relevant.  It&#39;s nurturing<br/>
the person he is now.  I think we concentrate too much on moving kids along<br/>
to what they should become and preparing them for that.<br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{What if he says he never wants to do writing ever?}**<br/>
<br/>
Well, what if?  There&#39;s *plenty* of professions where people don&#39;t need to<br/>
write.  But do you really think that if he loves something that he will<br/>
choose something else just because he doesn&#39;t want to write?<br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{We just wait him out until he thinks he needs it?}**<br/>
<br/>
And why shouldn&#39;t it be important that he write when he thinks he needs it?<br/>
Why should it be *more* important that he write when *you* think he needs<br/>
it?  Wouldn&#39;t that mean when all kids hit 12 months we should *make* them<br/>
walk because that&#39;s when kids need to walk, and we all know how important<br/>
walking is so they should get started when we think it&#39;s important?  Unless<br/>
there&#39;s something physically wrong with them, or their environment<br/>
discourages it, all kids do eventually learn to walk just because they feel<br/>
the need to.<br/>
<br/>
If someone made me write an essay on math and kids, it would be as short as<br/>
possible to make them go away.  But since I&#39;m writing this &quot;essay&quot; to<br/>
satisfy my own need to get all these thoughts in order, it&#39;s as long as it<br/>
needs to be for me.<br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{Is it my role to lecture the benefits of the things I have to offer,<br/>
but to back off if he doesn&#39;t want them?}**<br/>
<br/>
Lecture?  Ick.  How important would you feel something was if your wife<br/>
decided to lecture you about it&#39;s importance?  What would come across is her<br/>
needing to *make* you feel the same way she does about something.  And<br/>
personally, when someone&#39;s trying to make me feel some way about something,<br/>
I tend to work up the opposite feelings.<br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{So sorry.  I should have read the whole post more carefully.  My<br/>
wife preached to me about that.  OK.  That is what you would do.  I have a<br/>
hard time with that one.  I don&#39;t think you can play catch up in math and<br/>
science all that fast. My opinion only.}**<br/>
<br/>
But I do have the advantage of seeing the same math being learned naturally<br/>
*way* easier than it&#39;s being taught and learned in school.  I have the<br/>
advantage of reading other people&#39;s kids&#39; experiences with unschooling math.<br/>
(Helen Hegener has a good story about her son and trigonometry as I recall.)<br/>
<br/>
As for science, ah, I have a rant about that too ;-)  The short version is,<br/>
I think way too much emphasis is placed on memorizing the answers to<br/>
questions kids haven&#39;t asked and way too little time on fostering scientific<br/>
thinking and fostering a wonder about how the universe works.  Once kids are<br/>
curious, they&#39;ll want the facts.  Once they want the facts, they go in so<br/>
easily.<br/>
<br/>
**&#92;blue{I need to read a book about the day and the life of an unschooler in<br/>
my spare time.}**<br/>
<br/>
Actually a day in the life of an unschooler looks a lot like summer days and<br/>
weekends for other people.  Unschooling isn&#39;t so much in what unschoolers do<br/>
as in their attitude towards life and learning and how they&#39;re intertwined.<br/>
Our conversations are our lessons without being lessons.  Everytime my<br/>
daughter spontaneously asks a question or tells me about an observation,<br/>
that&#39;s a &quot;test&quot; that shows me unschooling is working.  She may not be<br/>
learning a set group of facts that others think are important and can test,<br/>
but her questions and observations show she&#39;s *thinking* about what she&#39;s<br/>
learning.  For example, it&#39;s not so important that she learn that sound<br/>
waves bounce off things because that can go in as a factoid without any real<br/>
meaning or understanding behind it, but it is important that she bounced a<br/>
ball off a wall and said that was like a sound wave.  She&#39;s making<br/>
connections.<br/>

math that my son is not noticeably learning.  My sneaky, and not exactly<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t classify it as not unschooling (or unschooling either) since the<br/>
original impetus wasn&#39;t to learn math but to earn money. Admittedly I chose<br/>
math as one of the tasks because it doesn&#39;t feel -- compared to math in<br/>
school! -- like she gets enough practice. (So in that way it was about<br/>
learning math. But, in that way, it definitely wasn&#39;t unschooling. It was a<br/>
schooly reaction to one of those panicky moments.) But the whole point of<br/>
relating the story was that she already does understand the workings of<br/>
numbers from what little she does in real life and doesn&#39;t need the<br/>
workbooks, paid or not. Real life *is* enough so my fears are groundless.<br/>
<br/>
The failing wasn&#39;t in whether it was or wasn&#39;t unschooling but the fact that<br/>
I&#39;m a tightwad and that she doesn&#39;t want to do a series of tasks to work up<br/>
to the money she needs. (If I had to do 35 tasks at a $1 a piece I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
either!) I&#39;m still trying to puzzle out the dynamics of the situation since<br/>
it&#39;s a lot like controlling a child&#39;s food or tv watching. And yet it isn&#39;t.<br/>
Or I&#39;m just rationalizing that it isn&#39;t.<br/>

Gotta say I agree with you Betsy.<br/>
Rewarding for behavior is manipulative and directive and not(if you <br/>
are bribing for math work to be done), IMO unschooling.<br/>
