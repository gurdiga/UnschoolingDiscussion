&quot;Dived&quot; is the past tense of dive, a verb.<br/>
It IS good and correct grammar. &quot;I dove into the pool&quot; is NOT.<br/>
Common mistake. <br/>

<br/>
Dove is a perfectly good past tense for &quot;dive,&quot; but as with many lesser-used <br/>
verbs, it is moving toward regular conjugation from its traditional form.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the only one.<br/>

Well I would certainly encourage you to speak up more Denise. :o)<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ll recall, I was also one of the folks disagreeing with Ned on the <br/>
*phonics first and foremost* posts. I&#39;m ready to tell about how things have <br/>
worked for us and ready to examine, for myself, whether those approaches are <br/>
unschooling approaches. So far, I have been very pleased with our lives and <br/>
my kids learning by taking the more radical unschooling approach. So I guess <br/>
it doesn&#39;t bother me so much if someone points our something as a little too <br/>
schoolish. Live and learn, that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
