&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am replying privately as I think this has been talked to death on the<br/>
&gt; list.  Continuing will change nothing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have not been rude, defensive, or condescending in any of my messages.<br/>
&gt; And no, I do not need any attntion from you.  The tone of your missive is<br/>
&gt; very patronizing and is not appreciated.  You do not agree with my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>position,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and you are perfectly entitled to to that.  I am afforded that same<br/>
 </span></blockquote>right, I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do not have to agree with you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a very real double standard on this list.  The majority of the<br/>
&gt; people here do not believe in spanking, and made some very strong<br/>
 </span></blockquote>statements<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; regarding it, even to calling spanking abusive.  Those statements were<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; called &quot;judgmental&quot; , nor were the posters called names.  Why is it any<br/>
&gt; different to say that parents who spank are abusive than to say that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>leaving<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; children in full time care is harmful?  There is no difference, except in<br/>
&gt; your perception.  It would appear that what you agree with is okay to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>say,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and what you don&#39;t agree with is judgmental.  That is a very narrow view.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is, and has been, my stand that children are harmed by being abandoned<br/>
 </span></blockquote>by<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their parents.  I never said the parents were &quot;bad&quot;or &quot;abusive&quot;.  I said<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is a wrong action because it harms the children.  I firmly believe that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; rights of children supercede the wishes, or even rights, or adults.  If<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; choose to disagree with this then so be it.  Your disagreement does not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>make<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my view &quot;judgmental&quot;, it makes it different.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have tried to be very clear, and have been repeating myself for days<br/>
 </span></blockquote>here,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to no avail.  If you enjoy attacking those who hold different views than<br/>
&gt; yours please attack elsewhere.  If you would like to engage in a<br/>
