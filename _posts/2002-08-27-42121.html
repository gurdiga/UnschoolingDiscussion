 </span></blockquote>Good work, Sheila. It does take school teachers longer than others to<br/>
realize that schoolwork is not education....it&#39;s just schoolwork. Someday,<br/>
your parents will get it.<br/>
<br/>
My son also did what your brother did -- dropped out (on my recommendation)<br/>
and learned guitar, on his own, well enough to get into the LA Conservatory<br/>
of Music and play lead guitar in a band. His own company now makes sound<br/>
tracks for commercials when his new band is not working.<br/>
<br/>
School, of course, never encouraged him to do any of the things he liked or<br/>
was good at. Schools are excellent at pointing out what children are not<br/>
good at or interested in.<br/>
