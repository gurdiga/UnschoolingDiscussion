<div id="ygrps-yiv-578714659"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Maybe she doesn&#39;t really have a good grasp of what the word &quot;math&quot; means. It<br/>
&gt; might seem foreign and mysterious to her. Or she&#39;s heard from other kids or<br/>
&gt; on TV that math is hard and to be avoided.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Life is good.<br/>
&gt; ~Mary<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a good point - not knowing what the word means can sure make<br/>
someone feel they cannot deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
Mathematics (dictionary definition): The knowledge and skill of using<br/>
numbers and symbols to describe and deal with amounts, measurements and<br/>
shapes and the relationships between these. It is a group of sciences<br/>
that include arithmetic, geometry, algebra and calculus [and others for<br/>
higher math]. Derivation &gt;Greek for &quot;something learned.&quot; <br/>
In England and many former British colonies, the term used is maths with<br/>
an &#39;s&#39; rather than math  because it is recognized that it is made up of<br/>
several branches.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know what arithmetic is as opposed to mathematics?<br/>
Arithmetic actually means the skills of using numbers to count, add,<br/>
subtract, multiply and divide, and these operations are done with whole<br/>
numbers, fractions, decimals and percents.  It is pretty interesting<br/>
that the first thing you do when finding out about fractions is to COUNT<br/>
with them. In the old 1800&#39;s school books, they actually did exercises<br/>
to count aloud 1/4, 2/4 (or 1/2), 3/4, 4/4 (or 1), 5/4 (or 1 1/4), etc<br/>
to get the feel for the whole continuum of number and where fractions<br/>
fit in. OF course you can do that with portions of a chocolate bar or<br/>
other concrete things. <br/>
<br/>
My own formulated purpose for mathematics: Tools and a language to think<br/>
about and communicate with precision in solving problems of interest in<br/>
life. Math is used to put order into the universe to be able to handle<br/>
it more easily and efficiently.<br/>
<br/>
Actually an underlying thought of that came from someone else: &quot;<br/>
Mathematics is just a nice big beautiful term for precise thinking ...&quot;.<br/>
L. Ron Hubbard  Also by Hubbard: &quot;... [the mind] perceives, poses, and<br/>
resolves problems relating to the survival of the organism, the future<br/>
generations, the group, life and the physical universe and puts the<br/>
solutions into action.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Way useful stuff, mathematics. If you are dealing with the physical<br/>
universe. I always try to expand my own use of math in life -- look<br/>
where it has taken us: computers, space flights, buildings, etc - you<br/>
can get a complex product when you can do math! <br/>
<br/>
AT a level in between measuring stuff in cooking and operating space<br/>
flights is this fun question: &quot;How many Ping-Pong balls do you think<br/>
would fit inside this room?&quot; Quite a question for speculation....  THis<br/>
is from a book called &quot;Family Learning&quot; by William Russell, who then<br/>
goes on to describe guessing what it would be, and trying to figure out<br/>
what a real ball park estimate would be, and finally devising a way to<br/>
figure it out by seeing how many Ping-Pong balls would fit along the<br/>
bottom of one wall (which could be done by measuring across the ball and<br/>
then measuring the distance of the wall and seeing how many would fit<br/>
there), then seeing how many Ping-Pong balls would fit along the side<br/>
wall to that one, and then finally how many would fit  up the wall in<br/>
the corner between the floor and calling. Hmm... that is three<br/>
measurements, the measure of three dimensions.... giving you voila! the<br/>
volume of space in the room calculated in Ping-Pong balls. I really<br/>
laughed when I read that one and immediately wanted to go off and try<br/>
it. Family learning is a delightful book covering all kinds of ideas,<br/>
not just math. i like it! Hmm.. I&#39;m going to add it to my website of<br/>
recommendations.<br/>

That would work if they were cubes, but won&#39;t a sphere fit down in the space <br/>
left by four spheres together (on one plane, I mean) and shouldn&#39;t you get <br/>
more ping-pong balls into a space than you would same-size cubes?<br/>

But she doesn&#39;t WANT math now. I say put the title of the book in a safe<br/>
place. I wouldn&#39;t even buy it now. She wants nothing to do with math so why<br/>
buy it for her to spark an interest? The interest isn&#39;t there and it will<br/>
only be sparked by her. Forget about math and let her be 14.<br/>

  I agree with Kelly. She will do math when and if she needs to and if she doesn&#39;t do it then she is not ready to explore the medical school thing.I have repeatedly seen my children leave things and then go to them when they want to. If I am hoping, thinking, wanting, slipping suggestions, hints anything it will not happen.Medical school is not about you. It is about her. You would still be a good enough parent even if she does not become a doctor. And if she disappoints herself it is her right to not yours<br/>

ME over the last couple of days.  I didn&#39;t want to have to say, hey let&#39;s do <br/>
some math!  And now I don&#39;t have to!!!  That&#39;s a great relief to me.  I <br/>
thought I was getting to the point (and I think I know how I got there) that <br/>
I was going to be more &quot;suggestful&quot; to Cait than I ever want to be about <br/>
learning anything.<br/>
<br/>
I KNEW it was my problem and I didn&#39;t share it with her but I needed to make <br/>
sure I wasn&#39;t failing her after listening to of all people... a high school <br/>
principal who told me math really needs to be developed layer after layer, <br/>
year after year and that I really should start introducing it to Cait.  I <br/>
should have just thought about my own experiences and figured out that Cait <br/>
is much smarter than I am and if I could just &quot;do it&quot; the night before the <br/>
test, she surely could do much better than myself.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all the helpful &quot;thinking out loud&quot; that you&#39;ve helped me <br/>
do.  It is such a stress from me to just be able to leave math alone just <br/>
like everything else she learns, in her own time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140766515">Hi, <br/>
Hope I got the subject line right-not very good at this yet. This is for the woman with a daughter, Cait, who wants to become a doctor (Glena?). <br/>
Someone mentioned the trouble doctors have with managed care, etc, I believe. Heard some of a good radio program on this not long ago on NPR. The site to listen to the program is &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://discover.npr.org/features/feature.jtml?wfID=9837037">http://discover.npr.org/features/feature.jtml?wfID=9837037</a> . It&#39;s called &#39;physician satisfaction&#39;. In case you can&#39;t get there from the site I gave you, e-mail me privately and I will send you the link. Don&#39;t know if I&#39;m supposed to send that to the whole list. <br/>
In addition, I wonder what there is for her to explore around sites for &#39;emotional support&#39; types of issues in the medical field. My dd 14 is interested in becoming &#39;a therapist&#39;. Of course, as stated, this may change. But now you guys have me wondering about activities or reading pertaining to that. If I find anything that sounds good, I&#39;ll pass it along to you and Cait. Maybe if that&#39;s what interests her about becoming a MD, that&#39;s where to start?<br/>
Also thanks to all for the discussions about how to google things and computer games and resources. This has really helped me find information and become less dependent on thinking one has to take a class in something to learn it. I think that lack of confidence is one of my major hurdles in trying to unschool.<br/>
Funny story about  computers- was doing a newsletter for a nonprofit and the person doing it previously gave me it on disc. I didn&#39;t have that program at home so took it to the library, but then couldn&#39;t figure out how to work it. Asked the reference librarians, they didn&#39;t know. The (homeless looking?) man at the computer next to me asked if I needed help, guided me through the whole thing, and I was grateful to him. In the middle of that, the librarian states one of their rules is that &#39;patrons&#39; are not allowed to help each other on the computers. I said, well, do you know how to do it? (nicely), and she replied &#39;no&#39;. So the man and I ignored that, and I finished the newsletter. <br/>
What a stupid rule, reminds me of school....<br/>
Mary T. in California<br/>
PS to Pam (the math one) I will be seeing you in August at the conference!!!!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776862533">&quot;&gt; Funny story about  computers- was doing a newsletter for a <br/>
nonprofit and the person doing it previously gave me it on disc. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Our library doesn&#39;t allow you to bring a disc from home and use it on <br/>
their computer.  They&#39;re afraid of viruses I guess.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I didn&#39;t have that program at home so took it to the library, but <br/>
then couldn&#39;t figure out how to work it. Asked the reference <br/>
librarians, they didn&#39;t know. The (homeless looking?) man at the <br/>
computer next to me asked if I needed help, guided me through the <br/>
whole thing, and I was grateful to him. In the middle of that, the <br/>
librarian states one of their rules is that &#39;patrons&#39; are not allowed <br/>
to help each other on the computers. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
What?  Sometimes I wonder where these libraries come up with these <br/>
ridiculous rules!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I said, well, do you know how to do it? (nicely), and she <br/>
replied &#39;no&#39;. So the man and I ignored that, and I finished the <br/>
newsletter. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Good for you!  It&#39;s always nice to see people have the courage to <br/>
ignore stupid rules.   We pay for those libraries with our tax <br/>
dollars and shouldn&#39;t have to put up with stupid rules like &quot;patrons <br/>
can&#39;t help each other&quot;.  They&#39;ll probably have a sign up by the <br/>
computers next time you go in though. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who confronted her librarians because they are always <br/>
so miserable.  She said that it would be nice if they would at least <br/>
greet the kids and smile at them instead of acting like they wished <br/>
they weren&#39;t there.  She was told that it&#39;s not in their job <br/>
description to make a fuss over every kid who walks through the <br/>
doors.  They were asking for donations for the library at the time, <br/>
and she suggested a fund raiser.  &quot;Pay a dollar to see a librarian <br/>
smile&quot;.  I think a lot of people who visit that library would pay a <br/>
dollar to see it!  <br/>

our library workers are just great, so I don&#39;t have to.<br/>
