<div id="ygrps-yiv-27627913">This bugs me.  This discussion has been about kid&#39;s not understanding<br/>
when their driving their parents nuts.  Then having to take the blame for<br/>
getting yelled at or worse.  <br/>
Why would an unschooling kid not expect to be able to come to a parent<br/>
for any reason?   Older kids surely understand &quot; I have some work to do &quot;<br/>
so we&#39;re primarily talking about younger kids here.  Why wouldn&#39;t they be<br/>
able to come to a parent?  <br/>
Why wouldn&#39;t an unschooling parent understand that forgetting the punch<br/>
line to a joke is an emergency?  Or not being able to find that lego? <br/>
Why would an unschooling parent be expecting a child to hold in her<br/>
frustration at not being able to get help,  but then not be able to<br/>
contain theirs, if they get pestered?  Just who is  the adult in this<br/>
situation?<br/>
