<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317820984">Hi, I&#39;m new here and pretty new to unschooling.  Well, really I&#39;ve <br/>
probably should really label what I do as Relaxed schooling instead <br/>
of unschooling.  I have to boys who are almost 7 and almost 3 1/2.  I <br/>
started hsing when my oldest was still in preschool. I just about <br/>
worked him to death that yr.  The next yr. was Kindergarten and I <br/>
relaxed a little more.  This yr. he is registered as 1st gr. and <br/>
about 2 1/2 months into the &quot;school yr.&quot; we threw out all the <br/>
workbooks and formal schooling.  I really want to unschool TOTALLY, <br/>
but I&#39;m finding that it is taking ME time to let TOTALLY go.  My ds <br/>
learned to read at an early age and so he is now reading well above <br/>
grade level, so I feel the &quot;need&quot; to make sure he reads everyday.  I <br/>
let him choose what he reads, but I do require it.  Most  days I see <br/>
him with books that he has picked up on his own and he will just read <br/>
a page or two(these are usually books that I&#39;ve already read to <br/>
him).  Why do I think that is not reading?  Why do I think he has to <br/>
finish the book or chapter?????  I want to get past this!!  Math is <br/>
another area.  After I threw out the workbooks we started playing <br/>
math games.  I&#39;ve purchased some &quot;number&quot; games and some &quot;strategy <br/>
and logic&quot; games.  He likes a few of the &quot;number&quot; games(loves Phase <br/>
10 dice game), but he REALLY enjoys the strategy and logic type games <br/>
the best.  I&#39;m wanting to purchase more games, so what do you all <br/>
think, should I purchase an equal amount of both type games(since he <br/>
does like both).  What do you TOTALLY unschoolers think about these <br/>
math games?  <br/>
I would also like any ideas or advice on how I can let go that last <br/>
little bit and TOTALLY unschool. <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128810236">Ok, well, I am by no means an expert, but I do tend to<br/>
have &quot;control issues&quot; and have to stop and remind<br/>
myself not to try and control the way they learn. The<br/>
only thing that works for me totally without fail is<br/>
to really put myself in their shoes. Try to remember<br/>
back to when you were your sons ages and how proud of<br/>
yourself and happy you would be if you were just<br/>
reading a book along all by yourself and then maybe<br/>
something you read reminded you of something else that<br/>
reminded you of something else that you wanted to go<br/>
check out or learn about or pretend about, and you<br/>
knew, since you had the power of knowing how to read<br/>
on your own, that you could come back to your book at<br/>
any time and pick it back up, thanks your mom teaching<br/>
you and instilling that love in you, and how it would<br/>
make you feel if your mom came and made sure you<br/>
finished the chapter, and threw off your groove. <br/>
Being a kid with definitely a mind of my own, I know I<br/>
would&#39;ve decided I just wasn&#39;t going to finish the<br/>
chapter, especially if I HAD to. Our kids tend to be<br/>
alot like we were when we were young and if we try to<br/>
mentally go back there, it makes it a little easier to<br/>
let go and really want to just let them be and learn<br/>
on their own, as opposed to doing it just cuz as<br/>
adults it makes sense to us as being what&#39;s best for<br/>
them. When I don&#39;t do this (thinking like them) I hear<br/>
myself -to my horror- telling them they &quot;HAVE to&quot; sit<br/>
down and finish whatever it is I was hoping they&#39;d<br/>
finish on their own, but maybe their minds have moved<br/>
on. (No! No! That means I&#39;m not in control, darn it!)<br/>
Since we all are surrounded by supportive voices here<br/>
on this list we tend to make it sound &quot;easy&quot;, but<br/>
speaking for myself at least, and I&#39;m sure some others<br/>
out there, it takes ALOT of effort to let go and<br/>
really have faith in our kids own built-in learning<br/>
abilities and intuitions. <br/>
It kind of reminds me of one time when I asked this<br/>
really awesome lady (after overhearing a conversation<br/>
of hers) if she was a Buddhist. She kind of chuckled<br/>
and said &quot;Well... I try to be.&quot; I thought that was an<br/>
awesome answer. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a TOTALLY<br/>
unschooler, even though I am TOTALLY into it, and<br/>
believe in it in all wayz. All I do is TRY. I really<br/>
think that&#39;s all any of us do, as parents, which is<br/>
still way more than alot of kids out there get. Bravo<br/>
to you for caring enough to try, and I&#39;m sure your<br/>
kids are and will be grateful for it for the rest of<br/>
their lives.<br/>
