<div id="ygrps-yiv-57175535">**(I just wish so many &quot;alternative&quot; moms didn&#39;t think unschooling was cool - can we somehow get it to be un-cool? That would save a lot of time and energy.)**<br/>
<br/>
Is this actually possible?  To get something to be un-cool?   And to add on to that thought,  I wish people would stop thinking that it is easy! <br/>
<br/>
I like how someone defended the incoherency of the said parent. Often times as I am working through an issue I waffle like a sheet hangin&#39; on the line.  I am absolutely certain that there have been ( and will be) times that I make absolutely no sense.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I missed the original discussion on Facebook, could someone post a link?<br/>

It happens when you don&#39;t want it to happen, in my experience. :-)<br/>

It&#39;s down in here, but it&#39;s a shame for people to invest time in facebook discussions, as they disappear in the flood of blah blah blah.<br/>
