<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178831196">So there is the conference in dallas only 2 hours away from me and it seems really interesting . Its short travel time with my autistic son and Id be possibly be leaving him with dad for the weekend and having it with just the girls and grandma. Its also not to far away from the heart hospital if there is an emergency and I shuld need to go. <br/>
 <br/>
Then there is the northeast unschooling conference ...a much farther drive ..or plane ride..cheaper to get in but more travel expenses ...but its in a part of the country me and the kids have never gotten to go see before.<br/>

The northeast conference is probably a better match for this list, if  <br/>
that&#39;s an issue.    If you&#39;re going alone and nearer to home, though,   <br/>
that will save lots of money, which you might later be able to spend  <br/>
on doing something cool with the kids later and separate.<br/>

Due to health issues (have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and had a cardiac arrest may 1st) I cant travel out alone for a while. Grandma is going with us. Either conference is going to be a shock to her but I just called her and she said ohhhh! Ive been wanting to go see boston for years now! <br/>
Looks like we are planning a road trip :)   <br/>
