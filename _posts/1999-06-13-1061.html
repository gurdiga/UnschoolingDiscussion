&lt;&lt; (And about science fiction- how many real things were invented because of<br/>
 science fiction?  Lots.  Someone thought of them, then people went on to<br/>
 figure out how to make it happen, or why it couldn&#39;t.)<br/>

fiction.<br/>
If your child is into s.f., I say don&#39;t worry. It also seems to me that <br/>
people who understand s.f. also seem to have alot of common sense and a <br/>
clearer understanding about how things work. That&#39;s my observation anyway.<br/>
I have never understood s.f. My mind just can&#39;t comprehend it for some <br/>
reason. My dh thinks I&#39;m nuts. I can watch a Star Trek movie with him from <br/>
beginning to end and then look at him and say, &quot;What just happened?&quot; I really <br/>
have no clue. LOL!<br/>
