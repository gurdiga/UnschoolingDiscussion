<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719263323">Hi all-<br/>
OK, so for anyone who was at the conference, I was the wide-eyed, <br/>
neophyte woman from Canada who kept saying, &quot;But I&#39;m really <br/>
scared...&quot; I am somewhat less terrified these days (thanks to this <br/>
great site, etc) but my husband and youngest son go b-2-s tomorrow, <br/>
so the old panic is starting to rear its ugly schoolhead again. I <br/>
met so many wonderful people at the conference, and now I&#39;m really <br/>
lonely. I was wondering if any of you unschoolers would mind moving <br/>
to Canada? It&#39;s a bit chilly in the winter, but we don&#39;t have <br/>
hurricanes (OR REPUBLICANS)!! C&#39;mon - think about it! We make things <br/>
like bacon, and beer! We made Mike Meyers and Celine Dion! I have a <br/>
great husband and 3 beautiful boys. We have a non-shedding dog and a <br/>
pool. Let me know whatever else your hearts desire, and I&#39;ll see <br/>
what I can do to sweeten the pot (oh yeah, they grow that, too). <br/>
Hurry, though, cuz we are now down to one income so I don&#39;t know how <br/>
much longer we&#39;ll have the pool (the house may have to go, too).<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Sandy<br/>
BTW, Does anyone have Anne Ohman&#39;s e-mail? She was going to give it <br/>
to me in Boston...</div>

<br/>
In case anyone ever loses Anne, go to google to find her.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll find this, and you can click a link that opens an e-mail (and lots of <br/>
other Anne-stuff!):<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandy, where do you live? Dartmouth (Nova Scotia) and area has a strong <br/>
unschooling community. The Annapolis valley has a good group as well but <br/>
most of them are younger children. Lots of us are going camping this week <br/>
at Kejimikujik National park. It&#39;s like a mini unschooling conference in <br/>
the woods :-)<br/>
<br/>
But, shh, we had a wicked hurricane here last September.<br/>

Hey, and Beth and I are married up there!<br/>

If Massachusetts ends up repealing the same-sex marriage thing, or Bush  gets <br/>
his amendment through, Canada sounds awfully good.<br/>
