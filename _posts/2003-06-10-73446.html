<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763002613">I have a 10 yr old daughter (Caitlin) and an 8 yr old son (Kyle). We moved into this house mid-February and right from the beginning my kids knew who the bully was on the street. The other kids had warned my kids. The bully is named Elliot and he will be 13 next month. This kid is a walking hormone also. The first time I saw the intimidation going on I jumped in the middle of it and stopped it. But my husband said he thought Kyle was handling it and I shouldn&#39;t have intervened. So we had a talk with Kyle and he said he didn&#39;t want me to interfere anymore. So I have been respecting that request ever since. One of the things that has been bothering me though is that Elliot will tease, push, hit and take away toys from Kyle with me standing outside watching it all happen. I find this to be very disrespectful but Elliot does whatever he wants in front of whoever. Just to be clear, Kyle does know that if asks me for help I will help in heartbeat. It seems that this has come to a head for me today. Kyle was letting one of the other boys (Elliot&#39;s 10 yr old brother) play with one of his toy guns and Elliot took it away. Kyle asked for it back several times and was getting frustrated. I said to Elliot &quot; Kyle asked for his gun back, will you please give it back to him?&quot;  Elliot acted like he was going to give it back then switched it to his other hand to tease Kyle. He got in Kyle&#39;s face and said something to him. He then gave the gun back and pushed Kyle so Kyle hit him back. Elliot punched Kyle in the arm pretty hard and walked away. Kyle started saying &quot;I&#39;m not a baby&quot; and then started yelling &quot;I&#39;m not a baby&quot;(evidently that is what Elliot had said to Kyle).  Meanwhile, Elliot was across the street still mouthing &quot;baby&quot; at Kyle. Kyle got so angry and was loosing control of himself. He was screaming &quot;I&#39;m not a baby&quot; and then began to cry. I think sometimes Kyle scares himself when he gets past his boiling point so to speak. The teasing didn&#39;t stop. Elliot continued to mouth stuff at Kyle from across the street until Kyle went into the house.<br/>
<br/>
Just for background info, Elliot chases Caitlin around and won&#39;t quit when she tells him to. He pushes her and is way too rough with her and another girl on the street. He kisses at her. He asks for a hug all the time. She says she hates him and doesn&#39;t want to be around him. She tries to ignore him when all the kids are outside playing. Elliot picks on Kyle everyday that they are all outside playing. Kyle is afraid of Elliot. Kyle and I have talked about this situation many times. Kyle feels more confident when I am outside and he will defend himself more. But that only causes Elliot to hit Kyle harder or push him down.<br/>
<br/>
After discussing this all tonight, Kyle says that he wants me to intervene now. So I&#39;m wondering how I should handle it? I don&#39;t want whatever I do to cause Elliot to then sneak behind everyone&#39;s back to bully my son. Maybe that is inevitable, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You have quite a situation on your hands.  Since one child says she can&#39;t <br/>
stand this boy and doesn&#39;t want him around and your son has asked for help and <br/>
seems to be distressed about the situation I think, if it were me, I would tell <br/>
the boy that he is not welcome at my house or in my yard if he is going to act <br/>
that way.  Your children are being physically and emotionally hurt by this <br/>
older boy that they have no interest in playing with.  I would not even want him <br/>
around.  I wouldn&#39;t try to change his behavior.  He isn&#39;t a friend of your <br/>
children, he is a nuisance.  If he kept coming over hitting my children I would <br/>
go to his parents/sitter or whoever he is staying with and tell them to keep <br/>
their child away from your house and I would explain why.  <br/>
<br/>
It is good that your children can come to you to talk about things and know <br/>
that you will help.<br/>

<br/>
Have you talked to the boy&#39;s parents?<br/>
<br/>
I would respect my child&#39;s request about intervening in cases where I wan&#39;t <br/>
present, but as to what happens right in front of me, that is MY business, and <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have let things go where I could see it.  I think that&#39;s enabling <br/>
the bully entirely.   Largely because of school, I think, kids have a theory <br/>
among them that if a teacher sees you do something and then does nothing, that <br/>
what you did was acceptable.  They&#39;ll extend that to parents, too.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, he might he be sneaky and still be mean, but that&#39;s a step up from doing <br/>
it right in front of you.  <br/>
<br/>
I would call and make arrangements to talk to a police officer for advice on <br/>
what to do, and to register a formal complaint.  They could advise on <br/>
peacekeeping strategies, and on what the laws are about assault among kids.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t call them to come out, but IF you did in the future it might help to say &quot;We <br/>
called you in June 2003 for advice, and we took that advice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it were me (being me the way I am) I would probably summarize that in <br/>
writing to the parents, and send a copy (and clearly mark that on the letter) to <br/>
the nearest police station and ask them to keep it on file.   Whether they did <br/>
or not might not even matter if YOU keep copies to have in hand for future <br/>
incidents.<br/>
<br/>
The letter would be potentially useful if the kid took retribution by messing <br/>
with anything in your yard or house.   It would be a motive to point to if he <br/>
did any damage.  In a way it would be a magical circle that the neighbors <br/>
would be responsible for maintaining around your family and stuff too.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not explaining this clearly.<br/>
<br/>
We have neighbors behind us and to the corner that my kids really don&#39;t like. <br/>
 I&#39;m glad we&#39;re not facing on.  If those kids are in the park, my kids <br/>
usually make other plans.  They just do the regular pushy comment, ball snatching <br/>
stuff, but my kids don&#39;t have the school experience to KNOW it&#39;s &quot;normal.&quot;  If <br/>
they ever do it in front of me, though, I&#39;ll walk them home and talk to the <br/>
parents.<br/>

He would not EVER be welcome on my property if he was not willing to be kind.<br/>

I would threaten to call the police if the bullying didn&#39;t stop. He&#39;s WAY <br/>
over the line in my opinion. <br/>

I think it is inevitable. If it was me I would speak to the parents. I would <br/>
certinally if it continues tell them that you are going to contact the police. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
The boy is 13 it&#39;s only a couple years but there is a big difference in age. <br/>
As for the wanting to hug and kissing I would bring that up to the parents <br/>
also. I would make sure this boy is no where near your kids ever.<br/>
It does sound like he is way over the top. To tease your child right in front <br/>
of you is ball-zy and unacceptable. I would go right over or wait until he <br/>
does it again and walk right ahead of him to the parents. I do worry when we <br/>
have had situations like that if the child will get a spanking. Seems when I have <br/>
had to deal with kids like that I found that I regretted telling after I herd <br/>
the slaps walking away...I hope that&#39;s not what happens but it does need to <br/>
stop.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467005016">From: &quot;The Clifton&#39;s&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rpclif14@...">rpclif14@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;After discussing this all tonight, Kyle says that he wants me to intervene<br/>
now. So I&#39;m wondering how I should handle it? I don&#39;t want whatever I do to<br/>
cause Elliot to then sneak behind everyone&#39;s back to bully my son. Maybe<br/>
that is inevitable, I don&#39;t know.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First of all I want to say that I have stayed out of situations that my kids<br/>
told me they could handle. BUT, not when I was seeing it myself. When I&#39;m<br/>
there and I see something going on not tomy liking, I have stepped in. No<br/>
one is messing with my kids like that in a bad way.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m thinking what I might do. Thankfully I have never been in this<br/>
postion. I know I would definitely not allow this bully in my house or on my<br/>
property. I would try and get the kids with the other children they like,<br/>
into the house or on the property where they could enjoy each other and play<br/>
without fear. I would try and speak to the parents. Somehow I have a feeling<br/>
already that won&#39;t go anywhere. I may be wrong. But I would try. I would<br/>
also let this bully know I was watching him. I would let him know I wasnt&#39;<br/>
going to allow him to hurt my kids anymore. If this all somehow wasn&#39;t going<br/>
anywhere, I would contact the police. Not sure what exactly they can do, but<br/>
I would certainly ask for help.<br/>

<br/>
We had a boy like that in our neighborhood.   All the parents warned us<br/>
about him when he moved in across the street.  They knew him from school.<br/>
   <br/>
<br/>
When I saw the bullying for myself I told him he was only welcome to be<br/>
in our yard (on our stuff) and near Dylan if he could be nice.   I<br/>
defined nice for him in case he didn&#39;t have a good definition, and he<br/>
didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
What I later found out about his family was that he hadn&#39;t lived with is<br/>
parents much, but had been shipped around to different relatives, mainly<br/>
grandparents.   He was in special ed classes at school and knew the<br/>
teachers didn&#39;t like him.   His mother was terrible to him and would lock<br/>
him out of the house after school so he &quot;wouldn&#39;t eat everything&quot;.   She<br/>
yelled a lot and called him stupid.   Maybe the parents hit, I never saw,<br/>
but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. <br/>
<br/>
There was BAD family business at their house in April.   The parents were<br/>
fighting a lot and twice the younger boy came running to our house saying<br/>
they were trying to kill each other.   One night he came over and said<br/>
his mom was bleeding.    She had gone into the bathroom and come out with<br/>
a razor blade and slit her wrists in front of her family.   Her kids are<br/>
seven and twelve. <br/>
<br/>
The kids have been sent to live with the grandparents again. <br/>
<br/>
This ramble was meant to warn you that the reason the kid is a bully<br/>
might be the parents.   It may do you no good to talk with them. <br/>
<br/>
Try to talk to Elliot.   Tell him you&#39;re sorry if people have been mean<br/>
to him but you won&#39;t let him be mean to your kids.  That&#39;s it.  And tell<br/>
him what you&#39;ll do if he is.  Tell him you&#39;ll call the police.   Talk<br/>
with other parents on your street and form an alliance.   Let him know<br/>
every adult will be watching him and if he&#39;s mean to kids you&#39;ll find out<br/>
and take action.  You don&#39;t have to be menacing, just explain how it&#39;s<br/>
going to be and that he has the power to make it a nice, fun summer or a<br/>
yucky one. <br/>
That he does things right in front of you seems like action to get adult<br/>
attention to me.  He&#39;s probably starved.    If talking with him seems to<br/>
slow down or stop the bullying, and you&#39;ll maybe have to talk to him<br/>
every day, then try demonstrating kindness to him.  It might help.  He<br/>
might not be getting any at home. <br/>
<br/>
You have to keep your kids safe.  He won&#39;t stop if he thinks no one cares<br/>
or no one WILL stop him.  Make sure he knows you will. <br/>
This worked for us with our bully.   I actually liked the poor kid and<br/>
I&#39;m sorry he was shipped away.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sad for you because it can be really painful getting a glimpse into<br/>
the life of a desperate kid like this.   <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s better, if you suspect the parents are mean or crazy.<br/>
Talking directly to him could work, potentially, if he&#39;s susceptible to <br/>
attention or reason or threat.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Sounds true of some kids I&#39;ve known.  I know one guy (now in his 30s) who <br/>
gets meaner with more attention.  It&#39;s bizarre.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He won&#39;t stop if he thinks no one cares<br/>
or no one WILL stop him. &gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618291510">I am FUMING on this one!  I would make it a point to be near my child and <br/>
PHYSICALLY intervene if this bully threathened to physically harm my child (even <br/>
an unwanted touch).  I certainly hope that your daughter is not being coerced <br/>
into actually giving that boy hugs!  I would have taken the toy from the bully <br/>
without a word but with tangible attitude.  I would then have told the bully <br/>
to stay away from my kids, and my yard.  If need be, I would also call the <br/>
police and make a report.  I understand that children need to learn to deal with <br/>
the world... but we don&#39;t throw a child just learning to swim into a raging <br/>
river.  I have absolutely no respect for bullies (this kid sounds like a full <br/>
blown tyrant) and don&#39;t feel that it is my job to reform them.  My job is to <br/>
raise my child in a safe environment. <br/>
<br/>
Now that the immediate situation is over and the above is water under the <br/>
bridge, I would tell my children that they are not allowed to even speak with <br/>
this boy.  Not because my kids are &quot;not allowed&quot;, but because I can&#39;t really tell <br/>
someone elses kid what they can or can&#39;t do, but I can tell my kids that they <br/>
have a &quot;rule&quot;  (what a novelty in my home... and amazing how well they &quot;like&quot; <br/>
rules that are &quot;for&quot; them).  The next time the kid comes by, have your kids <br/>
tell the bully that they are not allowed to play with him.  And when the bully <br/>
comes and tries to stay anyway  (gee, has this actually happened to me?... <br/>
ummm... yes...), I would (already being the protective mother bear and seeing it <br/>
as it happens) tell the kid to get lost myself.  If he refuses, I would ask <br/>
the kid for his phone number and tell him I am calling his parents to come get <br/>
him, or tell him I will call the police to have him removed from my property.  <br/>
If he still stays, I would then proceed to call his parents and/or the police. <br/>
 (I actually walked across the street and told the kids mom that my child is <br/>
not allowed to play with her kids and to please make sure they stay out of my <br/>
yard ... the parents are actually nice enough people).<br/>
<br/>
I also feel that tho your kids may feel somewhat embarrassed by being <br/>
&quot;protected&quot;, I am rather certain that most (if not all) of the other victims will be <br/>
silently (if not shouting it right outloud) applauding and rooting for you and <br/>
your kids.  In addition, I think that once you put your foot down and make it <br/>
clear that you will not tolerate your children being bullied, it will <br/>
diminish, tho perhaps not disappear entirely.  I would tell my child to simply ignore <br/>
whatever is said... what kind of credibilty does one accord a bully anyway?  <br/>
I would also convey to my child that it is more than ok for a parent to <br/>
protect a child... in my opinion, thats part of what we&#39;re here for!  I would also <br/>
let my child know that this bully has his own issues and that he is using <br/>
calling my child a &quot;baby&quot; as a tool to empower himself.  Thus keeping my child in <br/>
the position of being a victim rather than calling for (or just accepting) the <br/>
help my child needs to defend himself.  I would also make it clear that my <br/>
child is, in fact, not a &quot;baby&quot;, that sometimes third parties need to step in to <br/>
halt abuse. (extreme example - would you let someone, regardless of age, wave <br/>
a gun around at an adult without calling the police?  Would that adult then be <br/>
a baby because help was called in and used?). <br/>
<br/>
just my two cents based on my personal experience...<br/>
(use what you can, disregard the rest..)<br/>
other experiences may vary &lt;g&gt;<br/>
all the best...<br/>

<br/>
That information can be conveyed in a compassionate way.<br/>
<br/>
If the dealings are overkill, that&#39;s just counter-bullying.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen that in families used to moving around a lot, but I&#39;m NOT used to <br/>
moving, and there&#39;s a difference in how people need to act if then intend to be <br/>
in a neighborhood for twenty or forty years.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I would also make it clear that my child is, in fact, not a &quot;baby&quot;, that <br/>

<br/>
You can state something and it still won&#39;t be made clear.<br/>
He didn&#39;t THINK she was a baby, he said it for meanness.<br/>
<br/>
I agree about the stepping in to halt abuse.<br/>

You&#39;re going to be able to stand down a bully with that introversion thang <br/>
going?<br/>
<br/>
Marty just got back from the park.  Bully kids were there and there were <br/>
non-verbal incidents.  This could turn into a visit to the parents.  I would take <br/>
my husband.  This is a physical family.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You&#39;re going to be able to stand down a bully with that introversion thang<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know that you&#39;re kidding here.  But just for the record, I&#39;m an introvert.<br/>
I&#39;m also outspoken, and can be forceful and witchy when necessary.  I&#39;ve<br/>
been accused of being other things, too, but I&#39;ll quit there.<br/>
<br/>
My understanding is that Introverts draw their strength from within and need<br/>
quiet time to &quot;recharge&quot;.  Extroverts draw their strength from people and<br/>
need people around to keep from going nutty.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is quiet, soft-spoken, and a good listener.  You&#39;d never notice<br/>
him in a crowd of people.  But he&#39;ll spend hour after hour after hour<br/>
talking to people about their problems, listening to extended discussions,<br/>
looking for people to talk to.  He was absolutely lost during the three<br/>
months he spent at home when Tim was 2 and I was working.  You can find me<br/>
in a crowd easily, but only if I&#39;m there.  I don&#39;t last long in large<br/>
groups.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Deb, this is great advice.  I would bet too, that talking to his parents <br/>
won&#39;t do any good, and may make things worse.  Still, I feel the parents still <br/>
need to be warned in some or another, of the problems.  Sounds corny, but I would <br/>
suggest doing something like taking a loaf of homemade bread over, or a batch <br/>
of cookies, introducing yourself, trying to at least appear friendly.  Let <br/>
the kid see you really do care and you&#39;re not like everyone else that will just <br/>
rant and rave to his parents about what he&#39;s doing... <br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of letting the kid know, in a very nice way, that you see he <br/>
is hurting or that there may be some problems in his life, but that taking it <br/>
out on younger kids won&#39;t help.  Let him know you care enough to CALL the <br/>
police should you see him endangering himself or another kid.  Don&#39;t want him to <br/>
end up in trouble and you will intervene if you see him begin to go too far. <br/>
<br/>
And the best part, giving him a choice...really cool, fun summer or a really <br/>
miserable yucky one.  All up to him, his choice.  This has worked wonders with <br/>
our adoptive son who was totally out of control when we got him.  Kids who <br/>
are abused or neglected feel the need to control others.  Letting him decide how <br/>
his summer will end up puts the ball in his court...he can blame no one <br/>
should he screw up.  <br/>

Domestic Violence incidents where the police would go out, no one would want to <br/>
press charges, but the police themselves wanted a record that &quot;such and such&quot; <br/>
happened at this address on this date.  Then if something major happens, and the <br/>
abuser says, &quot;It&#39;s the first time anything like this has ever happened!&quot; they <br/>
can refer back to that address or name on the computer and all the past <br/>
incidents, no matter how small, will pop back up.<br/>

&gt; push him down.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OMG Dina!!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be getting to this post so late, but I was ready to puke reading <br/>
this. (Put aside that I am able to puke pretty readily all the time, LOL) This <br/>
kind of thing is not what I would classify as typical school type behavior, by <br/>
any means. Sure boys of that age tease girls, but to be bold enough to touch <br/>
her when she has told him to back off? And to do any of these things in front of <br/>
you? Sorry but they&#39;d be scraping his a$$ off the pavement if it involved one <br/>
of my daughters. And that would be after I was done with him. I don&#39;t even <br/>
want to contemplate what my DH would to to him and his parents.<br/>
<br/>
Of course my first feeling when talking about the gun part with Kyle is that <br/>
perhaps Elliott just craves attention and doesn&#39;t care how or who he gets it <br/>
from as long as he gets it, but when the touching your daughter inappropriately <br/>
and then actually hitting your son?  All feeling went out the window for this <br/>
future criminal. I wouldn&#39;t start with the parents though. I&#39;d start with <br/>
him. Lay it all on the line. Tell Elliott you have already contacted the police <br/>
dept and they are aware of his behavior and will not hesitate to haul his butt <br/>
in if he touches any other kid on the block. I say that because he will be on <br/>
guard then that you are not only looking out for your kids, but for the <br/>
neighborhood as a whole. Then I&#39;d tell him he should warn his parents about my <br/>
discussion with the police, so that should he screw up, they won&#39;t be shocked at <br/>
his arrest. And if his parents have issue with what I&#39;ve done, they can feel <br/>
free to come chat about it. Chances are he won&#39;t tell them and even if he did, <br/>
they wont seek you out. If they should seek you out, by all means do it on your <br/>
territory, not theirs. That way when the conversation is over for you, you can <br/>
shut your door.<br/>
<br/>
Bullies suck, but allowing someone to bully makes everyone involved losers. <br/>
Victims of bullies usually stay victims, bullies depend and crave the power <br/>
they get from bullying and anyone who allows it to happen, is helping to create <br/>
an unsafe world for us all. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you are doing Dina, I <br/>
believe you really want to do whats best for everyone involved, but there are <br/>
times we can&#39;t save everyone, but we should always try to save our own.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nancy<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes Nancy, I fully agree with you on all the above. However, my stance on <br/>
calling the boy on the carpet is mostly in reference to his physical assaults on <br/>
her children, not childhoood bickering. The thing is, most bullies will, once <br/>
they have been put on notice, simply move on to some other child to hold power <br/>
over and victimize. <br/>
<br/>
I definately think she should file at least incident reports. The sad thing <br/>
is, people see that as taking time away from law enforcement, should parents <br/>
start calling everytime a kid acts out inappropriately. But without such <br/>
documentation, should said bully actually hurt any child, there is no proof to fall <br/>
back on. And although the police may very well be low on man-power, not our <br/>
problem. To protect and to serve....well these kids need protection from this <br/>
future criminal. Yes, that is the second time I have referred to him as that, <br/>
because as sad as it is, that&#39;s the road he is headed down. And how would Dina <br/>
feel if she didn&#39;t call him on it and the next time around he truly hurts her <br/>
children. I don&#39;t even want to think about sexual assault, but again, he has <br/>
displayed these kind of tendencies and without recourse he will simply continue <br/>
without fear of retribution.<br/>
<br/>
As far as laying it on the line, do you think this bully will attempt to <br/>
&quot;test&quot; Dina? He very well may, in which case, Dina needs to have contacted the <br/>
police and have begun to document such aggression. But I still doubt he would <br/>
try, especially after being told he better forewarn his parents. By telling the <br/>
kid himself to warn his parents, you put the ball back in his court, thereby <br/>
not risking him being possibly abused by his parents if they are told directly <br/>
by another parent. He&#39;ll know what to do, if he tells them, then abuse may not <br/>
be what was this kids problem. If he DOES NOT tell them then perhaps he is <br/>
being hurt by someone and putting him on notice will be enough, because he fears <br/>
the possibility that his parents may find out via law enforment.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t feel sorry for this kid in some respects, I&#39;m sure his <br/>
little soul is crying out for help. By the same token though, I&#39;d never let <br/>
any other kid be the sacrificial lamb because it is feared that he may be <br/>
abused. Perhaps putting the childrens play on video everytime they go out would <br/>
help. These things are all a pain in the hiney, but I&#39;d rather be put out a little <br/>
than to allow this little rat to intimidate anyone any longer. At least then <br/>
you could have physical proof that he is harassing and harming your kids. <br/>
Perhaps that would be enough for a restraining order.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; I definately think she should file at least incident reports. The sad <br/>
thing <br/>
is, people see that as taking time away from law enforcement, should parents <br/>
start calling everytime a kid acts out inappropriately. But without such <br/>
documentation, should said bully actually hurt any child, there is no proof <br/>
to fall <br/>
back on.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
True, but don&#39;t expect the police to be able to come up with that stuff <br/>
later.  Keep copies all together. It&#39;s enough to show you reported it before, and <br/>
when.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not only that, you will usually have to pay for copies of reports.  AND, <br/>
depending on who is involved, you may have to wait for it to be mailed to you.  <br/>
When I worked in records, the people had to come in, pay for the copy, fill out <br/>
the paperwork to get a copy, then the copy had to be sent to them.  Copies <br/>
have to have the victim&#39;s/suspect&#39;s phone numbers, addresses, etc blocked out, <br/>
and anything else that may &quot;infringe&quot; on someone&#39;s privacy.  <br/>
