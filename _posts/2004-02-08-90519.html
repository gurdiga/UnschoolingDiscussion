<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484217436"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So - if you want to talk about what&#39;s going on and why TV appears to be<br/>
&gt;such a problem in your family - we can do that, but I&#39;ll leave it alone<br/>
&gt;for now except to say that maybe your focus is too much on the<br/>
&gt;tv/problem. For example, did YOU go outside and enjoy yourself - maybe<br/>
&gt;make hot chocolate and cookies and have a picnic in the gorgeous<br/>
&gt;outdoors? Or did you just keep thinking that they &quot;should&quot; look outside<br/>
&gt;and want to go out?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I first joined this list I made the comment that I didn&#39;t feel like I<br/>
was ready to unschool because I had a new baby (or at that point was<br/>
exhausted from expecting one) and didn&#39;t feel like I could provide enough<br/>
stimuli.  Sandra and other said, &quot;Just do it, don&#39;t bitch about it.&quot;  -grin-<br/>
<br/>
And, to a large extent they were right.  The real issues of unschooling<br/>
didn&#39;t need to wait and we dropped the bullshit and just started living our<br/>
lives.  We are much happier, my eldest son is now reading by his choice (and<br/>
well) and the middle one is counting up a storm, etc.  All is well and I<br/>
daily see signs that this was SOOOO the right way to go.<br/>
<br/>
But, I do see that to a much lesser extent I was right.  For a million<br/>
reasons, some of which are just the details of having very small children<br/>
and some of which are my own issues I am just not doing as good a job with<br/>
the &quot;strewing&quot; as I&#39;d like.  And I&#39;m finding that instead of living my life<br/>
and letting that be an example, I&#39;m just frustrated at trying to balance<br/>
getting anything done and still involving kids who are interested.<br/>
<br/>
For example--I&#39;m not the kind of person who has patience to let a 2.5 year<br/>
old help with the dishes.  On a REALLY good day, I can.  But usually I just<br/>
want to get them done.  So instead of letting him help, not caring when they<br/>
get done or if we get interrupted by the infant----I crab at him.<br/>
<br/>
Reading this list and talking to a friend who unschools really help by<br/>
reminding me that I need to make that shift.  And slowly, I am, some days.<br/>
But it&#39;s hard to get past that notion that I need to get the dishes done so<br/>
we can do something &quot;real&quot; and would he just go watch TV until I&#39;m done.<br/>
<br/>
And as I sit here and read that it is so farging SAD.<br/>

the TV, but it seems to me the key is whether we&#39;re together and wanting to be <br/>
with each other, doing whatever we&#39;re doing together. <br/>
<br/>
       If you do, it&#39;s great no matter what it is and if you don&#39;t, it can&#39;t <br/>
be great no matter what it is. <br/>
<br/>
       The kids and I saw a woman with six toddlers in tow at the public <br/>
library Friday. It was raining hard, and I figured she couldn&#39;t take them all out <br/>
in it by herself (there were strollers and gear all piled up inside the front <br/>
door.) Well, none of them were being handled very well inside either. They <br/>
might have been better off playing in the rain! She had them all lined up sitting <br/>
on the floor with their backs against the check-out desk counter, and she was <br/>
daring them to move and get a time-out. They were having a great time taking <br/>
off their shoes and tossing them away, and then running after them, giggling <br/>
gleefully. She was telling them in a big voice about how &quot;angry&quot; she was that <br/>
they weren&#39;t &quot;listening&quot; and then complaining into her CELLPHONE about how <br/>
harried she was, and snatching them back by their little arms (I almost went over <br/>
at that) to shove them back in the row she was guarding.<br/>
<br/>
       Their party got louder and wilder until finally a sheriff came over <br/>
and interested them in his uniform for a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
       I figured she was a paid daycare provider but my 14-year-old assumed <br/>
they were septuplets, or siblings with a couple of playmates -- anyway, that <br/>
the woman was Mom and not paid caregiver.  I was assuming that no Mom would ever <br/>
have decided to take them all to the library in a thunderstorm in the first <br/>
place on a Friday afternoon, in all those separate strollers, at least not <br/>
without a carefully calibrated battalion of helpers! &lt;g&gt; And if she had, and <br/>
gotten stuck there, she&#39;d have been reading to them to keep them entertained.<br/>
<br/>
       We never did find out what the real story was, but we wound up having <br/>
an interesting discussion about it, so that was a good thing and relevant to <br/>
OUR unschooling for that reason alone. We went on from there to get the <br/>
LooneyTunes DVDs, in the rainstorm, because it was something else we chose to do <br/>
because of a current interest. <br/>
<br/>
       My reason for telling the story here, now, is that both the library <br/>
and the cartoons for TV were part of our fun together (we left dishes in the <br/>
sink btw &lt;eg&gt;) because we were together doing what we wanted to do together. <br/>
OTOH, there was no way those little ones were having a good experience even though <br/>
they were &quot;at the library&quot; and their probably-conscientious parents were doin<br/>
g what society expected, paying some preschool caregiver to provide them with <br/>
not just care but stimulating educational experiences -- and it turned out to <br/>
be not only NOT enriching or educational, but borderline dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
      So I am thinking that whether it&#39;s the library and books, or tv and <br/>
videogames -- it can&#39;t be wrong if you really enjoy it together and it can&#39;t be <br/>
made right if you just don&#39;t.  JJ<br/>

<br/>
Just wanted to repeat that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our culture&#39;s book worship is a serious blockade for a lot of potential <br/>
unschoolers.   Books were both a goal and an avoidance tactic for people who were <br/>
good, verbal, literate students, and so they read books for rewards, and the <br/>
rewarded themselves with books (or risked trouble to read under the desk).  I <br/>
was one of those kids myself.<br/>
<br/>
My husband reads fantasy novels.  When he reads, he is not being with the <br/>
rest of us.  When he&#39;s through, we don&#39;t share that book.  Nobody else is <br/>
interested in the kind of stuff he&#39;s reading.  So his book reading is an isolating <br/>
thing.  Not a sin, just not a shared family activity.   But when we&#39;ve all <br/>
watched the same movie, that can be shared.  We don&#39;t even have to watch it at the <br/>
same time. &lt;g&gt;   The discussions are as good as discussions about books.  And <br/>
lately Holly has talked me into reading two novels she didn&#39;t feel quite up to <br/>
so that I could answer her questions about details in the movies:  The Green <br/>
Mile, and What&#39;s Eating Gilbert Grape.   I don&#39;t mind being Holly&#39;s research <br/>
assistant. &lt;g&gt;  She doesn&#39;t want them read aloud to her, though I&#39;ve read <br/>
passages from both.  She just wants me to know enough that I can answer her <br/>
questions.  No problem.<br/>
<br/>
I watch 24 with Kirby.  That&#39;s a shared experience.  It&#39;s too tense for my <br/>
tastes,  but I want to  continue to watch with Kirby, and we&#39;ve talked about how <br/>
they build the tension with camera shots and music and darkness. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I really, really understand this.  I have five children and have often felt <br/>
that it is too hard to have them directly around me all the time...especially <br/>
when they were toddlers.  Sometimes I just wanted to get something done and <br/>
think my own thoughts uninterrupted while doing it.  I often thought I couldn&#39;t <br/>
be an unschooler because I had too many children, and I tend to be rather <br/>
introverted.  I just didn&#39;t feel that I would give each of my children enough <br/>
attention if I didn&#39;t schedule it.<br/>
<br/>
I think the thing that really changed my mind was becoming a single parent.  <br/>
Now I had even less time, and I realized that I didn&#39;t want to spend that time <br/>
forcing my kids to do things they didn&#39;t really want to do.  This is what got <br/>
me to *let go* of the academics.  Even if I am not the best *strewer*, my <br/>
kids still do better than they did when we were just relaxed homeschoolers.  They <br/>
are more whole, and I think about them more.  I think of them as individuals <br/>
instead of as students in my homeschool class.  <br/>
<br/>
This list taught me about respectful parenting and that resulted in me making <br/>
the shift in regard to bedtimes, meals, and chores.  I still struggle with <br/>
living peacefully with 5 other people (my children) in a small apartment when I <br/>
have a definite need for *alone* time.  It really helps me to think of my <br/>
children as *people* instead of *my children*.  It also helps if I continuously <br/>
choose to trust them instead of control them.  <br/>
<br/>
Today I took my 6yo, Lia, to the mall for her birthday.  I didn&#39;t force her <br/>
to hold my hand.  I basically let her do what she wanted to and trusted her to <br/>
behave appropriately instead of trying to force her to conform to my <br/>
standards.  I truly listened to her, and we had a great time!  In the past, I have had <br/>
some horrible times at the mall with Lia...full of struggle, disagreements, <br/>
and tears.  It was wonderful to see her maturity today and to realize what a <br/>
wonderful person she is!<br/>

not about that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more a matter of &quot;let me get this work done so I can come over and play<br/>

maybe I&#39;ll have to do them again.  Because it&#39;s more important to have that<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some ideas that have helped me:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Make a sign and post it above the sink.  Maybe it will say, &quot;Watch the <br/>
bubbles&quot; -- as in, look at the bubbles, look at how the light hits them.  Put <br/>
&quot;too much&quot; liquid soap in so you can have lots of lather.  Look at your child&#39;s <br/>
hands, in among those mountains of bubbles, tiny and yet capable.  Maybe your <br/>
sign will say, &quot;Feel the warmth,&quot; -- meaning the warm water and the warm tone <br/>
in your child&#39;s voice.  <br/>
<br/>
The bubbles and the warm feel of the water are what I like about washing <br/>
dishes.  I replace the water often because I like the fresh water with a mountain <br/>
of bubbles on top. <br/>
<br/>
The point here is to find what you like about it, what your senses enjoy <br/>
about it, and write down a reminder.  Focus on getting your senses involved so <br/>
that the &quot;nagging&quot; part of your mind can relax and be quiet.<br/>
<br/>
2.  If you&#39;re not in the mood to do that, get a a separate dish tub or let <br/>
your child use a different sink.  Lay a towel on the floor if it&#39;s going to get <br/>
messy.  Give her (him?  sorry, I don&#39;t remember) the unbreakable things, the <br/>
non-sharp silverware, and let your child go at it.  If the tub is on the floor <br/>
near you while you wash, you can talk while you both work.  Or put on some <br/>
music that you can both work to.<br/>
<br/>
I realize these may not work for your situation, but if they do, great!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Amy<br/>

special things into it and bring it out only when you really want to <br/>
get some work done. Be creative - make it relevant to what you&#39;re doing <br/>
if you think that&#39;ll work. I did dishes while Rosie and I listened to <br/>
books on tape - but I think she was older than your little one. She&#39;d <br/>
bring a little kid chair into the kitchen and sit right under my feet <br/>
(we have a tiny kitchen) and that was a little annoyance but I just got <br/>
used to that and it became our habit to listen to books while I cleaned <br/>
the kitchen. Later, when she was just started reading, she&#39;d read out <br/>
loud to me while I did dishes.<br/>
<br/>
When my sisters and I were little we had a chalkboard at the end of the <br/>
kitchen and my mom would divide it into sections and draw different <br/>
&quot;squiggles&quot; in each section and we&#39;d try to make a pictures out of <br/>
them.  We did this while she ironed and cleaned. We also used to play <br/>
with playdough while she worked in the kitchen. And listen to the radio <br/>
- and of course I&#39;m old enough that the radio was  dramas then - &quot;The <br/>
Shadow&quot; etc.<br/>
