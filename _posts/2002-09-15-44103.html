<div id="ygrps-yiv-795843817">***I see your point, but no.  I really don&#39;t think my kids would like<br/>
coffee, or whole cow&#39;s milk, or white bread, etc. (just examples that I<br/>
can think of off the top of my head).***<br/>
<br/>
One of my sons *loves* coffee with lots of whole milk and sugar.  And they all love white bread, preferably with turkey or something in the middle or made into french toast.<br/>
<br/>
***Why would they like them?  I<br/>
don&#39;t.***<br/>
<br/>
You honestly don&#39;t think your children will like something just because *you* don&#39;t?  All three of my children like apples, and I can&#39;t stand them!  I&#39;m allergic, actually.  <br/>
<br/>
***And, chances are, without<br/>
social forces to help them like bad things, they probably never will***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think my kids like the things they like because of &quot;social forces,&quot; I think they like the things they like because they think they taste good.<br/>
<br/>
They think white bread and whole milk taste good, and they also think that carrots, broccoli, and watermelon taste good.  They manage to achieve a balance all on their own.<br/>
