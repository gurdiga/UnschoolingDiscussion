<div id="ygrps-yiv-605652656">I woke up this morning to find that the tv in the playroom died. Just like that. Fine last night, dead today with only sound. Alyssa wanted to watch Scooby Doo. I sent her into Tara&#39;s room to watch it. I solemnly went into Sierra&#39;s room where her and Joseph were playing to give them the bad news. I was rather upset. Makes things very difficult not having a tv in the playroom. I gave them the bad news and they both looked at me like I was from Mars. They said they both new about it when they turned it on this morning. Went back to what they were doing and I haven&#39;t heard the first word about what&#39;s wrong with it or when it will be fixed. Alyssa watched about 20 minutes of Scooby and left Tara&#39;s room to play. <br/>
<br/>
If I limited to 1 hour a day, (or 2 or 3) there is no doubt in my mind that they would be very upset now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471915695">Our tv just did the same thing, it was a blown fuse. About 2.50 at Radio Shack for 4 of them. If you take the back off your tv there should be a list of the parts, and you can pick up a replacement part. Just read carefully, the whole paper, we got the fuses put them in and they just kept popping, read a little further down, in the notes section and found out we have to order the fuse from the company, so into the shop the tv goes. :-P, <br/>

Thanks Rebecca. I&#39;ll have Joe check. Of course we already have a brand new<br/>
tv sitting in there but it helps before we ditch the old one!!<br/>
