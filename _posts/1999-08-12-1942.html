&gt; Subject:       Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] was gifted kids, Now: glad to be average<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I find it hard to believe that anyone is really &quot;average&quot; anyway. =<br/>
&gt; Y&#39;know, What IS average, and who says so?<br/>
&gt;  My problem with &quot;gifted&quot; and other such labels, is simply that all<br/>
&gt;  kids =<br/>
&gt; should be able to access gifted assignments and try them continually<br/>
&gt; = -not just those who have had access to them before.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>   i think everyone is &quot;gifted&quot; in some way, not just intelligence <br/>
and is part of what keeps the world of people in balance. i <br/>
see a gift as having excess of something that others don&#39;t typically <br/>
have in the same quantity.  <br/>
i&#39;ve seen people who can add numbers incredibly in their heads but <br/>
can&#39;t balance their own checkbook!<br/>
some are gifted with patience beyond belief.<br/>
some are gifted with a big heart<br/>
some are gifted with drive and persistance that keeps everyone else <br/>
around them going and not willing to give up.<br/>
some are gifted with incredible energy to get things done. <br/>
and so on.<br/>
<br/>
If these sort of gifts were available in a big store to go in and <br/>
choose what we want for ourselves or our kids, I would find it <br/>
interesting to know what gift everyone would choose.<br/>
<br/>
As for myself, i would choose the gift of &quot;common sense&quot; for me or <br/>
anyone i hold dear to me.  Because with common sense, any other <br/>
&quot;gifts&quot; that are handed to them will fall into place naturally. <br/>

This is so true ... because life goes beyond just school and &quot;intelligence&quot; <br/>
doesn&#39;t it?  And I, personally, find that some of the gifts that you&#39;ve <br/>
mentioned above are far more important to find in people than the &quot;schoolish <br/>
gifts&quot; that teachers are always looking for.<br/>

I should&#39;ve added to my last post that one of my problems with IS is that <br/>
nothing matters in their lives except learning x facts, or getting an x <br/>
grade....life is so much more....Schools are so insulated and confining they <br/>
can&#39;t conceive of  any other way to live...like they&#39;ve been in the dark so <br/>
long that when/if they ever see the light, they&#39;ll still be blind for awhile. <br/>
 Why not just live in the light NOW???<br/>

the person doesn&#39;t know how to use them to give something back to the <br/>
world.  then what good is it?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  anymore, it takes A LOT of courage just to walk out our front doors <br/>
and face such a judgemental society!  but seriously...   courage is <br/>
so important but rarely thought about - courage to be different, <br/>
courage to try again when we fail, courage to speak for what we <br/>
believe in, courage to stand up for someone else that might be weaker <br/>
than us even at the risk that others may change their opinion about <br/>
us......<br/>
<br/>
