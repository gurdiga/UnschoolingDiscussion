<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609560983">&quot; I am truly<br/>
considering unschooling for the rest of his highschool years, but i<br/>
am concerned about his lack of motivation. He is interested in<br/>
video games and yugioh trading cards and tv. He only has 2 come to<br/>
the house friends and never goes to their house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
sounds like he has plenty of motivation...just not in the things you<br/>
might want him to have. That&#39;s the most important part of unschooling,<br/>
not only tolerating their interests (which it sounds like you do) but<br/>
appreciating them fully and seeing them as absolutely valid and worthy<br/>
all on their own.<br/>
<br/>
School causes lack of motivation  in a lot of ways...he&#39;s had enough<br/>
squashing it sounds like, and you have a chance to give him back his<br/>
life. Forcing someone to do work they don&#39;t see as meaningful or show<br/>
interest in is the BEST way to kill motivation for life.<br/>
<br/>
Let him do the things he loves, treat the next few months like summer<br/>
vacation (to help yourself deschool) so there isn&#39;t any pressure to<br/>
perform. There is no &quot;only&quot;, they are his interests and they count big<br/>
time!:)<br/>
