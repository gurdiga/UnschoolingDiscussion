<div id="ygrps-yiv-339164828">The new issue of Life Learning Magazine came out today, and I&#39;ve only  gotten <br/>
to the letters section.  Danielle Conger got a good mention, but  from <br/>
someone cranky about other stuff.  The good mention was this:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;I received a copy of your March/April issue today and read it with  <br/>
interest, as we are unschooelrs.  I particularly ejoyed Danielle Conger&#39;s  &quot;An <br/>
Unschooling Landscape.&quot;  Unfortunately, I then stumbled  across...&quot;   [and she goes <br/>
off about things that weren&#39;t clearly  proven, as the editor and author both <br/>
came back in defense.  It was a  threat not to subscribe.]<br/>
 <br/>
But that&#39;s not what I came here to say.  There was something about  chores <br/>
last time, not by any of us here who are so frequently on about not  requiring <br/>
chores, but by Naomi Aldort.  There are two very negative  responses and one <br/>
pro to that.<br/>
 <br/>
What strikes me is that the two lengthy harangues have those emotional  <br/>
phrases that people repeat because they heard them.  What seems to have  upset the <br/>
authors is that the advice has upset the grandmothers that dwell  inside of <br/>
them.  They&#39;re hosts to nay-saying negative inside-people whom  they&#39;re quoting <br/>
like crazy in their letters to the editor.<br/>
 <br/>
What&#39;s worse is one is anonymous.  If I were a magazine editor I would  never <br/>
allow anonymous letters.  If people are too cowardly to use their  names, why <br/>
should they get an international forum for their negativity?<br/>
 <br/>
One thing the anonymous person said was &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if you like it  or <br/>
not, it just has to be done.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m going to add that to my &quot;have to&quot; page, I think.  If it weren&#39;t  that <br/>
there&#39;s an interview with me in the next issue, I think I&#39;d write an  article on <br/>
choice and not having to do things right now, while the adrenaline is  upon me.<br/>

<br/>
Write it now!  You can always write it, then sit on it for a week or two before deciding whether to send it.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a letter to the editor of Life Learning concerning the essay &quot;Dyslexia - a gift?&quot;.  It turns out it was meant as a book review, rather than an essay or article.  Maybe that was obvious to other readers, but it wasn&#39;t to me.  The editor did respond to me persoanlly, and we had a couple emails back and forth about my concern.  That was nice.  But it struck me how that is a weakness of magazines VS email lists and boards.  The discussion was between only two people.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned so much from reading conversations here.  I like the way a question or a sharing of an unschooling day can lead to an ongoing conversation.  A magazine is pretty much read once, then maybe there is a response or two  in the next issue.  It seems to end there.<br/>
<br/>
For better or worse, I am currently subscribed to both Life Learning and Live Free Learn Free and have not renewed my subscription to Home Education Magazine.  I LOVED the May/June issue of Live Free Learn Free. &quot;What I Have Learned on This Journey by Connie Colten&quot; was very inspiring and addressed many things that I&#39;ve thought about.  I especially enjoyed the compilation of stories on children learning to read.  I plan to pass this copy on to my mother, who is concerned about my 9 1/2 year old not yet reading independently.  I even read a couple of the quotes to my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I did enjoy Naomi Aldort&#39;s thought on chores in the last Life Learning.  I still struggle in that area, as my house is not as tidy as I think it &quot;SHOULD&quot; be.<br/>

 <br/>
Sometimes people will write to me privately and want unschooling help, and  I <br/>
never want to do that anymore.  It seems like a waste of the energy, to  <br/>
write to just one person alone, when it could be out in public for LOTS of  people <br/>
to use and tweak and improve on and think about.<br/>

<br/>
Jan Fortune-Wood&#39;s article was wonderful to me, as the mom of two boys<br/>
on the autistic spectrum, and really affirming that this is exactly<br/>
what my boys really need.  &quot;It also means that we will take into<br/>
account problems that are not solely about psychology, but also about<br/>
structures and social contexts. We have the flexibility to fit the<br/>
learning environment to the individual rather than struggling<br/>
to do the opposite.&quot;   Of course, I spend a lot of time hanging out on<br/>
Anne Ohman&#39;s Shine list, so maybe my paradigm has shifted already.<br/>
<br/>
Naomi Aldort&#39;s article was also a reaffirmation of everything I&#39;ve<br/>
heard on this list so many times.  The first few times I heard it, my<br/>
reaction was the same as the ones who wrote those knee-jerk letters. <br/>
It has taken a while to realize that everything I ever thought about<br/>
parenting in general would need to be re-examined with an unschooly<br/>
heart.  And even longer not to feel threatened by that.<br/>

&quot;Lots of people make this point, but I never see the negation as<br/>
negative in a value-judgment sense when I use the word--to me<br/>
unschooling is as positive as unchaining, unbinding, unleashing,<br/>
unfolding, unfurling, unlimiting....All mean freedom and growth and<br/>
vast possibilities to me.&quot; ~ Suzanne Carter</div>

Gosh, I bet that would be a great article. Why not write it while you are<br/>
inspired and keep it until the next right publishing opportunity arises?<br/>
