  It&#39;s better than nice! You might be interested in this column:<br/>

  &gt;It&#39;s not just the weather that&#39;s cooler in Canada<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Wednesday, July 30, 2003<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;You live next door to a clean-cut, quiet guy. He never plays loud music or <br/>
  &gt;throws raucous parties. He doesn&#39;t gossip over the fence, just smiles <br/>
  &gt;politely and offers you some tomatoes. His lawn is cared-for, his house is <br/>
  &gt;neat as a pin and you get the feeling he doesn&#39;t always lock his front <br/>
  &gt;door. He wears Dockers. You hardly know he&#39;s there.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;And then one day you discover that he has pot in his basement, spends his <br/>
  &gt;weekends at peace marches and that guy you&#39;ve seen mowing the yard is his <br/>
  &gt;spouse.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Allow me to introduce Canada.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;The Canadians are so quiet that you may have forgotten they&#39;re up there, <br/>
  &gt;but they&#39;ve been busy doing some surprising things. It&#39;s like discovering <br/>
  &gt;that the mice you are dimly aware of in your attic have been building an <br/>
  &gt;espresso machine.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Did you realize, for example, that our reliable little tag-along brother <br/>
  &gt;never joined the Coalition of the Willing? Canada wasn&#39;t willing, as it <br/>
  &gt;turns out, to join the fun in Iraq. I can only assume American diner menus <br/>
  &gt;weren&#39;t angrily changed to include &quot;freedom bacon,&quot; because nobody here <br/>
  &gt;eats the stuff anyway.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;And then there&#39;s the wild drug situation: Canadian doctors are authorized <br/>
  &gt;to dispense medical marijuana. Parliament is considering legislation that <br/>
  &gt;would not exactly legalize marijuana possession, as you may have heard, <br/>
  &gt;but would reduce the penalty for possession of under 15 grams to a fine, <br/>
  &gt;like a speeding ticket. This is to allow law enforcement to concentrate <br/>
  &gt;resources on traffickers; if your garden is full of wasps, it&#39;s smarter to <br/>
  &gt;go for the nest rather than trying to swat every individual bug. Or, in <br/>
  &gt;the United States, bong.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Now, here&#39;s the part that I, as an American, can&#39;t understand. These poor <br/>
  &gt;benighted pinkos are doing everything wrong. They have a drug problem: <br/>
  &gt;Marijuana offenses have doubled since 1991. And Canada has strict gun <br/>
  &gt;control laws, which means that the criminals must all be heavily armed, <br/>
  &gt;the law-abiding civilians helpless and the government on the verge of a <br/>
  &gt;massive confiscation campaign. (The laws have been in place since the <br/>
  &gt;&#39;70s, but I&#39;m sure the government will get around to the confiscation <br/>
  &gt;eventually.) They don&#39;t even have a death penalty!<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;And yet ... nationally, overall crime in Canada has been declining since <br/>
  &gt;1991. Violent crimes fell 13 percent in 2002. Of course, there are still <br/>
  &gt;crimes committed with guns -- brought in from the United States, which has <br/>
  &gt;become the major illegal weapons supplier for all of North America -- but <br/>
  &gt;my theory is that the surge in pot-smoking has rendered most criminals too <br/>
  &gt;relaxed to commit violent crimes. They&#39;re probably more focused on <br/>
  &gt;shoplifting boxes of Ho-Hos from convenience stores.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;And then there&#39;s the most reckless move of all: Just last month, Canada <br/>
  &gt;decided to allow and recognize same-sex marriages. Merciful moose, what <br/>
  &gt;can they be thinking? Will there be married Mounties (they always get <br/>
  &gt;their man!)? Dudley Do-Right was sweet on Nell, not Mel! We must be the <br/>
  &gt;only ones who really care about families. Not enough to make sure they all <br/>
  &gt;have health insurance, of course, but more than those libertines up north.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;This sort of behavior is a clear and present danger to all our stereotypes <br/>
  &gt;about Canada. It&#39;s supposed to be a cold, wholesome country of polite, <br/>
  &gt;beer-drinking hockey players, not founded by freedom-fighters in a bloody <br/>
  &gt;revolution but quietly assembled by loyalists and royalists more <br/>
  &gt;interested in order and good government than liberty and independence.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;But if we are the rugged individualists, why do we spend so much of our <br/>
  &gt;time trying to get everyone to march in lockstep? And if Canadians are so <br/>
  &gt;reserved and moderate, why are they so progressive about letting people do <br/>
  &gt;what they want to?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Canadians are, as a nation, less religious than we are, according to <br/>
  &gt;polls. As a result, Canada&#39;s government isn&#39;t influenced by large, <br/>
  &gt;well-organized religious groups and thus has more in common with those of <br/>
  &gt;Scandinavia than those of the United States, or, say, Iran.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Canada signed the Kyoto global warming treaty, lets 19-year-olds drink, <br/>
  &gt;has more of its population living in urban areas and accepts more <br/>
  &gt;immigrants per capita than the United States.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;These are all things we&#39;ve been told will wreck our society. But I guess <br/>
  &gt;Canadians are different, because theirs seems oddly sound.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Like teenagers, we fiercely idolize individual freedom but really demand <br/>
  &gt;that everyone be the same. But the Canadians seem more adult -- more <br/>
  &gt;secure. They aren&#39;t afraid of foreigners. They aren&#39;t afraid of <br/>
  &gt;homosexuality. Most of all, they&#39;re not afraid of each other.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;I wonder if America will ever be that cool.<br/>
