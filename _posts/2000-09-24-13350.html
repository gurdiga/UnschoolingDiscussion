<div id="ygrps-yiv-641157689">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little behind on my digests, but wanted to say WOW! What a<br/>
response to my question! Very interesting what you&#39;all have to say - and<br/>
so informative to hear of your experiences. <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to add that in my reading, I have learned that with the<br/>
chicken pox vaccine, you only get partial immunity for a few years (10,<br/>
I think it was) - but if you get the disease naturally, you have<br/>
complete lifetime immunity. And yes, the older you are when you get the<br/>
pox, the worse it is... can be deadly in some cases!<br/>
<br/>
I got it when I was in 2nd grade, I remember it well but it was no huge<br/>
deal. I was miserably itchy for a week, then took an additional week off<br/>
school just to make sure. I worry about my boyfriend though, he&#39;s never<br/>
had it and he&#39;s 29... we might decide to get HIM vaccinated, but I&#39;d<br/>
rather my daughter get the pox naturally, and have lifetime immunity. <br/>
<br/>
Back to reading...<br/>
