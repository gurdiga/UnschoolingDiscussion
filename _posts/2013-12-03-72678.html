It&#39;s not undermining it&#39;s just acknowledging that the other parent isn&#39;t in the creative space to say yes for some reason. That&#39;s ok that happens. &nbsp;It&#39;s usually a sign that &quot;no saying&quot; parent has some unmet needs so it&#39;s a flag for quiet time or a bit of parental autonomy or attention from the spouse or the need for a walk, or to go for a run or to have some conversation or better organisation or....... so many possibilities that will make it easier for the parent to be more creative next time.</p><p style="background-color:transparent;"><br></p><p style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-style:normal;">There will be times when it&#39;s easier for him to say &quot;yes&quot; than it is for you, in those moments ask him for help, or acknowledge that he&#39;s managed it when you couldn&#39;t see the way.&nbsp;</p><p style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-style:normal;">Elizabeth</p></div></div></span></blockquote></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750638544"><html><head></head>I like what Elizabeth wrote. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>This proved true at our house, after just a few early years in which I got it and Keith wasn&#39;t understanding completely. &nbsp;&quot;<span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">There will be times when it&#39;s easier for him to say &quot;yes&quot; than it is for you, in those moments ask him for help, or acknowledge that he&#39;s managed it when you couldn&#39;t see the way. &quot;</span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></div><div><font face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">Lots of times when the dad *does* get it, he has a big leap of understanding and passes the mom.</span></font></div><div><font face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">But I do want to say that the mom shouldn&#39;t move into unschooing if the dad is unwilling, because that can contribute to unhappiness that can lead to divorce. &nbsp; A peaceful, intact family is more valuable to a child than unschooling is, and divorce often leads to no family and no unschooling, so pushing husbands isn&#39;t good for the chidlren, overall.</span></font></div><div><font face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">Sandra</span></font></div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642856804"><p>Sometimes when my husband has given an unthinking no, or said something that could dampen the kids&#39; excitement, I can sweeten it by adding and explanation or something kind, so I&#39;m not over riding his &#39;no&#39;, just lifting the atmosphere and that works much better than when I used to feel tense or upset about his words (then all 5 of us would be tense and it wasn&#39;t peaceful at all).</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">For example the other night the 5 of us went for a walk on our property.

It&#39;ll be much easier to get back across the creek while its still light like this. I wonder if we&#39;ll get back to the house before its completely dark or if the light will be gone first...&#39; and then it was fun to go back and race the light and we all walked home happily.</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">I find too that if I can remember to do something like that instead of argue the kids&#39; case, he starts to do it as well, sometimes he will say no and then rephrase it himself, or even rethink sometimes.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068938622"><div dir="ltr"><div>Annie&#39;s story is beautiful and inspiring like many I&#39;ve read here.<br><br>I made an unexpected, but incredibly helpful, discovery when I made a conscious effort to sweeten the situation rather than contradict my husband on behalf of our kids. I needed to listen carefully, to really hear him, in order to come up with effective ways to help our kids understand their dad&#39;s requests (which often sounded more like demands). <br>
<br>I needed to listen carefully and really hear my husband. <br><br>Sounds pretty obvious, but it was radically eye-opening. It was self-evident to me that I needed to pay attention to our kids, to understand their interests and to accommodate them, and facilitate for them as best I could. But I began family life not realizing that my husband, although an adult, needed accommodating too. I&#39;m quite certain that what I continue to learn via unschooling is responsible for the strong marriage we have. As I learn to listen, my husband becomes more and more open to hearing our kids and me as well. A win-win all around.<br>
