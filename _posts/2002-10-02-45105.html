<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652497230">&lt;&lt;Not the breed but the psycho part&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is funny because I love her to death but she has a tendency to bark at<br/>
particular places in the floor where nothing can be detected by humans, she<br/>
tends to forget that her brother is &quot;pack leader&quot;, she went through a period<br/>
where she thought I was  going to take her food away and would growl at me.<br/>
But most of the time she is fine.<br/>
<br/>
Our 4-H group is doing a dog training project this year and is bringing in a<br/>
professional trainer to work with the kids.  I hope it helps.<br/>
