&lt;&lt; my husband, who&#39;s a really staunch supporter <br/>

<br/>
carron, this is enviable...  i wish i could have that to support me in my <br/>
doubts.  i am sure you are feeling appreciative of him, right?  :)   my <br/>
unschooling support consists of this list and other things i read.  so i <br/>
appreciate your responding to my post!!  <br/>
<br/>
it wasnt just a frustrating day, i get this way occasionally, am i the only <br/>
one?  especially when the school year begins and my dd wants &quot;homework&quot; and <br/>
everyone else has such a neat &quot;plan.&quot;<br/>
  <br/>
i appreciated these words especially...<br/>
&lt;&lt;He also reminds me that unschooling is more than just letting children <br/>
learn <br/>
at their own pace.  Children must also be allowed to learn what they need <br/>
when they need it.  It is conceivable that some children may never actually <br/>
learn math beyond how to operate a calculator.  If they don&#39;t need math, why <br/>
bother with it? &gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-812977818">ty olivia.  nice to know someone empathized with my decidedly on-topic post! <br/>
haha!  some topics are more interesting than others...  do you have have <br/>
unschooling support where you live or a pro-unschooling spouse?  tonite at <br/>
dinner, i heard dh make some comments that could be construed as supportive <br/>
of unschooling!  i was delighted, but acted calm!  :)  i still get somewhat <br/>
uncomfortable at trying to explain/defend our unschooling to anyone, esp <br/>
other homeschoolers...   <br/>
my dd(10.11) is has just begun taking a history class once a wk w/other <br/>
hmschoolers and it is much too schooly (style) for my taste.  but she is so <br/>
thrilled with being assigned homework, presentations, etc.  she is extremely <br/>
motivated, taking it all very seriously, and says, &quot;mom!  now i&#39;ll finally <br/>
get to use those homework tips i read about it my american girl magazine!&quot;  <br/>
LOL!  it is so funny to watch her... the novelty of it all, having been <br/>
unschooled her whole life-- it is &quot;fun&quot; to her, so far...<br/>
