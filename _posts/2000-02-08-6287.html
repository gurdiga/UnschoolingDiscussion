<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462262847"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are there any Pagan families on this list?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nanci K.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry for my ignorance, but does &quot;pagan&quot; refer to a specific belief system<br/>
or religion, or does it just mean &quot;non-Christian&quot;  ?<br/>
<br/>
Our family is sort of a non-religous mix of spirituality.  As in we believe<br/>
in and teach our children about the force of God, good or just the force<br/>
(may the force be with you...)  We shy away from being too preachy or<br/>
formal, though, prefering to keep all discussions about God or Spirit open<br/>
ended and inquiring.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure weather this qualify us as pagan...</div>
