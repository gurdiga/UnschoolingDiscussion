Time for a confession of sorts.<br/>
I&#39;ve always believed that there were better methods than spanking, BUT, I had <br/>
this really lame ass idea that we could come up with a &quot;consequences&quot; chart <br/>
to help the kids.<br/>
Oh yes, this was before unschooling was the norm here...but it was really, <br/>
really awful.<br/>
If you didn&#39;t do a chore, you got an extra one.<br/>
If you lied, you had 15 minutes of &quot;labor&quot; (raking or something physical <br/>
outside)<br/>
It went on like this, listing possible offenses and what the consequence (ie: <br/>
punishment) would be.<br/>
I had forgotten all about it until cleaning out paperwork a few weeks ago. I <br/>
was horrified and shocked at myself. The list had been a reaction to <br/>
difficulties that were mainly brought on by dh and I.<br/>
It lasted a very short time thankfully...but I had forgotten what a lame Mom <br/>
I was. I&#39;d like to forget again. :)<br/>
