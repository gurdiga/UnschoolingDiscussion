<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496593224">I have a question about the Sims... my daughter (age 11) has been <br/>
into Roller Coaster Tycoon, and her cousin (age 13) said she should <br/>
try the Sims because it&#39;s great and it&#39;s kind of the same premise.  <br/>
So I finally bought it a couple weeks ago and brought it home, only <br/>
to discover it had a rating of &quot;T&quot; for Teen, which the box says is <br/>
rated that for animated sexual situations.<br/>
<br/>
I went onto a computer software review site to find out why the <br/>
rating, and they said basically if you flirt a lot it could lead to <br/>
such things, but if you stay away from flirting, then it&#39;s &quot;safe&quot; for <br/>
younger kids.<br/>
<br/>
Do you &quot;Sims Experts&quot; agree?  Did you find anything objectionable in <br/>
the software?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
