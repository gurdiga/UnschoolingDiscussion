excerpt&nbsp;from an email just received from a high-school teacher friend of 
mine:</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">. . . I&#39;ve been busy cheating to help my students 
get through very nasty ( and unimportant) state assessments ... I call it 
parallel review...If the question is going to be: You have three ducks and you 
get two more ducks, how many ya got? ... then the day before we practice: You 
have three geese and you get two more geese ... also make charts with notes on 
them and accidentally leave them on the bulletin boards ... thank goodness the 
administration is on my side ... or it would be even harder to do!<br><br>But 
it&#39;s all quite stressful ... one week left of it ... the object is to get them 
through with their self esteem intact ... let them do whatever the f--- they 
want for a month and a half,&nbsp; fake their report cards so that they tell the 
truth, and then go to Summerhill for July ...<br></font></div>
