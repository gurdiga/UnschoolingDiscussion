<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429980849">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When I divorced my husband of 27 years a few years<br/>
back, my daughter refused to spend the night at my<br/>
house, and my youngest son was at both houses about <br/>
1/2 the nights.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, the judge ruled that schooling has nothing<br/>
to do with anything (this was about time spent with<br/>
parents - seems where they sleep is the main point) <br/>
since all kids school (my lawyer wrote this moving<br/>
paper about my parenting style, which NO ONE read),<br/>
and after being a stay at home mom with a small <br/>
homebased business (re-usuable cloth nursing pads) I<br/>
had to pay my husband child support!!  At least the<br/>
kids weren&#39;t required to go to school (OVER MY DEAD<br/>
BODY that would have been).  Life can be amazing<br/>
sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Connie&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is amazing that the judge would rule like that. <br/>
I was so lucky in my first divorce that my husband and<br/>
I were able to be so fair with each other.  Nobody<br/>
could believe it.  We had married at 17 and had been<br/>
married almost 17 years and it wasn&#39;t easy on either<br/>
of us to divorce but we wanted to keep things as easy<br/>
as we could.  We did a do-it-yourself divorce for $75<br/>
and I let him have the house and basically everything<br/>
in it, traded our weekends with the kids when we<br/>
needed to...  The judge sure seemed to have not seen<br/>
such an easy divorce.  Of course, we weren&#39;t<br/>
homeschooling...<br/>
<br/>
I know things would be very different with my now<br/>
husband though and I bend over backwards to keep<br/>
things peaceful.  When we had a big fight last fall he<br/>
took off without even saying goodbye to the kids and<br/>
when he got back to Seattle he emailed me telling me<br/>
that our marriage was over and that he was going to<br/>
give Boeing 2 weeks notice and then he was going to<br/>
&quot;disappear&quot;.  He said he would rather do that than<br/>
&quot;live in a cardboard box and pay all his money to me<br/>
for child support and alimony&quot;.  Give me a break!!  He<br/>
knows very well how easy my other divorce was and how<br/>
fair of a person I am.  His note sounded enough like<br/>
he might be thinking of suicide that I jumped in the<br/>
car and drove the 3 hrs to Seattle to rescue the<br/>
situation.  He definitely needs to grow up.  I would<br/>
never put money over the safety and happiness of my<br/>
kids.  Is that just a mother thing??<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not even a mother thing.<br/>
If it were, why would so many babies be in daycare and nursery schools?<br/>
