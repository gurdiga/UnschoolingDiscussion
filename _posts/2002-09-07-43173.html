<div id="ygrps-yiv-543930650">I saw a post this afternoon and thought I would try to answer it (maybe ask <br/>
for clarification first) but now it&#39;s not in my new mail.   I can&#39;t bear the <br/>
thought of going through the old mail or deleted mail (which will be gone <br/>
tomorrow) because I was at a local conference today and am going back <br/>
tomorrow and I&#39;m tired.<br/>
<br/>
A question was addressed to me by name, and it was something about Kirby <br/>
potentially hitting Marty, if I handled things as I was claiming to, and what <br/>
would come of it.  (I&#39;m not quoting, just trying to give enough to identify <br/>
it.)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows which one and could repost it I&#39;d appreciate it.  OR if one <br/>
of you asked it and you could rephrase it more clearly or cancel the request <br/>
if it&#39;s already been covered by today&#39;s chit chat, I&#39;d appreciate it.<br/>

So what would you do if Kirby would be physical, like just one smack and the <br/>
other wouldn&#39;t leave the room? Then it would happen again and again, not on <br/>
a daily basis but to see that the younger one would get hit before getting a <br/>
chance to leave and the older one didn&#39;t get keeping his hands to himself?? <br/>
I know you&#39;re not saying this happened, I&#39;m just asking what you think you <br/>
would have done if it did?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for re-posting that.<br/>
<br/>
Now I might need the clarification! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think what it means is if the pattern repeated and it involved physical <br/>
attack, what would I do?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it did.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Marty would be not taking care of video equipment and kirby would <br/>
lunge at him and grab him by shoulders and be yelling, or he would have <br/>
backhanded him on the arm in the process of taking a controller away from <br/>
him.  Kirby&#39;s worst time was when he was 12, and we all would shake our heads <br/>
and take deep breaths and just hope he would grow out of it, which he did, <br/>
beautifully.<br/>
<br/>
BUT when it was still in the awful period, I would get Marty out of Kirby&#39;s <br/>
room and let him vent and tell me his side.  While that was happening, Marty <br/>
was feeling comforted and Kirby was calming down, straightening up his stuff, <br/>
thinking bad thoughts about Marty or whatever, but his adrenaline was going <br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d find something Marty could be involved with, whether actually needed or <br/>
something he had wanted to do but forgotten, or whether it was a kinda <br/>
trumped up &quot;Could you take the dog out to play?&quot; or &quot;Could you water the back <br/>
yard a bit?&quot;  Something good, useful and distracting for Marty that made him <br/>
feel important.<br/>
<br/>
Then I would go back to Kirby&#39;s room and say &quot;Marty needs to be safe in his <br/>
own home, y&#39;know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And he would say &quot;My stuff needs to be safe ind.  Sometimes Marty had just <br/>
left out one important detail (the reason Kirby got angry, usually &lt;g&gt;).  <br/>
Sometimes it was misinterpretation.  I&#39;d ask Kirby what could have gone <br/>
better.  I would remind Kirby of the process:  First talk.  Second get an <br/>
adult to help.  THIRD hit.  I would not go with &quot;Never, never hit,&quot; because <br/>
if someone grabs these kids against their will, I want them to hit with <br/>
feeling.  If someone&#39;s hurting their sister or stealing their gameboy, <br/>
hitting&#39;s okay with me.  But I would go with his having hit without getting <br/>
assistance FIRST.  It was a technicality which had some benefits, one of them <br/>
being the kids&#39; hope that maybe if an adult failed to negotiate the problem <br/>
they had plan C--hitting.  I just made sure I never once failed to negotiate <br/>
successfully.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d help Kirby process what happened, thank him for whatever he HAD done <br/>
right and good (sharing his room and stuff in the first place, being willing <br/>
to discuss it, calming down), and ask him again to try to be more patient and <br/>
to get help sooner next time.<br/>
<br/>
Then I&#39;d go BACK to Marty and say, &quot;So...  You didn&#39;t tell me you called him <br/>
a butt.&quot;  (Or whatever it was...)<br/>
<br/>
But by then Marty would be all calmed down too, and feeling better about <br/>
himself.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that answers the question or not, and I&#39;m not positive I <br/>
understand the question.  IF the question is suggesting that something I was <br/>
doing would encourage hitting and cause it to be habitual, I can&#39;t see how it <br/>
would (and it didn&#39;t).  <br/>

<br/>
Sandra, my question was in no way meant to reflect on anything you <br/>
did with your kids. I was asking on behalf of myself and my kids.<br/>
My son is rather an old soul and so very different from our other 3. <br/>
Much more complex. He just doesn&#39;t get keeping his hands to himself <br/>
with his sister. I also don&#39;t go with the never hit thing and have <br/>
explained that whole scenario. He gets that, he understands that it&#39;s <br/>
not nice to hit or even productive within the family. But when his <br/>
sister frustrates him, like I know she&#39;s good at doing, he just <br/>
smacks her without thinking. He knows he shouldn&#39;t, he admits to me <br/>
that he did it and why. I just can&#39;t seem to get him to come to me or <br/>
say something to her first. His first reaction is to pop her one. Now <br/>
it&#39;s not really bad. He doesn&#39;t use anything but his hand and it&#39;s <br/>
not a punch or anything and she gets very dramatic when he does it. <br/>
The whole thing ends up a major deal on both parts. Whatever I&#39;ve <br/>
been saying isn&#39;t getting it.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t happen every day but enough for me to worry why I can&#39;t <br/>
solve this. You can tell right away he&#39;s sorry he does it but just <br/>
doesn&#39;t think about it first. We&#39;ve worked out together all kinds of <br/>
other ways for him to solve the problem but when the time comes, he <br/>
doesn&#39;t use any of them. These are the 2 that are 13 months apart. <br/>
They are almost 7 and 8. She&#39;s the younger one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104218280">Mary,  I don&#39;t know if any one has responded to this, because I&#39;m a bit behind on e-mails, but I know my 9 and 7 yr olds do this also.  What I feel has helped is sitting down with them one on one and really discussing what they are feeling.  My daughter is the one that hits (she&#39;s almost 8) and she is so embarrased by it but says she can&#39;t stop it.  So we&#39;ve been talking alot about how upset her 9 yr old brother is making her. I in turn then talk with my son also,  he has no idea that he is upsetting her so much.  We really had a good talk last night,  I  told her about myself, being a little sister and how my brother used to make me feel bad.  Trying to enlighten her on the fact that he&#39;s not intentionally trying to hurt her.  I think Sandra and others have some really good points about giving respect to our children.  Talk with them, like we would want to be talked to.  Explaining things can do wonders, all we need to do is take a little time and it makes such a big difference in their lives!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451376331">I just remembered something I dide with Kirby some and Marty LOTS... and that <br/>
is to sit in a rocking chair or some other quiet, comfortable, <br/>
private-to-the-two place, and we would fantasize about how it would be <br/>
different if he had been the only child.  We&#39;d go through the good stuff, and <br/>
then some of the not-perfect stuff, but it would be calming to both of us.  <br/>
And I would say it&#39;s nice sometimes to think about other possibilities, and <br/>
that I would love him just as much either way, but if he was the only one I <br/>
would probably be more protective and afraid, and he would be lonelier and <br/>
probably get tired of me easier.   And we would just rock and touch, and let <br/>
those ideas about being together LOTS more just wash over us.  <br/>
<br/>
And I think the reminder that I loved him so much that I would be VERY happy <br/>
if he was my only child made him more compassionate toward me, himself, and <br/>
the next younger (whether Marty or Holly).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you Kelli. I appreciate the response.<br/>
<br/>
With my son, as sounds like yours also, he really seems like he doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to do it. He never lies about it and his response as to why is usually, <br/>
&quot;because she&#39;s bothering me.&quot; We do talk about this without her being around <br/>
and we come up with all kinds of things for him to do next time. Like going <br/>
in his room, getting me, telling her that she knows what will happen if she <br/>
doesn&#39;t stop. But again when the time comes, none of that happens.<br/>
<br/>
With her, she does push his buttons. Of course he is quite capable of doing <br/>
the same to her but she doesn&#39;t usually react with hitting, she just yells <br/>
and calls for me. It seems like she does it (bugs him) on purpose and many <br/>
times I do hear him warning her but by the time I get there, it&#39;s too late. <br/>
When I talk to her about why she does what she does, she says she doesn&#39;t <br/>
know why and if I try harder to understand, she cries. She&#39;s a big cryer and <br/>
when asked for anything that she doesn&#39;t want to give an answer to, she <br/>
cries.<br/>
<br/>
I know I should probably concentrate more on why she does it but I can&#39;t <br/>
seem to get anywhere with her.<br/>
<br/>
On a good note, it has been at least a week since a hitting episode <br/>
happened. Maybe it&#39;s a stage??<br/>

Hi, Mary --<br/>
<br/>
You definitely have my sympathy on this.  I only have one child, so he&#39;s<br/>
clearly not pulling this just to gain advantage over a sibling, but he&#39;s<br/>
all tears and no talk when he is upset.  Rational discussion just can&#39;t<br/>
happen, which frustrates me.  The old standbys, waiting and hugging,<br/>
work a little.  But not as much as I&#39;d like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-501250748">It could be a stage thatgoes away with Maturity, It could be just a step on<br/>
the way to less control and more hitting.<br/>
Here is what goes through my head.<br/>
Don&#39;t leave them alone together. Ever. They obviously need your help getting<br/>
along. Until they can start talking through their differences, make sure<br/>
they have their own space, maybe their rooms, where the other is not to<br/>
enter without permission. If your neighbor was hitting you, would you keep<br/>
letting her come in your house? I think it is very important to number one,<br/>
keep them safe. Hitting is not safe, it&#39;s abuse. Even if the one doing so is<br/>
8. stop the situation, remove the offender from the situation, talk to the<br/>
hitee, and later go back and talk with the hitter. A dangerous person must<br/>
be removed from the area.<br/>
 I really like Sandra&#39;s idea about talking to each of them about life<br/>
without siblings The good parts and the lonely parts.<br/>
Institute a date night with your DH and each child. At our house on Fridays,<br/>
(we alternate weeks) each parent takes one child out, to a movie, for ice<br/>
cream whatever is in your budget. Focus some time exclusively on the<br/>
individual, just having fun, talking BEing together. I think alot of sibling<br/>
rivalry (at least here) comes from jealousy of Mom or Dad&#39;s attention to the<br/>
other.<br/>
