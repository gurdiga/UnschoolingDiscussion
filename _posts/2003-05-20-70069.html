<div id="ygrps-yiv-894113974">This is from another list! Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the only difference is how things are worded.<br/>
<br/>
A woman named Emily, renewing her driver&#39;s license at the County <br/>
Clerk&#39;s<br/>
office, was asked by the woman recorder to state her occupation.<br/>
<br/>
She hesitated, uncertain how to classify herself. &quot;What I mean is,&quot;<br/>
explained the recorder, &quot;do you have a job, or are you just a .....?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Of course I have a job,&quot; snapped Emily. &quot;I&#39;m a mother.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t list &#39;mother&#39; as an occupation...&#39;housewife&#39; covers it,&quot; <br/>
said <br/>
the<br/>
recorder emphatically.<br/>
<br/>
I forgot all about her story until one day I found myself in the same<br/>
situation, this time at our own Town Hall. The Clerk was obviously a <br/>
career<br/>
woman, poised, efficient &possessed of a high sounding title like, <br/>
&quot;Official<br/>
Interrogator&quot; or &quot;Town Registrar.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What is your occupation?&quot; she probed.<br/>
<br/>
What made me say it, I do not know. The words simply popped <br/>
out. &quot;I&#39;m a<br/>
Research Associate in the field of Child Development and Human <br/>
Relations.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The clerk paused, ball-point pen frozen in midair &looked up as <br/>
though <br/>
she<br/>
had not heard right. I repeated the title slowly, emphasizing the <br/>
most<br/>
significant words. Then I stared with wonder as my pronouncement was <br/>
written<br/>
in bold, black ink on the official questionnaire.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Might I ask,&quot; said the clerk with new interest, &quot;just what you do <br/>
your<br/>
field?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Coolly, without any trace of fluster in my voice, I heard myself <br/>
reply, <br/>
&quot;I<br/>
have a continuing program of research, in the laboratory &in<br/>
the field. I&#39;m working for my Masters &already have 4 credits (all<br/>
daughters). Of course, the job is one of the most demanding in the<br/>
humanities, (any mother care to disagree?) &I often work 14 hours a <br/>
day. But<br/>
the job is more challenging than most run-of-the-mill<br/>
careers &the rewards are more of a satisfaction rather than just <br/>
money.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There was an increasing note of respect in the clerk&#39;s voice as she<br/>
completed the form, stood up &personally ushered me to the door.<br/>
<br/>
As I drove into our driveway, buoyed up by my glamorous new career, <br/>
I <br/>
was<br/>
greeted by my lab assistants - ages 13, 7 &3. Upstairs I<br/>
could hear our new experimental model, (a 6 month old baby), in the <br/>
child<br/>
development program, testing out a new vocal pattern.<br/>
<br/>
I felt triumphant! I had scored a beat on bureaucracy &I had gone on <br/>
the<br/>
official records as someone more distinguished & indispensable to <br/>
mankind<br/>
than &quot;just another mother.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Motherhood.....What a glorious career! Especially when there&#39;s a <br/>
title <br/>
on<br/>
the door.<br/>
<br/>
Does this make grandmothers &quot;Senior Research Associates in the field <br/>
of<br/>
Child Development &Human Relations&quot; &great grandmothers<br/>
Executive Senior Research Associates&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I think so!!! I also think it makes aunts &quot;Associate Research <br/>
Assistants.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Please send this to another mother, grandmother, aunt & other <br/>
friends <br/>
you<br/>
know! They will be delighted with their &quot;new&quot; position in<br/>
life!</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Definitely not that way here. Lots of concerned and involved dads around,<br/>
even outside of the homeschooling group. That&#39;s one of the first things we<br/>
noticed when looking for a house here, we saw lots of dads at the park with<br/>
kids. And in our homeschool group there are usually dads at events. My kids<br/>
are on first-name basis with several other dads, and my DH regularly watches<br/>
other mom&#39;s kids if they&#39;re over and I go off to do something. I like the<br/>
fact that there is a lot of trust of the dads in our group and that they are<br/>
often with the kids.<br/>
