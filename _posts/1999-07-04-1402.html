<br/>
Dyslexia and dysgraphia is an important issue with me.  My 15 year old is <br/>
dyslexic.  She turned a 3rd grade reading level of reading (tested at the end <br/>
of 6th grade before we pulled her out) into a 10th grade reading level the <br/>
following year after a year of homeschooling (and unschooling as it turned <br/>
out).  She read a book which did not fit into the curriculum at school and <br/>
decided to turn it into a movie script.  She spent the year typing more than <br/>
80 pages (single spaced) of dialogue.  At the end of the year, she had <br/>
learned vocabulary, spelling, keyboarding, grammar, reading, etc.  I think <br/>
that the testing (computer software) and the 30 pages of the script (20 pages <br/>
from the front and 10 from the back) helped support our contention that she <br/>
was learning.  (This is what VA requires.)  In essence, we selected the <br/>
portfolio method of reporting for that year.  It was her most dramatic year <br/>
and it was clear that there was learning. <br/>
<br/>
Now, after 4 years (10th grade) she is at a much higher level and the change <br/>
is not as dramatic.  Last year, VA had a problem with her learning level <br/>
because there wasn&#39;t as much documentation.  They cited &quot;Standards of <br/>
Learning&quot;.  This year, she has been working on stories.  I&#39;ll have more <br/>
documentation but not exactly what they want (essays of comparison about <br/>
books concerning our multi-cultural world).  While she is well versed in <br/>
knowledge about our multi-cultural world, she hasn&#39;t exactly read lots of <br/>
literature about it.  I&#39;m hoping there isn&#39;t any problem but I am a little <br/>
concerned.  <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Christine, I have lots of information about dyslexia and teaching reading <br/>
(without frustration) if you need it.  I have given workshops on it based on <br/>
my experience (i.e., I&#39;m not a &quot;trained&quot; LD teacher).  By the way did you <br/>
know that dyslexics have compensating gifts.  They can be excellent <br/>
architects, mathematicians, engineers and computer technicians.  Dyslexics <br/>
apparently use both parts of their brain more equally than &quot;normal&quot; people.  <br/>
(Normals use one side more than the other.)  Dyslexics have a way of seeing <br/>
things that others do not.  Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci are suspected of <br/>
having been dyslexic.  Whoopi Goldberg, Tom Cruise, Nelson Rockefeller, and <br/>
Charles Schwab  are dyslexic.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464383876">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not dyslexic, and admit to knowing next-to-nothing about the condition..  but<br/>
I thought I&#39;d toss a comment into the mix:<br/>
<br/>
I was just reading an interesting article in the current (July 1999) issue of<br/>
National Geographic, that discussed various things about color, sight, etc....<br/>
the article mentioned that tinted lenses may be of help to people with dyslexia.<br/>

Thankyou so much for the information, however my son is opposite eye <br/>
dominant, not dyslexic.  At first I did not understand the difference but <br/>
it lies more in the visual processing (letters and numbers are seen as they <br/>
should be but reversed as he tries to put them to paper) of information <br/>
versus language processing.  They also suspect he has an auditory <br/>
processing problem.  I suspect it doesn&#39;t matter and he will learn on his <br/>
own, in his own time, in his own way.<br/>
<br/>
Again if anyone out there lives in NY, I would appreciate any advice you <br/>
can offer on writing the IHIP-<br/>
<br/>
