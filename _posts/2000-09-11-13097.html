<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938589815">I think it&#39;s a generalization to say that unschooled or homeschooled kids <br/>
play well with others of all ages. No doubt some do. But my son&#39;s good <br/>
friend, who is 7 like my son (and also unschooled), is an only child and  <br/>
has no tolerance for my younger son, who is 3. He thinks the toddler is <br/>
disgusting because he is messy and wears diapers. He has no patience for the <br/>
3yo&#39;s slower and more clumsy play. He won&#39;t play with him and sort of leads <br/>
my older son to shun the younger or play away from him. He suggests board <br/>
games and other activities that a 3yo can&#39;t do.<br/>
<br/>
This friend plays well with my older one and is generally well-behaved. He <br/>
is precocious and sort of like a &quot;little adult,&quot; so he likes being around <br/>
grownups and can have an amazingly reasoned chat with adults. And he does <br/>
like kids who are not his age. But only if they are _older_.<br/>

discussions about esoteric things with a six year old, that she considered<br/>

Either way, I think I&#39;m just stuck being wierd!  :)<br/>
