<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152833020"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: Kelly Ferry &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kpacklight@...">kpacklight@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; Subject: Re: getting over fears<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m amazed that after a solid 15 years of working on myself and<br/>
&gt; letting go of the disappointment and unhappiness of my childhood, that<br/>
&gt; so many of these old things have risen up again. I should know better.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Kelly --<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve been getting such good feedback on this, I didn&#39;t think I had much to<br/>
add to it, but this passage triggered a thought.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, good for you to have spent so much productive time working on<br/>
your issues.  I can really relate to how hard and time-consuming and<br/>
long-term a process it is.<br/>
<br/>
Something that I found in my own process, however, was that my kids<br/>
triggered mini-crises for me at different stages in their development.  I<br/>
finally figured out that I was coming face to face with some of my old<br/>
demons as they reached certain ages and situations in their lives.  These<br/>
demons just had never come up for me before, despite all the work I&#39;d been<br/>
doing, because nothing had triggered them.  For instance, when my firstborn<br/>
hit adolescence, I ended up having to work afresh on some of my own<br/>
sexuality issues.  I couldn&#39;t deal with her angst until I&#39;d confronted my<br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering whether part of your emotional reaction to this part of your<br/>
son&#39;s life might be related to this.  Is there something that he is facing<br/>
right now, or some way that he is reacting to his circumstances, that<br/>
reminds you of a place you have been yourself, and could this account for<br/>
these feelings of paralysis and such?<br/>
<br/>
I might be way off base, but I thought it might be worth asking.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to you,<br/>
Laura B.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-105078758">I&#39;m not sure how many folks here will be as excited by this as I am, but <br/>
I thought Sandra with her interest in music and background in English <br/>
might possibly be...<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite Romantic poets, William Blake, wrote the Songs of <br/>
Innocence and the Songs of Experience, some of which appeal to younger <br/>
kids, so my kids have a copy of each that includes pictures of his <br/>
original illuminuted plates--he was an artist as much as or more than a <br/>
writer, and his art is pretty trippy. My kids can actually recite part <br/>
of one of his poems because they love it so much, &quot;Tyger, tyger, burning <br/>
bright/ In the forests of the night/ What immortal hand or eye/ Dare <br/>
frame thy fearful symmetry?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well anyway, a composer William Bolcom put all Blake&#39;s Songs to music <br/>
and the first recording of it is being released today. Supposedly, the <br/>
different Songs represent all kinds of different musical genres from <br/>
classical to reggae and jazz.  I&#39;m definitely going to purchase it--yet <br/>
more dots in our unschooling adventure!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178119111">I love William Blake, also.  Do you have this book - A Visit to William Blake&#39;s Inn by Nancy Willard.  Though written for children, I think I liked it more than my daughter the last time we got if from the library.  But a fun book for Blake lovers.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0152938230/102-7029996-2242532?v=glance">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0152938230/102-7029996-2242532?v=glance</a><br/>

Have you read Skellig, by David Almond?  It&#39;s a young adult book, and in it a wonderful homeschooled girl always quotes William Blake.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;d like it...Jake and Sam and I really loved it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-976776388">Quote from Skellig,  Mina, the homeschooler, is speaking:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;My mother educates me,&quot; she said. &quot;We believe that schools inhibit the natural curiosity, creativity, and intelligence of children.  The mind needs to be opened out into the world, not shuttered down inside a gloomy classroom.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Then later, Mina and another main character is talking,,<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Our motto is on the wall by my bed,&quot; she said.  &quot;&#39;How can a bird that is born for joy/Sit in a cage and sing?&#39; William Blake.&quot;  She pointed up into the tree.  &quot;The chicks in the nest won&#39;t need a classroom to make them fly.  Will they?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
We also love this book,  my dd(10) is reading it right now.  We love Mina  :) and this is our favorite Mina quote, &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks Anne for recommending it on the Unschooling.com message boards.<br/>

We loved it too. I expected Jess (10) to love Mina too. They&#39;re both<br/>
outspoken and spirited (and like William Blake!) but he was completely<br/>
caught up with Skellig. He was fascinated by him and there was no room in<br/>
his mind for anyone else. He stills mentions him occasionally and some of<br/>
the characters he makes up for his games and stories have characteristics<br/>
like Skellig.<br/>

We STILL have *Skellig* conversations and we listened to the book <br/>
YEARS ago.  It is very thought-provoking and mind-expanding...and you <br/>
get to go *You GO Girl* with homeschooled Minna&#39;s marvelous <br/>
quotes!  ;-)<br/>
