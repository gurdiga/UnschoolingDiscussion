<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594277388"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yes, and some of us have children that could easily<br/>
 </span></blockquote>carry one &gt;of those labels, but we&#39;ve chosen NOT to<br/>
define them any &gt;differntly than any of our children.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I understand there are some challenges you NEED<br/>
 </span></blockquote>greater &gt;insight for, but there are plenty of<br/>
unschoolers dealing with &quot;atypical&quot; children and<br/>
choosing not to separate them in &gt;any way.<br/>
<br/>
Ooooo, that&#39;s a hot topic among parents of &quot;atypical&quot;<br/>
or &quot;special needs&quot; or whatever different kids, or<br/>
audult auties/aspies. To Label or not to label.  I<br/>
went back and forth on that issue myself for years and<br/>
finally decided to settle somewhere in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, I *hate* labels, and I don&#39;t think<br/>
you can define people that way.  On the other hand,<br/>
labels do exist, and there are some that do define us<br/>
(Mom, Unschooler, wife/partner, writer, are a few of<br/>
mine) but any one label does not define us wholly and<br/>
never can.  <br/>
<br/>
On the one hand a parent may not want to limit and box<br/>
in their kids, socially isolate them, make them feel<br/>
defective or the other possible pitfalls of labels. <br/>
On the other hand, having a child with challenges is<br/>
exhausting and really hard, and already socially<br/>
isolates you, and being able to have a common label<br/>
that helps connect you to others who are supportive<br/>
and understanding of those challenges is a great<br/>
benefit.<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand these developmental labels in<br/>
particular are tricky, the things they define are<br/>
poorly understood and how they are defined and<br/>
diagnosed varies by region, and kids are subject to<br/>
change as they grow in unpredictable ways and so find<br/>
that previous labels don&#39;t seem to apply anymore.  On<br/>
the other hand, without labels officiated by a<br/>
diagnosis therapies and many other things that hugely<br/>
assist these kids are just not available to us.<br/>
<br/>
In our home we don&#39;t see our kids differences (or our<br/>
own) as handicaps or negatives.  We embrace the word<br/>
&quot;Autism&quot; as a part of our individual and family<br/>
identity, and I certainly know other adult autistics<br/>
who feel/do the same.  We recognize the possible<br/>
limiting factors or areas where we need to address<br/>
challenges as simply a part of us.  I would no more<br/>
deny that I am short and slight of build or pale<br/>
skinned than to deny the part &quot;autism&quot; (or whatever<br/>
catchphrase can be used to describe that vast and<br/>
complex collection of behaviors and differences) plays<br/>
in who I am or who my children are.  Denial is no more<br/>
helpful or healthy or beneficial in my opinion than<br/>
slapping a label on my forehead and allowing that to<br/>
define me wholly.<br/>
<br/>
Thomas says He&#39;s &quot;artistic&quot; which is how he pronounces<br/>
autistic.  He will sometimes pick up on someone else&#39;s<br/>
behaviors and say &quot;Is he artistic like me?&quot;  Sometimes<br/>
it&#39;s in person or other times in movies/shows.  Two<br/>
recent examples are the character Sam (Johnny Depp) in<br/>
the movie Benny and Joon and the chracter William<br/>
Forrester (Sean Connery) in the movie Finding<br/>
Forester.  They both seem to obviously be high<br/>
functioning autistic to those of us who live and<br/>
breath it every day.  So does Johnny Depp&#39;s portrayal<br/>
of Willy Wonka (which we love!) and Johnny Depp<br/>
himself for that matter, based on interviews I&#39;ve seen<br/>
and his many movie roles.  So does the cast of the tv<br/>
show Third Rock From the Sun.  <br/>
<br/>
At any rate, Thomas proudly tells people he&#39;s<br/>
&quot;artistic&quot; just as he proudly shares the names of the<br/>
family pets, or talks about his movies or other<br/>
passions.  It&#39;s just part of him.<br/>

the specific &quot;personality disorder,&quot; as it&#39;s been called, affects the <br/>
computer analyst character named Chloe O&#39;Brien.  She&#39;s embarrassingly <br/>
blunt and always says exactly what she means; for instance, a coworker <br/>
was self-deprecatingly thanking her by saying &quot;I learned a lot from you <br/>
today.&quot;  Her reply: &quot;Yes, you did.&quot; ;-)   She&#39;s a brilliant tech, <br/>
though.  The character&#39;s &quot;offness&quot; makes her very interesting, and adds <br/>
to texture of the show.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is such and interesting thread for me. I recently had a friend <br/>
visit from Arizona. She is a therapist and I love her dearly. After <br/>
spending about three hours at my house she suggested I get my <br/>
youngest daughter tested. She told me she was sure she had FAS. I <br/>
have met my daughters b family and she definately has some genetic <br/>
stuff, but who does not.. And I am sure she doesn&#39;t , have FAS that <br/>
is... <br/>
Anyway she then went through possible diagnosis of disorders for my <br/>
daughter. Who by the way is one of my favorite people on the <br/>
planet... I asked her what the point was of getting diagnosies? I <br/>
explained to her how there is no way I would chose to make her any <br/>
different than who she is. How she  is so beautiful and unique to me <br/>
that somehow a label would be diminishing and dishonoring to her <br/>
individuality. She said a label would give me specific things that <br/>
would help her. It seems to me that natural learning and parenting <br/>
from a place of instinct is the most helpful thing I could do. I <br/>
could see how if you are following a standard parenting philosphy <br/>
and lifestyle a label would be of assistance. You have somewhat shut <br/>
your instincts off.. But living a whole life means not judging but <br/>
assisting your child in living his or her own whole life.<br/>
So ultimately instead of hurting my feelings with her comments it <br/>
only strengthened my resolve that our current life and course were <br/>
on and right for us.<br/>
Thanks for the thread that let me get all that out.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>=============================<br/>
<br/>
There were TWO disclaimers in the top question, though--the quotation  <br/>
marks and the phrase &quot;as it&#39;s been called.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Chloe is definitely disordered.  Her personal quirks have caused more  <br/>
problems than they&#39;ve solved.  It makes for interesting drama, and  <br/>
we&#39;ll see how they treat her character this season, but the idea that  <br/>
she would be managing people is somewhere between unwise and  <br/>
unrealistic.  People&#39;s talents and skills should be matched to their  <br/>
jobs.  Someone without spatial reasoning and kinesthetic intelligence  <br/>
should NOT be driving a big truck.  Someone who says &quot;it&#39;s just  <br/>
semantics&quot; when she&#39;s not understanding someone else&#39;s objection to a  <br/>
phrase should NOT be  an editor, speechwriter or playwright.  In the  <br/>
field of writing, an inability to distinguish between synonyms would  <br/>
be a disability.  In the driving of umpty-ton trucks and heavy  <br/>
equipment, lack of spatial reasoning would be a disability.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who went into med school and couldn&#39;t stand to see a  <br/>
living thing cut.  Couldn&#39;t stand to see the insides of a person who  <br/>
wasn&#39;t dead.   That was the end of medical school.  It wasn&#39;t &quot;a  <br/>
personality disorder&quot; but it did disable her potential to be a surgeon.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>FAS isn&#39;t genetic stuff, though.  It&#39;s damage to the fetus from the  <br/>
mother&#39;s continued drinking through pregnancy.<br/>
<br/>
When I was nineteen,  my mom told me she thought she had cirrhosis of  <br/>
the liver because he abdomen was swollen and she felt ill, but she  <br/>
was afraid to go to the doctor.  When she went, she was five months  <br/>
pregnant.   So for the first five months she drank without pause, and  <br/>
when she found out she celebrated, and she continued to drink and was  <br/>
out drinking the night she went into labor.<br/>
<br/>
My brother has some definite FAS traits.    He has trouble organizing  <br/>
thoughts and has QUITE a faulty conscience.  Those are related  <br/>
things.  He can know three things and not correlate them.  He can  <br/>
know what time he needs to be somewhere, and what he needs to wear,  <br/>
and not figure out that he needs to start the laundry early enough  <br/>
and not tell someone else he can meet them during the same time he&#39;s  <br/>
already committed to be elsewhere.  Pretty much, someone has to  <br/>
organize his life for him, or he just gets more and more entangled in  <br/>
his own incompetence.  He&#39;s not a kid, he&#39;s grown, and his lack of  <br/>
conscience causes him to be a danger to others.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth reading about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome just so you have some  <br/>
information on the side.  It&#39;s not something adoption and lots of  <br/>
love can overcome entirely.  You can surely focus on not making  <br/>
anything worse, but if it&#39;s true that her mother drank, she might  <br/>
have two problems you shouldn&#39;t ignore:  FAS and the genetic  <br/>
disposition to become an alcoholic herself.  Whether that&#39;s a  <br/>
psychological (brain chemical) or physical (blood chemical)  <br/>
disposition, or whether those can even be separated, is not  <br/>
definitely sorted out but it will affect her for life IF she has one  <br/>
or both of those.<br/>
<br/>
No sense joining another group about it or changing your unschooling.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  But it&#39;s too real to totally disregard.  Maybe she has none of  <br/>
either.<br/>

I know abou FAS.. That is why I am sure that is not what she has going <br/>
on. She is about ten miles ahead of her B mom. Who did not drink when <br/>
she was pregnant. What she has going on is genetic, not because of <br/>
alcohol. <br/>
I am sorry I was not clear. Thanks for sharing about your brother. I <br/>
have children who have FAE traits. I am not saying it is good to stay <br/>
ignorant and not know possibilities. I am saying that labels are not <br/>
necessary. I used to follow developmental guidelines for my kids. Now <br/>
I am aware what the guidelines are and I look at my child <br/>

It was!  Thanks. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

If someone had adopted my brother, I would hate for them to blame  <br/>
themselves for all his problems in the longrun, and feel that if  <br/>
they&#39;d just done something different, better, other, that he would be  <br/>
more whole.  Yes, my mom did some more damage to him over the course  <br/>
of years, but so much of who he is was determined at conception and  <br/>
birth...<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s my half brother.  I lucked out with the genetics of a non- <br/>
alcoholic father.  He did not.  So where I had one alcoholic  <br/>
grandparent and one parent, he had two alcoholic parents and at least  <br/>
two (maybe there) grandparents.<br/>
<br/>
I hope within a few generations people figure out what to do about  <br/>
that.   Prohibition doesn&#39;t solve it.  Religion doesn&#39;t solve it.   <br/>

<br/>
If a person is pretty sure her child doesn&#39;t have a syndrome, reading  <br/>
some of the definitions might be all the information she needs for  <br/>
the rest of her life.<br/>
<br/>
If a person is pretty sure her child DOES have a syndrome, the  <br/>
principles of unschooling would quite likely cover her being  <br/>
respectful and accepting and patient and providing stimulation HE  <br/>
likes and understands, and it wouldn&#39;t be necessary to associate  <br/>
herself with people who have self-identified themselves as Parents Of  <br/>
A Child With THAT.<br/>
<br/>
If the mother does that, the child becomes that, at least in the  <br/>
mom&#39;s mind.  She has made decisions based on his being that.  She has  <br/>
taken action daily based on his being that thing (whatever it is).<br/>
<br/>
If it doesn&#39;t bother you at all and you see no downside, that&#39;s  <br/>
fine.   I decided many years ago to avoid labels when possible, and I  <br/>
decided many years ago to help others see that there is the option to  <br/>
avoid labelling.  God and everybody knows you can label kids.  Who  <br/>
will say &quot;You don&#39;t have to&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Without a choice, there is no choice.  Without knowing options, a  <br/>
person cannot make a choice.<br/>

kid and enjoys life. If there is a delay or something it&#39;s only slight.<br/>
<br/>
But to know what can be done to help him as he gets older to relate to <br/>
his peers, that would be a gift. A label, in his case, would help with <br/>
that I think.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even consider something wrong with him, just different. He may <br/>
be &quot;behind&quot; his peers but he has strengths and gifts that are very <br/>
special.<br/>
<br/>
Hope I&#39;m being clear as the whole situation personally is so very <br/>
unclear at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I welcome any advise as to figuring out what is different.<br/>

Are you sure that&#39;s the advice you want?<br/>
How about advice figuring out what is the same as other children?   <br/>
Unschooling will work for your child the way it works for any child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898368276">Hi Jo,<br/>
<br/>
I think one thing that is very important with our children is to first see<br/>
them exactly as they are, and relish in that. Admire that. Love that.<br/>
Labels, advice, suggestions, books, websites, etc., can never change that.<br/>
How does your son shine? That is a place to truly nourish by providing<br/>
materials/attention/admiration/trips etc. for. Whatever label might fit your<br/>
child in no way says a word about who he is individually...it won&#39;t change<br/>
the incredible being that he is. I know you know this but before I wrote<br/>
another word, I wanted to be clear that I think this is key.<br/>
<br/>
I have four children. I knew that two of them were in a different place than<br/>
*most* children &quot;developmentally&quot;. It truly didn&#39;t matter because we weren&#39;t<br/>
in situations that judged kids, or categorized them, like in a classroom. If<br/>
you are considering unschooling now at your son&#39;s young age, there probably<br/>
is no need to get a diagnosis for him (and it is VERY easy to get diagnoses<br/>
in general, so trusting the diagnosis is another story too). Stay in the<br/>
moment with him and see where he shines. That is what he will really need.<br/>
<br/>
So the question is why do you want a diagnosis.<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for a pool of information that may help you unlock some<br/>
ways to best facilitate the best life possible for your son, then maybe you<br/>
could google some of his traits and see what comes up. You would be doing<br/>
this for YOU, to see if there are things you hadn&#39;t thought of for your<br/>
particular guy.<br/>
<br/>
If you find something that seems to fit,  I would recommend never for a<br/>
second disconnecting from your son with the thought that &quot;there is something<br/>
wrong with him&quot;. As has been said, we are all different in a gazillion ways,<br/>
and there is little to nothing wrong with most of us, even though some of us<br/>
could fall under some diagnosis.<br/>
<br/>
That said, it is much easier for me to communicate with some people about my<br/>
son using the term &quot;autistic&quot;. It eliminates having to go through a myriad<br/>
of personality traits that are common with most autistic folks, and takes me<br/>
a much shorter time to move on to whatever the point of the communication<br/>
is. If you find that your son has similar characteristics to some diagnosis,<br/>
then it may help in communication sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
I would not convey a label to your son. It wasn&#39;t until my oldest was 15<br/>
that we ever said the word &quot;autistic&quot; TO him. He knew something was very<br/>
&quot;different&quot; about him from his friends, he had all these struggles that he<br/>
saw his siblings and *friends* (he didn&#39;t really have bona fide friends till<br/>
this year...he thought if he knew someone, they were his friend...he&#39;s 17<br/>
now)and he asked questions of us. My husband, who had himself evaluated for<br/>
his own sanity when he was 50 or so, thought ds would appreciate having<br/>
information about Asperger&#39;s. So it kinda came from my son, when we actually<br/>
shared a label with him...not give him a label perse, but shared information<br/>
with him. And it turned out to be a good thing for him.<br/>
<br/>
So I recommend being very conscientious of what you do with a label or<br/>
diagnosis...it shouldn&#39;t be a downer in any way, just a way to get more<br/>
information, or in some cases, to get services from the state. And at some<br/>
point, it may help your son in getting information as well.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t edited this email like I usually do, but wanted to get this out<br/>
before I had to run with one of my guys.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Jacki<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes a label can be helpful so that a parent doesn&#39;t get worried<br/>
when a child&#39;s peers can do x, y, or z and child doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I have a child (age 4 1/2) who seems to be &quot;behind&quot; (for<br/>
lack of a better term) his peers and kids younger than him and I&#39;m<br/>
trying to figure out if there is something different about him and if<br/>
there is something I can do to make things easier for him.<br/>
<br/>
So far, it&#39;s not totally holding him back. He&#39;s pretty much a happy<br/>
kid and enjoys life. If there is a delay or something it&#39;s only slight.<br/>
<br/>
But to know what can be done to help him as he gets older to relate to<br/>
his peers, that would be a gift. A label, in his case, would help with<br/>
that I think.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even consider something wrong with him, just different. He may<br/>
be &quot;behind&quot; his peers but he has strengths and gifts that are very<br/>
special.<br/>
<br/>
Hope I&#39;m being clear as the whole situation personally is so very<br/>
unclear at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I welcome any advise as to figuring out what is different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-230328612">Well, my daughter isn&#39;t an axe-murderer, but I would definitely say that some of her <br/>
autistic traits are a disorder. Personality differences don&#39;t explain biting the skin off of <br/>
your hands or banging your head till it bleeds. Granted, it&#39;s a subset of her autism, <br/>
probably the sensory integration dysfunction, but those behaviors are (how did Sandra put <br/>
it?) where the quirks cause more problems than they solve? That&#39;s the disorder. <br/>
<br/>
We told Josh about his aspergers when we found out. Why? Because he was already so <br/>
stressed out about the trouble he had functioning anywhere. He didn&#39;t understand why he <br/>
couldn&#39;t handle noises like other people, crowds like others, he couldn&#39;t finish a project no <br/>
matter how hard he tried. He was always the first person to need to leave a party. His <br/>
communication skills had strangers concerned, he had people turn around and walk away <br/>
while he was talking. He had a lot of anger and depression that he was internalizing. <br/>
Knowing a name for his difference made a huge difference for him. <br/>
<br/>
For Breanna&#39;s siblings, it made a difference for them because her behaviors scared them <br/>
(or made them angry when she ruins their toys or we skip a party or such). They were <br/>
scared that they could lose control and hurt themselves or others. They&#39;ve always known <br/>
she was autistic, they&#39;ve been around many autistic children and adults, and they <br/>
understand it&#39;s a spectrum of differences. Sometimes it&#39;s more like Josh, and sometimes <br/>
more like Bre. It&#39;s definitely increased their compassion, and they understand differences <br/>
better than most I know.<br/>

&gt;&gt;autistic traits are a disorder.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I certainly see what you are saying Melissa. It is a very challenging kind<br/>
of thing to figure out with our children.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like for your children sharing the label with them was what they<br/>
needed at an earlier age than what we did here. That&#39;s a great example of<br/>
listening to our individual children for what they need.<br/>
<br/>
I hate the word disorder because it has an automatic negative connotation.<br/>
Yes, a child may bang her head or bite through skin, but the same child also<br/>
shines in many ways. Focusing on the shine is what she really needs us to<br/>
do. What are her passions...what does she love to do?<br/>
<br/>
And we can usually lessen the out of sync behaviors over time as we work to<br/>
avoid the triggers. It&#39;s a lot of work, extra work, I know. And usually our<br/>
kids lessen and lessen the &quot;atypical&quot; behaviors as we help them assimilate<br/>
in the world, over time.<br/>
<br/>
But the important thing is that our children do shine...maybe they aren&#39;t<br/>
meant to be at parties right now, or in large crowded settings...but so<br/>
what? Keep them out of those settings, or if they choose to go to a party be<br/>
ready to leave the second they want/need to go, even if it is one minute<br/>
after you arrive. Having children with &quot;atypical&quot; needs is not a problem, it<br/>
just means we have to be ready and willing to fulfill THEIR unique needs in<br/>
any moment, even if it means we feel embarrassed or no one around us quite<br/>
gets it. We are serving our children, not those other people around us.<br/>
<br/>
Side question: What is the number of people needed to have a certain<br/>
condition labeled &quot;disorder&quot; before we start to see them as a completely<br/>
normal part of our population? Not disordered people, but unique to who they<br/>
are?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-656098282">Well, and something I meant to post last night, but ran out of steam (kids are sleeping, <br/>
why am I NOT!? LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
I posted a few of the negative traits, and I certainly hate to give the impression that those <br/>
traits are what we focus on in our home. That&#39;s far from the truth! In fact, we are focussed <br/>
on what each of our children are capable of doing and what they are interested in, so that <br/>
we can build on those skills and help them become more comfortable in the world. If it <br/>
wasn&#39;t for Breanna&#39;s trouble in the ps, I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d ever reached the point that I <br/>
did. Because we don&#39;t qualify for any assistance and our insurance covers no therapy, I was <br/>
doing all of her therapy myself. And it came to the point where I suddenly realized <br/>
(epiphany  moment) that school is not helping my children, it&#39;s hurting them...the <br/>
professionals know no more than I do about my children and their &#39;disAbilities&#39;...and what <br/>
they needed was to be home with people who love them, care about them, and can <br/>
honestly say that they were available to help.<br/>
<br/>
We have been keeping our kids out of stressful settings. However, that&#39;s not always <br/>
functional. What we have done is keep track of what they are capable of, and adjust. <br/>
Breanna loves the mall, just not with people in it. So we get up early and go when it&#39;s just <br/>
the elderly walkers. She likes to buy groceries, but cannot walk through the front door at <br/>
Walmart...so we go to other stores OR if I&#39;m really hankering for the deal on apples, we&#39;ll <br/>
enter and exit through automotive. She loves McD&#39;s french fries, so that&#39;s incentive <br/>
enough to deal with obnoxious screaming toddlers. ;-) Slowly she&#39;s making her own <br/>
supports to deal with things she doesn&#39;t like, so she can do what she likes. What&#39;s more <br/>
functional than that? <br/>
<br/>
I am so glad for parents who get *it* early. It took so many wasted years for me to <br/>
understand that my kids should be at home where they are comfortable. Same with the <br/>
potty training, aparenting, etc...why did it take me so many kids to understand?  Well, <br/>
we&#39;re going to the store to buy more glycerin and molds for soap. They are really enjoying <br/>
this...and they are cleaner than they&#39;ve been in a long time!<br/>
