&lt;&lt; That&#39;s why I use a lot of &quot;what if your husband did that to you?&quot; <br/>
examples. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This was one of the most helpful bits ever as I was shifting my thinking.<br/>
I still have to run what I do through the &quot;what if it were my dh&quot; filter. It <br/>
helps me see if I&#39;m really being respectful, or just reverting to old <br/>
behavior.<br/>
It&#39;s a conscious choice though, something I struggle with (and don&#39;t always <br/>
do well at) because of old training.<br/>
I was up on &quot;posisitve parenting&quot; techniques and such, but this was beyond <br/>
that!!<br/>
What you guys were talking about made all of the good things I had learned <br/>
about gentle parenting doable. I struggled and struggled for years with the <br/>
parenting books I read, not able to overcome my temper for the most part. And <br/>
they were still focused on getting kids to do certain things.<br/>
Once I let go of the idea of chores and such, I was finally able to start <br/>
changing the way I interacted with my children.<br/>
Reading about real life experiences is what helped the most.<br/>
Because when someone said &quot;unlimited&quot; in reference to tv/food/bedtime etc...<br/>
my first response was &quot;yeah, right!!&quot;<br/>
But when reading how it actually worked in their families, a lightbulb went <br/>
on, and I thought &quot;We can DO this.&quot;<br/>
It took struggles and transitions are never easy, but we&#39;re somewhere good <br/>
now.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>

magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

Because you accuse people of writing condescendingly, sarcastic and rude when <br/>
that is not the case at all.<br/>
It&#39;s simply how it was perceived due to a lack of understanding. Not what the <br/>
writer was trying to do.<br/>
When you label someones writing as being those things, that is an attack on a <br/>
persons writing style and brand of advice.<br/>
No one called anyone names or wrote anything that was actually condescending <br/>
in my opinion...it&#39;s just very, very difficult to have your parenting <br/>
examined and dissected.<br/>

teacher he knew, to apply to be his student. The master offered tea, and he <br/>

and the pouring continued, until the student was getting a lapful of tea, and <br/>

Christians say “You must surrender yourself.” Before that Jesus said, <br/>

control and add to what you already know, it will be hard to come to <br/>
unschooling. The more quickly you empty your cup and open yourself to new <br/>
ideas uncritically, the sooner you will see natural learning blossom. -=-<br/>

&quot;got there&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
The tone of this is confrontational and impatient and critical.<br/>
<br/>
Teresa, unless you can be still and read and think instead of being noisy and <br/>
defensive and troublesome, you won&#39;t be learning.  You&#39;ll be preventing <br/>
others from learning too.  &quot;You know...&quot; and &quot;You sure do forget...&quot; need to <br/>
be replaced with quiet.   And your attentions need to be more on your <br/>
children than on this list, or on me.   You&#39;re looking the wrong way and <br/>
you&#39;re making a wall of defensive noise.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling.com is currently one of the best &quot;teachers&quot; of unschooling on <br/>
earth.  Dozens of people who have been unschooling longer than two months <br/>
will answer any questions you care to ask. Or you could read all of John Holt <br/>
alone at home.  That&#39;s what many of us had to do, pre-internet.  There are <br/>
other places where people will discuss unschooling with you too.  Right now, <br/>
though, there is more information at unschooling.com than any one unschooling <br/>
parent could have found about unschooling in the whole world put together ten <br/>
years ago.  <br/>

<br/>
P.S.  It might be that unschooling won&#39;t work at your house, because your <br/>
husband or your kids aren&#39;t interested, or because you will decide you don&#39;t <br/>
really believe in it.  That&#39;s okay.  Your family is more important than this <br/>
is.  If that turns out to be the case, it will be because of you and your <br/>
husband and your family and your priorities, not because of the tone of this <br/>
list.</div>

<br/>
Actually, no one ever accused me of being &quot;difficult&quot;.<br/>
 I never accused anyone of being condescending to me, or rude or sarcastic <br/>
just because I was being examined.<br/>
My beliefs were dissected, yes. But I didn&#39;t respond with putting down the <br/>
people that were dissecting my beliefs.<br/>
I argued my side of the belief . And then I examined it and realized it came <br/>
up short.<br/>
And my position was usually &quot;I don&#39;t think that could work for MY kids.&quot; <br/>
That&#39;s different than accusing someone of being rude just because they are <br/>
asking very probing questions and saying that your belief isn&#39;t necessarily <br/>
true.<br/>

&lt;&lt; From that little grain of a start, understanding that one loves Lego and <br/>
 silence while another loves books and soft cushions and the third loves loud <br/>
 music and roller blades, we wonder maybe whether it&#39;s okay if one doesn&#39;t <br/>
 like vegetarian food, or one wants to feng-shui-ify the rec room.  And from <br/>
 there it  just all unravels into a whole new world of respect for each child <br/>
