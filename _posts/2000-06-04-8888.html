    I&#39;d like to hear about the infamous banana test !  :)  My dh can see how <br/>
eating better positively affects me and my oldest in particular, but  has not <br/>
been willing to give up refined junk.  Also, he complains about the cost of <br/>
some of the healthier  foods... for example, the organic p-nut butter was <br/>
$4.oo!  However, the flip side of that is that we don&#39;t eat out as much.        <br/>

Julie, I ended up having many of the hypo-g symptoms return this week.  I <br/>
cannot say that it was all due to having used the rice syrup, but I know it <br/>
played a part.  My oldest son, who is also extremely food sensitive, was <br/>
bouncing off the walls after eating 3 cookies.  He even told me that the way <br/>
he was feeling &quot;must be from the cookies&quot;!  If you do not have LBS, it  might <br/>
be a good alternative for you.  I tried  that ,in addition  to too many grain <br/>
based foods, particularly rice and wheat things,  and have had a very bad <br/>
reaction;  it was just too much starch for me right now.  The low blood sugar <br/>
handbook recipes sweeten with small amts of unsweetened from concentrate <br/>
fruit juices.  They contend that there is a better chance of not getting an  <br/>
adverse pancreatic reaction.  Someone asked (Amy?) about using artificial <br/>
sweeteners-- The Krimmel&#39;s advice is not to use them b/c the pancreas will <br/>
not recognize them as not being sugar, and would likely still over produce <br/>
insulin amts.    What a rotten deal, huh! :)                                    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-683911190">We have tons of organic strawberries here locally.  When we go to the<br/>
farmers market next weekend (or maybe this Thursday if they start the<br/>
second one), I&#39;ll ask the guys that grow them for the name of them and if<br/>
they know of any network of organic growers.<br/>
<br/>
Also, have you tried stevia?  A friend on another list uses it and has no<br/>
reactions.<br/>
