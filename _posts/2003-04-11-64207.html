 </span></blockquote>there&#39;s a running joke in our family from &quot;It&#39;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, when Uncle <br/>
Billy stumbles drunk down the sidewalk and crashed into something off-screen <br/>
very loudly, and shouts &quot;I&#39;m ALRIGHT! I&#39;m alright....&quot; so when ever someone <br/>
crashes around the house, that&#39;s what we yell LOL<br/>
