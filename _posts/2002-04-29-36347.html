<div id="ygrps-yiv-455036889"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;they called a small sliver of the world &#39;all,&#39; and we call all of a life&#39;s<br/>
&gt;learning &#39;some.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra, what a nice schooling&#39;s philosophy/unschooling&#39;s philosophy in a<br/>
nutshell.  Good food for thought.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One of my fondest memories is of putting out a creche scene one Christmas (a<br/>
&gt; Christian home-diarama) of Italian design and manufacture, about 5&quot; high on<br/>
&gt; the adults, and made of hard plastic, like from the 1950&#39;s or 1960&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I saw it for what it was.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kirby and Marty saw it as what it was from their point of view:  &quot;Jesus<br/>
&gt; action figures&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One day I came in and there were two Ninja Turtles adoring Jesus, while a<br/>
&gt; king and a shepherd had gone off to help vanquish Splinter and the Foot Clan.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What a great laugh...thanks for sharing!<br/>
