LOL, I enjoy getting agitated!  But you didn&#39;t really, I just wanted to say <br/>
what I had to say in the right way, and I was to sleepy!  <br/>
I understand what you mean now, when I first read the post I thought it was <br/>
just that everyone wanted to talk to her about hsing and she didn&#39;t always <br/>
want to talk about it.  Like she was the center of attention and didn&#39;t like <br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
No one likes to defend themselves all the time, I just simply don&#39;t.  One <br/>
time and one time only someone tried to start some stuff with my girlfriend <br/>
and I at the music school.  Her son is very disruptive and has been all but <br/>
kicked out of school.  Anyway, she started talking to us and my girlfriend <br/>
always feels she has to be defensive.  Then the woman started on me and said <br/>
something about socialization.  I looked at my friend and we both just burst <br/>
out laughing.  Then I told her we had no problem and turned around and walk <br/>
off.  My friend spent another ten minutes before she could tear herself away. <br/>
 I don&#39;t mess with em.  If they start, just say, If you are really interested <br/>
and want to know, I will be glad to share, if you want to debate, find <br/>
someone else, I am here for pleasure.  If they persist, walk away and THEN <br/>
you know you need new acquaintances.  That&#39;s the way I look at it anyway!<br/>
