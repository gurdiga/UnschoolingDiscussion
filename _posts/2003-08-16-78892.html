<div id="ygrps-yiv-810702375">This is an excellent question/thought.  To me, it ties right in with folks <br/>
different reactions, perceptions, and feelings about reading. <br/>
<br/>
 We have LOTS of books.. I mean.. well, its a lot.. thousands,I would guess.  <br/>
 They are on several easily accessible shelves throughout the house.   We <br/>
have racks and stacks of magazines.  Landon and myself are always reading <br/>
something.   We (Landon and I)  read the backs of cereal boxes, fliers that come in <br/>
the mail.. heck, anything.. lol.   Anna has a few collections of particular <br/>
series of books she likes. She takes reading jags and she will read constantly <br/>
til she is finished with a book.  Dh reads his bicycles magazines every night.  <br/>
Of course we have the computer and Landon, Anna, DH or I are usually reading <br/>
something online.   We get a local trade paper every week and browse for <br/>
bargains.   Barnes and Noble is a favorite hangout for Landon, Anna and I.    The <br/>
library is right up there with B&N.      In every aspect of our lives, books and <br/>
printed materials are  &quot;there&quot; and valued highly by most of our family<br/>
<br/>
 sidenote:  Landon just came upstairs and handed me Carson McCullers &quot;The <br/>
Member of the Wedding&quot;  and said.. &quot;Read this, it will greatly enhance your <br/>
horizons, it will take about 5 minutes..&quot;..  OK, its 153 pages, it will take me a <br/>
little more than 5 minutes.. lol. but.. this is a good RIGHT NOW example of <br/>
books and reading &quot;lifestyle&quot; in our home.<br/>
<br/>
OK.. given all that I have described about books and reading in our family, <br/>
my middle son, Ethan. (almost 12) couldnt care less if every book in the world <br/>
burned up tomorrow.   Now, I do not mean that he hates books or has some <br/>
aversion to them.. the just does not care about them. .. at all.   He will opt out <br/>
of going to the book store or library if he has an option.  ( Now that he is <br/>
older he can stay at home by himself).   He has some gaming magazines, but he <br/>
mostly looks at the pictures.     He CAN read.. at a very basic level, but he <br/>
will avoid if at all possible.  I do not push him, never have.. and he was VERY <br/>
fortunate to not have pushy teachers or some over  the top curriculum when he <br/>
was in school.   He does not seem to be ashamed of his reading level.   He <br/>
does not seem embarrassed about it.  He is just ambivalent.  <br/>
<br/>
  Our love of reading and the rich  reading/book availabilty environment that <br/>
he lives in, has zero affect on his feelings about reading.   Or in other <br/>
words,  he has not been indoctrinated, or even influenced by our &quot;lifestyle&quot; of <br/>
reading or by the value that most of the members of our family places on books <br/>
and reading.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, I must make my disclaimer.  My description of Ethan and his reading ( or <br/>
lack thereof)  does NOT mean I am worried about him, that I want to &quot;fix&quot; <br/>
him, or that something is &quot;wrong&quot; with him.   Ethan is a bright young man.  He <br/>
can do things, and he knows about things that none of my other children have a <br/>
clue about.  Ethan can change a tire, change the oil in a car, jumpstart a <br/>
battery.. . heck, he could probably rebuild a carbeurator.. :-)   When DH is not <br/>
here ( and sometimes when he is..lol) Ethan is our &quot;tech&quot; man.  He takes care <br/>
of VCR, DVD, TV, game systems, fuse box..  heck,  just about any kind of <br/>
technical/electronic/mechanical problems that comes up.  He just built a little <br/>
table to go in his room.  He constructed some kind of a cardboard house out of <br/>
refrigerator boxes in the yard.. complete with doors, windows and a fan.  He has <br/>
been building lego models of Hummers.   Ethan has skills, interests, and <br/>
abilities that he will most likely continue to explore and I have no fear that he <br/>
will have a full and happy, productive life.    Reading is not, and I think <br/>
never will be, &quot;natural&quot; to Ethan.   And, programming the VCR is not natural to <br/>
me :-)  It&#39;s a good thing we all have our own special gifts and talents.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-131194553">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m new here, have been lurking for a couple of weeks, soaking up all I can about unschooling.  We have always homeschooled, but I am convinced that unschooling will be so much better. <br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t posted here yet, but wanted to say that this post is a great encouragement to me.  I am a voracious reader, also reading cereal boxes, shampoo bottles etc!  There are books all over the house, and many times I have a different book in each room that I am reading at the same time.  But my daughter hasn&#39;t picked up any great interest in reading.  In spite of what the commercials say, that if you want your kids to read then they should see you reading.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter sounds so much like your son.  She can read but not on the level &quot;they&quot; say she should be for her age.  Like your son, she can figure out how to put things together much better than I can, she has many interests and a lot of knowledge not picked up from books. She does like going to the bookstore or library though, but that&#39;s because she can socialize there and they have music and videos too!  <br/>
<br/>
When I first started kicking around the idea of unschooling, I was nervous about the reading and math.  After reading here and other places and thinking over how much more I learned outside of school than in it, I am ready to let go and let her be.  I realize I made alot of mistakes along the way, but I can see that now and am very excited about the changes ahead of us.<br/>
<br/>
So thanks to all of you who have gone on ahead blazing the trail!  Just lurking on these lists the last couple of weeks has helped me resolve some of my questions and fears.  You&#39;ve challenged my thinking and helped me to see things in ways I may not have considered before.  <br/>

<br/>
Isn&#39;t it strange that some parents will say &quot;My child isn&#39;t reading, all he&#39;s <br/>
doing is being on the computer all day&quot;?   That takes a lot of reading, and <br/>
if they&#39;re doing instant messages of any sort, that&#39;s REAL writing, in real <br/>
time.   <br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s the hardest part of helping people get from school-visions to <br/>
unschooling is helping the parents see writing when it&#39;s not on a piece of <br/>
notebook paper with straight margins.  I want to magically help them see that <br/>
reading cereal boxes and Harry Potter cards and game instructions is more REAL as <br/>
reading goes than any reading-comprehension workbook ever created.<br/>
