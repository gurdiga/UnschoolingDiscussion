<div id="ygrps-yiv-264859936">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to update on something that I had posted a couple months ago.<br/>
Some may remember that I wrote about my son leaving football because the <br/>
couches where swearing and yelling at the kids.  He did quit and has been happy he <br/>
left.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight I was shopping and ran into a Mom who had a child on the team. Her <br/>
son also quit which is something they didn&#39;t allow their older son to do two <br/>
years ago. <br/>
<br/>
To make to story short she told me that the coach was asked to leave due to <br/>
his cursing at the kids!!<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say thank you to all who commented on my posts it was good <br/>
to know others where thinking as I was.<br/>
<br/>
We have been holding the gear until the end of the season and had planned on <br/>
requesting our funds back. In light of this new information I will be holding <br/>
firm on my decision.<br/>
<br/>
