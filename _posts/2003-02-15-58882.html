&lt;&lt; Thanks Ren and speaking of the raffle...are you doing it this year?  I <br/>
have <br/>
some great things to contribute. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know (or remember, or happen to be) who got the baseball jigsaw <br/>
puzzle last year?   Because there was a copy of a printout of the website <br/>
where it&#39;s ensconced forever (however long websites are going to last &lt;bwg&gt;), <br/>
and since I was at the hospital I didn&#39;t get to give the little speeches that <br/>
went with the raffle items.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
But for whoever got that puzzle, I had used it here:<br/>
