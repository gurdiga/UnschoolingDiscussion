<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469671078">We take a trip to our local 99 cent stores about once a month. We find TONS <br/>
of art supplies and all other sorts of &quot;school&quot; supplies. We almost always <br/>
pick up craft sticks, paper, crayons (which we often melt down and mix colors <br/>
or pour into molds), water colors, containers, word search books, silk <br/>
flowers (my daughter loves to make these into hair wreaths), yarn, string, <br/>
baskets (to collect just about anything in), and all kinds of other stuff. <br/>
For painting I&#39;ve bought dish scrubbers, sponges, brushes, etc. 99 cent <br/>
stores are a favorite educational supply store for us! And if you can don&#39;t <br/>
just visit one. It&#39;s amazing the things you&#39;ll find. Yes, some items don&#39;t <br/>
last to long with younger kids, but even the expensive stuff often doesn&#39;t <br/>
last long, so why spend the extram $$. The kids learn math during our trips <br/>
as I give each of the kids $5 and let them choose what they want. <br/>

materials, as cheaply as we can, but it&#39;s still much more expensive than<br/>
the dollar stores. They&#39;re just better, and I think it&#39;s frustrating to<br/>
have to use inferior materials when you&#39;re still working hard on making<br/>
your art look the way you envision it. Working with berol pencils and<br/>
strathmore paper just feels right, and good. We buy a lot from<br/>
www.dickblick.com, they have good sales sometimes, and some of the local<br/>
artists&#39; stores have had good sales. <br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t use recycled paper (paper with something on the back) for<br/>
artwork. I used to, when my daughter was very tiny,  then someone pointed<br/>
out to me the message that was sending - &quot;What you are creating is not<br/>
worth a new sheet of paper.&quot; Ouch. Not the message I wanted to send. I<br/>
think that high-quality art supplies send the message that, &quot;What you are<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97920731">The kidlets have always had &quot;just for fun&quot; art supplies and &quot;I want you to<br/>
keep this&quot; art supplies.  I buy them a case of computer paper for about<br/>
$27/case but you can get it cheaper than that because we buy recycled<br/>
content paper.<br/>
<br/>
Then we buy a couple of reams of colored copier paper for projects.<br/>
<br/>
And for good paper I usually get the Biggie sketch pads.  9.5 x 11 are<br/>
usually less than $5.00.  And the Montval field books aren&#39;t too bad in<br/>
price for watercolors.<br/>

 </span></blockquote><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.classroomdirect.com">http://www.classroomdirect.com</a> has good prices (flat bristle brushes <br/>
bought singly from $0.31 to $0.64, depending on size; acrylic paint <br/>
$5.49 for 16 oz; Prang ready-to-use tempera $1.49 for 8 oz) and even <br/>
better Internet buyer specials (Prang washable paint $2.49 for 16 oz) <br/>
and carries the most common brands of &quot;classroom&quot; quality art <br/>
supplies.  Of course, they also carry materials for every other <br/>
subject, plus office supplies, furnishings, and educational room <br/>
decorations.  They have a big, juicy paper catalog for browsing (well <br/>
worth it, even if you just use it for inspiration), and a website for <br/>
searching.  If you&#39;re going to order from them, you could do what I <br/>
do.  Make one BIG order for the next 6 months to year&#39;s worth of <br/>
supplies--paper by the ream, paint by the bucket, big boxes of <br/>
doo-dads and jigglies--and get further price cuts for buying bulk <br/>
($14.70 for a gallon of Prang washable) plus free shipping (assuming <br/>
your order totals more than $149.00).<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.discountschoolsupply.com">http://www.discountschoolsupply.com</a> has a much smaller selection, but <br/>
I order my paint from them now, because they have a smoother, <br/>
brighter paint called BioColor, which I prefer over tempera and which <br/>
is also 100% non-toxic, all-natural, and environmentally friendly. <br/>
They sell some very interesting add-ons for their paints, as <br/>
well--media to add to it to make it into putty, foam, or fabric <br/>
paint, cool tools for creating neat effects, etc.  They have other <br/>
materials, as well, and a good clearance section on their website.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i&#39;m really glad this came up. i&#39;ve just started reading some of the john holt <br/>
books and i saw a bit about the art saying a similar thing. it made me wonder <br/>
about my own methods and &#39;messages&#39;. ds is 3 1/2. i always give new sheets of <br/>
paper, we mostly use plain copier paper and construction paper, and some <br/>
large slick paper for  painting. we buy the crayon school paints or whatever <br/>
&#39;kids&#39; paints we can find. we have his pictures taped up all over the fridge <br/>
and around the walls near the small craft table. i&#39;ve recently started asking <br/>
him where he wants to put his pictures, so sometimes we have a picture taped <br/>
in the middle of the d.r. wall for a couple of days, he generally will take <br/>
it down and sometimes treat it as a toy.<br/>
<br/>
i know very little about art, but so far my thought has been to make the <br/>
stuff available, as varied as i can, and let him go, and put it up to look <br/>
at. we often spend some time on each talking about colors or what looks like <br/>
what, etc. i guess i&#39;ve kinda figured that at this point his art is more <br/>
about experiencing what different things can do since he&#39;s not really into <br/>
drawing defined pictures of anything. he seems more to enjoy the dipping of <br/>
brushes and smearing of paint and blending of all colors. he has no interest <br/>
in markers, crayons or pencils.<br/>
<br/>
should i be buying acrylic paints, canvas and frames? i surely don&#39;t want to <br/>
send a message that this is just kid stuff and not important, but at the same <br/>
time i&#39;m not sure how important it is to him. he loves to paint, but <br/>
sometimes when a picture is on the fridge he&#39;ll tear it up himself. somtimes <br/>
he&#39;ll ask me if he can and i tell him that if he wants to he can, it is his <br/>
picture.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for any feedback<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286491581">Brenda- The way I see it is when my child is ready to be serious about art, <br/>
they will let me know. For now they see art as fun, just that, fun. My <br/>
daughter loves her brightly colored construction paper, cheap sponges, etc. <br/>
For her she&#39;s happiest right now having a large variety of items to <br/>
experiment with. She loves being able to cut up the sponges into various <br/>
shapes, or no shapes at all, sometimes she&#39;ll just cut them up or shred them <br/>
and use them that way. Sometimes the construction paper is used only to cut <br/>
at. She&#39;s having fun cutting and she doesn&#39;t care about what she&#39;s making, <br/>
but is facinated with how the scissors work. My kids are all under 7 years <br/>
old and love to experiment with textures, colors, and variety right now. They <br/>
absolutely love our visits to the dollar stores so they can find something <br/>
new they can do art with. The expensive &quot;nice&quot; art supplies aren&#39;t what they <br/>
need and/or want at this time. They have never asked me about having &quot;nicer&quot; <br/>
supplies. Their thrilled with what they have now. However, if the day should <br/>
ever come that they ask for nice brushes, acrylic paints, nice paper, <br/>
charcol, etc, it will be provided to them. Right now they ask for crayola, <br/>
sponges, colorful papers, design cutting scissors and coloring books. You <br/>
don&#39;t need fancy expensive supplies to tell your child that their art is <br/>
important to you. You tell them that by letting them have the supplies they <br/>
want and appriciating everything they do with it, no matter how messy LOL.<br/>

young age my daughter was always creating. Loves art.  Talks about <br/>
being an artist.  Still is.  A lot of it is just day to day stuff, <br/>
not trying to make nice pictures.  We use a LOT of scrap paper from <br/>
the fax/printer with writing on the back.  We also have a good supply <br/>
of inexpensive art supplies from Wal-Mart.  Pads of regular paper in <br/>
various sizes, construction paper, etc.  AND we have a supply of good <br/>
quality watercolor paper, pastel paper with oil pastels, and better <br/>
quality watercolors that are still washable (a must right now with <br/>
her). We have a good supply of cheap brushes, and a good supply of <br/>
better quality brushes.  If and when she wants &quot;real&quot; acrylics or <br/>
oils and canvas, we&#39;ll go that route.  We don&#39;t usually pull out <br/>
the &quot;good&quot; stuff unless she wants to make something nice.  Both kids <br/>
are happy to use the cheap stuff as well.<br/>

but I don&#39;t think there are rules... we&#39;ve sort of naturally progressed<br/>
through different art materials as we see them or see work done with<br/>
them, but we&#39;ve never used canvases... although now that you brought it<br/>
up, it sounds cool, and maybe we will. :-)<br/>

&gt;**should i be buying acrylic paints, canvas and frames? i surely don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt;to send a message that this is just kid stuff and not important, but at the<br/>
&gt;same time i&#39;m not sure how important it is to him. he loves to paint, **<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My 2.5 yo loves to paint and I just purchased some canvas & acrylics for<br/>
&gt;her - call me crazy, but why not?!   The canvas was on sale and it&#39;s a cute<br/>
&gt;4x6 size - something for her to paint and we will give to grandma & daddy &<br/>
&gt;so on.  It makes her proud and happy and that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about.  I too<br/>
&gt;allow her to tell me where to hang the painting.   Our home is her home so<br/>
&gt;she has her things all over, not just in her room or on the fridge.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877127154">I asked Gina whether her Sonic-site art started on paper and she wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
Most of my artwork starts on paper and is scanned, just as the message below <br/>
says about the boy&#39;s art. Then I color it with Photoshop.<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ll make a logo or a banner from just what&#39;s on the computer, but <br/>
even then I sometimes use pictures I already have scanned and take parts of <br/>
them, paisting them into new places and editng them.<br/>
