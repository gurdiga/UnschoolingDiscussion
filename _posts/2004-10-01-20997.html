<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305235188">FYI: I just received the &quot;Museum Tour&quot; catalog and they have several <br/>
different roller coaster type toys. It seems to be an imaginative and <br/>
creative selection of toys. But sorta expensive. They have a web <br/>
site: www.museumtour.com. The magazine appears more attractive than <br/>
the web site even. They have make your own kites, weaving looms, <br/>
pottery wheels, many electronic toys that you design and build, fun <br/>
nature kits, etc. Lots of hands on discovery elements to play with.<br/>
