The accompanying press release states:<br/>
<br/>
For Release<br/>
MONDAY, DECEMBER 17, 2001<br/>
9 A.M. EASTERN TIME  FBI NATIONAL PRESS 202-324-3691<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation today released figures<br/>
collected by the Uniform Crime Reporting Program indicating that<br/>
the Nation&#39;s Crime Index fell 0.3 percent during the first 6<br/>
months of 2001 when compared to January-June 2000 data.<br/>
<br/>
The Crime Index is comprised of violent and property crimes.<br/>
Overall, violent crimes, which include murder and nonnegligent<br/>
manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault,<br/>
declined 1.3 percent for January through June 2001 when compared<br/>
to the data reported for the corresponding months in 2000.<br/>
Property crimes, which include burglary, larceny-theft, and motor<br/>
vehicle theft, fell 0.2 percent when compared to the data<br/>
reported for January through June 2000. Arson offenses, which are<br/>
part of a Modified Crime Index, increased 2.9 percent for the<br/>
first 6 months of 2001 when compared to the figures reported for<br/>
the same time period in 2000.<br/>
<br/>
Comparing data reported in the first six months of 2001 to those<br/>
reported for the same period in 2000, the offenses of murder and<br/>
robbery both showed increases-0.8 percent for robbery and 0.3<br/>
percent for murder. However, the volume of forcible rapes and<br/>
aggravated assaults reported to law enforcement declined by 1.7<br/>
and 2.4 percent, respectively. The volume of property crimes<br/>
varied with burglary declining 1.2 percent, larceny-theft<br/>
decreasing 0.4 percent, and motor vehicle theft increasing 2.6<br/>
percent.<br/>
<br/>
By city population groupings, cities with populations of 50,000<br/>
to 99,999 inhabitants recorded the biggest decline in the volume<br/>
of Index crimes at 1.7 percent. The largest increase in Index<br/>
offenses occurred in cities of 250,000 to 499,999 population with<br/>
a rise of 1.9 percent. Rural and suburban counties registered<br/>
1.9-percent and 0.6-percent decreases, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
By region, Index crime fell 4.1 percent in the Northeast and 1.9<br/>
percent in the Midwest. The West recorded an increase of 1.6<br/>
percent and the South, an increase of 0.8 percent.<br/>
<br/>
This report is based upon the reports of agencies that submitted<br/>
3-6 compatible months of data from January through June in both<br/>
2000 and 2001.<br/>
