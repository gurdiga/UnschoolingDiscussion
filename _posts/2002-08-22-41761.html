agreeing with whoever wrote that the kid (hey - he&#39;s a *kid* to me! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;) is just writing about what he knows of life. When my three <br/>
youngest kids first started listening to his music a few years ago I <br/>
took a dim view of the lyrics, but knowing my kids I decided to find <br/>
out what all the hoopla was about. Our youngest son, Michael (then <br/>
16) was especially taken with a song - I think it&#39;s called &quot;The Fan&quot; <br/>
or something similar - about a groupie who writes to the musician, <br/>
doesn&#39;t receive a reply, writes again, ends up driving off a bridge <br/>
with his pregnant girlfriend in the trunk of his car because the <br/>
artist wouldn&#39;t respond. Michael would play it over and over again, <br/>
and one day he asked me if I thought the story was true. I said no, I <br/>
didn&#39;t think so, and that led to a couple of hours of discussion <br/>
about many things related to obsession, emotional dependence, the <br/>
music industry, and so on and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
And that was it - the song didn&#39;t get played nearly as often after <br/>
that, and while Michael will still turn up the radio if he hears that <br/>
particular tune come on, he&#39;s not nearly as interested in it as he <br/>
was for those few weeks before we talked. I think he was working <br/>
things out in his head, and when he got them worked out he verified <br/>
his observations with me, and that was that. Our talk that day was <br/>
one of the most interesting he and I have ever had. That happened <br/>
again when Jody (22) and I saw a video clip of the current favorite - <br/>
something about Shady&#39;s back? - just before we drove out the Alaska <br/>
Highway last July. One day as we were driving along the song came on <br/>
the radio, she mentioned the video, and we spent the next 200 miles <br/>
talking about the music industry, eminem&#39;s run-ins with the law, his <br/>
cleverness in putting lyrics together, artists making comebacks, and <br/>
she told me about several musicians she&#39;s been enjoying listening to <br/>
that I&#39;d never heard of. One, Ani deFranco, is coming to Anchorage <br/>
next month and I&#39;m thinking of buying her a ticket to the performance <br/>
if she doesn&#39;t have to work that day.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, whenever I hear an eminem song these days, I think about <br/>
those talks the kids and I might not otherwise have shared. Like most <br/>
artists, he&#39;s just another source of food for thought, which is all I <br/>
think he ever really meant to be. Well... he probably meant to be <br/>
rich, too... &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285179986">We live in a lower-income neighborhood where drugs, gangs, and <br/>
teenage pregnancy are part of the reality many kids live every day.  <br/>
When these children don&#39;t have anyone with whom they can discuss the <br/>
ideas expressed in the music they listen to, the results can be <br/>
deadly.  Many young men of the &quot;underclass&quot; live lives where the gun-<br/>
toting, bit*h smacking, misogynistic, racist, homophobic, and <br/>
sociopathic ideals expressed in rap music do nothing to improve their <br/>
day-to-day existences.  So, perhaps gangsta rap is best enjoyed by <br/>
those who don&#39;t have to personally deal with the reality that fuels <br/>
the lyrics.</div>

And what music should be imposed on those who live a rough life without <br/>

<br/>
Would there be less violence without accompanying music?  If the music and <br/>
dress and tattoos and slang were forbidden or discouraged would that calm <br/>
everyone down?<br/>
<br/>
Refusing to listen to expressions of frustration doesn&#39;t lessen the <br/>
frustration either.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know an answer, but I know there&#39;s not a simple solution.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288813658">Removing the music isn&#39;t a simple solution, of course.  And, I never <br/>
suggested that their frustrations shouldn&#39;t be listened to.  But, if <br/>
the subculture of the gang and prison culture becomes musically <br/>
mainstreamed into neighborhoods that are already unstable, the <br/>
result, as I said before, can be disastrous.  <br/>
