<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074469387">Go to a credit counseling service.  They can consolidate all of your debts <br/>
and sometimes the credit companies will even decrease your interest rate to <br/>
0%.  I felt that I HAD to stay home after my son was born because our <br/>
babysitting arrangements fell through.  I had worked out with my company to <br/>
work at home.  That helped some.  I worked for them for 6 years at home, but <br/>
the work became sporadic, so it wasn&#39;t really income I could count on.<br/>
<br/>
We went through a credit counseling service and paid off our credit card <br/>
debt in 4 years!  It wasn&#39;t always easy, but it worked.  The downside to <br/>
this is that if you want to move before the time is up, you may have a hard <br/>
time getting a mortgage.  Most mortgage companies will not touch you until <br/>
you have been out of the program for a year.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I now work part-time for Barnes & Noble, because they are open until <br/>
11:00 pm so I don&#39;t have to go in until 6:00 pm and I work Saturday <br/>
mornings, so we still have 1 1/2 days as a family to spend together on the <br/>
weekend.  They have fairly decent benefits, from what I could see (since I <br/>
only work part-time, I didn&#39;t bother to check them extensively).  If you <br/>
could swing working a &quot;night&quot; shift to your husband&#39;s &quot;day&quot; shift, you could <br/>
get away with minimal babysitting, pocket some money and reduce your <br/>
benefits costs.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few ideas of what is working for us.<br/>

eliminate 12,000 in credit debt and save money in<br/>
about 2 years time with only one income of about<br/>
45,000/year. It can be done. <br/>
<br/>
Some ideas to make sure you can save money while you<br/>
are still working to make debt payment easier: <br/>
<br/>
Do once a month cooking so you always have food<br/>
thawing and ready to cook when you get home. That<br/>
could in itself cut your food bill in half. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295602521">The Tightwad Gazette is great. (but no, you can&#39;t have mine) Try Mary Hunt&#39;s<br/>
&quot;The Complete Cheapskate&quot;. It&#39;s current. She was over $100,000 in debt and<br/>
managed to work her way out of it and is now completely debt free.<br/>
<br/>
Also I recommend Consumer Credit Counseling. It&#39;s free! They were a huge<br/>
help to us when my husband was out of work while I was pregnant with my<br/>
2nd...and our health insurance suddenly decided they wouldn&#39;t cover our<br/>
midwife...and the car broke down...we actually came within hours of<br/>
foreclosure proceeding starting on our house. What a year. Anyway, CCC saved<br/>
us from the wolves. They work with your creditors and lower balances or at<br/>
least lower payments. They also have good advice (no preaching) on getting<br/>
by.<br/>
<br/>
I understand about the insurance. I kept working when I had just one child<br/>
partly because my insurance was so much better. But after awhile, it just<br/>
wasn&#39;t worth it. It comes down to: How much suffering can you stand before<br/>
you&#39;re willing to change your situation? I&#39;m not trying to say that in a<br/>
superior way. I just can&#39;t think of a better way to put it. And again, this<br/>
is a &quot;been there/done that&quot; for me. We are not rolling in money now, either.<br/>
In fact, my husband just walked away from his last job a week ago. It was<br/>
destoying his health. Now he is happily unemployed and we are over $140,000<br/>
in debt including the mortgage. &lt;yawn&gt; It will work out...it always does and<br/>
for the best, too.<br/>
<br/>
There are many home-based businesses. Too many probably. Or work that is<br/>
off-hour (nights, etc). Perhaps there&#39;s something out there for you or your<br/>
husband. Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608071087">That&#39;s what we&#39;ve done for the last year. I work full time because the <br/>
salary base in my field is higher than in his. He has been working part time <br/>
some to bring in some extra money, but our schedules are staggered so one of <br/>
us is always able to watch the kids (they are 2 1/2 and 1). This has been <br/>
very hard, we don&#39;t get to see each other nearly enough and are both <br/>
drained, but it has meant that our kids haven&#39;t had to go into daycare (not <br/>
an option, as far as we&#39;re concerned) and we&#39;ve been able to pay down a very <br/>
large credit card debt. Now that we&#39;ve busted our butts for the year, I&#39;m <br/>
going to go back to being the one home and he&#39;s going back to full-time <br/>
work. I may still need to work some, but we will play that by ear. For us, <br/>
it was a matter of deciding where our priorities were and making sacrifices <br/>
to meet them.<br/>

Since insurance is through you at the moment, maybe your husband would<br/>
like to stay home for a time to unschool?  Does he have any skills that<br/>
he could use in a telecommuting fashion?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147051125">We had trouble living on one income too. My husband does get insurance from <br/>
his employer but we have to pay for a large part of it. He works in <br/>
construction and though we think he is worth a fortune his employer does not <br/>
pay him one. I think it is easier to economize when children are younger. A <br/>
fun day at the park thrills them and so does homemade playdough. But as our <br/>
children got older there were many things they wanted to do, classes they <br/>
wanted to take, hobbies they wanted to pursue. It got tiresome to always say, <br/>
we cannot afford it. So I began selling items on ebay and it has made a <br/>
difference. I am not getting rich but it has given us extra money to pay off <br/>
those bills and go to karate classes and etc. I have a friend who needed more <br/>
income too so she got a weekend job. May not seem like the greatest idea <br/>
since it takes away from family togetherness time but at least there is <br/>
always her or her husband home with the kids and they can continue to <br/>
homeschool. I know another homeschooler here who has a job every afternoon <br/>
and the kids go with her. Could you switch to just part time? I have a <br/>
neighbor who does country type crafts and makes a nice amount of extra money <br/>
at craft fairs. (personally I hate making crafts). Figure up how much money <br/>
you need to pay the bills and shoot to make that amount. If you are home and <br/>
willing you can save a lot of money. Baby-sitting expense for one. Food <br/>
expense for another. Working out Clothing, eating out, movies, etc. I think <br/>
it wasn&#39;t until they were teens that my kids ever wore anything but garage <br/>
sale clothes. And they still would but their sizes are hard to find. Really <br/>
think hard about what you can cut out. You may be surprised. <br/>

your input though. I have not given up on the idea of unschooling. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-571542947"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:tgraves@...">tgraves@...</a><br/>
&gt;Currently I earn just about as much as<br/>
&gt; my husband. My employment covers the insurance. If he chose to go<br/>
&gt; with his companies insurance, it will get just as expensive as if we<br/>
&gt; went outside the system completely. Its just not worth it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When we were in that situation, my husband took a job that was at nighttime.<br/>
I worked the day shift, he worked the night so one of us was always home. It<br/>
wasn&#39;t the greatest (I would&#39;ve preferred not to work at all) and in fact at<br/>
some points it was just downright terribly hard to be away from my son, but<br/>
it was the best situation we could come up with until we got to the point<br/>
where we didn&#39;t need both incomes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We have a<br/>
&gt; large morgage to pay off as well as credit card debt. I will most<br/>
&gt; likely have to continue working this year. Try to get a large portion<br/>
&gt; of our debt behind us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some ideas - consolidate your debt with a home equity loan, go through<br/>
consumer credit counseling, try to figure out where you can totally cut back<br/>
so you don&#39;t continue to increase your debt. If mortgage is such a problem,<br/>
is there any way you can move to a less expensive area? Our move last year<br/>
took us from an area where houses were about $400,000 to one where you can<br/>
get a house for $100,000. Making such a move can reduce drastically or even<br/>
eliminate a mortgage.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; will probably have to go to public school until my husband and I<br/>
&gt; really know that she is not enjoying it and/or learning something. If<br/>
&gt; anyone has any other guidence, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well my only guidance would be to see what you can do to avoid this<br/>
situation. Personally, I believe that school is demoralizing, debilitating,<br/>
and destroys a child&#39;s ability to learn on their own - even for kids who<br/>
excel at it. It takes a lot of time to &quot;deschool&quot; (as many parents on this<br/>
list can attest) and so if you can avoid going through this, I would do so.<br/>
If you can&#39;t work it out to have one parent at home, are there any charter<br/>
schools in your area? Perhaps you have an option for a Waldorf or other<br/>
school that will have less of a negative impact than a traditional public<br/>
school? I realize that I come from a pretty radical bent, but I do think it<br/>
is worth not brushing this issue off, but instead giving it some serious<br/>
thought and brainstorming to see if you can come up with a better solution.<br/>
Perhaps you could share a nanny or tutor with other families for the hours<br/>
that you are not able to have a parent at home? There&#39;s a homeschooling<br/>
family I know who does this - both parents work different shifts but they<br/>
have a few hours a day where they are both gone and they do a nanny share.<br/>
Just some ideas to pursue..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-408234056">Thank you for your information. I&#39;m not sure if the credit card consolidation<br/>
would work or not because we really only have 1 now in use (we already combined<br/>
all the other debt to this one card with the lowest finance charges and other<br/>
benies) Its just that one is going to take us a long while to get under handle.<br/>
I really do not want to work different shifts  than my husband, I think that<br/>
alone will cause a lot of emotional problems for us. I will be looking into<br/>
trying to find something from home that I could do for up to 20 hrs/wk if for<br/>
any other reason to pay for medical/dental insurance that we would need to pick<br/>
up. Do you know any information regarding the tax issues when<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling? Are we allowed to get the same benefits or deductions<br/>
as a ps?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-146682854">Moving to a cheaper area would mean putting us in a <br/>
worse <br/>
neighborhood. We like our neighborhood. We purchased <br/>
our house as a <br/>

paid for it. <br/>

Would a flexible remortgage be an option then?  I know <br/>
the rates are much lower here than for credit cards and <br/>
other unsecured loans...  Use the extra value of your <br/>
home to reduce the interest rate on your debt...  We <br/>
had a &#39;fixer-upper, we thought we&#39;d done a lot to it, <br/>
we ended up selling it for a few thou less than we <br/>
thought it was worth :-(<br/>
<br/>
Ah, well, live and learn, huh?  It might look like I&#39;m <br/>
one to talk, when i don&#39;t know what we&#39;re doing with <br/>
our money, but I&#39;m not like most of the neighbours who <br/>
have bigger houses but aren&#39;t around during the day to <br/>
live in &#39;em, like what is the point...<br/>
