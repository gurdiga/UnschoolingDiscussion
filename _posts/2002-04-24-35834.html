Homeschooling is illegal in Germany.  Children go to school, period,<br/>
beginning at age 6 unless you petition the state to wait until age 7.  But<br/>
that&#39;s all the time you get.  It&#39;s a socialization issue for the Germans, in<br/>
the correct sense of the word.  They want their children socialized to be<br/>
good citizens of their society, and school is where that is taught.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s legal for us as U.S. military and civilians working for the U.S.<br/>
government to homeschool under the Status of Forces Agreements, because our<br/>
children&#39;s education is handled by an American government agency, not the<br/>
Germans.  However, if you are a U.S. citizen living in Germany, outside of<br/>
employment by the U.S. government (who sends us there &quot;involuntarily&quot;), you<br/>
have voluntarily chosen to live under German law.  I go to an American<br/>
church there, and had friends in the &quot;ordinary American citizen&quot; category<br/>
who have now moved back to the states because their oldest is 6, and they<br/>
don&#39;t want to school.<br/>
<br/>
In short, No.  You are not allowed to, as far as I understand.  I do know of<br/>
one family that homeschools underground, but it&#39;s illegal, they have to be<br/>
ridiculously careful, and it&#39;s not easy.  But that&#39;s another question.<br/>

&gt; I may have opportunity to work in Germany - you noted that homeschooling is<br/>
&gt; illegal in Germany - are you legal because you are an American citizen - or<br/>
&gt; because you are military.  I was just curious, because this will be a deciding<br/>
&gt; factor for me. If I am an ordinary working person - but an American, am I<br/>
&gt; allowed to homeschool/unschool while living there?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any info :)<br/>
