<div id="ygrps-yiv-726186707">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
     I just wanted to say thanks to Lisa for playing cards with Jessica at the LAL conference.  She too is not reading yet (just turned 9). Since my other two came out of school, after they had learned to read, she if my first real test.  Before the conference, I reminded her that some of the other older unschoolers were not reading yet either.  I knew about Holly, of course, and introduced them.  (To Sandra:  My husband, Jess and I had fun playing freeze tag with Holly and another friend. Mattie? in the pool).  I will make sure to include Roxy&#39;s name in our support system.  I think there was a good article on reading in one of the Life is Learning magazine that we received at the conference.  I am going to copy it and give it to family. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Beth in MD  <br/>

Cool!  Thanks, and I hope meeting Holly and seeing she&#39;s not alien-like or <br/>
dull-eyed helped people have courage in the face of later reading.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll pass your note on to Holly, too!<br/>
