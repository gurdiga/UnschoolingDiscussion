&gt; to shout it out:) I have been reading and reading for four months now and <br/>
&gt; now I just come on specifically to see what Sandra says. I don&#39;t know how <br/>
&gt; you became this wonderful, but you truly are wonderful, (and I don&#39;t even <br/>
&gt; know ya) I just feel so grateful to have come on here and been turned on to <br/>
&gt; this way of thinking about my children. Just the whole TRUSTING our <br/>
&gt; children is sooo empowering to them and to us. I keep saying to my two year <br/>
&gt; old all the time now when she is trying to destroy her sister, &quot;come here, <br/>
&gt; I like it when you are near me.&quot; and she feels so great about it, I want to <br/>
&gt; be with her, and she wants to be with me too! This was Sandra&#39;s advise and <br/>
&gt; I am so blessed:) Thanks , Kelli <br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just wanted to say that I got to meet Kelli&#39;s delightful older daughter <br/>
Molly and Kelli&#39;s very cool mom the other day. Molly and my son Julian are <br/>
taking a freshwater biology class at Mass Audubon. I look forward to meeting <br/>
Kelli, too.<br/>

We&#39;ve recently enhanced our Simpsons &quot;curriculum&quot; with Futurama DVDs.  A<br/>
whole new universe of cultural references. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
