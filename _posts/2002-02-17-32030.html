If everyone in your house sat down and voted on what to do &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>
wise and 3 out of 5 voted to do workbooks on a daily basis, you wouldn&#39;t<br/>
call it unschooling.  so why call a school that operates on that basis an<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; school?<br/>
<br/>
Not to say that I don&#39;t think Sudbury&#39;s are great.  If one has to have ps,<br/>
then I vote for all to become Sudbury schools.<br/>

&gt; I would consider Sudbury Valley schools to be an unschool school.<br/>
&gt; Maybe it should be an unschooling institution though instead of<br/>
&gt; school. (And if that particular program actually follows the<br/>
&gt; Sudbury Valley model.)<br/>

staying on campus. (And mandatory attendence may be a state requirement.)<br/>
Some parents do set their own rules that the kids need to stay on the school<br/>
grounds.<br/>

Or at least that&#39;s how it is at the original in Framiningham MA.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Attendance is based upon state laws. Just like my son is required to <br/>
attend homeschool in NY according to state law required hours. I <br/>
can&#39;t avoid it at home anymore than they can avoid it in their <br/>
institution.<br/>
<br/>
The democratic process doesn&#39;t mean that the ones that want to do <br/>
workbooks can make the others do it by voting on it. It means that <br/>
the budget, the staff (there are no teachers) members are voted in or <br/>
out, and other non-cirruculum stuff is voted on. They also use a <br/>
judicial committee to handle complaints between students. So in <br/>
essence, its the non-coercive parenting type things that are <br/>
democratic. The cirriculum is not. Each child is allowed to pursue <br/>
their own paths. If a bunch of them get-together because they all <br/>
want to learn something like basket-weaving, then they can vote it <br/>
into the budget to hire a bonafide basket-weaver to teach them.<br/>
<br/>
The age mixing, the ability to have many kinds of adults around of <br/>
with differing abilities to help you when you want to pursue <br/>
something is, in my opinion, far better than unschooling at home.<br/>
<br/>
SV has a basic set of principles, then each school develops it&#39;s <br/>
own &#39;flavour&#39; in addition to the principles that allow them to be <br/>
called Sudbury.<br/>
