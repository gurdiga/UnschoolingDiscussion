This brought back a memory.  In fourth grade, which was 1974, my teacher told <br/>
us that by 1984 we would all be wearing masks because the air would be so <br/>
polluted we wouldn&#39;t be able to breathe without them.  Critical thinking, Janice, <br/>

My fourth grade teacher told us in 1964 that by the time we were grown there <br/>
would be little hand-held calculators that cost less than $100.   I thought <br/>
she was really crazy.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 23 or so, I got a FREE calculator, solar powered, for subscribing <br/>
to Newsweek.  She was right.<br/>
<br/>
But other predictions about flying cars and people having to subsist on pills <br/>
because we woudln&#39;t be able to raise food or grow plants, predictions about <br/>
under-ocean cities and colonies on the Moon didn&#39;t even nearly come true.<br/>
