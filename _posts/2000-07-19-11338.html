 </span></blockquote>Yes, but I don&#39;t know how helpful it would be.  If you&#39;ve ever had raw cow&#39;s <br/>
milk, you know that the taste between that and the stuff you get at the store <br/>
is pretty drastically different!  But, go to the cooking aisle at the grocery <br/>
store, canned milk section and you&#39;ll probably find a box or can of goat&#39;s <br/>
milk.  They may also have it fresh in the dairy section.<br/>
<br/>
I was raised on goat&#39;s milk.  From 6 yr&#39;s old, I helped with the care of the <br/>
goats.  By 10 they were my job entirely...including milking, veterinary care <br/>
and birthing.  It is much easier to handle the care of a goat than a <br/>
cow...especially if you want the whole family involved.  Also, goat&#39;s milk is <br/>
often easier to digest than cow&#39;s.  If allergies are an issue in your family, <br/>
you may get ahead even more by avoiding allergens in the goats feed.  Be <br/>
careful what you feed the goat because the milk flavor changes (i.e. give it <br/>
lots of peaches or peach peels and you&#39;ll get milk that tastes much different <br/>
than fed only on grain and hay!).  Believe almost all the stories you hear <br/>
about goats eating everything in sight.  Most of them are true, with the <br/>
exception of small children and tin cans.  LOL  (they do like the glue on the <br/>
cans and can be a friendly lot, which leads to &#39;nibbling&#39; on people.  I never <br/>
received any more injury from a goat than getting my foot stepped on and <br/>
bruised...once.)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t bother keeping a billy goat on the same property with a nanny!  The <br/>
billy goat hormones/phermones will cause the milk to smell and taste <br/>
different...it can be quite nasty.  Besides you only need a billy around for <br/>
breeding...for that you can transport the nanny for a visit to a local <br/>
breeder or artificial inseminate.  Believe me, billy goats smell!  Nannies <br/>
only are not at all bad.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been out of town (and on no mail) for a few days...so if this little <br/>
rant of mine has nothing at all to do with the current thread...my apologies! <br/>
 It&#39;ll either be the start of a new one or cheerfully (I hope!) ignored.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745572163">I have always wanted a goat! We live in the city and although we have a good <br/>
size back yard for here, i have heard there are no farm animals allowed in <br/>
the city limits. SIGH!!! I woudl think a girl goat, if they don&#39;t smell, <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be any more annoying to neighbors than a dog though. Do goats make <br/>
noise or try to run off?<br/>
