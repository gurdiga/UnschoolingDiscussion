       I&#39;ll never know if she could have enjoyed as much astonishing success <br/>
as a self-motivated mathematical mind as she&#39;s enjoying as an unschooled <br/>
literary mind. I really do wish I could undo whatever damage my &quot;teaching&quot; attempts <br/>
caused. But OTOH, thank goodness all is not lost. :)  JJ<br/>

<br/>
My 4 year old woke me up yesterday. &quot;Mommy, MOmmy&quot;. &quot;What Luke, I&#39;m <br/>
sleeping&quot;.  &quot;2 and 2 makes 4!&quot;  &quot;Yes, Luke it does (closing my eyes <br/>
again)&quot;.  &quot;Mommy, Mommy, don&#39;t you want to know how me knows&quot;  &quot;How <br/>
do you know Luke?&quot;  &quot;Because me was sleeping on two pillows on your <br/>
bed, then me got two pillows from my bed, and now me is sleeping on <br/>
four!&quot;   (He does that with his pronouns, saying me when he should <br/>
say I, saying we when he should us--is that normal for a 4 1/2 year <br/>
old?)<br/>
<br/>
And later (when I was awake and thinking clearly! lol)  I thought how <br/>
cool it was that he figures stuff out like that without anyone <br/>
teaching it to him.  And I thought how my daughter (now 10) never did <br/>
that.  But maybe if I hadn&#39;t been trying so hard to teach her, she <br/>
would have.   <br/>

Yes, it&#39;s normal, and I think 2 of my kids did it (especially my son).  I <br/>
never corrected them, they figured it out by themselves eventually.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks. :)  My other two kids didn&#39;t do it and although I know it&#39;s a <br/>
normal thing for toddlers to do, I thought maybe by 4 1/2 most kids <br/>
have outgrown it.  I&#39;m glad you added that sigh at the end, because <br/>
it reminded me that I shouldn&#39;t be in too much of a hurry for him to <br/>
grow up and that maybe I should just enjoy it when he says, &quot;Me loves <br/>
you so much, mommy&quot;. :)  <br/>
