Really?  You don&#39;t know whether you &quot;fully buy in&quot; or not?<br/>
It&#39;s clear that you don&#39;t. :-)<br/>
But no one asked you to &quot;buy in.&quot;  And if you DO consider your beliefs  <br/>
and make adjustments, it shouldn&#39;t be because it&#39;s &quot;the radical  <br/>
unschooling view.&quot;  It should be because you&#39;ve seen a flaw in the way  <br/>
you&#39;re doing things now and would prefer to change your stance.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The reason that happened is because you limited it and then lifted the  <br/>
limit.<br/>
Because you restored the limitations (it was &quot;just an experiment,&quot; and  <br/>
a temporary condition) it can be expected to happen exactly that way  <br/>
the next time you &quot;try it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The first time, your children probably expected you to put the rules  <br/>
back in place, so they might have eaten as much as they could before  <br/>
you shut the door on it again.  Your children were right.   So the  <br/>
next time you allow some more candy, they will binge, assuming that  <br/>
you will once again (as before) say &quot;no more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rather than it being parental control or &quot;no control,&quot; try just being  <br/>
more generous and saying &quot;okay&quot; a bit more.<br/>

<br/>
This is important.  Just yesterday on another list I reported part of  <br/>
a conversation I had had, in which I said &quot;Children don&#39;t exist to  <br/>
make parents feel good.&quot;  You&#39;ve chosen to tell us that your children  <br/>
have a desire (your word) but your comfort is more important.  Your  <br/>
children don&#39;t exist to help you be comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Since trying this, they food choices that they accepted and seemed  <br/>
to want has dramatically decreased. They get very stung out as do I.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Did you mean to say &quot;strung out&quot;?  Did you mean to use a heroin-addict  <br/>
reference to describe the effect of candy on a toddler, and on yourself?<br/>

This discussion comes up several times a year on one discussion or  <br/>
another, and over that time some of the best parts have been collected  <br/>
here:<br/>

There&#39;s a Halloween page I usually point people toward in October, but  <br/>
this year I forgot and I was in India for Halloween.  We did trick or  <br/>
treat inside the house, with three people stationed behind three doors  <br/>
with candy.  It wasn&#39;t quite the same.  The party was great, though!   <br/>
I did the Mario hat and buttons, and brought the overalls from New  <br/>
Mexico where they&#39;re plentiful:<br/>

<br/>
A focus on what is fun and wonderful is better than a focus on  <br/>
discomfort.  Candy can be fun and wonderful.  A parent saying &quot;no&quot; and  <br/>
calling joy &quot;strung out&quot; isn&#39;t nearly as fun or as wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s that Halloween page: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/eating/halloween">http://sandradodd.com/eating/halloween</a><br/>

<br/>
I hope you&#39;ll read that whole section, though, which contains the  <br/>
happiest discoveries of MANY parents over many years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446952694">A day isn&#39;t a trial, it&#39;s a party. A party is a very different experience to <br/>
saying yes more. It&#39;s a small moment in a life. It&#39;s a good time, it&#39;s a <br/>
glorious day, but it doesn&#39;t fundamentally change someone&#39;s experience with the <br/>
world. Or, at least not usually. <br/>
<br/>
When I was early to unschooling the food idea really was a hard one to get my <br/>
mind around. I&#39;d trusted the idea that humans were hunter-gatherers who focussed <br/>
on fats and sugars as rare good foods for so long that it was hard to see that <br/>
it was a point that could be debated. There was a mom on Always Learning who was <br/>
testing it out. She had a boy who liked ice cream a lot. Rather than put ice <br/>
cream in front of him and say go for it, she started saying yes to his requests. <br/>
So, he had ice cream for breakfast, and  then ice cream again, and then some <br/>
more ice cream. She wrote about having to get a coat on and go out to the <br/>
freezer in the garage to get more ice cream. But she kept writing about it. And <br/>
over the course of a few days his enjoyment of each succeeding bowl of ice cream <br/>
began to wane. <br/>
<br/>
I waited for each instalment. I talked to David. I was fascinated by the idea. <br/>
We decided to say yes more. To move slowly, but inexorably, toward a home where <br/>
food choice was the norm. There was a day when it seemed all Simon ate was <br/>
doughnuts. There were days when I found myself counting the bags of cheese puffs <br/>
(small, single serving bags are the norm in the UK) that Linnaea ate. When I <br/>
found myself fretting more, growing more nervous I would keep a food diary. Not <br/>
publicly, not &quot;let&#39;s see what we are eating&quot;, but quietly, just writing down <br/>
what Simon and Linnaea and I were eating over the course of a week or two or <br/>
three. Each time I found that what may have looked like a day of bingeing was a <br/>
small part of a bigger picture of balance. A day of doughnuts was followed by a <br/>
week without doughnuts. It really made a difference to step back and see more <br/>
forest and fewer individual trees. It also helped me to offer more food to them. <br/>
Instead of being passive in my role as caregiver, bringing them platters of <br/>
food, making sure that bags of cheese puffs weren&#39;t the only easy to grab food <br/>
in the house, making sure that their choice wasn&#39;t just about what they could <br/>
grab easily, what would sustain them without pulling them away from what they <br/>
were doing. Or, if it was about what they could grab the most easily, making <br/>
sure that there were lots of easy to grab options. <br/>
<br/>
It is also really important to remember that there are different food <br/>
requirements for growth and development than there are for maintenance and <br/>
repair. So, just as a pregnant woman has very different dietary requirements <br/>
than a pre-pregnancy woman, so a young child does to an adult. Brain growth <br/>
thrives on fats and sugars. The difference between breastmilk for a newborn and <br/>
for a toddler can demonstrate that pretty quickly. It isn&#39;t just because a <br/>
newborn is deriving all of his or her calories from breastmilk, it is also <br/>
because they are still developing so much, so quickly. The growth rate is so <br/>
steep. What may feel like a very healthy diet to you, what may help you to feel <br/>
better and more focussed, may be absolutely sub-par for your young children. It <br/>
may help to think about the foods that tasted really good to you as a child and <br/>
how much less good they taste to you now. And that isn&#39;t simply because children <br/>
have more taste buds than adults. Although that does go some way to explaining <br/>
why bitter foods like spinach aren&#39;t always well loved by young children, <br/>
although Linnaea and Simon both really liked and like it. Simon used to eat <br/>
bowls of raw spinach. Your change in taste and preference is about what you need <br/>
to thrive. It has changed. <br/>
<br/>
One last idea. Simon and Linnaea have a relationship with food that is <br/>
completely different to mine. I&#39;m getting there, but I still have a few hang <br/>
ups. They eat what they enjoy without worrying about the emotional aspect of the <br/>
food. We went trick or treating on Halloween. Simon didn&#39;t want to get the <br/>
candy, so he just walked the route. Linnaea wanted the whole experience and we <br/>
walked maybe 3 miles or so in a little town and she got a small bag of <br/>
goodies--the UK just isn&#39;t trick or treating ready. I think she&#39;s eaten 3 or 4 <br/>
things from the bag. And that was on the first night. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s even <br/>
opened it since. I, on the other hand, would have eaten everything within a day <br/>
or two and then tried to find where my brother had hidden his stash. I used to <br/>
sit on the floor and pick all the marshmallows out of Lucky Charms cereal. Or <br/>
live off of poptarts, or eat all the candy I was supposed to sell for a <br/>
school fund-raiser and have to buy it out of my paper route money. Food isn&#39;t <br/>
about the limits and loading and emotions. Food is what you are hungry for, what <br/>
you enjoy. Most often Simon or Linnaea ask for things like risotto or phat Thai <br/>
or samosas or ham sandwiches. They don&#39;t tend to ask for sweet things. Although <br/>
they did come up to bed last night very keen to get supplies in so that they <br/>
could bake pies. They want pears and raspberries and cherries and apples and <br/>
whip cream and they want root beer floats to accompany. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Coming to unschooling from a rules based point of view -- as most  <br/>
parents do -- it&#39;s natural to try to shape what&#39;s being written into  <br/>
rules.<br/>
<br/>
But unschooling is:<br/>
<br/>
Great relationships<br/>
Joyful living and learning<br/>
<br/>
Some of the principles that support that are:<br/>
<br/>
Trust<br/>
Respect<br/>
Kindness<br/>
Compassion<br/>
Helpfulness<br/>
<br/>
Having someone help you get what you want, is joyful. Even for  <br/>
adults :-) Having someone stand between you and what you want tends to  <br/>
make people angry.<br/>
<br/>
But there is no rule that says &quot;Give your child everything they ask  <br/>
for.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t even a rule that says &quot;Always do what makes your child  <br/>
happiest.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What there are are thoughtful choices. And in order to make thoughtful  <br/>
choices it takes examination of fears, it takes understanding human  <br/>
nature, it takes a knowledge of what builds and tears down  <br/>
relationships between people, it takes an understanding of children&#39;s  <br/>
innate expectations of us, it takes seeing the world through your  <br/>
children&#39;s understanding and needs.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a lot of knowledge and understanding just to answer the  <br/>
question: &quot;Do I let my kids eat all the candy they want?&quot; ;-) *But*  <br/>
what&#39;s great about it, is that all the knowledge and understanding  <br/>
apply to every question with kids, not just candy.<br/>
<br/>
You shouldn&#39;t just hand your kids candy and say go at it if you&#39;re  <br/>
full of fear and full of a need to have them choose only as much as  <br/>
you&#39;d choose for them. What that says, if they&#39;re sensitive to body  <br/>
language which kids often are, is &quot;I don&#39;t care any more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To let go of the fear, read about unschoolers experiences with free  <br/>
access to food. Find out what really happens rather than what parents  <br/>
fear will happen. Find out why the transition from control to freedom  <br/>
can sometimes can look like conventional parents are right that food  <br/>
needs controlled ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Often the discussions about food, sleep, tv, violence and so forth  <br/>
read as if radical unschoolers values towards those are just  <br/>
different. We&#39;re either just ignorant of the &quot;facts&quot; or we just don&#39;t  <br/>
care about our kids health and safety. It&#39;s easy hand a kid a pack of  <br/>
Doritos when you don&#39;t know what&#39;s in them and haven&#39;t read the  <br/>
effects! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But in fact, unschoolers are way more likely to have stepped back away  <br/>
from the issues to look at them objectively and to see them in the  <br/>
light of growing better relationships and living life more joyfully.  <br/>
It&#39;s not a knee jerk rejection or a decision to be blind to the  <br/>
&quot;evidence&quot; that supports people&#39;s fears. It a decision to really take  <br/>
the fear out and examine it to see if the &quot;facts&quot; support what really  <br/>
happens in unschooling homes. To really dig into the practices and see  <br/>
what the causes and effects are for unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-363583817">When I grew up I had very limited access to candy.  My brother was quite ill and his special diet (which included daily cod liver oil) was given to me as well.   The only time I had access to sweets was when I performed, or went to concerts and there was a reception.  I was also the only kid there who had their plate overflowing with everything and anything I could put on it.  Often at my house I would find empty candy wrappers and ice cream containers which I was told (by my mother) were from long agoshe &quot;didn&#39;t know how they got there.&quot;  Years later I found that she too had had a constricted diet and hid the food she ate from us. <br/>
Jump forward to this last Halloween and the party my children attended the day before (all of us attended).  When we walked through the door the first thing I noticed was the cake, pizza, and chocolate everywhere.  So apparently did many of the other kids who came through the door (we belong to one group which is unschooled/homeschooleddifference mainly being restrictions on bedtimes, food, TV. etc.)  My kids (who have had free access to food since they were born), said &quot;no mom we don&#39;t want that, we want to play,&quot; despite the fact they had just been complaining about hunger 30 seconds earlier in the car.  I sat and watched while other kids were made to eat a certain number of pieces of pizza, or vegetables before they could have the cake, or chocolate.  (as if pizza is any better really!).  Finally about two hours into the party, my eldest ( 5 1/2 ) ran over and asked for food.  What he chose to eat was a large plate of tomatoes and snap peas.  Parents asked me how I got him to do this   (I am thinking maybe they didn&#39;t notice that my youngest (4)had already eaten a few chocolate ghouls without me getting upset...)<br/>
My point is, my children have had a lot of exposure to many foods.  They have foods they like, and those they do not like.  I have never forced them into trying a food they were not interested in trying.  I would not want someone forcing me to try something I thought looked disgusting. Even though we now have a large shopping bag full of candy from trick or treating they are not diving into it (like I would have) as if it is the best thing in the world.  It is just another part of food.  Not more important.  I think allowing them to make their own food choices has been the best thing I could have done for them because they will not have the baggage that I did (and my mom) attached to it.  <br/>
Ohafter the piñata broke the kids helped gather the candy but refused to take any home because they said they didn&#39;t need any.  (Their words, not mine).   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296506097">-=-. Finally about two hours into the party, my eldest ( 5 1/2 ) ran  <br/>
over and asked for food. What he chose to eat was a large plate of  <br/>
tomatoes and snap peas. Parents asked me how I got him to do this� -=-<br/>
<br/>
That post was beautiful, and I added it to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/eating/sweets">http://sandradodd.com/eating/sweets</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen it happen many times, and people have asked me &quot;How do you  <br/>
get them to do that?&quot;<br/>
I didn&#39;t &quot;get them to do that.&quot;  I prevented their preference for  <br/>
sugar by allowing them to have all they wanted.  And &quot;all they wanted&quot;  <br/>
was never very much.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with people who restrict sugar (or TV, or play, or  <br/>
computer games or singing, or reading...) is that they have imagined  <br/>
it will never end if it starts.  &quot;If you give them an inch, they&#39;ll  <br/>
take a mile.&quot;    Or worse, people have chose to write things like this  <br/>
about their own children:<br/>
<br/>
I have a son who&#39;d eat flour and sugar all the time.<br/>
if there is junk in the house my 3 yo will eat that and nothing else  <br/>
if i let him<br/>
<br/>
I do know that my son would eat trash and dead birds if I let him, so  <br/>
in that way I am not permissive. (the mother of a 22 month old wrote  <br/>
that in 2007<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you that if my children could do WHATEVER they wanted they  <br/>
would be wild. My 3 yr old would eat until he pukes and my 4 yr old  <br/>
would get into so much trouble...<br/>
<br/>
If left to his own devices, my son would eat sugar all day.<br/>
If left on their own, they will see nothing wrong with eating junk  <br/>
food all day.<br/>
<br/>
He will choose to go without food and just eat sweets if allowed.<br/>
<br/>
My son would subsist on sweets if I didn&#39;t occasionally intervene and  <br/>
tell him that he&#39;s free to graze on &quot;junk food&quot; after he eats  <br/>
nutritious foods (fruits, veggies, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
I hope the parents who wrote those things are ashamed they ever  <br/>
thought such things now.  Either they&#39;ve changed their ways and their  <br/>
dire predictions didn&#39;t come true, or they clung to their beliefs and  <br/>
their children are likely to be those who fill their plates up with  <br/>
candy as soon as they get to a Halloween party.<br/>

<br/>
I find it&#39;s nice to get reassurance when trying something new.  My kids have always had free food choice.  I think because we don&#39;t make a big deal about things, things are therefore not a big deal.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that what people say about sugar or caffeine amping kids up and making them crazy doesn&#39;t seem to apply to us.  Makes me wonder how much expectation and assumption affects our experience.<br/>
<br/>
Food interests arise here just like toy interests arise.  Sometimes life becomes all about that interest for a while.  We&#39;ve had mac-n-cheese, ice cream, and soda phases here, to name a few.  <br/>
<br/>
The ice cream journey happened when my son was three.  I think it was ice cream about five or six times a day for a few days, then ice cream 2-3 times a day for a few weeks, then ice cream daily, usually once, for about a month.  Now ice cream one a week or once per month, or maybe we forget about it for a few months.<br/>
<br/>
Some phases are pretty impressive, like the cheese ball phase.  I did not know the body of a small child could contain that much!  No commentary from us about &quot;you&#39;re going to get sick,&quot; and no getting sick happening. I do remember my eyes bugging out.<br/>
<br/>
Watching food has taught me a lot about getting what I expect.  When I don&#39;t expect ill effects, they don&#39;t seem to happen, not that I can always control what I expect.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I still do have that healthy/not healthy dividing line in my head.  I don&#39;t share that out loud with my kids, but I&#39;m aware of its presence.  I put the stuff in the &quot;healthy&quot; category out for them, and they eat it or not.  I&#39;d say they usually eat it and sometimes not at all.<br/>

It says TV, but it uses food examples, and applies to anything.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;ve noticed that what people say about sugar or caffeine amping kids up and making them crazy doesn&#39;t seem to apply to us. Makes me wonder how much expectation and assumption affects our experience.-=-<br/>

(first link, about sugar)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Watching food has taught me a lot about getting what I expect. When I don&#39;t expect ill effects, they don&#39;t seem to happen, not that I can always control what I expect. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Even when a mom does expect ill effects, they probably don&#39;t happen.  In my mother&#39;s antagonistic way, she frequently cursed me with the &quot;If you do X, Y is going to happen, and don&#39;t come crying to me.&quot;  I did X, Y did NOT happen, and she was one of the last people I would have gone to even if I did need comfort.<br/>
<br/>
When someone entitles a topic something like &quot;Battle with candy...&quot; I figure the mother is up for a fight.<br/>
I seriously doubt that the candy was fighting back.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848891477">I always have candy at my house.  Probably way more candy than the average household.  My nephew who is 10 always takes a gallon ziploc home filled to the brim with candy he finds around at my house.  My children (now grown) were always allowed candy and it more often than not got tossed months after Halloween, Easter, any big candy event.  Fast forward to raising grandchildren.  Three girls, the oldest two are 4 and the youngest is 17 months.  They&#39;ve all had candy.  They all like candy.  The baby is kind love crazy with the candy, but it&#39;s still new to her of course.<br/>
<br/>
Valentines Day just came.  Their Granddaddy gave each little girl a half pound box of minature chocolates (about half the normal size of a boxed chocolate).  I let each girl open theres and I opened the baby&#39;s for her and let her choose.  She dug in with both hands, stuffing her little cheeks with chocolates, nodding her head in approval and delight.  The big girls ate two pieces each and closed up their heart boxes.  Anna stood in front of hers with chocolate spilling out the edges of her mouth and having a wonderful time.  <br/>
<br/>
Her mom later asked me how much I &quot;let&quot; Anna eat.   I told her she probably ate slightly less than half of the half pound box.  She demanded I check and see how much see actually ate (thinking it was much more than that since I just gave her the box).  Anna, the 17 month old crazy lover of candy had eaten FOUR PIECES before she was done for the day.<br/>
<br/>
We are nearly a week out from Valentines Day, we still have plenty of chocolate left in ther boxes.  A couple days Anna has wanted her box and ate a couple chocolates and then walked away.  They know it will be there when they want it, they don&#39;t have to eat it uncontrollably until it&#39;s all gone and then wish for more.  It&#39;s just a part of life.<br/>
<br/>
I have had children who&#39;ve come to parties unattended who ate and ate and ate candy/sweets until they did actually throw up.  I&#39;ve been chidded by parents for &quot;letting&quot; them eat that much.  I don&#39;t know at what point I should demand they stop really.  I&#39;ve never had to do that with my own children or my granddaughters.<br/>
<br/>
I think like anything, if it&#39;s readily available children can and will set their own limits.  I also don&#39;t experience that hyper, craziness that some claim their children exibit when they have anything with sugar.  Maybe those children are just giddy/hyper with delight that they&#39;ve finally gotten some of the forbidden sugar instead of a real chemical reaction in their bodies?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just trying to say it WILL work, your child will NOT eat only sweets the rest of their lives if you let them.  If you try to control those things, they will want them more than ever it seems by the children I&#39;ve seen who don&#39;t get sugar or have it rationed to them.<br/>

Hi, parent of two here, ages 5 & 2, craving some unschooling discussion after a computer hiatus. <br/>
<br/>

&gt; I just don&#39;t feel comfortable giving as much candy to my children aged 2 and 4 as they desire. I have tried <br/>
&gt; that for a day of so and that was all they ate. Since trying this, they <br/>
&gt; food choices that they accepted and seemed to want has dramatically <br/>
&gt; decreased. They get very stung out as do I. I would lovew to hear from <br/>
&gt; others who felt this way but found themselves through this to be <br/>
&gt; unschooling with food fully.<br/>
<br/>
I find it&#39;s nice to get reassurance when trying something new. My kids have always had free food choice. I think because we don&#39;t make a big deal about things, things are therefore not a big deal. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that what people say about sugar or caffeine amping kids up and making them crazy doesn&#39;t seem to apply to us. Makes me wonder how much expectation and assumption affects our experience.<br/>
<br/>
Food interests arise here just like toy interests arise. Sometimes life becomes all about that interest for a while. We&#39;ve had mac-n-cheese, ice cream, and soda phases here, to name a few. <br/>
<br/>
The ice cream journey happened when my son was three. I think it was ice cream about five or six times a day for a few days, then ice cream 2-3 times a day for a few weeks, then ice cream daily, usually once, for about a month. Now ice cream one a week or once per month, or maybe we forget about it for a few months.<br/>
<br/>
Some phases are pretty impressive, like the cheese ball phase. I did not know the body of a small child could contain that much! No commentary from us about &quot;you&#39;re going to get sick,&quot; and no getting sick happening. I do remember my eyes bugging out.<br/>
<br/>
Watching food has taught me a lot about getting what I expect. When I don&#39;t expect ill effects, they don&#39;t seem to happen, not that I can always control what I expect. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I still do have that healthy/not healthy dividing line in my head. I don&#39;t share that out loud with my kids, but I&#39;m aware of its presence. I put the stuff in the &quot;healthy&quot; category out for them, and they eat it or not. I&#39;d say they usually eat it and sometimes not at all.<br/>
