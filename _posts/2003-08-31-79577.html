 </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s the point.  They DON&#39;T have to.  I DON&#39;T make them.  <br/>
They aren&#39;t required to do ANYTHING.  And most of the time they <br/>
don&#39;t.   They don&#39;t have to make their beds, don&#39;t have to clean <br/>
their rooms, don&#39;t have to do dishes, don&#39;t have to take out the <br/>
trash, don&#39;t have to even get out of bed if they don&#39;t want to.  I <br/>
don&#39;t make them do ANYTHING.............<br/>
<br/>
And they don&#39;t volunteer for anything either.  They do exactly what <br/>
they want, which means I do everything.<br/>
<br/>
Are you suggesting that I shouldn&#39;t even ASK them to help, either?  <br/>
Even if they are free to say no?  Because I say, &quot;Would you like to <br/>
help me by cleaning the cat box?  and they don&#39;t mind saying, &quot;No, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t like to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My older son is 18, when is this desire to help out supposed to kick <br/>
in?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-557556469">Well then, I guess I need a definition of responsibility, because to <br/>
me, responsibility is doing those things that I have a duty to take <br/>
care of.  And we all have those kind of things.  <br/>
<br/>
So I am sitting here in my messy house thinking, I have a <br/>
responsibility to clean this up, but I don&#39;t want to, so why should <br/>
I?  Nobody else wants to share the responsibility, and I don&#39;t want <br/>
to do it, so why not just forget it?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how my son feels, and if you walk in his room right now, you <br/>
will see an unmade bed, piles of dirty clothes, dirty dishes, empty <br/>
glasses, food trash and empty food containers, and ants following a <br/>
little trail to his room because they know that&#39;s where the food <br/>
crumbs are.  You will walk by him and his hair stinks because he <br/>
refuses to take a shower and wash it.  Eventually this is going to <br/>
get to be a health hazard, but that&#39;s ok because we don&#39;t have to do <br/>
anything we don&#39;t WANT to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Where do we draw the line here?<br/>

&gt; that they should have asked first before getting it out. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess what I do in that situation is to make a place at the bar for them to <br/>
paint.  Or help them to find a more suitable place to paint where they can <br/>
spread out if it is a large project.  Or we can take the food in the livingroom <br/>
and they can have the table to paint on if the other places are too cluttered. <br/>
 A never ending situation here.  There is always something going on at the <br/>
tables.  Art projects, books everywhere, a lot of it mine.  LOL.  So much to do <br/>
and so little space.  <br/>
