Ann:  The &quot;We Stand for Homeschooling&quot; Resolution (announced here <br/>
last issue) has created a stir in the homeschooling community.  If <br/>
you haven&#39;t yet read the Resolution, please do so and discuss it with <br/>
your friends and family.  To whet your appetite, here is Sandi&#39;s <br/>
(Washington Home Education Network e-group) tidy summary:<br/>
&quot;I think it is an effort to keep that ever-expanding definition of <br/>
public schooling from assimilating homeschooling as a form of <br/>
education in which parents &#39;take direct responsibility by choosing a <br/>
curriculum, an approach to learning, and the principles and values on <br/>
which these are based.&#39;&quot;<br/>
Writing this newsletter convinces me that such assimilation is <br/>
possible, and that the opportunity for my children to independently <br/>
homeschool their own children is indeed at risk.  Perhaps that risk <br/>
will not play out today or tomorrow, but the squeeze on independent <br/>
homeschooling seems inevitable.  The Resolution is but one vision, <br/>
one first step. I promise to share more of my thinking on this issue <br/>
later.<br/>
Today though, as I prepared this report, I read each news story with <br/>
renewed attention -the essence of the Resolution burning in the back <br/>
of my mind. Many of these news stories point to amazing homeschooling <br/>
success, while other stories point squarely to the risk of <br/>
assimilation.  These stories speak louder than any argument, pro or <br/>
con.  I wonder: would any of these stories be in the news today if <br/>
thousands of homeschooling parents before us had not stood tall for <br/>
independent homeschooling?<br/>

HEM News & Commentary is a weekly report on what&#39;s happening in the <br/>
world of homeschooling. Gleanings from the news media, accolades and <br/>
pans, hot discussions, legal and legislative successes and problems - <br/>
all are fair game, and gathered in one column for your convenience.<br/>
<br/>
And just in case you don&#39;t have the time to read every word in print, <br/>
we will summarize and discuss key news and trends that we think are <br/>
the most provocative or that may have the greatest impact on the <br/>
future of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>

The weekly updates will additionally be announced on HEM&#39;s discussion <br/>
lists. You&#39;ll find a print version - the highlights of these reports <br/>
- in a column by the same name in Home Education Magazine.<br/>
