&lt;&lt; Sandra, weren&#39;t those the books you mentioned in your last HEM column as <br/>
just <br/>
sitting on the shelf?  You never know... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.  I added a note to the bottom of the page with that article.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to add a link to Henry Treece info if I find anything good, too.   <br/>
The books are more violent than most kids&#39; books are nowadays, and I doubt <br/>
they&#39;re as politically correct as they would be nowadays, but they&#39;ll still be <br/>
20th century sensibilities which are undoubtedly more politically correct than <br/>
11th century.   It&#39;s all relative.<br/>
<br/>
His book The Burning of Njal is a retelling of a saga which is still around <br/>
available to read, Njal&#39;s Saga.  He wrote his in 1964.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking at Google listings, and most of the sites on the first page there <br/>
are UK and Australian.  But for those with such an interest, keep an eye out <br/>
for those.  Interlibrary loan is possible, if the libraries haven&#39;t sold or <br/>
dumped them all.<br/>

Golden Strangers (The Invaders) 56; The Road to Miklagard 57; Red Queen, White <br/>

<br/>
Not all kids&#39; books, but most are.<br/>
This came from a page about science fiction, so I guess his aren&#39;t all <br/>
historical, but the ten or so we have are.</div>
