<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094234712">I buy reams of it and I don&#39;t say anything about how much they use. <br/>
I <br/>
have <br/>
some very artistic kids and I think it&#39;s due to giving them access <br/>
to <br/>
materials and not hording any of it.<br/>
I buy typing paper in large bundles, it&#39;s cheap and they can draw to <br/>
their <br/>
hearts content.<br/>
I keep the expensive artist quality paper put away and they ask me <br/>
for <br/>
a <br/>
piece of that, but I never, ever suggest it&#39;s wasted if they throw a <br/>
drawing <br/>
away.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I am the same way, Ren!   I find the cheapest paper possible and we <br/>
have stacks and stacks of it accessible and my children go wild with <br/>
it sometimes but produce some wonderful drawings and paintings, <br/>
too.  When I was in the hospital giving birth two years ago, my 4 <br/>
year-old was doing her thing, drawing a bit, throwing the paper down <br/>
because she was not satisfied, and my mother was just shocked and <br/>
insisted Emily draw on both sides of the paper and fill the paper <br/>
before she took another paper!  Needless to say, Emily burst into <br/>
tears and would not be consoled.  I had a real hard time explaining <br/>
to my mother that we never limited paper in our house!  (I grew up <br/>
drawing on brown paper sacks from the grocery store and newspapers <br/>
when we ran out of the brown sacks!)<br/>
