<div id="ygrps-yiv-249226446">Someone emailed me this today, made me feel pretty DUMB! :)<br/>
Enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  ARE YOU THE WEAKEST LINK?<br/>
<br/>
  Below are 4 questions. Answer them instantly. You can&#39;t take your time.<br/>
<br/>
  Answer them immediately. No pencil or paper! OK?<br/>
  Let&#39;s find out just how smart and clever you really are. Ready? ... GO!!!<br/>
<br/>
  FIRST QUESTION: You are participating in a race. You overtake the second<br/>
person. What position are you in?<br/>
<br/>
  ANSWER: If you answer that you are first, then you are absolutely wrong!<br/>
If you overtake the second person and you take his place, you are second!<br/>
Try not to screw up in the next question.<br/>
<br/>
  To answer the second question, don&#39;t take as much time as you took for the<br/>
first question. (You know you took too much time.)<br/>
<br/>
  SECOND QUESTION: If you overtake the last person, then you are...?<br/>
<br/>
  ANSWER: If you answered that you are second to last, then you are wrong<br/>
again. Tell me, how can you overtake the LAST person?!<br/>
<br/>
  THIRD QUESTION: Very tricky math! Note: This must be done in your head<br/>
only. Do NOT use paper and pencil or a calculator. Try it.<br/>
<br/>
  Take 1000 and add 40 to it.<br/>
  Now add another 1000.<br/>
  Now add 30.<br/>
  Add another 1000.<br/>
  Now add 20.<br/>
  Now add another 1000.<br/>
  Now add 10.<br/>
  What is the total?<br/>
<br/>
  ANSWER: Did you get 5000? The correct answer is actually 4100. Don&#39;t<br/>
believe it? Check with your calculator! Today is definitely not your day.<br/>
Maybe you will get the last question right?<br/>
<br/>
  LAST QUESTION: Mary&#39;s father has five daughters: Nana, Nene, Nini, Nono.<br/>
What is the name of the fifth daughter?<br/>
<br/>
  ANSWER: Nunu? Nana? Nene? NONO! Of course not. The fifth daughter&#39;s name<br/>
is Mary. Read the question again.<br/>
<br/>
  You ARE the WEAKEST LINK!! Pass this along to<br/>
  someone else who could stand a little fun and a<br/>
  challenge today!<br/>

growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
