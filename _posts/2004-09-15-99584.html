We&#39;re NOT Off to See the Wizard: <br/>
REVISITING  THE IDEA OF COLLEGE<br/>
By JOHN O. ANDERSEN<br/>
March 9, 2001 <br/>
<br/>
Doing the uncommon thing first requires we look at life  through different <br/>
eyes, and consider unusual approaches. <br/>
&quot;Cowards die many times before their  deaths; the valiant never taste of <br/>
death but once.&quot;<br/>
--William  Shakespeare from Julius Caesar Act II,  Scene 2.<br/>
<br/>
Our culture has more or less bought into the idea that  going to college is <br/>
just one of those things you&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to do.  Increasingly, parents feel <br/>
they are &quot;required&quot; to finance their children&#39;s  education even if it means <br/>
mortgaging themselves to the hilt or working crazy  hours. Few ever dare to <br/>
question this assumption, at least not in public. Yet,  my wife and I question it <br/>
and are happy to reveal our heretical thoughts to the  world. It&#39;s not that we <br/>
have anything against college per se, just that we see  things a bit <br/>
differently.  <br/>
Generally, we think college is a good choice for many.  It was a good choice <br/>
for me. I enjoyed exposure to a new world of ideas, and  people. I made <br/>
lifelong friends. I expanded my intellectual horizons. And  frankly, it was a fun <br/>
time.  <br/>
Nevertheless, since the years I attended college,  things have changed <br/>
somewhat. For instance, in many places careerism has all but  destroyed the notion <br/>
of a classical education. Not that careerism is necessarily  bad, but rather, <br/>
it seems to me that far too many colleges have transformed  themselves into <br/>
career training factories. Largely gone is the notion of  fostering renaissance <br/>
men and women in embryo, who are more intent on reforming  and improving <br/>
society rather than becoming just another cog in its machinery.  <br/>
Today&#39;s graduates may have superior vocational  training and more marketable <br/>
skills relative to the graduates of yesteryear.  However, their grasp of <br/>
social and political issues, breadth of knowledge, and  writing abilities are <br/>
probably less noteworthy. Even worse, apathy for these  skills is widespread.  <br/>
Over and over I read statistics that &quot;prove&quot; that even  with a much higher <br/>
price tag, the long-term benefits of a college education  still make it a <br/>
bargain. But sometimes I wonder whose interest is best served by  that &quot;proof&quot;: the <br/>
individual student&#39;s or that of the massive higher education  industry?  <br/>
Furthermore, I often question whether the &quot;doors of  opportunity&quot; which <br/>
college supposedly unlocks, actually lead to places where  people truly want to go. <br/>
Maybe the &quot;doors of opportunity&quot; are just the  passageway into an adulthood <br/>
of Babbittry.  <br/>
Could college attendance be a sign of cowardice?   Could it be a way to duck <br/>
from the scary thought of being who we really are  inside?  Could we do the <br/>
college thing mainly because that&#39;s what&#39;s  expected of us, or what everyone <br/>
else is doing, not because it&#39;s what we truly  should do?<br/>
At one time, I  bought into the conventional wisdom that although college <br/>
wasn&#39;t the only  option, most young people should aim for it. Then I met my wife, <br/>
Mandy. She grew  up in Canada and England. Her father&#39;s military career gave <br/>
her the advantage of  living in a variety of places. She is well-read, writes <br/>
better than most college  graduates I know, and is well-informed on a variety <br/>
of subjects. And, she has  never completed a college course.  <br/>
In addition to Mandy&#39;s influence, my choice to be  &quot;downwardly mobile&quot; had a <br/>
major impact. After more than a generous helping of  institutional higher <br/>
education, and having launched a successful white-collar  career, I felt confined. <br/>
My freedom came from quitting my job and opting for  manual labor. That step, <br/>
more than any other factor, opened my mind to a new  perspective. <br/>
Our primary reasons for questioning  college: <br/>
For us self-education is what sticks.  <br/>
We think that self-education with passion is the  learning which truly <br/>
becomes a part of us. We&#39;ve found we generally don&#39;t have  the same retention of the <br/>
&quot;learning&quot; we&#39;ve done in order to pass a test or get a  degree. We&#39;ve also <br/>
discovered institutional learning sometimes kills off any  interest we have in a <br/>
subject.  <br/>
Occasionally people tell me if I hadn&#39;t gone to  college I wouldn&#39;t be as <br/>
equipped to be a good self-learner. To a small extent I  agree, but in a larger <br/>
sense, I believe the passion to know is what makes a good  learner. It&#39;s not <br/>
the number of degrees after your name. <br/>
We prefer learning at a slower pace and savoring it  along the way. <br/>
My experience with &quot;learning&quot; in college was like  drinking from a fire <br/>
hydrant: too much, too fast. There was rarely ever enough  time to let things sink <br/>
in. Occasionally it made more sense to give up on  actually learning anything <br/>
and switch to &quot;binge and purge mode.&quot; In other words,  memorize what is <br/>
necessary to get the &quot;A&quot; and then purge it from the brain at  the end of the <br/>
semester to make room for the next binge.  <br/>
Why the big rush to stuff our brains? Learning, if it  is to take hold, is a <br/>
slow, lifelong process. We hope our children won&#39;t feel  pressured into the <br/>
bingeing and purging mode so as to miss the pleasure of  taking it slow and <br/>
savoring all of the joys along the way. <br/>
Answers to common objections <br/>
Over the years when we&#39;ve been vocal about our  questioning of college, we&#39;ve <br/>
been pelted with a variety of objections. Below  are four of the most common <br/>
ones and our responses:  <br/>
1.  You&#39;re pulling a slick one! You&#39;ve had a  &quot;generous helping&quot; of college, <br/>
yet you&#39;re going to deny your own children the  opportunity to even go to <br/>
college.  <br/>
We didn&#39;t say we&#39;re against college. We tell our  children that college is <br/>
only one of many valid options they may choose. Equally  valid would be a trade <br/>
school, an informal apprenticeship, or simply getting a  job doing something <br/>
they enjoy. We make it clear it&#39;s more important to listen  to their heart than <br/>
their peer group when it comes to structuring their life. We  don&#39;t pressure <br/>
them to choose one option above another. Rather, we will equip  them with the <br/>
knowledge and tools to enable them to choose from a variety of  paths.  <br/>
2.  If your children don&#39;t go to college  they&#39;ll be stuck in grunt jobs for <br/>
the rest of their lives.  <br/>
There are different interpretations of the term &quot;grunt  jobs.&quot; Many people <br/>
define such jobs as those requiring physical exertion.  Personally, I benefit <br/>
from my physically demanding job. It keeps me in shape,  gives me a constant <br/>
change of scenery, and provides abundant time for  contemplation. Not too shabby. <br/>
 <br/>
Jobs that punish creativity, force team play, and  pressure people to wear a <br/>
public face which is at odds with who they are inside,  could also be defined <br/>
as &quot;grunt jobs.&quot; If a &quot;grunt&quot; is someone who does  disagreeable work, <br/>
certainly people in such careers are in reality more like  &quot;grunts&quot; than an autonomous <br/>
janitor.  <br/>
3.  What about the intangibles of college:  exposure to new ideas, making <br/>
close friends, etc.? Aren&#39;t those alone worth the  price of tuition?  <br/>
College can be a way to acquire those intangibles. But  it&#39;s certainly not <br/>
the only or necessarily the best way. True learning demands  patience, an <br/>
inquiring mind and commitment. Shelling out the big bucks doesn&#39;t  foster those <br/>
traits. We like to believe that a lifetime of passionate hounding  of public <br/>
libraries is an excellent way to become educated. And that requires  zero financial <br/>
outlay. <br/>
And we don&#39;t need to open our wallets to gain true  friendships either. We <br/>
just need to open our hearts.  <br/>
4.  What if your children decide later in life  they want a career that <br/>
requires a degree? Wouldn&#39;t it have been better to have  earned that degree before <br/>
they took on the responsibilities of work and raising  a family?  <br/>
We think going back to school later in life can be a  great way to do it. <br/>
That is, if you truly want to learn something, and really  think you need a <br/>
degree.  <br/>
Getting through college while holding down a full-time  job and/or raising a <br/>
family can be a long slog. Yet, we feel such a task is not  impossible and is <br/>
actually getting easier with the proliferation of evening  programs, <br/>
correspondence courses, and Internet offerings. Personally, after  having entered the <br/>
work force, I got much more out of my formal studies. As an  inexperienced <br/>
college student between the ages of 18 and 22, I had only a vague  idea of what <br/>
goes on in the outside world. I lacked a practical sense of how  things actually <br/>
worked or didn&#39;t work. Hence, much of the &quot;learning&quot; didn&#39;t  register.  <br/>
Regardless of whether a person earns a first college  degree when they&#39;re 22 <br/>
or 62, or not at all, they will likely find that enjoying  a lifetime of <br/>
meaningful work (paid and non-paid) requires a lifetime of  learning. Some of this <br/>
may come through taking classes, but we like to believe  the bulk of it comes <br/>
through self-education. The degree to which people succeed  at teaching <br/>
themselves new skills, and pursuing interests for which they have a  passion, will <br/>
to a significant extent, determine their overall state of  happiness. <br/>
Conclusion <br/>
The seeds of learning already exist inside of us. We  don&#39;t have to be &quot;off <br/>
to see the wizard&quot; or pay tuition and room and board to  figure this out. We <br/>
simply need to believe it.  <br/>
College can be the best option for many  people. If it is for our children, <br/>
they&#39;ll go. But more importantly, we hope  they&#39;ll enjoy the freedom to choose <br/>
from a wide assortment of options without  pressure from the outside world to <br/>
choose one thing above another. After all,  they&#39;re the ones living their <br/>
lives, not the outside world. <br/>
