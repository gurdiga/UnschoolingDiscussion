<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206102164">Hi Caren,<br/>
I hope you can manage to relax a bit!  You may need to ask others about<br/>
de-schooling since my oldest dd only went to K.  Although,  my second dd<br/>
seems to have the &quot;I&#39;m-missing-out&quot; feeling becauseshe has three others her<br/>
age going to school. She wants to do &quot;schoolwork&quot; and &quot;homework&quot;<br/>
everyday.....but,  it&#39;s her decision.  She writes (i.e., copies mostly)<br/>
every day.  And doesn&#39;t want her friends to read before her.<br/>
<br/>
As to your disorganization....it &#39;reads&#39; to me like 9/11 has increased it.<br/>
At least know that reaction is not surprising.  This war is anxiety<br/>
producing....most people are having grief reactions,  or at least increased<br/>
stress reactions.  I know this is on-line and unschooling,  so I don&#39;t want<br/>
to offer mental health advice  in anything but generic form (?)....In all<br/>
seriousness,  your community may have mental health professionals available<br/>
at no charge....at least to speak to groups.  I know ours does because I<br/>
have volunteered.<br/>
On the other hand, your disorganization doesn&#39;t seem (through your e-mail)<br/>
to be that bad.....I have lived like that frequently!!  Check your sense of<br/>
humor...can you laugh about some/all of it?<br/>
<br/>
As to it effecting Max......I&#39;d say don&#39;t worry about that.  If you choose<br/>
to work on your level of organization and if you believe that will enhance<br/>
Max&#39;s life....well,then you are being an example of unschooling yourself.<br/>
There are many many books on organization/home management - and some on-line<br/>
resourses, too.  Personally,  I have had this &quot;housework is mundane&quot;<br/>
attitude until recently.  And our house was utter chaos usually.  When I it<br/>
began effecting my anxiety level and self esteem,  I began to work on it.<br/>
(We have four people of the younger persuasion here - household tasks are<br/>
neccesary to our functioning!)<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m currently seeking that balance between tidiness and &#39;room for<br/>
creative play&#39; (which involves allowing freedom to explore and can get<br/>
messy).  Our house is better....we do not have the yelling at each other<br/>
when we want/need to get out the door anymore...because of this increased<br/>
level of organization,  I have more time to actually pay attention to the<br/>
children!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; OK, OK, I admit it -- I AM scared!  Max (sometimes referred to as Evan)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>was in a charter school for 1st and 2nd grades, and now he&#39;s home.  I am a<br/>
disorganized person in general, and even more so since Sept. 11th (probably<br/>
something I need to process there).  Disorganized meaning that last week I<br/>
kept forgetting Max had agreed to clean his room on a certain day, and it&#39;s<br/>
still not clean, the cat had to eat dog food for a day &#39;cause I just kept<br/>
forgetting we were out, the checkbook is in horrible disarray (intuitive<br/>
checking, I&#39;ve heard it called), etc., etc.  Actually, writing this out, all<br/>
that doesn&#39;t seem like that big a deal.  I think it reminds me of the years<br/>
I was depressed and never had &quot;it&quot; together.  Anyway, Max has been just kind<br/>
of hanging around, looking like he&#39;d like me to tell him what to do.  He<br/>
found an old book a grandparent had given him - fun with reading kind of<br/>
thing where you fill in the blanks - and he was *thrilled* to be doing that.<br/>
Even though he thinks like this:  One of the fill-in-the-blanks was The<br/>
_________ jump up high.  Boys or man?  He chose boys, not because of the<br/>
plural &quot;jump&quot; but because he thought it was really silly for a grown man to<br/>
be jumping.  If the word had been &quot;jumps&quot; he still would have chosen boys,<br/>
because that&#39;s the way he thinks.  Then he would have looked in the back and<br/>
he would have been &quot;wrong&quot;.  OK, so now that particular book is gone, but he<br/>
really wants to be doing more &quot;school&quot;-like work, because that&#39;s what he&#39;s<br/>
used to.  I have read where kids who have gone to school need time to<br/>
&quot;deschool&quot;, and that I just need to be patient, let him hang out, and he&#39;ll<br/>
find himself.  But I&#39;m worried that because of my disorganization, maybe I&#39;m<br/>
not providing him with a good environment for doing that.  It feels<br/>
neglectful.  I&#39;m NOT neglecting him, and if he came up and said &quot;I want to<br/>
go look at __________&quot; I&#39;d take him in a minute, but he&#39;s not really<br/>
interested in anything.  He does read a lot.  He&#39;s almost nine.  I really<br/>
believe he needs time to &quot;heal&quot; from<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; his school experiences.  Nothing severely traumatic happened, but hearing<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that what you&#39;re interested in has no value, that finishing something on<br/>
time has more value than achieving your vision of it, etc., certainly left<br/>
some scars.  Has anyone else on the list been here?  I&#39;ve been trying to act<br/>
to everyone around me that I believe that everything is fine, and deep down<br/>
I believe it will be, but before that deep down is a lot of fear.  Any other<br/>
&quot;deschoolers&quot; out there?  Thanks  --<br/>
