<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362242595">I just found that they were not good at self limiting. Maybe I didn&#39;t give it<br/>
enough time? As I said before, we just pulled our kids out of the system in<br/>
the past year.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a teenager, I loved donuts.  I went to work in a donut shop where employees were allowed to sample the products.  The first few days I gorged on donuts of all kinds, starting with my favorites (jelly and cream-filled) and so on until I&#39;d had my fill of every type donut that was sold.  By the second week, I was getting jaded about donuts -- they were there -- all around me.  I knew I could have them any time I wanted, so there was no urgency to sample.  By the third week I no longer cared for glazed donuts of any kind.  This was after I&#39;d been having to clean the floor on my hands and knees -- using a scraper to scrape off pounds of glazed icing, grease, crumb, and dirt.      <br/>
<br/>
I would come home smelling like a donut after spending the morning frying off   donuts. The grease would be embedded in the fibers of my clothes.  I would wash them with bleach, hot water and detergent and they would still smell like donut grease.  My hair smelled like donut grease even after I washed it with <br/>
my favorite shampoo (Clairol Herbal Essence -- I still love that smell! And I never seem to find it any more.) <br/>
<br/>
By the end of the first month I wouldn&#39;t have eaten a donut if you paid me.  <br/>
For years afterward, donuts were not appealing in any way.  Only now will I occasionally have one, but I&#39;ll usually choose something else if offered.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all go through phases like this and just need to take the time to figure out. <br/>

If you have a CVS drug store near you, I saw it there the other day! And of<br/>
course I opened the top to smell that long forgotten smell.<br/>

cannot stand their garlic breadsticks. On one occasion a lot of my co-workers <br/>
and I ate lunch at a Red Lobster and while we were raving over their cheddar <br/>
biscuits, the Red Lobster workers said how much they loved our breadsticks.<br/>

<br/>
Donuts, breadsticks and steaks. Just shows how too much of anything can turn <br/>
you.<br/>
My oldest worked in a bakery last year and even though she&#39;s not big on <br/>
cakes and donuts and stuff, got sick of the smell every day. She refuses to <br/>
work with food now of any kind, whether she likes it or not!!!<br/>

I don&#39;t know. :-) I worked at a Chinese restaurant, all through uni, and got free lunches or dinners, depending on the shift...I still love Chinese food! ..Leonie W. <br/>
