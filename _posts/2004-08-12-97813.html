&gt; It&#39;s romantic to think of a happy child who loves her life being presented<br/>
with the idea that she chose the parents she did. But it&#39;s short sighted not<br/>
&gt; to take into account the effect on children who are leading rotten lives.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Learning something from a bad experience doesn&#39;t justify the bad<br/>
experience or the existence of bad experiences. There are far too many<br/>
people suffering<br/>
&gt; through bad experiences who will end up damaged and pass that damage on to<br/>
others to suggest that because good can come from bad, that there must be a<br/>
&gt; good reason for bad.<br/>

It *is* romantic and sweet... my daughter announced to me at 2 that she had<br/>
chosen me and her newly-born brother had chosen their dad, a huge fairy tale<br/>
about &quot;remembering before I was Hannah.&quot;  Even with the craziness of our<br/>
lives, she often comes to me and tells me she&#39;s so glad she picked me ~ & I<br/>
am too!<br/>
This is hitting home right now for me... My sister&#39;s kid has a pretty<br/>
pitiful life, I hate to think she&#39;s chosen it, but I&#39;m reassured that maybe<br/>
the choice was made less ugly with the opportunity to hang out with me and<br/>
my kids and temper her icky surroundings, if only for a week at a time (a<br/>
chance she would miss if my sister was actually a parent or if the kid had<br/>
chosen someone else).  She&#39;s 2.5 and I just think: dang! that girl must have<br/>
a *really* good reason for being here, I&#39;ll do what I can...<br/>
Just my $.02 :)  diana </span></blockquote></div>
