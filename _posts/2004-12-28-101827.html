<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689720948">Hi Mary,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say that Sandra&#39;s idea of a written apology and a <br/>
letter to the group about trying to avoid future situations are <br/>
great ideas. <br/>
<br/>
Calling the police was an extreme response, and the comment that <br/>
conselors have been involved, indicate that there may be more going <br/>
on with this mother and son than meets the eye. <br/>
<br/>
We have a neighbor that called the police after her son gave the <br/>
finger to my son and his friends riding by on their bikes. They gave <br/>
it back. I was sitting in the driveway with my little ones and saw <br/>
it all. A few minutes later, the mom came out yelling, &quot;This <br/>
harrassment has got to stop, or I&#39;m gonna call the cops.&quot; She <br/>
proceeded to tell me how the boys had given her son the finger &quot;for <br/>
no reason.&quot;  She couldn&#39;t see from her window that her son did it <br/>
first. Anyway, I set her straight, and she didn&#39;t like that. About <br/>
15 minutes later, the police were at her house taking her complaint. <br/>
This mother has called the police at least 6 times in the last year <br/>
on various children in the neighborhood. Her son is unable to get <br/>
along with anyone in the neighborhood, and her way of working it out <br/>
has been to make him a victim, and look to the police to &quot;solve&quot; the <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea if your situation is the same, but talking to other <br/>
group members, and working to improve the dynamics of the group can <br/>
only help. Maybe other group members have had similar experiences <br/>
with this child/parent, or concerns about playground sharing that <br/>
they want to address too. Also, having a written apology on file is <br/>
good for legal purposes. (The police call scared us alot. We called <br/>
our brother who is a lawyer and he told us to just keep a written <br/>
record of everything. That would be the best thing to do. That, and <br/>
of course, stay away from the kid, which I already emphasized!)<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, I agree with others who suggest maybe skipping the <br/>
park days if your child is not enjoying it. But talk about it first. <br/>
Find out if there were more guidelines about sharing, if parents <br/>
jumped in more to help resolve conflicts sooner, if he would enjoy <br/>
it more. If there is anything that would make it better for your <br/>
child, find out what it is. If not, maybe it&#39;s time to take a break.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-787805004">Sandra, your idea ia exactly what I have been searching for. A way to apologize and move past the fight and also let the group know what has happened. I do have a sample of a letter I think I will send to the mom, would you add more to it,<br/>
<br/>
Dear Sabrina and Leo,<br/>
I would like to apologize for Rileyï¿½s involvement in the conflict between Riley and Leo which took place Thursday afternoon, Dec. 16th. I am very sorry you and Leo left the park before the boys had a chance to talk through what had happened. I hope in the future when conflict arises we will be able to handle these situations in the moment and part confident that each of us is helping our children learn to live  together.<br/>
<br/>
At this point I&#39;m not sure where to go. I do what to keep this simple. I&#39;ll have to decide if I want to hand deliver this and possibly get involved in dialog with her or through the mail, what do you think? At this point I think she is pretty fired up towards me and I really do not want to have my kids around a mother with so much angst kicking. .<br/>
Thank you for the ideas, this is just what I wanted. I have yet to act on this and have not called her or seen her. I was the only eye witness parent, though some 5 year old kids were near by. I am so shocked she felt I didn&#39;t sound concerned. I think she wanted to see me yell and scold him in public and force him to say sorry when he was still really mad. I have learned to let my son cool off alone, he is that type and he knows when he is ready to come back and deal with what he created. I left him sitting under a tree collecting his thoughts. I also was busily gathering my stuff because I needed to pick up my older daughter and was now late. <br/>

<br/>
Mail.<br/>
<br/>
And keep a paper copy with a note on the date it went into the actual mail.<br/>
<br/>
Before you forget the details, too, w<br/>
Zte down exact place and time and maybe some witnesses, just in case.   <br/>
Because IF it comes to something down the road, the person who says &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
remember when, exactly&quot; pretty easily loses to the person who can say &quot;1:45 on <br/>
December 17th.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And if you&#39;re going to write a companion letter to others in the group, maybe <br/>
that should go at the same time so she can&#39;t call and say &quot;She wrote me and <br/>
blah blah&quot; before they hear from you.<br/>

<br/>
So would it have seemed to her as though you were bailing out and not <br/>
intending to follow-through?    Are any of those five year olds known well enough to <br/>
you that their opinions or accounts would help you?<br/>

<br/>
Yep. I had a run-in with a nut a couple years ago and it wasn&#39;t <br/>
enough that I picked my son up when he hit her son (they were two), <br/>
it wasn&#39;t enough that I said it looked liked we would have to leave <br/>
because he was just not in control, etc. The only thing that would <br/>
have been enough in her eyes was me hitting him and of course the <br/>
reason he was misbehaving was because I didn&#39;t hit him. She was <br/>
shocked and horrified that her child had been hit...and of course her <br/>
kids were hitting all the other kids a few minutes after we did <br/>
leave...just nuts.<br/>
<br/>
The really weird thing? She called me a few days later to <br/>
apologize...but for some weird little part of what she&#39;d said and <br/>
done. Then she listed all the things she still felt she was <br/>
completely right about. <br/>
<br/>
I ended up not hanging out with a few other people because they kept <br/>
inviting her to playgroups because they felt sorry for her. I felt <br/>
bad for her kids, but not bad enough to expose my kids to her...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been there, Mary. My middle daughter always needed time alone to <br/>
cool off before we could &quot;deal with&quot; anything! Other parents several <br/>
times demanded that I make her try to resolve a problem right then and <br/>
felt I was unconcerned because I left her alone. I&#39;ve NEVER been <br/>
&quot;unconcerned&quot; when it comes to my kids - but I have often &quot;acted&quot; a bit <br/>
nonchalant in order to help her cool down enough to be ABLE to work <br/>
things out. ME getting all upset and tense never helps HER be able to <br/>
be calmer.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did someone already suggest sending a copy to the police too?  Just to show<br/>
that you are the one who doesn&#39;t chose to call the police, but to resolve<br/>
matters on your own, like an adult?  I would also apologize to the police on<br/>
her behalf, I&#39;m sure they have better things to do than to manage playground<br/>
fights between SEVEN year olds.  Maybe they are already familiar with her<br/>

I like how you said that it is important to model conflict resolution to<br/>
children, instead of avoiding conflict.  Conflict is a part of life and the<br/>
conflict itself is not bad, but how you handle it can be.  <br/>
