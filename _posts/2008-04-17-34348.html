<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223211911">Holly pointed this out to me.  This is by a boy we know who is 15, I  <br/>
think now.  His parents are divorced, his mom remarried and became a  <br/>
fundamentalist Christian and doesn&#39;t want him.  His dad threw him out  <br/>
a year ago for being gay (and because dad&#39;s #3 wife-to-be didn&#39;t want  <br/>
the teenaged boy).  His step mom had him until recently.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
know the story of that ending.  He&#39;s with his dad&#39;s parents now.  He  <br/>
was homeschooled for several years when he was younger, before his  <br/>
dad&#39;s second divorce.<br/>
<br/>
This is the report of something really good that  happened to him:<br/>
<br/>
Subject:<br/>
CHOCOLATE!<br/>
Body:<br/>
lolzxzxzxz<br/>
so my grandpa called me... and asked if I needed anything from the store<br/>
I told him I had been craving chocolate, and asked if he could get me  <br/>
a bar of it...<br/>
so<br/>
he comes home with two bars saying, &quot;well, I didn&#39;t know if you  <br/>
wanted normal or with almonds.<br/>
&quot; LOLZ!<br/>
You wish you had grandparents like me :P<br/>

When Holly sees what other kids consider a big deal, it helps clarify  <br/>
all kinds of things for her about her own life, and the world in  <br/>
general.  I know she&#39;ll be an awesome mom someday.<br/>
<br/>
My article on how to raise a respected child has been translated into  <br/>
Spanish.  There&#39;s a link there:<br/>

<br/>
Some kids have to wait until they&#39;re nearly grown to get a little  <br/>
respect.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lizzy (15) and I talk often about how she does not want to be <br/>
treated like an adult but like a person.  She has taught me so much <br/>
about what that means.  To be respectful of people and accepting.  <br/>
Last night we talked about the more traditional punishment method of <br/>
time out I used when she was young.  That conversation was inspired <br/>
by the concept of &quot;Time in&quot; I have been learning about this week <br/>
from Scott Noelle&#39;s Daily Groove this week. <br/>
www.enjoyparenting.com/dailygroove   <br/>
<br/>
She remebers being put in her room A LOT.  I told her I was sorry <br/>
and I  am so happy to be doing things differently now.  I am so <br/>
proud of her that she never gave up on herself.  I am also happy to <br/>
have made the choice to have more peaceful relationship with her <br/>
while there was still time for us to enjoy each other.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-938862769">From Schuyler&#39;s blog post about her son&#39;s 11th birthday:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We offered to do whatever he wanted to do and he wanted to hang out and watch The <br/>
Mighty Boosh while playing on World of Warcraft with his friend. That was really cool to me <br/>
that he likes his life as it is so much that he wouldn&#39;t change it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like every day is his birthday, compared to some kids&#39; lives.<br/>
<br/>
Years back a mom wrote about having special holidays for each of her kids, separate from <br/>
birthdays, like their adoption day or something.  And I thought it was cool, and so for <br/>
Christmas I made each of mine a certificate, and they were all different, and it was for <br/>
them to create one holiday we all could celebrate each year.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought it was a great gift, but my husband hadn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
The kids agreed with him.  They were baffled by it, and none of them ever &quot;cashed it in.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that what would&#39;ve been exciting for *me* as a kid, the idea of one day a year <br/>
where I could orchestrate something special, of my own design, is for my own kids like <br/>
me offering to pour a cup of water into their swimming pool.  <br/>
<br/>
