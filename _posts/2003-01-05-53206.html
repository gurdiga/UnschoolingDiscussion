 </span></blockquote>IMHO, it does. I have one child who will never use a workbook or textbook in<br/>
his life. I have one extremely linear, organized child who likes to see<br/>
tangible progress. She requested a math workbook. (We got some of the Key<br/>
Curriculum series) She does them when she wants. She stops when she wants.<br/>
If she got them and said &quot;these are stupid, I will never do them&quot; I would<br/>
have found someone to sell them to. That&#39;s what makes it unschooling. To all<br/>
of us, this is no different than learning about government from &quot;The West<br/>
Wing, &quot; 1776, and NPR. All tools.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-108024583">&lt;&lt;Is there anyone in the Dallas/Fort Worth area?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We are actually from just north of San Antonio, but we are going to be in<br/>
Fort Worth this weekend for the stock show.  Come on out and visit.  We have<br/>
been unschooling for about 3 years.  I quit worrying about what my kids will<br/>
do in the future because they are doing such neat stuff in the present.  I<br/>
can&#39;t imagine them simply stopping because they became adults.  My dd (12)<br/>
raises dairy goats and has her own business selling the milk.  We just put<br/>
in chickens and the kids are planning on selling eggs as well.<br/>
