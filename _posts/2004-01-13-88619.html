&lt;&lt; &gt; And Holly wanted to hear the themesong to The Courtship of Eddie&#39;s <br/>
Father, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; because someone sang part of it in a game we were playing.  I couldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; remember <br/>
&gt; it all.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All my kids know &quot;Rubber Ducky&quot; because we were steeped in Sesame Street when <br/>
Kirby and Marty were little.  Then along came Holly, who said &quot;I hate Big <br/>
Bird.  Turn it off, turn it off!&quot;   She discovered our old Sesame Street tapes a <br/>
year and a half or two ago, and get QUITE into it.   <br/>
<br/>
So even someone who misses ten years of Sesame Street can catch up in just a <br/>
short time when she really WANTS to. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Today we were in a thrift store and the music somehow played &quot;Welcome Back, <br/>
Kotter.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I asked Holly if she knew what it was, and she said no.  &quot;It&#39;s the themesong <br/>
of a TV show called &#39;Welcome Back, Kotter.&#39;  John Travolta was in it.  It was <br/>
about a high school special ed class.  But it was really fantasy because there <br/>
were just six or eight kids in the class, and they were fun.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is that what made him famous?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I realized a woman was hearing all that.  She didn&#39;t look at us, but I <br/>
could tell by her profile that she was some kind of surprised or amused.   <br/>
<br/>
And then I thought maybe it was not the kind of conversation most moms and <br/>
daughters have in public.   <br/>
<br/>
But Holly is really with it about music, and that&#39;s a ton of fun for me.  So <br/>
for her, John Travolta wasn&#39;t a movie star or a disco king (though she&#39;s <br/>
somewhat aware of that), he&#39;s the star of Grease, a singer!  And he&#39;s someone who&#39;s <br/>
been performing since he was young and is still acting.  She knows that.<br/>
