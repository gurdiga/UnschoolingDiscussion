&lt;&lt; I wish more people looked into unschooling when they have babies instead<br/>
 of fourteen year olds that they don&#39;t know what to do with, and<br/>
 relationships they don&#39;t know how to repair. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YES!! If I had continued on the path I was on, the relationship with my <br/>
children would be VASTLY different today.<br/>
I am eternally grateful for all the uncomfortable questions and ruffling of <br/>
feathers that has led us to this lifestyle.<br/>
My 13 y.o. told me I had &quot;the parenting thing figured out really good&quot; the <br/>
other day.<br/>
He&#39;s SO sweet.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Cameron went to &quot;Riverfest&quot;--a bunch of bands at four different stages all <br/>
over the River-area of town. On the way to drop him off I said, &quot;If you <br/>
drink, please be careful. There&#39;ll be others there drinking and getting <br/>
obnoxious and maybe driving---just be aware and careful!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He smiled really big and said, &quot;Everyone else&#39;s moms are telling them NOT to <br/>
drink! You&#39;re pretty cool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t drink. He had a very good time. I picked him up at 9:30.<br/>
