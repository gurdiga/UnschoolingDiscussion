<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, a question: WHAT IS &quot;AOL&#39;S FILTER&quot; FOR THE INTERNET AND HOW DO I GET <br/>
&gt;  THAT AND HOW MUCH DOES IT COST? We just got our computer and have no <br/>
&gt;  &quot;filter&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AOL filter comes with AOL email/internet use.  He has his own screen name and <br/>
email address.  So, he enters the internet through his screen name, and the <br/>
program won&#39;t allow him to visit certain sites.  Another important <br/>
consideration for AOL is that the filter is set to not allow his screen name <br/>
to spend $$ online.  I&#39;ve known people who go to game sites and play games, <br/>
having no idea there is a charge.  I really wanted to avoid that.<br/>
<br/>
We do run into some problems where ds is looking something up that AOL <br/>
filters think is offensive.  An example would be that he can&#39;t get onto <br/>
websites that have the word &#39;breast&#39;.  Even if it is a medical or educational <br/>
usage.  For those times, I turn off the filter and help him find his way <br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
There are different general age settings.  I quickly discovered that his <br/>
needed to be set for young adult.  The child settings were so restrictive <br/>
that he was locked out of all kinds of websites that I considered appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, the filters are useful for his email, too.  I can set it so that he <br/>
cannot receive any attachments or pictures.  This keeps porn off his email, <br/>
for instance.  <br/>
<br/>
There are other filters you can get for your computer.  I haven&#39;t done <br/>
research on it, just know they are available.  A problem I&#39;ve run into, <br/>
personally, is entering a .com name hoping find a particular website, only to <br/>
find it was a porn site using an innocent sounding name.  I can&#39;t think of an <br/>
actual example at the moment, but it can be quite a shocker to enter &quot;go to <br/>
the beach.com&quot; and get a porn site!  Another good reason for a filter.  It&#39;s <br/>
not so much a matter of not trusting my son as much as not trusting the <br/>
website owners.  (Besides, he&#39;s smart enough it wouldn&#39;t take much for him to <br/>
figure out how to turn the filter off, if he decided he wanted to!)<br/>
<br/>
As for using the &#39;reply&#39; feature.  It varies from list to list.  This list is <br/>
set up so that &#39;reply&#39; automatically goes to the entire list.  I think the <br/>
theory is that we can all benefit from each other&#39;s responses.  (At least I <br/>
find that to be true!)<br/>
<br/>
If there is a topic you want to discuss personally with someone, simply cut <br/>
and paste their address into the &#39;send to&#39; box on your email form, deleting <br/>
any extra addresses that find their way to the form, if needed.  For this <br/>
list, you&#39;ll find the address of the person who posted the message in the <br/>
&#39;From:&#39; section of the header.  Typically, I highlight the part I&#39;m <br/>
responding to and use the forward key to transfer the text to a clean email <br/>
form.  Then cut/paste the address, complete and send the email.  <br/>
<br/>
A word of caution, some people find it offensive to receive personal email <br/>
from a list member.  I don&#39;t know how others here feel about it, but I&#39;ve <br/>
been on a couple of lists where it is very offensive.  It is fine with me and <br/>
I&#39;ve never received offensive personal responses or inappropriate spam.  So <br/>
far, no one has complained when I send a personal response, either.  Just be <br/>
aware and use common courtesy in your posts (like that&#39;s a problem, I&#39;m <br/>
sure!).<br/>
