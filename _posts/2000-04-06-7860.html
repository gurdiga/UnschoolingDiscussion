<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143731880">It seems that everyone I talk to can remember a light bulb moment in the <br/>
process of learning to read - that AHA where you went from painstakingly <br/>
sounding out words to actually GETTING it.  It&#39;s as if the code is finally <br/>
broken and you&#39;re seeing the words on the page for what they really are.  <br/>
Mine came while I was reading a Family Circus comic strip.  Thelma (Mom) is <br/>
standing in the bathtub holding a part for the plumber, who is working on the <br/>
faucet.  Dolly comes in and says, &quot;That was [so and so] on the phone.  I told <br/>
her you couldn&#39;t talk right now because you are in the bathtub with the <br/>
plumber.&quot;  I sounded it out, then again, and suddenly I could just READ the <br/>
whole thing without sounding it out at all!   I just looked at all the words <br/>
on the page at once, and they stood on their own, as if they had come to <br/>
life.  I was 4 at the time, I think.  We were on vacation in Kansas City, at <br/>
a hotel with a pool on the roof, and my sister threw up in the hallway on the <br/>
way back to our room after dinner that night.  She&#39;d had fish.  <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone else share their reading epiphany?  I&#39;m still waiting for that <br/>
moment in my younger son.  Last night I bought him a look-and-find book (like <br/>
Where&#39;s Waldo) without picture clues.  It only has written clues.  He <br/>
LOOOOOOVES look-and-finds, so I think he just might do it.  I didn&#39;t make a <br/>
production of it, just handed him the book and said &quot;Here, I thought you <br/>
might like this&quot;.  He opened it up and when he saw that the clues were <br/>
written his forehead kinda wrinkled up and he took a quick, secret glance at <br/>
me to see what I was going to do.  I pretended I didn&#39;t notice and kept <br/>
unloading my shopping bags.  He didn&#39;t say a word.  He left the book on the <br/>
table, but when I got up this morning I found it peeking out from under his <br/>
pillow.  Hmmmm.  <br/>
