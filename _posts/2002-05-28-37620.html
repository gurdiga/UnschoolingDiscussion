&lt;&lt; I came to the conclusion years ago, that I use the movies as an <br/>
 excape.  Sort of living vicariously through Bruce Willis and Mel <br/>
 Gibson, if you will. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do this too.<br/>
I really love the high action, thriller, drama type stuff. But I am super <br/>
sensitive to real violence or movies that portray realistic violence.  It has <br/>
to be obviously entertaining movie material for it to be a release of sorts. <br/>
I actually get all caught up in the excitement and forget about life for a <br/>
while, an escape of sorts.  It&#39;s totally therapeutic for me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep it was good.  Now we are looking for the old version with the rat <br/>
pack.  Need to check the library!<br/>
<br/>
We saw Spiderman this weekend.  It&#39;s really good. <br/>
Other things we&#39;ve seen recently and liked:<br/>
<br/>
Gosford Park - if you are into that sort of movie, it is excellent.<br/>
<br/>
ClockStoppers - I fell asleep (second movie at the drive-in) but the <br/>
rest of the family thought it was awesome, so nnow I have to make sure <br/>
I catch it when it&#39;s out on video.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Ohhh I love Ocean&#39;s 11 too (both the original and new)! I got the DVD for <br/>
Mother&#39;s Day (I was supposed to get a collection of Neil Diamond...) and <br/>
yesterday at B & N I picked up the soundtrack. On the subject, does anyone <br/>
know the name of the actor who plays Blaster? I can&#39;t figure it out from the <br/>
credits.<br/>

They&#39;ve got great cross referenced lists of information about movies. You<br/>
can click on an actor&#39;s name in one movie to see where you&#39;ve seen him<br/>
before. You cand even type in two actors names and see what movies they&#39;ve<br/>
done together.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Jenni just popped this in and that made me remember this post so I did <br/>
a bit of poking around.  It was Don Cheadle.  Here&#39;s the Bio from the <br/>
Ocean&#39;s 11 site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://oceans11.warnerbros.com/">http://oceans11.warnerbros.com/</a><br/>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
DON CHEADLE (Basher Tarr) re-teams with Steven Soderbergh for whom he <br/>
portrayed a DEA agent in the Academy Award-nominated film Traffic and <br/>
a vicious ex-con in Out of Sight, the director&#39;s adaptation of Elmore <br/>
Leonard&#39;s novel which also starred George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez and <br/>
Ving Rhames.<br/>
<br/>
Since being named Best Supporting Actor by the Los Angeles Film <br/>
Critics for his breakout performance opposite Denzel Washington in <br/>
Devil in a Blue Dress, Cheadle has consistently turned in powerful <br/>
performances on the stage and screen.<br/>
 <br/>
Last year, Cheadle received a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal of <br/>
Sammy Davis, Jr. in HBO&#39;s The Rat Pack and also received an Emmy <br/>
nomination for that role and for his starring role in HBO&#39;s A Lesson <br/>
Before Dying, in which he starred opposite Cicely Tyson and Mekhi <br/>
Phifer. Based on the critically acclaimed novel by Ernest J. Gaines, <br/>
the film tells the story of Grant Wiggins who returns to teach in the <br/>
small town where he was raised.<br/>
 <br/>
The year 2000 also saw Cheadle starring in Mission to Mars, opposite <br/>
Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins. As well, he appeared as part of the <br/>
stellar cast of the live black and white CBS television event, Fail <br/>
Safe, in which he starred opposite such acting greats as James <br/>
Cromwell, Brian Dennehy, Richard Dreyfuss and Harvey Keitel in George <br/>
Clooney&#39;s adaptation of the novel by Harvey Wheeler and Eugene <br/>
Burdick.<br/>
<br/>
In December 2000 Cheadle co-starred with Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni in <br/>
Family Man as an angel-like character that becomes the catalyst for a <br/>
New York investment banker to re-examine his life, and in 2001 Cheadle <br/>
starred in Allison Anders semi-autobiographical film, Things Behind <br/>
the Sun, and the digitally shot independent film Manic, directed by <br/>
Jordan Melamed.<br/>
<br/>
Most recently he was seen starring with John Travolta, Halle Berry and <br/>
Hugh Jackson in Swordfish for director Dominic Sena. Following Ocean&#39;s <br/>
Eleven, Cheadle will star with Jeffrey Wright in the world premiere of <br/>
Top dog-Under dog, for director George Wolfe at New York&#39;s Public <br/>
Theatre.<br/>
 <br/>
Cheadle received NAACP Image Award nominations for his roles in <br/>
Rosewood, directed by John Singleton and Bulworth, directed by Warren <br/>
Beatty.<br/>
  <br/>
Born in Kansas City, Missouri, Cheadle later relocated to Lincoln, <br/>
Nebraska, Denver Colorado and eventually settled in Los Angeles. He <br/>
received his Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Fine Arts from the prestigious CAL <br/>
ARTS in Valencia, California. With the encouragement of his college <br/>
friends, Cheadle auditioned for a variety of film and television roles <br/>
while attending school and landed a recurring role on the hit series <br/>
Fame. He was soon cast opposite Dylan McDermott in Hamburger Hill, <br/>
directed by John Irvin. His additional film credits include Boogie <br/>
Nights, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, Volcano, opposite Tommy Lee <br/>
Jones, Colors and Meteor Man, directed by Robert Townsend.<br/>
<br/>
The work, whether it be theater, film or television has always served <br/>
as his primary motivation, and when he was offered the opportunity to <br/>
perform in the production of Leon, Lena and Lenz at the Guthrie <br/>
Theater in Minneapolis he seized it, despite the momentum of his <br/>
career in Hollywood. His additional stage credits include roles in The <br/>
Grapes of Wrath and Liquid Skin at The Mixed Blood Theater in <br/>
Minneapolis, Cymbeline at The New York Shakes-peare Festival, &#39;Tis a <br/>
Pity She&#39;s a Whore at Chicago&#39;s Goodman Theatre and Athol Fugard&#39;s <br/>
South African play Blood Knot at The Complex Theater in Hollywood.<br/>
<br/>
Well-known for his two year stint in the role of District Attorney <br/>
John Littleton on the critically acclaimed series Picket Fences, <br/>
Cheadle&#39;s other television credits include a starring role in HBO&#39;s <br/>
Rebound: The Legend of Earl &#39;The Goat&#39; Manigault, directed by Eriq La <br/>
Salle, a series role on The Golden Palace and a recurring role on The <br/>
Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.<br/>
<br/>
A talented musician who plays saxophone, writes music and sings, he is <br/>
also an accomplished director with stage productions of Cincinnati <br/>
Man, at The Attic Theater and the critically acclaimed The Trip at <br/>
Friends and Artists Theater in Hollywood on an already impressive <br/>
resume.<br/>
 <br/>
Additionally, Cheadle is currently focused on writing a screenplay as <br/>
well as trying to find a home for his most current stage production <br/>
entitled Groomed. The play made its Los Angeles debut at the 1998 New <br/>
Works Festival at the Mark Taper Forum.</div>
