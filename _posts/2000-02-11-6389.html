<div id="ygrps-yiv-777868911">I&#39;m smiling...   My Grandmother who is 93, still tells one of the girls to go<br/>
get the butter (or some such thing) for one of the boys in the family.  Now,<br/>
we just snicker quietly and kick whichever male it is, on our way to get it.<br/>

This reminds me of when my cousins wife came for Christmas dinner. She almost passed out  when mawmaw told all the men to sit down and eat (whilst the ladies bustled in the kitchen waiting for the men to finish so they could eat)....we just humor the tradition,so the saying goes &quot;when in Rome....do as the Romans do&quot; <br/>
then we make THEM wait on us for the rest of the year...LOL...<br/>
