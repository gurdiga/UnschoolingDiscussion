HSLDA&#39;S &quot;HISTORY&quot; ERODES THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR FREEDOM<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/185.html/sotch.html">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/185.html/sotch.html</a><br/>
<br/>
      &quot;As homeschoolers, we must paddle upstream to maintain our <br/>
freedoms. The educational establishment, one of the most powerful <br/>
interest groups, sees us as a threat. It often uses statutes to <br/>
increase government regulation of homeschooling and force homeschools <br/>
to become more like conventional schools. Such government regulation <br/>
does not seem unreasonable to much of the general public. To maintain <br/>
our homeschooling freedoms, we must educate the general public and <br/>
legislators, counter the educational establishment, and oppose <br/>
statutes that lead to unnecessary regulation.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, our homeschooling freedoms rest on very solid <br/>
foundations. Unfortunately, these foundations have been and continue <br/>
to be eroded by the writings and actions of the Home School Legal <br/>
Defense Association (HSLDA), a national homeschooling organization. <br/>
This was recently crystallized in a so-called history of <br/>
homeschooling written by a staff attorney for HSLDA. Its central <br/>
point is that homeschooling was illegal in nearly every state until <br/>
HSLDA secured the freedom to homeschool. However, this thesis was not <br/>
supported or documented in the paper and is totally false. Actually, <br/>
HSLDA has relied on statutes, including legislation and court cases, <br/>
which do not give us our freedom and which instead erode its <br/>
foundations.<br/>
<br/>
We can no longer sit by, perhaps thinking critical thoughts but <br/>
merely wishing things were different. If we do not correct the <br/>
information and approach that HSLDA is broadcasting, our freedoms and <br/>
their foundations will continue to be eroded by HSLDA&#39;s actions.<br/>
<br/>
To understand why HSLDA&#39;s actions have done so much harm and continue <br/>
to do so, it is important to understand the foundations of our <br/>
freedoms...&quot;  Excerpt from Larry and Susan Kaseman&#39;s column in the <br/>
September/October 2001 issue of Home Education Magazine. To read the <br/>

<br/>
TEAM WORK<br/>
<br/>
I admit it, when I first received this book to review, a little &quot;uh <br/>
oh&quot; went through my mind. The book is titled &quot;Team Work: How to Help <br/>
Your Husband Make More Money So You Can Be a Stay-At-Home Mom.&quot; That <br/>
sounded too &quot;little woman behind the successful man&quot; for me. On my <br/>
first skim through it though, I changed my mind.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most frequently asked homeschool questions these days is <br/>
&quot;How can I homeschool and still work to help support my family?&quot; One <br/>
answer is that you can help your husband (or wife) make more money so <br/>
you can stay home full time. And to do that, it takes teamwork, just <br/>
like the title says.<br/>
<br/>
Concise and easy to read, &quot;Team Work&quot; gives women (or men) lots of <br/>
ideas for increasing the family bread winner&#39;s income. She starts <br/>
with assessing his skills, then moves on through furthering his <br/>
education to finding jobs to interviewing and landing a new, <br/>
higher-paying job. Other chapters discuss networking, <br/>
self-employment, alternative sources for extra income and a political <br/>
little chapter at the end on the value of SAHMs. The information is <br/>
backed up at the end of each chapter by relevant websites and books.<br/>
<br/>
Although &quot;Team Work&quot; is written for wives who want to help their <br/>
husbands, it could just as easily apply to husbands who want to stay <br/>
at home or parents of young adults who want to start a career. <br/>

<br/>
ASK CAROL<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to apologize for a confusing situation, and clear up a <br/>
misunderstanding about my column Ask Carol. I wear two hats for <br/>
HEM-one is the editor hat for this newsletter; the other is a <br/>
columnist hat for Home Education Magazine, the original print version <br/>
that&#39;s been around for over 20 years.<br/>
<br/>
About every other month, I ask people to send me questions and I <br/>
promise to answer as many as I can in future columns. Some of you <br/>
assumed I would answer them here, in this newsletter. In fact, I <br/>
don&#39;t answer them here, where the space is just too tiny for my BIG <br/>
advice. I do answer them in every issue of Home Education Magazine <br/>
though, and if you&#39;re at all curious, I&#39;ve put subscription <br/>
information at the end of the newsletter. A couple of them are online <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/issue_index.html)">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/issue_index.html)</a>, but most of <br/>
them you have to read in the magazine.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t really a plug for the magazine though, although it IS the <br/>
best homeschool magazine on the newsstand. This is another plea for <br/>
questions. I really like to get your questions-any questions at all. <br/>
Even if you think your question is stupid and you&#39;re the only one who <br/>
has your particular problem (it&#39;s probably not true). If you don&#39;t <br/>
have a question, send me something funny in the form of a question. <br/>
Somebody once asked me if she could homeschool if she has a tattoo <br/>
and rides a Harley. Her answer got more than half the column.<br/>
<br/>
So, help me out with that other hat, and send me your questions. I <br/>
even have a special email address: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:askcarol@...">askcarol@...</a> . Of <br/>
course, I don&#39;t promise I can answer every question (Especially if <br/>
you don&#39;t send one!), but I try to respond to each one, whether I use <br/>
it for a column or not. What are you waiting for? (~ CN ~)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>

UNSCHOOLING.COM<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;When my first child was a baby, a friend was very excited about a <br/>
method of teaching your baby to read that was popular at the time. We <br/>
decided to try with our babies, envisioning our babies reading very <br/>
young and growing up very smart and well educated. Neither of our <br/>
babies took to the program well, even though we tried it with them <br/>
again and again. My son, Chris, refused to read at two years, then at <br/>
three years. I gradually tried more traditional ways of teaching him <br/>
letters and sounds. Surely he would read by five years of age. But <br/>
not Chris. Maybe by the time he was six years old, or by seven? But <br/>
Chris refused to be forced or cajoled into reading. By now his <br/>
friends were learning to read in school, but Chris still couldn&#39;t <br/>
read. He struggled to decipher simple words and he hated trying to <br/>
read because it was so frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
I was holding my breath the whole time. I was battling tremendous <br/>
self-doubt. I must be an awful mother. Some folks advised me to take <br/>
Chris to specialists, test his hearing, eyesight, cognitive <br/>
abilities, look into reading labs for him. Deep in my soul, those <br/>
didn&#39;t feel right and I never took Chris to any of those things.<br/>
<br/>
And then the miracle happened. Right about his ninth birthday, <br/>
reading clicked in his mind and he just began reading. Within a month <br/>
he was reading easily at his grade level. Within a year he had read <br/>
every book on airplanes at the public library. The librarian, who <br/>
thought he was a wonderful and precocious child because he read so <br/>
much, gave him a special &quot;adult&quot; library card, so he could begin <br/>
checking out adult books about airplanes.<br/>
I breathed a sigh of relief. The muscles in my stomach could finally <br/>
relax. I could let my shoulders drop and I could unfurrow my brow. <br/>
One of my kids, at long last, was reading.<br/>
But there were two more kids behind Chris...&quot; ~ Carol Rice, an <br/>
excerpt from the feature article at unschooling.com ~<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling.com offers a free monthly newsletter, message boards, <br/>
weekly essays, an email list and more just for unschoolers. You can <br/>
also find out how long Carol Rice had to hold her breath before her <br/>
other 2 children learned to read. Check it out!<br/>

HONEY FOR THE HOMESCHOOLER&#39;S HEART:<br/>
Heartwarming True Stories Especially for the Homeschooling Parent<br/>
<br/>
Be a part of this wonderful book especially for homeschoolers, by <br/>
homeschoolers. If you have a warm, inspiring, or encouraging short <br/>
tale that relates to homeschooling that you would like to share <br/>
please send to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolr2@...">unschoolr2@...</a>. Each story should be between 600 <br/>
to 1500 words in length. Payment is one copy of the book when <br/>
published. Please respond within 6 weeks. This is an inclusive book, <br/>
including stories from all kinds of homeschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>

KIDSKONNECT<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kidskonnect.com">http://www.kidskonnect.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve reviewed lots of good websites that sort and categorize <br/>
educational sites for kids, but this is one of the best I&#39;ve seen. <br/>
Sorted into both alphabetized and subject indexes, the site offers 21 <br/>
subjects with almost 300 categories, each containing a dozen or more <br/>
sites that are guaranteed to be safe for your kids. (Their guarantee, <br/>
not mine, although I didn&#39;t seen anything inappropriate at all.)<br/>
<br/>
Subjects include animals, people, fun (chocolate!), games and <br/>
puzzles, music and the other 16. Under fun/informational you&#39;ll find <br/>
topics like amusement parks, babysitting, friendship, creativity <br/>
corner and...did I say chocolate?  I guess my only disappointment was <br/>
that there weren&#39;t MORE chocolate sites.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you&#39;re planning some unit studies, or looking for new <br/>
sites to interest your kids, this is the place to go. I saw only one <br/>
sponsor on the site itself, no popups, and a lot of good, safe sites <br/>
for the whole family.<br/>

<br/>
TGFN is not time, nor geographically, sensitive; each issue can be <br/>

<br/>
TGFN is based in Phoenix, Arizona and published in partnership with <br/>

What can I say? Some websites are just plain cool. If you&#39;ve got a <br/>
budding engineer in your house, this site is a must. If you just like <br/>
to fool around with animated soda straws linked with springs, you <br/>
gotta go check this out. If you&#39;re addicted to that roach game (you <br/>
know the one), try changing your habit. You can play with the <br/>
constructions on the site or make your own. Either way, plan for the <br/>
whole family to be there a while. This site will fascinate all ages <br/>
over 5, even those who don&#39;t love science and math. (Must have java <br/>
enabled.)<br/>

interest groups, sees us as a threat. It often uses statutes to<br/>
increase government regulation of homeschooling and force homeschools<br/>
to become more like conventional schools. Such government regulation<br/>
does not seem unreasonable to much of the general public. To maintain<br/>
our homeschooling freedoms, we must educate the general public and<br/>
legislators, counter the educational establishment, and oppose<br/>
statutes that lead to unnecessary regulation.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, our homeschooling freedoms rest on very solid<br/>
foundations. Unfortunately, these foundations have been and continue<br/>
to be eroded by the writings and actions of the Home School Legal<br/>
Defense Association (HSLDA), a national homeschooling organization.<br/>
This was recently crystallized in a so-called history of<br/>
homeschooling written by a staff attorney for HSLDA. Its central<br/>
point is that homeschooling was illegal in nearly every state until<br/>
HSLDA secured the freedom to homeschool. However, this thesis was not<br/>
supported or documented in the paper and is totally false. Actually,<br/>
HSLDA has relied on statutes, including legislation and court cases,<br/>
which do not give us our freedom and which instead erode its<br/>
foundations.<br/>
<br/>
We can no longer sit by, perhaps thinking critical thoughts but<br/>
merely wishing things were different. If we do not correct the<br/>
information and approach that HSLDA is broadcasting, our freedoms and<br/>
their foundations will continue to be eroded by HSLDA&#39;s actions.<br/>
<br/>
To understand why HSLDA&#39;s actions have done so much harm and continue<br/>
to do so, it is important to understand the foundations of our<br/>
freedoms...&quot;  Excerpt from Larry and Susan Kaseman&#39;s column in the<br/>
