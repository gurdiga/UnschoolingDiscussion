<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298238439">Wow, I don&#39;t know of any websites, but the only thing I can come up with at <br/>
the moment, is be there to answer your sisters questions and clean out an <br/>
extra bedroom if she decided to flap her wings.  It&#39;s fresh, so maybe your <br/>
Mom just needs time to adjust.  I understand how she feels from where she <br/>
sits, but she seems to be ignoring how unhappy your sister is in school.  <br/>
Maybe encouraging community college classes is the way to go since mom liked <br/>
that idea??  She could always try it out over the summer when ps is out and <br/>
maybe that will help sway your mom?  Gee, I&#39;m sorry because this must be vey <br/>
hard for everyone involved.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!<br/>
