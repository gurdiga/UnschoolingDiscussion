kids and not all directly related to hsing. My husband says I have right hand 
disease. Every time someone asks for a volunteer my right hand goes up. Girl 
Scout leader, LaLeche League Leader, Sunday School teacher, knitting blankets 
for project Linus....etc, etc. My hsing group also has the kids do thing like 
make cards for veterans. I also have a paying job two noghts a week as a 
pharmacy tech. Hmmm, maybe my husband is right.</font></div>

<br/>
&gt; I need some suggestions.... I would like to get Zak (who just turned 6)<br/>
&gt; involved with some kind of volunteering that we could do together.  This is a<br/>
&gt; mother/child thing rather than an unschooling thing (although I&#39;m sure it<br/>
&gt; comes under that heading).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re starting a small change collection in our girl scout troop which the<br/>
girls will use quarterly or so to donate to a charity of their choice. We<br/>
also visit nursing homes to do carols at Christmastime, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I used to volunteer with a dog rescue group, taking their &quot;untrainable&quot; dogs<br/>
and training them and then they could be found good homes.<br/>
<br/>
There are some really wonderful possibilities -- what are his strongest<br/>
interests? That could be a good starting point.<br/>

Christmas time and then nothing the rest of the year.  The ones around me, <br/>
loved the groups that came out in August or Sept. and sang other <br/>
songs...They liked it when the groups came in at different times so that <br/>
the people that lived there felt like someone remembered them all the time, <br/>
not just at the holidays.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As a rescue person, this is a  BIG HUGE help to us.  I have 20-30 dogs here <br/>
on any give day and it is hard to work with them all.  We are a no kill and <br/>
there are some here that need one on one and there is not always the time <br/>
for that.  I have one going to a home like this later on this week.  He is <br/>
very shy and needs to be the only dog to come out of the shell he has with <br/>
people.  Great dog, to other dogs but hides around people.<br/>
<br/>
It also works with cats too...sometimes, all they need is someone to care <br/>
for a bit.<br/>

Three Little Pigs, a musical no less! &lt;g&gt;) at a nursing home with our<br/>
homeschooling group in June.<br/>
<br/>
In our area there IS a lot of activity at Christmas time, but there are also<br/>
plenty of nursing homes, hospitals, etc. (there&#39;s that etc. again &lt;g&gt;) who<br/>
really do welcome one or more even then. So no, I don&#39;t suggest &quot;just&quot; doing<br/>
Christmas, but around the holidays is also nice.<br/>
