<br/>
&lt;&lt; It&#39;s hard for me to take the above statement at face<br/>
value without more specifics. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I SO AGREE.<br/>
<br/>
Drives me crazy when people on a list like this will bring frightening <br/>
statements without documentation or qualification, and &quot;Someone said he had heard of <br/>
several cases...&quot; isn&#39;t enough qualification for my tastes.<br/>
<br/>
Last week two people left this list and blamed me, saying I was too imperious <br/>
or didn&#39;t like to be criticized but I could criticize.   I don&#39;t see it as <br/>
criticism to ask an adult to back up her statements in a public discussion.  Not <br/>
a bit.<br/>
<br/>
So the other day it was the question of how one could logically believe that <br/>
sneakers on a phone wire would mark a crack house.    But I have a more <br/>
classic question, which I will relate to death from chicken pox.<br/>
<br/>
Coca Cola dissolves teeth.<br/>
Coca Cola dissolves nails.  <br/>
<br/>
True or false?<br/>
<br/>
Twice there have been discussions (here or at unschooling.com or on AOL) in <br/>
the past few years and twice people asserted that they knew someone who had <br/>
dissolved a tooth in Coca Cola.  Or a nail.  <br/>
<br/>
Well then!  Log off and go and prove it to yourself and others!<br/>
<br/>
But wait.  It doesn&#39;t.   If it did, why wouldn&#39;t it dissolve its own can?  <br/>
Why wouldn&#39;t it dissolve a plastic bottle?<br/>
Still, parents, and homeschooling parents, have asserted that it does.<br/>
<br/>
If something doesn&#39;t make sense, inquire.  Test.  Research.<br/>
It&#39;s not hard to stick a nail in a glass of coke.  <br/>
I wish it were harder for people to keep saying it will dissolve a nail.  My <br/>
mom heard that in the 1930&#39;s from some snake oil salesman with a wagon, in <br/>
some little cotton-field town in Texas.   There should be SOME progress in <br/>
knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t take anyone&#39;s word for anything fishy or questionable.<br/>
Don&#39;t pass on e-mail that says Mr. Rogers was a sniper of a SEAL.  <br/>
Don&#39;t pass on e-mail that says the police use Coca Cola to clean up blood <br/>
after highway accidents.  <br/>
<br/>
Or do, but don&#39;t get mad at people who say &quot;Why do you think so?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It frightens me some that people who are sure schools are awful and who want <br/>
to take full responsibility for their children&#39;s learning will be offended <br/>
that someone suggests they double check their &quot;facts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE, before posting something to 1500+ people, if it&#39;s not your personal <br/>
experience either qualify the statement, research it so you can quote someone <br/>
or just double check.  Not just here, but anywhere.  Not just in writing, but <br/>
in speeches.  <br/>
<br/>
Before determining to be an unschooling mom, determine to care about what&#39;s <br/>
sensible and what&#39;s not, what&#39;s worth passing on and what&#39;s just the noise of <br/>
people talking, or superstitious or traditional stuff without basis in <br/>
objective life.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see that as imperious.  I see it as reminding people that words have <br/>
power and exchanges of information work better when they&#39;re full of <br/>
information, not misinformation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-701271709">Well, we can replace:<br/>

<br/>
Coca Cola can put out an engine fire in a VW Kombi.<br/>
<br/>
My son and his two mates were driving along in our Kombi, when the <br/>
engine caught on fire.  While Greg turned of the engine and disconnected <br/>
the CNG bottle, the other two shook up their coke bottles and sprayed <br/>
the engine - it worked very well.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s definitely more worth while passing on than the tooth and nail <br/>
stuff :-)<br/>

it in a glass with coke in it, set it on a shelf, and forgot about <br/>
it.  The coke evaporated and left a black sticky coating on the <br/>
bottom of the glass.  We let it sit in that coating for at least a <br/>
month before we got it out of the glass.  The tooth was completely <br/>
black, like coal.  We scrubbed the tooth and it was still black.  <br/>
Some of the chewing surface of the tooth seemed to have crumbled off <br/>
a little bit and the tooth looked slightly smaller.  But the tooth <br/>
was still kind of hard...you would&#39;ve probably needed a hammer to <br/>
break it in half.  <br/>

<br/>
I can tell you a real use for coca-cola, that I have both seen and done in<br/>
my professional life.<br/>
<br/>
In theaters with wooden or painted floors on the stage, diluted coca-cola is<br/>
often mopped onto the floor to make the floor slightly sticky for the<br/>
dancers. I first saw this done prior to every performance for the Sydney<br/>
season of &quot;La Cage Aux Folles&quot;, for which I was Head Dresser - we had to<br/>
keep off the stage until it dried. That is a huge dancing show, including a<br/>
vigorous acrobatic Can-Can. Subsequently the Australia Opera mechanists also<br/>
did it when they came to put &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; on at Her Majesty&#39;s. I<br/>
have not seen it done for metal or other special finish floors, but I don&#39;t<br/>
know that it can&#39;t be done. <br/>

&lt;&lt; State Patrolers use Coca-Cola to clean blood of the highways after a motor <br/>
vehicle accident!  Makes you think, doesn&#39;t it! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
It makes me think you haven&#39;t read the thread to which you responded, and <br/>
maybe didn&#39;t read the e-mail that recommended reading the list a while before <br/>
posting.<br/>
<br/>
State patrollers do not use Coca Cola to clean blood of fthe highways.  Why <br/>
do you think they do?<br/>
<br/>
The whole topic was about NOT believing things you read in e-mail without <br/>
doublechecking them, and not passing on bad information (or even good <br/>
information) without checking and citing your sources, or qualifying your statements.  <br/>
<br/>
You have no personal way to know what all state troopers use to clean up <br/>
after all accidents.   If you will pass that on to this list of 1600 readers (some <br/>
probably aren&#39;t bothering to read), will you pass things on to your kids you <br/>
haven&#39;t really thought about or tried to confirm?<br/>
<br/>
The Urban Legends Reference Pages (snopes.com) says this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The next time you&#39;re stopped by a highway patrolman, try asking him if he&#39;s <br/>
ever scrubbed blood stains off a highway with Coca-Cola (or anything else). If <br/>
you&#39;re lucky, by the time he stops laughing he&#39;ll have forgotten about the <br/>
citation he was going to give you. &quot;<br/>

Cola contains less citric acid than orange juice does, and the <br/>
concentration of phosphoric acid in Coke is far too small (a mere 11 <br/>
to 13 grams per gallon of syrup, or about 0.20 to 0.30 per cent of <br/>
the total formula) to dissolve a steak, a tooth, or a nail overnight. <br/>
(Much of the item will dissolve eventually, but after a day or two <br/>
you&#39;ll still have most of the tooth, a whole nail, and one very soggy <br/>
t-bone.) <br/>

Besides, the gastric acid in your stomach is much stronger than any <br/>
of the acids in Coca-Cola, so the Coca-Cola is harmless. <br/>

Yeah, but if you put an egg or a bone in vinegar, it will turn VERY  rubbery! <br/>

vinegar, and it became stretchy and bouncy. Really cool! The egg  actually <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091076902">Yes, actually I have done it. More than once just for<br/>
fun, since I like the look of shiny pennies. Sarah had<br/>
overheard me telling my husband that the dentist was<br/>
giving me a hard time saying that my drinking soda all<br/>
the time showed up in the patterns of decay on my<br/>
teeth, similiar to &quot;baby bottle mouth&quot; that little<br/>
ones can get. She wanted to know how it worked. I<br/>
couldn&#39;t explain it, but I said I could show her<br/>
something similar.<br/>
<br/>
Why Coke? Because I&#39;d heard that it worked. I wanted<br/>
to see if it actually did. I&#39;m not going to go shine<br/>
my trumpet with the stuff, but for shiny pennies, it&#39;s<br/>
nice. My mouth is more of a combination of factors<br/>
including weak enamel to begin with, but the soda<br/>
doesn&#39;t help. <br/>
<br/>
Trying to use it as a nutrition topic didn&#39;t work.<br/>
Sarah was more interested in the fact that it made<br/>
pennies shine than what it could theoretically be<br/>
doing to her body (and obviously I&#39;m not THAT<br/>
concerned either or I wouldn&#39;t still be drinking it).<br/>
I&#39;ve heard stomach acid is really so very much<br/>
stronger than anything they could possibly put in a<br/>
drink that it doesn&#39;t matter if it cleans pennies. If<br/>
it was really that bad for us, we couldn&#39;t get it down<br/>
our esophagus without serious damange for it to damage<br/>
our insides! My theory anyway. I could be wrong.<br/>

The purpose of this subject line was not to exchange suggestions about coca <br/>

okay here is a good one <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/oct98/909181221.Ch.r.html">http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/oct98/909181221.Ch.r.html</a>&gt; in <br/>
which a chemical engineer talks about the acids naturally occurring in <br/>
the body versus carbonic acid in coke. Here is part of it:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Coca-Cola®, like any other soft drink, is acidic. This is because a <br/>
small amount of the carbon dioxide dissolved in soft drinks (to make <br/>
them effervescent) will react in solution to form carbonic acid. <br/>
Carbonic acid may clean the rust from a nail, but it would not dissolve <br/>
a nail in 24 hours. Try it—a can of Coke® and a nail costs less than a <br/>
dollar. Many common foods are acidic. That does not mean that they are <br/>
dangerous.  Specialized cells in the human stomach wall secrete  <br/>
hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid is much stronger than carbonic <br/>
acid, and will dissolve an iron nail easily. The contents of your <br/>
stomach are usually at a pH of 2. Please don’t try the nail in the <br/>
stomach contents experiment. There is no safe way to get a nail in your <br/>
stomach, and there is no safe (or polite) way to remove the contents of <br/>
your stomach to apply it a nail. You will just have to trust me on that <br/>
one.<br/>
