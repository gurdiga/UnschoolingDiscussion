<br/>
I am saying this because I did the same thing once. I posted a private email <br/>
debate about homeschooling, thinking someone could learn something from it. <br/>
Even though I changed the names to protect the innocent, I never had <br/>
permission to share someone&#39;s private thoughts on a public board. I had a big <br/>
DUH moment and had the posts pulled and apologized for my ignorance to the <br/>
readers. It&#39;s considered the worst kind of breech of netiquette to some <br/>
folks. Just something to consider. <br/>

afterall, it was not TO me.. But, I&#39;ll admit, curiosity got me and I did read <br/>
it.  I also have to say.. even though I do share your beliefs and concerns <br/>
about your sister, I thought your mother was very calm and reasonable in  her <br/>
letter.   I really didn&#39;t see anything &quot;wrong&quot; with how she responded, she <br/>
basically said that she wished you had discussed it with her first.   I&#39;m <br/>
sure its frustrating and difficult to see a situation happening that you feel <br/>
you could help with.  But, I think the best thing you can do is be there for <br/>
your sister, as a sister.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My mom DID judge this book by the cover and was all PO&#39;d because she <br/>
thought I was encouraging my sister to quit school.... and that&#39;s it. <br/>
 She sent me an email (below) and then I called her to explain things <br/>
for her, but she&#39;s still not &quot;convinced&quot;.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your mom&#39;s note was pretty calm, actually!  And if they read anything besides <br/>
enough to get irritated, she&#39;ll feel differently.<br/>
<br/>
Even if your sister stays in high school, she no longer will feel that it is <br/>
the BE ALL your mom thinks it is, so she&#39;s been liberated in one way already.<br/>
<br/>
A high school diploma squeaked by is as &quot;valuable&quot; as a 4.0 without being <br/>
valedictorian.  If you can say &quot;I was Valedictorian&quot; you get double points, <br/>
but double a high school diploma still is not all that much.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could tell your mom that your sister was crying out for help and so <br/>
you helped her directly instead of saying &quot;Mother May I?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And with that you might could say that if any of YOUR kids are ever obviously <br/>
crying out for religious education or express a fear for their eternal soul, <br/>
or complain that you never took them to church, that she should IMMEDIATELY <br/>
send them a Bible, instructional videos, missionaries at the door.  No <br/>
problem.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My mom is young (48) and didn&#39;t graduate because she got pregnant with <br/>
me.  Getting a diploma is some sort of holy quest for her to &quot;make&quot; her <br/>
kids get.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OOOH!  OOOH!<br/>
<br/>
Did she ever get a GED or finish high school?<br/>
<br/>
Two things:  <br/>
Encourage her to do that.  American correspondence school, maybe, or a GED.<br/>
<br/>
If she says no, it&#39;s not important BINGO!!!!<br/>
<br/>
If she says okay, then maybe still the problem dissipates.  Maybe SHE wants <br/>
the diploma and is vicariously earning it through you and your sister.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403684877">For what its worth, I have to disagree with this.<br/>
<br/>
Just because someone emails me something, does not make it my place to share it with others, even if its related to part of my own story.  Even if I can adequately protect their privacy, I would still want to have their permission to share what they wrote to me.  I&#39;d like that same courtesy in return.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t think a private email between family members can be compared to a death threat which is a crime.<br/>

her, too.  When she started giving me grief about homeschooling, I just used <br/>
her non-diploma status against her.  I pointed out all the things she&#39;s done <br/>

when he could drive.   He was probably  16 in the 8th grade.  Anyway, he is <br/>
now successful tree farmer.  His net worth is over 2 million dollars.  I have <br/>
tried the &quot; but look at you and how you turned out&quot; argument with him  to no <br/>
avail.  His stand is that YES, he is successful.. YES, he did &quot;make it&quot; .. <br/>
But, its been very diffcult, hard work.  Long hours, lots of headaches, and <br/>
basically eeking his way up the ladder to make something for himself ( and <br/>
his family)  He does not want to see his children ( well, we are already <br/>
grown) or his grandchildren have to struggle and work as hard as he did.   He <br/>
thinks that having a good education ( ie, College degree) will make it much <br/>
easier for the kids to find a good job and make a good living.   I&#39;ve told <br/>
him they can still go to college if they want to, but thats hard for him to <br/>
understand.   I can only take a  &quot;well, just wait and see&quot; attitude with the <br/>
whole situation.   I know his concerns are out of love and fear that my kids <br/>
will be missing something in school.   In reality, I think he IS the perfect <br/>
example of someone who was not &quot;schooled&quot; and has a happy, successful life. <br/>
