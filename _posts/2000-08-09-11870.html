<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245745815">&quot;Creating Learning Communities&quot; is finally off the presses.  I have my first<br/>
copy in my hand.  And will be mailing copies to everyone who preordered<br/>
later today.  If you don&#39;t get it within a week let me know.<br/>
<br/>
For those who don&#39;t know.  &quot;Creating Learning Communities&quot; was composed<br/>
online by &#39;A Coaltion for Self Learning (CfSL). CfSL is an ad hoc collection<br/>
of homeschoolers, futurists, ecucational professionals and other who can<br/>
&quot;envision a world without schools -- a world of learning communities.&quot;  They<br/>
see a new learning system as necessary, possible and happening.  It will be<br/>
based on new social needs, new brain research, and new techniques and<br/>
technologies.<br/>
<br/>
Publication of the book is only the kickoff for a campaign to help create<br/>
learning communities.  Everyone is invited to read the book join the<br/>
campaign.<br/>
The book is now available from any of the 30 authors for $21.95.  It will be<br/>
