<div id="ygrps-yiv-891537534">Here I go being different again...I grew up in a rural area (acreage, small<br/>
farms). We had plenty of room. I thought it was terrible that in &quot;the city&quot;<br/>
you could actually see your neighbor&#39;s house from your own. But now I&#39;ve<br/>
lived in town for over 10 years and I&#39;d never want to go back to gravel<br/>
roads and cow manure. I like things like sidewalks. It&#39;s all just personal<br/>
preferences.<br/>
<br/>
I also like how (in my experience) kids are _more_ supervised here in town.<br/>
There&#39;s less room to hide. I can hear or see my children nearly all the way<br/>
around the block. Back in &quot;the country&quot;, kids would go into the woods to do<br/>
drugs or have sex. (or set fires or torture animals, etc, etc)  My old<br/>
classmates weren&#39;t the best sort.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had ups and downs with the neighbor kids. Some are allowed to run<br/>
around the neighborhood at the age of 4. If they seemed to have any<br/>
redeeming qualities I&#39;d let them play with my kids at my house only and get<br/>
them used to our rules. If they did rude or obnoxious things I sent them<br/>
home. There&#39;s only one kid who was permanently banned. The others have<br/>
developed into reasonable playmates. They are all p/s-ed so we don&#39;t see<br/>
them much now. Their best friends are other unschoolers they have common<br/>
interests with....theater, ballet, etc.<br/>
