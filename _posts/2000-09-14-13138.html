<br/>
Teacher <br/>
<br/>
Her name was Mrs. Thompson.  As she stood in front of her 5th grade<br/>
class on the very first day of school, she told the children a lie.<br/>
Like most teachers, she  looked at her students and said that  she loved<br/>
them all the same.  But that was not possible, because there in the<br/>
front row, slumped in his seat, was a little boy named Teddy Stoddard.<br/>
Mrs.Thompson had watched Teddy the year before and noticed that he<br/>
didn&#39;t play well with the other children, that his clothes were messy<br/>
and that he constantly needed a bath.  And Teddy could be unpleasant.<br/>
It got to the point where Mrs. Thompson would actually  take delight in<br/>
marking his papers with a broad red pen, making bold X&#39;s and then<br/>
putting a big &quot;F&quot; at the top of his papers.<br/>
At the school where Mrs. Thompson taught, she was required to review<br/>
each child&#39;s past records and she put Teddy&#39;s off until last. However,<br/>
when she reviewed his file, she was in for a surprise. Teddy&#39;s first<br/>
grade teacher wrote, &quot;Teddy is a bright child with a ready laugh  He<br/>
does his work neatly and has good manners...he is a joy to be around.&quot;<br/>
His second grade teacher wrote, &quot;Teddy is an excellent student, well<br/>
liked by his classmates, but he is troubled because his mother has a<br/>
terminal illness and life at home must be a struggle.&quot; His third grade<br/>
teacher wrote, &quot;His mother&#39;s death had been hard on him. He tries to do<br/>
his best, but his father doesn&#39;t show much interest and his home life<br/>
will soon affect him if some steps aren&#39;t taken.&quot; Teddy&#39;s fourth grade<br/>
teacher wrote, &quot;Teddy is withdrawn and doesn&#39;t show much interest in<br/>
school.  He doesn&#39;t have many friends and he sometimes sleeps in class.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
By now, Mrs. Thompson realized the problem and she was ashamed of<br/>
herself. She felt even worse when her students brought her Christmas<br/>
presents, wrapped in beautiful ribbons and bright paper, except for<br/>
Teddy&#39;s. His present was clumsily wrapped in the heavy, brown paper that<br/>
he got from a grocery bag.  Mrs. Thompson took pains to open it in the<br/>
middle of the other presents.  Some of the children started to laugh<br/>
when she found a rhinestone bracelet with some of the stones missing,<br/>
and a bottle that was one quarter-full of perfume.But she stifled the<br/>
children&#39;s laughter when she exclaimed how pretty the bracelet was,<br/>
putting it on, and dabbing some of the perfume on her wrist. Teddy<br/>
Stoddard stayed after school that day just long enough to say, &quot;Mrs.<br/>
Thompson, today you smelled just like my Mother used to.&quot;<br/>
After the children left she cried for at least an hour.  On that very<br/>
day, she quit teaching reading, and writing, and arithmetic. Instead,<br/>
she began to teach children.  Mrs.Thompson paid particular attention to<br/>
Teddy. As she worked with him, his mind seemed to come alive. The more<br/>
she encouraged him, the faster he responded.  By the end of the year,<br/>
Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the class and, despite<br/>
her lie that she would love all the children the same, Teddy became one<br/>
of her &quot;teacher&#39;s pets.<br/>
A year later, she found a note under her door, from Teddy, telling her<br/>
that she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life. Six<br/>
years went by before she got another note from Teddy.  He then wrote<br/>
that he had finished high school, third in his class, and she was still<br/>
the best teacher he ever had in his whole life. Four years after that,<br/>
she got another letter, saying that while things had been tough at<br/>
times, he&#39;d stayed in school, had stuck with it, and would soon graduate<br/>
from college with the highest of honors.  He assured Mrs. Thompson that<br/>
she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had in his whole<br/>
life. Then four more years passed and yet another letter came.This time<br/>
he explained that after he got his bachelor&#39;s degree, he decided to go a<br/>
little further.  The letter explained that she was still the best and<br/>
favorite teacher he ever had.  But now his name was a little longer -<br/>
the letter was signed, Theodore F. Stoddard, MD. The story doesn&#39;t end<br/>
there. You see, there was yet another letter that spring. Teddy said<br/>
he&#39;d met this girl and was going to be married. He explained that his<br/>
father had died a couple of years ago and he was wondering if Mrs.<br/>
Thompson might agree to sit in the place at the wedding that was usually<br/>
reserved for the mother of the groom.  Of course, Mrs Thompson did.  And<br/>
guess what? She wore that bracelet, the one with several rhinestones<br/>
missing. And she made sure she was wearing the perfume that Teddy<br/>
remembered his mother wearing on their last Christmas together. They<br/>
hugged each other, and Dr. Stoddard whispered in Mrs. Thompson&#39;s ear,<br/>
&quot;Thank you, Mrs. Thompson for believing in me. Thank you so much for<br/>
making me feel  important and showing me that I could make a<br/>
difference.&quot; Mrs. Thompson, with tears in her eyes, whispered back.  She<br/>
said, &quot;Teddy, you have it all wrong. You were the one who taught  me<br/>
that I could make a difference.  I didn&#39;t know how to teach until I met<br/>
you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Warm someone&#39;s heart today .  .  . pass this along.<br/>
<br/>
Please remember that wherever you go, and whatever you do, you will have<br/>
the opportunity to touch and/or change a person&#39;s outlook please try to<br/>
do it in a positive way. &quot;Friends are angels who lift us to our feet<br/>
when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly.&quot;</div>
