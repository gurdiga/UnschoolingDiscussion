Deschooling for us took about 5 months, but we had been unschooling on again off again prior to that, so I think there was some deschooling going on before then...maybe about 2 years.  (Total school time would be 5 years plus 3 years of relaxed homeschooling).<br/>

(I know unschooling doesn&#39;t actually happen &quot;on again off again&quot;, but what I mean is that I threw myself into it for a few months, then I&#39;d get anxious about things and feel the need to &quot;intervene&quot;).  <br/>
<br/>
The interventions would last anywhere from a few days to 2 months sometimes...always relaxed style, (like we&#39;d do some math 2 days/week) but always driven by my own worry.  <br/>
<br/>
About 2-3 weeks ago, I had the itch to start &quot;structuring&quot; again, but decided I was not going to do it.  I trust my kids and the learning process.  I&#39;ve watched my youngest who truly has been unschooling continuously, and I see what it has done for her.  (she was lucky....I was too busy worrying about the older ones LOL).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t interfere, because a short time after my &quot;itch&quot;, I noticed a big change:<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, my kids don&#39;t fight as much.  They don&#39;t seem as anxious to go back to school, they rarely talk about it anymore.   They suddenly content with life as it is here.  THey seem to be thinking more about the world around them and what they&#39;d like to accomplish.  <br/>
<br/>
They seem to be thinking about the world and their lives &quot;as if school didn&#39;t exist&quot; and they are happier people.<br/>
<br/>
Its pretty amazing to watch this happen.  Its definitely a turning point.  Is it like this for everyone whose childern &quot;deschool&quot;?  Do you see a definite &quot;turning point&quot; that you just &quot;know&quot; when the deschooling phase is ending?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-811683148">Deschooling, for us, took 4 years!  And she was only in school for 2!  Now, <br/>
I must add that we had a lot of schoolishness on my part - read that <br/>
foolishness - in wanting her to do this and that, learn this and that, read, <br/>
write, breathe this and that.  I would go for months at a time, lounging, <br/>
loving and living and then suddenly my brain would backfire and urge me to <br/>
perform schoolishly.<br/>
<br/>
I also suffered from severe curriculosis.  I LOVED buying curriculum.  We <br/>
tried them all.  Not many are worked through past week one.  Our true <br/>
deschooling happened when I spent nearly $1,000 on used OM stuff.  It <br/>
suddenly hit me that *I* hate being told what to do, how to do it, where to <br/>
do it, why to do it, when to do it, so I packed it up in a box and threw it <br/>
in the garage.  I&#39;m certain we must have highly intelligent mice by now! ;)  <br/>
Though at times I wonder if the answer isn&#39;t right there.  In the mice...or <br/>
any other species bright enough to figure out that it doesn&#39;t take a manual <br/>
to learn about life; how to be successful in it and enjoy it thouroughly.  <br/>
(Can ya tell I&#39;m reading Ishmael?? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
My kids needed for *ME* to deschool so they could!  It was ME holding them <br/>
back.  ME pushing them to keep up with the schoolies.  ME doubting THEM!  <br/>
It&#39;s a pretty guilt-ridden Ah-HAH to go through.<br/>
<br/>
I am so stoked about going to the SC conference.  Finally, a place to be <br/>
known, understood, accepted.  A place my husband, should he choose to come, <br/>
can see for himself that children CAN be free of the Joneses and still turn <br/>
out to be respectable individuals, able to learn and live on their own <br/>
terms, in their own time and still be able to function outside the <br/>
proverbial HOMSKOOL-white-trash-trailer.  THIS, my friends, is a HUGE <br/>
misconception here and we have a large homeschooling community.  As an <br/>
unschooler, it gets even worse!<br/>
<br/>
I am making progress with him though, my husband that is.  We agreed to sell <br/>
all the curriculum to pay for the trip!!  My deschooling process is not <br/>
over.  I doubt it ever will be.  I have a lifetime of programs to debug.  <br/>
Programs my family, friends, neighbors and the media spit in my face daily.  <br/>
I suppose I could hole myself away in the bush of Alaska and be free, but I <br/>
have to figure out how to find my husband a job there first!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124170277">i am still going threw the process myself. my ex husband is greatly oppessed <br/>
to homeschooling in general and i feel like i have to prove something to him. <br/>
this is our first complete year unschooling and i&#39;m a little nervous being <br/>
that i have to give her a standerized test every year( which i am so against <br/>
but its the law!). hopfully i will become more confident as we go along.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-438983604">Geez, Kristen.... Thanks soooo much for this posting!!<br/>
<br/>
It describes so well the &quot;deschooling process&quot; that we have been going <br/>
through as well.  The stops and starts, by me and the kids, the structuring <br/>
binges and so on.  It sounds like this may be more the &quot;rule than the <br/>
exception&quot; for most.  It would have helped me to see a quote like this in <br/>
one of the homeschooling books that I desperately read and scanned those <br/>
first years, trying to &quot;normalize&quot; as much as possible (!!) our fledgling <br/>
steps.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, back to your question....Yes, I too have just begun noticing the <br/>
same effects as you.  My kids are not fighting as much...in fact they are <br/>
and have been communicating more with each other (they are 14 and 10, boy <br/>
and girl!!), helping each other and in fact, playing and learning <br/>
together.  It is an amazing thing to see, especially considering that only <br/>
3-4 years ago, before meds, one was trying to kill the other.  The <br/>
emotional effects remain in the youngest (PTSD) but the relatively <br/>
stress-free surroundings of home have helped heal some of those wounds, so <br/>
that they now can learn again and be with each other.  It is truly, for me, <br/>
a wondering, unschooling moment.  (Thanks to you all.)<br/>
<br/>
They are also starting to do the &quot;interested in learning things stuff&quot;, <br/>
picking things up on their own to do and pursuing it.  Really neat to see <br/>
in action what I have been reading about for SO LONG!!!<br/>
<br/>
My only real problem is my daughter&#39;s lack of sufficient available <br/>
friends.  This is a child who is and has been only happy having someone to <br/>
play with 24 hours a day( I am not exaggerating).  This has been and still <br/>
is her preferred activity of all.  Difficult in a neighborhood where every <br/>
child has homework everyday.  Even other homeschool friends at best, <br/>
require playdates, driving long distances, and are busy doing other things <br/>
on a regular basis.  She is getting better about occupying herself.  But <br/>
she is not a loner, and it is a continual struggle dealing with her social <br/>
life, her self-perception as being so &quot;different&quot; from everyone else she <br/>
knows.  I&#39;ve been arranging playdates for her since she was 2.  I hoped it <br/>
would end once she was of school age....WRONG!!!  Oh well...what&#39;s life <br/>
without challenges!!! (LOL)<br/>
