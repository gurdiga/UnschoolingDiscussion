<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236072456">Hi there friends, <br/>
I am unsubbing for a while (maybe til the new Year) as my husband is coming<br/>
home (he&#39;s been away for 5 weeks). I will miss the discussions with you<br/>
all. Is there a website where I can read the digests of the discussions ???<br/>
when I have time?  I will wait to hear an answer before I unsub. <br/>
Thanks.<br/>

 If you go to onelist put in your e-mail address and your password your <br/>
account will come up. Change your preference to read digest or something like <br/>
that. You won&#39;t be unsubbing and you can change back whenever you like.<br/>

If you go no mail, you can still post to the group and then you would be able <br/>
to read the archives but not have anything clog up your box.... Just another <br/>
suggestion...<br/>
