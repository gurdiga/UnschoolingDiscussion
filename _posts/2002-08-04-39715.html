people pronounce those words. Here&#39;s another: The chruck crash was chragic.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That has to be a regional pronunciation!  When I pronounce nuclear, I <br/>
say noo-cleee-er.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a friend from Philadelphia who pronounces crayon like crown.  <br/>
And when she pronounces America, she says it as though the er rhymes <br/>
with were.  A-mer-ica.  I pronounce it A-mare-ica.  <br/>

learned to spell.<br/>

<br/>
Casey&#39;s early writings are so very charming. ;-) If you&#39;ve ever seen the <br/>
movie Nell with Jodie Foster, you&#39;ll have an edge on reading Casey&#39;s early <br/>
stuff. You kind of had to forget what you knew and just flow with the <br/>
letters and sounds.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

everybody, somebody, .... logical assumption that whobody was a perfectly <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924401928">I&#39;m reminded of a British child star whose Hollywood tutors tried to &quot;correct&quot; his English. <br/>
  <br/>
&quot;Fluffyan&quot; (say &quot;Philadelphian&quot; real fast&quot;) is almost a dialect unto itself. Not only do you have to understand pronunciations, you have to know forms of words (&quot;youse&quot; is familiar since Rocky, but did youse know the singular form is &quot;yiz&quot;?) and verbal shorthand in order to understand what people are saying. <br/>
&quot;Yo, did youse go da ben or walwitman downa shore?&quot; <br/>
&quot;Kin yiz stop at acame an geta baddle a wooder?&quot; <br/>
I&#39;ve heard Appalachian dialect(s?), and am fascinated with any native American speech that needs to be subtitled for wider audiences. How many other such dialects are there? Where is the line between vernacular speech and &quot;incorrect&quot; pronunciation? If you speak an &quot;improper&quot; form of the language, how do you address the issue with your kids? <br/>
