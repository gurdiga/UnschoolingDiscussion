<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616256662">The article is about increasing diversity in homeschool families.<br/>
Unschooling is mentioned too.  It doesn&#39;t sound quite like unschooling to<br/>
me, but I don&#39;t know if this is what Townsend actually said to the reporter,<br/>
or if she worded it the way she did to sound better to the general public,<br/>
or if she thinks supervising exercises based on her son&#39;s interest is<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
At least her unschooling is presented positively in the article.<br/>

Hands-on lessons - as a family Home schooling diversifies<br/>
JIM SZYMANSKI; The News Tribune<br/>
<br/>
snip----Townsend practices &quot;unschooling,&quot; a relatively new movement within<br/>
the home-school movement. Rather than dictating lessons to her sons, she<br/>
allows them to determine subjects they want to learn more about.<br/>
<br/>
For example, after her sons read a book about flying bats, Townsend said she<br/>
supervised exercises during which her sons made bat costumes, visited an art<br/>
studio to paint bats, and researched the history of bats.------</div>
