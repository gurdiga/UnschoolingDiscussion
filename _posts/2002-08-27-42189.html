<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526267519"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Educate them on how bad the school system is?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is that what we all should be doing.  Letting our friends and family<br/>
know what morons they are for having thier children in there? Or for<br/>
teaching in there?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a good point. My 80 year old mom, who sent 6 children through the <br/>
school system, has become a very vocal unschooling advocate in the <br/>
retirement home she lives in. &lt;g&gt; She tells me that the other old ladies are <br/>
amazed and really quite interested when she tells them how her grandchildren <br/>
are learning.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so proud of my mom for having such an open mind. Just as she is proud of <br/>
me for being such an involved parent with her grandchildren. I don&#39;t think <br/>
we would ever have gotten to this place of understanding though, if she <br/>
thought I was constantly being critical of the choices she made as far as <br/>
schooling goes. Or even the choices my siblings made with her other <br/>
grandchildren. They did the best they could. If I had been trying to educate <br/>
her on how bad school is, rather than how great our unschooling life is, she <br/>
would have put up a wall. Not everyone would react that way, but I know my <br/>
mom would have.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m now hoping to show the next generation (the grandchildren, <br/>
great-grandchildren...and their parents) a better way to learn. And I&#39;ve got <br/>
their 80 year old Grandma out there talking up the joys of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
