<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859851741">I&#39;m new at posting to this site, so I hope mercy will be in order. Tia, I <br/>
want to offer you support. I agree with your philosophy of personal <br/>
responsibility. I love my family and would die for them in an instant if it <br/>
were necessary. I also believe in personal responsibility, even in children. <br/>
We do our chores together as a family team, but if I have asked time and <br/>
again that something be done and it is not, I am not adverse to allowing a <br/>
little natural consequence to come into play. This is not because I am some <br/>
control freak or unloving, unenlightened mom, but because the real world does <br/>
require some modicum of self-control and responsibility and my children can <br/>
begin to learn that here in the loving forgiving realm of our home. Don&#39;t let <br/>
anyone feel you are not being a good mom because of your methods. There are <br/>
many great ways to parent, not just one. :-)  Nat<br/>

<br/>
You have the responsibility to clean it up if you take on that <br/>
responsibility.  If you have a standard of clean in your head that you want for your house <br/>
than it is your responsibility to meet that standard, no one else&#39;s. But you do <br/>
have a choice. Maybe there standard of clean is much lower and the house <br/>
hasn&#39;t reached that level yet.  And if you don&#39;t want to clean it then don&#39;t.  But <br/>
think happy thoughts about it.  (so to speak).  Don&#39;t think or say it like a <br/>
martyr.  Don&#39;t let the mess sit there and ruin your day.  Let it sit there and <br/>
think of wonderful things to do with that time.  And then you can say it with <br/>
a smile on your face. &quot;The house is a mess and I don&#39;t want to clean it so I <br/>
am going outside to fly a kite with my son or go read a book or do some <br/>
quilting (my fav). &quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Or try cleaning because you want to.  pick up those things that are really <br/>
irritating you and ask for help.  Don&#39;t ask for help making the person feel like <br/>
they have to but ask and be willing to accept a no.  And let no be OK with <br/>
you.  <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t always a me against them situation it is an us living and working <br/>
together. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151245873">&lt;&lt; So I am sitting here in my messy house thinking, I have a <br/>
responsibility to clean this up, but I don&#39;t want to, so why should <br/>
I?  Nobody else wants to share the responsibility, and I don&#39;t want <br/>
to do it, so why not just forget it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is it threatening health?  Or is it just not up to House Beautiful standards?<br/>
If the photographer&#39;s not coming, and if people are happy, that seems <br/>
preferable to people being unhappy but the house being &quot;neater.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That&#39;s how my son feels, and if you walk in his room right now, you <br/>
will see an unmade bed, piles of dirty clothes, dirty dishes, empty <br/>
glasses, food trash and empty food containers, and ants following a <br/>
little trail to his room because they know that&#39;s where the food <br/>
crumbs are. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could pick some of those dishes up and ask him to put his clothes <br/>
in the washer and smile at him and tell him you&#39;re glad he&#39;s part of your <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; You will walk by him and his hair stinks because he <br/>
refuses to take a shower and wash it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;d like to go to the swimming pool.  He could shower on the way in <br/>
and on the way out, and you could get out of the house and have a good hour just <br/>
being with him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Eventually this is going to <br/>
get to be a health hazard, but that&#39;s ok because we don&#39;t have to do <br/>
anything we don&#39;t WANT to do.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to be hostile or defensive if you don&#39;t want to, but for <br/>
various reasons sometimes people seem to think it&#39;s preferable to sweetness and <br/>
peace.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Where do we draw the line here?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Each of us draws the line different places on different days.   Each of us <br/>
has priorities.  If money and housekeeping are the first two priorities, <br/>
unschooling will be harder than if relationships and learning have higher because to <br/>
me, responsibility is doing those things that I have a duty to take <br/>
care of.  And we all have those kind of things.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Responsibility has to do with who you&#39;re answerable to for various things.  <br/>
To whom do you have to make your response?<br/>
<br/>
I know people who grew up under an oppressive load of rules and requirements <br/>
and cleanliness standards, who had REALLY clean rooms, but weren&#39;t allowed to <br/>
have company, so nobody ever saw them, and they couldn&#39;t visit elsewhere <br/>
unless they were through cleaning, and cleaning seemed never to end.    <br/>
<br/>
The mother felt responsible to voices in her head that said &quot;it&#39;s okay to <br/>
make them work, because YOU had to work, and it made you a better person.&quot;  But <br/>
the mom wasn&#39;t much of a good person.  She stayed home and she cleaned.  She <br/>
insulted her three daughters.  She swatted them with electrical cords.  <br/>
<br/>
She cared more about her relationship with the voices in her head (voices of <br/>
relatives who had been mean to her, and who weren&#39;t even alive anymore) than <br/>
in her relationship with her own children.<br/>
<br/>
Her &quot;responsibility&quot; and her priorities were not conducive to natural <br/>
learning, to a peaceful home, nor to trust.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m choosing to be responsible to my children and to my own inner child and <br/>
to my true self, knowing firsthand that parents can put children last or close <br/>
to last, and childhood doesn&#39;t last very long.   I chose when Kirby was a baby <br/>
to REALLY listen to him and BE with him.  Not just to &quot;be with him&quot; in <br/>
proximity, but to have my life be intwined with his life, not in a buying underwear <br/>
and being resentful way, but in a feeling, caring, direct way.  I paid <br/>
attention to what he liked and wondered.  I never tried to make him eat what he <br/>
didn&#39;t want to eat (and that worked out well) or make him sleep when he wasn&#39;t <br/>
sleepy (and that worked out well) or stay in a room in the dark, afraid, when he <br/>
would rather be with me or his dad (and that worked out well).<br/>
<br/>
One loving thing leads to another.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like you should ne negotiating a comfort zone of what you can <br/>
tolerate and what the rest of the family want. I used to break down and <br/>
have a major rant every few months which did no-one any good.<br/>
So I sat the kids and husband down and told them how I felt. I told them <br/>
how I felt the give and take was all take on their part and give on <br/>
mine. I told them that I didn&#39;t feel like doing laundry, cooking meals, <br/>
having sex etc etc when I felt like this.<br/>
Then they told me stuff about how some mess didn&#39;t bother them or  that <br/>
they genuinely didn&#39;t notice it.<br/>
We then discussed ways of making the family more harmonious. This <br/>
involved me not making snide comments but actually asking for help when <br/>
I needed it rather than hoping they would notice and then feeling <br/>
resentful when they didn&#39;t. It also involved me respecting the <br/>
boundaries of their bedrooms. It involved them trying to notice and <br/>
pitching in when I asked if they weren&#39;t busy.<br/>
It&#39;s not perfect of course. Kids don&#39; tnotice dirty dishes piling up in <br/>
the sink or dirty laundry on the floor but I do. They do notice however <br/>
when they run out of clothes but if it ain&#39;t by the washing machine then <br/>
I ain&#39;t doing it. Hubby discovers if I&#39;m less stressed and feeling <br/>
valued then he gets my attention.<br/>
<br/>
What you said above....I&#39;d say, no, it isn&#39;t your reponsibility unless <br/>
you make it yours.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

&gt;&gt; You have the responsibility to clean it up if you take on that<br/>
&gt;&gt; responsibility.  If you have a standard of clean in your head that you<br/>
&gt; want for your house<br/>
&gt;&gt; than it is your responsibility to meet that standard, no one else&#39;s.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s not your responsibility, unless you take it on. I am assuming that<br/>
neither your husband nor son is standing over you saying, &quot;Pick up my<br/>
underwear off the floor. Now.&quot; and forcing you to do so.<br/>
<br/>
If the underwear on the floor bother you and you pick them up, that&#39;s your<br/>
choice. If the underwear on the floor bother you and you ask the owner to<br/>
remove them, I would think they would be likely to do so unless your timing<br/>
or delivery are obstreperous, or there are some big-time family problems, in<br/>
which case it might be a good idea to get some outside help (lots of good<br/>
suggestions right here on this list today, but also family counseling, a<br/>
pastor, even a few good books on family dynamics, can all help, too.)<br/>

If this includes your husband, which it seems to, your children are unlikely <br/>
to help as long as their father does not help. Especially boys. Especially <br/>
teen boys. It sucks, but there it is.<br/>

This is really great.<br/>
Likely, there are some people wondering what this could possibly have to do <br/>
with unschooling, but it can apply to cooking/eating, taking kids on outings, <br/>
buying books, renting movies...<br/>
<br/>
The attitude of the parents is at least half of the attitude of the children. <br/>
 When children are little, their parents are their WORLD, and it can be a <br/>
safe, comforting world, or a jittery, dangerous world.   <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling won&#39;t work as well in jittery-dangerous worlds.<br/>

Yeah, it&#39;s about freedom isn&#39;t it? Freedom offered with resentment, expected<br/>
gratitude, and guilt attached, isn&#39;t freedom at all.<br/>
