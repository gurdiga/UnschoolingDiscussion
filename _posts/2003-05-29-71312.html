<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320409829">If I had to throw something away, it wouldn&#39;t be my oldest child.*****<br/>
<br/>
I am not throwing away my oldest child.<br/>
<br/>
But being an older child, I have some serious memories of feeling pushed out of the nest <br/>
by a younger sibling.****<br/>
<br/>
There is a good age difference (5+ years) between my two kids and I am sensitive to te fact Matthew may feel usurped by his sister, not only because she&#39;s here but also because she is a pretty vocal and demanding child.  They have very different personalities.  How do I balance a demanding toddler and a quiet little boy who won&#39;t say what he wants?  I feel like I&#39;ve been trying to work this out ever since we pulled him out of school and I&#39;m not getting anywhere.  Help.<br/>
