&gt; My really liberal sister had a Republican fiance for a<br/>
&gt; while. How does that work? Seriously, how do you talk<br/>
&gt; about things without getting upset with each other? I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t imagine the closest person in my life, the one I<br/>
&gt; sleep next to every night, having such different ideas<br/>
&gt; about life and the world. Juli<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmmm, this might get hard to explain but I&#39;ll try. First of all, we agree<br/>
completely on a million things that are fundamental to our lives. Like how<br/>
to raise children (family bed, child-led weaning, all that kind of stuff)<br/>
life-long self-directed learning (aka unschooling), finances, how to keep<br/>
our house, exercise, meditation, food to eat, etc. We probably agree on more<br/>
in those realms than most spouses do, and we also have almost identical<br/>
interests as we are both pilots, skydivers, scuba divers, travelers,<br/>
adventurers, etc. and so our passions are largely shared. So we have a big<br/>
base of shared interests and ideals outside of the political realm. Even on<br/>
the topic of politics, we often agree on things - for instance we are both<br/>
financial conservatives (though he is much more so than I) and we are both<br/>
environmentalists (though I am much more so than him). But when it comes<br/>
time to vote, my husband&#39;s priority is finances and mine is the environment.<br/>
Hence when it comes to candidates, he votes Republican and I vote Democrat<br/>
or Green Party. On ballot measures, we vote much closer to each other and we<br/>
also each have ideals that are outside of our standard &quot;party line&quot; as well.<br/>
For instance, we have many gay friends and both have voted to quash the<br/>
conservative anti-gay ballot measures. This year has been the hardest for us<br/>
and politics with the close election and all. We basically have to just<br/>
agree not to talk about it if we can&#39;t talk about it civilly. Sometimes we<br/>
can, but if we are tired and/or frustrated already, starting on the topic of<br/>
politics can be a bad idea :-). He knows, for instance, never ever to bring<br/>
up anything he&#39;s heard on one of those talk radio shows. To me they are just<br/>
hate-mongering and even if Rush Limbaugh or whomever does bring up some<br/>
valid points, I just can&#39;t invite that kind of negativity into my life by<br/>
listening to it.<br/>
<br/>
I guess for me, I just thank heavens that I (by sheer luck, because I was<br/>
*not* contemplating kids when I met my DH) ended up marrying someone who<br/>
shares my parenting and educational goals. I have so many good friends who<br/>
have had to battle with their spouse over not circumcising, not vaccinating,<br/>
having a home birth, breastfeeding, being a SAHM, or over unschooling or a<br/>
million other important-to-the-whole-family issues and I&#39;ve never had to go<br/>
through that. I also am thankful that my husband and I respect each other&#39;s<br/>
differences enough to put them aside when necessary. Sometimes it IS hard to<br/>
be opposite politically, but on a day to day basis we see eye to eye much<br/>
more often than not. As we run our own business and spend a whole lot of<br/>
time in each other&#39;s company, I guess that&#39;s a good thing!<br/>
