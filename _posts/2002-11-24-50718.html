<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351718661">My dh and I had a very painful separation two years ago.<br/>
It was the complete break down we had to have in order to wake up and get <br/>
help. That isn&#39;t necessary, but in our case things had gone too far.<br/>
Don&#39;t wait.<br/>
It&#39;s so very difficult to see any hope when you&#39;re on that side of things, <br/>
but it really is possible to completely change the entire relationship.<br/>
Dh and I are truly best friends now, I never thought we could have the <br/>
relationship we do now.  Bickering and anger were so common before we split <br/>
up.<br/>
We hardly EVER have disagreements now. And if we do, we know how to talk and <br/>
come to solutions.<br/>
A huge part of the healing was learning to accept the other person just the <br/>
way they are. Sounds so simple, but it was huge for us. I think we spent <br/>
years trying to  change each other. Crazy.<br/>
Anyway, counseling can be a wonderful catalyst for change. It&#39;s a safe ground <br/>
to vent, to analyze and to figure out where to go. I hope you don&#39;t just <br/>
accept the relationship the way it is today, but realize that this could be a <br/>
chance for huge change and be willing to take on the struggle and work it <br/>
takes to take a few steps in that direction. The first ones are often the <br/>
hardest. Once you create a better atmosphere it&#39;s like the snowball <br/>
effect......<br/>

That&#39;s exactly what we have.  We call it resource day....<br/>
And why starting your own group can be a perfect solution.<br/>
