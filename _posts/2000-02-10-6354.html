  There is a state website at www.mhea.org for Mississippi. I am not familiar with the area in which you are seeking. This organization is christian based but they are really helpfull as to the local contact info. In my area, all that is required is an attendance record to be filed with the attendance officer in our county (with a &quot;description&quot; of the curriculum used). Good luck and hope they choose UNschooling. I would hate to see a family d i v i d e d over the miles when UNschooling could bring them together like nothing else can! Aleasa</div>

50th with Mississippi........<br/>
Is it any wonder!?!?!?!!?!<br/>
I think this is so damn funny but sad.... not the scores, the 50th<br/>
statement.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

&lt;g&gt; Several years ago, there was a bumper sticker in SC: &quot;Thank God for <br/>
Mississippi!&quot; We were ranked 49th of 50. Poor old Mississippi! <br/>
