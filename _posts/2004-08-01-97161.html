<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377856320">I thought I had made a posting about this last night,<br/>
but it seems that for some reason it didn&#39;t go<br/>
through. I wanted to share what happened. <br/>
<br/>
The kids didn&#39;t go with me. Megan and Gracie were<br/>
napping; Sarah and Logan decided not to go at the last<br/>
minute. I missed them, and wish they had come. They&#39;d<br/>
have enjoyed it. <br/>
<br/>
After I did my part, I left the group to go to the<br/>
potty. I was stopped by a gentleman who asked for my<br/>
name to run with my picture in the paper. He asked if<br/>
I was the CG spouse who&#39;d been mentioned, and I said I<br/>
was. It turns out that the gentleman is the Public<br/>
Affairs Officer for Activities NY. We began talking,<br/>
and next thing I knew he gave me the opportunity to<br/>
write about the event for the newspaper! He also<br/>
mentioned having other events he&#39;s supposed to cover<br/>
but he&#39;s so busy that it&#39;s difficult, and if I&#39;d like<br/>
to, I can attend and write about them as well! <br/>
