<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578648000">Hi folks<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to post about our weekend in Montana, because it was a pretty <br/>
good weekend, considering. Remember when I posted about my anxiety regarding <br/>
this trip, because my mil is adamantly opposed to school at home, let alone <br/>
unschooling? Well, we had to go. Brother-in-law memorial services need <br/>
brothers, and brothers need their wives for moral support.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t bore you with the details of the trip up, except to say, don&#39;t eat <br/>
rotten onion the day before you go on a 10 hour drive. It is NOT pretty. But <br/>
we made it okay, and I went to bed instead of eating dinner, and felt much <br/>
better the next day.<br/>
<br/>
MIL was not cranky nor verbose about anything, even the homeschooling. She <br/>
got a chance to see my son&#39;s polite interactions with adults he&#39;d never met <br/>
before, heard about Abbie&#39;s theater experiences and job-hunting woes, and <br/>
talked to Katie a little bit about reading (completely non-judgmentally, <br/>
too, which completely surprised me). Most of their time was spent outside.<br/>
<br/>
What we did while in Montana. Petted Aunt Rene&#39;s Greater Pyrennies (sp?) <br/>
puppies, hung out at The Project (an apartment house that is being <br/>
refurbished by my mil and bil&#39;s), watched a sand sculptor begin a figure of <br/>
Lewis & Clark outside the art museum. Katie spent three hours on Saturday <br/>
with the artist, making her own sculpture in the sand, of a dog lying on its <br/>
side. We are now researching where to find some of that kind of sand for our <br/>
side yard. Inside the art museum, we voted on our favorite pieces from the <br/>
Middle School arts class as well as the Montana Water Color society show, <br/>
and we also looked at displays of glass art and peeked in upstairs where the <br/>
classes are held. Shopped a little bit, but didn&#39;t buy anything. Katie&#39;s <br/>
going to start working on a walking stick of her own, rather than fork out <br/>
$22.00 for one at an art gift shop.<br/>
<br/>
We searched for, but didn&#39;t find, a geocache around the corner from mil&#39;s <br/>
house. It was near the Old Folks&#39; Pond, which is actually a water bird <br/>
refuge. That was cool. We saw ducks, red winged black birds, chickadees, and <br/>
heard the call of some big bird that we never saw. Got our feet muddy. <br/>
Helped with dinner clean up, visited with old aunts and neighbors and <br/>
cousins. I caught up with sis-in-laws, while the kids caught up with cousins <br/>
we hadn&#39;t seen in years.<br/>
<br/>
On the drive home Sunday morning, we stopped in Livingston for breakfast, <br/>
and there was a candy store attached to the restaurant, selling all <br/>
varieties of candy by the pound. We asked prices; I gave each kid two bucks, <br/>
and they spent a half hour dipping and weighing and estimating how much <br/>
they&#39;d spent. Each of them ended up with lots of jelly bellies and gummy <br/>
candies, and one rock candy each. The rock candies featured largely in part <br/>
of the drive from there.<br/>
<br/>
They became dylithium crystals, and Abbie became Jean Luc Picard/Geordi; <br/>
Robby became Data/Riker/Wesley and Katie became Dr. Crusher/Counsellor Troy. <br/>
The Crystals were useful not only as an energy source, but also for <br/>
diagnosing illnesses and beaming them onto enemy ships. The enemy ships were <br/>
all around us, cloaked to look like Earth Automobiles. And I thought letting <br/>
them buy and eat all that sugar would make them restless and cranky! Mind <br/>
you, this is a 17 year old big sister, with a 12 year old bro and a 10 year <br/>
old wiggle-worm sister, who had already spent four hours sitting together <br/>
back there.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the drive we played Alphabet Sentence, and came up with some <br/>
doozies. &quot;Montana Needs Opal Peaks Quite Robust, Starting To Undulate <br/>
Violently When eXXcellent Young Zephyrs Attack Bison, Careening Dangerously <br/>
Everywhere From Gargantuan Hills, Is Just Kinetic Life.&quot; there were others, <br/>
but...you get the picture.<br/>
<br/>
That was a good break.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, heidi C</div>

 </span></blockquote>Speaking of silly car games, DS has picked up on one of the bits <br/>
from Who&#39;s Line is it Anyway - it&#39;s the one where one actor plays <br/>
the scene as the &quot;straight man&quot; and the other two (I suppose you <br/>
could do more as well) actors only have 2 sentences each - they can <br/>
use them over and over but just the same two sentences. We played in <br/>
the car while waiting for the movie to start at the drive-in Friday <br/>
night (Star Wars Episode III!). We set a scene, then the two silly <br/>
parties picked their lines - one time I picked &quot;I&#39;m right behind <br/>
you&quot; and &quot;Are you sure?&quot; We&#39;d go along until it ran out of steam, <br/>
stop, pick another &quot;straight man&quot;, another scene, new sentences, and <br/>
go on. Two adults and an almost 7 yr old, we spent probably 45 <br/>
minutes playing this game and giggling.<br/>
