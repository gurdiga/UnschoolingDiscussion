<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927233660">Hey folks.. We are leaving today to go go Williamsburg, VA for a <br/>
week!  We are so excited.. We are going with another unschooling <br/>
family, 3 daughters and the mother.   We have never been to Wlmsbrg, <br/>
although the other family has been before.   If anyone has been to <br/>
Colonial Williamsburg, do you have any &quot;must sees&quot;?   The main <br/>
decision we have to make is whether or not to do Jamestown/Yorktown.  <br/>
We are on a budget, and we may not have enough to buy tickets to <br/>
those attractions.   The other family IS going To JT/YT, but they are <br/>
not buying tickets to  Col. Wlmbsbrg, since they have been before.  <br/>
We are buying the Heritage passes for Wlmsbrg, which are good for a <br/>
year.   Anything mentionable about the area, the attractions, <br/>
restuarants, etc.. would be appreciated.   I am taking a laptop, so I <br/>
will be able to check my email.  Oh, for those who do not know me, my <br/>
kids are dd, 14, ds, 12 and ds 8, so they are all old enough to do <br/>
some &quot;intensive&quot; touring and to enjoy the exhibits.    <br/>
<br/>
THANKS<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755185883">Definitely have the kids dress up. You can rent costumes at the Visitor&#39;s Center (the one in town is closed for the winter). Although it&#39;s pricy, it is sooo much fun! I would do this over a carriage ride, given the choice.<br/>
<br/>
Also try to see the Powell House (It&#39;s just outside the main village area, behind the Capitol. There&#39;s lots of hands-on stuff there (you can climb on the bed to try it out) and a working kitchen. The fife and drum parade is lots of fun too, and you can follow it as it goes by.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun! I love it there!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-884787786">My suggestion would be to do Jamestown/Yorktown ONLY<br/>
if  you are ready to be outside a lot, and cold.  The<br/>
weather is FREEZING here in VA (the top temp today is<br/>
26), with snow expected this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Everything at Jamestown is outside.  <br/>
<br/>
You would be better off really doing Williamsburg well<br/>
by buying multi-day passes and going at the kids&#39;<br/>
speed and enjoying it.  Ride in the horse drawn<br/>
carriage, eat peanut soup, buy 3-cornered hats, rock<br/>
candy, and enjoy the apothecary.  It is a lot of<br/>
walking, but popping into the shops keeps you warm.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you get this before you go...<br/>
<br/>
Susan<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850248927">Here is my only suggestion, pick a place to meet in case you get separated. <br/>
We meant to do that and forgot and did get separated. It was my Mom, my 2 boys <br/>
and myself. My Mom and I both thought we knew what the other would do but we <br/>
were both wrong and it really put a damper on our vacation there.<br/>
<br/>
This advice holds true for any trip and I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s something most people <br/>
do but thought I would send this as a reminder anyhow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599424944">Be sure to check out the bakery behind Raleigh Tavern. They have <br/>
*wonderful* ginger cakes - big soft gingerbread cookies. We get a baker&#39;s <br/>
dozen and have them for breakfast and snacks. We bring home a couple extra <br/>
dozen to snack on for the next week or so. If they get dried out/hard, you <br/>
can warm them in the microwave... yum!<br/>
