<div id="ygrps-yiv-758756280">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that has beneficial to me as a homeschooling mom <br/>
who is transitioning to unschooling (since we didn&#39;t start out that <br/>
way) is to keep a little log of what my kids do during the day. I <br/>
have a special calendar just for this purpose and I just jot down <br/>
&quot;Casablanca&quot; or X-Box Halo or Discovery Channel Temple of <br/>
Artemis. I was one of those who was worried that &quot;all my kids <br/>
would do all day is watch TV and play X-box left to themselves.&quot; <br/>
What&#39;s been so wonderful about my little, informal log is that it is <br/>
physical proof *to myself* that my kids are doing far more than <br/>
TV and X box. It also is a way for me to track the <br/>
interconnectedness of their learning which is uncluding TV and <br/>
X-box. :)<br/>
<br/>
For example, my kids love to watch Jackie Chan cartoon on <br/>
Saturday mornings. Last week we were reading In the Year of <br/>
the Boar and Jackie Robinson aloud. Both of these have tie ins <br/>
to China which led us to reading more about China. We went on <br/>
a binge of figuring out our Chinese birth year names. (Mine is the <br/>
Year of the White Cow...) Then we went from that to the <br/>
constellations and various ways that other cultures count years <br/>
and keep calendars (solar, lunar or solar/lunar).<br/>
<br/>
Then the kids got interested in the Silk Road which ends or <br/>
begins in China (they liked the book we found at the library <br/>
because it&#39;s introduced by Yo Yo Ma, someone they respect and <br/>
love from having heard of him originally on Arthur, the PBS <br/>
cartoon... do you see where this is going yet?). Anyway, we were <br/>
reading along about China and the Silk Route and the kids <br/>
wanted to read about cultural celebrations in China.<br/>
<br/>
So we took out another book on celebrations and in it, it circled <br/>
back to the Chinese zodiac. It wasn&#39;t until this book that I realized <br/>
that the Chinese zodiac is actually a 12 year cycle, not 12 <br/>
months. My 8 yo boy suddenly blurts out: I know the characters of <br/>
the Chinese zodiac and all their powers! I was shocked. &quot;How do <br/>
you know that Liam?&quot; They&#39;re on Jackie Chan! Then he <br/>
proceeded to look at the pictures and tell me all the names and <br/>
each of their personalities. Full circle.<br/>
<br/>
This interweaving of pop culture, TV, and cartoons with history, <br/>
religion, holidays, geography... well it literally floored me. And I&#39;m <br/>
pretty sure that if I hadn&#39;t been keeping that log, I would have <br/>
forgotten some of the connections. For me, the log gives me a <br/>
sense of ownership and also reassurance during the transition. <br/>
I also think it will be easier for me at the end of the year to pull <br/>
together the stuff we&#39;ve done into come kind of coherent picture <br/>
for the year end assessment (Ohio requires this or testing).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just wanted to share another part of my process, <br/>
especially since so manyare trying to make the transiton from <br/>
one way of learning to this newer, more insecure world of <br/>
unschooling. :)<br/>

We watched Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon the other day,  we ended up doing the same learning circle and I was so excited to see that Yo-Yo played music for it!<br/>

Love that movie!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029446974">Hey Julie.. just wanted to say, nice to see you back here. I thought you had <br/>
left!!  <br/>
<br/>
I think the journal thing is a good idea if folks are worried about thier <br/>
kids&quot;getting what they need&quot;    I know a journal like that would go a long <br/>
way in helping me during the interrogations I get from family and friends <br/>
about what my kids are doing.. LOL..  For me, I know my kids get &quot;what they <br/>
need&quot; as far as what they learn.   If they &quot;need&quot;  to  know something.. how <br/>
to do something, how something works.. they ask me and I will help them <br/>
figure it out.    <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, the &#39;academic&quot; part is a non issue for me.   I get it.. I do it. <br/>
 I understand it.   Thats the easiet part to me in this lifestyle.  Its all <br/>
the other parenting issues that are more difficult to implement.   And some <br/>
of those are non issues as well.    Foods, TV, games, .. not an issue.. not a <br/>
problem with no restrictions, no limitation( probably becasue I never limited <br/>
them in the first place).    I want to be the same way with bedtimes and <br/>
video game stuff, but there have been ( and continue to be) some challanges <br/>
there.   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Teresa, perhaps a log would be helpful here? I know when I see <br/>
things in big global issues I tend not to notice incremental <br/>
changes. But if you were able to see gradual progress toward <br/>
your ideals rather than trying to &quot;cure&quot; them over night with the <br/>
ideology, perhaps you&#39;d be encouraged.<br/>
<br/>
For me, academics wasn&#39;t the issue so much as lack of <br/>
regulation for what I saw as &quot;extras.&quot; So that&#39;s why it felt <br/>
important for me to simply be aware of how all these parts fit <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
I want to be the same way with bedtimes and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; video game stuff, but there have been ( and continue to be) <br/>
 </span></blockquote>some challanges <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; there.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, if your log showed that out of two weeks, one night your <br/>
kids all got ready and went to bed without any inducements from <br/>
you and treated your dh with respect while he slept... and then in <br/>
the next ten days did that twice, you might feel there was less of <br/>
a problem than when viewed globallyall together. Or perhaps <br/>
you could sort of keep track of what worked: snuggling son #1 to <br/>
sleep works better than it works for son #2...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don&#39;t have a cure but thought I&#39;d throw it out for you to <br/>
consider.<br/>

Julie, I love these stories, and I&#39;ve saved yours!  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
In the car the other night Holly was singing a song from a Simpsons CD.  She <br/>
doesn&#39;t know the original.  It&#39;s &quot;When I was Seventeen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Homer Simpsons lyrics she was singing were<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When I was seventeen, I drank a very good beer<br/>
I drank a very good beer I purchased with a fake ID<br/>
My  name was Brian McGee, I stayed up listening to King -  QUEEN! (she <br/>
corrected herself)<br/>
When I was seventeen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I will make it my (leisurely) task to find a copy of the original song, <br/>
someday, so she&#39;ll see how close the parody was! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But she turned to me and said &quot;What&#39;s Queen?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I told her it was a band from the 80&#39;s and she&#39;d heard some of their <br/>
stuff, and I&#39;d play her some later.<br/>
<br/>
I found a cassette tape with &quot;Queen&#39;s Greatest Hits&quot; written in my <br/>
handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
We worked a jigsaw puzzle while we listened.  She&#39;s familiar with Bohemian <br/>
Rhapsody from Wayne&#39;s World and from Weird Al&#39;s version, the Bohemian Polka <br/>
(very same everything, but polka style with accordian, and fast dance tempo).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We Are the Champions&quot; came on and I said &quot;Remember, they used that in The <br/>
Mighty Ducks?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said a bit later, &quot;So they used TWO Queen songs in the Mighty Ducks?&quot;  I <br/>
had forgotten they used &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; too.<br/>
<br/>
It came to one song there (I&#39;m not remembering which one but will follow up <br/>
when I ID it) and she said &quot;Hey, I&#39;ve heard this but I thought it was the <br/>
Beatles, maybe, or Herman&#39;s Hermits.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cool!!<br/>
<br/>
And that from the Simpsons.<br/>
<br/>
We also talked about &quot;musicians&#39; musicians,&quot; musicianship, different musical <br/>
styles, harmonies, and AIDS.<br/>

It might also make it easier to see buildup and triggers early enough to<br/>

been very helpful to my daughter, who has one of those extreme kids.<br/>
