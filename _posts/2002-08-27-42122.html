 </span></blockquote>My point is that your words are not conveying your meaning.<br/>
<br/>
Do you really mean that unschoolers (which implies at least a large<br/>
percentage) know who Frank Smith is? That&#39;s what your words say.<br/>
<br/>
Do you really mean that unschoolers spend a lot of time thinking about the<br/>
school system? That&#39;s what the words &quot;seriously&quot; and &quot;now see&quot; and the<br/>
emotionally charged &quot;bureaucratic monopoly&quot; and &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot;<br/>
implies. If they are they have been mysteriously silent about it for the 8<br/>
years I&#39;ve been on message boards and lists. What unschoolers do discuss,<br/>
what they have been discussing online for years and years is the specific<br/>
damage done to their child, their guilt at having allowed it to happen and<br/>
what they can do about it. That&#39;s what this list helps to address.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m not being Ms. Editor who knows what you mean and am just picking on<br/>
your wording to humiliate you. I couldn&#39;t even begin to discuss your ideas<br/>
because your words are getting in the way.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not an invitation for you to explain your ideas. It&#39;s been pointed<br/>
out numerous times that this list can&#39;t accomodate the type of political<br/>
discussion you want to have.<br/>
<br/>
Many many statements you&#39;ve made are like that. And many many statements<br/>
you&#39;ve made seem to be really what you mean but are equally untrue. (As<br/>
examples (but not as invitations to rehash them): The Bryants fighting for<br/>
the rights of homeschoolers in Mass. Apparently the Utah father who was<br/>
shot.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919622790">I have never ever posted here before and have subbed and unsubbed at <br/>
various times, based on my interest in the list.  Hey!  That&#39;s really <br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t it?  :)<br/>
<br/>
But I am finding the discussions about Ned&#39;s posts particularly <br/>
interesting.  I know Ned from some other lists I am on and have a <br/>
couple of comments inserted in the post below for anyone interested:<br/>

&gt;Joyce again: <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you really mean that unschoolers (which implies at least a large<br/>
&gt; percentage) know who Frank Smith is? That&#39;s what your words say.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know the original reason Frank Smith was brought <br/>
up, but I know of Frank Smith and I found him on my own, in the <br/>
process of unschooling.  I read a book authored by him that I saw at <br/>
the library and remember thinking, Wow, this guy sounds a lot like <br/>
John Holt in that he is a person who worked in the school system and <br/>
sees lots of problems.  And I remember some of his ideas were very <br/>
unschoolish in nature.  I was excited that there was someone alive <br/>
that might continue to write books similar to Holt&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you really mean that unschoolers spend a lot of time thinking <br/>
about the<br/>
&gt; school system? <br/>
<br/>
Well, yeah.  I do.  I have learned so much by getting into <br/>
unschooling and my personal interests have been very strong into <br/>
schools and how they operate, which led into politics, which led me <br/>
to libertarian thought, which led me to realize I needed much more <br/>
personal education about economic thought, etc., etc.  It&#39;s very easy <br/>
for me to see how this could happen with an unschooler who cares <br/>
about education in general.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;If they are they have been mysteriously silent about it for the 8<br/>
&gt; years I&#39;ve been on message boards and lists. <br/>
<br/>
Guess you haven&#39;t been on the right lists. :)  Ah, does that imply <br/>
that this list isn&#39;t the right place for that kind of thought?  <br/>
Maybe, maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What unschoolers do discuss,<br/>
&gt; what they have been discussing online for years and years is the <br/>
specific<br/>
&gt; damage done to their child, their guilt at having allowed it to <br/>
happen and<br/>
&gt; what they can do about it. That&#39;s what this list helps to address.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I&#39;m not being Ms. Editor who knows what you mean and am just <br/>
picking on<br/>
&gt; your wording to humiliate you. I couldn&#39;t even begin to discuss <br/>
your ideas<br/>
&gt; because your words are getting in the way.<br/>
<br/>
Ned is not very tactful when it comes to discussing schools and how <br/>
bad they are.  I like that.  It&#39;s good to hear someone tell it like <br/>
it is.  As with a lot of people, you have to sometimes get past how <br/>
they like to express thoughts and then discuss it with them if you <br/>
like.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s not an invitation for you to explain your ideas. It&#39;s been <br/>
pointed<br/>
&gt; out numerous times that this list can&#39;t accomodate the type of <br/>
political<br/>
&gt; discussion you want to have.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is the case and maybe not.  What I am saying is that the <br/>
area of politics IS as much about unschooling to some people as <br/>
learning to make your own peanut butter sandwich or discussing the <br/>
kissing abilities of past boyfriends.<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t get is why an unschooling list, which has such an <br/>
extreme volume of mail anyway, can&#39;t let the readers be unschoolish <br/>
and decide which posts they want to read and participate in while <br/>
ignoring or deleting other posts they aren&#39;t interested in.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand not wanting the list to look like it&#39;s turned into a <br/>
list for a particular subject even if that subject happens to be very <br/>
interesting to the the unschoolers posting.  And yet, for <br/>
unschoolers, it&#39;s important to be able to hear the direction that <br/>
other unschoolers&#39; lives took after they began following their own <br/>
interests along with their children.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, that was fun.  Maybe I&#39;ll post here again soon.  But I&#39;ll have <br/>
to learn more to figure out what is and unschooling topic and what <br/>
isn&#39;t.<br/>
