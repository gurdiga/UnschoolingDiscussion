<div id="ygrps-yiv-587985847">Hi Tracy!  Nice to &quot;see&quot; you again too!<br/>
<br/>
I have also heard the Ames (sp?) series on child development is good. <br/>
Obviously, each child is unique. But it can help to have an idea of<br/>
things that are typical (normal?) at different ages.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-927799683">***If they &#39;know&#39; when a child is &#39;supposed&#39; to be able to do a certain<br/>
thing, they worry when it doesn&#39;t happen.  I&#39;ve seen a lot of posts from<br/>
different places that hint towards this. ***<br/>

But that&#39;s not really what you learn when you study child development theories. Read some of Piaget&#39;s work, it still holds up. It&#39;s more about how the mind develops and it&#39;s ability to understand certain concepts at varying ages. It&#39;s less about what a child should be able to do at an age, and more about concepts they absolutely won&#39;t grasp BEFORE certain ages. And the age range is pretty wide....<br/>
If you study child development and then look at the school model, it&#39;s rather shocking the way they &quot;teach&quot; children. You&#39;d think that the folks working as teachers had never studied child development at all...because they certainly would never be trying to push a child to put numbers on paper and think it meant anything to your average six year old. Sheesh.<br/>

appropriate curriculum -- delayed academics, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Then they do worksheets so the kids can &quot;learn their letters&quot; and be <br/>
ready for kindergarten.<br/>
<br/>
NEVER trust a preschool brochure - I&#39;ve seen some of the very worst <br/>
preschools have the best-sounding play-oriented, child-friendly <br/>
sounding brochures.<br/>

<br/>
Right.  And the ages are very &quot;more or less,&quot; but the progression of how <br/>
understanding and thought grow are likely going to happen in each child.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one site with a summary:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eagle2.american.edu/~gb3107a/piaget.htm">http://www.eagle2.american.edu/~gb3107a/piaget.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
For a bad example, my mother used to claim that my infant brother, at six <br/>
months, could understand every word she said, and that when he ignored her he was <br/>
being manipulative.   I hope I never hear a worse example than that.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing parents can benefit from knowing (though in a peaceful, happy <br/>
unschooling home it&#39;s not much of an issue) is &quot;Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs&quot; <br/>
which says (among other things) that someone who is afraid or hungry can&#39;t care <br/>
about anything else but getting those needs met.   So there&#39;s no educational <br/>
sense in telling a child who hasn&#39;t had breakfast that if he doesn&#39;t learn to <br/>
spell these words you&#39;re going to hit him with a stick and then withhold lunch. <br/>
 Therefor schools have government funded lunch an breakfast programs.   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just pulled the first Maslow reference that showed a chart:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://web.utk.edu/~gwynne/maslow.HTM">http://web.utk.edu/~gwynne/maslow.HTM</a><br/>
<br/>
If either of those seems interesting, just go to google, put in either<br/>
maslow hierarchy <br/>
or<br/>
piaget stages<br/>
<br/>
and you&#39;ll get tons of stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re really easy concepts, and I think they&#39;re helpful for homeschooling <br/>
parents to know.<br/>
