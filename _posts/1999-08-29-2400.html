<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711727081">Sandy,  Thank you for your response.  I feel very similar to you regarding<br/>
Waldorf Schools and Homeschooling, although I didn&#39;t have the time or<br/>
patience to research and study as much as you.  My understanding was tha<br/>
Steiner had created the Kindergarten to resemble a home-like environment for<br/>
the workers&#39; children who couldn&#39;t be at home but that a real home<br/>
environment was preferable.<br/>
<br/>
Karen and Nancy--regarding people having kids that intend to put them into<br/>
daycare/school all day, etc.--<br/>
<br/>
I too am astounded at this attitude about children.  I live in a pretty<br/>
affluent &quot;yuppy&quot; area and see this a lot.  I actually have a friend at<br/>
church with 2 children the ages of mine (6 and 2) who is a Social Worker by<br/>
profession.  HSe told me after the youngest was born that she finally found<br/>
a good childcare center for him and her daughter was starting Kind. that<br/>
year so she was going back to work fulltime.  She changed jobs and was no<br/>
longer in direct social work, instead she would be doing more administrative<br/>
type stuff. She then said, &quot;I&#39;ll still have my Stephen Ministry work at<br/>
church to fulfill my nurturing needs.&quot;  I wanted to say, &quot;why don&#39;t you<br/>
nurture your kids intead?????&quot; but bit my tongue (guess I&#39;m not that<br/>
outspoken old lady yet!)  Often she brings her girl to children&#39;s choir in<br/>
the afternoons at church and doesn&#39;t have the 2 year old with her---she<br/>
leaves him at daycare so she doesn&#39;t &quot;have to bother with him while<br/>
&quot;daughter&quot; is in choir practice!&quot;  The rest of us Mom&#39;s have infants,<br/>
toddlers and sometimes older siblings all playing at our feet and with<br/>
eachother while waiting for siblings in choir.  She also is one that asks me<br/>
how I can homeschool because she would be bored at home all day with kids<br/>
and doesn&#39;t know how I get time to myself, etc.  I&#39;m never bored and my kids<br/>
are independant enough that I get many moments during the day to &quot;do my own<br/>
thing&quot;  I especially like that I don&#39;t have to live my life according to the<br/>
school&#39;s schedule and drive my kids all over kingdom come.<br/>
<br/>
Enough out of me for now!<br/>
