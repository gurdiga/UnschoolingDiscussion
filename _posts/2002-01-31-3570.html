<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031145404">I just could not NOT respond about the experience/age<br/>
thing.<br/>
While I do not doubt that experience has some value, <br/>
it seems to me a poor way to judge some one.  I can<br/>
understand that some one whose child is 5 has not had<br/>
the experience of &#39;raising&#39; (I really despise that<br/>
word, but lack the creativity at this moment to<br/>
replace it) a 10 year old.  However, that does not<br/>
mean they do not have the knowledge and/or<br/>
understanding of what a 10 year old goes through or<br/>
the memories of being the 10 year old.  Those can be<br/>
very valuable and sometimes extrememly insightful<br/>
points of view that are often ignored.  I know many,<br/>
far too many, adults who think they know it all about<br/>
&#39;raising&#39; kids because they have had 4 that are now<br/>
adults.  But the truth is, their experience of raising<br/>
kids is far from my ideals and my experiences of being<br/>
a kid.  Their experience only helps me from the what<br/>
not to do point of view.  Their advice is useless to<br/>
me.  Experience does not necessarily mean knowledge,<br/>
understanding, or &quot;good&quot; advice.<br/>
<br/>
I have been called, more than once, young and<br/>
idealistic.  It was meant as an insult, but I took it<br/>
as a compliment.  Idealism can cause wonderful things<br/>
to happen.  Idealism can be just as valuable as<br/>
experience, it is what gets people on this path in the<br/>
first place.  Those of us who are &#39;new&#39; to unschooling<br/>
are idealistic.  We see this theory, this way of life,<br/>
that for some reason fits us and our beliefs.  One can<br/>
fully understand the ideas without the experience from<br/>
the parent perspective.  I may not have the experience<br/>
of unschooling for x amount of years, but I have an<br/>
understanding of it from my experiences with learning.<br/>
 I can watch children and see how they learn without<br/>
directly &#39;raising&#39; them.<br/>
<br/>
Age....I have a huge problem with people classifying<br/>
others intelligence, wisdom, or understanding by their<br/>
age.  I know some people who are pretty old, 90, that<br/>
do not know half of what I do.  Yes, she has the<br/>
experience of living every age up to that one, but the<br/>
WAY she lived it does not provide her with knowledge<br/>
or wisdom.   Does age really matter?  I do not think<br/>
so.  I have heard on here, as well as from some<br/>
relatives, that people change at 30.  I think that is<br/>
such a unrealistic pre-judgement of people.  Some<br/>
people never grow up, some do at young ages.  Some<br/>
children have more wisdom to offer than some 80 year<br/>
olds.  <br/>
<br/>
Until one really knows another person, it is IMO,<br/>
somewhat foolish to discount their opinions simply<br/>
because they are young and inexperienced.  It would<br/>
also be foolish to assume just because some one is<br/>
older and has children that are grown, that they know<br/>
everything about parenting or nothing about it.  I<br/>
actually assumed that experienced unschoolers would<br/>
not judge others by age, experience, or other<br/>
arbitrary means....I assumed they would have a better<br/>
grasp of the diverse ways in which people grow and<br/>
learn and come to wisdom. I was foolish to assume<br/>
that.  <br/>
While I think it is a good suggestion that people read<br/>
and listen more on here, I think it is a good<br/>
suggestion for everyone, not just new unschoolers or<br/>
people with young children.<br/>
Perhaps we could all learn more from one another if<br/>
our pre-judgements were put aside.  The new<br/>
unschoolers may say something that an experienced one<br/>
can learn from, but if you discount it because they<br/>
are new you may miss out.<br/>
<br/>
Peace.<br/>
<br/>
Namaste,<br/>

<br/>
Sure.  Absolutely.  <br/>
<br/>
What I have found, however, is that reality and experience often alter my <br/>
inner understanding of how those ideas affect me and my family.  An idea, a <br/>
theory, is one thing.  Applying it to one&#39;s life, that&#39;s another stage.  And <br/>
life with a 10 year old, while there&#39;s that constant of love and affection <br/>
and idealism running though our relationship, is different from life with a <br/>
five year old.<br/>
<br/>
And life isn&#39;t pure, eh?  What starts out as a pure idealistic theory, can be <br/>
amazingly altered and enhanced by the activities and reactions of a real life <br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;ve learned anything as a parent, it&#39;s that awareness -- that willingness <br/>
to gauge and ponder, to listen and observe, to bend and stretch -- to dance <br/>
with ideas and theory, not to place them on a pedestal or mark them <br/>
&quot;understood&quot; and shelve them away -- that has most helped me grow.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what people offer here, methinks.  The experience which enriches the <br/>
theory.  Not to say, I understand it better than someone new -- but to say, <br/>
here&#39;s another way this works.<br/>

first place. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sure.  There&#39;s nobody here who hasn&#39;t been younger, and probably more <br/>
idealistic.  <br/>
So it&#39;s kind of like people whose kids have ONLY been in school telling <br/>
homeschoolers about homeschooling.  They might have watched other <br/>
homeschoolers, but they don&#39;t know what it feels like to take your kids out, <br/>
or to be in the midst of the responsibility of that thirteen years of <br/>
abstinence from the government program that parents whose kids never went to <br/>
school experience at some point.<br/>
<br/>
So those with experience remember youth and idealism.<br/>
Those with youth and idealism can&#39;t really imagine how experience feels.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Experience does not necessarily mean knowledge,<br/>
understanding, or &quot;good&quot; advice.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In any specific instance, that is true.<br/>
<br/>
On this particular list, the experience of someone who has unschooled a <br/>
school-aged child successfully and is calm about it SHOULD be considered <br/>
valuable to new readers, new unschoolers, and those with pre-schoolage kids.<br/>
<br/>
Because you know what?  Until the day your child is of an age to be required <br/>
to attend school and the bus passes by and he stays home, you&#39;re not <br/>
unschooling.  You can be planning to, and you can be bravely ignoring <br/>
pressure to put him in a fancy pre-school like your neighbors and relatives <br/>
do, but anyone whose child is four or five could still yet decide to put him <br/>
in school.  He&#39;s at home like any other four or five year old could be <br/>
legally at home with the parents TOTALLY intending to put him in public <br/>
school for over a decade.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Age....I have a huge problem with people classifying<br/>
others intelligence, wisdom, or understanding by their<br/>
age. ... Does age really matter?  I do not think<br/>
so. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you seal this in an envelope, date it for ten years from now, and report <br/>
back to us please?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I think that is<br/>
such a unrealistic pre-judgement of people. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
PRE judgement?  How about the experience of people who used to be under 30 <br/>
and knew hundreds of people who were too, who grew through that, who have <br/>
known hundreds or thousands of people grow from teens, through twenties,  to <br/>
thirties and they&#39;ve seen a pattern?<br/>
<br/>
WE have been under and over thirty.<br/>
Those who have not can&#39;t tell us we&#39;re unrealistic and &quot;pre-judging.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is it pre-judgment if I don&#39;t expect a ten month old baby to walk?<br/>
Does it prove anything about babies as a class of people if one walks at nine <br/>
months?<br/>
<br/>
Is it pre-judgment if I tell the parent of a six year old who isn&#39;t talking <br/>
plainly that speech therapy will cause more damage than good for a kid who&#39;s <br/>
not in school at all?  That&#39;s experience.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Some<br/>
children have more wisdom to offer than some 80 year<br/>
olds.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but that&#39;s not from experience.  That&#39;s from thoughtful awareness.  And <br/>
there is a huge amount of that on this list, as well.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Until one really knows another person, it is IMO,<br/>
somewhat foolish to discount their opinions simply<br/>
because they are young and inexperienced.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d been on this list since the beginning, you would have known that <br/>
this last Monday was not an average day, nor a happy day.  And most of the <br/>
noise was being made by people who either weren&#39;t unschoolers, or who were <br/>
new to it, or whose kids were really small.  That&#39;s just rude.  And my <br/>
request that people read a while first was reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I<br/>
actually assumed that experienced unschoolers would<br/>
not judge others by age, experience, or other<br/>
arbitrary means....I assumed they would have a better<br/>
grasp of the diverse ways in which people grow and<br/>
learn and come to wisdom.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Insults won&#39;t make us think more of your wisdom and judgment.  If you thought <br/>
they would, you need to get more experience.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;While I think it is a good suggestion that people read<br/>
and listen more on here, I think it is a good<br/>
suggestion for everyone, not just new unschoolers or<br/>
people with young children.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Experienced unschoolers would not have made the arguments being made on <br/>
Monday.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Perhaps we could all learn more from one another if<br/>
our pre-judgements were put aside. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It happens all the time.  And invariably, after a few years, unschoolers say <br/>
&quot;I thought I knew so much when I started, but now that I&#39;ve really lived it <br/>
it&#39;s so natural.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a profound difference between reciting the rules for riding a bicycle <br/>
and critiquing others&#39; bike riding and discussing the history of bicycles, <br/>
and actually being able to ride a bike under adverse conditions without <br/>
consciously thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The new<br/>
unschoolers may say something that an experienced one<br/>
can learn from, but if you discount it because they<br/>
are new you may miss out.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I WAS discounting things that were being said on Monday, not because the <br/>
people were new, but because what they were saying was not going to work in <br/>
the context of unschooling, and they weren&#39;t backing off from saying it, <br/>
insultingly, in the presence of my well-behaved guests who were already at <br/>
the party.<br/>

needs change.  I am not saying that because some one<br/>

to me, however, that people were questioning whether<br/>
some one could understand it without the experience. <br/>
Perhaps I misunderstood, or the wording was not clear,<br/>

I think the intent behind the words was unperceived in your rush to take it <br/>
personally.  As hostess/list owner, I have a responsibility to those who have <br/>
peacefully assembled.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even think it was your posts that were the problem the other day.  I <br/>
wasn&#39;t reading names so much as content (as usual), so it&#39;s okay not to <br/>
remind me one way or the other.  But you&#39;re defending other people on <br/>
principle, I think, which at this point is a waste of defense, as one dropped <br/>
the list and two have paused a bit to catch the rhythm of the discussions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wouldn&#39;t it depend on the experience?  One can have<br/>
youth, idealism, and experience.  The experience may<br/>
not be as a parent, but as the child, or aunt, etc. <br/>
It is not the same experience, but valuable experience<br/>
none the less.  We each have our own way of<br/>
interpretting and experiencing things that plays a<br/>
part as well.<br/>

not always going to be valuable to those people<br/>
because they may have a different ideal of what<br/>
unschooling is and they experience things differently.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree because of how I see unschooling.  I see it<br/>
as a way of life that can start from birth.  It does<br/>
not really have to do with school, but with how we<br/>
live.  <br/>
<br/>

gain wisdom, etc.  But that it has little to nothing<br/>
to do with age and has to do with who I am, my<br/>
personality, and my goals.  <br/>

ages.  There are always people who do not fit in the<br/>
patterns.  And your experience of being under thirty<br/>
could be VERY different from mine.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; WE have been under and over thirty.<br/>
&gt; Those who have not can&#39;t tell us we&#39;re unrealistic<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you are judging me strictly by my age, then I<br/>
would, and feel right in saying so, that you were<br/>
pre-judging me, regardless of your experience.  Your<br/>
experience is not mine, your personality is not mine,<br/>
so you really could not judge me rightly just from<br/>
knowing my age.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Is it pre-judgment if I don&#39;t expect a ten month old<br/>
&gt; baby to walk?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would say any expectation is a pre-judgment.  My son<br/>
walked at 10 months, I did not expect it, I judged<br/>
wrongly that he would not walk until around 12 months.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does it prove anything about babies as a class of<br/>
&gt; people if one walks at nine <br/>
&gt; months?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It proves that the standard, the usual, is not always.<br/>
 That expectations based on experience are not always<br/>
correct in judging another.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  And my <br/>
&gt; request that people read a while first was<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.<br/>
I think it would be a reasonable request to anyone<br/>
first joining a list, whether experienced or not<br/>
because the dynamics of the list may not fit them and<br/>
their definitions for unschooling, or whatever the<br/>
list is for, may not be the same.  <br/>
<br/>

&gt; Insults won&#39;t make us think more of your wisdom and<br/>
&gt; judgment.  If you thought <br/>
&gt; they would, you need to get more experience.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was not intended as an insult.  I was pointing out<br/>
an assumption of mine that classified people as the<br/>
same just because of a title they choose to wear.  I<br/>
was pointing out my fault of assuming before I knew<br/>
people.  Not everyone will have the same understanding<br/>
of how one learns and grows, that is what I meant. <br/>
The word &#39;better&#39; should have been replaced by<br/>
something like &quot;a grasp of it similar to mine, since<br/>
we are classifying ourselves similarly&quot;.  Sorry if it<br/>
insulted anyone, that was not my intent.<br/>

&gt; Experienced unschoolers would not have made the<br/>
&gt; arguments being made on <br/>
&gt; Monday.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mostly not, but that would depend somewhat on how they<br/>
defined unschooling.<br/>
And some inexperienced ones would not have made the<br/>
arguments either.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Perhaps we could all learn more from one another<br/>

&gt; it&#39;s so natural.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe that is why I feel different. It feels natural<br/>
to me now, and has for a long time, but yet I don&#39;t<br/>
feel like I know so much.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

experience were brought into it, and for me that<br/>
confused the original point.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I find lots on this list valuable.  But it is<br/>
not always going to be valuable to those people<br/>
because they may have a different ideal of what<br/>
unschooling is and they experience things differently. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Which people?  Those-people who?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I disagree because of how I see unschooling.  I see it<br/>
as a way of life that can start from birth.  It does<br/>
not really have to do with school, but with how we<br/>
live.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If anyone ever tells us &quot;We unschooled until Bubette was five, and then she <br/>
went to school.  I&#39;m so glad we unschooled her!&quot; I&#39;ll probably be nice enough <br/>
to wait until they&#39;re out of earshot to laugh.<br/>
<br/>
ALL preschoolers should be learning through games and experiences.  What&#39;s <br/>
the difference between unschooling and the way a sensitive, responsible <br/>
parent of a two-year-old who keeps her at home will act?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sure.  I am not claiming that I won&#39;t change, grow,<br/>
gain wisdom, etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People here are trying to assure you that you WILL change, grow and gain <br/>
wisdom.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But a pattern does not define EVERY person of those<br/>
ages.  There are always people who do not fit in the<br/>
patterns.  And your experience of being under thirty<br/>
could be VERY different from mine.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And our experiences when we were under thirty, no matter how similar or <br/>
different, were the experiences of twenty-year-olds.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But a pattern does not define EVERY person of those<br/>
ages.  There&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are three-legged dogs.<br/>
We don&#39;t count on them.<br/>
<br/>
(Ooh!  pun, accidently, which I&#39;ll leave. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you are judging me strictly by my age, then I<br/>
would, and feel right in saying so, that you were<br/>
pre-judging me, regardless of your experience. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not regardless of my experience.  BECAUSE of my experience.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe that is why I feel different. It feels natural<br/>
to me now, and has for a long time, but yet I don&#39;t<br/>
feel like I know so much.  .&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then perhaps you&#39;re assuming we don&#39;t know so much either.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met many of the women on this list in person.  They know a HECK of a <br/>
lot, in depth, not just about their own children, but other unschooling <br/>
families they&#39;ve been in contact with for years.  This is long range <br/>
information with depth, not snapshot-of-the-moment statistics .<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt; I WAS discounting things that were being said on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Monday, not because the <br/>
&gt; people were new, but because what they were saying<br/>
&gt; was not going to work in <br/>
&gt; the context of unschooling, and they weren&#39;t backing<br/>
&gt; off from saying it, <br/>
&gt; insultingly, in the presence of my well-behaved<br/>
&gt; guests who were already at <br/>
&gt; the party.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Okay.  That is not how I understood it because age and<br/>
experience were brought into it, and for me that<br/>
confused the original point.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Age and experience were germaine.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my back wall to be painted on.  My neighbors got graffiti.<br/>
<br/>
For many reasons I could explain, I would be more nervous if I heard Jr.High <br/>
aged boys back there whispering than if I heard a couple of older men talking <br/>
right out loud.<br/>
<br/>
Prejudice? Experience.  Certainly not baseless prejudice.  Who&#39;s more likely <br/>
to have a can of spray paint and nothing better to do?  Who&#39;s more likely to <br/>
own his own house and wall and know that spray painting someone else&#39;s is not <br/>
cool?<br/>
<br/>
The problems Monday WERE, as far as I could tell, caused by newer unschoolers <br/>
and non-unschoolers.    If I average their actions to all people &quot;to be <br/>
fair,&quot; that is NOT fair to the classes of people who weren&#39;t involved.  If I <br/>
report to the police that some boys who appeared to be 12 or 13 painted on a <br/>
wall, I could just say &quot;they were 5&#39;5&quot; and had brown hair, but why cast <br/>
suspicion on every non-blonde Caucasion in town <br/>
&quot;just to be fair&quot;?<br/>

with pre-schoolage kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ALL preschoolers should be learning through games<br/>
&gt; and experiences.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But they are not.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;What&#39;s <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know plenty, unfortunately, of people who force<br/>
their 2-5 year olds to do things.  They make them<br/>
memorize the abc song, drill them on how to tie a<br/>
shoe, &#39;teach&#39; them to write, only play games with the<br/>
hidden agenda of teaching something, buy and force<br/>
curriculum on them....and on and on.  Would you<br/>
consider that &#39;unschooling&#39; (I mean the philosophy of<br/>
child-led, natural learning)?  I don&#39;t.  That is why I<br/>
consider it a lifestyle.  With exception to hsers,<br/>
every child I know above the age of 3 is in preschool.<br/>
  Many hsers feel the need to teach their children at<br/>
young ages also.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Sure.  I am not claiming that I won&#39;t change,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is not how it came across....it was more like<br/>
saying new unschoolers or younger people are not going<br/>
to know certain things.  I agree completely that I<br/>
will do all of those things, but the point is that it<br/>
has to do with who I am, not my age, and that even as<br/>
a young, newer parent I may have something useful to<br/>
offer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; matter how similar or <br/>

 </span></blockquote>But, again, it can be very different experiences.  I<br/>
know many twenty somethings who do not have children,<br/>
who think the purpose of life is to go to a bar and<br/>
have every new thing that money can buy.  Is there<br/>
experience the same as mine, a 24 year old mother of<br/>
two, with a husband, and a desire to grow and learn?<br/>
Not even close.  Their judgment of the twenties will<br/>
be very different from mine.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Maybe that is why I feel different. It feels<br/>

&gt; Then perhaps you&#39;re assuming we don&#39;t know so much<br/>
&gt; either.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, but I am assuming you all still have something to<br/>
learn.  I assume EVERYONE does.  And if they do, why<br/>
discard something based on a persons age or<br/>
experience?  That was my thinking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

value.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Prejudice? Experience.  Certainly not baseless<br/>
&gt; prejudice.  <br/>

my beliefs.  I would never say prejudice is<br/>

in situations.  <br/>

I will just say that I agree wholeheartedly with<br/>
everything you had to say in this post.  I posted<br/>
earlier this week with similar sentiments.  I don&#39;t<br/>
believe in judging others, although I know I do. We<br/>
all do, to some extent, judge the people around us,<br/>
unconsciously and consciously.  I have always had a<br/>
very diverse pool of friends, from all ages,<br/>
backgrounds, cultures and lifestyles, and have felt<br/>
blessed to have them in my life.  I am always saddened<br/>
by people who judge me or others offhandedly because<br/>
of silly things like age.  Sad for them mostly.<br/>

<br/>
I think this goes both ways.  I cannot speak for<br/>
Katrina, but I know that when I posted on this topic<br/>
about judging others, my feeling was that YES,<br/>
experience is a good thing and one can benefit greatly<br/>
by experience freely shared from those with wisdom. <br/>
But, BUT ~ those who lack experience should not be<br/>
discounted or dismissed as being unworthy of listening<br/>
to or lacking intelligence, fresh perspective or their<br/>
own brand of wisdom.  <br/>
<br/>
I know I was not defending ANYONE in particular, and<br/>
did NOT in fact agree with a lot of the things posted<br/>
earlier this week.  I was defending the principle of<br/>
non-judgemental behavior, listening to all comers and<br/>
valuing everyone&#39;s input for what it was, finding<br/>
wisdom when it was offered without judging the source<br/>
for worthiness.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Like I said, that is something I will have to think<br/>
on.  It could be that people are using the word<br/>
judgment in different ways, causing some confusion. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Judgment is such a huge concept and issue you could think about it for a year <br/>
and STILL there would be confusion, even in you.  Because knowing the <br/>
dictionary definition and a few platitudes and toss-offs about judgmentalism <br/>
being arrogance and so forth is just noise without thought.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll never finish thinking about the ramifications of the bases of different <br/>
people&#39;s judgments.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a baby book, which is actually a whole-life book.   I used to put <br/>
things in there from time to time, and it&#39;s years between times.   I was a <br/>
plenty-verbal kid, well read, graduated from college at the age of 20, and <br/>
was working as a teacher, as I had planned since I was six, at the age of 21. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Mid-decade, I pulled out my baby book.  There was a page for me to write my <br/>
philosophy of life.  I looked at that blank page blankly, and wondered what <br/>
it would look like, &quot;a philosophy of life.&quot;   It&#39;s not that I wasn&#39;t <br/>
thoughtful, and I had even &quot;studied philosophy.&quot;  So I left it blank.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I&#39;m in my 40&#39;s, I could write for pages.<br/>
<br/>
In fact I do, almost every day.  Not in that book, but at unschooling.com, <br/>
and for Home Education Magazine, and I was asked today to write something for <br/>
the premier issue of a new local homeschooling magazine.<br/>
<br/>
But when I was 24 or 25, I didn&#39;t even know what a philosophy of life was.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I wasn&#39;t busy and doing what I thought was right and good.   <br/>
It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t have beliefs, or that I wasn&#39;t influencing other <br/>
people&#39;s lives even at that young age.  It&#39;s just that I was philosophically <br/>
immature.  And I was ahead of just about all my friends in awareness of the <br/>
bigger picture.<br/>
<br/>
Am I judging others by that?  The day I found I didn&#39;t have &quot;a philosophy of <br/>
life,&quot; I started looking around to see who else did.  There were young people <br/>
who had borrowed a persona, a pose, a look, a group, but nobody near my age <br/>
had any individual, calm understanding that I could perceive.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
stopped looking for that in people.<br/>

&gt;shoe, &#39;teach&#39; them to write, only play games with the<br/>
&gt;hidden agenda of teaching something, buy and force<br/>
&gt;curriculum on them....and on and on.  Would you<br/>
&gt;consider that &#39;unschooling&#39; (I mean the philosophy of<br/>
&gt;child-led, natural learning)?  I don&#39;t.  That is why<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;consider it a lifestyle.  With exception to hsers,<br/>
&gt;every child I know above the age of 3 is in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>preschool.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Many hsers feel the need to teach their children at<br/>
&gt;young ages also.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has been my experience too.  MOST people do not<br/>
lead a natural, game playing, child led life with<br/>
preschool kids.  Maybe it was like that many years<br/>
ago, but it is not the norm now.  Kindergarteners are<br/>
EXPECTED (there&#39;s that word again) to know certain<br/>
things when they begin school, this expected knowledge<br/>
varies by school/district.  If they don&#39;t know these<br/>
things they may be HELD BACK from first grade on the<br/>
grounds that they are not yet prepared for 1st grade. <br/>
Come to think of it, I don&#39;t think this is such a new<br/>
penomenon.  My sister was almost held back in<br/>
kindergarten for these reasons in connecticut, in<br/>
about 1960.<br/>
<br/>
My neice in 1st grade, whom I see several times a<br/>
week, had her kindergarten class last year seperated<br/>
into different groups for different reading levels. <br/>
They didn&#39;t get snacks, or have naps, and they had<br/>
homework.  This year she tells me she is the &quot;smartest<br/>
girl in her class&quot; because she is the best reader.<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;...(snip)I am assuming you all still have something<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;learn.  I assume EVERYONE does.  And if they do, why<br/>
&gt;discard something based on a persons age or<br/>
&gt;experience?  That was my thinking.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree here as well.  We all still have something to<br/>
learn, and everyone has something to teach, if we can<br/>
allow ourselves to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I would never say prejudice is justified......yet<br/>
&gt;sometimes we have to make judgments in situations.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Life often requires us to make decisions based on our<br/>
experiences, and that requires making judgements about<br/>
things and situations.  I try very hard to refrain<br/>
from including people in those judgements, or to be<br/>
generous when people are involved.  People are not<br/>
constants.  People surprise and mystify and are<br/>
endlessly capable of variation.<br/>

&gt; personality, and my goals.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s clear that Sandra&#39;s saying that wisdom is<br/>
developmental, but it is. (Well, the potential to have it is. Actually<br/>
having it probably depends on exercising the brain with thinking ;-) 20 yos<br/>
and 30 yos aren&#39;t at the level of development that a 40 yo is or a 50 yo. I<br/>
*can* tell when I&#39;m debating a 20 yo. The thinking *is* different. For<br/>
instance, it&#39;s less likely that a 20 yo than a 40 yo will grasp the concept<br/>
that stifling the speech of those we disagree with can&#39;t be done without<br/>
stifling our own freedom of speech. It isn&#39;t a matter of more experience but<br/>
brain changes that come with age, just as a 6 yo can&#39;t think the same as a<br/>
15 yo.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s doesn&#39;t mean the 40 yo is better than the 20 yo. It does mean there<br/>
are quality differences, though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It could be that people are using the word<br/>
&gt; judgment in different ways, causing some confusion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Judgemental has take on the connotation of judging the rightness or<br/>
wrongness of something before understanding or experiencing -- which is<br/>
basically not using judgement at all! It&#39;s using prejudice and limited<br/>
information to come to a conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
But to judge something is just the opposite. It means to use your experience<br/>
to come to a conclusion about something, to judge whether something is good<br/>
or bad, right or wrong, likely or not likely.<br/>

Many people seem to equate &quot;judgement&quot; as something negative. It&#39;s NOT. We&#39;re <br/>
ALL  judgemental---every day. We&#39;ve all here &quot;judged&quot; the school sysem to be <br/>
lacking---and harmful, so we won&#39;t send our children there. We&#39;ve all <br/>
&quot;judged&quot; unschooling to be an exceptional way to rear our children. <br/>
<br/>
As a &quot;judge&quot; my job is to look at things objectively and form an educated <br/>
opinion based on facts and hands-on experience. It&#39;s a GOOD thing!<br/>
<br/>
We all gain knowledge with age (well, MOST of us ;-) . Pam&#39;s daughter knows <br/>
more about dogs than most of us, and Ren knows more about living in <br/>
snow---and though I could probably give Pam&#39;s daughter a pointer or two on <br/>
dogs (bad pun), I would have to defer to Ren on all snow subjects. I could <br/>
certainly have questions for both, but I might have to object with Pam&#39;s <br/>
daughter based on more experience. Many here would be put to shame by Pam&#39;s <br/>
daughter with reference to dogs, but would challenge things Ren has to say <br/>
about driving in snow (because they live in St Paul or Toronto or whereever).<br/>
<br/>
The really cool thing about the younger posters and lurkers is that they&#39;ve <br/>
already got a clue! And not just a clue---they have a handle on it. And they <br/>
certainly have it over 98% of the country. Some of us would give our right <br/>
hands to have known this stuff earlier before we exposed our children to <br/>
school!<br/>
<br/>
What older posters are questioning is why a newbie---no matter how <br/>
&quot;unschooling-aware&quot; she is---would be posting that tv is <br/>
&quot;bad/wrong/ugly/inappropriate&quot; for a 3 yr old. Making &quot;judgements&quot; based on <br/>
years of watching our kids view and not view tv is using facts and hands-on <br/>
experience. Yes, the experts have watched children and tv too---school <br/>
children who must also do homework and get to bed early and read 100 pages a <br/>
night. School children who are also taught to do what any authority figure <br/>
says (this could make them pretty good targets for commercials, too). <br/>
<br/>
Children whose tv isn&#39;t regulated (or denied) won&#39;t watch EVERYTHING---they <br/>
become more discriminating-------------judges! Experience has shown us that.<br/>
