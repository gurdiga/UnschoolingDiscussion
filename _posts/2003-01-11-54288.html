<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026829734">My 5 1/2 year old son, who doesn&#39;t read yet and doesn&#39;t even like <br/>
being read to, sat down tonight and worked on a word search.  This <br/>
totally blew my mind.  I never imagined that a non-reader would be <br/>
able to do it.  He gave it his total concentration for quite about 15 <br/>
minutes or so, found 4 words, and then put it aside and said he would <br/>
finish it tomorrow.  <br/>

<br/>
My 5-yr-old likes to make his own word search puzzles. He&#39;ll make a list <br/>
of some words he knows (train, his name, sister&#39;s name, mommy, etc.) <br/>
down one side of the page, then an identical list on the other side, <br/>
circle the words on one side and check them off on the other.<br/>
