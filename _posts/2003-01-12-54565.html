<div id="ygrps-yiv-450781772">Hello to all!<br/>
<br/>
I am back  and it feels like coming home.<br/>
Put son back in the last month and a half of school last year.<br/>
New school, it was great. <br/>
Responsive special ed. teacher, and was open to everything I<br/>
could offer.  (this was the honeymoon)<br/>
My son went half a day, the comments were great,<br/>
so polite, eagar to learn, he was this teachers total<br/>
delight. No problem that he has learning disablitlies.<br/>
As long as he was doing well, he would start a full day<br/>
of the school year this fall. <br/>
When school started this fall: Day one, they integrated him<br/>
into the sixth grade, gave him a Para who knew nothing<br/>
about him. Totally amazed they gave him 6th grade books<br/>
and he was no where near that complex of materials, much<br/>
less able to read them.<br/>
<br/>
 The next day I called a IEP meeting, the tables<br/>
turned everyone showed up for this meeting! and I was<br/>
told how mistaken I was about him being at school for<br/>
a full day. Hmm. I told them they better look at the paperwork that <br/>
documented it all in writing.<br/>
The assit. superindendent, thought maybe in the afternoons<br/>
I could teach him the &quot;little things&quot; I had been teaching <br/>
prior. Well, now, that was HOMESCHOOLING! And I worked my hind end off!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I can see the set up now, I had the feeling he was being<br/>
set up. <br/>
He was taught sitting in the hallways on the floor, or in the library,<br/>
when the sixth grade teacher couldn&#39;t have him in there. Actually, it came <br/>
out<br/>
that he was only in the room for lunch selection.<br/>
He was removed without my knowledge from classes that he spent<br/>
with the regular 6th graders. Science, social studies etc. I was assured that<br/>
he work would be modified. They didn&#39;t do this.<br/>
The full time Para that was being paid strictly for him, was off helping<br/>
other children out of the room, in another part of the school. One day we <br/>
were<br/>
talking, and she told me she had to go and help her other student.<br/>
Found out no one helped him read the lunch selections, so instead<br/>
of the lunch he thought he wanted and was picking, he got what<br/>
he wasn&#39;t wanting for lunch. again, where was this Para?<br/>
<br/>
Enough, so I just gave all of you a confirmation of whats going on<br/>
in the public school system for a child with learning needs  for those of you <br/>
that may be entertaing the thought.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was a good break, he insisted on going back, and I needed to <br/>
re-group.<br/>
<br/>
The assist superintendent, also the homeschooling monitor, &quot;is very willing <br/>
to provide<br/>
me with the intent to homeschool papers, and shared with me that I didn&#39;t <br/>
have<br/>
to worry about my son not testing well, as she knows him and knows he doesn&#39;t<br/>
test well. She would never insist that he be returned back to public school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hey all, good to be back, sorry so long.<br/>
<br/>
Linda<br/>
