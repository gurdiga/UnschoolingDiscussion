<div id="ygrps-yiv-134423032">Hi,<br/>
My name is Rachel and I have been homeschooling for 5 years now and I <br/>
am suddenly realizing that both my kids and I really want to be <br/>
unschooling instead. I have a 10 year old son and 2 daughters 7 & 5. <br/>
This was my first year homeschooling all 3 and it just is not working <br/>
the way I thought it would.  I finally pulled my Unschooling handbook <br/>
off the shelf one day and read the whole thing cover to cover... This <br/>
is the way I should be schooling.  I talked to my kids and they were <br/>
totally in love with the concept. I am so tired of feeling like we <br/>
are behind on learning and &quot;schoolwork&quot; that I could just scream.  <br/>
The days we just &quot;took off&quot; and did what we all wanted was so much <br/>
nicer and calmer... Why haven&#39;t I tried this before now? I am so <br/>
looking forward to reading all of the posts on this list and getting <br/>
to know everyone. In my community it is so lonely being a <br/>
homeschooler let alone an unschooler that it is very hard sometimes.  <br/>
I live in a small rural community in Alaska. You would think more <br/>
people would like to get together since I know there are lots of <br/>
home/unschoolers around they just don&#39;t want to for some reason. My <br/>
kids don&#39;t get along with the public schooled kids in the <br/>
neighborhood because of the diffence in interests and personalities <br/>
that they feel very lonely too. So I am hoping that if I can at least <br/>
bounce ideas off of some of you and likewise we will all feel better. <br/>
Thanks!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935028770">Hi Rachel,<br/>
<br/>
My older dd is also named Rachel.  Mine are much older than yours 17, <br/>
14 and 10.  But we went through the no one to play with thing too.  My <br/>
girls have a few friends - - 2 that they see often and a 3 or 4 more <br/>
that they only see occassionally.  Mine just don&#39;t get along well with <br/>
others their own ages.  They are just different.  They are however, <br/>
perfectly happy with the situation.  I hope yours are too.  If they <br/>
are, don&#39;t worry about it.  If the loneliness is a big issue, take <br/>
them lots of places and let them meet lots of different kinds of <br/>
people.  That helped mine a lot in the beginning.  They saw that it <br/>
was okay to be defferent and then they stopped worrying about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480260032">Hi Rachel, my name is Bonni and I have benefitted enormously from this<br/>
group.  I have four kids aged 7g,9b,11b,14b.  We are really enjoying<br/>
unschooling, and try to do things socially like church, skateboarding,<br/>
sports, visiting  public school friends or visiting kid centers between<br/>
3:00 and 5:30 and hanging out at the mall for social activities.  I guess<br/>
it&#39;s different in rural Alaska.  My kids are all very outgoing like their<br/>
dad, not like me.  <br/>
---My kids don&#39;t get along with the public schooled kids in the<br/>
neighborhood because of the difference in interests and personalities <br/>
that they feel very lonely too.--- <br/>
I don&#39;t think it is just a homeschooling thing, since I used to attend ps<br/>
and I didn&#39;t fit in or feel at home with the way everyone behaved or<br/>
thought, especially the way they treated each other.  I hung out a lot in<br/>
nature, by the river, on a mountain all by my lonesome with a dog or<br/>
horse.  I lived in rural Oregon.  I then moved to big-city Fort<br/>
Lauderdale, Florida when I was twelve.  Talk about culture shock.  I<br/>
would climb trees and swim far out into the ocean and hang out reading at<br/>
the library to escape.  In middle school, I started being more sociable<br/>
and to find other kindred spirits.  Well, loneliness is hard.  I tell my<br/>
kids, &quot;Boredom is the soil in which imagination grows.&quot;  It is too true. <br/>
What I&#39;m trying to say is, loneliness is part of the human experience,<br/>
and the fact that your children don&#39;t relate to the ps kids interests and<br/>
personalities is a sign of their awareness of who they are.  It&#39;s not<br/>
necessarily a &quot;bad&quot; thing, like ps teachers always make it out to be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750391357">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the group and struggling with an unschooling dilemma.  Besides the ongoing dilemma of unschooling my kids amongst peers and family, this issue is about how to handle my current situation.<br/>
<br/>
Recently my husband was diagnosed with cancer.  He is doing well through his treatment, but he was the breadwinner in the family.  As a teacher himself, he struggled to understand how unschooling our kids worked so much better for them and our family.  Both kids have tried a few weeks of traditional school, but failed miserably to fit into the &quot;box.&quot;  The teachers failed to see the value of how bright my children are because everyone is so worried about their teaching jobs and test scores.<br/>
<br/>
I may have to return full time to work or create a job that brings in enough to support us all.  Knowing that the kids cannot succeed in an atmosphere that is so stifling (emotional breakdowns,labels, bullying, etc), what can I do to make this all work.  I know I&#39;m not the only momma out there who struggles to make this all work.  <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t help that people look upon me like, &quot;I told you so.  Your kids will never survive in the world if you unschool them.&quot;  Yet, I feel like they survive well in the world, just not in the educational system world.  <br/>
<br/>
Hence, my dilemma of what to do. Do I let go of unschooling and prepare them with standardized school curriculum (with total resistance on both our sides)? Or do I continue to just trust that everything will work out if they have to go to traditional schools?<br/>
<br/>
I just need advice, opinions, experiences, etc to help me reflect on this.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Those aren&#39;t the only two choices.<br/>
And I hope you&#39;re not &quot;just trusting&quot; anything, but that you&#39;re making conscious decisions toward their learning and their happiness!<br/>
<br/>
Any child might end up in a traditional school.  It could happen. Even if the parents have chosen another unschooling family to care for the child, something could happen to all those parents.  No reason to become agitated about that.<br/>
<br/>
Learning doesn&#39;t have to happen during &quot;school hours.&quot;  Even if you work full time, the kids can be spending time with you outside of those hours, with you available to provide stimulating activities and conversations, and answer their questions.   Can your husband just hang out with them, take care of them, while you&#39;re at work?  If so, I think unschooling can continue.   <br/>
<br/>
But if putting them in school is what you decide to do, this might help some:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106264194">I am sorry that you are in a difficult situation but remember the way you handle this is an opportunity to teach your children.  We have unschooled our 4 kids, my youngest is now 16 and she is now going to the Community College and studying Mechanical Engineering. All of my kids are at University as Engineering Majors and no we are not Engineers ourselves this is just the field they all liked.  Will your husband be able to help your children as needed?  Will he be home most of the time that they are home?  Do you have supportive friends or family nearby?  How old is the oldest child, can he/she babysit?  Will you be working close enough to drive home at lunch?  There is always a way to make it happen if you really want to.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have spent way too much time playing games on the computer and talking to internet friends both of which they would not do if we were regular schoolers.  Because of this they are very good at computers and have gotten part time jobs as web designers, etc.  They have not learned many traditional things but most schoolers have not learned what they have taught themselves.  Do not worry about grades, mine never had a grade until college and get all A&#39;s and B&#39;s.  Trust yourself and your kids you know them better than anyone, talk with them about this and ask them for ideas you may be surprised what they come up with.<br/>

Good luck.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think a traumatic illness is an opportunity to teach your children. Â It might be an opportunity to become closer as a family, or renew priorities, or shift priorities, or change directions entirely. Â In situations that involve a great deal of stress, the best way to look at it, is in each different choice that comes up, choose the one that creates more peace and less stress and sometimes that might be putting the kids in school, even if temporarily. Â If kids are totally opposed to going to school, then by all means don&#39;t add that, it will create more stress not less.<br/>

Six months ago we had to run from our house as it burned to the ground during the Caughlin Wilfire in Reno.  We lost everything we have ever owned, 2 cars, and 7 pets.  I think the way we pulled through that taught our kids a lot.  I am not saying that is anything like what you are going through and I think how ever you get through it is the best thing you can do.

<br/>
The objection, I think, was to the idea that *anything* would be used as &quot;a way to teach&quot; a child anything.<br/>
<br/>
Children learned from the way you pulled through after a fire.<br/>
Children learn lessons from life.<br/>
<br/>
As long as a parent clings to the idea of &quot;teaching lessons,&quot; even if it&#39;s a defense of life teaching lessons, unschooling will elude them.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about learning, and not about teaching.<br/>

<br/>
But it helps people think more clearly about unschooling to see the difference between teaching and learning.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching is about getting a specific understanding -- a specific change -- into someone&#39;s head.<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s no guarantee that what gets pushed will go in. Or that something entirely different won&#39;t get pulled in. If that specific something isn&#39;t pulled in, no teaching has taken place.<br/>
<br/>
Learning is about pulling what the learner finds meaningful in. And inside a new understanding grows.<br/>
<br/>
But not matter how a teacher prepares the environment, the teacher can&#39;t control what gets pulled in or how it will change someone.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching is pushing. Learning is pulling.<br/>
<br/>
While life will &quot;push&quot; some events on us that we don&#39;t choose. While that push will change each person. But life isn&#39;t attempting to change someone in any particular way. Life isn&#39;t really trying to do anything ;-) It just throws stuff at us.<br/>
<br/>
Some people will be crushed by an event. Some people will become stronger. Some people will develop coping strategies that range from great to poor. Since what they learn won&#39;t be the same, no teaching can be say <br/>
<br/>
The clearest generalization that can be made is life dumped a challenge on them and it changed them in some way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think the way we pulled through that taught our kids a lot.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s clearer to say the way you pulled through allowed them to see some coping tools in action. How the loss effected each person would mean that some found some tools more useful, and others found other tools more useful.<br/>
<br/>
What they pulled in, what they found meaningful, how it changed them, wasn&#39;t in your control. <br/>
<br/>
Life presented a big change. You used various tools to cope. The each were changed by life and by how you coped.<br/>

&gt;But there&#39;s no guarantee that what gets pushed will go in. Or that something entirely different won&#39;t get pulled in. If that specific something isn&#39;t pulled in, no teaching has taken place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Learning is about pulling what the learner finds meaningful in. And inside a new understanding grows.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But not matter how a teacher prepares the environment, the teacher can&#39;t control what gets pulled in or how it will change someone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Teaching is pushing. Learning is pulling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While life will &quot;push&quot; some events on us that we don&#39;t choose. While that push will change each person. But life isn&#39;t attempting to change someone in any particular way. Life isn&#39;t really trying to do anything ;-) It just throws stuff at us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Some people will be crushed by an event. Some people will become stronger. Some people will develop coping strategies that range from great to poor. Since what they learn won&#39;t be the same, no teaching can be say <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The clearest generalization that can be made is life dumped a challenge on them and it changed them in some way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I think the way we pulled through that taught our kids a lot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s clearer to say the way you pulled through allowed them to see some coping tools in action. How the loss effected each person would mean that some found some tools more useful, and others found other tools more useful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What they pulled in, what they found meaningful, how it changed them, wasn&#39;t in your control. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Life presented a big change. You used various tools to cope. The each were changed by life and by how you coped.<br/>

The difference between learning and teaching isn&#39;t &quot;correcting speech.&quot;  It&#39;s discussion of what makes unschooling work better.<br/>
<br/>
It matters.<br/>
