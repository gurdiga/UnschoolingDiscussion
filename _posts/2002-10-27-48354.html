<br/>
A Covenant for Sustaining Children  / by Raffi<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We find these joys to be self-evident:<br/>
<br/>
That all  children are created whole, endowed with innate<br/>
<br/>
intelligence, with dignity and wonder, worthy of respect.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The embodiment of life, liberty and happiness,<br/>
<br/>
Children are original blessings,<br/>
<br/>
Here to learn their own song.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Every girl and boy is entitiled<br/>
<br/>
To love, to dream and belong to a loving &quot;village.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And to pursue a life of purpose.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We affirm our duty to nourish and nurture the young,<br/>
<br/>
To honor their caring ideals and the heart of being human.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To recognize the early years as the foundation of life,<br/>
<br/>
and to cherish the contribution of young children to human evolution.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We commit ourselves to peaceful ways<br/>
<br/>
And vow to keep from harm or neglect<br/>
<br/>
These, our most vulnerable citizens.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As guardians of their prosperity<br/>
<br/>
We honor the bountiful Earth whose diversity sustains us.<br/>
