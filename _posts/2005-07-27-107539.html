Why I&#39;m Not An Unschooler<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I joined the growing home education movement I was astounded to<br/>
discover there was a large and growing subset who called themselves<br/>
unschoolers. &quot;Unschoolers???!!!&quot; I exclaimed in disbelief, &quot;What kind of<br/>
awful, neglectful parent would be an unschooler?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After a few months of research into the subject, however, I came to the<br/>
unbelievable realization that we actually are unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
With an additional couple of months of reading and discussion under my <br/>
belt,<br/>
I came to the firm conclusion that we are nothing at all like most<br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Further study, however, revealed that we are pretty close to being<br/>
unschoolers on Tuesdays and Thursdays, that any parent who doesn&quot;t <br/>
&quot;whoop&quot;<br/>
their kids is an unschooler, that everyone who doesn&quot;t use <br/>
school-in-a-box<br/>
is an unschooler, that only three people on earth are pure unschoolers, <br/>
and<br/>
that only people who eat granola and sleep in a family bed and don&quot;t <br/>
believe<br/>
in razors are unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
*Unschooling Undefined<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&quot;t flip-flopping in my philosophy, I was hearing a new <br/>
&quot;definition&quot;<br/>
for unschooling every week. On its face, the term only defines in the<br/>
negative, telling you what it is not, rather than what it is. Most <br/>
people in<br/>
the educational mainstreamÑoutside of the home education movementÑhave <br/>
never<br/>
heard of it. And those inside the home education movement use the term <br/>
in so<br/>
many different ways as to make the term nearly noncommunicative.<br/>
<br/>
Even a great deal of research did not clarify the issue. Nowhere could I<br/>
find even a broad definition that was generally accepted. I was sure <br/>
that<br/>
all I needed to do was to get some information &quot;from the horse&quot;s <br/>
mouth,&quot; so<br/>
to speak. So I finally approached dozens of self-proclaimed unschoolers <br/>
in<br/>
various different forums and asked them to define unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The responses actually quite surprised me. By far the most common <br/>
initial<br/>
response I received was, &quot;Unschooling does not have a definition and I <br/>
see<br/>
no need to define it for anyone else!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My follow-up question was, &quot;If unschooling has no meaningful <br/>
definition, why<br/>
do you label yourself as such?&quot; While this did not illicit a rush of <br/>
warm<br/>
embraces, most people realized that I was not attacking their ideology, <br/>
but<br/>
simply asking for some philosophical analysis. At that point, a very<br/>
informative discussion ensued.<br/>
<br/>
Two semi-definitions of unschooling resulted from these discussions<br/>
(although every person I spoke with insisted that it could not be <br/>
succinctly<br/>
defined). These were the most common answers that could garner any kind <br/>
of<br/>
support. An unschooler is someone who:<br/>
<br/>
Leans toward unstructured learning<br/>
<br/>
and/or<br/>
<br/>
Leans toward child-led learning<br/>
<br/>
*Unstructured<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Children should not sit still after hour after, being spoonfed <br/>
everything<br/>
they need to know from some rigid, generic curriculum.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Many homeschoolers have realized that too much &quot;schooly&quot; structure is <br/>
not<br/>
beneficial and is actually deleterious to learning. This freeing<br/>
realization, however, has led some to discard all structure, whether<br/>
beneficial or not.<br/>
<br/>
This confuses two separate issues. One being the rigid structure of the<br/>
environment (such as the restrictive discipline that is typically <br/>
needed to<br/>
maintain order in a classroom with one teacher and 30 students), and the<br/>
other being the structure of the material being learned.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the subject at hand and the stage of learning the child has<br/>
progressed to, structured learning may well be the most effective way to<br/>
master a given material.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We prefer natural learning, just letting life happens as it happens.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This standard may well ignore the fact that some learning requires<br/>
organization. Some subjects do not offer enough information/feedback to <br/>
be<br/>
learned effectively if only studied as infrequently and haphazardly as <br/>
they<br/>
may be encountered in day to day activity.<br/>
<br/>
Learning any topic thoroughly and effectively, requires a healthy<br/>
combination of both structure and free exploration. To disavow <br/>
structure as<br/>
being bad in and of itself may result, under the best circumstances, in <br/>
the<br/>
child wasting time and energy and, in the worst, in the child becoming<br/>
sufficiently frustrated and discouraged in the learning process that he<br/>
loses interest.<br/>
<br/>
*Undirected<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Children won&quot;t learn anything they are forced to do, they only truly <br/>
learn<br/>
if they want to learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This provocative assumption argues that learning only occurs if <br/>
children are<br/>
completely in charge of subject matter and timetable. But the logic is<br/>
fundamentally flawed. In fact, all the unschoolers I know except three<br/>
unwittingly disprove this theory by their practice.<br/>
<br/>
Many will ascribe dire consequences to any subject being coerced, <br/>
forced, or<br/>
required of children. These same parents, however, still have skills or<br/>
behaviors that they consider &quot;non-optional.&quot; These generally have to do <br/>
with<br/>
health and safety and family lifestyle. For example, these parents <br/>
require<br/>
their children to: brush their teeth, stay out of the road, help with<br/>
chores, etc.<br/>
<br/>
These parents don&quot;t take the position that requiring a child to brush <br/>
his<br/>
teeth will make him hate tooth brushing so much that he will never brush<br/>
again once the parent&quot;s influence is diminished. But they do claim that<br/>
requiring math study will create math-haters and math-phobics who will <br/>
avoid<br/>
computation for the rest of their lives. They don&quot;t seem to recognize <br/>
this<br/>
inconsistency.<br/>
<br/>
If entirely child-led learning is truly a sound educational foundation, <br/>
it<br/>
would not be limited so arbitrarily to subjects somehow labeled <br/>
&quot;academic&quot;<br/>
as opposed to &quot;real-life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Children won&quot;t learn from the mistakes of others, they have to learn <br/>
for<br/>
themselves.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This speaks more of a lack of trust in the family relationships than it <br/>
does<br/>
of educational philosophy. It also flies in the face of historical <br/>
reality;<br/>
learning from others is the way man has progressed from tribalism and<br/>
barbarism to various levels of civilized endeavor. If every person <br/>
truly had<br/>
to learn everything on their own, no one would have been able to build <br/>
on<br/>
and surpass the accomplishments of prior generations.<br/>
<br/>
To my husband, a scientist, this is a most basic concept. He could not <br/>
make<br/>
the progress he has made in fuzzy logic research if he were not able, <br/>
and<br/>
willing, to stand on the shoulders of those who laid the foundationÑto <br/>
learn<br/>
 from their success and failure paths. If he did not examine their work <br/>
and<br/>
mistakes and experience, trust in their validity, and learn from them, <br/>
he<br/>
would have to reinvent the wheel. He would be forced to learn <br/>
everything on<br/>
his own, and simply wouldn&quot;t have enough hours in the day to make a <br/>
useful<br/>
contribution.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can&quot;t possibly know what my child will want to be or to do when they <br/>
grow<br/>
up, so I would never presume to tell them what they need to know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This statement implies that since a parent cannot make perfect, specific<br/>
predictions, that he also cannot make very good, general predictions. <br/>
This<br/>
is completely inaccurate.<br/>
<br/>
While I may not always be able to guess exactly how many ounces of <br/>
water any<br/>
of my daughters will drink on a given day, I can tell you that each of <br/>
them<br/>
will drink at least some water on that day with nearly 100% accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
The same principle holds true for most academic work. While I can&quot;t <br/>
predict<br/>
exactly how many math problems in a particular text would be of optimum<br/>
benefit to my children, I can say that for most people in our society an<br/>
understanding of math through the second year of algebra would be <br/>
extremely<br/>
beneficial given the cost (time, energy, expense) of learning. I can <br/>
also<br/>
say that if our society continues to progress technologically, math <br/>
through<br/>
calculus will be likely to be helpful to most people in the future.<br/>
<br/>
To make these generalizations a parent does not need to second-guess a<br/>
child&quot;s vocation nor require her to specialize.<br/>
<br/>
There is another underlying implication in this statement: that because<br/>
parents do not have the ability to make perfect decisions, they should <br/>
make<br/>
none at all. It says that since we can&quot;t know exactly how much history <br/>
will<br/>
fit in perfectly with their future career and/or life choices, we have <br/>
no<br/>
right to say that they need to know any history at all.<br/>
<br/>
Not only does this ignore the fact that parents have more experience and<br/>
hopefully more wisdom to draw upon than their children, but it also <br/>
ignores<br/>
the fact that every decision we make is subject to our imperfections. In<br/>
spite of this, most of us do not feel immobilized.<br/>
<br/>
Often, as before, the parents making these claims, themselves show the <br/>
lack<br/>
consistency in this argument. They cannot perfectly determine precisely <br/>
how<br/>
much and what manner of toothbrushing will be most beneficial to each <br/>
child.<br/>
Still they feel justified in compelling their children to brush. Why?<br/>
Because they feel that the cost (time, energy, expense) of brushing is<br/>
outweighed by the benefit, and they feel qualified to make a good <br/>
general<br/>
estimate of how much brushing is required to reach an acceptable <br/>
benefit.<br/>
<br/>
Once again the most effective type of learning is a combination of<br/>
well-thought out guidance in conjunction with personal initiative.<br/>
<br/>
*The Good Stuff<br/>
<br/>
We are not unschoolers. The label has so many varied definitions and <br/>
they<br/>
are often inconsistent with our ideology.<br/>
<br/>
Still I have learned a great deal from the unschoolers I know. I&quot;ve <br/>
learned:<br/>
to find education most anywhere; to ignore practices and methods that <br/>
don&quot;t<br/>
serve us; to watch and listen to my children with my heart.<br/>

stop, reverse that...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I suppose one would have to lean somewhat in order to *embrace* <br/>
someone or something... But, &quot;leaning toward unstructured learning&quot; <br/>
or whatever is kind of like &quot;leaning toward being vegetarian&quot; - you <br/>
may agree in principle/philosophy, you do it sometimes (maybe most <br/>
of the time even), but over all, you still like a good steak now and <br/>
again in practice.<br/>

great (as Sandra&#39;s recent posts on Marty&#39;s foray into college <br/>
classes - it was Marty, not Kirby, correct?)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Such as? Yes, letting a person twingle with the piano at will on and <br/>
off is less effective for learning a Beethoven sonata BUT it is <br/>
still not taking into account the purposes of the *learner*. When I <br/>
wanted to learn to play piano, it was with a specific purpose in <br/>
mind - I wanted to play a few favorite old hymns to at least a <br/>
recognizable, if not fluid, level. I played A LOT over and over for <br/>
a while. Then I stopped. Then I started. Then I stopped and started <br/>
a few more times. Not a paragon of structured, organized learning <br/>
(and I was doing it without a teacher, just a beginner&#39;s book that I <br/>
skipped around in at will, on my own time frame). I can pick out <br/>
those hymns plus figure out a bunch of others. I reached my goal. <br/>
Perhaps not as quickly and efficiently, but I still enjoy it and <br/>
*own* it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Example? I&#39;ve got a child. When he wants to learn something, we do <br/>
whatever seems to work best. Numeracy is growing rapidly without any <br/>
formal structure or set outline of steps. Reading was absorbed as <br/>
best as I can figure - sure wasn&#39;t formal anything involved. <br/>
Basically, he absorbed until he outright said he wanted to learn to <br/>
read. In 3 evenings (total maybe 90 minutes at bedtime) we went <br/>
through a small set of &#39;primer&#39; type books designed to &#39;teach&#39; <br/>
reading (Bob Books). That 90 minutes basically convinced DS that he <br/>
could read, was in fact already reading and we moved on from there. <br/>
Other stuff (all those other &#39;subjects&#39; like geography and science <br/>
and history) are indeed easily absorbed piece by piece, making new <br/>
connections and adding to existing connections as we go - that&#39;s <br/>
what adults are doing all day long, if they haven&#39;t decide they <br/>
don&#39;t need to learn anything anymore.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, learning does occur even when forced - but rarely is the <br/>
learning involved related to the subject matter for the long term. <br/>
The &#39;data&#39; can be absorbed short term and may &#39;stick&#39; longer term if <br/>
it is repeated enough over a long time. But, what sticks first and <br/>
quickly is learning that learning is hard/boring/whatever and that <br/>
the child is &quot;bright/slow/average/good-at-math/gifted/disabled&quot; and <br/>
many other things. Learning that what you are good at defines you, <br/>
rather than Who you are and where your passions take you.<br/>

unschooling as an &#39;educational method&#39; and those who consider it a <br/>
lifestyle.<br/>

&gt; this<br/>
&gt; inconsistency.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, we do indeed see that inconsistency - which is why forced <br/>
anything is avoided. Discussion and information and modelling (and a <br/>
good look at the ugly fillings in my head) are all it needs for DS <br/>
to be the most mindful regarding dental hygiene (since this is the <br/>
example used). Guess this person hasn&#39;t actually talked to any of <br/>
us &quot;radicals&quot; huh? ;-)<br/>

foundation and should not be limited to just &#39;academics&#39; but to all <br/>
of life.<br/>

&gt;than it <br/>
&gt; does<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For some people this is true - they do NOT want to take it from <br/>
someone else, they need to experience things on their own - EVEN IF <br/>
they are in a loving, trusting family relationship. BUT, with a <br/>
loving, trusting relationship built, when things go awry, they are <br/>
safe to come back and explore it freely without condemnation. And, <br/>
over time, are more likely to heed concerns voiced by those loving, <br/>
trusted voices.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Learning from others and learning in a strictly formal way <br/>
(especially via print as most &#39;formal learning&#39; is done) are two <br/>
different things. I learn from my DH. He learns from me. Neither of <br/>
us are doing anything structured or formal. DS learns from us as <br/>
well - but not because we are sitting him down and requiring it of <br/>
him - he hears, sees, participates, explores, asks, answers; we do, <br/>
assist, answer, ask (real questions, seeking his ideas). It may <br/>
involve books. It may involve sitting in the back yard for several <br/>
hours looking at clouds. Children learn to walk and talk from others <br/>
yet few (barring physiological/physical/mental issues) would say <br/>
they &quot;taught&quot; their child to walk or talk. Learning happened. And <br/>
they learned from others. Yet there wasn&#39;t explicit teaching <br/>
involved - assisting, facilitating, encouraging, modelling in spades <br/>
but there&#39;s no &quot;time to do our walking practice now&quot; involved.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

&gt; predictions, that he also cannot make very good, general <br/>
&gt;predictions. <br/>
&gt; This<br/>
&gt; is completely inaccurate.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um, misunderstanding here. We don&#39;t need to *tell* them what they <br/>
need to know because the general stuff is general, basic, and they <br/>
know they need it and they learn it because it is basic, necessary, <br/>
stuff. Like walking and talking - there is a purpose to it. I could <br/>
make a pretty good general prediction that DS would need to be able <br/>
to walk. And sure enough he did. I didn&#39;t tell him that. Knowing <br/>
that, I didn&#39;t arrange lessons for him. I did, however, make a tot-<br/>
friendly environment available. I comforted him when he bumped hard <br/>
into something. I held his hands as he stepped or walked carefully <br/>
and slowly when he was attached to the backs of my legs (one of his <br/>
favorite &quot;push toys&quot;). Likewise, letters and sounds are all around <br/>
(hey I rhymed). DS knew they communicated something and with <br/>
exploration and asking and playing with the symbols and the sounds, <br/>
he was eventually reading. <br/>
<br/>

&gt; them<br/>
&gt; will drink at least some water on that day with nearly 100% <br/>
&gt;accuracy.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really? And never a day goes by when they only drink milk and juice <br/>
and soup of their own choice (removing, if possible, any <br/>
requirement, subtle or otherwise, of yours)? I *know* that there are <br/>
some days when DS drinks lots of milk and juice and no water <br/>
(barring, perhaps, a bit that gets swallowed in the rinse/spit of <br/>
brushing). In the warm months, odds are good that he&#39;ll drink lots <br/>
of water. In the winter, probably not as much and sometimes no H2O <br/>
directly.<br/>
<br/>

ZERO - and I&#39;m in a high tech industry. Odds are actually LOWER <br/>
because of technology, not higher - pocket calculators nowadays can <br/>
do all those calculations if you know the basic inputs (the fence is <br/>
this long and this wide ...). Also, *formal* calculus and algebra <br/>
are different than the concepts they are used to convey (ask your <br/>
scientist husband about how the notation for his equations is merely <br/>
representing a concept in symbolic language). My DS was using basic <br/>
algebra at age 3 - yup 3 yrs of age. He solved the following <br/>
equation 3+x=7 (basic algebra right - solving for x is one of the <br/>
first lessons). He had 3 cookies and wanted 7 so he figured out how <br/>
many more he needed to get what he wanted. He didn&#39;t write it down. <br/>
He didn&#39;t know it was algebra, let alone math or arithmetic. It was <br/>
just information he needed to get what he wanted. And he used his <br/>
fingers to calculate it.<br/>

&gt; none at all. It says that since we can&quot;t know exactly how much <br/>
&gt;history <br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; fit in perfectly with their future career and/or life choices, we <br/>
&gt;have <br/>
&gt; no<br/>
&gt; right to say that they need to know any history at all.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, it is making a decision quite firmly that says I will <br/>
assist my child in learning any and all history that my child <br/>
chooses to pursue - whether or not it has any relationship to any <br/>
future career or life choices. We spent a lovely, silly time, <br/>
playing with Shakespearean language one evening last winter (DS was <br/>
6). He doesn&#39;t &quot;know&quot; Shakespeare but he does have connections <br/>
for &quot;Shakespeare&quot; &quot;Hamlet&quot; &quot;To be or not to be that is the question&quot; <br/>
(the silly arose when DH said he had to use the bathroom as soon as <br/>
we got in - we were pulling into the driveway - I said To pee or not <br/>
to pee that is the question whether it is nobler to pee thy pants or <br/>
suffer the slings and arrows of holding it...) He picked up the <br/>
accent of the &#39;classical Shakespearean English&#39; and we tossed bits <br/>
and pieces of Shakespeare back and forth and made up stuff that <br/>
sounded good. DS may never *need* to know any of it, but if he runs <br/>
across a reference to it, he&#39;ll have something to attach it to.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Not only does this ignore the fact that parents have more <br/>
&gt;experience and<br/>
&gt; hopefully more wisdom to draw upon than their children, but it <br/>
&gt;also <br/>
&gt; ignores<br/>
&gt; the fact that every decision we make is subject to our <br/>
&gt;imperfections. In<br/>
&gt; spite of this, most of us do not feel immobilized.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If keeping up with DS is immobilized I&#39;d hate to be mobile! phew <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Often, as before, the parents making these claims, themselves show <br/>
&gt;the <br/>
&gt; lack<br/>
&gt; consistency in this argument. They cannot perfectly determine <br/>
&gt;precisely <br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; much and what manner of toothbrushing will be most beneficial to <br/>
&gt;each <br/>
&gt; child.<br/>
&gt; Still they feel justified in compelling their children to brush. <br/>
&gt;Why?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Uh go back up and read the other section on required toothbrushing <br/>
et al<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Because they feel that the cost (time, energy, expense) of <br/>
&gt;brushing is<br/>
&gt; outweighed by the benefit, and they feel qualified to make a good <br/>
&gt; general<br/>
&gt; estimate of how much brushing is required to reach an acceptable <br/>
&gt; benefit.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s no guesswork needed - the ADA has guidelines on how much and <br/>
how often one needs to brush (I think it is currently something like <br/>
two minutes of brushing at least twice per day).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Once again the most effective type of learning is a combination of<br/>
&gt; well-thought out guidance in conjunction with personal initiative.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, exactly - but the guidance needs to be in the form of trail <br/>
guide - the trail guide doesn&#39;t decide the goal, but rather takes <br/>
the goal of the guide-ee (is that a word?) as well as other <br/>
abilities, interests, etc (expressed or otherwise) into account and <br/>
provides information for the guide-ee to make decisions on which <br/>
path to take, how far to go, etc. The &#39;guidance&#39; is not &quot;You have to <br/>
learn algebra by the time you are 18&quot; but rather &quot;You&#39;re interested <br/>
in... let&#39;s see what kinds of stuff would be useful... hmm looks <br/>
like algebra is important for ... here are a few ways to learn that. <br/>
This looks interesting. What do you think?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to watch and listen to my children with my heart.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Gee if you spend all your time watching and listening to your <br/>
children with all your heart, how do you have time to require stuff <br/>
of them - wouldn&#39;t that be ignoring their hearts and ignoring what <br/>
you are hearing?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-739964190"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yes, and if the *learner* chooses to use a structured method, that&#39;s<br/>

&gt; classes - it was Marty, not Kirby, correct?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
Right.   Nobody was twisting his arm.   I was prepared to twist his arm to <br/>
quit that evil English 101 class, but he didn&#39;t need to have his arm twisted.   <br/>
He knew when to willingly take a structured class and when to bail out like <br/>
his book was on fire.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&gt; This standard may well ignore the fact that some learning requires<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; organization. Some subjects do not offer enough<br/>
&gt;information/feedback to<br/>

&gt; they<br/>
&gt; may be encountered in day to day activity.-=-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As I read that it sounded breathlessly thoughtless, like someone had all in <br/>
one great burst of writing packed in all the kneejerk nonsense she possibly <br/>
could, with the employment of a plethora of   multisyllabic obfuscatory verbiage. <br/>
  I was impressed in the negative numbers.   The success of that writing was <br/>
quite deferred.    <br/>
<br/>

&gt; being bad in and of itself may result, under the best<br/>
&gt;circumstances, in<br/>

&gt;becoming<br/>
&gt; sufficiently frustrated and discouraged in the learning process<br/>
&gt;that he<br/>
&gt; loses interest.-=-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To avow that structure is in and of itself to result in good might suggest <br/>
that sufficient engagement in strucutured study of English composition might <br/>
result in writing such as one would have read in the paragraph prior to this <br/>
which was painful on the surface and unintentionally humorous at its core.<br/>
It was fluffed-up bullshit.<br/>

Non-optional (but easily obtained skill at our house is the recognition of <br/>
nonsense.<br/>
That wasn&#39;t taught in the school the writer above attended, it seems, or <br/>
maybe it can&#39;t BE taught.   <br/>

I bet she&#39;s talking about people voluntarily submitting themselves to the <br/>
instruction of others.<br/>

<br/>
I KNEW my kids would need to be comfortable with computers, so I let them <br/>
play with them all they wanted from the time they could work the mouse.   I <br/>
didn&#39;t measure their useage and when they got older we got other computers (we <br/>
helped them get their own used computers; got an extra used one for Holly to use). <br/>
  Maybe they&#39;ll never use computers in their jobs (maybe not;   probably <br/>
will), but they already use them for real in their lives, and will for the rest of <br/>
their days.<br/>

ZERO - and I&#39;m in a high tech industry-=-<br/>
<br/>
Right.   Deb had it and isn&#39;t using it.   Hours in class, homework, tests, <br/>
grades, cost of tuition...<br/>
I have not a day of calculus ever, but I know Keith uses it in his head at <br/>
work and away from work, but he thinks in patterns and I think in words.    <br/>
Never a day of calculus or trigonometry; dropped out of Algebra II in 10th grade, <br/>
but had a college degree before I was 21.    My ass is kissable.   New Mexico <br/>
being a community property state, Keith&#39;s math is my math. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

Yes, and my kids have had to keep up with me!!!<br/>
&quot;Immobilized&quot;!??   I have to be really very ill or wounded to be even <br/>
temporarily immobilized.<br/>
