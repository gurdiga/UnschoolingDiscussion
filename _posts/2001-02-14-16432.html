<div id="ygrps-yiv-750351771">&lt;&lt;teaching them how to apply thier own temp tatoos letting them draw tatoos<br/>
 on me with henna pens...staying up late, what have you.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Where do you get these pens?  I love those henna tattoos and have wanted to <br/>
try it myself.  I think they are so pretty.  I&#39;m not really into doing any <br/>
&quot;traditional&quot; patterns, just whatever I think is attractive.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Other than being clean and modest I don&#39;t understand how dressing to conform <br/>
is a good example.  I love to see someone dressed uniquely, it tells me <br/>
something about their personality.  I just dress like a frump and wear <br/>
clothes till they wear out cuz I don&#39;t give a fig about fashion.  I&#39;d rather <br/>
spend the money on LOTS of other things.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m either going to have to do a drastic dye job (maybe just blackest<br/>
 black possible..it&#39;s been awhile since that one) or chop it off again.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I let my 10 yod cut my hair this last time and it looks great from the front. <br/>
 LOL  Seeing the back gives my friends a good chuckle.  If I didn&#39;t think the <br/>
stares would annoy me I would just shave it all off.  I do want to dye it <br/>
some bright color though, I&#39;ve heard that Kool-Aid is good for that, have you <br/>
tried it?<br/>

I&#39;ve gotten mine at Buffalo Exchange here in Alb.<br/>
don&#39;t know where you are, though, so that probably<br/>
don&#39;t help. :( sorry.<br/>
Oh! Spencer&#39;s gifts has a cool little kit you can<br/>
get... and all the little trendy -bleh- stores in the<br/>
mall targeting the teeny bopper crowds have some<br/>
version of them. Yay! I can remember some things! I<br/>
can almost function still!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m with you there. ...in that spending money on other<br/>
things part I mean...maybe it&#39;s cuz I&#39;m a cheapskate<br/>
and no other reason, who knows. Savers and Goodwill<br/>
are my main stays in clothing supply....thrift stores<br/>
are blissful places.... And I for one really don&#39;t<br/>
care if something looks worn out or faded, etc... I<br/>
kind of like it actually. It feels....comfy... lived<br/>
in, etc... My younger sis on the other hand...and my<br/>
sil, too...while they aren&#39;t these huge trendy fashion<br/>
plates that love the mall....they really take some<br/>
pleasure from buying a brand new sparkly outfit<br/>
accesories and all if budget permits from a department<br/>
store or one of the ever expensive but sometimes way<br/>
cool mall stores. To each his own. :)  heeh, me...when<br/>
I try on jeans (already very &quot;broken in&quot;, mind you) at<br/>
a second hand store....I decide if I like them...then<br/>
look at the tag... it says 5 bucks (a HUGE deal to<br/>
people who usually pay 30) and THEN I ask hesitantly<br/>
&quot;but do I like them FIVE BUCKS worth??&quot; yup. I&#39;m a<br/>
cheapskate.<br/>
only books and food get my splurges...ok, and kids&#39;<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yeah, I&#39;ve tried it. But my hair is stubborner (yeah,<br/>
I just made it an official word) than I ever dreamed<br/>
of being, so it didn&#39;t work on mine... I had friends<br/>
who it worked on though...doesn&#39;t last too long...<br/>
go to a beauty supply store place and get &quot;manic<br/>
panic&quot; or one of the other ones like it....there&#39;s a<br/>
whole beautiful rainbow of fruit     <br/>
flavors...blue...green...<br/>
red...purple...(oooo prrreeeettttyy....my eyes are<br/>
starting to glaze over already)... <br/>
but whatever you do... DON&quot;T try to go the cheap way<br/>
and buy a &quot;bleach and dye in one step&quot; deal. They<br/>
claim to be better cuz you don&#39;t have to bleach your<br/>
hair first and then put on the punky dye...it&#39;s all<br/>
one step. This is how my hair ended up a very uneven<br/>
pink. (though I loved it don&#39;t get me wrong...but I<br/>
was GOING FOR bright fire engine red. hm.) I would<br/>
choose the patient person&#39;s (read: anti-bobbie) route<br/>
and bleach it first then apply a really good dye (like<br/>
manic panic, etc)...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m all into all these healthy natural wayz of life...<br/>
can give up everything else not good for me in some<br/>
way at points in my life but I can&#39;t seem to quit with<br/>
this hair dye addiction. I&#39;ve tried. It&#39;s just not<br/>
gonna happen. It&#39;s one thing I allow myself. :)<br/>
<br/>
good luck.<br/>

<br/>
Great, I know exactly where to look now.  These are the stores my dd and I <br/>
have so much fun looking around in.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Savers and Goodwill are my main stays in clothing supply....thrift stores<br/>
 are blissful places....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are some clothes I buy new but almost all of our wardrobes are from <br/>
garage sales and thrift stores.  To pay full price makes me feel like I&#39;m <br/>
being ripped off.  Even the new stuff is on sale.  Most of my own clothes are <br/>
made, my main criteria for clothing is comfort and I can&#39;t get what I want <br/>
unless I make it myself.  I even take apart clothes when they get old and <br/>
make a pattern to make it new again.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;they really take some pleasure from buying a brand new sparkly outfit&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I went through a short period like this and found that I was dissatisfied <br/>
with most of the clothes in a short time.  Now they still sit in my closet, <br/>
years old, while I wear out the second hand and hand sewn stuff till it falls <br/>
off my body.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;THEN I ask hesitantly &quot;but do I like them FIVE BUCKS worth??&quot; yup. I&#39;m a<br/>
 cheapskate. only books and food get my splurges...ok, and kids&#39; stuff.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same here, when I buy clothes I&#39;m thinking &quot;Save, save, save so you can buy <br/>
fun stuff.&quot;  I would rather spend the money on cool toys or software and then <br/>
take the kids out to eat.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I will give the Kook-Aid a try first but keep the &quot;Manic Panic&quot; in mind.  I&#39;m <br/>
not sure how long I want it to last.  If I can adapt my reaction to people <br/>
staring and see it as humorous instead of annoying I might go for something <br/>
more long term.  Thanks for the advice on the two-in-one product.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m all into all these healthy natural wayz of life... can give up <br/>
everything else not good for me in some way at points in my life but I can&#39;t <br/>
seem to quit with this hair dye addiction. I&#39;ve tried. It&#39;s just not gonna <br/>
happen. It&#39;s one thing I allow myself. :)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pleasure is also healthy.  You may be more than making up for any negative <br/>
health impact by doing something that is so fun.<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing here is that my dd isn&#39;t as adventurous as I am with these <br/>
things.  Shes hesitant at the thought of dying her hair.  She wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
embarrassed by ME with purple or pink hair but she isn&#39;t sure she&#39;d want it <br/>
on her own head.  As for me, I intend to the one of those very eccentric old <br/>
ladies with funny hats, funky clothes and RAINBOW hair.<br/>
