<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646937546">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
     Been lurking for ages. :)  I feel quite strongly that a very important <br/>
issue with adopted children is that they know from when they are tiny that <br/>
they are adopted. Not in a kind of big deal kind of way but just in a it&#39;s <br/>
&#39;known&#39; kind of ways and that they were &#39;picked&#39; specially by their mum or <br/>
dad or whatever or some other way of letting them know they were very much <br/>
wanted.<br/>
My mother is adopted, so is my partners father and also my ex hubby is <br/>
adopted. They are all fine, they all knew from a very early age so early <br/>
they can&#39;t even remember when they first knew about it. It seems that people <br/>
who are told later on that they are adopted seem to suffer quite a severe <br/>
trauma. I&#39;ve seen it happen and it really worries me when I have heard ppl <br/>
say they aren&#39;t even  going to tell their child about it until they&#39;re old <br/>
enough to &#39;understand&#39;. It&#39;s too late then.<br/>

finds out or not about being adopted. The information is out there. The<br/>
child can and probably will find out at some point. They are only in control<br/>
of whether the child hears it from the parents first or from some other<br/>
source. And how damaging will it be if it come first from some other source?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212396469">I was in to watching news shows last night and vegging. One of them, I think <br/>
Prime Time had a preview for an upcoming show. It was about a boy of asian <br/>
decent who was adopted and found his parents. It looked like he was maybe <br/>
thinking of leaving to go with them as the adoptive parents were very afraid <br/>
he would go. It looked rather traumatic for all involved. Not sure when it <br/>
will be on.<br/>

I think this is definitely something that should be agreed upon before the <br/>

children come.<br/>

never find out.  What if a woman had an affair that resulted in pregnancy <br/>
right before her wedding?  Wouldn&#39;t everyone assume it was a honeymoon baby?  <br/>
I think only the woman could possibly know for sure. <br/>
<br/>
I think this kind of thing has probably happened lots of times in human <br/>
history and no one except the two involved could even suspect it.  So, do you <br/>
still think, if the woman has a change of heart when the child is say, 18, <br/>
maybe divorced from the man who raised the child, maybe not, that she should <br/>
disrupt that child&#39;s entire life to tell her secret?<br/>

I know this wasn&#39;t directed at me but I would have to say yes. There is <br/>
always a chance that the child/adult will find out. Could be something as <br/>
simple as a blood test and medical records. The offspring would feel <br/>
betrayed but nothing like if he found out way later in life and wondered why <br/>
he was lied to for so long. Maybe even the mother would be dead and then <br/>
where would he go with questions he has? It&#39;s happened before and why take a <br/>
chance like that with someone&#39;s life?<br/>

Dad know that the child is not his? That also makes it different. How old is <br/>

question has come up?<br/>
<br/>
If the dad knows all, the child should be told if he is very young and there <br/>
is still a chance that learning this won&#39;t ruin his life (say under 3). As to <br/>
the relatives, if they are going to be that snooty, why would one want them <br/>
to have an influence over that poor child&#39;s life? Even if that attitude is <br/>
not directed at the child, it will still effect him. He&#39;ll learn their <br/>
attitude. as to health and DNA, who knows what diseases lurk in the bio-dad&#39;s <br/>
genes? If telling will destroy the family, then it&#39;s not worth it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513094844">There are several different things going on right now in my family involving &quot;real&quot; adoption, adoption by a &quot;new&quot; dad, and straight out lies about a dad. I&#39;m trying to gain some perspective over all the situations. <br/>
<br/>
In the case I&#39;m speaking of now, yes the dad knows. He, not the bio dad, is listed on the birth certificate. The child is 5. There is some question of legalities, and adoption is being considered. There is no chance of getting a medical history from bio-dad. Yes, we have a rather snooty part of the family, but that is the only family the child would have. Me and my cousins grew up spending time with all their attitudes, and only one of us ended up with those attitudes for ourselves. We all saw how hurtful the attitudes were. This generation&#39;s children will see the same thing, I&#39;m sure. <br/>

Yes. I think unschooling gives the best chance for healing and is<br/>
definitely an amazing environment for any child.<br/>
