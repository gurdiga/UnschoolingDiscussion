<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217526403">I have been reading with interest the discussion relating to the family bed <br/>
and co-sleeping.  My children are 3 1/2 and almost 1 and I have never been <br/>
comfortable doing a family bed, nor has my husband.  HOWEVER, this past year <br/>
is the first time I have been a SAHM and I have noticed GREAT differences <br/>
between my children.  My dd was sorta put into a routine because of our work <br/>
schedule...because we all needed to be up and out of the house by 7 she was <br/>
very tired by about 8:00 at night.  My ds on the other hand has never needed <br/>
a schedule but watching him closely I find he is tired and ready for bed by 7 <br/>
or 7:30 -- the great difference is that my daughter slept through the night <br/>
starting at about 8 weeks and my son STILL is getting up 2 or 3 times a night <br/>
for mostly snuggling but will nurse when offered.  Both my children were or <br/>
are being breastfed.<br/>
<br/>
So, to my thoughts and questions:  my son has been sick with a very high <br/>
fever over the last few days and I have been bone tired becasue he is <br/>
constantly awake at night and only wants to be held...obviously, I brought <br/>
him into bed with us so I could attempt to get some shut-eye. <br/>
<br/>
 WELL, I need to know HOW to co-sleep with my son...he tosses and turns and <br/>
I&#39;m afraid he will get caught up in the pillows and/or the sheets...I <br/>
physically do not know the best way to get started and get him comfortable.  <br/>
Any ideas would be great.  Also, anyone here ever start a family bed with an <br/>
older child (if you count over 1 older!!)?  I&#39;m curious to know how to get us <br/>
all comfortable becasue I have a feeling he would sleep better knowing I was <br/>
next to him.  And I have already been through the list of &quot;techniques&quot; for <br/>
getting him to sleep better or longer and either I&#39;m not happy or he&#39;s not <br/>
happy and no one in our family needs to be unhappy about sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long post but I look forward to any discussion or ideas.  <br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>

<br/>
Michelle, I&#39;m sorry your little one is so miserable with a fever. First, I&#39;d<br/>
try to make him more comfortable before bed with a tepid bath, his most<br/>
comfy cotton pj&#39;s...Have you seen those new gel packs that stick to the<br/>
forehead? Just for this situation.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when my kidlets were sick, co-sleeping sucked. They&#39;d toss and turn<br/>
and kick. It was like having a little furnace with 8 legs in there. So, I<br/>
fixed up a sidecar bed. A little bed right next to ours, but slightly lower<br/>
so they couldn&#39;t roll onto mine. That way I could reach out and touch her<br/>
and bring her into the bed if she needed to breastfeed.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if it&#39;s possible, you could put a car seat there so he could sleep<br/>
slightly raised. He may have ear fluid or something else that needs to<br/>
drain. We did this with one of the kids and it really worked.<br/>

didn&#39;t have another bed to put next to our but we have sleeping bags which<br/>
the kids enjoy using.  Also I&#39;ve slept with them in my arms in the recliner<br/>
(it&#39;s oversized so there&#39;s plenty of room).  Sometimes they&#39;re not even sick<br/>
just in need of a little extra attention.</div>

It could take a couple weeks or even longer for everyone to get comfortable<br/>
with the family bed if you do decide to try it on a regular basis. I guess a<br/>
lot of it depends on how active of sleepers you are and how much room you<br/>
need. Sounds as if your son needs a lot of room :). I guess at 3 1/2 I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be too concerned about him getting caught up in the pillows or<br/>
sheets. At 19 months, my daughter doesn&#39;t use a pillow but is quite capable<br/>
of lifting off any sheets that are too high for her liking. When she was<br/>
younger, though, I would just dress in extra warm pjs and keep the sheets<br/>
closer to my waist. Then again, my dd never has liked being covered up.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s wonderful that you&#39;re thinking about starting the family bed at<br/>
this point. I have a friend who started it when her ds was almost 2 and it<br/>
worked out great.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have always co-slept with my kids and this is what we do.  I do not put <br/>
their<br/>
heads on pillows.  I sleep from the time they are infants under my armpit<br/>
(this usually works out after breastfeeding thats where they are).  I found<br/>
when they were little if they were under my armpit I could curl my arm<br/>
around there head and down their sides and keep from dad or older sibling<br/>
tossing an arm or covers on top of baby/child and if baby was on outside of<br/>
bed they couldn&#39;t fall out.  Even now my toddler doesn&#39;t sleep on pillows <br/>
but is up against me.  Maybe you can try sleeping in spoon fashion.  I<br/>
try to dress him a bit warm at night because he does like to kick the <br/>
covers off.  I sleep lightly but well (meaning wake up if there is a need<br/>
but otherwise get a good nights sleep).  If you have ever nursed lying<br/>
down then just think of it as the same thing just at night : )<br/>

<br/>
**Thanks. We don&#39;t have room, either. Small house, smaller rooms, king size<br/>
bed. Just enough room for a bassinet between the bed and the wall. Not<br/>
enough room for a toddler bed/crib mattress. I finally thought of putting a<br/>
sturdy box there with a portable changing table on top (Little Tykes)...very<br/>
well padded. This fit snug to the walls and bed. And I put it just slightly<br/>
lower than the bed so it had 3 &quot;sides&quot;. This worked until they were about 2<br/>
years. Then they were too long. Whatever works.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-379646916">Michelle,<br/>
In an article about co-sleeping on the Natural Child Project website it <br/>
mentioned a bedside co-sleeper, sort of a half crib that can be attached to <br/>
your bed for the child to sleep on and yet still be right next to you. I <br/>
don&#39;t know much about this, or if you can buy one anywhere, but I thought I <br/>
would mention it. It might make you more comfortable(literally!), adding a <br/>
little more space so that you are less likely to get kicked or wake up in <br/>
the middle of the night with your son on top of you.<br/>
And good for you to be still breastfeeding your toddler! I think that&#39;s <br/>
wonderful and I certainly intend to put it into practice on the distant day <br/>
when I have kids. :)<br/>

would be more comfortable, because you could fix the pillow and sheets so <br/>
that he couldn&#39;t get caught in them so easily. Somehow, I accidently deleted <br/>
that part. -Ren<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565987586">I&#39;ve never used a cosleeper, but from what I understand from people who<br/>
have, the amount of extra space they provide and the amount of weight they<br/>
support may only get you a couple months use out of them depending on your<br/>
child. Of course they do take up less space than a crib, so if you have<br/>
limited space in your bedroom, it might be a good investment. You can check<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-718796466">My youngest has always been a co-sleeper (until recently, when <br/>
occasionally she sleep in the girls&#39; bedroom, which has only one <br/>
bed atm, so that&#39;s a bit moot...) but the elder one, before I was <br/>
enlightened *grin* had her own bedrom, and the doorway was gated <br/>
because we had our home-business stuff in the bedroom.  Of <br/>
course, this was totally unfair, when the little&#39;un was in with us, so <br/>
when dd2 was about 6mo and dd1 almost 2yrs, dd1 moved back in <br/>
with us and the office went in her room.  We had various <br/>
arrangements, in the end, I and the two girsl slept in the big bed <br/>
while dh slept on the floor.  there was just no other way with the <br/>
stuff we had.  Now we have two 4&#39; wide beds in our large bedroom, <br/>
and they have their own room where their stuff is and they will <br/>
eventually have a bed each...  <br/>
The transition was a little tricky, but dd1 had slept on a full-length <br/>
single mattress on the floor, so when she needed help settling, one <br/>
of us could lie down with her.  So she wasn&#39;t completely wriggly.  It <br/>
does take some time for everyone to get used to each other&#39;s <br/>
presence in the bed.<br/>
