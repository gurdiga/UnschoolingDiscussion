&lt;&lt; Maybe it&#39;s just six of one and half a dozen of the other.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

world in different ways.<br/>
Those that stay in one place help build healthy bonds and strong communities. <br/>
If everyone was bent on moving, how could we have strong communities to move <br/>
to?<br/>
I appreciate those that stay put long term, as long as they are open minded <br/>
and willing to learn about other places so as not to be tunnel visioned. <br/>
There are loads of people down here that have lived here their whole life, <br/>
have strange prejudices about other places and don&#39;t understand why anyone <br/>
would want to live anywhere but the South.<br/>
That irks me.<br/>
But most of my family has lived in Alaska their entire lives and loves it. <br/>
They&#39;ve helped build Fairbanks into a wonderful, family friendly community <br/>
and have some very deep friendships through it all.<br/>
I have the travel bug and have moved a few times. So I understand both sides <br/>
and I think both types of people benefit their community.<br/>
Without the movers, you don&#39;t have the influx of new ideas/products etc.... <br/>
in the same way.  Moving around gives you insight on an area you just can&#39;t <br/>
get without being there.<br/>
I&#39;m glad there is more opportunity today for people to do either one...stay <br/>
put or move a lot.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think either is right or good and only and I think there are lots of <br/>
people in both groups who envy the benefits the others have.<br/>
