<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163888801">Hi all.<br/>
I have a bit of a problem. I have five children, four of whom are school age and the youngest is just wanting to do everything :o)<br/>
My problem is this, My third and fourth child do not want to seem to do anything. My third is 8 and in..when she was in school...at the 4th grade level. She is a very intelligent child, but it is getting very hard for  me to keep her interest in anything. The same for my fourth child. He is 5 and refuses to do any reading. Now my mother is a teacher so when she gets in she asks what have they done. My son is like, nothing and the other one just looks at you with a blank look.<br/>
I am beginning to wonder if I have made the right decision in homeschooling them. What should I do. My third child gave her teacher the same hell that she gives me...as a matter of fact so does my son...so I do not feel so bad. But what can I do.<br/>
I am feeling a bit crazy here.<br/>

For one thing, remember that kids in school also say &quot;nothing&quot; when you ask <br/>
what they learned or what happened.<br/>
<br/>
Then tell your mother to back off.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s important for a 5 year old to do any reading.<br/>
Even if this wasn&#39;t an unschooling list, I&#39;d wonder that.  What do they like<br/>
to do?  What are they interested in?  Help them do those things.  Take them<br/>
interesting places.  And most important . . . shut your mother up.  She<br/>
doesn&#39;t get it, and she&#39;s going to keep you from getting it.  If she is in<br/>
any sort of position to make trouble for you, you might want to keep a<br/>
learning log for a while and translate what the kids do into educationese.<br/>
But that&#39;s not a very good way for *you* to get unschooling, so don&#39;t do it<br/>
unless you have to.<br/>
Tia<br/>
ps Don&#39;t try to keep the 8 year old interested in anything.  Get interested<br/>
in what interests her.</div>

 </span></blockquote>HeHeHE. This happens with my 6 yo and my dad all the time! My dad is not very <br/>
supportive of hsing. He often will ask Jason what he is doing for school and <br/>
then gets worried when Jason doesn&#39;t know LOL! I am actually really glad that<br/>
Jason does not know, since we do not &quot;do&quot; school. I have also found that my memory<br/>
is not very good when my dad asks *me* what we are doing. Can&#39;t seem to think<br/>
when I am on the spot. <br/>
<br/>
So my solution (realizing that my dad is just concerned for his grandchildren and<br/>
really is a wonderful guy) was to go on the offensive. I have started a sending a monthly <br/>
email to my dad, my mom and my ILs detailing all the wonderful things that Jason is doing.<br/>
The books we are reading, the things that we have done (specifically talking about all the<br/>
socialization we are doing with other hsers ;o) ), the experiments we are doing and<br/>
any neat observations he has made that made me realize how smart he is! Basically I put<br/>
a schooly bent on our everyday lives (talking about how he is adding numbers without<br/>
mentioning that he learned it by playing Parcheesi instead of doing a math worksheet).<br/>
Basically I beat my dad to the punch...once he reads a detail email about all the great<br/>
things that we are doing he doesn&#39;t have to ask and it puts his mind at ease.<br/>
<br/>
It has worked great so far. My dad feels more at ease because he can see the what I see<br/>
every day...that Jason is learning like crazy. And it is easier for me to do since I do<br/>
not have to think things up on the spot. Plus it really is nice for the grandparents<br/>
to see what the boys are interested in. And then if my dad still gets on my case I remind him<br/>
that Jason is only 6! LOL! Oh and btw, Jason has not started reading yet and I don&#39;t really<br/>
expect him too. He loves rhyming, loves word play (thinks that it is cool that a word can<br/>
have 2 different meanings) and has an awesome vocabulary so I am not much worried. Plus<br/>
I know Jason...he will wait until he is more then ready and then do it overnight. Now<br/>
I just need to figure out how to assure my dad of this when the time comes and my dad <br/>
expects him to be reading....<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What are you trying to keep her interested in? Am I right in assuming it&#39;s<br/>
school type work?<br/>
<br/>
We know that&#39;s not only an impossible task but not a very good way to learn.<br/>
That&#39;s why we unschool! :-)<br/>
<br/>
What is *she* interested in? What does *she* want to know more about?<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s okay if she says TV! ;-) As long as she has other things that<br/>
interest her just as much available, and isnt choosing TV just because it&#39;s<br/>
the best of a bad lot of choices, then she&#39;s learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He is 5 and refuses to do any reading.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most kids aren&#39;t ready to read at 5, especially boys. And *that&#39;s* why<br/>
learning to read is so difficult. Because schools make kids do it before<br/>
they&#39;re ready and before they&#39;ve had enough fun exposure to books to even<br/>
want to read. Learning to read is no more difficult -- and in fact is much<br/>
easier since they already have the langauge down and just need to relate<br/>
print to what they know -- than learning to speak.<br/>
<br/>
If you make sure his experiences with books are always pleasurable --<br/>
snuggle under a blanket on the couch with some hot chocolate, read in bed --<br/>
then he will read when he finds it useful for him and when he&#39;s<br/>
developmentally ready.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My third child gave her teacher the same hell that she gives me...as a matter<br/>
&gt; of fact so does my son...so I do not feel so bad. But what can I do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well the first step would be to reconnect with the emotions that say there&#39;s<br/>
something wrong. If your children are giving you a hard time it&#39;s their way<br/>
of saying that something is really not right and not making sense to them.<br/>
So they are naturally complaining. We think that by forcing kids to do what<br/>
they&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to do that we&#39;re doing right and they need to just put up<br/>
with it until they figure out that we&#39;re right and they&#39;re wrong. But the<br/>
thing is that we&#39;re wrong and they&#39;re right. Kids instinctively know how<br/>
they&#39;re made to learn: by playing. That&#39;s what they want to do and they make<br/>
it very clear that we&#39;re trying to make them go against their nature. We<br/>
have to learn to *listen* to what they&#39;re telling us (by their actions and<br/>
their words) rather than what the experts tell us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609312899">It is easier said than done to shut my mother up. She has been the source of many issues and therapists for both me and another sister of mine. The things is that...I don&#39;t know... it seems as if I am failing. I have heard that it is not important for a child to read, or forced to read at 5, I have a friend was a former public school teacher who homeschools her children, tell me the same thing. Just go by when they are ready. But when you have a mother who insists on this MUST be done by such and such an age.....can you sense some issues here with me, lol.<br/>
<br/>
What interests the children. That is a good thing. They both love to talk and are fascinated with stories. The boy with dinosaurs and the other with any thing hands on. So I guess that is what I should be working to do. IS find hands on dinosaur related things for them to do. I know they both love the Magic school bus. Science experiments.<br/>
Ok I see a plan developing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-982557085">Thanks Sandra. It gives me comfort to know that I should not be forcing them- him- and that he will come around when he is ready. I have always been the child to do what she wants when she wants and HOW she wants out of my parents seven children. So this is going to be a challenge for me not only as a parent, but as a child of my parents. In particular my mother.<br/>
I am envisioning myself one day sitting in a therapist&#39;s chair explaining about my life. But I will be quite honest, I have never had the patience nor the fortitude to deal with things such as those.:o)<br/>
But this is a great list and I am so glad that all of you are so willing to share your knowledge and help and encouragement so easily and lovingly.<br/>
I really do believe I have stumbled upon a gold mine here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095486763">What are you trying to keep her interested in? Am I right in assuming it&#39;s<br/>
school type work?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes. I should know better. But I was so great in school and I see her the same way. I was the child who was in every advance class from since the sixth grade and before then was always on top. Actually before I was in the advance classes, school was beginning to get boring. My only traumatic  course in school was math. I tell my children that I earned my D in calculus when I graduated from High school doing freshman college math.<br/>
<br/>
I see her the same way. She is an extremely intelligent child. To speak with her you would be amazed. She was reading at an adult level by the time she was in second grade. But now it is as if she is interested in the TV more than doing her work. That is not to say that she won&#39;t pick up a book when she is ready or do something else constructive, but I guess when all you know is a regimented structured type of education it is hard to think outside of the box. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you make sure his experiences with books are always pleasurable --<br/>
snuggle under a blanket on the couch with some hot chocolate, read in bed --<br/>
then he will read when he finds it useful for him and when he&#39;s<br/>
developmentally ready.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh I do!! When we go to the library I let him pick out what he wants to read and then we read it when we get home. Right now he has a book on water experiments that he is enjoying looking through and I read it to him when he wants me to. His favorite show right now is the Magic School bus and Sesame Street. SO I let him watch those. Not to mention Dora The Explorer. My children are half Spanish so are continually asking me to speak it to them. Though I don&#39;t know enough to teach them correctly. But I try to make it interesting.<br/>
For all of them, the 8 year old included, just found out that they have Amerindian blood in them, so that has led to a pique..at least for the 8 year old, in books dealing with Amerindian studies. But unfortunately the books here and the information is difficulty to come by. But the interest is there.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Kids instinctively know how<br/>
they&#39;re made to learn: by playing. That&#39;s what they want to do and they make<br/>
it very clear that we&#39;re trying to make them go against their nature. We<br/>

their words) rather than what the experts tell us.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know you are right here Joyce so I think I need an unschooling course myself. I had to deal yesterday with my oldest - the 11 year old - crying that she hates homeschooling and that she wants to go back to school. Which frustrated me to no end because when I told them that I would be doing the homeschooling this was the one who yelled out Hooray!! the loudest and could not wait to begin. I guess it has not even lived up to MY expectations of what homeschooling should be. I was keeping them current with what they were doing in school, but then just went a different path. I saw that they were not interested and began just doing history a lot or having them write stories alot. Which my second, the 10 year old - enjoys doing. I can see that I have a lot to learn before I can even begin to school them properly. And now I have my 2 year old showing and interest in reading. Right now she is looking through the science book the 5 year old took out. And I can hear my mother belittling me about not putting more of an emphasis on the reading and if I do not get to them before age 3 then everything is lost and they will never regain those lost years and.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-94083787">Thanks Amy. The tape recorder thing sounds like a great idea. Luckily I get MSB here on cable, TLC, so they are watching that. As for the hammer and things. He has so many Bob the Builder type toys and so on. I need to look into more hands on things for ALL.<br/>
His thing is that he will sit and watch Dragon Tales, Sesame Street, and all the nice children shows for the whole day if he can. If I ask him if he wants to do anything else he will say&quot; No thanks&quot; and that is the end of it. Mind you, his grammar and vocabulary is stellar for a child his age, but I am still worried.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another &quot;hands-on&quot; we&#39;ve done with both boys. They have A LOT of input:<br/>
<br/>
Cameron was a dinosaur FREAK for years. He had a prehistoric room. It was <br/>
heavily dormered with lots of nook and crannies. We painted the walls light <br/>
blue, but also made large plant leaves (fern-y and palm-like) from the floor <br/>
up. I painted these HUGE dinosaurs (and a few small ones) all over the <br/>
room---some of their long necks reached around the walls. We had dinosaur <br/>
sheets and pillows and lamp and plastic and stuffed dinosaurs EVERYWHERE! I <br/>
used chalkboard paint so that he could draw his own on the walls.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan now has a Batcave (Some here have seen it). The walls are the <br/>
dark/bright blue. It has a huge glow-in-the-dark bat signal and a Batmobile <br/>
and black Gotham City (with glow-in-the-dark windows) and a chalkboard wall. <br/>
Batman sheets and Batman characters everwhere. He&#39;s also into Spiderman, so <br/>
there&#39;s a Spiderman corner. He&#39;s going to be a Superhero---and as Deb said, <br/>
&quot;That&#39;s good, because we just don&#39;t have enough of those nowadays!&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cameron has recently re-done his room. He did it ALL himself. It&#39;s a CKY room <br/>
(his favorite band). He has their logos everywhere. These cool shadow <br/>
drawings he&#39;s painted on the walls. Really neat.<br/>
<br/>
I like for them to be surrounded by whatever they love. Personalizing their <br/>
rooms is a (relatively) cheap and artistic way to create a &quot;haven&quot; and to let <br/>
them really get into their interests.<br/>
<br/>
It would be a good way to &quot;start&quot; unschooling. It would take a while to plan <br/>
and do (and it would get rid of the &quot;schoolish&quot; ideas and thinking---because <br/>
you&#39;re so busy).<br/>

she was in second grade. But now it is as if she is interested in the TV<br/>
more than doing her work. That is not to say that she won&#39;t pick up a book<br/>
when she is ready or do something else constructive, but I guess when all<br/>
you know is a regimented structured type of education it is hard to think<br/>
outside of the box. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the thing she&#39;s interested in is TV, give her TV.  Let her watch whatever<br/>
she wants to watch, and watch some of it with her.  The things she chooses<br/>
to watch will give you clues as to what else she might be interested in.<br/>

experiments that he is enjoying looking through and I read it to him when he<br/>
wants me to. His favorite show right now is the Magic School bus and Sesame<br/>
Street. SO I let him watch those. Not to mention Dora The Explorer. My<br/>
children are half Spanish so are continually asking me to speak it to them.<br/>
Though I don&#39;t know enough to teach them correctly. But I try to make it<br/>
interesting.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming from your name that it&#39;s their dad who is Spanish.  Would he be<br/>
willing to talk to them in Spanish?  I have friends in Germany who did that.<br/>
From day one, the German mother used German and the American father used<br/>
English with the kids.  They understood English from a very young age but<br/>
didn&#39;t actually speak it until they came to the States for a visit.  I wish<br/>
my own parents had done that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For all of them, the 8 year old included, just found out that they have<br/>
Amerindian blood in them, so that has led to a pique..at least for the 8<br/>
year old, in books dealing with Amerindian studies. But unfortunately the<br/>
books here and the information is difficulty to come by. But the interest is<br/>
there.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cynthialeitichsmith.com/NativeThemes.htm">http://www.cynthialeitichsmith.com/NativeThemes.htm</a> has lists of books by<br/>
and about Amerindians.  Historical novels are a great way to learn about any<br/>
kind of history, and she also lists contemporary novels with a native theme.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I know you are right here Joyce so I think I need an unschooling course<br/>
 </span></blockquote>myself.<br/>
<br/>
One thing you could do is to not call it a &quot;course&quot;.  That&#39;s schooly<br/>
thinking that you&#39;re trying to get away from.  But yes, you need to learn<br/>
lots about unschooling if you want it to work for your kids.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I had to deal yesterday with my oldest - the 11 year old - crying that she<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hates homeschooling and that she wants to go back to school. Which<br/>
frustrated me to no &gt;end because when I told them that I would be doing the<br/>
homeschooling this was the one who yelled out Hooray!! the loudest and could<br/>
not wait to begin. I guess it &gt;has not even lived up to MY expectations of<br/>
what homeschooling should be.<br/>
<br/>
Maybd you could try to find out just exactly what she misses about school.<br/>
Is it friends?  Help her find some new ones or find ways to stay connected<br/>
with the ones from school.  Does she believe she&#39;s not learning anything?<br/>
Try keeping a learning log for her.  Write downt the things you&#39;ve noticed<br/>
that she knows that she didn&#39;t know a while ago.  It might surprise you<br/>
both.  Whatever it is she&#39;s missing, help her to find it from home.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I was keeping them current with what they were doing in school, but then<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just went a different path. I saw that they were not interested and began<br/>
just doing history &gt;a lot or having them write stories alot. Which my<br/>
second, the 10 year old - enjoys doing.<br/>
<br/>
This is good, but maybe you could think about not &quot;having them&quot; do anything<br/>
but just offering possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I can see that I have a lot to learn before I can even begin to school them<br/>
 </span></blockquote>properly.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s that vocabulary again.  You don&#39;t *want* to school them, properly or<br/>
otherwise.  &lt;g&gt;  At least I assume you&#39;re here because you want to unschool.<br/>
It really does help to change the words you use.  The words you use reflect<br/>
and influence your thinking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And now I have my 2 year old showing and interest in reading. Right now she<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is looking through the science book the 5 year old took out. And I can hear<br/>
my &gt;mother belittling me about not putting more of<br/>
<br/>
The rest of this got clipped somehow.  It&#39;s great the 2 year old is showing<br/>
an interest.  Try not to push her in any way, so you don&#39;t turn off that<br/>
interest.  And be prepared for her to get to actual reading in her own sweet<br/>
time.<br/>

The same kind of damage school does, you can do at home!<br/>
So your goal should be NOT to do that school-style damage.<br/>

Or if you&#39;re determined to think it is NOT damaging, send them back to school <br/>
so they can resent professional strangers for ruining their lives, instead of <br/>
resenting you.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I see her the same way. She is an extremely intelligent child. To speak <br/>
with her you would be amazed. She was reading at an adult level by the time <br/>

<br/>
I have another recommendation for you.  Read about Howard Gardner&#39;s multiple <br/>
intelligences if you haven&#39;t already.  &#39;Extremely intelligent&#39; applied just <br/>
to verbal is what schools have been doing for a long, long time.  SAT tests <br/>
are verbal and math, and they declare &quot;genius&quot; on those without regard to how <br/>
totally lacking that person might be at music or kinesthetics or <br/>
interpersonals.   And someone who is an incredible artist, dancer and <br/>
counsellor can be declared mentally deficient by those same measures.<br/>
<br/>
It is altogether very, very bad.<br/>
<br/>
And the other suggestion I have is to re-think &quot;reading at an adult level.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just because someone can sound out derision doesn&#39;t mean she knows what it <br/>
can mean and has felt it.  Just because someone can speak aloud words about <br/>
love and motherhood and sexual arousal and grief doesn&#39;t mean she has the <br/>
first CLUE what she&#39;s reading about.  <br/>
<br/>
Reading is much more than phonics.  It has to do with the stimulation of <br/>
thought and ideas.  Most good readers don&#39;t even have a phonics second when <br/>
they&#39;re reading fluently.  They don&#39;t turn those words back into sounds in <br/>
the air, but go straight to thought.<br/>
<br/>
Until she has the understanding an adult has, she can&#39;t read at an adult <br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to make you feel bad, I&#39;m trying to open up your field of <br/>
vision so you see the world as big as it is instead of looking at it through <br/>
the small lens of school thinking.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s exactly what we did without knowing it a few years ago!  Cait picked <br/>
out dark purplish blue paint (very dark, night sky dark) it took LOTS of <br/>
coats to get it as dark as she wanted.  We painted yellow glow in the dark <br/>
stars all over the walls and then she added glitter paint to the tops which <br/>
didn&#39;t work with the glow in the dark paint.  So repainted them all glitter <br/>
first, THEN glow in the dark on top.  We used those net type christmas lights <br/>
and stapled those to the ceiling, loosely draped sheer fabric we had dyed the <br/>
dark dark purple and they sorta billow from the ceiling.  She does have <br/>
billowy yellow sheers at her window because she wanted more &quot;light&quot; colors <br/>
over there with a sheer dark fabric with glittery stars for a topper.<br/>
<br/>
We worked a lot longer on it than it was necessary but it was the very first <br/>
thing we did with her home, together.  Lots of people complained that they <br/>
would NEVER let their child pick out that color paint, telling me how it <br/>
would take an &quot;act of god&quot; to cover it up,  and many other expressions of <br/>
dislike.  <br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t care, she loved it and I loved the joy of her doing her first <br/>
really not so prissy pink room, I guess a &quot;big girl&quot; room.  There are tons of <br/>
star accessories and I think she has one of each in there.  She&#39;s a big pack <br/>
rat, I haven&#39;t even seen the floor of her room in years, I&#39;m not sure the <br/>
carpet is even under there.  <br/>
<br/>
That was one of the very BIGGIES for me, just letting go, not suggesting or <br/>
nagging that one should be able to walk in one&#39;s room.  One should be able to <br/>
enter without just flinging themselves from the door way to the bed.  One <br/>
must be neat and tidy so ones room looks special.  All those little hints <br/>
that mothers sometimes give (well mine just went in and gathered up anything <br/>
on the floor and threw it out, no questions, no compromises, no matter what <br/>
it was gone forever).  So as she&#39;s gathered ever more treasures, in the last <br/>
year she&#39;s come to find herself sleeping in her sisters old room down the <br/>
hall.  It was very neat and tidy, not nearly as cute but fine for sleeping <br/>
and watching TV.  These days...not even close to neat and tidy, which is a <br/>
never ending battle when the other children are over.<br/>
<br/>
So would be totally content for me to go into the room and clean it but I <br/>
can&#39;t, so it stays in totally chaos, and I&#39;m not kidding about not one spot <br/>
or corner clear, it is FULL of treasures.  One day she will decide there are <br/>
things she no longer wants and decide what to do with them.  I know this, the <br/>
attic is FULL of treasures the older children finally decided they were done <br/>
with (but not REALLY done) and one day they won&#39;t even want the comfort of <br/>
them being at least in the attic ( I hope so anyway, it&#39;s running out of <br/>
space!)<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it great fun to watch our children create their own habitat and see <br/>
what they do with it?  Dh finally has accepted it and just has one rule, keep <br/>
the door SHUT if you want your room to look like a dump truck backed up and <br/>
dumped a load of household things in there. So she keeps the door shut.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed hearing about all the creative rooms you have for your children, <br/>
anyone else have something really special?  <br/>

  billowy yellow sheers at her window because she wanted more &quot;light&quot; colors <br/>
  over there with a sheer dark fabric with glittery stars for a topper.<br/>
<br/>
  We worked a lot longer on it than it was necessary but it was the very first <br/>
  thing we did with her home, together.  Lots of people complained that they <br/>
  would NEVER let their child pick out that color paint, telling me how it <br/>
  would take an &quot;act of god&quot; to cover it up,  and many other expressions of <br/>
  dislike.  <br/>
<br/>
  We didn&#39;t care, she loved it and I loved the joy of her doing her first <br/>
  really not so prissy pink room, I guess a &quot;big girl&quot; room.  There are tons of <br/>
  star accessories and I think she has one of each in there.  She&#39;s a big pack <br/>
  rat, I haven&#39;t even seen the floor of her room in years, I&#39;m not sure the <br/>
  carpet is even under there.  <br/>
<br/>
  That was one of the very BIGGIES for me, just letting go, not suggesting or <br/>
  nagging that one should be able to walk in one&#39;s room.  One should be able to <br/>
  enter without just flinging themselves from the door way to the bed.  One <br/>
  must be neat and tidy so ones room looks special.  All those little hints <br/>
  that mothers sometimes give (well mine just went in and gathered up anything <br/>
  on the floor and threw it out, no questions, no compromises, no matter what <br/>
  it was gone forever).  So as she&#39;s gathered ever more treasures, in the last <br/>
  year she&#39;s come to find herself sleeping in her sisters old room down the <br/>
  hall.  It was very neat and tidy, not nearly as cute but fine for sleeping <br/>
  and watching TV.  These days...not even close to neat and tidy, which is a <br/>
  never ending battle when the other children are over.<br/>
<br/>
  So would be totally content for me to go into the room and clean it but I <br/>
  can&#39;t, so it stays in totally chaos, and I&#39;m not kidding about not one spot <br/>
  or corner clear, it is FULL of treasures.  One day she will decide there are <br/>
  things she no longer wants and decide what to do with them.  I know this, the <br/>
  attic is FULL of treasures the older children finally decided they were done <br/>
  with (but not REALLY done) and one day they won&#39;t even want the comfort of <br/>
  them being at least in the attic ( I hope so anyway, it&#39;s running out of <br/>
  space!)<br/>
<br/>
  Isn&#39;t it great fun to watch our children create their own habitat and see <br/>
  what they do with it?  Dh finally has accepted it and just has one rule, keep <br/>
  the door SHUT if you want your room to look like a dump truck backed up and <br/>
  dumped a load of household things in there. So she keeps the door shut.<br/>
<br/>
  I enjoyed hearing about all the creative rooms you have for your children, <br/>
  anyone else have something really special?  <br/>

&lt;&lt; I tell my children that I earned my D in calculus when I graduated from <br/>
High school doing freshman college math. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I bet they don&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
Stories about grades and school are nonsense to kids in school.   That&#39;s a <br/>
funny story for you to tell kids.  It&#39;s probably worth trying to tell them <br/>
stories about your life and learning that have nothing to do with school, <br/>
whenever you can, for a couple of reasons.  They won&#39;t relate to school <br/>
stories.  And you yourself need to review your life and find what was real <br/>
and NOT school-based.   What things did you learn by playing and talking to <br/>
people and experimenting.  Those are the models you should build on for <br/>
creating opportunities for your kids.  And how many more of those real-life <br/>
learning situations could you have had if you weren&#39;t so focussed on school <br/>
and school stuff?<br/>
<br/>
Lots of us here did well in school.  Try to get over it.  Don&#39;t live there <br/>
forever.  Don&#39;t let it be the way you define yourself and identify your worth.<br/>

&lt;&lt; And what else can you do really? Think about it. How can you teach <br/>
(coerce, <br/>
force, cajole) a child who is not developmentally ready? When they&#39;re ready, <br/>
they will learn. I&#39;ve seen it happen over and over. It&#39;s not a miracle. It&#39;s <br/>
just the natural way to learn, on the learner&#39;s schedule. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
True, and if anyone doubts it, try teaching an eight month old baby to walk.  <br/>
It truly won&#39;t work.  And nobody really tries it because it&#39;s patently stupid.<br/>
<br/>
But because of school&#39;s time/age/grade stuff, and because schools pre-date <br/>
any of us being born, and because school is SO big in so many people&#39;s lives, <br/>
we kinda start thinking of it as something real.   <br/>
<br/>
But trying to teach a five year old boy to read is like trying to teach a <br/>
baby to walk before he&#39;s ready.   <br/>
<br/>
First, you don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; babies to walk.  They pull up when they want to and <br/>
they walk when they can.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same with reading.<br/>
<br/>
SOME five year old boys read.  SOME eight month old babies walk.  Not many.  <br/>
And there is NO advantage to it, either.  Babies sitting are safer than <br/>
babies walking.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, one of the recurring discussions among homeschoolers is how to <br/>
protect teenaged boys from the evils of the internet.  Maybe I should start <br/>
saying &quot;Discourage reading.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Damned if reading doesn&#39;t lead straight to pornography.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if fewer men were traumatized about reading, they&#39;d be more into story <br/>
porn and less into photographs!  <br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m joking.)<br/>

I remember when I graduated from nursing school.  A total of 16 years of school from K to NS graduation.  I didn&#39;t know what to do with myself, and I didn&#39;t know who I was.<br/>
I felt like a leaf blown around with no sense of identity because my whole identity was wrapped up in school.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you LIKE school, its only a fraction of your life, and then REAL life begins.  <br/>
<br/>
How do you learn now?  I learn by just going out and finding information, by getting involved, and I learn more now than I ever did when I was in school, in spite of the fact that I liked it and I did well there.<br/>

I just felt that they were not getting the education that they should be getting and I was tired of hearing about the fights and the trouble and the kids that kept doing this and that.

  Are you schooling them at home, Yoki? I could see resistance to that. I <br/>
  can&#39;t imagine resistance to an unschooling life. It&#39;s all about the freedom <br/>
  to choose.<br/>

  How are your kids choosing tospend their time. Try to fucus on what they are <br/>
  interestedin, not on what they&#39;re not doing that maybe a schooled kid is <br/>
  being coerced to do.<br/>

  &gt; What interests the children. That is a good thing. They both love to talk<br/>
  and are fascinated with stories. The boy with dinosaurs and the other with<br/>

  find hands on dinosaur related things for them to do. I know they both love<br/>
  the Magic school bus. Science experiments.<br/>
  &gt; Ok I see a plan developing.<br/>
<br/>
  This is good.  Just don&#39;t get attached to your plan.  &lt;g&gt;  Make it<br/>
  tentative.  And make it entirely optional for the kids.  You want to offer<br/>
  them fun stuff to do that goes with their interests.  Then you can show them<br/>
  other things that relate to those interests.<br/>

Yes she reads on an adult level and if you ask her what she just read she explains it to you and breaks it down. She has an uncanny way with words and how she uses them. That is one child that I have never had to say..you used the word wrong. She not only knows how to say them, but she knows what they mean. Her interpersonal skills are wicked good. She can see someone either her age, younger or older and begin to a conversation with them like nothing. Sometimes you forget that you are speaking to an 8 year old. I have actually witnessed her dumbing down herself so as not to get &quot;ridden&quot; by children her own age. Her one problem is her math. But that is not because she does not know it, she just does not feel the need to use it right now. When she does need it she is brilliant, but if she cannot see the application for it in the here and now then forget it.<br/>

  &lt;&lt; I see her the same way. She is an extremely intelligent child. To speak <br/>
  with her you would be amazed. She was reading at an adult level by the time <br/>
  she was in second grade.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I have another recommendation for you.  Read about Howard Gardner&#39;s multiple <br/>
  intelligences if you haven&#39;t already.  &#39;Extremely intelligent&#39; applied just <br/>
  to verbal is what schools have been doing for a long, long time.  SAT tests <br/>
  are verbal and math, and they declare &quot;genius&quot; on those without regard to how <br/>
  totally lacking that person might be at music or kinesthetics or <br/>
  interpersonals.   And someone who is an incredible artist, dancer and <br/>
  counsellor can be declared mentally deficient by those same measures.<br/>
<br/>
  It is altogether very, very bad.<br/>
<br/>
  And the other suggestion I have is to re-think &quot;reading at an adult level.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Just because someone can sound out derision doesn&#39;t mean she knows what it <br/>
  can mean and has felt it.  Just because someone can speak aloud words about <br/>
  love and motherhood and sexual arousal and grief doesn&#39;t mean she has the <br/>
  first CLUE what she&#39;s reading about.  <br/>
<br/>
  Reading is much more than phonics.  It has to do with the stimulation of <br/>
  thought and ideas.  Most good readers don&#39;t even have a phonics second when <br/>
  they&#39;re reading fluently.  They don&#39;t turn those words back into sounds in <br/>
  the air, but go straight to thought.<br/>
<br/>
  Until she has the understanding an adult has, she can&#39;t read at an adult <br/>
  level.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not trying to make you feel bad, I&#39;m trying to open up your field of <br/>
  vision so you see the world as big as it is instead of looking at it through <br/>
  the small lens of school thinking.<br/>
