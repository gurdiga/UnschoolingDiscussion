<div id="ygrps-yiv-98035469">Well,<br/>
 <br/>
I posted a few weeks ago about possibly doing an interview with the local paper.  I did it yesterday and I think it went pretty well.  I know I won&#39;t know until it comes out, but all in all I was impressed with the reporter.<br/>
 <br/>
She had come pretty prepared.  She had read at unschooling.com and at Sandra&#39;s site.  So, she at least knew where I was coming from.  That was nice.<br/>
 <br/>
She asked all the usual questions,  a bit about socializing, won&#39;t the kids have to learn to do stuff they don&#39;t like to do and aren&#39;t you afraid they won&#39;t be learning everything they need.  I feel pretty confident with my answers although sometimes I felt like I was babbling.  We&#39;ll see how it comes across.<br/>
 <br/>
This was my first interview.  They are going to send out a photographer either today or tomorrow,  I guess they&#39;ll probably be seeing Kyra (7) painting or drawing, Abbi (10) on the computer and Alec(11) playing a video game.  :)  This is what we&#39;ve been doing a lot of lately.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure I&quot;ll have some interesting responses.  Especially when she asked me &quot;what about kids with bahavior problems?  Your kids seem very inquisitive, smart and well behaved.  What about kids not like that.&quot;  I said that from what I&#39;ve seen,  most of those  &quot;problems&quot; go away when you remove school.   I told her all kids shine when they unschool. :)<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway,  though I&#39;d share.<br/>
 <br/>
