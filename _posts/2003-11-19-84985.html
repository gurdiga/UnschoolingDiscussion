<div id="ygrps-yiv-522237551">Here in PA we have to do portfolios to hand in to the district AND be <br/>
evaluated by a certified school teacher AND hand in a reading list <br/>
AND take standardized tests in certain grades.  Plus a whole bunch of <br/>
other stuff that districts or some school-at-homers have made a <br/>
normal part of the portfolio and in some districts, even though it&#39;s <br/>
not in the law that you provide it, the district gets away <br/>
with &quot;requiring&quot; it because the precedent has been set.  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of people recommend against using pictures because it gives the <br/>
school too much of a glimpse into your life.  Be aware of anything in <br/>
the background picture, especially if the picture is taken in your <br/>
house.  You don&#39;t want a messy house or a sink full of dishes in the <br/>
background, kids in the picture who look like their hair hasn&#39;t been <br/>
brushed or clothes that don&#39;t look perfectly neat and clean.  You <br/>
just don&#39;t want to take the chance that anyone at the school would <br/>
report you to social services for anything.  Plus some districts <br/>
don&#39;t give portfolios back or lose portfolios, so if you give them a <br/>
scrapbook there&#39;s a chance you won&#39;t get your pictures back.  And of <br/>
course if a lot of homeschoolers get in the habit of handing in <br/>
pictures, it sets a precedent and schools will start expecting <br/>
pictures, making it hard on those who don&#39;t want to or can&#39;t afford <br/>
to give pictures.  <br/>
<br/>
Brochures from trips are good, photocopied worksheets are good, big <br/>
long reading lists showing lots and lots of book titles are good.  <br/>

If your library is on a computerized system, you can just keep the <br/>
printout when you check the books out. Throw it in a file labelled <br/>
for each month. <br/>
<br/>
Throw in brochures from museums, art shows, movie stubs, appropriate <br/>
(meaning stuff they would *think* is educational) video rental <br/>
receipts, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Take pictures of the kids doing stuff that&#39;s not easily documented <br/>
automatically. If they&#39;re playing a board game, doing stuff on the <br/>
computer, building a cool lego creation, building a model, setting <br/>
off rockets, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Throw in whatever writing or doodles or pictures they&#39;ve done. <br/>
<br/>
The progress will be there because your kids *are* learning.<br/>

<br/>
Pictures tell great stories!<br/>
This is from an e-mail I got from our friends in Arkansas, who just<br/>
received some pictures I sent in their late Birthday, early Christmas<br/>
package. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The picture of Dyl on the piano bench is great.  Did you make the hat?? <br/>
Is that a song he&#39;s writing?  Did he fold the origami horse?  He&#39;s<br/>
getting good!<br/>
I can see the wolf puzzle on the table. Do you remember that stupid fish<br/>
puzzle? lol.   I see you&#39;ve been painting.  The first one looks like Eli,<br/>
is it? lol..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She knew more about what we&#39;d been doing than I had written, and she knew<br/>
because of that picture.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t have to submit a portfolio, but it seems pictures would really<br/>
cut down on the amount of writing and explaining one would have to do.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610677885">Last year we took photos of our son on the trampoline, computer, helping his <br/>
dad build the shed/barn (turned out larger than planned) and surfing.<br/>
<br/>
I made a list of books that he said he had read throughout the year or that I <br/>
read to him.<br/>
<br/>
I pointed out that his new interest in reading was enough accomplishment for <br/>
me that year as he hadn&#39;t touched a book since he left school. She agreed.<br/>
<br/>
I noted his interests.<br/>
<br/>
I also detailed all the items he had sold on Ebay and that he did the write <br/>
ups for the auctions, packaging of the boxes and that he had his own Paypal <br/>
card and handled his own account and balances. <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t much. I held up the binder pointing to the photos printed on <br/>
regular paper and showed some old school papers with nasty red marks.<br/>
Ours are 15 minutes long and done in a group setting so it goes fast.<br/>

&gt; Amazing, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds paranoid, but if you&#39;ve been on PA lists and over and over <br/>
have seen people saying &quot;Oh my Gosh, my school district is doing <br/>
this, this, and this and saying I have to do this, this, and this <br/>
(almost always referring to something they&#39;re requiring that they <br/>
don&#39;t have a legal right to require, but the law provides for no <br/>
punitive action against a school who doesn&#39;t obey the law).  Can they <br/>
make me send my kids back to school?  What if they take me to court?  <br/>
What if I lose at court?&quot;  I&#39;ve heard it MANY times.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally know someone who had children and youth sent to her home <br/>
and she found out it had been the school district who called--they <br/>
were mad because she hadn&#39;t complied with something.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally know someone who was a teacher in a PA school and told <br/>
me that the superintendent said at a staff meeting, &quot;We can&#39;t stop <br/>
people from homeschooling but we can make it as hard as possible on <br/>
them&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I think maybe people have a good reason to be paranoid.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it is very likely.  We failed last time around--it <br/>
didn&#39;t get out of the education committee of the house of reps.  Now <br/>
we have a governor who would refuse to sign a better homeschool law, <br/>
so we would need a 2/3 veto-proof vote in the house and senate.  Not <br/>
likely.  It&#39;s really sad actually, because there were people in PA <br/>
who sacrificed a LOT of time with their families to try to get that <br/>
passed.  That&#39;s the thing that&#39;s rotten about trying to get new <br/>
homeschool laws--the people who have to try to fight against paid, <br/>
professional education lobbyists are moms whose kids really need them <br/>
at home.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would move before I would hide or stick out a chicken bone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s easy to say, and I&#39;ve considered it a few times.  But my <br/>
husband has a good job, he&#39;s comfortable here and wouldn&#39;t be happy <br/>
moving, my kids are comfortable here and wouldn&#39;t be happy moving. <br/>
We&#39;ve put a lot into making our house the way we want it.  Our house <br/>
is VERY unschool friendly and chances are we wouldn&#39;t be able to <br/>
afford a house this nice in other parts of the country.  I mean, we <br/>
just built an addition and are making it a video game room.  I think <br/>
some members of my family would rather I stick out chicken bones than <br/>
give that up.  Is that weak and compromising?  Maybe, or maybe it&#39;s <br/>
just doing what&#39;s best for my family right now.  <br/>
<br/>
Besides, I don&#39;t have pictures of my superintendent&#39;s family.  Why <br/>
should he get pictures of mine?  If he invites me to his home and <br/>
introduces me to his family, then maybe I&#39;ll be more open to sharing <br/>
more personal info with him.  But for now, if chicken bones can <br/>
satisfy the letter of the law, that&#39;s better than personal info imo.  <br/>

&lt;&gt;A lot of people are too paranoid.  Amazing, isn&#39;t it?&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra:<br/>
<br/>
True.  A lot of people are way too paranoid about the whole portfolio <br/>
assessment option in Ohio, which is where this topic originated.  As <br/>
I stated, it is totally up to the teacher.  The form we certified OH <br/>
teachers sign is very brief, and it requires very little, so <br/>
the &quot;unschool friendly&quot; teacher is not going to be looking at much of <br/>
anything, at all.  But newbies probably panic when they hear members <br/>
of certain more fundamentalist groups tell them they have to do this, <br/>
that, and the other thing.  Just not true.  It is so much simpler <br/>
than some folks think it is.  <br/>
<br/>
And, as I also clearly stated, there is a third option, which is the <br/>
one I opted for when I moved here from New Mexico.  And that is that <br/>
you can do whatever you and your superintendent agree upon.  I just <br/>
wrote a letter to my super stating that I felt I was the best person <br/>
to do this portfolio assessment, and explained why, never stating <br/>
that I was an OH certified teacher, by the way, just a home educating <br/>
parent.  What that means is that I get to sign that simple piece of <br/>
paper myself for my child.  How easy can it get?  People believe <br/>
myths about these regs, when all anyone has to do is read them, <br/>
carefully, and they will see that they really do not require much at <br/>
all.  And there is no punishment in this section of the regs, either.<br/>
<br/>
Of course there are a few control-freak superintendents in Ohio, and <br/>
they do make it their goal in life to harass home educators, but <br/>
these home educators just need to hook up with a good support group <br/>
to find out the truth and stop providing more than the regs require, <br/>
which just hurts the rest of us, opens the door to support <br/>
legislation that would seek more control over us all.  What I always <br/>
suggest when dealing with these supers is to take a copy of the regs <br/>
along, hold it out to them, and ask them to show you just where in <br/>
the regs it says whatever they are telling you that you must do.  <br/>
Gets them every time.  Most supers have never read the regs at all.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;Photocopies worksheets?  Remember when Hansel stuck a chicken bone <br/>
out so the blind witch could see if he was gaining weight? How sad <br/>
that people have to live in those conditions.   I hope that law is <br/>
changed before too long.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The law is not going to be changed anytime soon.  And if it were it <br/>
would be as a result of federal intervention, which would probably <br/>
keep it tied up in court for a good long while.  No one needs to see <br/>
photocopied worksheets, and no one in Ohio submits anything <br/>
whatsoever to the schools directly.  The only thing mailed is a <br/>
notification letter, telling the school that we are exercising our <br/>
right to home educate our own children, spitting back the <br/>
requirements listed in the regs, saying that we will do what they <br/>
say, and asking for a letter excusing us from compulsory attendance.  <br/>
But no detail is required whatsoever.  In subsequent years, after the <br/>
first notification we do have to submit one of the three forms of <br/>
assessment that I listed in my last post.  Three very good options, <br/>
that include arranging it with your superintendent that you can do <br/>
any assessing yourself.  <br/>
<br/>
The funniest thing is that even though I have been preaching this <br/>
third option for six years now, very few people will even try to take <br/>
advantage of it.  All it requires is that the home educating parent <br/>
present a simple, good rationale to the super why he or she should be <br/>
the one assessing his or her own child.  That&#39;s easy!  Who else would <br/>
be better qualified?  If you write a good letter stating your <br/>
rationale then I have yet to find any super who has refused to allow <br/>
the parent to do this.  And all &quot;this&quot; requires is filling in the <br/>
blanks on a simple form, a few sentences.  So why do folks make it so <br/>
complicated?  Why do they think this is so difficult?  I sure don&#39;t <br/>
know.  But I do know that it doesn&#39;t have to be.  <br/>
<br/>
And for those who are just too terrified to approach their super, <br/>
even in a letter, then the other two options are avaiable that I <br/>
listed earlier.  This is not the best state for home education, but <br/>
it is also not the worst.  I suggest everyone in every state read <br/>
their regulations carefully, use their own brains, question what they <br/>
read, and do not just take the word of someone else, or some other <br/>
organization, especially those known to be rather conservative.  <br/>
<br/>
Since our group offers free portfolio assessments to all interested <br/>
members, all anyone who doesn&#39;t want to tackle the super has to do is <br/>
plan ahead for that, join our group free of charge, enjoy the company <br/>
of other home educators for an afternoon, and that&#39;s that.  How could <br/>
it be easier?  Well, yes, we could have no assessment requirements, <br/>
which would suit me just fine.  But in a way we have that with the <br/>
third option.  Which is the one I use.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;I would move before I would hide or stick out a chicken bone.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No one in Ohio has to hide of stick out a chicken bone.  And if it <br/>
every came down to that, I would be the first to move, rest assured.<br/>
Either to Michigan, or back to New Mexico.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-136119054">New Creation Academy is based in Pennsylvania but PA doesn&#39;t have the <br/>
option of an umbrella school in the homeschool law.  Maryland <br/>

Creation Academy as an alternative to the homeschool law.  It is a <br/>
good place for PA homeschoolers to go to find an unschooling-friendly <br/>

<br/>
I have been asked to do that many times.  But there is a difference <br/>
between a notification letter (letter of intent), which is just a <br/>
formality, declaring our right to educate our kids at home, and this <br/>
letter, which should be to suggest something personal, and should be <br/>
in the words of each particular home educator.  I have offered clear <br/>
suggestions and also offered that if folks want to email their <br/>
letters to me I would be happy to read them and make suggestions.  <br/>
<br/>
For this letter, it&#39;s the rationale that counts, how well each parent <br/>
explains why he or she should be assessing their own, can do it <br/>
better than anyone else coming in for a few minutes or hours once a <br/>
year. It should explain how we are, by state regulations, granted the <br/>
same privileges as any classroom teacher in all other areas and are <br/>
certainly the best suited, best prepared to do this job, and why.  If <br/>
this letter is brief (one page), spelled properly, uses good grammar, <br/>
punctuation, and sentence structure, then, as I said, no one has ever <br/>
had this request turned down, so far.  <br/>
<br/>
But then, the regs are written in such a way that theoretically a <br/>
superintendent could turn down this request, if he or she did not <br/>
agree with your request.  The regs do not spell out what is or is not <br/>
acceptable for this alternative.  So far no super has done this, but <br/>
there are a few humdingers out there, so I know it could happen.  If <br/>
it ever happened to me I would just keep sending in more suggestions, <br/>
over and over again, until the super got tired of it and approved one <br/>
of them.    <br/>
<br/>
My recommendation is to write your own letter for this, keep it <br/>
simple.  If insecure ask others in e-groups or local support groups <br/>
to read your letter, see what they think, and then go for it.  Do <br/>
this early enough, say early spring, so that if your super should <br/>
turn you down you can still do other things, like:  make other <br/>
suggestions to your superintendent; get the free portfolio assessment <br/>
with our group (must join our free group by Jan. 1); or find a <br/>
private OH certified teacher to do your portfolio assessment for a <br/>
fee; or find a nationally normed achievement test that you are <br/>
willing to give your kids, sending in the composite score.  <br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion I have put out for those who want something <br/>
concrete to send their supers (why, I don&#39;t know), would be to do the <br/>
detailed outline that some more conservative groups tell their <br/>
members they should do each year, to send in with their notification <br/>
letter to satisfy the &quot;outline&quot; requested in the state regs.  One <br/>
could do this as a kind of end-of-year transcript for each year of <br/>
homeschooling. If you don&#39;t mind doing that there are plenty of <br/>
sources that can provide templates for this type of transcript. And <br/>
you will then be in the habit of keeping a transcript which will help <br/>
for college entrance later, specifically for the high school years.  <br/>
I personally do not want to give the super this kind of detail, but <br/>
others are doing this annually, and unnecessarily, anyway.  If you&#39;re <br/>
going to do it why not do it at the end of the year to satisfy your <br/>
assessment, instead of doing it at the beginning of the year.  The <br/>
state itself puts out detailed standards guide booklets on &quot;What Is <br/>
Expected in Grade _____&quot; that could be used for this purpose.<br/>
<br/>
With three relatively simple options, depending on what you prefer, I <br/>
hope that others will at least try Option #3.  It&#39;s been on the books <br/>
for more than 13 years now, but I was the first to try it and found <br/>
that my superintendent, who is not really homeschool friendly, did <br/>
not even blink, approved it right away.  And has continued to approve <br/>
it ever since, for six years now.  As I said before, so far everyone <br/>
who has tried it has been approved.  Seems to me it&#39;s a win/win <br/>
situation to at least try this option first.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Besides, I don&#39;t have pictures of my superintendent&#39;s family.  Why <br/>
<br/>
should he get pictures of mine?  If he invites me to his home and <br/>
<br/>
introduces me to his family, then maybe I&#39;ll be more open to sharing <br/>
<br/>
more personal info with him.  But for now, if chicken bones can <br/>
<br/>
satisfy the letter of the law, that&#39;s better than personal info imo.  <br/>

pictures of the inside of your house.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d be willing to put it on a page linked to Carol&#39;s &quot;unschooling curriculum&quot; <br/>
if you want.  Send me something (here or on the side) with the details you <br/>
think people might need and I&#39;d be glad to give it a web home with an easy URL.<br/>
<br/>
(Good idea, Mary.  Thanks.)<br/>

Does that mean it wasn&#39;t a great idea? <br/>

Aw gee. :-( &lt;shuffle, shuffle, kicking at the ground&gt;<br/>
