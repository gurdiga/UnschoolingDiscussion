<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533130624">I cut an pasted this whole message from the digest, as<br/>
I wanted everyone to take another look at it.  I just<br/>
have one thing to say about it.  BRAVO!<br/>
Nanci K.<br/>
******************************************************<br/>
I think we need to realize, though, that the people<br/>
doing these studies have a different opinion about<br/>
what kind of &quot;achievement&quot; is important, and what kind<br/>
of &quot;coping skills&quot; are best.  I do not agree that<br/>
achievement is important, nor that the typical coping<br/>
skills are necessarily healthy (and I have been<br/>
trained as a psychological counselor).  Therefore, I<br/>
cannot look to these studies to tell me what is best<br/>
for my child, because the parameters of the study will<br/>
<br/>
only give the researches the answer to the questions<br/>
they asked....and I believe they are asking the wrong<br/>
questions, therefore getting the wrong answers.  <br/>
<br/>
Authoritarian parenting is not good, we agree on that.<br/>
 But I don&#39;t believe authoritative is any better.  I<br/>
believe there is a kind of parenting that is not<br/>
measured by any study, and has yet to be  labeled<br/>
because so few parents use it, and so few researchers<br/>
understand it.  I personally would call it &quot;intuitive<br/>
parenting&quot;.  All the other labels...authoritarian,<br/>
permissive, etc....focus on the parents disciplinary<br/>
style.  But I don&#39;t believe you have to focus on that.<br/>
 That&#39;s focusing on externals....behavior.  I believe<br/>
we need to focus <br/>
on what&#39;s inside....thoughts, feelings, and<br/>
perceptions, which is what makes people behave the way<br/>
they do.  I don&#39;t think the studies focus on that type<br/>
of parenting, and therefore I personally don&#39;t put<br/>
much faith in those traditional, mainstream type of<br/>
studies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644218852">I agree with Judie, what are we all afraid of? <br/>
Intelligent discourse is stimulating, and being<br/>
passionate about your beliefs and ideas is wonderful. <br/>
I don&#39;t begrude anyone their ideas, and why can&#39;t we<br/>
share them with each other without being threatened<br/>
and running to hide about it?  I am not threatented by<br/>
differences.  I grew up in the heart of San Francisco,<br/>
and it is impossible to grow up there and not become<br/>
respectful of different beliefs and lifestyles.  Well,<br/>
not impossible I&#39;m sure, but not easy either.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As to a child going to sleep when they are tired,<br/>
&gt;that is not a given ........That happens in some<br/>
&gt;children and in a perfect world .......And quite a<br/>
&gt;few that get so tired that they can make themselves <br/>
&gt;physically ill.  Sometimes it is a positive thing for<br/>
&gt;someone to be looking out for the well-being of<br/>
&gt;another.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with this, I think it was Lynda who said it. <br/>
As the parent of a child with very little impulse<br/>
control I completely understand the need to look out<br/>
for his best interests.  We also have a bedtime<br/>
because, like Judie, I need quiet time in the evenings<br/>
to myself, because I am important too.  The boys are<br/>
allowed to play quietly as long as they like in their<br/>
rooms.  My kids also say please, thank you, AND you&#39;re<br/>
welcome naturally, because we model it.<br/>
<br/>
As a person who suffers myself from poor self<br/>
discipline, I sometimes am grateful to my husband for<br/>
gently insisting that I need to go to bed, because I<br/>
DO get sick when I stay up too long.  He also reminds<br/>
me when I need to eat, as being hypoglycemic I<br/>
sometimes get real busy with the kids or other things<br/>
and &quot;forget&quot; to eat.  When my blood sugar is real low<br/>
I am not thinking too clearly or level headedly.  I<br/>
appreciate having him look out for me.  I never had<br/>
that before in my life, and it sure feels nice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Someone said<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;And, children do not &quot;naturally&quot; use phrases such as &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank<br/>
&gt; you.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra replied<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Mine do, because all the adults around them do.  Mine share, because we share<br/>
&gt; with them--clothes, money, time, toys--when I&#39;ve had a toy or game or<br/>
&gt; curiosity or tool I thought my kids might break, I kept it up or hidden until<br/>
&gt; they were old enough to use it, and when they were older I brought it down<br/>
&gt; and shared.  I share the computer.  I share the phone.  Not just with my<br/>
&gt; kids, for show, but with anyone--friends, houseguests--who&#39;s over and needs<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A friend of mine told me once that she knocked on the doors to her<br/>
children&#39;s rooms every time she wanted to go in, paused for a moment for<br/>
them to say &quot;come in&quot;, and then entered. She felt it was respectful of their<br/>
privacy.<br/>
<br/>
She started this when they were about a day old, though of course they<br/>
didn&#39;t say &quot;come in&quot; at that point, she would pause and then enter just as<br/>
if they had.<br/>
<br/>
Not surprisingly, by the time the children could crawl, they would all on<br/>
their own knock on their mother&#39;s door and wait for her to say, &quot;come in&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Children, for good or ill, do what they see the adults around them doing. If<br/>
they have choices, they choose to emulate the adults who treat them with<br/>
respect, kindness and courtesy, rather than those who don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s always good news and bad news with this sort of thing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
