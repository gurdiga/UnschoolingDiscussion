<div id="ygrps-yiv-869508168">I have sniffliness.  Not a full-blown cold, just itchy eyes and sneezing and <br/>
headache.  I never touched that pool.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty has a cold, since Sunday night, but no ear infections because ne never <br/>
gets ear infections.  We talked about how people get what they get, when their <br/>
system is down for whatever reasons and lots of factors make &quot;down,&quot; like <br/>
lack of sleep, not eating well, not resting.  Me, I get fever blisters and <br/>
sometimes sore throats, when I&#39;m &quot;down&quot; with other factors.   <br/>
<br/>
There was a lot of not sleeping, not resting, not eating well going on at the <br/>
conference!  I asked Marty to explain it in gamer terms that some of the kids <br/>
would understand and so here it is--pass it on to your gamer kids.<br/>
<br/>
The D&D theory (detailed by Marty) about lack of sleep and getting sick:<br/>
<br/>
Something can give you a cold.  An enemy.<br/>
When your character has a cold, it can&#39;t heal health points.<br/>
You can make a DC check of whatever the cold is (germs) vs. your fortitude.<br/>
Sleeping adds plus five to your roll.<br/>
Not sleeping adds plus five to the DC.<br/>
<br/>
Medicine adds plus two to your fortitude for like six hours or whatever.  <br/>
(He used &quot;DayQuill.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
The pool could be a place like a marsh that carries the disease.<br/>
<br/>
Those who slept who could make the save roll easier than those who didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
So maybe the pool was providing germs, but maybe those who were well-fed and <br/>
well-rested wouldn&#39;t have gotten sick.<br/>
