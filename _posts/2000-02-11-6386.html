Subject: The Wife<br/>
<br/>
One afternoon a man came home from work to find total mayhem in his<br/>
house.<br/>
His three children were outside, still in their pajamas, playing in the<br/>
mud, with empty food boxes and wrappers strewn all around the front yard.<br/>
<br/>
The door of his wife&#39;s car was open, as was the front door to the house. <br/>
Proceeding into the entry, he found an even bigger mess.  A lamp had been<br/>
 knocked over, and the throw rug was wadded against one wall.  In the<br/>
front room the TV was loudly blaring a cartoon channel, and the family<br/>
room was strewn with toys and various items of clothing.  In the kitchen,<br/>
dishes filled the sink, breakfast food was spilled on the counter, dog<br/>
food was spilled on the floor, a broken glass lay under the table,  and a<br/>
 small pile of sand was spread by the back door.<br/>
<br/>
He quickly headed up the stairs, stepping over toys and more piles of<br/>
clothes, looking for his wife. He was worried she may be ill, or that<br/>
something serious had happened.  He found her lounging in the bedroom,<br/>
still curled in the bed in her pajamas, reading a novel.  She looked up<br/>
at him, smiled, and asked how his day went.<br/>
<br/>
He looked at her bewildered and asked, &quot;What happened here today?&quot;  She<br/>
again smiled and answered, &quot;You know every day when you come home from<br/>
work and ask me what in the world did I do today?&quot;<br/>
Yes&quot; was his incredulous reply.   She answered, &quot;Well, today I didn&#39;t do<br/>
it.&quot;<br/>
