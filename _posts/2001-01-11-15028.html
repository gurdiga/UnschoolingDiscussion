<div id="ygrps-yiv-543292391">I&#39;m writing this to contribute to several topics: <br/>
older kids +  classes/community programs + giftedness   <br/>
<br/>
    I tend to think of the differences in my kids as different motivations.  <br/>
What motivates this person? My oldest is artistically and dramatically <br/>
motivated. She spent a lot of her childhood playing Barbies, reading fiction <br/>
and fairy tales, watching TV and drawing. She did some creative drama classes <br/>
when she was little. The teacher worked with folk tales and mythology and the <br/>
kids created their own stories and acted them out. Then for a while she took <br/>
visual art classes. When she was 12yo I strongly encouraged her to take <br/>
another drama class as I felt she was avoiding it out of insecurity. It went <br/>
well. When she was a teenager she went to an unschool/highschool and did <br/>
improv drama there and then did two summers of a <br/>
Shakespeare in Santa Fe internship. Now at age 20 she is studying at City <br/>
College of San Francisco. She is a &quot;classic&quot; unschooler in that she did only <br/>
what she was interested in while growing up and very little of it looked like <br/>
school. This coming semester she is planning to take an English class which <br/>
will be her first experience with an academic class. When she took the <br/>
placement tests for her school (her first tests ever) she placed into College <br/>
English. When she tried taking it she realized she had been tested on her <br/>
reading ability only and felt the writing aspect of the class would be too <br/>
hard. She had no problem dropping the class and waiting for this semester to <br/>
take the one before it. I see her being very comfortable with who she is.   <br/>
She has never become motivated to learn Math or Science and for the kind of <br/>
schooling she wants from an acting conservatory, it&#39;s irrelevant. She does <br/>
have a checking account that she is managing. She&#39;s doing it her own way and <br/>
I&#39;m crossing my fingers she doesn&#39;t overdraw the account but so far so good. <br/>
She just received her first order of checks with flower fairies on them:&gt;)<br/>
    As to the question of outside activities, classes etc., with younger <br/>
children I always made sure the activities were developmentally appropriate <br/>
(e.g. space for imagination), run by kind, nonintrusive people and not very <br/>
competitive, for example the drama classes I mentioned above for my oldest. <br/>
    My second one is physically and musically motivated. He took creative <br/>
dance at age 4, &quot;played&quot; basketball at a Boys and Girls club at age 5 and <br/>
then again later at a community center. I&#39;ll never forget that little long <br/>
haired boy running up and down the basketball court completely and happily <br/>
absorbed in his fantasy of playing basketball, not at all connected to what <br/>
the other kids (who were a bit older) were doing. Later he played T-Ball at a <br/>
YMCA. Then at around 7 or 8 my sister got him into judo. We refused to let <br/>
him compete until we felt he was ready. Competition was not built into the <br/>
class but my sister was eager for him to do it. Then when he did compete he <br/>
did quite well.<br/>
     When he was ten and we moved to Santa Fe and met our spiritual Teacher <br/>
his musical gift &quot;kicked in.&quot; He learned the flute and played for a while in <br/>
a homeschool band, then later in a kids original jazz/rock band. Meanwhile he <br/>
also started to learn to play tabla, the Hindu temple drums. <br/>
    Since age 12 he has become very spiritually motivated as well as <br/>
continuing with music. Now, at age 15, he only plays devotional music and is <br/>
working in a restaurant to be able to travel with Amma (our Teacher) this <br/>
summer. He is also working on a high school diploma through a charter school <br/>
by taking science and computer classes at a community college and doing <br/>
humanities and Math at home. He&#39;s doing all this so he can get a well paying <br/>
job so he can afford to be with Amma as much as possible. He&#39;s also really <br/>
into watching professional sports, playing sports video games and keeping <br/>
track of all the statistics etc.<br/>
    I can&#39;t emphasize enough how vital to unschooling I consider free choice <br/>
to be.  To me it is much more important than how it looks on the outside or <br/>
what kind of classes they take. My 20yo has recently chosen to take a second <br/>
class from a drama teacher who spent way too much time yelling at the <br/>
students last semester. She feels that nonetheless she can learn from this <br/>
person and doesn&#39;t take it personally. She went through quite a process with <br/>
this class and ended up doing well in it. This never would have worked when <br/>
she was a child! My kids make their choices through introspection and through <br/>
dialogue with me. I would not be having my son do this high school rigmarole <br/>
if it was up to me but he feels strongly guided to do it. I am supporting him <br/>
in that choice and I see him growing from it. He is not inherently <br/>
academically motivated so it&#39;s challenging for both of us at times.<br/>
    My youngest. age 11, is motivated to acquire knowledge. She reads <br/>
voraciously and voluntarily works with her Oak Meadow curriculum even when it <br/>
annoys her. She&#39;s studying US History and Environmental Science and says she <br/>
wants to be both a writer and a marine biologist when she grows up. She also <br/>
takes a couple of classes with a Christian homeSchooling group. (Again not <br/>
what I would choose.) She&#39;s taking an Anatomy class there and a writing class <br/>
(which I&#39;m helping &quot;teach&quot; !!??) I must say the Anatomy class is way better <br/>
than anything one would find in a public school. She also takes African dance <br/>
at a nearby Performing Arts center and loves to swim. She wants to try out <br/>
for a swim team. Although her interests are the most &quot;school&quot; like I can&#39;t <br/>
picture her in school. She is VERY independent and self directed. <br/>
    My goal has been to raise my children &quot;to be who they are.&quot; I feel that <br/>
we are succeeding. There were points along the way where I seriously <br/>
questioned what I was doing as it often looked so messy. Now I see each on <br/>
one emerging as a unique, autonomous person and I am truly amazed. The most <br/>
validating experience I have had was that when my husband and I found our <br/>
spiritual Teacher in 1995, each child freely chose the same for her/his self. <br/>
This is not something one can &quot;make&quot; happen so I feel deeply blessed that we <br/>
can share this as a family.<br/>
