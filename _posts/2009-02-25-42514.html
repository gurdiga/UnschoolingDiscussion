<div id="ygrps-yiv-785138985">We are not new to unschooling and my DH used to be supportive of <br/>
unschooling.  He&#39;s changed his mind and has the kids enrolled in a <br/>
homeschool curriculum program.  When I talked to him about it, he <br/>
said he didn&#39;t think our family was doing well with unschooling.  I <br/>
was working outside the home for 5 months which gave him lots of time <br/>
with the kids.  He discovered little gaps here and there that <br/>
surprised him.  Also, he felt like successful unschoolers have many <br/>
different interests.  He said we didn&#39;t strew enough to expose them <br/>
to different ideas and the kids didn&#39;t seem much interested in the <br/>
things we were showing them anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is a backward step or a permanent change.  What <br/>
can I do to keep the peace in the family when I want our kids to be <br/>
radical unschoolers and my husband believes in some formal learning?<br/>
<br/>
I think the major attitude change is mostly due to him watching our <br/>
oldest daughter, Claire (16), struggle with whether or not to finish <br/>
high school.  He seems to be suddenly worried about our 2 kids and <br/>
high school.<br/>

His concern stems from watching her struggle with whether or not to <br/>
finish high school? But, you were unschooling? So how does &quot;finish high <br/>
school&quot; enter into that?<br/>

I understood, I thought, up to that point.<br/>
<br/>
Were you planning to unschool until high school?  Was Claire  <br/>
unschooled too?<br/>
<br/>
When spouses have different opinions, unschool&#39;s pretty likely to lose  <br/>
out.  That&#39;s why I like the analogy to owning a yacht.  Some people  <br/>
can even build a yacht, but in no case is a casual decision to have  <br/>
one, nor can if be done by one spouse with the other.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is such a big deal that it doesn&#39;t make sense to ask what  <br/>
will happen if one wants to and the other doesn&#39;t.  If I wrote &quot;I  <br/>
would like for our family to live in Japan, but Keith thinks we should  <br/>
stay in our own house in the U.S.&quot;<br/>
What could the advice possibly be?  I cannot have an unschooling  <br/>
family if the father says not, or won&#39;t go with it.<br/>

Okay.  But because people join the list all the time, and because some  <br/>
people don&#39;t even try to keep track of stories told months ago, it&#39;s  <br/>
worth people clarifying.   Someone joins every day, and everything  <br/>
they see is new to them.  If someone takes from that something about  <br/>
unschoolers needing to worry about finishing high school, it&#39;s good to  <br/>
have it clarified.<br/>

<br/>
I think your husband is right.  Successful unschoolers have many  <br/>
different interests.  If you haven&#39;t found ways to find interesting  <br/>
things and present them in interesting ways, unschooling won&#39;t work yet.<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;enrolled&quot; do you mean he bought school in a box?  A curriculum?   <br/>
Or signed them up with an online deal and paid for a year?  What?<br/>
<br/>
It might not be a backward step if it causes the two of you to see  <br/>
that unschooling needs to be more than just being there.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe show him these pages (and review them yourself) and then if the  <br/>
homeschooling isn&#39;t going well he might be more confident that the two  <br/>
of you can make unschooling really strong and vibrant.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sandra, can you please talk about this some more?  i imagine this must look very different depending on the kid...how does one &quot;measure&quot; &quot;work&quot; and &quot;many different interests&quot; and &quot;successful&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
are you saying over the course of their unschooling experience, they have many different interests? some all at once, and some sequentially?  because if so, that makes  sense to me - and it seems to me that some kids spend oodles of time focusing in on one interest for months (or years) and then move on to the next one, while others are more generalists and dabblers....<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on how you think this dad is right - and how you&#39;d evaluate whether any given unschooler has a sufficient number of interests/whether it is &quot;working.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
i am really not trying to be antagonistic, so i hope this doens&#39;t come off that way - i just find myself vacillating between feeling confident that my son, in particular, has evolving interests and is thriving with unschooling, even if he looks moderately &quot;inactive&quot; from the outside, and worrying at moments that i am somehow not &quot;finding ways to find interesting things and present them in interesting ways&quot; even though for the most part i really think i am....so i&#39;d love to hear more!<br/>
<br/>
warmly, Lyla<br/>

So he really wants her to &quot;finish&quot; and she signed up for some <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry, that did sound confusing.  Claire is my oldest dd from my <br/>
previous marriage.  She&#39;s been living with us for 2 years now.  Her <br/>
dad and stepmom are both teachers and have taught her that formal <br/>
school is very important.  She went to public high school the first 2 <br/>
years she lived with us but chose to stay home this year, which would <br/>
be her junior year.  She chose to enroll in a high school <br/>
correspondence program because her dad was already freaked out that <br/>
she was quitting high school.  But she hasn&#39;t really been working on <br/>
the high school stuff.  She hates it.  My husband, her stepdad, <br/>
thinks she is so close to finishing her high school diploma that she <br/>
should just buckle down and do it.  I posted about this whole dilemma <br/>
recently.  She was just about to take a break from all thoughts of <br/>
school when she came down with Mono last week.  So now she really <br/>
does have an excuse as to why she isn&#39;t even thinking about school <br/>
and her dad isn&#39;t bugging her about school.  <br/>
<br/>
Martin and I have homeschooled our 2 children, Jeffrey and Allison, <br/>
for 7 years now.  We&#39;ve used curriculum in the past but I always went <br/>
back to unschooling.  Martin read the unschooling books with me and <br/>
still believes it&#39;s a great lifestyle.  But he&#39;s gotten stuck in that <br/>
old belief that there are some things that need formal structure, <br/>
like mathematics.  He&#39;s not 100% into the curriculum.  I mean, he&#39;s <br/>
not wanting them to do every page.  He is hoping some of the topics <br/>
will spark their interest in academic subjects.  And he&#39;s thinking <br/>
that it would be good if they earned an accredited high school <br/>
diploma.  That&#39;s why I think this was all brought on by Claire&#39;s high <br/>
school dilemma.  I think he&#39;s had a sudden panic that the kids won&#39;t <br/>
really be prepared for life outside our home without formal <br/>
education.  <br/>

That&#39;s not at all how unschooling works, though.  FORGET academic  <br/>

you move from schoolish expectations to unschooling?<br/>

You and your husband should be into video games and music then, too.   <br/>
Be where they are.  KNOW what they like and are learning, not by  <br/>
asking them, but by reading about and listening to the music they  <br/>
like.  Buy or rent DVDs of the groups they like--concert videos or  <br/>
documentaries.   Go toward them, but not away from them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They like other things but those are the major interests in their<br/>

<br/>
HUNDREDS.  They should be busy in dozens of directions, in little  <br/>
ways, whether it&#39;s an inch or a moment, or a mile and a year.  &quot;Music&quot;  <br/>
is not monolithic.  If someone is interested in music, that can be  <br/>
broken down into a thousand elements.   Is your son interested in one  <br/>
single video game?   If so, find out more about it.  If not, don&#39;t  <br/>
call it &quot;video games&quot; as though it were an element without lots of  <br/>
depth and breadth, history and future.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/checklist">http://sandradodd.com/checklist</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858371615">Sorry, I lost the original e-mail to this one.  I&#39;m answering on the site, but that doesn&#39;t <br/>
always work out so well for me.<br/>
<br/>
I had written:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Successful unschoolers have many <br/>
&gt; different interests. If you haven&#39;t found ways to find interesting <br/>
&gt; things and present them in interesting ways, unschooling won&#39;t work yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And was asked:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sandra, can you please talk about this some more?  i imagine this must look very <br/>
 </span></blockquote>different depending on the kid...how does one &quot;measure&quot; &quot;work&quot; and &quot;many different <br/>
interests&quot; and &quot;successful&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
The way I measure it is whether the mom has written something I put on this page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/gettingit">http://sandradodd.com/gettingit</a><br/>
or whether she&#39;s asking the same questions again and again while ANY ideas like neglect <br/>
or curriculum or relatives are angry or husband is thinking of leaving or my kids just <br/>
aren&#39;t learning or any of those telltale phrases that show that unschooling hasn&#39;t yet taken <br/>
root so strongly that the family isn&#39;t living it.<br/>
<br/>
There are ways to move more toward confidence and flow, but the moving doesn&#39;t happen <br/>
on this list.  It happens in the home, and in the mind and heart of one of the parents who <br/>
can persuade the other, or whose children&#39;s joy and learning persuade everyone around <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
The statement was about &quot;successful unschoolers.&quot;   I was saying yes, if her husband said <br/>
successful unschoolers have many different interests, that&#39;s true.  What I didn&#39;t say <br/>
(because I keep thinking some of these things are understood or obvious, I guess) is that <br/>
the PARENTS need many different interests first. If the mom vacuums and cleans and the <br/>
dad watches tv and sleeps, they should put their kids in school.  Not enough interests to <br/>
sustain unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&gt; i&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on how you think this dad is right - and how you&#39;d <br/>
evaluate whether any given unschooler has a sufficient number of interests/whether it is <br/>
&quot;working.&quot;  -=-<br/>
<br/>
The mother has come and told us it isn&#39;t working.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; this exposure to the core sujects will inspire them to want to<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the tentpoles of unschooling is that normal humans do learn all the <br/>
time. It is an automatic and unstoppable process that happens from being <br/>
alive.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it would help both of you to see the learning that IS happening if <br/>
you started actively looking for it - not necessarily in terms of school <br/>
subjects but more broadly. Every activity usually has so much learning in it <br/>
that it could be categorized into several or many subjects (as those people <br/>
unfortunate enough to live in a state with that kind of reporting find at <br/>
evaluation time when they have to brush the dust off their educationese).<br/>
<br/>
What negative ideas are they likely to be learning from a parent dismissing <br/>
their interests as without oportunity for learning?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Core subjects&quot; are pointless outside of a context. The core of what? He is <br/>
thinking schooling, but what is the core of a full and happy life?<br/>
<br/>
My focus with Jayn continues to be helping her DO what she wants to do. <br/>
Learning, basic (what schools call basic) skills and advanced skills too, <br/>
&quot;core subjects&quot; follow - really come after the action of DOING her stuff - <br/>
playing games, making things, drawing, researching on the internet, starting <br/>
a business, writing a book, planning a party, cooking for her friends. And <br/>
she spends a very large portion of every day playing computer games and the <br/>
Wii, both by herself and with me.<br/>

Can you afford to just drop that one and do something different that <br/>

<br/>
I think you two should agree on something - if he&#39;s not going to be <br/>
convinced about unschooling, then you&#39;ll have to choose some sort of <br/>
gentle program. They&#39;re out there. Maybe you could get the &quot;What Your <br/>
X-Grader Needs to Know&quot; and read a little of that together each day, for <br/>
example. That&#39;s pretty painless. Or have a look at Oak Meadow materials. <br/>
I mean, this isn&#39;t the list for recommending curriculum materials, but <br/>
it is better to compromise and find something you can be okay with, <br/>
maybe even enjoy a bit, rather than having such conflict with your own <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to say something that has comforted many dads. Don&#39;t let it <br/>
scare you &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Kids will pick up arithmetic as they go about living their lives <br/>
(arithmetic is everywhere) - they might have a few gaps, they might not <br/>
learn formal notation, but what they don&#39;t learn naturally is very easy <br/>
to &quot;fill in&quot; if they have a need.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  However, people do not pick up higher math (algebra and above) that <br/>
way. Let&#39;s be honest about that, because if we&#39;re not, our credibility <br/>
is shot.<br/>
<br/>
There are several points that need to be made about higher math, though:<br/>
<br/>
First, not everybody needs to know very much about algebra, <br/>
trigonometry, or calculus or even formal geometry. And certainly kids <br/>
don&#39;t need to know it just for the sake of knowing it. The rationales <br/>
offered for making everyone take algebra are that it is the &quot;language of <br/>
science&quot; and that it develops thinking skills. Both are bogus reasons. <br/>
Yes, algebra is used BY many scientists, but it isn&#39;t the language that <br/>
is used to explain that science to the rest of us. If they decide to go <br/>
into science, they&#39;ll need some algebra. There is<br/>
<br/>
However, algebra is currently a &quot;gateway&quot; course - the filter that keeps <br/>
some people from getting into or through college and makes college <br/>
degrees more scarce and therefore more valuable. So, if college ends up <br/>
being on the path a person wants to follow, formal algebra is probably <br/>
going to be required (not absolutely always, but usually).<br/>
<br/>
If and when that time for algebra arrives, it is very possible for a <br/>
person to go over all the arithmetic needed and fill in the gaps and <br/>
learn the notation. There are lots of ways to do that - anything from <br/>
using a textbook, an online program, a tutor, a video course, a tutor, a <br/>
classroom course, and more. It could take a few weeks or a few months or <br/>
even a year, depending on how much time the person puts into it. And, <br/>
then, they can learn algebra in any of the same ways.<br/>
<br/>
My three daughters did no formal math at all until they were in college. <br/>
They started at community college, which has no entrance requirements. <br/>
They had options - they could take a placement test and start the math <br/>
sequence where the test placed them or they could start the math <br/>
sequence at the beginning. I recommended they do a little studying on <br/>
their own and take the placement test so that they could skip some of <br/>
the courses, but they each opted to start the sequence at the beginning, <br/>
because they felt uncomfortable about all the formal notation. The <br/>
oldest finished the sequence with Algebra 2 and then probability and <br/>
statistics. She went on to get a bachelors degree and took a couple more <br/>
statistics/research methods courses including being invited to take a <br/>
graduate-level course when she was still a college senior. She got A&#39;s <br/>
in all math courses, by the way.  My second daughter followed the same <br/>
route and finished algebra 2 and is now taking statistics. Daughter <br/>
number 3 is in the course right before algebra, right now.<br/>
<br/>
The people in these math classes with my daughters have almost all gone <br/>
to school and taken (suffered through) years and years of math <br/>
instruction. My kids never suffered through one minute of it and there <br/>
they are in the same classes getting among the highest grades in the <br/>
course, no less.<br/>

I loved math in school but now that I&#39;m far away from it I see how  <br/>
really bogus it was in terms of actually understanding mathematical  <br/>
concepts. (I still like the solving puzzles aspect of it. But I  <br/>
didn&#39;t develop an understanding of math from doing that.)<br/>
<br/>
Learning math by using it is amazingly easy. Learning it from  <br/>
abstract symbols divorced from what it&#39;s describing is very very hard  <br/>
and why it takes so many years and why so many fail at it. It  <br/>
unnatural and ineffective.<br/>
<br/>
Claire was *in* school for most of her life and is struggling? So all  <br/>
those years didn&#39;t help. 2 years of unschooling won&#39;t undo that  <br/>
damage. It took me several years to get past the damage of school  <br/>
history. Even though I knew I loved learning about the past from  <br/>
movies and  historical novels, it took ages for that dull feeling of  <br/>
memorizing politicians and policies and dates to really leave my  <br/>
system. It&#39;s not reasonable to expect 2 years of unschooling to undo  <br/>
the damage done to interests she may not even be passionate about.<br/>
<br/>
Kat spent 2 months in second grade, had a few other minutes of  <br/>
curriculum, did a computer math program for fun with her dad. That  <br/>
was it for what would resemble school math. At 14 she took his  <br/>
college statistics class. She was always at the top of the class in  <br/>
homework (which she could ask for his help on) and tests (where she  <br/>
couldn&#39;t). (He also said she showed no signs of having done the math  <br/>
program. It didn&#39;t translate beyond the questions of the program.)  <br/>
Performing well with schooled kids in a math class is not typical of  <br/>
all unschooled kids, but I&#39;d say it&#39;s perfectly typical of kids who  <br/>
are doing what they enjoy and enjoying what they&#39;re doing. (She finds  <br/>
math interesting, but her passion is art and writing, so she didn&#39;t  <br/>
do well because she&#39;s a &quot;math head&quot;.)<br/>

I think it&#39;s better to even send kids to school rather than having  <br/>
such conflict with your husband.  School wouldn&#39;t last long, with such  <br/>

I&#39;ve totally let go of the traditional educational path and don&#39;t see <br/>

curriculum with them in a year.  It is true that I had doubts before <br/>
that which had me yo-yo&#39;ing between curriculum and unschooling but I <br/>
finally got past it.  I thought my husband was with with me in <br/>
understanding but apparently not.  He decided he didn&#39;t see <br/>
unschooling working because he&#39;s still viewing their learning through <br/>
schoolish glasses.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a difficult time working with the curriculum.  It is so <br/>
stupid!  He and I will be reading through the links Sandra gave to us <br/>
later today when he&#39;s off work.  If he can read through them and <br/>
still feel like the curriculum is a good idea then I&#39;ll find a <br/>
compromise somehow.  I know we can&#39;t be radical unschoolers if both <br/>

i have to second this based on a recent experience.  my daughter always struggled in math, until she &quot;home schooled&quot; for 4 months in 6th grade and then went to a private school, where she took algebra.  she ended up getting the highest score in her algebra class, much to her amazement...BUT - she is unschooling now and desires to take some college classes:  i took her to do the placement tests there, and she placed into basic calculations.  part of it is because the test is dynamic so she never *got* to the algebra part because she got stuck on something we probably never covered in her 4 months of  &quot;school at home&quot; - inverse exponents.  but, from the little prep she wanted to do for the test, it didn&#39;t really seem like she remembered much algebra either - even though that highest score in the class was just last year!!<br/>

I did very well in stats & prob in my last year (at age 43) and got<br/>
top grades.  I thought it was very interesting.  I am most definitely<br/>
don&#39;t by *any* stretch of the imagination have a &quot;math head.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I avoided any math for years (I was in college off and on for 15<br/>
years) because I had such phobias about it from public school math...<br/>
all the drilling and massive amounts of homework--ugh only to fail<br/>
some of the tests or barely squeak through with Cs and Ds.<br/>
<br/>
It really does take a long time to rid oneself of math angst and phobias.<br/>

One of the biggest realizations for me, by the time I was 30 something<br/>

Just wanted to mention that it wasn&#39;t just math.  It was any kind of<br/>
analysis.  Literature was easy for me by the time I went to college. I<br/>
started college at 27.<br/>
<br/>
Before that I had gotten an associate degree in something I barely had<br/>

in the field for some time it had no way for me to advance.  Which is<br/>
the reason I thought I should just go back to college and do what I<br/>
really love-- art.  Now I don&#39;t think I should have gone to college<br/>
for art (though I enjoyed it immensely) because I could have simply<br/>
made art and started showing it.  All I really needed (had I only<br/>
known) is a mentor... being around other artists.<br/>
