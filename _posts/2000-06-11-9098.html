<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330431494">Dia, I am coming along sooooo slowly in Irish compared to my 13 yo son! I <br/>
wish I had taken it when I was younger! How are you doing your language <br/>
study? I go to an A.O.H.(Ancient Order of Hibernians) and the lessons start <br/>
with phonetics and move on to grammar and conversations. I have been going <br/>
forever and all I can say is hi and I am fine! LOL!<br/>

www.minet.ca/~donaldm/ .  He is a Scots Gaelic speaker, but I believe there<br/>
is some information on Irish Gaelic there also.<br/>
