&gt; process.  It can not test how well he knows literature, or if he<br/>
&gt; understands the internal combustion engine well enough to fix it, or how<br/>
&gt; well he can play the piano, or how good he is at building furniture, or<br/>
&gt; whether he understands the concepts that rule our physical universe.  My<br/>
&gt; dh and I both score really well on IQ tests (usually in the MENSA level).<br/>

it has given Julian and us important information. For Julian, it&#39;s objective <br/>
information that he really is a smart kid. For us, it&#39;s finding out that <br/>
Julian, for whatever reason (he doesn&#39;t know), believed that he wasn&#39;t. Other <br/>

in continuing to help him deal with the other stuff...not a lot has changed.<br/>

said he was a little scared by the results.  I just think he should <br/>
understand that it is not that big a deal if he was frightened by it. <br/>
