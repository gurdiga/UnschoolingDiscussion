<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437208041">Beanie Babies have been given quite a workout at our house too!  My son <br/>
especially uses them in all kinds of imaginary play.  When we took our <br/>
round the country trip last year, piggy was in quite a few photos and even <br/>
had photos just of him in places like Multnomah Falls and Banff.  I <br/>
absolutely love your kids&#39; campground idea.  Now, there&#39;s geography for <br/>
you!<br/>
<br/>
My son has also gotten his money&#39;s worth from Brio which we have quite a <br/>
collection of due to gifts from grandparents.  At 9 he&#39;s still adding to <br/>
it.  Ooh, that goes for Playmobil too.  My daughter (11) has gotten a lot <br/>
of mileage from a wooden treehouse and adorable little natural accessories. <br/>
 We gave her the tree house at age 2 and the collection of doll house stuff <br/>
has grown a lot over the years.  She makes all kinds of things for it and <br/>
plays with it a lot.  She shows no signs of growing out of it either. It <br/>
will definitely be a hand me down toy and if by chance we have no <br/>
grandchildren I would love to keep it as a decoration.  However, I doubt <br/>
she&#39;ll leave it behind she loves it so much.<br/>

We&#39;ve gotten a lot of mileage out of beanie babies too.  Two of the kids<br/>
favorites have gone almost everywhere with us for the last three years.<br/>
They&#39;ve been buried in dirt piles, gone swimming at the beach, been stirred<br/>
into flour water goop the kids were cooking with, fallen from great <br/>
heights,<br/>
and washed a million times.  They are still going strong.  We definitely <br/>
got<br/>
our money&#39;s worth out of those toys when you consider the hours played <br/>
with.<br/>
The Breyers are more expensive but when you consider the hours they are<br/>
played with the hourly rate is still low.  I love looking at it that way.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny but the other day as I was printing out the 10th campground map<br/>
each for the kids I had a flashing thought that we were wasting paper.  But<br/>
they played with those twenty sheets of paper for almost two days straight.<br/>
They picked campgrounds from all over the country, we printed the <br/>
campground<br/>
site maps, then they wrote in the names of each of the animals that were<br/>
staying at those campsites.  They planned the route they would take to stay<br/>
at different camp sites all over the country so they could start in ME, go<br/>
to the west coast, and camp their way back to ME.  Pretty cool when you<br/>
think about it.<br/>
