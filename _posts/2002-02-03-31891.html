<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571244932">Okay folks we have a choice,<br/>
<br/>
We can end this talk right now. Nobody replies to this email and the <br/>
person who suggested we don&#39;t discuss discussion (metatalk) can sit back <br/>
and relax knowing that she made a great contribution<br/>
<br/>
OR<br/>
<br/>
We can keep watching people drop like flies, the emails dwindle to little <br/>
input and the reputation of what once was a highly recommended list turn <br/>
to less than desireable.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our choice, we&#39;re in this together.<br/>
