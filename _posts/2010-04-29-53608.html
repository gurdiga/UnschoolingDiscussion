Holly had a little spelling toy from Radio Shack.  You start typing in  <br/>
the word and it guesses, or you type it in however and it gives you  <br/>
suggestions for better spellings.<br/>
<br/>
That was a long time ago, though.  There are computer programs and  <br/>
parts of programs that will do that.<br/>

Or you could suggest something else for her to do than write.  Or you  <br/>

  yes, is she frustrated with the spelling or are you?   i always loved reading my kids&#39; creative spelling...but now that my son is a pretty good speller, he wants everything  spelled correctly so asks me even if he&#39;s pretty sure.<br/>

Before he stared writing, I just wrote everything down for him as he dictated it, and that was enough.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s asked me to spell things as he&#39;s writing, and if he didn&#39;t want me to spell as he wrote, either I would write that one word for him in his comic (or whatever he was working on), or I&#39;d write in on a separate piece of paper, and he&#39;d copy it.<br/>

<br/>
I have two kids that like to write, and I remember that stage with my<br/>
younger daughter who&#39;s now almost 12.<br/>
<br/>
If I was nearby, she&#39;d ask and I&#39;d spell the word for her. If I was in the<br/>
other room I&#39;d write it down on a piece of paper. Sometimes we still do this<br/>
&lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Have you shown her how to use spell check or how to use Google to spell<br/>
check words?<br/>
<br/>
I also never &quot;corrected&quot; her spelling unless she asked or I thought it was<br/>
something that might embarrass her. This is still true.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara<br/>

I don&#39;t remember the name of it anymore, but it wasn&#39;t that.  It was a  <br/>
child&#39;s version, with hangman and another game or two, and it would  <br/>
write the word out in cursive, gradually, too, if you left it sitting  <br/>
on one word for a bit.<br/>

Spell it for her?  Write it down so that she can copy it?  Use the computer and spell check?  Those were the ideas that immediately come to mind.<br/>

When my son could not spell something he would call out:&quot; How do you spell x?&quot; and we would say it out loud the letters.<br/>
He rarelly asks now. He is 7 and a terrific speller.  Would that work for your daughter?<br/>
Sometimes my son would be in another room and ask very loud. We repeated as many times as he needed or if he was messaging someone on a game. Sometimes I would sit with him. In the begining  I would many times type it for him too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is she reading comfortably? I know that for my son, who was a spontaneous early & fluent non-phonetic reader (before he was 5), reading independently makes spelling more frustrating as his expectations for himself have been really high. He wants to write like the books he can read. Even though he may not know the correct spelling for a word, he knows when it&#39;s wrong. <br/>
<br/>
When he gets frustrated writing on his own, I have always assured him that spelling will come as he figures out the patterns, etc. and although it&#39;s frustrating, it&#39;s nothing to worry about... he&#39;ll figure it out, I&#39;m 100% sure of it. In the meantime, he can always ask me if he&#39;s not sure about a word and if it&#39;s not perfect, who cares -- his &quot;readers&quot; (dad, me, grandparents) can figure it out. If he chooses to fix it, he can (and I&#39;m always happy to help out). I&#39;ve also told him I&#39;m happy to write down anything he&#39;d like me to as scribing is an excellent way to ease the internal pressure. Writing is also frustrating for kids because there&#39;s no way their fine motor skills can get down their ideas as fast as they can think them... another good reason to scribe for as long as they want it.<br/>

being able to spell, but I really encouraged them not to worry about it. <br/>
I remember telling Roya she could just underline the words she wasn&#39;t <br/>
sure about and I&#39;d go back later and spell them for her if she wanted. <br/>
That let her speed up so she could enjoy writing.<br/>

My 8 year old reads a little and spells even less but he likes to chat on Roblox so so just types it how he thinks it sounds... it often looks like (lick for like or wot for want).  If I am around (which i try to be) he will ask me to help.  I sometimes think the people on the other side must think it is strange...one minute his sentences look like &quot; do yu wot to go to mi plas&quot; and one second later he says &quot; would you like to be my friend&quot;. but it works.  I type for him when he asks, i tell him spellings and i write things down for him.  I have lately made a list of common words next to the computer but so far he hasnt found it convenient to use it... says people understand him so it isnt necessary.. i said ok.<br/>
<br/>
Off topic a little.. the other day his soccer coach told him he was to go in and play rt forward.  James ran around lost out there for a few minutes and later I questioned him about looking so lost.

I put L and R on the appropriate shoes which helps, but everyone else seems fairly supportive of my disability, and when I look confused will nudge me in the right or left direction.  Linnaea wrote L and R on her shoes in a supportive gesture. I&#39;ve been shown lots of tricks, like the L of the left hand and all of that, but it still takes seconds of orientation.

When I was a kid I knew it by the Pledge of Allegiance.  The confusion  <br/>
was that we would put our right hands over our hearts (on the left)  <br/>
and so what I had to do for many years was twitch my right hand and  <br/>
then I knew &quot;right.&quot;  So I would think &quot;pledge of allegiance,&quot;  <br/>
slightly flex the hand I should put on my heart, and then I knew which  <br/>
direction.<br/>
<br/>
Even into adulthood in the midst of a very distracting situation where  <br/>
different parts of my brain were already in use, I could find right or  <br/>
left by tensing/flexing my right hand.<br/>
<br/>
By the time I was 30, I had finally learned it.  Or maybe I had  <br/>
learned to avoid situations so distracting I didn&#39;t know my left from  <br/>
my right. :-)<br/>
<br/>
My kids had no pledge of allegiance and no handwriting practice, so I  <br/>
don&#39;t know how they learned it.  I should ask.<br/>

I can usually do this by a quick look at my hands -- not because I wear a watch or a ring, but because I seem to have it figured out visually with respect to my hands (probably due to &quot;handedness&quot;). It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s a quick process of elimination.<br/>
<br/>
I seem to come by the L/R confusion naturally. When I was a kid (and a passenger in the backseat of the car), my mom would navigate and my dad would drive. I can still hear her say, &quot;Turn left, honey. No, the other left.&quot;<br/>

What hand does he eat with?  I always remembered which hand was which because I sucked my thumb, so I knew that my left was the thumb sucking hand.<br/>
