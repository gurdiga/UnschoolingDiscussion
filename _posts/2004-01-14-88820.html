<div id="ygrps-yiv-517917906">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking here for a little while and I guess now that I<br/>
posted I might as well instroduce myself.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently living in IL with my daughter (2), husband, and 3<br/>
dogs. Before I became a mom I was a web developer and a doula. But<br/>
trying to do the parenting thing right is taking up all of my time. <br/>
<br/>
My two obstacles between myself and unschooling are my husband and my<br/>
mother. He, because he just doesn&#39;t understand how one can learn math<br/>
and science without setting up a classroom-like environment and<br/>
lecturing/giving homework. She, because she believes that one would<br/>
be socially stanted without school and would have no friends. I am<br/>
winning him over by giving him various articles with examples. Mom, I<br/>
have invited to the unschooling conference this August - of course,<br/>
my daughter is acting as bait. I hope she comes, and sees the other<br/>
unschoolers&#39; children - that would be the best way to get her to stop<br/>
badgering me and telling me that I am just lazy and taking the easy<br/>
way out. <br/>
<br/>
I have to say that though I am on many different MLs for my various<br/>
interests, you guys are the most well articulated, well mannered,<br/>
supportive and opinionated group! I wish I had the time to sit and<br/>
read every one of the 200+ posts/day ;)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I am always so impressed with people who make decisions ahead of time (since<br/>
you don&#39;t have to decide about hsing until she reaches school age).<br/>
<br/>
Since you have this time, I think you have an effective argument for your dh<br/>
about unschooling.  Ask him to make a list of the things your daughter knows<br/>
NOW.  How long of sentences she uses, does she recognize numbers, what<br/>
colors does she know, can she count, etc., etc., etc....<br/>
<br/>
Have him make another list when she is 3, then 4, then 5.  It will put her<br/>
unschooling progress right there in front of him.  By the time she is 5, she<br/>
is liable to be able to recognize several numbers (mine learned by working<br/>
the microwave), tell the difference of greater or less (mine learned by<br/>
someone not sharing the cookies equally), simple addition and subtraction<br/>
(mine learned by figuring out how many more forks they needed to go back and<br/>
get to finish setting the table), etc..<br/>
<br/>
He will see the math, the science, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
<br/>

Feel free to invite Marty over and introduce him to her.  He&#39;s never been to <br/>
school, and he makes a pretty good first impression.  He&#39;s 15 suddenly <br/>
(today).  He used to be pretty shy, but no more.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am currently living in IL <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a homeschooling (not strictly unschooling) conference coming up at <br/>
the end of March in Arlington Heights.  We went when the kids were 2 and 3.  It <br/>
changed my husband&#39;s life to see all those kids and parents behaving <br/>
respectfully towards each other.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeeducatorsconference.org">http://www.homeeducatorsconference.org</a>  <br/>
<br/>
Also, there&#39;s the Illinois HOUSE group - a secular, inclusive group, but some <br/>
chapters are more unschooly than others.   www.illinoishouse.org.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.  For my husband, seeing was believing.  And I started on him <br/>
when the kids were really young.  I leave stuff to read by the computer, so <br/>
he&#39;ll browse while burning cds.  He&#39;s read all of John Holt that way.  Sneaky?  <br/>
Yes, but there&#39;s nothing like being greeted in the morning with &quot;I was <br/>
reading John Holt this morning, and...&quot;<br/>
