I managed to lose my Grandmothers caramel recipe and was wondering if any of you had a good recipe.  Last time I made it was about 13 years ago, and my sisters are not able to find their copy.  Also, any good fudge recipes?  I am in a cookie exchange at work and thought I would mix it up a little with some candy.  I just finished a batch of caramelized pecans(puh-cahhnz for you southerners &lt;g&gt;) ~~yummy~~<br/>
<br/>
Thanks loads, <br/>

<br/>
And where do pecans grow??<br/>
And so who gets to declare their name?<br/>
<br/>
That &quot;PEE cans&quot; pronunciation always made me think of people who learned the <br/>
name from reading it and not from hearing it!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, who knows the difference from a pee can (which you don&#39;t need once <br/>
you have an indoor flush toilet) and pecans (which can be picked up off the <br/>
ground in much of Texas and southern New Mexico).</div>

Louisiana) corrected me in a Baskin Robbins.  I was ordering Butter Pecan<br/>
ice cream and and when my midwest accent called my order, she laid into me<br/>
like I had put my fingers on a chalkboard.  Ever since then, I have<br/>
corrected my pronunciation.<br/>
