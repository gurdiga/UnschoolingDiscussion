<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143931823">In the car, on the way to drop David off for basketball practice, we got<br/>
stuck waiting for a train to pass by.  It was a looooong one.  Joseph asked<br/>

<br/>
I never thought to wonder - and I took a more than 7,000 mile train trip <br/>
this year! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
The engines are very heavy and strong and the cars are relatively  <br/>
light.  It&#39;s not about size, it&#39;s about friction.   The mass of the  <br/>
engine puts weight at the front.  Steel wheels on wheel rails, once  <br/>
they&#39;re moving, are easy to keep moving.  It&#39;s easier to keep it  <br/>
moving once it is moving that to get it started.<br/>
<br/>
Ways to help think about it are to look at roller coasters, and also  <br/>
to think about an engine going by itself, and then an engine with two  <br/>
or three cars.   Part of the engineering in train engineers is knowing  <br/>
when to speed up or slow down to make best use of the momentum of the  <br/>
cars behind the engine, and how not to waste fuel.  Like a roller  <br/>
coaster, the downhills pick up speed.   Like a roller coaster, the  <br/>
most energy/fuel is expended to pull the engine up an incline, but  <br/>
once the engine is at the top or level, it&#39;s not nearly as much work  <br/>
to get other cars to follow!   The engineers will know when a train&#39;s  <br/>
weight needs two or three engines to pull.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-317013346">Probably has something to do with momentum...once the engine gets going,<br/>
the cars glide along the steel tracks.  Starting will be the hardest, as pulling<br/>
up any kind of incline.  <br/>
