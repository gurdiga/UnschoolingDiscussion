<br/>
While recently at a birthday party, my son was called &#39;bad boy&#39; for not <br/>
giving his last three candies to the birthday girl. The woman who called <br/>
him that was ignorant of the fact that he had just sat down and shared <br/>
the entire package with her and wanted to save three for the long ride <br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
I was in earshot but not in the room, so she coerced him into giving them <br/>
up. At that point I was trying to make my way in, through the 3 yos, to <br/>
stop her.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t get there and yelled rather loudly for her to stop <br/>
intimidating my son. She got mad and wouldn&#39;t talk to me after that.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, everyone thought I was the &#39;bad guy&#39; for not being more <br/>
respectful to the birthday girls grandmother. ugh!<br/>
<br/>
When people say is your son good? Or say their kid is bad or whatnot. I <br/>
ALWAYS say &#39;There are no bad children. Only bad parents. Children just <br/>
are.&#39; That usually gets them mad or gets them thinking.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Donna, this sentence sparks an issue that I&#39;d like to bring up. (Thanks <br/>
for the thump on the head!)<br/>
<br/>
What do other unschoolers do that are repeatedly told that &#39;well, they&#39;re <br/>
from the old school&#39; as if I should excuse them for their behaviour and <br/>
they aren&#39;t obliged to respect MY opinions?<br/>
<br/>
I get this from people in my generation (in-laws etc) that think I should <br/>
let the grandparents coerce, abuse or infringe upon my child&#39;s rights <br/>
because thats how they were raised.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly I dont&#39; buy into it. My mom&#39;s side of the family respected <br/>
children, EVEN when they lived in Italy in the &#39;old school&#39; days.<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s father&#39;s family didn&#39;t. Still don&#39;t. And I don&#39;t think I should <br/>
have to have patience with them.<br/>
<br/>
You should hear how the grandfather STILL talks to the male members of <br/>
the family and they are older! It is so disgusting that I&#39;m not at all <br/>
surprised how insecure they are.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing, the manthing agrees with me when I point out specific <br/>
instances of abuse, yet he doesn&#39;t try and stop it. He says &#39;what can you <br/>
do, thats they&#39;re way, I&#39;m not going to start fighting with them now.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t sticking up for your children count for anything OUTSIDE of <br/>
respect for the other generation???<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
My son was 3 mos when we were there for a visit. AT the dinner table the <br/>
kids father was holding him and he was grabbing at the silverware (err.. <br/>
tableware, it wasn&#39;t silver). The grandfather picked up his butterknife <br/>
and said &#39;you want to play with the eh? do that again and i&#39;ll use this <br/>
knife on you&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I was appalled to the point that I was speechless! (Trust me, today he <br/>
would of found himself on the other end of the butcher&#39;s knife for saying <br/>
that - yeah, not the better choice but the choice that this person <br/>
understands).<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s father never came to his defense. When I refused to go over <br/>
there for years after, I was being called unreasonable for not letting <br/>
the incident go. <br/>
<br/>
I feel me and my son were owned an apolgy. We never got one.<br/>
<br/>
I still shudder when I think of it and find it hard to forgive myself for <br/>
not speaking up at the time.<br/>
<br/>
But why, oh why, are we expected to forgive people for their ways, when <br/>
people can&#39;t &#39;forgive&#39; us for ours?<br/>

<br/>
Reminds me of a few years back, I was at a learning store/class with my then 3 yod. She was big for her age and looked older (though now she&#39;s just a bit taller than most 6 yo) and she was playing with another little girl about 3. The girl took a toy from dd, and dd took it back -- the mother didn&#39;t see the girl take it from dd first, and said &quot;You need to share. You&#39;re old enough to know better.&quot; I like to think I was polite (looking back, I hope so, as I think that gets more attention...but I was mad so I&#39;m not sure I was as successful as I&#39;d have liked) when I gave her a piece of my mind ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101352383">I&#39;d take issue with someone approaching me in public. <br/>
<br/>
The reason I speak so vehemently about this is because many years ago, my oldest picked up something from the ground and was shoving it in her mouth. I slapped her hand away, a quick reaction to get the dirty food item (contaminated? poison? who knew?) away from her mouth -- and a woman started loudly commenting to me about horrible parents who &#39;beat&#39; their children. <br/>
<br/>
Spanking is a legal thing -- doesn&#39;t make it right, I know, but who are we to impose our parenting choices on someone else? We don&#39;t want &#39;big brother&#39; watching us, nor do we want people telling us what to do, so I would hesitate to do the very same in reverse.<br/>

 isn&#39;t afraid to ask for it.  Coming from my family of origin I see that<br/>
 as a positive character trait.  She did this at the park last week and<br/>
 it still bugs me and I still haven&#39;t figured out a good response.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would say that her leadership traits will take her far in life.  No need to <br/>
use<br/>
a word with negative conotations.  If she keeps up I would flat out ask her <br/>
not to use that word anymore, you prefer self-starter, motivated, leader etc.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m a little sensitive sometimes about Cacie&#39;s, um, &quot;leadership<br/>
qualities&quot;. The bossy label was thrown at me a lot as a kid, and I do<br/>
sometimes cringe inside when I see her sort of running the show. OTOH,<br/>
I&#39;ve been able to get beyond that first response and see that she really<br/>
is thoughtful towards other kids most of the time, and she certainly<br/>
doesn&#39;t have problems making and keeping friends... so I&#39;ve been able to<br/>
quell a lot of my discomfort and realize that it has a lot more to do<br/>
with me than her.<br/>
<br/>
I would try to reframe the statement in a more positive light, maybe<br/>
talking about their having leadership qualities, and good ideas, and<br/>
confidence...  but also maybe point out (if it&#39;s true) that both girls<br/>
seem to get along well with other kids, and see if that might defuse her<br/>
a bit...<br/>

<br/>
The reason I speak so vehemently about this is because many years ago, my <br/>
oldest picked up something from the ground and was shoving it in her mouth. <br/>
I slapped her hand away, a quick reaction to get the dirty food item <br/>
(contaminated? poison? who knew?) away from her mouth -- and a woman <br/>
started loudly commenting to me about horrible parents who &#39;beat&#39; their <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Spanking is a legal thing -- doesn&#39;t make it right, I know, but who are we <br/>
to impose our parenting choices on someone else? We don&#39;t want &#39;big <br/>
brother&#39; watching us, nor do we want people telling us what to do, so I <br/>
would hesitate to do the very same in reverse.<br/>
<br/>
-----<br/>
<br/>
First, if I&#39;d have been in your shoes, I would have said, &quot;I agree. That&#39;s <br/>
why I don&#39;t hit my children. I moved quickly to stop my daughter from <br/>
eating something that was on the floor. Perhaps I could&#39;ve made a different <br/>
choice. Thank you for caring so much about children.&quot; I&#39;m really paranoid <br/>
about e-coli (what my son Kadin died from), so I would have also added, &quot;My <br/>
son died from e-coli, so I am really concerned about things on floors in <br/>
public places.&quot; (That shuts a lot of people up!)<br/>
<br/>
I do have to ask though - because hitting children is legal, we shouldn&#39;t <br/>
speak up about someone hitting their child? I have to say I have never <br/>
spoken directly to anyone who is hitting their child in public. Every time <br/>
it happens though (often, unfortunately), I turn to Alexandria and say, &quot;I <br/>
am so sorry you had to see that child get hit. Children are *not* for <br/>
*hitting* - they are for nurturing, loving, cherishing, protecting, and <br/>
learning patience from.&quot; Now, I am not talking about getting *hit* (aka <br/>
spanked - whatever), not getting a hand away from the mouth quickly.<br/>
<br/>
I speak up about all sorts of things that are *legal* - SIN feeding, <br/>
cutting penises, c/sections (non-medical medical births for that matter)...<br/>
<br/>
I wonder *when* hitting children will become illegal. Geez - it&#39;s illegal <br/>
for one legal adult to hit another legal adult. I have never been able to <br/>
figure out why it&#39;s legal to hit a child. And I do *not* advocate for CPS <br/>
in any manner what-so-ever; I hate that gov&#39;t. entity that steals children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953663966">Actually, my response to her wasn&#39;t any justification at all -- she wasn&#39;t owed one, imho. I don&#39;t feel I have to explain my parenting actions to anyone. But, she did get A response. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And personally, though I may make the choice not to spank my child, it&#39;s MY choice as a parent, and it&#39;s not my right to enforce my choices on others. (Obviously, or at least I hope obviously, I&#39;m not talking abusive smacking around type behavior -- which is illegal and something that I&#39;d treat differently.) I&#39;m just really, really against it when a person who doesn&#39;t want &#39;big brother&#39; or anyone else telling them what to do turns around and does that very same thing to someone else. I really believe that just because I choose or believe in something, it doesn&#39;t mean someone else has to. That&#39;s why homeschooling and parenting are such wonderful choices -- there&#39;s no one right or wrong way. If someone were to approach me in that manner, I&#39;d politely tell them to mind their own business.<br/>
<br/>
So sorry to hear about Kadin :( Do you know what he got e coli from?) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-835268157">Kolleen, that knife incident would have had me boiling! I can&#39;t imagine the amount of patience you must have had to get through the rest of that day, and I don&#39;t blame you for not going anymore either.<br/>
<br/>
Seems a lot of old school people don&#39;t seem to want to hear any opinions other than their own. Then again, I know a lot of young people like that too, so I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s just the age as much as it is a product of their environment and upbringing. Probably the same thing with the way they talk to people, and their lack of respect. Seems some like to bully people into respect, rather than earning it.<br/>
<br/>
Dh&#39;s family is odd -- yet Dh has gone head-to-head with them several times. At first I thought he was doing it because he knows I wouldn&#39;t have hung out with them at any point in the future if he didn&#39;t, but then I realized he was starting to see the difference of when he DID speak up for his kids, or us, or whatever the issue was. It&#39;s hard speaking up against family, but there are times it has to be done.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that I have anything of value to help, but I do wish you luck in that you don&#39;t have to deal with it.<br/>

  &gt;That would have gotten to me as well! I dislike when other people try to <br/>

  &gt;wasn&#39;t her place, even if there had truly been something going on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Donna, this sentence sparks an issue that I&#39;d like to bring up. (Thanks <br/>
  for the thump on the head!)<br/>
<br/>
  What do other unschoolers do that are repeatedly told that &#39;well, they&#39;re <br/>
  from the old school&#39; as if I should excuse them for their behaviour and <br/>
  they aren&#39;t obliged to respect MY opinions?<br/>
<br/>
  I get this from people in my generation (in-laws etc) that think I should <br/>
  let the grandparents coerce, abuse or infringe upon my child&#39;s rights <br/>
  because thats how they were raised.<br/>
<br/>
  Frankly I dont&#39; buy into it. My mom&#39;s side of the family respected <br/>
  children, EVEN when they lived in Italy in the &#39;old school&#39; days.<br/>
<br/>
  My son&#39;s father&#39;s family didn&#39;t. Still don&#39;t. And I don&#39;t think I should <br/>
  have to have patience with them.<br/>
<br/>
  You should hear how the grandfather STILL talks to the male members of <br/>
  the family and they are older! It is so disgusting that I&#39;m not at all <br/>
  surprised how insecure they are.<br/>
<br/>
  Funny thing, the manthing agrees with me when I point out specific <br/>
  instances of abuse, yet he doesn&#39;t try and stop it. He says &#39;what can you <br/>
  do, thats they&#39;re way, I&#39;m not going to start fighting with them now.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
  Doesn&#39;t sticking up for your children count for anything OUTSIDE of <br/>
  respect for the other generation???<br/>
<br/>
  For example:<br/>
<br/>
  My son was 3 mos when we were there for a visit. AT the dinner table the <br/>
  kids father was holding him and he was grabbing at the silverware (err.. <br/>
  tableware, it wasn&#39;t silver). The grandfather picked up his butterknife <br/>
  and said &#39;you want to play with the eh? do that again and i&#39;ll use this <br/>
  knife on you&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
  I was appalled to the point that I was speechless! (Trust me, today he <br/>
  would of found himself on the other end of the butcher&#39;s knife for saying <br/>
  that - yeah, not the better choice but the choice that this person <br/>
  understands).<br/>
<br/>
  My son&#39;s father never came to his defense. When I refused to go over <br/>
  there for years after, I was being called unreasonable for not letting <br/>
  the incident go. <br/>
<br/>
  I feel me and my son were owned an apolgy. We never got one.<br/>
<br/>
  I still shudder when I think of it and find it hard to forgive myself for <br/>
  not speaking up at the time.<br/>
<br/>
  But why, oh why, are we expected to forgive people for their ways, when <br/>
  people can&#39;t &#39;forgive&#39; us for ours?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121373678">When you said screeching and berating, it reminded me -- I was getting my haircut earlier this week, and there were 4 generations of one family (all women, except for the grandson, who was probably maybe 2) getting cuts/styling, whatever. The great-grandmother watched the child for a few minutes while his mother got something from the store next door. She SCREAMED at this kid, in this little salon, &quot;SIT DOWN, STAY THERE, NOW, NOW, ....etc&quot; with this dog-like growl in her voice. I turned to look, while trying to get my own baby to stay calm (he doesn&#39;t like yelling, sometimes he cries) and a lady at the cashier counter turned and started to comment. But, the great-grandmother was yelling so loud, she heard nothing. Then, mom came in, the kid was fine, and no one acted like anything had happened. The gg finally said &quot;he&#39;s a handful!&quot; or something like that (it wasn&#39;t as nice as saying &#39;handful&#39; and the mom says oh yes, he is, which amazed me in itself..he was a typical 2 yo, imho) and then walked away to get her haircut. She came up to me about 15 mins later telling me how well-behaved my 6 yod was and how pretty, etc. She was so sweet, it was hard to remember she&#39;d been screeching not long before. Sort of sad, because she was obviously of the old school temperament of &#39;children should be still and quiet,&#39; which my dd was -- she was getting her haircut, but she should see her other times LOL  <br/>

  Actually, in one case, I asked the mom if she&#39;d just like a break and I<br/>
  would watch her kids for a minute.  She was young and had 5 little ones in<br/>
  tow and you could tell that the older three were pushing buttons.  So I<br/>

  &gt; I&#39;ve never run into anyone hitting their kids in public. I don&#39;t know<br/>
  &gt; what I would do, I really don&#39;t.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; What have people done on this list when that situation arises? I&#39;d love<br/>
  &gt; to be prepared just in case...<br/>

  &gt; That would have gotten to me as well! I dislike when other people try to discipline, coerce or otherwise, in short, tell my child what to do. I&#39;d have said something too when the grandmother called him &#39;bad boy.&#39; That wasn&#39;t her place, even if there had truly been something going on.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  What would you all recommend doing to a mother who refers to your child<br/>
  as bossy?  And in a bad sense?  Megan&#39;s best friend&#39;s mother tells everyone<br/>
  that both Megan and Miranda are bossy but that Miranda is the bossiest one.<br/>
  I see Megan as strong-willed and as a person who knows what she wants and<br/>
  isn&#39;t afraid to ask for it.  Coming from my family of origin I see that<br/>
  as a positive character trait.  She did this at the park last week and<br/>
  it still bugs me and I still haven&#39;t figured out a good response.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-704208436">I&#39;m always a little concerned with moms who &quot;loose it&quot; in public places.  If<br/>
they react that way when they are in public, which usually constrains most<br/>
folks, how are they reacting in the privacy of their own homes?<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem with a &quot;swat,&quot; I don&#39;t consider that something to get<br/>
excited about.  But screeching and screaming or, we saw this when we were on<br/>
vacation in Oregon, a woman picks a two-year-old up by one arm and shakes<br/>
them like a rag doll, well, that&#39;s abuse.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t think kidlets &quot;belong&quot; to their parents.  I don&#39;t think they<br/>
are chattel or something we own.  I think of them as small people that we<br/>
are to nuture and guide until they are capable of taking care of themselves.<br/>
Mandatory ages just don&#39;t work for me for the same reason ps doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
Kids don&#39;t do &quot;x&quot; at age &quot;y&quot; because someone else says so.  They also don&#39;t<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093247960">Lovemary, I totally see what you&#39;re saying -- it is hypocritical to simply say that it&#39;s okay to hit kids, but not hit an adult. (There&#39;s a lot more to it than that, I think, but simply saying &#39;hitting&#39; does sound very contradictory.)<br/>
<br/>
My concern, and I probably didn&#39;t clarify well, was more about other people butting in and telling people what to do, not the issue of people spanking vs. not spanking. Hope that explains better?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-719165964">Bridget, those are similar to my thoughts, though I was hesitant to comment on spanking itself. I really did try to just focus on people telling others what to do...but your post said something I was thinking of, and that is that we don&#39;t know the whole story, we don&#39;t know the situation, I won&#39;t just judge someone a bad parent based on one thing, and I don&#39;t think spanking is 100% wrong. <br/>

  Well, it isn&#39;t logical and it is not necessarily accurate either.  I <br/>
  can think of one circumstance where one adult can legally spank <br/>
  another.  And I&#39;ve seen cases where spanking was considered abuse and <br/>
  the kids remove or parents sent to classes.<br/>
<br/>
  As for me personally, I think spanking should not be the standard <br/>
  practice.  But I won&#39;t pass judgement on a mom who looses it at a <br/>
  store and swats a fanny once.  I don&#39;t know the circumstances so I <br/>
  would not presume to know what is going on.  But if the situation <br/>
  allows, I try to talk to them and help her get a grip.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-422394126">I think some women lose it in public more easily because at home, they don&#39;t have to worry so much about what their kids are doing -- as opposed to in public, where they have to maintain their children at usually much more of a restricted level. Just a thought, but I think part of the reason is that the mother (or father) gets nervous about her child crying, making a mess, being too noisy, whatever, and they lose it while trying to restrain the child to prevent the negative reactions of others. Maybe if more people kept their unwanted comments to themselves, parents would worry less about having to keep their kids in line to the point of losing it  ;)  <br/>

  I&#39;m always a little concerned with moms who &quot;loose it&quot; in public places.  If<br/>
  they react that way when they are in public, which usually constrains most<br/>
  folks, how are they reacting in the privacy of their own homes?<br/>
<br/>
  I have no problem with a &quot;swat,&quot; I don&#39;t consider that something to get<br/>
  excited about.  But screeching and screaming or, we saw this when we were on<br/>
  vacation in Oregon, a woman picks a two-year-old up by one arm and shakes<br/>
  them like a rag doll, well, that&#39;s abuse.<br/>
<br/>
  I also don&#39;t think kidlets &quot;belong&quot; to their parents.  I don&#39;t think they<br/>
  are chattel or something we own.  I think of them as small people that we<br/>
  are to nuture and guide until they are capable of taking care of themselves.<br/>
  Mandatory ages just don&#39;t work for me for the same reason ps doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
  Kids don&#39;t do &quot;x&quot; at age &quot;y&quot; because someone else says so.  They also don&#39;t<br/>
  mature at &quot;x&quot; age and are capable of &quot;y&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL Donna. . . thats kind of what Bryan said to me. . . of course you have <br/>
the right to free speech, and I have the right to lay into you too. . . <br/>
sounds like trouble to me (I mean with him!). It&#39;s all in how it gets phrased <br/>
I guess.<br/>
<br/>
 I agree with Lynda&#39;s assesment. . . .if someone is hitting or spanking a <br/>
child outside of the home, there are some serious issues there. I was <br/>
thinking, how might it empower a young person to see another adult stand up <br/>
to that parent and tell them it is not okay to hit another living being . . . <br/>
how might that young person&#39;s life be changed by a simple statement like that <br/>
. . . how might that life turn out very differently if their feelings were <br/>
affirmed by someone. I can say the risk in getting involved would be well <br/>
worth it if it gave some hope to a child.  I know that each has chosen their <br/>
own particular path and when I come upon a situation like this, I have a <br/>
choice as well. My choice is to speak aloud as the spirit moves me to. It&#39;s <br/>
like throwing a pebble into a pond . . .the ripple effect, touching people&#39;s <br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
As far as judgment goes, we all judge others. We judge other parents <br/>
continually by the choices we make regarding them. We judge ourselves as well <br/>
(yes, I do see the irony in this statement considering my sig line) on a <br/>
myriad of issues. When I say something to another person about their spanking <br/>
a child, I am not  saying I judge that person to be bad or immoral or <br/>
whatever. I do believe I am saying that the action of striking another being <br/>
is hurtful, painful emotionally and physically, and extremely damaging to a <br/>
young person. To me it is no different than a husband stirking his wife when <br/>
she is doing something he thinks is wrong. . . can you imagine getting your <br/>
butt or hand slapped in public by your husband because you were too noisy, or <br/>
needed to pee AGAIN, or spilled something, or etc. etc etc. There is no <br/>
justification for doing it . . . of course, people make mistakes, but if you <br/>
are seeing it in public, it is a mistake that is common, and someone needs to <br/>
say so and affirm for that young person. <br/>
<br/>
As to how it relates to unschooling, it a young person is spanked/hit and <br/>
fears their parents, it follows (to me) that there is very little free choice <br/>
in that young person&#39;s life. Their choices are motivated by fear and doing <br/>
the &quot;right&quot; thing, not by intrinsic motivation, hence unschooling would not <br/>
be able to trule occur.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-999065632">I think I&#39;d loan her a book about strong women, you know... something <br/>
that emphasises all the positive things about that trait.  Raising a <br/>
small child who is strong-willed can be difficult and I&#39;d imagine a <br/>
person could not see beyond that age/stage and only think in a <br/>
negative vein. However, if you could say &quot;yeah, but just think what <br/>
powerful leaders they&#39;ll be when they&#39;re grown&quot; or something along <br/>
those lines.<br/>
To fuss at the lady for calling your child bossy won&#39;t get you <br/>
anywhere imo. Better to find a positive side of the situation and  go <br/>
with that angle.<br/>
