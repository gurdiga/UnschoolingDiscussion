<div id="ygrps-yiv-131784329">Got it! You encourage the kids to stay up really really late watching really<br/>
silly TV programmes, and then they stay in bed till lunchtime! Meantime, I&#39;m<br/>
out in the garden :-)<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to my next question: how many million rows of peas do you<br/>
have to grow before there is enough to bring inside for a meal? I just seem<br/>
to eat them all while I&#39;m gardening &lt;g&gt; Yum yum.<br/>

definitive book(s) on permaculture. I have just read<br/>
some of his works...you could find a web site for<br/>
permaculture in your area and something under Bill M.<br/>
I don&#39;t know of any sites in particular.<br/>

Wish I could help you with the forsythia. Not even sure what it is.<br/>
But my fist thought is to not burn anything plant-based as it can<br/>
likely be used to enhance your property at some point.  In<br/>
permaculture -- earth healing -- you want to use available and local<br/>
resources.  Established fruit trees and vines are a blessing!  I<br/>
believe truly sustainable practices are best.  Chems are on the way<br/>
out because of their destructive and persistent characteristics.<br/>
Organic is a decent middle ground.<br/>
<br/>
As for resources, a beginner in permaculture might seek out a<br/>
fundamentals course.  They are offered around the US and the world.  I<br/>
know of one coming up soon here in Austin, TX but not sure where you<br/>
are.  An eco-village in North Carolina, Earth Haven<br/>
(www.earthaven.org) has a lot of information for folks.  Instructors<br/>
of permaculture live there.<br/>
<br/>
Permaculture involves taking responsibility for what comes into and<br/>
goes out of your life.<br/>
<br/>
You probably found the permaculture.com website right off.  There is<br/>
also a site based in the UK: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.permaculture.co.uk/">http://www.permaculture.co.uk/</a> which has<br/>
a magazine.  Another magazine is Permaculture Activist:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.permacultureactivist.net/.">http://www.permacultureactivist.net/.</a><br/>
<br/>
And of course, the publications: Introduction to Permaculture by Bill<br/>
Mollison and Reny Mia Slay, and the primer Permaculture, A Designer&#39;s<br/>
Manual by Bill Mollison.  A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander<br/>
is is a classic.  Try this website too:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.patternlanguage.com/">http://www.patternlanguage.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

I&#39;d never heard of it before, so I went and looked it up.  It&#39;s what<br/>
my dd wants to do with our property.  Do you have and web sites you<br/>
think are particularly good ones for a beginner in permaculture?<br/>
<br/>
We have lots of fruit trees, berry bushes and grapes but they are all<br/>
wild and overgrown.  The property sat idle for 10 years or so before<br/>
we bought it.  So far, we have just been clearing some of the worst of<br/>
<br/>
the overgrown forsythia (did you know forsytia is very hard to burn?)<br/>

&quot;People take different roads seeking<br/>
fulfillment and happiness. Just<br/>
because they&#39;re not on your road<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve gotten lost.&quot;<br/>
