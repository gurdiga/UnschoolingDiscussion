<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556447931">Thanks so much to all of you who replied to my recent &quot;worry&quot;. I <br/>
think you all had wonderful points to make and it just ressures me <br/>
that I am on the right path. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I have to tell you Sandra that this is the best money I have <br/>
spent since I started home schooling I can&#39;t tell you how much $$ I <br/>
have spent on stupid reading programs - still doesn&#39;t read.  <br/>
<br/>
He does have fun and I think he is so happy to be home to pursue what <br/>
he wants to. He exspressed wanting to go to school the other day <br/>
(before the games)- I asked him why and he couldn&#39;t tell me because <br/>
he didn&#39;t know LOL........ but he said what makes me not want to go <br/>
is that I don&#39;t want to do reading.<br/>

I&#39;m glad you are feeling more comfortable with letting your son play his video games.<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t forget to spend time with him while he&#39;s playing.  Watching him play, playing multi-player games with him, and researching game help with him are great ways to spend time together.  And I bet he&#39;d enjoy watching you attempt one of his games on your own with him giving you advice and tips along the way.  You&#39;ll get a first-hand look at what he enjoys about the games and a better appreciation for what he&#39;s learning.  As well as being able to understand what he&#39;s talking about and truly connecting with him when he runs into the room to happily exclaim he just did such-and-such.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;ll love that, and you&#39;ll feel much more a part of the whole video game deal.<br/>

<br/>
Both my boys learned to read directly because of video games, magazines and <br/>
game guides.  I strongly recommend that you buy game guides if your kids want <br/>
them.  That&#39;s also how my boys learned:<br/>
 <br/>
deductive reasoning (From figuring out which of eight patterns the Mario <br/>
bonus round was.  It wasn&#39;t random, there were only eight--all shown in the book, <br/>
and if they made good first choices, they could figure out which pattern it <br/>
was and fill it all in without &quot;losing,&quot; and that got them into high levels of <br/>
the game they couldn&#39;t have found by guessing.)<br/>
<br/>
map reading (from following the maps of the screens, shown fully in the book)<br/>
<br/>
alphabetical order (Kirby bought the index to Nintendo Power magazine, with <br/>
his own money, before he could read, so I could find articles for him in back <br/>
issues)<br/>
<br/>
literary notation (I don&#39;t know what else to call this, but in the index, an <br/>
issue and page number were shown in this format:    22: 17 for issue 22, page <br/>
17.  Because of that, Shakespeare act/scene/line notation and Biblical John <br/>
3:16 make simple sense to them, and the idiomatic phrase &quot;he cited me chapter <br/>
and verse&quot; refers to that notation too.)<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, this might be better accomplished on websites which will have <br/>
references, maps, &quot;walk-throughs&quot; and so forth, but I still recommend game guides <br/>
for kids to learn all kinds of things (and get through the games more easily).<br/>
