<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535872238">I don&#39;t know. I do facilitate my son sleeping and waking on a <br/>
day/night pattern that I can function on too. I do not make him sleep <br/>
when he doesn&#39;t want to, but I do make the environment conducive <br/>
(like riding in the car, rocking, quiet videos, lullabyes, etc.). I <br/>
explain when I perceive that his self-control behaviors are <br/>
deteriorating (voice getting very loud and unable or unwilling to <br/>
consider it&#39;s effect on others in the house, hitting or jumping on <br/>
furniture and being unable to be redirected to other hitting and <br/>
jumping activities.). I share my perception that he appears to be <br/>
getting tired or hungary. I know that you and I are both wanting our <br/>
children to learn how to self-regulate meeting their sleep needs <br/>
without impacting others, and without interfering with their learning <br/>
by not making them sleep or wake according to our needs. <br/>
<br/>
It is a very fine line. My need to function does not supersede his <br/>
need to learn unobstructed. Nor does his need to learn unobstructed <br/>
supersede my need to function with enough sleep. I use many tools to <br/>
meet my sleep needs irrelevant of my son&#39;s sleep patterns. (napping, <br/>
resting while he is engaged elsewhere, others playing so I can rest, <br/>
sleeping in or going to bed earlier when relief is available, etc.). <br/>
<br/>
BUT, and this is a BIG BUT, I do communicate how his sleep (or lack <br/>
of sleep) pattern affects me WHEN his behavior impacts me due to him <br/>
being tired or hungary. I let him know that he appears to be tired or <br/>
hungary and I describe what I see and that I think we need to do xyz <br/>
wind down activities. I do not MAKE him, but I do emphatically <br/>
suggest repeatedly that he appears to need some rest or to eat. <br/>
Similarly, if he is disturbing me while I am resting (rare now), I <br/>
let him know that I do not have the energy for some activities and <br/>
tend to be grouchy if I do not get enough rest, just like he does. If <br/>
he insists he needs me, I do choose to meet his needs if no other <br/>
solution is available or agreeable. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I do rouse him from a nap to shorten it if it <br/>
appears that a long nap will cause us to all be up until 1 or 2 am <br/>
without enough sleep. Usually, I can just sleep when he sleeps and <br/>
this works for us. Or my husband and I take turns if we are on a late <br/>
pattern. BUT, and again this is a BIG BUT, I do not MAKE him wake up. <br/>
Excitedly attempt to engage him to awaken, yes, but if he is clearly <br/>
communicating that he doesn&#39;t want to get up, I don&#39;t MAKE him <br/>
miserable. In my sleep deprived state, such as you are describing, I <br/>
did try that out of desperation, but it was so against my principles <br/>
that I knew it wasn&#39;t a solution we could live with. I knew that we <br/>
could creatively solve the problem without coercion. <br/>
<br/>
Is initiating waking him from a nap or telling him he needs rest <br/>
coercion? I don&#39;t think so, if I don&#39;t force it against his will. The <br/>
key is trying to persuade, listening and both of us having the <br/>
opportunity to change our mind when etiher person says &quot;No, I don&#39;t <br/>
want to&quot;. My son doesn&#39;t have coercion used to make him do things he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do. I believe this is a key to his flexibility in <br/>
choosing to accomodate others&#39; desires. Not always, of course. <br/>
<br/>
Flexibility of all parties involved can be compromise or even <br/>
democracy. However, in compromise and even in democracy someone <br/>
concedes something. A dictatorship assumes someone dictates or <br/>
decides, no matter if it is benevolent. Common preference means <br/>
choosen by agreement of the parties involved, no one concedes or <br/>
decides for the others involved.<br/>
<br/>
A whole new way of interacting? For many adults and for most <br/>
children, yes. It IS respecting (attention to, consideration of, <br/>
reguard for) others, but it is more than benevolence (kindness), it <br/>
is honoring another&#39;s right to self-determination.<br/>

&gt; The third thing has been that she has spent some time in the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>been out of<br/>
