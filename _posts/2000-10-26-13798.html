<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051885761">Nancy, the folks that work at these places usually are just plain folks.  It<br/>
is the government and the higher ups that I wouldn&#39;t trust any further than<br/>
I could toss them.  I also find that I can believe most everything they say<br/>
up until they open their mouths.<br/>
