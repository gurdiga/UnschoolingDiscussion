 </span></blockquote>I have fairly recently come to an even more radical new understanding of the <br/>
harm that is done by having kids doing school math throughout their <br/>
elementary school years. I&#39;ve been tutoring several high school age kids and <br/>
several adults, individually, to help them get ready for various exams that <br/>
they want to take (CHSPE and CBEST and SAT). Several things have really <br/>
struck me.<br/>
<br/>
1. Anxiety about math, anxiety that started in primary or secondary school, <br/>
is REALLY TRULY something that blocks intelligent, motivated peoples&#39; brains <br/>
from being able to learn. Even anxiety that only appears to be a bit mild, <br/>
even anxiety that people don&#39;t recognize as anxiety, has a HUGE blocking <br/>
affect. People who get all twitchy and have actual physical reactions to <br/>
math, whose head starts to hurt just thinking about it, whose eyes glaze over <br/>
and who physically turn their heads away when something looks mathy, who have <br/>
such a strong reaction to it that they KNOW they are anxious about it - those <br/>
are just the tip of a HUGE iceberg. Most math-anxious people don&#39;t have such <br/>
strong physical or emotional reactions. Most just sort of shut down when math <br/>
is brought up. &quot;I understand math okay, I just don&#39;t like it much.&quot; &quot;I just <br/>
mostly avoid math.&quot; &quot;I did fine in math, but never felt like I really <br/>
understood it.&quot; &quot;I liked arithmetic until we got to algebra.&quot; These are all <br/>
indications of math anxiety, too. It is truly epidemic. <br/>
<br/>
2. I have come to believe that MOST adults suffer from enough math anxiety <br/>
that it holds them back and prevents them from understanding things they <br/>
ought to understand, prevents them from choosing careers or hobbies that <br/>
they&#39;d really enjoy, encourages them to leave significant technical decisions <br/>
to other people, disempowers people - makes them feel powerless and slightly <br/>
overwhelmed by the world around them, leaves them unable to intelligently <br/>
consider statistical data so they either give too much credence to it (become <br/>
gullible) or too little (say things like, &quot;statistics can prove anything&quot; and <br/>
completely ignore all quantitative evidence JUST because it is quantitative).<br/>
<br/>
3. IT IS NOT THEIR FAULT. Those of us with less math anxiety are mostly just <br/>
lucky!!! Some of us are just extra contrary - I RECOGNIZED, for example, that <br/>
I was being more or less &quot;programmed&quot; to think I couldn&#39;t do or understand <br/>
math, that it was too hard and too much work and that girls, especially, <br/>
ought to just do their best but not expect too much from themselves. I was <br/>
lucky that I had a quiet, but very contrary and stubborn, nature AND that I <br/>
was in high school in the 60&#39;s and had a feminist math teacher. I wasn&#39;t <br/>
going to let &quot;the establishment&quot; keep me from doing something just because I <br/>
was a GIRL - so I mentally battled all the math anxiety that I had (and I DID <br/>
have a fair amount - especially the kind that says, &quot;You&#39;re a fake, you&#39;re <br/>
just memorizing how to do this stuff and you don&#39;t relly understand it and <br/>
one of these days they&#39;re going to FIND YOU OUT and you&#39;ll be humiliated.&quot;) <br/>
Because I worked hard at overcoming the tidal wave of reasons I shouldn&#39;t <br/>
understand math, and because I got labeled (by friends and family) as being <br/>
&quot;good at math,&quot; I just kept trying to understand - out of FEAR of being <br/>
shamed and of letting people down. So I pushed through it - but very very few <br/>
people did. Neither of my sisters survived school unscathed by extreme math <br/>
anxiety. Both men and women suffer from it. All this math anxiety is not <br/>
&quot;natural.&quot; It was and is still being caused by schools.<br/>
<br/>
4. The problem is what is taught. Let me ask you a couple of questions. <br/>
<br/>
Fill in the blank. A negative number multiplied by another negative number <br/>
gives a _________  answer. (positive) If you know this - can you explain why <br/>
it is true?<br/>
<br/>
To change a decimal number to a percentage, what do you do with the decimal <br/>
point? (.75 becomes 75% -- you move the decimal point two places to the <br/>
right.) Can you easily and quickly explain why?<br/>
<br/>
How do you divide one fraction by another one? Invert and multiply. So (1/2 <br/>
divided by 1/4) is (1/2 times 4/1) which is 4/2 or 2. What? Dividing one <br/>
fraction by another one gives you a number bigger than either of those you <br/>
started with? Why?<br/>
<br/>
If you can DO these but not explain them, you&#39;re a victim of school math. (If <br/>
you refused to even have a look at them - if you skimmed right past the <br/>
little math questions and didn&#39;t let yourself even try to think about them, <br/>
you&#39;re a victim of school math, too.) If you could explain them, you are one <br/>
of the very very few adults who can and I&#39;d be interested in hearing from you <br/>
about how you did get through school with this ability.<br/>
<br/>
I can read Italian - I can read it with a pretty darn good accent, even. <br/>
Someone taught me the pronunciation &quot;rules&quot; and I can do it well. I don&#39;t <br/>
understand more than a tiny fraction of what I&#39;m reading and I know I&#39;m <br/>
almost entirely faking it and it is a worthless skill for me to have (maybe <br/>
unless I&#39;m an opera singer) and if I read aloud in Italian to Italians they&#39;d <br/>
discover I was a fake right away (probably by the mistakes in my intonation - <br/>
I&#39;d put emphasis in the wrong places in the sentences since I don&#39;t <br/>
understand what I&#39;m reading.)<br/>
<br/>
Schools actually TEACH kids to do math in an equivalent way. They teach rules <br/>
to follow, they teach HOW to do arithmetic, to kids who don&#39;t understand what <br/>
they&#39;re doing - the kids practice adding and subtracting, multiplying and <br/>
dividing, reducing fractions and finding &quot;greatest common factors&quot; and <br/>
working with negative numbers and all the rest of that - as if learning the <br/>
rules for manipulating numbers was the same as learning math. That is no more <br/>
true than learning the rules for pronouncing Italian words is the same as <br/>
learning the Italian language. <br/>
<br/>
5. The problem is also WHEN stuff is taught.<br/>
Kids need to develop their math understanding - to have opportunities to <br/>
develop understanding of concepts - before they learn computation rules and <br/>
methods. They need to learn techniques at the right time - when the need <br/>
comes up as a natural outgrowth of fooling with the concepts. If they haven&#39;t <br/>
really given any thought yet to what happens and what it really means when <br/>
dividing one fraction by another fraction, but, because it is on the school <br/>
schedule, they are taught to divide one fraction by another by inverting and <br/>
multiplying, then that&#39;s it - they move on to something else. They may or may <br/>
not remember the technique later (since it was taught out of context and <br/>
before they could understand why it works) and they likely will never ever <br/>
again think about what is really happening when dividing one fraction by <br/>
another fraction. They never developed or investigated the concept, but <br/>
they&#39;ve &quot;learned&quot; how to do it (whatever IT really is - they don&#39;t really <br/>
know) and few people will EVER really consider the question again - <br/>
especially since most will have developed significant math anxiety by that <br/>
time or shortly thereafter and will NOT think pondering what dividing one <br/>
fraction by another really means is any fun at all. <br/>
<br/>
More to come - I&#39;ve run out of time this morning.....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d REALLY like to hear your comments on these ideas, including your own <br/>
experiences.<br/>

gullible) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Even people&#39;s own personal logic suffers because once it starts to feel like <br/>
math in their heads, they shut it out.<br/>
<br/>
Just today at www.unschooling.com someone anonymous (using another name) who <br/>
might or might not be here said that as a pre-school teacher it is her <br/>
experience that kids who watch TV  are less attentive, less independently <br/>
imaginative, and have a need to be entertained.<br/>
<br/>
Why didn&#39;t it occur to her that a child who&#39;s not into schooly stuff, who <br/>
isn&#39;t very imaginative or independent and would like to be entertained could <br/>
get a lot of benefit out of TV?<br/>
<br/>
Nope.  Pre-formed opinions and prejudices, and a lack of clarity about cause <br/>
and effect led to an inability to rearrange factors and to explore <br/>
possibilities.   <br/>
<br/>
I have number phobias, but I&#39;m not bad with word-logic, or &quot;word problems.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had quit reading Pam&#39;s post halfway through, with this one written up to <br/>
the line above this, and helped Holly set up an apple crisp recipe (now in <br/>
the oven).  We didn&#39;t have the right two dishes, so used three small dishes, <br/>
which made me figure we should double the topping recipe.  She was right on <br/>
that, no problem.   I said something about two times 1/4, and she told me it <br/>
would be easier if I just said two fourths.    That&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
So I was in here typing the paragraph above, and halfway through Holly came <br/>
in with a question (and I took notes, on the pretense of needing to write it <br/>
down to be clear, but really I was excited and didn&#39;t want to forget it to <br/>
tell you guys).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is two times twelve the same as twelve times two?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is it like that with everything?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I wrote it down and asked her what she meant by &quot;everything.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She wondered if all multiplication was like that. <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t name any mathematical rules or principles by name, no commutatives <br/>
or anything.  What I said was some multiplication was really cool, like 1/2 <br/>
of 12 was the same as twelve halves.  I used the example of measuring flour <br/>
if you only had a 1/2 cup measure.  <br/>
<br/>
She had interrupted by then though, and said &quot;Like flipping a coin twelve <br/>
times instead of flipping twelve coins one time!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She understands it better than I do.<br/>
<br/>
I told her in addition and multiplication you could switch either way, but <br/>
not with subtraction--<br/>
<br/>
I showed her a number line and that 3-1 isn&#39;t the same as 1-3, but that <br/>
they&#39;re equivalent distances, and the absolute number is the same (the answer <br/>
is &quot;two&quot; both times, the only difference is whether it&#39;s plus or minus two).  <br/>
 She was ahead of me on that too.<br/>
<br/>
Not bad for five minutes!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-46956679">Thanks, for this post! My husband has been reluctant to let go of alot of<br/>
the schoolish ways even though he now hates math and hates to read. He even<br/>
had guidance counselors and teachers tell him not to bother with college<br/>
because he wasn&#39;t cut out for it. I am going to print out your post and have<br/>
him read it! He has loosened up a lot lately, but not enough. He is just<br/>
afraid that they won&#39;t learn enough math or be good enough readers if we<br/>
don&#39;t make them do it. They were both at &quot;high school reading level&quot; when we<br/>
pulled them out of elementary school, so I don&#39;t know why he is worried<br/>
about their reading abilities.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;How do you divide one fraction by another one? Invert and multiply. So (1/2<br/>

&gt;understand more than a tiny fraction of what I&#39;m reading and I know I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;almost entirely faking it and it is a worthless skill for me to have (maybe<br/>

 </span></blockquote>what<br/>

&gt;dividing, reducing fractions and finding &quot;greatest common factors&quot; and<br/>

&gt;5. The problem is also WHEN stuff is taught.<br/>
&gt;Kids need to develop their math understanding - to have opportunities to<br/>
&gt;develop understanding of concepts - before they learn computation rules and<br/>
&gt;methods. They need to learn techniques at the right time - when the need<br/>
&gt;comes up as a natural outgrowth of fooling with the concepts. If they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>haven&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;really given any thought yet to what happens and what it really means when<br/>
&gt;dividing one fraction by another fraction, but, because it is on the school<br/>
&gt;schedule, they are taught to divide one fraction by another by inverting<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;multiplying, then that&#39;s it - they move on to something else. They may or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>may<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;not remember the technique later (since it was taught out of context and<br/>
&gt;before they could understand why it works) and they likely will never ever<br/>
&gt;again think about what is really happening when dividing one fraction by<br/>
&gt;another fraction. They never developed or investigated the concept, but<br/>
&gt;they&#39;ve &quot;learned&quot; how to do it (whatever IT really is - they don&#39;t really<br/>
&gt;know) and few people will EVER really consider the question again -<br/>
&gt;especially since most will have developed significant math anxiety by that<br/>
&gt;time or shortly thereafter and will NOT think pondering what dividing one<br/>
&gt;fraction by another really means is any fun at all.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;More to come - I&#39;ve run out of time this morning.....<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d REALLY like to hear your comments on these ideas, including your own<br/>
&gt;experiences.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465828495">Back to square one:  One squared is One ....<br/>
<br/>
I know that I have significant holes in my math confidence - and<br/>
they fall in precisely those places that for some reason had not<br/>
come up in my &quot;real life&quot; before they were muddied up in school.<br/>
I remember, at about age 3, hearing the story of the man who<br/>
tricked the Emperor of China - with a chess board and some rice.<br/>
The Schtick is that the Emperor was to put one grain of rice on<br/>
the first square of the chess board, 2 on the next, then 4, then<br/>
16 - squaring the number of grains for each of the 64 squares.  I<br/>
made it all the way across the first row (counting the square<br/>
obligingly given me by me grandfather, before I understood that<br/>
it worked).  A couple of years later, we had an adding machine in<br/>
the house (dating myself here).  My father casually mentioned<br/>
that all the multiples of nine had digits that added up to a<br/>
multiple of nine.  I probably went through a case of machine tape<br/>
exploring that wonder.  And there were always puzzle books<br/>
around, written at various grade levels, but full of the<br/>
mysteries of how a theorem is proved and what you can do to<br/>
calculate how high you threw a ball, with nothing more<br/>
significant than a 45 degree angle made by folding the corner of<br/>
a piece of typing paper and 2 drinking straws to view along.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I am clueless about percentages - at home we<br/>
just converted fractions to decimals and went on without thinking<br/>
about 30% increase, so when that mess was crammed into my head,<br/>
it found no where to live.  But the math that I acquired<br/>
naturally, because it was waaaay cool - or because I needed it to<br/>
get where I was headed stuck with me forever.  So go back to<br/>
squaring one with math trivia and puzzle books and maybe with a<br/>
truly math literate friend who will see the math word play<br/>
immediately.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; You can &quot;make&quot; a child &quot;do math.&quot;  They do it all<br/>
&gt; the time in school.<br/>
&gt; That<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; means you can cause them by threat or force or<br/>
&gt; shame or whatever to sit<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; put numbers on a piece of paper.  But they&#39;re not<br/>
&gt; really doing anything<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; themselves, and you can make them loathe numbers<br/>
&gt; on paper.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I have fairly recently come to an even more radical<br/>
&gt; new understanding of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;harm that is done by having kids doing school math<br/>
&gt; throughout their<br/>
&gt; &gt;elementary school years. I&#39;ve been tutoring several<br/>
&gt; high school age kids<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;several adults, individually, to help them get<br/>
&gt; ready for various exams that<br/>
&gt; &gt;they want to take (CHSPE and CBEST and SAT).<br/>
&gt; Several things have really<br/>
&gt; &gt;struck me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;1. Anxiety about math, anxiety that started in<br/>
&gt; primary or secondary school,<br/>
&gt; &gt;is REALLY TRULY something that blocks intelligent,<br/>
&gt; motivated peoples&#39;<br/>
&gt; brains<br/>
&gt; &gt;from being able to learn. Even anxiety that only<br/>
&gt; appears to be a bit mild,<br/>
&gt; &gt;even anxiety that people don&#39;t recognize as<br/>
&gt; anxiety, has a HUGE blocking<br/>
&gt; &gt;affect. People who get all twitchy and have actual<br/>
&gt; physical reactions to<br/>
&gt; &gt;math, whose head starts to hurt just thinking about<br/>
&gt; it, whose eyes glaze<br/>
&gt; over<br/>
&gt; &gt;and who physically turn their heads away when<br/>
&gt; something looks mathy, who<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt;such a strong reaction to it that they KNOW they<br/>
&gt; are anxious about it -<br/>
&gt; those<br/>
&gt; &gt;are just the tip of a HUGE iceberg. Most<br/>
&gt; math-anxious people don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; such<br/>
&gt; &gt;strong physical or emotional reactions. Most just<br/>
&gt; sort of shut down when<br/>
&gt; math<br/>
&gt; &gt;is brought up. &quot;I understand math okay, I just<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like it much.&quot; &quot;I just<br/>
&gt; &gt;mostly avoid math.&quot; &quot;I did fine in math, but never<br/>
&gt; felt like I really<br/>
&gt; &gt;understood it.&quot; &quot;I liked arithmetic until we got to<br/>
&gt; algebra.&quot; These are all<br/>
&gt; &gt;indications of math anxiety, too. It is truly<br/>
&gt; epidemic.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2. I have come to believe that MOST adults suffer<br/>
&gt; from enough math anxiety<br/>
&gt; &gt;that it holds them back and prevents them from<br/>
&gt; understanding things they<br/>
&gt; &gt;ought to understand, prevents them from choosing<br/>
&gt; careers or hobbies that<br/>
&gt; &gt;they&#39;d really enjoy, encourages them to leave<br/>
&gt; significant technical<br/>
&gt; decisions<br/>
&gt; &gt;to other people, disempowers people - makes them<br/>
&gt; feel powerless and<br/>
&gt; slightly<br/>
&gt; &gt;overwhelmed by the world around them, leaves them<br/>
&gt; unable to intelligently<br/>
&gt; &gt;consider statistical data so they either give too<br/>
&gt; much credence to it<br/>
&gt; (become<br/>
&gt; &gt;gullible) or too little (say things like,<br/>
&gt; &quot;statistics can prove anything&quot;<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;completely ignore all quantitative evidence JUST<br/>
&gt; because it is<br/>
&gt; quantitative).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3. IT IS NOT THEIR FAULT. Those of us with less<br/>
&gt; math anxiety are mostly<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt;lucky!!! Some of us are just extra contrary - I<br/>
&gt; RECOGNIZED, for example,<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt;I was being more or less &quot;programmed&quot; to think I<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t do or understand<br/>
&gt; &gt;math, that it was too hard and too much work and<br/>
&gt; that girls, especially,<br/>
&gt; &gt;ought to just do their best but not expect too much<br/>
&gt; from themselves. I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;lucky that I had a quiet, but very contrary and<br/>
&gt; stubborn, nature AND that I<br/>
&gt; &gt;was in high school in the 60&#39;s and had a feminist<br/>
&gt; math teacher. I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;going to let &quot;the establishment&quot; keep me from doing<br/>
&gt; something just because<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt;was a GIRL - so I mentally battled all the math<br/>
&gt; anxiety that I had (and I<br/>
&gt; DID<br/>
&gt; &gt;have a fair amount - especially the kind that says,<br/>
&gt; &quot;You&#39;re a fake, you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt;just memorizing how to do this stuff and you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; relly understand it and<br/>
&gt; &gt;one of these days they&#39;re going to FIND YOU OUT and<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll be humiliated.&quot;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;Because I worked hard at overcoming the tidal wave<br/>
&gt; of reasons I shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;understand math, and because I got labeled (by<br/>
&gt; friends and family) as being<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;good at math,&quot; I just kept trying to understand -<br/>
&gt; out of FEAR of being<br/>
&gt; &gt;shamed and of letting people down. So I pushed<br/>
&gt; through it - but very very<br/>
&gt; few<br/>
&gt; &gt;people did. Neither of my sisters survived school<br/>
&gt; unscathed by extreme math<br/>
&gt; &gt;anxiety. Both men and women suffer from it. All<br/>
&gt; this math anxiety is not<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;natural.&quot; It was and is still being caused by<br/>
&gt; schools.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;4. The problem is what is taught. Let me ask you a<br/>
&gt; couple of questions.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Fill in the blank. A negative number multiplied by<br/>
&gt; another negative number<br/>
&gt; &gt;gives a _________  answer. (positive) If you know<br/>
&gt; this - can you explain<br/>
&gt; why<br/>
&gt; &gt;it is true?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;To change a decimal number to a percentage, what do<br/>
&gt; you do with the decimal<br/>
&gt; &gt;point? (.75 becomes 75% -- you move the decimal<br/>
&gt; point two places to the<br/>
&gt; &gt;right.) Can you easily and quickly explain why?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;How do you divide one fraction by another one?<br/>
&gt; Invert and multiply. So (1/2<br/>
&gt; &gt;divided by 1/4) is (1/2 times 4/1) which is 4/2 or<br/>
&gt; 2. What? Dividing one<br/>
&gt; &gt;fraction by another one gives you a number bigger<br/>
&gt; than either of those you<br/>
&gt; &gt;started with? Why?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If you can DO these but not explain them, you&#39;re a<br/>
&gt; victim of school math.<br/>
&gt; (If<br/>
&gt; &gt;you refused to even have a look at them - if you<br/>
&gt; skimmed right past the<br/>
&gt; &gt;little math questions and didn&#39;t let yourself even<br/>
&gt; try to think about them,<br/>
&gt; &gt;you&#39;re a victim of school math, too.) If you could<br/>
&gt; explain them, you are<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt;of the very very few adults who can and I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; interested in hearing from<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt;about how you did get through school with this<br/>
&gt; ability.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I can read Italian - I can read it with a pretty<br/>
&gt; darn good accent, even.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Someone taught me the pronunciation &quot;rules&quot; and I<br/>
&gt; can do it well. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;understand more than a tiny fraction of what I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; reading and I know I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;almost entirely faking it and it is a worthless<br/>
&gt; skill for me to have (maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt;unless I&#39;m an opera singer) and if I read aloud in<br/>
&gt; Italian to Italians<br/>
&gt; they&#39;d<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738705732">I love this!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sitting here thinking about my eight year old boy who figured that nine <br/>
thing out by himself.  I was amazed.  I had forgotten about it and was just <br/>
busily trying to teach &quot;multiplication tables.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In fact, Johnny (my ds) led me back to unschooling in a way.  This child <br/>
always has just been comfortable with numbers, in a way I never was.  But, <br/>
when I started having him do worksheets and lessons in math, he froze up.  <br/>
Writing down the numbers that just made sense to him in his head made <br/>
absolutely no sense to him.<br/>
<br/>
He actually chuckled sometimes at the ridiculousness of the problems the math <br/>
book was asking him to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Boy, did it ever take me a long time to wake up.<br/>
<br/>
I really loved the idea about the chessboard and grains of rice. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-774838476">I mostly teach percentages by getting in discussions when we hear them. <br/>
How many times have you heard 40% off at a sale and think &quot;what a great <br/>
deal&quot;. As my 11 yo dd said, &quot;aren&#39;t you still giving them money? So how <br/>
are you SAVING anything?&quot; The answer is, you&#39;re not. 40% off is still <br/>
60% on.  Just remember that the little % sign has two zeros for the two <br/>
zeros in 100. Percentages are just parts of one hundred.<br/>
<br/>
And when someone throws statistics at you, remember what Mark Twain <br/>
said: &quot;there are lies, damn lies, and statistics&quot;. Always think about <br/>
the point of the statistic, and then think if it makes sense. Then look <br/>
at the numbers.<br/>

&gt; Back to square one:  One squared is One ....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know that I have significant holes in my math confidence - and<br/>
&gt; they fall in precisely those places that for some reason had not<br/>
&gt; come up in my &quot;real life&quot; before they were muddied up in school.<br/>
&gt; I remember, at about age 3, hearing the story of the man who<br/>
&gt; tricked the Emperor of China - with a chess board and some rice.<br/>
&gt; The Schtick is that the Emperor was to put one grain of rice on<br/>
&gt; the first square of the chess board, 2 on the next, then 4, then<br/>
&gt; 16 - squaring the number of grains for each of the 64 squares.  I<br/>
&gt; made it all the way across the first row (counting the square<br/>
&gt; obligingly given me by me grandfather, before I understood that<br/>
&gt; it worked).  A couple of years later, we had an adding machine in<br/>
&gt; the house (dating myself here).  My father casually mentioned<br/>
&gt; that all the multiples of nine had digits that added up to a<br/>
&gt; multiple of nine.  I probably went through a case of machine tape<br/>
&gt; exploring that wonder.  And there were always puzzle books<br/>
&gt; around, written at various grade levels, but full of the<br/>
&gt; mysteries of how a theorem is proved and what you can do to<br/>
&gt; calculate how high you threw a ball, with nothing more<br/>
&gt; significant than a 45 degree angle made by folding the corner of<br/>
&gt; a piece of typing paper and 2 drinking straws to view along.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the other hand, I am clueless about percentages - at home we<br/>
&gt; just converted fractions to decimals and went on without thinking<br/>
&gt; about 30% increase, so when that mess was crammed into my head,<br/>
&gt; it found no where to live.  But the math that I acquired<br/>
&gt; naturally, because it was waaaay cool - or because I needed it to<br/>
&gt; get where I was headed stuck with me forever.  So go back to<br/>
&gt; squaring one with math trivia and puzzle books and maybe with a<br/>
&gt; truly math literate friend who will see the math word play<br/>
&gt; immediately.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Math (was diapers/ was<br/>
&gt; curriculum)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; | I went to Jr. High in the era of &quot;individualized instruction.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Which meant,<br/>
&gt; | in our school anyway, that we each had headphones, a cassette<br/>
&gt; tape set and a<br/>
&gt; | workbook.  We did SRA Math and we could listen to a tape over<br/>
&gt; and over and<br/>
&gt; | then take the test as many times as we wanted.  When we got a C<br/>
&gt; or higher, we<br/>
&gt; | moved on to the next test.<br/>
&gt; |<br/>
&gt; | So, I memorized what I had to for each unit and that was it.<br/>
&gt; By the time I<br/>
&gt; | got to college math, I was seriously phobic because I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; understand<br/>
&gt; | anything.   And all I cared about was getting a good enough<br/>
&gt; grade to stay in<br/>
&gt; | my major.  I took statistics and probability for my Psych<br/>
&gt; major, and had to<br/>
&gt; | take it twice.  Then, when I realized I was going to have to<br/>
&gt; take Advanced<br/>
&gt; | Stats, I was terrified.  I hired a tutor and all I told him<br/>
&gt; was...I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; | care about theory or why this stuff is done.  All I want to do<br/>
&gt; is get a B or<br/>
&gt; | a C and be done with this.  And that was the last formal math<br/>
&gt; experience I<br/>
&gt; | ever had.<br/>
&gt; |<br/>
&gt; | Until teaching my children.  And doing with them the same thing<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d had<br/>
&gt; | &quot;done&quot; to me, because I wasn&#39;t sure any other way to go about<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; |<br/>
&gt; | I&#39;m still not sure how to get to that &quot;informal&quot; place where I<br/>
&gt; can explore<br/>
&gt; | the fascination of math with my kids, because I don&#39;t even know<br/>
&gt; where that<br/>
&gt; | place is.  I had to laugh when I read Pam&#39;s little quiz and the<br/>
&gt; notes<br/>
&gt; | underneath about the person who just skimmed through the<br/>
&gt; problems and tried<br/>
&gt; | to ignore them.  That&#39;s me to a tee.<br/>
&gt; |<br/>
&gt; | So, I feel in between a rock and a hard place with this<br/>
&gt; subject.  I<br/>
&gt; | understand the drawbacks you and others have pointed out about<br/>
&gt; &quot;teaching<br/>
&gt; | math.&quot;  But, I know it&#39;s not good to ignore the subject either<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m afraid<br/>
&gt; | that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do.  How do we make it fun again...start at<br/>
&gt; square one?  And<br/>
&gt; | where exactly is that?<br/>
&gt; |<br/>
&gt; | Math Phobic to the max...<br/>
