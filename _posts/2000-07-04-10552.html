&lt;&lt; We seem to have so much &#39;stuff&#39;<br/>
 I don&#39;t have enough space or storage for it all. The result is<br/>
 piles of &#39;stuff&#39; which make the place look more untidy and also<br/>
 make it harder to clean or vacuum without a great big upheaval. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is definately a problem I&#39;m having... Resolved some of it buying <br/>
containers and putting toys in that are definately not being used, put them <br/>
in the garage and rotate those containers for Zak every other week... It <br/>
seems to have helped, although the garage is overflowing now.  One of my <br/>
friends who also homeschools got rid of a lot of her daughter&#39;s toys as she <br/>
didn&#39;t seem to play with certain things and noticed that she didn&#39;t miss <br/>
them.  I&#39;m sort of reluctant to do that because of having the 9 month old and <br/>
who knows what he&#39;ll want to play with.  Right now he&#39;s more interested in <br/>
cruising around the couches and picking up Zak&#39;s trains (must to Zak&#39;s <br/>
annoyance).<br/>
<br/>
Guess I&#39;ll just learn to live with it until they are much older.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054411989">Dear Stella,<br/>
My hubby and I just moved in April.  Two weeks before the move, I explained <br/>
to my 3yr old about children that do not have things, like clothes, toys, <br/>
dishes ect.   Then I told her we were cleaning house and giving away <br/>
everything we have not used in 6months, have duplicates of, or are just tired <br/>
of looking at.  We gave away 16boxes of things and a coffee table.  You know <br/>
what!?  I have no clue what is in those boxes, but they were full.  IT FELT <br/>
SOOOO GOOD to get rid of all that stuff!  I started one room at a time and <br/>
once the box was closed.  That was it, we did not look back in them.  I did <br/>
this at nap time, play time....the kids loved playing in the boxes....<br/>

Hi Julie,<br/>
Your ideas sound good.<br/>
I would feel happy getting rid of the kids stuff if they were<br/>
happy to get rid of it.<br/>
My problem is that when I suggest getting rid of things to my<br/>
children, they agree and when we start looking thorugh the things<br/>
they want to keep it all.<br/>
I don&#39;t feel happy about going through it while they are asleep<br/>
and deciding to get rid of it.<br/>
I would hate it if someone went through my things and chucked<br/>
some of it without me knowing.<br/>
i think my only way forward is to tidy up what we already have<br/>
and for me to clear up MY piles of paperwork and books and lead<br/>
by example I think.<br/>
I do feel a lot more positive since I have read the mails from<br/>
you great people on this list.<br/>
thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The side (streaky) bacon over here ( N.A.)  is generally smoked and<br/>
sweeter than English bacon. In Canada quite often it is maple flavoured<br/>
or more expensive but better is maple smoked with real maple wood.<br/>
I have a 15 min walk to a real Scottish butcher ( family name of Opie )<br/>
who have real oatmeal (not rolled oats), proper suet for Xmas puddings<br/>
and mincemeat , pork pies, and black budding and Cadbury chocolate from<br/>
Britain ( our Canadian made Cadbury chocolate tastes terrible).<br/>
I can also buy golden syrup and Vegemite locally too.<br/>
We have access to good tea (Twinnings).<br/>
We used to have Marks and Spencers but they had to shut down last year<br/>
:-( .... no decent place to buy biscuits now except one more expensive<br/>
store ... can&#39;t find Bourbon biscuits or good ginger snaps easily now.<br/>
<br/>
High British immigrant population here in Hamilton,Ontario.<br/>
Actually pretty decent British immigrant population in Southern Ontario<br/>
and most major cities in Canada.<br/>

I&#39;m very envious and may have to take a trip to Canada just for the bacon and <br/>
pork pies.  My brother became a Canadian citizen and lived in Nova Scotia fo <br/>

I understand your reservation about boxing up your childrens things about <br/>
while they are sleeping.  However, I did it with the thought in mind that if <br/>
my dd asked for anything specific out of the boxes I would get it back out.  <br/>
In two weeks, she asked for nothing so off they went to the needy.  Then I <br/>
told her that the toys that were left we needed to divide into two groups; <br/>
one stayed out to play and the other went in the box to come out in a couple <br/>
of weeks.  BTW, she did not miss those either.  There is now so much more <br/>
room for her to get down on the floor to play and less for us to clean up....<br/>

<br/>
We are planning of being in England next summer, so I might take you up on <br/>
that Tracy... I&#39;ve never been to Yorkshire... Sad really when you come to <br/>
think of it... Maybe it&#39;s because England was always there and so I didn&#39;t <br/>
travel around it very much until I married an American and became a tourist.  <br/>
I&#39;ve also never been to Scotland, Ireland or Wales...  Yorkshire (from the <br/>
photos I&#39;ve seen) looks beautiful.  I&#39;ve only been as far as Derbyshire, <br/>
which is where my mother&#39;s family comes from.  Her bio parents come from <br/>
Manchester.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure which part of the pig the bacon comes from here.  Maybe an <br/>
American will be able to answer that.  All I know is that I buy Canadian <br/>
Bacon if I was close to the &quot;real stuff&quot;... Steve and I really miss going to <br/>
the local butchers in the village and getting our meat fresh and also those <br/>
wonderful pork pies.<br/>

It is * pickled * in brine only. It should look raw when you buy it. In<br/>
Canada if you go into a grocery store it is sold as Peameal bacon as it<br/>
is coated in cornmeal before it is sliced. Why it&#39;s called pea meal I<br/>
don&#39;t know. I suspect it&#39;s because all ground corn and peas were called<br/>
meal long long ago.<br/>
I prefer German Speck when I can get the stuff from the German butcher&#39;s<br/>
in their reduced cold foods section. Only reason it&#39;s there is because<br/>
it was sliced the day before which won&#39;t hurt a well smoked bacon anyway<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;         1       Gallon          Water<br/>
&gt;         3/4     Cup             Honey<br/>
&gt;         1/4     Cup             Sugar<br/>
&gt;         1/2     Cup             Tender Quick<br/>
&gt;         1/2     Cup             Kosher Salt<br/>
&gt;         1       Ea.             Boneless Pork Loin<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Preparation: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Add the dry ingredients to the water and bring to a boil. Allow to completely cool, then put<br/>
&gt; mixture in the icebox, until very cold - usually over night. Take the cure and load your pump<br/>
&gt; and inject it to about 10% of the weight of the loin. I have tried just soaking the loin with<br/>
&gt; the cure and it wasn&#39;t as good as it is when injected. Get a good metal meat pump, I have a<br/>
&gt; old one that holds five ounces. A cup of cure weighs about roughly a half a pound if you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have a scale. If you have a five pound loin you will need to inject eight ounces (one<br/>
&gt; cup) of mix. Place in a bag and pour remaining cure over the loin to cover, close the bag up<br/>
&gt; and tie it. Try to remove as much air as you can from the bag. Place bag in pan and put in<br/>
&gt; the bottom of fridge. You want to make sure that you keep the temperature between 35°<br/>
&gt; and 40°. Do not allow to get above 40° or to freeze. You can allow to cure for as little as two<br/>
&gt; days and as much as five. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I take them out after three days. Wash them and wash them again and just for drill, do it<br/>
&gt; again.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here ends the Canadian part. Now it is ready to freeze or slice and fry<br/>
in a little oil as it is very lean. The honey and sugar part I don&#39;t<br/>
think are quite accurate from a Canadian view point. Our Canadian<br/>
peameal bacon has no sweetness to it.<br/>
<br/>
The rest is for smoking it , which sounds pretty tasty too!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Dry it off and place on smoker at 160° and light smoke for about 3 hours and them<br/>
&gt; crank the temperature up to 225°. Pull it off the smoker when the temperature is 160°<br/>
&gt; internal, or whatever you feel is safe. Allow to cool back down and then place in the fridge.<br/>
&gt; It is now ready to eat, so enjoy it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you cut a loin in half or use two loins, you can pull one and cook it after two days of<br/>
&gt; curing. This way you can know how salty it is after just two days, if you like it pull the other<br/>
&gt; one out and smoke it. Apple and hickory is what I prefer for the smoking wood. Another<br/>
&gt; twist to this recipe is to drop the coriander and substitute the honey with Dr Pepper syrup.<br/>
&gt; Before you try the DP in this recipe, spray or baste some ribs when you cook them with Dr<br/>
&gt; Pepper. That way you will have an idea what taste you&#39;ll get. We like it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
