have 2 kids, 3 y.o. girl and 5 y.o. boy.  There is no official start to <br/>
homeschooling of course, but I arbitrarily set the date we started <br/>
unschooling as the morning when I showed them a spider in a web in our dining <br/>
room.  I caught a fly and sent it into the web for the spider&#39;s breakfast and <br/>
they were fascinated.<br/>
       Actually from the reading I&#39;ve done on the subject of Unitarian <br/>
history, I believe the word &quot;Unitarian&quot; comes from the theology of the <br/>
original church when they broke from the mainstream Christian churches in <br/>
Transylvania in the late 1600&#39;s.  They believed in God as a single entity, <br/>
not three different ones, hence the word Uni-tarian.  The idea of the trinity <br/>
solidified in the 6th century I think and various Christians have challenged <br/>
it, claiming it is not based directly on scripture.<br/>
       Unitarians, by the way, suffered greatly for their beliefs and perhaps <br/>
because of that were tolerant of other sects and religions.  Several early <br/>
Americans were Unitarian, including Thomas Jefferson, who also rejected the <br/>
divinity of Christ.  I haven&#39;t read much on this, but Unitarians&#39; tolerance <br/>
possibly inspired the founding fathers to adopt religious tolerance as an <br/>
important ingredient of U.S. democracy.<br/>
       The UU Church (Unitarian Universalist) is not officially Christian, <br/>
but some members are believers or are very sympathetic to Christian ideas in <br/>
general.  In our religious education we draw on other faiths a lot and even <br/>
have the young people attend services at other churches and temples, <br/>
including Buddhist, Muslim, etc.  Occaisionally members object to readings <br/>
from the bible during service but I do not - I like it.  I am personally a <br/>
devout agnostic.<br/>
<br/>
       I&#39;ve been enjoying the list but have found I have to be awfully quick <br/>
with the delete button or I spend more than an hour doing this.  Nice to meet <br/>
you all.<br/>
<br/>
