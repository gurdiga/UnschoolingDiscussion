<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hi folks...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am getting on the planning for the New England Live and Learn Conference in<br/>
&gt; 2004. It looks like it will probably be in August, but the exact dates and<br/>
&gt; location aren&#39;t final yet. In the meantime, I have a few questions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>WOW, you&#39;re efficient!  Didn&#39;t we just talk about maybe you would do this a<br/>
few weeks ago?  Amazing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Picture your fantasy Unschooling conference. What workshops would it have?<br/>
&gt; What speakers would absolutely motivate you to come?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>David Albert.  I&#39;m never in the same town he&#39;s speaking at, and I keep<br/>
wanting to hear him.  Also the guy that Sandra does that really neat<br/>
workshop that she sent me the tape of.....ummmm......Sandra, please help, I<br/>
can&#39;t find his name in my head right now.  He was Jewish, and taking about<br/>
questioning.  The tape was facinating, I want more.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If there were a few extra things your family could sign up for that had an<br/>
&gt; extra fee (like a whale watch) would you like that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YES!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; And would you like one (again optional, again with an additional fee)<br/>
&gt; Conference dinner or lunch planned?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like the casual style that you can move about at, rather than the<br/>
trap-you-at-a-table-with-the-same-7-people kind.  But having chances to get<br/>
together with food could be good.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a idea that just popped into my head, but it might be truly<br/>
infeasible.  What about making reservations at a few nearby restaurants for<br/>
10 people or so, and it could be first come, first sign up for dinner.<br/>
That might be good for people who don&#39;t know folks to get to eat with some<br/>
other interesting unschoolers.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks....I&#39;m getting excited about this!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re wonderful, Kathryn!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; location aren&#39;t final yet. In the meantime, I have a few questions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a question - why is the conference in August? We usually try not to<br/>
do any big traveling in the summer when all the people who are slaves to the<br/>
school schedule are doing so. Airfare is often more expensive (we&#39;d be<br/>
coming from the other side of the country), and to be honest, for people<br/>
from a temperate climate, the eastern seaboard heat and humidity and pretty<br/>
off-setting at that time of year. Is there any reason the unschooling<br/>
conference can&#39;t be in, say, late September? Better weather, less<br/>
travelers...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Picture your fantasy Unschooling conference. What workshops would it<br/>

&gt; David Albert.  I&#39;m never in the same town he&#39;s speaking at, and I keep<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll second that recommendation. Just got to hear him talk last week and he<br/>
is really a great speaker and very thought-provoking. Our homeschooling<br/>
group parents are still discussing it. And his second book looks really<br/>
great too. I didn&#39;t buy a copy and I&#39;m now regretting it. Need to save up<br/>
some more sock money :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to get a chance to hear Sandra (of course). Ummmm, since we&#39;re<br/>
dreaming, maybe John Taylor Gatto? Reviving John Holt from the great beyond?<br/>
:-)<br/>
I&#39;d love to have some kind of panel with several older unschoolers and their<br/>
parents, just to get an idea of the direction we&#39;re headed in. Or maybe even<br/>
ones of several different age groups as what interests me now most are the<br/>
years that lie directly ahead of us (8 - 12) instead of the teenage years.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; extra fee (like a whale watch) would you like that?<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; And would you like one (again optional, again with an additional fee)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Conference dinner or lunch planned?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, or even a potluck. Something casual for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really bumming that we can&#39;t make the conference this year, so I&#39;m<br/>
holding out hope for next year, though August is always a hard time for us<br/>
to travel, too much going on here. Glad that you&#39;re planning this, I hope we<br/>
can make it.<br/>

August is still really busy and expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as to people&#39;s logistics and unschooling, in August most new <br/>
homeschoolers seem to know EXACTLY how it is going to work, and wouldn&#39;t want to hear <br/>
from us, but by October, they find it is NOT working and they might appreciate a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192399642">One idea could be to have a couple of people who had to be convinced about <br/>
the merits of unschooling.  Like a husband or mother-in-law, who could come with <br/>
and could talk about what was the road block for them and what helped them to <br/>
see the &quot;light.&quot;  We seem to talk quite a bit about reluctant husbands or the <br/>
reluctant mother-in-law.  This might help the unschoolers to see the other <br/>
side and to see what helped.  <br/>
<br/>
Just an idea,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333378822">In case you are looking for any outside-of-homeschooling types to give <br/>
a talk:<br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith - the Book of Learning and Forgetting. He might come just <br/>
to hear Sandra again! &lt;G&gt; He was a delight, I listened to him with a <br/>
goofy grin on my face the whole time. There is a lot he could learn <br/>
from us - and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
Alfie Kohn -- he&#39;ll speak cheap if it is in Boston, I think, and will <br/>
negotiate fees.  Tell him we&#39;ll make a trade -- we&#39;ll tell him all <br/>
kinds of amazing things about kids who not only do not GO to school, <br/>
they don&#39;t even do school at home - things that will delight and thrill <br/>
him. (We don&#39;t want him to talk about school, of course, but about <br/>
learning.)<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what David Elkind is up to these days - but I&#39;d love to hear <br/>
him speak and I think he&#39;s in that area.<br/>
<br/>
You might not want any out-of-homeschooling speakers - but I just <br/>
thought I&#39;d toss those out there, in case that possibility exists.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-405213573">Historic sites - I&#39;d love to get trotted around to visit all the places <br/>
we ought to see &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been to Boston once before but I was with my husband&#39;s Iranian <br/>
relative whose wife is Chinese and, as much fun as we had, they didn&#39;t <br/>
have a clue about the historic stuff. I dragged them to a couple of <br/>
places, but they really get a chuckle out of us thinking something only <br/>
a couple of hundred years old is &quot;history!&quot; That falls under &quot;current <br/>
events&quot; to them &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
