&lt;&lt;What state are you in? This helps much. I also know how hard it is to have a<br/>
<br/>
mom from he**, as well as an ex (husband/boyfriend) that will put up a fight<br/>
<br/>
if I move. My mom lives 1600 miles from my home. I live in Michigan, but am<br/>
<br/>
moving with my husband to Kansas. I have not told the court yet. have you<br/>
<br/>
considered talking to your court worker (for your son&#39;s case - In Michigan<br/>
<br/>
it is Friend of the Court) about wanting to move, and what it would take to<br/>
<br/>
be able to move? I have a home purchased and I talked to the worker. I am<br/>
<br/>
with the understanding that a custodial parent can move, but must notify the<br/>
<br/>
state and non custodial parent. It is worth checking.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I think I read an article in Newsweek yesterday that said that 4 states <br/>
had relaxed their laws in recent years, giving custodial parents back more <br/>
freedom to move.  Let&#39;s hope it&#39;s a trend.  <br/>
