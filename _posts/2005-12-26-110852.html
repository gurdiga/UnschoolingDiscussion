<br/>
-=-Back in the 1870s, naturalist and explorer John Muir said, &quot;One  <br/>
day&#39;s exposure<br/>
to mountains is better than cartloads of books.&quot; Today, we might  <br/>
update his<br/>
words for our time: &quot;One day&#39;s exposure to mountains is better than  <br/>
heaps of<br/>
video games and countless episodes of TV shows.&quot;<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
I believe John Muir was probably thinking of books about mountains  <br/>
and trees, wildlife and rivers.   If he had been thinking of pirate  <br/>
novels and romances and mystery stories, maybe the parallel would  <br/>
hold.  And by &quot;episodes of TV shows&quot; I don&#39;t think Anu Garg (the  <br/>
author of the comment above) meant Nova or National Geographic.<br/>
<br/>
Probably John Muir had more nature intelligence than verbal, and so  <br/>
he himself learned way more by direct experience than by pondering  <br/>
the written words of others.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that a very cool statement about learning was twisted  <br/>
to insult video gaming.  And that paragraph had nothing to do with  <br/>
the word of the day, either. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to think, though, of what does parallel what.  It&#39;s  <br/>
a way to uncover principles.  What is the principle behind John  <br/>
Muir&#39;s statement?  People can learn from nature, and they can&#39;t learn  <br/>
from nature if they&#39;re home with a book.  (I think that&#39;s what it  <br/>
means.)   What is the principle behind the commentary?  I don&#39;t think  <br/>
there is a clear, good principle unless it&#39;s &quot;dead white 19th century  <br/>
guys were all wise, and I read their words in books, but video games  <br/>
and sitcoms suck.&quot;    Total book-worshipping non-sequitor in my view.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I like the word discussions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712767181">Hello, everyone, here&#39;s my first post in a long time...<br/>
  I agree that the author twisted Muir&#39;s original meaning, but I&#39;m confused about where you&#39;re getting the book worship from it.  Sounds to me more like the message was, &quot;In my day (or the good old days, etc.) we didn&#39;t have all these electronic toys...in my day, we went outside to play.&quot; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Where would a guy who practically lives on the internet (maintains an  <br/>
extensive website posts every day about things he has learned from  <br/>
books) have learned about John Muir?<br/>
<br/>
In a book.<br/>
<br/>
And so when he (the modern guy) wanted to paraphrase Muir, he didn&#39;t  <br/>
suggest books were bad, because he himself is learning from books and  <br/>
not from trees and not from video games and not from TV.  He&#39;s a book  <br/>
guy.  Muir lives in books now.<br/>
<br/>
Muir&#39;s statement was anti-book.<br/>
Anu Garg wouldn&#39;t make an anti-book statement because he lives in/of/ <br/>
for books.<br/>
<br/>

In Muir&#39;s day, there wasn&#39;t electronic ANYthing.  Electric lights  <br/>
were new.  He died before there was radio.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Here is the statement in context of the rest of the paragraph:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;19. I have a low opinion of books; they are but piles of stones set<br/>
up to show coming travelers where other minds have been, or at best<br/>
signal smokes to call attention. Cadmus and all the other inventors of<br/>
letters receive a thousandfold more credit than they deserve. No<br/>
amount of word-making will ever make a single soul to know these<br/>
mountains. As well seek to warm the naked and frostbitten by lectures<br/>
on caloric and pictures of flame. One day&#39;s exposure to mountains is<br/>
better than cartloads of books. See how willingly Nature poses herself<br/>
upon photographers&#39; plates. No earthly chemicals are so sensitive as<br/>
those of the human soul. All that is required is exposure, and purity<br/>
of material. &#39;The pure in heart shall see God!&#39;. . . .&quot;<br/>

mean that a book about nature is no substitute for the experience of<br/>
being there in real life.<br/>
<br/>
There are some experiences, though, I would much rather read about in<br/>
books than experience in real life.  <br/>
<br/>
And there are times when books have inspired me to seek out new<br/>
real-life experiences.<br/>

The same with video games and movies and tv.  I have experienced more<br/>
