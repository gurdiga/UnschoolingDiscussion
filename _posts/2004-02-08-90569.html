<div id="ygrps-yiv-146775358">Hi Everyone,<br/>
I don&#39;t post much, and sometimes don&#39;t get to read all the posts--but <br/>
I love being a part of this list. I was wondering if anyone of you <br/>
live in the Houston area. We are moving there soon for a job transfer <br/>
for my husband. I am looking for unschooling groups there and some <br/>
info on areas in which to look for a house. I would appreciate any <br/>
help any of you could give! Thanks!<br/>
Laura, OK</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481945016">We lived in the Houston area twice for a total of about 9 years.  Look into<br/>
the Houston Unschoolers Group (HUG).  Last I heard Holly Fergason (who I<br/>
have seen recently here or at Alwayslearning) was the leader.<br/>
<br/>
Houston has some wonderful advantages.  The zoo is good and cheap.  The<br/>
children&#39;s museum is a lot of fun.  Galveston is a blast for the beach.  The<br/>
ship channel is cool if you like to watch big boats.  College football is a<br/>
lot of fun there between Uof Houston and Rice.<br/>
<br/>
We lived in Katy, just west of Houston both times.  Housing ranges from the<br/>
70&#39;s to 500,000. Most neighborhoods and lots of individual homes have pools.<br/>
Low crime, good restaurants.  If you check out that area, try El Jarito<br/>
restaurant on Mason for some great Mexican food.<br/>
<br/>
Email me privately if you wish.<br/>
