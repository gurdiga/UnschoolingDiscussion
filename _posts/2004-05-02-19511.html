<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034851808">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have been intrigued by different definitions of disease, etc., offered by <br/>
members of this loop and thought some of you might be interested in reading the <br/>
book &quot;Women&#39;s Ways of Knowing.&quot;  I read it a long time ago and cannot find it <br/>
on my shelves -- I suspect I loaned it out and lost track of it, so I can&#39;t <br/>
offer the author&#39;s name even, but I remember appreciating how the author tied <br/>
together the various ways we come to &quot;know,&quot; which, for women (and hopefully <br/>
our youngsters who are raised with openness to ideas beyond what the experts <br/>
say), includes a hybrid combination of getting a sense of what those who are <br/>
considered experts have to say on a particular subject, but also taking into <br/>
account one&#39;s own knowledge based on experience, intuition and practicality.  <br/>
