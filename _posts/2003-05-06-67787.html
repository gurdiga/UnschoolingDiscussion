have few friends that I see regularly, Maureen is the only one really <br/>
unschooling, and your answer to Heidi just addressed a guilty secret of mine, <br/>
that this list is my only social life! I look forward to it each evening, to <br/>
see what everyone is doing, and to hear the latest. Even when the traffic was <br/>
VERY high with a bit of weird stuff thrown in, I couldn&#39;t wait. Once again <br/>
you have relieved me of the burden of believing I should be spending my time <br/>
in a better way.<br/>
THANK YOU<br/>

PS, Heidi, I am right there with you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>

I too have found this world FITS<br/>
and it feels great <br/>
I have come to accept myself as different but the lack of Adult Stimulation <br/>
frustrated me, here all I have to do is read<br/>
Thanks Everyone<br/>
