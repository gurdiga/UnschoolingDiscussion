<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I was an only, My husband was an only, and our son, 
at this point , is an only.&nbsp; We have constant oppurtunities to be around 
others.&nbsp; All day, everyday.&nbsp; I kind of value the time spent, as an 
only.&nbsp; I think the first person in the world we should really get to know 
is ourselves.&nbsp; Don&#39;t get me wrong, I long, at times , to be in sibling 
company, my friend for instance has 5 kids..we love to spend time with them..we 
are today, in fact.&nbsp; Extended family really.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so 
bad to be an only, perhaps their are experiences there, that others don&#39;t have 
time for.&nbsp; We rarely , actually have just , quiet time alone.&nbsp; Few 
people do, I think it a healthy, meditative practice, if we had some time for 
it, which we have to &quot;make&quot; time for too.&nbsp; But being an only is cool, 
too.&nbsp; My 50 cents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle*</font></div></html></div>
