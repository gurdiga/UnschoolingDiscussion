<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218130714">Pretty much the reason we do it too.  Though we both read the<br/>
e-mail and have eleventy dozen e-ddresses though various<br/>
webpages, it is just easier to run it through one clearing house.<br/>
Most of the approximately 700 messages that come in every day are<br/>
automatically sorted into the right folder - most of the folks we<br/>
write to hear only from one or the other of us.   Our son and<br/>
D-i-L have the same setup - it never occurred to me that it would<br/>
be worth the effort to maintain separate e-dresses; it is enough<br/>
trouble to balance 2 checkbooks.<br/>
