<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<time> 7 Feb 2004, at 10:23am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137697446">That works until they hit &#39;highschool age&quot; and then people really start to get nervous.<br/>
<br/>
Now I get questions like &quot;are you REALLY going to keep homeschooling until the end of high school????&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I answer with the same answer, &quot;its working for now, and if they decide they want to go back to school, we&#39;ll think it over then&quot;.  That gets them off my back (Most of the time), but it doesn&#39;t seem to relax them anymore LOL.<br/>
<br/>
And I still get questions like &quot;How are you going to teach them algebra?  Trig?  Chemistry?&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
It amazes me how they are in such utter disbelief.  <br/>
<br/>
And I am so glad my kids don&#39;t WANT to go to school.   At least people who know I offer them the choice can relax knowing I&#39;m not locking my kids in a closet all day (sigh and rolling my eyes).<br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-81265709">I think the easiest thing to do is just tell people what they want to hear, *unless* they are really interested in what we are really doing.<br/>
<br/>
I know recently I just decided I was going to &quot;spill the beans&quot; at work with my very opininated co-workers, mainly because I got tired of all the same kinds of questions, I&#39;m tired of always getting the vibe that I must defend myself, and I&#39;m tired of &quot;biting my toungue&quot; because *their* kids are in school.<br/>
<br/>
I told them we didn&#39;t &quot;do math&quot; for about 2 years, and how my son just absorbed it by osmosis.  The shock on their faces was amazing.  Of course, now they&#39;ll rationalize it and think my kids are &quot;different&quot; than theirs are, and no child except a &quot;different&quot; child would enjoy learning etc etc etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I know the Brownie Leader is still concerned about my 8 year old who is not reading or writing.  And I know her ps friends have been giving her somewhat of a hard time too.   And my 15 year old does absolutely NO writing.<br/>
<br/>
I am facing the end of the school year soon, and the school district will be expecting writing samples for him to show &quot;sustained progress&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure what we&#39;ll do about that yet.(I did check into some of your ideas Sandra, but basically he has absolutely no interest in any writing at all).  From the unschooling standpoint, I could care less if he doesn&#39;t produce anything in writing.   He is very articulate.  And its not hard to learn how to write a paper when there is a need to learn it.<br/>
<br/>
But the district could very well breathe down my neck about it and that makes me feel like I&#39;m forced into a corner.<br/>
