<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690159265">&lt;&lt; On another list someone posted that her then 3 year old snuggled up to <br/>
her<br/>
and told her she&#39;d look great in a zuchinni.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Okay.  Not everything that comes out of a kid makes sense. &lt;g&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps she meant BIKINI???  LOL  Too cute.<br/>
<br/>
When Lauren was about 3 or so, she kept asking me for a cockeatlater.  <br/>
HUH???  Poor child asked me dozens of times for days on end.  For the life <br/>
of me I couldn&#39;t figure out what in the world she was talking about!  You <br/>
can imagine what I was thinking and wondering!  Finally, one day she ran in <br/>
the living room screaming, &quot;I found the cockeatlater!!!!&quot;  She was holding a <br/>
CALCULATOR! rofl!!  It was too funny.  Gave us all a good *DUH* laugh.<br/>
<br/>
Lauren has always come up with cute versions of words...fabric is &#39;fagret&#39;, <br/>
yogurt is &#39;ogret&#39;.  My friend&#39;s daughter calls a mustache a &#39;smooshnash&#39;.  <br/>
That&#39;s one of my favorites! :)  Even my husband calls a mustache a <br/>
smooshnash now and my firends all go to the Fagret store.  hehe<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072838862">With 4 kids, there have been so many funny words I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t write<br/>
them all down. Tara talked a lot about lemmecups. Always asked me to sing it<br/>
to her. Wasn&#39;t until she was able to sing some of it herself I figured out<br/>
what it was. Lollipops! (she was raised on oldies!) She also talked about<br/>
poppatees. Never did figure that one out.<br/>
<br/>
Even recently Joseph and Sierra always ask us to play Scramble with them!<br/>
(scrabble) They see the box and know how to read but somehow it&#39;s still<br/>
always scramble.<br/>
<br/>
The funniest is Alyssa. She still calls the kitchen a chicken. Always has.<br/>
If you say go into the chicken, she looks at you like you&#39;re nuts. She knows<br/>
it&#39;s the kitchen but when she says it, it&#39;s always chicken. Sometimes she<br/>
even wants chicken from in the chicken!!!<br/>

Once very long ago, Keith and I took a journey from one part of the house, <br/>
with trepidation, to the &quot;barbecued kitchen.&quot;  It was actually barbecued <br/>
chicken, we thought.  It ended up being a pizza.<br/>
<br/>
But LSD was involved, in our case.   What made us think we could have eaten a <br/>
kitchen OR chicken?  <br/>
<br/>
Still we referred to that room as &quot;the barbecued kitchen&quot; for a while, so we <br/>
traded our chicken for her chicken!<br/>
<br/>
And now I&#39;m old and conservative.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669869067">These things are just way too cute to correct, aren&#39;t they?  A friend <br/>
of mine doesn&#39;t understand why I don&#39;t stop my 6yod from calling the <br/>
washing machine the &quot;washing ma-cleaner.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
And they are still N M M&#39;s, not MnM&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh and Pooh&#39;s friend is Pliget.<br/>
<br/>
And she loves to find callipitters.<br/>
<br/>
Just recently she heard the word pacifier and didn&#39;t know what it was <br/>
since we always called hers a binky.  Pacifier just didn&#39;t sit right <br/>
with her, and I wasn&#39;t sure why.  A couple nights later she brought <br/>
it back up out of nowhere and said she decided that we shouldn&#39;t call <br/>
them pacifiers because they are not hot---they should be called paci-<br/>
winds.  We cracked up, but it confused her since she is not familiar <br/>
with the term &quot;pass wind.&quot;  (By the way, she always called THAT &quot;poo-<br/>
poo-gas&quot; until preschool when she heard fart, but translated it <br/>
as &quot;fired.&quot;  &quot;Oops I fired!&quot; sounds much more &quot;appropriate&quot; coming <br/>
out of a 3yo mouth. :-) )<br/>

So if you were to get really angry with your car overheating or something, <br/>
and if you get so furious you call it something entirely vulgar, like twat or <br/>
cunt, be SURE your windows are closed so the women in nearby cars won&#39;t become <br/>
offended and express road rage.  (Shyrley&#39;s not back yet to tell us not to call <br/>
it a fanny.)<br/>
<br/>
I hope that whole HesFes experience is going well for the temporarily missing <br/>
Brits.<br/>
<br/>
I just learned that my American friends who were living near York but are now <br/>
south of London are going to stay longterm.  They were, then they weren&#39;t, <br/>
and now they&#39;re looking to buy a house.   She was working on a PhD in archeology <br/>
and became unexpectedly pregnant.  Her #1 loves school there.  Her #2 is not <br/>
seeming to be a school kind of guy, so she&#39;s been researching homeschooling <br/>
there, and was impressed to come across my name, as she&#39;s known me since she was <br/>
a teenager, and was one of my SCA apprentices.  And her #3 baby is a five <br/>
month old named Sophie.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that has to do with vulvas.<br/>

  &lt;&lt; Oh cripes!  I spelled that wrong.  It was a gooseJabber!  And then one day<br/>
<br/>
  she told me she&#39;d had paperclops at the neighbours.  It was quite some time<br/>
<br/>
  before I found out that paperclops were apricots. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt;I love these!  Let&#39;s see, my 2nd youngest  used to say &quot;franchin&quot; for<br/>
sandwich, and &quot;fix my socks mommy, their cranky&quot; for a crooked<br/>
heel ; )&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s cute! Tara use to call french fries inch fries. And Sierra, who has<br/>
incredibly curly hair, upon wakiing one morning said her hair was<br/>
scrubbled!!<br/>
