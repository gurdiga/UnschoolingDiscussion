&lt;&lt; I think it&#39;s a mistake to assume that if you don&#39;t directly give out<br/>
 your address no one will be able to find it.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did some sleuthing of my own once upon a time, found out the exact location <br/>
of a persons house and their birth certificate info. online. There are some <br/>
great search engines out there.....and ways to find just about anyone.  Which <br/>
is great when looking for old friends you&#39;ve lost touch with!!<br/>
I think that&#39;s an interesting experiment you did Rue!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924925912">Yeah....I forgot about the sepschool thing LOL.  I even did a search for my own name once and found it, etc.  I didn&#39;t dive too deep though.<br/>
<br/>
I forgot about the IP numbers and ISP&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, guess thats one less &quot;fear&quot; to worry about.  I guess I&#39;ll tell the kids not to worry about it after all!<br/>

  Kathy - When I found Kristen&#39;s address/phone number links were given to<br/>
  Mapquest and Yahoo Maps.  FYI, all I did was Google to get this info.<br/>

<br/>
Hi Ren - It was really interesting to see how QUICKLY I could find<br/>
someone, starting out with just her name and what state she lived in.<br/>
Even more interesting to find I only needed to use Google.  I&#39;ve always<br/>
loved searching out information (maybe I  could be a fact checker?) and<br/>
the Internet has changed that so completely.  ~Rue<br/>
