<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021999185">Here is some info that may be of interest to some of you - I thought I would pass it on:<br/>
<br/>
This is a conference on alternative therapies for children in Massachusettes.  It is being organized by a fellow homeschooling father whose son was born a year ago with microocephaly.( I am not sure of the proper spelling). He has been researching alternatives to, or in addition to, modern medicine for children and has found a wealth of information and doctors that were willing to speak and inform parents of other alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the link for information about the conference - if it is of interest.<br/>
