There are headlines from many news sources.  If you scroll down, you will<br/>
see on the left index bar links to many US and international sources.  It is<br/>
very convenient when you have a &quot;need&quot; for news.&lt;BG&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m beginning to revise my thinking on reading books.  One year a few years<br/>
&gt;back I set a personal record by reading 122 books.  That was a lot of fun,<br/>
&gt;but after awhile, the tallying took on a life of its own, overshadowing<br/>
&gt;perhaps some of the other more important reasons for reading such as mind<br/>
&gt;broadening or relaxation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes, I&#39;m still a book lover.  I go to the library at least twice a week.<br/>
&gt;Non-fiction is my preference by far.  I pick out all sorts of books which<br/>
&gt;interest me: travel, hiking, history, poetry, social issues, books on<br/>
&gt;photography, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;These days, however, I rarely read a book from cover to cover.  I simply<br/>
&gt;read the bits which interest me.  This is because my time for reading is<br/>
&gt;limited, and once I&#39;ve gleaned what I want to from one book, I&#39;m usually<br/>
&gt;anxious to move on to the next.  Practically the only books I read cover to<br/>
&gt;cover are the ones I read to my children at night before they go to bed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s more and more apparent to me that while books are still excellent<br/>
&gt;sources of information, the Internet is quickly becoming a worthy rival.<br/>
&gt;The Internet enables easy access to a mind-boggling array of news and<br/>
&gt;information sources.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Personally,  I get my news from several respected American sites as well as<br/>
&gt;a few foreign websites.  Often when a story hits which piques my curiosity,<br/>
&gt;I go directly to the news website of the city where the event is happening.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s great fun to get foreign perspectives on news happening in the United<br/>
&gt;States.  I love the availability of demographic and geographic information<br/>
&gt;as well.  My growing network of Internet friends/acquaintances is also<br/>
&gt;invaluable in that we send each other links, articles and other discoveries<br/>
&gt;we find interesting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In the long run, electronic information sources will diminish the relative<br/>
&gt;importance of printed books, but won&#39;t eliminate them entirely.  I&#39;m just<br/>
&gt;happy to live in an age when the number of easily accesssible information<br/>
&gt;sources has exploded.  Surely there has never been a better time in the<br/>
&gt;history of the world to undertake the task of self-education.<br/>
