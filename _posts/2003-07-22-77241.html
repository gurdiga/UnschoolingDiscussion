<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487107813">Thank  you so much for posting this file.  I am sending it to the printer in<br/>
a moment and will make copies to post around the house.  Since it has the<br/>
copyright on it, is it alright for me to copy it for my homeschool support<br/>
group?<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Sarah<br/>
