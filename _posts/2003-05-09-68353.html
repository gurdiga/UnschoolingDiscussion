 </span></blockquote>Well, I can only speak for my experience, and I have to start out by saying <br/>
that Julian, since infancy, has always been a mellow, easygoing kid, so maybe <br/>
it&#39;s just him. <br/>
<br/>
Julian is 13, and he&#39;s one of my favorite people to be around. He&#39;s kind, <br/>
gentle, funny, and pleasant. He&#39;s remarkably in tune with other people, and <br/>
has more empathy than I see in most adults (and I work for a church!).   Thus <br/>
far, I&#39;m not seeing signs of rebellion.  <br/>
<br/>
For example....the Mall. Julian, being a 13 year old boy, is not real into <br/>
shopping. However, he knows I do enjoy it sometimes, and don&#39;t really have <br/>
anyone around most of the time to do it with (who doesn&#39;t hate it). He <br/>
periodically suggests we spend an afternoon at the mall together, and is <br/>
extremely good company on the rare occasion that I take him up on it.  He <br/>
even hangs out patiently if I&#39;m in a masochistic mood and try on clothes. <br/>
Furthermore, while at the mall, he often TAKES MY HAND AND HOLDS MY HAND.... <br/>
even when there are other teenagers around.  (I am told that this is <br/>
unusual.)<br/>
<br/>
No, really, I don&#39;t expect that he&#39;ll suddenly turn into a demon. <br/>
