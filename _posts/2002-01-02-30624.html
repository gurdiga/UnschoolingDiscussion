I&#39;m a new unschooler so I may not be the best &#39;vault&#39; of advice (I *just* started unschooling after &#39;schooling at home&#39; for the first 6 months, my daughter was pulled from ps at the end of last school year (out of 2nd grade)..) however it is just my observation that if they are not retaining what they learned at public school, then was it really learned? Memorization is completely different from true learning in my experience..<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way you can look at what they have learned and what areas they have grown in? Maybe keep a notebook out and when you see little glimpses of what they are learning/exploring write it down so that on days like this you can go to it to reassure yourself?<br/>

<br/>
Shyrley,<br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t remember what they learned, then they didn&#39;t REALLY learn it<br/>
in the first place.  It must not have value for them.....or have value for<br/>
them YET.<br/>
<br/>
What sorts of things does your 10 year old do on the computer?  My 15 year<br/>
old is on the computer all the time.  When he was about that age (a little<br/>
younger), he was doing almost nothing but playing Microsoft Flight<br/>
Simulator.  I was starting to get worried about it, but he loved all aspects<br/>
of flight and flying and I kept thinking it would feed a passion and lead<br/>
somewhere &quot;productive&quot; eventually.  Well, one day he was playing and I<br/>
checked in to see that he was teaching himself triangulation.  That game<br/>
gives you 3 coordinates from different airports and, from there, you have to<br/>
figure out where you are.  It was a pretty complicated mathematical problem<br/>
and he was working on it because he *wanted* to.  Since that time, I&#39;ve<br/>
relaxed a bit.  He no longer plays that particular game, but now he&#39;s<br/>
*really* into website construction.  He&#39;s taught himself how to build little<br/>
flash movies, learned a lot about digital photography, and knows tons about<br/>
HTML.  Because of all he knows about computers, he is able to help the<br/>
librarian a LOT on the days he volunteers there (he&#39;s the one who helps<br/>
patrons with their computer questions) and it has fed his self-esteem to be<br/>
so competent at something.  (Ditto with his Scout troop--he is the resident<br/>
computer expert.)  Also, he took a computer class and found he knew FAR more<br/>
than any of the adults in the class...and this was when he was about 10.<br/>
The guys who owned the store asked him to come hang out and help them teach<br/>
the class.  Anyway--his computer expertise has been beneficial in *so* many<br/>
areas of his life.<br/>
<br/>
I do still worry from time to time about him spending *so* much time on the<br/>
computer, but I&#39;ve come to understand that &quot;immersion&quot; is his learning<br/>
style....and it&#39;s something he&#39;ll work on for a LONG time and then move on.<br/>
There is no &quot;day-to-day&quot; balance, but there is balance OVER TIME in his<br/>
life/learning.<br/>
<br/>
I do sometimes talk to him about &quot;balance&quot; in his life.  Sometimes he<br/>
listens; sometimes not.  Mostly, I trust it will be OK because he&#39;s shown me<br/>
that it will.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What are they playing on the computer?  Most of the games we own have <br/>
educational value whether they are supposed to or not.  I bet yours <br/>
do too.  If that is where there interests are get them more games.  <br/>
Our library has cd-roms to borrow, maybe yours does too?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get discouraged.  I went through this with my girls too.  For <br/>
years I had this nagging guilt that they weren&#39;t learning enough.  <br/>
Now, they are some of the smartest people I know.  I don&#39;t know where <br/>
or how they learned stuff but they sure do know it!<br/>
As for the doubting dh, I had a doubting grandma, but she has come <br/>
around.  Give him time and make sure they tell him lots of &#39;stuff&#39; <br/>
about what they do and what they know.<br/>

<br/>
Just one more quick note about this....I had started learning some HTML<br/>
about 5 years ago because I had a *need* (NOT a desire) and I really thought<br/>
he would ENJOY it.  So I worked really hard to try to cultivate an interest<br/>
in it--sharing with him interesting things I had learned.  He messed with it<br/>
for just a very short time and then dropped it.  Then, about a year ago, he<br/>
started getting very interested in it and learned more in a week than I had<br/>
learned in 5 years.  My point is that he learned it when HE had an interest<br/>
and a reason to learn it.  (I.e. there was an event that led to this<br/>
interest, though I won&#39;t go into it.)<br/>

it after the test?<br/>
Your kids will be fine. Let them play on the computer all day long. <br/>
Get an old trashed one and let them take it apart. Show them places <br/>
where they can create webpages. There&#39;s a lot of learning going on <br/>
when a kid sits at the computer!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355547129">Leslie, I just had to say thank you, thank you for writing this.<br/>
I read the whole thing to my dh yesterday and it really opened his eyes.<br/>
You see, we too, have a 10 yos who is always playing Microsoft Flight Sim and is always on the computer.<br/>
Reading your experiences and thoughts was extremely helpful in calming my dh&#39;s fears about unschooling.<br/>
Just knowing that there was someone out there with similar experiences was amazing.<br/>
Once again, thank you for sharing. Your words made a tremendous difference to our lives.<br/>
