&lt;&lt; I think that sometimes I still have a hard time going from being the woman <br/>
 that was very organized in the working world and having to schedule <br/>
 everything to just letting things happen now that I have 2 kids.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is me, too.  I have been home now for 5 yrs, but it is still difficult <br/>
at times to be less structured, and to just &quot;go with the flow&quot;.  I think it&#39;s <br/>
partly a personality thing, too-- I am who I am.  :) But, with my dh being <br/>
very laid back, it&#39;s probably not so bad that I am more the <br/>
organizer/scheduler type!  (We balance each other out.)  I am getting better <br/>
at being more of a facilitator when it comes to my kids, as opposed to being <br/>
the teacher.  It has not been easy after having taught school for 10yrs.  I <br/>
have had to &quot;de-school&quot;, and unlearn some things-- and it&#39;s been tough at <br/>
times! ~Karen</div>
