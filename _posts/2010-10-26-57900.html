<div id="ygrps-yiv-575241185">A year ago, I would have resisted picking up a Pokemon book.  A few weeks<br/>
ago, we were in the book store, looking for anything, and Ethan found this<br/>
&quot;Ultimate Pokemon&quot; book.   The old voice in my brain leaped forward and said<br/>
&quot;No.  What is useful in that?  It&#39;s too commercial.  Try to steer his<br/>
attention to something else.  I don&#39;t even know what Pokemon is.&quot;  My<br/>
fresher, (but still freshening brain), said &quot;Hmmm.  Here is a chance to<br/>
apply what I am learning on this list and in my reading.  He is interested<br/>
in this.  Of all the books in the bookstore, he chose this one.  Here is my<br/>
chance to support his interests without bias.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, I said sure.  &quot;Want anything else?&quot;  Nope.  He (age 7) read it all the<br/>
way home, and past midnight in his room.  He began asking me: &quot;How high is 4<br/>
feet?&quot;  &quot;How do you tell the symbol for inches from the symbol for feet?&quot;<br/>
&quot;How much do I weigh?&quot;  Then he began making comparisons of the sizes of<br/>
Pokemon to himself.  We went to the library and took out the maximum number<br/>
of videos we could on our card--all Pokemon.  He was jumping for joy.  We<br/>
watched them, and we went back for more--twice in one week!<br/>
<br/>
Now, he has started drawing characters and writing stats for them.  He<br/>
calculates the maximum damage each character can do, given their weaknesses<br/>
and resistances.  Today, he designed, and made his own Energy cards.  He is<br/>
making characters out of sculpy, and has designed his favourite character<br/>
costume to wear this Halloween.  He has given two of his favourite cards to<br/>
his good friend, and is currently trying to teach him how to play the game.<br/>
 Oh, and by the way, I&#39;m hooked on it too!  It is full of everything.<br/>
<br/>
So, I want to say thanks to everyone for sharing your experiences and<br/>
answering all of our questions.  Your efforts go directly into the homes of<br/>
others and make positive change happen.  If I had listened to that old voice<br/>
of mine, I wouldn&#39;t be watching my son do all of the things I couldn&#39;t coax<br/>
him to do a year ago.<br/>
<br/>
Gratefully,<br/>
Karen.<br/>

I&#39;m so glad you stopped yourself and got the book!!!!  I wrote a very short bit <br/>
about Pokemon at my blog.  What I like the most about it, is the anonymous <br/>
comment that I got on it!  That comment says so much and is so inspiring!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232124785">I am very happy for you!<br/>
<br/>
Pokemon opened my son&#39;s world. He has Asperger&#39;s Syndrome with delayed reading/writing. Pokemon books and games helped him learn how to read! It relieved so much stress and worry as we had tried so many other methods of learning/teaching. Anyway, I am glad for you and your child. <br/>
