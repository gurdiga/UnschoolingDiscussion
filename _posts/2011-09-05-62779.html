<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991669029">Bob Collier&#39;s newsletter has its 200th issue today:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.parental-intelligence.com/">http://www.parental-intelligence.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Bob links to parenting articles that match and some that don&#39;t match the discussions here, but if you&#39;re wanting a range of input about parenting, that&#39;s a good source.<br/>
<br/>
I share this blog with three other moms, but I&#39;m the only one who posts. :-)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.blogspot.com">http://unschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
That&#39;s where I put links to articles, interviews and such.<br/>
<br/>
News of my own site goes here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a> <br/>
and I&#39;ve put easy subscription links on the upper left (just did that yesterday)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I like the Always Learning list, even when it&#39;s kind of quiet.  I like those things linked above too, and I don&#39;t want this list too cluttered with news.  Always Learning will be ten years old November 24.  The first post was by Deb Lewis.  Deb will be speaking in Albuquerque in December.<br/>

So will Joyce and Pam, who have been with this discussion list from the beginning, and Jill Parmer.  And me.  and Pam&#39;s daughter, and maybe some of the other teen-and-grown kids of those moms, who ten years ago had pre-teen kids, and young teens.<br/>
<br/>
Just Add Light and Stir turned a year old last Friday. :-)<br/>

<br/>
So lots of milestones, Bob&#39;s newsletter, my blog, and before long this list!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading.<br/>
<br/>
