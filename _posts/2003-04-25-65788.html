<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803647329"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;SO, here&#39;s my math wiz daughter, which does impress me, but because she&#39;s <br/>
&gt;not reading Tolkien at age eight (as was my older girl), I think she&#39;s not <br/>
&gt;doing so well. Aaaargh! I need to de-school, don&#39;t I?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Heidi,<br/>
YES!!!  I have had this SAME problem!  I am SUCH a reader.  Usually <br/>
devouring at *least* one book a day.  Although, usually I have several <br/>
running at the same time.  I desperately want my children reading from birth <br/>
JUST because *I* love it so dang much!  And for the outsider comments that <br/>
reading aloud and surrounding your children with books will lead to early <br/>
reading???  HOGWASH!  I can&#39;t sit and eat a meal without having the box near <br/>
me to read.  I don&#39;t care HOW many times I&#39;ve read the same box, I will read <br/>
it over and over, just to read something.  (Yes, I&#39;m a little bonkers. :))  <br/>
We have a library of thousands of books in our home.  They creep out from <br/>
every possible corner, nook and cranny.  Proabably one behind every toilet <br/>
even, but my 7 yr old still doesn&#39;t read fluently.  We read literally dozens <br/>
of books every day aloud.  She will sit and devour every moment, but it <br/>
hasn&#39;t caused her to sit and read them herself.<br/>
<br/>
It has taken me quite some time to &#39;get over it&#39;.  Certainly, it isn&#39;t easy <br/>
when my entire family is a big wad of school teachers with their ingrained <br/>
ideas of how she *should* be doing this or that.  This same child, however, <br/>
will tell you every math fact known to man.  She&#39;s never been taught one, <br/>
save a few times she has asked for an answer to a problem and I offer it to <br/>
her.  She absorbs everything she watches on tv, from discovey to the history <br/>
channel and will proudly tell you ALL about it.  It is so funny to watch a 4 <br/>
year old little girl describe how rain forms and why there is thunder and <br/>
lightening outside but no rain.  And very technically, I might add.<br/>
<br/>
But reading?  Just hasn&#39;t clicked.  She&#39;s not dumb, behind, uninterested, <br/>
she&#39;s just not READY!  I feel certain with all that I am that once she <br/>
starts taking off reading that I will know everything there is to know about <br/>
anything! LOL<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;Navigating computer games&quot; LOL are we raising the same kid? Katie can read <br/>
&gt;words like &quot;location&quot; and &quot;suspect&quot; from a logic and math computer game for <br/>
&gt;9-12 year olds, and finish the game without a problem...but if I wrote <br/>
&gt;&quot;location&quot; on a piece of paper, she would not be able to read it.<br/>
&gt;frustrating.<br/>
&gt;HeidiC<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We must be!  How old is she again? I missed it.  This is Nicholette exactly! <br/>
  Try not to feel frustrated, feel PROUD!  It was very frustrating for me, <br/>
too for a long time.  I suppose here and there it still is, but purely for <br/>
selfish reasons. &lt;bg&gt;  I consider myself to be a bright individual but I <br/>
can&#39;t follow written directions to save my life most of the time.  Or follow <br/>
a map for that matter.  I either enlist help or spend 8X the amount of time <br/>
any other peron would to get through it.  I figure someday, either I&#39;m going <br/>
to get so sick of being lost or paying to have everything preassembled that <br/>
I will force myself to figure it out or live with it.  My children aren&#39;t <br/>
any different if I allow them to be.  Which I do.  I can see that she is <br/>
already becoming frustrated with being unable to read and she has started <br/>
asking for regular instruction.  So what if she will be 7 in two weeks.  If <br/>
she were in school, she wouldn&#39;t know as much math or science so it all <br/>
balances out in the end, right??<br/>

looking her over, wondering why the reading hasn&#39;t begun yet, and in <br/>
immanent sp? danger of being labeled for life: slow reader, learning <br/>
disabled, or pick one from the many labels out there.<br/>

p.s. you sound like me, having to have the cereal box or SOMETHING to <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Can you come over and explain this to my dad in a couple of years?? ;o)<br/>
I know that if Jason is &quot;late&quot; in reading he will think it is because *I*<br/>
have not done something that the schools would have done. Luckily he is<br/>
only 6 so we have a couple of years before I have to worry about it, but<br/>
I have an inkling that he will probably be on the late side. He likes to <br/>
wait until he is good and ready before doing something and then does<br/>
it overnight. He did it with potty training, getting himself dressed,<br/>
and is doing it with writing. Jason LOVES being read to. Asks me to read<br/>
to him constantly. His vocabulary is incredible...he loves to play with<br/>
words, rhyming, talking about words that are spelled different but sound<br/>
the same. But he does not like to do things that he does not know how to<br/>
do (or do well enough in his own eyes). I am getting more and more<br/>
comfortable with this but do get some flack about not requiring Jason<br/>
to practice writing every day or not &quot;teaching&quot; him reading. He is also<br/>
very mathematically/science inclined as well and can explain how lots of things<br/>
work (mostly picked up from Bill Nye and Magic School bus).<br/>
<br/>
He has such a desire to learn things (that he is interested in) and he is<br/>
very bright and I have had talks with my dad about how it would be a shame<br/>
to &quot;waste&quot; it. Like by not making him do lessons would somehow lesson his<br/>
potential. <br/>
<br/>
I just figure that time will tell and prove me right :o) but in the meantime I still<br/>
have to deal with so many questions about how is his reading coming, how is his <br/>
writing coming. And why do they focus on everything that he is *not* doing instead<br/>
of looking at everything that he is doing?<br/>

the eagle is forced to practice swimming rather than flying, the fish is<br/>
forced to practice flying rather than swimming, or however it goes.  What I<br/>
remember about it is that they all end up &quot;disabled&quot; in the one thing they<br/>
were already pretty good at naturally.  I&#39;ll bet someone here knows where to<br/>

but I am still hanging on to hope that he gets it. He has pretty much always been a<br/>
student...BS electrical eng, MS Industrial Eng, almost got his PhD, is a CPA you name<br/>
it. <br/>

out a monthly email detailing all the stuff that Jason has been doing (throwing in a bit<br/>
of educationese as well as pointing out all the different ways he is learning. Seems<br/>
to be helping so far.<br/>

<br/>
Sure they are.  But the child, and the way he learns, is what&#39;s important.<br/>
If he has a tendency to wait until he&#39;s sure he can do something before<br/>
trying it, he&#39;s likely to be that way with everything.<br/>

Um... tell him he&#39;s wrong?  You have to wait for the brain and nerve<br/>
functions that control the sphincter and the bladder to develop.  You<br/>
have to wait for the parts of the brain that control the tracking of the<br/>
eyes and the blending of sounds to develop.  You have to wait for the<br/>
parts of the brain that control the fingertips to develop.  Why is that different?<br/>
