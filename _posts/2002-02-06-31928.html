<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082433019">I am really distressed about a phone call I got from the Sacramento <br/>
County Office of Ed in response to my sending in an R-4 affidavit.  <br/>
Here is a synopsis of the conversation that I noted for my records:  <br/>
(sorry it&#39;s so long, but I wanted you all to know what they&#39;re doing <br/>
to people filing R4s)<br/>
<br/>
Received phone call from Carol Gordia of Sacramento County Office of <br/>
Education, Child Welfare and Attendance.<br/>
<br/>
She said she had received my R-4 affadavit, and asked if I had taken <br/>
my son out of Horizon (the charter/home school program we were <br/>
previously enrolled in).  Told her yes.  She asked where he was <br/>
enrolled.  I told her he was enrolled in the private school I had <br/>
established by filing the R-4.  She said quite emphatically that the <br/>
R-4 does not establish a private school, and that Horizon would be <br/>
notifying the school district that he was not enrolled any longer and <br/>
that if he was not enrolled in a district school, there could be <br/>
truancy problems.  She asked why I took him out of Horizon, and I <br/>
told her that it didn&#39;t meet our needs.  She wanted to know <br/>
specifically what it was we didn&#39;t like  I again said that it didn&#39;t <br/>
meet our needs.  She said there were others, I said I was aware.  <br/>
<br/>
Her other arguments centered around &quot;you are closing the door&quot;  if <br/>
my son wanted to enroll in a high school down the road, they would <br/>
determine that he was in 8th grade, and the door would be closed.  I <br/>
told her that we considered this a stop-gap measure until we found a <br/>
suitable alternative, and that I had considered the implications.<br/>
<br/>
I told her I appreciated her concern and taking the time to call to <br/>
make sure I was informed, but that I had educated myself about all <br/>
the implications of this decision.  I asked if there was any problem <br/>
with the R-4 itself.  She said there wasn&#39;t, but that it could only <br/>
be filed in October of each year, and that my son would not be <br/>
enrolled in school until it was filed.  She reiterated that state <br/>
does nothing with the R-4 (I offered &quot;except for attendance <br/>
purposes&quot;  she said not even that) unless the school has 10 or more <br/>
students, then it is listed in a directory.<br/>
<br/>
I told her that I felt I had informed myself about the legal <br/>
implications of my decision, and that I was not doing anything that <br/>
contradicted legal precedence.  She said that I needed to call CDE, <br/>
because there is more than one legal interpretation.  I again told <br/>
her that I appreciated her concern and taking the time to call, but <br/>
that I would appreciate her doing what was legally required of her <br/>
office concerning the filing of the R-4, and that was all.  <br/>
<br/>
At the beginning of the conversation, Ms. Gordia said that she had <br/>
gotten my work number from my son.  After my conversation with her, I <br/>
called my son to find out what, if anything she had asked him or said <br/>
to him.  She asked him how long he had attended public school.  He <br/>
told her he attended through the first two weeks of 8th grade, but <br/>
that the school just wasn&#39;t working out for him.  She told him that <br/>
he had to attend a charter school if he ever wanted to go to high <br/>
school.  My son was quite distressed that she was telling him he had <br/>
to join a charter school. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about it.  I&#39;ve relayed this information to the legal person <br/>
at HSC, who reassured me when they gave me a hard time when I just <br/>
requested the R-4 form.  Any advice/reassurance from you wonderful, <br/>
experienced folks out there would be appreciated, too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363327730">Carla, about your phone call.  I don&#39;t live in your area, so I don&#39;t know<br/>
the details, but I would have to say it is similar to what I went through<br/>
here in Oregon with my son.  They are just giving you a hard time because<br/>
they have a hard time with it, maybe they just have no idea how to<br/>
process the papers.  So what if there are truancy issues?  Big deal.  You<br/>
get some annoying phone calls of a computer saying,<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re-eighth-grader-missed-periods-one-through-six-today&quot;.  And<br/>
occasionally people will call saying there are options for your son since<br/>
he&#39;s &quot;skipping classes&quot;.  Just say, &quot;He is legally homeschooled.&quot;  Your<br/>
son needs to be reassured that they are just b.s. ing him trying to<br/>
intimidate him because they are ignorant and afraid of different things. <br/>
My best advice... If you did what was legal, write down what they say in<br/>
calls, but basically, ignore everything they say.  <br/>
