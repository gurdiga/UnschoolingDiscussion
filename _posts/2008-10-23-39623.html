<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941471921">This is a long shot, but does anyone know (or know someone who knows)  <br/>
about the relief supplied to civilians after World War II in Europe?  <br/>
Anyone know of any personal accounts or well researched fictional  <br/>
accounts of what was received by the families or what the relief  <br/>
workers delivered?<br/>
<br/>
I volunteered to read a story to the kids in church this Sunday about  <br/>
relief from service agencies (Red Cross, Quakers, Unitarians and  <br/>
probably others) delivered to families in Germany after the war. And  <br/>
there&#39;s just something not ringing true about it. It&#39;s got medical  <br/>
supplies &quot;and other supplies for doctors&#39; offices&quot; and canned food  <br/>
and clothing. And then school supplies. Maybe later as things were  <br/>
recovering and rebuilding they would have sent such, but it seems  <br/>
frivolous mixed in with the survival based stuff. But I just don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve searched the internet all afternoon and I&#39;m only coming up with  <br/>
vague references to relief for civilians and would love to read  <br/>
something more immediate and personal to get a feel for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-385778953">I found a few things. I tried the Canadian armed forces sites (as my  <br/>
dad was a supply officer in the Canadian Navy), but I didn&#39;t find much  <br/>
to link from them. I did discover that Canada, with the help of  <br/>
Sweden, supplied from 17,000 tonnes to 29,000 tonnes of food  <br/>
(including 15,000 tonnes of wheat per month) to the starving people of  <br/>
Greece during the war, through the International Committee of the Red  <br/>
Cross!<br/>
<br/>
However, here are a few interesting sites:<br/>
<br/>
An abstract for a paper on the political issues with a relief effort:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/g15x701m356151h8/">http://www.springerlink.com/content/g15x701m356151h8/</a><br/>
<br/>
British site about the British Berlin Airlift Association, which  <br/>
includes some statistics at the bottom of the page about what was  <br/>
contributed:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bbaa-airlift.org.uk/">http://www.bbaa-airlift.org.uk/</a><br/>
<br/>
A book on personal stories from people involved in the airlift (some  <br/>
similar books listed farther down):<br/>

<br/>
This is the most interesting page to me, as it itemizes what the  <br/>
people in Berlin would need, the problems getting it to them, some  <br/>
funny stories about gum and chocolate, and photos of the servicemen  <br/>
who died during the Airlift.<br/>

I know these are mostly specific to the relief efforts for Germany.  <br/>
Hope it helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147745541">I know that in Art Spiegelman&#39;s Maus, his father talks about the boxes they&#39;d receive from <br/>
the Red Cross--he mentions that they contained chocolate, sardines, sausages, <br/>
cigarettes...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-866882669">Thank you for the links everyone. :-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s given me a much better handle on what was important to get to  <br/>
people and a big picture view so I can adapt that for the story.<br/>
<br/>
The Berlin Airlift was just a phrase to me before and now it&#39;s been  <br/>
given life :-) (The Little Vittles project was especially touching. I  <br/>
passed it onto my husband since the candy parachutes were assembled  <br/>
in the town next to where he works and that bit of local history  <br/>
might be an idea for one of the programs he runs.)<br/>
