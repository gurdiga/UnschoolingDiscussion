<div id="ygrps-yiv-348943108">Hi!<br/>
I am Sami, mom to four great kids in Maryland. We are technically <br/>
relaxed classical homeschoolers. I originally decided to check out this <br/>
group for ideas for an &quot;unschooling summer&quot;, but instead, I am here <br/>
being amazed and intrigued by your posts.<br/>
I have to be honest, I have read much about unschooling, but never to <br/>
the depths I am reading here. The philosophy is rarely backed up with <br/>
the insights and beliefs I am reading here, and I am impressed. <br/>
Many &quot;unschoolers&quot; that I have encountered didn&#39;t seem to have a real <br/>
philosophy, and their lives mostly resembled chaos-and many of the <br/>
children were obviously in need of boundries and structure. I don&#39;t <br/>
find that mentality here and like I said, I am impressed with what I am <br/>
reading. <br/>
I have a website-<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homegrownkidz.com">http://www.homegrownkidz.com</a> and I have been adding <br/>
pieces about each of the methods one by one. I am so glad I discovered <br/>
all of you, before starting a piece on  unschooling. You have opened my <br/>
eyes:)<br/>
I hope that you don&#39;t mind my learning from you:)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-112549549">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Many &quot;unschoolers&quot; that I have encountered didn&#39;t seem to have a real <br/>
philosophy, and their lives mostly resembled chaos-and many of the <br/>
children were obviously in need of boundries and structure.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I too have experience meeting families who call themselves &quot;unschoolers&quot; but<br/>
are either unfamiliar with or have actively rejected the kind of absolute<br/>
Trust based Unschooling that we talk about here. They will often describe<br/>
themselves as &quot;taking an unschooling approach&quot;. However, in contrast to<br/>
their lives resembling chaos, the reason I personally do not consider that<br/>
they are actually living an unschooling life is because of their very<br/>
clearly expressed educational/time structures and varyingly authoritarian<br/>
parenting approaches. Lots of &quot;limits&quot; enforced. This includes things like<br/>
&quot;we only do our curriculum in the mornings&quot; and &quot;I insist she keep her hair<br/>
cut short because she wouldn&#39;t brush it often enough&quot;, let alone &quot;We got rid<br/>
of our tv because my daughter wanted to watch it too much&quot;. Basically no<br/>
evidence of the chaotic *appearance* that freedom can create!<br/>
<br/>
What leads an observer to judge that children in another family are in need<br/>
of boundaries and structure? What criteria does one use to say &quot;obviously&quot;?<br/>
Is it behavior or how they treat each other or ways of speaking or physical<br/>
appearance or prioritizing with time or kids crying or kids wanting to spend<br/>
time away from their own homes or...what? I don&#39;t see families with children<br/>
begging for limits or rules (as far as I know), so I&#39;m not sure how to<br/>
recognize that. (Could be a paradox here...)<br/>
<br/>
I am absolutely sure that many a casual observer would consider our RU life<br/>
one of utter chaos - certainly the state of our too-small-for-our-stuff<br/>
apartment could give that impression. I am privately convinced that several<br/>
of the members of my local h/s group consider Jayn in need of &quot;boundaries&quot;<br/>
simply because I don&#39;t insist that she brush her hair, let alone the fact<br/>
that we never do anything remotely resembling a lesson. Some have expressed<br/>
their expectation that I will change my ideas (deeply held convictions)<br/>
about schooling and magically become more controlling by the time Jayn gets<br/>
to be &quot;in 8th grade&quot;, displaying only their own lack of understanding of how<br/>
RU works. Some would consider our life chaotic because of our rotating sleep<br/>
schedule. People are constantly saying to me &quot;I don&#39;t know how you do it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My priority is facilitating Jayn&#39;s general happiness. Not her personal<br/>
development or her education or her ability to make a success of her adult<br/>
life. All these things will happen perfectly well without being my first<br/>
focus. The occasions when her physical safety or health and her immediate<br/>
happiness are opposing are extremely rare. The occasions where her happiness<br/>
opposes the comfort or happiness of another person are also rare, and at<br/>
those times we work it out as needed. I just want her to enjoy her life -<br/>
her family, activities, friends, increasing competences and broadening<br/>
skills.<br/>
<br/>
Some people would define chaos as the absence of a plan, and I know there<br/>
are Unschooling kids who find knowing the plan for the day essential to<br/>
their comfort and security. My experience with Jayn is that plans beyond the<br/>
immediate future or very broad or general (eg: Tuesday is dance class day<br/>
and then we&#39;ll probably go to the park until whenever tbd; Thursday is<br/>
laundry day unless something cool comes up) often collapse. The dissolution<br/>
of a plan is more painful if I have become attached to it or to my desired<br/>
outcome. You know: &quot;The best laid plans of mice and men....&quot; Can this appear<br/>
chaotic to outsiders? I bet it does.<br/>
<br/>
For Jayn and I, it is less stressful to say we value flexibility,<br/>
spontaneity and improvisation - and practice Acceptance - rather than<br/>
express it negatively as &quot;being disorganized&quot;. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-454869049">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Many &quot;unschoolers&quot; that I have encountered didn&#39;t  seem to have a real <br/>
philosophy, and their lives mostly resembled chaos-and  many of the <br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;ve met self-proclaimed unschoolers who didn&#39;t seem to have any  philosophy, <br/>
and were just letting their kids run wild, in the bad sense of the  word--not <br/>
providing fun opportunities, not feeding them, not making sure they  had <br/>
clothes they liked that were also clean and in good repair.  And  if someone wants <br/>
to be neglectful, and sees out of the corner of her eye some  family where <br/>
the kids are running HAPPILY and wildly free, but can go back to  their parents <br/>
whenever they want to for good, direct attention, real food,  water, <br/>
sunscreen, sympathy, and then they say &quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing; I&#39;m an  unschooler too,&quot; <br/>
when they didn&#39;t even BRING water or sunscreen and if their  kids come by the <br/>
mom manages to just kind of hold them back with hands or  gestures while she <br/>
doesn&#39;t even look at them or interrupt the conversation  she&#39;s having with <br/>
other moms.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve never seen one of those families really see it through, though, and  not <br/>
just put their kids in school because they decide unschooling didn&#39;t  work.<br/>
 <br/>
If the moms are saying &quot;unschooling&quot; as a cover for not really getting it  <br/>
and not wanting to make it work fully and deeply and profoundly, it does make  <br/>
dedicated, mindful unschoolers as a group look bad, when we have to share in  <br/>
their reputation.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve seen kids who needed boundaries and structure, I thought, as  evidenced <br/>
by their crazed destructive disrespect for other people&#39;s things,  time, space <br/>
and sensibilities.   They weren&#39;t my kids.<br/>

If our stories and ideas make you  think and you&#39;re  interested and it <br/>
changes what you believe or do, that kind of learning can&#39;t be  helped.  That&#39;s the <br/>
whole idea behind unschooling.  But you won&#39;t be  learning from us so much as <br/>
building onto your personal internal model of the  universe.  All that <br/>
learning happens inside you and can&#39;t happen anywhere  else, and nobody else can do <br/>
it for you or to you.<br/>
 <br/>
There are other unschoolers who think this edge goes too far.  There  are <br/>
some other lists with the same philosophy as this one, I think:   <br/>
UnschoolingBasics, AlwaysUnschooled.  Those and some others are linked  here:<br/>

and set them in front of SpongeBob and had a seat at the computer or <br/>
on the phone until bedtime.<br/>
This is rare in my area-most homeschoolers here are strict <br/>
fundalmentists with very exact religious beliefs. This group of <br/>
people hold their children sooo tight, the kids can&#39;t walk six feet <br/>
away without a breakdown of the thought process. They have no TV, <br/>
don&#39;t know any current news, people, or events. Several people have <br/>
pulled their children away from mine because my daughter dresses a <br/>
little &quot;Kelly Osbornish&quot;:). I then encountered &quot;unschoolers&quot; note the <br/>
quotations...The ones I have encountered had their children on <br/>
several medications for behavior issues, feed their children nothing <br/>
but easy to prep junk (full of things that would CAUSE behavior <br/>
issues for many children) and spent almost NO time at all with their <br/>
children-and bragged about it.<br/>
I may be completely wrong, and please don&#39;t be afraid to yell at me <br/>
if I am...If the children are fighting for the parents attention, <br/>
eating all meals in front of the TV even though they don&#39;t seem to <br/>
want it that way, not able to speak a sentence at five, or have a <br/>
decent conversation at 9, they aren&#39;t being schooled or unschooled, <br/>
but neglected. Unfortunately, that is what I have experienced, too <br/>
often, in my neck of the woods. This is truely sad because <br/>
Unschooling seems to have much much more merrit then these people are <br/>
presenting.<br/>
I had a little girl come to my house one day and tell me that since <br/>
she starting homeschooling she never saw her mom. She said her mom <br/>
would talk to her on the way to school and home, each day. Now, she <br/>
said, all her mom did was watch tv and talk on the phone. (again, <br/>
not &quot;unschooling&quot; but &quot;unparenting&quot;.) She told my daughter she wished <br/>
for a mom like me-which, of course, made my daughter&#39;s head spin:)<br/>
I truely &quot;get&quot; the things that you write here, and I am really glad <br/>
to have discovered all of this. I give TONS of advice to new <br/>
homeschooler, and I always want to presents things correctly. <br/>
Describing &quot;unschooling&quot; from now on, from YOUR point of view, will <br/>
surely help many people.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is this-It doesn&#39;t matter how you homeschool-raise your <br/>
kids-as long as you are actually doing it with thought and love and <br/>
sense:)<br/>
<br/>
Again, I thank you all for opening my mind, and I will continue to <br/>
learn by reading your posts:)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
I agree with Kelly.  (Or way... do I DISagree?  &quot;with Kelly, I  disagree&quot;?)<br/>
 <br/>
People who ground their kids and make them work all the time they&#39;re not  <br/>
&quot;doing schoolwork&quot; and who spank them think they&#39;re being loving and  sensible.  <br/>
I question the &quot;thoughtful,&quot; but they would say thoughtful,  probably.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Their results are not better.  They gamble their relationship with the  child <br/>
and often lose it, and their results are not better than mine, which to  them <br/>
would SURELY look neglectful.  The other night my teenaged boys both  got <br/>
back really (really) late, Marty (16) at 3:00 or so (he was outside talking  to <br/>
his friends, both also homeschoolers and came in at 3:00) and Kirby closer to  <br/>
5:00 a.m.   I was up because I couldn&#39;t sleep.  I wasn&#39;t afraid  or angry.  <br/>
They hadn&#39;t been doing anything wrong, illegal or  dangerous.  They were with <br/>
people we know and were in safe places.   Marty and his friends had gone to the <br/>
rock house (a little hike in the mountains  here) and Kirby was at a friend&#39;s <br/>
house after the gaming shop closed.  They  had watched a movie and then played <br/>
a game, and it kept getting later.  <br/>
 <br/>
I could have had a bedtime and a curfew.  <br/>
If the principle is to know where kids are and to know they&#39;re safe,  though, <br/>
I have that.  And right now Kirby is in his room playing an XBox  game with <br/>
his friend Joey (who paid for the game but doesn&#39;t own an XBox.   Marty is at <br/>
work and will be home in an hour or so.  Holly is asleep in  Charmouth, in <br/>
southern England, but I talked to her for nearly an hour earlier  today.<br/>
 <br/>
Living without rules, living by principle, can look neglectful to those who  <br/>
have been told and are passing on the &quot;truths&quot; to their kids, that rules keep  <br/>
people safe and happy.  That&#39;s not true.  Marty did well at a junior  police <br/>
academy summer before last.  One of the instructors was GUSHING to  me about <br/>
how much they admired and enjoyed Marty.  He said you could always  tell when a <br/>
kid comes from a home with a lot of rules and discipline.<br/>
 <br/>
No, he couldn&#39;t.<br/>
He was unable to recognize (or even to imagine, I bet) that something that  <br/>
impressive could be the product of no rules, no discipline, but living by  <br/>
principles, as directly and lovingly together as we could.   Being  with them, <br/>
more BEing than &quot;with.&quot;  <br/>

people hold their children sooo tight, the kids can&#39;t walk six feet<br/>
away without a breakdown of the thought process. **<br/>
<br/>
Compared to this, benign neglect has some good points.  (Even though benign neglect is not unschooling.)<br/>
