<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Though all the game systems have titles exclusive to those systems, there<br/>
are some popular recurring characters that are exclusive to Nintendo like<br/>
Mario and Pokemon.<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo tends to have a lot more games for the under teen group and fewer<br/>
for teens.<br/>
<br/>
The new titles for the GameCube are coming out *slowly* so they may not have<br/>
much to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
The XBox just dropped $100 so it&#39;s down to the $200 range now. That probably<br/>
indicates it hasn&#39;t been as popular as Bill Gates hoped but he&#39;s got a lot<br/>
of money to keep it afloat for a while ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Could you fantasize with him which system he&#39;d buy and why? You might be<br/>
able to pull it off and make it sound like general conversation and not<br/>
fishing for present ideas ;-)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29161999">My son just bought a GameCube after considerable debate. (Then they dropped<br/>
$50; it was quite frustrating for him to get a lesson in economics this<br/>
way!) Have him go to a Target or game store and play all the different<br/>
systems so he&#39;ll get a feel for each. Sean balanced the games available vs<br/>
cost vs expected lifespan vs graphics. Don&#39;t forget the different features,<br/>
like Playstation being able to play DVDs. That&#39;s what he wants now....<br/>

<br/>
If you go to a gaming/computer shop or ToysRUs you can try the games out, <br/>
usually.  <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s being played here seems to be quick and competitive games on the 64, <br/>
and long drawn out role-playing things on the PS2.  Kirby complained that <br/>
there were NO role playing games for 64, but just got one which was for <br/>
either 64 or game cube this week. (I keep writing while they&#39;re asleep and I <br/>
can&#39;t check, and when they&#39;re awake they take the computer away from me! &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
 Whatever was on the cover of Nintendo Power, he went and bought.  I LOVE him <br/>
having a job!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115165368">We bought a Nintendo64 at Christmas and have sinced realized the benefits<br/>
of other systems.  I don&#39;t regret the purchase though since the games are<br/>
much cheaper due to it&#39;s discontinuance.  We&#39;re able to buy a lot of<br/>
games from ebay and used game stores.<br/>
<br/>
I think my next purchase will be the Playstation 2 because they seem to<br/>
have the kind of games that interest me the most.  I also like the idea<br/>
of getting a gaming system and DVD player in one.<br/>
<br/>
However, we are HUGE fans of the Zelda series of games so I know we will<br/>
be getting the Gamecube eventually as well.  Video games have become a<br/>
big hit with the entire family and we spend a lot of hours together<br/>
watching one or the other play.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749790701">Hi Cindy,<br/>
I asked my 2 teenage sons, who&#39;ve been playing vid games most of their lives, to comment on your question.  Below&#39;s my 19-year old&#39;s response; hope it&#39;s helpful!<br/>
--Juanita (Ithaca, NY)<br/>

<br/>
Well, choosing the best system is all about picking genres.<br/>
If you like games oriented towards a younger audience, a Gamecube would be the best choice, PlayStation 2 has more adult oriented games, and although I do not have one, XBox seems to be more on the PlayStation side.<br/>
This is of course not set in stone, for example; GameCube has the game Resident Evil, which is absolutely not for children, and it&#39;s not hard to find games like Super Bombad Racing for PlayStation.<br/>
So, it&#39;s really up to how adult you want the games.<br/>
Also, the GameCube does not play DVD movies and the XBox requires a special remote control to do so.<br/>
So the PlayStation has a slight advantage being the only one that can play DVDs straight out of the box.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>

little more $$ that have 1,056 blocks.  We got our GameCube from an eBay<br/>
auction, and it came with a standard card, extra contoller and a game; one<br/>
of the first things my kids did was buy the upgraded card.<br/>

&gt;(Same for X-Box.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually the X-box has an 8Gb hard disk (~50,000 blocks of memory) for<br/>
internal storage, so it isn&#39;t necessary to buy the memory cards for the<br/>
controller(s) unless you want to take your saved games to a friend&#39;s house<br/>
and play there.  There are some times when this would be nice, like with<br/>
Halo, where your character has certain level limitations based on your<br/>
experience, so starting a new character isn&#39;t optimal.<br/>
<br/>
We have a PS1, PS2, Dreamcast and X-box (and a gameboy advance<br/>
but that&#39;s a whole different realm). We use the X-box more than<br/>
anything else.  We&#39;ve rented the gamecube and it didn&#39;t motivate a quick<br/>
purchase.  If your children are under 10 and you aren&#39;t planning to play a<br/>
lot,<br/>
I&#39;d say PS2 is probably the best value because of the many child-oriented<br/>
games.<br/>
<br/>
For older kids and adults the X-box has a noticeable edge, but it will<br/>
probably<br/>
become overwhelming within a year or so when Microsoft releases and<br/>
mass markets it&#39;s broadband, real-time, internet gaming and another hundred<br/>
titles or so.  X-box is the only High Definition compatible gaming console,<br/>
and it has a built in cable modem along with the built in hard disk.  It<br/>
also<br/>
serves as a DVD movie player like the PS2.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of sites on the web that compare features and games - these<br/>
can help you decide - check out your favorite search engine.</div>
