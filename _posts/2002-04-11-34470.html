<div id="ygrps-yiv-631139346">Ok all<br/>
I have a 6 year old and 8 year old that have been out of ps since 10-2000 and we left our Charter School thingy in December. We are taking trip to the Grand Canyon next week. The kids got to pic the place we went to and help Dad to plan the trip. My question is, (given their ages and the fact that we are unschooling now, meaning no requirements to do anything :school: related) can I help them to learn more than they already will while on the trip? My son has already said he wants to take his journal to write in, he likes reading his writing later on. I have also bought them disposable cameras to use as they wish on the trip. They asked for books on the Grand Canyon from the library and we have done that. So being that I am new to the unschooling thing, is there anything else that I can do to help them to make the most of this trip?<br/>
Thanks <br/>
God bless<br/>

  I read WC Fields said, &quot;If at first you don&#39;t succeed, try, try again,<br/>
  and then give up.  There&#39;s no sense being a damn fool about it.&quot;  I think<br/>
  sometimes we do need to see something through, and even torture is<br/>
  endurable if we take it one second at a time and know there will be an<br/>
  end to it.  But there do come times when we need to give ourselves some<br/>
  slack and allow ourselves to lighten our load of the unnecessaries.  I<br/>
  think the best thing to do is to really listen to why the child wants to<br/>
  quit the class and question how productive it would be to stick with it<br/>
  and list the pros and cons of quitting or staying with the child.  That&#39;s<br/>
  when they really surprise me with how creative and insightful they can<br/>
  be, when they get all the information and weigh it in their own mind<br/>
  rather than being told what they should think about it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065199298">Thanks Pam, that is exactly what I had in mind for the trip. I am SO excited that this is where the kids decided to take our vacation to as I havent been before. So in these kinds of situations I learn as much as they do if not more. I have decided that homeschooling/unschooling is really all about ME! I love to learn and what better excuse than to do it with my kids!<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten involved in so many things because of my kids. For example, I now <br/>
know much more about horses, ceramics, and opera than I ever would have if <br/>
the kids hadn&#39;t gotten interested first.<br/>
<br/>
And - as the kids get older, you&#39;ll learn FROM them in more concrete ways - I <br/>
mean, they&#39;ll know way more than you do about various things and they&#39;ll <br/>
teach you about what they know.<br/>

If you went on a road trip with an adult friend and you knew more about the <br/>
place than she did, wouldn&#39;t you answer her questions or show her interesting <br/>
stuff?  If you saw a deer or a hawk, wouldn&#39;t you point it out?  If she was <br/>
broke and wanted a book from the gift shop, wouldn&#39;t you buy it for her if <br/>
you could?<br/>
<br/>
I think if you think of it as treating them as people instead of as <br/>
&quot;students,&quot; you won&#39;t have any problems deciding how to act.  Excitement is <br/>
excitement!!<br/>
<br/>
If you see a certain layer in the sandstone that seems thinner in one place <br/>
than in others, that&#39;s worth pointing out no matter who&#39;s with you.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So being that I am new to the unschooling thing, is there anything else <br/>
that I can do to help them to make the most of this trip?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the river itself--where does it come from, and where does it go? <br/>
--that would be interesting to me.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the park itself--how long has it been a protected area, and what things <br/>
were done once that aren&#39;t done as much.  What human impact is there?  <br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t sound like a teacher, and if you don&#39;t make them pay attention <br/>
while you&#39;re talking (if it&#39;s interesting and timed to their interest they <br/>
WILL pay attention, in short bursts), and if there&#39;s no review or test, then <br/>
it&#39;s just conversation and inquiry.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to say everything you have to say while you&#39;re there.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly and I got to go to England because friends are living there.  There <br/>
were thousands of things I could have said to her while she was in cathedrals <br/>
or castles or London or going through farmland on trains.  I pointed some <br/>
things out, we talked about what was different, but she was eight.  Since <br/>
then she has spoken of those things and places often, as her understanding of <br/>
the world grows.  And sometimes something comes up and I&#39;ll related it to <br/>
what she saw there.  That learning will go on her whole life.  If she ever <br/>
gets to go back, she&#39;ll be comparing that trip with the first one.<br/>
<br/>
So your kids will think and learn about the Grand Canyon from now on!<br/>

bought a lot of fruit, peanut butter and crackers, and we all had our<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-147237197">Disposible cameras!  Also, we do &quot;wish lists&quot; before we head out on a trip.<br/>
&quot;what would you want if you were locked in a car for a week?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A couple of winters ago we went up to Crater Lake.  The kidlets did their<br/>
wish lists and then we went shopping.  They wanted maps, journals,<br/>
binoculars, lots of AA batteries, books about the area, AND books about<br/>
craters and volcanos!<br/>
<br/>
Youngest wanted two maps and she cut them up as drove and put the section we<br/>
drove on a page in her journal and then wrote stuff about it.<br/>
<br/>
Middle kidlet used his journal to document each roll of film and what each<br/>
picture was about.<br/>
<br/>
Eldest used his to write notes to himself which had absolutely nothing to do<br/>
with the trip.  What was interesting was that when we got home and he went<br/>
through his check list of &quot;to do&quot; things he had written down, he could tell<br/>
you all about where we were when he wrote them.<br/>
<br/>
but all of them agree that the greatest invention of the 20th century was<br/>
disposible cameras!  They love taking buckets of them with us on trips<br/>
because each of them has different interests and that way they can each<br/>
record &quot;their&quot; definition of what they see.<br/>

&gt; Ok all<br/>
&gt; I have a 6 year old and 8 year old that have been out of ps since 10-2000<br/>
and we left our Charter School thingy in December. We are taking trip to the<br/>
Grand Canyon next week. The kids got to pic the place we went to and help<br/>
Dad to plan the trip. My question is, (given their ages and the fact that we<br/>
are unschooling now, meaning no requirements to do anything :school:<br/>
related) can I help them to learn more than they already will while on the<br/>
trip? My son has already said he wants to take his journal to write in, he<br/>
likes reading his writing later on. I have also bought them disposable<br/>
cameras to use as they wish on the trip. They asked for books on the Grand<br/>
Canyon from the library and we have done that. So being that I am new to the<br/>
unschooling thing, is there anything else that I can do to help them to make<br/>
the most of this trip?<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>

&gt;   rather than being told what they should think about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-577425369">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m heading out on vacation for the next two weeks, so I&#39;m suspending e-mail <br/>
during that time. Can&#39;t deal with 1000 plus e-mails or even the number on <br/>
digest on my return. I&#39;ll miss reading the posts though.<br/>
<br/>
I was looking forward to this vacation until my husband spoke with his mother <br/>
this morning. My children have been with their grandparents the past week. <br/>
She&#39;s prepared to &quot;talk with us&quot; about our daughter. &quot;She needs to be dealt <br/>
with&quot;. My MIL doesn&#39;t like any child who questions her or doesn&#39;t obey her. <br/>
Unfortunately she also thinks that Carly does nothing but watch SNL or Whose <br/>
Line is it Anyway. My MIL never took the time to find out what a cool person <br/>
my daughter is or what her interests are. No wonder that&#39;s all she wants to <br/>
do up there. She loves anything to do with the arts and many other things. <br/>
Plus she needs to talk about our method of homeschooling. We&#39;re obviously <br/>
depriving our children of a true education.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I&#39;m venting. I&#39;m so angry.<br/>
<br/>
Wish me luck,<br/>
Ginny<br/>
I&#39;ve already suspended mail, so don&#39;t worry about responding<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Oh I will, I will. :-) Hey do you have the Mississippi coin from last<br/>
&gt; year? I came across a Louisiana today I&#39;m saving it for you. Still looking<br/>
&gt; for the others. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bring all the cool coins that you can get your hands on!  I can&#39;t check<br/>
Tim&#39;s coin collection right now, it&#39;s in his room and he&#39;s asleep.  But I&#39;m<br/>
doing a funshop on coins for the conference, anyway, so bring good stuff you<br/>
have lying around to trade.  Besides, state quarters are spendable if nobody<br/>
wants them!<br/>

    Ok. I didn&#39;t know you were doing a workshop on coins. That&#39;s really<br/>
cool. I&#39;m quite interested in that. :-)<br/>
