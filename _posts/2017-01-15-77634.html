<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101501749">I use google to find my own stuff, because there’s so much of it out there, so sometimes I come across mentions of me, or links, elsewhere.  I found something very sweet, about a family changing their practices after the parents heard me speak.  I’ll quote some of that in a minute, but I looked at some of the comments.  I shouldn’t have, maybe, but I found this:<br/>

I am not going to set my children up to only have the choice of being a cartoonist. If they are passionate about making cartoons, fine. If they are vegging out, slack jawed and bored, not Ok. And whats’s wrong with cartoons? Studied have proven negative mental impact of certain cartoons, but you had already mentioned the quality difference so we may agree on that point.<br/>

what study?<br/>
_________<br/>
<br/>
And there it has sat for four years.  <br/>
<br/>
When a family believes that “studies have proven” something, and they limit their children based on that, that’s more than a single problem.<br/>
If a parent reads something actual, true and thoughtful, based on experiences, and extrapolates from that that watching TV and being on the internet can prepare children for nothing but to be cartoonists, and that those without a passion to be cartoonists would be “vegging out, slack jawed and bored,” it seems to me to be fear overlaid on willful ignorance of the writer’s own children, of the nature of boredom, and of a harsh justification of the need to belittle and to control children.<br/>
<br/>
That looks harsh, but I think perhaps I’m being kinder than some parents deserve.  Perhaps not this very parent.  And maybe &quot;Lo Shmo&quot; has changed her mind.  <br/>
<br/>
The blog post said this, about my part in the changes in the family.  The post referenced was an HSC conference in California:<br/>
<br/>
_________<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago, my family and I attended the Adventures in Homeschooling conference. We had such a blast. It was my second time to go with my daughter, Kate, but this time I brought my husband Seth and my inlaws, Ed and Nancy (both former schoolteachers, they can’t stop raving about the conference).<br/>
<br/>
At the conference, we got to hear Sandra Dodd speak. Sandra is the author of Sandra Dodd’s Big Book of Unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I’d heard about unschooling prior to the conference but I was skeptical. Deep down I thought unschooling was just a bunch of lazy parents who did not want to take the time and energy to properly homeschool their children. I thought these parents were just not strict enough to enforce bed times and schedules. I was pretty certain that unschooled kids would end up not properly educated.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd changed my mind. My husband’s too. We were absolutely blown away by her lecture, and we left the conference, a copy of her book in hand (which is amazing), 150% committed to unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
UPDATE: It’s been 4 years now since I wrote this post, and unschooling was the best possible choice we could have made. At the end of this post, I will explain why unschooling and not limiting my daughter’s screen time has made her smarter, happier and just the most amazing kid!<br/>

The author lists the arguments against “screentime” and then states what she has learned and seen, for each.  It’s a good blogpost, by Ann Marie MIchaels, at Cheeseslave.com<br/>

I was looking for something I had written about sticks hung on the wall in twisted twine, in historical Korean dramas.  I had another picture to put with that post, wherever it is.
