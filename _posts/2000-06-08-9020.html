&lt;&lt; Her demand for swim trunks on my babies gave me the urge to march over <br/>
there and ask her to please refrain from screaming obscenities and abusing <br/>
her children where mine could hear and see it.  Of course I didn&#39;t, as that <br/>
would be petty and childish.  But I just felt the need to vent and share the <br/>
event with all of you.  It upset me a bit.<br/>

what I do in my babe do in our own yard is our business!<br/>
<br/>
I saw an older brother (15 or so) teasing his little brother (8 maybe) that <br/>
the little one was scared to go past him into his own house.  I was walking <br/>
the dog.  I spoke right up and informed him that he should be protecting and <br/>
helping his brother instead of scaring him.  He told me that &quot;it is my <br/>
brother and he isn&#39;t anything but a cry baby&quot;  I told him &quot;you would probably <br/>
be crying to if someone twice your size was picking on you&quot;  Not the most <br/>
intellegant response but all I could think of in a hurry.  I asked the little <br/>
one if I could help him home, but of course he refused and continued to cry <br/>
as I walked angryly away.  <br/>
<br/>
While we are venting, DO NOT  have your kids picture taken at Wal-mart before <br/>
checking them out first.  My kids are slow to warm up to people so I took <br/>
them as soon as the photo place opened.  The lady proceeded to tell me that <br/>
my kids were very shy (a label I am trying not to use with them) and got <br/>
frustrated that they would not sit still and smile as she asked on a very <br/>
narrow table.  They ARE 3 AND 1!  So I did all the work to get them to smile, <br/>
which was fine, if there had been film in the camera!  After waiting 3 weeks, <br/>
I called to see if they the pictures were in and the manager said that the <br/>
lady that took our pictures was new and didn&#39;t know that there was no film <br/>
there.  Now main stream kids who are shuffled from place to place and person <br/>
to person, this would not be a problem.  However, for us just a trip across <br/>
town is an event that requires special cirrumstances, timing and a small <br/>
mircle from God!.  (little one has to be in the mood or screams the entire <br/>
trip)  So I said forget it I will go to a Olan Mills which is right down the <br/>
street and they open earlier.  I called and talk to the lady about my <br/>
cautious children and she said &quot;Thanks for the information.  Come early and I <br/>
will play with them first.&quot;  YEPPY. <br/>
<br/>
When I call the Wal-mart studio, they told me I had to come back when they <br/>
had cash in their drawer to give to me. BTW which is never early in the <br/>
morning when my kids will ride in the car!  The whole experience just angers <br/>
me!  So we went yesterday, when the little one took a nap in the car seat and <br/>
Ali (3) was so tired she could hardly walk to get our $50 back.  When we got <br/>
there, the manager was taking a picture of a little boy probably 3 and was <br/>
say rather nasty &quot;it is going to take longer if you keep moving.  see you <br/>
already have moved from the way I put you.&quot;  and she was acting very <br/>
frustrated and angry.  HELLO IF YOU DON&#39;T LIKE AND RESPECT CHILDREN GET A <br/>
DIFFERENT JOB, LADY!!!!  The parents did not say  anything thought you could <br/>
tell the father was getting peeved.  The manager proceed to take my number <br/>
and tell me she did not have any money to give me but would call me.  I was <br/>
not happy!  We did some shopping and went back (almost 2 hrs later) and did <br/>
get our refund, but not without a lot of anger and stress.</div>

Hi Julie. I&#39;ve had similar experiences with photographers and I know what<br/>
you mean about the difficulty of getting ready and going out with small<br/>
children. I&#39;ve pretty much resigned to just taking photos myself and having<br/>
them enlarged, but I found an older lady who has obviously been a mother<br/>
before  that I use when we do use a photographer. I think that makes a big<br/>
difference--if they&#39;ve been a mother themselves.<br/>
And as for shyness, people have annoyingly commented about my daughter<br/>

&quot;No she&#39;s not shy, she just has to get to know you,&quot; which is true. Kids<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We had a nightmare with Olan Mills at Christmas and I will never use them<br/>
again. My dh&#39;s whole side of the family was getting together for a family<br/>
portrait (13 of us in all). Not only were we having the large group, but all<br/>
of us were each doing smaller groups (our own families, kids, one of just<br/>
the cousins, etc). We were going to purchase 2 of the biggest cameo<br/>
portraits they have, over $125 ea. plus others. We probably were going to be<br/>
spending over $500 in all. It took forever for them to take us in for the<br/>
pictures and the photgrapher was extremly rude. Two weeks later they called<br/>
us and told us we had to go back and have them taken all over again! They<br/>
had cut off someone&#39;s head in the large group photo and the one of my family<br/>
had a light in it that wasn&#39;t supposed to be. So we all gort ready and<br/>
trugged back (with a special appointment). We walked into a mob scene. After<br/>
~20-30 min. the photographer appeared and told us there was a 4 hour wait!<br/>
Needless to say we walked out and they lost $500. It still makes me mad to<br/>
this day!<br/>
