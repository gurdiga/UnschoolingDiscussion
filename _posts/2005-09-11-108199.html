<div id="ygrps-yiv-533152863">+++Joyce Fetteroll has created a well-organized (naturally) and clear set of <br/>
responses to an assortment of questions and arguments over the past few years, <br/>
and made them available.    Please save this link and put it where you can find <br/>
it when people want to read (or argue about) unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Pages like this will make lists like this obsolete, but honestly that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be such a bad thing.+++<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Very cool!!<br/>
Anyway to get it in book form?  Hint Hint Hint &lt;g&gt;<br/>
