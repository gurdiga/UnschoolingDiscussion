<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097284870">Count me almost in on the 3 boy list.  My triplets are almost three and I&#39;ve <br/>
subscribed to the list so that I can benefit from thinking about what you all <br/>
have to say as they grow.  Just finished Learning All the Time by John Holt <br/>
and am only sorry I didn&#39;t read it sooner.  Very exciting book.  Nicki just <br/>
introduced herself as having a 5 yr old and I&#39;ll be watching how it goes with <br/>
her.  Having three the same age is a slightly different kettle of fish in all <br/>
areas, but kids are kids everywhere.  I live in central NJ and haven&#39;t hooked <br/>
up with our local support group yet because the boys still nap in the <br/>
afternoon and the group meets once a week at a park/skating rink during <br/>
naptime.</div>
