<div id="ygrps-yiv-867802084">Does anyone know a source for, or want to sell me, a VHS recorder for Holly?  <br/>
That&#39;s what she wants for Christmas.  Not digital camera, but one that just <br/>
takes full-sized videotapes.  I thought it would be easier to find one.  I <br/>
went to ebay but mostly saw too-big ones and the kind with miniature tapes.  <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the official name for those with full-size tapes?  Maybe I just need <br/>
help knowing exactly what I&#39;m looking for.<br/>
<br/>
If I could drive and walk, I&#39;d go to pawn shops.<br/>
<br/>
Help!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Hey, Sandra!<br/>
<br/>
I just called my husband, who works in a TV studio at a local college, and <br/>
picked his brain on this.  Ironically, he was just taking with the studio <br/>
manager, who was also complaining about the dearth of those <br/>
things.  They&#39;re just not making them anymore.  They&#39;re officially called <br/>
VHS camcorders, and Jim thought that you could either get one second hand <br/>
(Half.com?) or perhaps a retail outlet is blowing out a line.  Jim <br/>
suggested contacting B&H Photo, a huge retailer in NYC, who would have them <br/>
if anyone did.  You don&#39;t want VHS-C, which is the official name for the <br/>
miniature tapes, although Jim says that there is an adapter to play the <br/>
VHS-C tapes in VHS players.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here&#39;s a link for B&H:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/">http://www.bhphotovideo.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps!<br/>
