&lt;&lt; &quot;. . . unschooling does not work for all children.  <br/>
<br/>
Some children (and adults) are very happy vegetating.  Others are <br/>
<br/>
a sponge when it comes to learning.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling doesn&#39;t work for parents who are cynical, critical and <br/>
negative.<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling takes a pretty high level of optimism and joy.<br/>
<br/>
The people I&#39;ve met who said they wanted to unschool but who failed to <br/>
successfully do so have more than once, more than three times, been people who <br/>
sighed and rolled their eyes about things, who had lots of irritations about styles <br/>
of music, or prejudices about literature or media or &quot;hated&quot; something (or <br/>
lots of things) like movies, or modern culture, or Disney, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Hatred and negativity can keep unschooling from working.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how much of negativity and cynicism can just be inherited <br/>
genetically, but as with most other things, someone born cynical but raised in a <br/>
happy, encouraging, upbeat environment will probably do okay!  And someone who is <br/>
born really optimistic could be raised in an oppressive, discouraging <br/>
environment and probably also do okay.<br/>
<br/>
Someone cynical raised by cynics won&#39;t find the joy in learning nor in <br/>
anything else, it seems to me.<br/>

Extremely well said!<br/>
<br/>
Everyday, unschooling is an adventure for me. Sometimes I get frightened - &quot;AM I doing the right thing??&quot;<br/>
But the fact is, my daughter is happy and smart and curious and kind and creative and resourceful and affectionate and the list goes on.<br/>
Maybe not all of this is due to unschooling - but I know that much of it is!<br/>
