<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769454496">&lt;&lt; ...on his fourth bowl of ice cream.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe the servings are too small. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For a little kid, the thrill of FOUR bowls is more exciting than one big bowl <br/>
he might not finish.  <br/>
<br/>
For the mom, she gets to keep being generous and say &quot;yes&quot; over and over <br/>
instead of just once.<br/>
<br/>
For the ice cream, more of it stayed in the freezer; he wasn&#39;t eating melted <br/>
ice-cream soup.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes adults forget a little kid can get a true thrill out of getting <br/>
dimes and nickels instead of quarters, because there&#39;s &quot;MORE&quot; and some <br/>
variety--sorting opportunities, and counting opportunities, and comparison of <br/>
size, color, weight, art, edges...<br/>
