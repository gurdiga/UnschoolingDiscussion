&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gotta say I agree with this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My parents always expected respect, even when they didn&#39;t earn it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I refuse to live that way.  I don&#39;t care who a person is, they will *earn* <br/>
&gt; my respect.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Those who earn my respect (who I also may not know personally) would include <br/>
&gt; people who have had to earn their own way from the bottom up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there is a huge difference  between &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;polite&quot;. No, I <br/>
don&#39;t respect everyone, that&#39;s ridiculus. If someone is a stranger they may not <br/>
get my respect (how could I give it knowing nothing about them), which I think <br/>
of as an internal feeling/belief but they will get a polite response. (unless <br/>
they are of course, mugging me or hitting me or yelling at my kids or <br/>
something similar).<br/>
Being polite isn&#39;t showing respect, it treating other how you would want to <br/>
be treated yourself. It&#39;s kindness.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with this completely.<br/>
<br/>
  And on the &quot;rank&quot; thread, I also had some thoughts.   Some folks seem <br/>
bothered that most folks recognize rank in relating to others.   I do agree that in <br/>
some cases, rank should not exist.   A celebrity, in my opinion, does not <br/>
&quot;outrank&quot; another person when it comes to the way they should be treated or in <br/>
the care or justice they recieve.   But, rank does have to exist for us to exist <br/>
as civilized people.   In it&#39;s most base form, think of rank in emergency <br/>
situations... &quot;Women and children first,  then, most likely, elderly men, then <br/>
perhaps men of higher status ( and maybe not, depending on the itegrity of the <br/>
men involved).  In an emergency situation, injuries are also ranked.  The folks <br/>
in worse shape will outrank the folks with minor injuries.  The question of <br/>
rank is not something that we really deal with on a day in day out basis.  We <br/>
live in and among our families and friends and peers and co-workers, and for <br/>
the most part, we are all  the same rank, we are people who care for and love <br/>
and respect each other with no regard for who is &quot;above&quot; whom..   But, on <br/>
occasion, rank does come to into play, and to want to pretend like it does not <br/>
exist, or claim that you can ignore it, is not really a feasible possiblility.    <br/>
If an oncoming car was headed for your child and the child of a stranger, but <br/>
you could only save one child,  surely, your child would outrank the stranger.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477532972">Ok.<br/>
<br/>
I agree there is a difference between respect and being polite, though being polite could be construed as being respectful.  Maybe that is where the confusion is.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I can be polite to someone without respecting them &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
As for rank, I agree that on certain days, certain people get a &quot;place of honor&quot;, the bride, a graduate, or the guy who has the know-how to fix your car.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t consider those things examples of rank.  <br/>
<br/>
So, in the end, I probably agree with everyone on the rank issue without calling it rank.  And I agree on the politeness issue if its not confused with internal respect.<br/>
<br/>
Shoot, does that mean I have to now get off the couch?<br/>
