<div id="ygrps-yiv-322380230">We had a similar issue in the recent past and the children came up with their <br/>
own solution. A sign up sheet. Each person was give 1 hour. This lasted for <br/>
about a week. This idea worked, but NOT like the children (or myself) expected. <br/>
We all saw that sometimes a person may need a lot of time and other times <br/>
just a few short minutes. I was very impressed with my children finding a <br/>
solution they all agreed upon, however. For the time being, that in itself has <br/>
changed the way we all view our need for computer time and the respect of others.<br/>
