<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890284632">The problem is - where should we shop???  I live in a college town of <br/>
about 40,000.  I don&#39;t care for Wal-Mart either.  In fact,  right now <br/>
they&#39;re suing our town because their proposal for a super-center was <br/>
turned down.  Wal-Mart says that the city commision&#39;s interpretation <br/>
of zoning was incorrect and so the denial was illegal.  This issue <br/>
has really divided our town.  Some people hate Wal-Mart - some  <br/>
think the super center would bring business to town.  The problem is <br/>
that when you live in a town this size,  options are limited.  We <br/>
have a Wal-Mart,  a K-Mart and a mall with downsized versions of <br/>
Penney&#39;s, Sears,  and Dillard - no Gap or Old Navy.   I don&#39;t have to think too hard to <br/>
remember controversies with Sears over bait and switch and Dillards <br/>
over their treatment of African Americans.  So.......where do we <br/>
shop?  Our last locally owned dept. store closed years ago and our <br/>
locally owned grocery store was recently bought out by Kroger.<br/>
The few Mom and Pop stores in town are gift shops and the like.<br/>
Our family actually does a lot of mail order,  but I&#39;m not sure <br/>
that&#39;s any better.  I notice that many of the clothes are made in <br/>
countries known to encourage sweatshops.  We&#39;ve simplified a lot and <br/>
don&#39;t enjoy shopping,  but there are still times when we have to.  <br/>
So.........where do you all shop?<br/>

and is in the north-central part of the state - in an area known as <br/>
the Flint Hills.    And to all of you who are thinking - Hills in <br/>
Kansas???  Yes,  there are hills in Kansas.   Only a portion of <br/>
Kansas fits the flat stereotype that we&#39;re all familiar with. <br/>
The Flint Hills are beautiful, large, rounded, dark hills,  with very <br/>
few trees.<br/>

The *correct* answer is to shop at locally owned stores stocked with<br/>
locally made products.  My dilemma is my budget.  I should probably get a<br/>
job, Ha ha.  Seriously though, it is hard to spend more when it can be<br/>
bought for less at one of the big stores.  And don&#39;t you worry about our<br/>
economy collapsing when the Church of Consumerism is finally exposed?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512804360">we also live in a town of about 40,000. All we have here is a Wal-Mart <br/>
Supercenter, Walgreens and an Eckerds. Taco Bell, McDonalds, Burger King, nad <br/>
up until 6 mos ago we got a Chic Fil A. BUt the reason we dont have all the <br/>
stuff y&#39;all I have is I think cause we live on the edge of a town of almost <br/>
200,000&lt;Arlington TX {Home of 6 Flags and Hurricane Harbor}&gt; Which as you can <br/>
imagine has eeeevvvveeerrrryyyttthhhiiiiiinnnnngggg and ANYTHING you could <br/>
want. <br/>
     And the bad thing about living that close is they are all moving in on <br/>
US! Trying to get out of the *BIG CITY* and into the *COUNTRY*. And our Taxes <br/>
have gone up 3 times. Our house payment has gone from 660.00 to 850.00 cause <br/>
of taxes. <br/>
     So now we are OUTTA HERE!!!!! HAH! Moving to Tyler Texas and getting <br/>
OUTTA this mad house &lt;bwaaahhahahahahaaa&gt;<br/>

I like about them is that they promote from within and everyone except<br/>

We are doing so much simplifying that there are few things that I don&#39;t get<br/>
at the thrift store, the consignment store, the &quot;New To You&quot; store or make<br/>
myself.  I mean, I won&#39;t use someone else&#39;s cast off spatula (yuck) and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499138485">Hey, I love it when they have the prices wrong in the computer.  That&#39;s a<br/>
$3 credit on each item (or free if the price is under $3).  I guess these<br/>
big companies don&#39;t like to see me coming for a reason &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to the court case, these were in and the age discrimination thing<br/>
was in with almost all large companies in the U.S. for a while.  Haven&#39;t<br/>
seen any lately, so don&#39;t know if the aren&#39;t &quot;news&quot; anymore or if the<br/>
