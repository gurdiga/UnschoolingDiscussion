&gt; &gt; .  She ends up looking very messy and.well.uncombed.  Once or<br/>
&gt; &gt; twice a week I force her to have it washed and combed.  In the spirit of an<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling household where kids have a choice, am I doing something wrong<br/>
&gt; &gt; and damaging to our mutual trust?  It feels uncomfortable to force her, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both my boys have long hair and all I have to do is remind them of what it<br/>
&gt; was like last week when they didn&#39;t want their hair combed then after a few<br/>
&gt; days decided they wanted it brushed out.  What a mess and took a lot of time<br/>
&gt; and gentle brushing to get all those knots out.  When I remind them of that<br/>
&gt; and how much easier it is if it is bushed on a daily basis they are more than<br/>
&gt; willing to sit still for a minute.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Also we figured out that if I braid the hair at night it helps with knots as<br/>
&gt; well.  And using a hard brush, you know the ones with the stiff plastic<br/>
&gt; bristles when the hair is wet and has lots of conditioner on it, before you<br/>
&gt; rinse the conditioner out it is easier to get through the tougher tangles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do give them a choice and they even brush their own hair occasionally, just<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t reach the back very well.<br/>

more tangles the better :-) She looks pretty good too.<br/>
My boys also have long hair but for some reason their hair doesn&#39;t tangle or mat. Weird.<br/>
