<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646905582">We don&#39;t have a magic age here.  In Texas, there isn&#39;t a legal age either<br/>
(it is assumed that it will vary with the kids and the parents are the best<br/>
judges).<br/>
<br/>
My oldest has been left alone since she was 8.  She is now almost 12 and is<br/>
so responsible and mature that I tease her that she is really 42.  I<br/>
occasionally leave her in charge of the younger siblings for short periods,<br/>
like running up the road to the store.<br/>
<br/>
Zach is 9 and is sometimes left for short periods.  I worry more about him<br/>
because he would be more apt to do stuff that he knew I would think was a<br/>
bad idea, like play on the roof.  Luckily, he is an &quot;out and about&quot; kind of<br/>
guy and usually wants to go with us.<br/>
<br/>
Marsie is 5 and asks to stay home by herself but I just can&#39;t see it.  And<br/>
the other guys are way, way too little.<br/>

Same here.<br/>
My kids are fine staying home alone around 8-9 (so far) and my 12 y.o. <br/>
babysits the  whole lot of them occasionally.<br/>
In past times, children ran farm equipment and loads of other things we would <br/>
think &quot;too young&quot; about now.<br/>
So it&#39;s not so much about their capability level at certain ages as what the <br/>
parents can trust with.  By 8-9 most children can understand very well about <br/>
getting somewhere safe in a fire and so on.....of course I&#39;d want a good <br/>
neighbor available before I left, a safe home to run to.<br/>
I think if they&#39;re trusted quite a lot from a very young age, they will be <br/>
perfectly capable of handling the home alone thing. If THEY are comfortable <br/>
with it. Not all 8-9 y.o.&#39;s want to be alone. Some are more people dependant.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-530869036">I&#39;ve never MADE a kid stay.  Never said, &quot;NO you&#39;re not going with me, you&#39;re <br/>
staying HERE! ALONE!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That makes a heck of a difference.<br/>
<br/>
For my kids it was a privilege, not an abandonment.  <br/>
<br/>
The ways they could be hurt with me gone are no different from the ways they <br/>
could be hurt with me in the back yard, or back in my room,  or in the <br/>
shower, or asleep.<br/>
