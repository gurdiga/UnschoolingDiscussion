&lt;&lt; And - by the way - some people feel attacked and picked apart when people <br/>
 respond to their posts point-by-point, quoting bits and responding, like I <br/>
 have done here &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I used to. <br/>
It felt like everything I said was being dissected, even when I didn&#39;t mean <br/>
it a certain way.<br/>
But you know what?<br/>
It made me really think about what I was posting, what I was saying and <br/>
thinking and whether or not it was really true or what I was trying  to <br/>
convey.<br/>
Many things used to pop out of my mouth (or hands in this case) without much <br/>
thought.<br/>
No longer.<br/>
I&#39;m glad so many people took the time to put the mirror in front of my face <br/>
and force me to really think about what I was saying/writing.<br/>
It&#39;s helped my entire life.<br/>
But I do understand why it&#39;s hard to take at first....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-329547924">**If we say &quot;breastfeeding is good,&quot; someone breaks down in tears and<br/>
says we<br/>
shouldn&#39;t make her feel guilty because she bottle fed.  Often the hurt<br/>
is in<br/>
the reader, waiting to be touched, after which she says &quot;YOU WERE<br/>
INSENSITIVE!  You talked about cats when my cat died, you talked about<br/>
hot<br/>
dogs when I&#39;m a vegetarian, you said unschooling is best when you start<br/>
early, and my child is thirTEEEEEEN!!!!&quot;**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wow -- you really hit the nail of human nature on the head with this<br/>
one.  It&#39;s very true.<br/>
<br/>
(In my sentence above, hitting means achieving clarity -- not beating<br/>
someone w. an actual hammer.  I don&#39;t want what I&#39;ve said to be<br/>
misunderstood.  Always a danger w. figurative language.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Those are the two ends of the spectrum. Most of us are in between, of course, <br/>
but I think what Sandra is saying is that some people really don&#39;t want ANY <br/>
posts at the &quot;potentially dangerous&quot; end of the spectrum and would be happy <br/>
if all posts were at the chit-chat sweet and always-supportive-of-everything <br/>
end instead. I&#39;m not interested in sweet chitchat. I have other places for <br/>
that, for one thing, and this list has such a powerhouse of people with <br/>
really outside-the-box ideas that I want to hear them straight and undiluted. <br/>
Sometimes what someone says to me makes me catch my breath and it can even <br/>
hurt and pretty often makes me want to jump to my own defense. I&#39;ve learned <br/>
to resist that first impulse (usually) and spend time thinking about WHY I <br/>
care. WHY did it get an internal reaction from me? Why would I care what <br/>
someone on some email list said? Why does it touch me? It HAS to be because <br/>
it is touching something that is in ME --I have to recognize that, because <br/>
otherwise why would I care at all? As much admiration as I have for all of <br/>
you - most of you are not people I know enough about to take what you say too <br/>
seriously JUST because you said it. It is the content of your posts that <br/>
matters - not that you said it. There is an impersonal nature to email list <br/>
discussions when there are hundreds of people on the list -- it is great <br/>
since it means the content is what really counts, not the person who happens <br/>
to say something. So if it gets to me, it is the content and I know that I <br/>
need to examine that content and how it applies to me. I&#39;d way rather have my <br/>
thinking challenged even if it is hard to hear - even if my first reaction is <br/>
&quot;How DARE she talk to me like that?&quot; I&#39;d so much rather have that then people <br/>
just offering me goodhearted, well-meaning supportive comments. I&#39;m not in <br/>
that place where I, personally, have a need for that kind of thing - at least <br/>
not from a relatively impersonal email list. I really need to be stretched <br/>
and challenged and even attacked a little - to grow. Others really NEED <br/>
people to send them hugs and need to be validated that they&#39;re &quot;okay.&quot; I <br/>
don&#39;t know how to reconcile these different needs on one list except to <br/>
expect everyone to be mature enough to put up with (and ignore) the stuff <br/>
that doesn&#39;t appeal or apply to them.<br/>
<br/>
--pamS<br/>
Some of what is said here may challenge you, shock you, disturb you, or seem <br/>
harsh. But remember that people are offering it to be helpful and what feels <br/>
uncomfortable to you might be just what someone else needed to hear.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388313944">i think the truth in most post are exactly what some of us need and that i <br/>
prefer. i would never get a honest no gloves kind of answer anywhere else. <br/>
you ladies are full of wonderful ideas newbies such as myself are looking <br/>
for, PLEASE don&#39;t change a thing. sometimes the truth hurts, but if you <br/>
didn&#39;t want to know you should not have asked.<br/>
                thanks for the honesty!!!!<br/>
