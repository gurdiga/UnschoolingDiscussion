<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347589962">I did acknowledge writing for college, and particular occupations. I&#39;m a writer myself, and my preferred format are essays. But I CHOOSE to write, and so developing my writing was something I wanted to do, and I sought out opportunities to do so; yet HATED as far as writing for school ie: writing on specific topics others wanted me to write about, how they wanted me to write them, etc. I write for one magazine that requests us to write in the AP style. I don&#39;t particularly care for it, but I choose to write for them, so I choose to write as they&#39;d prefer.<br/>
 <br/>
But I&#39;m not going to make her write just because someone else says she hasn&#39;t written enough essays or reports when it&#39;s not vital to her life right now. It may never be important to her. If it is, I&#39;ll do my best to help her develop her writing skills. <br/>

~~~<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but I hardly ever wrote anything in high school if I could get away <br/>
with it.   I didn&#39;t go to college.  I started writing when I had something I <br/>
wanted to say, like a letter to the editor, after I became an adult and out on my <br/>
own.  Now, my writing is not stellar; I don&#39;t consider myself &quot;a writer&quot;, but <br/>
I can get my point across.  People love my letters.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think being forced to do it in high school necessarily prepares one <br/>
for writing in later life.  You probably learned how to do it well in high <br/>
school because you enjoyed it.  <br/>

age 16 because of their music program. She was a talented pianist, now an <br/>
opera singer. She had to take an English placement test, which was to <br/>
include writing an essay. She had never written anything but letters and <br/>
journal entries. She got a teacher to critique a couple of essays, then <br/>
took the test and got 96%.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036639674">I just wanted to insert my 2 cents here.  As a homeschooling mother of three I decided to attend my local community college to learn computer programming.  The only class I had had any difficulty in was my college English class, I had no idea how to write an essay and I attended public school.  It might be helpful to her to at least a week or two just learning what an essay requires just in case she does decide to go to college, even the people learning automotive repair here have to take one English essay writing class.  It is up to you of course but I sure wish someone would have just spent a week when I was younger explaining how to write an essay.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe.  <br/>
I wrote a lot too, in school, but I was good at it from early ages, so the <br/>
doing-for-years didn&#39;t make me better, it was just doing something I could do <br/>
without much effort and for great school-reward.<br/>
<br/>
Holly reads better than some other kids her age.  A year and some ago she <br/>
couldn&#39;t read.<br/>
Those who read as well as she does could say &quot;that reading I&#39;ve done for the <br/>
past five years prepared me to read as well as I do now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t press a child to write.  Let them write.<br/>
I would help them find opportunities ift hey showed inclination, interest or <br/>
need.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby said he was worried about the essay required for the GED.  Three <br/>
paragraph essay.  I told him what they meant by &quot;three paragraph essay&quot; and told him <br/>
which of his writing experiences had been the most essay-like, and looked up <br/>
a couple of previous GED topics.<br/>
<br/>
Writing has lots of elements.   Anything involving conversation, <br/>
storytelling, explanations, logic problems, organization, discussions, analysis, <br/>
comparison (of two movies, musical styles, houses, hairstyles) will help kids write <br/>
more easily when they find the need or urge to write.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-334207289">Schools scare people about &quot;essays.&quot;<br/>
They turn simple writing to  yucky canned spinach.<br/>
<br/>
The general term for writing which isn&#39;t fiction or poetry is &quot;expository <br/>
writing.&quot;<br/>
It means you&#39;re telling people something.  Letters, business writing, <br/>
technical writing, essays...<br/>
<br/>
So an essay can be personal.  It&#39;s not a report in the same way an accountant <br/>
reports or a doctor reports after a procedure.   It can be funny, sad, <br/>
tricky, light, intense, and the author can say &quot;I think...&quot; and &quot;It seems to me..&quot; <br/>
and that kind of writing is some of the easiest to read and care about, for me <br/>
anyway.<br/>

Kirby wants his computer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-896557143">I just checked the book &quot;Is this your child?&quot; out of the library, and I&#39;m <br/>
getting ready to put ds on an elimination diet. He&#39;s 3.5 and has been <br/>
difficult since before he was born. He has a total Jekyll/ Hyde <br/>
personality, and I am never able to predict what is going to set it off, <br/>
know what I mean? He screams, hits, kicks, gets totally out of control as <br/>
if there is nothing he can do to stop himself. I can see the fear behind <br/>
his eyes when he does this, and it&#39;s awful! Then he&#39;s the sweetest little <br/>
boy, completely able to work through a frustrating situation, use his nice <br/>
words, negotiate, etc. I&#39;m at my wits end!<br/>
<br/>
I have been mentioning his extreme behavior to my pediatrician, who has <br/>
pooh-poohed the whole food allergy/ behavior connection for a year now. <br/>
SIGH So, I have decided to go it on my own because I just feel that it&#39;s <br/>
really worth giving it a shot.<br/>
<br/>
I have been noticing how red-rimmed his ears get for months now, and his <br/>
cheeks get the bright red, chapped patches, too. I&#39;m going to begin with <br/>
dairy. Going back in my head, the behavioral episodes, which are better and <br/>
worse at times, all seem to coincide with lots of bagels and cream cheese. <br/>
I know it could be wheat too, and I guess I will try that next. But, he&#39;s <br/>
gotten to the point where he&#39;ll just eat the cream cheese off the bagel and <br/>
leave the bagel itself. So, that makes me suspect that it&#39;s the dairy and <br/>
not the wheat.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, this is getting long, but I was hoping you guys might have <br/>
some words of wisdom, recipe tips, hints of things to look for, moral <br/>
support, etc. that you might be able to share as I begin this journey.<br/>
<br/>
I am just so hoping that this will be the answer, you know? I just can&#39;t <br/>
bear the thought that this is something inside my son. SIGH  It just seems <br/>
so much more than the terrible twos or threes that the doctor keeps telling <br/>
me it is.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading this far!<br/>

Why is Kirby taking the GED?<br/>
<br/>
At Thanksgiving I was blindsided by my sil, who said her 18 yo son can&#39;t get <br/>
a job because no one&#39;s accepting homeschool diplomas in their town.  Her <br/>
daughter, who got pregnant at 17 and went to homeschooling in her last year of high <br/>
school, lost her job at Manpower because they wouldn&#39;t accept a homeschool <br/>
diploma.  (She has 2 years of college, btw.)  I understand the prejudice, but <br/>
I&#39;m thinking my 19 yo son should probably get a GED just in case.<br/>
<br/>
Curious why Kirby is doing it?<br/>

&lt;&lt; Why is Kirby taking the GED? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because two of his homeschooled friends did and they&#39;re trying to talk him <br/>
into it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
He might not, but he talked about it for a while and looked some stuff up, <br/>
and that&#39;s the only part that was scaring him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;lost her job at Manpower because they wouldn&#39;t accept a homeschool <br/>

<br/>
In a case like that it would be WELL worth doing.  Bummer, about that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Curious why Kirby is doing it?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a maybe not an &quot;is,&quot; but after years of not having him tested and not <br/>
wanting others to even play-test him, I came up all bubbly with pressing him to <br/>
take it with no preparation at all--just go take it cold.<br/>
<br/>
He took a test in driver&#39;s ed and only missed one.<br/>
<br/>
But I was pushy and said &quot;If you take it and pass that will be so cool!!  And <br/>
if you fail, big deal--then you can study the parts you didn&#39;t do well on.&quot;   <br/>
He was inclined to get a test book.  Some people pay real money for <br/>
preparation courses.   The kids said there are cheap-to-free prep classes in town.  But <br/>
if he studies, he might think he only passed because he studied.<br/>
<br/>
Then I heard myself and I was embarrassed and I shut up. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

the title throw you, it isn&#39;t a discipline book at<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-965193275">Roxana&#39;s first formal &quot;essay&quot; was for a community college class in the  <br/>
history of opera. She was 14 years old. It was an in-class essay exam.  <br/>
She was worried about it - partly about her bad handwriting and partly  <br/>
that she thought there was some kind of mysterious format for essays  <br/>
that she&#39;d not know about and totally blow it.<br/>
<br/>
I told her she could print (hers is still kind of childish looking  <br/>
printing, but completely legible) and that the teacher would appreciate  <br/>
it!!<br/>
<br/>
For the essay structure, I just told her to include an introductory  <br/>
paragraph where she says the main point and a little foreshadowing of  <br/>
what&#39;s coming in the rest of the essay, then write paragraphs where  <br/>
each has a main point plus backup and discussion about that point, and  <br/>
finish with a conclusion that is clearly based on the main points and  <br/>
sort of ties things back up to the intro.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t want to give her more direction than that - because I AM a  <br/>
college teacher and I hate reading those formulaic essays kids right  <br/>
out of high school often write. BOOOOORING! Rox is a really good writer  <br/>
and LOVES opera and has a lot to say about it. She got A+ on the essay.  <br/>
She also took the college&#39;s English placement exam and qualified for  <br/>
honors English. Totally unschooled kid - never had a writing lesson in  <br/>
her life. She writes fan fiction a lot. She plays online role playing  <br/>
games and writes detailed character descriptions. She writes on her  <br/>
Live Journal and she emails and chats with friends online. She reads a  <br/>
LOT and also does a lot of acting.<br/>

&gt; to help you before taking the course?  There are<br/>
&gt; websites in how to write an essay (Guide to Writing a<br/>
&gt; Basic Essay<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://members.tripod.com/~lklivingston/essay/">http://members.tripod.com/~lklivingston/essay/</a> ) which<br/>
&gt; a kid could use if they found they needed it or wanted<br/>
&gt; to learn, and it wouldn&#39;t even take a whole week, just<br/>
&gt; an afternoon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260897760">Tell him this, too, just for the test. They don&#39;t get scored on how  <br/>
brilliant and clever and intelligent they are - they are scored based  <br/>
on a &quot;take-away&quot; system - you start with a certain number of points and  <br/>
they subtract for spelling errors, grammatical errors, misused words,  <br/>
etc. So - write with caution - no bonus for big words or subtle ideas -  <br/>
write simple, not complex, sentences. If you aren&#39;t sure how to spell a  <br/>
word, use a different word. If you&#39;re not sure if you need a comma -  <br/>
change the sentence so you don&#39;t NEED a comma. And don&#39;t be creative -  <br/>
just go with mundane answers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Last  month I attended a lecture by Dr. Doris Rapp, the author of the above <br/>
mentioned book.  She gave a fantastic talk. She has also written other books, <br/>
notably Is This Your Child&#39;s World  and Our Toxic World, which are about how <br/>
chemicals and environmental factors are hurting kids and adults. She is an MD <br/>
who is Board Certified in Pediatrics, Pediatric Allergy and Environmental <br/>
Medicine and is also a homeopath.  She as a website, &lt;A HREF=&quot;www.drrapp.com&quot;&gt;www.drrapp.com&lt;/A&gt;, which has lots <br/>
of info. Your son might be reacting to environmental stressors. At her website <br/>
is a link called &quot;watch a video now&quot; which she also showed at the lecture. <br/>
It&#39;s pretty fascinating stuff.<br/>
<br/>
At the lecture she handed out cards with her email address and phone numbers. <br/>
Email me offlist if you&#39;re interested and I&#39;ll send them to you.<br/>

This is how I learned to write a cover letter for my resume.  First <br/>
paragraph, tell them what you want and where you heard about it, <br/>
second paragraph tell them what you can do, third paragraph tell them <br/>
again what you want and also how they can reach you.  A simple <br/>
formula that always got me an interview. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999524245"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have been mentioning his extreme behavior to my pediatrician, who has <br/>
&gt; pooh-poohed the whole food allergy/ behavior connection for a year now. <br/>
&gt; SIGH So, I have decided to go it on my own because I just feel that it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; really worth giving it a shot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our pediatrician actually inadvertently pointed me in the direction of <br/>
Fiengold because he kept mentioning my son&#39;s chemical sensitivity.  Poor Nathan has <br/>
trouble with sunscreens, bug sprays, most soaps and shampoos, cleaning <br/>
products IN ADDITION to food.  Peanuts and highly processed corn are his main <br/>
allergies.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been following Feingold for a while, adapting it to fit our needs.  We <br/>
dont&#39; see the sensitivity to preservatives as much as to coloring and <br/>
flavoring.  Anything artificial in those directions makes him a bit, well, crazed.  We <br/>
do eat processed foods sometimes and deal with the consequences.  He&#39;s five <br/>
now and understands how it makes him feel inside, but will want a lollipop <br/>
occasionally.  I will say, though, that some of the perceived behavioral issues <br/>
come from him being the age he is.  What has been helped with the awareness of <br/>
his sensitivities is the &quot;over the top&quot; reactions to situations.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d do an elimination diet and keep a diary if you suspect some traditional <br/>
dairy, wheat kinds of allergies.  From what I&#39;ve read, most of the behavioral <br/>
reactions come from artificial ingredients.  But you were describing some <br/>
physical reactions as well, so you  might have the double whammy combo that we <br/>
have.  It&#39;s not that hard to work around once you know what foods cause a problem. <br/>
 Our household tries to be free of peanuts, tree nuts, corn syrup, corn <br/>
starch, artificial food coloring and flavoring, celery (that&#39;s mine) and perfumed <br/>
or scented products.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth a shot.  Pediatricians seem to have a hard time believing parents <br/>
when there is something not quite right.  I took my four year old daughter in <br/>
on Friday, convinced she had a bladder infection.  The nurses and probably <br/>
even the doctor were rolling their eyes thinking I was just another mom who <br/>
couldn&#39;t believe her little angel would have wetting accidents.  Turns out I was <br/>
right, after insisting on providing a sample.  Not that it&#39;s a good thing for <br/>
her to have an infection, it is pretty rare in little kids and there might be an <br/>
anatomical reason for it.  <br/>
<br/>
Rambling.  Sorry.  It&#39;s the pregnancy.<br/>
