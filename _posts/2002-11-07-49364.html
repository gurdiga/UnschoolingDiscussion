 </span></blockquote>The article annoyed me, but my kids were thrilled to see her on the cover.  I <br/>
recently read &quot;The Other Parent&quot;, also about the harm of media on children.  <br/>
While I&#39;m not convinced about the argument and tend to let the kids decide <br/>
what to watch when, I found the book interesting.  Newsweek seemed to focus <br/>
more on whether or not tv can be educational.  The Other Parent spoke to the <br/>
violence, sexuality and commercialism of media.  I can&#39;t remember the stats <br/>
on how much the average kid watches, but if you couple that with mind numbing <br/>
school for however many hours I day, I can see why it would be too much.  :)  <br/>
I&#39;d recommend the book for another view if you have the time to read it - got <br/>
mine from the library.<br/>
