<div id="ygrps-yiv-902225415">We attended a co-op preschool partially sponsored by the child<br/>
development program at a local vocational school.  A woman from the voc<br/>
school was always there, and three parents  stayed each class (we<br/>
rotated).  Parents were always allowed to stay, even if it wasn&#39;t their<br/>
turn.  One parent was assigned to each of the three rooms: large motor<br/>
skills and reading corner; art and science; dress-up and blocks/puzzles. <br/>
We had circle time at the beginning for about 10 minutes.  Then the<br/>
children were allowed to spend their time however they wished.  No child<br/>
was ever forced to do anything (except circle and snack).  For instance,<br/>
a child might do nothing but play with blocks week after week.  Then we<br/>
had a snack and final circle time.<br/>
<br/>
So I liked the fact that parents were always welcome and for the bulk of<br/>
the class the kids got to choose what to do.  There were a few moms who<br/>
came every week, and a few who couldn&#39;t wait until their turn to drop off<br/>
and leave.  The kids varied in this way too.  Some were very clingy and<br/>
others ignored their mom the minute they entered the class.<br/>
<br/>
During this year I had my second child and we moved to a different town. <br/>
I did not do any preschool the following year because it didn&#39;t make<br/>
sense to hire a babysitter for the younger child in order to participate<br/>
in a co-op with the first child.  And the first child was NOT interested<br/>
in being dropped off somewhere without me.<br/>
<br/>
Are preschool/unschool compatible?  I think it depends on your situation.<br/>
 It may not be much different from any other &quot;class&quot; an unschooling child<br/>
might take.  If I&#39;d had only one child, I may have continued in the co-op<br/>
experience, as long as it was serving our needs.  Preschool is certainly<br/>
not necessary!  Young children can learn everything they need hanging out<br/>
at home just as well as at a preschool.<br/>
<br/>
There are some homeschoolers around here who do various co-op activities<br/>
with their older children too.  A book called &quot;Playful Learning&quot; tells<br/>
you how to set up a co-op preschool and is full of activities that are<br/>
fun and educational.  (of course, we all know that everything is<br/>
educational!)  Some families find that a small co-op (3-5 families)<br/>
rotating in each others homes serves needs as well as a larger more<br/>
formal program.<br/>
<br/>
A side note: our next door neighbor&#39;s youngest child is same age as my<br/>
oldest (they were 3 when we moved here).  I asked her one day if her<br/>
daughter would be going to preschool next year.  She said &quot;No, and I am<br/>
tired of people asking me that&quot;.  I told her I was glad to finally meet<br/>
someone else who wasn&#39;t going to preschool, because we weren&#39;t either. <br/>
It was during this time that I was meeting more homeschoolers.  Also, in<br/>
my old town I was doing a lot of parenting things like everyone else bc I<br/>
went with the flow and didn&#39;t really think about options.  Moving to a<br/>
new town gave me the opportunity to find out what I wanted to do with my<br/>
family.  (I&#39;m still learning, of course!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707434221">We stopped going to library storytimes--we can sit at home and read<br/>
interesting books and do projects. when the kids were little we had lots of<br/>
play dates and playgroups. Kids played, moms chatted. it worked for us<br/>

someone teels me what to do)<br/>
