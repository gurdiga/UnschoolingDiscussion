<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117045782">Hello everyone! <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted in a while but wanted to give an &quot;update&quot;. I have<br/>
been following some of the advice given to me and &quot;chilled&quot; out a lot<br/>
about bringing up unschooling to my husband. Something that I am<br/>
slowly realizing is how many of these principles we are living already<br/>
and that my husband is supportive of (ie eating, sleeping arrangements<br/>
and &quot;bedtime&quot; etc.) This has made me realize that I don&#39;t need to<br/>
&quot;discuss&quot; many of these things with him -- we just need to keep on<br/>
living and learning together and if we need to work something in<br/>
particular out, then we can discuss. It is still so helpful to me to<br/>
read about these things though and have ideas in my head for future<br/>
reference.<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to share a blog entry that I just posted (it made me<br/>
think of Sandra and unschooling...) :<br/>

      Joys of staying home<br/>
      I love my life! How often do I think those thoughts... A friend<br/>
was looking of a picture of me and MG (my daughter) when she was about<br/>
9 months old, and she said, &quot;you look so happy!&quot; And I told, I am,<br/>
every day! Every day since she was born... actually since I was pregnant.<br/>
<br/>
      I really consider myself a SAHM, although technically I &quot;work&quot;.<br/>
I watch a little boy who is 1 month older than my daughter full-time.<br/>
His mom calls me his &quot;baby-sitter&quot; although most would call me his<br/>
nanny. (I don&#39;t mind too much, in fact I kind of understand her<br/>
aversion to the word &quot;nanny&quot;.) Anyways, I often think how watching<br/>
this little boy actually helps keep me on track as a mom. Our days are<br/>
really about them and their needs -- although I am getting mine filled<br/>
too. We have play dates, go to playgrounds, the library, music class,<br/>
sing, dance, read books, run, make funny faces, laugh, eat, nap... it<br/>
is quite the good life!<br/>
<br/>
      I have made some really good mommy friends since we moved. And<br/>
talking to them and hanging out with them has clarified a lot of<br/>
things for me. One of my friends works 2 days a week. Yesterday her<br/>
daughter said to her husband and her, &quot;Mommy, Daddy - go back to<br/>
work!&quot; She was having so much fun with her babysitter. My friend<br/>
realized that she has to make her time with her daughter fun too.<br/>
Similarly, one day last week the little boy&#39;s mom came home early and<br/>
I had just gotten him up from nap. As soon as he saw her he gave a<br/>
loud, dismayed, &quot;NO-oo-OOH!&quot; His mom and I both laughed, and she was a<br/>
good sport and said &quot;Yes!&quot; with her arms wide open.<br/>
<br/>
      Aside from the awkwardness I feel about this I also know that I<br/>
personally would not deal well with this at ALL. I LOVE that I am<br/>
still my daughter&#39;s favorite as she approaches 2. She still WANTS to<br/>
be with me all the time! We do so many things together every day -<br/>
eat, play, nurse, bathe, fall asleep... We make each other laugh! I<br/>
know that it will not always be this way, but all the more reason to<br/>
cherish it now. When MG was only 6 months there were people who said,<br/>
&quot;She is still nursing?&quot; and &quot;She (me) is going to be a slave to that<br/>
baby&quot;. Well if this is the kind of life a slave leads then call me a<br/>
slave. I am in love and loving life. My baby (little girl!) is growing<br/>
up quickly and beautifully and I am trying so hard to soak up as many<br/>
moments as I can. I wouldn&#39;t change a thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131362910">Beautiful, <br/>
your post made me weap.<br/>
I also have a little girl whom will turn two in August.<br/>
You describe every bit of feeling she has planted in my life.<br/>
<br/>
I keep chasing her around to hear her toddler<br/>
giggle, which is the best music I have heard.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could say that she always wants to be<br/>
with me but I must say, Julia is equally loving<br/>
her Daddy.<br/>
<br/>
How wonderful and inspiring to read those words of <br/>
dedication to the time you baby sit.<br/>
<br/>
I can see the joy of those children in your care.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It won&#39;t be the same, but it won&#39;t be worse - it is AWESOME to be the  <br/>
mom of teenagers and young adults. I thought it would be heartbreaking  <br/>
- that it was inevitable that they&#39;d go through a period of not  <br/>
wanting parents around, etc. Yesterday I was at water aerobics and  <br/>
someone asked the instructor what she got for mothers day. The  <br/>
instructor said, &quot;Nothing, of course. My daughter is 16 so she hates  <br/>
me right now.&quot; Several of them went on to say, &quot;Oh, yeah, she&#39;ll hate  <br/>
you until she&#39;s 21 and then she&#39;ll suddenly realize (again) how smart  <br/>
you really are.&quot; And so on.<br/>
<br/>
Not at ALL true in my experience. Not even close.<br/>
My girls are 17, 20, and 23. They still want to be with me a LOT.  <br/>
We&#39;re all busy with our separate activities (theater, soccer,  <br/>
community college, karate, Girl Scouts, and my work), too, but we do  <br/>
still spend a lot of time together and they clearly want me around.  <br/>
Yesterday a bunch of kids - all unschoolers/homeschoolers - went to  <br/>
the beach. I spent some time with them - went off to go jogging by  <br/>
myself. But, truly, they would not just tolerate me hanging out with  <br/>
them, they&#39;d LIKE it. So would their friends. When they make plans to  <br/>
do things, go to Disneyland, for example, they are very happy when  <br/>
some of us unschooling moms or dads decide to go along. A bunch of  <br/>
them take karate together and every once in a while they&#39;ll all decide  <br/>
to go out to eat after a class or test. They are very happy for us  <br/>
adults to go along with them. My 23 yo and I go work out at the gym  <br/>
together a couple of times per week. Tomorrow evening I&#39;m going over  <br/>
to her house and we&#39;re going to make Artist Trading Cards - she has a  <br/>
whole &quot;art room&quot; in her little house - her own studio!  Even with her  <br/>
moved out and having a full-time career and a boyfriend and a busy  <br/>
social life, we still see a lot of each other - at least a couple of  <br/>
times a week - sometimes more. We talk on the phone multiple times per  <br/>
day, most days. We also send emails - just interesting little things  <br/>
we find on YouTube, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t sad at ALL. It is very very wonderful to grow into a real  <br/>
mature friendship with our older kids/teens/young adults.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897057218">I do miss tiny hands and nursing babies sometimes, but I love the  <br/>
people my babies grew up to be, too.  I have little-kid photos of  <br/>
them all where I can see them from the computer.<br/>
<br/>
A good thing about having older kids is that I can sleep more, work  <br/>
in the yard more, leave the house for an hour or more (which I did  <br/>
yesterday, all by myself! &lt;g&gt;), and not worry about them.   When I  <br/>
called home yesterday, Holly said they were waiting for me to get  <br/>
back before they left (she and her boyfriend) to feed dogs of a  <br/>
friend who&#39;s in Mexico.  Did they need the car, I asked?  No, she  <br/>
said; she just liked me and wanted to see me before she left.<br/>
<br/>
!<br/>
<br/>
And yesterday we were talking about someone we might see in a few  <br/>
months, and she said she had sent her a Mother&#39;s Day note on  <br/>
MySpace.  Then she looked at me with big eyes and said she hadn&#39;t  <br/>
sent ME one, but she had sent four or five to other moms.  We just  <br/>
laughed.<br/>
<br/>
On Mother&#39;s Day all my kids were extra  nice to me, but they&#39;re nice  <br/>
to me all the time.  Keith and I were out to eat with Marty before he  <br/>
had to go to work, and Kirby called me.  I was all mothered-up before  <br/>
lunch was over.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a peaceful, open fullness to our relationships.  I didn&#39;t  <br/>
expect it, when they were little. I&#39;d never seen it before, but now  <br/>
that I know a lot of unschoolers with older kids, I&#39;ve seen it more  <br/>
and more often.<br/>

I agree and I disagree....<br/>
It IS awesome to be the mother of teens and young adults. Definitely!<br/>
But it&#39;s heartbreaking too.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor moved out last week and I sat in his empty room and cried for a<br/>
bit. I&#39;m really happy for him, don&#39;t get me wrong. But I didn&#39;t<br/>
realize how strange it would feel now that he&#39;s officially moved out.<br/>
He&#39;d been gone frequently so I thought I was ready! <br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s heartbreaking (for me to some degree) to not have him around<br/>
in the same way, yet he is so much fun and yes, he enjoys my company<br/>
and misses us when he&#39;s away. It&#39;s a strange transition because you&#39;re<br/>
so excited for them to have these new experiences but it hit me like a<br/>
rock when I saw that empty room.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When they were little, weren&#39;t there times when you were exhausted,  <br/>
frustrated, overwhelmed, etc?<br/>
<br/>
There are those really hard aspects to all ages. Weaning. Walking into  <br/>
our child&#39;s abandoned bedroom. I still haven&#39;t done ANYTHING to Roya&#39;s  <br/>
bedroom - it is sitting with all its &quot;remains&quot; just as she left it,  <br/>
still. It has been many months since she moved out.<br/>
<br/>
ALL of life, all the stages of life, have their down times, sad times,  <br/>
difficult times, etc. Time has a way of erasing some of those really  <br/>
tough times from our memories - but I do remember sitting in the  <br/>
bathroom with the door shut and crying, thinking I was just TOO  <br/>
exhausted and TOO tired and that if one more person asked me to do  <br/>
something for them in the next five minutes I might just explode.  <br/>
Those toddler years weren&#39;t a steady stream of completely  <br/>
uninterrupted bliss and neither will the teenage years be that.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m addressing is that parents of young children are so often  <br/>
fearful that their own dearly-loved children will turn on them when  <br/>
they become teenagers. THAT isn&#39;t what has happened to the unschoolers  <br/>
I know. What Ren describes above - yes, of course - those transitions  <br/>
can be heartrending. But it has NOTHING to do with our children  <br/>
becoming hostile, difficult, hard-to-get-along-with, parent-snubbing  <br/>
teenagers. AND - those sad feelings are very sweetly mixed with  <br/>
satisfaction at our children&#39;s capabilities and confidence and zest  <br/>
for life, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There are things to learn, together, about our maturing relationships,  <br/>
and I&#39;m not saying that that is always perfectly smooth sailing,  <br/>
either. We have had times that we clashed - but they&#39;ve been a whole  <br/>
lot fewer and farther between  than I&#39;d have anticipated based on the  <br/>
way people talk about teens. And, no MORE often than when they were  <br/>
younger.<br/>
<br/>
Parents worry in advance that they will, inevitably, have to deal with  <br/>
those &quot;teen years&quot; when their kids will be sullen, angry, rebellious,  <br/>
defiant, disrespectful, secretive, hostile, and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
That is not inevitable and is not at all &quot;normal&quot; in unschooled teens.<br/>
<br/>
I was reading an article by a woman who has the nerve to go on and on  <br/>
about how important it is to set limits and not indulge your children  <br/>
and be strict and so on, and it turns out that her OWN young teen&#39;s  <br/>
behavior got so completely out of control that they sent him to a  <br/>
military boarding school. Her conclusion? Even when parents do  <br/>
everything right, some teens will go bad and then parents just have to  <br/>
be strong enough to make the tough choices.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the article:<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.helium.com/items/1010686-teenagers-entirely-different-species">http://www.helium.com/items/1010686-teenagers-entirely-different-species</a> <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It starts out with:<br/>
&quot;Teenagers are an entirely different species than most that inhabit  <br/>
the earth, or so it appears to rational adults.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re going to generalize, I could just as easily describe teens as  <br/>
DELIGHTFUL! Their increasing competence, fresh way of seeing things,  <br/>
idealism, passion, kindness, positive energy, their willingness to  <br/>
take reasonable risks, and their solution-oriented approach to life -  <br/>
they are great!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037181255">Hey - I just read my &quot;Daily Groove&quot; from yesterday and today and it is  <br/>
about Terrible Twos and Teens.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, Scott Noelle says a lot in his very succinct way:<br/>

&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.enjoyparenting.com/daily-groove/terrible-not">http://www.enjoyparenting.com/daily-groove/terrible-not</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
           ****<br/>
The shift from terrible to terrific begins with your commitment to  <br/>
creative partnership. Then, whenever your child exhibits &quot;terrible&quot;  <br/>
behavior, you can re-interpret it as evidence of his or her unfolding  <br/>
autonomy, and ask yourself this:<br/>
&quot;How can I use my creativity to support my child&#39;s growth in a way  <br/>
that works for ALL of us?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Kirby was a little like that, compared to Marty and Holly.  He never  <br/>
quite recovered from moving to a new house.  He didn&#39;t get the room  <br/>
he wanted.  Puberty hit him hard and he was gone a lot, with work and  <br/>
karate.  I see ALL the negatives of some problems Kirby and I had.   <br/>
Then I pull out the too-close focus and remember that my relationship  <br/>
with Kirby was better than ANY of our friends whose kids his age were  <br/>
in school.  WAY better.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby knew he was going to move, last summer, a kind of  <br/>
compensatory niceness came over him.  It seemed as though he had been  <br/>
planning to be nicer later, and his later was disappearing.  It was  <br/>
all sunshine and roses from the time he knew he was getting a job in  <br/>
Texas.  He calls me a couple of times a week just to see how I am.  I  <br/>
forget to call him in the two very small windows in his day.  He&#39;s  <br/>
awake for an hour before he gets to work, they&#39;re all like black-out  <br/>
at work (no phones, no e-mail), he takes one break outside the  <br/>
building to eat and do errands, and gets home usually after I&#39;m in  <br/>
bed.  He works ten hours lots of times, and currently is working  <br/>
eight days straight because they changed his two days off to  <br/>
Wednesday and Thursday.<br/>
<br/>
So I know where he is, and I&#39;m glad to know what his apartment is  <br/>
like now, and he tells me stories and is really sweet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
His room did change.  The closet and half the shelves still have his  <br/>
stuff where he left it but we moved the desk  (door on two bases with  <br/>
drawers) and that room is the games room now, kind of a den for  <br/>
upstairs.  It has Rock Band (which Kirby sent us for Christmas) and  <br/>
XBox, TV, Marty&#39;s computer, and extra chairs.  Holly dibbsed the  <br/>
bathroom Kirby had.<br/>
<br/>

He did leave a hole, but he&#39;s not gone far.  He&#39;s not gone with  <br/>
hostility.  He didn&#39;t run away or leave early.  He was twenty.  We  <br/>
didn&#39;t shove him out or make him go to college or pay rent or any of  <br/>
that.  It was gentle and peaceful.<br/>

&gt; I agree and I disagree....<br/>
&gt; It IS awesome to be the mother of teens and young adults. Definitely!<br/>
&gt; But it&#39;s heartbreaking too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is one of the things that I love hearing about from experienced<br/>
unschoolers, that our relationships with our kids can grow and<br/>
continue to be GOOD at the same time. When I said that I know that it<br/>
(my relationship with my daughter) will not always be this way, I<br/>
meant that I know she will continue to grow more independent and not<br/>
need me as much as she does now in the way that a baby and small child<br/>
does. I&#39;m trying to really live in the moment and cherish it instead<br/>
of resent it, and I have been pretty successful for the most part. <br/>
<br/>
I never went through a rebellious period. I have ALWAYS been very<br/>
close with my mother, we really couldn&#39;t get much closer. Ironically,<br/>
she is a teacher -- I had her for math 2 years in high school! People<br/>
always think that that must have been awful, or terribly difficult,<br/>
but it wasn&#39;t, it was great. So I really believe all of these accounts<br/>
of parents with great relationships with their teens, and it I aspire<br/>
to keeping my relationship with my daughter healthy through all of her<br/>
&quot;ages&quot;.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463488675">Trevor moved out last week and I sat in his empty room and cried for a<br/>
bit. I&#39;m really happy for him, don&#39;t get me wrong. But I didn&#39;t<br/>
realize how strange it would feel now that he&#39;s officially moved out.<br/>
He&#39;d been gone frequently so I thought I was ready!<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
It was downright surreal when Will left home.  I left his room just <br/>
the way he&#39;d left it for almost a year, then we moved Dan&#39;s stuff in <br/>
there when his toys outgrew the playroom.  Will was back for a few <br/>
months in 05 when he came back to New Mexico, but has been in his own <br/>
place for more than 2 yrs now.  <br/>
<br/>
Since Gary took an over the road job, and is only home every 3rd day, <br/>
Will&#39;s been here at least two days (and nights) a week.  He comes <br/>
over, brings his laundry, and hangs out with us.  Yes, he spends a <br/>
lot of that time online, but he will just hang out and play with the <br/>
boys, have dinner with me, and stay with the boys so I can run <br/>
errands or walk the dog (Andy&#39;s not crazy about dog walks).  It&#39;s <br/>
really nice to have him around as an adult -- even nicer since there <br/>
were some really rocky years with him.  He&#39;s not an always unschooled <br/>
kid. He is the one who brought us into homeschooling, and later <br/>
unschooling. He is the child of my single parent years (9 total) and <br/>
as a firstborn, he carries the weight of my learning years.  He&#39;s a <br/>
3rd generation firstborn, so we have what we call the &#39;prototype <br/>
experience&#39; in common.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really wonderful to have a grown child.  We text back and forth <br/>
about all kinds of things.  When we added him to our cell phone plan, <br/>
he insisted on having messaging, so he pays for it. I told him we&#39;d <br/>
never use it, so he texts us, mostly to bring us into the 21st <br/>
century I think. <br/>
<br/>
I can say even when you find unschooling late, it still increases the <br/>
joy of being Mom to an older child.  <br/>

On  Mother&#39;s Day all my kids were extra nice to me, but they&#39;re nice <br/>
to me all  the time. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wyl, 9, has been extra nice and very thoughtful, lately. <br/>
 <br/>
Yesterday, he asked Dave to help him make breakfast for me (scrambled eggs,  <br/>
toast, bacon and orange juice) which he joyfully brought me when I came  <br/>
downstairs. <br/>
 <br/>
Recently, he willingly and happily jumped in to help me when Dave was out  of <br/>
town and I was collecting trash to take down to the curb on garbage day,  <br/>
playfully cleaning out from under the little table he and his brother eat, play,  <br/>
watch t.v., etc. at (it tends to collect wrappers, cups, etc., since I can&#39;t <br/>
see  under it unless I bend over quite far and specifically look). <br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s been very loving and huggy the last week or so. <br/>
 <br/>
Today, after Storm was asleep, I turned to see if he looked comfortable and  <br/>
sound asleep before I called down to let Dave and Wyl know Storm was out and  <br/>
noticed he had moved over to the other (Wyl&#39;s usual sleeping space) bed <br/>
(pushed  up next to ours). I made sure they knew that so Wyl could be careful <br/>
getting  into bed and not squish or hurt Storm. When he got done brushing his teeth, <br/>
he  came in (Dave had come in to see if I wanted him to move Storm) and asked <br/>
if he  could take a &quot;really quick&quot; bath. Dave went in to take him underwear <br/>
and help  him run water and when he came back in, he said that Wyl had wanted <br/>
to take a  bath so he would be nice and clean when he lay down beside me. Aww, <br/>
how  sweet!<br/>
 <br/>
Funny how things start to happen when you quit looking for them to or  <br/>
wondering where the heck they are... <br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

Ah yes, Trevor too. He remembers all the mainstream crap we slowly<br/>
moved away from. There is still some distance between he and Bleu<br/>
because of it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d have to go look at where it&#39;s written down, but I believe he&#39;s a<br/>
sixth generation firstborn. The first boy in that six generations! I<br/>
was also a first granchild six generations back and a first great<br/>
granchild that far back. Weird. I feel like I have to be the bulwark<br/>
against all that family control and intensity many of us experienced.<br/>
The women on both sides are fierce creatures.:)<br/>
<br/>
It hit me that even if Trevor comes back to live with us, it&#39;s as an<br/>
adult living on his own and it felt so different somehow. We talked<br/>
last night, he said &quot;I really miss you guys&quot; and I know he does. He&#39;s<br/>
always my firstborn and I&#39;m confident we will always be close, but<br/>
things are transitioning and it&#39;s a lot to take in as a mother.<br/>

<br/>
Any more stories to add there?  I&#39;ll mine what&#39;s already in that  <br/>
topic later on.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday afternoon after I had written here I was going out into the  <br/>
yard to work a long muddy job.  I had taken money and cards out of my  <br/>
pocket because I was going to get messy, and Keith asked if I had my  <br/>
phone.  I said yeah, it&#39;s pretty waterproof when it&#39;s closed.  (I  <br/>
wasn&#39;t going to get soaked, just mud-spattered.)<br/>
<br/>
Two steps away from the porch, Kirby called.  It wasn&#39;t his lunchtime  <br/>
at all.   He said they&#39;d had a fire alarm evacuation and the fire  <br/>
truck showed up in four minutes, but before they were even all at the  <br/>
parking lot they&#39;re supposed to walk to in case of fire, they were  <br/>
called back in.<br/>
<br/>
I asked if he&#39;d smelled smoke, and he said no, but before the alarm  <br/>
went off he had heard a big, odd noise like a fire extinguisher.<br/>
<br/>
Even then, I figured he had just called to chat because they were up  <br/>
and disrupted anyway.  But it was better than that.<br/>
<br/>
He had told his group not to say &quot;fire&quot; if they needed to leave an IM  <br/>
or a phone conversation, just to say they&#39;d be back.  Others, though,  <br/>
had communicated to their clients that the building was on fire. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Being that they only work with tech-connected people in all  <br/>
directions, he was afraid word would get out that there was a fire at  <br/>
Blizzard&#39;s Austin facility, and that I would be worried.   Good  <br/>
thinking on his part!!  I was going to be out in the mud and not at  <br/>
the computer, but wasn&#39;t that thoughtful of him to call me?    Maybe  <br/>
three minutes later, Holly called me.  She&#39;s housesitting, and was  <br/>
letting me know she was going to see Sex in the City with two older  <br/>
female friends.  She&#39;s not old enough to see an R rated movie without  <br/>
me, but she knows where to go and how to act to slip in.  Some  <br/>
theaters check and others don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
So I was able to tell her to tell Brett (her very-World-of-Warcraft- <br/>
playing boyfriend) that if he heard anything about a fire, it was  <br/>
very minor if at all, and Kirby was fine.<br/>
<br/>
Very efficient, and all in all another good example of the  <br/>
relationships in my family (Kirby&#39;s 21 and Holly&#39;s 16).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My oldest moved out on the 1st of the year. Even though it was on good <br/>
terms, it was too soon. He was only 16, 17 now. I took it hard. I <br/>
cried every night for a long time. I would sit in his empty room and <br/>
smell him still in there. I&#39;m just now getting to a point where I <br/>
don&#39;t get really depressed right after seeing him. I still get myself <br/>
worked up sometimes, though. <br/>
<br/>
He would send me messages on Myspace until he lost his internet <br/>
connections. He calls me every few days just to check in. The other <br/>
night he called while watching Deadliest Catch just to chat. It&#39;s all <br/>
very surreal to me. I don&#39;t feel old enough to have a child who is <br/>
practically grown and out of the house. It doesn&#39;t seem like he&#39;s <br/>
really moved out. I&#39;m waiting for him to come back.<br/>

Holly will be 17 in November.  She has a serious boyfriend now,  <br/>
older; older than Kirby.  He&#39;s a friend of Kirby&#39;s and Marty&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Usually they&#39;re both here, if they&#39;re together, but there have been a  <br/>
couple of times they were elsewhere.  That seems too soon, though  <br/>
it&#39;s on good terms, and she still lives here.  But it&#39;s like a crack  <br/>
in the surface of a door and I see the light, and I feel the mom  <br/>
pangs.  I still remember what she smelled like as a baby, and what it  <br/>
felt like to hold her on my hip, but the memories are dimming.<br/>

<br/>
I doubt very much whether the author did do &quot;everything right&quot;. More<br/>
likely, what she means (this is a female Robin, I&#39;m assuming) is that<br/>
she did everything according to the conventional &#39;rules of parenting&#39;.<br/>
Which, in my experience, have a habit of creating three problems for<br/>
every one they allegedly solve.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reminded of an article I was reading myself recently (can&#39;t find<br/>
it now) by a professional &#39;parenting coach&#39; who took pretty much the<br/>
same (totally wrong imnsho) attitude to the nature of children. She<br/>
was writing about the inevitability of losing our tempers with our<br/>
children and screaming and shouting at them and how parents can deal<br/>
with the consequences of that supposedly normal parenting experience.<br/>
Without feeling guilty, naturally.<br/>
<br/>
In my two decades plus of parenting experience, screaming and shouting<br/>
at my children has simply never happened, neither from me nor from my<br/>
wife. At worst, I occasionally raised my voice a notch or two to my<br/>
son during his second year at school - maybe a dozen times in all -<br/>
when his unhappiness with that situation ultimately started to express<br/>
itself in disruptive behaviour. Easily resolved by getting him out of<br/>
the situation. <br/>
<br/>
Which doesn&#39;t mean I could be a better parenting coach. I don&#39;t do<br/>
&#39;child management&#39; and that seems to be what most parents want. Very<br/>
sad, though, to see misinformation being passed on.<br/>
