Last night I was watching MTV2 and they had a piece on with Hugh Hefner. Not a favorite of mine but they had him taking them on a tour of his home. Not just the famous grotto but the whole property. And the whole time I was thinking how much fun my family would have in a house like that!! Of course not the kind of fun he&#39;s having but definitely an unschooling friendly house!!!!<br/>
