If  you&#39;re a bear, you get to hibernate. <br/>
You do nothing but sleep for six months. <br/>
<br/>
I could deal with that. <br/>
 <br/>
Before you hibernate, you&#39;re supposed to eat yourself <br/>
stupid. <br/>
<br/>
I could deal with that, too. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re a bear, you birth your children (who are the size <br/>
of walnuts) while you&#39;re sleeping and wake to partially <br/>
grown, cute cuddly cubs. <br/>
 <br/>
I could definitely deal with that. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re a mama bear, everyone knows you mean business. <br/>
You swat anyone who bothers your cubs. If your cubs get <br/>
out of line, you swat them too. <br/>
<br/>
I could deal with that. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re a bear, your mate EXPECTS you to wake up <br/>
growling. He EXPECTS that you will have hairy legs and <br/>
excess body fat. <br/>
 <br/>
Yup..... I wanna be a bear. <br/>
