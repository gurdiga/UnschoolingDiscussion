<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;OK, I&#39;ll add my .02 cents, since this discussion seems to be getting hot.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While I am very supportive of mothers having careers and being able to work<br/>
if they choose, I feel the same as the above statements.  Financial needs<br/>
are a percieved reason for both parents working.  It is not a necessity.<br/>
Folks in this country are so brainwashed by the media and the consumer<br/>
culture that they think they &quot;need&quot; much more than they really do.  It is a<br/>
lifestyle &quot;choice&quot; which many claim to be unable to change.  &lt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always considered myself to be a fairly liberal thinker and supportive<br/>
of choices, however when I was pregnant with my 3rd child, 11 years after my<br/>
2nd child and at the ripe old age of 39 and people were saying to me &quot;I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have it.  You have choices you know!&quot;  and &quot;You better have an<br/>
Amnio and make sure it is perfect.  You don&#39;t have to have it, you know!&quot; -<br/>
Well, that&#39;s when I realized that I believe people should have choices, but<br/>
I really don&#39;t like some of the choices they make or would make!<br/>
That &quot;IT&quot; they were talking about was my baby.<br/>
<br/>
So now, when people talk about what they &quot;need&quot; and I know it&#39;s really what<br/>
they &quot;want&quot; it&#39;s so hard for me to stay quiet about their &quot;choices&quot;.  I&#39;ll<br/>
probably become one of those really outspoken Old Ladies some day and really<br/>
give people a piece of my mind, whether they want to hear it or not!</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nanci, I totally agree with you.  I remember once in the store when I was <br/>
small, my mom said &quot;Need is something you have to have or you will die.  Want <br/>
is something entirely else&quot;.  That has stuck in my brain since then, and i <br/>
think its a valuable lesson.  You and I can play bridge in the old folks <br/>
home!~<br/>
