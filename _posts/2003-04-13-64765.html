<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077435555">Late this past December, I came down w/ a cold. It developed into a cough. a very bad cough.<br/>
One morning I awoke with a horrible pain in my back right side. I thought it was my kidney. Brianna & I were at my doctor&#39;s office 5 minutes before she got there! <br/>
The coughing had caused muscle spasms - severe!!<br/>
I was told to spend no more than 60 - 75 minutes per day out of bed. In bed - I was to stay flat....as in no sitting up. That my friends is hell. There is nothing to do for 23 hours per day flat on your back (well, there is , but I home school :)<br/>
How long can you hold a book up?? <br/>
Even watching TV was hard and very boring!<br/>
If there is a hell - this would definitely be a version!<br/>

  &gt; Hell could be many different things to different people, just like <br/>
  &gt; Heaven could be.<br/>
<br/>
  Was it Plato who said each person has his own version of hell? And George <br/>
  Orwell kind of tweaked it with _1984_.<br/>
<br/>
  I remember when we had the restaurant and an unpleasant, vulgar, unsually <br/>
  drunk, REGULAR guest named Thurmond Brandon. Our head waiter, Jerome, used to <br/>
  say that HIS version of hell was to repeatedly explain the dessert cart to <br/>
  Thurmond Brandon! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
