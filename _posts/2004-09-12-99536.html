Just that little phrase gave me a little push, though.<br/>

Are there any resources for group creating or any suggestions from this group <br/>

Hi Pamela,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to do this right now in Louisiana.  I only knew about 3 families <br/>
in my general area who were unschooling, and wanted to try to build an <br/>
unschooling community.   I set up a Louisiana Unschooling list on yahoo, then sent an <br/>
announcement/invitation out to several local groups letting them know about <br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only been a couple of weeks and there are 27 members!  Not all of them <br/>
are radical unschoolers (in fact only a small handful are), but people are <br/>
coming... and reading...and asking questions. I&#39;m hopefully we&#39;ll convert them - <br/>
LOL.  I&#39;m finding that there are a lot of people who &#39;think&#39; they know what it <br/>
means, but then discover they were totally wrong.  But the ones who stay are <br/>
interested in learning.  I put up lots of links on the homepage, with articles <br/>
by Sandra, Danielle, Anne, etc., so the info is there for them.<br/>
<br/>
I learned how to set up the site by looking at other state unschooling lists <br/>
on yahoo.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Denise<br/>
