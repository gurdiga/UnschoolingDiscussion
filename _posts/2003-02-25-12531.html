<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679976254">Hi All<br/>
<br/>
Even though I&#39;ve only been officially doing this for a short time 1 year<br/>
(then 3 months of sending him to an alternative school) then back to<br/>
unschooling again, this is the list for me.  I have joined other lists<br/>
including unschooling.com and to be honest I&#39;m not interested in reading<br/>
about curriculum or how my youngest has learned colors and numbers with<br/>
worksheets.  I know these things have their place, but not on an unschooling<br/>
list that I&#39;m interested in.  It actually annoys me to be on an unschooling<br/>
list and then hear people talking about how many worksheets they are giving<br/>
their children, at set times of the day.... Maybe it&#39;s just me... I don&#39;t<br/>
care if that&#39;s what other people do, but I didn&#39;t think that was<br/>
unschooling.  I thought unschooling was letting my children learn what they<br/>
want to learn when they want to learn it, with me offering a variety of<br/>
opportunities such as talking (being #1 for us) books, courses, computer<br/>
programs, videos, others with experience in what he&#39;s interested in where I<br/>
have none, internet, life outside the house etc.  Yesterday came to me and<br/>
asked me to write some numbers down for him to add up.  He told me to put 5<br/>
different rows of numbers because he wanted to make sure he could add up<br/>
columns.  I did 1 whole sheet which he insisted I check for being correct<br/>
(that&#39;s first 4 planets in Virgo and his perfectionism!!) and then he was<br/>
off doing something else and didn&#39;t ask about them again.  Last night at<br/>
10pm we were reading a book on the planets (he&#39;s learning astronomy and<br/>
astrology now that he knows the difference) and it probably took us 1/2 hour<br/>
to get through the book because of all the questions he was asking that<br/>
thankfully I could answer.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I&#39;m rambling here....  I think I&#39;d rather be on a list like this<br/>
where I might not have as much experience as some of the other members but I<br/>
can certainly learn a lot which I do by reading the postings of Sandra,<br/>
Nancy K, Karin, Dar, Todd, Tia, Heidi, Peg, just to mention a few.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for writing what you do.<br/>

learning colors and numbers with worksheets. ;-) The list is rough, but it<br/>
*is* unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it was the Yahoo Unschooling list? The one that&#39;s moderated?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197492746">I had to leave a list that was similar. I needed more challenge. More<br/>
unschooling talk and how families walked that talk. I started doubted myself<br/>
and my kids the longer I stayed. I got so sucked into it all being ok and<br/>
that it was unschooling. I had to say my peice when I left. I couldn&#39;t just<br/>
leave without saying that wasn&#39;t unschooling. It brought some good<br/>
discussion. At least until I left. It was fun posting but also exhausting.<br/>
It made me realize just how much I appreciate you all that post on a regular<br/>
bases that *do* talk and walk unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-544538569">I just recently unsubscribed from a list after a there was a huge <br/>
discussion about some geography/history books everyone just loved.  I <br/>
looked it up online and they weren&#39;t real books, they were textbooks, <br/>
and even came in a set with the student edition and teacher&#39;s <br/>
edition!  The last straw for me on that list was when a woman said <br/>
she needed advice because her daughter was getting too involved in <br/>
her geography lessons (from the aforementioned textbooks) and wanted <br/>
to spend all day on geography, while the mom wanted her to &quot;rush <br/>
through&quot; the curriculum in the mornings so she could &quot;spend the <br/>
afternoons unschooling&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We had one for a while on the Canadian homeschooling list.  She had pulled<br/>
her son out and wanted everyone to tell her what curriculum to use and how<br/>
to &quot;get it right&quot;.   We tried to get her to relax a bit, but she was still<br/>
asking for all kinds of hand-holding.  Then she up and quit because she was<br/>
spending too much time on email.  Fair enough.  She&#39;s a single parent<br/>
working from home.  Then a week or two later, she showed up on<br/>
Unschooling_Canada and announced she had decided to unschool.  So she wanted<br/>
to know how to &quot;do it right&quot;.  Sigh.  Several of us responded trying to<br/>
help.  Pretty much the same people as the other list.  She&#39;s been very quiet<br/>
since.<br/>
