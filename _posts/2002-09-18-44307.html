<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856013640">This needs to be taken off-list as it is a state specific problem, but I&#39;ll <br/>
chime in quickly to answer a few concerns. PLEASE all South Carolinians, <br/>
contact me off-list---my email addy, my snailmail addy and my phone number <br/>
follow. I&#39;d be happy you talk to you at length about unschooling and the law <br/>
in SC.<br/>
<br/>
It is NOT illegal to homeschool in SC.<br/>
DSS will NOT take your children away unless they are believed to be in <br/>
imminent danger.<br/>
Homeschooling is NOT imminent danger. &lt;Give me a break!&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The father of my son&#39;s best friend is the spokesman for DSS (and one hell of <br/>
a nice guy). He says that as long as you&#39;re following the law, DSS will not <br/>
bother you. DSS has much bigger fish to fry!<br/>
<br/>
You do NOT need to keep your son in school another day---another <br/>
hour---another MINUTE. Keep him home tomorrow! Tell them he&#39;s visiting a sick <br/>
grandmother. He&#39;s vomiting up blood. He&#39;s out of the country! He&#39;s sick (and <br/>
tired of school)! HE WON&#39;T BE BACK TO THAT DAMNED SCHOOL EVER AGAIN!<br/>
<br/>
Go online and register with an accountability associaltion and you won&#39;t have <br/>
to worry another second!<br/>
<br/>
Do NOT say you&#39;re UNschooling. Nobody knows what that is. Just say you&#39;re <br/>
homeschooling your child. Keep everything to a minimum---only tell them <br/>
what&#39;s necessary---and that is that you&#39;ve registered with an association. <br/>
(You must have a high school diploma or equivalent, &quot;teach&quot; 180 days/year, <br/>
keep a dailyrecord/portfolio/journal, and cover the following subjects: <br/>
reading, writing, &#39;rithmatic, social studies, and science. In high school, <br/>
add literature and composition. And you must be registered with an <br/>
accountability association. We recommend PACESC  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pacesc.com/&quot;">http://www.pacesc.com/&quot;</a>&gt;Click here: pacesc.com&lt;/A&gt;    <br/>
---the most non-invasive of all we&#39;ve researched). <br/>
<br/>
Virginia, you are barking up the wrong tree. You seem to be going with option <br/>
#1. You NEED to be going with option #3---the ONLY option for UNschoolers. <br/>
You NEED to read the law, which is posted at the SOS site, at the PACESC <br/>
site---and at any homeschool site in the state.<br/>
<br/>
Please call me. And you REALLY should come to the conference. We DO have an <br/>
SOS member in Goose Creek (only in SC, y&#39;all! &lt;G&gt;). Jump on the SOS site and <br/>
find her---and one or two others in Charleston. Columbia is not the upstate &lt;<br/>
G&gt;, it&#39;s the midlands-- Now, I just cut your trip in half!!! And I&#39;m sure <br/>
she&#39;ll give you a ride!<br/>
<br/>
I will NOT be home tomorrow---I&#39;m at Spiderwoman&#39;s trying to get the handbook <br/>
ready to go to print, but I&#39;ll home tomorrow evening, and I&#39;d love to talk <br/>
with you!<br/>
<br/>
CALL ME!<br/>
And I apologize to non-South Carolinians---but just in case there&#39;s another <br/>
lurking or who later reads the archives...<br/>
