<br/>
<br/>
&gt; These things are just way too cute to correct, aren&#39;t they?  A friend<br/>
&gt; of mine doesn&#39;t understand why I don&#39;t stop my 6yod from calling the<br/>
&gt; washing machine the &quot;washing ma-cleaner.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I mourn a little when they  begin to pronounce them correctly, it&#39;s a<br/>
signpost along the road leaving childhood.<br/>
<br/>
The first time we went driving to see Christmas lights Jonathan was 2.  We<br/>
engaged in the usual &quot;Ooooo&#39;s and ahhhh&#39;s&quot; and headed for home.  He asked if<br/>
we could go see more &quot;Ooo-ahh&#39;s&quot; which is what they have been called ever<br/>
since in this house.<br/>
<br/>
Last year I suggested we go look at the &quot;Ooo-ahh&#39;s&quot; and he announced with a<br/>
look of disgust, &quot;They are called Christmas lights!&quot;.  *sigh*<br/>

I know exactly what you mean about it being a little sad. When Sierra was<br/>
very small, she called Joseph, Joe Fiss. Then when she got a little older,<br/>
she called him Joe Eff. It was cute and his name stayed that for quite<br/>
awhile. We mourned the Joe Fiss part but it was still cute. Then one day she<br/>
called him Joseph and Tara and I both looked at each other and gave out a<br/>
big loud ohhhh at the same time. It was sad for us!<br/>

She was talking a lot by a year old, and she called him that until 2 or so.<br/>
Man was I bummed when one day she came out with &quot;Mackenzie&quot;. I can still<br/>
remember this tiny imperious one year old saying &quot;You no touch my horsie,<br/>
GEEGAW!&quot;. She had a bunch of cute ones. On her one year old birthday, I<br/>
asked her what she wanted to eat and she yelled &quot;Blue-bahs!&quot; (blueberries).<br/>
I remember she used to call grapes &quot;beeps&quot;. When she was an infant, we took<br/>
her to an italian restaurant and it was decorated with artificial grapevines<br/>
with plastic grapes. She kept screaming &quot;beeps! Beeps! BEEPS!&quot; and reaching<br/>
for them. She just didn&#39;t understand that she couldn&#39;t eat them, she was so<br/>
little and they looked so real.<br/>
<br/>
Mackenzie still has a couple that I will be sad when they go away. He says<br/>
&quot;usually&quot; instead of &quot;especially&quot;. So he&#39;ll say &quot;I&#39;d like to go to the park<br/>
today, usually if my friends are going to be there.&quot; Just this year he<br/>
started saying &quot;hospital&quot; instead of &quot;hostable&quot; and a few others.<br/>

When  Holly was really little, still nursing and thereafter, one of her <br/>
favorite drinks was &quot;daddy juice,&quot; and this particular combo is still, at our <br/>
house, called that.    But when she was a toddler and wanted &quot;daddy juice,&quot; it was <br/>
kind of a gross thought, honestly, if one doesn&#39;t have any idea what she means.<br/>
<br/>
What it is, though, is a combination of Sprite and cranberry juice. <br/>
SoBe later made a commercial one.  So these guys call it &quot;SoBe Daddy-juice.&quot;<br/>

Hmm, maybe your right...Altho a correlation between Russian and Czech <br/>
cultures wouldn&#39;t be unusual would it?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129426759">When Isaac was about 3 he wanted to go next door to swim in my brother&#39;s pool.  It was a rainy day complete with thunder and lightning so I explained how it wouldn&#39;t be safe to go swimming.  He responded that it would be o.k. since Uncle Frank&#39;s pool &quot;has a screensaver&quot;  (screened in)<br/>
<br/>
Another one I remember was when someone asked me what size clothes Isaac wore (for gift purposes)  I said he was in a size 4 to 5.  After that, whenever someone commented on how big he was getting he would say &quot;yeah, cuz I&#39;m fortified&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389486871">When Abbie was born, Jason was eight, and as soon as she could walk, <br/>
big brother played with her, HIS version of play. She learned to <br/>
wrassle long before she ever heard of dolls. And she got to <br/>
be &quot;Webigail&quot; when he and his buds would play Duck Tails. One girl, <br/>
four boys, horsing around between our house and their house.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so, when she was I guess six or seven, something happened where <br/>
she got whacked in the crotch. She grabbed herself, her eyes got <br/>
huge, and she hollered as loud as she could &quot;Oooohhhh! Right in the <br/>
NUTS!&quot; LOL<br/>
