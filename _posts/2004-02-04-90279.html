<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193608851">Hello everyone!  I&#39;ve been lurking for a bit and reading a lot.  I wanted to just pop in and introduce myself and my son.  <br/>
 <br/>
My name is Holly Selden.  I&#39;m a mother of three.  Morgan (8 1/2), Madison (7) and Max (5 1/2).<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll give you a little history...pardon if it gets long.  I can get long winded.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
My husband and I have been together for 10 years.  We are both part of a group called the SCA (Society for Creative Anachronisms).  We met on a 22 mile long gravel road at 2am while both lost and looking for an event in Mississippi.  When I met him, I knew there was something special about him.  It took him a while to finally come out of the proverbial closet and tell me that he was &quot;homeschooled&quot;.  <br/>
 <br/>
Nathan&#39;s mother and father were travelling musicians and when he was in 3rd Grade (and his brother in Kindergarten) Rose pulled them out of school.  She spent a ton of money on a cirriculum/school called American School.  It really didn&#39;t ever get used.  The boys just taught themselves.  In retrospect, they were unschooled....they just didn&#39;t call it that.<br/>
 <br/>
Both my husband and my brother-in-law have always impressed me.  How smart, kind and enjoyable they are to be around.  When we had kids, I kept tossing around the idea of homeschooling, but never felt myself in a position to &quot;pull it off&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
This year was the first year that all three of my kids were in school.  I thought &quot;Whew, I get a break!!!!&quot;....HAHAHAHAH - Not.<br/>
 <br/>
Madison struggled through Kindergarten and wasn&#39;t actually &quot;passed&quot;.  He was placed in a program called &quot;Transitional First&quot; and labeled as &quot;immature&quot;.  When we moved back to my husband&#39;s hometown, they didn&#39;t offer Transitional First and he was subsequently tested and placed in First Grade.  From the beginning his teacher wanted to have him tested for ADHD.  By the second 9 weeks, Madison was carrying straight A&#39;s, had been awarded as the top reader in his class and had an A in conduct.  Still, his teacher complained &quot;He asks too many questions and squirms in his chair&quot;.  <br/>
 <br/>
We went through the testing for ADHD although we stated up front that we would not medicate him.  If his grades weren&#39;t suffering and he was not considered a behavoiral problem, then I refused to drug him into oblivion for the sake of the teacher wanting to be lazy.  The results were in and didn&#39;t even place Madison at borderline ADHD.  Yet, his teacher continued to call me daily saying &quot;Please take him to his pediatrician and have them prescribe something for him&quot;.  <br/>
 <br/>
Madison was starting to show severe signs of stress.  Throwing up almost every day after school, complaining of heartburn, headaches, and overall grumpiness.  I said &quot;That&#39;s it.  I&#39;m done with this.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
I had been putting pressure on him as well.  At some point, I was trying to fit him into their mold just so I didn&#39;t have to get the phone calls anymore.  This led to much arguing and stress between myself and my son and one morning, I woke up and had had enough.  He&#39;s got so much to offer...and I was quelching it.  I was killing his spirit.<br/>
 <br/>
My first instinct was &quot;I cannot take on all three of them at once.&quot;  Although now that Madison is home and leading his own way, I think it would be easier to have them all home.  <br/>
 <br/>
Madison is definately a great candidate for being an unschooler.  He likes to play music and computer games (how my brother in law learned to read) and when he wants to know something, he&#39;ll ask about it...or look it up...or make his own deductions.  <br/>
 <br/>
So here we are.  I was really glad to have found this group and have been learning a lot simply by reading the emails.  <br/>
 <br/>
In the two weeks that Madison has been home, he has blossomed.  He&#39;s happy again.  He smiles all the time and doesn&#39;t throw up anymore.  He&#39;s doing great.  I&#39;m so glad I was able to give him this gift and I really feel like *I* am going to learn a lot from him.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s great to meet you all, and I am sure I&#39;m going to have tons of questions.  Those won&#39;t be as long winded as this, though.  *grin*<br/>
 <br/>
