<div id="ygrps-yiv-971968093">&quot;Riley wants to know about stories where the &quot;bad guy&quot; wins.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
um....the last election? Ok, it&#39;s a joke...I don&#39;t want to start <br/>
anything political here.:)<br/>
<br/>
What about stories that sort of explore human nature without such a <br/>
clear cut between bad and good? I really like stories that show the <br/>
good side of the &quot;bad guys&quot; and the bad side of the &quot;good guys&quot;, <br/>
kinda realistic that way.<br/>
Maybe he&#39;d like some stories that explore those types of themes?<br/>
<br/>
This is a rather adult film...some violence and such that a younger <br/>
child might not be ready for. But &quot;Three Kings&quot; follows some <br/>
soldiers post-Gulf War and how their initial seeking for greedy <br/>
purposes leads them to a higher good and blurs the lines between the <br/>
good and bad guys.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s probably better ones for younger people...I&#39;ll brainstorm.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740642823">Hi,<br/>
One movie series that comes to mind where the &quot;hero&quot; is not a good <br/>
guy are the &quot;Pitch Black&quot; and &quot;Chronicles of Riddick&quot; movie series.  <br/>
(Definitely mature content).  I think Riddick is a game, too.<br/>
<br/>
I googled &quot;bad guy wins&quot; and came up with a lot of lists, etc.  <br/>
There&#39;s a guy on listmania (amazon.com) that lists movies where the <br/>
bad guy wins and I had forgotten a whole bunch of them, so there are <br/>
quite a few out there.  Also, a review of the movie &quot;Hud&quot; with Paul <br/>
Newman (1960&#39;s) states that it is an anti-hero movie and the bad guy <br/>
wins in the end (plus it might be a little easier to watch for a <br/>
younger child than &quot;Seven&quot;, &quot;Fight Club&quot;, or the Hannibal Lecter <br/>
series, depending on your child).  Also, lots of reference to the <br/>
Star Wars movies, new and old, and for reading, reference to Tom <br/>
Clancy novels and a cool book about comic book bad guys by Stan Lee.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Meet John Doe&quot; is a movie where the bad guy has the apparent big victory,<br/>
through controlling all the media in a way no longer possible thanks to the<br/>
internet, but the small personal victory goes to the good guy - plus there<br/>
are lots of changes of heart in the story.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else mentioned the Lemony Snicket series. I would concur that there<br/>
just seems to be no &quot;once and for all&quot; defeat of the Count, at least in the<br/>
early books. I guess the movie is the first three books - they are all quite<br/>
a short easy read.<br/>
<br/>
I have just started reading the Narnia books to Jayn. I will be reading them<br/>
in writing order, not this new notion of calling &quot;The Magician&#39;s Nephew&quot;<br/>
number one. However it occurs to me that that one in particular, the bad<br/>
guy, Empress Jadis, does not lose but is merely delayed. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-828229594">Voldemort is doing pretty well in the Harry Potter series.  &quot;Winning&quot;?  <br/>
Thusfar, five books in, he&#39;s not losing.  And the ratty evil Malfoys seem to be <br/>
doing pretty well for themselves, while poor Harry and Neville are living with <br/>
relatives and without their own parents, not in very good circumstances, not <br/>
with a lot of current hope.<br/>
