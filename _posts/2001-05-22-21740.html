<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064986056">Can a ps high school teenager (ok, well now he is 19) who dropped out at 17<br/>
become a unschooler?<br/>
Would he be able to put this down on his applications for employment?<br/>
He&#39;s my favorite cousin (on my dh&#39;s side of family and he is one out of<br/>
triplets) He had a extremely<br/>
hard life (although a lot of us did). He was actually really supportive as well<br/>
when I told him that I<br/>
am looking forward to unschooling my girls.</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my son was 17 he was &quot;invited&quot; not to return to the expensive <br/>
private high school he&#39;d been going to.  He was always a rebel and <br/>
even though he had attended everyday, he was still getting a zero <br/>
grade average.  I enrolled him his senior year in the ps high school <br/>
that I had attended, almost having anxiety attack just walking in the <br/>
building!  Anyway, his gpa soared to 3.8 and he spent the first month <br/>
teaching the kids in his shop class that 1/2 was a &quot;half&quot; not <br/>
&quot;one-twoith&quot;.  He begged me to let him quit.  At that time I had a <br/>
client who was desperate for bodies.  I let my son quit, but insisted <br/>
that he go to work learning how to pull cables through walls and <br/>
ceilings. He eagerly agreed and eventually decided that he liked the <br/>
income. I filed papers with the state of WI indicating that he was now <br/>
homeschooled and filed again for his 18th year.  During that time he <br/>
bought a car and had to get the license, insurance and registration on <br/>
his own.  He moved out and learned to pay bills and budget his <br/>
paychecks and get his own health insurance. He certainly learned many <br/>
important things. On job applications he states that he was <br/>
homeschooled and we&#39;ve never had to &quot;prove&quot; anything.  He has since <br/>
changed jobs in the same field twice and has bettered himself each <br/>
time.  He&#39;s been on his own for five years with six years of job <br/>
experience!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to your cousin.<br/>
