<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525938232">==some participants seek, for example, advice about their child who found a<br/>
workbook and started filling it out and got stuck ==<br/>
<br/>
There is a disconnect between what people are &quot;seeking&quot; and what they are<br/>
receiving. I have been watching people get upset when they ask a question<br/>
(for example) about workbooks, and get answers that are asking them to<br/>
think deeper, or take a step back and have a bigger perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Over and over again I watch as people react defensively to &quot;think broader&quot;<br/>
or &quot;try for even better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The moderators of lists over and over again ask people to wait and read<br/>
before posting, so that they have some idea of the purpose of the list and<br/>
the tone of the answers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are a few things I want people to think about, based on what I&#39;ve<br/>
seen:<br/>
<br/>
1. Semantics do matter. When all we have are the words we write, it is<br/>
about semantics. I have seen over and over again people say &quot;we&#39;re just<br/>
arguing about semantics.&quot; Well, yes. How we convey ourselves, what words we<br/>
choose - they are all we have in these forums to express what we are<br/>
thinking. If other people are frequently misunderstanding what you meant to<br/>
say, it should be a clue that you are not as articulate a writer as you may<br/>
have thought.<br/>
<br/>
2. Defining the term and proper usage of the word &quot;unschooling&quot; is also<br/>
important, in discussions where you are talking about unschooling. In<br/>
discussions about how to raise poultry, not so much. But other words would<br/>
be important to define. If we have a debate about the best way to build a<br/>
coop and then it turns out I&#39;ve been talking about a garden shed the whole<br/>
time, it matters. I have also been watching as people say &quot;yes, well, I<br/>
hate defining things so I don&#39;t.&quot; When someone comes to a forum where<br/>
unschooling is the topic of discussion and they take issue with defining<br/>
the word itself, they basically say &quot;the entire premise of this forum is<br/>
stupid.&quot; The same goes when someone blithely says &quot;I didn&#39;t like that term<br/>
so I made up blahblahblah instead.&quot; The only way anyone else will know what<br/>
it is they are talking about is if they go on to refine the definition.<br/>
<br/>
3. You&#39;re asking for it. I fully expect after I hit send this post will be<br/>
dissected and things that I &quot;didn&#39;t mean to say&quot; will come forward. Which<br/>
is good - this list is like a mirror to reflect deeper thought. If I plan<br/>
to continue thinking, writing, and talking about unschooling, I welcome<br/>
reactions so I can continue to gauge how I&#39;ve been perceived and how I can<br/>
further clarify turning my thoughts to text.<br/>
<br/>
4. A lot of other people read this. Your post may open a door to an<br/>
important discussion (moderators will know what else may be important to<br/>
other people because they have seen every question a lot of times already)<br/>
which will become bigger than the original topic. So you will have to use<br/>
some critical thinking when you read, and decide which pieces apply to you.<br/>
You also may have to be open to the idea that your question, just by asking<br/>
it, shows that your thinking could be broader. People will catch that, and<br/>
challenge your thinking. If you do not want your words and thoughts to be<br/>
discussed, don&#39;t post.<br/>
<br/>
This is not the first time any of this has been said, but maybe another<br/>
voice saying something in a slightly different way will reach a slightly<br/>
different audience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464426514">I don&#39;t want to make parents feel bad about themselves. I want parents to make decisions that lead them not to have things to feel bad about. Big difference.<br/>
<br/>
I pulled that  (I wrote it in 2010) out to use for Just Add Light and Stir.  I wasn&#39;t looking for that.  I was looking to see whether I had put up a blog post about art modelled on Kirby, my oldest, a few years back (a character in an illustrated story/comic book).  I didn&#39;t find it, so I&#39;ll put it up before the links all die off.   He&#39;s been &quot;cartoonized&quot; again, so I figured I would put them in the same place.  A new collection.<br/>
<br/>
But what I did come across was this:  <br/>

<br/>
It was about someone having posted something cheery on her facebook page (a quote from me) and then came the criticisms.   Then came the defenses.  Someone (I don&#39;t know who, didn&#39;t save the name, it&#39;s nice, but the name doesn&#39;t matter) wrote:  <br/>
<br/>
_______<br/>
I used to dismiss nearly everything Sandra said... I believed if she couldn&#39;t communicate with parents the same way she believed we should communicate with kids, she wasn&#39;t &quot;walking the talk&quot;. As I&#39;ve grown as a parent and unschooler, I see her words so differently now. Where others see (and I *used* to see) harshness and negativity, I see clear, caring communication. I don&#39;t know if I can explain the switch that happened. When I got that she was speaking to me as the mother of my children, NOT the injured child of my mother, that&#39;s when I saw her differently.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I remember when this was said and I have repeated my version of it others<br/>
many times, telling them, &quot;Please listen to Sandra from the point of view<br/>
that she&#39;s assuming you&#39;re a strong adult who prefers clear and blunt<br/>
comments because it is worth it to hear it, even if, at first, you react<br/>
with hurt or anger, because it is for the sake of your children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I also remind people that they can listen to whatever anybody says and then<br/>
walk away completely unchanged if that&#39;s what they want to do. Nothing said<br/>
here ever has the power to force anybody to change.<br/>
<br/>
In one of the very first times I heard Sandra speak in person, she talked<br/>
about &quot;thinking dangerous thoughts.&quot; She told the audience to be brave,<br/>
duct tape themselves to a chair, get someone to spot them, and go ahead and<br/>
think whatever thoughts they might be afraid to think. When they were done,<br/>
they could get up and walk away as if nothing had happened.<br/>
<br/>
I have applied that to all unschooling discussion since then - that was<br/>
almost 20 years ago. I have had my feelings hurt, have had rushes of<br/>
adrenaline and anger and defensiveness. I figuratively sit myself down and<br/>
duct tape myself to a chair and think about why I&#39;m having that reaction -<br/>
why such a strong reaction to something said by someone who can&#39;t do<br/>
ANYTHING to me - can&#39;t make me change anything at all about my life. When I<br/>
think I&#39;ve been completely misunderstood or unfairly characterized I think<br/>
(dangerously) &quot;What if they&#39;re right and that IS what I meant/said/did?&quot;<br/>
 Sometimes it takes me a few days to be clearheaded and calm enough to<br/>
think things through - but I always learn about myself and come out of it<br/>
with more insight and more determination to be the best parent and person I<br/>
can be for my family.<br/>
<br/>
Wish I had a nickel for every time I&#39;ve told someone that I understood that<br/>
this is hard and that they feel insulted and attacked but that IT iS WORTH<br/>
IT!!<br/>
