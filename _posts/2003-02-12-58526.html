&lt;&lt; Where can I find the article to which you refer?  I&#39;m new to homeschooling <br/>
2 &quot;special needs&quot; kids and am having some problems trying to embrace the <br/>
wholehearted unschooling lifestyle espoused here since there does seem to be <br/>
a need for structure that I don&#39;t think is just my need. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I totally forgot to say where the article was published.<br/>
It was in HEM&#39;s (of course) Nov./Dec. issue, I think. I need to go and look <br/>
but all my HEM&#39;s are in the trunk of my car for our &quot;resource day&quot; tomorrow. <br/>
Maybe Sandra or Joyce or someone can help me out with remembering.<br/>
And maybe it&#39;s online somewhere now, ???<br/>
It is such a good article about her personal journey with a special needs <br/>
child and how unschooling answered everything in the end!<br/>
Very heartfelt article.<br/>
And Sandra is in that issue too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-111596095">I don&#39;t know if unschooling works for every child with special needs; <br/>
and I wouldn&#39;t presume to assure a mother that it can or will.  I can <br/>
share my experience with unschooling a child with special needs, <br/>
although I didn&#39;t know that I was doing so until I learned about <br/>
unschooling from another homeschooler.  In fact, to my great <br/>
surprise, I was *accused* of being an unschooler with my youngest <br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
My son is evaluated and considered - by those who do such things by <br/>
training and profession - to be severely disabled.  He was born <br/>
neurologically normal, but he was also born with a genetic disease <br/>
called Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID), also known, <br/>
unfortunately, as the &quot;boy in the bubble&quot; disease.  The disease is <br/>
fatal without a bone marrow transplant, which my son underwent when <br/>
he was 6 months old.  Unfortunately, he struggled through every <br/>
complication that could arise.  He survived but the cost was great; <br/>
he suffered permanent injury to his brain, his liver, and his <br/>
intestines.  As a result, he has quadraplegic cerebral palsy, mental <br/>
retardation, epilepsy, vision impairment, and he is non-verbal.  He <br/>
takes no food by mouth, and is fed formula and medications through a <br/>
tube placed directly into his intestine.  He has a permanent central <br/>
venous catheter placed in his chest for his daily IV medications and <br/>
fluids.  The bone marrow transplant was only partially successful; <br/>
and my son is hospitalized frequently for severe, life-threatening <br/>
infections.<br/>
<br/>
His disabilities are awful; however, *he* is a delightful, joy-filled <br/>
child with a great curiousity about the world.  My son has a <br/>
decreased life expectancy; he is unlikely to survive beyond his <br/>
teens.  And while this is painful to think about, since I love him so <br/>
completely, this knowledge has also freed us in a way that my dh and <br/>
I had never imagined.  We are free to live completely for today.<br/>
<br/>
I *do* have therapists for my son who help him gain mobility; he has <br/>
a physical therapist, and an occupational therapist.  Did I *ask* him <br/>
if he wanted therapy?  No.  And he does not have the cognitive <br/>
ability to understand the question even if I did.  Does *he* <br/>
determine what his goals are for therapy?  Yes &lt;g&gt;.  I&#39;ve seen <br/>
therapists try to make my son do what he does *not* want to do, and I <br/>
can only admire my son&#39;s tenacity in sticking to his right NOT to do <br/>
something.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, back to unschooling...I learned quite a while ago that my son <br/>
will *only* learn what he is motivated to learn; but more <br/>
importantly, that he *can* learn when it is something that *he* wants <br/>
to know.  My role is to recognize what motivates him, and to provide <br/>
safe opportunities for him to learn.  I offer materials and <br/>
activities that I think he might enjoy, based on his other interests, <br/>
and he is free to choose what he wants to do.  I believe in him, and <br/>
his right to a life that makes him happy. <br/>
<br/>
This belief in my youngest child led me to look at my other children, <br/>
and gradually my dh and I began to reevaluate all that we thought we <br/>
knew about homeschooling, education and learning.  I still don&#39;t call <br/>
myself an *unschooler* or what we do as *unschooling*.  I have an <br/>
instinctive resistance to labels, I suppose.  I do admit, though, <br/>
that we are closer to *unschooling* than anything else on the <br/>
homeschool continuum.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the length...my son&#39;s story doesn&#39;t really have a condensed <br/>
version. &lt;g&gt; I hope that other parents raising children with special <br/>
needs will recognize that even the most disabled child has the right <br/>
to make choices for his life, no matter how limited that life might <br/>
be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-900284788">I do want to clarify (and I apologize for not doing so in my previous <br/>
message) that I am referring to high functioning autism, sensory <br/>
integration dysfunction, dyslexia...any of those labels that <br/>
overlap (the type of child that the previous messages were referring <br/>
to).  I have loads of experience in unschooling a child who fits (not <br/>
neatly, however) into those categories (and more!).<br/>
<br/>
I have NO experience with unschooling other types of special needs <br/>
children.  <br/>
<br/>
But I have to believe that honoring a child for Who He Is and letting <br/>
the child SHINE by following his heart and his passions, instead of <br/>
force-feeding information that they don&#39;t care about has got to be <br/>
the right way to go.<br/>
