<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731799001">Hi all. <br/>
<br/>
Well the move to Oregon is complete (for the most part), the <br/>
conference is over and I&#39;ve been finding some morning hours to check <br/>
in here again. I&#39;ve missed you all! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be reading and posting as I can. It&#39;s good to start feeling <br/>
settled again.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>

<br/>
I had just posted your speech, from Sandra&#39;s site,  to my Minnesota Unschooling list.   And one of the members had said how she&#39;s missed you.   I agreed and said you were probably pretty busy with the move and all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to tell her to come on over to this list also :)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for putting that all down for us,  your speech that is.    Also,  thank you Sandra for including in your site,  your site is becoming quite the place.  Great work!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s Mary&#39;s speech for anyone who would like to check it out.   I was at the conference but didn&#39;t get to make it to this presentation of hers :(     Now I got to read it,  so I&#39;m happy.  :)<br/>

Great speech ...I liked the part about school supposedly preparing you for <br/>
the &quot;real world&quot;, whatever that is. Here are some lyrics relating to this from a <br/>
song by John Mayer called &quot;No Such Thing&quot;. The song is mainly about the <br/>
singer&#39;s feelings of deception after his years at school. The whole song is <br/>
actually pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
They love to tell you <br/>
Stay inside the lines<br/>
But something&#39;s better<br/>
On the other side<br/>
<br/>
I wanna run through the halls of my high school<br/>
I wanna scream at the<br/>
Top of my lungs<br/>
I just found out there&#39;s no such thing<br/>
as the real world<br/>
Just a lie you got to rise above<br/>

Thanks Amy and Kelli. :o) <br/>
<br/>
If I hadn&#39;t been in the middle of moving while I was writing it, I <br/>
probably would have gone into a Matrix analogy about the real world <br/>
too. &lt;g&gt; That would&#39;ve been fun.<br/>
