<br/>
       Insurance doesn&#39;t actually prevent bad things from happening, it just <br/>
compensates you for some of the loss. The idea is that it insures against you <br/>
being  wiped out by whatever trouble finds you.<br/>
<br/>
       After the car crash, insurance towed the wreck away, replaced it, and <br/>
paid the medical bills. It also paid the post-trauma psychologist to help with <br/>
the involuntary panic response I was enduring every time I had to ride in the <br/>
car. I guess the airbags that kept it from being worse than it was were a <br/>
sort of &quot;insurance&quot; too.<br/>
<br/>
       Maybe unschooling is like insurance then. Maybe it can&#39;t cure anything <br/>
or stop bad things from happening or various fates from befalling us, but it <br/>
does help insure that we can handle it all in a healthy way and keep chugging <br/>
along.  JJ<br/>

It keeps school from happening to our children.<br/>
That is a large set of &quot;happenings&quot; to which they are not exposed if they <br/>
don&#39;t go to school.<br/>

<br/>
Sandra, that is more profound that one could really imagine.  My daughter had <br/>
a horrifying event happen when she was in middle school.  She was home for a <br/>
week sick with grief, unable to function.  When she returned to school with <br/>
the note saying there had been a death in the family and to please be gentle <br/>
with her and allow her to call to be picked up if necessary, all went well except <br/>
with the classroom teacher.<br/>
<br/>
He laughed at her, talked about it in class, that she was just being silly <br/>
and school was more important because dead is dead.  Which of course it is, but <br/>
that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t still have a broken heart and just be sick over <br/>
the loss of someone so special to you.<br/>
<br/>
I am SO glad that I will never have to worry about her being treated so less <br/>
than by people who feel their importance in her life is much greater than it <br/>
should be in some supposedly mandatory place, claiming to be GOOD for the <br/>
children!<br/>

illness.  When I returned to school the following week, my German teacher, <br/>
whom I hated, was having us translate sentences. He deliberately looked at <br/>
me and told me to translate, &quot;What is your father&#39;s name&quot; into German. I <br/>
got up and walked out of the class, slamming the door. He wrote a note home <br/>
to my mother, telling her that I was &quot;milking my father&#39;s death for all it <br/>
was worth.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I transferred out of the class, and that was the end of German for me. <br/>
Though I went on to learn French and Spanish with some wonderful teachers. <br/>
Unfortunately, all it takes is a few bad ones...<br/>

Danielle, <br/>
I&#39;m sorry to hear that, it had to be devastating to you.  Doesn&#39;t it make you <br/>
wonder what kind of person, much less teacher would be like that with a <br/>
child?  They are molding our children&#39;s minds, but very often NOT for any <br/>
betterment!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry that happened, it probably still stings today to remember it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-346669425">So ya&#39;ll know my problems with DSS. The social worker just sent me a packet of information about Head Start. She&#39;s trying to convince me that Logan should attend...<br/>
<br/>
What a trip! Under &quot;Head Start Program Options&quot; it says &quot;Center Based Option: ...Families receive montly home visits from a family worker who supports them in identifying and reaching their personal and family goals.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
There is also a bit in there about parental involvement...it&#39;s also a good one...&quot;Parents participate in decision making and program planning through the Policy Council. Montly meetings at the center give parents an opportunity to share ideas and to get acquainted with other parents in the program. Parents acts as volunteers throughout the program in every setting.&quot; It continues on to &quot;Family Services: Our family support staff helps parents access resources within the community. Monthly visits with  your family worker provide an opportunity to share information, set goals, and build on the individual strengths of each family.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Great. As if I didn&#39;t already have pressure from my mother, social services, and friends who don&#39;t understand...yet another way to be pressured into conformity. <br/>
<br/>
And there isn&#39;t even one in my town...he&#39;d have to be bused into a neighboring town. At three years old. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think so! Thanks but no thanks...but I gotta play along and look like I&#39;m truly considering all of this, so I suppose we&#39;ll schedule a time to take Logan and &quot;drop in&quot; and &quot;check it out.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
SIGH.......I don&#39;t know if I mentioned it or not, but at the last visit with the social worker, guess what the topic of focus was? Sarah not being in school....and how I must certainly need a break from the kids...the phrase most said was &quot;how do you do it?&quot; and comments like &quot;I&#39;d need a break from my kids and I only have two!&quot; yadda yadda yadda I&#39;m sure you could fill in the rest of the conversation...<br/>
<br/>
So of course, Sarah is asking to go back to school. I&#39;ve stalled her for the moment by saying Daddy and I would talk about it. We did. For about two minutes. Long enough to agree that it isn&#39;t happening at this point. <br/>
<br/>
I gotta go clean house and work off some of the angst from the pressure...<br/>

time, rather than coming home worn out from a day at school. It&#39;s also a <br/>
lot different (in some ways) being home with &quot;school-aged&quot; kids than with <br/>
&quot;preschoolers&quot;. The younger kids need a different kind of attention. The <br/>
older kids are usually starting to move outward more and actually *want* <br/>
some time to themselves.<br/>
I think it helps to point out the differences so they don&#39;t get defensive <br/>
about their own choices.<br/>

unhealthy choices for herself.  There is a ton of<br/>
assuming happening on their part, and you know what<br/>
assuming does ;-)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, they are assuming alot there...I do get time away, I get to sleep in when I need to...it&#39;s not that difficult. Yes, I go for two to three days at a stretch all alone, but I can and do handle it well...and if I&#39;m really having a bad day, I have ladies from my church who would gladly drop everything to come by, and after her working hours I have my friend Laura available. <br/>
<br/>
SIGH...it&#39;s a mess, but we&#39;ll get through it. The good thing, the social worker is at least willing to hear me out about things..although I am incredibly unable to talk coherently sometimes when face to face with someone, especially one in a threatening position. She may be a nice person, but simply by working for DSS that&#39;s threatening!!! I have to anticipate possible questions and rehearse myself with possible answers in order to put things together...it&#39;s weird how I&#39;m like that because I can get on stage and improv just fine; I enjoy acting and have been involved in community theater, etc. But get me face to face on a personal level and I clam up.<br/>
