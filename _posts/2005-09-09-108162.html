<div id="ygrps-yiv-376974824">The Naked Ladies./Surprise lilies/Resurrection Lilies always bloom within a <br/>
few days of our daughter&#39;s birthday.  I have 9 years worth of pictures with <br/>
her at (or on) the sideboard in the dining room with a vase full of them. <br/>
Several years ago, after she had internalized that the blooms meant her <br/>
birthday was at hand,  I mentioned to her that they bloomed a week after the <br/>
first writing spiders appeared.  Serious birthday cake planning now begins <br/>
with the first writing spider.  She observed and recorded a year or two <br/>
later that preying mantises appear 2 weeks after the resurrection lilies. <br/>
She appears to be correct, at least as far as the indicator of when I have a <br/>
mantis in a jar on the kitchen window.  All of this depends on which day it <br/>
rains, but the general time line is dependable.  I am less sure of her <br/>
dependability in sexing the things, but he assures me she can and will <br/>
manage to breed some this fall.  Why not???<br/>
<br/>
What is remarkable to me as an involved but non interfering observer is the <br/>
sheer number of these observations she has made - and made her own.  When <br/>
she was 4 she could look at caterpillar poop and tell you whether the <br/>
caterpillar was ready to cocoon and metamorphose.<br/>
<br/>
I love unschooling for a whole bunch of reasons and love my daughter for <br/>
many more, but the connections like naked lady lilies and a whole host of <br/>
&quot;unteachable&quot; learning skills rank pretty high in the why element of that <br/>
love for unschooling.<br/>

&gt; That link said this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lycoris radiata (Dwarf Surprise Lily)<br/>
&gt; Sun to Light ShadeZone: 6-10, at least 15&quot; tall Origin: China<br/>
&gt; This Southern heirloom bulb is one of the most popular plants in old <br/>
&gt; Southern<br/>
&gt; gardens. The small, narrow strap-like blue-green leaves die away in early<br/>
&gt; spring. Then seemingly out of nowhere in August, the 15&quot; tall spikes <br/>
&gt; emerge from<br/>
&gt; underground, topped with a deciduous azalea-like flower of bright red. <br/>
&gt; After<br/>
&gt; the flowers fade, the leaves emerge again and persist until spring, <br/>
&gt; producing<br/>
&gt; food for next year&#39;s flowering. L. radiata doesn&#39;t always flower every<br/>
&gt; year...we feel the flowering is probably controlled by aliens who like to <br/>
&gt; torment<br/>
&gt; Earth-bound gardeners.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I LOVE that, because Holly said maybe the aliens sent it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; My neighbor, when I asked him, didn&#39;t know but said &quot;Maybe those lights on<br/>
&gt; the crest the other night caused it&quot; (people reported strange lights one <br/>
&gt; night;<br/>
&gt; it was a mountaintop photo shoot with bright lighting at night, we heard)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m definitely going to dig it up and move it to a safer place.   Maybe it<br/>
&gt; would have bloomed other years but Keith mows the lawn.   The bulbs we <br/>
&gt; planted<br/>
&gt; there were planted seven or eight years ago, and after that we&#39;ve moved <br/>
&gt; every<br/>
&gt; one we saw come up to better places.<br/>
