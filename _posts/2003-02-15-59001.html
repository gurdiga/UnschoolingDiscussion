<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but I don&#39;t like people<br/>
&gt; making excuses for not being able to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So basically there are no legitimate reasons why someone might have trouble<br/>
unschooling to the degree that you do?<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it depends on what you consider a &quot;legitimate reason&quot;, and/or<br/>
whether any of them ARE legitimate on a list where unschooling is assumed to<br/>
be the goal of every member.<br/>
<br/>
If someone comes here and says honestly, &quot;I am intrigued by unschooling, but<br/>
I&#39;m really really afraid&quot; people are very likely to ask her (kindly) what<br/>
she&#39;s afraid of, and if she can put names to those fears to reassure her<br/>
through stories of their own families and families they know well how to<br/>
combat those fears or the causes of them.<br/>
<br/>
If someone comes here and says, &quot;I unschool except for math because it&#39;s<br/>
very important that math be learned in a logical, precise order so there&#39;s<br/>
no messing around on THAT!&quot; she is probably still going to be treated with<br/>
kindness (okay, I might make a joke because I find myself amusing, but I&#39;d<br/>
still try to be kind and help, too) and stories about unschooling and the<br/>
learning of mathematical concepts.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone might have trouble with anything, unschooling included. Hence, this<br/>
list, the goal of which is to help each other with unschooling. The list is<br/>
not here to pretend that someone can&#39;t unschool because of their &quot;legitimate<br/>
reason&quot;, it&#39;s to explore their stated reasons, offer suggestions and advice,<br/>
some of which might help them see that their &quot;legitimate reason&quot; doesn&#39;t in<br/>
the end hold water.<br/>
<br/>
So tell me, what &quot;legitimate reason(s)&quot; do you think there are for not<br/>
unschooling?<br/>
