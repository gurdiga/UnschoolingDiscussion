(he has  a great children&#39;s book called &quot;Little Soul<br/>
and the Sun&quot; that <br/>
is <br/>
about exactly  this idea of children choosing their<br/>
life circumstances <br/>
before <br/>
they enter,  good or bad.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a CHILDREN&#39;S book????<br/>
 <br/>
Now, see, THAT&#39;s bad. Sure---adults who want to<br/>
believe that their <br/>
children  <br/>
chose them is fine. But to put all that on a CHILD? I<br/>
don&#39;t think <br/>
that&#39;s  good.<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
But, what&#39;s so bad about having a children&#39;s book<br/>
about it?  I think we should all read the book before<br/>
criticizing it;  even if we are biased about the<br/>
topic.  There are lots of children&#39;s book I don&#39;t<br/>
like, but that doesn&#39;t mean I think they shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
available.  For example, all those children&#39;s books<br/>
about mommy having another baby.  Most all of them are<br/>
stories about mommy going to the hospital or bottle<br/>
feeding the baby.  I don&#39;t necessarily think they&#39;re<br/>
&quot;BAD&quot;, I just don&#39;t choose them to read to my child in<br/>
helping to explain birth. (We homebirth and<br/>
breastfeed.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, there are a ton of children&#39;s religious books. <br/>
Just because I&#39;m not a practicing Christian doesn&#39;t<br/>
make me think they&#39;re &quot;BAD&quot;.  Yes I cringe at the<br/>
sight of them and no I wouldn&#39;t choose one to check<br/>
out for my child from the library, but at least they<br/>
are available for children who do have an interest.<br/>
<br/>
Talking to my partner about the idea of whether or not<br/>
a child picks his parents before being born into this<br/>
world- even choosing to be born into bad circumstances<br/>
like to parents who abuse them, he shared that he has<br/>
an early childhood memory- one of his firsts, of being<br/>
given the choice of what type of life he wanted to be<br/>
born into.  What parents he wanted to be born to.<br/>
*Ohmigosh!* Great, I thought, there goes my theory.  I<br/>
was shocked and intrigued to hear him say that his<br/>
earliest memory was being in a conversation with<br/>
someone and being given the choice of a few different<br/>
types of lives to be born into.  He told me that he<br/>
told this &quot;being&quot; that he wanted an easy life this<br/>
time around and wanted to live in the US.  So it be.<br/>
(?) No, my partner is not crazy.  Yes, he is eclectic<br/>
and has traveled to India several times and has hung<br/>
out with the Dali Lama and other teachers.  But, I<br/>
have to believe him, right?  But, how to make sense of<br/>
this?  I asked him, what about an innocent child<br/>
choosing to be born to parents who<br/>
mentally/physically/sexually abuse him/her and kill<br/>
them?  Do you think someone would choose that?  And<br/>
why?  He says, they are probably give the choice of a<br/>
few lives and they may or may not pick the better one.<br/>
 That some people may only choose to be on this earth<br/>
for a short time.  That some people need to learn<br/>
something and through those experiences, that&#39;s how<br/>
they learn what they need to learn to move on.  I<br/>
said, what about a little baby who gets killed?  What<br/>
do they learn from that?  He says, well,<br/>
contemplation. <br/>
<br/>
So, I guess to make a long story short, I mainly<br/>
wanted to share this story, which makes me wonder if<br/>
there are other children out there who do remember<br/>
given the choice of parents to be born to?  And, how<br/>
can this be explained if it is not a fact?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But, what&#39;s so bad about having a children&#39;s book about it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t comment on the book since I haven&#39;t read it. But I can comment on<br/>
the idea of passing on the idea of souls choosing the life they lead onto a<br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
I can see that it could be healing for an adult who is out of an abusive<br/>
past to look at the positive that came out of it and embrace the idea that<br/>
they chose to live through that in order to learn what they did. (Or even<br/>
accept that their soul learned something that they may not be able to<br/>
understand until after death.)<br/>
<br/>
But for a child who is living a life of abuse -- from parents who think they<br/>
are being good parents -- it could just add to the burden she&#39;s bearing.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s romantic to think of a happy child who loves her life being presented<br/>
with the idea that she chose the parents she did. But it&#39;s short sighted not<br/>
to take into account the effect on children who are leading rotten lives.<br/>
<br/>
Learning something from a bad experience doesn&#39;t justify the bad experience<br/>
or the existence of bad experiences. There are far too many people suffering<br/>
through bad experiences who will end up damaged and pass that damage on to<br/>
others to suggest that because good can come from bad, that there must be a<br/>
good reason for bad.<br/>
