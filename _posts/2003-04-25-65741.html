<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137405710">Hello<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if anyone remembers me at all. I peeked in here for a <br/>
few weeks in January/February. I&#39;ve been reading with interest and <br/>
hope, the thread(s) on late starting talkers, and have a question for <br/>
you whose kids started speaking late: Did your late talkers also read <br/>
late?<br/>
<br/>
My Katie was a late starting talker, incomprehensible before about <br/>
age 6, when she suddenly took off with all elements of her speech: <br/>
articulation, grammar, etc. And, at eight, she simply is not a <br/>
reader. My other kids all had reading down pat by 6 or 7, with one or <br/>
two lessons. Not my youngest. Oh! She knows her phonics, that&#39;s for <br/>
sure! But knowing phonics hasn&#39;t turned her into a reader.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking, as with the speech, time will bring her around. Anyone <br/>
else have a late talker &gt; late reader correlation? And eight probably <br/>
isn&#39;t late, anyway. It&#39;s just more than a year later than my other <br/>
kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-195194279">No, eight isn&#39;t late at all.  Unless you&#39;re in public school.  Then <br/>
the difference between 6 and 8 is tremendous.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know whether my late talker will be a late reader, because <br/>
he&#39;s not quite 5.  But I understand what you say about phonics not <br/>
leading to reading.  Last night my son wanted to play a game where I <br/>
say a word, any word, and he tells me what letter it starts with.  <br/>
And he did!  Every time.  He was so proud of himself, showing off, <br/>
even saying words that he wanted me to ask that I was holding back <br/>
because I didn&#39;t know he knew blends.  But he can&#39;t read.  Somehow <br/>
the letter sounds don&#39;t translate for him to paper.<br/>
<br/>
He spent almost two weeks practicing the word &quot;zebra&quot;.  He typed it <br/>
over and over, from memory, and he knew what word it was.  Then one <br/>
day we were playing with sidewalk chalk and wrote &quot;zebra&quot;.  I <br/>
said, &quot;You know this word!&quot;  And he just stared blankly and <br/>
said, &quot;What is it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is one word that he knows in print and can spell out loud.  And <br/>
it isn&#39;t his name.  It&#39;s &quot;poop&quot;.  And it amuses him to no end.<br/>
<br/>
But all the experts who say phonics are the key to reading are <br/>
missing a piece.  My son knows the sound of every single letter, and <br/>
he recognizes by sight every single letter, and he simply doesn&#39;t <br/>
read.  So much for that theory.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555815179">Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Late Talking = Late Reading?<br/>
<br/>
Three of my four children would be considered &#39;early&#39; talkers, the third<br/>
was probably considered &#39;average age&#39;.  My oldest (11 in Dec) is just<br/>
beginning to read,  so would be considered &#39;late&#39;.  The second dd turned<br/>
8 in Jan.,  she is the one who talked at probably average age.  She is<br/>
also in the early reading stages,  but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if she<br/>
&#39;takes off&#39; with it soon....we&#39;ll see!  Third dd just turned five.  She<br/>
recognizes a few words from TV and computer games and &#39;pretends&#39; to<br/>
read,  but is not what I would call a reader.  Simon is 2.5 and has<br/>
talked in full sentences since about 14-15 months.<br/>
<br/>
Keep unschooling and those arbitrary expectations about reading,<br/>
talking, multiplying, etc will gradually fade away....and with them most<br/>
of your worries!<br/>
<br/>
Susan.....who has to re-read the article about &quot;waiting to exhale&quot;<br/>
concerning reading so my worries will continue to fade.  And who was<br/>
&#39;late&#39; as a baby/toddler with many things like talking and walking,  but<br/>
was considered an &#39;early&#39; reader.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My experience was similar to yours.  My son knew all the letters and many of <br/>
the sounds before he was 3.  He spent the next 4 years gathering more and <br/>
more information.  At 7 and one month, he read Green Eggs and Ham with no <br/>
assistance.  I was just patient and didn&#39;t push the issue. I never tested him <br/>
or quizzed him or tried to get him to read.  If he became interested in <br/>
knowing what something said, I would let him know I was present to him and he <br/>
could ask me if he needed help.  I trusted him and knew that he wanted to <br/>
read, and that it would just be a matter of brain development.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; him anything about reading.  We lived our life and words and <br/>
letters and ideas attached to them occurred (and still occur) as a part of it <br/>
every day.  I shared with him about letters and reading the same way I shared <br/>
how to cut up his pancakes.  I read to him when he asked and interpreted <br/>
signs for him and didn&#39;t push.    I made sure I affirmed to him that reading <br/>
was something he would develop into, just like getting better at baseball (in <br/>
which he is intensely interested).  <br/>
<br/>
My son doesn&#39;t like to be read to, by the way.  That&#39;s a standard thing <br/>
people say about kids and education, both schoolers and homeschoolers--just <br/>
read to them, that&#39;s the best thing you can do for their education.  When he <br/>
was a toddler, I read to him all the regular books, but he had little <br/>
patience for all the words.  He wanted to see the pictures.  If I wanted to <br/>
read it all, I had to read FAST!   Now that he is reading fluently and longer <br/>
books, he still doesn&#39;t want to be read to.  But he will listen to books on <br/>
tape, especially if they are acted instead of read.  He doesn&#39;t always pay <br/>
attention to those, either.<br/>
<br/>
Each child is different.  We just have to trust them to know themselves.<br/>

Now that you  mention it, Holly was preemie, talked later than the boys, and <br/>
read later.<br/>

back and forth.  She&#39;s in a &quot;read to me&quot; stage but has been in &quot;don&#39;t&quot; stage <br/>
many times.  For long stretches she will want to go to sleep to music, but <br/>
then sometimes (currently) I need to read.  She will boot me again at some <br/>
point for some new video or CD. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And soon I hope she&#39;ll be up to reading herself to sleep. <br/>
<br/>
She has tried a couple of chapter books, but isn&#39;t up to long-term reading <br/>
without assistance with a word here or there and she isn&#39;t willing to skip <br/>
words.  I skipped words when I was first reading.  It didn&#39;t bother me.<br/>

They&#39;re all different.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I daresay I was *not* patient and *did* push my oldest dd.  I expected<br/>
her to read early and to love reading.  As a child,  I was an early<br/>
reader.  This and society has this message that &quot;Reading is the key to<br/>
education and education is the key to success. Knowledge is power.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I found unschooling.com very early in my homeschooling decision.  Katy<br/>
went to kindergarten and we decided during that year to homeschool.  I<br/>
met someone who had started homeschooling that year,  and unschooled.  I<br/>
read at the website and began reading at this e-list.  That was almost 6<br/>
years ago.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And even after reading and thinking I understood unschooling ideas,  I<br/>
found myself in periods of frustration and impatience about reading.  I<br/>
found within my mind all the ideas that had been ingrained:  if you<br/>
don&#39;t read early,  you are less intelligent,  without reading you cannot<br/>
gain knowledge.  I *knew* on some levels (through reading mostly LOL)<br/>
that there are other forms of intelligence.  But the idea of reading<br/>
late and all the little goblins society had planted in my psyche about<br/>
it have haunted me for years.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have gradually let them go as I become aware of them.  I believe my<br/>
younger children will benefit most.  I believe my attitudes,  mental<br/>
fears and creepy doubts have hindered Katy in learning to read.  And I<br/>
believe she will read well at some point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I find my own journey in unschooling as powerful in enabling me to work<br/>
toward what Maslow would call self actualization.  Two recent things<br/>
have brought me even further on this journey in regard to reading.<br/>
First,  my parents died last fall.  (each of separate illnesses, nine<br/>
days apart)  And we moved to a new home/neighborhood.  The drama and<br/>
busyness of real life consumed me and there was no time to read.  After<br/>
the deaths and funerals, etc.  I found several what I call &quot;grief<br/>
handicaps&quot;.  One was that I was not capable of reading.  Oh,  I could<br/>
read words,  but I didn&#39;t care to,  and had little to no comprehension.<br/>
More than a few paragraphs on something absolutely pertinent to my needs<br/>
did not compute.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I have learned more in some ways in the past 6 months than I can<br/>
even explain.  I have learned how *I* am capable of learning in other<br/>
ways besides reading.  And how limiting it is to learn primarily through<br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
The other mental breakthrough came through Sandra.  Her descriptions of<br/>
Holly being in the theater production.  Sandra explained how Holly<br/>
memorized her lines (this came up here again recently).  And Sandra&#39;s<br/>
description of Holly doing a presentation with her Girl Scout Troop was<br/>
a big &quot;AHA&quot; thing for me.  To paraphrase and summarize,  Sandra<br/>
described how Holly,  though she wasn&#39;t reading, was able to present her<br/>
topic in a lively way.  Holly really *knew* her stuff.  Whereas,  most<br/>
of the &#39;reading&#39; scouts read reports in a monotone and showed little<br/>
depth of knowledge or real enjoyment of the subject.<br/>
(Thanks,  Sandra....one more example of how you impact others for the<br/>
greater good.)<br/>
<br/>
An interesting note,  during the past 6 months,  Katy has begun to show<br/>
an interest and growth in reading.  And I know it has been wonderful for<br/>
us all for me to not have the shadows of my often unconscious pressure<br/>
and expectation to hinder her (and her siblings).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who stayed with me...thanks ;-)  <br/>
<br/>
Susan.....who is surprised to see this tome come out of her! I suppose<br/>
confession is good for the soul.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003441683">*Each child is different.  We just have to trust them to know themselves.*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely. This has been my experience. My late talkers were late readers and found it harder to get going. My oldest was an early talker but school really did demotivate her so that when she came home from grade 4 she really didn&#39;t read things for at least 6 months even though she was able to.<br/>
<br/>
My 7 year old who never experienced any form of school,no formal intro to letters,words etc... was reading and none of us,him included were aware he could read.We discovered it by chance one day when his Grandma was visiting and he was looking at a book with her. He started telling her what it said. She was surprised he was reading as he was just 6. He turned to me in amazement and said&quot;I&#39;m reading? I didn&#39;t know I could read.&quot; It was quite amusing and quite a plug for unschooling in front of the doubting granny. Her next comment was Yes but what about math? YEESH!!!<br/>

Me too, Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
Two and a half reading lessons.  <br/>
<br/>
Not because I thought he couldn&#39;t learn but I thought he would be happier and <br/>
I would be more relieved and the grandparents would praise him...<br/>
<br/>
He cried.  He thumped his head down on the book and cried.<br/>
<br/>
I promised him a Ninja Turtle toy he really wanted if he would finish another <br/>
session (AND my sessions were being too long!!! Why didn&#39;t I just go with <br/>
five minute sessions!?  I was stupid.)<br/>
<br/>
He said he didn&#39;t want that toy anymore.  I saw the depth of his pain and <br/>
despair and realized I could make him hate reading AND me, and hugged him and <br/>
rocked him and apologized and said never again.  <br/>
<br/>
So the younger ones were spared.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I find my own journey in unschooling as powerful in enabling me to work<br/>
toward what Maslow would call self actualization. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Just this morning another mom I&#39;ve known for years was saying she doesn&#39;t <br/>
know how I can keep helping other homeschoolers.  We were laughing about it, <br/>
but I have to think this:  &quot;How can I not?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It has become part of what and who I am at this stage of my life.  Other <br/>
stages and things will come, but for now I&#39;m helping others come where my <br/>
kids have passed.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The other mental breakthrough came through Sandra.  Her descriptions of<br/>
Holly being in the theater production.  Sandra explained how Holly<br/>
memorized her lines (this came up here again recently). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
y* did that without being clear what I was trying to convey--that there is an <br/>
advantage to not reading sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
With all our history of hearing and feeling &quot;if you<br/>
don&#39;t read early,  you are less intelligent,  without reading you cannot<br/>
gain knowledge&quot; it is almost impossible to see advantages to older kids not <br/>
reading, and it undoubtedly sounds like lame-o justification to those whose <br/>
four year olds picked up a book and read, but I saw Holly learn clearly and <br/>
deeply BECAUSE she couldn&#39;t read, and learn in ways that bypass reading, that <br/>
are not in the least dependent on her finding her old notes to check her <br/>
facts, or finding her 3x5 cards to see if she still remembers her speech, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I could never and still can&#39;t listen to poetry.  It starts to sound like just <br/>
noise, soon, and I can&#39;t comprehend it.   <br/>
<br/>
Holly has been asking me to read poetry and she really gets it, follows, can <br/>
quote back, can ask questions.  My feeling when people read poetry aloud is <br/>
never anything but &quot;Are you done yet?  Can I go?&quot;  I love song lyrics but <br/>
somehow aloud-poetry fritzes me out.  I can read it visually.  I see <br/>
disadvantages from my fairly-early reading (not pre-school, but fluent by <br/>
seven and reading anything by nine).  I am dependent on reading, and I often <br/>
cannot remember what I read (I just remember where it was) and I cannot hear <br/>
and remember without taking notes.<br/>

developed (he is a non-reader 10)- like I can read him his Yu-Gi-oh cards<br/>
once, and he remembers them.  I dont even try to remember things- I just<br/>
have to reread everything- and write everything down- I wonder if many &quot;good<br/>
readers&quot; in school also have this &quot;handi cap&quot; and I wonder what I would have<br/>
been like if I had not been pushed to read on someone else&#39;s timetable.<br/>
<br/>
Also, about the late reading- I think on some level, the men in my family<br/>
realize the pain they had about reading in their child hood.  My fil will<br/>
ask &quot;how is your reading&quot; or try to bribe ds and stuff (oooh! that chapped<br/>
my hide!), but then comes up with a story, out of the blue about him being<br/>
in fourth grade and being put up in front of the class with his teacher<br/>
announcing to the whole class how he was failing each subject. and he laughs<br/>
&quot;I didnt care!&quot; - and I think he must look at my sweet happy wonderful son<br/>
and be in awe that a child can have a life like his, and that his own life<br/>
was full of allot of pain.<br/>

<br/>
Someone said that, if a child is interested in golf or skiing or polo, he <br/>
would need &quot;lessons&quot;. And reading is the same way. <br/>
<br/>
I agree with Tuck that &quot;sharing&quot; is how he&#39;ll get there. I feel QUITE <br/>
confident that Tiger Woods&#39; kids won&#39;t need &quot;lessons&quot;---&#39;cause those children <br/>
will be SURROUNDED by golf and it will seep in through their pores. IF they <br/>
want to learn golf, it&#39;ll be kind of through osmosis. Peekaboo Street&#39;s <br/>
children will &quot;be&quot; on skis from birth (and before) and will &quot;understand the <br/>
motion involved in staying on skis (IF they&#39;re interested). I know &quot;horsey&quot; <br/>
children who could ride before they could walk! They were more comfortable on <br/>
top of a horse than off---they needed no &quot;lessons&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is lovingly surrounded by whatever it is he wants to learn, he <br/>
will learn it almost effortlessly. My boys know all about dogs and training, <br/>
although they&#39;ve done none of it. They could start immediately just because <br/>
they&#39;re surrounded by trained and untrained dogs---it would just &quot;flow&quot;. And <br/>
I&#39;d be there to answer questions and lower the frustration factor.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan learned to swim last year. We have a pool. No lessons. Just A LOT of <br/>
time in the water. He&#39;s learning the read the same way---lots of reading <br/>
material around with folks that like to read.<br/>
<br/>
Being surrounded by books and reading and numbers and math and nature and <br/>
music and golf and horses and snow..... will NATURALLY make it easier to pick <br/>
up the skill. Children who are allowed and encouraged to LEARN on their own <br/>
will be more comfortable LATER learning things that might be more foreign to <br/>
them---with or withOUT lessons.<br/>

I could tune a guitar the minute I picked one up, from hearing my mom tune <br/>
hers for years.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve said before I had one guitar lesson and then played, but I should amend <br/>
that to I had one lesson to find out how to read chord charts and how to <br/>
fingerpick and THEN I just played.  My mom read nothing, and she played with <br/>
a flat pick, country style.  I wanted to learn finger picking.<br/>

In my personal experience anyway.  I know we have had private coaches for <br/>
different things the children were interested in, because they WANTED them <br/>
and wanted to give extra time and attention to a particular sport or whatever <br/>
it was at the time they really wanted to excel in.<br/>
<br/>
So, if kids want/ask, I would say it&#39;s a good thing for them.<br/>

<br/>
There will be teachers and teacherly people who will observe my kids reading <br/>
and writing and say &quot;Somewhere in there they had lessons.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You seem determined NOT to believe that people can learn by observation and <br/>
trial and error.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They might not call it &quot;lessons&quot; but I would bet almost anything there <br/>
would <br/>
be some &quot;private coaches&quot; involved. . . . . as in the case of Tiger Woods.  I <br/>
bet he would find <br/>
the absolute best coach for his child he could.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why would Tiger Woods need to find a coach for his child?  If his kids play <br/>
golf with him, his friends, his opponents, his students, won&#39;t they pick up <br/>
one bit at a time all kinds of advice, grips, stances, and overhear <br/>
discussions of all that?<br/>
<br/>
My kids have been around SCA combat (on foot, medieval armored combat) since <br/>
they were born.  They&#39;ve played with boffers.  They have started fighting in <br/>
armor.  They &quot;are naturals.&quot;  We&#39;re not finding the absolute best coaches we <br/>
can find for them.  They are involved with people they have known for years <br/>
who are throwing ideas at them in the course of their actual participation in <br/>
the sport.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So, if kids want/ask, I would say it&#39;s a good thing for them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve always provided them private coaches, they might assume there is no <br/>
other way, and so they will want it and ask for it.<br/>
<br/>
This parallels a child who thinks his mother taught him to speak and whose <br/>
mother is sure she taught him to read waiting for his mother to teach him to <br/>
add and subtract and multiply, because learning comes from mothers&#39; teaching.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Private coaches&quot; are teachers.<br/>
If you have always gotten your kids coaches, it will be that much harder for <br/>
you to trust that unschooling can work.<br/>
<br/>
That is not the same as saying you should never get a coach.<br/>
<br/>
Try to look at the range from never having a coached moment and always have a <br/>
full time coach, and THERE is the answer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It was an analogy---maybe not as good as I thought it was.<br/>
<br/>
A child surrounded by books and the written word and speaking parents will <br/>
NATURALLY pick up language and reading. A child surrounded by signing parents <br/>
will NATURALLY pick up sign language. A child surrounded by numbers and <br/>
&quot;math-out-loud&quot; will NATURALLY pick up math. A child surrounded by golf <br/>
courses and balls and clubs and the best golfer around will NATURALLY pick up <br/>
golf from watching, asking, trying, watching some more, etc. (Hell---a child <br/>
with Tiger for a dad---why would he NEED a coach?!)<br/>
<br/>
Children who think that everything must be spoon-fed to them may ALWAYS  be <br/>
looking for a teacher. We&#39;re trying to raise children who love learning and <br/>
who are naturally GOOD at it. Who aren&#39;t searching for teachers for every <br/>
little thing. If they KNOW they learned to read and do math on their own (THE <br/>
two biggies for SCHOOL), they&#39;ll know they can do anything---although mine <br/>
both know that now---and one can&#39;t read! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe THAT&#39;S IT! That school has brainwashed people to believe that those two <br/>
things are SO difficult--- that children MUST have a &quot;trained&quot; teacher to do <br/>
it TO them? What unschoolers learn is that those two things are actually JUST <br/>
as easy as walking and talking and anything else they want to do!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it! DAMN!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So some things MIGHT require or desire a coach and something don&#39;t?  I can <br/>
give you one reason that golfing or baseball or basketball MIGHT require a <br/>
coach and SCA combat (which I am completely unfamiliar with but trust your <br/>
judgment that it doesn&#39;t require a coach) the one BIG difference, THOUSANDS <br/>
of dollars in scholarships, endorsements, and a possible pro career.  I&#39;m not <br/>
saying it&#39;s good or bad but if your child appears to have a natural talent <br/>
and loves something that could very well lead to a multi million dollar <br/>
career, to me that would be reasons parents choose private coaches.  Again, <br/>
not my judgment as to whether it&#39;s right or wrong. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already said we&#39;ve had private coaches for different things my children <br/>
wanted to do, even the child who was practically born with a baseball in his <br/>
hand wanted private coaches at some point, he got them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just simply about what the child WANTS.  If they ask, then it&#39;s OK <br/>
to provide that for them, but if the parent is PUSHING it, it&#39;s probably not <br/>
a good thing.  <br/>
<br/>
I think sometimes it just  a play on words.  If you child had the opportunity <br/>
to study/play with someone they highly looked up to for their skill at what <br/>
ever you child enjoys and your child spent a given amount of time with them <br/>
say playing games or SCA or whatever, it would be like mentoring and a good <br/>
thing.  Basically with some coaches it&#39;s the same thing, you get to spend <br/>
time with them learning the things YOU want so much to like them but sports <br/>
people charge you for it and call it coaching.  Some don&#39;t charge all the <br/>
time though, if they think you&#39;re good enough, they&#39;re glad to have the <br/>
opportunity to say they coached __________________.<br/>
<br/>
So while a lot of changing in thinking has to be done to get to the point <br/>
some of you are in your unschooling journey, sometimes I&#39;m finding out it&#39;s <br/>
just different words for the same thing.  I&#39;m learning to sort out the <br/>
differences.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your input, I greatly appreciate it.<br/>
