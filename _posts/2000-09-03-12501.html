<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419192199">Okay, I have been lurking on this thread for since the beginning....because I <br/>
did not want to be the one starting a flaming war...however, now that it is <br/>
in progress, I will jump right in too....THESE ARE MY OPINIONS! <br/>
<br/>
Carollyn,<br/>
I am not saying you are abusing your child.  What a terrify situation for <br/>
you!  In that moment, I would of had to really restrain myself from using <br/>
spanking/hitting to show how very dangerous that situation was.....<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I feel that children do not think like adults in many ways. <br/>
 As healthy well adjusted big people, if someone hits us then we feel we have <br/>
been wronged.  Even if it was because we did something that put ourselves in <br/>
danger.  I would feel there were more appropiate ways to express the severity <br/>
of the situation. I have the knowledge of life to think this way.  <br/>
Unfortuately, children do not have that advantage of experience, yet.<br/>
<br/>
As children, parents are the &quot;almighty&quot;.  Parents, are who children want to <br/>
become like....if my parents hit then hitting is okay (doesn&#39;t matter the <br/>
logic behind it), if my parents swear then swearing is okay (no matter what <br/>
the situation is), if my parent explain very scary situations (using the <br/>
flood of emotions that we parents feel, (like anger, fear, relief accompanied <br/>
with tears of fear and strong severe tone of voice) when our children do <br/>
these things ) then that is appropiate too.  I don&#39;t feel they like they say <br/>
&quot;oooh, I must have DONE something very bad because Mommy hit/spanked me&quot;  The <br/>
way children turn things around (because of their lack of life experiences) <br/>
they say &quot;I am very bad because I wanted to do _______.  Mommy saids so.  So <br/>
I deserve to be hit&quot;  No matter how many times, I explain after the facts <br/>
that led up to the hitting/spanking, this is still what children believe, <br/>
even though this is not the case....the seed is still planted for later in <br/>
life incidents...<br/>
<br/>
Has my daughter been hit/spanked? sadly yes....does that make it <br/>
right?.....NO WAY, no matter what the situtions were.....my dh and I are <br/>
working towards new parenting tools to use (ecspecially in these type of <br/>
scary and important situations that require severity of some sort)  We <br/>
explain to Ali that &quot;NO one has the right to hurt your body, and that <br/>
includes mommy spanking/hitting.  Please forgive me.&quot; then we go on to talk <br/>
about the situation leading to the spanking/hitting and more appropiate ways <br/>
to express our feelings and really let the emotions flow, including me saying <br/>
&quot;I feel so angry, I want to hit you.  I need to be away from you for awhile.&quot; <br/>
 I have seen my dd(3) tell her little brother and daddy, these very words.  I <br/>
have also heard her tell Matthew (1), &quot;you don&#39;t have the right to hurt my <br/>
body.  I am going away from you&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One way that children react like adults is they get angry and focus on the <br/>
hitting rather than the situation that lead up to it....<br/>
<br/>
anyway, hope this helps.  This is what works in our family...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-772119224">Julie, thank you for your open and honest opinion. I can understand <br/>
your veiwpoint and on some levels I agree. There were a million <br/>
different ways that I could have handled the situation and this is <br/>
the way I chose to handle it. Due to the place I was in at that of my <br/>
life and what I knew of my child at that time this is the way I felt <br/>
he would best understand the importance of the situation. I am not <br/>
saying that every person needs to handle this situation the same. <br/>
Every parent has the right to decide what is best for thier child. To <br/>
be honest if I were in the same exact situation knowing what I knew <br/>
then I would make the same decission again. However, every child is <br/>
different and thus every situation is different and people&#39;s <br/>
knowledge changes over time. Put in the situation today I might <br/>
handle it differently. I can&#39;t really say. We don&#39;t spend much time <br/>
in the mall these days due to the inconvenience not the scare of him <br/>
running off. It isn&#39;t as big a concern of mine now knowing that my <br/>
children know not to run off and are pretty well behaved and <br/>
extremely helpful when it comes to doing the shopping. And when I say <br/>
they don&#39;t runn off I mean that they don&#39;t disappear for almost 30 <br/>
mins in a packed store with no thought as to where their mother is. <br/>
They do tend to wander on down the isle of Walmart and look at the <br/>
merchandise. This is completely different from what he did in the <br/>
mall that day. Anyway, like I said before the problem I have with <br/>
replies to my inicial post is the accuations that seem to be implied <br/>
not the opinions themselves. Corallyn<br/>

<br/>
For the record, every spanking debate I have ever seen includes people <br/>
criticizing spanking as a method and people who spank (even occasionally) <br/>
feeling upset, as if they were personally reviled.  In the heat of the <br/>
moment, it&#39;s hard to be aware of subtleties, like the actual pronouns used in <br/>
a sentence.<br/>
<br/>
(And sometimes people do say &quot;You spank?  That&#39;s terrible&quot;.  But I don&#39;t <br/>
think THIS debate has dipped down to that personal level yet.  I can&#39;t speak <br/>
for any private flames that might have been mailed.)<br/>
