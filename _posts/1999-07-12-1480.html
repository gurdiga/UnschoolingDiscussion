<div id="ygrps-yiv-5527187">This reminded me of the three years we lived in the Aleutian Islands, on<br/>
the island of Adak. We were part of the civilian population there, and<br/>
the schools were State of Alaska public schools. They were great. I<br/>
think one of the reasons was because they were &quot;away&quot; from the &quot;powers<br/>
that be,&quot; and teachers had a lot of independence. The whole mindset of<br/>
people living in Alaska is one of independence; we liked that. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, one year a traveling Medieval &quot;fair&quot; was flown in for a<br/>
week-long &quot;unit study&quot; with the schoolchildren AND families. My kids<br/>
(now 23, 21, and 17) still talk about it. The kids studied about and<br/>
then built a castle (this was a big deal!) on the playground; heraldry<br/>
was studied and each family designed and created their own family crest;<br/>
a Medieval banquet was prepared and the kids ate without utensils; the<br/>
music and art of that period was taught; etc. It was one of the most fun<br/>
(and probably most &quot;educational&quot;) weeks my kids ever spent in public<br/>
school. <br/>
<br/>
Hope you and your kids have fun with your study!<br/>

&lt;I don&#39;t remember studying anything medieval in any depth in school...<br/>

Wow! I lived in Adak for 4 years back in the 60&#39;s. It&#39;s not too often that I<br/>
come across someone who has even heard of it much less been there.<br/>
<br/>
A few summers ago, we had a group of homeschoolers meeting at our house<br/>
regularly to do activities like build a castle out of cardboard from<br/>
refrigerator boxes, heraldry, learn to play the recorder, and other things.<br/>
It culminated with a visit from Queen Elizabeth (from a local Renaissance<br/>
fair).<br/>
<br/>
We had a lot of fun. One of the excellent books we used for activity ideas<br/>
was &quot;Days of Knights and Damsels: An Activity Guide&quot; (formerly Huzzah Means<br/>
Hooray). Many of the other books we found useful are described at:<br/>
