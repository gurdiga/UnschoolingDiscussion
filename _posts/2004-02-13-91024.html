Unschooling or Homeschooling? <br/>
<br/>
by Billy Greer <br/>
<br/>
What is the difference between unschooling and homeschooling? At one time <br/>
they were just two terms for the same thing, so the question was like asking what <br/>
the difference is between a car and an automobile. Today, homeschooling has <br/>
remained a generic term while unschooling has come to refer to a specific type <br/>
of homeschooling. So now the question is like asking what the difference is <br/>
between a Ferrari and a car. Just what is it about unschooling that <br/>
differentiates it from other types of homeschooling enough to warrant its own term? <br/>
<br/>
Before we look at that question, let&#39;s look at a history of the words. At one <br/>
time, there was no special term for people who took their children out of the <br/>
public school system to teach them at home. If you look at references to <br/>
education before there even was a public school system, you will see phrases such <br/>
as &quot;tutored at home,&quot; &quot;self-taught,&quot; or &quot;no formal education&quot; to refer to <br/>
people we might now call homeschooled. <br/>
<br/>
Even after the modern homeschooling movement got started, there wasn&#39;t a <br/>
standard term for what these parents were doing. People simply referred to <br/>
teaching their children at home, or not sending them to school. In issue #108 of <br/>
Growing Without Schooling, Susannah Sheffer tells us that the first issue of GWS <br/>
(published in 1977), did not even make use of the term homeschooling. In issue <br/>
#2, John Holt used the term unschooling, but it was used as a general term for <br/>
what we now call homeschooling. In issue #118 of GWS, Aaron Falbel tells us <br/>
that Holt wrote in issue #2 of GWS (Nov. 1977) that they [GWS] would use <br/>
unschooling &quot;when we mean taking kids out of school.&quot; Falbel goes on to say that it <br/>
wasn&#39;t until the early 1980&#39;s that the term homeschooling became more popular. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know when it happened or who first used the phrase, but it is pretty <br/>
easy to see that if most kids went to public school, then people might say <br/>
kids who were taught at home went to &quot;home school.&quot; As the term has become more <br/>
an accepted part of our vocabulary, it has moved from the novelty phrase &quot;home <br/>
schooling&quot; (in quotes) to home schooling (no quotes), to home-schooling <br/>
(hyphenated), and now homeschooling (one word). <br/>
<br/>
John Holt is considered the father of unschooling and the person who coined <br/>
the term. In Holt&#39;s early writings, he seemed to hold out hope that the school <br/>
system could be fixed, but he later became more convinced that parents were <br/>
better off taking their kids out of schools. I imagine that it then seemed <br/>
natural to him to refer to the process of not sending your kids to school as <br/>
unschooling, as in not schooling. <br/>
<br/>
While the terms may have been interchangeable originally, that is no longer <br/>
the case today. Unschooling has become associated with the particular style of <br/>
homeschooling in which no set curriculum is used. Where the split originated <br/>
is hard to say, but part of the reason for the division is probably because of <br/>
the words themselves. Homeschooling carries an implication of <br/>
schooling-at-home, while unschooling connotes that what you are doing is the opposite of <br/>
school. People who accepted the teaching techniques of school but wanted more <br/>
control over the subject matter, socialization, or morals that their children were <br/>
exposed to might readily accept the term homeschooling. People who disliked <br/>
the teaching techniques and environment of school might be more inclined to use <br/>
the term unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, homeschooling is considered to span a spectrum from those who <br/>
school-at-home to those who unschool. The school-at home designation is <br/>
self-explanatory. This group revels in all the trappings of school! They may have the <br/>
same desks used in the public schools, some of the same text books, and they may <br/>
even start each day by ringing a bell and saying the pledge of allegiance. <br/>
The parent assumes the role of teacher, preparing lesson plans, assigning <br/>
homework or tests, and grading papers. Their &quot;holy grail&quot; is the search for the <br/>
perfect curriculum, the one that will cover everything their children need to <br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
What is it that unschoolers do? Where do you find a curriculum package that <br/>
will help you to be an unschooler? The reason that unschooling is hard to <br/>
explain and hard for some people to understand, is that it is not a technique that <br/>
can be broken down to a step by step process. Rather, unschooling is an <br/>
attitude, a way of life. Where most homeschooling puts the emphasis on what needs to <br/>
be learned, unschooling puts the emphasis on who is doing the learning. This <br/>
makes it a very personalized experience and one that does not lend itself well <br/>
to the one size-fits-all approach of a commercial curriculum package. <br/>
<br/>
What are some of the unintended lessons of a &quot;school&quot; approach to learning? <br/>
First of all, the student is taught that learning is something that takes place <br/>
in a certain location at certain times. From 8 to 3 you do lessons at your <br/>
desk. Learning is also unpleasant and often boring, so it is usually a relief <br/>
when &quot;school&quot; is finally out. Students become used to the idea that learning <br/>
requires a teacher - someone more knowledgeable than them. This follows the old <br/>
model of learning in which students are empty cups waiting to be filled and the <br/>
teacher is the pitcher full of knowledge that will fill them. This also <br/>
emphasizes the idea that students must be taught - in other words, what happens to <br/>
you (learning) is the result of what someone else does to you (teaching). <br/>
School also reinforces the idea that learning is a linear process. You work and <br/>
add knowledge incrementally over time in a steady process. To get from point A <br/>
to point C, you must first pass point B. <br/>
<br/>
In unschooling, learning can happen anywhere and at anytime. It is an <br/>
ongoing, natural process - part of the journey we call life. It is not unpleasant or <br/>
boring anymore than breathing, eating or sleeping are. There is no sense of <br/>
relief that school is out because learning is always happening. Students also <br/>
know that they are responsible for their learning. They do not need an &quot;expert&quot; <br/>
to teach them. If they have an interest, they can go out and pursue the <br/>
knowledge they need. This is another fundamental difference between a schoolish <br/>
approach and an unschooling model. School is a case of knowledge (that someone <br/>
else has determined to be important) in pursuit of the student, while unschooling <br/>
puts the student in pursuit of the knowledge (which they have decided is <br/>
important). In this role, parents are not teachers who always know more than their <br/>
children, they are often fellow learners making the journey along with their <br/>
children. (See the side bar for more comments about the non-linear learning of <br/>
unschooling.) <br/>
<br/>
It is unfortunate that the older term &quot;unschooled&quot; often means uneducated. As <br/>
unschooling gains acceptance and its effectiveness is recognized, the <br/>
dictionaries will have to be corrected to reflect the positive aspects of someone who <br/>
has been educated by unschooling.    <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
School is a case of knowledge (that someone else has determined to be <br/>
important) chasing after the student, while unschooling puts the student chasing <br/>
after the knowledge (that they have decided is important)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have you noticed that unschooling doesn&#39;t result in a steady increase in <br/>
learning? You&#39;ll have periods where it seems like nothing is happening. You may <br/>
find yourself wondering if your kids are learning anything or if they ever will. <br/>
Suddenly, something will click and your kids immerse themselves in a subject. <br/>
You can barely drag them away from what they are doing or keep up with the <br/>
questions they have. <br/>
<br/>
In pursuing this new interest with them, you will discover they know about <br/>
many things that they seem to have just absorbed out of the air they breathe. <br/>
<br/>
In retrospect, those periods where nothing seemed to be happening were <br/>
probably laying the foundation for that sudden &quot;knowledge spurt.&quot; There are <br/>
similarities with physical growth that suggest this is a natural pattern. Studies have <br/>
shown that infants do not grow steadily. They may stay exactly the same size <br/>
for weeks, then suddenly grow as much as an inch in only a few days. This is <br/>
very different from the steady, gradual pattern that growth charts might lead <br/>
you to expect. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where most homeschooling puts the emphasis on what needs to be learned, <br/>
unschooling puts the emphasis on who is doing the learning.<br/>

Billy Greer and his wife are big names around here. They live in the county just north of mine. I understand they&#39;re just incredibly thoughtful, interesting, warm people. They have lots of good things to say, and they&#39;re website is well worth exploring. I was excited to see that he was going to be a vendor (?) at the Live and Learn Conference.<br/>

Thank you, I have already forwarded this to my DH and my MIL, <br/>
neither of whom have expressed a dislike of unschooling, they just <br/>
don&#39;t really understand what exactly it is.  Hopefully, this will <br/>
help.<br/>
