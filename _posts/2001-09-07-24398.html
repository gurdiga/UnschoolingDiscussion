 </span></blockquote>How wonderful to hear about unschooling that has worked for 12 years.  I hope <br/>
I can keep going that long.... Here I am on day 3.... I was going to send Zak <br/>
today for his last day and he didn&#39;t want to go.  He said he would miss me <br/>
too much and he wanted to play with Max and come grocery shopping with us so <br/>
that he could be a detective and find the prices of everything..... So that&#39;s <br/>
what we did instead.  He&#39;s now watching a Barney and Santa Video (I can&#39;t <br/>
understand a 6 year old watching that, but he rented if from the video store <br/>
and has watched it over and over again)...  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s good not to suggest to kids that something is too old or too young for <br/>
them.  Try not to even suggest it with hesitation or tone of voice, if you <br/>
can help it.  Too much damage has been done already in the name of &quot;age <br/>
appropriateness.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If a six year old wants to play Master Mind and then wants to play Candyland <br/>
right after that and then chess, why not??  To criticize their choices will <br/>
just make them self-conscious and defensive, and IF something is really no <br/>
longer feeding their mind or soul they&#39;ll quit on their own.  <br/>

Holly loves Dragontales.  It&#39;s aimed at pre-schoolers, but she enjoys it.  <br/>
She watches Teletubbies sometimes.  I try never to criticize their choices.  <br/>
I have made involuntary &quot;gack&quot; noises at some of the blind date/dating game <br/>
kinds of things Marty watches sometimes, but I always say &quot;Sorry&quot; and scoot <br/>
out and let him watch them.  They won&#39;t kill him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wyndham like Dragontales.  But I draw the line at Teletubbies.  Not<br/>
because I think it is mindlass but because we are a family and no-one has<br/>
total control of the TV.  If I am in the room, I get veto rights on<br/>
anything I don&#39;t want to watch.  They can pick there second choice and<br/>
that&#39;s called compromise.  We do that with movies sometimes too.  It has<br/>
less to do with not wanting them to something as with not wanting to sit<br/>
through it myself.<br/>
