<br/>
To me, your life sounds wonderful.  I think I am a &quot;rambler&quot; at heart.  My <br/>
dream would be to just live on the road, traveling with my family, in a huge <br/>
motor home.  Seeing the world and just LIVING in it.  sigh.. Oh well, welcome <br/>
back,  the list may be a little mellow right now , but its been pretty heated <br/>
at times as well.   Looking forward to getting to know you better<br/>
