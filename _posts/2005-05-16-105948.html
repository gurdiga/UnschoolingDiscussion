<div id="ygrps-yiv-334276179">This is my response to an e-mail from someone not on the list, but I&#39;ve <br/>
invited that write to come and see other responses.  What am I missing?  What might <br/>
I have stated too strongly?  The kids are younger than ten, older then four, <br/>
and I&#39;m trying to maintain anonymity so if you know who it is, don&#39;t out the <br/>
family.<br/>
==========================================================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Since de-ruling, [older of two, a boy] has had periods of literally 8, 10 <br/>
hours a day of<br/>
watching tv, animated cartoons almost exclusively. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s directly because of the rules.<br/>
And don&#39;t think of it as &quot;de-ruling,&quot; think of it as giving him choices and <br/>
freedom.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He did comment that he learns some useful information from watching<br/>
tv, and I agreed that this was true, but I was concerned about the amount he<br/>
was watching. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you not only miss controlling his TV access, but that you <br/>
felt/feel you have some control over what he&#39;s learning.<br/>
<br/>
Why were you reading for two hours before?  I&#39;m guessing it was for the joy <br/>
of stories and information.   <br/>
<br/>
 When you say &quot;TV&quot; does that include DVD/videos?<br/>
<br/>
-=- He has also invited me to watch with him, which I do some but<br/>
not all of the time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When you say &quot;he has invited me,&quot; it strikes me that you&#39;re never inviting <br/>
him.  It&#39;s not a shared activity, it&#39;s his and you resent it.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I feel like [he] may be to some<br/>
extent wondering if he can really trust us this time-=-<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s right.  If he TOTALLY doesn&#39;t believe he can trust that this is not <br/>
temporary, he&#39;s exactly right.  You haven&#39;t relaxed about it, you and your husband <br/>
have discussed pulling the rug out from under him and you&#39;ve written to me.  <br/>
You shouldn&#39;t &quot;feel like&quot; &quot;to some extent&quot; he&#39;s wondering, you should KNOW he <br/>
knows he&#39;s in a flimsy situation and he wants to watch all the TV he can <br/>
before you revoke the temporary offer.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Have you heard<br/>
of similar situations with a &quot;de-ruling&quot; period?  How long might this last?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard of a situation where strict rules were relaxed and the kid <br/>
did NOT binge.<br/>
<br/>
-=I have posed this situation to several unschooling friends of mine, and they<br/>
all basically said let the tv go, and until they really believe I won&#39;t<br/>
bring restrictions back, they are going to be watching a lot. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You already had the answer, then.<br/>
<br/>
There are places you could ask these questions so that the answers would <br/>
benefit LOTS of people and so that you would get ore than one person&#39;s response.  <br/>
And if you were already hooked into a big discussion list or message board, <br/>
you might&#39;ve seen other discussions that would have been helpful to you.<br/>
<br/>
There are some lists listed here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/other">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other</a><br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling Basics might be your best bet.  I&#39;m not on that, but I hear <br/>
good things about it.  The main folks there are Kelly Lovejoy, Ren Allen and Deb <br/>
Lewis, I think.<br/>
<br/>
there is a message board here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.info/forum">http://unschooling.info/forum</a><br/>
<br/>
Here are collections of writings on TV:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tv">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a><br/>
<br/>
and some on books, as I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re comparing books pretty directly to <br/>
TV:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/books">http://sandradodd.com/books</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m coercing them to turn<br/>
it off, and [this kid] especially seems to do it sometimes out of deference to<br/>
my wishes instead of him wanting to do it for himself.  I have tried to talk<br/>
to him about this as well, that he needs to make tv choices based on what he<br/>
feels is right for him.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re talking too much about it, and thinking too much about it, and <br/>
worrying too much about it.  You&#39;re resisting life instead of going WITH it.<br/>
<br/>
It seems you ARE coercing him, with guilt and wistful sighs about the way it <br/>
was before.  You&#39;re damaging your relationship with him, I&#39;m guessing, by <br/>
doing that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have told both of them how much I love them, wanted to have them, want to<br/>
spend time with them, etc.  Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m coercing them. . .-=-<br/>
<br/>
It does sound like a confession of pressure and shaming.<br/>
<br/>
-=- So, part of<br/>
my being at a loss is wondering how much to say about the tv, trying to get<br/>
them away from it, how I&#39;m concerned about the amount they&#39;re watching, etc.-<br/>
=-<br/>
<br/>
I think you should say NOTHING negative.<br/>
You created the situation, and you all need to live through the aftermath, <br/>
not have more &quot;situation&quot; put upon them.<br/>
<br/>
If you want them to trust you about more important things in the future, you <br/>
need to be more trustworthy in this situation.  <br/>
<br/>
And what else is going on in your lives?  When&#39;s the last time you went to <br/>
the children&#39;s museum, the zoo, miniature golf, a hike with a picnic?   Don&#39;t do <br/>
those things just to get the TV turned off, though.  Do them because they <br/>
make life richer and happier.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you have a good VCR or TIVO or a way to record their favorite shows so <br/>
they won&#39;t mind being gone?    Maybe they have a genetically-gained need to <br/>
control, and the ability to record up some good stuff would keep them from wanting <br/>
to watch as much as they could, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to take this to UnschoolingDiscussion (I won&#39;t use your names) and <br/>
ask for more comments.  They  might think I&#39;ve already covered it, or there <br/>
might be more discussion.  If you want to join for a while to see what might be <br/>
said, email here:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-99351043">-=-=-=- Since de-ruling, [older of two, a boy] has had periods of <br/>
literally 8, 10 and Thours a day of watching tv, animated cartoons <br/>
almost exclusively. -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Duncan (9) will do this too. Wakes up and turns the tv on. It&#39;s on <br/>
until he goes to sleep. Cartoon Network almost exclusively. And <br/>
whatever channel Family Guy and The Simpsons is on. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 Other days it&#39;s never turned on.<br/>
<br/>
My standard reply to this concern is to *make* the child watch a <br/>
minimum of 12 hours/day! &lt;g&gt; That&#39;s a joke, son! But it&#39;s amazing how <br/>
uninteresting something can become if you&#39;re forced to participate!<br/>
<br/>
Duncan&#39;s been restless lately. Asking to do something *new*. Tired and <br/>
bored with tv.<br/>
<br/>
Brought me a book today---we read for hours---until I went to sleep. I <br/>
can read silently until 3-4:00am, but make me read aloud, and I&#39;m <br/>
asleep immediately. Damn, maybe I should do that when I&#39;m suffering <br/>
from insomia!<br/>
<br/>
-=-He did comment that he learns some useful information from watching <br/>
tv, and I agreed that this was true, but I was concerned about the <br/>
amount he was watching. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This is Ben&#39;s problem as well. He would rather that Duncan be outside. <br/>
Ben was (and is) an outdoor kind of kid. Duncan&#39;s not a jock, but does <br/>
spend a lot of tme in the pool and on the trampoline. He doesn&#39;t play <br/>
any organized sports---I think *that&#39;s* what bothers Ben.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to see that he learns a lot from tv--he blows us away all the <br/>
time with things he got from tv. His vocabulary is huge<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- He has also invited me to watch with him, which I do some but not <br/>
all of the time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I understand. I can handle only so much of Inuyasha per day! &lt;g&gt; Even <br/>
Scooby-Doo gets old after a marathon! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And we have TiVo, so we can watch things over and over and over and <br/>
over! &lt;g&gt; But the TiVo is located in the den, so I get to watch too! <br/>
Not always my idea of a good time.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I feel like [he] may be to some extent wondering if he can really <br/>
trust us this time-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, you&#39;re probably right, here! That trust thang is really delicate. <br/>
You have to really let go of the controls and truly trust.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s NOT easy. And each time you backslide, you&#39;ve weakened that link.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Have you heard of similar situations with a &quot;de-ruling&quot; period?  How <br/>
long might this last?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, the rule of thumb with deschooling is one month for each year of <br/>
school or school-at-home. And you have to start counting from the <br/>
beginning again whenever you backslide.<br/>
<br/>
-=I have posed this situation to several unschooling friends of mine, <br/>
and they all basically said let the tv go, and until they really <br/>
believe I won&#39;t bring restrictions back, they are going to be watching <br/>
a lot. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Uh huh. Same for anything that was restricted. But TV is especially <br/>
hard because of programs like &quot;No TV Week&quot; and bumper stickers that <br/>
say, &quot;Kill your TV.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are even commercials on Cartoon Network that tell kids to turn <br/>
off the tv and go outside. That&#39;s pretty pathetic! Even the *TV* sends <br/>
the message that tv is bad!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m coercing them to turn it off, and [this <br/>
kid] especially seems to do it sometimes out of deference to my wishes <br/>
instead of him wanting to do it for himself.  I have tried to talkto <br/>
him about this as well, that he needs to make tv choices based on what <br/>
he feels is right for him.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Duncan will turn the tv off for me when I just can&#39;t stand it any <br/>
more---and ask whether he can watch in the den when I&#39;m working in <br/>
there. He&#39;s OK with whatever my answer is because I&#39;m OK with *his* <br/>
answers! But he has a tv in his room and can go in there when I&#39;m tv <br/>
toast.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s deference---but it&#39;s mutual!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have told both of them how much I love them, wanted to have them, <br/>
want to spend time with them, etc.  Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m coercing <br/>
them. . .-=-<br/>
<br/>
To me it&#39;s not so much about TELLING them how much...... It&#39;s about <br/>
*SHOWING* them that.<br/>
<br/>
That can mean accepting that the tv is important right now.<br/>
<br/>
And doing cool things yourself---SHOW them what interests you. Garden, <br/>
train the dog, knit, make furniture---find something that you&#39;re <br/>
passionate about. You really have to model the behavior you&#39;d like to <br/>
see in them. If you spend you free time in the evenings watching tv,... <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=- So, part of my being at a loss is wondering how much to say about <br/>
the tv, trying to get them away from it, how I&#39;m concerned about the <br/>
amount they&#39;re watching, etc.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Say NOTHING. Support them (with snacks and drinks and getting involved <br/>
in the programming) when they are watching, and &quot;pretend&quot; that they <br/>
aren&#39;t watching enough! &lt;g&gt; Seriously---if they&#39;re not watching 12 <br/>
hours, it&#39;s not enough. If you change your *own* thinking about this <br/>
(just like unschooling and &quot;academics&quot;), you&#39;ll be less likely to see <br/>
it as &quot;enough&quot; or bad.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
From Sandra:<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a good VCR or TIVO or a way to record their favorite shows <br/>
so they won&#39;t mind being gone?    Maybe they have a genetically-gained <br/>
need to control, and the ability to record up some good stuff would <br/>
keep them from wanting to watch as much as they could, too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
TiVo is really handy. Duncan often seemed tired because he *really* <br/>
wanted to stay up and watch Adult Swim. Ben won the TiVo machine and <br/>
one year&#39;s subscription through work. We probably wouldn&#39;t have gotten <br/>
it otherwise (we&#39;re techo-challenged).  Duncan loves it. He can record <br/>
all his favorite shows in a season pass---and he can watch it when he <br/>
wakes up. He can do *whatever* and know that he won&#39;t miss anything <br/>
important to him.<br/>
<br/>
And I can score The West Wing on dog obedience night! &lt;g&gt; Duncan would <br/>
rather eat glass than watch The West Wing---but understands that *I* <br/>
like it! &lt;g&gt; I try to do the same for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083004486"><blockquote><span title="qreply">--- In <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>
==&gt; This is my response to an e-mail from someone not on the list, but<br/>
I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; invited that write to come and see other responses.  What am I<br/>
missing? ==<br/>
<br/>
From my own experience -- my nearly 8-yr.-old son has the TV on most<br/>
days, pretty much all day (and I&#39;m fine with that).  It&#39;s been this<br/>
way for over a year and a half.  So that might happen with her child,<br/>
too, no matter how much she loosens up and trusts her child&#39;s learning.  <br/>
<br/>
I mention this because when I first started reading on this list, I<br/>
got the impression that the TV watching would decrease over time, if I<br/>
relaxed about it and was available and offered other fun things that I<br/>
was honestly excited about.  I still do that and think that&#39;s all good<br/>
advice, but I think it&#39;s worth knowing that for some kids, the TV<br/>
viewing may not decrease, and that&#39;s okay, too.  <br/>
<br/>
In my son&#39;s case, he is most comfortable at home, and he likes to<br/>
watch TV while doing other things -- pretend games, build forts and<br/>
lifeboats with the sofa cushions, play GameBoy or computer games, jump<br/>
around.  So I do things near him, and have the living room set up so<br/>
that I can read or check email or fold laundry or whatever while I&#39;m<br/>
near him -- not necessarily watching the show all the time, but<br/>
watching him and hearing his thoughts during the commercials and<br/>
playing bits of pretend here and there.<br/>
<br/>
It has taken a while to get used to the nearly constant presence of<br/>
the TV, but now I just know that it means my son is at home, right<br/>
where he wants to be. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

personality (as in the Elaine Aron definition of sensitive), and it<br/>
can be stressful for him, at this tender age, to go out into the world<br/>
very often, even into what others would see as pretty friendly<br/>
situations.  So the TV is his way of letting the world come to him. <br/>
That&#39;s why I respect his TV viewing so much -- through it, he can<br/>
learn about the world on his terms.<br/>
<br/>
So this mother may want to look at the sensitivity of the child that&#39;s<br/>
watching a lot of TV right now.  It sounds like it&#39;s too early to tell<br/>
whether it&#39;s just normal post-rule bingeing or something else.  But<br/>
either way it&#39;s to be respected and learned from.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I have to ask, given that now the weather is better and daylight is longer, what Mom and the other child are doing while this boy watches TV for 8 - 10 hours.  Are there any other activities going on?  games, outside play, walks, picnics, bike-riding?  Has Mom suggested any, or is she waiting for the child to request it?  <br/>
<br/>
I sometimes find myself worrying about the amount of TV our boys watch during the colder, darker months when we don&#39;t get out every day, but I&#39;ve come to think of it as a seasonal thing.  Now that warmer days are here, we&#39;re generally out of the house (almost exclusively outdoors at that) 7 - 10 hours a day, 3 or 4 days a week.  <br/>
<br/>
Engage him in something together.  I also liked your comment that by not inviting him to watch TV with her, she&#39;s made it his activity alone, not something to be shared.<br/>
<br/>
gotta go -- Dan wants to play.<br/>

It is hard to &quot;strew yourself&quot; and say hey, I&#39;m available, want to play <br/>
and hear &quot;no, I&#39;d rather watch tv.&quot; But if you&#39;re letting them choose <br/>
what to do, that&#39;s going to happen sometimes. Smile, nod and vent about <br/>
it out of their hearing! If you&#39;re frustrated about having to stay home <br/>
with them, make an effort to get out on weekends or whenever you have <br/>
someone else they can stay with. See if there&#39;s a way you can find joy <br/>
in their choices. Does it make you happy that they are free to choose? <br/>
Can you now do something you want to do like learn to play an <br/>
instrument or read books or garden or exercise? Or just sit still? (I <br/>
have 3 kids under 5, so I&#39;m seeing lots of joy in the theoretical idea <br/>
of having a little time to oneself. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest not looking at how many months they may deschool for, <br/>
or any other measure of how &quot;well&quot; they are unschooling. If you need to <br/>
look for progress--and that&#39;s a big if--look for it in yourself. With <br/>
tv, you&#39;ve stopped turning it off, but still are wanting to control it. <br/>
I did the same with food: said yes always to candy and they just kept <br/>
eating. Wondered if I really could have candy in the house without it <br/>
all getting sucked down in a day. Finally I realized I&#39;d skipped a step-<br/>
-despite having read about it 1000 times. I wasn&#39;t leaving the candy <br/>
where they could reach it. I was getting it for them, but that involved <br/>
sighing, offering them other foods or making them wait a minute til I <br/>
finished whatever I was doing, blah blah blah. Then they figured out <br/>
they could drag a chair over and get it themselves and within a week <br/>
they were eating less candy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s even better if you don&#39;t look anywhere for &quot;progress&quot; but try to <br/>
live in the moment and enjoy yourself. I&#39;m still working on that...<br/>

Don&#39;t do that!  That&#39;s what flying monkeys did to the scarecrow in  Wizard of <br/>
Oz, didn&#39;t they?  They strewed him all OVER the place.<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t strew yourself. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a useful concept for discussing unschooling, but it&#39;s not a made up  <br/>
word. We can use it well.  It means to spread or scatter.  I&#39;m  scattered enough <br/>
mentally without strewing myself over otherwise.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
It is better, but most people want something cling to, something like  <br/>
evidence or proof, and so deschooling and &quot;timers&quot; (in the form of not getting  <br/>
schooly until a after a certain time has passed, after which time we all hope  the <br/>
urge to get schooly will have passed) are helpful to new and potential  <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
 <br/>
Not everyone who starts deschooling can finish. <br/>
Not everyone who goes to LLL nurses very long.<br/>
Not everyone who goes to an AA meeting quits drinking.<br/>
Not everyone who goes to Weight Watchers loses weight.<br/>
Not everyone who buys a piano learns to play it.<br/>
 <br/>
This is not an easy thing we&#39;re doing.  It&#39;s not easy to do and not  easy to <br/>
explain.  I was reading The Old Schoolhouse (conservative Christian  <br/>
homeschooling magazine) and THAT is something easy (in the way of needing little  <br/>
explanation or difficulty of understanding).  You buy a curriculum because  God <br/>
wants you to (writing a check or using a charge card is easy), and then you  do <br/>
lessons if it&#39;s a school day, and you don&#39;t if it&#39;s not.  No messy  thinking <br/>
required. <br/>
 <br/>
But wait!  Someone&#39;s suggesting unit studies.  That would be a  little more <br/>
work for the parents (though they can buy &quot;units&quot;) but it says  &quot;Through the <br/>
unit style approach, more education can be accomplished in less  time.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
How much less time should we dedicate to our kids?<br/>
How much more learning can there be than all they take in living a busy  life?<br/>
(Oh wait.  He said &quot;education,&quot; that thing others do when they try to  insert <br/>
facts and ideas into other people.  Never mind.  I don&#39;t have  time to do <br/>
that, nor the heart to do that in the way &quot;educators&quot; usually  mean.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014027168">&quot;more input on TV question, please&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Letting go of control of your tv is hard.  EVERYONE says you should <br/>
control how much your child watches.  Especially homeschoolers and <br/>
even a lot of unschoolers.  I have noticed through the years that the <br/>
kids that have limited or no tv aren&#39;t any nicer, aren&#39;t better <br/>
behaved, aren&#39;t less violent and have even taught my boys words <br/>
they&#39;ve never heard before.  I joke that if my kids taught others new <br/>
words I could blame the tv, who do they have to blame? tee hee.   <br/>
<br/>
These kids are probably acting out because they have no control of <br/>
anything going on in their lives.  I&#39;ve had parents with younger <br/>
children ask me advice on discipline problems.  I honestly haven&#39;t had <br/>
to deal with half the problems they have.   And I get nothing but <br/>
compliments on my teenager.  It&#39;s SO awesome since I had to deal with <br/>
so much criticism for years on most of my parenting choices.<br/>
<br/>

Do you  have a good VCR or TIVO or a way to record their favorite shows so <br/>
they  won&#39;t mind being gone?    Maybe they have a genetically-gained need  to <br/>
control, and the ability to record up some good stuff would keep them  from <br/>
wanting <br/>
to watch as much as they could,  too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One thing you might consider is if it is a show that is a documentary or  <br/>
historical, if you record several episodes on 1 tape.  Than, spend a day  <br/>
watching the entire tape&#39;s worth and make a party of it.  This is what I  did when we <br/>
had a tv.  We now do not have a tv, by our own personal choice,  and we do <br/>
watch videos/dvds over our computer.  I think communication with  the kids is <br/>
the key and once more options are explored, opportunities become  unlimited and <br/>
the unschooling lifestyle becomes more of an adventure for the  entire family <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-446107879">Sandra once upon a time wrote that life is about priorities.  I can&#39;t<br/>
remember what it was in reference to, maybe somebody worrying about<br/>
McDonalds and not allowing her/his child(ren) to support a<br/>
multi-national conglomerate being more important than supporting<br/>
her/his families ability to make choices.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that with all of these things it is about priorities.  If your<br/>
priority is no or little television than allowing freedom of access to<br/>
television isn&#39;t going to result in no or little television.  My son<br/>
Simon (8), who has had freedom of access to television since he was 5<br/>
and for whom we controlled it very little before that can and does<br/>
watch television for hours.  However, of late, he has been turning it<br/>
off and walking away from it far more than ever before.  If someone<br/>
were to walk into our home who believed that television was a<br/>
corrupting influence we are clearly corrupted. <br/>
<br/>
There is free access to food in our house.  There are two bowlfuls of<br/>
starburst fruit chews on the kitchen table and carrots and celery cut<br/>
up and floating in water in the fridge as per my Grandmother; there<br/>
are packets of crisps in the cupboard with weetabix cereal and muesli<br/>
cereal and whatever other kind of cereal; there is dried squid and<br/>
sheets of nori and crackers and peanut butter and chocolate chip<br/>
oatmeal cookies and ice cream and, and, and  All things get eaten. <br/>
At the moment Linnaea (5) and Simon are sitting in front of the<br/>
television watching a video of The Flintstones eating spaghetti<br/>
noodles and raw carrots and drinking kool-aid (imported) and talking<br/>
to me about what &quot;balance&quot; means, based I would guess on the balance<br/>
of a sword in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;.  If your priority is not<br/>
letting your children have certain &quot;e numbers&quot; in food or to be<br/>
vegetarian or vegan or to eat only things without additives, than<br/>
allowing food choice isn&#39;t necessarily going to end up with a family<br/>
that eats the way you want them to eat.  It might, but it probably<br/>
won&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
If you choose to follow the unschooling lifestyle, as opposed to just<br/>
being an unschooling homeschooler, than you have to accept that these<br/>
people who are your children will enjoy things in ways you may not<br/>
like.  Yesterday Simon ate 3 doughnuts.  He had a couple of bites of<br/>
egg fried rice and a couple of bites of bagel with cream cheese, but<br/>
really, he only ate 3 doughnuts.  It drove me mad.  But David<br/>
(husband) said sometimes you only want three doughnuts.  Tomorrow<br/>
he&#39;ll eat other things.  Do you think he is going to starve himself? <br/>
And he was right.  Today he is eating other things and yesterday he<br/>
only wanted 3 doughnuts.  And the coercion I attempted was<br/>
short-sighted and mean.  <br/>
<br/>
If your priority is perfectly behaved children who read at an early<br/>
age and who impress your friends and family with their knowledge and<br/>
deportment, you may find unschooling a hard path to follow (not that<br/>
any other method will necessarily get you these things).  If your<br/>
priority is to respect your children as people and to help them to<br/>
explore the world in an engaging way than it is also important to<br/>
understand that as romantic as these things sound it is hard and on<br/>
bad days it is easy to note that they only ate 3 doughnuts or that<br/>
every time you go to the store they have to buy something or that they<br/>
are watching loads of television.  It all depends on your priorities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-510121088">My son has become interested in the reality TV shows with Nannies.  <br/>
Mostly we&#39;ve been watching Nanny 911.<br/>
<br/>
What strikes me about that show is that it seems so wrong to make kids <br/>
that are only two or four (or six) go to bed alone and wailing.  <br/>
Although the nannies aren&#39;t as extreme as Ferber, as they encourage the <br/>
parents to sit in the room (silently), they do condemn cosleeping and <br/>
praise nighttime self-sufficiency.  I don&#39;t like seeing my son convinced <br/>
that this method &quot;works&quot;, as I prefer for kids to be cuddled and <br/>
comforted and attached.  (I certainly hope that my son raises my <br/>
grandchildren with cuddling and without wailing.  I don&#39;t want him <br/>
swallowing the &quot;expertise&quot; of the nannies.)<br/>
<br/>
I did find myself expressing this opinion quite a bit during the first <br/>
two shows.  Then I checked with my son whether I was annoying him (yes), <br/>
and decided that he&#39;s heard my main points and now I should pipe down as <br/>
much as I can manage.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have been out of the mainstream so long that I was dismayed to <br/>
see these kind of &quot;bedtimes&quot;, but as foreign as they are to me, I think <br/>
they are the norm in this culture.  My kid has only slept 9 and 1/2 <br/>
hours since he was about 2, so putting him to bed early &quot;because he <br/>
needs it&quot;, never made any kind of sense.  And I was never ok with the <br/>
idea of him crying himself to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m just re-acquainting myself with the idea that there can be a <br/>
communications gap when we discuss parenting theory online.  (Describing <br/>
&quot;practices&quot; is less abstract and more clear, usually.)  When I write or <br/>
read the word &quot;bedtime&quot;, I&#39;m thinking about a pleasant attachment <br/>
parenting family in which the scenario is &quot;Let&#39;s all brush our teeth and <br/>
have a story and go to bed.&quot;  I don&#39;t naturally picture toddlers in <br/>
distress being sent back to their rooms over and over.  But that is what <br/>
bedtime means in many households.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra wrote (message boards?) about how going to school breaks bonds <br/>
between parents and children.   That&#39;s certainly true.  But I think <br/>
following a practice of ignoring a child&#39;s cries breaks the habit of <br/>
hearing and respecting a child&#39;s feelings at an even earlier age.  (OK, <br/>
yeah, some people never had the habit.)  If a parent is non-responsive <br/>
to a child&#39;s cries at an early age, how sensitive can they possibly be <br/>
at later ages to a child&#39;s needs, wishes, dreams and fears?  And does <br/>
the child also become less sensitive to perceiving his own needs -- <br/>
particularly his unpopular and inconvenient needs?<br/>

always feel sad for the kids who have to go to bed without cuddling<br/>
and comforting, so  I&#39;m not worried about them thinking that the<br/>
nannies know best.  When they say something about it, I say something<br/>
like, &quot;a lot of parents do things differently than we do, but our<br/>
family likes to cuddle together at bedtime so that&#39;s why we do it this<br/>
way,&quot; and then they usually say something like, &quot;It&#39;s too bad for them<br/>
that their family doesn&#39;t like cuddling.&quot; :)<br/>

Have you asked him about what he finds interesting about the show?<br/>
What his take is on how bedtime issues are handled in the show?<br/>
Expressed nonjudgmental curiosity about his opinion on the bedtime<br/>
thing? (Versus &quot;expressing my opinion quite a bit&quot;, which sounds like<br/>
lecturing.) That is, open up a discussion. His perspective is sure to<br/>
be thought-provoking. Let us know -- I&#39;m curious myself.<br/>
