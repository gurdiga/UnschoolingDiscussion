<div id="ygrps-yiv-543888086">&lt;&lt; although there is respect for the child it is believed when a child is<br/>
<br/>
left alone s/he will take the easy way &gt;&gt;  (snip from susan&#39;s mason comments)<br/>
<br/>
this phrase captures the fear that is so prevalent, even in most of us.  i <br/>
think it is because we tried to take the easy way out IN SCHOOL and forget to <br/>
not compare our potential unschool experiences with school experiences, but <br/>
instead compare them with times when we learned on our own.   it also helps <br/>
me to remember the next snip (from the product description) &lt;&lt;We learn <br/>
without curricula before we reach school age and after we graduate, so what&#39;s <br/>
the big deal?&gt;&gt; because it makes us really think about our goals for these <br/>
years of our childrens lives!  and therefore, for me, makes more clear that <br/>
even if i choose to school rather than unschool my child, at least i am aware <br/>
that i am making that choice.<br/>
