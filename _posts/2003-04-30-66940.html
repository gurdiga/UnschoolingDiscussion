<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122205842">Okay, let&#39;s talk about this.<br/>
<br/>
I had two years of piano, from age 14 to 16. This is where I learned <br/>
how to read music and do scales. I NEVER practiced during this time. <br/>
Well, I didn&#39;t practice my scales or things like that. But I <br/>
memorized, and made it completely and fully my own, the opening <br/>
measures of Mozart&#39;s Piano Sonata(?) in Cmaj. because I LIKED IT. It <br/>
was INTERESTING TO ME and I WANTED TO LEARN IT. So, I practiced THAT <br/>
every single solitary day.<br/>
<br/>
Then, I went through a 10 year period where I was hardly ever near a <br/>
piano. Finally settled down, and we moved my piano from my mom&#39;s <br/>
house to my newly established, married household. I bought a book of <br/>
piano classics. One of the pieces in that music book was &quot;Maple Leaf <br/>
Rag&quot; a VERY complex work, with rapid chord changes and a ragtime <br/>
rhythm. I taught myself to play the first movement. How? My, was I <br/>
focused! L My poor family must have gone nuts, as I practiced the <br/>
same chords over and over and over and over for hours. Literally.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we moved. It would have cost more to move that old piano than <br/>
it was worth, so we sold it. Another ten years passed. And just a <br/>
year or so ago, we bought a Clavinova. I LOVE IT. It came with a book <br/>
of songs, and one of those was!!! Maple Leaf Rag! LOL I sat down with <br/>
that music and in five minutes, was playing that first movement as if <br/>
I&#39;d never gone away from it. It just took looking again at the music, <br/>
and putting my fingers in their proper places...and they flew.<br/>
<br/>
I now have the whole piece down pat, and have memorized the first two <br/>
movements. it is so much fun to play, but getting it down meant hours <br/>
and hours of practice. Drove the poor fam nuts, again. <br/>
<br/>
But now that I &quot;own&quot; that song...I haven&#39;t sat down to the piano <br/>
again with such intense focus.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;d like to say was happening is this: when I was interested in <br/>
learning it, the knowledge soaked in like a sponge. I tend to focus <br/>
on one thing at a time, so the intensity of learning a complex piece <br/>
of music isn&#39;t something I can do every day, or want to do every day. <br/>
When I&#39;d gotten Maple Leaf Rag down, I walked away. <br/>
<br/>
Your son is most likely doing the same thing: getting lots and lots <br/>
of info into his brain and his fingers during times of &quot;soaking it <br/>
up&quot; i.e. high interest in the project. When he isn&#39;t interested, his <br/>
brain isn&#39;t &quot;on&quot; so he doesn&#39;t as readily soak it up. <br/>
<br/>
Does that make sense? If someone had told me &quot;Learn this song&quot; I&#39;d <br/>
NEVER have done it. Because of picking it up on my own, out of <br/>
intense interest and desire to conquer it, it came to me. It&#39;s like <br/>
having the desire and the interest opens up the brain to taking in <br/>
the thing you&#39;re learning. <br/>
<br/>
But it still took HOURS. I&#39;m an adult. Kids are quicker. Promise. <br/>
Myelin sheathing on the brain cells. <br/>
<br/>
OOH! something else to add to my &quot;everything I ever learned&quot; List! LOL<br/>
<br/>

I used to work on the Mozart concerto.  I never played it well, but I could<br/>
play a lot of it.  When my daughter started clarinet I showed her how to put<br/>
it together and stuff.  Then I tried playing it.  After a couple of minutes<br/>
of fooling around, the Mozart started to almost play itself.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
have told you what the actual notes were, but my fingers and ear remembered<br/>
how it should go.<br/>

recently found a bunch of new music for it online and I have learned about 17 <br/>

did some duets with guitars at our camp-out last weekend.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-982890384">Along these same lines, a friend and I had a discussion about early music education and late music education and the studies that say that early music education will get someone farther (sorry, I&#39;m really stretching a paraphrase here).<br/>
<br/>
My question to those who tout those studies is:  Are there any studies done on adults who have just begun learning an instrument?  Is there really any proof that starting later means you can&#39;t learn as well?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t jump on me about the studies :o).  I don&#39;t care about studies anymore than anyone else does, except to refute someone else&#39;s touting of studies LOL.<br/>
<br/>
But its interesting that people draw conclusions from these kinds of studies, when they aren&#39;t asking the right questions in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
If an adult is interested in learning something (like Holt did with the cello), then that interest might propell them further than a child who isn&#39;t interested but is very talented.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and as far as neurology goes...I can tell you that there are *new* studies out there that say that neuro cells *can* be regenerated.  It used to be thought that neurons just die and thats that.  Now they are finding thats not really the case.  In fact, and this from vague memory so don&#39;t quote me, I think they are finding that the old adage &quot;if you don&#39;t use it, you lose it&quot; is true (and so is its opposite).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to look it up to make sure.<br/>
<br/>
Well, sorry for the ramble, just thinking out loud here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, that argument is bogus. I think you do lose *some* when you don&#39;t play<br/>
for a while.  I go through periods of not playing my horn.  When I pick it<br/>
up, I can play.  I just can&#39;t play with the same skill and finesse as when I<br/>
put it down.  But it doesn&#39;t take long to get it back.  And then there&#39;s the<br/>
example of the clarinet that I posted yesterday.  That was after a period of<br/>
about 25 years!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not a matter so much of *exercising* the muscles, though, as the muscle<br/>
memory of *specific* movements that you lose when you don&#39;t play for a<br/>
while.  I mean, my lips get lots of exercise talking, eating, and kissing<br/>
&lt;g&gt; when I&#39;m not playing my horn, but I still lose the stamina and<br/>
flexibility I have when I play almost every day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-794390903">from what I understand, the cells in children&#39;s brains are lacking <br/>
in a substance called Myelin. The myelin forms a sheath over the <br/>
axon (the arm part of a neuron, I think) at about puberty. This sort <br/>
of solidifies the connections that have been made, and makes it <br/>
harder to break them, or form new ones. Not impossible, though. I <br/>
learned a difficult piano piece in my early 40&#39;s :) <br/>
<br/>
One theory I&#39;ve heard about why there is a higher percentage of boys <br/>
who go further in math, than girls, is that schools are getting into <br/>
the higher mathematics at about puberty age FOR GIRLS (grade 7 and <br/>
8? does that sound right?) and that the myelinization of the brain <br/>
cells is beginning for girls just when more difficult cncepts are <br/>
coming to them via the system. Boys, otoh, are still pre-puberty for <br/>
the most part, in 7-8 grades, so the new concepts are being given to <br/>
brains that are more receptive.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, that&#39;s one theory. Personally, I think...if you&#39;re gonna be <br/>
good at math, you&#39;re going to go farther in math than those who <br/>
aren&#39;t good at math. And it doesn&#39;t really matter, the age, either. <br/>
My brother was a C student, including math, and took a pre-algebra <br/>
course in college...and completely GOT IT, engineering level <br/>
mathematics, the formulas for graphing an inclined plane or what <br/>
EVER. He took math class after math class, and just plain GOT IT. In <br/>
his late 20&#39;s. <br/>

years of experience.&quot;<br/>

I learned to read music when I was five, though, so early that I don&#39;t recall <br/>
much of HOW I learned, but I&#39;m pretty good at it.  It seems natural.  I quit <br/>
taking lessons while I was six but picked it all up again at ten (or rather <br/>
kept messing with the books I had, studying the hymnals at church).  Yet I&#39;m <br/>
not a great musician.  But I like it a lot and am busier with it than most <br/>
non-musicians. &lt;g&gt;  (Non professionals, I guess I mean.)<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s hypocritical for me to say it doesn&#39;t matter.  No telling, from my <br/>
personal experience.  But as to who would cite stats and when, it would be <br/>
someone wanting money or a job, and I doubt they&#39;re studying ANYONE past high <br/>
school age.<br/>
