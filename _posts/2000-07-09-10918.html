<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115375631">Julie, and anyone else interested, here is a recipe for a sauce you can use <br/>
in spaghetti and pizza that is not going to be high glycemic.  ~Karen           <br/>
                                                                                <br/>
        Italian sauce                                                           <br/>
                        1 lb hamb (optional),  2 15oz cans tomato sauce, 2 <br/>
tsp onion powder or 2 med onions-diced, 2 tsp garlic powder, 2 tbsp olive <br/>
oil, 1/2 chopped tomato, 1/2c water, 1 tsp salt, dash pepper, 1 tbsp basil, <br/>
1/2tsp oregano, 1/4c flax seed ground up, optional sweetener:  sweet <br/>
balance--add to taste, 1 tsp unsweetened apple juice from concentrate, or no <br/>
sweetener at all is fine, too.                                                  <br/>
                                    Brown hamburger, add flax seed;  set <br/>
aside; In saucepan, combine other ingredients, season to taste, add <br/>
hamburger, let simmer.  Serve with whole wheat pasta vermicelli.                <br/>
                                                                                <br/>
        In place of french bread, you can take wheat flour soft shell <br/>
tortillas, cut them into smaller pieces, add butter and garlic, and bake them <br/>
in the oven at 400* for about 5 mins.  They are yummy, but not high glycemic!   <br/>
                                                                                <br/>
                                                                                <br/>
                    Pizza                                                       <br/>
                                    Soft burrito shells,  italian sauce, <br/>
mozz. cheese, parmesan cheese, optional toppings:  tomato, meats, broccoli, <br/>
onion, cheddar cheese, cottage cheese, etc... (low glycemic choices)            <br/>
                                                                            <br/>
Preheat oven to 400*;  Spray non-stick cooking spray on pizza pan, and on the <br/>
tortilla.  bake in oven for about 3 mins.  Spread italian sauce, cheeses, <br/>
toppings of choice .  Bake in oven for about 5 mins, until cheeses are <br/>
melted.  Enjoy!  (this is really yummy)                                         <br/>
                                                                Strawberry <br/>
shake                                                                           <br/>

taste, stevia to taste, or  no additional sweetener is fine, too.   Blend in <br/>
blender, serves 2-3 people, depending on cup size.  Also can be frozen for a <br/>
spoonable dessert- stir a few times during freezing.                            <br/>
                                                                                <br/>
&quot;Chocolate&quot; shake                                                               <br/>
                    1-2 c milk (any kind),  1/2 - 1 c reg plain yogurt, 1-2 <br/>

2-3 depending on cup size                                                       <br/>
                                                        Pie shell               <br/>
                                                                            <br/>
2c whole wheat pastry flour, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 c canola oil, 1/4c cold water;  <br/>
Stir flour and salt in bowl. Combine oil and water in small bowl, and add to <br/>
flour mixture, stirring with a fork;  Form into 2 balls, and let sit, covered <br/>
with cloth, for 5 mins.  Roll out between sheets of wax paper;  Place in pie <br/>
pan, fill and bake;  For prebaked shell, prick with a fork, and bake at 375*  <br/>
for 10 min.  Makes one 10&quot; pie crust                                            <br/>
                                                                    When <br/>
making apple pie, substitute other sweetener for sugar, and you may want to <br/>
slightly increase spice amounts;  use wheat pastry crust;  For chocolate pie, <br/>
make pudding, following cooked pudding recipe, substituting carob for cocoa, <br/>
and adding a bit more vanilla; substitute sweet balance (or other low <br/>
glycemic sweetener) for sugar.  Pour into prebaked shell;  Make topping by <br/>
whipping heavy cream- about 1 cup or so-adding sweet balance or other <br/>
sweetener to taste;  vanilla could also be added for added taste;  spoon on <br/>
top of chocolate pie, put in refrigerator to chill and set.</div>
