<br/>
Learning and reflecting about ourselves, however we do it, is always useful &lt;<br/>
G&gt;. Seeing the positives of the ADD traits is important - because the <br/>
positives are THERE, but often people just look at the problems. This <br/>
syndrome (set of behavior patterns) is a mixed blessing, but it is not a <br/>
curse.<br/>
