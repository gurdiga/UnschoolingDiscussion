<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815899312">My husband and I are at odds (not uncommon) about wether the kids are<br/>
respectful or disrespectful. I think my husband confuses obedience with<br/>
respect. Just because the kids don&#39;t immediately obey, my husband gets upset<br/>
because they don&#39;t respect me. I feel they do respect me, just don&#39;t always<br/>
obey. So, how does one show respect? Is disobedience always a sign of<br/>
disrespect? I mean the kids do obey, just not right away. I think we have a<br/>
great amount of respect for one another, but don&#39;t want to be fooling<br/>
myself. I love the various opinions and advice from all of you and thank you<br/>
for your help in advance. :)<br/>
