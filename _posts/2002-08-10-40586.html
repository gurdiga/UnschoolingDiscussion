You are right to correct me -- they did not simply &quot;not&quot; submit a plan, they<br/>
refused to, on the principle that they don&#39;t use &quot;plans.&quot; (curricula)<br/>
<br/>
OK, so my point was that the state in MA puts requirements on homeschoolers<br/>
that some homeschoolers fulfill by lying about their plans. The Bryants did<br/>
not accept forced lying, preferring to be truthful and to expect decent<br/>
treatment by the state authorities. Instead, the state refused to accept<br/>
honesty and insisted that they lie in order to be free.<br/>
<br/>
Are Americans in Massachusetts free people, or not? Are you telling us that<br/>
regulations created by one-size-fits-all bureaucrats are fine, just because<br/>
they are &quot;easy to fill out&quot;? Whose side are you on?<br/>
<br/>
The Bryants are taking one small step, at huge personal expense and risk, in<br/>
order to help ALL homeschoolers everywhere, and you say they should cave in<br/>
to a bad regulation supported by a vindictive and stupid judge?<br/>
<br/>
 We&#39;re talking about a case which reveals exactly what I&#39;ve been talking<br/>
about -- the government hassle of people for the &quot;crime&quot; of non-conformance<br/>
to bad regulation. This is what homeschoolers everywhere are faced with if<br/>
they (we) don&#39;t stand up for our rights to raise our children on our own<br/>
terms and not cowtow to idiotic rules that attempt to chain us.<br/>
<br/>
Please restore my faith here. Explain your stance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You imply I lie when I send in my ed plan. How do you know? Have you been to<br/>
my home? Have you compared my unschooling and my ed plan? Carol Narigon&#39;s<br/>
letter says exactly what I&#39;m doing. So what would be the purpose of<br/>
representing what *I* and what all MA unschoolers do as a lie? (Have you<br/>
been to their homes too? Have you seen their ed plans?)<br/>
<br/>
How do these broadbrush misrepresentations of MA homeschooers and the<br/>
Bryants help anyone here unschool better? Your rhetoric may make for some<br/>
wonderfully scary, heroic stories around the campfire but in the light of<br/>
day they don&#39;t line up with the real live flesh and blood people I know.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Again, inflamatory and misrepresentative. Noble homeschoolers against the<br/>
evil state? Not. People taking a stand for something they believed in? I<br/>
hope so. But taking a stand or believing in something doesn&#39;t make someone<br/>
automatically right.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s no where near as noble to gather the state&#39;s homeschoolers together to<br/>
get the regulations changed, is it? It&#39;s the people who get shot who get<br/>
cheered and held up as heroes. *I&#39;m* not cheering. Though I do cheer for the<br/>
quiet ones in the state group who are politcally active for homeschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Funny, they didn&#39;t ask me if I thought that was a good way to help. And I<br/>
think there was a general feeling they may have harmed more than they<br/>
helped.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re basically saying the homeschoolers of MA are too blind, ignorant and<br/>
like scared sheep to be able to understand the smoke that&#39;s in their own<br/>
state. That you who see so much clearer know that every puff of smoke is<br/>
hiding a ranging inferno about to burst free. That insults every politically<br/>
active homeschooler in MA.<br/>
<br/>
Let us MA people fight our own fights without underinformed inflammatory<br/>
commentary from passers by, okay? Or if you feel your words need to be<br/>
heard, then feel free to post at<br/>

(And by now you should have read the &quot;A gentle nudge ...&quot; post. It might<br/>
help to reread it if you still feel continuing this would help my daughter<br/>
explore the world better, or would help someone who wants that Saxon 5/6 to<br/>
spend her money on something that would bring joy to her son.)<br/>

Please let&#39;s move the discussion back towatds the positives of unschooling. <br/>
Please let&#39;s share the joy and fun and beauty of watching our children <br/>
blossom and learn.<br/>
