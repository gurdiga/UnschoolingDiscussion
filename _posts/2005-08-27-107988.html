<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047117259">I know you can&#39;t decide this for me, but I would like some advice, if<br/>
you can offer it.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned over a year ago about a friend of my daughter&#39;s who was<br/>
going through a very rough time with her parents (she was being hit<br/>
and roughed up by her dad). We called CPS and they were originally<br/>
going to remove her fromm the home, then changed their minds and then<br/>
did nothing. NOTHING! I called a couple of times and no change.<br/>
<br/>
This now almost 18 year old girl is still living at home a year later<br/>
and her parents are becoming mean again (they backed off some<br/>
initially after the call - no hitting, but total isolation - wouldn&#39;t<br/>
let her eat with the family, no phone or computer access, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
She has told her parents she wants to move out and they have told her<br/>
to go. They are done with her.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s been homeschooled and is finished with high school. She has no<br/>
money and is wanting to leave while she figures out her future.<br/>
<br/>
She is best friends with our daughter who has asked us if this girl<br/>
could stay here for six months. My daughter asked us to consider this<br/>
but she added that she herself is not excited about the possibility.<br/>
The friend is a real drain emotionally and our daughter has really<br/>
come to life once she was not as able to spend time with this friend.<br/>
<br/>
We have five kids and a not very big house. Already double up on<br/>
bedrooms. On the other hand, this girl is someone we love and have<br/>
known for years. She is draining (very self-absorbed, obviously). She<br/>
has had drug use issues in the past though currently we are to assume<br/>
that she&#39;s not using any more.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my compassion is moved. I can only imagine how damaged she<br/>
is/feels. I know we can&#39;t be the ones to heal her, but we might be a<br/>
weigh station while she gets herself together. But is that a wise<br/>
thing to do? And what would need to happen legally?<br/>
<br/>
I feel torn and want to be sure I make a decision that is both<br/>
compassionate and yet wise (not just motivated by the urgency she<br/>
communicates).<br/>
<br/>
Okay - fire away with advice. If we don&#39;t take her, anyone have ideas<br/>
for how she can leave home and start on her own without much money?<br/>
How can we help her?<br/>

Okay -  fire away with advice. If we don&#39;t take her, anyone have ideas<br/>
for how she  can leave home and start on her own without much money?<br/>
How can we help  her?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Does she have a way to get to work?<br/>
 <br/>
Help her find a job, first.  Will her parents leave her alone if she&#39;s  <br/>
working a lot?  I suggest she stay there until she has some money and a  job.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t take her in, because it she is not going to suddenly  mature and become <br/>
motivated just because she&#39;s away from her parents.  She  needs to show <br/>
initiative.  Just asking to move in with someone else is not  enough.  She&#39;s old <br/>
enough to be working.  If she really wants to get  out, she should have a plan <br/>
to get a job and get some money and ways to cope  with her family until she can <br/>
get that far.  <br/>
 <br/>
Help her formulate the plan.  Offer what you&#39;re willing to do to  help her <br/>
execute it, without sacrificing your family&#39;s peace and  happiness.  Expect her <br/>
to do what she says she&#39;s going to do in return for  what you will do, and <br/>
follow up on it.  Don&#39;t let your daughter be the  middleman between you and the <br/>
girl.  If she wants adult help, she needs to  be adult.<br/>
 <br/>
This is not advice I would expect to be giving about a totally  unschooled <br/>
child, but it&#39;s advice I&#39;ve learned through experience.  I have  a 20 yo who has <br/>
had trouble being responsible with his money (he left school at  11).  We had <br/>
quite a few years of conflict over his desires to be an adult  and his <br/>
inablity to function as one.  He&#39;s past that, now.  But I  remember when he lived at <br/>
home, he would fail to do the things he agreed to do  (pay his car insurance, <br/>
etc.) even though he had the resources to do so.   All we wanted was for him <br/>
to have a plan based on his wishes, and to execute the  plan.  If his plan was <br/>
to chill out and not work for another year or so,  then he&#39;d have to expect <br/>
to have the lifestyle he had before he started  working.  We couldn&#39;t afford <br/>
the lifestyle of another fully-fledged  adult--we were both working and since he <br/>
was too, we didn&#39;t expect to have to  pay for a lot of his stuff.  But he <br/>
expected us to.<br/>
 <br/>
This girl needs help, but you shouldn&#39;t bend over backwards for her unless  <br/>
she is, too.  If she really wants to get out *now* she&#39;s going to have to  find <br/>
a live-in job somewhere or something like that.  Amusement Parks,  <br/>
housekeeper, nanny, elder care, cruise ship jobs are all things she could  do and have a <br/>
place to live, too.  Some of those things require an  adventerous spirit, and <br/>
a willingness to leave it all behind.  I could get  really excited about some <br/>
of those jobs if I were 18 again!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-527423031">I just really get the feeing that you&#39;d have a hard time looking  <br/>
yourself in the mirror if you turned her away.<br/>
<br/>
And, again, it might make life more difficult for your own kids, but  <br/>
what a splendid example of compassion and caring you&#39;d be for them, too.<br/>
<br/>
I would, of course, get your own family together and explain your  <br/>
thinking and make sure none of them have objections. I&#39;d say any of  <br/>
them ought to be able to veto it!<br/>
<br/>
At 18, you don&#39;t have to do anything legal - she&#39;s an adult.<br/>
<br/>
It is very very kind of you to want to help her - your own  <br/>
obligations to your own family have to come first, of course, but it  <br/>
really isn&#39;t the same as taking on another child.<br/>
<br/>
Given that we have nothing to go on except what you convey, Julie,  <br/>
I&#39;d take her for 6 months to a year. I&#39;d sit own and talk VERY  <br/>
seriously - make it really clear that you think she is wonderful and  <br/>
you want to be there to help her get on her feet and that you would  <br/>
not do this if you didn&#39;t have a ton of confidence in her.<br/>
<br/>
Specify very clearly what your expectations are about work, money,  <br/>
helping around the house, treatment of her &quot;temporary siblings,&quot; etc.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~~~<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Does she have a way to get to work?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. She has a car. And she works at Wendy&#39;s.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt; Help her find a job, first.  Will her parents leave her alone if she&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; working a lot? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She has been working a lot and got &quot;straight A&#39;s&quot; in the curriculum<br/>
they used. She&#39;s a good girl, actually, just very emotionally abused.<br/>
She&#39;s got a boyfriend that is a good guy too and we love and know him<br/>
well. He&#39;s in college locally.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I suggest she stay there until she has some money and a  job.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is what I&#39;m trying to figure out. The money part. Of course meals<br/>
etc. are no big deal at all. But who&#39;s paying her car insurance? And<br/>
what happens if she gets in an accident? And who buys her clothes or<br/>
pays for her applications to colleges etc.?<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; follow up on it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a good axiom to remember.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Don&#39;t let your daughter be the  middleman between you and the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; girl.  If she wants adult help, she needs to  be adult.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good! I&#39;ll ask to talk to ehr directly. That is a good idea.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; This girl needs help, but you shouldn&#39;t bend over backwards for her<br/>
 </span></blockquote>unless  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>about some <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of those jobs if I were 18 again!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank Karen. Those are good ideas. I have a hunch she is one of those<br/>
very smal persons currently. She&#39;s a passive person so this will be<br/>
ocmething for me to consider.<br/>

<br/>
Just this week I had to file for custody of a minor child.  He&#39;s 17,  will be <br/>
18 in April.  All I had to do was go to the court intake office for  <br/>
juveniles (the same place you go if they are in trouble) and file out the form  and <br/>
get a court date set.  Oh and pay the $25.00 fee for filing.   ANYONE can apply <br/>
for custody of any minor, whether related or not (I&#39;m  not).<br/>
 <br/>
Those who have an interest are notified of the court date and the judge  <br/>
hears the reasons why the minor child wants/needs to be elsewhere and makes a  <br/>
decision.<br/>
 <br/>
Also at this time parents can be told to pay child support to this third  <br/>
party and to pay health insurance for the child.<br/>
 <br/>
I live in VA, it may or may not be the same in your State.  There is  also a <br/>
thing called emancipation, which this child had wanted to do.  Here  in my <br/>
County they said a judge only grants about 1 out of 300 requests.   Preferring to <br/>
allow the child to live somewhere else if need be but holding the  parents <br/>
feet to the fire and making them pay support for the child as sort of  penance <br/>
for not being able to be good parents.<br/>
 <br/>
My court date is not until next week.  This information is only what I  have <br/>
gotten from social services and from the juvenile intake officers.<br/>
 <br/>
While I have misgivings about this situation for myself, there is no one  <br/>
else to help this child and I guess I kind of wish someone would have stepped  up <br/>
for me when I was younger like him and being abused.  So in helping  him, in <br/>
a way I&#39;m helping my own scared inner kid from long ago.<br/>
 <br/>
But this boy doesn&#39;t have drug issues or other issues to consider, so it&#39;s  <br/>
different in that regard.<br/>
 <br/>
I hope this information helps you and that everything works out for  you.<br/>

 will be <br/>
&gt; 18 in April.  All I had to do was go to the court intake office for  <br/>
&gt; juveniles (the same place you go if they are in trouble) and file<br/>
out the form  and <br/>
&gt; get a court date set.  Oh and pay the $25.00 fee for filing.  <br/>
ANYONE can apply <br/>
&gt; for custody of any minor, whether related or not (I&#39;m  not).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Those who have an interest are notified of the court date and the<br/>
judge  <br/>
&gt; hears the reasons why the minor child wants/needs to be elsewhere<br/>
and makes a  <br/>
&gt; decision.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Also at this time parents can be told to pay child support to this<br/>
third  <br/>
&gt; party and to pay health insurance for the child.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I live in VA, it may or may not be the same in your State.  There is<br/>
 also a <br/>
&gt; thing called emancipation, which this child had wanted to do.  Here<br/>
 in my <br/>
&gt; County they said a judge only grants about 1 out of 300 requests.  <br/>
Preferring to <br/>
&gt; allow the child to live somewhere else if need be but holding the <br/>
parents <br/>
&gt; feet to the fire and making them pay support for the child as sort<br/>
of  penance <br/>
&gt; for not being able to be good parents.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; My court date is not until next week.  This information is only what<br/>
I  have <br/>
&gt; gotten from social services and from the juvenile intake officers.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; While I have misgivings about this situation for myself, there is no<br/>
one  <br/>
&gt; else to help this child and I guess I kind of wish someone would<br/>
have stepped  up <br/>
&gt; for me when I was younger like him and being abused.  So in helping<br/>
 him, in <br/>
&gt; a way I&#39;m helping my own scared inner kid from long ago.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; But this boy doesn&#39;t have drug issues or other issues to consider,<br/>
so it&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; different in that regard.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I hope this information helps you and that everything works out for<br/>
 you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wonder how much she knows about money management. Having enough <br/>
money in the bank for insurance is important, but does she <br/>
understand that if an insurance payment is automatically taken out <br/>
of her checking account and she doesn&#39;t have enough money in there, <br/>
she could end up without insurance, which could lead to big <br/>
problems? Or does she even have a checking account (and understand <br/>
how it works)?<br/>
<br/>
Depending on what she knows and is capable of being responsible for, <br/>
you might need to handle her finances for her, help her with them, <br/>
or help her learn how to do it herself and check up on her <br/>
occasionally. <br/>
<br/>
Knowing what she knows might help make it easier to see whether she <br/>
could be on her own or would be much better off with your family as <br/>
a transitional step.<br/>

<br/>
Is it possible that the girl can just talk to her parents directly  <br/>
about what they intend to continue to provide for her when she &quot;moves  <br/>
out?&quot; I mean - it is very very common for kids to move out when they  <br/>
turn 18 - regardless of where they&#39;re moving, there is always the  <br/>
issue of insurance, etc. Also, for college financial aid purposes,  <br/>
she&#39;s considered dependent even though she&#39;s 18.<br/>
<br/>
If I was you, I would not get involved in those discussions with her  <br/>
parents. I&#39;d just make it clear to her that you&#39;re offering room and  <br/>
board.<br/>
<br/>
Her parents should keep her on their medical insurance, for example,  <br/>
if she&#39;s a full-time college student. Car insurance is a different  <br/>
issue - she might just have to pay for that herself if her parents  <br/>
won&#39;t. But, she could ask them to continue to pay for it - all they  <br/>
can do is say &quot;no.&quot; Anyway - she should talk to them directly about  <br/>
what financial support they&#39;d continue to give her if she decided to  <br/>
move out.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they&#39;ll be unhappy about her moving out and maybe they&#39;ll take  <br/>
it as normal behavior for a kid turning 18.<br/>
<br/>
It would be best for HER if she could move out with their agreement  <br/>
and support. And that&#39;s probably most likely if she doesn&#39;t even talk  <br/>
about where she&#39;s going until she&#39;s talked in more general terms with  <br/>
them about what they&#39;ll do for her when she moves out.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It takes about two weeks to get a custody petition on the dockets (here in  <br/>
busy VA anyway), IF there is abuse or suspected abuse, you can rush it through  <br/>
quicker.<br/>
 <br/>
If parents don&#39;t object it&#39;s simply a matter of signing the forms and the  <br/>
judge ordering it.<br/>
 <br/>
If the parents DO object they will get their say and then the minor child  <br/>
will speak and then the person seeking custody.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s ALWAYS important to have something legally binding for a minor  child.  <br/>
If they are in an accident and need treatment, the person with  custody would <br/>
be able to sign for treatment.<br/>
 <br/>
In my situation it started out with nothing illegal and in fact the parents  <br/>
THROWING the child out.  (because he missed church)  Then he  tried to go home <br/>
and talk to them a few times and they made him leave.  So  he called and told <br/>
them he was applying for emancipation and had a new job (did  work for his <br/>
dad) and hoped they could have some sort of relationship at some  time in the <br/>
future.<br/>
 <br/>
The next day he was arrested.  He sits in juvenile detention right now  and <br/>
could be released because there are no charges except he won&#39;t go home with  <br/>
his parents and no one else has custody, yet.<br/>
 <br/>
So, IF we had gotten the legal custody two weeks ago when the boy first  came <br/>
here, then there would not be a problem now.<br/>
 <br/>
You just never think of all the things that might come up when you have a  <br/>
minor child living with you without any legal custody.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d recommend you get some sort of legal document.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410501768">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I mentioned over a year ago about a friend of my daughter&#39;s who was<br/>
going through a very rough time with her parents (she was being hit<br/>
and roughed up by her dad). ........<br/>
<br/>
She is best friends with our daughter who has asked us if this girl<br/>
could stay here for six months. My daughter asked us to consider this<br/>
but she added that she herself is not excited about the possibility.<br/>
The friend is a real drain emotionally and our daughter has really<br/>
come to life once she was not as able to spend time with this friend.<br/>
<br/>
..........She is draining (very self-absorbed, obviously). She<br/>
has had drug use issues in the past though currently we are to assume<br/>
that she&#39;s not using any more.<br/>
<br/>
.......I can only imagine how damaged she<br/>
is/feels. I know we can&#39;t be the ones to heal her &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a very difficult situation all around, as I think it was when you<br/>
first posted about this poor lass last time.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know whether she should come to your home or not, but I have some<br/>
thoughts. I think you know this stuff already but I want to mention it<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
She may be legally an adult, but as someone who has been abused, emotionally<br/>
she is most likely still the needy child she was when she was first abused.<br/>
People who have been hurt need some kind of therapy to &quot;grow up&quot; and become<br/>
healed. It took me at least 15 years after becoming 18 to do so, and I was<br/>
much less abused than this girl has been.<br/>
<br/>
When I say therapy I mean that she will have a need to have &quot;therapeutic<br/>
conversations&quot; with someone, whether that be a counselor of some kind (this<br/>
is one time when being in a school may have helped her), a therapist, a<br/>
group therapy either formal or informal (eg Narcotics Anonymous). In the<br/>
absence of this she will likely make you and your dd her &quot;therapists&quot;,<br/>
including getting angry if you touch her &quot;sore points&quot; of denial, which you<br/>
know must exist. It is a real need, and you have noted that she is draining<br/>
of your dd.<br/>
<br/>
Without actively dealing with the damage that her psyche has suffered from<br/>
being abused, she will almost certainly continue to replay the negative<br/>
relationships she had with her parents with future romantic and even<br/>
professional relationships. She will almost certainly be attracted to and<br/>
drawn into relationships with men who will turn out to be abusive in<br/>
parallel and mirroring ways. And the person she will turn to in order to<br/>
unload her misery onto would likely be your dd.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest, regardless of whether she moves in with you, that one big<br/>
way to help her would be to find somewhere for these &quot;therapeutic<br/>
conversations&quot; to occur. Alice Miller speaks of the concept of the &quot;witness&quot;<br/>
to validate the child&#39;s negative feelings. Maybe there is a support group<br/>
for battered women nearby that she could join, or even a half way house or<br/>
shelter. If she still has a desire to use drugs, she might find NA to be<br/>
very freeing. Maybe there is some kind of therapy available through CPS.<br/>
<br/>
Her dad had better beware. The moment she turns 18, if he hits her she can<br/>
call the cops and he&#39;d be charged with assault. He would probably claim that<br/>
she was trespassing. Her parents could probably use some serious therapy<br/>
also.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with it, Julie.<br/>

also prohibited interaction with our daughter, who she sees weekly at<br/>
church anyway.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m thinking that if we are going to be custodians of her, we need<br/>
to have something in writing to protect *us* from their claim that<br/>
we&#39;ve kidnapped their daughter or anything like that.<br/>

They are not trustworthy at all.<br/>

<br/>
-=-My daughter asked us to consider this...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
Why did she ask you to consider it?<br/>
Did she ask because her friend told her to?<br/>
Asked her to?<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s unable to say no to her friend, that&#39;s a recipe for bullying or for <br/>
her losing her autonomy, if she&#39;s easily influenced by this girl, and <br/>
DEFINITELY for losing her privacy and freedom.   <br/>
<br/>
-=-. . . but she added that she herself is not excited about the possibility.<br/>
The friend is a real drain emotionally and our daughter has really<br/>
come to life once she was not as able to spend time with this friend.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would say &quot;I&#39;ve thought about it, and I don&#39;t think it would be good for <br/>
the family or for our own homeschooling situation.&quot;   (or something to that <br/>
effect)<br/>
<br/>
-=-She is draining (very self-absorbed, obviously). She<br/>
has had drug use issues in the past though currently we are to assume<br/>
that she&#39;s not using any more.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re left to assume, there&#39;s insufficient knowledge and up-front <br/>
openness.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know we can&#39;t be the ones to heal her, but we might be a<br/>
weigh station while she gets herself together.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Way station.   Weigh stations have to do with trucks and highways.   Way <br/>
stations are stops along a journey.   Sorry, can&#39;t help but keep you from <br/>
imagining that you need to weigh her as she passes in and out (and under the <br/>
circumstances it reminds me of drug testing...).<br/>
<br/>
-=-I feel torn and want to be sure I make a decision that is both<br/>
compassionate and yet wise (not just motivated by the urgency she<br/>
communicates).-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to commit to six months.   Maybe offer to help her find a <br/>
place to live (which would involve getting a job to pay for a place to live), and <br/>
say &quot;until Thanksgiving&quot; (or Halloween or some upcoming date of prominence).   <br/>
 That&#39;s a maybe IF you can&#39;t stand to say no.   <br/>
<br/>
Compassion toward outsiders siphons off compassion toward the kids you ARE <br/>
committed to attending to.<br/>

she&#39;s not excited about it, she really appreciated knowing tha twe<br/>
cared enough to consider it and if there really was no else for this<br/>
friend to go, she&#39;d want her here.<br/>
<br/>
My 11 year old son came to tell me personally that we should take her.<br/>
:) He&#39;s our compassionate guy.<br/>
<br/>
I called this girl yesterday afternoon and we were able to look over<br/>
the specifics of her situation with her parents. She really wants to<br/>
go to college. This is something dh and I can easily help her with. I<br/>
gave her a task to complete over the next couple of days and I&#39;m going<br/>
to make some legal inquiries.<br/>
<br/>
She is convinced her parents would flip if they thought she had moved<br/>
here. So I told her that as a minor she can&#39;t come unless we obtain<br/>
legal permission from them (and the money she deserves) to live with<br/>
us. It may be that her coming to be with us will provide someleverage,<br/>
however - some bargaining power for her to be able to get some money<br/>
for school etc.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
All the advice was really really helpful. My dh and I will keep<br/>
sorting things out. At least we can help her with her college goal and<br/>
give her the vision to keep going. She was so grateful yesterday when<br/>
I just laid out the steps for her. She didn&#39;t even know where to<br/>
start. Now that she&#39;s got tasks to perform, she sounded empowered. It<br/>
was a dear phone call. I&#39;m used to her being more reticent but this<br/>
time she sounded positively brave. Hope that&#39;s a sign of good things<br/>
to come.<br/>

There have been times my kids asked me whether another kid could come over <br/>
(or something similar) and it seemed clear that they were only asking becuse <br/>
they had agreed to ask, but really wanted the answer to be no.   They wanted me <br/>
to say no, because they had failed to have the courage to say no, or just <br/>
didn&#39;t know what their options really were or how to word a &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I had taken their words just at face value without reading their posture <br/>
and tone and hesitation, I might&#39;ve agreed to something they truly didn&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up with the ill effects of my parents having taken in cousins.   I <br/>
suppose it improved their lives, but at a cost to mine and my sisters&#39; and to my <br/>
parents.   We lost our family as a unit from then on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have always told my kids that if they really can&#39;t find the words or <br/>
the way to say &#39;no&#39; to such things, they can ask me to do it for them. <br/>
My oldest used that a few times when he was a teen: he was very peer <br/>
dependent (no, he wasn&#39;t fully unschooled if you want to know!). If he <br/>
was out and got asked to to do something / go somewhere he felt <br/>
uncomfortable about, he&#39;d say he had to ring. He&#39;d ask, I&#39;d say &#39;do you <br/>
want to&#39; and if he said no (his mates didn&#39;t know what the no was about) <br/>
I&#39;d say &#39;no you can&#39;t&#39; and then he had an excuse and wouldn&#39;t lose face. <br/>
My youngest uses it because he can&#39;t bear to hurt people: if a friend <br/>
rings and wants him to go over, he can&#39;t say &#39;no&#39;, so we go through the <br/>
same process. He&#39;s now 15 and is learning to say, &#39;Thanks, but maybe <br/>
another day, I&#39;m too tired / don&#39;t feel like going out today&#39; or <br/>
whatever. he&#39;s learning, but still finds it hard.<br/>
<br/>
Of course people have thought that I am a mean mother at times, but I <br/>
don&#39;t care: my kids&#39; feelings are more important.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile I would talk through how they could do it themselves, and <br/>
model it myself. That last has been a big one: I&#39;m 53 and was brought up <br/>
in a time-culture where women were largely expected to not hurt, to <br/>
please others blah blah de blah. I have had to learn - for my own sake <br/>
and for my kids sake. But we also talk about how much something matters <br/>
to us, how much it means to the other person, and work from there, when <br/>
we have the time.<br/>

She is convinced her parents would flip if they thought she had moved<br/>
here. So I told her that as a minor she can&#39;t come unless we obtain<br/>
legal permission from them (and the money she deserves) to live with<br/>
us. It may be that her coming to be with us will provide someleverage,<br/>
however - some bargaining power for her to be able to get some money<br/>
for school etc.<br/>
