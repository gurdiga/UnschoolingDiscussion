<br/>
Why Christian Unschooling is an Oxymoron<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Most of the Christians I talked to who are unschooling do not fit the <br/>
stereotype of a tv-watching, video-game playing, child-centered home (though a few <br/>
do). They desire the best for their children. It&#39;s simply that they have not <br/>
tested the educational philosophy against the Scriptures. In the same manner <br/>
that on first glimpse, we may rationalize and justify the secular world&#39;s push <br/>
toward natural-consequence discipline or (non)submission to authority, so do <br/>
many Christians become sucked into the philosophy of unschooling. Each of these <br/>
bears a closer look at God&#39;s Word, testing to see if they are true (they are <br/>
not). Can one be a Christian and unschool? Certainly. Just as one can be a <br/>
Christian who disregards other commands of the Lord. But you cannot provide both a <br/>
Christian education and an unschooling education simultaneously. They are <br/>
mutually exclusive.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why does it matter if a Christian calls himself an unschooler? It matters <br/>
because it lends legitimacy to what is largely a pagan movement (pagan, not <br/>
secular). The Christian with a relaxed homeschooling style, when he declares <br/>
himself an unschooler, gives tacit approval to the unschooling movement. And that <br/>
unschooling movement is not simply just an education style, it is a lifestyle. <br/>
A lifestyle that rejects fundamentals of the Bible -- that children are to be <br/>
trained, to be taught, to be nurtured in the fear and admonition of the Lord.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125538632">&quot;As parents we will reap the pleasures of [our] sin for a season, but we will <br/>
surely produce a self-centered young adult who has no strong character and no <br/>
eager desire to become a submissive servant of the Lord Jesus Christ.  Heb. <br/>
11:25b   He will desire to follow the same methods (as we employed in his <br/>
education) to attain goals in his adult life. &quot;<br/>

Is it Scriptural to focus on fun in our educational methods?  What do our <br/>
children really need?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-342243110">LOL. Okay, Okay. Uncle. I get your point. I just want to be as fair <br/>
as I can to both sides since I am actually very conscious of <br/>
nuances in both movements. Broadbrushing is a pet peeve of <br/>
mine. It doesn&#39;t advance either understanding or good relating.<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;ve definitely made your case for the fact that there are <br/>
vocal Christians who are opposed to the unschooling <br/>
movement. And I know it&#39;s important to take people at their <br/>
words. So yes, these Christians see unschooling as sin.<br/>
