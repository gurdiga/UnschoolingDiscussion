 </span></blockquote>Do you?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, do you go ahead and do what you want regardless of what others think?<br/>
<br/>
My children (15 & 7) seem to truly *care* what I think. Because I trust them. <br/>
Because they trust me. Their friends aren&#39;t so lucky. Their schoofled and <br/>
schooledat-home friends are always getting into trouble. I think that the <br/>
bonds we create while they&#39;re very young can be &quot;lifelines&quot; when they&#39;re <br/>
older. <br/>
<br/>
Too many parents seem to want to push their babies into growing up. Then when <br/>
they&#39;re teens, they want to &quot;baby&quot; them. It just can&#39;t work that way. Parents <br/>
*must* realize that teens are quickly adults. If they&#39;ve adjusted <br/>
appropriately to the child&#39;s changes, it should go smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
School stops a lot of that &quot;natural progression&quot;---and so do some <br/>
parents---but I think school plays a huge roll. School says, &quot;Send your <br/>
babies to us; don&#39;t worry that they cry!&quot;. Then when they&#39;re teens, school <br/>
says, &quot;Lock &#39;em up! Make them DO! Keep them in line! No matter what the <br/>
cost!&quot;. They can&#39;t have it both ways! <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling allows you to &quot;go with the flow&quot;. Especially as preteens, the <br/>
children are independent one minute and needy, the next. They aren&#39;t allowed <br/>
that freedom in school. So as unschoolers, what you get are kids that &quot;know&quot; <br/>
what they &quot;are&quot;. Schooled kids are so mixed up. Unschoolers can be who they <br/>
are; schooled kids often rely on others&#39; opinions---and NOT those of their <br/>
parents, who seem totally out of the loop.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron (15) is VERY open with me about what&#39;s hapening to him and to his <br/>
friends. Most of his friends can&#39;t talk to their parents. They&#39;ll talk to me. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I *do* want my boys to go ahead and do what they want. But I can trust that <br/>
they are doing things because *they* want to --and that they won&#39;t lie to me <br/>
about things or try to keep things from me. The peer pressure is there, but <br/>
the hold it has over them is not nearly as strong as that of their friends. <br/>
It&#39;s obvious. And they&#39;ll talk with me---about anything. Cameron seems to <br/>
*want* my opinion. <br/>
<br/>
It could be that he&#39;s just &quot;that kind of kid&quot;. That&#39;s possible. He&#39;s always <br/>
been an easy child. But I think that a lot of it has to do with the respect <br/>
and trust we show him ---that his friends don&#39;t get in school or from their <br/>
schooled parents.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I probably am not the best one to comment on this as my boys are only 8 and 6 <br/>
but, I think you should remember that they will make the right decision for <br/>
them.  It might not be the decision you would make.  I think our children <br/>
respect us and we respect them.  I think our boys have a respect for our <br/>
opinions.  That doesn&#39;t mean that they think we are always right.  They are <br/>
the first ones to question what we, as parents, say. <br/>
<br/>

doing what they really want to do anyway.&quot;  My response was &quot;Of <br/>
course you can!&quot; &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
You might be able to keep your children from doing things in front of you but <br/>
you cannot keep them from doing things behind your back.  Unless you are with <br/>
them 24-7.<br/>
<br/>
But in our house that is not the goal.  I want my boys to be open and honest <br/>
with us.  I don&#39;t want them to have a reason to hide something they are <br/>
doing.  I trust them to make the decisions for themselves.  Not that they <br/>
will never make a bad decision.  But they can come to us, as parents, and we <br/>
can talk about possibilities and different options and we can offer <br/>
suggestions. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway I am rambling yet again with no clear point in mind.<br/>

CHILD.  Honestly, they may not make the decision that YOU think is right for <br/>
them.  For us, that is another reason to homeschool, so my children have a <br/>
firm grasp of who they *are* and what works for *them* as separate and <br/>
complete human beings.  I know my children won&#39;t make *my* decisions, nor <br/>
will they avoid *my* decisions ~ the whole point is in them being free to <br/>
make *their very own* decisions... <br/>

&lt;&lt; Am I just being naïve?  My daughter is <br/>
<br/>
only 2 and it will be many more years before my husband and I <br/>
<br/>
have to face dating and boyfriends.  I know that many of you on <br/>
<br/>
this list have older kids so I wanted to ask you all.  Do &quot;they&quot; <br/>
<br/>
(meaning teenagers) just go ahead and do what &quot;they&quot; want <br/>
<br/>
regardless of what &quot;you&quot; (as parents) think? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They became teenagers gradually, and right where we were, so they do what <br/>
they do based on years of discussion and analysis.  <br/>
<br/>
It helps here that our kids are all verbal and interested in interpersonal <br/>
relationships.  We talk about why other couples do what they do, why someone <br/>
got divorced, whether someone seems to be being a good boyfriend or not (of <br/>
the adults around them, or older teens).  They talk to us about things <br/>
they&#39;ve seen and heard when they were at other people&#39;s houses.   We discuss <br/>
pregnancies and miscarriages with them.  There just are not topics that we <br/>
keep our kids away from our out of.<br/>
<br/>
The same way they&#39;ve come to know that they didn&#39;t HAVE to play with anyone <br/>
they thought was being mean to them, they know they don&#39;t HAVE to go out with <br/>
anyone, or become romantical with anyone, they can always say no, or they can <br/>
offer input into ANY situation to change it, and if the other person doesn&#39;t <br/>
want their input, bye-bye!<br/>
<br/>
Holly is eleven.  We had a male friend of hers who is somewhere in the nine <br/>
to eleven year range, I&#39;m not sure here overnight, because his mom wasn&#39;t <br/>
feeling well.  Holly said &quot;I&#39;ll sleep with him in the library,&quot; and I said <br/>
okay.  I also suggested they could put a futon on the floor in her room if <br/>
they wanted to, becuase it was a very windy night, and that library has a <br/>
whistly window and a sometimes-rattly (sometimes blows right open) door on <br/>
the deck.  It&#39;s up high.  But they decided to sleep on futons in there, so I <br/>
helped them set it up and I locked the door with a deadbolt so it wouldn&#39;t <br/>
blow open.<br/>
<br/>
The preparations had all to do with comfort and a peaceful night, not about <br/>
keeping a girl away from a boy.<br/>
<br/>
When we kept a family of kids, a girl and her two brothers, all four made <br/>
beds up there, and I didn&#39;t worry a bit.<br/>
<br/>
It often happened with the boys (still does) that they have mixed groups of <br/>
kids from out of town come for a concert or whatever and stay over.  They <br/>
sleep just wherever, however.  So our kids do NOT have the expectation that <br/>
if there are mixed groups that there will or should be even KISSING, let <br/>
alone sex.  There is no long-awaited charge for them.  Sleeping is sleeping.  <br/>
Kirby has a queen-sized bed and a futon on the floor in his room.  We have a <br/>
neighbor, Joey, who pretty much lives in Kirby&#39;s room.  Last time Sadie was <br/>
over (18, Amazon-queen type, unschooled, in college) she just slept on <br/>
Kirby&#39;s bed with him.  Separate covers, but not because anybody said so.  She <br/>
just fell asleep where she was, and it was no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
At our house, because we have NEVER made a big deal about anyone being a girl <br/>
or a boy, and have not acted nervous or said who couldn&#39;t sleep or be or sit <br/>
or ride where, the kids are calm and mature.<br/>
<br/>
The only problem kid has been a schooled kid, only child, who had a crush on <br/>
a friend of my niece, and when the Espanola homeschooler crowd would come <br/>
over, he always had to come over too, and sit with the girls, and touch them <br/>
too much, and make too much sexual-tension commentary, and generally be an <br/>
irritating traditional schoolboy.    I would just make loud general comments <br/>
like &quot;If Eric&#39;s bothering you, just tell him to go sleep in the den,&quot; or &quot;If <br/>
Eric&#39;s a problem, we can send him home.&quot;  (He has a car and lives one mile <br/>
away.)<br/>
<br/>
This came up once (on this list or somewhere else, the forum maybe) and <br/>
someone new to unschooling and homeschooling and new to kids being open and <br/>
honest got VERY shrill about it.  Someone had asked about a mixed-gender <br/>
sleepover of eight or nine year olds, I think.  Several of us said we saw no <br/>
problem, and this new mom kinda went OFF on us that if we thought that kids <br/>
had ever slept in the same room at our house and NOT had sex that we were <br/>
fooling ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
It was fascinating to see how strongly SHE obviously thought it was <br/>
inevitable, or required, that if you can reach each other in the dark you&#39;re <br/>
going to screw like bunnies.<br/>
<br/>
If you could all have seen the looks on my kids&#39; faces when I read them her <br/>
post, you would all KNOW volumes.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby seems probably to have &quot;done it&quot; (I didn&#39;t ask straight out but several <br/>
comments were made which indicated, and the behavior of the now-former <br/>
girlfriend seemed to confirm), but not at the house.  At a campout in <br/>
Arizona.  We had talked about birth control since he turned fourteen, and <br/>
everytime he leaves for a teen-filled place and I won&#39;t be there, I remind <br/>
him and remind him where his friends can get condoms if they need them, and <br/>
we&#39;ve given them condoms too &quot;in case their friends need them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t much &quot;date.&quot;  They go to movies in groups, they do things at <br/>
people&#39;s houses in groups, they&#39;re not trolling for partners in any way.   <br/>
Twice when Kirby had intended and planned to be alone with a girl, others <br/>
showed up and went with them.  That&#39;s been an interesting phenomenon.  <br/>
Because the greater group of people they hang out with is used to &quot;Sure, come <br/>
on with us,&quot; there was no tactful way for them to say &quot;This time you&#39;re NOT <br/>
welcome.&quot;  In both cases, though, he only expressed mild disappointment or <br/>
surprise, not any anger.<br/>

We are working towards this, but how?  I know it is a vauge question <br/>
but I am having trouble wording it.  How do you handle it when they <br/>
do something *wrong*, both if you find out and if they tell you <br/>
themselves?  How do you create that trust to *insure* they do come to <br/>
you?  Right now, my ds, 4, is pretty open but I want to maintain that <br/>

&lt;&lt; I have to agree with this.  I think most parents do try to teach their <br/>
kids morals.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve tried to teach them how to think through things, by modelling, and by <br/>
helping them consider more factors than they had thought up on their own.<br/>
<br/>
The discussions of why other people do things really help.<br/>
<br/>
I think watching so many movies together helps, because different people see <br/>
and understand the same situation from different levels of awareness and <br/>
maturity.  The Princess Bride is being watched here lately.  It&#39;s fantasy, <br/>
but people&#39;s motives are fascinating in that story, and it just adds to the <br/>
huge store of considerations my kids have.<br/>
<br/>
And as has been said before about unschoolers and the real world, my kids <br/>
aren&#39;t preparing to live in the real world, they DO live in the real world.  <br/>
They&#39;re not practicing for the time when they will make their own decisions, <br/>
they are making real decisions now, and have been since they were little.<br/>
<br/>
What to eat and when to sleep are real.<br/>
That extends to other decisionmaking smoothly and easily.<br/>
<br/>
The same way learning to read makes them confident about learning other <br/>
things, coming to REALLY know what it feels like to eat when you&#39;re actually <br/>
hungry, and to go to sleep when you&#39;re tired instead of by the clock is great <br/>
preparation for deciding when to kiss someone.  Not by the clock or the <br/>
calendar, not because it&#39;s expected on a date the same way dessert comes <br/>
after cleaning your plate, but do you WANT to kiss this person?  Will the <br/>
result be ideal?  Can&#39;t you just kiss them later, when both seem clearly to <br/>
want to?<br/>
<br/>
Forcing a child to eat at 6:00, clean the plate, have desert, wash the <br/>
dishes, brush teeth, WEAR PAJAMAS, get in bed at 9:30, be asleep by 10:00... <br/>
that seems to me to be a drill for... turn 16, go on a date, pick her up at <br/>
7:30, go to the movie at 8:00, hold her hand by 8:30, kiss her by 9:00, leave <br/>
the movie quickly without looking at posters or talking to people you konw so <br/>
you find a place to park and make out so you can be home by 11:00, you only <br/>
have a few minutes so MOVE FAST...<br/>
<br/>
A different kind of life leads to a different kind of thinking.<br/>

What an excellent post.  It reminded me of how &quot;sexual&quot; people make <br/>
things.  My now 4 yo has always run around in a diaper and then <br/>
underwear.  Up until he turned 4  he would pretty much take of his <br/>
clothes and run around comfortably in his underwear.  My dh&#39;s family <br/>
and especially the kids ranging from younger than him to grown up <br/>
always had to comment.  They kept trying to kncikname him something <br/>
to do with being *naked*.  The kid wasn&#39;t *naked* and we never <br/>
thought twice about it.  Also, this was always at a relatives house <br/>
not in the middle of the park &lt;g&gt;.  It never made sense to me, but <br/>
maybe that is where it all starts.  Even at this young age someone <br/>
has taught them it is odd and they are different.   He still spends <br/>
his day in underwear and of course now my 2yo completely not potty <br/>
trained one insists on wearing them too..LOL!<br/>

&gt; too much, and make too much sexual-tension commentary, and <br/>
generally be an <br/>
&gt; irritating traditional schoolboy.    I would just make loud general <br/>
comments <br/>
&gt; like &quot;If Eric&#39;s bothering you, just tell him to go sleep in the <br/>
den,&quot; or &quot;If <br/>
&gt; Eric&#39;s a problem, we can send him home.&quot;  (He has a car and lives <br/>
one mile <br/>
&gt; away.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This came up once (on this list or somewhere else, the forum maybe) <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; someone new to unschooling and homeschooling and new to kids being <br/>
open and <br/>
&gt; honest got VERY shrill about it.  Someone had asked about a mixed-<br/>
gender <br/>
&gt; sleepover of eight or nine year olds, I think.  Several of us said <br/>
we saw no <br/>
&gt; problem, and this new mom kinda went OFF on us that if we thought <br/>
that kids <br/>
&gt; had ever slept in the same room at our house and NOT had sex that <br/>
we were <br/>
&gt; fooling ourselves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was fascinating to see how strongly SHE obviously thought it was <br/>
&gt; inevitable, or required, that if you can reach each other in the <br/>
dark you&#39;re <br/>
&gt; going to screw like bunnies.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you could all have seen the looks on my kids&#39; faces when I read <br/>
them her <br/>
&gt; post, you would all KNOW volumes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kirby seems probably to have &quot;done it&quot; (I didn&#39;t ask straight out <br/>
but several <br/>
&gt; comments were made which indicated, and the behavior of the now-<br/>
former <br/>
&gt; girlfriend seemed to confirm), but not at the house.  At a campout <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; Arizona.  We had talked about birth control since he turned <br/>
fourteen, and <br/>
&gt; everytime he leaves for a teen-filled place and I won&#39;t be there, I <br/>
remind <br/>
&gt; him and remind him where his friends can get condoms if they need <br/>
them, and <br/>
&gt; we&#39;ve given them condoms too &quot;in case their friends need them.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My kids don&#39;t much &quot;date.&quot;  They go to movies in groups, they do <br/>
things at <br/>
&gt; people&#39;s houses in groups, they&#39;re not trolling for partners in any <br/>
way.   <br/>
&gt; Twice when Kirby had intended and planned to be alone with a girl, <br/>
others <br/>
&gt; showed up and went with them.  That&#39;s been an interesting <br/>
phenomenon.  <br/>
&gt; Because the greater group of people they hang out with is used <br/>
to &quot;Sure, come <br/>
&gt; on with us,&quot; there was no tactful way for them to say &quot;This time <br/>
you&#39;re NOT <br/>
&gt; welcome.&quot;  In both cases, though, he only expressed mild <br/>
disappointment or <br/>
&gt; surprise, not any anger.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Her comment was <br/>
 something along the lines of &quot;Well you can&#39;t stop them from <br/>
 doing what they really want to do anyway.&quot;  My response was &quot;Of <br/>
 course you can!&quot;  If you raise your kids with moral values and <br/>
 sense of what&#39;s right and wrong then, they will make the right <br/>
 decisions about these things.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She seems to be of the opinion that if you &quot;let&quot; a teenager decide on their <br/>
own what to do with their time, that they&#39;re gonna choose sex, drugs and rock <br/>
and roll.  But when you have frankly discussed STD&#39;s, addictions, and riots <br/>
at concerts, they have the info and perspective they need to make the right <br/>
decisions for themselves.  I don&#39;t think that moral rights and wrongs are <br/>
really the issue, but maybe that&#39;s just my extremely libertarian values <br/>
speaking, lol.  <br/>
