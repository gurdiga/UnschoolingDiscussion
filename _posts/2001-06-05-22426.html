<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403286014">Oh for crying out loud.  These kids weren&#39;t surviving by eating pond water<br/>
or lilly pad soup.  It is so iritating when folks only &quot;smell the bad<br/>
smells&quot; and believe any little thing they see in the newspaper.  And,<br/>
besides which, it is a lake, not a pond.<br/>
<br/>
Using the same logic, ie. it appeared in a newspaper and a government<br/>
official may or may not have said it, then all homeschoolers are radical<br/>
religious nuts who beat their kids.  I mean, I&#39;ve read it in a newspaper and<br/>
folks that work with CPS have said so.  And family members have helped CPS<br/>
remove children from those homes.  So, it must be true.<br/>
<br/>
Now, how about reading what some folks who know what they are talking about<br/>
have said.  Including the *fact* that she had every reason to be paranoid<br/>
AND the *fact* that county officials were involved in trying to steal her<br/>
home AND they have succeeded.<br/>
<br/>
They were trying to be self-sustaining and not live off county aide.  They<br/>
had wanted to live &quot;off the grid&quot; when the husband became ill and could not<br/>
continue with their plans to &quot;homestead&quot; their property.<br/>
<br/>
The facts are that they were not doing without power and the local power<br/>
company has acknowledged that.  It was an excuse used by the county to sway<br/>
public opinion to their cause.<br/>
<br/>
Their house is not without heat.  They have wood and a wood stove as does<br/>
almost every other house in that part of the country.<br/>
<br/>
The facts are that they were receiving boxes of food and had received a 200<br/>
pound box of food the Friday before all this happened.  Another lie the<br/>
county used to excuse what they are doing.<br/>
<br/>
The facts are that they had several dogs which may or maynot have pulled<br/>
down a moose and the *facts* are it doesn&#39;t take a ferrel dog or the wolf<br/>
hybrids that they have to do this.  We&#39;ve shot FiFi and Fido because they<br/>
got together with some of their buddies in the neighborhood and we ended up<br/>
having to put ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN stitches in one of our broodmares<br/>
that they attacked.  Go ask any rancher with sheep who causes the most<br/>
damages and they will tell you someone&#39;s pet that isn&#39;t locked up and gets<br/>
together with other roaming pets.<br/>
<br/>
As Mary pointed out on HEM, &quot;if you look on the map where Sagle is, it&#39;s<br/>
right next to Pend Oreille Lake, near Sandpoint, where developers have been<br/>
having a field day making money on real estate. Great site for a luxury<br/>
condominium project.&quot;  Someone wants their land and now they have it.  That<br/>
isn&#39;t paranoia, that is reality.  This whole thing was about getting them<br/>
off the land anyway it took.<br/>
<br/>
And precisely how do you know these kids were raised to hate and fear<br/>
authority? Because some newspaper said so?  I&#39;m not thinking any child would<br/>
be too enamored of a county that had *kidnapped* their mother!  And I&#39;m not<br/>
thinking that some woman would be too fond of a county that was stealing her<br/>
home!  Do the math, property appraised at $500,000 is seized for $5,000 in<br/>
back taxes and sold for $50,000.  Nice return on the dollar, if you ask me!<br/>
<br/>
And their mother wasn&#39;t taken in because of mental anything!  Those people<br/>
have handed out several stories--alcohol, mental illness, child abuse.  And<br/>
they deteriorated in one week?<br/>
<br/>
I hope no one on the list ever has the audacity to refuse to go on aide from<br/>
the county they live in.  Particularly if they are homeschooling which is<br/>
the other &quot;sin&quot; named by CPS!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the daugher had gone through a teenage thing and left the house in a<br/>
huff a year or two ago.  If conditions were so bad, why did they wait YEARS<br/>
and then swoop down on them right after the father died?<br/>
<br/>
And, don&#39;t take my word for it, read it from someone who lives there.<br/>

To all:<br/>
<br/>
The bulk of this release has been composed over the last two days. As<br/>
you will see, it is our contention that this is a land grab, and the<br/>
the children and the international media attention got in the way.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we just moments ago learned that we were more right than we<br/>
thought and certain members of Bonner County government are<br/>
intimately involved in the foreclosure, seizure and disposal of the<br/>
McGuckin property to pave the way for a real estate development.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, the McGuckins, who the media reported had no water, are<br/>
sitting on the best source of clean water in the area and that source<br/>
is sufficient enough supply several sites with water. We will not<br/>
comment further on this aspect of the story until we have more<br/>
information. But, what we will be reporting soon is the real story<br/>
here and it may be explosive enough to really damage some very big<br/>
players in Bonner County government.<br/>
Stay tuned.<br/>
<br/>
The McGuckin story<br/>
By Don Harkins<br/>
<br/>
The McGuckin story, which, as I will explain, epitomizes both the<br/>
arrogance of county government and the power of network dominant<br/>
media. The story, which on the surface seems like a simple state-<br/>
concern-for-the-welfare-of-children case, is incredibly complex. I<br/>
believe that it boils down to a four (or more) year persecution of an<br/>
unfortunate family that has a really neat, and possibly strategic, 40-<br/>
acre piece of property with a pristine lake. This entire travesty<br/>
would never have made more than a few lines of the local evening news<br/>
if it had not been for one thing: The McGuckin children sicced their<br/>
dogs on the &quot;authorities&quot; and made a stand.<br/>
<br/>
Since the Idaho Observer keeps its office within 17 miles of the<br/>
&quot;standoff&quot; and, since no other media in the area has the editorial<br/>
license to tell the truth and, since millions of people all over the<br/>
world are fixated on understanding the truth behind this surreal<br/>
scenario, I will place things into proper perspective. My wife Ingri<br/>
and I were able to gain the proper perspective by riding with Joann<br/>
McGuckin&#39;s (former) attorney Edgar Steele while he delivered a letter<br/>
that withdrew his representation from this case and when we<br/>
discovered that a bond reduction hearing that had been scheduled for<br/>
4 p.m. had been postponed until Monday, June 4, 2001 amid strange<br/>
circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than turn this into a series of newsstories, this is just<br/>
going to be Don talking. There will be a mixture of facts that can be<br/>
verified by documentation and my own interpretation of events based<br/>
upon my knowledge of the characters involved and other stories that I<br/>
have covered which are connected or related. I will, however, break<br/>
each segment down under a headline to make things easier to explain.<br/>
<br/>
To fully understand the McGuckin story, it would be best to obtain<br/>
copies of the November and May editions of The Idaho Observer wherein<br/>
we reported the christening of the Cutthroat (a 110 foot unmanned<br/>
submarine that is now being used for research in Lake Pend Oreille)<br/>
and the Parkison story wherein another Bonner county family was<br/>
squeezed for several years until they lost their property. I also<br/>
suggest that you obtain a copy of the September, 2000 edition of The<br/>
Spectrum newspaper (1-877-280-2866) wherein some interesting clues<br/>
regarding this region&#39;s importance to sophisticated technology<br/>
research are found.<br/>
<br/>
It appears that the veneer of propriety on the part of the state is<br/>
extremely thin in this case. Now that the &quot;standoff&quot; has ended, it<br/>
will be a matter of simple investigation to prove that the McGuckin&#39;s<br/>
land was stolen from them illegally and that the charges of child<br/>
neglect alleged by Bonner County Prosecutor Phil Robinson were<br/>
fabrications that are not supported by evidence.<br/>
<br/>
Breaking News: &quot;Standoff&quot; has ended<br/>
<br/>
By the evening of June 2, 2001, the standoff ended peacefully and the<br/>
five remaining children have been taken to Bonner General Hospital<br/>
where they were to spend the night. Three persons, including a family<br/>
friend and neighbor whom the children trusted, made contact with the<br/>
children and it was that contact which ultimately led to their<br/>
decision to come out. Bonner County Sheriff Phil Jarvis claims that<br/>
he sent word to the children that they would not be separated if he<br/>
has anything to say about it. The three mediators also gave the kids<br/>
a note from their mother in jail. It is reported that the note<br/>
allegedly from mom was what compelled them to go with &quot;authorities.&quot;<br/>
Jarvis&#39; promise that they would not be separated may not be his to<br/>
keep as the children are now in thecustody of state child welfare<br/>
workers who have made no such promises to the children.<br/>
<br/>
By all reports the children were all in fine shape physically and<br/>
mentally were in good spirits when they left their home.<br/>
The children were taken to the hospital where they would all be given<br/>
physicals. It is also likely that the hospital staff was be ordered<br/>
to administer vaccines to make them current with state recommended<br/>
vaccination regimen. If the children are healthy now and then begin<br/>
to experience adverse reactions to vaccines, I am concerned that the<br/>
mother will somehow be blamed for the delayed reaction of ill health<br/>
and that the introduction of toxic substances directly into their<br/>
blood streams will not be considered as the cause. I am also<br/>
concerned that the &quot;authorities&quot; will, in their attempts to pacify<br/>
the children&#39;s emotional needs, start feeding them a bunch of junk<br/>
food which will exascerbate vaccine-related health complications and<br/>
compromise their psychological equanimnity.<br/>
There is still no word on when Joann McGuckin will be released from<br/>
jail though it appears there is no reason to continue holding her<br/>
because her children are obviously not the victims of neglect as<br/>
alleged in the complaint filed by Bonner County Prosecutor Phil<br/>
Robinson May 29, 2001.<br/>
<br/>
Myths and fabrications:<br/>
<br/>
1.  The children have no food and are eating lilly pad soup. This is<br/>
not true as more than one person reports that the children have<br/>
plenty of food.<br/>
<br/>
2.  The children have no heat. This is north Idaho. They have wood and<br/>
a wood stove.<br/>
<br/>
3.  The children have no electricity. The house has electricity that<br/>
is hooked up and paid for.<br/>
<br/>
4.  The family has 27 vicious and hungry dogs running wild and hunting<br/>
in a pack. The number is probably closer to 15 dogs that are more<br/>
protective than they are vicious.<br/>
<br/>
5.  The children are victims of neglect. Though they may not live in a<br/>
family like yours, these kids are not behaving like neglected kids.<br/>
These kids love each other, their deceased father, their mother and<br/>
their home.<br/>
<br/>
6.  Joann McGuckin spends her money on alcohol. There is no evidence<br/>
of this.<br/>
<br/>
7.  The children are armed. Benjamin said &quot;go get the guns&quot; to start<br/>
this standoff. Since that time nobody has seen them brandishing any<br/>
weapons. Benjamin, however, has allegedly admitted that there were<br/>
five guns in the house.<br/>
<br/>
8.  Joann McGuckin has mental problems and does not trust the<br/>
government. Joann has lost her husband, she has been slipping into<br/>
poverty for the last several years as her husband&#39;s health<br/>
deteriorated and has been in full knowledge that the loss of her home<br/>
was imminent. Intrusive government has not attempted to help her, it<br/>
has been attempted to remove her from the property by a variety of<br/>
means. Then, charges of child neglect are fabricated, she is tricked<br/>
by police into being arrested, she is thrown in  jail and her kids<br/>
decide to defend their home. How would you feel?<br/>
<br/>
9.  The children must be taken into custody for their own protection<br/>
because there is no place else for them to go. A family friend of ten<br/>
years whom the children trust and like, who lives 30 minutes away on<br/>
a 140 acre ranch has offered to take the children in but the state<br/>
will not allow them to because they are not &quot;licensed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
10. Benjamin &quot;gave himself up to authorities.&quot; Benjamin had<br/>
apparently left the house on a recon mission two days previously. He<br/>
was unable to cross the police line and his coming into police<br/>
custody more closely resembles capture than a voluntary surrender.<br/>
Since he was taken into custody, nobody but &quot;authorities&quot; have had<br/>
access to him.<br/>
<br/>
11. The bond reduction hearing was canceled because of a power outage<br/>
in the courthouse. The hearing was to take place at Bonner County<br/>
Jail, not at the courthouse. There was a TV setup at the courthouse<br/>
for media members who were going to watch the hearing from that<br/>
location. There had been no power outage at the courthouse as of 4:20<br/>
p.m. when Ingri and I left. At 3:55 p.m. we learned that Judge Heise<br/>
was still in the building and that Dublic Defender Bryce Powell was<br/>
nowhere to be found.<br/>
<br/>
12. Ed Steele had his license to practice law in Idaho suspended. Ed<br/>
never mentioned such a thing and it does not stand to reason that he<br/>
would volunteer to represent McGuckin in this high profile manner if<br/>
he was going to be prevented from representing her in court. Steele<br/>
said that he has not been informed that he is not longer licensed to<br/>
practice law in Idaho.<br/>
<br/>
13. The children are unhealthy and malnourished. There is no evidence<br/>
to suggest this is true. The children appear to be healthy, vibrant<br/>
and intelligent. Benjamin was given a physical after being taken into<br/>
custody and is reportedly in excellent health. Benjamin reported that<br/>
there is plenty of food and water in the house.<br/>
<br/>
14. The children have been home schooled and taught to be suspicious<br/>
of the government. Both of these things might be true, however the<br/>
media spin is negative where I see nothing but positives. The<br/>
children were smart enough to not be taken into custody by police who<br/>
had tricked their mother into going to jail and had sold their<br/>
property at auction when it appears that the foreclosure, seizure and<br/>
sale of the property was conducted illegally. It would appear that<br/>
being suspicious of government is a survival skill that all children<br/>
should be taught. They are survivors, they are close-knit and they<br/>
have proven to be more capable than most children who attend public<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
15. The father died of malnutrition and dehydration. This may be<br/>
partially true, but persons who suffer for years from the ravages of<br/>
degenerative disease may not feel like eating or drinking the last<br/>
few days or weeks of their lives. It would be absurd to conclude that<br/>
the last four years of his declining health was because he decided to<br/>
starve himself and not drink water.<br/>
<br/>
Steele withdraws from McGuckin case-for now:<br/>
<br/>
SANDPOINT, June 1, 2001-At 2:30 p.m. today Attorney Edgar Steele hand<br/>
delivered a letter to public defender Bryce Powell and Joann McGuckin<br/>
that announced his withdrawal from the case. Steele, who I must say<br/>
is a personal friend of mine, has stated to me that he would rather<br/>
not practice law in the courts of north Idaho because it has been his<br/>
experience that law is not the most important part of the judicial<br/>
equation here. The fact that he decided to try to help this woman and<br/>
her six children was, in my estimation, a purely selfless and noble<br/>
gesture on his part.<br/>
<br/>
Steele had an excellent visit with McGuckin May 31. McGuckin thanked<br/>
Steele for representing her without charge and definitely, according<br/>
to Steele, wanted him to represent her and the children in matters<br/>
not related to Robinson&#39;s criminal complaint. He learned a lot and<br/>
found that there were several areas that he could be of service to<br/>
her because she and her family had been given a raw deal with regard<br/>
to the loss of the property. Powell was representing her on the<br/>
absurd criminal charges of felonious injury to children. Steele was<br/>
up until midnight researching and studying documents pertaining to<br/>
the case and working out a strategy. The following morning he was<br/>
unable to talk to her; she only wanted to communicate with Steele<br/>
through written memoranda and a couple of people friendly to McGuckin<br/>
were suddenly noncommunicative. Steele said that he cannot adequately<br/>
represent her under these conditions. He did tell Ingri and I that he<br/>
left the door open for her, though, and that if she was able to get<br/>
her thoughts together when things calm down, he would be glad to<br/>
reconsider.<br/>
<br/>
Based upon what we can infer from the characters involved, the fact<br/>
that Powell is a young attorney trying to make a living in a tightly<br/>
controlled small town legal environment, that he is very likely in<br/>
way over his head in this case and that he must listen to the local<br/>
power clique to have a future practicing law in Bonner county, it<br/>
would appear that Powell convinced McGuckin to dissuade Steele, an<br/>
extremely competant attorney who cannot be controlled by the local<br/>
power clique, from digging into the injustices that have been done to<br/>
the McGuckins.<br/>
<br/>
After delivering the letter to McGuckin through her jailers, Steele<br/>
was stopped by the news media to give on  camera interviews. In<br/>
anticipation of the bond reduction hearing scheduled to begin at 4<br/>
p.m. (it was at this time 3 p.m.) there were several local and<br/>
national news teams and two satelite trucks waiting around in the<br/>
Bonner County Sheriff&#39;s Department parking lot. Steele very<br/>
eloquently and accurately said several things to the news media that<br/>
would have made all concerned Americans very proud. When asked what<br/>
he thought would be the best resolution of this matter, Steele said<br/>
that McGuckin should be let out of jail immediately so she can go<br/>
home to her kids and the police should go home to their families. He<br/>
also indicated that it was his belief that Bonner County Prosecutor<br/>
Phil Robinson&#39;s charges of child abuse were unfounded and<br/>
demonstrably false.<br/>
<br/>
Bond reduction hearing delayed:<br/>
<br/>
SANDPOINT, June 1, 2001-A bond reduction hearing for Joann McGuckin<br/>
that had been scheduled to take place at the Bonner County Jail at 4<br/>
p.m. here today in the court of Magistrate Judge Heise has been<br/>
postponed until Monday, June 4 because public defender Bryce Powell<br/>
was nowhere to be found. McGuckin, 45, was arrested through deception<br/>
by the Bonner County Sheriff&#39;s Department Tuesday after Bonner County<br/>
Prosecutor Phil Robinson filed a complaint against McGuckin for<br/>
felonious injury to children. McGuckin is being held on $100,000 bond<br/>
though most of the charges Robinson alleged against McGuckin have<br/>
been demonstrated to be false.<br/>
<br/>
Bond is a mechanism that is used to protect the community from the<br/>
accused if they are at risk for fleeing prosecution or pose a danger<br/>
to the community. McGuckin is not a danger to the community and the<br/>
likelihood that she would flee the area and leave her children behind<br/>
is so remote as to be absurd to contemplate. Therefore it would<br/>
appear that $100,000 bond is excessive and put in place to keep her<br/>
in jail so that she does not have the opportunity to speak to the<br/>
press, have unmonitored access to legal counsel or have contact with<br/>
her children.<br/>
<br/>
Local and national media with satellite uplinks were positioned at the<br/>
jail and Court room 2 at the Bonner County Courthouse in anticipation<br/>
of the hearing. Ingri and I were with several other reporters in the<br/>
courthouse at 3:30 p.m. when it was learned that Judge Heise was<br/>
still on site because Powell was nowhere to be found though he was<br/>
well aware of the hearing time, date and location. It was learned<br/>
later that he had been out attempting to talk the children into<br/>
giving themselves up. I believe that he was there doing that, but<br/>
that it was an excuse to not be present at the bond reduction hearing<br/>
at the jail. I believe that his controllers, the county that<br/>
appointed him to represent McGuckin in this case, arranged his not<br/>
being present for the hearing so that they could continue the hearing<br/>
to Monday. I think they wanted a couple days to think, hoping that<br/>
something magical would bring the standoff to an end before Monday.<br/>
The more conspiratorial side of me is concerned that she will be<br/>
psychologically manipulated into saying things that will compromise<br/>
public perception of her in a negative way.<br/>
<br/>
The kids:<br/>
Kathryn, 16, Banjamin, 14, Mary, 13, James, 11, Fred, 9 and Jane, 8<br/>
I have heard several people say that the kids, though sometimes a<br/>
little dirty, are nice, a little shy, but polite, intelligent and<br/>
well spoken. It sounds like these children should be used as poster<br/>
children for the benefits of home schooling rather than being labeled<br/>
as outcasts unfit to function in polite society. I for one, am proud<br/>
of the McGuckin children and hope to meet them some day and tell them<br/>
so.<br/>
<br/>
Conclusions to date:<br/>
<br/>
This is a land grab case not a child abuse case. The kids are fine<br/>
except that their father is dead and the police tricked their mom<br/>
into being arrested on charges of felonious injury to children that<br/>
are either bold faced lies or baseless accusations. In either event<br/>
there is no evidence to support the charges against Joann McGuckin,<br/>
there is no reason for her to be in jail and there is no justification of<br/>
$100,000 bond as she is not s flight risk or a danger to society.<br/>
<br/>
The McGuckin property, which has a homestead exemption and is worth<br/>
nearly $500,000, was seized for $5,000 in back taxes and sold at<br/>
auction for $50,000. It appears that the McGuckins have been under<br/>
attack for at least four years and the intent was to steal their<br/>
property. I personally believe the attack was subtle, and conducted<br/>
with the use of sophisticated technologies that to most people are<br/>
the stuff of science fiction. They became increasingly reclusive, I<br/>
think, because nobody would believe them if they told them what was<br/>
going on and they were afraid that people would think they were<br/>
crazy.<br/>
<br/>
So, the two components of this surrealistic scene is the provably<br/>
illegal seizure and disposal of their property and the provably<br/>
fabricated charges of child abuse and neglect. The veneer is so thin<br/>
that when this thing begins to unravel, the corruption and arrogance<br/>
behind this property theft will become obvious.<br/>
I was a disappointed that though there are millions of people talking<br/>
about this, the public was not represented at the jail or the<br/>
courthouse. The only people on hand were media types. I guess people<br/>
wish to be angered by the events by understanding the issue through<br/>
the eyes of the dominant media.<br/>

&gt;the county they live in.  Particularly if they are homeschooling which is<br/>
&gt;the other &quot;sin&quot; named by CPS!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I for one do not ask for help from the goverment,(my life is none of thier <br/>
business,and if you try to get aide then it would be thier business!) I <br/>
don&#39;t vote,( I know shame on my name :) ), its not a pride thing either, I <br/>
feel I have enough knowledge, experience etc. that if I/ we need <br/>
it(welfare,etc.) I can find the monies by working or trading :) I am very <br/>
independent and thankfully if something is needed it comes along as needed, <br/>
just the way I am and I and my family have done well living this way all my <br/>
life so I am ok with it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Lynda for saying, (typing), what I too felt! Too much media <br/>
coverage and OH MY GOODNESS that poor Mom and her kiddies!<br/>

find themselves without parents and how they survive<br/>
in the family owned remote cabin.  It&#39;s about that<br/>
kind of lifestyle (in case any of you wonder why<br/>
someone would choose to live like that) and it may<br/>
help explain where the arrested mom is &#39;coming from&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you, Lynda. That family is being<br/>
railroaded by some $$ development company.<br/>
