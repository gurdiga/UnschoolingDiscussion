<br/>
yes!!  glad you caught my meaning, any thing but mud is acceptable!  :)<br/>
<br/>
also, i know this has been brought up before, but just a request to try to <br/>
have people cut and paste for replying, or at least be sure that the whole <br/>
piece you are replying to doesnt get sent back.  on someones response, the <br/>
entire digest from the day before got included at the end, making for a very <br/>
loooooong digest!!!!!  thanks everybody.  erin m.</div>
