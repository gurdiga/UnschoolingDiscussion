&lt;&lt; I was asked to explain a comic strip <br/>
featuring Trent Lott and the Ku Klux Klan to my 10yo).  &gt;&gt;<br/>

I do this a lot with my son, 9. He LOVES political cartoons and if he doesn&#39;t <br/>
get it, he always wants me to explain the context. We get old New Yorkers <br/>
from a friend and Quinn and I go cover to cover looking for the comics. We <br/>
sure do cover a lot of ground!<br/>
