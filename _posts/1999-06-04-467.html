<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327960577"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; Lets take a poll, how many of you use algebra in  your jobs???? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just came across this question and would like to answer.  I don&#39;t use<br/>
alegbra very much presently, because I am a full-time Mommy right now.<br/>
	<br/>
Before I had kids though, when I was still working at building my<br/>
career, I did in fact use alegbra in my various jobs:  drafter, artist,<br/>
graphic illustrator(map maker), and archaoelogical aide(surverying). <br/>
Used algebra in all of those occupations.  <br/>
<br/>
Btw, I love math, especially algebra and geometry.  This is fun to me. <br/>
weird, maybe?  I don&#39;t know, but I have been this way from the<br/>
beginning(not even school turned me off to it):).<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

figure the height of the house, square footage of paint covered by a gallon <br/>
and how many gallons you will need to cover the house.  Algebra isn&#39;t hard if <br/>
we don&#39;t think in terms of Formulas and Theorums.  If we just think of terms <br/>
in I have THIS info, I need THIS info to get to THIS info, THAT is Higher <br/>
Math!!<br/>
