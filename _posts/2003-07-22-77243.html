<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My dh put some hinge thingys on the door to make ours close automatically.<br/>
They went<br/>
out after a couple of years of use and now we all have to remember to close<br/>
the door.<br/>
It was nice when the door would just swing shut by itself (of course I can&#39;t<br/>
tell you how<br/>
many times the door didn&#39;t shut all the way and we would come home and the<br/>
dog<br/>
would be in the house LOL). Anyhow, it was and still would be a very good<br/>
solution<br/>
to keeping the door closed as it appears my entire family was born in a<br/>
barn, myself included &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
