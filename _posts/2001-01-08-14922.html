<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097884227">I at first told relatives that we were looking into a form of education called Constructivism ( go<br/>
to www.free-ed.com colledge of early childhood education and look up methods of learning but<br/>
basically it means to build on what you already know!) I carefully explained it to them and<br/>
incorporated the portfolio review system as our assessment and I can share the portfolio with them<br/>
if they would like to see it. (none have been that interested so far in sitting down to review the<br/>
portfolio) I have kept a portfolio anyway each year since there birth even when they were in PS.<br/>
When questioned further I have offered them books about Piagets Developmental Theory (which<br/>
basically say&#39;s that when they are developmentally ready to do something they will)and evidence of<br/>
my chilrens progress. (I use Childrens skills Test from virtual knowledge as well as the<br/>
portfolio)<br/>
Another unschooling theory is Brain Based Learning You can take a course on that at<br/>
www.free-ed.com also. So many educational Theories lend themselve more to unschooling more than<br/>
traditional schooling that it is no wonder learning slows as children progress in PS. But it is<br/>
mopre important to prove it to yourself by finding many sources of evidence then you can defend it<br/>
to others.<br/>
My mother is self taught She has a 8th grade education but runs her own business. <br/>
My father in law Graduated highschool only with no further education he wrote the .08 alcohol law<br/>
that Maine has. He is first to admit that his hischool diploma had nothing to do with his success.<br/>
I got MY First classical Music interest from Bugs Bunny and Road runner.<br/>
I learned about Language arts Multiplication and US History from School House Rock not from the<br/>
public school system where I was teased for being different and not complying with the so called<br/>
social system rules. (I loved to read and draw and cared about others feelings) I learned at home<br/>
but my drunk parents used the PS for cheap daycare.<br/>

<br>
<br>My name is Dawn and I just subscribed to this loop today. &nbsp;I have many 
<br>questions about unschooling. &nbsp;I just began to homeschool my ds who is 8 on 
<br>November 1st. &nbsp;He has Add and is highly gifted (IQ165) and school was 
<br>horrific. &nbsp;He was bored and basically tortured and teased daily by kids and 
<br>the so-called &quot;adults&quot; who didnt understand him or care to try. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I am very interested in unschooling but I am not sure how to implement it 
<br>correctly. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Let me give you a quik rundown of what we do now:
<br>
<br>I went to Barnes &amp; Noble &amp; bought a bunch of workbooks (with his help) and we 
<br>pretty much use them intermittently as a gauge of where he is. &nbsp;He uses many 
<br>computer programs, (Carmen Sandiego Usa &amp; World, Jupstart, Math Blaster) and 
<br>other learning devices such as Turbo Twist math. &nbsp;We also use lots of books, 
<br>some we already had, some given as gifts and library books. &nbsp;I have let him 
<br>choose the direction with those materials. &nbsp;However, if I dont direct him in 
<br>some way with guidelines, he would spend the day playing nintendo and game 
<br>boy with pokemon games. &nbsp;For example, today he told me he was going to read 
<br>(yeah!) but he chose reading the Pokemon Silver handbook. &nbsp;I gently told him 
<br>I would like to see him read a real book - he resisted - but then went and 
<br>got a book on ships.
<br>
<br>I guess I am just looking for some feedback from other moms in the same boat, 
<br>clarification of the day to day of unschooling, and any other advice and web 
<br>sites you think could help me and my son! &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Thank you - Dawn

Hi Dawn,<br/>
<br/>
I am sure some people on this list would say that in order to unschool you <br/>
would have to allow him to play Nintendo all day if he chose to. And even I <br/>
see nothing wrong with an 8yo reading the Pokemon Silver Handbook. I&#39;m <br/>
guessing it&#39;s not easy reading, although I would want there to be variety in <br/>
what my child read. Everyone has their own definition of unschooling <br/>
<br/>
What have you read about unschooling? I can recommend the Unschooling <br/>
Handbook and books by John Holt, as well as And the Skylark Sings with Me. <br/>
The last one isn&#39;t complete unschooling but applies. I&#39;m sure other people <br/>
here can recommend lots of others. My main advice is not to worry. Your son <br/>
is still interested in learning and you guys will find your way to the <br/>
process that works best for you. Continue to bring interesting books and <br/>
supplies into the house and to take him out into the community to see what <br/>
interests him. If he enjoys the workbooks, they are fine, too. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and enjoy!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724694061">&quot;he chose reading the Pokemon Silver handbook&quot;<br/>
Whatever you do, don&#39;t discourage a child from<br/>
reading, whatever the book is (in reason, of course).<br/>
Would you read something that didn&#39;t interest you? Not<br/>
me, atleast not more than a page or 2 and I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
retain any of it. While in PS, my son was told to<br/>
&quot;choose other topics to read, besides sports&quot; Well, he<br/>
has never read as much as he used to. They stomped on<br/>
his  ambition. Let him read Pokemon, he&#39;ll move onto<br/>
other things, and Pokemon isnt exactly &quot;see Jane run&quot;.<br/>
There are some really tough words in those books. I&#39;m<br/>
not trying to chew you out or anything, I just know<br/>
what ps did to my sons reading for pleasure habit.<br/>
Destroyed it, and it&#39;s still not the way it used to<br/>
be.<br/>

<br>From reading the rest of your note, it sounds like you&#39;re doing fine to me. &nbsp;<br>You know your child best and know what works (or will figure it out, I&#39;m <br>sure). &nbsp;Pokemon or not -- reading is great. &nbsp;We are use a wide variety of <br>more or less unschool-y things as we decide we need them. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Example -- my son woke up one day at age 4 1/2 and knew how to read. &nbsp;At <br>least that&#39;s the way it seems.
<br>
<br>My daughter, otoh, is 6 yo and frustrated that she can&#39;t read yet. &nbsp;&quot;Everyone <br>but me knows how to read Mom and I can&#39;t play this game because I can&#39;t read <br>the questions!&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;So, we talked about it a little, and I suggested the 100 <br>Easy Lessons book would be something we could try but we would have to <br>actually sit down and do it together on a regular basis, etc. &nbsp;She thinks <br>that is great!! &nbsp;(So far anyway.) &nbsp;
<br>
<br>So, we do what works or what is needed.
<br>
<br>And it sounds like you have rescued your son from a bad situation at school <br>and will do fine on figuring out where to go from here. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Have fun!!

I see the same thing happening to my 9yo cousin. His 6yo brother is an <br/>
advanced reader reads a variety of materials. Chris, the 9yo, really prefers <br/>
nonfiction. He usually chooses books about reptiles, amphibians, sharks, etc. <br/>
He finds fiction reading to be a chore. This has been seen as a problem. I <br/>
know a great many people, mostly men, who read non-fiction exclusively, but I <br/>
don&#39;t see why that would be considered to be a negative trait. Think of all <br/>
the information available, even if he never reads Shakespeare.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-514654038">Hi Dawn.  Other people will tell you this.  They probably already <br/>
have.  But I think it&#39;s worth telling again.  When people leave the <br/>
system of institutional school, either ps, or private or even school-<br/>
at-home, most of them need to deschool.  Some of them do this <br/>
gradually, letting go of a little structure here and there until they <br/>
simply don&#39;t use it anymore.  Others, especially those more <br/>
damaged by a system which they just don&#39;t fit, need to deschool <br/>
&#39;cold turkey.&#39;  (appropriate, for the time of year, huh?  *grin*)  And <br/>
I&#39;m talking about parents, too, sometimes (I know in my case) <br/>
much more than the children.  <br/>
<br/>
Basically, this means that a fallow period is necessary, with no <br/>
expectations on anyone&#39;s side, some people suggest 6 months, <br/>
som a year, like a &#39;trial period&#39; when anything goes.  Some children <br/>
will refuse to do anything which even whiffs of school, your son is <br/>
reading, at least!  And there are plenty of Pokemon fans out there <br/>
(adult ones, I mean) who can tell you the value of reading a <br/>
Pokemon book, in fact, one of the tenets of unschooling, I think, is <br/>
that there&#39;s no such thing as an &#39;unreal&#39; book (ie one which is not <br/>
&#39;real&#39;)  <br/>
<br/>
OK, I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m sounding preachy, but you both sound normal!  <br/>
He needs to do what ne needs to do, and only he knows that.  You <br/>
are used to perceiving value in only certain kinds of learning, <br/>
knowledge, which comes from schooling.  So take the time out, <br/>
both of you, and deschool.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007846377">Welcome Dawn,<br/>
<br/>
For me, that your son wants to read anything at all is brilliant child-led <br/>
learning. As adults we decide what and when we want to read and often this <br/>
very rarely includes real books. I am assuming here you define real as <br/>
something that is not rather than something that is; ie not a comic, not a <br/>
pamphlet, not a Gameboy instruction book, not the instructions to the new <br/>
vcr. Can you see where I&#39;m going with this? It is very easy to feel one is <br/>
failing one&#39;s children by not including directions and guidelines in their <br/>
learning, but pleased be reassured, children will learn whatever! <br/>
<br/>
I could go on at great length about the pluses of trusting your son to decide <br/>
his own interests and thus education, but there are better writers than I who <br/>
have already done this! Just keep calm and know that by providing your son <br/>
the means to learn (resources he needs, trips to the library, field trips <br/>
etc.) he will. Also remember, he will not learn those things he feels he does <br/>
not need. I for one have never felt compelled to ubderstand the workings of <br/>
my washing machine, but I do know how to look in the telephone directory, <br/>
find an engineer and make a call.<br/>
<br/>
Keep with it, you have already done the hard bit!<br/>

  game boy game! &nbsp;To me <br>that didnt qualify as a &quot;book&quot;. &nbsp;I do not 
  want to squash his desire to read ( <br>i dont think I could, he does love it 
  so much) so I did let him read that <br>Pokemon pamphlet in the car when we 
  went do errands. &nbsp;The 1/2 hour seemed to <br>satisfy! &nbsp; 
  <br><br>Thank you for the book reccomendations. &nbsp;I have read The 
  Homeschooling Book <br>of Answers and Homeschooling for Excellence, the latter 
  by the Colfaxs&#39;. &nbsp;I <br>am definitely going to read John Holt this month.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796213732">Ok, well, my son is only 5 but &quot;old for his age&quot;, I&#39;m<br/>
told, -relating to adults more than he does to other<br/>
five year olds(I think he thinks he is one,<br/>
actually)and VERY much &quot;ADD&quot; ish.(I say &quot;ish, cuz he<br/>
hasn&#39;t been officially &quot;diagnosed&quot;, though, cuz I<br/>
prefer to expose him to the medical community as very<br/>
very little as possible, but his dad has, and it runs<br/>
in his family, plus it&#39;s obvious to me, as his mom.). <br/>
<br/>
So even to alot of homeschoolers, the way we do things<br/>
around here, (and plan on continuing to do things,<br/>
too, btw), is not very easily swallowed. He<br/>
concentrates better when there is at least two or more<br/>
things going on usually. For example, he does any<br/>
writing in his &quot;schoolwork books&quot;(his own name for his<br/>
little coloring/workbooks)much better and actually<br/>
gets it faster when I have PBS going in the background<br/>
(we love wishbone, zaboomafoo,between the lions,<br/>
reading rainbow, but sadly the kids aren&#39;t very into<br/>
sesame street), or am reading out loud or something,<br/>
so there is never a quiet sitting down learning moment<br/>
here, except at bedtimes, when we read. BUT the only<br/>
thing he just sits completely still for and gets<br/>
engrossed in is the computer, and nintendo. (and the<br/>
occasional really interesting show)I take advantage of<br/>
this<br/>
and have provided him with lots of games to choose<br/>
from, we visit Nickjr.com alot and they have alot of<br/>
cool games there to learn from, too. There are alot of<br/>
sites with educational &quot;games&quot; and activities on them<br/>
for older kids, (I think mamamedia.com is one, and<br/>
pbs.org has lots of things that he will surely find<br/>
interesting -like ZOOM) that he wants to do, but just<br/>
isn&#39;t ready for yet. If your son is into video games<br/>
what I would do is try to use that as a learning tool.<br/>
Get into it with him and try to find some video games<br/>
that involve something other than attacking another<br/>
player or something like that. (Tough to do, but still<br/>
possible) Then, play it WITH him. and while your<br/>
playing, try to find things in the game to talk to him<br/>
about. Ex: My son is currently obsessed with<br/>
SuperMarioWorld on his Super Nintendo, and would be<br/>
perfectly content playing it by himself allllllll day,<br/>
-of course I don&#39;t let him&lt;g&gt;- but he has soooo much<br/>
more fun if I go play it with him and he is very into<br/>
math right now and so while I&#39;m playing a level or<br/>
walking in between &quot;worlds&quot; to go get more &quot;free men&quot;<br/>
or something, I&#39;ll start quizzing him with things like<br/>
&quot;if we had 15 men, but then we died 4 times, how many<br/>
men would we have left, then?&quot; then &quot;how many more<br/>
coins do we need until we have 100?&quot; he will get it<br/>
right away, but if I were to do the same problem with<br/>
blocks or on paper, he would be distracted and not be<br/>
able to sit still long enough to figure it out. Plus,<br/>
-and alot of people may not agree with me here- but I<br/>
think that him playing the video game is actually GOOD<br/>
for him, provided he isn&#39;t playing something I feel<br/>
would be destructive for him --he isn&#39;t allowed to<br/>
play violent games of any sort, or shooting games,<br/>
which only leaves ones that require him to use his<br/>
problem solving skills, logic, CONCENTRATION, and<br/>
persistance if he wants to play at all. And the<br/>
computer too, helps so much in the hand-eye<br/>
coordination department, and following instructions,<br/>
cuz unlike adults and the instructions we give, the<br/>
games on the computer really will not work at all<br/>
unless you pay attention to the directions and follow<br/>
them exactly.Hope that long winded (ala bobbie) reply<br/>
is somewhat helpful. <br/>
Bobbie <br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, and as for reading, my son as of late has<br/>
been very into the whole superhero scene, and has<br/>
always loved knights and swords and archery, etc. So<br/>
the last two books I bought him (goodwill) were a<br/>
Spiderman story book, with lots of full page bright<br/>
pictures and an X-men story/comic book, that at the<br/>
beginning and end has a picture of each hero and their<br/>
name under it, which he, on his own, has taken to<br/>
sounding out and trying to read. Maybe find a book, or<br/>
help him find one, at the library that is an actual<br/>
&quot;real book&quot; (maybe start with a fictional-yet<br/>
educational- illustrated chapter book of some sort),<br/>
but has some of the same appeal that pokemon has to<br/>
him. If he thinks real books are just as exciting as<br/>
his pokemon handbook, then he may take to it more<br/>
easily. Just a thought.<br/>

<br>one I didnt get! &nbsp;&nbsp;I have only just begun to hs (since nov) and unschool 
<br>since jan! &nbsp;After my 8 yo son eats breakfast he goes to pick out what he 
<br>wants to do (he would play nintendo/game boy all day also but that has always 
<br>been limited in our house so...) He will either watch national geographic 
<br>channel (pbs bores him now), read a book, lots of encyclopedia types or 
<br>classical fiction, or whatever else, sometimes he will choose to do 
<br>workbooks, crossword puzzles, Turbo Twist Math, and we always work our way 
<br>over to the computer. &nbsp;There he will do any number of things, from Math 
<br>Blaster, Carmen Sandiego USA and World, Oregon Trail, Stratego, ClueFinders 
<br>or JumpStart. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>We have posters around our dining room of the Periodic table and the human 
<br>skeleton and facts about the solar system which somehow he learning everthing 
<br>about even though I never see him doing it. &nbsp;By late afternoon he will watch 
<br>a few of &nbsp;what I call strictly entertainment type cartoons etc and then we 
<br>kind of switch into more leisure type activities. &nbsp;ie game boy, nintendo, 
<br>yahtzee etc. &nbsp;Or more computer games - after dinner - the same. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>This has been working well for us. &nbsp;He is learning an amazing amount of 
<br>material in huge gulps that he never would be doing at public school.
<br>
<br>I hope this helps, whomever was asking -
