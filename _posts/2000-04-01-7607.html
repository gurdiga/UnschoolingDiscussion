<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401580419">Hi!  I&#39;m Kyle and my wife is Paula.  We have two children, Steven 13<br/>
and Kayla 9.  We have been homeschooling now for six yrs. or I guess I<br/>
should say conducting school at home.  We just started unschooling about<br/>
three weeks ago. I have made feeble attempts at it in the past but  have<br/>
had a hard time turning over the reigns of control.  Ok, Ok, I&#39;m still<br/>
struggling with that one but am learning to trust my children more<br/>
everyday.  I&#39;ve read all of John Holts books subscribe to GWS and HEM<br/>
and believe in the homeschooling or natural learning philosophy with al<br/>
of my being, but believing and doing are to totally different things.<br/>
So here we are now trying to put legs to our beliefs.  <br/>
    Being the primary domestic engineer for the past six years I would<br/>
love to here from any other homedads if there are any of you out there. <br/>
Kyle</div>
