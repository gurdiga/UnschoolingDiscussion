<div><em><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="2">I have been to both 
chiropractor and massage therapy as well and loved the massage alot more I have 
a hip that bothers me alot!!! especially during and after pregnancies and the 
chiropractor would put it back and it would go right back out the massage 
therapist put it back in place and worked the muscles around it and it stayed 
for over a year and was just a much greater relief!!</font></em></div>

    <blockquote cite type="cite">As everyone is talking about Chiropractic 
        care all I think about is why not Massage Therapy, less straining on 
        your system.&nbsp; I used to go to a chiropractor but it bothered me 
        always hearing things popping when you get adjusted.&nbsp; My back had 
        been bothering me and I decided to try massage therapy.&nbsp; I will 
        never go back to a chiropractor unless extremely needed.&nbsp; I felt 10 
        times better after therapy and sooooo relaxed.&nbsp; It changes your 
        mood and it helps get rid of the toxins that are being held in your 
        lymph nodes.&nbsp; It also helps with headaches and even if your are 
        sick.&nbsp; There is a lot to massage therapy and I am just starting to 
        learn all of the benefits from it.&nbsp; </blockquote></font></blockquote>
