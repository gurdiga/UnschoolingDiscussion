 </span></blockquote>This is so eloquently put Debra. My great-grandmother lived to 100 and I<br/>
knew her all my life. I often thought about these same things and talked<br/>
with her about them - what life is like when you&#39;re born in  a sod house on<br/>
the prairies of South Dakota and live to see a man rocket up to the moon and<br/>
walk around. She was a woman of great wisdom and heart and you&#39;re right that<br/>
we have no idea what we, or our children, will face in our lifetimes so it<br/>
is a great gift to give them the ability to learn, grow, and adapt to<br/>
whatever circumstances they may find themselves in.<br/>
I also often think of my grandmother&#39;s experiences in terms of the<br/>
&quot;socialization&quot; question that always seems to crop up when you talk about<br/>
homeschooling. She was raised many miles from her nearest neighbors, with<br/>
very few children her own age to &quot;socialize&quot; with, other than her siblings.<br/>
Yet she was an amazingly social woman, active in her church and charities up<br/>
until her death. I think surface qualities like &quot;socialization&quot; have<br/>
replaced deeper qualities like values in our society. It&#39;s a great gift to<br/>
be able to reach for what is truly meaningful and hold that as a guiding<br/>
light.<br/>

**Oh Robin, now you&#39;ve gone and made me miss *my* grandmother! (who lived to<br/>
be 97) It&#39;s okay...it&#39;s a &quot;good&quot; kind of heartache.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was already all touched by Debra&#39;s post and was<br/>
saving my reply but then this afterwards took the<br/>
cake. Very lovely thought, and beautifully put, Robin.<br/>
My great grandmother lived to be 104, and I didn&#39;t<br/>
know her that well, she died when I was still very<br/>
young, but I have thought about that alot, especially<br/>
when doing my family tree, and how most of my family<br/>
were living on a prairie somewhere, (heeh, straight<br/>
out of Little House on the Prairie types) and they<br/>
were all perfectly nice &quot;sociable&quot; people, and passed<br/>
it on. My ex husband said to me recently -regarding<br/>
the kids being unschooled- that they would be socially<br/>
screwed up then, cuz we were, and we were homeschooled<br/>
(we met in 3rd grade at a private school)...I maintain<br/>
that any social problems we had had nothing to do with<br/>
being homeschooled, but ideas about &quot;socializing&quot; that<br/>
were fed to us. My kids don&#39;t have any problem making<br/>
friends thus far, as long as they put what &quot;values&quot;<br/>
they do know into practice. They probably would much<br/>
rather play with some of the kids from *back in the<br/>
day* that were living on a prairie somewhere and being<br/>
taught at home how to grow into a loving good adult<br/>
someday. le sigh.<br/>
