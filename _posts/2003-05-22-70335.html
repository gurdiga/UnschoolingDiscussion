I think that varies with every group.  Both homeschool groups I am in are <br/>
very &quot;school at home&quot; we don&#39;t participate in the &quot;classes&quot; they have but my boys <br/>
love both play groups.  You usually find a lot of homeschool group functions <br/>
are in the afternoon because they all must do &quot;school&quot; in the morning.  Work <br/>
before play and all that. We don&#39;t get up early either but have plenty of time <br/>
before play group.  And I find that the first few times a group meets they <br/>
talk about curriculum.  Then everyone knows each other and that talk goes away.  <br/>
<br/>
I explain that I am an unschooler when asked, they ask a few questions, then <br/>
that is it.  No one here looks down on me, they look at me like an endangered <br/>
species or something.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts.<br/>

activities then it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
If the focus is support for how difficult homeschooling can be, you&#39;d be a<br/>
irritation they&#39;d rather would go away since you&#39;d be sitting there, living<br/>
example that all the problems they&#39;re burdened with aren&#39;t necessary to<br/>
shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
You could try alternative type stores, food coops, health food stores and so<br/>
on. Check with the La Leche League.<br/>
<br/>
Or start you own :-)<br/>

<br/>
Ask your librarian.   She&#39;s likely to know other homeschoolers in your<br/>
area, even if there isn&#39;t a support group. <br/>
<br/>
***Is a regular homeschool group ok if we want to focus on unschooling.<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
That depends on the group.  Some groups get together for play time, form<br/>
lego clubs or what ever and are fun and social kinds of clubs.   Some<br/>
schedule workshop kinds of things where there are classes and it&#39;s kind<br/>
of schooly.   <br/>
<br/>
***Would they look badly upon us. Since we aren&#39;t getting up at 8am <br/>
having breakfast, working on certain subjects and having a strict <br/>
schedule?***<br/>
<br/>
Again, it depends.  If they are all school at home types that might be<br/>
weird.  <br/>
You don&#39;t have to stay at a group that doesn&#39;t suit you.   If you find it<br/>
doesn&#39;t, start your own!  If a group is rigid there are probably others<br/>
who didn&#39;t fit in and would be happy to have another choice.<br/>

homeschoolers to get together with for social activities (and maybe field<br/>

your community.  (Well, we&#39;ve got a mum on the Canadian list who is always<br/>
trying to get other homeschoolers to move to her community.  She lives *way,<br/>
way, way* up in the north of Saskachewan.)<br/>

&lt;&lt;Does anyone have any suggestions on finding a support group locally<br/>
to me. I have been looking for quite a while now with no luck.. I can<br/>
find them in surrounding counties but I would like for my son to meet<br/>
kids who are close by.<br/>

Would they look badly upon us. Since we aren&#39;t getting up at 8am<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If you really can&#39;t find a support group in your area that you are happy<br/>
with, maybe try and start one of your own. Could be others out there feeling<br/>
the same way!<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t found any other unschoolers in my local area and have also tried<br/>
starting my own group to no avail. So I just get together with other<br/>
homeschoolers. I belong to 2 local support groups. One I&#39;ve been a long<br/>
standing member of and feel very comfortable around everyone. I have never<br/>
been made to feel out of place for being the only unschooler at the<br/>
functions I go to. The other group I haven&#39;t actually had a chance to<br/>
involve myself with yet. They do a lot of very schooly things but say they<br/>
are all inclusive. So far they don&#39;t know I am an unschooler and I&#39;ll see<br/>
how that goes if I ever get together with them.<br/>
<br/>
And yes the only problem I do run into is when scheduled field trips start<br/>
way too early for us. If it&#39;s something they kids really want to go to, we<br/>
manage. Some stuff is just not worth it to them. If it&#39;s something we want<br/>
to do, I&#39;ll schedule a field trip of my own at our own time. It all works<br/>
out well so far for us.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This has been hard for us at times.  We attend hs<br/>
 </span></blockquote>support groups/classes because that&#39;s how the kids get<br/>
to know each other.  Sometimes it&#39;s fine, but I often<br/>
do feel &quot;different&quot; from a lot of the other moms. <br/>
Maybe I&#39;m paranoid, but I sense a lot of them think we<br/>
aren&#39;t &quot;serious&quot; homeschoolers because of our relaxed<br/>
way of doing things.  <br/>
I also feel like they aren&#39;t really very interested in<br/>
learning about unschooling--it doesn&#39;t fit in with<br/>
their academic model, so they ignore it.  <br/>
I have found a few like-minded families, and that has<br/>
made all the difference. <br/>
I would say, yes, check out whatever groups are in<br/>
your area...it can take some time to find out where<br/>
people are coming from.  Also, some of my kid&#39;s best<br/>
friends are very structured hsers--so don&#39;t restrict yourself!<br/>
