<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833428415">I&#39;m pleased to see mention of homeschooling and depression.  I believe that <br/>
depression is quite common in women and, as I&#39;m trying to connect with <br/>
others who experience this, I&#39;m finding that there are many depressed hs <br/>
mothers.<br/>
<br/>
Clinical depression and the cycles of it can be unpredicatable, but it <br/>
normally is not how people who experience depression are 24/7/365.  If we&#39;re <br/>
in this unschooling for the hundreds of reasons that my family chooses it, <br/>
it is not the driving force behind our decisions.  Yes, it does play a part. <br/>
  At times, it IS life for us.<br/>
<br/>
We live in a through away society that seems to lack respect for human life <br/>
and all of the conditions of it.  Isn&#39;t part of our hs experience to teach <br/>
our children how to love, grow and nurture in a variety of &quot;real-life&quot; <br/>
situations?  I feel confident when I say that my 3 children have developed a <br/>
great deal of compassion and understanding when Mom is depressed.  They are <br/>
amazing and loving people who know that we all have good days, bad days and <br/>
some in between.<br/>
<br/>
Who knows how many public school or private school teachers or <br/>
administrators suffer from this disease?  I&#39;d be interested in a statistic.  <br/>
Or for that matter, Sunday school teachers, Scout leaders, intramurals <br/>
coaches, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
Depression has such a bad rap.  And speaking from a lifetime of experience, <br/>
it truly is a horrible, debilitating disease that can take a life or destroy <br/>
a family.  The advice being given on the message boards, I believe, is right <br/>
on the money; love and compassion, time, help and understanding can make a <br/>
world of difference for the whole family.  I&#39;d also like to say that there <br/>
are many other debilitating diseases and conditions out there, but people <br/>
who suffer from them should not be labelled possibly &quot;unfit&quot; or &quot;unable&quot; to <br/>
hs their children.<br/>
<br/>
I have to laugh at the question, &quot;Is it unschooling or laziness?&quot;  I ask <br/>
myself that very thing regularly.  It is just so incredibly different than <br/>
the model of schooling most of us know.  I&#39;m pretty sure that most people I <br/>
know would consider unschooling shear laziness.  I always say &quot;the proof is <br/>
in the pudding&quot;.  It is a shame that there are hs families out there that <br/>
are seen as raising uncontrollable children or not educating them properly.  <br/>
Take a look at their ps counterparts; uncontrollable? uneducated?  I would <br/>
suppose that&#39;s part of the reason we all choose to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
I have to bring up the phone call I received from a very close friend last <br/>
night.  She wanted to know if I was watching 20/20 Downtown because there <br/>
was a homeschooling family featured.  She wasn&#39;t sure, but she thought that <br/>
the gist of the story was going to be something crazy happening with the <br/>
father of the homeschoolers.  Curiousity got the better of me and I tuned <br/>
in.  What a piece of pointless (in terms of homeschooling) journalism.  The <br/>
father was allegedly outrageously abusive to the children and when the <br/>
authorities where called by a public school teacher, that&#39;s when the father <br/>
took them out of ps and homeschooled them.  I quickly phoned my friend to <br/>
see if maybe somehow I missed the point of this piece.  I laughed about the <br/>
reality  of our society is that practically all of the abusive or unfit <br/>
parents send their kids to public school, not the other way around!  Yes, <br/>
yes, yes there are exceptions to every rule, as we all know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for hearing me out and letting me get some of this off of my chest!<br/>
<br/>
Peace and blessings,<br/>
<br/>
