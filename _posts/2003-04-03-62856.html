<div id="ygrps-yiv-459766375">From: &quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:skreams@...">skreams@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I keep hearing about rescue remedy.  To be honest, I just don&#39;t get it<br/>
(and if someone could explain to me why it&#39;s supposed to work I&#39;d<br/>
appreciate it), but my 6 yo is having a hard time lately, and I&#39;d like<br/>
to give it a shot.  I see that there are drops, a cream and a spray.<br/>
What form do you recommend? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I don&#39;t know about this stuff but I do have some recent experience with<br/>
homepathic remedies. I&#39;ve been listening to a few here just rave about the<br/>
remedies. It&#39;s been suggested many times from colds to my kids crying and<br/>
being angry. Well I had a bad experience with the remedies last Dec. when my<br/>
kids were sick for the umpteenth time and I was at my wits end. Didn&#39;t know<br/>
enough about the stuff and obviously the lady at the store gave us the wrong<br/>
thing because it was a total waste. Well I decided I wanted to try this<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
When I went the bookstore to get the kids some body and sex books, I picked<br/>
up a homeopathic book. I read it from cover to cover and also did some<br/>
reseatch on the net. After feeling confident, I headed out for the local GNC<br/>
and picked up $40.00 worth of remedies. Covered just about everything in our<br/>
family. Only thing I didn&#39;t find was something for Joe&#39;s pain recently from<br/>
a disc problem.<br/>
<br/>
So I started to give Sierra something and also something else I picked up as<br/>
we both have eczema. Two different remedies. I used no cortisone cream as<br/>
usual and both of us have healed up almost completely within 3 days.<br/>
<br/>
The other afternoon, day before park day, Alyssa wasn&#39;t looking right. I<br/>
asked what ws wrong and she complained about her nose. I felt her forehead<br/>
and she was hot. Figures, right before park day. So I grabbed one of the<br/>
remedies I got, gave her a dose and later another. She made park day all day<br/>
yesterday and has been fine ever since. In fact she&#39;s asking me to take<br/>
more. &lt;bg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sierra was in the shower the other day along with a lizard. She totally<br/>
freaked. And when it comes to unexpected bugs or lizards, it&#39;s not just a<br/>
screaming thing, she totally loses it. I gave her another remedy I picked up<br/>
and she calmed right down wnough so she could finish her shower.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Joseph accidently closed his door on Alyssa&#39;s fingers. She was<br/>
screaming. I gave her remedy, she calmed down and fell asleep in my arms. I<br/>
put her to bed, it was about 10:10 p.m., way earlier than usual. She woke up<br/>
this morning at 10:45 not even knowing which hand was injured last night.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m almost afraid to say this stuff is wonderufl. I keep thinking it&#39;s a<br/>
fluke!!! But I figured out something I got for something else is perfect for<br/>
Joseph&#39;s anger problems. He had 3 episodes yesterday and I am going to see<br/>
if this helps him with that. I&#39;m a believer.<br/>
