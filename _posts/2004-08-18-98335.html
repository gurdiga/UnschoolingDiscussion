<div id="ygrps-yiv-481790222">Okay... I understand a lot of what you are saying about how a child will desire to see something when told he/she &quot;can&#39;t&quot;, and the sneakiness that can develop from it.  At the same time, it seems that as a parent I am supposed to protect (for lack of a better word at the moment) my child&#39;s emotions, etc.  Not hide, shelter, keep them ignorant of things, but not put images and situations in his/her head that I know disturb him/her just for the sake of being able to watch one particular movie.  It would seem like a lot of responsibility placed on a child - almost like one would be saying &quot;Well... you did choose it yourself...&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
What DO you do then?  When your son or daughter asks to see something he/she has heard of and you know there are parts that he/she will be upset at seeing, what do you do?  Is there a way to inform them, still allow them choice, and NOT come out sounding judgemental, etc?? <br/>

Brent and I rented Kill Bill last week.  We watched it together on Tuesday<br/>
night and loved it.  While we were discussing the movie on Wednesday, Sarah<br/>
(13) said she&#39;d like to watch it.  I hesitated for a minute and then<br/>
explained to her that the movie included a lot of bloody scenes (she&#39;s been<br/>
sensitive to this in the past).  I described a few of the scenes for her<br/>
(heads and limbs getting sliced off) and also told her about the cool fight<br/>
scenes.  Sarah is very interested in martial arts and sword fighting, so I<br/>
knew there were parts of the movie she would enjoy.  She decided she&#39;d like<br/>
to see the sword fights, so we sat down and watched the movie together.  She<br/>
held the remote control and decided to fast forward through a few of the<br/>
bloodier things, but overall she enjoyed the movie and was glad she watched<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
We rented Kill Bill 2 a couple of days later and she enjoyed that one a lot<br/>
more.  It still contained some cool martial arts/fight scenes, but didn&#39;t<br/>
have half of the bloodiness that Volume 1 did.<br/>

<br/>
I talk about it. I tell them what I&#39;ve heard about it.<br/>
We say &quot;wait til it&#39;s on DVD&quot; lately.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe they just want to see some parts, and not the whole thing, or not the <br/>
gory parts.<br/>
<br/>
My husband warned me away from Pulp Fiction eleven or twelve years ago.   <br/>
When I saw it lately I knew why he had, and agreed with him.  When I had little <br/>
kids I was extra sensitive to violence, especially involving families or <br/>
children or parents of children.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember what made me want to watch it.  Marty talked about it, <br/>
maybe.  I guess he had seen it somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Now I could handle it.  Then it would&#39;ve been too rough.<br/>
<br/>
Because we&#39;re not arbitrary, and the recommendations have to do with that <br/>
person, not with all people of that age, the kids really listen to us.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re careful, yeah.  Maybe.<br/>
Or you just try to to better then next time when you fail.<br/>

What a good point! Now there&#39;s a really good idea many of us might have <br/>
thought of, but maybe not at first.<br/>
