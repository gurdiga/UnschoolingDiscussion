<div id="ygrps-yiv-129743254">The summer issue of the Self-University Newsletter is available at<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.autodidactic.com/selfnews.htm">http://www.autodidactic.com/selfnews.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
In this issue Charles Hayes offers an interesting essay on the <br/>
age-old debate about the human touch vs. technology. He writes: &quot;I <br/>
believe very strongly that digitized computer and interactive media <br/>
technology, networked via groups whose members maintain a high <br/>
interest in the subject matter, will one day make the current debate <br/>
about the value of learning online seem downright silly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Charles outlines his well-reasoned concerns about future technology, <br/>
shares some of his own experiences with teachers and learning, <br/>
includes some astute observations about homeschooling, and offers <br/>
commentary on several Books Worth Reading: What Are Schools For?: <br/>
Holistic Education in American Culture, by Ron Miller; High Tech High <br/>
Touch: Technology and Our Search for Meaning, by John Naisbitt and <br/>
Douglas Philips; Learning All the Time: How Small Children Begin to <br/>
Read, Write, Count, and Investigate the World Without Being Taught, <br/>
by John Holt; Geeks: How Two Lost Boys Rode the Internet Out of <br/>
Idaho, by Jon Katz; The Schools Our Children Deserve: Moving Beyond <br/>
Traditional Classrooms and Tougher Standards, by Alfie Kohn; and High <br/>
Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don&#39;t Belong in the Classroom and Other <br/>
Reflections by a Computer Contrarian, by Clifford Stoll.<br/>
<br/>
Charles welcomes comments on the topic, including contrary views, and <br/>
those including permission to share will be posted at the end of the <br/>
newsletter. I&#39;ll look forward to reading comments from many of you in <br/>
the coming weeks!<br/>
