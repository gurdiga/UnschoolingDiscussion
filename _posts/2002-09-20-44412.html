I Don&#39;t Like Mondays<br/>
The silicon chip inside her head<br/>
gets switched to overload<br/>
and nobody&#39;s gonna go to school today<br/>
she&#39;s gonna make them stay at home<br/>
And Daddy doesn&#39;t understand it<br/>
He always said she was good as gold<br/>
And he can see no reason<br/>
Cos there are no reasons<br/>
What reasons do you need to be shown<br/>
Chorus:<br/>
Tell me why<br/>
I don&#39;t like Mondays<br/>
I want to shoot<br/>
The whole day down<br/>
The telex machine is kept so clean<br/>
and it types to waiting world.<br/>
And Mother feels so shocked<br/>
Father&#39;s world is rocked<br/>
And their thoughts turn to<br/>
Their own little girl<br/>
Sweet 16 ain&#39;t that peachy keen<br/>
No it ain&#39;t so neat to admit defeat,<br/>
They can see no reasons<br/>
Cos there are no reasons<br/>
What reasons do you need to be shown<br/>
Repeat Chorus<br/>
All the playing&#39;s stopped in the playground now<br/>
She wants to play with her toys awhile<br/>
And school&#39;s out early and soon we&#39;ll be learning<br/>
That the lesson today is how to die<br/>
And then the bullhorn crackles<br/>
And the captain tackles<br/>
With the problems and the how&#39;s and why&#39;s<br/>
And he can see no reasons<br/>
Cos there are no reasons<br/>
What reasons do you need to die<br/>
Repeat Chorus<br/>

Â <br/>
On Jan 29th 1979 Brenda Spencer, age 16, opened fire from her house toward a <br/>
nearby elementary school playground, killing 2 and wounding 9. She told a <br/>
reporter who called her during the 6 1/2 hour seige &quot;I don&#39;t like Mondays. <br/>
This livens up the day.&quot;</div>
