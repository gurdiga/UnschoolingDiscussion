<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637079846">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lately, my husband and I have been trying to have company over, and often<br/>
it&#39;s not that fun because of the children.<br/>
I&#39;d like them to be able to enjoy having guests over, but not completely<br/>
dominate the discussions and repeatedly get into our guest&#39;s personal<br/>
space.<br/>
Usually we have dinner with our guest, which the children don&#39;t eat---(??)<br/>
so they&#39;re done with that and ready to get onto the next thing.  My husband<br/>
brought home a special craft for them to do after they were done at the<br/>
table, but only one of them chose to do it.<br/>
<br/>
We put on a movie for them to watch, upstairs, and they were happy with that<br/>
for a while, but then they came back and tried to get us all to go and watch<br/>
the movie.<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to have a little adult conversation without being<br/>
constantly interrupted.<br/>
<br/>
Even when we don&#39;t have guests over, it seems like often my husband and I<br/>
are only able to gulp out yes or no questions to each other in between<br/>
interruptions.  We would like to discuss magazine articles, ideas, minor<br/>
problems about house etc, without feeling like we&#39;re in a word battle zone.<br/>
<br/>
My children are five and three.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Maybe hire a babysitter to do fun things with the kids in another part  <br/>
of the house.  Then the company can see them a little bit, but you  <br/>
won&#39;t need to be right with them.<br/>

<br/>
Wait until they are older. Several years older.<br/>
<br/>
Not only will you have the most amazing conversations with your kids if you <br/>
are open to the serendipity of it, but they will be more interested in some <br/>
of your friends.<br/>
<br/>
I think they sound rather hospitable, wanting to invite all your friends to <br/>
watch a movie with them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same here.  Our kids are 4 and 2, so we have very little time for discussions of any great depth.  We&#39;ve learned to communicate in brief snatches while the kids are around, and then we sometimes have a little bit of quiet time in the evening, but often my partner goes to bed not long after the kids - then I get my Always Learning time! If we have visitors over, my expectation is that I will still need to spend some time with the kids while my partner looks after our guests.  But honestly, we don&#39;t have people over all that often, and my partner and I rarely go out.  While the kids are still so young I&#39;d rather keep things simple.  Of course, I enjoy catching up with friends, but I do that during the week.  I&#39;m sure it will be easier to socialise in the evening when the kids are a bit older.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s your reality right now. Your expectations of having  <br/>
uninterrupted adult time with a 3 and 5 yo is setting them up to  <br/>
fail. They&#39;re still too young.<br/>
<br/>
The more you try to put them off, the more they&#39;re going to demand  <br/>
because for them it&#39;s a need. It&#39;s sort of like giving someone half a  <br/>
glass of water when their body needs a full glass. The fuss they&#39;d  <br/>
make over trying to get the other half glass they need would make it  <br/>
seem like they need gallons.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t find some solutions, but at their ages  <br/>
*expecting* them to give back just because you want something -- even  <br/>
if you explain how important it is -- is just going to frustrate you  <br/>
both.<br/>
<br/>
You might try preparing them for what will happen when you have  <br/>
guests and that you&#39;d like to have time to talk to your friends.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than turning the kids into the problem, engage them in coming  <br/>
up with ideas of meeting the kids&#39; needs that fit the unique  <br/>
requirements of the situation. Their solutions won&#39;t be perfect but  <br/>
that&#39;s good because you can talk about what&#39;s working and not working  <br/>
for both of you afterwards and tweak and come up with more ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397388683">Our boys are 1, 3, and 5 and i totally get where you are coming from.  I find that the more often we see others the less &quot;twitter pated&quot; the boys are.  All of our friends either have little ones or love little ones so that helps a bunch but if you don&#39;t already have those kinds of friends it can be difficult to find them and make friends at this stage in your lives (as i said i am there too). I find that if we give them time to socialize and talk about what is important to them without interruption they barely interrupt us.  with the holidays coming up and more opportunity for these sorts of encounters you have i bet you will find that it is better for your whole family.<br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t know if that is at all helpful but sometimes at least it helps to know you aren&#39;t &quot;the only one&quot;<br/>
<br/>
peace, <br/>

Keith and I gradually wandered away from out many childless friends  <br/>

some of them.<br/>
We found friends with children, and some are still our friends too.<br/>

would come over, I&#39;d get one of their older friends (10, 12, 14) to  <br/>
come over and I&#39;d say &quot;You know, Steve and Bo are kinda boring, so  <br/>
we&#39;re going to get Amy to come and play with you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So we all had company, the kids were still where we were, we could  <br/>
still play cards or whatever, and they were still having a great time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-638433112">We have a couple who my husband and I are close to. We have all been friends since jr high. They have no children and they love our kids but the kids wear on their nerves. Our children love them too but the kids feel the frustration from our childless friends if they are at our house to long. We like to go to dinner with them once in while. It is nice to catch up with them and keep our friendship and keep the peace for our children. <br/>
<br/>
When my kids were the ages of your kids our friends would watch a movie in the same room with the kids and we would have our conversations while watching a kid movie. That way our kids could be close and we could still converse. While the kids are very young they have to come first. I know it can be frustrating but this age will not last forever. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We didn&#39;t really maintain friends that weren&#39;t  &quot;family&quot; friends. Our <br/>
friends were mostly parents of our kids&#39; friends - so when we got <br/>
together, the kids ran off to play and the parents hung out and played <br/>
games or chatted or whatever...<br/>
<br/>
We lost touch with some people and we barely kept in touch with others - <br/>
of those who didn&#39;t have kids or whose kids and ours didn&#39;t click well.  <br/>
We might have very occasionally gotten together - maybe the kids would <br/>
be with another family for an evening or something - but it was rare.<br/>
<br/>
As the kids have gotten older, we&#39;ve reconnected with some of those <br/>
people, but, still, we mostly enjoy the company of other parents who <br/>
like our children, too.<br/>
