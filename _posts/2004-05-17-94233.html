I think how we&#39;re going to get to a balance is being sensitive to our and<br/>
our kids needs and wants and being honest..  We can&#39;t find our way in that<br/>
unless we can honor these.  Telling someone that certain actions (like going<br/>
to the store after dark) shouldn&#39;t be part of what one does for one&#39;s child,<br/>
is kind of arbitrary and I don&#39;t understand the usefulness.  These are not<br/>
things that can be listed and taught.  I imagine one person&#39;s trip to the<br/>
market is other&#39;s baking banana bread.  Who&#39;s to say which is really asking<br/>
too much except the person involved.  It&#39;s an action that would be<br/>
appreciated and if the parent was feeling lively at that point in the<br/>
evening, why not.  Each of our limits is different and can also change from<br/>
day to day.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that your desire is to clarify that it&#39;s not all or nothing.<br/>
There&#39;s a balance but the balance has to come from self knowledge, I think.<br/>

<br/>
This is absolutely true.  I think the key is to look inside and make sure<br/>
the &quot;no&quot; isn&#39;t just kneejerk.  Is there a reason I don&#39;t want to go to the<br/>
store?  Is there a reason I don&#39;t want to make different breakfasts?<br/>
<br/>
What are those reasons?  Are they real or just old scripts made from wives&#39;<br/>
tales?<br/>
<br/>
When we started down this road, I had to question myself all day, everyday.<br/>
It was tiring.  But as time has passed, I question myself less and less.<br/>
The boundaries are clearer as to what we are trying to do here.  But the<br/>
unschooling at my house isn&#39;t going to look like anyone else&#39;s because we<br/>
are different than other families....and that&#39;s a good thing.<br/>

<br/>
But I had written this:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; &quot;The only things people should really be expected to go out for after <br/>
dark, I<br/>
think,  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Two qualifications:<br/>
&quot;should be expected&quot;<br/>
and <br/>
&quot;I think&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What someone CHOOSES to do for one&#39;s child is not the same as what is <br/>
expected.<br/>
What I state as something I think is not the same as saying it shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
what other people do.<br/>
<br/>
Someone was expressing having felt guilty for not leaving the house in the <br/>
dark to go and get a particular candy bar.   I might do that and I might not (I <br/>
have gone to satisfy a whim, and other times I haven&#39;t; last night I nearly <br/>
went for tortillas at 11:00 p.m. and decided against it, and Marty used homemade <br/>
bread instead of the tortilla he would rather have had.)<br/>
<br/>
If a person wants to do that, great.<br/>
If a person doesn&#39;t want to, I don&#39;t think guilt is a appropriate if it&#39;s <br/>
10:00 at night.  We live two blocks from candy (closer if you want to pay <br/>
Hollywood Video/movie prices).   Friends of ours live 15 miles on dirt roads from <br/>
candy or even milk and bread.<br/>
<br/>
-=-hese are not<br/>
things that can be listed and taught.  I imagine one person&#39;s trip to the<br/>
market is other&#39;s baking banana bread.  Who&#39;s to say which is really asking<br/>
too much except the person involved. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If a persons is feeling guilty assuming that the rest of the unschoolers here <br/>
would hop in the jeep and head out into the darkness because a kid said &quot;Gosh <br/>
I wish I had a Snickers,&quot; it&#39;s worth it to me to suggest that others here <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do it either unless they just felt like a jeep ride.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I imagine that your desire is to clarify that it&#39;s not all or nothing.<br/>
There&#39;s a balance but the balance has to come from self knowledge, I think.-=-<br/>
<br/>
True, but some people tend to borrow others&#39; behavior and try it on as part <br/>
of their self-knowledge.  I was adjusting the sleeves on a borrowed garment, <br/>
maybe.  <br/>
<br/>
The answer is almost always &quot;it depends.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
The problem over at our house is that any one of the three of us is likely<br/>
to say, &quot;Gee I feel like a donut&quot;, and then the rest of us start thinking<br/>
about donuts, and next thing you know, darn it if we don&#39;t all pile into the<br/>
car at 1am and head for the 24 hour Winchell&#39;s up the road - or the giant<br/>
donut on the roof of that place that is near us.<br/>
<br/>
We have been known to go on 25 mile trips to look for a toy Jayn wants, but<br/>
we do it in a spirit of adventure or fun, and sometimes we don&#39;t go, if we<br/>
are too tired or busy.<br/>

how I wouldn&#39;t do that bc I was too tired.  What I said was:<br/>

options like creating something else or eating what we&#39;ve got in the house.<br/>
<br/>
So you were wanting me not to feel guilty about that and you were saying one<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be expected to go out at night except for necessities.  I, not<br/>
feeling I had to do those things either, saw what you had written with,<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be expected to do that and then a list of things one should be<br/>
expected to go out for, as more a static thing.  Over here is what one<br/>
should be expected to do and over here is what one shouldn&#39;t be.  So I<br/>
didn&#39;t understand that as a support.  Now  I see how that got misunderstood.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are always people who confuse the kind of kind and gentle and <br/>
gracious giving parenting that is promoted here, with parents becoming <br/>
doormats. There are people who don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; this idea - they hear it as <br/>
parents SHOULD/MUST jump up at 10 pm and run to the store to get a kid <br/>
a candy bar just because a kid says, &quot;I want a candy bar.&quot; Because <br/>
MOSTLY we&#39;re talking to people in a society which is unkind and <br/>
ungenerous and demanding and belittling of children, we mostly talk <br/>
about doing MORE for children. But, once in a while we have to <br/>
backtrack and say, &quot;Wait - we don&#39;t mean that every little whim has to <br/>
be satisfied at that moment.&quot; BUT it does mean not thinking of <br/>
everything a child desires as &quot;a childish whim,&quot; too.<br/>
<br/>
I went to visit Sandra in Albuquerque. She and Holly, who was 6 years <br/>
old, I think, picked me up at the airport. We talked a mile a minute as <br/>
we left the airport and Holly sat in the back seat and threw in a few <br/>
of her own thoughts here and there. I&#39;d been with them  and I heard two <br/>
things that really impressed me. One, Holly occasionally corrected <br/>
Sandra&#39;s statements - she&#39;d sweetly speak up and say something like, <br/>
&quot;Well, what he said exactly was this: .......,&quot; or &quot;Mama, was that the <br/>
day we went swimming in the lake because if it was, then that was <br/>
Kirby, not Marty.&quot; &lt;G&gt; Now we ALL know how young kids sometimes correct <br/>
their parents in front of other people, right? And, as the adult, that <br/>
can be irritating because a lot of times the details that they correct <br/>
aren&#39;t important to the point of the story. So - how do people usually <br/>
react? Usually with GREAT irritation and impatience and even <br/>
embarrassment.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra said, &quot;Holly has a great memory for details and helps me get <br/>
them right.&quot; Then she turned to Holly several times in the next few <br/>
minutes and asked her a question about the details, &quot;Holly, who was it <br/>
that said .....?&quot; &quot;Holly, what exactly was it that Kirby was trying to <br/>
do that day that.....?&quot;  Holly didn&#39;t end up a rude and interrupting <br/>
socially inept kid because Sandra didn&#39;t shush her and tell her not to <br/>
interrupt adult&#39;s conversations and so on. She ended up an absolutely <br/>
charming kid who is socially adept and a pleasure to be around because <br/>
Sandra respected her and included her.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that happened in that drive from the airport is that <br/>
Holly said, from the back seat, &quot;I&#39;d sure like some plums.&quot; Not whining <br/>
or begging, not demanding, just matter-of-fact about it. Sandra said to <br/>
me, &quot;Do you mind us stopping and buying some plums?&quot; I said no (in <br/>
fact, I LOVE to go to grocery stores when I&#39;m traveling to parts of the <br/>
country I haven&#39;t been) and so we stopped and went in and looked for <br/>
plums (this was Memorial weekend, early for plums) but couldn&#39;t find <br/>
any. So we went back to the car and Sandra said, &quot;We can try another <br/>
grocery store.&quot; So we did. No plums. She said, &quot;Well, Holly, there is <br/>
one more grocery store that we could try.&quot; So we did and they had <br/>
plums. Holly filled a bag with them and ate some on the way home in the <br/>
back of the car. She thanked her mom and said how GOOD they were and so <br/>
on, several times. It didn&#39;t matter to us that we drove around <br/>
Albuquerque a little, I was happy to see it and we were going to talk <br/>
no matter where we were. Did Holly grow up to be a &quot;spoiled brat?&quot; <br/>
Hardly! She&#39;s generous and thoughtful. And sensible in her <br/>
expectations, too.<br/>
