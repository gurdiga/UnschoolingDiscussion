<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697159035">OOh, ooh! It&#39;s a tangent I know, but I have to share this related <br/>
story --<br/>
<br/>
       The National Book Festival has been on BookTV and a book <br/>
reviewer/author named Michael Dirda spoke about his new prize-winning book, which was all <br/>
about growing up poor in the heartland and becoming a passionate reader. In <br/>
fact, how being a reader had become his whole identity. I think it&#39;s called &quot;An <br/>
Open Book&quot; - will look up later.<br/>
<br/>
       Anyway, he said money was so tight and his mother so frugal that she <br/>
taught them to only do school reports on things that started with the letter <br/>
&quot;a&quot; -- she would always go for the introductory encyclopedia offers (Volume A <br/>
for 59 cents!) and then cancel before she had to pay $9.95 for any other <br/>
volumes. So he and his sisters had a whole  shelf full of reference sources at home, <br/>
but only on things that started with &quot;a&quot; like asteroids and artichokes and <br/>
Argentina and Alabama and alligators. He said the teachers always gave them good <br/>
grades and never noticed. :) <br/>
<br/>
       Btw, his book sounded absolutely marvelous for anyone here who was <br/>
interested in the reading thread before -- this author was very much a self-made <br/>
reader, with no role models or encouragement of any kind, it sounded like. He <br/>
read exactly what he pleased, from comic books to Sherlock Holmes (and his <br/>
description of reading the Hound of the Baskervilles for the first time was <br/>
delicious to a kindred reading spirit like me.)  JJ     <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was very far from knowing anything about unschooling in those days, <br/>
&gt; but I do remember, once, saying to her teacher - &quot;Kind of weird to <br/>
&gt; &#39;authentically&#39; assess what is not authentically learned.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This was because my daughter had been assigned to learn about the <br/>
&gt; kangaroo rat. All California 4th graders learn about California. So the <br/>
&gt; class had been divided into groups - the desert, ocean, mountains, and <br/>
&gt; valleys groups. She was in the desert group. Then, within the group <br/>
&gt; they each got assigned an animal to learn about. She got the kangaroo <br/>
&gt; rat. At the time, she was horse-crazy. She also was crazy about <br/>
&gt; dolphins and whales and other creatures of the sea. She was NOT <br/>
&gt; interested in kangaroo rats.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
