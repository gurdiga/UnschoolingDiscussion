<div id="ygrps-yiv-305618907">Hi everyone! <br/>
I&#39;d like some input on this one: A child (now 13) wants to be a doctor-surgeon of some type. How can this happen if the child is unschooling from this age on (has been in ps up to this point)?

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913324013">**A child (now 13) wants to be a doctor-surgeon of some type. How can this <br/>
happen if the child is unschooling from this age on (has been in ps up to <br/>
this point)?**<br/>
<br/>
Mostly by deschooling yourself and reading a lot about unschooling :-)  One <br/>
of the hardest parts is to imagine reaching a goal by wandering about <br/>
seemingly aimlessly.  But how did he learn to talk?  By having the will and <br/>
exploring at random, right?  And I bet he mastered it, regardless of what <br/>
route he took.<br/>
<br/>
*If* he truely wants to be a doctor/surgeon, it&#39;ll happen.  He&#39;ll be <br/>
motivated enough to learn what he needs to learn.<br/>
<br/>
It only seems like an enormous task when looked at in schoolish terms.  But <br/>
that&#39;s because schools approach learning from the wrong direction.  Schools <br/>
give kids the facts, then trust they&#39;ll come up with a reason for using them. <br/>
 Through unschooling, we can let kids find the reasons and then they&#39;ll be <br/>
motivated to learn the facts -- and quite often just absorb the facts as they <br/>
are exploring for the fun of it.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have A.D.A.M. The Inside Story software?  Lots of great anatomy stuff <br/>
to explore freeform.  Dorling Kindersley has some excellent software and <br/>
might have something similar or related.  (www.dk.com)  Check out Discovery <br/>
and Learning Channels and PBS for science shows that might be even remotely <br/>
related to biology.  (They all have websites and programming guides.)  <br/>
Discover magazine is excellent and often has biology articles in it.  In a <br/>
year or two he can probably volunteer at a hospital.  There&#39;s Grays Anatomy <br/>
coloring book.  There are cow&#39;s eye and frog dissection programs on line.  <br/>
And there are things to order from Carolina Biological Supply catalog.<br/>
<br/>
These are all just few ideas of things to have around.  They are not things <br/>
that will teach him to be a doctor.  Let him explore.  If he&#39;s drawn towards <br/>
doctorish stuff, then he&#39;ll end up as a doctor.  If he&#39;s naturally drawn to <br/>
other things, he&#39;ll head off on another path and it would have been a mistake <br/>
to urge him down the more narrow doctor path even if that&#39;s what he says he <br/>
wants.<br/>
<br/>
**I feel like a good start would be Grace Lewelyn&#39;s &quot;Teenage Liberation <br/>
Handbook&quot; but what else should one think about or do?**<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s an excellent start.  And after you read it you&#39;ll have a better idea <br/>
of what you need to ask about.<br/>
<br/>
**How could we research if medical schools take hsed/unsed children?**<br/>
<br/>
Harvard takes homeschooled/unschooled kids so what else is there to know? ;-)<br/>
<br/>

**Since he has been in the ps system would it be wise for him to continue <br/>
considering his goal or not?**<br/>
<br/>
I think the worst thing anyone can do is to discourage a goal, no matter how <br/>
unrealizable it seems.  If someone really wants something, regardless of the <br/>
apparent obstacles in front of them, they&#39;ll find a way to get to it.<br/>
<br/>
**What about hsing but w/structure instead of unschooling?**<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t necessarily mean no structure.  It means no <br/>
parent-imposed structure.  If a child decides he&#39;d like to use a textbook or <br/>
take a community college class or a class online to learn something, then <br/>
that&#39;s unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is scary because we think we know so much more than our kids and <br/>
we can see the path they need to take to reach their goal so much clearer.  <br/>
But our superior knowledge can put blinders on kids so that they become so <br/>
focused on taking the path they say they want that we&#39;ve then laid out for <br/>
them, that they miss some fascinating side paths that would have lead them in <br/>
a direction neither of you could have foreseen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-364778677">Dear Tonia,<br/>
<br/>
Remember, medical schools do not take students directly out of high school.  A student needs to have completed a 4-year degree in college before going on to medical school.  Many students who did not complete math and science requirements in high school can take them in college later.  A number of hs highschoolers do what is called &quot;double-dipping,&quot; they attend community college classes to fulfill high school requirements or personal interests and at the same time get a jump on some college credit.<br/>
<br/>
Many colleges are now actively recruiting homeschooled students.  They are finding that contrary to the notion that hs&#39;ed students are unprepared, they are independent and creative learners and an asset to the student body.  <br/>
<br/>
And (I say this very gently) a 13 year old will probably change his/her mind a dozen times before settling on a career that requires long years of schooling and many thousands of dollars.  I believe this is as it should be, this is an age for exploring, not locking themselves in to a particular path.  If your 13 year old is already committed to this, he/she will begin exploring the sciences and higher mathematics, and only needs support and resources.  If these kids need structure, they often create their own.  And I believe, again, that this, not structure imposed from the outside (by me!) is the basis for self discipline that is so valuable later in life.<br/>
<br/>
Love,  Jane<br/>

<br/>
I am going to add my 2 cents here, based on MY CONCEPT of unschooling.  My kids are little, just 2 and 4 months so one might say I don&#39;t know what I am talking about.<br/>
<br/>
With all the reading I have been doing over the past two months it is my understanding that the whole point of unschooling is to lead the children to learning.  So, any activity that we do will end up including all the subjects, (reading, writing, math and etc.) inspite of ourselves.  Didn&#39;t we all have the discussion a little while back about how we all use Algebra everyday and did not even realize it? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Even at this early age if your son studied (for the lack of a better word) medical related topics, I think that he would be better prepared for medical school and etc. than your run of the mill ps student who wants to go into the medical field?<br/>
<br/>
It is just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Have a good day,<br/>
<br/>
Julie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-98744738">Hello!  <br/>
	Does OR have a program whereby your teen can take classes at a nearby <br/>
community college?  In WA we call it &quot;Running Start.&quot;  It&#39;s free tuition if <br/>
the student passes a test called the ASSET test, which tells the school that <br/>
he/she&#39;s functioning at a Junior in High School level (not that hard).  Then <br/>
for the &quot;llth and 12th&quot; grades, he/she can attend (at any age - just have to <br/>
pass the test) up to full time for two years and actually get a free AA <br/>
degree!  From there, colleges and universities don&#39;t check about any high <br/>
school stuff - they just transfer!  No prob, Bob.  LOTS of homeschoolers do <br/>
Running Start here - check into it for OR.  He/she may have to have a decent <br/>
SAT score - but they can study for that.  Hope this helps.  Lynnie from <br/>

happen if the child is unschooling from this age on (has been in ps up to <br/>

<br/>
I hit reply to all and see four lists listed.  This could be a problem if <br/>
some of them are clear to receive posts from people outside of them.  Maybe <br/>
they&#39;ll all just bounce except the one I&#39;m on.<br/>
<br/>
A child out of school will have more freedom to pursue medical-related things <br/>
than a child in school.  If you want to spend some money, find the Anatomy <br/>
Coloring Book, and maybe some of the &quot;visible man&quot; and other such plastic <br/>
anatomy kits.  There are dissection sites on line (frog and eyeball come to <br/>
mind) and there are magazines that will sell you dissectable stuff, but there <br/>
are also butcher shops in town that might allow a tour and some take-home <br/>
animal&#39;s heads and such.  Learning biology by hook or crook is still <br/>
learning, and the more hands-on the better.  The diagrams in books are often <br/>
colored like U.S. maps--four or more colors so you can tell what&#39;s what.  If <br/>
the kid gets the feel for what colors things really are that would be a <br/>
plus--most people don&#39;t get that until they get to third year college biology.<br/>
<br/>
I think outside of school and unschooling is a great path.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to press the child.  Try not to say, &quot;Why are you wanting <br/>
Shakespeare?  Surgeons don&#39;t need Shakespeare.&quot;  Because one good pet wound <br/>
close up might end that medical thing for life, and you don&#39;t want to start <br/>
at the age of 13 to make a child a failure for not living up to &quot;Life&#39;s <br/>
goals.&quot;  Treat interests as interests, not as life-long commitments.  We <br/>
don&#39;t hold them to the girlfriends they have at 12 or 13, why hold them to <br/>
the &quot;Gee I&#39;d like to be a dancer&quot; things they express?<br/>

older and more able to grasp this, some children may decide that even<br/>
though they have an interest in medicine, the idea of a career in it turns<br/>
them off.<br/>
<br/>
The beauty of it is that they can learn and think and write about medical<br/>
issues, problems, and items of interest all of their lives without needing<br/>
to become a doctor.<br/>
