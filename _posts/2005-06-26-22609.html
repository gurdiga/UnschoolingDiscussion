It&#39;s been fun, working on my webpages with a new computer that&#39;s fast.   And <br/>
I used to be disturbed by the haphazard rabbit-warren of it all, but now I&#39;m <br/>
liking it a lot.   It&#39;s a sort of &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; site, and nobody <br/>
will ever have read the entire thing (nor need to).   I find pages sometimes <br/>

&gt; I did an odd thing, when Kirby was five.  I consciously decided not to  use<br/>
&gt; the names of &quot;subject areas,&quot; ever.  Whether he liked something or not,  I<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t going to tell him it was &quot;history&quot; or &quot;math&quot; or &quot;science.&quot;  Each  of <br/>
&gt; those<br/>
&gt; is made up of dozens, hundreds of interests and unrelated topics.   In <br/>
&gt; school,<br/>
&gt; kids decide to declare that they like or hate &quot;science,&quot; when really  <br/>
&gt; geology<br/>
&gt; has very little to do with psychology or surgery.    Same  with <br/>
&gt; &quot;geography.&quot; <br/>
&gt; Would someone who &quot;likes geography&quot; because he&#39;s  fascinated by maps and<br/>
&gt; mapping necessarily care about the major production of  different regions of <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; world, or traditional costume of Afghanistan?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But as an unschooling mom, I think it&#39;s important for the parents not to  <br/>
&gt; say<br/>
&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t like... (maps/science/costume/psychology), because if you have <br/>
&gt; fears and prejudices left over from school, it&#39;s a good thing to do <br/>
&gt; whatever <br/>
&gt; internal work you need to get over that, so you can answer your children&#39;s <br/>
&gt; questions without showing (and maybe passing on) an aversion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925637121">As a sporadic (and enthusiastic) lurker, I apologize if this issue has <br/>
been addressed before, but if it has, I haven&#39;t stumbled across it yet.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to hear and/or see how unschoolers who live in states with <br/>
a &quot;Daily Log&quot; requirement, keep their daily logs.  Even though I am an <br/>
unschooler and getting better every day at leaving all the school-words <br/>
behind, our daily log is a nagging reminder of words like &quot;history&quot; <br/>
and &quot;math&quot; that has kept our minds from becoming completely free of <br/>
that old and harmful way of thinking.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear about a way to keep a daily log without using those <br/>
words, and without picking our daily fun apart in &quot;subjects&quot; and making <br/>
it sound like &quot;real school.&quot;  (yuck!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101783650">You might get better ideas from a homeschool group in your state whose members are familiar with the specifics of your law.  Sometimes the regulations sound daunting but are really quite simple to meet.  Many states now have unschooling groups as well.  (Yeah!)<br/>
<br/>
Here in WA we have to do an annual assessment or standardized test.  I do the assessment.  Basically, once a year I write up many of the things my girls have done during the past 12 months.  Since WA asks us to include subjects, I do categorize it that way.  It does NOT change what we do on a day to day basis.  It is just a matter of me sitting down now and then and jotting down a few things.<br/>
<br/>
Although I categorize it by subject, the girls don&#39;t need to be told &quot;now you are doing math&quot; or &quot;now you are doing social studies&quot;.  Really, the hardest part is that subjects overlap and some activities could be categorized under several subjects.  The first year I listed things multiple times.  If something could be reading and history, I listed it under both.  Now I just list each thing once under the most obvious category - or just pick one.<br/>
<br/>
As the years go by I am getting more relaxed about it.  We don&#39;t have to turn it in to anybody - it is for the parent&#39;s use in determining that the child is &quot;making adequate progress&quot;.<br/>

If I only had to do it once a year, I wouldn&#39;t be as cranky about it.<br/>

I am good at dissecting our activities, such that our fun busy <br/>

the thing that troubles me.  Having to do this 180 times a year for <br/>

just my own head that suffers about it. <br/>
<br/>
If I could find a way to comply with the daily log requirement in <br/>

<br/>
You said:<br/>

thinking that way.  <br/>
<br/>
I now say:<br/>
In New Zealand we don&#39;t have a requirement for record keeping but I can sympathise with your dilemma.  When I first started home education (before I knew much about unschooling) I printed out a one page table for each child with each of the subject headings down one side and a note space on the other.  I found everything kind of integrated in the end so I might put:  spelling - cover in writing (which meant I helped if asked how to spell something), I kept a rough note of things the children read independently and things we read together and fitted those into as many boxes as possible.  Ditto with museum visits, park visits, trips to the library, shopping, time with friends.  I still staple all the library tickets in a diary just in case someone wants to see them.<br/>
<br/>
We are reviewed from time to time by our government Education Review Office, the guy didn&#39;t ask to look at my lovely forms so the day after the review I stopped doing them but I did find I could fill in three months of gaps in a single sitting with my pocket diary as a memory aid and a degree of creativity.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have to post this log in or can they cold call and ask to inspect it at any time? <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Julie <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775175796">I thought I posted the unschooler&#39;s recordkeeping log here, didn&#39;t I? <br/>
Just a few days ago? It is exactly what you&#39;re describing - a daily log <br/>
that is not listed in school subjects but in &quot;real&quot; activities.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect you are providing far more than the law requires. I also <br/>
think you very likely would be able to use the recordkeeping form I <br/>
sent to this list, as a log. Just put book titles on the section where <br/>
it says: &quot;Reading&quot; or &quot;Listening.&quot; Most superintendents would find that <br/>
kind of log acceptable, in fact, it would be more than what many PA <br/>
homeschoolers turn in, I think.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t the best list for discussions of specific state regulations <br/>
- but I do know unschoolers in PA and here is what they&#39;ve told me:<br/>
<br/>
1. Some people interpret the log requirement as nothing more that a <br/>
list of books read.<br/>
<br/>
2. Others interpret the requirement as a &quot;daily&quot; log, even though it <br/>
doesn&#39;t say &quot;daily&quot; in the law, but they still think it only needs to <br/>
contain the titles of books read. So there would be an entry for each <br/>
of the 180 days, but the only thing entered would be book titles - <br/>
often the same title over and over, of course.<br/>
<br/>
3. Others interpret it as you seem to be doing, as a log of learning <br/>
activities.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the log is to provide it to your evaluator to use in <br/>
determining if the child is receiving an appropriate education. The log <br/>
does get turned in to the superintendent, too.<br/>
<br/>
You have to know what YOUR particular superintendent requires. One way <br/>
to find out is to ask other homeschoolers in your district. Another way <br/>
is to keep a pretty thorough log for one year, but turn in a very <br/>
abbreviated form of it and wait to see if that is accepted. YOU get to <br/>
choose your evaluator, so pick one that supports unschooling or at <br/>
least one that supports turning in the minimum information required by <br/>
law, not over-reporting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is really a question about a particular state&#39;s requirements, and not <br/>
about how learning works, so the Pennsylvania list/board is a better place for <br/>
the discussion.   <br/>
<br/>
There are few to no other states with similar state requirements, and there <br/>
are many unschoolers in Pennsylvania who don&#39;t keep a daily log.<br/>
