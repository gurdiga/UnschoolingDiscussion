call, kids sometimes want to experience so many different things and to see <br/>
for themselves what it is really all about.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s better for them to actually see what it&#39;s about so they can <br/>
know why others disapprove of it or why others go to them.<br/>
<br/>
Depends on the age of the child and if a parent is in close proximity to said <br/>
event and can kinda of &quot;shadow&quot; monitor the child for danger.  Sometimes <br/>
those things do get out of hand and there can be violence. I only know this <br/>
from seeing it on TV.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it goes back to allowing our kids freedom to think on their own and <br/>
experience and learn on their own but are you imposing your thoughts if you <br/>
deny them such an event.  Hmmm, it would be easy to just say under no <br/>
circumstances let him go.  They are a terrible lot and no good can come of <br/>
it.  But that might be a step away from censoring their TV and books.  I&#39;m <br/>
just not sure what the &quot;correct&quot; stance would be as an unschooler.   As a <br/>
mother, I would ask lots of questions and try to come up with a compromise <br/>
that would be fairly acceptable to parent and child.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you!<br/>

There&#39;s not a correct stance for an unschooler.<br/>
I am no more obligated to drive someone somewhere than I obligate Marty to go <br/>
places of my choosing.<br/>
<br/>
A kid who can&#39;t drive himself is never going to be guaranteed of a ride to a <br/>
place where the driver doesn&#39;t want to go.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe the mother is saying that&#39;s exactly what her son wants to attend.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The mother&quot; was me.  I brought it up first.  And I was writing to Shyrley, <br/>
who was talking about something altogether different.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Good luck to you!&gt;&gt;<br/>

It was entirely hypothetical and rhetorical.  There is no skinhead rally.  It <br/>
was an example.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584517973">&lt;I have a sincere question for anyone here.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that you have bent over backwards to be respectful of your children,<br/>
and give them the freedom they need to make decisions, what *would* you do if<br/>
your child wanted to go to a skinhead rally or do something else <br/>
objectionable?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I realize that some of you will answer that its not an issue at your home. <br/>
But<br/>
it *is* an issue here at the present moment and I could use some ideas.<br/>
<br/>

    <br/>
Sandra is THIS you?  This starts out by stating they have a sincere question, <br/>
they say they realize it might not be an issue at someone else&#39;s house but it <br/>
IS at theirs, and right NOW.<br/>
<br/>
I believe it WAS/IS a real issue we were dealing with.  Maybe yours was <br/>
hypothetical but Kristen seems to be saying her issue is very real.<br/>
