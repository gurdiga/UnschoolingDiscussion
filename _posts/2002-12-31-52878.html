tonight to celebrate with my 13dd, who&#39;s really disappointed not to be going<br/>
to a New Years party. Not that she ever has or was this year, but somehow<br/>
she wanted to be. So, what can we do here, that would also include 6ds and<br/>
8dd.<br/>
I&#39;m counting on all of you, so c&#39;mon...;-)<br/>

I taught DD (10) and my two lads (9 and 7) to headbang to heavy metal :-)<br/>

Have a mini-party with the kids.<br/>

I&#39;m all out of ideas now.<br/>

Time Capsules or Millennium Scrapbooks<br/>
These can be as fancy or basic as you choose. Disney, LearningSmith, and <br/>
others have time capsules you can buy, and then complete at the party. They <br/>
traditionally include prepared cards or pages where you fill in things like <br/>
what is cool, slang words, popular activities, clothes, games, fashion, <br/>
vacations, etc... You could make a scrapbook using acid-free paper and <br/>
special pens, document family trees or histories, etc.. or provide <br/>
three-ring binders and pages and then let people decorate and include what <br/>
they want.<br/>
You might have everyone bring newspapers and magazines to cut things out <br/>
of, or you could download images from the net and provide copies for people <br/>
to use. You could also have a design a time capsule contest and have people <br/>
bring time capsules they previously created and just tell the other guests <br/>
what is in them.<br/>
<br/>
Some ideas about what you might want to include are:<br/>
·       newspapers or magazines (or just covers) about historical, social, <br/>
or cultural events<br/>
·       pictures of famous people or your family<br/>
·       pictures of cars, pets, or other hobby-oriented things<br/>
·       cultural artifacts (like early electronic things)<br/>
·       descriptions of people - average sizes and shapes - maybe a chart <br/>
of how people have gotten taller or are living longer<br/>
·       want ads or personal columns<br/>
·       price quotes for housing, cars, transportation, other durable goods<br/>
·       sample menus and vacation planning guides<br/>
·       for small kids - their favorite baby toy, bath toy, outfit, etc...<br/>
·       for sports fanatics, every jersey they have ever worn while playing <br/>
team sports<br/>
·       for girl scouts, all their daisy, brownie, junior, cadet, and <br/>
senior uniforms or badges<br/>
·       for lovers, a timeline of their relationship history and plans for <br/>
the future<br/>
<br/>
The timeline could be drawn on a roll of butcher paper (available at art or <br/>
teacher supply stores), and images that represent each era (from the <br/>
costume list) can be found at the library. Copy and glue pictures near each <br/>
date (prior to the party).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293201121">My oldest of course is always out and about for the eve but my husband and I <br/>
stay up with the 3 younger ones. We wear silly hats, set off fireworks, have <br/>
noise makers and pop poppers. We eat chips and dance and play games or watch <br/>
a video, although the last is a last resort as this night is for fun and <br/>
noise!! Pretty much just being silly and making noise is fun enough!!!<br/>
