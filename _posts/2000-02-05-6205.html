     -- Views from the world of learning in Japan --<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Chinese New Year!<br/>
<br/>
And welcome to the 5 Feb. 2000 edition of KnoK (pronounced &quot;knock&quot;) NEWS, <br/>
an informal and periodic bulletin concerning issues of learning in Japan <br/>
-- at home or otherwise. It is brought to you by the Covert family -- <br/>
Kazumi, Kenya and Brian -- a multicultural, homelearning family in Osaka, <br/>
Japan.<br/>
<br/>
KnoK stands for *KODOMO no KOKORO*, which means &quot;Heart of a Child&quot; in <br/>
Japanese. It is our belief that the heart of any child is indeed at the <br/>
center of true learning, wherever and however such learning may take <br/>
place. <br/>

[Editor&#39;s Note:  Hi everybody. We continue this edition of KnoK NEWS with <br/>
a deeper look at the latest buzzwords in Japan: *gakkyu hokai* -- <br/>
classroom breakdown -- and its larger cousin, *gakko hokai*, or school <br/>
breakdown. The following (rather lengthy!) article, penned by a veteran <br/>
schoolteacher in Japan, provides many points for debate, as well as some <br/>
insights into just how mainstream Japanese educators view the problems <br/>
and the solutions.<br/>
<br/>
Homelearners reading the following article about Japan will recognize <br/>
some familiar scenarios from their own countries right off, most notably <br/>
the role of educator as Official Pointer of Blame at every party <br/>
imaginable: the students, their parents, the government, the media, <br/>
researchers, society, foreigners -- at every party, that is, except that <br/>
institution known as school. In a hierarchical society like Japan where <br/>
the *appearance* of order often takes priority over actual learning, <br/>
Japanese teachers find themselves longing more than ever for the &quot;good <br/>
ol&#39; days&quot; when their pupils just shut up and obeyed authority. But those <br/>
days are gone forever. More and more Japanese families are questioning <br/>
conventional schooling and seeking alternatives on their own. Although <br/>
homelearning families in Japan do remain far fewer in number compared <br/>
with their counterparts in other nations, this situation is slowly but <br/>
steadily changing. A seed of educational revolution is taking root in <br/>
Japan and, just as with other countries, a major factor in that <br/>
inevitable change has undoubtedly been classroom/school breakdown. --BC]<br/>

CLASSROOM BREAKDOWN AND SCHOLASTIC DECLINE IN JAPAN<br/>
<br/>
[By] Yamagishi Shunsuke<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Education in any country has its bright sides and its dark. The bright <br/>
side of Japanese education was once the excellence of its primary and <br/>
secondary schools. A 1976 OECD report on Japan prepared by a team of <br/>
examiners including former prime minister of France Edgar Faure and <br/>
Britain&#39;s Ronald P. Dore, then professor at Sussex University, stated, <br/>
&quot;the Examiners&#39; strong feeling has been that compared to their own <br/>
countries, Japanese achievements in these levels of education are very <br/>
substantial.&quot; For nearly a quarter of a century thereafter, Japan&#39;s <br/>
Ministry of Education, local boards of education, as well as elementary, <br/>
junior high, and senior high schools hosted numerous inspection groups <br/>
and study teams, not only from countries in the developing world but from <br/>
the industrialized countries as well.<br/>
<br/>
Ten years after the OECD report was published, Edwin O. Reischauer, then <br/>
Harvard University professor and formerly U.S. ambassador to Japan, wrote <br/>
in the introduction to Benjamin Duke&#39;s *The Japanese School: Lessons for <br/>
Industrial America*, &quot;In the past four decades, Japan has moved in U.S. <br/>
minds from being an economic basket case to becoming an economic <br/>
miracle.&quot; That impression of Japan continued to be current for a long <br/>
time, until very recently. Reischauer observed the significant role the <br/>
school education system had played in Japan&#39;s economic success, noting <br/>
that &quot;the quality and morale of persons becoming educators in <br/>
Japan[,]...far more important than school facilities&quot; and the &quot;high <br/>
regard the Japanese show their teachers and the respect for teaching as a <br/>
high calling...[and the] strong supportive attitude for education on the <br/>
part of Japanese families,&quot; were the crucial factors responsible for what <br/>
Japanese education had achieved.<br/>
<br/>
Thoroughly conversant with Japanese society and culture, Reischauer was <br/>
well aware of the dark side of Japanese education. He did not overlook <br/>
the notorious entrance-examination system that &quot;rewards rote memory <br/>
rather than reasoning,&quot; the &quot;poor teaching and very little study&quot; at the <br/>
university level, and the English-language education practices that <br/>
produce remarkably few fluent speakers and writers of English capable of <br/>
taking an active role in international intellectual society. But he <br/>
appeared to believe that the achievements were of such a scale that they <br/>
could, in large part, compensate for such weaknesses.<br/>
<br/>
Reischauer was not the only one to comment on the role of education in <br/>
economic growth; many scholars of Japanese society from the United States <br/>
and Europe have acclaimed it. While Japanese themselves were not <br/>
particularly confident of their own educational system, they ultimately <br/>
began to believe these high estimations voiced by outside observers.<br/>
<br/>
The economic crisis that struck Japan in the 1990s, however, shook <br/>
Japanese society, bringing profound changes to people&#39;s lifestyles and <br/>
attitudes. These changes are still going on, and education is very much <br/>
part of it. People&#39;s confidence in the educational system that helped <br/>
make Japan a world economic power and that sustained its growth has been <br/>
seriously undermined. What has really caught them off guard, however, is <br/>
the unexpected emergence of the problems of classroom breakdown and <br/>
declining scholastic achievement, phenomena of the schools that seem all <br/>
the more sinister because their causes are unknown.<br/>
<br/>
The breakdown and collapse of classroom order (*gakkyu hokai*) has been <br/>
particularly startling. The teacher&#39;s attempts to call the class to order <br/>
are to no avail: students continue to chatter and play among themselves, <br/>
neither opening their textbooks nor taking out their notebooks. When <br/>
chided or reprimanded, students talk back or speak insultingly to the <br/>
teacher, sometimes even walking out of class. There have been cases when <br/>
the entire class suddenly left the room.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching, under such conditions, is obviously impossible. Similar <br/>
situations occurred during a period about twenty years ago when violence <br/>
and trouble in the schools became pronounced. Such cases, however, were <br/>
generally confined to certain high schools and junior high schools where <br/>
trouble-making students disrupted discipline and classroom order. This is <br/>
the first time, moreover, that the specter of classroom breakdown has <br/>
visited elementary schools, even first and other lower grades.<br/>
<br/>
An NHK television program aired in early 1999 showed a lower-grade <br/>
elementary school class in which some students, completely ignoring <br/>
instructions, were wandering around the classroom at will. The veteran <br/>
teacher in charge was completely at a loss to deal with the situation. <br/>
The program helped to impress the general public with the seriousness of <br/>
the classroom-breakdown phenomenon.<br/>
<br/>
There were many until very recently who did not believe that such loss of <br/>
classroom control was possible in Japanese schools; they included <br/>
specialists in education and many dedicated teachers. One professor of <br/>
the department of education of a national university at first wrote that <br/>
he did not think the term classroom collapse was appropriate to the field <br/>
of education, reminiscent as it is of the &quot;collapse of the bubble <br/>
(*baburu hokai*),&quot; referring to the deep recession that set in when the <br/>
overheated economy suddenly deflated. After he began visiting elementary <br/>
schools to study the actual situation, however, he confessed that he <br/>
ceased to have any reservations whatsoever about using the term.<br/>
<br/>
There was no longer any doubt in his mind, the professor reported, of the <br/>
severity and the reality of classroom breakdown, after watching one boy <br/>
in music class suddenly stop playing his recorder. When asked to continue <br/>
by [the] teacher, he got up and ran out of the classroom, with most of <br/>
the others in the class following along [with] him. In another case, he <br/>
observed a child of about ten, returning to school after classes had <br/>
ended to get something forgotten, turn on a veteran teacher with insults <br/>
and shouts of hatred, throw chalk, and overturn a goldfish tank in rage.<br/>
<br/>
In any era, at any time, [there] are always a few children who cause <br/>
trouble and pose special discipline problems. We need to know how <br/>
widespread the classroom breakdown syndrome has become in Japan, but so <br/>
far the problem has not been adequately measured. The Ministry of <br/>
Education, citing the difficulty of conducting a nationwide survey, has <br/>
so far done nothing. When specialists in education do studies on a <br/>
limited scale, they invariably uncover cases such as those described <br/>
above. Some believe that in the Tokyo Metropolitan area, one class out of <br/>
every twelve is out of control, but that estimate is by no means certain.<br/>
<br/>
One important source of information on this sinister problem that seems <br/>
to be spreading through the schools like a plague is *Gakkyu hokai* <br/>
[Classroom Breakdown] (Asahi Shimbunsha, 1999), a compilation of articles <br/>
reporting on specific cases in the national daily *Asahi Shimbun* <br/>
[newspaper]. Through this book, one sees how the newspaper initially <br/>
reported on the phenomenon.<br/>
<br/>
The causes of classroom breakdown are not yet clearly identified, but a <br/>
book entitled *Gakko hokai* [School Breakdown] by Kawakami Ryoichi <br/>
(Soshisha) (see this issue, p. 14) explains changes in the living <br/>
environment that have contributed to the transformation in children, from <br/>
the viewpoint of a junior high school teacher. With thirty-three years of <br/>
teaching experience behind him, the author notes that more children in <br/>
recent years find it difficult to sit properly in their chairs or stand <br/>
at attention during school assemblies. Many are generally frail of build <br/>
and seem unable to move their bodies easily and smoothly, and, while <br/>
stubborn and self-centered, they tend to be afraid of others. They cannot <br/>
easily put up with difficulty or pressure and their feelings are easily <br/>
hurt, but they lack common consideration for others. Giving a number of <br/>
examples, he shows the pronounced differences between today&#39;s junior high <br/>
school students and those of twenty years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Parents have changed a great deal as well. Kawakami points out that <br/>
children betray little remorse even if caught shoplifting, and their <br/>
parents are less likely to require children to show a sense of <br/>
responsibility for their own actions. The eye of the community and adult <br/>
society as a restraining factor on children&#39;s behavior, meanwhile, has <br/>
noticeably weakened.<br/>
<br/>
The issue of classroom breakdown is still at the stage when it is known <br/>
mostly from often-sensationalized mass-media reporting. It has yet to be <br/>
dealt with in systematic surveys or research, analyzing the conjunction <br/>
of classroom phenomena with changes in juvenile behavior, examined <br/>
against the backdrop of overall changes of society.<br/>
<br/>
Classroom breakdown is a serious concern not just for educators but for <br/>
the business leaders who exercise influence in Japanese society. It was <br/>
reported that in seminars targeted at businesspeople ordinarily <br/>
interested in little beyond matters of the economy, lectures on classroom <br/>
collapse draw a noticeably larger crowd than usual. Their anxiety about <br/>
what is happening to their young grandchildren, rather than their <br/>
grown-up children, is notable.<br/>
<br/>
Even more difficult for the general public to grasp than the phenomenon <br/>
of classroom breakdown is that of the decline in scholastic achievement. <br/>
Public concern about the trend appears to be limited, although those <br/>
involved in education are seriously worried.<br/>
<br/>
Following the defeat [of Japan] in World War II, the Japanese educational <br/>
system underwent drastic reform. Not long after the curriculum was <br/>
revised and teaching methods following American models were introduced to <br/>
the schools, the decline in scholastic achievement became evident, <br/>
stirring considerable controversy; the recent debate is apparently the <br/>
first time since then that the issue has resurfaced.<br/>
<br/>
It is understandable that educators, whose boast that their education <br/>
system was among the most efficient and effective in the world is now <br/>
being doused by charges of a &quot;distressing decline in scholastic <br/>
achievement,&quot; are feeling a bit shell-shocked. The cruel verdict has been <br/>
passed down by university teachers. The jacket blurb for *Bunsu ga <br/>
dekinai daigakusei* [University Students Can&#39;t Do Fractions] (Toyo Keizai <br/>
Shimposha, 1999) says: &quot;You may find it difficult to believe, but two out <br/>
of every ten university students cannot do primary school-level <br/>
arithmetic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These figures are the result of tests given by Nishimura Kazuo (one of <br/>
the editors of the book and professor of the Institute of Economic <br/>
Research, Kyoto University) and others to students in economic classes, <br/>
featuring mainly arithmetic and mathematics problems at the elementary <br/>
and junior-high school level -- problems like 7/8 minus 4/5 = ? and 2 <br/>
divided by 0.25 = ?<br/>
<br/>
The book says that more than 20 percent of the students in the faculty of <br/>
economics of one of Japan&#39;s leading private universities could not do <br/>
this kind of problem. Such students, it turns out, are not tested in <br/>
mathematics in the highly competitive entrance examinations; since they <br/>
have not seriously studied math for years, believes Nishimura, they <br/>
simply forgot what they learned in primary school.<br/>
<br/>
Most students in the national universities, for whom mathematics is a <br/>
required subject for the entrance examinations, are strong in the <br/>
subject. Judging from the test results for private university economics <br/>
faculties in which basic mathematical ability is needed just to <br/>
understand the lectures, private university students in general appear to <br/>
be deplorably poor at math.<br/>
<br/>
Pointing to the pronounced decline in the basic arithmetic and math <br/>
skills of university students, especially those in the humanities at <br/>
private universities, Nishimura calls for greater public attention to <br/>
this trend, declaring that it stems directly from the decision by the <br/>
humanities faculties of private universities to drop math and <br/>
science-related subjects from their entrance examinations.<br/>
<br/>
Nishimura blames the universities&#39; way of administering entrance <br/>
examinations for the problem, arguing that they deliberately invite <br/>
students who cannot do math by allowing them to choose between math, <br/>
geography, history, and social studies for their elective examination <br/>
subject (English and Japanese only being required). In every other major <br/>
country, math is a subject required for college entrance: the Scholastic <br/>
Aptitude Test (SAT) in the United States measures students&#39; scholastic <br/>
ability on the basis of English and math skills; China, Korea and all <br/>
other leading countries of both East and West designate math as a <br/>
required subject for university entrance exmination.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with this scholastic achievement decline is not just a matter <br/>
of being poor at math. Students in recent years do not ask questions and <br/>
seem to have little appetite for learning; they will master the learning <br/>
tasks they are assigned but show little interest in pursuing knowledge on <br/>
their own. University faculty do not hide their indignation at the <br/>
increasingly frequent number of students who enter engineering or science <br/>
departments by choice, but have taken only one subject (either physics or <br/>
chemistry) in high school and must receive remedial classes in <br/>
high-school level subjects as soon as they get into university.<br/>
<br/>
From April 2002, Japanese schools will go completely onto the five-day <br/>
week and will put into effect a considerably revised set of Ministry of <br/>
Education guidelines for the curriculum. Since the number of hours of <br/>
classroom time will decrease, the content of the curriculum must be cut <br/>
back. The ministry says its 30 percent trimming of the curriculum has <br/>
been done with meticulous care, but critics declare that such an <br/>
educational policy will only accelerate the decline in scholastic <br/>
achievement.<br/>
<br/>
At a time when administrations in many nations of the West have made <br/>
enhancement of the quality of primary and secondary education a priority <br/>
task and are adopting educational reforms aimed at raising standards of <br/>
scholastic achievement, critics charge that only Japan, ostensibly to <br/>
ease the pressure of competitive education on children, is moving in the <br/>
opposite direction with its cutbacks on curriculum that could aggravate <br/>
the decline in scholastic standards.<br/>
<br/>
The issue of declining scholastic achievement is difficult to verify <br/>
scientifically or statistically, so it has been difficult to carry on a <br/>
balanced discussion of the problems. The qualities that were once so <br/>
highly praised and looked up to in Japan&#39;s primary and secondary <br/>
education are no longer even mentioned. One wonders whether the high <br/>
estimation Japan&#39;s education system once enjoyed was nothing more than a <br/>
fleeting dream.<br/>
