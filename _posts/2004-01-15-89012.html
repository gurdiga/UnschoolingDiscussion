<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740982679">A homeschooling mom on my local list has some questions about<br/>
unschooling, because what they are doing now is making them miserable.<br/>
Her son is thirteen, and she would like to talk to some unschoolers<br/>
whose kids are teenagers (my kids are 11 and 7, and she feels she needs<br/>
to hear from someone whose kids are older).  If anyone has time to<br/>
answer some questions for her, would you email me for more info?  Thanks<br/>

Can&#39;t she just go to www.unschooling.com and read about teens there?<br/>
<br/>
Give her this:<br/>
