Things here are going really well.  My dd spends more and more time <br/>
working with my dh.  she loves it!  She is so happy and confident.<br/>
<br/>
We have been looking at where our life is leading us, and trying to <br/>
decide if we need to make changes or not - job changes and <br/>
destination changes.............<br/>
<br/>
My dd in UK has decided that she cant afford to visit us feb. 2002, <br/>
and has put it of untill 2003.  Her photo is at <br/>
www.pocklington.co.uk  click on hospitality and she is top right hand <br/>
corner.  <br/>

But all in all, I cant grumble!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-941692024">I happened to pick up a Psychology Today Magazine at the grocery store<br/>
and read an article about their 10 facts of intelligence. In a couple of<br/>
the &quot;facts&quot; it says that delaying school and not going to school<br/>
correlate to lower IQ. <br/>
It made me take pause as it goes against my beliefs about intelligence.<br/>
I don&#39;t know where they got the facts from. It seems to me unschooling<br/>
is a way to allow genius to emerge, by letting minds focus on what they<br/>
are passionate about. <br/>
I want to dispute the article, but my words aren&#39;t as articulate as some<br/>
of you could be so feel free to share ideas, cite studies, etc.<br/>
Certainly there is evidence that hs kids do better on standardized tests<br/>
and that can be pointed out. A part of me cares little about measuring<br/>
success and proving this point, but I wouldn&#39;t want a Psychology Today<br/>
article make a lot of people question homeschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, the key words are &quot;delaying&quot;, &quot;school&quot; and &quot;correlate&quot;. IQ is usually<br/>
defined by pychobabblists as something that is innate -- there is nothing you<br/>
can do to affect it one way or another.  So they are looking for the<br/>
&quot;correlates&quot; (what is found to be &quot;associated with&quot;, not cause or affect)<br/>
IQ.  (But remember that the same folks who gave us public education and<br/>
intelligence testing also gave us eugenics, and you know where that led!<br/>
Being a Kung Bushman or a forest residents of Papua-New Guinea would not<br/>
likely &quot;correlate&quot; with IQ either.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers do not &quot;delay&quot; school -- we &quot;deny&quot; school. We work with our<br/>
children (or they with us!) to both enhance and satisfy their natural<br/>
curiousity from a very early age, and there is no traumatic stress (the<br/>
wrenching away from family) to upset the learning urges, and no<br/>
&quot;post-traumatic stress syndrome&quot; (some folks call it ADHD) to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers do better on standardized tests, but that is likely because<br/>
their parents give a damn (and put their time and money where their mouths<br/>
are).  If they did worse, would it make a difference?  Making a statement<br/>
about it one way or the other lends validity to the tests.<br/>
