&lt;&lt; I asked him if he wanted<br/>
to go take a picture of the advertisement and explained to him that was<br/>
how it used to be done. He looked at me like I was an alien so I guessed<br/>
that was a no. :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you should take a photo for him, though.  Buildings get painted or <br/>
taken down.<br/>
<br/>
Once in a while here an old building weathers to the point that an old sign <br/>
shows through again!  Then we know they&#39;re about to paint it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I was sexually abused by 5 family members for 17<br/>
years which included 3 pregnancies at 9, 10, and 15.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OH GOD.<br/>
And in the forum someone was hesitant about telling her 12 year old about sex.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The laughable statistic at the time was 1 in a million people<br/>
get molested. I know it&#39;s half. I also know the national birth<br/>
statistics start at 10. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
More than half of the women I&#39;ve ever talked to were molested as children or <br/>
raped as teens.  <br/>
<br/>
I lucked out and had neither, but I am in the minority in my own personal <br/>
experience (from people with childhoods in the 1940&#39;s through 60&#39;s anyway; <br/>
I&#39;m HOPING it&#39;s better lately).<br/>
<br/>
Where do you live?  Maybe some of us could find you some cool resources or <br/>
trivia on the history of your town and you could share it with your son.<br/>
