Helpful? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers don&#39;t learn &quot;subjects&quot; (usually) the same way a <br/>
schooled child will. At the same time, they will certainly learn <br/>
about maths, history, the English language, foreign languages, <br/>
art, music, science, etc., in the course of their every-day or every-<br/>
year lives.<br/>

<br/>
Probably, but probably not at all in the way you&#39;re thinking of it.<br/>
<br/>
Even school kids don&#39;t learn all those subjects in school.  Is your question <br/>
whether unschoolers present the same subject matter as the public schools do?  <br/>
Very unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
What schools teach that is to be found readily in everyday life, unschooled <br/>
kids learn without even realizing they&#39;re learning it.<br/>

they are his own creation and his own way of manipulating numbers.  His <br/>

This morning Mia was watching Cinderella. The boys walked past during the<br/>
scenes where Lucifer is chasing the mice. Jess asked if a mouse&#39;s tail was<br/>
made of bone. Good question!! So we headed for the computer and downloaded a<br/>
picture of a mouse skeleton and sent off a question at a science site. Who<br/>
would have thought that Cinderella could be &quot;eductional&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Jacob was playing in the sandpit a couple of days ago and asked me what<br/>
would happen if you cooked sand. I knew that people made art glass from<br/>
heating sand at really high temps but didn&#39;t think just cooking it in the<br/>
oven would do much. We tried this morning  but it just stank so much we had<br/>
to stop. Oh well, we know that sand stinks when it is cooked!!!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not really about learning subjects as much as it is learning how to<br/>
learn. If my kids retain their curiosity and sense of wonder and are not<br/>
afraid to make mistakes and to ask questions, then I think I&#39;ll feel like<br/>
I&#39;ve succeeded at unschooling.<br/>

do unschoolers learn the same subjects as compulsory school kids?<br/>
############<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of like asking if apples grow the same as oranges. Apples need a <br/>
different climate, different soil, different amounts of water, different <br/>
fertilizer...  Not saying that schooled kids need different things than unschooled <br/>
kids, just that we approach learning in such a way as it is natural and not <br/>
divided into subjects and hours and requirements at this or that age level. So if <br/>
you ask if my daughter Moly at the age of nine, almost ten, knows her <br/>
multiplication tables like her schooled peers, then no. But she does multiplication <br/>
and division in her head that wasn&#39;t &quot;taught&quot; in the teacher/book/student sense. <br/>
And she doesn&#39;t call what she does multiplication or division, it is just s<br/>
omething she does. OTOH, if I were to put a worksheet of math problems in front <br/>
of her, she probably wouldn&#39;t be able to do it. <br/>
<br/>
If you are asking if unschooled kids do science or history like schooled <br/>
kids, then the answer is again no. If you have been reading all the books and get <br/>
the impression that after a few months of deschooling (if your kids have been <br/>
in school) your kids will start asking for a history book or a science book, <br/>
then probably not. What does happen is that a child develops an interest in a <br/>
movie or a game and wants to learn more about the time period. So you would <br/>
then try to provide interesting books and movies and other things to help your <br/>
child. I&#39;m going to use the movie and TV program Stargate as an example. A child <br/>
might like to watch the program and want to learn about ancient Egypt, or <br/>
space technology, or the AirForce, or aliens, or weapons and warfare. Any of <br/>
those things would &quot;teach&quot; a child history, math, science, or reading, but again, <br/>
not divided into those subjects. A child wouldn&#39;t see it that he was learning <br/>
history as a subject. A child would see that he was learning about what <br/>
interests him. Or they might see a TV program about lizards and amphibians and think <br/>
mud puppies look cool and want to learn more about them. In either situation, <br/>
you wouldn&#39;t hand a nine year old a third or fourth grade history or science <br/>
book to answer those questions. <br/>
<br/>
If you are asking about reading, then we all have a wide variety of parents <br/>
here with children who all have read a different times in their lives. Some <br/>
didn&#39;t start until they were nine, ten, eleven, or twelve. Some started earlier. <br/>
All by the time they are teens read as well as the next. Some kids are like my <br/>
Moly who read all the time, some are like Jack who read as little as possible <br/>
and only if it is very interesting and has to do with what ever he is doing <br/>
at that point. The rest fall everywhere in between. So in that aspect <br/>
unschooled kids are just like schooled kids in their reading tastes, but unschooled <br/>
kids aren&#39;t forced or made to feel bad about being late readers or that reading <br/>
isn&#39;t their thing. And honestly we shouldn&#39;t even use the term late reader. The <br/>
child is just reading on his or her own time and terms, not late or early. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps! :o)<br/>

On the snack sized Snickers bars the kids got for Halloween, Dexter (from <br/>
Dexter&#39;s Laboratory) is pictured with a little quip. They say things like &quot;The <br/>
scientific name for stinky feet is Bromhidrosis&quot; or &quot;85% of the population can <br/>
curl their tongue into a U&quot; or &quot;Your foot and your forearm (from the wrist to <br/>
the inside of your elbow) are the same length&quot; So far, from Halloween candy, we <br/>
have called my cousin, a doctor, to ask how to say Bromhidrosis, the kids <br/>
have measured their feet and their forearms, and have entertained each other with <br/>
mirrors and curling their tongues. Cinderella and Snickers bars, both <br/>
educational. <br/>

Marty,  unschooled for his whole 14 years, asked for &quot;a map of the New Mexico <br/>
territory when Arizona was part of it&quot; a few weeks ago.  Cool!  I happened to <br/>
have a book with that kind of stuff, and I knew where it was.  Then we went <br/>
to a museum.  Then I ordered him a map from a dealer.<br/>

It&#39;s not just:   History question?  Read this book.<br/>

across the board, 100% unschooled kid, and she can do math. We were <br/>
leafing through a sales flyer last night, and because we&#39;re being <br/>
firm with our grocery budget, she wanted to know if we could afford <br/>
some boxed sugar cereal that was on sale five for 10 bucks. Without <br/>
blinking, she knew how much per box, and I showed her how to run the <br/>
calculator to figure how much per pound (even on sale, Frosted Flakes <br/>
are over $2.50 a lb!!!)<br/>
<br/>
She knew Ramen noodles at 10 for $1.00 were 10 cents each, but had to <br/>
think a minute...all in her head.<br/>
<br/>
AND!!! she sees the price 2.99, and says &quot;that&#39;s $3.00&quot; so she&#39;s <br/>
already got consumer savvy that many people never do acquire. ;)<br/>
