&lt;&lt; I think it was <br/>
cause he just liked saying Butt. He&#39;s somewhat odd. (just the way I like <br/>
&#39;em!) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly asked why there was such a word as &quot;buttocks&quot; but no <br/>
&quot;asstocks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That is a funny question!! &lt;G&gt;  Ass is from &quot;arse,&quot; which wasn&#39;t in  writing <br/>
much but the OED&#39;s first citation is 1000 (1002 years ago), and &quot;buttocks&quot; <br/>
didn&#39;t arise (**ahem**) until the 14th century.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s friends have been using the verb &quot;to school&quot; a lot, as in &quot;You&#39;ve <br/>
been schooled&quot; or &quot;He&#39;s schooling Kirby upstairs,&quot; or &quot;Dude!! He SCHOOLED <br/>
you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And it means to whip someone&#39;s buttocks in a game.   Video, cards, <br/>
whatever--better a one-on-one victory, and that, to them is &quot;to school <br/>
someone.&quot;<br/>
