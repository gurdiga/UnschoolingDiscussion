<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438428266">I was telling Holly about how some families have jumped too far too fast into <br/>
freedoms about bedtimes and food choices and tv, and when it didn&#39;t work out <br/>
right away they were grumpy at the unschoolers who had advised them.  I told <br/>
her we needed to figure out how to describe some intermediate steps.<br/>
<br/>
She said:<br/>
<br/>
[start Holly]<br/>
<br/>
 Well like for bedtimes, if the kids used to go to bed at 9:00, the parents <br/>
should just let 9:00 go by and see what the kids say.  They might say &quot;Come <br/>
tuck me in,&quot; or they might say &quot;Do you know what time it is?&quot;  Or they might <br/>
say &quot;SUCKA FISH, I&#39;m awake and you&#39;re not.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[end Holly]<br/>
<br/>
I believe by that she meant &quot;one step at a time&quot; or something to that effect. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ROFLOL!<br/>
<br/>
We have not lifted bedtimes, but have taken the first step just as <br/>
Holly suggested. We have just let bedtimes go by. We also have <br/>
had TV shows on past their bedtimes and have said little or <br/>
nothing about it.<br/>
<br/>
One funny thing that has changed. My dh asks me stuff like: <br/>
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t the younger ones be in bed? or do you think this is <br/>
okay?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Last night I said, &quot;Well, 10:30 is pretty late for Jacob, so maybe <br/>
we can let him know it&#39;s time for bed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Dh said, &quot;Okay, but I am going to play him StarCraft on the <br/>
computer first.&quot; (Jon gets home really late on Wed after <br/>
teaching.) I said fine.<br/>
<br/>
By 1:00 in the morning, they were still going!!!! I finally put MY foot <br/>
down. Jacob was bleary-eyed and begging for bed, but Jon still <br/>
had several stations to annihilate. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think bedtimes ar definitely on their way out. Especially <br/>
if the lack of bedtimes continues to foster the &quot;killer&quot; spirit in their <br/>
dad! &lt;beg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
OK.. I found it. I will cut and paste it here.. sorry folks who have already <br/>

<br/>
___<br/>
I understand exactly what you are asking, and I am still struggling with <br/>
understanding the concept as well. I dont know your situation, but for me, <br/>
homeschooling is brand new. The ideals of unschooling are very VERY <br/>
&quot;foriegn&quot; to me ( PLEASE God dont let anyone rip me apart for my <br/>
admission..) I am very eager to learn all I can, but I think that its much <br/>
more difficult for families to &quot;convert&quot; to a completely new way of thinking, <br/>
<br/>
parenting and relating to each other. For families that have always <br/>
subscribed to attachement parenting and unschooling, there is ( was) no <br/>
transition period. It wasn&#39;t something they had to learn, it has always been <br/>
thier way of life. Sometimes I get the feeling like .. OK.. lets say I have <br/>
never driven a car. I WANT to drive a car. I think cars are great.. I am <br/>
ready to learn how to drive a car and I want to drive it well. A person who <br/>
has been driving since they were 14 hands me keys and a car manual and says.. <br/>
<br/>
OK.. get in, turn it on, and start driving. I would of course ask <br/>
questions, I would be unclear on every aspect of operating a car and <br/>
driving. When I asked questions or made comments, the veteran driver would <br/>
act all irriated, insult me, be sarcastic, basically treat me like an idiot <br/>
because I dont know how to drive a car. If I asked , how do I parallel <br/>
park? They might reply, park alongside the road where the lines indicate. <br/>
??!?!?!?!?!? That tells me nothing. Questions that &quot;new&quot; unschoolers have , <br/>
especially, &quot;converts&quot;.. often don&#39;t apply to veteran unschoolers and they <br/>
may answer them with answers like. &quot;that never happens to me&quot; Or, &quot;I dont <br/>
see that as a problem in my family&quot; Or, &quot; Ive never done it any other way&quot; <br/>
It has to be difficult to respond to questions and situations that one has <br/>
never dealt with.. BUT, I think sometimes we all have to use a little empathy <br/>
<br/>
and try to see the other parties point of view. <br/>
___________<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.. someone else asked a while back about the &quot;framework&quot; that we need <br/>
to replace the old stuff with.  That framework takes a long time, and a lot <br/>
of learning and understanding to get in place.    I really think that the <br/>
frustrations that newbies have come from the IN YOUR FACE attitudes that they <br/>
encounter when they first &quot;confess thier sins&quot; of  not radically unschooling. <br/>
  Its like folks say.. STOP DOING THAT!  ITS WRONG.. YOUR DAMAGING YOUR KID.. <br/>
lots of times this advice is offered in a condescending or annoyed tone.   <br/>
So, what do we do.. OMG... we better STOP.. CHANGE .. DO IT THIS WAY.... Then <br/>
we encounter problems because the framework wasnt in place.. We DID take <br/>
giant steps and not baby steps because that is the attitude with which the <br/>
advice was given.  Its even been said, folks arent here to babyify newbies.  <br/>
They are not here to  support us.  They are not here to sugar coat things and <br/>
spoon feed us.  They are here to give us the low down, nothing but the truth, <br/>
take this pill and swallow it REAL advice on  REAL unschooling.   And, hey, <br/>
thats fine..  Ive said before, I dont need to be coddled.  But when the hard <br/>
hitting advice doesnt just BAMO-PRESTO work like a charm,  its not fair for <br/>
the &quot;veterans&quot; to THEN tell us. OH. sorry, we left out the transitioning <br/>
stuff.. the framework, the small steps...  Herein lies the failures and <br/>
frustrations of the struggling new unschooler.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335177384">&lt;&lt;I think that its much more difficult for families to &quot;convert&quot; to a<br/>
completely new way of thinking, parenting and relating to each other.<br/>

unschooling, there is ( was) no transition period. It wasn&#39;t something<br/>
they had to learn&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Since Jayn is just over three, we have always planned on homeschooling,<br/>
and I was reading Holt before she was born, I guess I would be one of<br/>
the &quot;always subscribed&quot; group, brief as this period is. However I still<br/>
get really useful jolts to my thinking from this forum.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Someone recently posted about parents deschooling from all the 12 (or<br/>
however many) years of their own education process, as well as their<br/>
children needing to. That made me think. Then this morning one of my<br/>
husband&#39;s friends told him that &quot;Jayn was a little young for a three<br/>
year old. Was I still nursing?&quot; Yes. &quot;That will do it.&quot; The occasion had<br/>
been a very loud and boisterous birthday party for a five year old , and<br/>
all her school friends. And Jayn is a reserved and cautious person in a<br/>
new situation. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My initial reaction was to feel defensive, before I realized that all of<br/>
this comparative thinking is SCHOOL THINKING, looking at Jayn relative<br/>
to some average or norm. I realized that I was defensive because for a<br/>
moment I was buying into the school thinking - for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In &quot;In My Wildest Dreams&quot; by Gail Blanke, a workshop leader is talking<br/>
about racism - that in the United States it is like rain, if you go<br/>
outside you are going to get wet. School language and thinking is like<br/>
that too, and we have to be vigilant about our umbrellas. <br/>

Gutsy post. Thank you! I think you are right that some of us who <br/>
are new are just trying to figure the whole durned thing out. We <br/>
aren&#39;t trying to be belligerent or to challenge the philosophy. (I&#39;m <br/>
realizing now, for instance, that some of my language was <br/>
inflammatory and I didn&#39;t even know it!) And perhaps some <br/>
women have come to debate whether unschooling is even viable <br/>
or right.<br/>
<br/>
But most of us are just tryin&#39; to learn. So thanks for taking a risk <br/>
and articulating it. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269899253">I like the idea of intermediate steps.<br/>
<br/>
Thats really how it has been happening with us.  I&#39;m still not sure I&#39;d call myself a radical (yet) but I&#39;m definitely moving in that direction.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing I gave up on was bedtime, that was years ago.<br/>
<br/>
The second thing I gave up on was food control...who eats what and when.<br/>
<br/>
The third thing I gave up on was the time we got up in the mornings.<br/>
<br/>
About the same time, I gave up on everything academic except reading, writing, and rithmetic.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;ve pretty much given up everything, but still worry about arithmetic.<br/>
<br/>
But then I remind myself that they have learned so much on their own already, really....what is to stop them from picking up fractions when they actually have to use them?  Isn&#39;t that how they&#39;ve learned EVERYTHING else?  Even when they WERE in school?????<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m *starting* to get the hang of &quot;strewing&quot; but dreaming again, and letting my kids dream and committing myself to following our dreams as much as we are able.<br/>
<br/>
And when I commit myself to following dreams, I&#39;m less worried about things like Arithmetic because our dreams are so much RICHER than just plain old arithmetic.  Really, why would I trade our wonderful dreams for arithmetic?<br/>
<br/>
We watched a movie tonight about a Middle School Dance Team and what they did to realize their dreams and the dance teacher&#39;s regret in giving up on herself too soon.  It made me thing NOW is the time that my kids have to follow their dreams, in spite of the fact that they are so young.  NOW is the time to cultivate dreaming and planning and loving every moment of life.<br/>
<br/>
And yes...we are in the midst of achievement testing.  (Don&#39;t shoot me LOL).  I agree with Sandra, they really are NOT a good idea, even when they are mandated (they are here).  But I&#39;m keeping it all in perspective by counterbalancing it with lots and lots of dreaming and planning and thinking of ALL the grand possibilities.<br/>

What we (&quot;we&quot; being ten or a dozen people I&#39;m thinking of who are regular <br/>
posters and have been for some time--not a clique, not a club, just &quot;the <br/>
regulars&quot;) try to convey is WHY we do what we do.  The what is secondary.<br/>
<br/>
But some people (and several lately, seems suddenly several) jump to the what <br/>
without understanding the why.<br/>
<br/>
The why hasn&#39;t been kept secret, I don&#39;t think.<br/>
<br/>
For me personally, if I don&#39;t first understand why, I&#39;m changing NOTHING.  <br/>
I&#39;m doing nothing.  Not vaccinations, circumcision/not circumcision, not <br/>
nursing, not ANYTHING until people have told me what they know about why and <br/>
where I can look for more information.  But *I* do the looking.   I don&#39;t <br/>
subscribe to one single person or group and say &quot;I&#39;ll just do what you say to <br/>
do, you don&#39;t have to tell me why.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I joined La Leche League, I also read other people&#39;s breastfeeding <br/>
stuff.  I read history of breastfeeding and learned lots of surprising stuff <br/>
about the preponderance of wetnurses in the 16 and 1700&#39;s.  It was rare for <br/>
women of rank to nurse their own babies.  And THAT is where the formula <br/>
feeding glory comes from.  Cultural tradition that breastfeeding is something <br/>
that poor women are paid to do for a while, while they neglect their own <br/>
child in favor of the other child&#39;s neebe the end-all to anyone&#39;s problems, <br/>
and we can&#39;t fairly be blamed if someone is having a rough time incorporating <br/>
this into their personal lives.   <br/>
<br/>
These incidents help me explain things more clearly the next time, but that&#39;s <br/>
the question I&#39;ve been asking here in the forum and that I asked of Holly.  <br/>
How can we help people get from point A to point B?<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t expect to be jumped for sharing what Holly said.  I thought it was <br/>
good, in an eleven year old kind of way.<br/>

&gt; stuff.. the framework, the small steps...  Herein lies the failures and<br/>
&gt; frustrations of the struggling new unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been on message boards and lists for 8 years trying to get unschooling<br/>
and conscious parenting ideas across. I&#39;ve seen how people describe it<br/>
evolve over that time. It&#39;s been slow but it is evolving.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the reason it&#39;s so slow is that the people giving advice don&#39;t get a<br/>
lot of feedback on how their words are being interpretted. There&#39;s a number<br/>
of reasons for that. Most people don&#39;t want to hold up what they&#39;re doing<br/>
for pubic examination. (We could fruitlessly discuss why they don&#39;t want to<br/>
do it here, but honestly it happens everywhere. People just don&#39;t like to<br/>
feel like fools in public.) They don&#39;t want others to realize they don&#39;t get<br/>
it so they convince themselves that they do understand or that they will<br/>
understand if they think about it or wait a while and read some more. Or<br/>
they *think* they understand. (That&#39;s probably the biggie.)<br/>
<br/>
Occasionaly a really brave person -- just as you did -- will come back and<br/>
tell us what they tried and what happened and that gives some feedback on<br/>
how the words are being interpretted and people can try to figure out how to<br/>
explain better.<br/>
<br/>
Describing it *is* getting better. But it&#39;s far from being perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Another problem is that conscious parenting (and to some extent unschooling)<br/>
if it were described to those who already understand, wouldn&#39;t sound much<br/>
different than what people using standard parenting practices do. Conscious<br/>
parenting is basically recognizing that kids don&#39;t have the skills that<br/>
adults do, so we help them live life. (Which would include, without saying<br/>
it, helping them acquire the skills they need). It&#39;s not that much different<br/>
than an authoritarian, spanking parent might say. Or a school at homer. But<br/>
obviously in practice it&#39;s poles apart!<br/>
<br/>
If conscious parenting and unschooling were rule based, we could easily say<br/>
&quot;Kids need help with this, this and this and you can drop helping them with<br/>
that, that and that.&quot; But it isn&#39;t rule based. It&#39;s based on the philosophy<br/>
of listening to what you&#39;re kids are saying with their words and behavior<br/>
and helping them get what they want out of life. And that&#39;s a really hard<br/>
idea to convey accurately. Especially since most parents are certain they do<br/>
that already. And trying to get them to see how disrespectful standard<br/>
parenting practices are without them feeling that they as people are<br/>
disrespectful is a challenging task. (&quot;What do you mean I&#39;m not respectful<br/>
of my kids!?&quot;) It&#39;s as hard as getting across the concept to a child that<br/>
just because I don&#39;t like what you&#39;re doing doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t like you.<br/>
It&#39;s a challenge to discuss the actions without the person thinking their<br/>
character is being discussed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really grateful to the people who *can* discuss their actions without<br/>
taking it personally. I&#39;d say it&#39;s one of the major things that makes the<br/>
unschooling discussions most helpful to those just starting out. It&#39;s what<br/>
helps make the discussions more than a book of advice because people can see<br/>
the transitions in someone&#39;s thinking going on right in front of them. They<br/>
can see the wrong turns in thinking someone made and why those seemed like<br/>
sensible turns based on their incomplete understanding. (Ren&#39;s journey, as I<br/>
recall, was particularly helpful :-) It&#39;s still there on the message boards<br/>
at Unschooling.com)<br/>
<br/>
And another problem is that there are a number of changes in thinking people<br/>
need to make in order to understand. Most people can only focus on making<br/>
one change at a time. But if they only make one change, then the words mean<br/>
something different than what the advice giver intends. An example is that<br/>
if someone is working on giving up control, then &quot;no bedtimes&quot; will get<br/>
translated into &quot;let the kids stay up as late as they want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I could tell Sandra in a conversation that I&#39;m helping Kathryn figure out<br/>
math and she&#39;d understand what I mean. But if I say that to someone who<br/>
thinks kids need taught math, they won&#39;t interpret the words the same at<br/>
all. They&#39;re going to translate it as I sit her down and teach her math.<br/>
They&#39;re going to try to put what I say into a context they already<br/>
understand.<br/>
<br/>
And that translating of words into already understood contexts is the<br/>
essence of the problem. No one has the unschooling/conscious parenting<br/>
contexts to translate the words into. We have to help them create new<br/>
contexts so the words mean what we intend them to mean.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a really good book about the process of thinking. It&#39;s called The<br/>
Society of Mind (by Marvin Minsky I think). It&#39;s about how we build up these<br/>
little piece of understanding to understand larger things. I think one of<br/>
the examples he used was how we figure out how a fast food restaurant<br/>
operates if we&#39;ve had experience with sit down restaurants and other things.<br/>
It&#39;s built up of mostly of things that we already understand that had just<br/>
never been put together like that. Or that are the same in essence but<br/>
slightly different in practice. And some totally new things. Like paying for<br/>
things at the cash register, and seeing the connection between ordering off<br/>
a menu on a wall and ordering off a menu in our hands. That wasn&#39;t his<br/>
example exactly, but there was something similar.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to provide for people. We&#39;re trying to<br/>
deconstruct what they understand and build a new model from totally<br/>
different pieces. People already possess most of the pieces but they hadn&#39;t<br/>
been used that way before. But during the process of building a new model,<br/>
people will insist on using the old models and trying to understand from the<br/>
old models. For example, most people can&#39;t help translating unschooling into<br/>
neglect because that&#39;s the model they already have that most closely<br/>
resembles what they&#39;re hearing described.<br/>
<br/>
So how do you describe something that needs a point of view shift to<br/>
understand? Most people start with trying to help someone shift their point<br/>
of view. *That&#39;s* the transition that most people are trying to help others<br/>
make. They&#39;re trying to help them understand what the principles are and why<br/>
they work so that someone can make their own decisions. It&#39;s the difference<br/>
in thinking between stopping at a stop sign because it says stop, and<br/>
stopping because the principle behind where stop signs are placed is to<br/>
indicate intersections where there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;re going to get hit<br/>
by cross traffic if you don&#39;t stop and look.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I use a lot of &quot;what if your husband did that to you?&quot; examples.<br/>
That gets the different point of view part across but it can&#39;t give the<br/>
whole unschooling/conscious parenting picture. It implies hands off<br/>
parenting. Honestly seeing what the world looks like through the eyes of<br/>
someone with entirely different needs is an *important* aspect to grasp, but<br/>
if that&#39;s the *only* aspect they grasp then they&#39;re going to get a false<br/>
picture of what people are trying to say.<br/>
<br/>
Until we figure out some good ways of getting the concepts across -- and<br/>
it&#39;s not going to happen any time soon -- it&#39;s helpful to accept that lots<br/>
of stuff is going to get mistranslated. It&#39;s like unschoolers are speaking a<br/>
foreign language. The problem is the language sounds exactly like English so<br/>
it seems like we&#39;re communicating. But the two languages have different<br/>
definitions for words that sound and look the same.<br/>

from.   I dont think this is a &quot;sudden&quot; thing around here.  I think that what <br/>
has happened is by coincidence, a few ladies have stuck around and had the <br/>
courage to continue to explore unschooling and  ask questions.    Usually <br/>
it&#39;s one lone soul who seems to struggle with no empathy from anyone.  Most <br/>
folks just leave out of intimidation and lick thier wounds.   There is <br/>
strength in numbers.  If a couple of folks speak out.. others will join in <br/>
and say..&quot;me too&quot;  because they felt alone and out numbered.    Its not an <br/>
&quot;us&quot;  &quot;them&quot; type of situation. We are all here for the same reasons.. Some <br/>
of us are just much lower on the ladder.. the continum.   <br/>

people get defensive that defensiveness says &quot;I don&#39;t like your advice. I<br/>
want something that sounds right to my way of thinking.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying people are wrong to be defensive. It&#39;s natural. I&#39;m a<br/>
defensive person. But *if* someone is seeking to understand something<br/>
totally new and radical, being defensive is like shooting themselves in the<br/>
foot. They&#39;re saying &quot;I want to change but I don&#39;t want to change the way<br/>
you say I need to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a lack of empathy, though I *do* understand how it gets read like<br/>
that. If people are spending hours helping someone and that person comes<br/>
back and says your advice was lousy then they&#39;re cutting themselves off from<br/>
the empathy. If they try the advice and it fails and say &quot;Help, I don&#39;t<br/>
understand!&quot; they&#39;ll get lots of empathy.<br/>

essence of the problem.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a newish word for that.  It&#39;s called &quot;exfomation.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
When people have common experiences and knowledge, they can communicate more <br/>
efficiently than those who don&#39;t have those experiences.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s probably the theory behind the E.D. Hirsch stuff about having <br/>
common cultural information, so that if people mention Jacob and Esau, others <br/>
there don&#39;t have to say &quot;WHO?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
That way similes and analogies and puns will make sense to lots of people.<br/>
<br/>
But within a group like this, if someone makes reference to something most of <br/>
the people know about, it&#39;s a cultural shorthand.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There&#39;s a really good book about the process of thinking. It&#39;s called The<br/>
Society of Mind (by Marvin Minsky I think). It&#39;s about how we build up these<br/>
little piece of understanding to understand larger things. I think one of<br/>
the examples he used was how we figure out how a fast food restaurant<br/>
operates if we&#39;ve had experience with sit down restaurants and other things.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe like this?  (Or maybe I&#39;m mis-guessing.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Can one intense interest come to represent or lead to all others?  A mom <br/>
once complained that her son was interested in nothing but World War II.  <br/>
There are college professors and historians who are interested in nothing but <br/>
World War II.  It can become a life’s work.  But even a passing interest can <br/>
touch just about everything—geography, politics, the history and current <br/>
events of Europe and parts of the Pacific, social history of the 20th century <br/>
in the United States, military technology, tactics, recruitment and <br/>
propaganda, poster art/production/distribution, advances in communications, <br/>
transport of troops and food and supplies, espionage, prejudices, interment <br/>
camps, segregation, patriotism, music, uniforms, insignia, religion….<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;When someone really understands one war, he can easily understand another, <br/>
because he will have all the framework and questions in his mind.  When he <br/>
understands how countries are born, invaded, and how a government can die <br/>
out, he understands truths about all nations and civilizations.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But there may be no overriding interest like chess or WWII in a child’s <br/>
life yet, and might rarely be.  So then where do parents go with their <br/>
fearful unschooling energy?&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, now I understand. Because it isn&#39;t changing the vocabulary. It&#39;s<br/>
acquiring new meanings for the words we thought we already knew.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like my &quot;lowing&quot; example that Kelly keeps alluding to. ;-) We build up<br/>
definitions for words example by example, slowly refining them over the<br/>
years so that our definition makes sense in the contexts we&#39;ve encountered<br/>
the word in. We know what &quot;sit&quot; means because we&#39;ve had a few million<br/>
encounters with it in a huge range of contexts. But most of us probably only<br/>
have a *guess* what we think lowing might mean just because our encouters<br/>
with it are so few. We just don&#39;t have enough examples to have tested and<br/>
refined the definition on to feel confident that we know for sure.<br/>
<br/>
All the words we know are somewhere on that spectrum from totally clear<br/>
understanding to a fuzzy understanding that has worked for us so far. Our<br/>
definitions work for the contexts we&#39;ve encountered. If we&#39;ve had a lot of<br/>
encounters and don&#39;t come across any new contexts, our definitions won&#39;t<br/>
refine any further and we&#39;ll be pretty certain we know what a word means.<br/>
Like sit. We&#39;re pretty sure we&#39;re not going to encounter a context that will<br/>
turn our understanding on it&#39;s ear.<br/>
<br/>
And *that&#39;s* where people are when the come here. They *know* what respect<br/>
is. They *know* what learning means. The definitions they have have always<br/>
worked in the contexts they&#39;ve encountered.<br/>
<br/>
But here are new contexts. The contexts *will* help people build up a<br/>
clearer understanding of the words they thought were already clear. But<br/>
people tend to read the new contexts using the old definitions because it<br/>
isn&#39;t totally clear right off that the old definitions don&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
Refining definitions takes time and lots and lots of examples. We could hand<br/>
someone the definition but it doesn&#39;t mean anything without the examples to<br/>
compare it to.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve talked before about<br/>
&gt; respect and choices. Just about everyone beleives they give their kids that.<br/>
&gt; It is more than that. How do you communicate to others, including dh, what<br/>
&gt; you really mean? Maybe using the &quot; what if your friend did/said that to<br/>
&gt; you?&quot; example will help to explain better. I know I&#39;ve read it before but it<br/>
&gt; just didn&#39;t come together for me until now. I&#39;ve come a long way since<br/>
&gt; conference.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if we knew that we wouldn&#39;t be having this conversation! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I think awareness that the words we&#39;re using aren&#39;t creating the same mental<br/>
picture for someone else that they do for us helps us understand where we&#39;re<br/>
going wrong. Knowing how to fix it is, of course, something else.<br/>
<br/>
Analogies help. But it&#39;s helpful to be aware that we intend for the analogy<br/>
to describe a piece of something larger. And the person trying to understand<br/>
doesn&#39;t know which piece of the analogy is relevant to what piece of the new<br/>
thing they&#39;re trying to understand.<br/>
<br/>
The husband and wife analogies are good examples. After one of mine, Julie<br/>
(I think?) responded that her husband does ask for help with the yard work<br/>
and she goes and helps him. And that&#39;s the goal parents generally have in<br/>
mind: I ask for something, the kids just naturally understand how important<br/>
it is, so they do it. So in that way the husband and wife analogies are<br/>
misleading because someone is going to think parts of it apply (the adult<br/>
understanding of what&#39;s needed) that don&#39;t apply. (Which is why I try to<br/>
pick ridiculous examples of what husbands are asking us to do ;-) Because<br/>
what we as adults are asking seems equally ridiculous to kids.)<br/>
<br/>
So far no one has come upon the right phrase that turns on all the light<br/>
bulbs to illuminate the point of view that people didn&#39;t realize existed. It<br/>
takes lots of reading, lots of examples, lots of trying and thinking about<br/>
why things work and don&#39;t work, lots of time. It&#39;s what people need to learn<br/>
anything new.<br/>

<br/>
Last night Kirby and Holly were off at a Harry Potter tournament, Keith was <br/>
watching a movie, and I was feeling very sick and tired.<br/>
<br/>
The sink was overflowing with dishes.  I just wanted to drink some juice and <br/>
go to bed, but there wasn&#39;t a glass in the cabinet.<br/>
<br/>
Had I been younger I might have just cried.<br/>
<br/>
But I called Marty (who&#39;s 14) and asked him if he was at a pausing point <br/>
(thinking he was playing a video game).  He said &quot;I was watching TV.&quot;  I <br/>
asked if he could help me at the commercial.  He said it wasn&#39;t an important <br/>
show and he could help me then.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him to help me unload and load the dishwasher.<br/>
<br/>
I could have asked him to do it himself, but he would have felt put-upon, <br/>
there are things he&#39;s not quite sure how best to fit in there, and there are <br/>
things I know exactly where I want put.<br/>
<br/>
He said &quot;Sure!&quot;  and then he said &quot;The counter&#39;s getting messed up again too&quot; <br/>
and he started putting things away which had just gradually been left out, <br/>
like salt shakers and extra napkins and empty cans and plastic containers <br/>
which weren&#39;t stacked.  <br/>
<br/>
When we emptied the dishwasher, I did the technical stuff and what needed no <br/>
walking, and he did the easy stuff and what needed to go several steps away, <br/>
because my foot was hurting.<br/>
<br/>
When it was loaded and going and the kitchen looked MUCH better, it hadn&#39;t <br/>
taken more than about five minutes.  I said &quot;Thanks, Marty.  It was way <br/>
easier and more fun with two of us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He smiled and agreed.<br/>

    Then I get back the &quot;But their only kids. They don&#39;t have the experience<br/>
I do.&quot; kind of answer. Trust is foreign and hard for so many parents. I just<br/>
want to help but they just can&#39;t hear me or trust in what I am saying. It&#39;s<br/>
so sad. :-( All I can do is try to say it in such a way to make them think<br/>
about it.<br/>

    I&#39;ll use that new approach at this months meetings. And with my husband<br/>
too.;-) Maybe then they&#39;ll get it better.<br/>
    I don&#39;t always feel that time is on my side when it comes to my oldest<br/>
(17yo) I keep trying. He is just so recluse. He still blames me for thinking<br/>
he would know what to do with himself/learn at 10yo when I took him out of<br/>
school. Blaming and excuses are big one to overcome. I asked him the other<br/>
day if he was happy with the way thing are. He said &quot;I don&#39;t know, I guess&quot;<br/>
When I asked him if he could do anything different, something he&#39;d like to<br/>
do, in the near future, he answered with I don&#39;t know. That is such a<br/>
typical answer for him. I try to go back to these questions or tell him he<br/>
can answer me later after he thinks about it. The answers still the same.<br/>
How am I to help him get what he wants if he won&#39;t let me help him.I try my<br/>
bset not to pressure him but he does need to think about his future and what<br/>
he wants out of it. I encourage and I guess that&#39;s the best I can do. Time<br/>
will tell. Anyone have any suggestions?<br/>
    He does go to class once a week for Computer Network Administration.<br/>
It&#39;s been pretty boring this year since they lost their sponsor at Lucent<br/>
Technology. They are temporarily at a school but they can&#39;t use any of their<br/>
equipment. :-( I was hoping this would give him a step into an<br/>
apprenticeship. Now I&#39;m not sure what to do to help him. Small picture of<br/>
life as we know it. Well I&#39;ve rambled on enough. :-)<br/>

place to tell anyone they have to change.  When I get the response about &quot;But <br/>
they&#39;re only kids...&quot; I just say they are young and they can benefit from my <br/>
experience...but I don&#39;t force it on them.  We talk and they pick and choose <br/>
what they want to hear.  I don&#39;t get into confrontation.  I learn a lot by <br/>
being around them.  When they spend the whole of play group talking about <br/>
what phonics curriculum is best I learn that I am soooo glad it isn&#39;t me.  <br/>
They always come back to me as the odity and say how do you teach your boys <br/>
to read.  I say I don&#39;t.  They say how do they learn.  I say by being read to <br/>
and seeing words. Dallen already reads and Phillip is getting it.  We can <br/>
have a good dialogue.  I guess the homeschoolers I am around are not pushy in <br/>
their belief either.  We all get along.  Maybe I am lucky that way.  If I <br/>
can&#39;t be around unschoolers at least I am around nice people.<br/>
