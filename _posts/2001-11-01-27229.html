Choices folks.  Choices for people who are just starting out, would like to <br/>
start out, are going thru a transition in their life, or are just regular <br/>
people, like me.  Not everyone is at the same place in their life.  <br/>

They don&#39;t care about these kids and at least 2, if not 3 now are under<br/>

are showing up half way or even later in the school year.<br/>

Now.  Maybe it used to be.  But the times they are a&#39;changin.<br/>

Maybe a lot of things will happen in coming years that none of us can <br/>
imagine.  Some good.  Some bad.  <br/>

I think hsers can spend their time bemoaning the changes coming or they can <br/>
look at things as they are evolving and make it better than it would be <br/>
without the insights that hsers can provide.<br/>

Things will not stop changing just because some of us think there have been <br/>
enough changes.<br/>

alternative programs in Texas, Pennsylvanie, and California. They didn&#39;t<br/>
change their name, either - because of a new state law they had to<br/>
de-centralize, and they did so by helping many school distracts open<br/>
homeschooling charters, while they acted as consultants, procurred<br/>
initial funding, etc. The charters one2one works with are now very<br/>
different from each other, and they tend to more reflect the values of<br/>
their individual communities. Unfortunately, the one I ended up working<br/>
for was located in a really conservative area....<br/>

extrapolating it to cover all situations where there are charters or ps <br/>
homeschooling programs.  The problem with that is that they aren&#39;t all like <br/>
that.  I&#39;ve explained how it works in BC.  You&#39;re obviously familiar with <br/>
how it works in Calif., at least in your area.  What about other <br/>
folks?  How is it actually working in other parts of the States?  At this <br/>
time, I think BC is the only province with these kinds of programs.  In <br/>
Alberta, all homeschoolers have to jump through more hoops than the <br/>
Electronic bus families in BC.  They get money, but have no choice to opt <br/>
out.  I&#39;m sure this is what a lot of people are concerned about, but it <br/>
didn&#39;t happen in Alberta because of charter schools or ps homeschooling <br/>
programs.  It happened because some homeschoolers pushed for financial <br/>
support, and the government decided to give it to everyone, no opting <br/>
out.  This is what we&#39;re working to prevent in BC.<br/>

your area.  Can you accept that maybe it works better or at least <br/>
differently elsewhere?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528229690">Even though they may be licensed as a non-profit, they are run to make money<br/>
for the owners of the non-profits.  One2One not only had to decentralize,<br/>
they are being actively investigated for removing confidential student files<br/>
from charter offices, misappropriation of funds and several other offenses.<br/>
One2One or whatever they call themselves is not altruistic and they aren&#39;t<br/>
doing anything to benefit the kids.  They are in it for the money!  They<br/>
charge outrageous $$ and push Christian curriculum telling charters that<br/>
only certain catelogs/companies can provide the resources they want when<br/>
infact all the items are available without a Christian agenda.<br/>
<br/>
And while some of the charters they managed may be have benefited from their<br/>

&gt; No. HomeSmartKids of Knightsen is the only for-profit charter, as of the<br/>
&gt; end of last year. One2one is a national learning foundation run in large<br/>
&gt; part by the Milton Hershey foundation, and they have funded  a variety of<br/>
&gt; alternative programs in Texas, Pennsylvanie, and California. They didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; change their name, either - because of a new state law they had to<br/>
&gt; de-centralize, and they did so by helping many school distracts open<br/>
&gt; homeschooling charters, while they acted as consultants, procurred<br/>
&gt; initial funding, etc. The charters one2one works with are now very<br/>
&gt; different from each other, and they tend to more reflect the values of<br/>
&gt; their individual communities. Unfortunately, the one I ended up working<br/>
&gt; for was located in a really conservative area....<br/>

and signed up for this charter, mostly with the hopes of meeting other<br/>
homeschoolers in the area.<br/>

Possibly because the charter has audit worries, they&#39;ve been asked to turn<br/>
in work samples every week.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-952812113">Yes, I can back it up.  I have the list of vendors for several of the<br/>
charter groups and for One2One.  I also have material that they send out<br/>
when they are asked to recommend material.  It is Christian, no 2 ways<br/>
around it, particularly when it clearly states on the cover of the material<br/>
&quot;from a Christian perspective.&quot;  It is one of the issues in one of the<br/>
lawsuits.<br/>
<br/>
And I worked with one of the charters to help get their cumes back when<br/>
One2One sent a truck in over the weekend when they knew no one would be at<br/>
the portable that was used as the charter&#39;s office to remove all the files<br/>
and computers that the charter had paid for!<br/>
<br/>
As to Horizon dropping Rainbow, well, it had nothing to do with Christian,<br/>
it had to do with items not shipped and fights over how much was or wasn&#39;t<br/>
paid.<br/>

And I&#39;m beginning to grasp that the picture is a bit different when you are.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised when you said that the school program actually gives<br/>
independent-minded people your phone number.  Are the financial incentives for<br/>
keeping these people in school different in BC than in most US states?  Or are<br/>
Canadians less influenced by the power of money?<br/>

&gt; &gt;from charter offices, misappropriation of funds and several other<br/>

&gt; &gt;One2One or whatever they call themselves is not altruistic and they<br/>
aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;doing anything to benefit the kids.  They are in it for the money!  They<br/>
&gt; &gt;charge outrageous $$ and push Christian curriculum telling charters that<br/>
&gt; &gt;only certain catelogs/companies can provide the resources they want when<br/>
&gt; &gt;infact all the items are available without a Christian agenda.<br/>

Christian/inclusive lines like many of them?  Sounds like you&#39;re going to <br/>
have to get pro-active on the state level.  I think your current law is <br/>
similar to what we had in BC until about 1989.  It didn&#39;t mention <br/>
homeschooling as such, but said that parents were exempt from sending their <br/>
kids to school if they were providing an education that a judge would <br/>
consider sufficient, or some such wording.  Basically it meant that it was <br/>
up to the school district to prove that it wasn&#39;t good enough.  When it <br/>
looked like the government wanted to do something different with the law, <br/>
our provincial organization got moving and did a lot of lobbying, etc. and <br/>
got the great law that we have now.  If something like that is going to <br/>
happen, you want to get going on it and start convincing legislators <br/>
*before* HSLDA gets involved.  Get as many people that are using public <br/>
programs involved as you can.  Hook them in on the idea that they might <br/>
eventually want to be independent homeschoolers and would want the law to <br/>
make that possible.  From some of the responses on this list, it sounds <br/>
like you could get a lot of them onside.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314639522">One2One &quot;fronted&quot; the materials such as computers until the money came in<br/>
from the state.  Each student&#39;s account was &quot;charged&quot; for those computers.<br/>
The computers were not &quot;provided&quot; by One2One.  Wasn&#39;t their money.  They got<br/>
all of the &quot;front&quot; money back plus fees.<br/>
<br/>
I have photocopies of covers and descriptions from inside various text that<br/>
One2One ships which are Christian material.  They were sending out a little<br/>
ditty with recommendations to various charters and the test they were<br/>
recommending was Christian.<br/>
<br/>
One item they recommened AND shipped is from Christian Liberty Press (which<br/>
is not listed in the catelog&#39; description) and reads &quot;well-documented<br/>
information about the influence of Christianity upon the Constitution&quot; which<br/>
is also not part of the description in the catelog.<br/>
<br/>
When they set kids up with computers it comes with curriculum which is<br/>
Tomorrow&#39;s Promise which is a Christian curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
I have done the collecting for a group of parents that are filing in court<br/>
against One2One.  One woman still doesn&#39;t have her son&#39;s cume back and it<br/>
has been two years.  He wanted to do his senior year in the same high school<br/>
his father granduated from.  he can&#39;t do that because he lacks the units.<br/>
And that is just one of many horror stories that have come out of both<br/>
One2One and Horizon run charters.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably some of both.  The way it works here (I think) is that the <br/>
government decides each year how much each district will get per kid.  They <br/>
get extra for certain other things like kids with learning disabilities or <br/>
a certain percentage of native or esl kids.  They don&#39;t get the money if <br/>
they don&#39;t have the kids, but then they don&#39;t have to provide any services <br/>
for kids that aren&#39;t enrolled.  So the local boards really have nothing to <br/>
gain by enticing kids into or back into the system, though they do seem to <br/>
bargain a bit with parents who have labelled kids.  I&#39;d think that the <br/>
provincial government actually gains by having lots of homeschooled <br/>
kids.  If all the kids who are hs went back to school, they&#39;d have a hell <br/>
of a time providing for them.  Even the kids on the distance programs like <br/>
we&#39;re on save the government money because there are no capital building <br/>
costs.  The program we&#39;re with gets just a little more than half what <br/>
they&#39;d get for a full time student in the classroom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062133216">I don&#39;t know about BC, but in Manitoba, a school is funded based on registration, not attendance.  I didn&#39;t realize until this week that this wasn&#39;t the case in the States (on another board, a parent is being harrassed because her children are frequently late due to health problems.)  Canada has quite a few distance and homebound type school programs, because some school districts have more square miles in their district area than they do students, so I think that the gov&#39;t has had to deal with these kinds of arrangements more than in the States.  &quot;Virtual schools&quot; have existed here for decades, before the internet, lessons used to be broadcast to isolated students over the radio.  Funding schools based on in-school attendance would mean that many northern districts and schools would get very little money.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-881258643">Manitoba has a few programs, mostly high school.  There used to be a ps registration program out of a rural school division.  They would give $200/year for supplies and had no requirements whatsoever for reporting.  That school division is currently under investigation for mis-use of funds in their adult ed programs, though, and all their distance programs have been shut down.  The province loosened up the homeschooling regs this year, though, and made the process of notification easier and more painless.  The main draw of the Lowe Farm school was that it was very easy to comply with the ed. laws, all you had to do was fill out the ps registration form (basically just name, age, address) and that was all that was expected from you for the year, while at the time the regs required an outline and pretty thorough description of your program.  <br/>
<br/>
Now the process is pretty easy, just a standard notification form, and two reports.  The one in January just requires checkmarks next to the subjects if &quot;student has progressed&quot; LOL.  I&#39;ve already filled this one out.  The June one has to be a bit more in depth, but still basically one sentence per subject, no grades, no outside assessment.  All I have to write is how I&#39;ve seen progress in the subject (ie: Owen reads comfortably on his own now.)  <br/>
<br/>
The only current programs (that I know of, but I&#39;m not looking into PS help too much right now, LOL, we just got out of that) are two highschool programs.  They both sound pretty flexible, and are not aimed only at homeschoolers, but also teen parents, kids who live on their own and work, and kids with chronic health problems.  I don&#39;t know too much about how good these programs are, they&#39;re still pretty new.  They sound quite flexible, there is a small classroom and a teacher set aside for the program, kids can decide how many courses they want to take, if they want to go to class, do class work in the hs room, or follow the provincial correspondence course.  They can participate in sports, music classes, orchestra, etc.  I don&#39;t know how independant the family really is, though.<br/>

  &gt;That is the point, again.  School districts are NOT making money.  These<br/>
  &gt;charters are being run FOR PROFIT by folks such as Horizon and One2One, to<br/>
  &gt;name just a couple.  One2One has changed their name but it is still business<br/>
  &gt;as usual.<br/>
<br/>
  I think you are taking the situation that you&#39;re familiar with and <br/>
  extrapolating it to cover all situations where there are charters or ps <br/>
  homeschooling programs.  The problem with that is that they aren&#39;t all like <br/>
  that.  I&#39;ve explained how it works in BC.  You&#39;re obviously familiar with <br/>
  how it works in Calif., at least in your area.  What about other <br/>
  folks?  How is it actually working in other parts of the States?  At this <br/>
  time, I think BC is the only province with these kinds of programs.  In <br/>
  Alberta, all homeschoolers have to jump through more hoops than the <br/>
  Electronic bus families in BC.  They get money, but have no choice to opt <br/>
  out.  I&#39;m sure this is what a lot of people are concerned about, but it <br/>
  didn&#39;t happen in Alberta because of charter schools or ps homeschooling <br/>
  programs.  It happened because some homeschoolers pushed for financial <br/>
  support, and the government decided to give it to everyone, no opting <br/>
  out.  This is what we&#39;re working to prevent in BC.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;The money doesn&#39;t benefit kids, it doesn&#39;t even put too many people to work<br/>
  &gt;and those it does are paid minimum wages with the &quot;owner&quot; of these companies<br/>
  &gt;hauling in the $$.<br/>
<br/>
  I can certainly see why you&#39;re against these programs, the way they work in <br/>
  your area.  Can you accept that maybe it works better or at least <br/>
  differently elsewhere?<br/>
