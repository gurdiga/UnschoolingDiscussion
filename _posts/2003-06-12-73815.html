<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545622934">Hi Purple cowboy boot lovers, <br/>
I&#39;m way behind but had to say- I have purple cowboy boots. I don&#39;t want to part with them though. Got them at Salvation Army on 1/2 price day and still paid $9 for them. They&#39;re worn and I really do need them for riding, but the color&#39;s kind of a joke around here. They work great though. <br/>
