world already, like all of our kids, and they seem to manage the hard<br/>

you won&#39;t be insulted helps you handle these things when they do happen. <br/>

OTOH, your philosophy on this sounds like the &quot;toughen &#39;em up&quot; school of<br/>
thought, where a parent  hurts their own child (emotionally or<br/>
physically)  as sort of a presumptive strike, so that when someone else<br/>
does it they&#39;ll be used to it, and then they can act  &quot;tough&quot;.  I just<br/>
don&#39;t think that works.<br/>

It&#39;s interesting how you see intentionally using words with postive<br/>
connotation as &quot;sugar coating&quot;, but you don&#39;t  see intentionally using<br/>
words with negative connotations as the opposite.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192364510">Hi Bridget,<br/>
<br/>
I would like to add that I don&#39;t think that calling a CHILD &quot;lazy&quot;, etc. <br/>
will build self-worth.  I believe it will have the opposite effect.  It <br/>
is the knowledge the child has that his parents accept him for just what <br/>
he is and what he does.  It is total acceptance and unconditional love <br/>
from the parent that will build a sense of security and self-worth - not <br/>
criticism.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not really.  Persistence is perceived in our society as a <br/>
virtue.  Stubbornness is not.  I certainly found my son to be a lot easier <br/>
to understand and get along with when I changed *my* perception of his <br/>
toddler behavior from stubborn to persistent.  And I began to see that he <br/>
wasn&#39;t really being stubborn, in the sense of unreasonable.  He had <br/>
perfectly good (to himself anyway) reasons for acting the way he did in <br/>
order to get *his* needs met.  Once I saw that, it was much easier to find <br/>
ways to help him meet his needs than when I just thought he was being <br/>
stubborn. And I&#39;m sure he appreciated it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the two are a bit different.  I&#39;d say that persistence is my older <br/>
son, who really wanted a particular job.  He went down there every week for <br/>
months, until the boss finally told him not to bother, that he would be the <br/>
next person hired when they needed someone.  (And he was)  Stubborn is my <br/>
grandfather, who was selling life insurance in a logging camp.  Eating <br/>
breakfast in the mess hall, he reached for a pitcher of what he thought was <br/>
syrup.  He ignored the grins and snickers from the loggers and poured it <br/>
all over his pancakes, ate the pancakes, asked for seconds, and poured the <br/>
*olive oil* all over his second batch of pancakes and ate them, rather than <br/>
admitting he had goofed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I find that most people are *less* likely to change when their faults are <br/>
pointed out.  Try bugging a loved one to quit smoking and see how much good <br/>
it does.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-413719209">I&#39;ve been away for a few days, but just caught this<br/>
thread. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m SO glad to be on a list that allows this<br/>
conversation.  Would you believe, on another list I<br/>
WAS on, I got kicked off for suggesting that a parent<br/>
shouldn&#39;t label their kids as lazy as that&#39;s what<br/>
they&#39;ll become.  (This particular poster had a habit<br/>
of listing ALL the labels her kids had at the end of<br/>
their names for instance: Tom ADHD, DIS, glasses,<br/>
lazy, etc!)<br/>
<br/>
And my post wasn&#39;t rude or derogratory.  Just stated<br/>
what I believed to be my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness for a list that allows us to be human!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I don&#39;t think you should LABEL your kids anything and making <br/>
their medical conditions a part of their names is just strange <br/>
(IMHO).  But I see a difference between saying, &quot;Me son becomes lazy <br/>
and willful in these circumstances.&quot; And saying, &quot;My son IS lazy and <br/>
willful.&quot;  Somewhat similar to my belief that we should say, &quot;My <br/>
daughter HAS ADHD.&quot;  and definetly NOT, &quot;My daughter is ADHD.&quot; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh puke!  Anybody ever hear of a self-fulfilling prophecy?<br/>
<br/>
Outside the homeschooling world (mainly) I get so tired of hearing people <br/>
referring to their children as brats or monsters.  My daughter has a <br/>
neighbour with a baby about the same age as my grandson (just over one) who <br/>
has been calling her baby a brat and a bad girl ever since she started to <br/>
crawl and explore.  She&#39;ll know she&#39;s a brat and a bad girl even before she <br/>
knows how to talk.  Sad.<br/>
