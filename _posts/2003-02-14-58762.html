 </span></blockquote>Can you talk more about the resource day.  Sounds real interesting.  <br/>
<br/>
Also about those Mage Knights. LOL.  My son won some at the raffle last year <br/>
(conference in SC) and had such a fascination with them although the game was <br/>
hard and we never quite learned it.  He saw something similar at a gaming <br/>
store, Warhammer 40,000.  He was so excited about it we bought the starter <br/>
set.  That led to lots of reading as the game has a HUGE book or rules and <br/>
scenarios.  He and I have spent hours putting together those tiny players and <br/>
painting them.  We have both learned the game and spent time creating the <br/>
game board etc.  He has even found the web site and explored what pieces he <br/>
can buy with the money he has and we talked about maybe us helping buy some <br/>
pieces.  Talked about terrain features and made some obstacles ourselves with <br/>
paper mache etc.  So much from such a little game and best of all I spend <br/>
time with my son doing something he is passionate about, even if it isn&#39;t top <br/>
on my list it is on his.  And that is priceless.  (man that sounded like a <br/>
commercial...LOL)<br/>
