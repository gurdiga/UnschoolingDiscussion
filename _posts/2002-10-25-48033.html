&lt;&lt; Why is it the rats I have seen and held tend to be mean and bite when <br/>
held?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Proabably because you are seeing feeder Rats, not hand fed breeder rats.<br/>
They need to be handled and held from birth on to &quot;socialize&quot; them.<br/>
Feeder rats get ignored, they&#39;re just going to end up in the belly of a snake <br/>
anyway right?<br/>
