<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335233157">This is a response to something many days old which at the time was too big <br/>
to answer and still might be. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Aaron is 5, he <br/>
<br/>
loves his Whirly Wheels, games, snuggling with Mom, Futurama and <br/>
<br/>
SpongeBob. All three love Nintendo and the computer (and I could tell <br/>
<br/>
100 stories of things they&#39;ve learned from them!).-=-<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s a Futurama fan.  Have you looked at my video games page?  It was made <br/>
following a presentation at a conference a couple of years ago on the <br/>
benefits of video games:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/games/page">http://sandradodd.com/games/page</a><br/>
<br/>
If you want to end me some video game stories for that it would be great!<br/>
<br/>
-=-Now my question. I don&#39;t have the playdate problem, but I do run into <br/>
<br/>
issues with other children. I am the children&#39;s officer for our local <br/>
<br/>
SCA branch -=-<br/>
<br/>
All I could think of when I read that paragraph was what I&#39;ve been thinking <br/>
for years about it.  The SCA shouldn&#39;t have children&#39;s officers.   As I could <br/>
rant for hours, I won&#39;t even begin.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Most (probably all) of the children are in public school <br/>
<br/>
or daycare. I run my activities much like unschooling-=-<br/>
<br/>
The problem with lack of structure when others expect structure is they don&#39;t <br/>
get it and  they don&#39;t know how to act.<br/>
<br/>
In the 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s, educators KNEW, from research and proof in <br/>
practice, that the open classroom worked and elminated many of the problems they <br/>
knew school had not been able to avoid to that point.  Lots of people knew.   <br/>
<br/>
In implementation in public school, it didn&#39;t work.  After all that proving, <br/>
they couldn&#39;t reproduce it in public schools.    The main factors seemed to <br/>
have been<br/>
1) the teachers didn&#39;t get it<br/>
2) the students didn&#39;t get it<br/>
3) the parents didn&#39;t get it<br/>
<br/>
but worse than all that, it seems, it only work when the kids want to be <br/>
there.<br/>
If the kids are there against their will, they&#39;ll balk at anything.  And once <br/>
kids have been taught (by school, indirectly) to avoid what they&#39;re not <br/>
forced to do, and to get away with as much wildness as possible before someone <br/>
makes them Sit Down and Be Quiet, it&#39;s hard to get good results without the long <br/>
period of deschooling it would take for them to trust and appreciate the <br/>
freedom and to really want to be there.<br/>
<br/>
-=-One problem I have is that some children take advantage of this and <br/>
<br/>
hoard - materials, prizes, whatever. We&#39;ll have a game where all <br/>
<br/>
participants get a token and they&#39;ll pretend they lost it to get <br/>
<br/>
another. On one hand, I don&#39;t mind this (if they really need a second <br/>
<br/>
plastic ring, it&#39;s just not that huge of a deal), -=-<br/>
<br/>
Plastic rings aren&#39;t period, and that&#39;s one of my (several) objections to <br/>
children&#39;s activities.  They don&#39;t really enable children to be involved so much <br/>
as they create a holding space where the kids do non-period, vaguely-SCA <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
But other than that, when you&#39;re dealing with mainstream kids, you are.  The <br/>
problems of trying to do school (no matter how informal) or daycare (if the <br/>
kids are younger) are not different in costumes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The younger kids (6 and under) are SO fun, they are so creative <br/>
<br/>
and have no set idea of how things must be. The older kids, tho ... <br/>
<br/>
will compare supplies, he got a better color, her yarn is longer, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Wait until told exactly what to do (you may start now ... ). Have to be <br/>
<br/>
shown how to draw a face. Will only draw it EXACTLY the way I show them <br/>
<br/>
(or like the sample).-=-<br/>
<br/>
You already know what the deal is.<br/>
I can&#39;t think of anything that will make it better.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, if you could have two or three stations with people doing things so <br/>
the kids could wander and pick and choose, that might work better.<br/>
<br/>
But you won&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t have two or three teens or adults who want to <br/>
dedicate their days to children&#39;s activities.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Someone had a pi√±ata once - not my idea - and the older <br/>
<br/>
kids bashed it before the small kids had a chance -=-<br/>
<br/>
Pinatas have to be carefully managed, little kids first, clear the space, <br/>
etc., or that&#39;s likely to happen anytime, anywhere.  It&#39;s not about the SCA.  <br/>
It&#39;s about pinatas and sticks.   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Any ideas on either how to get these kids to loosen up a <br/>
<br/>
bit, or for me to stop worrying about it? :) -=-<br/>
<br/>
Philosophical innoculation on your part, maybe.  You&#39;ve already said if you q<br/>
uit the next person might be more schoolish.  Probably WILL be.  But meanwhile <br/>
you&#39;re not participating in the SCA yourself in the natal-learning way it was <br/>
Zdesigned to work, and neither are your children.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I mostly <br/>
<br/>
enjoy it, and my replacement could be more school-y and then my own <br/>
<br/>
kids wouldn&#39;t want to participate. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Probably the best thing for your children would be to not want to participate <br/>
in organized  children&#39;s activities.    What if you just organize running <br/>
games, chase, jumprope, things that are easily participated in or not, and easily <br/>
abandoned when the interest lags, and just do it on your own time, for your <br/>
children&#39;s sake?<br/>
<br/>
The SCA is educational because people research their own personas and create <br/>
their costumes and armor.  Or at least they used to.  Now it can be bought off <br/>
the rack.  The SCA is a learning experience when a person wants to know more. <br/>
  The SCA becomes a school when the groups cares more about organized classes <br/>
and keeping kids isolated from the activities at large than about having <br/>
events so rich and fascinating that no energetic or curious person could possibly <br/>
get bored.<br/>
<br/>
Strong opinions based on 25 years participation and having three kids grow up <br/>
in it.  They learn more from asking questions and helping and doing real <br/>
things.  They are accepted as participants by participating, not by attending <br/>
children&#39;s activities.<br/>
<br/>
We as a kingdom (Outlands) have resisted children&#39;s activities for years, but <br/>
just lately a corporate ruling says we have to have children&#39;s officers.   I <br/>
think its another move in the wrong direction.    My work at corporate level <br/>
(I&#39;m ten years out from my last corporate office, but have held corporate <br/>
positions up from seneschals twice and up from chroniclers twice) was always aimed <br/>
to LESS administration, LESS bureaucracy, simple-and-pure feast and tournament <br/>
focus.    Ultimately, I lose.  But I held them off for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I couldn&#39;t respond sooner.  Too big, too close.  Too sad for me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have, great article (I&#39;ve read most of your pages numerous times). <br/>
I&#39;ll try to get some stories written down for you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; -=- I am the children&#39;s officer for our local SCA branch -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; I could<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;lots of other really good stuff deleted&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know, and I agree, the kids should be an active, vital part of <br/>
whatever else is going on around them. This is an excellent chance for <br/>
them to get involved and have a great time and learn things that are <br/>
relevant to them, by experiencing and talking and asking and being. BUT <br/>
the reality is, MoC&#39;s exist, because, as you probably know, some people <br/>
don&#39;t want kids hanging around (and because now we have to have them), <br/>
and because mainstream parents are used to sending their children away <br/>
for large portions of a day. At my first event doing things for the <br/>
kids, I had numerous people (NON-PARENTS) come up to me and thank me <br/>
for entertaining the children - so they were left alone and didn&#39;t have <br/>
kids bothering them all day (very sad - I was left speechless, tho I am <br/>
not sure why it surprised me). I would LOVE to see the children just <br/>
being part of things, but it doesn&#39;t happen (and not just because of <br/>
children&#39;s officers - one of my big things has been trying to get the <br/>
children accepted more, in court, in Arts and Sciences competitions, <br/>
etc.  - it&#39;s working a little on a local level). I think this is what <br/>
bothers me, the conflict between the reality and the ideal.<br/>
<br/>
I should say as far as activities, I DO a lot of multiple station-type <br/>
activities, and they are just THERE (with or without a &quot;teacher&quot;, <br/>
depends on the activity). Children are not forced or even asked (by ME <br/>
anyway, I have no control over their parents) to participate in any <br/>
fashion (I prefer to use the child underground information network to <br/>
get the word out, I don&#39;t go around ringing a bell and telling people <br/>
now it&#39;s time for the kids to come play - some MoC&#39;s do - ugh). If they <br/>
show up, ok. If they need help creating, fine, we&#39;re there to help. <br/>
They want to use the markers to color all over their body, no problem <br/>
(for me anyway, I think it&#39;s cute, they look like Picts ;). We have a <br/>
lot of running games, running around and doing nothing, props for the <br/>
kids to make up their own games, etc. I did it for my own kids, and <br/>
others joined in, and our area did not have an MoC, so I started doing <br/>
it officially. Honestly, I don&#39;t do things on that level any <br/>
differently, except that I have MORE stuff and a dedicated area for it. <br/>
I frequently have adults come over and participate because we&#39;re having <br/>
fun. We also generally have events at parks, and if I didn&#39;t run <br/>
activities, 90%+  of the kids would be over on the slide and swings <br/>
anyway (which is GREAT if that&#39;s what they want, but frequently it&#39;s <br/>
the only option they are given - point being they wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
participating in the event activities anyway).<br/>
<br/>
With my own kids, my oldest (16) WANTS to participate with the <br/>
children. She&#39;s not really interested in the historical aspects, or <br/>
costumes or whatever, she likes to play with kids. She&#39;s happy, I&#39;m <br/>
happy. My boys are free to participate or not at events. They don&#39;t <br/>
like events where I&#39;m not doing the children&#39;s activities (the <br/>
activities are too structured, boring and school-y), and they don&#39;t <br/>
feel welcome with the adults.<br/>
<br/>
My point was (after all this length), I agree with what you said, and <br/>
it IS frustrating, and I am trying to do what I can in the system to <br/>
make things a tiny bit better. It&#39;s not enough, but it&#39;s not making <br/>
things worse. SOMEONE has to do the job. Might as well be me, and not <br/>
an actual credentialed teacher who wants to take away ALL of the joy.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I hate plastic rings too, but unfortunately my budget doesn&#39;t <br/>
allow for more period toys for prizes (for ALL the time). I try to give <br/>
things like wooden tops when possible. I am always working on making <br/>
activities more period and less peri-oid, within some modern safety <br/>
sensibilities (and unfortunately, budget concerns). I also have a lot <br/>
of activities that don&#39;t require the giving of a prize.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your insights. I knew you&#39;d have a strong opinion on this. ;)<br/>

Yeah, but the reality is you don&#39;t have to aid and abet those people!<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think this is what <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s worse in different places at different times.    Any one year, some SCA <br/>

decaying, and then things switch all around.  <br/>

With that paragraph in isolation, without you saying what you really love to <br/>
do in the SCA, what your own involvement is, why your kids are there, it <br/>
sounds as though your whole family spends the day at the children&#39;s area.<br/>
<br/>
YUCK!<br/>
<br/>
It could the greatest SCA children&#39;s area in the history of SCA children&#39;s <br/>
areas (bwg), and still...   it&#39;s not unschooling, is it?  And it&#39;s not SCA <br/>
participation at its ideal or even passable level either.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My point was (after all this length), I agree with what you said, and <br/>

<br/>
Is a tiny bit better sufficient to change things?<br/>
<br/>
Is a WHOLE lot better sufficient?<br/>
<br/>
If so, you&#39;re doing what you want to do. <br/>
Ifour children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Btw, I hate plastic rings too, but unfortunately my budget doesn&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
Thrift stores.  Metal bangle-bracelets.   Wooden beads.  Blocks.   If every <br/>
prize is a block, they end up with lots of blocks. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to work with schooled kids in any way, I&#39;ve found.  And after all <br/>
these years unschooling, it&#39;s even harder for me to see them being callous and <br/>
crazed and to disregard so much and so many because it&#39;s not school, they <br/>
don&#39;t have to, there&#39;s not a grade, whatever all excuses they use to live badly.<br/>
<br/>
When people tell children that school is their job, that school is their <br/>
life, what does that make the REST of their life?   Recess.   Break.   School-prep <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Of all the learning-for-learning&#39;s-sake opportunities in the world the SCA <br/>
used to be one of the best, and still can be for people who are there to learn.<br/>

&gt; participation at its ideal or even passable level either.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We DO end up doing this (staying in the children&#39;s area all day) . But <br/>
you know what? There are events where there is literally NOTHING else <br/>
to do except watch combat. Or where there is only one &quot;game&quot; or contest <br/>
offered for all comers. That gets dull too, especially if it&#39;s not a <br/>
contest in something I am interested in (and none of us fight). At a <br/>
typical event, there are a few medieval-oid games (toss a gnome, pin <br/>
the leaf on the Green Man) and only rarely something actually REAL, <br/>
such as a chance to learn anything (do anything, have fun with <br/>
anything), that&#39;s done all at non-events (like guild meetings). If I <br/>
didn&#39;t bring things for the children, I&#39;d be bringing things for my own <br/>
anyway, and watching them play all day. Plus my area of interest IS <br/>
children, period toys, etc. My daughter (as I mentioned) just likes <br/>
kids, she could care less that it&#39;s SCA. Same with my youngest, he just <br/>
likes to play. My older son adores boffers. My husband just became <br/>
authorized to be a boffer marshal. That&#39;s what we do. Yes, we&#39;re <br/>
re-thinking our entire participation at this point, but that&#39;s hard too <br/>
(lots of $$ and time invested, there are a few people who &quot;get it&quot; and <br/>
they&#39;d be personally hurt if we left - tho they&#39;d understand, we like <br/>
the idea of how and what it COULD be, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
No, it&#39;s not good overall. It&#39;s not unschooling. It has some good <br/>
aspects, which is why we go. I&#39;m just not really sure what to do about <br/>
it overall (that&#39;s partly why I posted ;).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is a tiny bit better sufficient to change things?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know. :) I&#39;d like to think it changes things a little for the <br/>
child who is participating. Maybe it&#39;s not enough to matter. The <br/>
schooling mentality can hard to break out of.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-Btw, I hate plastic rings too, but unfortunately my budget doesn&#39;t <br/>

&gt; every prize is a block, they end up with lots of blocks. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do a lot of these types of things too, when I can and when I have the <br/>
stuff to do it with (someone gave me the rings, but you know what? I&#39;m <br/>
gonna go get them out of my stuff, and donate them to some other group <br/>
where they are more appropriate). I&#39;m moving away from plastic and <br/>
per-oid in all possible areas. Sometimes I have to use cheaper (modern) <br/>
substitutes for crafts or whatever in order to accommodate a lot of <br/>
children, and tho I don&#39;t like it, it&#39;s one of the trade-offs I can <br/>
live with, if it means more children can participate (or makes it <br/>
substantially safer).<br/>
<br/>
Plus, when quite a few kids show up in overalls with GameBoys, and in <br/>
modern strollers, and with huge toy plastic castles, and those pop-up <br/>
tents that look like castles, and etc., plastic rings fly under the <br/>
radar for most people. I am not saying they are good and right in this <br/>
context. What I AM saying is, even tho I&#39;ll get rid of mine, they will <br/>
still show up as prizes.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on those little glass counters or polished stones? ;)<br/>

might be, but I haven&#39;t seen many who are willing to teach children, or <br/>

the point of being offensive.<br/>
<br/>
So Sandra (or anyone else), what do YOU think, is it worthwhile trying? <br/>
Does it matter? Would you keep doing it? If not, what would you do <br/>
instead, if anything? Etc., etc., etc. It does help clarify things when <br/>
there is a lot of input. I know you said some of this already but it&#39;s <br/>
a lot to process, having it stated in multiple ways is helpful. :)</div>
