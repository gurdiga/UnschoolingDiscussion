<div id="ygrps-yiv-843906466">&quot;Unschooling is a radical branch of home-schooling where kids control  <br/>
what and when they learn -- free of teachers, schedules and tests.  <br/>
Unschoolers say it&#39;s intellectually empowering. Critics call it  <br/>
irresponsible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the intro statement from the article &quot;Endless summer&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/feature/2005/10/03/unschool/index.html">http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/feature/2005/10/03/unschool/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The article&#39;s not new, it&#39;s from October 2005, but a couple of things  <br/>
stirred it this week and I keep thinking about that intro line.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been interviewed lots of times, and no matter how clearly the  <br/>
interviewer or researcher thinks she understands it or no matter how  <br/>
convincingly they summarize their understanding for me, it seems  <br/>
there&#39;s always a grating flaw that makes unschooling look CRAZY once  <br/>
they write it down, or makes it seem mean or misguided or neglectful  <br/>
or that the parents aren&#39;t doing anything.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, since even people who actually try to  <br/>
put it into practice in real homes with real kids can have a heck of  <br/>
a time balancing out what they&#39;re trying to do and what&#39;s going to  <br/>
make it worse or better.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But control...  I think the idea of control is a hard one to get.   <br/>
Who&#39;s in control?  If an interviewee or the subject of a study says  <br/>
&quot;no one is in control&quot; that&#39;s a heck of a sound bite, and conjures  <br/>
visions of crazed debauchery.   And if it&#39;s only rephrased to the  <br/>
point that the interviewers or researchers get the idea that we&#39;re  <br/>
talking about &quot;self control&quot; it&#39;s still dealing in &quot;control.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But if we could ignore the parenting and potential wildness ideas, I  <br/>
want to talk about &quot;kids control what and when they learn.&quot;  In  <br/>
another post.<br/>

<br/>
Kids don&#39;t control what they learn.<br/>
Parents can&#39;t control what they learn.<br/>
Teachers can&#39;t control what they learn.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a line from Shakespeare&#39;s Henry V, when he&#39;s talking to  <br/>
himself the night before the battle , when he says &quot;Canst thou, when  <br/>
thou command&#39;st the beggar&#39;s knee,<br/>
Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,<br/>
That play&#39;st so subtly with a king&#39;s repose...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an old saying, &quot;You can lead a horse to water, but you can&#39;t  <br/>
make it drink,&quot; and a parody joke punch line which is too sexist to  <br/>
be politically correct these days, &quot;you can lead a whore to Vassar,  <br/>
but you can&#39;t make her think.&quot;  Well...<br/>
<br/>
If there are things one person can compel another person to do,  <br/>
learning isn&#39;t among them.<br/>
<br/>
No one can control what anyone else learns.<br/>
