<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702273971">Somehow, I inadvertantly deleted the post that gave me the information about quitting<br/>
my Charter<br/>
School and joining an isp.  (I am not sure exactly what ISP stands for!!  8-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, I believe the poster gave a link or phone number????  (In California)<br/>
<br/>
 I have been giving this a lot of thought and weighing the<br/>
pros and cons of stepping out of the Charter school now or waiting until the end of<br/>
the<br/>
year.  Staying with the Charter means monthly samples of his work, grade cards and<br/>
ILPs , which I have not minded, but producing all of those will be a little more<br/>
difficult<br/>
if we begin UNschooling!<br/>
<br/>
As I had mentioned previously, the Charter school pays for Kristopher&#39;s tutoring,<br/>
which he<br/>
loves.  Also, they paid for tennis lessons last fall, and there are supposed to be<br/>
more lessons<br/>
this spring.  Also, they will pay for PE classes as well as music and art classes.<br/>
These are<br/>
all things we cannot afford to pay for him to do.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I apologize, I don&#39;t remember your name......could you post again?  or write<br/>
to<br/>
me off list?  Thanks.<br/>
