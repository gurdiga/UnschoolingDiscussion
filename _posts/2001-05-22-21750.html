<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248998448">We&#39;re sort of in that process right now. My ds will sit at the computer and <br/>
ask me to spell words for him. He knows how to spell a fair number of 3 <br/>
letter words (the important ones like &quot;jet&quot;) and &quot;brian&quot; &quot;katherine&quot; &quot;mommy&quot; <br/>
and &quot;daddy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now he reads over my shoulder when I&#39;m writing an email and says &quot;baby? why <br/>
are you writing, &#39;baby?&#39;&quot; in addition to asking us to read everything he sees <br/>
to him.<br/>
<br/>
No program, no store-bought curriculum. But some hand made cards with words <br/>
on them, which he asks for from time to time, and most of which he knows by <br/>
now. And when we go outside with chalk now he wants me to write words instead <br/>
of draw pictures. We (I write at his instruction) write the names of all his <br/>
stuffed animals, and then they come out and cheer, because they *love* to see <br/>
their names &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt;  &gt;mechanics of how they learned to read. Did they pick it up on their own<br/>
&gt;  from <br/>
&gt;  &gt;having watched and listened to you, or did you use some sort of program<br/>
&gt;  &gt;when they indicated that they were ready? </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-570046003">With all the kids in turn when they were first trying to read, we&#39;d make <br/>
lists of similar things--all the people in our family, or all our pets, or <br/>
their favorite toys or stuffed animals.   Then they&#39;d figure which was which, <br/>
by length or beginning letter or whatever.  In educational jargon that&#39;s <br/>
&quot;decoding.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In real life, it&#39;s deductive reasoning.<br/>
<br/>
Neither sucks.<br/>
<br/>
OOH!  The Simpsons was about...  Well it had to do with American literature.  <br/>
Paul Bunyon, Johnny Appleseed and Tom Sawyer.  And one of the kids (not <br/>
Millhouse, it was the police-chief&#39;s kid, I think)  said to Tom (Bart) Sawyer <br/>
as they started whitewashing the fence, with a slow Midwest literary-dialog <br/>
accent:  &quot;Whitewashing sucks, Tom; it POWerful sucks.&quot;<br/>
