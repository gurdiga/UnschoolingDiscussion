<br/>
&gt;&gt;And yes, this sort of thing can carry you through to real life. :) My work<br/>
&gt;&gt;and play looks like the same thing, too. Following bliss can put food on the<br/>
&gt;&gt;table.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So what *is* your work and play, Pam?<br/>

<br/>

I have a question for you.  My sil just dumped her 7 month old dog on <br/>
us.  (Okay, we did agree.)  Anyway, she says he is part Lab and part <br/>
Husky and I suspect part Rottweiler from his coloring.  They got him <br/>
at 8 weeks or so and kept him in a cage most of the time.  Needless <br/>
to say, he is a behavioural nightmare.  He is very strong and very <br/>
exuberant.<br/>
<br/>
My question, will it be possible to get him calmed down and trained?  <br/>
My thought is that he is still pretty young and he is not mean just <br/>
boisterous, so he is probably not a lost cause.<br/>

Dogs need to be &quot;socialized&quot; and it drives me crazy when folks get a dog and<br/>
then they tie them up or crate them.<br/>
<br/>
First off, take him to your vet and get him checked out, wormed, current on<br/>
shots and neutered.  Then I&#39;d give him a week or two to just run and enjoy<br/>
the freedom of no longer being caged.  Then join one of the local groups<br/>
that do dog training.  Look for one that is a &quot;fun&quot; group, not one where<br/>
folks are looking to train dogs for obedience trials.  The fun groups<br/>
usually work at making a dog a good member of your family and aren&#39;t all<br/>
about &quot;sit, stay, heel.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198874965">Well, I have to say that after just 24 hour with us there is a lot of <br/>
improvement.  I can now let him off the leash in the house and still <br/>
have a house!  The first few times I brought him in, he went nutso.  <br/>
I think he expected to be shoved in a box so he went beserk.  Once he <br/>
