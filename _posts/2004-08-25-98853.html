change of season here, my son has been having<br/>
accidents.  I think it&#39;s due to the colder weather.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894989768">hahahah thanks yes I remeber the idea that temp has something to do <br/>
with bladder holding all night came up along the journey of bed <br/>
wetting so that does make sense.<br/>
<br/>
We will be ready for what comes but for now I am holding onto my joy <br/>
of dry nights for summer and the hope that it is finally past us.<br/>
