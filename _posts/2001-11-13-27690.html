<div id="ygrps-yiv-838958817">Another look:<br/>
I have a daughter with vesicoureteral reflux who needed to avoid cafeine,<br/>
carbonated beverages, chocolate, and all citrus...oranges,  tomatoes, etc.<br/>
In addition,  she had bowel difficulties since birth that make it imperative<br/>
that she eat a high fiber diet.   Should she simply follow her taste buds,<br/>
she could still get into trouble.....even a few days on a diet that doesn&#39;t<br/>
work for her could land her in the hospital with a kidney infection.<br/>
<br/>
Also,  alcoholics and substance abusers crave their addictive item......many<br/>
need the intervention of loved ones to turn themselves around.  High sugar<br/>
consumption causes fluctuations in blood sugar that cause people to crave<br/>
sugar.  The body can fool you.  Some people seem to have a better sense of<br/>
their body and its needs than others...i.e.,  one of my children has always<br/>
taken a nap when she&#39;s tired of her own volition,  the others fight their<br/>
tiredness through tantrums and grumbling...resisting their body&#39;s needs;<br/>
they require something from the adults in their lives to enable/encourage<br/>
them in discerning their bodies needs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look at it this way:<br/>
You believe your child knows what she needs to eat everyday and you let<br/>
her choose what and how much.  She is fine and healthy but chooses to eat<br/>
things you detest - say Peanut butter and Garlic sandwiches.  All is well<br/>
though and you can trust her to make her own choices because they are not<br/>
harming her and you have disassociated the taste from the health issue.<br/>
Now, suppose you daughter decides to eat nothing but celery.  All celery<br/>
ever day.  Absolutely nothing else.  She has lost loads of weight and is<br/>
unhealthy.  Can you still let her make her own choices regarding food?<br/>
When exactly is the right time to step in and do something?<br/>
The same holds true for every parenting issue.  We need to learn and<br/>
observe and figure out when the right time to step in is.  But no one can<br/>
say that there is NEVER a time to step in with any child.  I do think<br/>
many people step in on too many issues because they can&#39;t disassociate<br/>
their own wants and needs from the childs wants and needs.  But that does<br/>
not mean that it is NEVER right to step in.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; obviously understand that this is what is better for your<br/>
&gt; daughter.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just like another person would understanding that limiting or not<br/>
&gt; &gt; would best suit the child&#39;s needs. It&#39;s all a matter of<br/>
&gt; &gt; individualism.  Bonnie<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But you&#39;re setting up a Catch-22 here. If I say I know best and so I<br/>
&gt; make<br/>
&gt; her do things or not do things, then you&#39;re right. If I say I think<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; knows best, then you say I must know best so if I think that then I<br/>
&gt; must<br/>
&gt; be right, and you&#39;re right again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My head spins, but maybe it&#39;s easier to take oit away from the<br/>
&gt; personal,<br/>
&gt; and say I think the child knows best... </span></blockquote></div>
