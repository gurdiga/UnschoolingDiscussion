<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525712955">Dear Katy,<br/>
<br/>
An unschooling friend asked me to reply to your post.<br/>
<br/>
I went through what you are now experiencing 4 years<br/>
ago.  <br/>
<br/>
I was leaving to take my oldest to a friend&#39;s house<br/>
when 2 young women drove up and confronted me in the<br/>
front yard.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t go into the details, except to say that it was<br/>
a family member, on my side, that made the report. <br/>
<br/>
CPS gets a lot of these types of erroneous reports, so<br/>
if that&#39;s what happened in your case, it  wouldn&#39;t<br/>
surprise me.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very Sad, but some people would rather betray you<br/>
and endanger your children and family than accept the<br/>
fact that you have chosen a path different from<br/>
theirs.<br/>
<br/>
Back to The Subject.  If you consult with persons who<br/>
have been through this before, or lawyers that<br/>
represent homeschool families, they will tell you in<br/>
no uncertain terms:  DO NOT EVER invite CPS into your<br/>
home.   Never ever.<br/>
<br/>
NEVER.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, you are upset, confused, dismayed, feeling<br/>
betrayed, frightened, vulnerable and threatened.<br/>
<br/>
I know.  I have been there. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my Insistent Advice to further disturb<br/>
you.  It&#39;s not my intention to add insult to injury<br/>
<br/>
It IS my intention to give you the Best, hard earned,<br/>
solid and sound advice available.  I know it is<br/>
because I spent an entire week researching, e-mailing<br/>
and calling,(all over the country), those in the know.<br/>
 What I got was a Unanimous call for Not Allowing CPS<br/>
in my door.<br/>
<br/>
I did not, at the time.  I had heard it mentioned<br/>
casually online, so I used that advice.  The worker<br/>
threatened to come back with the police and enter my<br/>
home against my will, if that&#39;s what it took to<br/>
interview each of my children -Alone- in our home.<br/>
<br/>
Before my research, I called her office and arranged<br/>
for her to come to my house a few days later.  After<br/>
my research, I canceled that arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
Where you live is important.  Where are you?  That is<br/>
a consideration.<br/>
<br/>
However, in most states, CPS is not the regulatory<br/>
agency for homeschoolers.   If you are legal, then you<br/>
need to assemble all the documents that prove your<br/>
legality.  Get copies of everything the law requires.<br/>
<br/>
(In my state, SC, all that must be shown to prove<br/>
legality is an Association membership.  They got a<br/>
copy of my certificate.  Nothing else.)<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, &quot;messy house&quot; is NOT Criminal.  It was on my<br/>
report too : &quot;physical neglect&quot; was the check box<br/>
marked.   It was only after the case was  resolved<br/>
that the worker admitted that wasn&#39;t applicable to<br/>
&quot;dishes in the sink&quot; and &quot;undone laundry&quot;, which was<br/>
all the complainant asserted.  An &quot;office worker<br/>
erred&quot; in checking that item.  <br/>
<br/>
None the less,  I took all 4 of my children to my<br/>
nurse practitioner and had her give them complete<br/>
physicals to refute their being &quot;neglected&quot;.  Your<br/>
doing the same wouldn&#39;t be  a bad idea as a<br/>
comprehensive refutation of the &quot;bad mother&quot; image.<br/>
<br/>
CPS has no ability to evaluate educational programs. <br/>
That is not their job. Furthermore, they do not want<br/>
it.  They have too many cases of Real Abuse that keep<br/>
them busy every day.  So, it is Your Job to help them<br/>
complete their mandatory &quot;investigation&quot;  and be on<br/>
their merry way to save the children who are in really<br/>
scary life-threatening situations.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have your documents:  proof of legal<br/>
compliance certification- whatever that is in your<br/>
stat, a physical, proving that your child is well<br/>
cared for and whatever highest diploma you hold, (if<br/>
it&#39;s required in your state),  xerox&#39;d all nice and<br/>
neat and tucked into a manila envelope, take them to<br/>
your worker&#39;s office and hand deliver them to her.  <br/>
<br/>
Do it face-to-face.  Inform her, very kindly,<br/>
pleasantly and with the parental authority that is<br/>
yours, that you discovered that you do not need to<br/>
replicate your reporting to CPS in order to fulfill<br/>
your state&#39;s homeschool requirements.  But, since you<br/>
know she&#39;s required to investigate even the most<br/>
frivolous claims, that you have assembled all the<br/>
documents that she should need to complete her<br/>
paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
At that point, there is precious little that she can<br/>
do besides closing the case.  No judge will issue a<br/>
warrant with the documents in front of him that you<br/>
have supplied- and she Must present them to him if she<br/>
decides to pursue invading your home, without your<br/>
consent.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, as workers are Required to remove<br/>
children from &quot;imminent danger&quot;, you have already<br/>
passed that test.  She was in your home and left<br/>
without your child, so she gave you her stamp of<br/>
approval so far as your home not being beyond the<br/>
&quot;normal house with children&quot; messy.<br/>
<br/>
This Should end the investigation.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, do you have a copy of the report?  CPS is<br/>
Required by law to give it to you- minus the name of<br/>
the reporting individual.  They do not always offer<br/>
it.  It took us over a week to get a copy, as the<br/>
worker knew we did not know the law in the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
That is how I discovered who&#39;d made the report- no one<br/>
I knew- but my crazy family- would refer to me the way<br/>
that the &quot;reporting individual&quot; did.<br/>
<br/>
It may offer clues as to who has behaved so<br/>
egregiously toward your family.  They tend to quote<br/>
the person who called it in.<br/>
<br/>
Please, please, please Katy, DO NOT let any government<br/>
official into your home, unless they have a warrant.<br/>
<br/>
In doing so, you give up a constitutional right that<br/>
cannot be reclaimed afterward.  You passed the first<br/>
time.  If she comes back and sees something that<br/>
bothers her or hears something that she doesn&#39;t<br/>
understand, you could find yourself watching your<br/>
child leave with a social worker.<br/>
<br/>
I am not an alarmist, but there are cases of exactly<br/>
that happening all over the country.  Since my<br/>
experience, I have subscribed to several national<br/>
legal homeschooler lists.  It does happen to Good<br/>
People.  The best way to avoid it is to not make<br/>
yourself vulnerable by letting them in the door.<br/>
<br/>
Please post your result when you are up to writing<br/>
about it.  This is a traumatic experience that you<br/>
will have to deal with emotionally.  Following the<br/>
proper steps will assure that it ends well for you and<br/>
yours.<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to email me off-list and I will give<br/>
you my ph #, if you&#39;d like an empathetic ear.<br/>
<br/>
For eveyone who&#39;s reading this now and breathing a big<br/>
sigh of relief because you know it could never happen<br/>
to you, don&#39;t be so sure.  I was as shocked as anyone<br/>
would be.  After all, I&#39;d been a member of an electic<br/>
group, was a charter member of  another and <br/>
co-founder of a state- wide unschoolers group.  <br/>
<br/>
Just remember, NEVER LET THEM IN YOUR HOME.  Even as<br/>
rare as it may be in your area, that is the first<br/>
action that every wrongly-reported parent takes before<br/>
their child and their family is forever traumatized by<br/>
CPS removing a child from the home.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck.<br/>

 <br/>
Is there a webpage by any chance with advice gathered?  I&#39;ve saved  your <br/>
response for the next time someone asks, but is there a place we could send  them <br/>
for additional advice too?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks.  I&#39;m really sorry it happened to you, and thanks for sharing  it here.<br/>

I was wondering if it would be okay for me to forward your email to my local<br/>
homeschooling group? It was full of great advice. One of our members also<br/>
recently had a run in with DCF here in FL. She too let them in out of fear.<br/>
I have also always heard to never let anyone in you don&#39;t have to.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I would like to send your email on so that those who think it could<br/>
never happen to them can at least be aware of what to do if.<br/>

Don&#39;t bother with pouring your heart out to CPS; I&#39;m convinced that <br/>
the majority of these people really don&#39;t care whether you&#39;re legit <br/>
or not.  It&#39;s all about the money (foster care and adoption is big <br/>
business, as callous and unbelievable as that seems.)  I learned the <br/>
hard way to stick to the facts and never discuss my personal <br/>
business without at least two friendly and knowledgeable witnesses <br/>
(preferably, one being a reputable, private attorney) by my side.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank God you made it to your son before they interviewed him <br/>
without you there -- and no, they have absolutely no right to talk <br/>
to _your_ child without your permission (nor to you) without legal <br/>
counsel.  The CPS agent declined to answer my request for <br/>
representation in front of a police officer (who also declined to <br/>
acknowledge my rights) and after he departed, threatened to take the <br/>
kids away if I didn&#39;t comply with her demand to interview us <br/>
separately.  I refused and after the interrogation, she ended up <br/>
taking them anyway (worst 48 hours of my life.) <br/>
<br/>
This woman lied through her teeth to me (never had any official <br/>
papers to snatch my kids in the first place) and to the judge at the <br/>
hearing, but thankfully, we had a well-known lawyer representing us <br/>
and our children were returned -- though not without their own tales <br/>
of abuse and neglect at the foster home and shelter(!)  Little did I <br/>
know that we&#39;d have one of those homeschool horror stories of our <br/>
own to tell someday.  But there&#39;s much, much more to this saga.  My <br/>
best advice is to turn all that fearful energy into pro-activism and <br/>
keep the faith that God will see you through this as he did our <br/>
family.<br/>
