<div id="ygrps-yiv-620504026">My kids and i recently completed a model of the solar system where we painted the planets and hung the mobile in the middle of our hallway.  What a blast to say, &quot;watch out for the solar system&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t bump into the solar system&quot; as one walks through the house.  They are asking for more solar system models to make.  I have an image of a variety of solar system hanging throughout the house.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve searched on line for other kits and have only come up with only one other kit beside the kit we&#39;ve already used or the search result gives me solar system kits for heating pools, etc.   Can any recommend kits for building, painting and hanging model solar systems?  The brand we used is by Glowing Imaginations 4M.  So far I have found only one other kit (this one comes with moons!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-971697344">When I was at University of Delaware, an astronomy professor had put<br/>
together a scale model of the solar system.  The domed building at the<br/>
center of campus was the sun and then you had to follow the directions to<br/>
find all of the planets starting with mercury being a smallish picture<br/>
posted on the lawn out front.  By the time you got to Pluto you had to get<br/>
in your car and drive way out to the other side of town to find it.  What<br/>
fun!<br/>
<br/>
I see, on their web site that they&#39;ve since made it a permanent<br/>
installation. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.udel.edu/PR/UpDate/00/21/campus1.html">http://www.udel.edu/PR/UpDate/00/21/campus1.html</a><br/>

My husband figured out one for us from our old house.  It was kinda... if our <br/>
house was the sun, and Mercury was a basketball however far away (at an <br/>
elementary school playground the kids knew about), how far to Earth?<br/>
<br/>
It was kinda silly that day, and now we&#39;ve moved and we&#39;re no longer the <br/>
center of the universe, but it would be fun to more seriously figure one out from <br/>
the house we&#39;re in now.<br/>
