<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943805556">There were so many posts that I wanted to respond to. But alas there must <br/>
of been a reason the power went out twice and I lost the snippets. With <br/>
no time to go back through the massive amount of mail to find them <br/>
(again).<br/>
<br/>
Bridget&#39;s explanation of experience reminded me of when I was hiring a <br/>
pressman. Not an easy task at a time when unemployment was low. A very <br/>
wise person said to me &quot;Make sure they have experience. I mean 15 years <br/>
of experience, not 1 year of experience 15 times over.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If all your children fall easily into unschooling, are very adaptive and <br/>
there&#39;s no neurological damage going on.. then you&#39;re going to have very <br/>
little rocks in the road with unschooling. It becomes a challange when <br/>
you hit bumps outside the norm. Or when you take on another child that <br/>
you didn&#39;t raise and have to deschool them, or *gasp* they are damaged <br/>
beyond repair and now you still need to fit that into a lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
Experience comes in many shapes and forms. And what about the ones that <br/>
are born into it.. are they more experienced? Or the ones that it comes <br/>
natural and they didn&#39;t have to awaken to it? There was no &#39;aha&#39; it just <br/>
always was and anything outside of it seems strange...<br/>
<br/>
Like I said.. many shapes and forms... I&#39;m not going to judge who&#39;s is <br/>
worth more in anyone elses eyes but my own. Which leads to experts.<br/>
<br/>
Even experts with degress might not be considered experts by others at <br/>
all. If you show me your chiropractic expert, I&#39;m going to ask if he is <br/>
Grostic. If not, he&#39;s no expert to me. In my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
We all pick our experts that belong to our belief system. In the realm of <br/>
unschooling, I would choose my father for a start.. then think about <br/>
Holt.. then maybe jump over to Lynda because she sums things up in a way <br/>
that I can relate to instantly. I haven&#39;t read enough of anyone elses <br/>
information to determine if they are my experts.<br/>
<br/>
Without a bonafide expert. Nor any officially recognized movement, then <br/>
unschooling doesn&#39;t have an owner per se. It has advocates. Some of them <br/>
vehemently disagree on certain points. Somehow, there is a commonality <br/>
amongst them, even if the devil is in the details.<br/>
<br/>
With all these advocates, who then has the right, the power, the <br/>
ownership to determine what fits into this term and what doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Should we use your expert? or my expert? (blanket question, not directed <br/>
at anyone)<br/>
<br/>
NY Times, Washington Post, Globe and Mail.. I haven&#39;t seen any <br/>
proclamations that there is a unified group of the unschoolers and they <br/>
have chosen a leader and defined the term. So we&#39;re back to square one. <br/>
No nationally recognized experts.<br/>
<br/>
And for that, I&#39;m glad. I remember learning how the AMA established <br/>
itself in courts as the medical experts. So anything alternative isn&#39;t <br/>
viable. I would hate to see the same of something so organic as <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There might be factions or groups that look to certain experts. But they <br/>
are congregating in specific places. A group here, a group there. Nothing <br/>
on a nationally established level. So there is no ownership of the word. <br/>
Or a movement en masse that says this is how it has to be if you want to <br/>
be an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, nobody has the right to proclaim it as this or that, and you <br/>
don&#39;t belong unless you follow what my group has established.<br/>
<br/>
Lets find the commonalities, like &#39;the child&#39;s agenda&#39;, and after that... <br/>
maybe it can grow into something beyond this website, that conference, <br/>
this publication etc. Who know?<br/>
<br/>
Off on a road trip, just me and the kid. I even went as far to get myself <br/>
one of those brain-scrambling cell phones for emergencies.<br/>
<br/>
Going offmail for a bit.. I&#39;ll drop in if I get near a computer... enjoy <br/>
the discussion.<br/>

&quot;People take different roads seeking <br/>
fulfillment and happiness. Just <br/>
because they&#39;re not on your road <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve gotten lost.&quot;<br/>
