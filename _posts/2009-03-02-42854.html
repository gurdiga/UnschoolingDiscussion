<div id="ygrps-yiv-143138783">I&#39;m not sure if I introduced myself, so in short, I&#39;ve a 3 year old<br/>
boy who I&#39;ve decided we&#39;ll unschool, since it seems natural and from<br/>
all the reading of different types of home education the one that<br/>
makes the most sense.  <br/>
<br/>
Now to my question, background first:<br/>
<br/>
I mostly grew up without a TV.  From the time I was 7 until I was 16,<br/>
we didn&#39;t have a TV and only borrowed one for the Olympics.  At first,<br/>
the reason we didn&#39;t have one was because our original one broke and<br/>
we were so poor we couldn&#39;t even afford to get it fixed (out of work<br/>
pastor with 8 children, I&#39;m surprised we even had clothes!).  I<br/>
suppose my parents just decided it was better not to have (perhaps<br/>
because we were the pastor&#39;s family and needed to set an example, or<br/>
perhaps because we went to a Mennonite school, I&#39;ll never know) and<br/>
for some reason I developed a stigma attached to TV.  Later in HS, my<br/>
parents were very restrictive of what we could watch - if my younger<br/>
siblings couldn&#39;t watch it, than neither could we (of course, my<br/>
younger brothers were allowed to watch as much sports as they wanted).<br/>
 I watched a lot of things I wasn&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; to while babysitting (I<br/>
loved babysitting for people who had a TV!).<br/>
<br/>
I managed to live without a TV in college (too many other things to<br/>
do), and I lived in Japan for 5 years, so my husband and I mostly<br/>
watched shows when they came out on DVD (we have quite the collection!).  <br/>
<br/>
So, where am I going with this?  Well, a little less than a year ago,<br/>
we decided to get rid of our TV and DVD player.  I found that not only<br/>
was I &quot;addicted&quot; to it (I realized how bad it was when I shushed my<br/>
husband during a show, and the thought occurred to me that I was doing<br/>
what my parents in HS when we had a TV did that really hurt me), and I<br/>
was using it as a babysitter for Seth.  I also had been doing some<br/>
reading (&quot;The Plug-in Drug&quot;) and was convinced of the evils of TV. <br/>
However, lately, I&#39;ve been reading on a lot of unschooling sites about<br/>
the benefits of TV (which make sense to me), and between the time<br/>
we&#39;ve gotten rid of the TV I&#39;ve allowed Seth to watch shows and movies<br/>
on DVD or on Netflix, so it&#39;s not like we&#39;re totally TV-free (and<br/>
despite all his watching, he&#39;s very articulate, which I attribute to<br/>
watching certain shows).  My biggest gripe with TV is the commercial<br/>
programming, and the cost to just get basic channels (we live in an<br/>
apartment, so we can&#39;t get an antenna).  Right now, my biggest<br/>
struggle is the fact that it seems like all Seth wants to do is &quot;watch<br/>
a movie&quot;.  I&#39;m cool with Caillou and Curious George (esp. CG), and he<br/>
also likes Eloise and Harold and the Purple Crayon.  And, since we use<br/>
our computer to watch, I can&#39;t use the computer while he&#39;s watching. <br/>
He also likes to play and watch (do any other kids do that?), which<br/>
drives me up the wall, not only because I&#39;m rather sensitive to<br/>
multiple sources of noise, but also because I&#39;d also like to use the<br/>
computer, and if he&#39;s not really watching it, then I&#39;ll turn of the<br/>
show (which leads to a meltdown).<br/>
<br/>
So, any thoughts?  Should we just get a TV/DVD player and let him<br/>
watch as much as he wants, even it&#39;s all day and it&#39;s annoying Mommy?<br/>
 I&#39;m trying to find freedom, not license, as A.S. Neill would say, but<br/>
I don&#39;t seem to know how to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-311319479">-=-and despite all his watching, he&#39;s very articulate-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would guess it would be BECAUSE of watching he would be more  <br/>
articulate.  There are people in there speaking all kinds of English  <br/>
in all sorts of accents, some from now, and some as far back as the  <br/>
1930s.   You couldn&#39;t do all those things for him if you read to him  <br/>
five hours a day and talked to him the rest of the time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He also likes to play and watch (do any other kids do that?), which  <br/>
drives me up the wall, -=-<br/>
<br/>
Only the smart ones.<br/>
<br/>
If being driven up the wall is going to be that close to the surface  <br/>
for you, you might want to find some stress-relieving things in your  <br/>
life.  Mediation or yoga are hard with a toddler in the house.  Brisk  <br/>
walks outside might not be easy if you&#39;re in an apartment.  Think of  <br/>
something to do, though, because he needs a mom who&#39;s not up the wall.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Should we just get a TV/DVD player and let him<br/>
watch as much as he wants, even it&#39;s all day and it&#39;s annoying Mommy?-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t really refer to yourself as &quot;Mommy&quot; to a three year old, do  <br/>
you?  It&#39;s an indirect form of communication and isn&#39;t the greatest  <br/>
for nurturing a direct relationship with him as a person.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Just&quot; you had in your question.<br/>
&quot;Should we just...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Questions with &quot;just&quot; often reveal what the questioner thinks is a bad  <br/>
answer.    I think you should get a TV and DVD player wholeheartedly.   <br/>
Generously.  Maybe a portable one with headphones.    Would he wear  <br/>
wireless headphones, maybe?<br/>
<br/>
-=and let him watch as much as he wants-=-<br/>
<br/>
When you ask it that way, the only alternative is &quot;don&#39;t let him watch  <br/>
as much as he wants.&quot;  Those aren&#39;t the only two choices.  But &quot;don&#39;t  <br/>
let him watch&quot; isn&#39;t a great choice in any case.<br/>
<br/>
Find things you like that he likes.  Find things you&#39;ve never seen  <br/>
that he likes that you can enjoy too.  If the DVDs he watches are just  <br/>
for him, kid-stuff, none of your business, then you&#39;re maintaining a  <br/>
babysitting relationship there with the TV.  If the two of you find  <br/>
things to do together that&#39;s altogether different.   YOU can do things  <br/>
while the movie&#39;s on too.  Maybe on your computer.  Maybe in the  <br/>
kitchen.  And he can play with toys.  And you can both sing along on  <br/>
the songs.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/movies">http://sandradodd.com/movies</a> might have movies you could enjoy  <br/>
together, and it will have some that might be therapeutic for getting  <br/>
you nearer to understanding unschooling, too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-85970438">I would get a portable DVD player if I were you.  Then you can take it in<br/>
the car and other places too!  It really helps for long drives.<br/>
<br/>
We have this one - our first one wore out and we liked it so much we got the<br/>
same exact one.  We&#39;ll probably be getting another one so our kids can watch<br/>
different things in the car, and also because I&#39;m going to be putting their<br/>
seats farther away from each other.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s great that your son plays and watches.  Better than sitting<br/>
there and watching.  When my kids get really really into something else,<br/>
sometimes I&#39;ll turn the TV off.  If they want it back on, it goes back on --<br/>
no meltdown required.<br/>
<br/>
If the sound really bothers you maybe you can put earplugs in or listen to<br/>
music on an ipod or something?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In addition to all that is already collected at Sandra&#39;s site....<br/>
<br/>
If your dh assumed that you weren&#39;t paying attention to your computer <br/>
because you were having a conversation with your son at the same time, or <br/>
had walked away to get a cup of coffee or something, and so walked in and <br/>
switched it off, wouldn&#39;t you react with some annoyance?<br/>
<br/>
It sure is ironic to have someone grumbling that their kid is doing other <br/>
stuff while watching tv. Most people are worried if their kids seem to be <br/>
too attentive and not doing other play at the same time. They use words like <br/>
&quot;drones&quot;, &quot;zombies&quot;, &quot;locked in&quot;. They talk about &quot;addiction&quot; instead of <br/>
&quot;passion&quot;, &quot;interested&quot;, &quot;fascinated&quot;, &quot;absorbed&quot;, &quot;excited&quot; or even <br/>
&quot;relaxing&quot; and &quot;entertained&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My experience is that Jayn, now 9, has always been perfectly able to absorb <br/>
and be interested in her shows or movies while drawing, playing with dolls, <br/>
playing computer games, playing cards, doing puzzles, sewing, crafting, <br/>
eating, wrestling with daddy, or making up stories. She also sometimes wants <br/>
the tv off, usually when we are doing a doll scenario together. Sometimes we <br/>
will have the sound off with the picture going on.<br/>
<br/>
I use foam earplugs when I&#39;m feeling sensitive and want to lessen the impact <br/>
of noises around me if I am using my computer, or when sleeping. The foam <br/>
earplugs muffle noise without being totally soundproofing. They can make the <br/>
difference between being constantly distracted and irritated, and being <br/>
comfortable while freeing Jayn for her watching and play. I still hear her <br/>
if she calls me from across the room.<br/>
<br/>
My idea here is that it&#39;s up to me to attend to my own comfort rather than <br/>
have unreasonable expectations from those around me that would cause them <br/>
emotional hardship. Asking a 3 year old not to play at the same time as <br/>
watching his tv shows seems an unreasonable expectation. If he were running <br/>
in circles and screaming at the top of his lungs...well that might mean time <br/>
to go to the park for a big run and play.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to get a tv, perhaps a portable dvd player. I would <br/>
recommend getting him his own laptop computer pretty soon. It sure made my <br/>
life easier when we got Jayn her own for internet surfing and computer <br/>
gaming. She is now on to her second one. It amazes me to think that as <br/>
recently as 12 or 13 years ago they cost several thousand dollars, and were <br/>
thicker, heavier and slower than even the cheapest versions are today.<br/>
<br/>
You can safely ignore all those studies, which are done on schooled kids, <br/>
and frankly are often goofy if you read how they set up their research <br/>
situations. Watch your son instead. Talk to him about what he is seeing with <br/>
the same sense of positive interest that you would if he was showing you the <br/>
flower he just found in the garden. I mean don&#39;t be looking for <br/>
opportunities to criticize or teach something.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I liked Caillou more. I find it very schooly, lots of &quot;going to <br/>
school soon&quot; propaganda. But that&#39;s just me. Your son might love him. Lots <br/>
of great shows for very littles on Disney in the morning. Also Jayn loved <br/>
Bob the Builder and Max & Ruby (sigh). She used to like Wiggles, but can&#39;t <br/>
abide them now. Now her favorite shows are Family Guy, American Dad, Ghost <br/>
Whisperer, various cooking shows, How Clean is Your House, and a few shows <br/>
on Disney. (Jury still out on the new sitcom, Sonny With A Chance).<br/>

I had huge reservations about this show when Wyl found it. I&#39;m  still not <br/>
fond of it, but it is *huge* on social commentary. That show has  sparked more <br/>
deep social conversation between Wyl and I (and  occasionally Dave) than all the <br/>
other shows combined, probably. In a way, I&#39;m  glad for it, because even <br/>
though the subject matter is often uncomfortable, it  spurs Wyl to ask, which <br/>
frees me to answer directly, rather than trying to find  the &quot;right&quot; time to bring <br/>
it up. Or avoiding it all together because of my  discomfort. It didn&#39;t take <br/>
more than one or two questions for me to relax a lot  about my discomfort-it <br/>
wasn&#39;t nearly as difficult (or embarrassing) as I thought  it would be! <br/>
Speaking of which, I had something I wanted input on, but I&#39;ll put  that in another <br/>
post.<br/>

&gt; we didn&#39;t have a TV and only borrowed one for the Olympics.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I grew up without a TV for the first part of my childhood and my parents<br/>
finally got a TV when we were a bit older.  It was a black and white,<br/>
when everyone around us had color TV&#39;s.  Even when we did have TV, we<br/>
were only allowed to watch every once in a while.  My sister and I would<br/>
go through the TV guide to pick out our shows, because we had to agree,<br/>
and then we would watch only those ones and it couldn&#39;t amount to more<br/>
than one hour a day and it couldn&#39;t interfere with dinner time.<br/>
<br/>
I remember feeling really anxious if we were out and about, or eating<br/>
out at a restaurant, wondering if we&#39;d get home in time to watch the<br/>
whole show that we&#39;d picked out.<br/>
<br/>
The scarcity of it, made it extremely valuable, something to work one&#39;s<br/>
schedule around.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I watched a lot of things I wasn&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; to while babysitting (I<br/>
&gt; loved babysitting for people who had a TV!).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I watched Poltergeist at a friend&#39;s house without my parents knowing.  I<br/>
was about 11.  My parents would&#39;ve been VERY mad about it.  So, I<br/>
watched a scary movie, with absolutely no clue about scary movies or<br/>
that anything could give me nightmares.  I was completely niave about<br/>
the whole thing, and on top of that, I had no parents to talk to about<br/>
it.  That had a lasting impression on me!  I didn&#39;t want to repeat that<br/>
for my own kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I lived without TV in college too.  I didn&#39;t own a TV as a young adult<br/>
until I met my husband and lived with him.  I was a little resistant to<br/>
having a TV, and I had to deal with a lot of TV issues when we had our<br/>
first child.  Ultimately, it seemed healthier to have a TV and not make<br/>
a big fuss over it.  I could view owning a TV within the same context as<br/>
having a radio or tape deck, which is what we had then, something to use<br/>
and enjoy when I wanted to.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is a natural reaction to a controlled substance.  I had to<br/>
deal with similar issues.  It took years to do it, but I was finally<br/>
able to have a TV on in the same room as me, and NOT watch it or pay<br/>
attention to it.  It&#39;s a big deal!  Now I can multi-task with the TV on<br/>
and keep up with the story and do other things.  Which you&#39;ve already<br/>
noticed that your child can do!  It&#39;s amazing what control will do to<br/>
someone&#39;s natural abilities!<br/>
<br/>
and I<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s interesting to me how some people revile an inanimate object! <br/>
Especially one that has the potential for such joy and excitement.  That<br/>
title alone says a lot.  TV viewed as a drug, or controlled substance<br/>
that is harmful.  I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that control itself is<br/>
often more harmful than the thing being controlled, and in the absence<br/>
of control, the thing has less draw, less power.<br/>

  Right now, my biggest<br/>

controlled won&#39;t watch always and forever.  We&#39;ve had very little TV for<br/>
the last couple of days, nobody has been all that interested.  Find a<br/>
way to make it so that it doesn&#39;t annoy you, find joy in it.  Find joy<br/>
in the joy that your child gets from it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-9509325">It is amazing how in America people FEAR TV so much.<br/>
It is very different where I grew up.<br/>
Maybe it was just my house or all the people we hung with but in Brazil people do not have the kind of relationship <br/>
with TV and Commercial adds that people have in America.<br/>
My dad was a photographer for advertising campaigns and we absolutely LOVED  commercials.<br/>
We discussed if they were good, bad,  good photography, music, jingle...and so much more.<br/>
We bonded watching things like Mutual of Omaha animal documentaries, movies and more.<br/>
We even watched Brazilian soap and discussed ( they are VERY different than the soap here)<br/>
Even opening scenes where talked about and a subject for us to evaluate.<br/>
Just for fun.<br/>
I grew up with no fear of TV. I love TV.<br/>
Sometimes I watch , sometimes not. I DVR my favorite shows. My sister still calls me to talk about a certain commercial she finds good.<br/>
My kids have the same relationship with TV we had. <br/>
I have learned so much from watching TV and I still do.<br/>
I wish people could just see it as I do . It must be really hard to fear something so much and live thinking of ways to avoid it.<br/>
So much power being given to TV one must feel so powerless and scared.<br/>
It is hard for me to relate to the feeling.<br/>

I have heard homeschoolers discussing preschoolers learning of letters for example.  Someone always suggests &quot;the letter factory&quot; because their kids learned their letters from it.  And then on a couple of occasions have heard people express their dislike for that because they want their kids to learn from THEM not from the T.V.  They are so afraid they wont have control over every aspect of their kids lives.</div>

in public on the internet was &quot;You&#39;ll be your child&#39;s only teacher!&quot;    <br/>
It was written with giddy joy.<br/>
<br/>
I responded that I hoped I wasn&#39;t my child&#39;s only teacher, that I  <br/>
hoped he would learn from everyone he came in contact with.  Oh.   <br/>
WRONG ANSWER.   That&#39;s the day I learned how many people there who  <br/>
didn&#39;t want ANYone influencing their kid or even looking at their kid.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wanted mine to meet LOTS of people who knew things I didn&#39;t know.  I  <br/>
still count on that!<br/>

painful ways of learning information.  And I think many times TV fits<br/>
both of those criteria.  (Not ALL the time but many times.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>me too!  i don&#39;t get that AT ALL.  why homeschool and intentionally keep information from your kids?  *i* learn from tv all the time.  just this week i learned how to make a roux for gumbo (top chef), how thermometers are made (how things are made), and that i do not under any circumstances want to be a wealthy socialite in manhattan (yes, i watched a bit of the housewives of nyc).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477437298">Since I posted two days ago, I had only read Sandra&#39;s response, and was thinking about all that she said, with the intention of responding, and I come back and there&#39;s much!  Thank you, mostly for not being too frustrated with my &quot;baby-ness&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Having read through more of the responses and thought more about it, I&#39;ve reached several conclusions:<br/>
<br/>
-As natural as unschooling is, especially for a non-institutionalized child such as my son, it is so counter-cultural for me, that I&#39;m still realizing I have a lot of deschooling to do.<br/>
-I am realizing that I have a bit of a control issue (as in I want to be in control) and my fear of allowing him to watch what he wants when he wants, makes me feel like I&#39;m not in &quot;control of my household&quot; so to speak.  <br/>
-I&#39;m going to have to learn to look at things from more of a &quot;we/us&quot; perspective and less of a &quot;us (parents) vs. him (child)&quot; perspective, which goes back to the deschooling bit.  <br/>
-I&#39;m learning to be more and more leery of studies, especially since they will tell me nothing about my own child - only he can.  I&#39;m a little ashamed I didn&#39;t already know this, being attachment parenting oriented.  It&#39;s a large learning curve for me, I suppose.<br/>
-Until pointed out, I never thought of the idea that watching TV would expose Seth to more diversity than books.  And, just because I love books, doesn&#39;t mean that he does.  After all, he can&#39;t read.  And, now more than when I was growing up, there are a lot of shows!  My husband, who grew up with cable, has a lot of amazing knowledge which he learned from watching the Discovery and Science channels...I was amazed, since I was taught that smart people were only so because they read and didn&#39;t watch TV.  Go figure.<br/>
-I need to find things that I&#39;ll enjoy watching with Seth and he with me.  I&#39;m not going to worry about age appropriateness/censoring, since I don&#39;t believe in that sort of thing anyways.  Just the other day we discovered, on Netflix the Pink Panther Cartoon Collection, which is fun for both of us!  And, last weekend, my husband put on Space Balls, which we all enjoyed.  <br/>
-I&#39;ve decided to be glad that he plays and watches, because it&#39;s true, I wouldn&#39;t want him slack-jawed and motionless.  So, I&#39;m going to turn that annoyance into a blessing.  Besides, how much different is it that I knit and watch?<br/>
-And, finally, whenever I start feeling like he&#39;s watching &quot;too much&quot; I&#39;ll just remind myself how I&#39;d feel if someone restricted my reading.<br/>
<br/>
For the last few days, my husband and I have been in what might be called &quot;negotiation talks&quot; regarding a television.  Right not it&#39;s not so much whether we should get one, but rather, what kind.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you!<br/>
<br/>
