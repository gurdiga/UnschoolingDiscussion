<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that PART of what she is experiencing is an economic<br/>
prejudice, rather than an age prejudice.  Medicare patients often aren&#39;t as<br/>
lucrative for the hospital or doctor as a working person w. good health<br/>
insurance.  (Someone please correct me if I have distorted the picture.) <br/>
It&#39;s an impersonal kind of financial prejudice.  I don&#39;t know if that makes<br/>
it any better.<br/>
<br/>
But age prejudice and gender prejudices are real, and not uncommon in our<br/>
culture.  &quot;Little old ladies&quot; aren&#39;t given much status.<br/>
<br/>
A third part is that instutions, such as hospitals and schools, aren&#39;t by<br/>
nature humane.  (We could have a long philosophical discussion about how to<br/>
change them, which would be interesting, but wouldn&#39;t help you much right<br/>
now.)<br/>
<br/>
My mom&#39;s pretty fiesty.  I will ask her what she knows about patients<br/>
rights and elder issues in health care.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there!<br/>

P.S. (My MIL is having surgery today, so you have my sympathy and my<br/>
empathy, too.  She&#39;s an active-duty military widow, so she still gets<br/>
treated in military hospitals.  None of the hospital staff really looks old<br/>
enough (to me) to be out of high school, but WOW they are unfailingly<br/>
polite.)</div>
