 </span></blockquote>Oops, that&#39;s an editing problem.  Sorry!  It started out about a million<br/>
decision in a piece, and then went to decisions every minute, and then got<br/>
sent without adjustment.<br/>
<br/>
The editor is NOT in.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I beg you to patiently remember that it is 6-9 hours later here, depending<br/>
where in America you may be.  I&#39;m usually reading email at Midnight.  I make<br/>
less sense at midnight.<br/>
<br/>
But you can come to South Carolina in August and see if I make more sense<br/>
when I&#39;m more awake!<br/>

I figured it was a violin situation!  There ARE tons of optional treatments <br/>
and positions and bowing directions and stuff!<br/>
<br/>
Two of the recorder players I play with are tonguing everything.  I&#39;m trying <br/>
to talk them out of it.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the things beginners learn because it&#39;s hard to get a tone <br/>
without tonguing when you&#39;re new at it, and hard to have any non-doodly quiet <br/>
between notes unless you stop the air.  &quot;Tonguing&quot; on a recorder isn&#39;t <br/>
tongue-to-wood, it&#39;s &quot;duh&quot; with the tongue against the ridge behind the top <br/>
teeth.   Not like tonguing on a clarinet or oboe.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, they learned to tongue and now I can&#39;t convince them to let it go <br/>
on runs.  To &quot;sing&quot; the parts as though they were singing the lyrics, and not <br/>
to tongue right in the middle of a held vowel.<br/>
<br/>
They look at me.  They understand what I&#39;m saying in English and they would <br/>
LIKE to play it so that it sounds more musical, but they&#39;re stuck with an <br/>
over-learned habit.<br/>
