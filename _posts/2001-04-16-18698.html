Hmm. Try homeschool? Instead of homeschooling? I would<br/>
start at your library, reading homeschooling books,<br/>
just to get an idea of where you want to head. And...<br/>
someone else will probably mention deschooling, so<br/>
I&#39;ll leave that to them. Juli<br/>

would suggest reading &quot;The Home schooling Handbook&quot; by Griffith, &quot;The 
Unschooling Handbook&quot; by Griffith, &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; by John Holt, and a myraid 
of other books.&nbsp; Don&#39;t worry!&nbsp; You have a bit of time to figure out 
how to go about this.&nbsp; Also, read about your states requirements for home 
schooling at <a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschool.crosswalk.com/laws">http://www.homeschool.crosswalk.com/laws</a>&nbsp;and 
most of all, call a bunch of different support groups in your area and talk to 
some people who are home schooling near you.&nbsp; They will be able to help you 
to decipher your requirements and enlighten you to their approach to home 
schooling.&nbsp; Their are many different approaches so don&#39;t just listen to one 
and think it is the only way.&nbsp; Good Luck.</span></font></div>

     *There are so many different ways to homeschool.  From strict <br/>
school-at-home, to unschooling, and everything in between.  (Does <br/>
anybody still have that &quot;Don&#39;t close your doors on baking day&quot; <br/>
essay?)  Since you asked an unschooling list, you will get <br/>
unschooling ideas.  Have you visited www.unschooling.com ?<br/>
<br/>
For a while - say until the end of the summer - do nothing.  Pretend <br/>
it&#39;s summer vacation already.  It seems that even strict school-at-<br/>
homers take time to detox.<br/>
<br/>
Am I making any sense?<br/>
<br/>
Go to the park, the library, just anywhere she wants to go.  Don&#39;t <br/>
keep track of what she&#39;s learning.  Don&#39;t teach her.  Let her lead <br/>
for a while.  It will take time to find a balance.  Really - whatever <br/>
works for you.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559886326">Do NOT spend hundreds of dollars.  Not yet.  Don&#39;t buy a curriculum until <br/>
you&#39;ve really studied your options. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re afraid and you want to keep your foot in the schoolish water for a <br/>
while, I advise using the library.  If you want &quot;a curriculum&quot; for a while, <br/>
make a chart.  Go get books (any books your daughter likes, but maybe go for <br/>
illustrated non-fiction--stuff with great charts, photos, paintings).  Don&#39;t <br/>
make her read them.  Just looking at the pictures is good.  You look too.  <br/>
Even without her.  See what all is in there.  You&#39;ll find cooking in a <br/>
history book, and math in a science book, and science in a geography book, <br/>
and languages in music.   Start getting used to that cross-pollination.  <br/>
School doesn&#39;t encourage it, usually.  It&#39;s the key to learning, though.<br/>
<br/>
You (the mom, not the child) take notes all you want, keep charts all you <br/>
want, but they&#39;re not necessary longterm.   <br/>
<br/>
By next fall, if you read lots here and in books on homeschooling, you will <br/>
probably not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a curriculum.  You might by <br/>
then have spent some on art supplies (good ones, not cheapo walmart stuff)  <br/>
and books and stuff.  But take your time.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of yahoogroups for resources, go to google.com and try looking for <br/>
unschool and homeschool and such.  Follow links on pages.  Wander around <br/>
websites.  Websites are a better resource than discussion groups, in my <br/>
experience.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a starting place which leads to lots of other people&#39;s and groups&#39; <br/>
starting places:<br/>

<div>&quot;Our hunger to be bigger than we are could be just delusions of grandeur or 
it could be the very voice of God inside calling us to a larger inheritance, to 
a bigger stake in reality, to a truer sense of our identity as the sons and

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629412224">Hi:  I did the same thing a few years ago with my 5th, 3rd and 1st grader all at once.  RELAX. <br/>
Take a couple of weeks to enjoy your child and then see where she is and go from there.  (Sounds<br/>
stupid but I promise you it works).  Try searching on AskJeeves.  That&#39;s where I&#39;ve gotten a lot<br/>
of links to sites.<br/>
