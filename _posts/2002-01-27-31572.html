&gt;She has a goal.. a schedule... an agenda and<br/>

&gt;that what she perceives as<br/>
&gt;&#39;behind&#39; isn&#39;t really behind at all if she<br/>
&gt;considers that she&#39;s way ahead in<br/>
&gt;other areas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*Ahh, that fateful question :-)*<br/>
<br/>
Sarah, these are pre-teen, or teenage children? This seems to be more of <br/>
mentoring situation.<br/>
<br/>
How would you handle it if a dear friend or close relative came to you <br/>
with this question?<br/>
<br/>
If someone came to me about not meeting expectations, a sister, a friend, <br/>
I&#39;d ask them if they are telling me this because they want my help, or <br/>
because they just need to let it out.<br/>
<br/>
Then according to the answer, I&#39;d ask if they need help or suggestions. <br/>
Or I&#39;d just let them let the steam out and go merrily on the way.<br/>
<br/>
If they need suggestions, I&#39;d talk about goals and setting realistic <br/>
ones. I&#39;d talk about setting smaller goals that eventually lead up to the <br/>
big one.<br/>
<br/>
I would also &#39;check-in&#39; with them on occasion and ask how its going with <br/>
that issue. Again, according to the response, I&#39;d  tailor my conversation <br/>
accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I&#39;ve got issues that I&#39;m having a hard time getting through <br/>
on my own. These are not parenting issues. I&#39;m quite secure in that area. <br/>
These are issues concerning goals and expectations of myself in certain <br/>
areas of my life.<br/>
<br/>
If I went to a mentor and wanted help with this issue, I wouldn&#39;t want to <br/>
hear &#39;but thats okay because you&#39;re a great parent&#39;. I want to hear about <br/>
this issue and how I can get help to eventually overcome it.<br/>
<br/>
