&lt;&lt; His teacher asked how he knew to do forty, and how he knew <br/>
how many to do. (they do sets of ten, counted in Japanese) Jack just laughed <br/>
and said &quot;you know! Four tens is forty!&quot; So Jack knows how to multiply, but <br/>
Jack doesn&#39;t KNOW multiplication.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Holly told me a story yesterday about her visit to England two years back.  <br/>
She went to school twice (uniform and all) to St. Andrews&#39;s in Kirk Ella.<br/>
<br/>
She said the teacher was asking the children to count to ten in a different <br/>
language.  Some kids knew one or another.  Holly said there were six <br/>
different languages, and for one of  them the teacher had said &quot;Well we ALL <br/>
know THIS one!&quot; and the children all together (except for the baffled Holly) <br/>
counted.  I asked her if it had been French, or German, and she didn&#39;t know.  <br/>
But then she said she counted in Japanese, and all of them seemed really <br/>
impressed.  She had learned it at karate class.<br/>
