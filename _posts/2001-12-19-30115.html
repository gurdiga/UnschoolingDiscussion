Our son (at two and a half) is already starting to get, from total<br/>
strangers, the routine that goes, &quot;Are you a good boy? Because Santa&#39;s<br/>
coming, you know. If you&#39;re good, he&#39;s going to bring you lots of toys.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I refuse to give anybody this power over him - or let them give us (his<br/>
parents) this power. When people ask whether he&#39;s a &quot;good boy&quot; (in Christmas<br/>
season or out), I say, &quot;Yes, he&#39;s good. All children are good. There are no<br/>
bad children.&quot; This usually throws &#39;em for a loop.<br/>
<br/>
I respond:<br/>
We believe in Santa in our home.  And we do NOT espouse the &quot;you get only if<br/>
you&#39;re &#39;good&#39;&quot; approach -they do not go hand in hand.  We are more the into<br/>
the spirit of generosity and giving....and the joy of receiving gifts given<br/>
from affection for each other.<br/>
