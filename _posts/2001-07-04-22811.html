&gt; Big Brother is here<br/>
&gt; Â© 2001 WorldNetDaily.com<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Oregon Senate has approved a plan to screen first-born children<br/>
&gt; for medical and social problems, and the House is expected to follow<br/>
&gt; suit.<br/>
&gt; What exactly does this mean? I&#39;m not 100 percent sure. But I know<br/>
&gt; enough to tell it is an incredibly bad, hopelessly intrusive idea that<br/>
&gt; makes George Orwell seem like a prophet.<br/>
&gt; Backers of the plan, notably one Gov. John Kitzhaber, say that with so<br/>
&gt; many broken, dysfunctional families, the state needs to do more to<br/>
&gt; identify and help at-risk children.<br/>
&gt; The plan calls for screening all first-born infants about 18,000 a<br/>
&gt; year in the state for medical problems and risk factors that could<br/>
&gt; lead to abuse or neglect, or cause children to fail in school. Nurses<br/>
&gt; and other professional busybodies would have license to visit homes of<br/>
&gt; new parents to check them out for drug use and alcohol problems among<br/>
&gt; other things.<br/>
&gt; Like what other things? Well, already hospitals and doctors in Oregon<br/>
&gt; and elsewhere survey new parents on subjects such as whether they keep<br/>
&gt; guns in the home. Children, too, are sometimes asked these questions<br/>
&gt; in visits with pediatricians.<br/>
&gt; In other words, this is about social engineering by the state not<br/>
&gt; diagnosing medical problems. This is just another power play by<br/>
&gt; government to see how far people will allow Big Brother to go in<br/>
&gt; insinuating itself into the most intimate details of your private<br/>
&gt; family life.<br/>
&gt; And the sad part is there doesn&#39;t seem to be any understanding growing<br/>
&gt; within our country that government is far exceeding its constitutional<br/>
&gt; and proper authority. No one really seems to be all that concerned<br/>
&gt; about invasions of privacy.<br/>
&gt; The costs of such power plays are stunning.<br/>
&gt; In Oregon, this program is expected to cost $66 million a year. That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a lot of money in a small state. In fact, if you took that money and<br/>
&gt; merely redistributed it to the 18,000 families under scrutiny every<br/>
&gt; year, you could gift them each $3,667.<br/>
&gt; Now, I&#39;m not into redistribution of wealth. But, if the goal were<br/>
&gt; really to help these folks, which, of course, it isn&#39;t, don&#39;t you<br/>
&gt; think the cash in the pocket would do more than the snooping?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m amazed. I sit here continually astonished at the way Americans<br/>
&gt; from coast to coast watch their freedoms disappear without a concern<br/>
&gt; in the world. Think of the sacrifices that were made so that our<br/>
&gt; country would not end up as another totalitarian gulag state. But we<br/>
&gt; see ourselves plummeting down the slippery slope toward tyranny, and<br/>
&gt; many of us embrace it because we feel more secure and safer under the<br/>
&gt; watchful eyes of the nanny-state. It makes me sick.<br/>
&gt; What can we do about it? That&#39;s the key question. Every day, people<br/>
&gt; hopefully ask me how to stop these disturbing trends, reverse them,<br/>
&gt; get our country back.<br/>
&gt; The first step is always being informed understanding the threats and<br/>
&gt; fighting them.<br/>
&gt; A great resource for understanding the encroaching power of the state<br/>
&gt; and other forces attacking our privacy rights is a new book by Michael<br/>
&gt; Hyatt. It&#39;s a great primer, and it offers a blueprint for protecting<br/>
&gt; yourself and fighting back.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s called &quot;Invasion of Privacy: How to Protect Yourself in the<br/>
&gt; Digital Age,&quot; and it is available in the WorldNetDaily online store.<br/>
&gt; If you think I&#39;m just simply hyping another product that happens to be<br/>
&gt; in the WorldNetDaily store, sample it free for yourself.<br/>
&gt; Last week, WorldNetDaily offered a serialization of the first chapter.<br/>
&gt; The hotlinks to that series are offered below. Hyatt explains that<br/>
&gt; privacy in our digital age is often literally a matter of life and<br/>
&gt; death. Whether the invasions come from private companies or government<br/>
&gt; agencies, there are always unintended consequences and hidden agendas<br/>
&gt; behind the intrusions.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s time to say, &quot;Enough is enough. I&#39;m not going to take it<br/>
&gt; anymore.&quot; It&#39;s time to just say no to the professional snoops<br/>
&gt; especially those we pay with our hard-earned tax dollars.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802989834">Well...<br/>
<br/>
It will create jobs!<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if a family&#39;s refusal to cooperate would be #1 on the risk-list and <br/>
result in their having their own social worker assigned to follow up to see <br/>
what they&#39;re hiding...<br/>
<br/>
Very scary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-267429487">Actually, that has been discussed as I understand it.  They are going to put<br/>
together one of those &quot;nice&quot; profiles so they will know &quot;in advance&quot; how<br/>
many children &quot;may be in jeopardy.&quot;<br/>
