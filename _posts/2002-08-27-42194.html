 </span></blockquote>I think this is what is bothering me most. The list really had found a good, <br/>
helpful, fun, unschooling tone. It&#39;s gone now. That&#39;s hard for this <br/>
old-timer (geezer?) to take right now. Maybe it&#39;s just a thing that these <br/>
kind of lists have to go through now and again. As a Taoist, I do understand <br/>
that sh*t happens. We&#39;ve just gotta get through it and get past it.<br/>
