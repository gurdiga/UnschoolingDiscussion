John Seely Brown has had an epiphany. <br/>
<br/>
In the past year and a half, the knowledge expert and chief scientist of Xerox<br/>
said he&#39;s gained a new respect--indeed an awe--for screen language. <br/>
<br/>
And what is screen language? It&#39;s simply the vernacular of digital culture,<br/>
the way technology is increasingly put in the service of human imagination in<br/>
sophisticated ways. For the shorthand version, just think of any teenager&#39;s<br/>
natural affinity for instant messaging, video games, movies, open source, and<br/>
eBay. <br/>
<br/>
How can that affinity be tapped, and how can those abilities be understood and<br/>
applied to lifelong learning? <br/>
<br/>
As Seely Brown told a group of about 20 educators who attended his talk at<br/>
Harvard Business School on April 29, &quot;If you can&#39;t deal with screen language,<br/>
you are not literate!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Lacing his message with wit and a copiously illustrated slide presentation,<br/>
Seely Brown offered his thoughts on the new wave of knowledge transfer to<br/>
educators who came to HBS for a three-day program in adult and distance<br/>
learning. The program, held April 28 to April 30 and organized by the HBS<br/>
Division of Research, included sessions on designing interactive learning<br/>
activities and issues in adult learning. Seely Brown, who gave the kick-off<br/>
speech, is also the director of the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and the<br/>
author (with Paul Duguid) of &quot;The Social Life of Information.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
According to Seely Brown, there is a new kind of digital divide now, and it is<br/>
the divide between faculty and students. Faculty, stuck in yesterday&#39;s analog<br/>
world, are confronted with students who arrive nicely fluent in digital<br/>
technology and the virtues of hyperspeed. Students already have a handle on<br/>
how to convey their emotional states electronically. It&#39;s up to adults to<br/>
learn that vernacular, he said. Educators who create programs for adult<br/>
learning and distance learning need to apply the vernacular and deepen and<br/>
strengthen these new means of communication. <br/>
<br/>
A cold medium?  As an engineer, Seely Brown has continually battled the<br/>
problem of how to convey context through technology that only deals in<br/>
content. The content side is easy. At PARC, for instance, one of the great<br/>
ideas that fell flat was to invite well-known individuals to address a PARC<br/>
forum every Thursday afternoon. The speeches were to be Webcast throughout the<br/>
premises so 300 PARC employees could follow them at their workstations. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Efficiency is not the same as effectiveness,&quot; Seely Brown said to the HBS<br/>
participants. It was disconcerting for speakers to arrive at the huge<br/>
auditorium, he said, find only four or five people sitting there and be told,<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s OK, you&#39;ve got X number of eyeballs on the Webcast. So you can feel good<br/>
now.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
No one enjoys talking into thin air; a good speaker, like an actor, is always<br/>
engaged in conversation with the audience during the performance. That sense<br/>
of unleashing a dialogue between the speaker and the audience was lost with<br/>
Webcasting, Seely Brown said. <br/>
<br/>
The experience taught him how important both content and context are to<br/>
learning, and how desirable yet elusive it is to find a way to facilitate that<br/>
interplay. &quot;Technology is not good at context today,&quot; Seely Brown said. <br/>
<br/>
One intriguing exception is offered by the Linux open-source movement. With<br/>
Linux, programmers write code to be read by their peers all over the world. In<br/>
crafting the code, they build on each other&#39;s progress. The system is a form<br/>
of &quot;cognitive apprenticeship,&quot; Seely Brown said, because a programmer who<br/>
wants to be part of the Linux community adapts to the style and tastes of how<br/>
Linux works. The aesthetic--the context--underlying this building process, not<br/>
just the fact of code itself, is worth taking seriously, he said. <br/>
<br/>
Reading the screen language Delving into screen language is another promising<br/>
start for sharing knowledge through both content and context. <br/>
<br/>
Several methods Seely Brown has witnessed in the past year have greatly<br/>
impressed him, although he admitted it was a hard sell for a long time. &quot;I<br/>
must have been a dinosaur. I thought hypertext was a joke. I hated video<br/>
games; I thought they were a complete waste of time.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
He met three people who encouraged him to adjust his attitude: Stephanie<br/>
Barish, of the Annenberg Center for Communication, at the University of<br/>
Southern California; Shigeru Miyagawa of MIT, a specialist in technology,<br/>
language and culture; and J.C. Herz, author of &quot;Joystick Nation: How<br/>
Videogames Ate Our Quarters, Won Our Hearts, and Rewired Our Minds.&quot; They<br/>
challenged him to think about experiments in new media and about how media<br/>
might fundamentally alter how people communicate among themselves as well as<br/>
with students. <br/>
<br/>
One project of Barish&#39;s, for example, coaxed undergraduates and graduate<br/>
students to think about more than mastering some fun tools. Students had to<br/>
write their term papers in a multimedia language. Print was not allowed. The<br/>
project included not just film students but also students of humanities such<br/>
as history, philosophy, English, and women&#39;s studies. <br/>
<br/>
At the start of a women&#39;s literature course, for instance, the students were<br/>
asked to pick a feminist they admired, find four photographs that expressed<br/>
the power of that particular woman, and write a very simple paragraph under<br/>
each photograph to explain why they chose the photo. Said Seely Brown, &quot;The<br/>
beauty of doing that is that in the visual world you have no room for caveats<br/>
or commas or qualifiers or parentheses. In fact, Picasso does not traffic in<br/>
commas...It&#39;s so very clear what he wanted to say.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Other classroom projects included making an &quot;interpretive film&quot; around a<br/>
favorite poem, and creating a composite image with Photoshop to reveal<br/>
important aspects of the students&#39; autobiographies. The latter project was not<br/>
complete until students went to the front of the class and explained to their<br/>
classmates what they were trying to express through the images. <br/>
<br/>
At HBS, Seely Brown was quizzed by several participants on whether images have<br/>
a tendency to distort information. Art images can be deceptive, observed one<br/>
educator. While it is good to approach media with an open mind, and while many<br/>
students can indeed learn some &quot;nifty&quot; techniques that yield seemingly<br/>
impressive results, real--as opposed to surface--learning requires navigating<br/>
much tougher terrain. <br/>
<br/>
Another educator said she was troubled by the prospect of summing up a<br/>
feminist&#39;s complex life story in four photographs. Much can be captured in a<br/>
photo, but &quot;much is lost&quot; as well, she said. <br/>
<br/>
Seely Brown accepted their reservations to a degree. However, he said, none of<br/>
these projects constituted &quot;a final event&quot; in the learning process. Rather,<br/>
they provided a powerful entryway to engage hearts and minds. The real<br/>
learning of students in the Photoshop project he mentioned, for example, was<br/>
not the creation of composite photos but the remarkable experience of getting<br/>
up in front of their classmates and discussing their autobiographies. <br/>
<br/>
The Web is a medium that &quot;honors&quot; multiple forms of intelligence and has tools<br/>
that amplify and express content as well as contextual aspects of emotion,<br/>
passion and feeling, he observed. &quot;I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t do that with text.<br/>
But I&#39;m saying, &#39;Here is the vernacular. We aren&#39;t paying much attention to<br/>
how that vernacular could enable us to open up forms of communication,<br/>
expression and so on.&#39; That, I think, is going to become increasingly<br/>
important.&quot; Improvements in technology will make such forms of communication<br/>
easier and easier to do. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I spent my life reading corporate memos that were written so they couldn&#39;t be<br/>
misread. And I&#39;ll tell you, every department reads them differently,&quot; Seely<br/>
Brown said. Image texts and music texts are similarly open to interpretation,<br/>
he allowed. &quot;The real catch for me is not that this is an end in itself. I&#39;m<br/>
not arguing that we should never have text qua print text. I&#39;m suggesting that<br/>
this may be a powerful way in for kids in terms of appreciating more their<br/>
vernacular, in order then to be able to open up experiences, get a more<br/>
expressive medium...and then build on that.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Cultivating a sense for different vernaculars and how we use them is something<br/>
we don&#39;t think much about, he added. <br/>
