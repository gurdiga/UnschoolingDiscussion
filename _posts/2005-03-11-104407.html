<div id="ygrps-yiv-792682847">Found an article on MSN and traced it back to Scholastic&#39;s website. <br/>
This is something you might be able to give to doubters.  It&#39;s<br/>
obviously *not* unschooling, but it does have a few unschoolish bits<br/>
about reading (and unlike the title states, the basic premise applies<br/>
to both genders, of course).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sending it along because I know there are some people (relatives,<br/>
husbands, friends, etc.) who might distrust pro-unschooling<br/>
literature.  This is from a schoolish site, a well-known company, and<br/>
still states that the best way to get kids to love reading is to let<br/>
them read what they want - what interests them - whether it&#39;s comics<br/>
or gaming manuals, etc.  The author also points out that the parent<br/>
should not judge what the child chooses to read.  Who cares if it&#39;s<br/>
high literature?  <br/>
<br/>
It might be a starting place for someone.<br/>

If Your Boy Won&#39;t Read<br/>
Chill out and get down with what he loves, starting with the comics.<br/>
by Betty Holcomb<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re the parent of one, like I am, it&#39;s no surprise to you that<br/>
tween and teen boys read less, and tend to score lower on standardized<br/>
reading tests than girls. You know that your son has things he finds<br/>
far more interesting than actually reading a book. There&#39;s the<br/>
countdown to &quot;Halo Tuesday,&quot; the red-letter day the latest version of<br/>
the popular video game &quot;Halo&quot; hits store shelves. When playing Halo<br/>
gets old, there&#39;s instant messaging while he simultaneously flips<br/>
between the Cartoon Network, the Sci-Fi channel, and Comedy Central.<br/>
That&#39;s life in the video age. When you shut that down, he turns to<br/>
anything that involves action, from a neighborhood game of Capture the<br/>
Flag to soccer, football, biking, or skateboarding.<br/>
<br/>
Not that you haven&#39;t fought a valiant battle on behalf of books.<br/>
You&#39;ve tried trips to the library and bookstore, and made sure that<br/>
every title on the school&#39;s summer reading list is in the house.<br/>
You&#39;ve limited video games and television, which turned into an<br/>
endurance test for both of you, as your son whined, complained,<br/>
wheeled, cajoled, and pleaded to win those privileges back. When<br/>
forced, he skimmed through those classic books, making sure you<br/>
understood what a bore they were. By now, you&#39;re even bored with your<br/>
own lecture on the critical importance of reading as an essential<br/>
life-long skill, a source of pleasure and power, the key to academic<br/>
success.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, he&#39;s still not engaged in reading. He never asks for a<br/>
book, and often complains bitterly about the ones assigned at school.<br/>
In fact, he tells you he&#39;d rather die than read classics like Little<br/>
House on the Prairie or The Diary of Anne Frank.<br/>
<br/>
Make Reading Useful, Fun, and Funny<br/>
Don&#39;t despair. A new generation of experts on boys and reading finally<br/>
has some cures. &quot;Any boy can and will get excited about reading, if<br/>
you make it useful, fun, and funny,&quot; says John Scieszka, author of The<br/>
Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales and founder of the<br/>
popular web site GuysRead.com. &quot;We have to give them more choices, and<br/>
especially more nonfiction. Boys like to read for a purpose, to find<br/>
out how to do things, like how to build a dirt bike or skateboard.<br/>
That&#39;s just not encouraged enough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly right, says Jeff Wilhelm, associate professor of English<br/>
education at Boise State University and one of the nation&#39;s leading<br/>
authorities on boys and literacy. &quot;Boys like to read what&#39;s toolish,<br/>
not schoolish.&quot; By &quot;toolish,&quot; Wilhelm says, he means that boys eagerly<br/>
devour anything that connects to their daily life, interests, and<br/>
imagination. &quot;Boys prefer reading things that have something they can<br/>
immediately use, talk about, argue about, or do something with,&quot; he<br/>
says. &quot;They are very, very impatient with the reading they do in<br/>
school, because it&#39;s not useful or interesting to them. Even worse,<br/>
they then have to take a test on it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wilhelm comes to these conclusions based on a major study of boys in<br/>
grades 6 to 12, who, he says, were not just disinterested in reading,<br/>
but downright cynical, based on their experience in school. &quot;These<br/>
were great kids, very smart. Some went on to places like Harvard and<br/>
MIT. But they were all cynical about reading, as it was promoted at<br/>
school and by many adults in their lives,&quot; he says.<br/>
<br/>
One of the big problems, Wilhelm says, is that much of the real<br/>
reading the boys did wasn&#39;t recognized or supported by their schools<br/>
or families. &quot;Teachers and parents often conceived of reading<br/>
narrowly, as &#39;literature&#39; only, and failed to see that there&#39;s all<br/>
kinds of reading that boys do, like magazines and even formulaic<br/>
novels,&quot; he says. &quot;I tell parents and teachers to take a chill, expand<br/>
their idea of what reading is. Even expert adult readers go through<br/>
phases of reading pulp fiction or romance novels. It&#39;s something boys<br/>
outgrow, but it helps develop skills.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even graphic novels, comic books, and video game guides? &quot;Reading is<br/>
reading and the more practice kids get reading on their own, and the<br/>
more they hear books read aloud, the more skills they pick up,&quot; says<br/>
Lisa Von Drasek, head children&#39;s librarian at Bank Street College of<br/>
Education in New York City. &quot;They are hearing and seeing words,<br/>
building a vocabulary that they will recognize as they read, and that<br/>
makes reading easier. They know how words sound, what they mean and<br/>
what they look like in print. It&#39;s all part of expanding literacy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Start with What He Loves<br/>
So if you have a kid who hates books, where do you begin? All three<br/>
experts agree that it&#39;s crucial to begin at the beginning, with what<br/>
your son loves. &quot;Kids will read when you focus on what they love. If a<br/>
kid is a sports kid, I&#39;m going to do my darnedest to find a book about<br/>
a sport that kid loves,&quot; says Von Drasek. &quot;If he loves bikes, I&#39;m<br/>
going to look for books about bikes, bicycling, anything that feeds<br/>
that interest.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Try books that are about how a kid would love to be. &quot;Boys will read<br/>
themselves into a book about a character who allows them to be who<br/>
they&#39;d like to be. Even books that seem like wild fantasies are about<br/>
real stuff to the boys who are struggling with similar issues,&quot; says<br/>
Wilhelm. The wild success of the Harry Potter series is a case in<br/>
point. &quot;Even though the books are fantasy, many boys identified with<br/>
Harry because he was struggling with the day-to-day problems of every<br/>
young boy, how to make his way in the world,&quot; says Wilhelm.<br/>
<br/>
Humor is another winner with boys. &quot;Humor is underrated on school<br/>
reading lists, but boys love it,&quot; says Sciezska, whose own hit, The<br/>
Stinky Cheese Man, is a playful book that pokes fun at classic<br/>
fairytales. &quot;Calvin and Hobbes, Lemony Snicket, those books get them<br/>
excited about reading, because it&#39;s fun. It&#39;s important for parents<br/>
and teachers to accept these things as reading, instead of acting like<br/>
it&#39;s not &#39;real&#39; reading, like there&#39;s something wrong with them. Those<br/>
books will get boys hooked on reading.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Other ideas from the experts:<br/>
<br/>
    * Model reading. Studies show that when parents read and have<br/>
books around, both boys and girls are more likely to be readers.<br/>
<br/>
    * Give your boy a book. &quot;It sounds like a small thing, but it can<br/>
make a big impression. Choose one that&#39;s related to a hobby, an<br/>
interest, or is just fun,&quot; says Wilhelm.<br/>
<br/>
    * Make reading social. &quot;Invite them to talk about something out of<br/>
the newspaper,&quot; says Wilhelm. &quot;For boys, the purpose of reading is<br/>
often social, something they can use with their friends, something to<br/>
connect about, talk about.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
    * Don&#39;t give up. &quot;Sooner or later, using comics, magazines,<br/>
anything that connects to an interest or a passion, you can hook any<br/>
child on reading. It&#39;s all a matter of patience,&quot; says Von Drasek.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Indeed. Just last week, for example, I witnessed a band of boys at a<br/>
local middle school talking about a book they&#39;d just read. The<br/>
conversation was lively, heated, and engaged. The book? The latest<br/>
edition of the Halo series, the fantasy novels that describe the world<br/>
behind the video game. And from Halo, it turns out, it&#39;s not such a<br/>
giant leap to mythology, science fiction, and a long and pleasurable<br/>
reading list for many of these boys. &quot;The main thing to remember is<br/>
not to judge the reading,&quot; says Wilhelm. &quot;If boys are engaged and find<br/>
it pleasurable, it will lead to more reading.&quot;</div>
