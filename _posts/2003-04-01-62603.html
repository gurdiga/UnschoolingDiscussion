<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451251799">My step-dad was from Missouri.  He said we shouldn&#39;t drink milk with fish,<br/>
so we had lemonade or soda or water with those meals.  Sure didn&#39;t bother us<br/>
kids!  I never thought to ask him why.  He did eat clam chowder made with<br/>
milk though - that is milk and shellfish.<br/>
<br/>
We ate a lot of fish and shellfish when I was a kid, living in the Puget<br/>
Sound area.  As an adult, I lived in Alaska for 9 years and ate lots of King<br/>
crab, Dungeoness crab, salmon, and scallops, besides shrimp and halibut.<br/>
The kids there used to say, &quot;do we have to have halibut for dinner again?&quot;<br/>
Everyone in Kodiak fished or had friends that fished, so most people had<br/>
freezers full of fish (and venison too).  I also worked briefly in salmon,<br/>
crab, and shrimp canneries.<br/>
<br/>
My mil used to make salmon patties.  Leftover or canned salmon mixed with<br/>
mashed potatoes, then so much salt and pepper that it was all you could<br/>
taste.  Dh loves it when I make them, except that I tone down the salt and<br/>
pepper so you can still taste the fish.<br/>
