<div id="ygrps-yiv-515084347">***Now this I haven&#39;t heard of. I have 2 boys,<br/>
                     and I think I am pretty cool<br/>
                     with some of the things they have done. Both<br/>
                     boys when young tried<br/>
                     girl stuff like makeup, barbies, even using<br/>
                     balloons to show off a pair<br/>
                     of boobs. Glad you are dancing to your own<br/>
                     music. I know I would not<br/>
                     purchase a bra for my son at any age, nor let<br/>
                     him wear it in public.<br/>
                     No judgement bashing here from me, I just haven&#39;t<br/>
heard this one.<br/>

<br/>
I really think our lives are about our children choosing what they want,<br/>
not us choosing it for them.<br/>
<br/>
We have talked with Robin about things that might be said to him if he<br/>
wears his bra in public, but he feels as if he could handle any of it.<br/>
Mind you we support his decision to be who he is, so we are there to<br/>
help with any negative stuff he gets.<br/>
<br/>
His best friend Connor makes fun of him sometimes, for wearing the bra,<br/>
for having a Barbie, you name it - if his father said it&#39;s girl stuff,<br/>
Connor will make fun of a boy with it.  But I did see him once trying<br/>
the bra on and I have heard him ask his mom for a Barbie like Robin&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Robin feels sorry for Connor but doesn&#39;t know how to make it better for<br/>
him.  Neither do I, I only know how to make it better for my kids, who<br/>
in turn will make it better for their kids and so on.<br/>
