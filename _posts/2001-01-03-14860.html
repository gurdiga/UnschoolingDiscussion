<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014149298">Hi gang, <br/>
<br/>
We are going to be moving to MN this spring after living in<br/>
Wisconsin. <br/>
 I have researched the MN requirements and they are much stricter. <br/>
My <br/>
question is how do you unschool in MN?  What about the required <br/>
standardized testing each  year?  How do you handle the paperwork? <br/>
Do <br/>
the school districts breathe down your backs or what?  Neither my dh <br/>
nor I have our four year degrees so that creates a host of problems <br/>
although my sister does have a teachers license for MN and is willing <br/>
to &quot;keep track&quot; of us.  (What a joke...her current class is made up<br/>
of <br/>
26 students yet they want all this documentation from us). Anyway, I <br/>
would appreciate any tips you all have for making this easier.  I am <br/>
set to web only so please reply to my email.   Many, many thanks and <br/>
have a blessed day!<br/>
<br/>
Angela</div>
