<div id="ygrps-yiv-667553719">I went to look at the sleeping page to see what I had put there that was <br/>
causing so much grief.    The first bit is Nancy K. /aisliin who had done a <br/>
point-by-point to someone on the Always Learning list, and I saved it.    Maybe as a <br/>
lead article there it&#39;s a little strong. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
With anything, if a family moves from rules (about food, freedoms, clocks, <br/>
what to wear) to something new there&#39;s going to be the backlash, and thinking of <br/>
catapults (or trebuchets, more technically, or of a rubber band airplane, or <br/>
other crank-it-up projectiles...) the more pressure that&#39;s built up, the <br/>
further that kid is going to launch if you let it go all at once.   <br/>
<br/>
In the absence of pressure in the first place, there&#39;s no reaction to <br/>
resistence.   My kids didn&#39;t WANT to stay up all night, because they were used to <br/>
going to sleep happily and peacefully since before they could remember.   That <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they were used to never being &quot;put to bed&quot; in their whole lives, it <br/>
means going to bed had to do with real and variable factors, but there were <br/>
principles behind it.   Bed was about sleeping, not about control or punishment <br/>
or discipline or schedules.   Sleeping was a cool, desireable thing that <br/>
adults liked to do.    <br/>
<br/>
Some kids never see adults sleep.   They are &quot;put to bed&quot; by adults (scary <br/>
adults who turn the lights off and say &quot;STAY IN THE BED&quot; sometimes) and then <br/>
they wake up to the faces of adults who probably (to them) seem to have been <br/>
awake all the whole time.    That&#39;s one way &quot;family bed&quot; arrangements add to peace <br/>
and togetherness--the kids KNOW other people sleep, and they learn to help <br/>
the other people sleep comfortably.<br/>
<br/>
Some unschoolers are more radical than I am.   That&#39;s okay, but here&#39;s an <br/>
example of a radical Nancy K. response &lt;bwg&gt;:<br/>
<br/>
[someone once wrote:<br/>
It is not against the unschooling train of thought to insist that your <br/>
children be in their rooms by a certain time each night.]<br/>
 If Unschooling (damned insufficient word) is a lifestyle choice, NOT an <br/>
educational style, per se; then I disagree with this statement. &quot;Insisting&quot; that <br/>
the kids be banished to their rooms after a certain time, on room arrest as it <br/>
were, regardless of their wills, desires, or plans for the evening, is not <br/>
respectful of them as people. Treating kids as second class citizens and <br/>
subservient members of the family, subject to your whims, is not in sync with an <br/>
&quot;unschooling train of thought.&quot; Saying that you &quot;insist&quot; in the first place implies <br/>
that you have some leverage you are using in order to bend them to your will. <br/>
How will that be accomplished in a respectful and unschooly manner?<br/>
<br/>
-==================================<br/>
(back to Sandra:)<br/>
<br/>
I think she was respnding to &quot;insist.&quot;   But honestly, parents DO have <br/>
leverage to bend children to their will.   If children have freedom to choose, it&#39;s <br/>
because the parents GIVE them that freedom, because they have the power to <br/>
give it to them.<br/>
<br/>
For a parent to absolutely decide that he will never &quot;insist&quot; is going way to <br/>
far, I think.   Not only could it be, in some cases, illegal and neglectful, <br/>
if the parent isn&#39;t even clear on what her duties and responsibilities are as <br/>
a parent, maybe she isn&#39;t thinking clearly about other things, either.    <br/>
<br/>
If I let Kirby make the decision about something every single time, thousands <br/>
of times, still I LET him, because the state, the county, and the people <br/>
around me expect me to make that decision.   I delegated.   I can&#39;t say &quot;It&#39;s none <br/>
of my business, he can do what he wants&quot; to people outside the famly, because <br/>
it makes me look clueless and unconcerned.   <br/>
<br/>
If Keith lets me decide how to spend money and doesn&#39;t make me check with him <br/>
before I buy a DVD or some expensive groceries or clothes for the kids, <br/>
that&#39;s cool.   He lets me know when it&#39;s a really bad month to spend money.   The <br/>
fact that he doesn&#39;t check doesn&#39;t mean it would be okay for me to buy a <br/>
Bentley or to charge tickets for a cruise.    If I asked in advance about doing <br/>
that, he would insist (if he weren&#39;t insane) that I NOT do that, because we really <br/>
can&#39;t afford it.     I live my live in such a way that Keith doesn&#39;t have to <br/>
insist that I do something different.   We&#39;ve moved gradually from the point <br/>
that we consulted about $30 purchases (when we were young and not both <br/>
employed, or one or both in college) to where now he might buy a power tool and tell <br/>
me later, or I put a $300 eBay bid on a $1500 microscope without asking (I <br/>
didn&#39;t get it, but he wouldn&#39;t have freaked out if I had).<br/>
<br/>
If a child goes from a 9:00 bedtime to staying up until midnight DOING <br/>
something, that&#39;s not too bad.   If the jump is to staying up until 3:00 by any <br/>
possible means just to do it, that&#39;s not so cool.<br/>
<br/>
I need Joyce-logic summary, I think. &lt;g&gt;   Or any help making this point, <br/>
please!<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I would stay out until I &quot;had&quot; to be home.   <br/>
My kids come back when   they&#39;re through doing what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t NEED a &quot;thing&quot; to do to be away from   home.   I would just kill <br/>
time being gone.   <br/>
My kids have never felt the need to do that.   Being home isn&#39;t a bad thing <br/>
to be avoided.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the parallel that worked with food and bed and reading and all kinds <br/>
of learning, too.   But somewhere in there is the tension (good tension, not <br/>
emotional distress) that kept it all together and nobody was wound up and <br/>
launched away from the cooperative togetherness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157758066">I just found a quote from June 1997, so Kirby was 9.     Commenting that we&#39;d <br/>
been staying up late a lot, Kirby said, &quot;It&#39;s like the only time I want to go <br/>
to bed is when I&#39;m sleepy.&quot;<br/>
