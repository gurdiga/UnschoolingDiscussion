    A DAY WITHOUT WAR<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d like to suggest that you pick a day sometime soon and spend the whole <br/>
day not waging war... in your personal life. Most of us don&#39;t have our own <br/>
nuclear arsenal to destroy the enemy, nor armies to attack another country; <br/>
yet most of us do have the words and innuendo to attack or destroy someone <br/>
else; perhaps just their confidence, their peace of mind or their dreams. <br/>
And if we can&#39;t destroy, we&#39;ll settle for a momentary conquest; by <br/>
one-ups-manship, a snide joke or a pseudo-concerned comment.<br/>
<br/>
We recently heard a story about a radio DJ who calls up famous people and <br/>
in this particular instance called a man and pretended to be the <br/>
veterinarian with whom he had left his dog for a claw-clipping.  The <br/>
&quot;pretend&quot; vet told Mr. Famous he could come and pick up his pet at lunch <br/>
time... &quot;the anesthetic will have worn off by then.&quot;  Well, you probably <br/>
get it by now, the &#39;vet&#39; suggested that a bogus irreversible operation had <br/>
been performed on the prize-winning animal. Mr. Famous was emotionally <br/>
destroyed by the &quot;news&quot;, and the audience was cheering like the crowds in <br/>
the Roman Coliseum.<br/>
<br/>
On a smaller scale, how many of you recall someone destroying your <br/>
confidence?  Perhaps you recall having done that to someone else, when they <br/>
told you about their dream or new endeavor... all under the war heading of <br/>
&quot;being concerned for the other&quot; or &quot;being reasonable&quot;. &quot;I just have to tell <br/>
you this... for your own good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We may not be the Pentagon, but it seems we all have the ability to destroy <br/>
another bit by bit, emotionally and mentally.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the difference between our war of &quot;concern&quot; and the war with nuclear <br/>
warheads?  Can we ask others to stop their wars while we continue our own?<br/>
