<br/>
Debbie asks, &gt;&gt; what you told you kids when you began homeschooling?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Our son chose to go to a Montessori school when he was just 4. He returned<br/>
home from that school (across the alley) after attending about ten sessions<br/>
and said, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go there any more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We were glad because we were interested in homeschooling and really didn&#39;t<br/>
think he was learning there. We told him, &quot;Fine, you can be in charge of<br/>
your own education from now on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He smiled and said, &quot;Good, I&#39;ll do it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thus, we UNschooled from the start, once he no longer wanted school.<br/>
<br/>
From that day on, he didn&#39;t attend any school, never looked at school books,<br/>
did NO school-type lessons, had no curriculum, no school subjects, no tests<br/>
or grades, and we, his parents, did not &quot;teach&quot; him anything that he didn&#39;t<br/>
request from us. Along with being in charge of his learning, he knew that he<br/>
was in charge of his LIFE, meaning that he would make many decisions that<br/>
would affect his life.<br/>
<br/>
He enjoyed reading. I think that was true largely because we read to him<br/>
from early on and he loved the stories in children&#39;s books, and was<br/>
delighted to tell us one day that now he knew how to read. He was just 4,<br/>
and could read amazingly well.<br/>
<br/>
With control over his own life, he knew that he was trusted to make good<br/>
judgments for himself. We strongly believe that he knew that the key to<br/>
learning was reading, and he had picked up phonics without instruction.<br/>
After that, his own curiosity led him to everything he found interesting. It<br/>
also helped that he learned how to use a library when he was small. He would<br/>
go to a library ever week (at least once) and fill his large book bag and<br/>
bring it home for his reading.<br/>
<br/>
At age 18, he decided to go to college. He took the SAT and scored higher<br/>
than half of the high school valedictorians in the state of CT. He was<br/>
immediately accepted to the only college he applied for. He was never off<br/>
the dean&#39;s list and just graduated Magna Cum Laude.<br/>
<br/>
What to tell your kids...? Tell them that you know they are intelligent, and<br/>
that they can learn and/or do anything they choose. They don&#39;t need to study<br/>
any school stuff unless they want to. They can simply follow their own<br/>
curiosities and they will end up far ahead of their friends in school. Their<br/>
REAL LIFE CAN NOW BEGIN. Tell them that they own their lives -- nobody else<br/>
does.<br/>
<br/>
The record of homeschooling is proving it to be a much more broadening<br/>
method of growing than attending school. It also allows a young person to<br/>
find out how to become responsible and self-reliant, while schools only<br/>
teach them to be dependent, to wait for others to tell them what to do, and<br/>
to follow orders -- for their whole lives. ):O<br/>
<br/>
Our son took night adult classes at the high school where he learned<br/>
calligraphy, and conversational French. He went to the local craft center<br/>
for courses and had jobs at local museums that he liked a lot. He also went<br/>
to work at fourteen making jewelry, and at sixteen clerking at the video<br/>
rental store where he became assistant manager in record time. He really<br/>
liked buying his own clothes, even his own computer with his own earned<br/>
money.<br/>
<br/>
Tell your kids that they are on their own paths, but that you are (and will<br/>
always be) there to help them whenever they ask. You can also help them to<br/>
find other people to help if they want that.  Do not try to be their main<br/>
teacher. That can spoil your relationship with them, and that&#39;s the most<br/>
important thing.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; The record of homeschooling is proving it to be a much more broadening<br/>

<br/>
There are homeschoolers teaching that same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Not unschoolers, but scores (I fear it might be tens of thousands) of <br/>
fundamentalists who teach discipline above all else, and doing NOTHING that <br/>
would displease church, family, or God (in that order, from some of what I&#39;ve <br/>
read and seen).<br/>
<br/>
Not even the parents intend to be dependent or self-reliant.  Pat Farenga had <br/>
a thousand people walk out of a talk he was giving at a Christian <br/>
homeschooling conference.  There were still over a thousand left in the room, <br/>
but hundreds of people stood up and walked because Pat had said homeschooled <br/>
kids should have the right to choose whether or not to learn something, or <br/>
the right to say &quot;no, thanks,&quot; or some such statement which unschoolers find <br/>
to be in the innocuous-to-basic range.<br/>
<br/>
While I think Ned&#39;s statement above is true of unschooling, I know it to be a <br/>
stretch for a huge number of homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I loved this part best, though:  &lt;&lt;You can also help them to<br/>
find other people to help if they want that.  Do not try to be their main<br/>
teacher. That can spoil your relationship with them, and that&#39;s the most<br/>
important thing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The second or third year I was homeschooling, someone came to an online forum <br/>
*totally* effusive about homeschooling, and her ultimate hope came gushing <br/>
out:  &quot;You can be your child&#39;s only teacher!!&quot;   I got chills.   Who would <br/>
want to be another person&#39;s only teacher/helper/witness to reality?<br/>
<br/>
I bet she got over that.  But the expression of the idea that it was a <br/>
glorious prospect chilled me deeper than anything I&#39;d heard from any <br/>
homeschooler.<br/>
