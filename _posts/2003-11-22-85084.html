<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445227567">Hi all, wanted to know if anyone has any experience with sleep disturbances <br/>
in children.My ds is 8, slept in our bed since day 1, nursed till 5.5yrs, still <br/>
sleeps inour room in his own bed. We had to move him away from our bed at 6 <br/>
yrs for fear of him rolling on the new sister. He is a big boy, 5feet tall, and <br/>
I would say highly sensitive. <br/>
Sleeping has always been hard for him unless I am right there withhim.<br/>
We have been trying to get to a place where he makes the decision about when <br/>
to go to bed, but he is so scared to go by himself that he will stay up with <br/>
me until all hours, then get up early the next day and make the day awful for <br/>
all  the family.<br/>
Lately, he will go to bed, fall asleep immediately, then 10 mins later jolt <br/>
awake and call for me, crying that he can&#39;t sleep. I will tell him it&#39;s ok, he <br/>
goes back to sleep, then again, 10mins later he is awake again. He tells me he <br/>
hates this. He has thoughts of robbers, the house burning down, something <br/>
happening to me or his dad, lots of anxieties.<br/>
I am getting frustrated and angry, yet I know he is very miserable and wants <br/>
to sleep. I really need some kind words in his defense, I don&#39;t want to be <br/>
mean I want to be understanding and help him through this. <br/>
I think the anxiety thing started when I broke my arm in late July, it has <br/>
been a very long road to healing, not yet finished, and it seems as though he is <br/>
worried about me because he can see that I can be hurt. <br/>
Sorry for rambling,<br/>
TIA<br/>

<br/>
Have you tried soothing music, or a white-noise machine (to sound like water <br/>
running or rain or some such)?  It might be worth the money.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty used to have some sleeping trouble.  There was a slow tape about The <br/>
Circus which I think had been designed for drawing along to, so it went slowly.  <br/>
He would listen to that.  I doubt he ever heard it to the end, but it was <br/>
soothing and the voice was comforting.  I had a celtic music tape, with names of <br/>
songs like &quot;rain&quot; and &quot;forest&quot; and such.  Kind of nondescript new-age stuff.  <br/>
&quot;A massage tape.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can he sleep in the same room where you&#39;re working?  Some kitchens are big eno<br/>
ugh for a bed in the corner, or under the table.   Can he sleep on the floor <br/>
near you when you&#39;re on the computer, or maybe on the couch in the living room <br/>
or den?<br/>
<br/>
Each of my kids went through at least one phase of fearfulness about the <br/>
realities of the world.  They would ask more questions about death and <br/>
abandonment, and seem afraid of strangers for a while, and then they came to another <br/>
level of maturity and it was gone.<br/>
<br/>
The same way some kids fill out a while and then get tall and thinner, and <br/>
then fill out again, it seems some kids grow in understanding and emotional <br/>
abilities, and then they grow more in awareness of things outside so they&#39;re &quot;tall <br/>
and thin&quot; intellectually, and then they fill out again emotionally.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895385655">***Sleeping has always been hard for him unless I am right there with<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s really normal for kids that age to have anxiety about being<br/>
alone.   It doesn&#39;t last forever. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan didn&#39;t want to sleep alone when he was eight either.   We moved<br/>
into this house when he was seven.  The bedroom is a small, open loft<br/>
upstairs and he was still regularly sleeping with us at the time.  He<br/>
couldn&#39;t go to bed without one of us.   He thought big prehistoric birds<br/>
would come out of the walls and peck him.  <br/>
That idea stirred in him, I think, because that summer we had a Starling<br/>
wiggle through the vent and nest in our attic. We could hear her and her<br/>
chicks peeping and scrambling around. <br/>
<br/>
I think he was ten before he was really comfortable with the idea of<br/>
being asleep upstairs without someone else up there.   <br/>
<br/>
***I know he is very miserable and wants to sleep. ***<br/>
<br/>
We got one of those little kid tents, just big enough for a mat and<br/>
little nest of blankets and put it in the living room in the evening. <br/>
When he was feeling sleepy he would go in there and it was cozy and he<br/>
could watch TV until he fell asleep.   We&#39;d wake him when we went up to<br/>
bed.   Sometimes he&#39;d just sleep on the sofa until we all went upstairs,<br/>
but he did like having the little tent, and I think it helped him get<br/>
used to being alone without really being alone.  And those little tents<br/>
pop up or down so fast it doesn&#39;t have to be up in the daytime if it&#39;s in<br/>
the way. <br/>
<br/>
He can sleep anywhere these days.  He has his own bed upstairs and can be<br/>
up there, and even in the little rooms under the eves by himself, without<br/>
being afraid. <br/>
<br/>
***I don&#39;t want to be mean I want to be understanding and help him<br/>
through this.*** <br/>
<br/>
We know that! &lt;g&gt;  And he doesn&#39;t want to be afraid, or have you<br/>
frustrated with him.  He really can&#39;t help it.  Finding a place where he<br/>
feels safe and can fall asleep will make you both feel better. <br/>
<br/>
How is your arm these days?  Are you still eating plenty of medicinal<br/>
chocolate?&lt;g&gt;<br/>

Dylan loved the Jim Weiss tapes &quot;Good Night&quot; and &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;.   He<br/>
will still listen to them sometimes. <br/>
He has a Peter, Paul and Mary tape he likes to fall asleep with.   <br/>

just have to let go of my attachment to him going to bed so I can have an hour <br/>

Thanks for your post, it really was what I needed to hear to help Tommy. As <br/>
for the tent, we have one from Ikea, but he doesn&#39;t fit in it anymore!!!<br/>
We also have a loft, but he is frightened to be in it. I think the couch is a <br/>
good idea, and that is where he was when I posted. mmust learn to curb my <br/>
frustration as it is my problem not his.<br/>

Casey has had lots of anxiety problems since our move. Bedtime was <br/>
especially difficult. She likes having a fan on in her room for the <br/>
white noise. (I&#39;m still in there with her till she falls asleep.) She <br/>
also has a hot water bottle and many times sucks on a homeopathic <br/>
remedy called Moon Drops. They seem to relax her enough to allow <br/>
sleep to come. You can find them at www.historicalremedies.com.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-579970606">I&#39;m thinking massage, using calming oil (I had a great one when Janene <br/>
was little and she wouldn&#39;t sleep, which was basically every night.  It <br/>
had lots of essential oils, and was very calming for both of us.)  A <br/>
very strict bedtime ritual, with a calming bath, reading, massage, and a <br/>
relaxation excersize.   That might work?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>AHA!  <br/>
<br/>
Since we moved to a bigger house and our kids are older and stay up until the <br/>
wee (or growing larger) hours of the morning, I get up early and have HOURS <br/>
alone.   <br/>
<br/>
It does help that I&#39;ve never been much of an eight-hours-of-sleep kind of <br/>
person, and six will usually do me.   Last night I was in the bed for nine and a <br/>
half hours, not always asleep, but it was great.  And being up before six, I <br/>
can expect three to seven hours of quiet.  (My husband&#39;s home, so that&#39;s the <br/>
three, and Kirby and Marty will probably not get up until noon.)<br/>
<br/>
I know with little kids it&#39;s different.  When someone comes here and says <br/>
&quot;Help!  I have three kids under six, and....&quot; my first thought is how impossible <br/>
that must be, and how truly overwhelming, and then I remember Kirby was five <br/>
and a half when Holly was born, and think Hey!  I was overwhelmed sometimes too!<br/>
<br/>
It gets easier.   I will have three teenagers at once, but when Holly turns <br/>
13 Kirby will be 18, and that&#39;s not a difficult age range, for unschoolers.  <br/>
People warned me &quot;oooh, you&#39;ll have three teens, watch out, it will be horrible&quot; <br/>
but so far, with Holly 12 and Kirby 17, it hasn&#39;t been horrible in any way <br/>
whatsoever.  <br/>

<br/>
He is at a very common age for fears and fear of the dark.  I have a 10 yo <br/>
who still sleeps with us after going in and out of our room over the years.  We <br/>
sleep in any and all configurations in our house, but the most common one is <br/>
dh and I in the bed, son on the floor on a mat on my side of the bed.  He <br/>
frequently falls asleep with his fingers interlocked with mine.  <br/>
<br/>
He is not ashamed of this.  He doesn&#39;t care if anyone knows.  Several of his <br/>
friends sleep with their parents or their siblings.  <br/>
<br/>
My older sons always slept together--my youngest only has us to sleep with, <br/>
and so he does.  No doubt we will be very happy when he moves out of our room, <br/>
but until then, it&#39;s what he needs.<br/>

It&#39;s like reading.  Some day he&#39;ll get it.  Some day he&#39;ll want to be in his <br/>
own room every night.  Until then, make space for him in your room for when he <br/>
needs it.  <br/>
<br/>
And that startling awake thing...that happened to me last year for about 3 <br/>
months and it is HORRIBLE.  It&#39;s so frustrating to fall off into the deep and <br/>
then be wrenched back to consciousness.  I never figured out how to stop it, and <br/>
it eventually went away.  I did ask my dh and son to be considerate of what <br/>
was happening and try not to disturb me if they could.  I think it may have had <br/>
something to do with anxiety, but I can&#39;t recall anything specific I was <br/>
worried about.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

there until he no longer needs it for sure. I know it will come when he is <br/>
ready, everything else has. Just get frustrated sometimes, and worried about the <br/>
anxiety thing. It has helped to read posts from other people with similar <br/>
experiences.<br/>
He does not feel the least bit self concious about sleeping in our room, and <br/>
both him and our 2yr old call it &quot;our bedroom&quot;. It  is comforting to know <br/>
where they are, as I also have some anxiety about fires and finding children. I <br/>
still run the monitor on the rare nights that I get both kids sleeping in the <br/>
bed and can sneak down to use the computer, like tonight!!!!!!<br/>
Thanks again  <br/>
