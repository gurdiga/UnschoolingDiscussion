<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660893357">We are just able to get back online having been without power since Floyd<br/>
came through. Last week, we had a tremendous thunderstorm that fried our<br/>
voice mail/fax system. It was about 5 years old and it would cost 10 times<br/>
as much as the original cost to replace it with something similar, so we<br/>
opted to go with a regular answering machine and a fax machine as<br/>
replacements. Our computers were all fine since they each have battery<br/>
backup/surge protectors.<br/>
<br/>
Then Floyd came through and knocked out our power and knocked down three<br/>
pine trees (two were over 70 feet tall) in our backyard. One came close to<br/>
our house! With no electricity, the sump pump stopped running, and with 10<br/>
inches of rain coming down, we were hoping the power would come back soon.<br/>
No such luck. After about an hour, it was obvious the basement would flood.<br/>
The kids pitched in and worked like champs to move the most important books<br/>
and papers to higher ground, but we soon had 5,000 gallons of water in the<br/>
basement (even in a crisis you can find time to learn about calculating<br/>
volume).<br/>
<br/>
I went out to a boating supply store and got a bilge pump (runs off 12<br/>
volts) and rigged it up to our car battery to start pumping out the<br/>
basement. It was rated at 750 gallons per hour, but having to take the water<br/>
up 5 feet to a hose through the basement window dropped the rating to about<br/>
400 gph. That meant it would take about 12 hours to pump out the basement.<br/>
Radio reports indicated that power might be out until Tuesday! We had worked<br/>
into the early morning, and just as we were about to go to bed, the power<br/>
came back on! The regular sump pump soon got rid of the deepest water, and I<br/>
used a shop vac to start getting rid of the rest. We were down to no<br/>
standing water and just saturated carpeting. We took time to put together a<br/>
couple of orders that we had promised would be shipped out that day, and<br/>
just as we printed the last label, the power went out again. UPS requires<br/>
computer generated labels, so we can&#39;t ship UPS orders without electricity.<br/>
<br/>
I was worried that after working so hard to get rid of the standing water<br/>
that the basement was going to flood again. I hooked my jury rigged bilge<br/>
pump up again and since it was no longer raining (it was actually pleasantly<br/>
cool and sunny) the bilge pump was easily able to keep up with the water<br/>
coming into the sump well from the saturated ground. We were very happy to<br/>
get up this morning and find that the power was back on. I&#39;m hoping it will<br/>
stay on now!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re sore from bailing water and hauling wet stuff out of the basement.<br/>
I&#39;ll be making several trips to the dump this weekend. We also discovered<br/>
that unlike our old voice mail/fax system, the new setup did not retain<br/>
messages when the power went out. I&#39;ve since replaced the answering machine<br/>
with one that does.<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
If anyone left an order on our answering machine in the last few days,<br/>
please call or e-mail us to confirm that we got it. If you called and didn&#39;t<br/>
get through at all, please try again.<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
We will probably be too busy the next few days to check in with the list, so<br/>
that&#39;s why I&#39;m taking time now to post this long update (not to mention that<br/>
it helps delay loading up the van for the first trip to the dump). We&#39;re<br/>
considering this our trial run for a worst case scenario of any Y2K<br/>
problems!<br/>
<br/>
We are safe and sound and hope all other list members were unaffected by<br/>
Floyd.<br/>
