<div id="ygrps-yiv-34628344">**&quot;When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to<br/>
 everything else in the universe.&quot;<br/>
 ~John Muir~**<br/>
<br/>
Oohh,  aahh,  great quote!<br/>
<br/>
Making connections,  again!    The unschooling life.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kelli~  going to go read about John Muir<br/>
<br/>
PS.  If anyone is wondering what I&#39;m talking about,  both Sandra and Anne O<br/>
had talks in SC on  Making Connections through our lives.  Finding that<br/>
everything is hitched to everything else.   :)    It was very cool.</div>
