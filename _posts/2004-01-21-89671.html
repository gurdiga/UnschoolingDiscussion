<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381072548">Okay,  I know I am new to this group. I have posted a few things <br/>
here.  I have spent the last week reading through archives, so I <br/>
could get a better feel for this group. At first, I had a knee jerk <br/>
reaction to an answer Sandra gave someone and sent a shocked response <br/>
to her not, thankfully Deb L. caught it.  (Thanks) I wasn&#39;t the one <br/>
who posted &quot;the&quot; attack email to Sandra that she has recently written about. Like everyone said, this is <br/>
a place that you don&#39;t want to throw something out there unless you <br/>
are prepared to see it challenged.  So here goes.  The following <br/>
comes from my husband.  We were having a really nice conversation on <br/>
unschooling vs.relaxed homeschooling. He threw out an interesting <br/>
comment/question. I can&#39;t wait to hear what everyone has to say (his remarks are<br/>
in blue.)<br/>
               <br/>
He said,**** &quot;Has anyone ever unschooled their kids and because their <br/>
kids were lazy, or totally disinterested in things they might need to <br/>
know to make an actual living, or unschooling failed those kids?&quot; Is <br/>
it really wrong to have any expectations of one&#39;s kids. And I am not <br/>
talking about making a living one person wants to live on.  What if <br/>
our kids want to get married and have kids, and wants them to be <br/>
homeschooled/unschooled and they can&#39;t make the money to that.  <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t we have failed our kids? Isn&#39;t there a list out there called <br/>
Unschooling Disaster Stories?&quot;  Not everything works for everybody.&quot;<br/>
Then he went on to say, &quot;You know that I love our kids as much as you <br/>
do. They are our children.  It&#39;s makes me sad that you are so <br/>
disappointed in me not just agreeing with you.  I can see your point <br/>
and where you are coming from, but I just don&#39;t know if I buy the <br/>
whole unschooling thing like you do. How do we raise &#39;our&#39; children <br/>
being far apart on such an integral issue? I know you love me, and I <br/>
love you, but you seem more disappointed that I don&#39;t agree with you, <br/>
and I am not disappointed that you don&#39;t agree with me.&quot;*******<br/>
  <br/>
Some of my responses were to tell him that I thought having expectations that our kids pursue what they love and will find those things out when ready are good expectations. That if our kids made a commitment to some kind of activity and wanted to stop, not because they didn&#39;t like it anymore, but because it was becoming harder or more challenging, that it might be a good thing to expect them to really give it some thought before totally giving up (not that that would stop them from giving up anyway).  I remember thinking back in my 20s  how I wished my parents had pushed me to stay with the Cello. (I give up on alot of stuff of my own admittance) because I might be a great player. But upon thinking about it,  I realized that &quot;might&quot; be a great cellist,isn&#39;t a good enough reason for my parents pushing me.  Clearly, I had other things on my mind. I did tell him that once I read on a local homeschooling list about a mom who&#39;s unschooled son really wanted to go to a certain college, or<br/>
 get into a certain collegiate program (??), and couldn&#39;t get in because his math abilities were atrocious. The mom was questioning that maybe she should have &quot;taught&quot;him stuff. Her kid was blaming her for his limited ability. He actually told her it was her fault he didn&#39;t know what he should. I said that our kids education has to belong to them. My husband said, &quot;How do they know now, what we have only figured out recently, the kinds of thing one needs to know so that having the life you want is easier to live? Don&#39;t parents&#39; experiences count for something when raising their kids. How can someone who is 4 or 7 even understand that their education belongs to them, aren&#39;t we supposed to be here to help them? Is raising kids just about giving them food, shelter and love, the rest is just up to them.  Wouldn&#39;t that feel scary to a kid that it is up to them?&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
Ok, so there you have it. There was more, alot more that we both said. But this was the most important stuff he spoke about.  My husband is a thoughtful,caring, very intelligent guy. He can keep his calm and I am the passionate zealot. BUT, I was really calm and chilled out during this talk ( a good thing). <br/>
Anyway, I would really love to hear what the more experienced unschoolers out there have to say about this. Please don&#39;t write my husband off as some ignorant, intolerant, control freak. That isn&#39;t what this is about. It is about a true curiosity and genuine concern for his kids&#39; futures.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Rachel<br/>

&gt; futures.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there is so much in your email ... i really think he (and also you) <br/>
should look through the archives because his questions are not new. my <br/>
question to him is simple --are you so worried about the future that <br/>
you are losing focus on the present?<br/>
<br/>
the example of the mom and math is particularly interesting: if she had <br/>
been focused on what was important for her son NOW, they probably would <br/>
have been able to work out a way for him to use a prep program or get <br/>
tutoring in order for him to achieve his goal NOW. what you described <br/>
was a dysfunctional relationship that could easily be substituted with <br/>
any other kind of dysfunctional relationship. by your description they <br/>
were caught in the drama of the future math problems and turned the <br/>
situation into a blame game, to cover for each other&#39;s insecurities. <br/>
i&#39;ve seen that many times played out, it is not an un/homeschooling <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
but then, to go back to the beginning of the post, when i read this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Has anyone ever unschooled their kids and because their<br/>
&gt; kids were lazy, or totally disinterested in things they might need to<br/>
&gt; know to make an actual living, or unschooling failed those kids?&quot; Is<br/>
&gt; it really wrong to have any expectations of one&#39;s kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i immediately want to ask, how do you define:<br/>
<br/>
1. Lazy<br/>
2. Desinterest<br/>
3. Things you might need to know<br/>
4. Actual Living<br/>
5. Failure<br/>
<br/>
and the biggies,<br/>
<br/>
6. Right<br/>
7. Wrong<br/>
<br/>
i am basically giving him keywords to use throughout the archives. very <br/>
interesting posts will pop-out for him. I am sure that Sandra has <br/>
timely articles on her website as well. another word to look for is:<br/>
<br/>
8. Semantics<br/>
<br/>
it has been discussed many times in this here list the importance of <br/>
semantics. that there is a difference between saying &quot;kids learn&quot; vs. <br/>
&quot;kids teach themselves&quot; or the difference between &quot;learning&quot; and <br/>
&quot;education&quot;. take away right and wrong from the previous keywords list, <br/>
and we may not be talking about the same thing when using the 5 first <br/>
items. i have an idea what it means to you, but defining these terms by <br/>
yourself and clarifying what they mean to you intellectually and, most <br/>
importantly, emotionally may be what makes you look at unschooling as <br/>
something you &#39;can&#39;t buy&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
which, in effect, *we all can&#39;t buy* because it is not something to <br/>
buy, it is a process, a life compass.<br/>
<br/>
further down the post, i read this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do they know now, what we have only figured out recently, the <br/>
&gt; kinds of thing one needs to know so that having the life you want is <br/>
&gt; easier to live?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my first reaction to this is, how lucky he is that he has figured out <br/>
how to live life. i do not say this lightly or in an off-putting way. i <br/>
wish i could live with that certainty --i do not. but i was the kind of <br/>
child that wanted to grow up to be like leonardo divinci, learning all <br/>
the time. so, i am truly marveled when i hear people say that they&#39;ve <br/>
figured life out. it&#39;s too big a thing for me to process <br/>
intellectually, needless to say emotionally.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Don&#39;t parents&#39; experiences count for something when raising their kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of course they do. unschooling is not neglect, benign or otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How can someone who is 4 or 7 even understand that their education <br/>
&gt; belongs to them,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but they don&#39;t. i don&#39;t even think that word, education, is in either <br/>
of my son&#39;s vocabularies and they will happen to be 4 and 7 this year. <br/>
as they like to quote from the &#39;Tony Hawk Gigantic Tour&#39; videos: I&#39;m <br/>
just here to be (imagine an almost 4 year old with an Elmer Fudd lisp <br/>
saying that. It&#39;s really funny).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; aren&#39;t we supposed to be here to help them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ABSOLUTELY! Another search word for y&#39;all:<br/>
<br/>
9. Strewing<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is raising kids just about giving them food, shelter and love, the <br/>
&gt; rest is just up to them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>search the archives using the aforementioned keyword and you&#39;ll read <br/>
what i mean :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Wouldn&#39;t that feel scary to a kid that it is up to them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to live freely? to be freely?<br/>
<br/>
10. Freedom<br/>
<br/>
and read Sandra&#39;s recent post, &quot;How  much freedom&quot;. A true keeper.<br/>
<br/>
best,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup!  That was one of my questions to him too! He says he sees more <br/>
of a balance than me. I see mostly the present, and he sees mostly <br/>
the &quot;what ifs&quot; of the future. I&#39;ll admit he does have a hard time <br/>
staying in the present. In his own life he looks to the future alot. <br/>
Hell, after my mom died of cancer that took her in 5 months at the <br/>
age of 53 (3 years ago) I don&#39;t always bank on a future. Not that I <br/>
am saying one should live their lives like none of the decisions they <br/>
make today won&#39;t have consequeces, but I think it&#39;s wise to stay <br/>
mostly in the present because it is all we have.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; interesting posts will pop-out for him. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for these.  I have been reading through the archives thinking <br/>
of things I would like to read about, but never thought of the above <br/>
for possibly helping my dh.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 9. Strewing<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know all about strewing (not to be smug). I have been reading <br/>
things by Sandra since I first read something by her in HEM years <br/>
ago. (Even though she and I are different in many ways, we had <br/>
similar formative re: parenting influences: LLL, Mothering, GWS,HEM <br/>
magazines, read alot of John Holt etc). I think I am good at <br/>
strewing. I don&#39;t know how interested my kids are in anything I <br/>
have &quot;strewed&quot;. That&#39;s their deal. I do try to have things around and <br/>
talk about things that are interesting to me and that they might <br/>
like.  A cool thing I just did was to buy bird seed.I haven&#39;t done <br/>
that before. Never thought about it. I did it mostly because I get a <br/>
kick out of squirrels. But, lo and behold, no squirrels showed up, <br/>
but lots of birds did.  Andrew and I have been fascinated by all of <br/>
them and watching how different types of birds have different <br/>
personalities.  So that has been really fun. But nothing I &quot;strew&quot; <br/>
right now is more interesting than gamecube, music, movies and <br/>
strongbad. &lt;g&gt; I am totally fine with that.  Dearest hubby is having <br/>
more of a problem (obviously).:-) <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Wouldn&#39;t that feel scary to a kid that it is up to them?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to live freely? to be freely?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nah, I don&#39;t think that was were he was going, meaning being free, I <br/>
think he was talking about feel like those big people that brought <br/>
them into the world weren&#39;t going to leave them alone to figure it <br/>
out.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; and read Sandra&#39;s recent post, &quot;How  much freedom&quot;. A true keeper.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought the above post was awesome. I am going to send it to my <br/>
husband, along with yours. Hopefully it will give him more insight to <br/>
this thing we call unschooling.  However, since I really prefer <br/>
unschooling my kids, that also extends to my hunny. If he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to learn more about unschooling, there is not a whole lot I can <br/>
do. Or he could read thru the archives and still feel and believe the <br/>
way he does about education. Oh well. Diversity is what makes the <br/>
world more interesting, so I&#39;ll just have to deal with chips where <br/>
they fall. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You know that I love our kids as much as you <br/>

&gt; and I am not disappointed that you don&#39;t agree with me.&quot;*******<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is a great start, you don&#39;t say how long you have been <br/>
hsing/unschooling or how old your kids are or if they were formally in school, all of <br/>
that makes a difference IMHO. From what you write here I don&#39;t hear your DH <br/>
saying &quot;no way, not with my kids&quot;. He sounds like he is open to the idea but <br/>
needs more information and maybe just time. My DH and I had some of the same <br/>
problems you are experiencing but we kept on talking and learning and living and <br/>
the kids kept coming along and interacting with him so that eventually he was <br/>
able to see it too.<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to add that I have seen schools create totally <br/>
disinterested kids, I don&#39;t know if I would call them lazy, the schools probably would as <br/>
might their parents but I saw kids who had just shut down, tuned out so to <br/>
speak. There are no guarantees in life.<br/>
<br/>
&lt; That if our kids made a commitment to some kind of activity and wanted to <br/>
stop, not because they didn&#39;t like it anymore, but because it was becoming <br/>
harder or more challenging, that it might be a good thing to expect them to really <br/>
give it some thought before totally giving up (not that that would stop them <br/>
from giving up anyway).&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids start and stop things but I do not so much think it is because it <br/>
became too hard. What I do find is that as we travel farther along this path my <br/>
kids and myself have become so much more in tune with ourselves that we know <br/>
very fast if something we try is a fit or not. I don&#39;t make my kids continue <br/>
with something they are sure they don&#39;t want to do. They have made a decision <br/>
though to stick with something like a sports team who they knew counted on them <br/>
to be there, but they made the choice I did not force it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I remember thinking back in my 20s  how I wished my parents had pushed me to <br/>
stay with the Cello.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just have never had success making anyone do anything, even before we found <br/>
this lifestyle. All of my kids have been incredibly independent, they have <br/>
been my best teachers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt; My husband said, &quot;How do they know now, what we have only figured out <br/>
recently, the kinds of thing one needs to know so that having the life you want is <br/>
easier to live? Don&#39;t parents&#39; experiences count for something when raising <br/>
their kids. How can someone who is 4 or 7 even understand that their education <br/>
belongs to them, aren&#39;t we supposed to be here to help them? Is raising kids <br/>
just about giving them food, shelter and love, the rest is just up to them.  <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t that feel scary to a kid that it is up to them?&quot; &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think parents experience do count, you are going to need it as you go <br/>
along. My experience is what tells me that this lifestyle is the right one for <br/>
my family because I have also lived the other lifestyle, the school lifestyle <br/>
and saw firsthand what an ill fit that was for the whole family. I can&#39;t go <br/>
back and redo the past but I can learn from it.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t think it is a 4 and 7yro&#39;s responsibility to understand <br/>
that their education belongs to them, they will in time as they grow up, my <br/>
16yro understands it however not so much in those terms. We only started hsing 5 <br/>
years ago, so he was around 11 when we pulled him out of school. In those 5 <br/>
short years we have managed to cross the bridge from a public schooled child to a <br/>
self confident young man who understands far more than I had ever dreamt he <br/>
would at this age. We did it a day at a time, talking, laughing, fighting, <br/>
crying and even a few shouting matches which we have not had for ages I&#39;m glad to <br/>
say. We worked through so many things along the way and the whole family has <br/>
grown, not just the kids.<br/>
<br/>
When you ask if the kids are scared about the rest being up to them I wonder <br/>
if you are thinking that you are just going to shove a 7yro out into the <br/>
world, why on earth would anyone do that? There are a lot of years to explore life <br/>
safely within the family between the age of 7 and adulthood. I am not even <br/>
shoving my 16yro out I am helping him to find ways to test out the larger world <br/>
while still knowing my hand is there to grab when he needs it and even at 16 <br/>
they still need it now and then. He does come to me for guidance, for <br/>
reassurance, trusting me to be here and I am.<br/>
<br/>
I do however encourage him to try new things, to stretch and grow, to taste <br/>
life so that he can eventually have the confidence he needs to be his own <br/>
person. I want him to always want us around and to always love us but I want him to <br/>
be self sufficient because I think that is healthy. I love seeing that in my <br/>
21yro son, he is so powerful now, school was not kind to him but he has <br/>
overcome it and it is exciting to see.<br/>
<br/>
Could it be that it all boils down to trust? We have to trust ourselves first <br/>
to do the right thing and then we can trust that our kids will find the way.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I used to have this thought about the violin lessons I used to take. But really, I was fantasizing. If I looked back at violin honestly I can see that hated the commitment and practice though I loved the instrument. By letting me quit and not pushing me my parents let me keep that love. If they had pushed I very likely would have grown to resent it NOT become the proffessional violinest I used to imagine I might have been. People like to engage in the good fantasies of &#39;what might have been&#39; all the while forgetting what really was.<br/>
      I, and the person that made that comment, now have an instrument we love and a base of familiarity should we ever choose to go back and learn more. Had we been pushed, it might have been ruined for us forever.<br/>

Is your husband willing to read?  Is he willing to do<br/>
the research necessary?  If so, then start handing him<br/>
books, like: <br/>

  ===========================================================<br/>
<br/>
Well, my kids (dd6, dd5 and ds 3.5) have never been to school so they really have no idea that their education could *not* belong to them. I think that&#39;s part of why Emily was so incredibly indignant about President Bush&#39;s No Child Left Behind. <br/>

If children grow up with unschooling, then they never have the baggage to overcome from a formal school experience that might teach them that they couldn&#39;t do something they set out to do. I think they would have an incredible advantage just by starting out this young. They will be empowered from the very beginning, able to meet the challenges they set for themselves.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Part of the problem of seeing something new that seems to be open to<br/>
potential disaster is that we assume that the people doing it either aren&#39;t<br/>
nervous about the potential disaster beacuse their either 1) don&#39;t care<br/>
about their kids as much or 2) because there&#39;s something wrong with their<br/>
brains that they can&#39;t see something that&#39;s so obvious.<br/>
<br/>
The fears your husband experesses are perfectly normal. Unschoolers have<br/>
worked through the worst of those fears and most have periodic panic<br/>
attacks.<br/>
<br/>
The fears can&#39;t be logicked away. The fears make sense from a schooled point<br/>
of view. What helps is knowledge and<br/>
<br/>
What confident unschoolers have is a greater knowledge of the results of<br/>
unschooling, an understanding of the other benefits of unschooling, an<br/>
understanding of how and why people learn and the pros and cons of coerced<br/>
learning vs learning from interests.<br/>
<br/>
Every choice in life has good aspects and bad. Choosing involves picking<br/>
something where the good outweighs the bad.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s helpful to read about the success stories. But, of course, schools have<br/>
success stories too, so the stories aren&#39;t a reason to choose unschooling. I<br/>
think rather than reading them as stories that unschooling does work,<br/>
they&#39;re better read as stories of *how* learning through interests works.<br/>
It&#39;s not significant that Sandra&#39;s Kirby has been working at the game shop<br/>
for several years and been given a lot of responsibility at only 16. What&#39;s<br/>
significant in terms of unschooling is that it grew out of his passion in<br/>
playing games being supported and taken seriously.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also helpful to realize the goals of unschooling are different than<br/>
other ways of schooling and homeschooling. The goal is helping the child be<br/>
who he is right now and help him grow into who he will become. The goal of<br/>
schooling is to get a child to some specific place that it&#39;s assumed<br/>
<br/>
That goal can be hard to embrace. For one thing it makes it seem like<br/>
unschoolers don&#39;t care where kids end up. But what it is is trust in the<br/>
process that interests are the best foundation for life&#39;s pursuits. being<br/>
able to pursue what we enjoy is what makes us jump out of bed in the<br/>
morning. It&#39;s what makes us willing to put up with things we don&#39;t like<br/>
because we know we&#39;ll get to do something we really, really like.<br/>
<br/>
And trust in the kids themselves that they are whole people who want to *do*<br/>
things in life, not just have life happen to them. (Even -- maybe espcially<br/>
-- when what they may be doing looks like that&#39;s all they care about! That&#39;s<br/>
when we need to look further and find out what&#39;s really going on rather than<br/>
what it looks like on the surface that&#39;s going on.) And trust in biology<br/>
that we&#39;re wired to leave home and go out on our own. Biology is what drives<br/>
male lions away from the pride they were born in even though it would be<br/>
easier for them to stay.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s helpful to think about why schooling works and why it doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
School *does* turn out decent kids who go on to get jobs and not be burdens<br/>
on society. People may want it to do more or something else, but that&#39;s<br/>
bascially what it was designed for.<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes school fails. Sometimes it works okay.<br/>
<br/>
If coerced learning works sometimes and fails others, then it isn&#39;t the<br/>
coerced learning that&#39;s working. There are other factors that allow coerced<br/>
learning to work. And, unfortunately, those factors aren&#39;t controllable. It<br/>
has to do with personality, home environment, school environment, learning<br/>
style and so on and so on. If someone has the right combination of factors<br/>
-- they have a learning style that matches school, they have interests that<br/>
match what&#39;s being taught, they have a personality that can conform to being<br/>
told what to learn and how to go about learning it -- then coerced learning<br/>
will &quot;work&quot; (that is have the results school is designed to have.)<br/>
<br/>
The beauty of unschooling is that it is independent of many of the factors<br/>
coerced learning depends on. Unschooling adapts to the child and his needs,<br/>
rather than the child having to adapt to the needs of school and the needs<br/>
of the agenda the adults have for him.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing unschoolind depends on is how well a parent can respect a<br/>
child&#39;s interests (not just the interests that look like they&#39;re leading the<br/>
future or look like something they&#39;d do in school) and strew and nurture and<br/>
support and model. (And that&#39;s part of what the list is for :-)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s lots more to say on that, but it&#39;s a beginning anyway!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That if our kids made a commitment to some kind of activity and wanted to<br/>
&gt; stop, not because they didn&#39;t like it anymore, but because it was becoming<br/>
&gt; harder or more challenging, that it might be a good thing to expect them to<br/>
&gt; really give it some thought before totally giving up (not that that would stop<br/>
&gt; them from giving up anyway).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The subject of what to do about &quot;commitments&quot; has come up *lots*! Commitment<br/>
might be a good keyword.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s helpful to talk with a child about why they want to quit because it<br/>
might be something that can be fixed that the child does&#39;t realize can be<br/>
fixed.<br/>

That&#39;s true, but isn&#39;t it funny how easily some people can ignore the number of &quot;failures&quot; that school turns out, but won&#39;t hesitate to question a different way of learning?  I still think that a lot of success stories coming from school achieved what they did in spite of school, not because of it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Isn&#39;t there a list out there called <br/>
Unschooling Disaster Stories?&quot;  Not everything works for everybody.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nobody claimed anything would work for everybody.<br/>
<br/>
Any family that believes school is the way for their kids to be guaranteed a <br/>
good future would be irresponsible not to keep their families in school.<br/>
<br/>
I have no personal interest in getting more or lots of people to unschool.<br/>
My interest is in helping those who already want to do it do it well and <br/>
confidently.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I remember thinking back in my 20s  how I wished my parents had pushed me <br/>
to stay with the Cello. (I give up on alot of stuff of my own admittance) <br/>
because I might be a great player. But upon thinking about it,  I realized that <br/>
&quot;might&quot; be a great cellist,isn&#39;t a good enough reason for my parents pushing <br/>
me.  Clearly, I had other things on my mind. -=-<br/>
<br/>
What is being a great cellist good for, though?  If you had loved cello and <br/>
it had come easily and you woke up thinking &quot;cello&quot; you&#39;d probably still be <br/>
doing it.   And do you play now?  <br/>
<br/>
-=-Don&#39;t parents&#39; experiences count for something when raising their kids. <br/>
How can someone who is 4 or 7 even understand that their education belongs to <br/>
them, aren&#39;t we supposed to be here to help them? Is raising kids just about <br/>
giving them food, shelter and love, the rest is just up to them. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This seems foreign to me personally.  I have never once agreed with people <br/>
who said &quot;their education belongs to them.&quot;  I don&#39;t even like the word <br/>
&quot;education,&quot; because it, like teaching, is something imposed from the outside.   I <br/>
don&#39;t think a person&#39;s learning belongs to him either, in the sense that they <br/>
should figure out on their own what they want.   I don&#39;t like it when parents say <br/>
&quot;When he tells me what he wants to learn, I help him learn it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
None of those things came from me.  I&#39;ve seen them too, but I don&#39;t like them <br/>
much.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids&#39; learning comes from where my learning comes from.  Something is <br/>
happening and anyone there throws out whatever comments or knowledge or jokes or <br/>
questions he has, and together we examine or admire or analyze or play with or <br/>
somehow note, and then each of us processes some of that information, probably <br/>
forgets some of it, ties it in with whatever each of us knows or cares about <br/>
(all that&#39;s internal brain-stuff, memory and thought), and the next time <br/>
there&#39;s something to connect to it, we all connect some more thoughts, maybe just <br/>
internally, maybe with a reference back to the other thing, maybe by physically <br/>
holding those two things together, or saying &quot;Just like that other one,&quot; or <br/>
whatever it is.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve rented A Knight&#39;s Tale.   That will be a Chaucer tie-in for life, for <br/>
me who&#39;s read a fair amount of Chaucer, and for my kids who&#39;ve read none, but <br/>
I&#39;ve read parts of The Miller&#39;s Tale to them (the &quot;Alysoun anon let flee a <br/>
fart&quot; passage) and told them some more.  It doesn&#39;t matter to me whether they <br/>
pursue Chaucer or not.  They now have a hook to hang it on.   <br/>
<br/>
There are similarities between A Knight&#39;s Tale and The Mighty Ducks, most <br/>
obvious being &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; by Queen, but there are others.   Holly and I <br/>
just watched Labyrinth; A Knight&#39;s Tale has a David Bowie song too.   I have a <br/>
letter from David Bowie, from 1967.  Connect the dots.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Wouldn&#39;t that feel scary to a kid that it is up to them?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think so, but it&#39;s not happened in our house.  When I hear people tell <br/>
their children, young or teens &quot;It&#39;s up to you&quot; I cringe.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;My husband is a thoughtful,caring, very intelligent guy. He can keep his <br/>
calm and I am the passionate zealot. BUT, I was really calm and chilled out <br/>
during this talk ( a good thing). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounded like it!   I was impressed at the comments, but disappointed in the <br/>
descriptions of unschooling.   Too cold and lacking the business of a rich life.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Please don&#39;t write my husband off as some ignorant, intolerant, control <br/>
freak. That isn&#39;t what this is about. It is about a true curiosity and genuine <br/>
concern for his kids&#39; futures.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I&#39;ve seen ignorant control freaks, and your husband by your account <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem at all like either.<br/>

Maybe it would help your husband for him to take them out and about.  Maybe <br/>
an overnight trip to a city with museums and historical sites.  He could go <br/>
touristing, even if it&#39;s only a couple of hundred miles away.  They could get a <br/>
motel room, or could camp.   And just being with them as they see and talk and <br/>
learn might turn the mental tide for him.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  However, since I really prefer <br/>
<br/>
unschooling my kids, that also extends to my hunny. If he doesn&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
want to learn more about unschooling, there is not a whole lot I can <br/>
<br/>
do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t have his whole life to learn about it if he wants to.   <br/>
If he&#39;s thinking school or schoolwork is the answer, or if you&#39;re thinking of <br/>
risking the peace of your marriage to unschool without his approval or <br/>
cooperation, that&#39;s not balanced.<br/>
<br/>
Your duty to provide your children a safe place could easily extend to <br/>
running off crazy people from the front door, and helping your husband see NOW <br/>
what&#39;s happening, not later when they&#39;re grown.<br/>
<br/>
Some things need to be done when they need to be done.  Kirby really DOES <br/>
need to put gasoline in the van sometimes.  Waiting to run out and having to be <br/>
rescued isn&#39;t unschooling, it&#39;s the dangerous inconveniencing of himself and <br/>
others.   If Keith decided he didn&#39;t want to change the oil in any of our <br/>
vehicles (well if he decided that, I would do it) and would just see whether it&#39;s <br/>
true that the engine will blow, that could, I suppose, be considered <br/>
unschooling, but it&#39;s also massively stupid and irresponsible.<br/>
<br/>
If we decided to see what would really happen if we didn&#39;t make phone <br/>
payments, or power payments or mortgage payments, yes the kids would learn something <br/>
but what they would learn was that we had left them in a cold house that was <br/>
about to be repossessed.  (At least the creditors couldn&#39;t call, once the phone <br/>
was gone.)<br/>
<br/>
We need to model what needs to be done, and if unschooling is really going to <br/>
blossom, it needs everyone involved to understand it well enough to help it <br/>
out, or at least not to thwart its progress.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have 3 kids, at present (I was kinda hopin&#39; for just one more <br/>
someday...I&#39;m addicted). Andrew 14.  Andrew went to school for all of <br/>
kindergarten and 6 weeks of 1st grade.  He LOVED kindegarten (I did <br/>
not want him to go, I had been reading Nancy Wallace, GWS, John Holt, <br/>
a book called Deschooling our Lives, starting around the time Andrew <br/>
was 3. Anyway, he hated 1st grade and I just told my husband that he <br/>
got to have Andrew in school for Kindergarten and now it was my turn <br/>
to have him home.<br/>
<br/>
 We used Calvert for 3 months until I thought we would blow our heads <br/>
off! Then we pretty much unschooled from then til 6th grade, with <br/>
occaisional what I like to call &quot;unschoolers academic panic attacks&quot; <br/>
which lasted maybe a week and then we off doing our own thing.  <br/>
<br/>
Then when Andrew was in 6th grade my husband was not happy about <br/>
unschooling and wanted a curriculum. So we did Oak Meadow and have <br/>
been doing that since this past December &#39;03. We did it in a very <br/>
relaxed way. I didn&#39;t check it, let Andrew decide what he was going <br/>
to do and when.  But my dh still checked up on him and put a little <br/>
pressure on him here and there. It pissed me off, and I am not the <br/>
silent type.:-)  Andrew is an amazingly compliant kid. I wish he <br/>
would fight more for what he wanted or be a pain in the butt so my dh <br/>
we see there was no other way but to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, Andrew is unschooling totally, however, he is thinking he wants <br/>
to try high school and I talked with him and told him that there are <br/>
only 2 things he&#39;d really have to know how to do, which he doesn&#39;t <br/>
now, and that would be to write an essay and to have decent grasp of <br/>
pre-algebra (as I have found out about what the school requires..we <br/>
live in the northern suburbs of Atlanta, GA approx 35 minutes from <br/>
the city). So he told me he would like me to help him to be able to <br/>
do that stuff. (Personally, I am desperately hoping he changes his <br/>
mind...ugh!...I hate school and I was good at it, but I just can&#39;t <br/>
stand it)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, Ben is 7.  He has mild autistic spectrum disorder. I was the <br/>
one who wrote the desperate email &quot;Please somebody H-E-L-P&quot; <br/>
recently.  I got so many tremendous responses that really helped me <br/>
get to my center. Things I know are true. Like how great Ben is and <br/>
not to look at the problems he has (and they are legit) but to look <br/>
at what wonderful things there are about him and what a loving kid he <br/>
is. He is better off at home. Ben had 5 weeks of special ed public <br/>
school. It was a bloody nightmare! Since that time he has had a <br/>
totally school-phobic reaction to even the word school. SO how could <br/>
I put him back there? Prior to school he had been unschooled. Since <br/>
then he has been unschooled.  We have helped him learn to count to 15 <br/>
(which took almost 2 years) and learn most of the alphabet things he <br/>
wanted but which do not come easy for him. Not in a schooly way, just <br/>
in the context of life way.<br/>
<br/>
Autumn, God Bless her, has always been unschooled. She will be 4 in <br/>
Feb. She asks to go to school sometimes and I took her to a nursery <br/>
school to see what it was like and she wanted to stay. :-) She is <br/>
super social and just wants to play with all the kids. She has a good <br/>
friend, Daniel, who is 5 and goes to prek (PreK is free in GA as it <br/>
is paid for by the lottery). He has fun and talks about it.  She <br/>
wants to go.  She could go in the fall but I don&#39;t know. I would miss <br/>
her too much. If you opt for the free PreK the kids have to be there <br/>
all day like Kindergarten.  Isn&#39;t that insane? Hopefully, she&#39;ll <br/>
forget about it. I could pay to let her go just part time though, but <br/>
frankly I have better things to do with my money.<br/>
<br/>
I want to comment that my husband and I were talking recently on what <br/>
a fabulous, loving, funny, compassionate, respectful,gentle, positive <br/>
young man Andrew has turned into. I love all of my kids,so it&#39;s not <br/>
that I love Andrew more, it&#39;s that he is the only one that is now <br/>
taller than me and is moving into adulthood. We are starting to see <br/>
the kind of man he is becoming. :-) So, my dh and I were commenting <br/>
on how Andrew is just a wonderful human being. Everyone in our <br/>
homeschool group as pulled me aside to tell me they just adore him. <br/>
He already is what we could ever hope to have in a child so how on <br/>
earth could public school (or schooling at home) ever improve on that?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for everybody&#39;s input. I am forwarding all of your responses <br/>
on to my hubby for his edification.:-)<br/>

If you watched it, you&#39;ll remember that he said that toddlers almost <br/>
always find the arrow before adults?  Something to do with learing <br/>
language and losing our ability to &quot;really see&quot; things.  So...as a <br/>
small experiment, I pulled up the Fed Ex website and asked my DD <br/>
where the arrow was......she pointed right to it and said &quot;there it <br/>
is&quot; and ran off to play.  &lt;BG&gt;<br/>

When I told my DH about it the next day, he had no idea where it was <br/>

&lt;&lt;Is <br/>
it really wrong to have any expectations of one&#39;s kids. And I am not <br/>
talking about making a living one person wants to live on.  What if <br/>
our kids want to get married and have kids, and wants them to be <br/>
homeschooled/unschooled and they can&#39;t make the money to that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think one thing your husband might not realize is how quickly somebody can <br/>
learn something if they really want to.  If one of my children wants a certain <br/>
job or wants a job with a certain amount of income, I have confidence that <br/>
they could learn what they need to get it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;I did tell him that once I read on a local homeschooling list about a mom <br/>
who&#39;s unschooled son really wanted to go to a certain college, or<br/>
get into a certain collegiate program (??), and couldn&#39;t get in because his <br/>
math abilities were atrocious.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If somebody really wants to get into a certain program at a certain college, <br/>
it may be necessary for them to plan a bit in advance and study some things <br/>
that may be required for admission or placement exams.  I really don&#39;t think <br/>
that needs to take very long.  They certainly wouldn&#39;t need to start at 4 or 7!  <br/>
I also think that kids who are heading in that direction would probably be <br/>
interested in these types of things well before they were heading to college.  If <br/>
the college requires a lot of stuff that really isn&#39;t necessary for their <br/>
chosen career and that they aren&#39;t interested in, I would recommend that they <br/>
look into other colleges or other method career preparation.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you ever met a child who had no hope for his own<br/>
future?  He was probably abused, beaten, neglected,<br/>
and ignored.  That is not an unschooled child.  An<br/>
unschooled child is given MORE attention, MORE<br/>
freedom, MORE opportunities than those shut in a<br/>
concrete building with poor ventilation and little<br/>
sunlight every day.  There are no boundaries to the<br/>
list of opportunities and adventures and experiences<br/>
an unschooled child can have.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -=- I remember thinking back in my 20s  how I wished<br/>
&gt; my parents had pushed me <br/>
&gt; to stay with the Cello. (I give up on alot of stuff<br/>
&gt; of my own admittance) <br/>
&gt; because I might be a great player. But upon thinking<br/>
&gt; about it,  I realized that <br/>
&gt; &quot;might&quot; be a great cellist,isn&#39;t a good enough<br/>
&gt; reason for my parents pushing <br/>
&gt; me.  Clearly, I had other things on my mind. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>John Holt learned to play the cello at age 50.  If you<br/>
want to learn it now, you can.  There wasn&#39;t a time<br/>
limit set on when you could learn.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-Don&#39;t parents&#39; experiences count for something<br/>
&gt; when raising their kids. <br/>
&gt; How can someone who is 4 or 7 even understand that<br/>
&gt; their education belongs to <br/>
&gt; them, aren&#39;t we supposed to be here to help them? Is<br/>
&gt; raising kids just about <br/>
&gt; giving them food, shelter and love, the rest is just<br/>
&gt; up to them. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But unschooling parents don&#39;t sit and do nothing.  We<br/>
are engaging our kids so much more, and on such a<br/>
deeper level than parents who rely upon curriculum. <br/>
No one is saying you only provide food, shelter, and<br/>
clothing.  You are watching tv with them, playing with<br/>
them, working alongside them, discussing their<br/>
thoughts and hopes and dreams and how to help them<br/>
achieve them. <br/>
<br/>
Rachel, just a question, please don&#39;t be offended, but<br/>
does your husband have misgivings about how you are<br/>
engaging the children, or not engaging them enough? <br/>
Does he see learning and growth and happiness<br/>
expanding in your children?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-807886882">Dear Rachel,<br/>
<br/>
Your husband *does* sound very caring and thoughtful. Of course, as <br/>
an unschooler, I still have to disagree with him. ;)<br/>
<br/>
There are millions of people who are struggling to make a living <br/>
because school disabled them so badly. Not only did it fail to give <br/>
them adequate information for surviving in the real world, but it <br/>
fostered a deep aversion to learning and trampled their self esteem. <br/>
Then there are the millions of people who somehow managed to get <br/>
through school to the point where they *are* making a good living, <br/>
but they are depressed because they are assemblyline products of a <br/>
factory system. A life that is forced to be focused on jumping <br/>
through a series of hoops (that do not themselves offer anything of <br/>
value) simply so that one will be allowed to move on farther down <br/>
the assembly line and finally make enough money to impress the <br/>
neighbors, is not necessarily a life that guarantees happiness. In <br/>
fact, it is almost certain to *not* confer happiness. The American <br/>
Dream is for most people a big fat lie. Superficially, they might <br/>
achieve it, but inside they are in bad shape. The incredible number <br/>
of people with pyschological disorders and depression in this <br/>
country (regardless of income level) must attest to that, don&#39;t you <br/>
think?<br/>
<br/>
I want to tell you about my friend Jacques. When he was a kid, his <br/>
mother and father bought a piece of woodland property. His mother <br/>
still lives there, and Jacques has now built his own house there. He <br/>
built it himself over a period of years; every time he had a little <br/>
extra money, he did a little more. The house is unbelievably cozy <br/>
and pleasant to be in. Jacques is not rich. He doesn&#39;t even work <br/>
regularly, only doing carpentry odd jobs here and there. His need <br/>
for income is not high, though, as he lives simply. Every time I see <br/>
this man he has a smile on his face. He is calm and serene, and <br/>
carries an air of general satisfaction about him. People are drawn <br/>
to him because he gives off the glow of a life well lived. Every <br/>
night he and his girlfriend fix a fire in their wood stove and make <br/>
a simple, healthy meal. They read, or play musical instruments (they <br/>
both are quite good, but then, they have had enough time, given <br/>
their lifestyle, to play enough to become good.) It is very easy to <br/>
see children come into this scenario. They are not poor. They are <br/>
not suffering. Children do not need much aside from good nutrition, <br/>
love (which, because of their chosen lifestyle, their parents would <br/>
have a lot of time to give,) and opportunities to explore and enrich <br/>
their lives, which I can see being provided by the nearby town <br/>
library, theatre, art center, etc, and the many friends their <br/>
parents have. The point being that there are ways to create a life <br/>
that will support a family and a sense of well-being, which are not <br/>
dependant on having a nine-to-five job, a career, a degree, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
I do have expectations of my own children, in a sense, though I <br/>
think the more accurate word is &quot;hopes&quot;, since &quot;expectation&quot; implies <br/>
that they owe me something. I hope they will live their lives with <br/>
integrity and self-confidence, and that they will do things because <br/>
they are valuable to them, not just because someone else has told <br/>
them they &quot;should&quot;. I assume this will make them happy, which is <br/>
also what I hope for them. To be happy. And I don&#39;t know anyone who <br/>
is happy being policed. <br/>
<br/>
You touched on this already, with your example of your cello <br/>
playing. When I was in fifth grade I reached a point in my piano <br/>
instruction where I just didn&#39;t enjoy pushing myself to learn harder <br/>
pieces. I hated practicing. When my piano teacher (who was probably <br/>
uncomfortable about taking my parents&#39; money when I wasn&#39;t <br/>
progressing) had a talk with my mom about it, I felt very bad. Like <br/>
I was letting her down, like I was wasting her money. And in fact, I <br/>
could see that my mom was embarrassed by the teacher&#39;s <br/>
confrontation. But all she said to me after that was, &quot;it&#39;s your <br/>
choice whether you want to practice or not. It&#39;s doesn&#39;t matter to <br/>
me, I just want you to be happy.&quot; I spent the entire next year <br/>
happily *not* practicing. In a sense, I &quot;quit&quot;, as far as training <br/>
and progress goes. And then guess what happened? My desire to be <br/>
better came back. But then another year would go by and I would lose <br/>
interest in practicing again. This has been my pattern ever since. I <br/>
am now a quite accomplished musician, and I believe that I got this <br/>
far because I was allowed to do it on my own terms. I often wonder <br/>
what would have happened if I&#39;d been forced to practice, &quot;for my own <br/>
good&quot;? I&#39;m grateful now that my mom had enough sense to not force it.<br/>
<br/>
But will our kids blame us when they aren&#39;t good at something they <br/>
would like to be good at? Frankly, I hope my kids aren&#39;t that self-<br/>
absorbed and lacking in common sense. A friend of mine blames his <br/>
parents for him not being a better athlete because when he quit the <br/>
baseball team in gradeschool they didn&#39;t force him to continue! It&#39;s <br/>
also his parents&#39; fault that he&#39;s not a great musician because they <br/>
didn&#39;t force him to practice piano. And a myriad of other things. I <br/>
find that attitude shocking. To me that&#39;s the epitome of laziness, <br/>
to expect *others* to be responsible for making something impressive <br/>
out of you. But it also just doesn&#39;t make logical sense. Because <br/>
when someone forces you to do something it takes the joy out of it. <br/>
Think about it. Say there is something that right now you have <br/>
absolutely no interest in, and the only way you will have anything <br/>
to do with it is if somebody forces you to, and you know if they do <br/>
that you will begin to dislike learning and maybe even the thing <br/>
itself -- but there is also a slight possibility that in the future <br/>
you will think, &quot;gee, I would be so happy if I was proficient in <br/>
this thing!&quot; Would it be okay with you if someone had the power <br/>
right now to force you to learn that thing? And if they don&#39;t wield <br/>
that power over you, will you hold them responsible in the future <br/>
because you don&#39;t know how to do this thing? Would you, in other <br/>
words, trade loss of freedom and joy for some arbitrary skill? Why <br/>
not instead focus on gaining skill in something that does *not* <br/>
require depriving you of freedom and joy? Wouldn&#39;t that be so much <br/>
better?<br/>
<br/>
Your husband argues that children do not have the benefit of <br/>
experience to tell them what they need to do to prepare for <br/>
fulfilling lives, and that therefore parents, who do have <br/>
experience, should prepare them. I agree, but realistically you can <br/>
only take that so far. You can advise your children, provide <br/>
materials, open up the path to opportunities. But you can&#39;t predict <br/>
what academic skills will be valuable to your child, if any. I <br/>
learned so much math that I could have entered an engineering <br/>
program. Guess what, I&#39;m not interested in engineering. But I am <br/>
interested in self-sufficiency, in farming and canning and raising <br/>
livestock and carpentry and sewing. Oh woe is me, that my parents <br/>
didn&#39;t teach me any of that. Oh poor, poor me, now I&#39;ll have to <br/>
learn it from scratch as an adult. How could my parents have done <br/>
this to me? And damn, I wasted all that time on math! (And I mean <br/>
that last bit seriously.) I know a man, by the way, who was <br/>
unschooled and knew nothing but basic arithmetic, who took a basic <br/>
math class in college, found out that he liked it and was good at <br/>
it, and went on to get a degree in mathematics. True story. And he <br/>
is unschooling his kids now.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really a matter of attitude. Are you going to take <br/>
responsibility for your own life or not? Are you going to live in <br/>
the past, or make things happen now? And which approach to life do <br/>
you hope for your children to learn from you?<br/>
<br/>
I agree with your husband, though, that parents do have a <br/>
responsbility to their children. They have a responsibility to <br/>
support them in becoming strong, self-confident and self-determined <br/>
people. They have a responsibility to encourage their curiosity and <br/>
love of learning rather than squelching it. They have a <br/>
responsibility to give them a safe, secure base from which to <br/>
explore the world and determine their rightful place in it. They <br/>
have a responsibility to show by example that the really valuable <br/>
things in life also feel good, and that anything else is death to <br/>
the human spirit.<br/>

Yes, Robert sees our kids learning and growing and that they are <br/>

The Ring (I know Scary movie, which we didn&#39;t see did a spoof on The <br/>
Ring, the Matrix, and Signs) but his is just the ring. He has been at <br/>
the pc for days. Last night he was on til nearly 2am.  I ribbed <br/>
Robert a little when I said, &quot;Uh Oh Hunny, Andrew is UNSHOOLING!! <br/>
Aaaahhh!&quot; Ben and Autumn and I have been doing alot of drawing with <br/>
chalk outside and blowing bubbles. We had an awesome day playing at <br/>
the park on tuesday where I got to meet more of the unschoolers in <br/>
our group. Their kids are all younger, more Autumn&#39;s age, so she had <br/>
a blast! Ben, for all his academic difficulties is a very articulate <br/>
kid with a great vocabulary. He is the master gamer and that&#39;s fine <br/>
with me. Robert is amazed by his ability with pcs and nintendo. <br/>
Robert is also continually amazed by Autumns capacity to learn <br/>
anything <br/>
and how quickly she does it. He KNOWS his kids learn just fine. He is <br/>
just a scaredy cat...and admits it.  Alot of his issues with this are <br/>
fear based. He has a hard time trusting. And Hey, I am sure that <br/>
comes <br/>
from his schooled experience and growing up with a military dad (he <br/>
has referred to as The Great Santini).  I went to school too, but my <br/>
parents were ahead of their time in their level of support and love <br/>
and distaste for institutions and unquestioned authority, so my <br/>
brother and I never thought that school was very important to our <br/>
later lives.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the questions and suggestions tho&#39;.  They made me sit back <br/>
and notice all that my kids really do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318218422">&lt;&lt; He doesn&#39;t have his whole life to learn about it if he wants to.    If<br/>
he&#39;s thinking school or schoolwork is the answer, or if you&#39;re thinking of<br/>
risking the peace of your marriage to unschool without his approval or<br/>
cooperation, that&#39;s not balanced.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a really  good reason to make changes  like letting go of TV<br/>
restrictions, bedtimes, food etc gradually, to give husbands time to adjust<br/>
and to understand what you are doing and how it all works. I think it&#39;s<br/>
really important that they feel included and a part of the journey. Creating<br/>
tension and resentment in a marriage doesn&#39;t make the home a great place for<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I guess that&#39;s not possible but I think it should be a big<br/>
consideration. I gave Mark lots to read and we have spent hours talking<br/>
about unschooling/parenting/freedom...... He asked me to trust him while he<br/>
&#39;tinkered&#39; with it all. He had to get comfortable and make it a part of<br/>
himself.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra said the first part, Julie said the second part. I agree with <br/>
both of them.  That is why Robert and I keep talking about it.  He <br/>
let it go while we unschooled a few years ago, I let it go whild we <br/>
schooled at home. But neither of us really let go of our educational <br/>
philosophies fully. And it has come up again and it&#39;s just time to <br/>
finally deal with it.  We haven&#39;t had bed or tv  or game restrictions <br/>
for a really long time. Mostly no food restrictions either.  Ben <br/>
REALLY won&#39;t eat anything but cereal/milk, oatmeal/milk, or mac & <br/>
cheese, unless I ask him to eat something with more protein and moren <br/>
vit/min.  There are biological signs that Ben may have hypoglycemia <br/>
or some other stuff we are working on. So, his food restrictions are <br/>
more about his health than control. Mostly you can eat what you want <br/>
when you want in our house.  That is why I have said that we live so <br/>
unschoolingly already.  It&#39;s just this finally letting go of Andrew <br/>
having to do &quot;schoolwork&quot; at home is what I want my husband, after 7 <br/>
years of homeschooling, to finally really let go of and see what <br/>
happens.  I keep telling him he might be very pleasantly surprised.<br/>

say is that &quot;they have a responsibility to show by example that the <br/>
really valuable things in life also feel good. Anything else is <br/>
death to the human spirit.&quot; Didn&#39;t mean to imply that parents should <br/>
be out there getting in bad situations just to make a point...<br/>
<br/>
Even so, that statement might seem a little extreme to some people. <br/>
But I&#39;m not saying that what is truly best for us never involves any <br/>
pain. Only that the ultimate result will be positive. If it&#39;s not, <br/>
it wasn&#39;t truly the best thing, was it?<br/>

ways to get experience and knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
But our confidence in school ways reaches deeper inside us than the words<br/>
&quot;knowledge and experience&quot; convey which is probably why I interrupted the<br/>
thought to jot down an easier thought that was flowing out!<br/>
<br/>
With school we have a lifetime of success stories so we &quot;know&quot; (eg, have a<br/>
tremendous amount of confidence in) that it &quot;works&quot; (creates nonburdensome<br/>
citizens.)<br/>
<br/>
(I don&#39;t think society sees burdensome citizens as being caused by school.<br/>
They are seen as caused by factors the schools can&#39;t cope with like bad home<br/>
life and kids who don&#39;t care or who are too far outside the norm.)<br/>
<br/>
(Actually it&#39;s not that society doesn&#39;t see burdensome citizens as caused by<br/>
school so much as society doesn&#39;t see an easy fix -- since the problems are<br/>
in the key factors (factory model, coerced learning and so on) that allow<br/>
schools to function -- so it&#39;s easier to place the blame outside of school.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway ... with unschooling we don&#39;t have that lifetime of stories. We have<br/>
people telling us why unschooling makes sense that it works but we don&#39;t see<br/>
the results around us -- only read accounts of unschooled kids that are<br/>
obviously filtered by biased parents -- so we don&#39;t have the same foundation<br/>
of dozens of years of second-hand and first-hand experience for the<br/>
confidence that school gives us.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; It&#39;s also helpful to realize the goals of unschooling are different than<br/>
&gt;&gt; other ways of schooling and homeschooling. The goal is helping the child be<br/>
&gt;&gt; who he is right now and help him grow into who he will become. The goal of<br/>
&gt;&gt; schooling is to get a child to some specific place that it&#39;s assumed<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>... by society as a beginning point to successful careers (and nonburdensome<br/>
citizenship.)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about that!<br/>

I just wanted to say again how wonderful Mary Gold&#39;s (this is zenmomma, right?) article on Special Needs or Just Special? was. I re-read it because of this thread and remembered how great I thought it was when I read it in HEM. It is just so beautiful, and it really brought home to me how important and precious unschooling is for children. That article really touched me--thank you!<br/>
