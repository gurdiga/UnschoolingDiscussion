<div id="ygrps-yiv-746472612">Things kind of go on a continuum here.  I really try to make sure the kids<br/>
are free to do what they choose as long as they are not infringing on the<br/>
rights of others.  When they are it is discussed and since several of my<br/>
kids are still quite young, they occassionally have to deal with the<br/>
consequences of their choices.  Example:  Shelly (3) is playing play station<br/>
right now.  Danny (4) has been in pestering at her because she isn&#39;t playing<br/>
how he does.  I talked with Danny about how Shelly can play as she chooses,<br/>
that there are lots of ways to play the game, etc.  He continued and<br/>
continued to pester at her until she became upset.  I attempted to get Danny<br/>
to come do an activity with me but he was still into what Shelly was doing.<br/>
So I told him that he needed to come away and quit pestering her.  He<br/>
eventually was asked to leave the room.  But this is also the kid that peels<br/>
his own apples, climbs as high as he is comfortable  in trees, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Adriane (12) is completely in control of her entire life.  She eats what and<br/>
when she chooses, she sleeps where and when she chooses, watches and listens<br/>
to whatever she chooses, bathes and brushes whenever she chooses, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Zach (10) is somewhere in the middle.  The choices he makes sometimes brush<br/>
up against the rights of others.  Example:  He hates to brush his teeth.<br/>
After a few days, I find it disgusting and don&#39;t want to hang out too close<br/>
with him.  It is not uncommon for me to ask him to brush his teeth when he<br/>
wants me to do something with him that requires close contact.  He hates to<br/>
change his clothes but dh will often ask him to change if he wants to<br/>
accompany dh somewhere.<br/>

They sound like my children. Anna (13) and Ethan (11)  Pretty much the exact <br/>
same dynamics.  Ethan HATES to change clothes and bathe or brush his teeth <br/>
(Ok basically, he  has horrible personal hygeine)  Well, now that he&#39;s <br/>
approaching puberty, that boy can get RANK. .. Sometimes I just have to say, <br/>
Ethan, please take a shower, please.   It gets to the point that no one can <br/>
stand to be around him, esp in close quarters like the van.  Usually, if he <br/>
hasnt bathed and we are going somewhere, thats when I have to insist...  He <br/>
still protests and hates to do it.. but he will usually &quot;give in&quot;  Sometimes <br/>
I just compromise and purseude him to just wash under his arms so he doesnt <br/>
have to take a complete shower.   So.. how would you guys handle a situation <br/>
like this?  Just let him shower when he wants to ( never).. or impose <br/>
&quot;reasonable&quot;  standards of hygiene for health and sanitation sake?  ( and the <br/>
sake of our noses.. lol)<br/>

Oh.. of course, I forgot something.. Yesterday some folks were posting about <br/>
how thier boys didnt like to leave the house.. Had to drag them kicking and <br/>
screaming, etc.. and they were getting worse.. Well, Ethan is also the same <br/>
in those regards.   This resisting bathing ,changing clothes, etc, is just <br/>
another way for him to avoid change.  Children with ADHD have a very <br/>
difficult time making transitions.   Just like some others said, its not <br/>
really the &quot;thing&quot; the kid is going to do that bugs them ( they may love the <br/>
movies or going to the library) Its the change of activities that upsets <br/>
them.  This was one BIG challange in Ethan going to public school.  He hated <br/>
getting up and getting ready .. it was horrible.. I am so glad I dont have to <br/>
deal with that anymore.   I try everything I can think of to make <br/>
transistions easier for Ethan.  But, nothing really seems to work.  He opts <br/>
to stay home a lot of the time.. . And I know that he is really missing <br/>
things that he would enjoy if he would just come along. . But, I dont push <br/>
him, unless he HAS to go, ( like I dont want to stay home alone for a long <br/>
period of time.)    Its heartbreaking, really.. and I wish I knew the <br/>
solution<br/>

He&#39;s 11.  Can you wait a year or two?  &lt;g&gt;  In a couple of years he&#39;ll be<br/>
taking two showers a day, at least based on my experience with boys.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ditto that.  But I make Will take showers.  If he wants to sleep in my bed, <br/>
he&#39;s going to have to be non-smelly.  <br/>
<br/>
The other day he took a shower and then came in and gave me a hug.  I asked <br/>
him if he had used soap, and he said the soap was too little, so he didn&#39;t!  <br/>
<br/>
I made him take another one.  Got him some soap.  lol.<br/>
