&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; No one said to frustrate the kids. But yes you can have the dessert you want<br/>
&gt; when you want it and yes I will buy you this even though you don&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; need it and yes you can stay up late if you want and yes you can go swimming<br/>
&gt; even though it&#39;s thundering just aren&#39;t getting it in this house.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you have the choice to have the dessert you want when you want it? Do you<br/>
have the chance to buy something for yourself, even though you don&#39;t really<br/>
need it? Do you choose when to go to bed?<br/>
<br/>
Any sane person, including a short one, can understand not doing something<br/>
immediately dangerous, so the last example doesn&#39;t really fit (like Sesame<br/>
Street: &quot;One of these things is not like the others&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
All the others you stated are exactly what DOES get it in this house, which<br/>
brings me to:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; hardly comparable to breaking someone&#39;s finger when they might break a bone<br/>
&gt; someday anyway. I&#39;ve seen plenty of kids who never get the no&#39;s and don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really like what I see. We all have them to deal with and if they are<br/>
&gt; comparable to age, I don&#39;t see a problem with them at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My children definitely hear no. Brittany asked me last year, with deep<br/>
sorrow already in her eyes as she asked, &quot;Mama, do Pokemon really exist?&quot;<br/>
and I had to tell her that no, they are just cartoons and toys. And she<br/>
sighed and said, &quot;I didn&#39;t think so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now that may be a cute little kid story, but that was real tragedy for her<br/>
at that time -- she would have loved nothing better than to be a Pokemon<br/>
trainer. I remember my sadness when I was a child and realized that my model<br/>
horses never would come to life. A stable of teeny tiny 12&quot; living horses<br/>
was my fondest dream, but I had to accept it as a dream.<br/>
<br/>
In this house, we try very hard to help every one of us do what we want to<br/>
do, long term and short term. The no&#39;s that come up for real reasons (an<br/>
honest lack of money at the time, the real danger involved, etc.) are taken<br/>
with a good deal of composure by our children, as they know they are not<br/>
arbitrary, and that if at all possible they are also temporary.<br/>
<br/>
There is NOBODY who &quot;never gets the no&#39;s&quot;, so that&#39;s not a real scenario.<br/>

standing alive and reasonably healthy at the end. And I <br/>
especially tried hard not to say &quot;no&quot; to my two year olds! &lt;g&gt; Talk <br/>
about a recipe for disaster.<br/>
<br/>
Your two year old doesn&#39;t understand that some things can hurt <br/>
her? It&#39;s not a lie to say, &quot;We can&#39;t stay out in the lightning and <br/>
thunder because it might hurt us.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t saying &quot;no&quot; to say, &quot;Yes of COURSE we can run across the <br/>
street, grab Mommy&#39;s hand so you&#39;ll be safe and we&#39;ll both look <br/>
for the big cars.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t saying &quot;no&quot; to say, &quot;You want to stand on the table? Super! <br/>
Let me stand right here and watch and you know what, let me put <br/>
these pillows on the floor first&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Learning about the consequences of too many M&Ms is an <br/>
excellent way for a child to learn self-restraint, IMHO, and would <br/>
for me be well worth the consequences of a bit of clean up.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, of course, the two year old cannot do what she <br/>
wants. Sometimes, I cannot do what I want. This is where real, <br/>
true, factual &quot;no&#39;s&quot; come up for all of us, as I said before.<br/>

<br/>
I like it when the learning is on the part of the parent who has always just <br/>
believed that too much candy makes you sick.  It&#39;s one of those things that <br/>
has been said, and repeated, and threatened, and recited, but rarely proven.<br/>
<br/>
And I myself have binged on candy many times and never gotten sick.  I&#39;ve <br/>
seen lots of people do it.<br/>
<br/>
But my kids have never, ever binged on candy.  Not at Easter, not at <br/>
Halloween, not at Christmas.  Because candy was never measured or controlled <br/>
or glamorized, so they only eat it if they want it, and they see NO reason on <br/>
earth to eat one bite more than they want.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are lots of ways to redirect a 2 year old. (Hey let&#39;s play in here for <br/>
awhile..or.. let&#39;s have a race across the floor instead of the table, it&#39;s <br/>
too wobbly up there.) And I&#39;m assuming you don&#39;t leave your 2 year old <br/>
outside alone where she can run across the street without you. So that one&#39;s <br/>
kind of a moot point. And actually, come to think of it, Casey did climb on <br/>
a lot of tables. She was a very athletic and agile little 2 year old. Never <br/>
fell. Now she&#39;s a gymnast.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the point is treating your kids like another person rather than <br/>
someone to be taught some discipline. The discpline comes with the learning. <br/>
The learning doesn&#39;t have to originate from being told what you can&#39;t do. If <br/>
no comes up, so be it, but how much more joyful to see how many yesses you <br/>
can say in a day.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay so I do see your point. I just do it differently. I don&#39;t have a <br/>
problem with saying no as long as it&#39;s not more than once in awhile. As long <br/>
as the no&#39;s don&#39;t overwhelm and come no where near the yes responses. But I <br/>
do say no, and probably more than what sound like some of you do. I just <br/>
don&#39;t think that&#39;s a problem. And I always follow up with a more definite <br/>
explanation after the no as in why it&#39;s a no.<br/>
<br/>
And I won&#39;t let the 2 yr old eat the MM&#39;s. None of the other kids learned <br/>
that lesson the hard way and now they stop their sweets before it ever even <br/>
looks like too much. Hopefully this one will be just as reasonable!! I won&#39;t <br/>
put pillows on the floor so she can stand on the table and yes we run across <br/>
the street together and in from the storms.<br/>
So as much as we&#39;re different, we&#39;re also alike. It&#39;s just a matter of what <br/>
works for each of us and our own children.<br/>

The same with my kids. I have seen my 19 yo, halfway though a piece of cheesecake , his favourite dessert, say &quot;I&#39;ve had enough&quot; and just stop eating. No food , in his childhood, was  forbidden or made into a treat so he, and his brothers, can just stop eating when they want. It took me years to learn how to do that with certain foods, as an adult..Leonie W. <br/>

&quot;Learning that lesson the hard way&quot; might be mythical.  <br/>
If an old wive&#39;s tale says too much candy makes people sick, <br/>
but moms don&#39;t test it out,<br/>
then maybe there IS no &quot;hard way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At it&#39;s purest levels, unschooling involves trusting ourselves and our <br/>
children to learn.  Learning isn&#39;t all about phonics and math facts.  Very <br/>
little of learning about everything in the whole wide world is phonics or <br/>
arithmetic.  Critical thinking, cause and effect, being analytical about what <br/>
and why and how--those things are more important to natural learning than any <br/>
one piece of information.<br/>

But I eat them really slowly, melting the outside shell and then melting the <br/>
chocolate and then cleaning the almond and then breaking it in two.  So if I <br/>
eat LOTS of them, it takes a long time.<br/>
<br/>
ANY kind of eating too fast will give me a stomach ache, no matter what the <br/>
food.<br/>
<br/>
My consequences on chocolate are that I don&#39;t want chocolate then for a while.<br/>
