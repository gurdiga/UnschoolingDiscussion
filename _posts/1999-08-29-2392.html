<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197395272"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Next, the dumbing down of liberal education for the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>purpose of providing a few required courses so the &gt;students can get on<br/>
with the real business of careering.  Finally, so much of &gt;its has become<br/>
a business in and of itself that sometimes it almost &gt;seems that the fact<br/>
that learning is supposed to take place there is almost &gt;an afterthought.<br/>
<br/>
Here, here, David.  And the number of students admitted to any particular<br/>
program or department is not related at all to the amount of students who<br/>
want to be there, but is directly proportional to the amount of so-called<br/>
&quot;jobs&quot; the experts think there will be available, operating on that old<br/>
scarcity model again.  Never mind where each person&#39;s skills are, or what<br/>
kind of valuable work they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
My husband has been a social worker with children for almost a decade.  For<br/>
years now he has wanted to go back to school to become a secondary ed<br/>
teacher.  He has tons of experience with kids and a ton of knowledge and<br/>
love for the English language, history, folklore, music, and mythology, but<br/>
the system is set up to keep him out.  No evening courses, long period of<br/>
unpaid student teaching required for &quot;state certification&quot;.  And every<br/>
school that he has called about teacher certification has had a horrible<br/>
attitude with him; no effort at all to help him find a way to become a<br/>
teacher.  I have been shocked at how rude some of these people have been, as<br/>
I have made a lot of these phone calls.<br/>
<br/>
It disgusts me that these people are in charge of higher education for<br/>
teachers!<br/>
<br/>
I agree with what you said about Steiner, as well, David.  Most of what he<br/>
wrote was his observations of children.  And a lot of what he wrote about<br/>
how children learn very closely resembled John Holt&#39;s ideas about how<br/>
learning comes from within and must be meaningful to the child.<br/>
<br/>
Hope all is well with you, and looking forward to the release of your book!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
