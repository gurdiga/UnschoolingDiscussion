<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131382237">Learning from &quot;uneducational&quot; sources.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize in advance if I have already posted this to this group.<br/>
Anyway, my daughter, 7 at the time, wanted to spend an entire beautiful<br/>
Saturday inside the house watching the Power Puff girls. I like it, but it<br/>
seems like a total waste of time.<br/>
This was killing me, and I almost said, &quot;ok, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours of<br/>
Power Puffs is enough&quot;, but I bit my lip. Finally, after what seemed like an<br/>
eternity, she turned off the T.V. She them proceeded to sketch power puff<br/>
girls in various situations. Then, for a couple of weeks we researched<br/>
cartoons, how they are made etc.-at her insistence.<br/>
I realized that she was really studying the drawings, sound, voices, and who<br/>
knows what else.<br/>
Even if a child doesn&#39;t grab a sketch pad and ask questions about cartoons<br/>
or offer &quot;proof&quot; of learning, I still think that they are learning<br/>
something, who knows, they could be day dreaming about an entirely different<br/>
subject-that is what I am often doing while watching TV.<br/>
