Plundering &#39;for the children&#39;<br/>
<br/>
When corporate moguls get nabbed for ripping off shareholders, the media go <br/>
ape-wild. Last year&#39;s front-page headlines were filled with Big Business <br/>
scandals and barrels of op-ed indignation about capitalist greed. But when <br/>
teachers&#39; union officials plunder their members&#39; coffers in Enronic <br/>
proportions, the media go . . . AWOL. <br/>
<br/>
I recently read a nauseating FBI affidavit filed last month in support of <br/>
search and seizure warrants for three teachers&#39; union officials in <br/>
Washington, D.C. The accused villains under federal investigation are former <br/>
Washington Teachers Union President Barbara Bullock, her aide, Gwen Hemphill, <br/>
and her treasurer, James Baxter. All three are prominent cronies of D.C. <br/>
Mayor Anthony Williams and key players in the local Democratic machine. <br/>
<br/>
The union extracts nearly $700 a month per teacher from its 5,500-member <br/>
group. The Trump-spending trio and several others are suspected of embezzling <br/>
more than $2 million in member dues dating back to 1995. Here is just one <br/>
excerpt of the FBI affidavit detailing Bullock&#39;s selfless expenditures: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Among (her) purchases were: a $20,000 mink coat, along with other mink coats <br/>
that . . . have been stored at Miller Furs in Chevy Chase, Maryland; nearly <br/>
$500,000 in custom-made clothing from a Baltimore clothing maker known as Van <br/>
Style . . . more than $9,000 at retailer Bloomingdales; more than $9,000 for <br/>
clothing and accessories from a Florida vendor known as Body Scentre Limited; <br/>
more than $11,000 in purchases from a retailer known as Friedman&#39;s Shoes in <br/>
Atlanta, Georgia; more than $5,000 to Galt Brothers Jewelry in Washington, <br/>
D.C.; more than $5,000 to Graffiti AudioVideo for electronic equipment; more <br/>
than $12,000 at retailer Hecht Company; more than $3,000 at the Hermes <br/>
Boutique in Vienna, Virginia . . . &quot; <br/>
<br/>
Wait, there&#39;s more: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;(M)ore than $5,000 for bedding and a desk pad from the Horchow Collection; <br/>
more than $6,000 to vendor J. Crew; more than $15,000 . . . for St. John Knit <br/>
apparel; more than $4,000 for merchandise from Little Switzerland JNU, in <br/>
Juneau, Alaska; more than $60,000 to MS Rau Antiques in New Orleans, <br/>
Louisiana (including $57,000 for a 288-piece Tiffany sterling silver set); <br/>
more than $17,000 to Miller Furs; more than $150,000 at retailer <br/>
Neiman-Marcus; more than $50,000 at retailer Nordstrom; more than $4,000 at <br/>
beauty salon Oriental Oasis; more than $25,000 for services of the Parkway <br/>
Custom Dry Cleaners in Chevy Chase, Maryland; more than $9,000 to Ramee Art <br/>
Gallery in Washington, D.C.; more than $40,000 at retailer Saks Fifth Avenue; <br/>
more than $50,000 at a vendor known as Snazzy Limited in Orange Park, <br/>
Florida; more than $4,000 at the St. John Boutique in Beverly Hills, <br/>
California, and New York, New York; more than $2,500 for china or crystal <br/>
from The Lenox Shop in Williamsburg, Virginia, and Prince William, Virginia; <br/>
more than $6,000 in gourmet kitchen equipment from retailer Williams-Sonoma; <br/>
almost $4,000 to jeweler Tiffany & Co.; more than $20,000 to the Atlanta <br/>
gallery of the artist William Tolliver; and more than $7,000 to Wagner <br/>
Opticians.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Bullock spread the wealth to friends and family. According to the FBI agent, <br/>
her sister received &quot;a two-door, French, hand-painted armoire&quot; from an <br/>
Alexandria, Va., antiques dealer, Tradition de France. Bullock&#39;s driver and <br/>
errand boy, Leroy Holmes, received checks &quot;totaling in excess of $1,000,000, <br/>
which he converted to cash to pay himself more than $90,000 per year, plus <br/>
additional funds to maintain and pay for personal vehicles, and provide cash <br/>
to others.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Bullock&#39;s aide, Hemphill, also shared her booty with family, including <br/>
$20,000 in African art; a $12,999 50&quot; plasma, flat-screen television; and a <br/>
$950 handbag from Neiman-Marcus. Union Treasurer Baxter is suspected of <br/>
rampant book-cooking to hide his union income from the IRS. The trio also <br/>
&quot;enlisted the aid of an accountant to help them hide the misconduct,&quot; <br/>
according to investigators. Also under scrutiny: Interim Union President <br/>
Esther S. Hankerson, who has held leadership positions since 1994 and whose <br/>
credit-card use is reportedly being probed. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the union&#39;s rent, phone bills and health premiums for retired <br/>
teachers went unpaid. <br/>
<br/>
This is a sickening and all-too-familiar case of education corruption <br/>
involving the looting of compulsory union dues. Rank-and-file teachers have <br/>
fought across the country for the right to stop union tyrants from siphoning <br/>
money from their paychecks for political lobbying and personal <br/>
aggrandizement. Big Labor&#39;s accounting system is a sham. But you won&#39;t read <br/>
about this scandal on the editorial pages of The New York Times. <br/>
<br/>
After all, the looters did it &quot;for the children,&quot; right? <br/>

i live in a &quot;Right to Work&quot; state which, ironically, means that there aren&#39;t any unions.  My annual dues to the state teacher organization-- NOT a union but more of a lobbying/ insurance organization-- are over $400.  I don&#39;t think that this $700/ month number can be anywhere near correct.<br/>
