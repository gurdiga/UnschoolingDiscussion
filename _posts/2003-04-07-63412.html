<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509145159">Hi,<br/>
Brianna & I have a small home. We also run a home business out of here. We have our web site and we are pow wow traders. That means we have lots of stock. Here - in the house. We also have a 15 month old Black Lab mix. To say she&#39;s hyper is an understatement. She&#39;s a great dog, but we haven&#39;t been able to stop her from pulling hard when we walk her. She also jumps on people. (She&#39;s knocked folks down!!)I have a chronic back condition. As much as I want, I cannot work with the dog as much as she needs. Brianna always says she will. She does. For a couple of days. Then  - Nothing.<br/>
I can&#39;t walk the dog because she pulls so hard. She actually caused me great pain.<br/>
Brianna is great with the dog - yet loses interest. Pow wow season is coming. We&#39;ll be out at powwows and I&#39;ll not have any choice but to leave our dog tied up by our tent. Away from people - away from our store tent. Then she&#39;ll bark.<br/>
<br/>
Brianna & I have talked about this. I can&#39;t keep this dog for the next ten years (or so) if she isn&#39;t going to be trained.<br/>
I have a video that we&#39;ve watched - again, Brianna doesn&#39;t do the work. I simply cannot.<br/>
I&#39;ve purchased a couple of books and magazines about this. We&#39;ve looked into training (cheapest price - $400.00 )<br/>
We can&#39;t afford that.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to give her an ultimatum - &quot;train this dog or she&#39;s gone!&quot;<br/>
I hate to yell about - altho when I was pulled over - I sure did yell!<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Janis<br/>

Bronwen suggested on list getting a Halti. If you&#39;re interested in getting<br/>
one, we have one that we used once and our dog passed away recently -- not<br/>
from the Halti! ;-) -- so now it&#39;s just sitting unused. She was a yellow lab<br/>
so it should be the right size.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like it, I&#39;d be happy to pass it on. Just send me your address.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832772182">Dear Joyce,<br/>
The Halti arrived late yesterday. Thanks so very much! Teah was decidedly confused about it. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s thrilled with it, but she&#39;s accepted her fate.  We&#39;ll be working with her today.  I can&#39;t tell you how much we appreciate this. We are truly grateful.<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Janis<br/>
