 </span></blockquote>Well, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s ever been a study done which could <br/>
calculate the percentage of protection (snicker...) but I&#39;m guessing <br/>
it would be pretty high.  Probably higher than a condom, at least as <br/>
high as foam, but slightly less than the pill.  Nothing&#39;s for sure.  <br/>
