&gt;&gt;If I say &quot;hey Kyson, come here with mom and do this sheet,<br/>
&gt; okay?&quot;, I can&#39;t be an unschooler???  to me, that is a far cry from<br/>
&gt; forced, scheduled work.  They are not forced, not stressed. &lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have to agree.  My son and daughter love to do workbook pages, but I<br/>
&gt; certainly don&#39;t sit them down at 9 a.m. every Tuesday and Thursday for an<br/>
&gt; hour of 3+4=  It is just another aspect of learning, and why not?  We<br/>
&gt; consult textbooks, encyclopedias, maps, use crayons, glue, paper,<br/>
&gt; scissors-all very much &#39;school&#39; items.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The point is not the workbooks, the textbooks, the encyclopedias, the maps,<br/>
the crayons, the glue, the paper, the scissors.<br/>
<br/>
The point is, what happens if the answer to &quot;Do this sheet, okay?&quot; is, &quot;No,<br/>
thanks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s where the rubber (or the unschooler) meets the road.<br/>
