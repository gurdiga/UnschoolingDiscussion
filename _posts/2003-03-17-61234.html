<div id="ygrps-yiv-851846659">Thanks - I haven&#39;t had much luck in the past with our extension<br/>
agent, but they are nice folks with lots of giveaways; asking is<br/>
always a good thing.  I hadn&#39;t thought of a vet; that is always a<br/>
popular destination.<br/>
<br/>
Your absolutely on target with the poop and tracks thing.  We are<br/>
in the country and I am amazed at how much a kid who &quot;hangs out<br/>
outside&quot; picks up on that.    We have a couple of acceptable<br/>
&quot;track&quot; books.  Poop has just sorta come naturally. LOL.  The<br/>
microscope is a fun toy.<br/>
<br/>
Actually it is because of her focused interest in noticing signs<br/>
of animals and classifying them that I wanted a source she could<br/>
use on her own for hair.  We&#39;ll have fun running into town to<br/>
ask, though.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890717445">LOL - my husband said taxidermist this morning.  I would have<br/>
never thought about it.  I don&#39;t &quot;think&quot; deer - though I am no<br/>
expert, because they were 12 inches off the ground, and on the<br/>
prong pointed down she says.  I am sure she is accurate on the<br/>
height - whether it was actually caught by something moving under<br/>
the fence is pretty open to mis-interpretation.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; Actually it is because of her focused interest in noticing signs<br/>
 of animals and classifying them that I wanted a source she could<br/>
 use on her own for hair.  We&#39;ll have fun running into town to<br/>
 ask, though. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you can find a local Native American tribe...sometimes they have an expert <br/>
tracker that could really be helpful.<br/>
Or a park ranger trained that way. We got to attend a parks service event <br/>
once, where the ranger was an excellent animal tracker. She pointed out <br/>
little signs that I would never have noticed and told us what kind of animal <br/>
had laid there! She had been trained by a Native American elder.<br/>

height - whether it was actually caught by something moving under<br/>
the fence is pretty open to mis-interpretation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-835497407">Badger it is - we walked down to our neighbor and asked her.  She<br/>
has lived here and handled the animals for 50 years.  &quot;Handling&quot;<br/>
was what triggered the idea for me.  Apparently badgers have a 10<br/>
to 12 year natural cycle in an area.  The last time they were<br/>
prevalent here we had just moved in.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all of the ideas.  Having them lead me to one our 6<br/>
can access whenever she wants is great.<br/>
