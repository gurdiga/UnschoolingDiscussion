&gt; ????? Um, er, why do you peel kindling? Or do you have another meaning for<br/>
&gt; &#39;peeling&#39;? It sounds to my like you are removing the bark?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh.  Playing with the bark from cedar.  It&#39;s easy to split, and the bark has<br/>
&gt; about 30 layers, sometimes that can be stripped into really thin, curly bits.<br/>
&gt;  It&#39;s a mindless sort of thing to do while I watch videos, but tonight I was<br/>
&gt; too weak and brainless to find a video so I watched TV.   And filled up a box<br/>
&gt; with easy-to-start tiny kindling.   I was creating excelsior, but am not<br/>
&gt; going to pack anything in it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also it&#39;s a good excuse to sit right at the hearth and play with the fire.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I doubt Americans guessed any better than you did, Carol.  Sorry.  (My<br/>
&gt; friends and relatives would have known.  I give the stuff away to friends<br/>
&gt; with fireplaces, so they have something artsy to use instead of newspaper to<br/>
&gt; start fires.  And I give it to them in ratty baskets I get from garage sales.<br/>
&gt;  When the baskets get old they&#39;re kindling too.)<br/>
