<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190032785">I would like to pass along some urgent information.<br/>
<br/>
The Democratic Party has now aligned itself squarely against <br/>
homeschooling and parental rights.  The Democratic National <br/>
Committee&#39;s website (www.dnc.org), endorsed by Al Gore, attacks <br/>
Republican Presidential nominee George W. Bush for being &quot;soft&quot; on <br/>
homeschooling.  That same website parrots<br/>
the agenda of the NEA, the nation&#39;s biggest teachers&#39; union, <br/>
insisting that all teachers of all children should be required to <br/>
possess state certification.<br/>
<br/>
That requirement would KILL homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It renews the threat of HR 6, which homeschoolers helped to kill in <br/>
1994.  That bill would have required the same thing -- state <br/>
certification.  That means, unless you spend many thousands of <br/>
dollars and several years taking courses in how to teach, you will <br/>
not be able to teach your child at home. That bill passed through the <br/>
House Education Committee with every Democrat voting for it, and <br/>
every Republican voting against it. George Miller (D-Cal), then <br/>
chairman of that committee, will become its chairman again if<br/>
the Democrats win control of the House, and has vowed to reintroduce <br/>
the bill.  This time, the Democrats would not be facing the imminent <br/>
disaster they faced in the 1994 elections, when Bill Clinton was at <br/>
his lowest in popularity.  They will have little to fear.<br/>
<br/>
IT IS DISHEARTENING TO ME THAT A MAJOR POLITICAL PARTY IN THE UNITED <br/>
STATES SHOULD SO BLITHELY ATTACK THE FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOM OF THE <br/>
FAMILY.<br/>
<br/>
It is disheartening, but not surprising.  I teach at an American <br/>
college; I know the left very well.  The Democratic Party is now <br/>
wholly controlled by the left -- by people who believe that the <br/>
state, not the family, is the basic institution of society.<br/>
<br/>
*  That is why the left wants taxpayer-financed daycare.  Former <br/>
feminist, Elizabeth Genovese warns that public funded daycare is the <br/>
next arena of assault on the traditional family, and will make it <br/>
more and more difficult for tax-strapped families to keep the mother <br/>
in the home, and more and more economically enticing to leave <br/>
children with others.<br/>
<br/>
* That is why the left wants to destroy the Boy Scouts.  President <br/>
Clinton&#39;s Justice Department recently decided to examine whether the <br/>
Boy Scouts should be banned from National Parks, because of their <br/>
refusal to admit homosexual scoutmasters.  Homosexuals do not mince <br/>
words when they assert that the<br/>
traditional family, and traditional manhood and womanhood, must be <br/>
overcome.<br/>
<br/>
*  That is why they despise homeschooling.  John Taylor Gatto has <br/>
written a long article on the fight one small Vermont village waged <br/>
to keep open the last one-room, public schoolhouse in the state.  The <br/>
powerful Vermont chapter of the NEA crushed them.  When the left <br/>
cannot abide even a traditional PUBLIC<br/>
school, what makes us think they will be friendlier with us <br/>
homeschoolers? To a tyrant any deviation from conformity, no matter <br/>
how apparently small, is a threat that must be wiped out.<br/>
<br/>
We homeschoolers have for a Presidential candidate the governor of <br/>
the most homeschooling-friendly state in the country, opposed by a <br/>
party that has cast its lot with:<br/>
     * the NEA<br/>
     * the feminists, who despise the traditional family<br/>
     * nationalized curricula designed to teach children what they <br/>
should believe<br/>
<br/>
NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO BE COMPLACENT.  NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO SAY, &quot;I <br/>
DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND POLITICS!&quot;  When will we get another opportunity <br/>
like the present?  And if we sit on our hands, what right will we <br/>
have to complain, when Hillary Clinton, who once compared the <br/>
traditional family to SLAVERY, sits on the Supreme Court, as she will <br/>
surely do, should Mr. Gore be elected?<br/>
<br/>
And so I urge you, contact your friends and relatives in other states <br/>
-- those who are friendly to homeschooling.  Ask them to consider, <br/>
this year, whether the freedom of the family is worth preserving.  <br/>
This election will be close!  Of course you must vote as your <br/>
conscience dictates.  But I pray that you will think of homeschooling <br/>
as a touchstone -- as a way of telling what the two parties, and the <br/>
two Presidential nominees, stand for.<br/>
<br/>
Yours,<br/>
<br/>
