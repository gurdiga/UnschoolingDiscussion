<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681298368">I was reading at the Verizon site about how Schools (public and private, <br/>
ect)can get discounted priced services but homeschoolers cannot. I wrote them <br/>
and told them how unfair that was, that I personally would change some or all <br/>
of my services if I could receive the educator/school discount and suggested <br/>
they give homeschoolers the same percentage as the public/private schools in <br/>
their zip code. I will keep all informed of their responses. Lynn F<br/>
