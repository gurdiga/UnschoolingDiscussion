&gt; SC trip.  I have so many questions, but most important:  what do you do <br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; the kids?  Are there seatbelts?  Can/should they sleep in the beds while <br/>
&gt; driving?  What about when they are awake?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

dinette.<br/>
So if you have a sofa and chair, there will be seatbelts there.  Our <br/>
motorhome<br/>
is a bit older so I don&#39;t know if newer ones have seatbelts in the dinette. I<br/>
wish ours did.  I allow the kids to sleep in the back bedroom.  I believe all<br/>
seatbelt laws apply whether you are in a RV or auto, so they should be<br/>
belted in.<br/>
