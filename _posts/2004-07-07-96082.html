<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911730446">Please put some kind of quotation marks on posts when you&#39;re quoting from <br/>
another post.  Some people&#39;s e-mail shows bold face or different colors, but some <br/>
doesn&#39;t.  Even if your quotes are in color, do something.   ----  like that <br/>
maybe -----<br/>
<br/>
or <br/>
+++++ front and back +++++++++<br/>
<br/>
or the time-honored &quot;real quotation marks&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know some mailer programs dont like &lt;&lt;that&gt;&gt; because it turns to a command <br/>
line, but find something you like, please, to make sorting who said what <br/>
easier.  Thanks.<br/>
