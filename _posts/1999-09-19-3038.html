<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078455341"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;maybe that would hep him break out of the rat race he hates so much-- <br/>
&gt;&gt;got any ideas for me to help him get unjobbed?&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Unjobbing book is on my list, but haven&#39;t got to it yet.<br/>
My dh &quot;unjobbed&quot; (though he wasn&#39;t thinking about it that way).  He&#39;s<br/>
been working on a project he loves and believes in for years.  He&#39;s gone<br/>
about 10 hours a day and often goes to his office on weekends for a few<br/>
hours.  We have spent tons of our own $$ on this as well.  The up side is<br/>
that he is happy about what he&#39;s doing.  (I&#39;m the one who sometimes<br/>
wishes he punched a clock for a steady income and was home at 5:00<br/>
everyday!)<br/>
I know people who&#39;ve moved (ie, smaller house or community with lower<br/>
cost of living) in order to have fewer expenses, so that one or both<br/>
parents could spend more time with the kids.<br/>
Or maybe switching to a career that would give him more pleasure even if<br/>
the pay was lower.  (I have a friend who was a teacher, switched to law,<br/>
hates it, but makes *more* $$).  Another friend is a mail carrier - gets<br/>
lots of exercise, loves her job, and is home by 3:00.  I&#39;m sure there are<br/>
lots more examples.<br/>
<br/>
I looked into home day care but the regulations were too big of a hurdle<br/>
for me.  (Many of them are reasonable, but some were ridiculous and I<br/>
didn&#39;t feel like jumping through the hoops.)  But this is a great option<br/>
for some families.<br/>
Hope you all work something out, Rachael!  Let us know.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks mary Ellen, and everyone else for encouraging me.  I guess I forgot <br/>
that someday they will be able to be more independent!  mary Ellen, I wanted <br/>
to tell you, that I dont know your state regualtions but I babysat at home <br/>
for a few years and here, if you have less than 4 kids not including your <br/>
own, you dont have to be considered a registered, regulated, licensed <br/>
babysitter.  You might have a loophole like that one, if you look deep enough.<br/>
<br/>
Thought I would mention it!<br/>
