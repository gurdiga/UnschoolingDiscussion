<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284823384">We got a refurbished early &#39;60&#39;s Electrolux with power nozzle plus bare<br/>
floor attachment, plus other attachments for $200 nine years ago and it is<br/>
still a work horse.  The only problems it had was that it needed a new motor<br/>
for the beater brush (too many long cords getting vaccumed up over the<br/>
years) and it needed some new wheels (from being dropped and beat up by my<br/>
dh) and a new switch (after I smashed the hooey out of it in a fit of<br/>
depression-induced rage).  It has tolerated a lot of abuse.  It&#39;s only<br/>
drawback is that it is heavy and kind of unwieldy in small spaces (our last<br/>
house was 720 sq ft).  But it does a great job!  I think these things run<br/>
forever.<br/>
