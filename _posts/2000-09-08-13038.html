<div id="ygrps-yiv-616443059">We&#39;ve had dogs shipped in from England and a couple of other countries and<br/>
across the U.S.  If you are going to ship an animal, buy your own crate,<br/>
don&#39;t rent one from the airline or other crate rental outfit, it is worth<br/>
the expense!  Go with the animal all the way through the shipping process. <br/>
Do NOT leave until you see it go on the belt.  They don&#39;t like you to do<br/>
this but insist!  If you are there, the crates won&#39;t be switched (a<br/>
frequent happening) and the crate won&#39;t be thrown around like just so much<br/>
luggage.  Some planes have pressurized baggage areas just for animals.  It<br/>
is really best to hold your plans until you can get the furry children on<br/>
one of those!<br/>

&gt; If you&#39;re looking to transport animals overseas, be very careful <br/>
&gt; about the instructions the airline gets about them.  There&#39;s a fly-on-<br/>
&gt; the-wall series over here about Heathrow airport, including the <br/>
&gt; kennels and animal care centre.  Two beautiful Newfoundlands <br/>
&gt; got shipped from Canada (a 12 hour flight) in boxes taht were too <br/>
&gt; small, so they couldn&#39;t lie down.  The bloke who found them was <br/>
&gt; spitting mad!  Basically, when measuring dogs for travel boxes, <br/>
&gt; they&#39;re supposed to take the full head-to-tail length and add the <br/>
&gt; &#39;forearm&#39; length, without which, a dog can&#39;t lie down.  These poor <br/>
&gt; animals had stood up for over 12 hours!!!  ugh!!  Here in the UK, <br/>
&gt; they are trying to bring in &#39;pet passports,&#39; id chips or somesuch to <br/>
&gt; reduce the time spent in Q (and the cost!  yes the owner pays for <br/>
&gt; 6 months kenneling fees...)  And the quarantine regs are so strict <br/>
&gt; for a good reason, rabies is rife in Europe and it&#39;s extremely rare <br/>
&gt; here.<br/>
