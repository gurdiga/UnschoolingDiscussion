<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111663327">Boy, is this topic timely for me...<br/>
<br/>
Coming out of lurkdom... - I have found these lists over the years to<br/>
be enormously helpful in sooo many regards; saying yes, bringing food<br/>
to busy gamers, not freaking out when 14 yo Rachel is still online<br/>
when I get up in the AM (!),  just finding ways to help them do what<br/>
they want to do.   I can honestly say my kids (add 11yo Jake in there)<br/>
 are _happier_ because of these lists, and our home more joyful. <br/>
(thanks!!)<br/>
<br/>
Recently Rachel has told me about a guy (17yo) she met online. (holy<br/>
_moly_ how did she get so grown up so quick?!)     (&quot;Young Wizards&quot;<br/>
Forum - great series by Diane Duane, btw)  We have discussed the<br/>
slight possibility of him not being who he says he is,  etc.  (well,<br/>
I&#39;ve discussed, she just says &quot;I know, mom&quot; with a touch of<br/>
exasperation :-) ) (he lives in Richmond, VA - we&#39;re middle coast NC)<br/>
They&#39;ve talked to each other on the phone a couple of times.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago, when she started going online lots, I was very<br/>
apprehensive about her having her own email, using her own name,<br/>
saying where she lived, and giving out our phone number.  (I went to<br/>
google preferences and removed the reverse address look-up thing for<br/>
our number, but you can still get it through some company that charges<br/>
$15)   So that was a coule of years ago.  Since then I have relaxed<br/>
tons in that regard. Thanks mostly to you guys and the reality of it<br/>
being that there are so many people online _I_ would like to meet in<br/>
person and I know great relationships (friends or otherwise) start<br/>
with knowing someone online. It just makes so much sense to _talk_<br/>
about it - talk about the ins and outs, good and bad,  precautions,<br/>
etc...  Definitley _not_ create rules, or put up boundries (making<br/>
things more attractive...).  She&#39;s got her own email addresses, blog,<br/>
etc.   Apparently, (and unfortunately) though, I didn&#39;t talk enough<br/>
about relaxing my views on things and wasn&#39;t specific in regard to<br/>
phone numbers. It seems she hid the fact that she gave him our number<br/>
(or at least didn&#39;t tell me about it) - I got up in the middle of the<br/>
night (dog pestering to go out) and saw that she was talking to him on<br/>
the phone.  I&#39;m not sure why she did this, we don&#39;t &quot;punish&quot;,<br/>
threaten, even &#39;scold&#39;. But she did say she wasn&#39;t really hiding, but<br/>
rather didn&#39;t want to wake us up (in a back room - I saw the light<br/>
under the door) and they both just happen to be awake at that time of<br/>
day...   <br/>
<br/>
Rachel has always kept things to herself.  Bugs the HECK out of me,<br/>
but I just need to see that&#39;s how she is.  Since she was 7, I&#39;d ask<br/>
&quot;what&#39;s that book about&quot; she&#39;d say &quot;stuff&quot;,  &quot;like what?&quot;, &quot;a girl&quot;, <br/>
etc... &lt;sigh&gt;   Very hard for me. I am a talker.  Dh isn&#39;t though, <br/>
genetics?  lol  <br/>
<br/>
I reiterated the fact that I&#39;m here to *help her with what she wants<br/>
to do*.  I am not an adversary. (not that she thinks that, but just to<br/>
make sure...) I was the one who mentioned if they wanted to meet in<br/>
person, we would figure a way.  Month goes by and she&#39;s taking me up<br/>
on it. :-) They&#39;d like to meet. I don&#39;t have any experience with this<br/>
kind of thing.  I&#39;d like to hear ideas and what others have done.   <br/>
Like the &quot;in public first&quot; thing.  I&#39;d like to get to know the mom a<br/>
bit online or on the phone. (Andrew has done some hs&#39;ing, currently<br/>
taking a couple college courses)  We go through Richmond a couple<br/>
times a year on our way to NY. That might work. (only it&#39;s &quot;June&#39;s so<br/>
far away...&quot;)    I&#39;d also like to ask them to our house for a bbq or<br/>
something...  (I think I watch too much horror stuff on tv...  great<br/>
plot, huh? &quot;mom and dd meet up with online friends only to get<br/>
kidnapped by psychos and tortured in dungeon&quot;  !!)   I _want_ to be a<br/>
trusting soul.  Why do I have the worst case scenario in the back of<br/>
my head?   <br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts or experiences to share would be so appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and, as an aside -- one of the best ideas from this list that I<br/>
put to use --  If there is something that isn&#39;t happening in your area<br/>
start it yourself. Seems simple enough...  There are lots of<br/>
homeschool teens in the area, but nowhere for them to get together to<br/>
hang out.  One woman tries to arrange a monthly activity, usually some<br/>
sort of community service.  But no hanging out afterwards...   So I<br/>
started a teen movie night.  So far it&#39;s worked great. We&#39;ve only done<br/>
it twice so far and had about a dozen kids. I look forward to it as<br/>
much as the kids. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Oh and another aside... (probably should have put these &#39;asides&#39; in a<br/>
different email...)   Jake is 11 and is just starting to read well. <br/>
Paper Mario, Zelda,  and Yugioh cards were (are) his &quot;curriculum&quot;. How<br/>
fun is that? I love telling school at homers that. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry this got so long.  I guess that&#39;s what happens when I only write<br/>
in every three years or so! <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m Rocki with three boys 13, 12, & 10. I have taken the 2 week lurking<br/>
suggestion to 2 months, give or take!<br/>
<br/>
I have to comment on Jake&#39;s &quot;curriculum&quot;, we use it too! &lt;g&gt; My 10yo has<br/>
always loved books on tape and for me to read to him, but not until he found<br/>
Yugioh did he see a need to read for himself. I do spend quite a bit of time<br/>
reading the cards with him and he spends even more time explaining to me<br/>
exactly what I just read! <br/>

Isn&#39;t _that_ the truth!  LOL  They are sooo complicated! (_I_ think,<br/>
anyway)  But he loves them, knows them quite well and will go on and<br/>

such a big deal out of it.  I suppose if I talk to his mom over the<br/>

But that&#39;s all besides the point, since according to Rachel, he&#39;s not<br/>
driving yet.  East coast NC is very touristy.  I suggested his family<br/>
come for a weekend for a touristy thing (as in hotel...).  I have no<br/>
idea how this will all pan out, but I find the whole thing to be very<br/>
cool.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Five or six hours is a long time for him to get a ride - more than a  <br/>
one-day stay. Find a place about halfway - someplace touristy that&#39;ll  <br/>
be fun for both families. You can each drive 3 hours and still spend  <br/>
half the day together, but not make it an overnighter. We&#39;ve done  <br/>
that. This isn&#39;t uncommon, Alice, and so you probably ARE making way  <br/>
too big a deal out of it. Maybe just pretend she met him at some camp  <br/>
or when visiting a friend in his area. I&#39;m thinking you&#39;re freaking  <br/>
out a little just because they met &quot;on the internet.&quot;  No need.<br/>

It seems requiring the family with parents (even suggesting) to get a  <br/>
nearby hotel room is WAY too much unless the kids were engaged.  It&#39;s  <br/>
too big, for teens.  And most families can&#39;t afford it.  It sounds  <br/>
too much to me like formal courtship, or a summons.<br/>
