<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375256186"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;I am afraid I might scare her if I explain what we<br/>
 </span></blockquote>do on a daily basis, <br/>
but I don&#39;t want to be deceptive. Has anyone been in a<br/>
similar situation? <br/>
If so, how did you handle it?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I tell them about deschooling, too, letting them know<br/>
that it&#39;s  well worth the time to read the magazines<br/>
and books and do the internet searches and figure out<br/>
what works for them. But nothing beats meeting people<br/>
and getting face to face support and encouragement.<br/>
I&#39;d send her to homeschool groups and introduce her to<br/>
other homeschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Michigan is a piece of cake to homeschool in for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>now.  We want to keep <br/>
it<br/>
that way!  For those in Michigan that haven&#39;t seen<br/>
this yet read the<br/>
following:&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Wow, that was an eye-opener! When my son was still in<br/>
school, he took the 5th grade MEAP at age 8 (because<br/>
he&#39;d skipped grades) and did well enough to get a<br/>
commendation from the governor. Whoop dee doo. I tell<br/>
you all this not to brag but to assure you the MEAP<br/>
isn&#39;t all that hard a test. HOWEVER! Whether or not<br/>
homeschooled kids will do well on the MEAP is not the<br/>
problem. The problem is having to do something so<br/>
ridiculous. Here&#39;s the thing: each school in Michigan<br/>
gets state funds based on HOW WELL THEY&#39;RE DOING on<br/>
the MEAP. Isn&#39;t that awful? Anyway, what this document<br/>
says is they want to have homeschooled kids&#39; MEAP<br/>
scores included in each district&#39;s batch of scores.<br/>
That&#39;s scary to me beyond the loss of freedom. It<br/>
seems like a) they want to cash in (literally) on the<br/>
success of homeschooling. Ah, homeschooling success<br/>
funding public schools! How ironic! And b)<br/>
homeschooled kids who *don&#39;t* do well are going to get<br/>
a LOT of hassle, just as kids who don&#39;t do well in<br/>
school do. In high school in this state, you take<br/>
those tests over and over and over and over until you<br/>
do well. More irony: wouldn&#39;t you *think* that kids<br/>
who weren&#39;t doing well should be spending their time<br/>
in class instead of repeating the tests? ARGH! So<br/>
completely messed up....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I told her my kids don&#39;t go to school.  She sounded<br/>
 </span></blockquote>surprised.  &quot;They don&#39;t?&quot;  I said they learn at<br/>
home.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
One time a woman asked my daughter if she was skipping<br/>
school. My daughter took it literally and said yes.<br/>
The woman said, &quot;You ARE?&quot; and stared at me. I didn&#39;t<br/>
know what to say so I just smiled. <br/>
<br/>
I used to say we homeschooled, because that&#39;s well<br/>
understood in our area. But now I just say they don&#39;t<br/>
go to school. And recently someone questioned why not <br/>
and I said my kids were autodidacts. The person didn&#39;t<br/>
know what that meant and looked at them with pity. She<br/>
asked more questions that made me realize she thought<br/>
I meant they were AUTISTIC. :) We got that<br/>
misunderstanding straightened out and the woman asked<br/>
my daughter what she likes to study. My daughter said,<br/>
&quot;Right now I like to study ancient Egypt and zoology.&quot;<br/>
Hee hee! That shut the woman up! :)<br/>
<br/>
But what if she&#39;d said she likes to study Archie comic<br/>
books and old Star Trek videos? <br/>
<br/>
What do all your kids say when people ask what grade<br/>
they&#39;re in? Do they just say 3rd if they&#39;re 8, or do<br/>
they start explaining about being homeschooled?<br/>
Because usually people who ask that are just making<br/>
small talk. Is it our responsibility to demystify<br/>
homeschooling by telling everyone we meet we do it? Or<br/>
is it ok to just say 3rd grade?<br/>
<br/>
Juli, who is sorry this is so long.<br/>

**It all depends on the situation. If it&#39;s someone I know and we have time<br/>
to talk (and they act like this isn&#39;t just standard kid questioning) then I<br/>
explain unschooling. If it&#39;s just some person I&#39;ll probably never talk to<br/>
again we give them their grade levels. If I can remember what they are. I&#39;ve<br/>
gotten funny looks when I have to ask the kids.<br/>
