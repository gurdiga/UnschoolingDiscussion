<div id="ygrps-yiv-819116635"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;We both felt that there was fun stuff to do to get the badge, but<br/>

<br/>
In true unschooling fashion, Casey does only the fun stuff and skips the <br/>
dippy. ;-) A lot of the dippy stuff we just check off because we realize <br/>
she&#39;s &quot;covered&quot; it somehow in the course of real life. No Girl Scout <br/>
busywork for us thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Casey really likes working towards goals, so those little badges fill a need <br/>
for her.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
