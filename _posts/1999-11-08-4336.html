other children (boys too!)  <br/>

An uncomfortable sort of, &quot;Oh!  You&#39;re teaching him to be sensative!  Well<br/>
I suppose it&#39;s allright at this age, but he&#39;ll be too old for that sort of<br/>
thing soon.  And you don&#39;t want to encourage that sort of un-masculine<br/>
behavior too long....&quot;<br/>

It really sickens me, and was the last straw for me with that previous<br/>
group.  I mean, why should boys be treated differently simply by virtue of<br/>
the fact that they are boys?  I believe in treating each child as an<br/>
individual and parenting them each to their unique personalities and<br/>
interests, not directing their play and guiding their interests.  Luckily I<br/>
have a very wonderful husband who does not feel that his or his sons&#39;<br/>
masculinity are threatented in any way by being sensative, showing emotion,<br/>
or doubt, being caring and affectionate, etc.  Our boys play rough and<br/>
tumble sometimes, but they are just as likely to want a cuddle, to nurture<br/>
or parent their dolls or stuffed animals, or play cooking as they are to<br/>
play sports or build with blocks.  I hope to raise them to be well rounded<br/>
and whole men, not particularly macho men.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120275040">Both my boys love their babies.  They play with them differently than my<br/>
daughter does, but they do enjoy them.<br/>
I never encouraged them to play with or hid dolls from them.  They both want<br/>
carriers and beds for their babies.  Hubby slightly disapproves, but not enough<br/>
to say anything.  I think his feelings are just throw backs to the way he was<br/>
raised.  He&#39;s learning  :)<br/>
My four yr old in particular is very nurturing.  I love seeing him like this.<br/>
He is also the one that is *ell on wheels too!  Interesting.<br/>
And, after all, they will most likely grow up to be Daddies some day!<br/>

do you already know that the people who make slings also make kidslings?  i <br/>
know you asked for a back carrier, my mum made some for my kids, simple <br/>
pattern she created... just a strap with a plastic ring on either end for <br/>
around the waist attached to a square piece (goes on the dolls front) and <br/>
side straps that go over the shoulders and cross in front, lace thru the <br/>
rings and tie.  anyway, in case you dont find one and you or someone you know <br/>
is handy w/sewing machine, good luck!<br/>
