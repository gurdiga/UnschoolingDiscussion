<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336580912">Over the past week or two my son (age 4-1/2) has been discovering a <br/>
surprising number of physics principles in his play.  Running round and round <br/>
in a big empty room, he noticed that he can keep his feet toward the outside <br/>
of the circle and tilt his upper body way toward the center without falling <br/>
over...centrifugal force, right?  He could spend hours blowing up balloons <br/>
and watching them wiggle away as the air comes out, switching to balloon <br/>
powered lego car, and balloon attached to straws on a string so it jets from <br/>
one end of the string to the other...equal and opposite reaction?  Now he&#39;s <br/>
fully into making ramps and rolling a variety of things down them from <br/>
different heights, different angles.<br/>
<br/>
He was really into the centrifugal force thing yesterday, so we put water in <br/>
a container, suspended it from a string, and were able to spin it like a <br/>
lasso overhead without the water falling out.  He thought this was absolutely <br/>
hysterical and amazing....and he enjoyed getting wet when he didn&#39;t spin it <br/>
fast enough!  I also mentioned the clothes against the washing machine drum <br/>
after it&#39;s done spinning, so of course we had to go and peek in during a load.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are amusement park physics type books, and this previously <br/>
physics-phobic mom would like to check out an introductory physics <br/>
book/website for background info and possibly some fun activity ideas.  <br/>
(Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong and these phenomena don&#39;t actually fall into <br/>
*physics* category....I&#39;m guessing!)  Suggestions please?                     <br/>

K-9 -- Beverley A.P. Taylor, et al; and<br/>
Toying Around With Science : The Physics Behind Toys and Gags -- Robert<br/>
Friedhoffer, et al.  Both are available through Amazon and elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a neat piece of software, Virtual Physics, but it&#39;s pegged for kids<br/>
from about 12 and up so it might be a stretch at this point.  However, there<br/>
used to be others because I remember using them when my kids were 8 and 9.<br/>
Gizmos and Gadgets was a favorite; it doesn&#39;t directly teach physics<br/>
concepts but it provides lots of hands-on experience with them.<br/>
<br/>
You can do a lot of really good physics experiences with ordinary materials.<br/>
One thing you might want to look around for is one of those toy pool tables.<br/>
Great for getting to know Newton.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun--<br/>

&lt;&lt; is it good to point out what <br/>
 type of &quot;educational&quot; things they are learning in their play? Should I step <br/>
 in and identify or wait until they ask questions? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it depends on the child AND on the way the info is given.  For <br/>
instance, a couple of days when my son was running in circles, tilted inward, <br/>
and noted that he wasn&#39;t falling down, I said, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s really cool.  I <br/>
wonder why that happens.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
When he continued to be interested in the same phenomenon the next day and <br/>
the day after that, I said, &quot;Hmmm...that reminds me of an experiment I saw, <br/>
where you can spin a bucket of water over your head and the water won&#39;t fall <br/>
out.  Wanna try it?&quot;  (Still no official terms, just fun exploration.)  He <br/>
responded with great enthusiasm, and when we were reading the experiment <br/>
instructions together, I said, &quot;Oh, it says here that&#39;s called centrifugal <br/>
force.  Neat!&quot;  He said the word a few times and we used it in conversation <br/>
more while watching the clothes spin in the washing machine.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s okay to put a name with the __whatever__ if the interest is <br/>
there, as long as it doesn&#39;t serve to separate the &quot;educational aspect&quot; from <br/>
the fact that it&#39;s a neat thing to mess around with.  Of course, I also don&#39;t <br/>
think it&#39;s inappropriate to leave the official terms out of the play.  He has <br/>
been playing Logical Journey of the Zoombinis for almost a year now and has <br/>
no idea about x-axis and y-axis, graphing, probability, and all the other <br/>
algebraic (algebra, right?) functions encompassed by that program.  I figure <br/>
those terms can come later and he&#39;ll have great experiences on which to tack <br/>
the terms for REAL knowledge and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Also I think it&#39;s important to beware of jumping on an interest and turning <br/>
it into a unit study, thus scaring the kid away from expressing future <br/>
interests.  Like, I want to find out more about basic physics so I can pull <br/>
out that information when and *if* it fits into our lives and HIS interest.  <br/>
If it does, that&#39;s cool.  If it doesn&#39;t, now or in the future, then at least <br/>
I will have likely learned something new about physics in the process -- <br/>
assuming that the recommended books are fun and interesting!  ;-)<br/>

<br/>
it depends. sometimes i do and soemtimes i dont. i might say, wow that is<br/>
an interesting idea a man named frankin experimented with electricity too.<br/>
if he looked okayw ith it i might tell him fmore or ask him if we should<br/>
find out more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it is a potential way of extinguishing the love of learning which is at the heart of<br/>
unschooling.  Pointing out the educational aspects of something is confused to begin with as is<br/>
pointed out below i.e.  everything is educational.  The setting of &quot;educational&quot; priorities is<br/>
something that the learner and the world, interacting together establish.  Being able to<br/>
recognize what I need to know, need to learn, am interested in learning are the most important<br/>
skills.  A person doesn&#39;t ever really get them if someone is overtly or covertly directing<br/>
their learning. It is of course very hard to avoid because most of us have been &quot;schooled&quot; half<br/>
to death and hardly know what it looks like or feels like to be self-directed in one&#39;s<br/>
activities.  This self-direction is never in a void... it is in the context of one&#39;s family,<br/>
friends and community which is different for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Self-direction is (contrary to lots of propaganda) at odds with our culture insofar as<br/>
obedience to authority is one of the main underpinnings of our consumer /consuming society.<br/>
<br/>
There I feel better getting that off my chest. JH<br/>
