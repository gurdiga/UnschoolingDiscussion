<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797410812">Hi again...<br/>
<br/>
Mrs.Find-A-New-Idea-And-Focus-On-It-To-The-Exclusion-Of-All-Else. <br/>
That&#39;s me. <br/>
<br/>
This is what I want to do today: after our morning Bible time, which <br/>
we do together, I want to head downstairs and workout while the kids <br/>
clean their rooms. This needs doing, and I intend that they get it <br/>
done. Hopefully, the backhoe I&#39;ll be renting for the job won&#39;t cost <br/>
TOO much! L <br/>
<br/>
After Richard Simmons and a shower, I want to get out the Crystal <br/>
Growing kit they&#39;ve been hankering to mess around with, and get some <br/>
crystals started growing. This fits right in with the science lesson <br/>
set up for Robby for today. Then I want to do Katie&#39;s science lesson, <br/>
which she&#39;s been asking me to get on with, which I&#39;ve been <br/>
putting off...you see, our mornings have been eaten up with &quot;doing <br/>
Math&quot; &quot;finishing vocabulary&quot; &quot;working on phonics&quot; and by lunchtime of <br/>
each day, I&#39;m WIPED OUT and TIRED OF KIDS, because I&#39;ve had to <br/>
continually remind them to &quot;stay on task.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Oh, let me say...this year, I made the dread mistake of signing on <br/>
with K12. It might be perfect for some people, but it really isn&#39;t my <br/>
style, which I knew very near the beginning of the school year. Let <br/>
me also say, after I get done posting this, I&#39;m going to be emailing <br/>
the K12 people and asking their advice &quot;We&#39;ve decided we won&#39;t be <br/>
continuing with K12 next year. Should we drop now, and send back the <br/>
curriculum materials, or should we continue in the curriculum, <br/>
choosing what looks good to us and ignoring the rest?&quot; (In case you <br/>
didn&#39;t know, K12 sends TONS of very cool materials for science and <br/>
art, along with all the curriculum pages and books for Math, Language <br/>
Arts, Phonics, History, and Music)<br/>
<br/>
If you know someone who is thinking K12, and they ask your advice... <br/>
well, *I&#39;d* definitely advise against it, unless they are a very goal <br/>
oriented, task oriented family. Which we are not. <br/>
<br/>
After we do some science experiments together, I&#39;m going to bake <br/>
bread and...Katie will want to help with that. Abbie will want to sit <br/>
and peruse her Two Towers Pictorial guide or read another Xanth book. <br/>
Robby...computer game, for sure! LOL<br/>
<br/>
In my thinking of the past few days, one thing that&#39;s surfaced: much <br/>
that I know, I either &quot;got it&quot; as an adult, or learned from reading <br/>
books as a child...reading with my head resting on my desk in school, <br/>
a book open in my lap, while the teacher &quot;taught&quot; whatever subject. <br/>
Reading from my dad&#39;s natural science library, in bed at night. <br/>
Reading in the front room completely oblivious to the world. Reading <br/>
itself, I was never taught...just picked it up from being read aloud <br/>
to and one day astonished my parents by reading to them from a <br/>
favorite book &quot;In the City and On the Farm&quot; when I was about 5. <br/>
<br/>
So, the things that you people have been discussing here, and in the <br/>
readings I&#39;ve found on other websites, such as letting the child pick <br/>
up reading by providing a book-rich environment...this happened to <br/>
me, it virtually happened with my daughter and my son (though they <br/>
did have reading lessons and picked it up fast)...<br/>
<br/>
When I read things like &quot;children will really know something that <br/>
they have pursued because of genuine interest&quot; and realize this, <br/>
also, has happened in my life and my daughter&#39;s life...makes me stop <br/>
and think, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, time to go. <br/>
<br/>
thanks for providing a venue for my pondering!<br/>
<br/>
blessings, Heidi</div>

Just wondering...are you an unschooler on this list?  Or wanting to be an <br/>
unschooler?<br/>
Just wondering because your post doesn&#39;t really fit in with unschooling, so I <br/>
was curious?<br/>

Why would you ask them?  Are they giving you &quot;credits&quot; or something?<br/>
What if they say &quot;NO, you canNOT pick and choose what seems good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What authority do they have to tell you how to use their materials?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess it would depend on whether she is legally a homeschooler or <br/>
if this allows her to be considered a private schooler or if it&#39;s a <br/>
public cyber charter school program.  <br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s a homeschooler then of course she can pick and choose.  If <br/>
she&#39;s getting around compulsory attendence laws by being with them, <br/>
depending on the laws of her state and what the penalties are for <br/>
truancy/educational neglect, then it might not be worth messing with.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Argh! This is whay my friend says, too! L No, they&#39;re not giving us <br/>
credits or anything, just &quot;advancing&quot; us if we complete a certain <br/>
percentage. (shudder. I can&#39;t EVEN believe I chose this) And, since <br/>
I&#39;m not using K12 next year, it shouldn&#39;t matter whether we advance. <br/>
so, you have sort of answered the question...But I am still going to <br/>
inform them that we&#39;re dropping, so that we don&#39;t come to June 10 <br/>
(when school ends) and have &quot;failure&quot; and here&#39;s why I don&#39;t want <br/>
that...<br/>
<br/>
The public school mentality is rampant in this thing. It is a charter <br/>
school, and they do have paid, certified teachers to &quot;help&quot; us. <br/>
(Ugh!) and I think it would be bad to have a veteran homeschooling <br/>
family &quot;not make it&quot;...so, we need to let them know that it&#39;s a <br/>
decision we&#39;ve made.<br/>
<br/>
As for K12 and Idaho Virtual Academy telling me &quot;no,&quot; they did when I <br/>
enrolled, and wanted Katie to do 1st grade work, even though she&#39;s <br/>
eight. No can do...but they did &quot;allow&quot; us to sign on with 1st grade <br/>
math and phonics, when I explained that she hadn&#39;t had any formal <br/>
education at all up to then, except she knew the sounds of her <br/>
letters, and how to write her numbers. Second Grade everything else.<br/>
<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
whew! my brain&#39;s frying. New ideas, different thoughts (though not <br/>
really SO different from my style of educating)<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>
