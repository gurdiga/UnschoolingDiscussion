<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319112749">&quot;Twins joined at the head occur only once in every two million live births, <br/>
and successful separation is even rarer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From AOL&#39;s front-page news story today, about the in-progress operation in <br/>
Singapore to separate 29 year old adult conjoined twins.  Female, law graduates <br/>
from Iran.<br/>
<br/>
But as to the math...<br/>
<br/>
If the successful separations were exactly that figure, that would be <br/>
impressive.<br/>
If it were more common then WOW.<br/>
