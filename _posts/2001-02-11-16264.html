<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399017765">&lt;&lt; Anyway, I think you are a source of information but come on a little too <br/>
heavy-handed for my taste, especially to newbies who may actully need some <br/>
comfirmation, even if you don&#39;t whole-heartedly agree with all they are <br/>
doing, as they try to wend their way to being full-fledged (or not) <br/>
unschoolers.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I were the only source of information or confirmation, that would make me <br/>
feel I needed to change my methods.  Fortunately, there are WAY more <br/>
nurturing, cooing, welcoming types than there are those who will say &quot;Hey, <br/>
that&#39;s not going to work&quot; as they look over the shoulders of new unschoolers <br/>
who have come to an unschooling site to learn how to unschool.  <br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t make a difference ANYWHERE between unschooling and not <br/>
unschooling, there will be no difference between unschooling and sending kids <br/>
to school.  Somewhere the line is.  Not exactly the same place for everyone, <br/>
but even if we average out everyone&#39;s lines there comes to be a &quot;you&#39;re <br/>
getting cold&quot; zone in which if people turn and go the other direction they <br/>
are getting warmer.<br/>
<br/>
There have honestly, truly, been people who have come to unschooling <br/>
discussion areas and demanded for people to admit they were unschoolers even <br/>
though they had a curriculum, or were making their kids do math or making <br/>
them write book reports, or even (seriously) that their kids were back in <br/>
school, but they REALLY really (why?) wanted to be declared, certified <br/>
&quot;unschoolers&quot; and would tear people up to try to get that.  Some people would <br/>
say &quot;Okay, then.  You&#39;re unschooling in your heart and that&#39;s what&#39;s <br/>
important.&quot;   I would say, &quot;NO, in your heart, you&#39;re a looney.&quot;  Because I <br/>
have a great interest in defending the integrity of the idea of unschooling. <br/>
en unschooling becomes a mush of vagueness which people cannot recognize, <br/>
want, do or defend.  <br/>
<br/>
As, it seems, I&#39;m one of the few who is brave enough to say to a stranger or <br/>
an in-person friend, &quot;If you tell him he couldn&#39;t learn to read without you <br/>
teaching him, why won&#39;t he think you have to teach him history and science?&quot; <br/>
then I do that.  And some people think it&#39;s too heavy handed to say &quot;You <br/>
might want to look at what you&#39;re doing with a critical eye and change it, or <br/>
you might want to stop saying you&#39;re unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Someone in the forum said she didn&#39;t have time to explain things to her kids <br/>
and she thought it was bad parenting to let kids figure stuff out on their <br/>
own.  That is not unschooling.   Some people have said they unschool in the <br/>
summer, but during the school year they use structure.  That is not <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we&#39;re back to the honesty and truth thing again.  But we&#39;re to <br/>
clarity and definitions even more.  Some things are vague and some things <br/>
aren&#39;t.  The edge of a foggy, swampy lake is not as distinct as the edge of a <br/>
puddle in the sunshine in the desert.  Some people WANT unschooling to be an <br/>
indistinct marshy area between school and wherever they are most comfortable <br/>
being without too much thought.  It&#39;s not.  It&#39;s not school-like and it&#39;s not <br/>
school-parallel or school-based.  The sooner people clear their vision and <br/>
stop looking through the fog toward the school, the sooner they&#39;ll be <br/>
operational in unschooling.  I don&#39;t see it doing anyone a favor to tell them <br/>
to take their time in that swamp and come on out when they want to.  They <br/>
can&#39;t come out until they want to, but sometimes they hear a sound on the <br/>
non-school side that makes them turn and look.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do. <br/>
 Make it clearer and more attractive and more understandable so they don&#39;t <br/>
waste time foundering around unnecessarily.  I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s <br/>
direct, either, which is good! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I&#39;m not clear. Did you mean letting kids figure things out on their own is <br/>
not unschooling? Or feeling the need to answer all their questions is not <br/>
unschooling?<br/>

<br/>
You were clear.   I wrote very unclearly; sorry.  <br/>
<br/>
What I badly wrote was &lt;&lt; Someone in the forum said she didn&#39;t have time to <br/>
explain things to her kids and she thought it was bad parenting to let kids <br/>
figure stuff out on their own.  That is not unschooling.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Someone argued in favor of just telling kids what to do without explanations <br/>
until they&#39;re old enough (i.e. grown) to understand why you told them what <br/>
you told them.  Explanations were not for her; she had a life.  (Implication <br/>
was all the implication about OUR lack of lives since most of the rest of us <br/>
kinda thought explaining things to kids was fun, and good, and a friendly <br/>
mom-thing, and that being with and near them while they experimented and <br/>
figured things out was even MORE fun.)<br/>
