<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782696438">Hi. I would love to hear from those that have chosen not to vaccine their<br/>
children and college entry strategies. My oldest son is almost 16 and is<br/>
getting ready to consider college. I am concerned about colleges requiring<br/>
vaccinations. Anyone out there with a successful story of entering college<br/>
and remaining vaccine-free?<br/>

the religious exemption form of your state.<br/>

I don&#39;t have a success story, but I understand you can use the religious <br/>
exemption for college entry.  It has been deemed unconstitutional for the school, <br/>
or the government for that matter, to ask any questions regarding your <br/>
religion.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-593583183">I did. I refused to get vaccinated yet once again for my MA and PhD. <br/>
Here in the state of NY you can sign a waiver not just for religious <br/>
reasons. I can&#39;t remember the term but it was something akin to the <br/>
&quot;conscientious abjector&quot; military clause.<br/>
