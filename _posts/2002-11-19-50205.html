 I guess the reason I wrote about this to the list is that now many people I <br/>
know are going to use my friend as an example of how unschooling doesn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;work&quot;, and I&#39;m trying to get my thoughts together so that I can respond <br/>
clearly when the topic comes up.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s great to ponder this ahead of time so as to give concise and <br/>
clear responses when/if it comes up.<br/>
I also think the answer is very clear in this case, she wasn&#39;t unschooling.<br/>
So how can she say it doesn&#39;t work?  If the concern is all about fitting into <br/>
school at some point, then unschooling can&#39;t unfold in the beautiful way you <br/>
read about here.<br/>
She won&#39;t see that, but at least you can point out that she wasn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

(Maybe someone else can come up with a fairer way to phrase this without<br/>
losing its punch.)<br/>
<br/>
If people lamented to me &quot;Tsk, tsk, look at how Esmerelda&#39;s son didn&#39;t<br/>
learn anything when they were unschooling&quot;, I&#39;d want to ask, firmly, --<br/>
&quot;Did she unschool or did she just sit there?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This can prompt a follow-up conversation about what unschooling involves<br/>
beyond just adopting a relaxed attitude and waiting to see results.<br/>
