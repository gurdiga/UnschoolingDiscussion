<div id="ygrps-yiv-730808793">Been reading everyone&#39;s posts with interest.  The only requirement in Arizona <br/>
for homeschooling is to file an Affidavit of Intent to Home School with the <br/>
School Superintendent&#39;s Office.  There is no legal requirement to even do <br/>
that until your child is 8, in this state.   We do not have to document, keep <br/>
logs, portfolios, get tested, be under umbrella schools, enroll in anything.  <br/>
The parents don&#39;t have to be licensed, have a degree, pass some test or <br/>
anything.  I think that AZ has to be near the top of the list when it comes <br/>
to the laws on homeschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699098108">Texas is very easy to. If you homechool it is considered a private school. No notifying, tests, documents, contact ,etc. ever. We access the public school for speech for 1 of my sons. All the paper work that is normally filled out by a child&#39;s teacher is filled out by me. No questions asked. No requirements for parents either. <br/>
