This must be so hard for you.  Your mother is lucky to have you helping her, although given her condition, she might not be able to appreciate that.<br/>

Sending you hugs,<br/>

  ----- snip-----I leave Wednesday to drive down to Washington, grab my mother, and take her<br/>
  to a geriatric psych ward for an evaluation.  Her dementia is getting worse<br/>
  fast, and she&#39;s started hitting people where she lives. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Mary Ellen.  Actually, at this point she still does appreciated it.<br/>
It&#39;s sure been interesting exchanging roles with her.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I talked yesterday with a woman who runs an adult family home.  I was<br/>
intrigued when she asked if my mother had been a good mama to me.  She had<br/>
lots of neat things to say about how she relates to older people.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know if we&#39;ll choose that one though.  She started dropping little hints<br/>
that she&#39;s a heavy duty Christian.  I&#39;m actually hoping that she did it<br/>
because she thought somehow that I was.  If that&#39;s the case, she might be<br/>
able to refrain from preaching or doing the Christian dance around my<br/>
mother, a lifelong atheist.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t move her in there.<br/>
