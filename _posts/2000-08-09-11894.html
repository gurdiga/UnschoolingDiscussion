&lt;&lt; aming 3-year-old. I would not have believed <br/>
 without hearing the squeals, shrieks and glass-shattering screeches that <br/>
 emanate from my little blond angel. It does, to say  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then, if it makes you feel any better :), there is my 7 yo son.  Who has <br/>
discovered how to lower his voice and sound really, really LOUD!  I think he <br/>
startled himself the first time he realized how growly he can sound but now <br/>
pulls out his &quot;scary monster&quot; voice when the world is not going his way!<br/>
<br/>
Are we having fun yet??  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143827031">LOL!! I&#39;m blessed with both the growly 7 year old and the<br/>
squealing/screeching train whistle 3 year old. AAAHH!! Those nice little<br/>
take home baby packages are ill-equiped.  I&#39;d take a pair of ear plugs over<br/>
baby booties any day! ;-)<br/>
