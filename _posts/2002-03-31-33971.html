&gt; sausage recipes.  &quot;And, Momma, tell them I&#39;m not looking for any of those <br/>
&gt; packaged type things.  I&#39;d really like to get some that maybe their <br/>
&gt; grandparents made.  Ya know, the real stuff without all the chemicals in <br/>
&gt; it.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband has moved us into the REAL foods without processing stuff in it <br/>
and its been a great switch.  I&#39;m actually losing a bit of weight at the same <br/>
time.  Your post made me think of the book and I want to suggest it as a <br/>
possible source to find some REAL sausage recipes without all the junk in it <br/>
that processed foods have.  The books is entitled &quot;Nourishing Traditions&quot; and <br/>
is written by Sally Fallon.  I had no trouble finding a copy of it for him a <br/>
few months ago.<br/>
I hope that this helps your son and anyone else interested in getting away <br/>
from the boxed food stuff that we relied upon before and have found ourselves <br/>
not missing at all since moving into more natural foods!<br/>
