&lt;&lt; Sometimes I&#39;ll read the fix-it books - and I&#39;ll get discouragd because I <br/>
have <br/>
 so LITTLE background and have to go back and figure out what so many things <br/>
 mean before I can possibly understand. And - shopping in a big place like <br/>
 home depot is hard - it is hard to even know what to ask for when you don&#39;t <br/>
 know what you&#39;re doing.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pam haven&#39;t you caught the Home Depot commercials where the son asks<br/>
a father to build a treehouse, says dad can do anything, dad goes to Home<br/>
Depot says I have no idea how to do this? and the Home Depot guy says<br/>
this is what you need and hey were even teaching a class on xyz <br/>
Saturday !!! LOL  We have gone to the Home Depot kid classes and <br/>
they are fun, but very basic.  They are sort of like those kits. You get<br/>
the pieces, pre-cut/shaped and you glue and hammer.  Which is fine,<br/>
but she will probably want more after a time or two.  I have a book<br/>
I got from Half.com called Carpentry for Children by Lester Walker.<br/>
Its really rather cool with lots of drawings and pictures and projects.<br/>
Tells you what tools you need, how to use them, building your<br/>
workshop, one day projects, one week projects.  The builders in<br/>
this book were four children ages 10, 11, 12, 13. And frankly,<br/>
they look like a bunch of unschoolers &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m kidding... but no, I haven&#39;t seen those commercials, to be honest.<br/>
<br/>
REALLY basic would be good - as soon as I read your post that the home depot <br/>
classes are really basic, I relaxed and immediately realized that I was <br/>
already worrying that they&#39;d be too advanced &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll also look for that book - sounds great. Thank you.<br/>

I guess Pam doesn&#39;t watch enough TV, or else they&#39;re not showing those <br/>
commercials on the BBC America or ESPN or PBS.  (They&#39;re snobs, y&#39;know... &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
More reasons for Pam to come to Albuquerque:<br/>
Holly needs a black and white portrait (Roya could do that).<br/>
The Santa Fe Opera... (for Roxana)<br/>
and <br/>
KEITH&#39;S WOODWORKING STUFF!  <br/>
joiner! table saw!  router and dremmel and carving tools!!  (Rosie!  Come on <br/>
down!!!)<br/>
<br/>
(but we have no cable TV...)</div>

cable tv for a SHORT visit &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
