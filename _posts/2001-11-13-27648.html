<div id="ygrps-yiv-810048400">Ice sculptures are fun! Take a plastic storage box<br/>
(like you put toys in), fill it with water & leave it<br/>
out overnight (or however long it takes to freeze<br/>
solid!). When you&#39;re ready to sculpt, take a kettle<br/>
with warm to hot (but NOT boiling!) water out and pour<br/>
over the box (turn it upside down first). The ice<br/>
block will pop out (with some pressure on the bottom<br/>
of the box) and voila you are ready for zee artistic<br/>
process! Clay sculpting tools work great, but we have<br/>
also used  swiss army knives, paring knives, ice picks<br/>
(or nail starters), chisels, saws, hammers, etc (you<br/>
are only limited by your imagination!). Also you can<br/>
add food colouring to the pre-frozen water for a nice<br/>
effect. Of course, you could always go to the store<br/>
and buy an ice block, but somehow it takes away some<br/>
of the fun of it for me. Have fun!<br/>
