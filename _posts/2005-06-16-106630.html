Some of  the laziest adults I know were made to do a LOT of chores and heavy  <br/>
 <br/>
yardwork and wood hauling, etc., when they were kids.  And the one  who is  <br/>
THE <br/>
most industrious and concerned about his house and yard  and car is the one  <br/>
we used to tease because his mom picked his  laundry up and brought it back  <br/>
folded and put it in his drawers for  him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
************************************************<br/>
So, there was this guy who always hated doing chores when he was a kid. He  <br/>
complained, and said, &quot;I can&#39;t wait until I grow up and never have to do  <br/>
chores.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
So he grows up, and it&#39;s great. He never does any chores, and one day looks  <br/>
around and says to himself, &quot;Man, this place is a mess. I gotta get me some  <br/>
kids.&quot;<br/>
