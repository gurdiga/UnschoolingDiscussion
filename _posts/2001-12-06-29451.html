I truly do have resentment against a poster or two on this list.  I have so<br/>
enjoyed the list, and have enjoyed the &quot;personalities&quot; on it from the great<br/>
AOL days.  I would say that I tend to read a few of the posters through &quot;a<br/>
glass darkly&quot; and that it isn&#39;t one of my more flattering behaviors.<br/>
