&gt; Stephanie, without meaning to totally offend<br/>
&gt; (sorry!), is your husband<br/>
&gt; totally nuts?  He&#39;s willing to sacrifice you<br/>
&gt; baby&#39;s/child&#39;s/future<br/>
&gt; adult&#39;s health?  I firmly believe that if someone is<br/>
&gt; educated in the<br/>
&gt; true merits of breastfeeding there would be no<br/>
&gt; &quot;choice&quot; in infant<br/>
&gt; nutrition.  It is absolutely the most superior<br/>
&gt; wonder food in existence<br/>
&gt; on the planet and no informed person could possibly<br/>
&gt; deny that for their<br/>
&gt; child.  It&#39;s like choosing to eat scraps from the<br/>
&gt; dumpster instead of<br/>
&gt; opting for tasty, delicious and healthy food in your<br/>
&gt; own well-stocked<br/>
&gt; kitchen.  No one who has the choice chooses dumpster<br/>
&gt; food!  Not only<br/>
&gt; will nursing supply your baby with an immune system<br/>
&gt; and sustain your<br/>
&gt; child even through illness (it&#39;s the perfect<br/>
&gt; medicinal food when your<br/>
&gt; baby has a cold or diarrhea or is vomiting) but the<br/>
&gt; health benefits last<br/>
&gt; well into adulthood.  Lower rates of allergies,<br/>
&gt; sensitivities, diabetes,<br/>
&gt; even cancers.  This is all well documented.  Babies<br/>
&gt; fed ARTIFICIAL food<br/>
&gt; such as formula, or worse, COW&#39;S MILK have higher<br/>
&gt; statistics on<br/>
&gt; everything negative except maybe brain development. <br/>
&gt; Which has been<br/>
&gt; well-documented for breast-fed babies:  higher<br/>
&gt; intelligence for the<br/>
&gt; amino acids present in breast milk.  No formula can<br/>
&gt; replicate that!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sorry to be on this tirade but I positively see<br/>
&gt; red when I see<br/>
&gt; people think there is a &quot;choice&quot; and usually for the<br/>
&gt; sake of unimportant<br/>
&gt; and temporary situations such as convenience or<br/>
&gt; lifestyle.  How can any<br/>
&gt; loving parent deny their child what is clearly<br/>
&gt; theirs?  Boy, have the<br/>
&gt; formula companies or, dare I say it, the radical<br/>
&gt; feminists, really<br/>
&gt; snowed us that much, all these years?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure I&#39;m making a few enemies tonight with these<br/>
&gt; views but 10 solid<br/>
&gt; years of research into the subject have brought me<br/>
&gt; to these conclusions.<br/>
&gt; Yes, most babies will grow according to the growth<br/>
&gt; charts<br/>
&gt; (interestingly-enough supplied by the formula<br/>
&gt; companies) when fed by<br/>
&gt; artificial means, but most of the time we are<br/>
&gt; forfeiting quality for<br/>
&gt; quantity (the pounds babies gain).  People can seem<br/>
&gt; to grow and gain<br/>
&gt; weight eating dumpster food too...Formula is made of<br/>
&gt; &quot;Scraps&quot; and<br/>
&gt; by-products:  leftover and sour milk processed into<br/>
&gt; powders, the lowest<br/>
&gt; grades of corn syrup, coconut and palm oils<br/>
&gt; (recognized poison for the<br/>
&gt; heart) and a few fake versions of vitamins. <br/>
&gt; Mechanically-produced and<br/>
&gt; rarely efficiently absorbed by the system. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As I say, there is no true choice.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; League?<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am very interested in LLL. My dh is not<br/>
