<div id="ygrps-yiv-199474522">I need to do US History for my son next year and have gotten most<br/>
of what I want to cover the course but there is one area I need<br/>
some advice on the 20th century. My son has ADD and is a very<br/>
visual learner so I want to do as much with video tapes as<br/>
possible<br/>
and I was wondering if anyone has any reccomendations for videos<br/>
that would cover the 20th century section?<br/>
Thanks in Advanve  and God Bless<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-194521658">&lt;&lt;&lt;Does anyone have any suggestions about good books to read on that?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Joy Hakim&#39;s series (10 or 12 books) called The History of US, found in most any bookstore.<br/>
