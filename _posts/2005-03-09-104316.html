<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062820186">I&#39;ve been a member of this group on and off for a while. I really <br/>
enjoy reading all the advice and how-to&#39;s.Here&#39;s why I&#39;m at my wits <br/>
end. We had been learning at home since about 2nd grade with my son <br/>
Chris. Last fall he wanted to go back to school. He&#39;s 10 now and I <br/>
really think he thought he was missing something even though we did a <br/>
lot of different stuff. I&#39;m not one to sit around at home. I tried to <br/>
talk him out of it but this was something he really wanted to do. So <br/>
off he went to school. In the beginning it was fun. He liked meeting <br/>
the kids and doing the fun stuff about school.But now the teachers <br/>
are getting at him to work harder and get his homework done and <br/>
turned in. I help him with all this but it&#39;s something he hates to <br/>
do. He has a lot of trouble with his handwriting. The teachers are <br/>
really on him about being neat and he trys but it&#39;s really hard for <br/>
him. They even put him in 3rd (he&#39;s supposed to be in 4th) because of <br/>
his handwriting and they give the MEAPs in 4th and there are essays <br/>
to write and I think they thought he&#39;d bring thier curve down. Anyway <br/>
in the last couple of monthes he&#39;s started to lie to me about what he <br/>
has to get done and homework. This bothers me most of all. He never <br/>
had to lie to me before. This morning I got a call from the principal <br/>
as soon as I got home from dropping him off. She said he was in her <br/>
office because he wasn&#39;t finshing his work in class or doing his <br/>
homework. She said he was going to stay there until he finished and <br/>
then he could go to class. If it was just up to me I would of taken <br/>
him out months ago but my husband wants him to finish the school <br/>
year. My husband doesn&#39;t get unschooling even though I try and show <br/>
him. He thinks you have to go to school to learn what they teach and <br/>
I&#39;m the total opposite.I see it everyday with Chris when he&#39;s not in <br/>
school and his brother Colt who&#39;s 4. I just don&#39;t know what to do. <br/>
It&#39;s going against my grain to make Chris do these things. I can&#39;t <br/>
really back up a teacher or principal if I don&#39;t believe in what <br/>
their doing. This is all so stressful on Chris too that he doesn&#39;t <br/>
learn anything anyway. I guess after all this I&#39;m just looking for <br/>
some advice or works of encouragement. I think it&#39;s going to be a <br/>
rough day for everybody.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441579634">Dear lori. i feel for you. that is one of the reason<br/>
why i pulled my kids out of public schools. I really<br/>
don&#39;t have any suggestions only stay by your son. What<br/>
ever he decides he will make up his mind one way or<br/>
anouther. my kids seem to be thriving on<br/>
homeschooling. and they are makeing better grades and<br/>
doing more reading and writting. than they did in<br/>
school. im sorry if this does not help you. but i<br/>
really do know what you are going threw. nancy in<br/>

You didn&#39;t mention what your son wants to do about all this - what does <br/>
he say?<br/>

If your son *wants* to leave the school, and it certainly sounds like it is<br/>
becoming a toxic experience for him, I hope you can convince your dh to let<br/>
him stop now, before more damage to your various relationships is done.<br/>
However if your dh will absolutely not agree to now, but does agree to at<br/>
the end of the school year, perhaps it will give your ds some heart and hope<br/>
of he knows that it is not going to be forever. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t *make* him do these things. Ask if he wants some help with the<br/>
temporary hoops he must go through. Let the teachers know that he has your<br/>
support, and perhaps explain (depending on your State laws) that you will be<br/>
making other arrangements next school year for Chris&#39;s education. That might<br/>
take the pressure off them to &quot;make&quot; him do the work they feel is necessary.<br/>

Here&#39;s what my sister did when the school was making her very crazy:   <br/>
detached from it emotionally.  She didn&#39;t support and back up  teachers.  She gave <br/>
her kids the option of participating or not, and she  wasn&#39;t their <br/>
lieutenant/deputy/enforcer anymore.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106156740">I just wanted to let everybody know that we took Chris out of school <br/>
yesterday!!! When my husband got home we started to really talk about <br/>
what was happening. He told me he was afraid that if we kept letting <br/>
him leave school(second time) that he would grow up and when things <br/>
got hard he&#39;d look for someone else to help him. I showed him that <br/>
Chris isn&#39;t like that when he plays his video games or anything else <br/>
that really interests him. He keeps trying until he beats the level <br/>
and then the game itself or whatever else he&#39;s trying to do. If it&#39;s <br/>
something he wants then it&#39;s more important to him to see it through. <br/>
After a long conversation with my husband about it we made a <br/>
compromise. Chris has to do some math and handwriting for his Dad but <br/>
the rest of the day is free for us.We can get that done in a little <br/>
over an hour so I guess that&#39;s what we&#39;ll do until his Dad can see <br/>
the joys of unschooling. <br/>
Chris was overjoyed about the outcome! He&#39;s been wanting to come back <br/>
home for awhile. After I picked him up I told the princepal we were <br/>
checking out so now we&#39;re free and Chris is bouncing off the walls <br/>
right now. I figure he&#39;ll mellow out after a while. <br/>
Thanks to everyone who responded to my e-mail. This site is a real <br/>
help in our journey.<br/>

Take heart Robyn cos dads can change.  My dh didn&#39;t even want my kids to be<br/>
homeschooled never mind unschooled. Now he is my biggest supporter of it and<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. It took him time toopen is mind to it and<br/>
see but he got there.<br/>
