&lt;&lt; n our 6 yrs of homeschooling, there<br/>
 have been times when we stayed home much of the time, and there have been<br/>
 times when we are on the go daily.  It depends on interests, time and<br/>
 energy... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is so reassuring to hear from people who have been doing this for a while. <br/>
 We have just started but this has been my feeling -- that there will be an <br/>
ebb and flow -- more and then less activity.  This is part of why I feel put <br/>
on the spot when people (usually moms upset with the ps system around here) <br/>
ask me the usual questions about what we do -- I don&#39;t have a master plan, <br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be getting one any time soon, and don&#39;t think I need one.  <br/>
You should see how fast their eyes glaze over -- they just don&#39;t get the <br/>
non-linear nature of my life.  And yours, I guess.  Just not structured <br/>
enough for everyone.  And I try to be polite -- I don&#39;t tell them my way is <br/>
the greatest -- just that this is what we are figuring out.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s good to hear from all those on the list how things change over <br/>
time.  <br/>
