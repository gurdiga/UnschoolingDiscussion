&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi, I&#39;m Bobbie, and I&#39;m a packrat.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; No, there isn&#39;t a cure. Sorry. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, there&#39;s hope. I used to be a packrat, and we have a fairly <br/>
&gt; junk-free<br/>
&gt; &gt; house now. The only thing I still have too many of is pictures and <br/>
&gt; books,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but everything else is under control. My hubby is a neat freak who <br/>
&gt; has won<br/>
&gt; &gt; me over slowly but surely and weaned me off of my packrat ways. I <br/>
&gt; come<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt; a long line of packrats though. We just spent the weekend at my <br/>
&gt; mom&#39;s<br/>
&gt; house<br/>
&gt; &gt; (ugh!) and this cracked me up: she said to my son &quot;Don&#39;t step on <br/>
&gt; that pile<br/>
&gt; &gt; of magazines. Do you just stand all over the magazines at your own <br/>
&gt; house?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In my mind I&#39;m thinking &quot;No mom, because we don&#39;t HAVE piles of <br/>
&gt; magazines<br/>
&gt; &gt; all over our house&quot;, honestly, the word &quot;childproofing&quot; means <br/>
&gt; nothing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; her, she has piles of stuff everywhere and I have a 16 month old - <br/>
&gt; ack!.<br/>
&gt; My<br/>
&gt; &gt; grandma&#39;s house is worse. She can no longer use one of her <br/>
&gt; bathrooms<br/>
&gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; it is full of stuff, and hasn&#39;t eaten a  meal on her dining room <br/>
&gt; table in<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; least 15 years, it&#39;s been buried in stuff. She just has little <br/>
&gt; pathways<br/>
&gt; &gt; through everything, piles of old newspapers, magazines, sheet <br/>
&gt; music, etc..<br/>
&gt; &gt; We don&#39;t go over there anymore. My niece (age 6) said the funniest <br/>
&gt; thing<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; last time we were there, she said &quot;If there was an earthquake when <br/>
&gt; we were<br/>
&gt; &gt; all visiting Grandma M&#39;s house, we&#39;d all die of paper cuts&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In any case, there&#39;s hope. I listened to a talk radio show on my <br/>
&gt; way back<br/>
&gt; &gt; from my mom&#39;s house. It had the author of &quot;Clutter&#39;s Last Stand&quot; <br/>
&gt; on as the<br/>
&gt; &gt; guest. He just wrote a new book called something like &quot;Lose 200 <br/>
&gt; pounds<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; weekend&quot; (meaning 200 pounds of stuff) and he had a bunch of great <br/>
&gt; tips<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; de-cluttering, if anyone&#39;s interested...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s my mom&#39;s belief too &lt;sigh&gt;. Not to say anything about your<br/>
situation, since I don&#39;t know what it is. But I know with my mom it affects<br/>
her daily life in a negative way but she is blind to it. It also affects<br/>
people around her. We would visit much more often if her house wasn&#39;t such a<br/>
mess. It&#39;s just too hard with the kids to be at her house, so mostly I just<br/>
have her visit here. She&#39;s always moving around piles of stuff to find<br/>
things that she has misplaced, and she spends an inordinate amount of time<br/>
just dealing with her *stuff*, time which could be spent doing other things<br/>
she wants to do (which she claims she never has time for). If I want to cook<br/>
dinner at her house, I first have to clear off enough counter space to do<br/>
so. What a pain!<br/>
As a child, I hated growing up in our messy house. I was embarassed to bring<br/>
my friends over. I hated the fact that we had to do the 5-hour cleanup drill<br/>
whenever important company or relatives came over (which often consisted of<br/>
trying to find places to stuff those Very Important Piles).  Of course, you<br/>
can go way too far in the other direction too. A friend of mine growing up<br/>
lived in a house with all-white carpeting and white furniture. Her mom put<br/>
plastic over the carpets and furniture whenever the kids were in the rooms,<br/>
and there were certain rooms that were off-limits to the kids. I think<br/>
that&#39;s a bit freaky on the other end of the spectrum!<br/>

It&#39;s so good to read your posts.<br/>
I am a pack rat but not toooooo bad.<br/>
I do clean out every now and then and make a donation to the Salvation<br/>
Army.<br/>
I also have most everything labeled (ok maybe a little too much)<br/>
but i also find that it helps me find things or for my kids to find<br/>
things in a hurry.<br/>
