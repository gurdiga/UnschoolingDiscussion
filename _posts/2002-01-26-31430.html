This is so FASCINATING. (Well, to me, anyway.) After reading your post, I <br/>
went on a hunt for the last time I posted here. It was a year ago almost to <br/>
the day! January 25, 2001. That was the last one I found, anyway. Around that <br/>
time, someone tired of the bickering started a new yahoo list, <br/>
unschoolkingdom, and I went over there for a while. A few months later, I <br/>
found I was spending too much time online, was on too many lists, and <br/>
unsubbed from almost everything. Talk about deja vu! (The bickering and <br/>
forming new lists, I mean.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway -- I think I&#39;m just more likely to be at the computer in Jan/Feb. You <br/>
know -- it&#39;s cold outside. My husband ice climbs and travels this time of <br/>
year, too, leaving me with more time on my hands. He&#39;s in Ecuador now, <br/>
climbing some volcanoes. I miss him. :( Kids miss him. <br/>
<br/>
So -- I really don&#39;t know what&#39;s been happening on this list since the last <br/>
time I was here. Sounds juicy. Some really nice lists I&#39;ve been on where <br/>
everyone agreed and there was lots of &quot;support and caring&quot; either bit the <br/>
dust or got too *huggy* for me. <br/>

&lt;&lt; But I do come and <br/>
 read sometimes.  I don&#39;t read here as much as I use to.  I don&#39;t like <br/>
 the direction it&#39;s gone.  I didn&#39;t bring up the subject of the way <br/>
 this board is, now compared to then.  I just commented on it.<br/>

<br/>
Hi Joanna -- What direction? Never mind, I can check the archives, if it <br/>
matters. Just don&#39;t anybody send me *hugs*, okay?<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;tea party chitchat&quot; (anyone on this list remember THAT discussion) kinda <br/>
lists can be nice and warm and leave me with good feelings inside, but I <br/>
don&#39;t learn anything, I&#39;ve found. And I get bored. This may be a character <br/>
flaw.<br/>

<br/>
What volcanoes is he climbing? Cotopaxi? Some of our greatest unschooling<br/>
adventures my son and I spent in Ecuador two summers ago. We lived under<br/>
an erupting volcano (Tungurahua) in a tiny town in a $1-a-day hotel and<br/>
almost didn&#39;t make it out bc<br/>
the indigenous people (Indians) were getting ready to have a national<br/>
strike -- all roads blocked all over the country! Plus there was political<br/>
instability bc at the time the currency was changing over to the US dollar<br/>
and a lot of folks didn&#39;t like that. I was happy to come back home but we<br/>
had a great -- albeit somewhat scary -- time.<br/>

<br/>
The best lists I&#39;ve been on have lasted for years, mostly bc they&#39;ve<br/>
achieved that rare balance of tolerance/hugginess vs. debate/controversy.<br/>
Usually, like someone posted earlier, these things go in cycles.<br/>

Yes! Cotopaxi, Chimborazo, and another one I can&#39;t remember.:) How old is <br/>
your son? I know our 9yo would love to travel with his dad more. Not so the <br/>
8yo -- he&#39;d miss Saturday morning cartoons!<br/>

<br/>
Yep. I go in cycles, too. Someone on another (Virginia) list I&#39;m on posted a <br/>
piece on the typical life cycle of lists. I may try to find it. It was <br/>
interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328095702">Ah, found it! I don&#39;t know, some of it rings true, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
THE NATURAL LIFE CYCLE OF MAILING LISTS<br/>
<br/>
Every list seems to go through the same cycle:<br/>
<br/>
1.Initial enthusiasm (people introduce themselves, and gush a lot about<br/>
how wonderful it is to find kindred souls).<br/>
2.Evangelism (people moan about how few folks are posting to the list,<br/>
and brainstorm recruitment strategies).<br/>
3.Growth (more and more people join, more and more lengthy threads<br/>
develop, occasional off-topic threads pop up).<br/>
4.Community (lots of threads, some more relevant than others; lots of<br/>
information and advice is exchanged; experts help other experts as<br/>
well as less experienced colleagues; friendships develop; people<br/>
tease each other; newcomers are welcomed with generosity and patience;<br/>
everyone -- newbie and expert alike -- feels comfortable asking<br/>
questions, suggesting answers, and sharing opinions).<br/>
5.Discomfort with diversity (the number of messages increases<br/>
dramatically; not every thread is fascinating to every reader;<br/>
people start complaining about the signal-to-noise ratio; person 1<br/>
threatens to quit if *other* people don&#39;t limit discussion to person<br/>
1&#39;s pet topic; person 2 agrees with person 1; person 3 tells 1 & 2 to<br/>
lighten up; more bandwidth is wasted complaining about off-topic<br/>
threads than is used for the threads themselves; everyone gets annoyed).<br/>
6.<br/>
a.Smug complacency and stagnation (the purists flame everyone who asks<br/>
an &#39;old&#39; question or responds with humor to a serious post; newbies<br/>
are rebuffed; traffic drops to a doze-producing level of a few<br/>
minor issues; all interesting discussions happen by private email and are<br/>
limited to a few participants; the purists spend lots of time<br/>
self-righteously congratulating each other on keeping off-topic<br/>
threads off the list).<br/>
OR<br/>
b.Maturity (a few people quit in a huff; the rest of the participants<br/>
stay near stage 4, with stage 5 popping up briefly every few weeks; many<br/>
people wear out their second or third &#39;delete&#39; key, but the list lives<br/>
contentedly ever after).<br/>
