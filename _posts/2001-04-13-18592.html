<div id="ygrps-yiv-667774107">Thank you for such a thoughtful reply.  I am scheduled to observe a whole <br/>
morning at the preschool next week and hope that will help me sort out <br/>
whether it would be a good idea.  The thought keeps occuring to me that I <br/>
just want help in my parenting responsibility to teach order, cleanup, <br/>
respect for others, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I would be absolutely delighted to know someone who has homeschooled <br/>
triplets.  Please ask her to contact me directly if she has a minute to <br/>
breathe.  And thank you in advance.</div>
