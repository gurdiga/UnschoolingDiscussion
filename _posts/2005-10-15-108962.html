<div id="ygrps-yiv-217279331">I&#39;m reading about the chores issue on Sandra&#39;s site and I have several <br/>
questions I need help with:<br/>
<br/>
1. Since my kids complain that we don&#39;t get to our afternoon activities soon <br/>
enough and they stand around asking me over and over if I&#39;m done with the <br/>
stuff I need to do yet, I have told them that we are a team and if they want to <br/>
get somewhere by 1pm instead of 2pm then they need to help me clean up. <br/>
Does this go against the idea of not asking kids to do chores?<br/>
<br/>
2. quoting from the website: &quot;It&#39;s more of a shift in the parent&#39;s attitude than the <br/>
kids at first. If a person appears grumpy about cleaning, the kids will pick up <br/>
on that and immediately assume that cleaning is a real bummer.&quot;<br/>
What if you really do feel like cleaning is a bummer? What if you are one of <br/>
those people who are genetically not into cleaning? (quoting: &quot; studies of <br/>
separated identical twins suggest that the desire and ability to clean and <br/>
organize have more to do with genetics than &quot;training.&quot;&quot;)<br/>
Certainly &quot;faking it&quot; won&#39;t work, the kids will see right through that!<br/>
<br/>
3. My kids have never had chores, but I do get on their cases for not cleaning <br/>
up their messes. I want to stop, so this is why I am reading the website and <br/>
asking these questions. Here is what happens in our house. My husband <br/>
does the dishes, the laundry and the some of the cleaning (like sweeping, <br/>
moping etc...) When I do clean, it&#39;s &quot;spring cleaning&quot; type of stuff, like 8 hours <br/>
straight of cleaning in one day 2 or 3 times a year, moving all the furniture <br/>
around etc...Part of why I don&#39;t clean more often is that once I get started, I <br/>
don&#39;t want to stop, so I rarely do it, because with kids around, there are always <br/>
interuptions, for stuff they need from me, so I wait until a day when I am alone <br/>
at home. Anyway, the problem is that my husband gets really tired of a messy <br/>
house, but he makes it clear to us all that he doesn&#39;t want to be the one to <br/>
clean everything. Also, he is mortified if we have anyone over to our house <br/>
and they see how messy our house is. How do I remedy this? I am NOT under <br/>
the ilusion that I can &quot;fix&quot; my husband. What can I do to change MY attitude <br/>
toward cleaning?<br/>
(I have sent him a link to Sandra&#39;s page on cleaning before, whether he read <br/>
it or not I don&#39;t know!)<br/>
<br/>
4. When I do everything my kids ask of me I feel overwhelmed. I just can&#39;t fit it <br/>
all in one day. I also get a reaction from where, I don&#39;t know, but it is a strong <br/>
feeling of being their servant and I just want to scream at them! Especially if <br/>
they TELL me what they want or need as opposed to &quot;asking me&quot; (like &quot;Mom, <br/>
get me an apple&quot;) I don&#39;t require them to say thank you or please, but <br/>
occasionally I let them know that it is a lot easier to do things for them if they <br/>
include these or if they at least ask rather than demand. Is this reasonable or <br/>
am I just deluding myself? <br/>
<br/>
Help please!<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

*****************************<br/>
If you had a doctor&#39;s appointment or a job interview in the afternoon, I  <br/>
assume you wouldn&#39;t blow it off or be late because you had to finish cleaning  <br/>
the house. Going to those afternoon activities with your kids is an appointment  <br/>
you have with them. It&#39;s disrespectful to blow it off for something like  <br/>
housework, and it&#39;s mean to use guilt-trips to get them to help you with it. I  <br/>
assure you the housework will be there when you get back.<br/>
 <br/>
So, what&#39;s with the Psycho Supercleaner Mom? Do you just find that more  fun? <br/>
I can see that (although it doesn&#39;t really happen to me).  If your  kids are <br/>
seeing that, I can see why they&#39;d be reluctant to help. It might look  like <br/>
they&#39;re committing to a whole day of scrubbing under the furniture.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe you could ask the kids for support in getting over this affliction  :)  <br/>
They may have some ideas about reasonable messy levels ( your husband  too), <br/>
and everyone might be happier if cleaning involved loading the  dishwasher and <br/>
picking up the Legos rather than rearranging the furniture.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What would be your goal in letting your kids know that you don&#39;t like  <br/>
housework? Is it getting you closer to your goal? Is it making  <br/>
housework easier? It is getting them to help more?<br/>
<br/>
The solution isn&#39;t to paste on a happy face and say housework is so  <br/>
much fun :-) The solution is to see that finding a way to be more  <br/>
peaceful about tasks and finding a way to minimize those tasks will  <br/>
be a lot more helpful than grumbling.<br/>
<br/>
One really helpful thing is to acknowledge that you don&#39;t have to do  <br/>
any of it. There are no house police who will swoop in and inspect  <br/>
under your bed or give you a violation for having dirty glasses in  <br/>
the living room. When you accept that you don&#39;t have to then you know  <br/>
when you&#39;re doing something because you *choose* to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I clean my toilet a lot more often now that I do it because I want a  <br/>
clean toilet and not because you&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to clean it every x  <br/>
number of days. (I just rebelled against that and didn&#39;t clean it,  <br/>
while feeling guilty about it. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When I do everything my kids ask of me I feel overwhelmed. I just  <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t fit it<br/>
&gt; all in one day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Be honest! Rather than failing to do &quot;everything&quot; be honest about  <br/>
what can be done today.<br/>
<br/>
Moms often get that &quot;Don&#39;t you understand that I&#39;m doing the best I  <br/>
can and how can you ask me to do one more thing,&quot; voice ;-) Don&#39;t do  <br/>
that! Just be honest and matter of fact about the limitations of the  <br/>
world: &quot;We&#39;ll be away from 1-3 with Jimmy&#39;s kite flying lesson so we  <br/>
won&#39;t be able to do a 2 o&#39;clock play date with Sonia. What ideas do  <br/>
you have?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Mom,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like there&#39;s more going on than that. It&#39;s just a symptom  <br/>
of other things. If they&#39;re young it could just be age but if they&#39;re  <br/>
older it could a disconnection. They don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re feelings  <br/>
are treated seriously so they don&#39;t have the need to treat you  <br/>
seriously. Could it also be that you aren&#39;t *with* them enough? &quot;With  <br/>
them&quot; meaning engaged in what they&#39;re doing, interacting like a  <br/>
friend, aware of what they like and dislike about what they&#39;re doing  <br/>
and so on. Or do they feel you&#39;re more off doing your thing while  <br/>
they do their thing?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Part of why I don&#39;t clean more often is that once I get started, I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to stop<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which unlike the rain is not beyond your control. You are not a  <br/>
victim of your feelings. If you can set your sites on a different  <br/>
goal and figure out a way to get there, wanting to do a huge job may  <br/>
seem less compelling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they stand around asking me over and over if I&#39;m done with the<br/>
&gt; stuff I need to do yet,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter until she was 11 or so had no interest in helping. It was  <br/>
all just too overwhelming for her. By telling her it would go faster  <br/>
if she helped did not advance her maturation. It just made us both  <br/>
more irritable.<br/>
<br/>
Rethink what you &quot;need&quot; to do. Ask youself, if this isn&#39;t done, who&#39;s  <br/>
going to die?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway, the problem is that my husband gets really tired of a messy<br/>
&gt; house, but he makes it clear to us all that he doesn&#39;t want to be  <br/>
&gt; the one to<br/>
&gt; clean everything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t blame him.<br/>
<br/>
How about keeping one room clean for him as a sanctuary?<br/>
<br/>
Rethink how things are put away. Big bins to throw things in are a  <br/>
lot easier than carting hundreds of things to dozens of locations  <br/>
throughout the house. Rethink where things are played with. If  <br/>
everything ends up in front of the TV, for instance, think about  <br/>
moving the TV.<br/>

up?<br/>
<br/>
Every thing that adds negativity and frustration to your day is relationship <br/>
damaging, nest-breaking stuff.   <br/>

What if you really do feel like cleaning is a bummer?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then why would you make your kids share that sorrow with you?<br/>
<br/>
Learn to enjoy it.   <br/>
<br/>
Shift your attitude.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What if you are one of<br/>
those people who are genetically not into cleaning? (quoting: &quot; studies of<br/>

Is it the kids&#39; responsibility to pick up that slack?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Certainly &quot;faking it&quot; won&#39;t work, the kids will see right through that!-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you live where a state inspector comes?   <br/>
Will you lose your home without it being clean?   (In some instances of <br/>
public housing, mean landlords or military housing, the answer might be &quot;yes,&quot; to <br/>

<br/>
Some people swear by Flylady, a website where you can get ideas and sign up <br/>
for e-mail reminders and schedules.   She has tricks for quicky passby cleanups <br/>
and little emotionally satisfying ways to chop cleaning into lots of smaller <br/>
pieces.<br/>
<br/>

and they see how messy our house is. How do I remedy this? I am NOT under<br/>
the ilusion that I can &quot;fix&quot; my husband. What can I do to change MY attitude<br/>
toward cleaning?-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is all beyond the scope of our discussion, honestly.   The relationship <br/>
between you and your husband might not even allow for unschooling or mindful <br/>
parenting in ANY degree.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce&#39;s writings on chores might be more helpful to you than mine.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>
<br/>
I should go and link that from the chores page, in fact.   <br/>
<br/>
People have priorities.   They can change their priorities if they really <br/>
want to, and it changes their lives.   My priority is my children&#39;s happiness.   <br/>
If my priority were to have a house ready for company at any moment, all of my <br/>
life would be different.   I would make my decisions based on that goal.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When I do everything my kids ask of me I feel overwhelmed. I just can&#39;t <br/>
fit it<br/>
all in one day. I also get a reaction from where, I don&#39;t know, but it is a <br/>
strong<br/>
feeling of being their servant and I just want to scream at them!-=-<br/>
<br/>
Right.<br/>
You, the parent, MUST really understand what your own goals and beliefs and <br/>
principles are.   If you don&#39;t change, unschooling won&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
No one who&#39;s busy and happy can fit everything all into one day.   So decide <br/>
what the priority items are.   For me, it&#39;s my kids most days.   Some days <br/>
it&#39;s getting ready for a conference, or finishing an article, and I&#39;ll just tell <br/>
the kids so.   They can still trump the other thing if they really need to, <br/>
but they&#39;re willing to give me space and time because I so often give them all <br/>
they want.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Especially if<br/>
they TELL me what they want or need as opposed to &quot;asking me&quot; (like &quot;Mom,<br/>
get me an apple&quot;) I don&#39;t require them to say thank you or please, but<br/>
occasionally I let them know that it is a lot easier to do things for them if <br/>
they<br/>
include these or if they at least ask rather than demand. Is this reasonable <br/>
or<br/>
am I just deluding myself?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Try not to divide the world into two choices that way.   It&#39;s dualism (if you <br/>
want to get philosophical) and not balance.   <br/>
<br/>
Do you ask them nicely when you want them to do something?   Is &quot;not now&quot; or <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t feel like it&quot; a viable response from them?   (If not, your &quot;please&quot; <br/>
is just sugar coating on a command.)   Are they speaking to you in the way you <br/>
speak to them?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t &quot;require&quot; my husband to say please and thank you, but from the time <br/>
we first hung out together in 1978 or so, we just did.   And we never stopped.  <br/>
 Please and thank you, and &quot;that was nice, thanks.&quot;   And by the time we had <br/>
kids we had been doing that for eight years. And they heard it before they <br/>
understood English.     <br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t back up to 1978, but you can start being softer and gentler and <br/>
honestly grateful and honestly appealing when you ask, if you want them to really <br/>
know the benefits of &quot;please and thank you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Am I just deluding myself&quot;? seems very shrill and antagonistic.    <br/>
<br/>
The more successes you have, the easier it will be to take the next step.   <br/>
Don&#39;t try to take all the steps at once.    Understand what you&#39;re doing as you <br/>
do it.   <br/>
<br/>
Joyce&#39;s page is good with explaining the why part:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307157384">Just lifted this from another list:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also in the program was this quote from Robyn L.<br/>
Coburn,<br/>
&quot;Intententions matter. Expectations are the surest path to<br/>
disappointment. The idea I am suggesting to you is to not attempt<br/>
strewing yet until you have reached the internal serenity of<br/>
detachment.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Detachment is what makes lots of unschooling work.<br/>
If a mom will take personally a moment of distraction, or a child&#39;s desire to <br/>
be alone, or a request for an apple that doesn&#39;t include &quot;mother may I?&quot; the <br/>
mother&#39;s own neediness and insecurity is a negative factor in the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Why can&#39;t apples be where kids want them?   <br/>
Or can you give the child the apple and smile and kiss him on the head and <br/>
say &quot;You&#39;re welcome&quot; in a really nice way without it sounding like you&#39;re <br/>
shaming him for not saying &quot;please&quot;?   <br/>
<br/>
Moms should make the first move, and if the mom has been part of the <br/>
deterioration of the relationship, the mom might need to make the next 200 moves.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was watching Super Nanny last night and I was hearing some of it from <br/>
the other room.   What crap.   A child felt powerless, so they worked HARD to <br/>
make her more powerless than ever.     <br/>
<br/>
I could go on, and I will, but not right here and now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
