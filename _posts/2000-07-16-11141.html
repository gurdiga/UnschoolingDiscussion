<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179005343">Corallyn, this book you describe sounds like a good one.  I have to agree <br/>
with the information stated about our society&#39;s high- carb diets leading to <br/>
many health problems.  It is an excessive consumption  of soft drinks, chips, <br/>
white flour and refined sugar products that are greatly contributing to <br/>
diseases like diabetes.  When a person follows a high protein diet, initially <br/>
they eat an extremely small amt of carbs.  This does put the body in ketosis, <br/>
which will cause the body to use it&#39;s own fat as fuel, which causes weight <br/>
loss.  Even people who are wanting to lose weight on a protein diet will <br/>
begin eating carbs as a part of the diet.  The difference is that they eat <br/>
carbs that are not refined and filled with sugar.  Many  people have some <br/>
difficulty digesting and metabolising specific carbs, which is known as a <br/>
carbohydrate intolerance, and is similar to an allergy.  Avoidance of <br/>
processed foods will make a greater difference in one&#39;s health, in my <br/>
opinion, than  eating strictly one way or another.  From what I am learning, <br/>
the human body was designed to eat a variety of nourishing foods, including <br/>
some meat, some vegetables, nuts, fruits, and accasional starches. Nature did <br/>
not intend for us to consume all of the sugars , corn syrups, white flour, <br/>
and cornstarch products so h prevalent in the western diet.  Interesting <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740612486">That&#39;s right. infact the only problem I had with the<br/>
diet was when it came time to up my carbs. I lost<br/>
control and went completely off the diet and couldn&#39;t<br/>
get myself back on. It was actually my problem not the<br/>
diet&#39;s. I still haven&#39;t gotten back on the diet but I<br/>
am pg now and it wouldn&#39;t be wise although I do try to<br/>
eat the equal amounts of carbs and protein but don&#39;t<br/>
push  myself to do so. If I am hungery I eat what I<br/>
have i.e. want. All this talk about it is giving me<br/>
motivation to start the diet again after I have the<br/>
baby though.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and the other thing I forgot to mention that<br/>
happened when I was on this is that I did not lose any<br/>
lbs. I started the diet weighing 170 and when I lost<br/>
the 5 inches from my waist I was still 170. Nearly a<br/>
year later I had kept the inches off and was still<br/>
170. My fat % went down. I was confussed because I had<br/>
not exercised while on the diet but the only<br/>
explanation is that I gained muscle. That&#39;s what I<br/>
think is amazing. Now, when I started the diet my lean<br/>
body weight was 96 lb. When I went off the diet it was<br/>
around 110 lb.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-874676741">Does anyone know the effects of going completely raw? I know two people that<br/>
are raw foodists and they too say they&#39;ve never felt better. I did recently<br/>
read that a raw foodist is one whose diet is 75% raw, which does seem a<br/>
little more resonable to me. Just curious.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638117356">Thanks all you Vegetarians and Vegans and others who have had input on this <br/>
subject.  It has lead hubbie and I to look at changing the way we eat to fit <br/>
in with our new unschooling lifestyle.  I&#39;m looking forward to learning more <br/>
from you seasoned pro&#39;s....<br/>
