<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303246491"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Kids in school have the same opportunity as kids at home to see examples<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of  correctly spelled writing, and to come on times when someone has<br/>
misunderstood<br/>
 what they&#39;ve written.Any atrocious speller you know in your life probably<br/>
went to school where  they were taught phonics and spelling rules.  My<br/>
husband could hardly spell when  I met him (he was 21) but he COULD<br/>
communicate in writing very well.  He just  needed an editor.  Over the<br/>
years his spelling improved, slowly but surely,  because the pressure of<br/>
grades and school and red pencil marks as gone and he  came to care.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am really glad you wrote this. Yesterday my boys decided to color some<br/>
pictures of african animals. Jess brought his to me to glue into our<br/>
yearbook and he had written a poem underneath the cheetah. (This is the<br/>
first poem since we began unschooling!) Here it is. (He&#39;s 9 and learned to<br/>
read the phonics way)<br/>

<br/>
(so brave is the beast as it stalks its prey. It has no fear of anything in<br/>
its way.)<br/>
<br/>
the spelling is atrocious and his handwriting not much better BUT the poem<br/>
is lovely.I think with &#39;editing&#39; it communicates really well. If he had<br/>
written it at school and had been made to go back and correct it, I wonder<br/>
if he would ever try again. I didn&#39;t say anything about the spelling, just<br/>
glued it into the book and told him I really liked the poem. I&#39;ll just look<br/>
out for opportunities to point out the spelling of those words without<br/>
references to his poem.<br/>

I love this poem!! The rhythm of it read aloud is wonderful, and the<br/>
subtle alliteration seems really mature.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the originally spelled version makes me think of Old English.<br/>
