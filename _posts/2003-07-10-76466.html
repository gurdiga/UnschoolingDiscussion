<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201350053">&quot;So it was a comforting dream that someone else would be willing to help me <br/>
with a saddle, because my parents said do it yourself or you&#39;re not old enough <br/>
to ride.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The more you write about your parents, the more I want to slap them! I&#39;m sorry your interest did not get taken seriously, that sucks.<br/>
Using this logic, most of us should not be driving a car I suppose....how sad that people really feel justified thinking this way.<br/>
