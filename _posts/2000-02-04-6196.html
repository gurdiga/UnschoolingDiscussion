<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166183366">Hi Lhiza!<br/>
 Welcome and hope you have a wonderful learning adventure. I too am a single/working mom who also has the wonderful support of my family. We work and learn together. <br/>
My only wish is that someone had told ME the following:<br/>
1. Take that money I spent on their first curriculum and buy software, used reading books, science kits, food ( we love to cook, vegetarian style), magazines, and make many trips to the library!<br/>
2. Don&#39;t be afraid your kids aren&#39;t learning as their watching tv, sitting and staring, even sleeping and playing! I&#39;ve seen more spelling improvement out of my kids by letting them loose on a Scrabble board, banging on the computer, and playing hang-man! Sure beats the tears of rote memorization and F&#39;s on spelling tests!<br/>
3. Socialization...ummm....let&#39;s see...my kids have often been complimented on their maturity and politeness...their ability to relate to adults and children alike...<br/>
well..I see no problems there either (LOL)...<br/>
4. Don&#39;t be afraid to let them read above their level OR below...I learn more/faster from the juvenile sections! My soon to be 11yo loves Mark Twain, Shakesphere,and of course Pokemon....My 13yo is into Warhammer, friends, and of course earning all the money he can...he&#39;s trying to outsave the 17yo! The 17yo is currently finishing up her hs diploma and attending cc part-time..and has decided to pursue a degree in cosmetology starting in June. She was going to attend a University, but liked the idea of having a trade first more appealing. Four years ago I would have told her she was Nuts! Seems like I&#39;ve grown alot too!!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be so long winded, but these are the things that took me the longest to understand...being in the &quot;boon-docks&quot; and not fitting in with the &quot;local&quot; hs group..I was very reluctant to give up school-at-home..<br/>
Good Luck and trust YOUR instincts!<br/>

(who is wishing she had that curriculum money back! Ouch!)</div>
