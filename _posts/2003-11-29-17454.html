He&#39;s (her son 17 months) a pretty exceptional little boy.  Since <br/>
you&#39;re so into home schooling I&#39;m sure you have lots of resources.  <br/>
Would you mind taking a few minutes and helping me find some.  I know <br/>
every mother says this but I swear Noah&#39;s IQ must be huge.  I taught <br/>
him how to count to ten already, and now we&#39;re working on the <br/>
alphabet (after just a few sessions he&#39;s already showing some <br/>
memorization).  He&#39;s also recognizing most of his colors and all of <br/>
his body parts even the hard ones.  I just feel like he&#39;s learning <br/>
everything so quickly that I don&#39;t want to slow down.  He&#39;s really <br/>
enjoying it so where can I go from here.  Are there books that I can <br/>
read to help me deal with an exceptional child?  My mother says I&#39;m <br/>
pushing him too hard but I feel like he&#39;s pushing me to learn new <br/>
things.  John agrees with me that Luke has a true love of learning.  <br/>
What do you think can you push a kid too hard when they are the <br/>
instigator?  If you can just point me in the direction of some <br/>
literature I&#39;ll be sure to read it.  <br/>
Thanks a million,<br/>

Hey are you still home schooling?  I was just curious to know if this <br/>
was a permanent situation or what.  Obviously if you are it&#39;s working <br/>
well for you but let me know because I&#39;m curious how it works with <br/>
two kids of different ages<br/>
*********************<br/>
<br/>
I had a couple of reactions to this. First, that this woman is totally, <br/>
head-over-heels, in love with her child. She looks at him with awe and love. How <br/>
cool is that?!<br/>
<br/>
At 17 months old, playing these games with him are games to him. Maybe <br/>
they&#39;ll pan out in that he&#39;ll read early or something. Maybe not. Seems the goal is <br/>
to help her stay awesomely in love with her kid. <br/>
<br/>
Tell her that if she wants him to keep love learning that she should read to <br/>
him and play as many games with him as they like to do together, but that she <br/>
has to be careful about pushing him beyond that. Tell her that if it stops <br/>
being fun for him, he&#39;ll stop being so hungry for learning.<br/>
<br/>
Tell her that one of the things that seems to squelch children&#39;s love of <br/>
learning is to be yelled at, shamed, punished. Suggest she try to be as positive <br/>
and supportive as possible. That she also needs not to worry so much about <br/>
academics as to help him nurture ALL his interests and talents, because he <br/>
probably will have lots.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, tell her that with such an exceptional child, she should <br/>
definitely homeschool, preferably unschool. Then suggest a copy of Holt (Oh, you <br/>
already did that!) or some other unschooling book. I also like Please Touch, by <br/>
Susan Striker (who also did the Anti-Coloring Books). <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay (even sweet) that she feels that her son is exceptional. You can <br/>
help her keep feeling that way even if he&#39;s actually a bit dim &gt;eg&lt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514088035">Kathryn&#39;s suggestions were sweet and wonderful.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it might help to remind her that learning happens in a small part of <br/>
a second.  A spark of recognition or realization and it&#39;s LEARNED.  Real brain <br/>
connections.  So tell her not to think a teensy session is less valuable than <br/>
a long session.  Lots of little ones are probably better than long focussed <br/>
sessions anyway.  And he&#39;ll need time to process and play with what he&#39;s <br/>
learned.   <br/>
<br/>
Remind her that when a child has had an intellectually or emotionally <br/>
stimulating day he&#39;ll probably sleep extral long and extra hard, and that too is <br/>
processing time.  It&#39;s as much a part of the learning as the questioning and <br/>
&quot;OOOH! I get it!&quot; moments are.<br/>
