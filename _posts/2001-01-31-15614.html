<br/>
I am the one who usually puts them away, though I try to get the kids to<br/>
help.  &quot;Let&#39;s put the game away so we don&#39;t lose the pieces.&quot;  You might<br/>
not believe it if you saw my cluttered house, but I am one of those<br/>
people who goes around putting caps back on markers while the kids are<br/>
still coloring.  I just can&#39;t seem to help it!  Hope I don&#39;t make my kids<br/>
neurotic...   But at least we have all of our game pieces!<br/>
<br/>
I have also tried giving a reminder and telling them that if such and<br/>
such isn&#39;t picked up in (blank) amount of time, that it will go in the<br/>
garage.  Unfortunately, they have so much stuff they don&#39;t care.  I&#39;ve<br/>
also done the rotation thing - box up a bunch of stuff, then after a few<br/>
months get it out and box up some other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read so many organizing books, web sites, etc, and get motivated for<br/>
a short time.  My bottom line is still too much stuff.  I am slowly<br/>
working on getting rid of extraneous stuff and better arrangement of what<br/>
we do keep.<br/>
