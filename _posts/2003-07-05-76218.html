What changed?<br/>
I ask because my husband is hard on Dustin. We met when Dustin was 3 1/2 and <br/>
Dustin and he got along great the first year and then we moved into our new <br/>
home and boom!<br/>
My husband nags, its never done right or good enough for hubby and he often <br/>
pushes Dustin away. I have spoken with hubby and asked that he lighten up and <br/>
he always has a come back like well he never does anything or I told him to do <br/>
it this way. All of this has caused so much friction in our home it just puts <br/>
me in a mood.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is great with the other two 3 &1 (his). His dad is the same way <br/>
but he hates that he was raised the way he was and still has some upsets over <br/>
that. He is a very technical fact kinda guy.  But he is critical. For instance <br/>
this am hubby asked D to help him with the rabbit cage. I said (after D came in <br/>
upset about having to pick up a bunch of poop he dropped) &quot;let him pick it up <br/>
(d was fine with) but please don&#39;t criticize him for how well its done.&quot; When <br/>
D was done hubby came out back to rake more up and made another little wagon <br/>
full for him. ugh<br/>
<br/>
Last night it was something else he ended up getting mad at D and grabbed him <br/>
when D said something sarcastic to him. This time I didn&#39;t say a word I just <br/>
looked at him when he came in and a bit later he apologized and they hugged.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of stress over money and bills but I am wondering what I can <br/>
do or not do to help this situation. I love my husband and my son but I do not <br/>
want this battle to get any worse than it is.<br/>

I just talked.  I would apologize to the kids and smoothe things over after <br/>
their dad was a yuck sometimes.  I would talk to him later and say I thought <br/>
maybe he could have said this instead of that.  Sometimes he got mad and <br/>
sometimes he didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;d ask him whether he remembered being six, and he&#39;d say &quot;No,&quot; and <br/>
I would do some version of &quot;Why do you think that is?&quot; or &quot;Well I do, and <br/>
he&#39;s not old enough to understand/appreciate/get [whatever it was].&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or sometimes, &quot;Did your dad say things like that to you when you were [that <br/>
age]?&quot;  Often his answer was &quot;I don&#39;t remember.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The reason he doesn&#39;t remember is he hated his life growing up.  So I don&#39;t <br/>
have to say that, he just gradually realized that it really WAS okay for our <br/>
kids to be happy.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; All of this has caused so much friction in our home it just puts <br/>
me in a mood. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would tell him that.  Tell him he&#39;s marring TWO relationships, and not <br/>
doing the other kids any good either.<br/>
