<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201612118"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;     I bet if I had more of this in me I wouldn&#39;t get half as much flack. <br/>
&gt;But I do believe being brought up w/ a parent who had no confidence in me <br/>
&gt;makes me the people pleaser that I am. Do as your told ruffle no feathers. I <br/>
&gt;did try and fight w/ my mother but she was so dominant I never got my point <br/>
&gt;across. She feels differently.<br/>
