&gt;  Just thoughts that were going through my head and wondered if anyone else <br/>
&gt; had <br/>
&gt;  some ideas about why as unschooling parents there is a focus on math and <br/>
&gt;  english and not other things.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there is a greater focus on these other things.  We just feel <br/>
comfortable enough finding our own resources that we don&#39;t worry about a (or <br/>
which) text book and don&#39;t feel the need to ask others for verification of <br/>
our decisions!<br/>
<br/>
I use textbook for math (Saxon).  It&#39;s not stressful for us.  We don&#39;t use it <br/>
at the prescribed pace.  We might ignore it for a while and then do a bunch.  <br/>
I use it to help me explore/explain math and science concepts ds will see <br/>
once he gets to college.  The math textbook is often a jumping off place for <br/>
other subjects, just like anything else we do.<br/>
<br/>
Why do I use a math textbook?  Because I want to be confident we&#39;ll cover <br/>
this material.  Many times we get to a concept and ds already understands it <br/>
quite nicely.  That is great!  Those lessons we skim over and I let him tell <br/>
me what the point is.  Then move on to the next.  We might go through several <br/>
lessons in this fashion.  No problem.  It is great confidence builder for <br/>
both of us.  DS recognizes he has been learning something and I&#39;ve just <br/>
accomplished an &#39;assessment&#39; of his progress pretty painlessly.  This helps <br/>
me have no hesitation to the nosey mother when she asks how ds is <br/>
doing...after all, we are constantly assessing him and I can respond that his <br/>
latest &#39;assessment&#39; shows marked improvement!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Having ds explain the concept to me is always great way to see inside this <br/>
kid&#39;s head and figure out how he&#39;s thinking.  I generally learn something <br/>
from him.<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 offspring...can&#39;t call them both boys since one is 22, married and a <br/>
daddy!  The other boy is 11.  I used to think that using a text for language <br/>
arts/english was important.  Especially things like spelling.  I&#39;ve decided <br/>
the heck with that!  Now ds asks about a word he needs to spell, I ask him <br/>
how he thinks it&#39;s spelled and help him correct any error.  He sees that his <br/>
spelling is improving dramatically and is gaining confidence that he can <br/>
spell/write well enough to communicate whatever he wants.  (isn&#39;t that the <br/>
whole goal/reason to learn to write/spell?  To communicate something?)  He <br/>
reads a LOT and I&#39;m certain that the process of reading reinforces <br/>
grammar/spelling concepts without any extra effort.<br/>
<br/>
Spelling and grammar were pretty hard for me to let go.  But I look at DH <br/>
(and many others) with high school graduation, military tech school, a bach <br/>
of science degree and  he can&#39;t spell worth beans and has me edit any formal <br/>
correspondence he is sending out.  Whereas I have no degrees and dropped out <br/>
of school at 17 (boredom and ready to get on with life).  Once I realized <br/>
that I&#39;ve done okay with myself, I felt much better about not formally <br/>
addressing many subjects.  I still feel the need for reference points from <br/>
math.  It may even be my need rather than my son&#39;s need.  But, it certainly <br/>
is not hurting him any!  <br/>
<br/>
Sure there are lots of other things that he picks on his own.  But, I figure <br/>
it&#39;s my responsibility to introduce some things in his life.  IMO, it&#39;s on a <br/>
level similar to teaching him to brush his teeth or wash his hands after <br/>
using the bathroom.  Those are not things he&#39;s likely to learn with no input <br/>
from his parents, and it&#39;s my responsibility to help him learn those good <br/>
habits.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a question:  Is using a computer program really any different than <br/>
using a textbook or classroom?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll go first...yes and no.  I use them and ds and I both love them.  There <br/>
is no resistance, he&#39;s playing a game.  He recognizes it&#39;s a &#39;school&#39; game, <br/>
but it doesn&#39;t put him off any.  He learns the material at a rapid pace in a <br/>
fun manner.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH there is less interaction between the two of us when he&#39;s using the <br/>
&#39;puter to learn something.  I like the interaction.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I use computer programs/games (or piano lessons, for that matter) <br/>
are pretty similar.  I want to be confident that the subject is presented to <br/>
ds in a way that encourages him to learn something that I think is important <br/>
for him to have in his life.  <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t use them (computer programs, textbooks, tutors, classes, etc.,) <br/>
exclusively, by any means!  They are launching places.  More like supplements <br/>
to the rest of our lives.  Something we do in between exploring other parts <br/>
of our world.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW,<br/>
