<div id="ygrps-yiv-484313873">I have a good friend who is coming to Columbia, from N.C.  while we are there to see Shannon Buckley and I.  She will only arrive on Sat. and will spend Sat. night at the hotel if she can get a room or somewhere else nearby.  She will be there with DH and kids.  She is fence sitting about hschooling in general and is toying with the idea of unschooling.  Would it be poss. for her to come to a talk or two?  How would that work?  I know you&#39;re crazy busy but any info. would be greatly appreciated.  She has very little money. <br/>

Does anyone know Kelly&#39;s personal Email addy? <br/>

spend Sat. night at the hotel if she can get a room or somewhere else<br/>
nearby.  She will be there with DH and kids.  She is fence sitting about<br/>
