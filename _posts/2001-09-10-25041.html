<br/>
I don&#39;t remember reading this.  What I remember is you posting require your<br/>
kids to write a certain amount each week.  If they don&#39;t do that and their<br/>
chores you restrict their &quot;autonomy&quot;.  You stated that the kids asked for<br/>
the structure but from everything you posted you say that you enforce it, in<br/>
one post you said you dictate what they do as far as writing each week.<br/>
<br/>
It has been repeatedly brought out that if you are quite willing for the<br/>
kids not to write if they choose not to and not to do any other<br/>
&quot;interesting&quot; stuff if the choose not to, if you are leaving these choices<br/>
up to them, then yes, that is unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My last post on this matter.<br/>

I know I said I had posted my last, but it is like a train wreck and I&#39;m the<br/>
rubber necker.<br/>

If you are concerned about Wyndam&#39;s television watching because of how it<br/>
might affect him at some future date (not getting up for work, not paying<br/>
bills), this again isn&#39;t unschooling.<br/>
Unschooling deals with the here and now.  How does watching too much<br/>
television (whatever that is) affect Wyndam as a 9yo boy today?  What is he<br/>
getting out of it today?  What else might interest him today?  What is he<br/>
avoiding today?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m really tired of discussing this but I would be interested in seeing<br/>
just exactly where I said I dictate WHAT they write.<br/>
Writng a certain amount is on the jobs list but only with their approval.<br/>
 And it is not so much their autonomy that gets restricted as it is their<br/>
ability to use my stuff and get me to do things for them.  But I am<br/>
waiting to see just where i said I tell them WHAT to write.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The speculative long term problems were sort of in answer to someone<br/>
else&#39;s question of would their TV reception get fuzzy if they watch too<br/>
much too.  As for Wyndham, left to his own obsessive nature, he would<br/>
watch TV and eat until he was an obese lump on the couch.  When we tell<br/>
him to shut it off and go find something else to do, there is usually not<br/>
a struggle over it (if there is, we talk about it and forge a compromise<br/>
because he usually just really wants to see something and is waiting for<br/>
it to come on.  We just tell him we&#39;ll tell him when it&#39;s time in that<br/>
case and he is happy.  Then we do tell him.)   But when he does turn it<br/>
off, he does go find something else to do.  BUT if we don&#39;t say it, he<br/>
would never shut it off.<br/>
