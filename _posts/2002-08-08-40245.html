&gt;<br/>
&gt;I saw this post while skimming yesterday. It is not my intent to embarrass <br/>
&gt;the OP, however, there are many practices described in here that are <br/>
&gt;inherently dangerous. Therefore, I am posting this to the list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Speaking of car seats........Those darn things take up too much room....<br/>
&gt;&gt;We have 7 kids and uh....you all know where I am going with that one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not sure how to address this. They take up too much room? As in, a seat <br/>
&gt;cannot be found to fit in this particular car, or more than one seat in a <br/>
&gt;row? This is a common issue, and different seats may have to be tried to <br/>
&gt;find ones that fit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;We have a van, but I don&#39;t see anyone handing me a a 9 & up passenger van<br/>
&gt;&gt;because they are complaining that I have a seat on the floor between 2<br/>
&gt;&gt;captain chairs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would not view this as complaining. This is another person expressing <br/>
&gt;their concern over a car seat being unrestrained. This is not only <br/>
&gt;dangerous for the child sitting in it, it is a potential hazard for <br/>
&gt;anybody sitting in the vehicle. The chances of this child being seriously <br/>
&gt;injured in even a minor fender bender are high. Head injury, striking <br/>
&gt;another person, flying through the windshield, literally bouncing off the <br/>
&gt;van walls - this does not paint a promising picture of walking away from a <br/>
&gt;collision injury free, let alone alive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;put her in their laps and seat belt the both of them and she<br/>
&gt;&gt;is content as a peach.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is a safety issue. I am sorry this child does not like sitting in her <br/>
&gt;seat. However, what is being described is *extremely* dangerous. Very <br/>
&gt;dangerous. Double buckling has a whole host of problems, and the injuries <br/>
&gt;will be swift and can easily result in death. A child this small sitting <br/>
&gt;in a regular seat belt could easily be ejected, or cut in half. Head <br/>
&gt;injuries from smacking into the person next to them or behind them. Speed <br/>
&gt;x weight = force. IOW, at 30 mph, a 10 lb child will weigh 300 lbs. How <br/>
&gt;much will your child weigh? Insert her weight into the formula. The <br/>
&gt;chances are, that double buckled like this, both children involved will <br/>
&gt;most likely be severely injured, if not killed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I realize that we all do the best we can. However, what is being described <br/>
&gt;is extremely dangerous. It sounds like that at times there are not enough <br/>
&gt;belts for everyone. We had this problem in my own family. For months we <br/>
&gt;took two cars everywhere we went. Or the only ppl that went were the ones <br/>
&gt;that would safely fit in one car. This is the price we must pay for living <br/>
&gt;in the age that we do. If we want to step into a huge hunk of metal and <br/>
&gt;drive 40, 50, or 60 mph, there are steps we must take to ensure that all <br/>
&gt;will make it out alive if anything were to happen. We can be as careful as <br/>
&gt;we want with our driving. It&#39;s the other driver that is unpredictable, and <br/>
&gt;that we cannot control. I am enclosing some links. Please read them. <br/>
&gt;Contact a coalition to have your car seats checked. Most places have <br/>
&gt;replacement seats available for free or a nominal cost. Or email me, I <br/>
&gt;will be happy to find a fitting station or technician that can help.<br/>
