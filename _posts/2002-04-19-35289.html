<div id="ygrps-yiv-922545872">Thanks Pam for being able to supply &quot;facts&quot; which I could not quote even<br/>
though I have heard and read them in the past.<br/>
<br/>
LOL  I am sitting here now, wondering what &quot;argument&quot; this will bring forth.<br/>
<br/>
Not that I consider it a contest but because it is obvious there are people<br/>
here who will disagree with anything that is said by just about anybody.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me there are a few very unhappy people on this list who<br/>
continuously like to jab at everybody and their thoughts, or opinions.  They<br/>
are determined to stir up things.<br/>
<br/>
It is really a shame because this could be a very beneficial list for most<br/>
people but others like to make it a miserable place to be.     Misery loves<br/>
company and all that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The thing of it is they change the *reporting* rules from time to time<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; &gt; you never know what counts and what does not count.  I think they should<br/>
&gt; &gt; either count it all or never change how they do it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My understanding is that there were changes made in 1994. So comparisons<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; years before and after 1994 are suspect (excuse the pun &lt;G&gt;). The changes<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; to do with how they get the crime rates for the US as a whole. Each local<br/>
&gt; jurisdiction reports, based on the very detailed requirements of the<br/>
uniform<br/>
&gt; reporting law. About 95 percent of local jurisdictions report. So - to get<br/>
&gt; the numbers for the country as a whole, they have to sort of fill in the<br/>
gaps<br/>
&gt; - estimate the rates for those counties, for example, that don&#39;t report.<br/>
They<br/>
&gt; do this based on information from other similar local areas. The<br/>
methodology<br/>
&gt; used for this estimation was changed in 1994.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think acts of terrorism are collected in a separate database by the<br/>
Justice<br/>
&gt; Department.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since the FBI crime statistics are really intended only to look at<br/>
reported<br/>
&gt; crimes, there is another database which complements it by looking at crime<br/>
&gt; from the point of view of victims. I believe it is based on surveys which<br/>
&gt; attempt to get a sense of how many unreported crimes there are. This is<br/>
&gt; called something like the National Victims of Crime Survey?? (Sorry - it<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; been a while since I studied these things.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149710241">Nope, I am not directing anything at anybody.  I have stated my opinion on<br/>
the crime thing and that is all I really have on it, just my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I shouldn&#39;t have gotten so *La-Ti-Dah* about the entire thing.  I apologize<br/>
if I have offended anybody.<br/>
<br/>
I also apologize for being *disruptive* to this group.<br/>
I have been corrected and am trying to keep quiet now.<br/>
I have said enough.  Some appreciated it, some did not.<br/>
