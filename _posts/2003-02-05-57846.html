ganged up on her..LOL  I dont really care too much about being pushy.... I <br/>
would have just said. Oh , heck, we dont do any of that.. LOL.. .<br/>
<br/>
I havent said anything.. but my Grandpa died on Friday.. He was 91.  We were <br/>
busy with visiting and the services all weekend and yesterday.  I went over <br/>
to my Moms today ( it was her Dad) .. She was so heart broken.. when I called <br/>
her this morning, she said she just hadnt really had time to greive.  I took <br/>
lunch over to her and Dad.. My sister came over too and we just sat around <br/>
and talked about Grandpa.   He had been sick for about 6 mos.. REALLY sick <br/>
for about 3 mos.. My mom and her 3 sisters took care of him round the <br/>
clock... They took &quot;shifts&quot;  Mom and one of her sisters works a 40 hr job.. <br/>
and her youngest sister had 2 teenagers and started going back to school this <br/>
semester ( she lost her job of 19 years in Oct.)..   Anyway,  it has been <br/>
stressful to say the least.. He&#39;s not in pain, he&#39;s gone and now everyone can <br/>
go on with thier lives.. Oh, except for now taking care of Grandma ( <br/>
emotionally and mentally more than physically)  They were married for 67 <br/>
years.. Just imagine.. that many years together.. raising 7 children....  I <br/>
was thinking today. Grandpa retired at 65.. Thats almost 30 years they were <br/>
JUST THEM.. 24/7.. .. What a huge adjustment for Grandma.   Anyway, one <br/>
reason I hadnt said anything is because I knew once I started writing, I <br/>
would start to ramble.  :-)   <br/>

I&#39;m sorry to hear about your Grandpa. That has to be especially hard on<br/>
your Grandmother. Wow! 67 years! What an inspiration! Take care of<br/>
yourself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014628902">My condolences to you and your family Teresa,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But what a wonderful, full and rich life he must have lived! and 67 years of<br/>
marriage!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine how hard this is going to be on Grandma.  Hugs to her....and<br/>
to the rest of your family... Is the talk about moving her in with someone<br/>
or would that be too hard on her too? To give up her independence and her<br/>
home. <br/>
<br/>
hugs to you all,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>
Rachel Ann<br/>
