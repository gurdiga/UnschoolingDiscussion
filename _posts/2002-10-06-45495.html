&gt;&lt;&lt; The hormones that were causing post partum depression could have been <br/>

&gt; there is something wrong with their children so they should kill <br/>
&gt; them.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Obviously, Andrea Yates is an extreme example. But I think it&#39;s rather <br/>
&gt;simplistic to say that she could just be cured with a homeopathic remedy. She <br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t want the baby to begin with, that is a huge warning sign.<br/>
&gt;Can homeopathic remedies make people want a baby they didn&#39;t want?<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t answer that, we use homeopathic remedies here, I&#39;m aware of how they <br/>
&gt;work.<br/>
&gt;Yes, it can cure hormone imbalance due to post partum stuff.<br/>
&gt;But you are forgetting that she had circumstances foisted upon her that she <br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t want.<br/>
&gt;The &quot;cure&quot; is to quit making women do things to please some angry God (which <br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t actually believe that he is an angry God, but apparently some do) or <br/>
&gt;their dh&#39;s without regards to their own health.<br/>

Um, I&#39;m not exactly sure what you think we&#39;re doing wrong, we&#39;re not <br/>
sending them to you privately. Anyway, sometimes after you send an email to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> it takes a while for the <br/>
program to get you off the list. Just be patient, please. I would suggest <br/>
sending an email to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@yahoogroups.com">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@yahoogroups.com</a> , or <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:support@yahoogroups.com">support@yahoogroups.com</a> if you continue to receive unwanted mail from this <br/>
list.<br/>
