When you give a lesson in meanness to a critter or a person, don&#39;t be<br/>
surprised if they learn their lesson. ~~ Will Rogers ~~<br/>

<br/>
LETTER TO MY NEUROSURGEON<br/>
http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/194.html<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...You see, we don&#39;t really homeschool at the kitchen table. Few <br/>
homeschoolers do, though that is the image the media has chosen to <br/>
give us. Our kitchen table is generally too full of various projects <br/>
to accommodate bookwork. Once it was Native American pottery (our <br/>
version of it, anyway). Another time leaves of all colors and sizes <br/>
covered the surface as we painstakingly ironed delicate window <br/>
decorations. Often times my inventive, creative daughter usurps the <br/>
table for her own purposes, leaving us to eat in the living room once <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Much of our homeschooling has taken place outside, in fields, on <br/>
rivers, in the forests, and near ponds. Sometimes our homeschool <br/>
comes from investigating odd parts of town, discovering old shops and <br/>
unusual restaurants. So much of our homeschool comes from the library <br/>
that we practically live there, volunteering when we can. We&#39;ve spent <br/>
lots of time learning with friends, girl scouting, science club, <br/>
sports and other pursuits that throw us together with people of all <br/>
ages and interests.<br/>
<br/>
Quite frankly, none of this would be possible without me. I am <br/>
pivotal to this life of ours. The facilitator, the nutritionist, the <br/>
scheduler, and the protector. I am the dreamer who envisions what <br/>
learning and life can be and I am the bricklayer who lays the <br/>
foundation. I am the one who lights the candles and adds the fresh <br/>
flowers. I am the one who wraps the children up in the middle of the <br/>
night and serves their hot chocolate outside so they can watch stars <br/>
streaking across the sky. I am the one who warms the honey-colored <br/>
beeswax so they can create fragrant models. I am the one who once <br/>
filled an entire high school auditorium with homeschoolers so that my <br/>
own children could watch knights joust and sword fight. I help them <br/>
find mentors, take classes, and shape dreams. As they grow older, I <br/>
help them plan their lives and listen to their hopes and aspirations.<br/>
<br/>
I often think that homeschooling moms overlook just how important <br/>
they are. Do any of us wonder just what might happen to their <br/>
families if they weren&#39;t there? I have had to do this and it&#39;s <br/>
frightening...&quot; ~~ excerpt from Teri Brown&#39;s article in the <br/>
July/August issue of Home Education Magazine ~~<br/>
<br/>
You can read the rest of this thought-provoking story, as well as a <br/>
couple of articles and columns from the July/August issue at the <br/>
address above, but you&#39;ll have to get the magazine--the one you hold <br/>
in your hands--to read them all! See special subscription information <br/>
at the end of this newsletter or visit your local bookseller to get <br/>
your copy today.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
VISUAL THESAURUS<br/>
http://www.plumbdesign.com/thesaurus<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how to convince you a thesaurus can be exciting, but it <br/>
can! The Visual Thesaurus at http://www.plumbdesign.com/thesaurus <br/>
gives you a 3-D view of a particular word and its synonyms, with the <br/>
closest relatives in bolder type and the second and third cousins <br/>
fading to the back. You can click on any of the synonyms to bring it <br/>
front and center along with its own synonyms, creating a kind of <br/>
trail of meanings that can take some interesting turns. Use the <br/>
applet in the bottom left corner to change nouns to verbs and verbs <br/>
to adjectives or adverbs, or click on auto-navigate and just watch <br/>
the program gently change on its own. This is truly an elegant <br/>
program.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
ASK CAROL<br/>
<br/>
In addition to editing this newsletter, I write a column for Home <br/>
Education Magazine. Now, I don&#39;t want to take Ann Lander&#39;s place, but <br/>
I will take those thorny questions and problems you struggle with and <br/>
try to give you some options or information that might help you. <br/>
Although I don&#39;t answer the questions in this newsletter, I do answer <br/>
them in every issue of HEM, the original print version where <br/>
homeschoolers have found support for over 20 years. A couple of them <br/>
are online (http://www.home-ed-magazine.com), but most you have to <br/>
read in the magazine.<br/>
<br/>
I really like to get your questions-any questions at all, even if you <br/>
think your question is too stupid and you&#39;re the only one who has <br/>
your particular problem (probably not true). So, don&#39;t be shy; don&#39;t <br/>
procrastinate; send me your questions. I even have a special email <br/>
address: askcarol@... . Of course, I don&#39;t promise I <br/>
can answer every question in the magazine (especially if you don&#39;t <br/>
send one!), but I try to respond to each one, whether I use it for a <br/>
column or not. Don&#39;t wait! (~ CN ~)<br/>

<br/>
UNSCHOOLING.COM<br/>
http://www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
&quot;As an electrical engineer (in my former life) I took a *lot* of math <br/>
(4 years in HS and at least 10 course in college.) I love math. I did <br/>
well at math. School math is like puzzles for me. Lots of pattern <br/>
recognition.<br/>
<br/>
But that helped me not at all in electrical engineering because what <br/>
generalized subjects lack is *context*. Being able to solve numerous <br/>
examples of the various types of problems is the details when someone <br/>
has no experience with the big picture. Being able to find the slope <br/>
of a line during the chapter on finding the slope of a line is <br/>
jumping through hoops so teachers can demonstrate to administrators, <br/>
the state and parents that a concept was taught. It&#39;s meaningless -- <br/>
I&#39;m betting most people here who took algebra can&#39;t say why they&#39;d <br/>
want to find the slope of a line! -- when the kids have never <br/>
experienced needing a line graph for personally meaningful reasons <br/>
nor experienced how the slope of a line that results from some real <br/>
problem is important and how a different slope would affect the <br/>
meaning of the outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing how to do percentage problems before you&#39;ve experienced <br/>
dozens of different ways percentages are used in real life, before <br/>
you&#39;ve actually had to use the *concept* of percentage is like <br/>
learning how to spell before you can speak.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling provides kids with the opportunities to experience how <br/>
math is used in real life. They don&#39;t need to do a bazillion problems <br/>
to understand the details. They need years of experience with how the <br/>
concepts are used in real contexts. After they understand the context <br/>
then the details -- that schooled kids take 12 years to learn -- are <br/>
learned in minutes and hours.&quot;  ~~ Joyce Fetteroll at the <br/>
unschooling.com message boards ~~<br/>

LINDA DOBSON GOES MAINSTREAM<br/>
<br/>
 From the Prima Publishing website <br/>
(http://www.primapublishing.com/index.php): &quot;The August 2002 issue of <br/>
Better Homes and Gardens will contain an article on homeschooling <br/>
with Prima&#39;s Linda Dobson extensively quoted. Linda is the author of <br/>
&#39;The First Year of Homeschooling Your Child,&#39; &#39;Homeschoolers&#39; Success <br/>
Stories,&#39; &#39;The Homeschooling Book of Answers,&#39; &#39;Homeschooling: The <br/>
Early Years,&#39; and coming in November 2002 &#39;The Ultimate Book of <br/>
Homeschooling Ideas.&#39; The last book is how she is identified in the <br/>
article.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And, &quot;The September 2002 issue of Reader&#39;s Digest will feature an <br/>
article about homeschooling which includes quotes from author Linda <br/>
Dobson...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow! Linda&#39;s taking homeschooling out into the world! You can read <br/>
more of Linda&#39;s writing in every issue of Home Education Magazine and <br/>
even hear her speak at the California Home=Education Conference (see <br/>

MYTH AMERICA<br/>
<br/>
HEM Online News subscriber Susan Foreman writes: &quot;I wanted to let <br/>
readers know of a really neat half hour show on the Discovery <br/>
Civilization Channel called &#39;Myth America.&#39;   A few of the shows I&#39;ve <br/>
seen included myths about American presidents, the American flag, <br/>
celebrations, the Liberty Bell and other historical &#39;facts&#39; we&#39;ve <br/>
been taught in textbooks and/or school growing up.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the American flag was a subject of indifference until <br/>
well after George Washington fought in battle - the pictures of him <br/>
in the boat with the flag are a fabrication of the artist! In that <br/>
same show it featured Betsy Ross&#39;s involvement or lack thereof with <br/>
the flag.  Very interesting stuff!   The episode featuring the <br/>
origins of today&#39;s popular celebrations and holidays was <br/>
enlightening! Perhaps it may be of interest to others who receive <br/>
this terrific e-newsletter - keep up the good work!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Susan. I need to convince my cable company to add Discovery <br/>
Civilization Channel to my cable lineup just so I can see this show. <br/>
I looked at their website at http://civilization.discovery.com, and <br/>
it looks like another excellent channel from the same people who <br/>
bring us Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet and other learning <br/>
channels. Myth America airs at 7pm every night. ~CN~<br/>

<br/>
BOOKCROSSING.COM<br/>
Press Release<br/>
http://www.bookcrossing.com<br/>
<br/>
You are cordially invited to play a part in an unlikely global <br/>
sociology experiment spearheaded by a year-old Web site called <br/>
BookCrossing.com: Lose your books.<br/>
<br/>
The brainchild of a group of Kansas City-based computer consultants, <br/>
BookCrossing.com encourages people to experience what it terms &quot;the <br/>
karma of literature&quot; by registering books at the site and then <br/>
leaving them behind in public places, like coffee shops, airplanes, <br/>
and park benches, reports Book magazine.<br/>
<br/>
Part book club, part behavioral study, part message in a bottle, it&#39;s <br/>
a concept made entirely possible by the Internet. Every book <br/>
registered at BookCrossing.com receives a unique ID number and a <br/>
registration card which can be printed out and attached inside the <br/>
front cover. The card explains the Book Crossing&#39;s mission and <br/>
directs anyone who finds a book toward its dedicated online journal <br/>
page. There, recipients can post where they came across the book and, <br/>
if they read it, what they thought of it.<br/>
<br/>
In keeping with a favorite BookCrossing.com mantra, finders are not <br/>
encouraged to become keepers. &quot;We call it &#39;read and release,&#39; &quot; says <br/>
co-founder Ron Allen Hornbaker. &quot;It gives people a way to share their <br/>
books without feeling like they&#39;re losing something. I think of it as <br/>
letting something go as a means of keeping it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The site makes no money, doesn&#39;t advertise, and relies entirely on <br/>
word-of-mouth promotion. So far, that low-key strategy is yielding <br/>
good results. As of mid-June, the site boasted listings of 24,222 <br/>
individual books and 10,042 members.<br/>
<br/>
* This is terribly intriguing for a confirmed book addict like me. <br/>
There&#39;s even a place on the website where you can look up the book <br/>
releases in your city or town, and see where they occurred. What will <br/>
people think of next? ~CN~<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
FIRSTGOV FOR KIDS<br/>
http://www.kids.gov<br/>
<br/>
The Federal Consumer Information Center, that place that sends out <br/>
the free and almost free brochures on everything from windmills to <br/>
buying a new car, has put together a great site for kids (you&#39;ll like <br/>
it too). Lists of links are categorized into 20 subject areas <br/>
including art, music, recreation, and transportation. You&#39;ll even <br/>
find a list of sites just for your state.<br/>
<br/>
While you&#39;re at it, you might as well check out the Federal Consumer <br/>
Information Catalog from the link on the FirstGov site. Those <br/>
pamphlets that used to cost fifty cents or a dollar are now free <br/>
online. They also offer a lot of other information and services for <br/>
consumers. Isn&#39;t the Internet great?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
NATIONAL HOME EDUCATION NETWORK<br/>
http://www.nhen.org<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t taken a look at the NHEN website in a while, you need <br/>
to go there NOW and see what this organization is doing. I can&#39;t <br/>
believe it&#39;s only been 2 years since a handful of hard-working, <br/>
dedicated homeschoolers banded together to create a creative, dynamic <br/>
homeschool organization for all homeschoolers. They have so much to <br/>
offer-information, advocacy, discussion lists, newsletters (NHENotes <br/>
is great!), and even t-shirts and tote bags.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t joined yet, why not do what thousands of homeschoolers <br/>
have done in the past 2 years? Get over there and sign up. We are <br/>
powerful when we stand together!<br/>
