<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026027316">Mook (3yob) has an eye infection.  The doctor says if we don&#39;t put<br/>
eye <br/>
drops in Mook&#39;s eyes, he&#39;ll go blind.  Mook hates eye drops, and with <br/>
all the squirming, screaming, and tears, I don&#39;t think anything gets <br/>
in his eyes anyway.  His infection is getting worse.  DH forces the <br/>
eye drops (why he was screaming, etc).  I tried to be more gentle,<br/>
but <br/>
Mook just runs away and says he&#39;s not ready yet.  He needs these<br/>
drops <br/>
in four times a day.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ready to make the decision<br/>
to <br/>
become blind (he says he&#39;d rather be blind than have eye drops).<br/>
<br/>
What do I do?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-220133835">My daughter wants to re-do her room.  She has paneled walls and wants them to look like drywall.  Drywall is not nearly as durable as paneling and is a pain to install.<br/>
<br/>
Someone suggested using wallpaper liner to cover the paneling.<br/>
<br/>
Can you paint wallpaper liner?  Or do you have to get the &quot;paintable&quot; kind.<br/>
<br/>
Is it better to get prepasted or not?<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone ever done this?  any tips or advice?  I&#39;ve never even hung regular wallpaper!!!! LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-179334533">I had once thought about doing it for my mother, but never got around to it. But here are <br/>
some good articles about it--I just typed &quot;painting or wallpaper over panelling&quot; in the <br/>
google search box. There are lots more:<br/>

Hey, I&#39;m sick in bed this week, so this kind of surfing beats watching yet another TV <br/>

I&#39;m addicted to the food network, it&#39;s on (almost) all day in our <br/>
house.  My DH told me the other day that I either had to actually <br/>
cook something from one of the shows or quit watching it!  LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491668488">I thought I saw on a design show (I&#39;m addicted to those kind ;&#39;) that <br/>
you could use spackle/filler in the seams between the fake boards, sand <br/>
flush with the paneling, then prime all of the paneling and filler <br/>
before painting it.  Look it up though before trying it because I&#39;m not <br/>
100% of my memory of that show.  LOL<br/>
