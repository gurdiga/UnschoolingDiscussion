&gt; You can fly to Dulles( Minn-London flights go via Dulles). I&#39;ll join<br/>
&gt; you onna plane and off we go. See London. Camp with 1500 mainly<br/>
&gt; unschoolers and then drink wine in France.<br/>
&gt; Sound good?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep!  I definitey want to go.  I&#39;d about given up hope on getting to an<br/>
unschooling conference while over here.  I forget England is so close!<br/>
<br/>
Eveytime you write something, Shyrley, I get more excited!  Hurry up, May.<br/>
I know my husband won&#39;t be coming, either.  Heck, by May, who knows where<br/>
he&#39;ll even be.<br/>

confirm your reservation closer to the actual date!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

amble along the south coast.<br/>
If you realy come closer to the date I will post a description of the <br/>
campground so we can pitch tents near each other - there&#39;s no <br/>
designed lots, you just pitch where there&#39;s a space.<br/>
Y&#39;all have to fly little US flags :-)<br/>
