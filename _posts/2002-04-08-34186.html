Then it is not unschooling. It is not a bash to be an eclectic homeschooler. But as long as you are the ultimate authority or last word in what they do (even if it occassionally), then it is not unschooling. Plain & simple.<br/>

(Although I dislike labels, and try very hard to avoid labeling others for <br/>
that reason, and appreciate others who similarly refrain from labeling me and <br/>
others.)  <br/>
<br/>
Regarding being the &quot;ultimate authority or last word in what they do&quot; -- good <br/>
Lord, does anyone really think they&#39;re THAT?!?  I sure don&#39;t.  I&#39;m not even <br/>
the ultimate authority or last word on what I do, never mind on what someone <br/>
else does!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This statement just says that you don&#39;t yet *get* unschooling.  Unschooling <br/>
isn&#39;t about what you do or don&#39;t do.  It&#39;s much more a state of mind.  And <br/>
I don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s a state of mind that can be turned on or off at <br/>
the parent&#39;s convenience.<br/>

learning and figure out how to unsubscribe yourself! I&#39;m serious, really.<br/>
It&#39;s not hard to do...<br/>

of &quot;every other unschooler in the world&quot;, what you&#39;re thinking about<br/>
isn&#39;t unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
If my view of something was different from that of  everyone else in the<br/>
world, I&#39;d rethink my view..<br/>
