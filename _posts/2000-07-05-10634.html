<div id="ygrps-yiv-157901279"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;It is<br/>
&gt;set during the large migration from Appalachia to Detroit &gt;during World War<br/>
&gt;II.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wasn&#39;t The Dollmaker by Harriet Arnow made into a movie?  I want to say<br/>
someone like Jane Fonda was in the starring role?  Maybe a Hallmark<br/>
presentations?<br/>
<br/>
Your discription of the book triggered this half-memory of mine and the<br/>
movie was very poignant.<br/>
