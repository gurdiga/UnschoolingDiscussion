  And....And.... And.... .oh to say this gently.... I am thrilled to know<br/>
she is not ready to *school* with you. I&#39;m absolutely in love with her. She<br/>
knows in her heart who she is and that&#39;s she&#39;s glorious just as she is.<br/>
She&#39;s not bending to the expectation that she should be her brother.  Give<br/>
her some kisses for me, will ya.<br/>
<br/>
This baby is 4.  ;)  How can a 4 year old be behind???  Just because one<br/>
child read at 4 does not mean anything close to the assumption all children<br/>
are ready to read at 4.  .  Your son was very, very, very early ----<br/>
<br/>
You could send her to school.....and they would get her ready for<br/>
schooling...and then you could school her some more..... but how very awful<br/>
that would be. She&#39;d have to pretzel herself into a chair and learn to do<br/>
what others want, instead of unfolding and growing into herself.<br/>
<br/>
Your paragraph down there about hospitals doing things and then recusing you<br/>
from the things they do... well that&#39;s what schools would do to your<br/>
daughter.  But even they would not label her behind at 4.<br/>
<br/>
This child is teaching you your very first and most important lesson about<br/>
homeschooling.  Learning at home is about being able to grow and learn at<br/>
your own pace. It&#39;s about the joyous exploration of the world. If you push<br/>
to out school the school, you&#39;ll take away all the sweetness of being home.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well my first question would be, why the big hurry?  I mean, she&#39;s four!  Depending on what state you are in, some do not require any semblance of schooling of any kind until the child is 7 or 8, at which time it becomes a legal matter (ie:  they must be enrolled or homeschooled, etc)  Frankly, I think you are stressing over a non-issue.  Give her a couple more years to be a kid and not worry about all that gobbledegook.  She may just amaze you with what she does all on her own in that time, and help give you the confidence you need to continue letting her lead her studies.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I agree. I was that way with my first son. Why 
can&#39;t he do this or that. When I finally decided to sit back and relax a bit it 
clicked for him. We played a lot of games and for him it helped. There are some 
great games out there for young children. A lot of the different homeschool 
catalogs have games in them that you may not see at a local store. </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I also caught my self doing well so-and-so child 
can do this. Something must be wrong. Don&#39;t worry she will amaze you. Just sit 
back and listen to her play. You might be surprised at what she actually 
knows.</font></div>
