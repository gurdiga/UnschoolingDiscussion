<div id="ygrps-yiv-310121374">Thanks for all the wonderful responses I got about the violin and my 5 yr <br/>
old daughter. I really appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
  The question that really made me think is <br/>
&quot;Why can&#39;t she take violin now?&quot;.   <br/>
I needed to hear that. If she&#39;s passionate about it...then she SHOULD take <br/>
it. ( her brother 7 takes piano AND guitar).<br/>
But I think other reasons are that she already takes piano.... and she is <br/>
only 5. <br/>
A  few questions I need to ponder:<br/>
Should it be in addition to piano?<br/>
Should she stop piano?...(even though we encourage our kids to finish out the <br/>
year and then re-evaluate). <br/>
She does like piano, she only started this past summer.<br/>
<br/>
  I think I will take a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach for just a few months. Life <br/>
IS a bit busy now (we are also building a house... ourselves&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;).<br/>
  <br/>
  I just got a real violin on ebay for her . And even if we get a better <br/>
violin  (or rent one) when she starts lessons, it was worth the price not to get a <br/>
&quot;toy&quot; one.<br/>
   <br/>
Thanks again for your words of wisdom!<br/>
~Marcia...who thinks SHE may also take up violin in the near future <br/>

*****************************************<br/>
If you can swing it I&#39;d do both.  There&#39;s a boy in our homeschool group who <br/>
plays both.  Once you get one instrument down, others come more easily.  <br/>
<br/>
Growing up one of my best friends played Cello, Saxophone, and Piano.  All 3 <br/>
of her brothers each played 2 or 3 instruments.  I was always so envious.  I <br/>
remember plain as day, when the music teacher came into our classroom (4th <br/>
grade) and I answered the questions he asked the class easily.  He said I have <br/>
&quot;violin hands.&quot;  I was so excited and went home and asked my parents if I could <br/>
take violin at school.  They said no, because I was already taking piano <br/>
lessons.  I had always wanted to and finally took the plunge and started learning <br/>
about 3 years ago.  It has always been a sore spot with me.  I understood my <br/>
parents probably couldn&#39;t afford it, but I think they were thinking more that one <br/>
instrument was enough.  <br/>
<br/>
So at least let her try it!!  LOL!!  <br/>

**Hi Marcia - I&#39;d ask Chloe what she wants to do.  Does she want to do both?<br/>
If so, why not give it a try?  If it doesn&#39;t work out she can always stop<br/>
one or the other, or both.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d let her stop piano if she wants to (although it doesn&#39;t sound like she<br/>
does).  Why wait til the end of the year?  (and what year? the school year?)<br/>
Nice to see you here :0).  ~Rue<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Rue!<br/>
  Choe does want both ..I asked her. ( Hmmm..why I didn&#39;t think to ASK her <br/>
myself! &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;)<br/>
So...I think after the first of the year I will make a phone call to a <br/>
suzucki violin teacher who lives in my town.<br/>
If two instruments seem to be too much then she can give one up..but honestly <br/>
she does have the time to do it. ahhh...homeschooling..or better yet  <br/>
Unschooling!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I confess...yes the school year. UGH  See? Old habits are hard to break I <br/>
guess. It&#39;s that darn school mentality that used to rule my life. I&#39;m working on <br/>
that &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;  Nice to see you here :0).  ~Rue &lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks! It&#39;s great to be here. I have learned soooo much already and am <br/>
feeling quite confident in this new venture of ours...unschooling...or should I say <br/>
&quot;just living life&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
