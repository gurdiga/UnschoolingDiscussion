 Hi Lisa,<br/>
 <br/>
 Thanks for responding.  I&#39;ve been thinking about the diploma thing lately, <br/>
and<br/>
 was wondering what those who are on this loop have decided to do about it, if<br/>
 anything.<br/>

<br/>
I am Elizabeth. I have been lurking here.  We live in Louisiana where we have <br/>
the option to register as a private school.  My daughter is fifteen and we <br/>
generally have not worried about a diploma at all.  Sometimes we think about <br/>
making one of our own when the time comes, but she doesn&#39;t really seem to <br/>
care one way of the other.  <br/>
<br/>
You do not need a high school diploma or a GED to attend college, which is <br/>
her plan.  But we still waffle back and forth.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

I have been reading this thread with amusement and interest.  Here is OUR <br/>
story.<br/>
<br/>
My son has enrolled in a program here in WA state called &quot;Running Start&quot;.  He <br/>
is able to (as a Jr. in High School) have a dual enrollment type of situation <br/>
where he can take both High School and College classes, receiving credit for <br/>
both.  When we met with the High School Counselor, he asked if we intended to <br/>
get a High School Diploma, we said &quot;yes&quot;.  He then explained that the high <br/>
school would not be willing to give him any credits for his first 2 years of <br/>
high school even though he had accomplished a great many things in English <br/>
and Mathematics (required courses).  They were going to require him to <br/>
fulfill 4 years of High School English, Math and History credits - without <br/>
testing him, without being willing to see if he had already covered those <br/>
areas.  When I asked if he would get his 2 year degree (An Associates Degree) <br/>
they said &quot;yes, of course he will still get that, BUT he won&#39;t have a high <br/>
school diploma!&quot;  Well - HELLLLOOOO????  Do we really CARE if he has a <br/>
diploma?  He will have the first 2 years of his college education under his <br/>
belt, and a &quot;piece of paper&quot; to prove THAT!!  Are &quot;they&quot; going to ask if he <br/>
has a HIGH SCHOOL diploma if he has an AA??  Don&#39;t think so.  The counselor <br/>
was astounded that we didn&#39;t CARE about the diploma, as long as he gets the <br/>
AA.  See, my son wants to get his AA in Pre-law and then join the Navy and <br/>
get into Law School.  A diploma is NOT the be all and end all -- there are <br/>
MANY ways to accomplish what is important without that fancy scripted piece <br/>
of paper.<br/>

LOL, Mary they told my daughter well you&#39;ll miss out on so much here at the <br/>
high school.  She told them she&#39;d left over a year ago and hadn&#39;t missed a <br/>
blasted thing.  They did however issue the diploma....<br/>
