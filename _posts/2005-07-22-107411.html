<div id="ygrps-yiv-153016130">For those who might be interested ... <br/>
<br/>
After MUCH thought, discussion, etc, I have decided to NOT implement <br/>
a point/prize system in my piano studio this fall. I realized my <br/>
main concern was not &quot;getting them motivated&quot; or &quot;getting them to do <br/>
something&quot; but rather to just keep better track of what was <br/>
happening. So I will instead be implementing a simple spreadsheet <br/>
for each student where I can check off anything from when I&#39;ve been <br/>
paid to which scales have been done, whether a song has been <br/>
memorized, etc. The students can see their accomplishments/progress <br/>
and I can have a better idea of what&#39;s going on with everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I&#39;ll have some cheap toys at our piano pizza parties, as <br/>
sort of party favors. Or maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
In case you&#39;re curious ... the reasons I decided against the prizes <br/>
was because 1) Frankly, it seemed like a lot of work and hassle to <br/>
have to worry about; 2) Even though I think the kids would like it, <br/>
I just couldn&#39;t get past the idea of feeling like I&#39;d be treating <br/>
them like trained seals.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks a lot for the food for thought. I enjoy this list a <br/>
lot, even though I rarely post.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771105716">FWIW My kids sometimes ask me to help them learn a song or skill or<br/>
otherwise give them a &quot;lesson&quot; at the piano but they&#39;re not regular weekly<br/>
events.  Sometimes more, usualy much less.  But anyway, I always let them<br/>
pick a sticker to put on the page when they start a new piece or lesson.<br/>
That way they know what pieces they&#39;ve been working on and when they see the<br/>
stickers they can say Oh, I remember this one, or Gee I don&#39;t remember this<br/>
one , mom,   How does it go?  The stickers aren&#39;t rewards, they&#39;re just<br/>
celebrations of starting something new.</div>
