&lt;&lt; Yu-gi-oh is social interactions.  If he prefers it in any one instance to <br/>
 another social interaction, it seems he&#39;s be the best judge of that. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes. My boys spend most of their &quot;resource day&quot; (a get together with other <br/>
relaxed/eclectic homeschoolers and unschoolers once a week) playing Yugioh or <br/>
Mage Knight.<br/>
I don&#39;t see all their enjoyment of this game as a waste of time, even though <br/>
they exclude other things to play that sometimes.  The artwork on the cards <br/>
has inspired them more times than I can say, the friendships they&#39;ve built <br/>
around the game are wonderful, the logic and strategy of the game are firing <br/>
of new neural pathways like mad I&#39;m quite sure!!<br/>
Anything that holds their fascination so deeply must be important for their <br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
My kids would rarely turn down any kind of excursion to stay home and watch <br/>
tv, but if they did, I would assume that&#39;s what was important for them at <br/>
that moment.<br/>
Since letting go of control, I&#39;ve been through some bumpy times where I <br/>
really believed my oldest would never learn to self regulate. But we&#39;ve <br/>
emerged on the other side of freedom, joy intact and I get the privelege of <br/>
seeing the truth spoken here come true!<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, Jared went outside first thing in the morning. He was out playing <br/>
with sticks in the backyard, just hanging out. The video games and tv lay <br/>
dormant.<br/>
I got myself, Jalen and Sierra ready and we joined him. We went down to the <br/>
pond and mucked out their Tonka trucks which had layed in the pond mud for <br/>
the last year largely ignored.<br/>
We got them scrubbed off (I&#39;m surprised no frogs had taken up residence) and <br/>
the kids found an area of the yard to dig in for the day.  This inspired me <br/>
to get an area on the side of the house cleaned up for them.  <br/>
Trevor had joined us at this point and helped me haul a bunch of pine needles <br/>
up to the street, raking and uncovering some garden beds we put in last year.<br/>
All this dirt play, raking and WORK was being done at the exclusion of <br/>
tv/video games. <br/>
They had full choice, but they chose outside yesterday.<br/>
Trevor drifted in and out, watching tv and playing games some and then <br/>
hanging out with the rest of us outside for periods of time.<br/>
The other three spent the ENTIRE day outside, only coming in to eat or drink <br/>
or use the bathroom.<br/>
They built dirt castles, sculpted a dolphin in the dirt, raked, hoed, planned <br/>
a fort, planted garlic in a garden bed, mucked around by the pond and dug <br/>
with their Tonka trucks.<br/>
Later, we all went out for pizza (at Sams club of all places) and Jared <br/>
picked out a new GBA game, &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot;.  We stopped and rented a movie <br/>
on the way home and while the rest of us watched Men in Black 2, Jared sat <br/>
with us and played his game, barely looking up.<br/>
Free choice is awesome and powerful stuff!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I think it&#39;s a mistake to zero in on what the child is doing as the <br/>
problem.<br/>
 The problem lies in *why* the child is not happy. If a child is freely<br/>
 choosing (of whatever) and isn&#39;t happy, then the problem is helping them<br/>
 help themselves be happy. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In our house it was my control that wouldn&#39;t allow Trevor to happily self <br/>
regulate.<br/>
I would freak out every so often, because he&#39;d been at the tv ALL day, hours <br/>
and hours and he would be bummed out that he hadn&#39;t done anything else.<br/>
But when I suggested turning it off and coming to do other things, he <br/>
couldn&#39;t tear himeself away.<br/>
I finally realized that after a while, he&#39;d have his fill, realize that I <br/>
wasn&#39;t going to jump in a control again and he&#39;d mellow out and move on.<br/>
I decided that even if it took two years, it wasn&#39;t going to hurt him in the <br/>
long run.<br/>
It took over a year. About 1.5 years actually of rather obsessive behavior.<br/>
But you know what?<br/>
He trusts me now.<br/>
He knows he has access to tv and video games whenever he wants it and it <br/>
doesn&#39;t have the hold over him that it did before.<br/>
I explained to him that I would nudge him to do other things and help him <br/>
feel better by doing other stuff, but I wouldn&#39;t make him, he had to decide <br/>
what was more important.<br/>
He chooses  a lot of different things now. A very intelligent and well <br/>
balanced person (although some  here would see the hours and hours spent on <br/>
Yugioh and video games and not consider it a balance perhaps) that knows a <br/>
lot about a LOT of different things.<br/>
Tv taught him a lot in that time.<br/>
It didn&#39;t damage him and in fact, he knows himself better now.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t hold any power over him or his life, but it would if I hadn&#39;t <br/>
finally said &quot;no more controlling this child!!&quot;<br/>
Sometimes you can nudge or suggest, but giving your child their freedom of <br/>
choice is possibly the only way to get to that unschooling Nirvana.....<br/>

 I think too often we deem a certain method of childrearing will lead to a<br/>
 certain outcome, and I&#39;m not certain it is true. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think for most of us &quot;outcome&quot; is not the goal. It&#39;s about living in a way <br/>
that brings the most joy, the most happiness and the best relationships right <br/>
NOW.<br/>
If the outcome is good (&#39;course when do you decide that there is &quot;outcome&quot;? <br/>
age 18, 30, 60?) that&#39;s just a side benefit from living mindfully.<br/>
Nothing is guaranteed in this life, certainly.<br/>
Even more reason to live happily TODAY. I may not have my loved one tomorrow, <br/>
or they might now have me.<br/>
