&lt;&lt;  GED&#39;s are a tool, for sure, and so are college <br/>
 entrance exams, but there&#39;s no scholarships available for kids <br/>
 without a history of doing very well academically. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that.<br/>
I know homeschooled kids that got scholarships based more on community <br/>
service and involvement with the things they enjoyed rather than on academics.<br/>
You do have to keep logs of what they do through the years, but I do that as <br/>
a memory book anyway.<br/>
<br/>
What about a community college?<br/>
It&#39;s inexpensive. And he could work part time to help pay for tuition and <br/>
books while living at home.<br/>
I see helping them with college as my duty. But that&#39;s just me. He may have <br/>
to get creative, but if he really wants it, there is a way.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Teeth that are straightened in childhood tend to stay aligned.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not true.<br/>
I had braces for 2.5 years, my choice and my bite is off and some of my teeth <br/>
have shifted. If you wear the retainer for years and years (at least <br/>
occasionally) they should stay aligned.<br/>
But after a couple of years I broke mine and hence the shifting.<br/>
The braces actually cause the bone to be more prone to shifting and in some <br/>
people you need to keep a retainer and wear it at least once a month forever.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Just to throw a wrench into this whole TMJ idea, my sister has TMJ because<br/>
 she HAD braces.  Her dentist said the pressure on the jaw from her headgear<br/>
 caused the TMJ.  (I have heard that they don&#39;t use headgears now, like they<br/>
 use to, but how do we know that what they are using won&#39;t cause the TMJ.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well now that is something I can believe!! That headgear was painful.<br/>
And my braces caused headaches galore. Even after I had them off for years <br/>
(as my teeth shifted due to no retainer) I would get headaches from the <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
And my sister, who never had braces, has a perfect bite AND naturally <br/>
straight teeth, has TMJ pretty bad.<br/>
She is going to get treatment for it that involves a piece you wear at night, <br/>
no braces.<br/>
I think braces as TMJ prevention is really daft.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that&#39;s why this was (mostly) a hypothetical. I used TMJ, <br/>
because there are obvious, peer related pressures that could push a <br/>
child into wanting braces, like badly aligned teeth that bring <br/>
teasing or something. The hypothetical &quot;Future TMJ if these perfectly <br/>
straight teeth are not put in braces&quot; was to present a scenario where <br/>
no other pressure was on the child, but the ortho and the parents <br/>
saying &quot;It&#39;s for your best interests&quot; . <br/>
<br/>
I wonder about something like that ugly brace that kids with <br/>
curvature of the spine used to wear. Without it, it&#39;s a less healthy <br/>
future. With it, it&#39;s a temporary, emotionally (physically?) painful <br/>
experience. But the technology for scoliosis is so much better now, <br/>
with an invisible brace, the negative input from other kids is no <br/>
longer an issue for that treatment. <br/>
<br/>
Back to teeth...cavities. In an upbringing where the child gets to <br/>
choose, do they choose whether they brush their teeth or not? If they <br/>
choose not to, do they then choose whether to have their cavities <br/>
filled or not? What if they choose not to have the dental treatment? <br/>
Maybe they&#39;ll decide to have it done later...when it&#39;s a matter of <br/>
yanking teeth or root canal or other expensive treatments.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just trying to get a picture of how far and how deep the child&#39;s <br/>
personal choices go, when they might not truly understand the long <br/>
term consequences of choosing foolishly.<br/>
<br/>

forced my kids to brush their teeth. I have used all sorts of fun things to <br/>
make it fun to do..like brushing with them or their favorite chasing Charlie<br/>
the Sugar Bug all over their mouth (he has parties with lots of friends and <br/>
everything...it is amazing how quick he is!). Sometimes my kids want to brush.<br/>
Sometimes they want to skip a day. Sometimes I don&#39;t feel like it or we are<br/>
out. So far so good. <br/>
<br/>
One of the things that I have been amazed at is the more and more I let my kids<br/>
make the decisions, the more and more they surprise me. For example, we saw a<br/>
Capn Crunch box that had a Galidor card on it...instead of immediately saying <br/>
no (we have not gotten in to the sugary cereals yet), we looked closer. Saw that<br/>
there was only one card. He thought about it a bit and decided that it was not<br/>
worth it. :o)<br/>

surgically broken to correct a bite problem that braces themselves couldn&#39;t <br/>
correct.  Although my teeth haven&#39;t shifted, the teeth have never settled <br/>
back into the bone so my teeth are actually loose!<br/>

would have to wear my retainers at night forever.  I did for a while, but <br/>
quit.  My teeth shifted a little but not much and have been fine ever since.  <br/>
Couldn&#39;t stand the prospect of those retainers forever.  LOL&gt;<br/>

I think this is a very good point. It seems that unschooling can be easily misundestood as *un-parenting* or something like that. You are still the parent (kids need parents), but your approach to parenting is non coercive, non controlling. Kids can most certainly know the difference between *care* and  *control*. It is your approach that makes it clear to them whether you&#39;re trying to control or that you care for them (health, safety, hygiene, etc.). They love to b loved, but tey will resist control at all cost, and I think that is a natural and healthy response.<br/>
<br/>
You need to talk to them, explain whys and hows, and keep the communication lines open at all times, as opposed to forcing them into what you think *should* be done. And accept that sometimes getting *no* from them is also ok. Negotiation and compromise are good skills for everyone involved...  ;-)<br/>
