<br/>
&quot;I tell you one thing, if you learn it by yourself, if you have to <br/>
get down and dig for it, it never leaves you. It stays there as long <br/>
as you live because you had to dig it out of the mud before you <br/>
learned what it was.&quot; ~ Aunt Adie ~<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
H IS FOR HOMESCHOOLING<br/>
http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/193.html<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A is for the Adults who can share their talents with children and <br/>
help them discover the joy of learning. They are parents, neighbors, <br/>
friends, grandparents, teachers, aunts, uncles, and anyone else <br/>
willing to share their gifts with children.<br/>
<br/>
B is for the thousands of Books that we can read and learn from. Quot <br/>
libros, quam breve tempus! (So many books, so little time!)<br/>
<br/>
C is for College. Yes, homeschoolers can go to college without a <br/>
diploma from a public or private school. If it is your goal to attend <br/>
college, it is possible. Many colleges actively seek homeschool <br/>
applicants.<br/>
<br/>
D is for the Dictionary that is always available to help us learn how <br/>
to spell a word or understand the meaning of a new word that we find <br/>
in one of the thousands of books that we read as homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
E is for Experiences. Education as a homeschooler is full of real <br/>
learning experiences like swimming with manatees, banding wood ducks, <br/>
turning your garage into a puppet theater, starting your own <br/>
business, writing things that are important to you in your journal, <br/>
creating a chemistry lab in your kitchen, using a dictionary to spell <br/>
words with, and reading books for fun.<br/>
<br/>
F is for Family. Homeschool families have a closer relationship with <br/>
each other. They enjoy spending time together. They do many things <br/>
together. They read together. They play games together. They go <br/>
hiking together. They do puzzles together. They play music together. <br/>
They cook dinner together.<br/>
<br/>
G is for the Grades that homeschoolers do not have to worry about. <br/>
You do not have to learn to spell to get a passing grade. You learn <br/>
to spell because you ask your parent how do you spell &quot;chocolate.&quot; <br/>
You can make a mistake on a math problem, learn from it and not worry <br/>
about failing the test. You do not have to memorize and regurgitate <br/>
facts for a history test grade, but you can study and learn about any <br/>
topic in history that interests you.<br/>
<br/>
H is for Homeschoolers, from those who have been teaching their <br/>
children from before there were school institutions to modern day <br/>
homeschoolers who have eased the way for new parents to regain the <br/>
freedom of choice for the education of their children...&quot; ~ Scott <br/>
Stevens ~<br/>
<br/>

articles and columns from the May/June issue at the address above, <br/>

<br/>

http://www.home-ed-magazine.com<br/>
<br/>

homeschooling on a shoestring. Welcome, Elizabeth!<br/>
<br/>

Leaping into Brambles, help calls, focusing on your child&#39;s strengths <br/>
and more.  From the columnists: the Kaseman&#39;s highlight problems with <br/>
public e-schools; Becky Rupp is full of beans; David Albert tests <br/>
1...2...3...; Sandra Dodd stays up late to learn; and Carol Narigon <br/>

Theisen, Ann Zeise, Peter Kowalke, Linda Dobson, and Laura Weldon.<br/>

<br/>
CONGRATULATIONS, CALVIN!<br/>
http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geographybee/2002.html<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations to 10-year-old homeschooler Calvin McCarter, winner <br/>
of the National Geographic Bee. Calvin hails from Grand Rapids, <br/>
Michigan and was the youngest competitor in the contest. He won a <br/>
$25,000 scholarship and a lifetime membership to the National <br/>
Geographic Society. Look for the televised finals on your local PBS <br/>
station.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
ADVICE NEEDED<br/>
<br/>
Questions for the September/October issue of Home Education <br/>
Magazine&#39;s Questions and Answers column:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We had to take our son out of school two years ago due to a chronic <br/>
digestive disease.  The school system provides an in-home tutor. <br/>
Despite our efforts his former school pals have gone on with their <br/>
own busy lives and left him behind. He&#39;s 11 years old now. I&#39;m <br/>
concerned he may become depressed as adolescence approaches. Are <br/>
there safe &#39;chat rooms&#39; for homeschooled kids? How could we invite <br/>
homeschooled kids his age over to swim in our pool over the summer if <br/>
the school system won&#39;t release the names of other homeschoolers?&quot; ~ <br/>
Colton Sellers ~<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We approach most subjects actively, but my kids prefer watching <br/>
movies for history and social studies. When we watched &#39;The Patriot,&#39; <br/>
they talked about the Revolutionary War and imagined themselves there <br/>
far more effectively than after any book we&#39;ve read.  (Caution: It <br/>
was violent, as could be expected in a war movie.) Anyone have other <br/>
suggestions for movies?&quot; ~ Karen ~<br/>

<br/>
BAD SCIENCE?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so grateful for those smart people who find the mistakes in <br/>
science textbooks and even commonly held knowledge and let the rest <br/>
of us know how the real science works. I really thought friction was <br/>
caused by the roughness; turns out I was wrong! And how about zero <br/>
gravity in space? Do you believe that one? I did too!  Ben Franklin&#39;s <br/>
kite was struck by lightning, right? Nope. Not true.<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to know your science, take a look at this <br/>
debunking site. Your kids will be so impressed with your new <br/>
knowledge, but you may have to take them there to prove you&#39;re right! <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
UNSCHOOLING.COM<br/>
http://www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&#39;What do you hope your kids will have gotten from unschooling by the <br/>
time they&#39;re ready to move on from home?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
My main goal is that their sense of self remain so strongly intact <br/>
the world can&#39;t rob their joy, their uniqueness and their natural <br/>
curiosity. Beyond that...<br/>
<br/>
...the status quo won&#39;t matter so much to them as what is good and right.<br/>
<br/>
...they will have a deep-seated knowledge in their hearts that they <br/>
are intelligent, capable human beings and can learn anything they <br/>
wish and a sense of wonder so awesome they will never quit seeing how <br/>
magical the world truly is.<br/>
<br/>
...their idealism be tempered with realism and spirituality will flow <br/>
naturally and freely from a loving heart and kindness rare.<br/>
<br/>
...they will be able to follow their dreams and goals, whatever those may be.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;And how do you plan to help that along?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
It humbles me to think about this. I came out of high school <br/>
emotionally battered, not knowing who I was or what I really wanted. <br/>
Fifteen years later, I&#39;m spouting ideals for my children I couldn&#39;t <br/>
have dreamed of then. I will help that along by becoming a better <br/>
person myself...<br/>
<br/>
...by reading, watching, searching and regaining that sense of wonder <br/>
(they&#39;ve helped me do this already).<br/>
<br/>
...by being willing to set everything aside, change plans midstream <br/>
and go off in a new direction when necessary.<br/>
<br/>
...by listening carefully and responding appropriately.<br/>
<br/>
...by dialoguing with them about these matters of the heart and <br/>
showing love to the earth and my fellow human beings.<br/>
<br/>
...by filling my home with books, movies, music, instruments, nature, <br/>
toys, art materials and whatever oddities my children bring home.<br/>
<br/>
...by taking them to the places they want to go and ones they never <br/>
knew existed, fixing them new and exciting foods from other countries <br/>
and making trips to the grocery store an adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Healing myself has definitely been the most important step in <br/>
assisting these worthy individuals in their unschooling journey. I <br/>
have learned much from them; thank the heavens they came here to <br/>
teach me.&quot; ~~ Ren, on the uschooling.com message boards ~~<br/>

HEM LISTS-NEW AND OLD<br/>
<br/>
HEM is offering two new email lists for those who are interested in <br/>
discussing unschooling or national news. Please feel welcome to join <br/>
in!<br/>
<br/>
HEM-Unschooling<br/>
This list is for discussion of unschooling hows and whys, wherefores <br/>
and methods, sharing good resources, and so on and so forth. <br/>
Sponsored by Home Education Magazine. <br/>
http://www.groups.yahoo.com/group/HEM-Unschooling<br/>
<br/>
HEM-NationalNews<br/>
This list is for the discussion of news not necessarily related to <br/>
homeschooling. Have you read something in your local newspaper or a <br/>
national magazine, or found something online recently which might not <br/>
have had much to do with homeschooling but which really made you <br/>
think? Share it with other homeschooling parents on this list.<br/>
http://www.groups.yahoo.com/group/HEM-NationalNews<br/>
<br/>
Several of HEM&#39;s other email lists have undergone a name change or <br/>
have been pulled and archived. If you are on those lists, you were <br/>
notified a couple of weeks ago and your subscription automatically <br/>
switched over. If you haven&#39;t joined and you&#39;d like to, here&#39;s how to <br/>
find these updated lists.<br/>
<br/>
The PPSP-H (Public and Private School Programs and Homeschooling) <br/>
list is now HEM-EdPrograms. <br/>
http://www.groups.yahoo.com/group/HEM-EdPrograms<br/>
<br/>
The HomeschoolingMovieLovers list is now HEM-MovieLovers.<br/>
http://www.groups.yahoo.com/group/HEM-MovieLovers<br/>
<br/>
The HomeschoolingResources list is now HEM-Resources.<br/>
http://www.groups.yahoo.com/group/HEM-Resources<br/>
<br/>
The History of Homeschooling list is now HEM-HomeschoolHistory.<br/>
http://www.groups.yahoo.com/group/HEM-HomeschoolHistory<br/>
<br/>
One list, the Homeschool History-Politics-Religion list, is being <br/>
archived and will eventually be deleted. Both this one and History of <br/>
Homeschooling have been dormant for several months now, but I&#39;d like <br/>
to take the whole conversation back to the HomeschoolHistory list at <br/>
some point.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
BEYOND THE MOVIE<br/>
http://www.nationalgeographic.com/ngbeyond <br/>
http://plasma.nationalgeographic.com/pearlharbor/ngbeyond<br/>
<br/>
National Geographic offers a cool section on their website called <br/>
Beyond the Movie. Right now you can explore Lord of the Rings and <br/>
Pearl Harbor. For example, on the Lord of the Rings page on the <br/>
author, the mythology that influenced the books, where particular <br/>
names came from and more.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure why only 2 movies are offered, but I hope they&#39;ll <br/>
continue to investigate other popular movies in the future.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
BUILDING A WEBSITE<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s too hot to play outside and your kids want to stay cool <br/>
inside creating a web page, and you don&#39;t know the first thing about <br/>
it? You can find lots of help on the Internet for both you and your <br/>
kids. For learning HTML, check out Learning HTML for Kids at <br/>
http://www.goodellgroup.com/tutorial . You know how kids&#39; books are <br/>
often the best way to learn about a particular topic? Same with <br/>
websites. This one is easy to understand and will give you a good <br/>
start on learning the language.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re ready to move on to a site that&#39;s a little more advanced, <br/>
check out the monkey at http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/kids . <br/>
There&#39;s even a planning guide on this site so adults can act like <br/>
they know what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, for a really cute, yet informational site, try Lissa <br/>
Explains It All at http://www.lissaexplains.com . I think this site <br/>
would especially appeal to girls, but the information is good for <br/>
everyone.<br/>
