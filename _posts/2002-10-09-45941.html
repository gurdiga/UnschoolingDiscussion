&#39;Namaste&#39; is an East Indian greeting which means &#39;the light within me bows<br/>
to the light within you.&#39; In other words, beyond our achy bones, our tired<br/>
feet and our multi-colored real life soap operas, lurks a dimension that is<br/>
more than the body, the persona, the ego and all the &#39;trappings and the<br/>
suits of woe&#39; as Hamlet would say---a dimension where there isn&#39;t a &#39;you&#39;<br/>
and &#39;me&#39; but rather a synergy that is more than all that, a space for the<br/>
eternal to rest within the temporal.<br/>

&gt; Does anyone have a website for mathematical construction of bridges? I<br/>
looked for my older child but couldn&#39;t find anything...well, I found, but it<br/>
wasn&#39;t advanced enough for her.  She says she needs it to a power of three.<br/>
HELP!!! I am not mechanically inclined.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
