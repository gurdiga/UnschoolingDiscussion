<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024649491">Yes!  We are hearing this!  My daughter did a few courses at college and<br/>
hated jumping through the hoops.  She has decided to start her own business.<br/>
This is a girl who when interested in a subject will bring home 15 books<br/>
from the library, read endlessly, take notes, etc.  Right now she is taking<br/>
a lot of flack from her friends (all at college).  Finally she got them off<br/>
her back by telling them she wouldn&#39;t have to wait 4 years to start living<br/>
her dream AND she wouldn&#39;t owe thousands of dollars either!      Deb K.<br/>

...Also, I am wondering if you all are hearing as much as we are about<br/>
&quot;success&quot;. My teens keep hearing that unless they get a degree they will<br/>
not &quot;succeed&quot; and will amount to nothing since they won&#39;t get a high<br/>
paying job...     sharon</div>
