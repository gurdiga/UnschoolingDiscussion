<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407075485">greetings all,<br/>
My name is Mary <br/>
I still havent figured out if I am unschooling, home and unschooling, if there is a combo, or what...<br/>
I let my kids do whatever they want, to learn, but then I findmyself getting caught up in the &#39;having to have a portfolio&#39; and all that jazz, and I find myself in fear about their learning so I say, you have to do this or that before playing Madden or whatever, but...Im ...trying to relax...<br/>
did that make sense?<br/>
I have 6 children, between 4 and 27, (3 boys)4,11 and 17 and 3 girls 10,15 27)the oldest daughter iives in LA, and has a son(my grandson  :)  )the rest are at home with me in S Florida.<br/>
I have &#39;homeschooled&#39; my older children at various times in their learning years, but no more than a year at a time...  admittedly it was like, if they were having a problem with the teacher, or something, I took them out, several times Id do that at winter break and then put them back in the next year, they always fit right back in both academically and socially,<br/>
I brought my 11 yr old son home once for 2nd grade and now  this year we began over summer knowing he would not be returning to school., he seemed to learn differently (imagine that!)than the children in his classes, last year was very hard for me, I liked his teacher as a person but she really...stunted his growth and (imo) caused damage, anyways...<br/>
so now his sister,10 also at 5th grade, is coming home,(as of this week) meaning the 4 10 and 11 yr old all home,<br/>
I love my kids, love spending time,they can be wild tho-<br/>
wild treeclimbing chandelier hangin ruffians,(great motor skills!)<br/>
I am finding I am fearful, but also excited, I know Im doing the right tthing but Im scared, does that make sense?<br/>
Reading the supportive posts discussing ways to accept stress and embrace it rather than control it have been very helpful to me, <br/>
I also am an assistant to a few lovely homebirth midwives in my area, <br/>
my new website<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://birthassistance.tripod.com">http://birthassistance.tripod.com</a><br/>
and am persuing my LLL leadership as I heard another member mention  :)  Can you believe there is no LLL in my area? Have to travel 30 miles?<br/>
I BF all 6 and am a BFing counselor with the WIC program, still BFing the 4 yr old-I am also a childbirth educator and doula~ I am very much into the wemoon perspective.<br/>
I apologize if my fruit post seemed...odd but that struck a cord with me, <br/>
My 15 year old daugthter is bisexual and watching her explore her sexuality has been...interesting to say the least, enlightening to me regarding many of my own views and feelings, <br/>
My kids were raised on watching videos of birth and childbirth meetings, mommy meetings and so forth, sexuality to them is real and healthy and...real healthy? ...one can hope  :)<br/>
sometimes we know things on an intellectual basis but have feelings that counter our knowledge I think, -I have found it helpful to be aware of conflicts between information and feelings...<br/>
I find fear to ne a red flag where these conflicts exist.<br/>
I have also been a 12 stepper for many years and found that integrating the principles of those steps helpful in HSing -loved reading those points.<br/>
   I hopped in way earlier than the suggested 2 weeks, I just cant seem to shut my mouth sometimes, (can you tell yet  :)  )<br/>
harvest blessings, mary aka marymom<br/>

<br/>
Relax. You don&#39;t need to have it all defined and put into neat little <br/>
boxes. That&#39;s for the schools. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I let my kids do whatever they want, to learn, but then I <br/>

<br/>
Yup. Lots of us go through that panic phase. Here&#39;s a link to a <br/>
presentation I gave at the Live and Learn Conference this past <br/>
August. It talks about how I learned to become more at peace with <br/>
where my heart was taking me on unschooling. <br/>

You could also take a look at my article &quot;A Day With Peter Pan&quot; for <br/>
some encouragement on how to turn those free days into the stuff of <br/>
portfolios.<br/>

<br/>
Breathe. Relax. Look at your beautiful chandelier-hanging children <br/>
and smile. :o) All is well. Really. There is no one thing that every <br/>
child needs to know at one specific time. The learning happens. It&#39;s <br/>
all around your children. It&#39;s called life and now that they&#39;re home <br/>
they get to live it fully.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
