<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236802785">Darin is thinking about making some drastic changes in our lifestyle. Ever <br/>
since he got sick last winter we have struggled (even more than usual) with <br/>
money. We have at times been reduced to that old proverbial of robbing Peter to <br/>
pay Paul, and as most of you know; once you go down that road it is hard to get <br/>
off it. <br/>
<br/>
Not so short story long, he is doing well at work, but the pay sucks, he <br/>
isn&#39;t appreciated, he is depressed, he wants out. Example of being unappreciated <br/>
leading to depression; his district manager called him last week and said; <br/>
&quot;Thanks for ruining my year.&quot; He said this to Darin because last year at Darin&#39;s <br/>
old store, Darin had a huge sale to the state totaling over fifty-thousand on <br/>
one day. This year, the guy who took over the old store after Darin moved to a <br/>
bigger one, couldn&#39;t make the numbers he was up against for that same day. <br/>
Darin&#39;s boss wanted him to call the guy at the state and ask if he was ready to <br/>
make another purchase AND he wanted Darin to give the sale to the new manager <br/>
of his old store! UGH! To top it off, Darin got calls from his boss&#39; boss and <br/>
on up the chain all the way to one of the vice presidents of the company, all <br/>
wanting Darin to do the same thing. His boss managed to keep ragging Darin so <br/>
bad that one night I saw my DH cry. I have a friend who works at the company <br/>
headquarters and she passed some gossip on that Darin&#39;s boss was being so nasty <br/>
because HIS job is on the line. Three days ago, he was fired. I was secretly <br/>
happy about that. <br/>
<br/>
The problem hasn&#39;t gone away though and Darin is really depressed. He wants <br/>
to quit and do something else. I was kind of shocked to hear what he wants to <br/>
do, but want to be supportive. He wants to become a trucker. That means he will <br/>
be away from home for long periods of time. I am used to that lifestyle, I <br/>
grew up with my Dad away for weeks and sometimes months at a time. My kids are <br/>
not. They see their Dad everyday, no matter how early he goes into work and no <br/>
matter how late he gets home, they get to stay up to see him. I wasn&#39;t close <br/>
to my Dad, I could have cared less if he was home or not, and when he was I <br/>
always wished he wasn&#39;t. I&#39;ve looked into what truckers get paid and honestly <br/>
even the worst paying jobs pay almost twice as much as what he makes currently. <br/>
That means that if he were to do this and get a really good paying job, he <br/>
could theoretically make three or four times what he makes now. We could never <br/>
afford to buy our own rig, at least not right now. I had thought that maybe one <br/>
day IF we could afford our own, we could both be drivers and take the kids and <br/>
dog with us. But as things stand now, the kids and I would be at home and <br/>
Darin would be away. I don&#39;t know how this will effect the kids, as they are very <br/>
attached to Darin. Does anyone else have a spouse who is away lots of the <br/>
time, and how do the kids deal with this? If we could afford it, we would have our <br/>
own truck. I would see no problem taking the kids all over. I do have a <br/>
problem (in my own head) with them being separated from their Dad so much. I <br/>
realize there are families separated by divorce and other factors all the time, but <br/>
this would be slightly different. I&#39;m concerned, the money looks good and we <br/>
certainly need it, but at what cost? I really hope someone has some insight for <br/>
me.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to be devil&#39;s advocate here and suggest that you rethink this<br/>
concept. Being on a truck, a commercial vehicle, with incredibly tight<br/>
deadlines both when the truck is full, and when it is empty, going where<br/>
someone else tells you without the freedom to deviate or stop and hang<br/>
out, is hardly the same kind of pleasurable traveling experience that<br/>
Unschooling RV&#39;er families experience. To be honest, what would you do<br/>
if, God forbid, one of the kids got sick one the road in the middle of<br/>
nowhere - but the contract deadline would still have to be met? Chances<br/>
are you&#39;d be stuck at the nearest hospital ER and then still have to<br/>
make your own way home.  I know those trucks have great sleeper<br/>
compartments behind the driver these days, but how many toys will they<br/>
hold? What would the insurance be like? Do you remember the old comic<br/>
song - &quot;I joined the navy to see the world, and what did I see? I saw<br/>
the sea.&quot; Your kids would have lots of experience with highways, truck<br/>
stops and loading bays - all over. Sorry to sound so negative - I just<br/>
don&#39;t see how being in the back of the truck and being just one more<br/>
thing for your husband to have to worry about while driving at all hours<br/>
and in all weathers is likely to be a positive parent/child bonding<br/>
experience. Maybe I&#39;m wrong and there are tons of families commercially<br/>
trucking out there who meet regularly at the truck stops and it&#39;s all<br/>
fun.<br/>

What about local trucking.  I have a friend who loves trucking but had the <br/>
same concerns about not seeing his family so he drives for a company that <br/>
bottles and ships water.  They have local and cross country truckers.  The local <br/>
ones only go across this state and maybe just across the boarder into other <br/>
states.  They are day trips.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-833211801">Hi,<br/>
My sister married a trucker - he was gone for weeks at atime - he was also able to pick which runs and what kinds of runs he wanted. He usually stayed this side of the Mississippi (we&#39;re in New England)<br/>
Their marriage improved.<br/>
They had more fun when he was home.<br/>
The money was decent and he steadily made more.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some thoughts;<br/>
start a journal that you & the kids can give him on his return.<br/>
Have a special time when he calls - daily - to talk to each kid....and you.<br/>
Have him bring a camera - not a disposable one - let him takes pictures of truck stops, rest stops, odd & interesting things that he sees.<br/>
Keep a large map on the wall and follow his route.<br/>
Keep track of the mileage, the nights...<br/>
in short - keep home &quot;there&quot; with y&#39;all<br/>
and stay with him...the best way you can.<br/>
<br/>
Really - this is not so hard to do...it&#39;s just very different....but doable!<br/>

For four years, Keith worked in Minneapolis three weeks a month.  Once a <br/>
quarter the company paid for the family to visit him.  Once a month he could come <br/>
home, so he would work ten hour days so he could come home for eleven or <br/>
twelve  days instead of just a weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Because the money was good, we got a bigger house.<br/>
<br/>
Because he was gone from the kids, their relationships weren&#39;t as good as <br/>
they could have been for a while, but there was some special sweetness between <br/>
him and Holly.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the visits were with just subsets of family, and that was different <br/>
and fun.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage of Keith&#39;s situation over trucking was that Keith had e-mail at <br/>
work and phone at home (tiny apartment).  Truckers might have the same <br/>
advantages now, with headphone cellphones and laptops, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438627025">I kept on thinking about this and I realized that *my* reluctance to do<br/>
this kind of travel stems largely because I know that Jayn would be<br/>
distressed to be away from home - she needs to be home, and even on our<br/>
short road trips wants to get home way before James and I are ready to<br/>
return. When James was in Venice for 10 days recently, she missed him,<br/>
and spoke on the phone to him twice a day. However, having just returned<br/>
from SC, I don&#39;t think she would have been happy leaving again so soon. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know your kids&#39; ages either, which may make a big difference.<br/>
What do they have to say on the matter?<br/>

Perhaps when you could afford it, you could get a small RV or camper van<br/>

else had the idea of the kids taking turns to go on the trips. <br/>

My husband often comes up with startling money making ideas. Some of<br/>
these seem great, others more along the lines of &quot;schemes&quot;. I don&#39;t see<br/>
him following up on many of them. So far the only thing that has<br/>
actually been a money earner is what he actually does when employed - a<br/>
Production sound mixer. Now he hopes to produce, and is working with his<br/>
friend (a real producer with a resume) to develop several ideas. <br/>
<br/>
I mention this because I noticed that my husband seemed unfocussed in<br/>
his job searching. I am the one who mails/faxes the resumes out. A<br/>
couple of months ago, when his knee replacement finally looked like he<br/>
was going to fully recover (another story) I initiated a talk with him<br/>
to discover his longer term goals and particular passions for work.<br/>
Prior to that we were wondering if he would be getting retraining in<br/>
another area, and so talking about other careers. I discovered and he<br/>
realized that his passion is for a particular type of film, and we also<br/>
talked about where he is most likely to find them. It was important for<br/>
us as a couple for me to understand what his motivations are, and what<br/>
he hopes to gain from his work.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever James is gone I miss him terribly, but I just spend even more<br/>
time playing with Jayn.<br/>

What about local trucking.  I have a friend who loves trucking but had the <br/>
same concerns about not seeing his family so he drives for a company that <br/>
bottles and ships water. <br/>
GOOD idea.<br/>
<br/>
What about UPS or post office?<br/>
I had a friend who used to deliver movies and newspapers from Albuquerque to <br/>
towns in southern Colorado.  He drove lateat night after the theatre would <br/>
finish with reels and take   them to the next theatre scheduled to show them.  <br/>
Probably these days such things go by FedEx, but maybe not. <br/>

Another friend drove a beer truck for a while.  <br/>

The advantage of Keith&#39;s situation over trucking was that Keith had e-mail at <br/>

Apparently there are three different companies that Darin is looking at. (I <br/>
did not realize he had already gone this far and he hasn&#39;t even gone to school <br/>
yet.) Two of the three have email and phones in all of their trucks. Two of <br/>
the three allow a pet in the truck, one you have to pay a small deposit. All <br/>
three allow spouses to ride along, two allow kids to ride if he pays the extra <br/>
insurance, one of those two stipulate the kids have to be at least 12. Not bad <br/>
options IMO. We wouldn&#39;t do that all the time, but I think once or twice a year <br/>
if he was going somewhere interesting with a layover, it might be fun. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who has replied on this subject. I really liked the ideas <br/>
of keeping a log and map at home to keep track of Dad. I&#39;m still on the fence, <br/>
but the idea is growing on me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; My husband often comes up with startling money making ideas. Some of<br/>
these seem great, others more along the lines of &quot;schemes&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In England, I was surprised to find that the word &quot;scheme&quot; doesn&#39;t have a <br/>
negative connotation.   It&#39;s used the way we use &quot;plan&quot; or &quot;project&quot; here, and <br/>
taxes are spent on lots of schemes.  There will be signs by the road or <br/>
announcements on flyers that the bridge repair scheme is on schedule, or the gasline <br/>
replacement scheme will begin next week.<br/>
<br/>
It made it all seem more exciting than our &quot;road repair projects&quot; and &quot;bridge <br/>
expansion plans.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like a doable plan. <br/>
I think the best you can do right now is support him. He will find his way to <br/>
a happy place.<br/>
A couple things I was thinking about while reading the posts was that trucks <br/>
cost a lot a money.  I am sure you know this but it is a financing situation <br/>
and if you credit is risky its a lot to try to finance.<br/>
<br/>
As for bills until things are better the best thing to do is to stay on top <br/>
of your mortgage. If the others need to slide let them but keep the mortgage as <br/>
that is the one that matters the most. Credit cards will call and offer a <br/>
plan to work things out. If you not in major then paying/setting money aside <br/>
weekly may be easier for the big bills. (Where I live the collectors dont go after <br/>
anything under 5000 all they do is call)<br/>
<br/>
Someone suggested UPS they do pay fairly well 14.+ an hour to start.  Places <br/>
like USPS and UPS, etc., offer vet preference so if he is prior military that <br/>
helps also.<br/>
<br/>
Does sound kinda cool for a family trip here and there or father son etc...<br/>
<br/>
Love to hear what choice your family <br/>
makes.<br/>
<br/>
Laura<br/>
Have fun and love what you do or its worth a look at change-n <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-763773351">My dad drove UPS for years and it took him about 15 to have enough<br/>
seniority to drive the big rigs.  ItÂs all union, so you have to do your<br/>
time for the coveted, higher-paying jobs Â and the big rigs is where<br/>
most guys want to go.  No heavy lifting, better pay, no stopping and<br/>
dealing with the public every half block.  Apparently, at least here in<br/>
the SF Bay Area, you usually have to do your time as a night shift, part<br/>
time loader before you can even drive the delivery trucks.  Then another<br/>
10-15 years and you can dive the big rigs.<br/>

He drove a beer truck around town in his 20Âs and thatÂs how he got into<br/>
