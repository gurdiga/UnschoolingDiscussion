&lt;&lt; I think what we have, that was undreamed of in Victorian London, is the <br/>
internet, computers, distance-learning, and educational software.  If people <br/>
wanted to learn things that they couldn&#39;t learn my trial and error or from <br/>
friends and mentors, we have computer-tutoring or self-paced computer learning stuff <br/>
as an alternative.  (If it can be made available cheaply.) &gt;&gt;<br/>

We have better rights for children, too, though the U.S. lags in that area, <br/>
among nations.   <br/>

Shyrley Williams said Britain is finally outlawing spanking.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
the details or dates.   I think the U.S. never will.   And speaking of Victorian <br/>
London (or rather about a century and some before that), one thing that <br/>
improved the gene pool in London was that the worst were transported to Georgia, <br/>
where they became racist Southern Baptists and are perpetuating some of the <br/>
embarrassments of Dickensian life to this day.  <br/>
<br/>
American-Studies embarrassment.  Why is the South so... so...   <br/>
feudal/slummy/prejudiced/ignorant?    It relates partly to where the people came from, and <br/>
why.  (And before anyone has a stroke, my own ancestors are heavily English, <br/>
NOT high class, and primarily southern.)<br/>
<br/>
Having stirred an ant bed, this is my last prep day before leaving for a <br/>
week. &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m really pretty ready, but that won&#39;t keep me from panicking later, I <br/>
bet.  <br/>

My Dad&#39;s family are from the South, of mostly English stock.  Tho the majority of his generation and mine are college-educated, there&#39;s still a very high hick-factor, socially anyway.  Even with a college degree, you can still tell they come from dust-bowl Oklahoma roots. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve always attributed it to the fact that they&#39;re Baptists, the standard God-fearing, in the box, ignorant-of-other-kinds-of-people thing. Also, they really don&#39;t get much exposure to the world outside their own bubble of college, white-collar work, and Christian tradition. I know they just don&#39;t get me at all, but I only flit thru occasionally, so they don&#39;t have any real reason to get to know me. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>the details or dates.   I think the U.S. never will.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The Sep/Oct HEM has a letter to the editor in response to Ann Larson Fisher&#39;s column about &quot;The Rod&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The letter writer suggested that the HEM issue contradicted itself by publishing Fisher&#39;s article along with the Kaseman&#39;s article against regulation of families.<br/>
<br/>
I think he may have meant &quot;magazine&quot; rather than &quot;article&quot;.  From the letter, &quot;But I&#39;m concerned that your article is starting to take a leftward drift.  There are many liberals out there who would like to have a law passed against spanking kids.  This is being done in England right now.  Why they can&#39;t see that as schools eliminated corporal punishment, the incidents of violence and bulling went up, is beyond me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He (the letter is signed Steve Charles, New River, AZ) does not cite his source for the connection between eliminating corporal punishment and increasing &quot;bulling&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The letter is followed by a reply from Fisher.<br/>
