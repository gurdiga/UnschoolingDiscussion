Do not be sorry to post your beliefs and views!� I for one do not agree with everything said on any of the lists I belong to!� You stated your beliefs in<br/>
a very pleasant, informative way.� I did not think it was offensive in anyway.� I do not agree with the whole method, etc., but it was informative and<br/>
interesting to learn about the different ways people do raise their children.<br/>
<br/>
I am on digest so I am behind--to the person who was looking for something about Pagans, there is Many-Paths at onelist, if you are interested.� Very<br/>
good, IMO.<br/>
