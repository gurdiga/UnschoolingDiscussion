<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651051243">And so the jackbooted government Nazis move into another area of everyone&#39;s<br/>
lives.  I think everyone everywhere needs to know about this.  If they do<br/>
it in one city, the rest of the NEA lemmings will follow!<br/>

INTRUSIVE POLICIES. Chicago public schools will begin this year evaluating<br/>
parents. Yes, you read that correctly. The district will rate parents on<br/>
how well they fulfil 23 &quot;responsibilities.&quot; Schools have the option of<br/>
targeting all parents, or only selected parents. Parents who don&#39;t meet the<br/>
expectations of the schools will receive home visits every 10 weeks from<br/>
one of more than 1000 school staff members or counselors. Some of the areas<br/>
that might put parents on the list:<br/>
* Parent fails to praise the child often enough<br/>
* Parent spends insufficient &quot;quality time&quot; with child <br/>
* Child eats meals or snacks that the school deems unhealthy. <br/>
* Child dressed in a manner the school considers inappropriate for the<br/>
weather<br/>
* Child is tardy or absent from school<br/>
* Child comes to school inadequately unprepared<br/>
* Child fails to return completed homework on time<br/>
