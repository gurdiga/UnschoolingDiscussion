<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257091088">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I just couldn&#39;t stay away.  :o)  I read yesterday&#39;s digest and had to<br/>
respond to one post.  (Am I an addict or what?)  Someone asked if when a<br/>
baby was born had anything to do with their sleeping schedules when they<br/>
got older.  I don&#39;t know that it holds true in all cases but here is my story.<br/>
<br/>
I was born in Toul France at about 11:00 in the morning if I recall<br/>
correctly.  My folks were fine until they brought me back to the US 6<br/>
months later.  Then it happened - I slept ALL day and kept them up ALL<br/>
night!  My Dad would even toss me in the air and I&#39;d sleep through it!  How<br/>
frustrating that must have been for them as he had a day job.  As I grew<br/>
older I stayed up later and later.  When I first got married my dh wanted<br/>
to go to bed at 10:00 (still does!) and I looked at him in amazement (still<br/>
do!) saying &quot;But I&#39;m just waking up?!?!&quot;  Through the 19 years we&#39;ve been<br/>
married I&#39;ve gone in spurts of staying up until 2, 3 or 4 a.m. and he still<br/>
hates it.  But I&#39;d say that it could well be that there is some<br/>
relationship here with birth times and sleep times.  Hmmm, wonder if anyone<br/>
is doing a study on this?<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day all!<br/>
<br/>
