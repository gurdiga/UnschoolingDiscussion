This statement stunned me, because I had never considered the press in this <br/>
country to be right-winged conservatives.  I had always considered it the <br/>
opposite-left-wing radicals.  The only conservative I&#39;ve seen on tv is Bill <br/>
O&#39;Reilly, who calls himself an independent but most of his views, in my opinion, are <br/>
conservative.  Just to help me stretch beyond my current thinking, could you <br/>
back that statement up with some examples?  And please don&#39;t say Dan Rather-I <br/>
consider him an acute liberalist.  I&#39;m not asking this for sake of arguement <br/>
but for another point of view to consider.  Thanks.<br/>

Maybe what we have is a Rorschoch press?<br/>

If it&#39;s out of line for a list owner to ask people to keep to the topic and <br/>
to follow the posting guidelines, the world is in bad shape.<br/>
<br/>
3. When differences of opinion arise, stick to discussing ideas, not the <br/>
person with whom you are disagreeing. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5. Before you hit &quot;send,&quot; consider whether your post will contribute <br/>
positively to the unschooling discussion. <br/>
