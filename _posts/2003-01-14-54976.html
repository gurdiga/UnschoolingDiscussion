&gt; My children get ready<br/>
&gt; for bed and are in bed between 8:00 and 9:00.  I have let my daughter and son<br/>
&gt; stay up later because they wanted to several times, but the next day is<br/>
&gt; usually a disaster.  They are 3 and 4 years old and don&#39;t seem to understand<br/>
&gt; or care that when they stay up late at night it makes them feel terrible the<br/>
&gt; next day.  I have decided to wait until they are little older for them to<br/>
&gt; decide when to go to bed.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughters (8 and 5) go to sleep whenever they want to and have almost<br/>
their whole lives (there was a brief period of actual bedtime, agreed upon<br/>
by all of us, when each of them went through a phase where being the last<br/>
one awake in a quiet house was frightening to them). These days, that&#39;s<br/>
later than either my husband or I are up (1 a.m. ish).<br/>
<br/>
Neither one of them is ever cranky or difficult in any way the next day.<br/>
Most days, they simply sleep themselves out and get up at 10 or 11 or Noon.<br/>
On the days when we have to go someplace earlier, I let them know the night<br/>
before. Sometimes, they then choose to lay down and try to sleep earlier,<br/>
sometimes not. In either case, though it can be a bit difficult to wake<br/>
them, I just keep at it gently (stroking their hair, talking nicely) and<br/>
they wake up and remember what we&#39;re doing and cheerfully get up and get<br/>
ready to go. Then they sleep in the car. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
