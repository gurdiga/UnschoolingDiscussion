 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t realize I was going to have to think so much (LOL).  I&#39;ve always <br/>
prided myself on being such a great communicator, but maybe I&#39;m not with my <br/>
kids.  We don&#39;t really have any structure when it comes to chores and I don&#39;t <br/>
know if that is a good thing or not.  Sometimes he empties it, sometimes he <br/>
sets the table, sometimes he puts his clothes away, sometimes he sorts the <br/>
laundry. I think it has depended on what mood I&#39;ve been in as to whether I <br/>
ask for his help or not.... Hmmmm going to have to think more about this now.<br/>
