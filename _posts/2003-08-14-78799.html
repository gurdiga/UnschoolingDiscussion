I liked that column a lot.  About expectations.  For me, I have many <br/>
expectations about childhood and what kids will be interested in that are rooted in my <br/>
own girl-ness and I don&#39;t have any of that kind of kid.  But it&#39;s all very <br/>
interesting and I never expected to find myself so interested in astronauts.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Sandra, weren&#39;t those the books you mentioned in your last HEM column as <br/>

<br/>
YES.<br/>
And then a grown friend who was moving out of state returned a little pile of <br/>
stuff that was ours, and I didn&#39;t know he had borrowed one of those books <br/>
from Keith.  Maybe his teenaged son had (who&#39;s far away in college in New York <br/>
for the past two years).  <br/>
<br/>
Marty picked it up out of that pile.<br/>
<br/>
Strewing.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving them on the shelf made them wallpaper.  I hadn&#39;t thought to leave one <br/>
on the shelf of the banister.    We spent over $100 on collecting as many of <br/>
those as we could, knowing they were going to go into library trash soon, as <br/>
they were too old.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;I liked that column a lot.  About expectations. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s funny!  I wanted to BE an astronaut when I was a kid.  My kids have no <br/>
interest whatsoever.  But in part, it&#39;s not new and flashy, and in other <br/>
part, I was in a small town and didn&#39;t even fly in a plane until I was 24.    My <br/>
kids flew when they were little, so it wasn&#39;t as exotic.  For me (and in the <br/>
50&#39;s and 60&#39;s) it was BIG and out there in the science-fiction fringe.   <br/>
<br/>
We do all share interests in history, so that&#39;s good.<br/>
