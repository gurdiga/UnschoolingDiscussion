<div id="ygrps-yiv-939462266">Me again.<br/>
<br/>
I have discovered that in the last 3 months I have absentmindedly acquired a near 15lb stockpile of brown sugar(along with 7lbs confectioners sugar and 10lbs of flour).  I kept picking up a bag here and there when the stores were having their sales.  I didn&#39;t realize how much I had since I have 2 wonderful grocery unloaders(dh and dd) who have managed to store this stockpile in three different places.  Anyone have a clue as to what I can do with this stuff so it won&#39;t go to waste?  My recipes will call for a max of 5 lbs.  Can Dana and I make anything fun/edible/whatever with this?  If not, we will be eating butterscotch cookies till we turn light brown, crispy and sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130007196">Karen......these staples will keep for a year, or<br/>
more, if stored in air tight containers.  I buy flour<br/>
in 50lb bags. Gets used up in a couple, three months. <br/>
Bread, pancakes, waffles, etc.  Brown sugar on the<br/>
oatmeal, to feed the yeasties (so the bread will<br/>
rise), in swear/sour sauces, as well as the<br/>
butterscotch cookies (and blondies as opposed to<br/>
brownies) and the lovely caramels mentioned by others.<br/>
<br/>
I also purchase legumes, rice, and other staples in<br/>
bulk. <br/>
<br/>
When my helpers put the groceries (perishables) away,<br/>
I&#39;m not always sure that they get put away...treats<br/>
get eaten immediately....DH especially does this.<br/>
Stashing his lunch box goodies is a real challenge!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not telling where Santa hid the stocking candy!!<br/>
<br/>
DH buys white sugar in 25lb bags.  Guess what he makes<br/>
in 3 gallon batches.<br/>
