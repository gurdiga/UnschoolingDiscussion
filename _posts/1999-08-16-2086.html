<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708195923">Hello fellow unschoolers. &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot; is a magazine that was<br/>
originally edited by John Holt. For those of you new to unschooling, he<br/>
published many books on learning and education. He was also a strong<br/>
advocate for children&#39;s rights as people. The main book that he wrote on<br/>
unschooling is &quot;Teach Your Own&quot;. Anyway, in the most recent issue (just got<br/>
it yesterday) was an article about a research done one 100 homeschool<br/>
families and reading. A significant number of them were late readers -<br/>
learning to read even at 11 years of age. The researcher found the children<br/>
caught up in no time at all and loved to read just as much as those that<br/>
started reading at an earlier age.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a wonderful story of recovery from ps.  My daughter (now 19) <br/>
went through a very similar struggle learning to read with one major <br/>
difference.  We didn&#39;t take her out of school.  Years later,  she <br/>
still felt &quot;stupid,&quot;  begin to do really poorly in school and we <br/>
finally took her out halfway through her sophomore year.  I feel like <br/>
she&#39;s just now (in college) beginning to see how capable she is.  <br/>
Fortunately, she did learn to love reading, finally.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665905040">I read this article also and was quite pleased to see some of the findings. <br/>
 My eleven year old learned to read around age seven, which fortunately for <br/>
him coincided with with the middle of his first grade year in ps.  My just <br/>
turned seven this past week second child began reading independently only a <br/>
few days ago.  Fine by me, but this is the summer after first in ps for <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
The school placed him in the lowest reading group and also in a reading <br/>
recovery program.  By the end of the year he tested &quot;average among his <br/>
peers&quot; in reading.  However, ask him and he was convinced he still could <br/>
not read, especially if the book was not the right &quot;level&quot;.  The rr <br/>
instructor would not let him choose his own books or move on to the next <br/>
book until he had mastered the previous level.  She also insisted that he <br/>
remain in the bottom reading group until the end of the year. Fortunately <br/>
his classroom teacher disagreed with that and moved him up one level. I <br/>
beleive this is the only thing that gave him any encouragement in that <br/>
setting and prevented his self esteem from being entirely destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
To wrap up my long post- I recently finished reading Charlie and the <br/>
Chocolate Factory to him. Upon reading the last page he requested that I <br/>
read it over again because he did not want it to end.  I told him we would <br/>
start it the next day but that he could take it to bed with him to look at <br/>
on his own.  He announced &quot;I can&#39;t read those words, the level is too <br/>
high&quot;.  I explained we do not have levels at home and he could read <br/>
anything he wanted to.  So, he gave it a try and I have seen very little of <br/>
him or the book since.  He asks about difficult words but no longer <br/>
experiences the amount of frustration he once did.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing him loving/reading that book and enjoying doing it after a summer <br/>
deschooling (doing absolutely nothing) has convinced me more than ever that <br/>
homeschooling, unschooling to be precise is the absolute way to go for us.<br/>
