<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210070908">Hi all,<br/>
I picked up a little &quot;game&quot; at the Wizards of the Coast going out of business sale. It is called Lucky Seven.  It is merely 7 coaster-like discs with the numbers 1 through 7 on one side. (You could very easily make your own.)  You place the disks in a row and then turn one over.  Let&#39;s say you turn over the disc in the 2 spot. On that disc is the number 4 so you then turn over the disk in the 4 spot.  Whatever number is on that disk is the next one to turn over.  If that disc has already been flipped, the game ends. The goal is to turn them all over. I goofed with it for a few minutes and never got past 6 turned over.  I left the game out and DH played with it in a reverse way like the engineer he is. Later the kids started fooling with it.  When they &quot;won&quot; they started writing down the number. Then we all were discussing when it could and could not work. ( I won&#39;t give this away in case you want to play it for yourself.) I had originally thought, &quot;there are only a few solutions...this is not so fun.&quot;  Well, we are over 30 and counting.  They have played with shiffing the numbers, looking for patterns, and keeping one or two the same and rearranging the rest.  What a great $2 toy. <br/>

There&#39;s a solitaire game called Clock, played with a regular deck of <br/>
cards, that works on the same principle.  Shuffle and layout the cards <br/>
into 13 piles of 4 cards each.  You &quot;should&quot; lay these out in a circular <br/>
pattern, like the face of a clock, but I don&#39;t always bother.  I lay <br/>
them out in a line knowing that the leftmost pile is for aces, then <br/>
twos, threes.... all the way to kings.  Turn over the first card from <br/>
the &quot;king&quot; pile, on the far right and based on what number or rank it <br/>
is, put it next to the equivalent pile.  Draw a card from that pile and <br/>
continue.  (If this is confusing, try an internet search for the rules.)<br/>
<br/>
For kids, this might be clearer if you made a board or mat or piece of <br/>
paper to deal the 13 numbered piles onto.<br/>
<br/>
Playing this game with a smaller number of numbers, as you described <br/>
Lucky Seven, might make it easier to see the patterns needed for a &quot;win&quot;.<br/>

I play this with the *clock shape* with 1-12 (11=j, 12=q) in a circle and <br/>
four individual cards in the center (kings)... when you uncover all four <br/>
kings, the game ends.<br/>
