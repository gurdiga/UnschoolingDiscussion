<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539127872">I was wrong.  I&#39;m glad.<br/>
<br/>
There was a time when HSLDA&#39;s sent-to-homes propaganda didn&#39;t credit anyone <br/>
outside Christian homeschooling starting in the 1980&#39;s.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Spcparents sent me a link on the side with a longer history of homeschooling <br/>
from the HSLDA site.<br/>

<br/>
There are still thing of questionable veracity (&quot;Modern home schooling was <br/>
launched by left-wing intellectuals and legalized by the religious right, but <br/>
home schooling is not just for the ends of the political spectrum anymore.&quot;) but <br/>
it&#39;s better than they used to publish.<br/>

The &quot;Soccer Mom&quot; lable was wierd to me.<br/>
