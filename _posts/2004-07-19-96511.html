If some people think that is sometimes a sign of iron deficiency, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
change the fact that some people just like to mess with ice when their drink <br/>
is gone.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Actually&quot; is  too  strong a word.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-173954282">Hi everyone,<br/>
My name is Kristina, I live in TX with my 4 kiddos who are 7 (in 2 wks), 5, 3, 17 months and one due around October/November. I have always known I&#39;d homeschool since my oldest was small and we&#39;ve spend the last 7 year just living (and adding to our family :)<br/>
 <br/>
Now, it seems I&#39;m having a bit of an anxiety attack, and realized I needed to find some like minded support. Unschooling and parenting in a non coercive way have been our lives, and we will be continuing in this way. But....with the sudden onslaught from family of &quot;well, she&#39;s 7, NOW WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO????&quot; has left me a little rattled and I&#39;m frustrated that I allowed them to rattle me!! <br/>
 <br/>
However, I feel that in reality what these recent disagreements and conversations have done is pushed me to clarify and strengthen my own beliefs about the way we &quot;educate&quot; our children. I am happy to have found this group and look forward to learning from all of you wise people!<br/>
 <br/>
My question is I&#39;d like to order some resources now, but wanting some opinions on which books people like best. My daughter has been asking for &quot;number challenges&quot; lately (she came up with this, basically like real life word problems). So, I wondered if she should have access to some of these cool math programs I&#39;ve seen. I showed her (on the interned) and talked to her about Miquon and MathUSee and she says she wants me to get one for her to &quot;play with&quot;. She actually asked for &quot;that number game&quot; for her birthday. So, I have no problem getting one...do you all have any experiences with either on of these? I&#39;d love to hear opinions on either.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, are the series of books &quot;Games for..(reading, writing, math)&quot; a good resource? How about Family Math? I was attracted to this one.<br/>
 <br/>
Lastly, I just need some validation as to some common things I might want to have around the house for a 7 yo to have access to. I know it&#39;s obviously going to depend on his/her interests, but my daughter doesn&#39;t have any burning interests right now, she just has a beautiful life playing all day with her brothers and sister. <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for a bit of hand holding here. I feel I&#39;m at a point where I&#39;m struggling a bit now, but truly feel I am going to come through this time much more confident and secure in our lifestyle choices. <br/>
 <br/>
Now, if they&#39;d just leave me the hell alone about our upcoming unassisted birth.......:) <br/>

<br/>
I think you should shift focus away from books, because it will draw you more <br/>
toward school-style formality and away from discovery.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My daughter has been asking for &quot;number challenges&quot; lately (she came up <br/>
with this, basically like real life word problems).-=-<br/>
<br/>
Real life &quot;word problems&quot; are in the real world.  Do real things with her <br/>
that involve math.  Plan days and outings, with time and expense.  Rent videos.  <br/>
How long do you have them?  How long will it take to watch them?  Do you have <br/>
time to re-watch or see the DVD extras?<br/>
<br/>
But PLEASE please, please don&#39;t do it like a teacher.  Be casual.  Just talk, <br/>
don&#39;t quiz or dissect.   The same kind of damage schools can do, you can do <br/>
at home.  Don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, I wondered if she should have access to some of these cool math <br/>
programs I&#39;ve seen. I showed her (on the interned) and talked to her about Miquon <br/>
and MathUSee and she says she wants me to get one for her to &quot;play with&quot;. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Then find something used, and play.  Just play.  Don&#39;t put it on a more <br/>
special shelf than puzzles and games.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, are the series of books &quot;Games for..(reading, writing, math)&quot; a good <br/>
resource?-=-<br/>
<br/>
About reading and writing, I say NO, no no.  <br/>
<br/>
There are some games you can pick up without buying a course or a workbook.  <br/>
There are games you can just invent, playing with words and sounds and such.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was talking to me about a Friends episode when Joey wrote a letter of <br/>
recommendation, and he used a thesaurus to replace all his plain words with <br/>
fancy words, replacing every single word even his name (Baby Kangaroo, for Joey). <br/>
  Maybe play with a thesaurus and Word! &lt;g&gt;  Maybe watch Friends for ideas.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Lastly, I just need some validation as to some common things I might want <br/>
to have around the house for a 7 yo to have access to. I know it&#39;s obviously <br/>
going to depend on his/her interests, but my daughter doesn&#39;t have any burning <br/>
interests right now, she just has a beautiful life playing all day with her <br/>
brothers and sister. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Then think of things to have around the house for all of them to have access <br/>
to.  You don&#39;t need separate plans or stuff, probably.<br/>
<br/>
There are more concrete ideas here:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/museum">http://sandradodd.com/museum</a><br/>
and there&#39;s one I don&#39;t know the address off, and my browser is not working, <br/>
but I think it&#39;s in the library at unschooling.com.  It&#39;s about a fantasy <br/>
shower-party for new unschoolers.  It&#39;s called &quot;Coming Out&quot; or something like <br/>
that.  It&#39;s linked down in  <br/>

At our house, our biggest learning comes from real live crafts, stuff an<br/>

have for kids.<br/>

We have lots and lots of different kinds of animals.  We cook from scratch<br/>
and mess with the recipes.  We have an easel set up in the dining room for<br/>
painting and chalk.  We go for walks and to the park.  We have books to help<br/>
identify animals, plants and bugs.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;math challenges&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you do real life stuff, the word problems are already built in for you.<br/>
Double a batch of cookies and figure out how many eggs you need now.  Cut<br/>
pizza.  Breed animals and figure out when they are due.  Build a play house<br/>
and figure out all the math involved.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t see as you really need a curriculum.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-44702444">First - you do sound like you&#39;re thinking in very schoolish terms, so <br/>
you might spend some more time reading unschooling informaion before <br/>
spending money on ANYTHING that you think is &#39;educational.&#39; Your <br/>
opinion of what is and isn&#39;t educational is likely to change <br/>
considerably over the next few months, if you are educating yourself <br/>
about unschooling during that time.<br/>
<br/>
However - that said - the series of books by Peggy Kaye, &quot;Games for <br/>
Reading,&quot; &quot;Games for Math,&quot; etc., is a good resource for those who <br/>
don&#39;t have the imagination themselves to invent quick little games for <br/>
playing with words and numbers. Use them to help yourself learn to be <br/>
able to come up with fun little games on your own, on the spot, when <br/>
something arises or when you have some waiting time to fill.<br/>
<br/>
Buy them used or get them at the library, by the way, they&#39;ve been <br/>
around a long time and are available all over.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say do not buy miquon or math-u-see. They are both formal math <br/>
programs. Kids I know who have had to use math-u-see have ended up just <br/>
like most schooled kids with ability to do computations if the problem <br/>
is presented in the form that they learned it in their &quot;math class&quot; - <br/>
but little ability to know when to use a computational skill and little <br/>
understanding of the underlying concepts and therefore relatively quick <br/>
loss of skill to use it at all. This program has an approach that <br/>
really emphasis &quot;how to do&quot; rather than &quot;when or why to do&quot; math and <br/>
doesn&#39;t at all promote understanding. Miquon is a bit different because <br/>
it uses cuisineairre rods and so has that hands-on attribute going for <br/>
it - BUT there is nothing in the Miquon workbooks - NOTHING - that <br/>
would not come up in regular life in a more natural way. My youngest <br/>
daughter liked workbooks and I thought the Miquon ones would be good <br/>
for her but I discovered one BIG flaw in them - a kid can&#39;t do them <br/>
alone, there are no directions to the kid - the directions are in the <br/>
separate teacher&#39;s guide. And the workbook pages are not at all <br/>
self-explanatory - there is no way for the kid to know what they&#39;re <br/>
supposed to do on a page. The hidden lesson (not very hidden) in this <br/>
is that you can&#39;t learn without instruction from a parent/teacher. It <br/>
is the opposite of &quot;empowering the learner.&quot; Bugs me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Kristina, from another unassisted-birther :)<br/>
<br/>
I have a 6 yo and an almost 12 yo, and I don&#39;t think I<br/>
have anything special in the house that would impress<br/>
the relatives....We have three TV&#39;s, 2 DVD&#39;s 2 VCR&#39;s,<br/>
a playstation and a computer--does that count?  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Like someone else said, my kids like to do REAL<br/>
stuff--not kid-craft stuff.  They like to weave on<br/>
real looms, and spin wool with a real spinning wheel,<br/>
and tie-dye clothes for themselves to wear, and knit<br/>
real scarves to wear, and cook real food that the<br/>
family will eat....etc.  Their art work is beautiful<br/>
and gets hung on the walls in frames, as it would if<br/>
it were from any other artist.  Their pottery pieces<br/>
are eaten out of at meal times, along with pottery<br/>
pieces from mom and dad...They read exciting books,<br/>
and write exciting books....they search for things<br/>
that interest them on the internet, with no one<br/>
hanging over their shoulders making sure what they<br/>
find is &quot;appropriate&quot;...they talk to people in the<br/>
community about their interests....they volunteer...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, these are just a few ideas....Mostly I wanted<br/>
to say &quot;hi&quot; :)<br/>

Exactly.  I have to say that we have never bred dogs or cats....but now give<br/>
me a goat, a bunny, a chicken......<br/>

We breed lots and lots of animals but all the babies are either sold, ate or<br/>
