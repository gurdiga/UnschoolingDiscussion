&gt;If this is a closed society, where differing opinions are not <br/>
&gt;welcome, then it should be a private board, not public.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Differing opinions will always have a opposite side :-) In a list of 600 <br/>
or so people, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s going to be dissention and <br/>
misundestandings.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the differences of opinions even if I am in total <br/>
disagreement with them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I find posts with differing opinions, well stated, food for thought. <br/>
&gt;I enjoy thought provoking conversation. Unfortunately it seems that <br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t welcome in some people&#39;s eyes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its not welcome in some people&#39;s eyes whether its f2f, on the net, or on <br/>
the phone. I suppose its better to just ignore the one&#39;s that always <br/>
object to an issue as opposed to stop discussing differences.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Which is why this list continues to have problems.<br/>
&gt;When a list is regularly &quot;outing&quot; people that don&#39;t say exactly what <br/>
&gt;you want to hear, that is a problem.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All lists that have &#39;cutting edge&#39; ideals will have issues. Thats why the <br/>
&#39;spiritual parenting&#39; list I spoke of didn&#39;t have issues. Everyone <br/>
complimented eachother, gave hugs, love and blessing and THAT list had NO <br/>
substance.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I wish I could understand what is so offensive about someone <br/>
&gt;questioning the words you use. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t either when its used for clarification. Since geography and even <br/>
&#39;family&#39; uses words that mean one thing and another person processes that <br/>
word to mean another.<br/>
Language.. why can&#39;t we all just do a Vulcan mind meld and get our <br/>
thoughts out without the damn words!!! *smile*<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t remember saying anything <br/>
&gt;dirogatory to the person I questioned. If I attacked a strongly held <br/>
&gt;belief then it should be easy enough to explain it and stand your <br/>
&gt;ground, right?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I missed the whole incident since I was busy on another listserv the last <br/>
few weeks with another issue (the scientific findings of the real Planet <br/>
X - and you should see the fur fly!).So I went on a digest here. I don&#39;t <br/>
always get a chance to read them and deleted a lot of them.<br/>
<br/>
But from what I&#39;ve read here the differing opinions are not that <br/>
different. Just some bad communication. I&#39;d like to go back into the <br/>
archives, but reading Yahoo online is a torture for me, even with a <br/>
high-speed connection.<br/>
<br/>
(For those that are into Astrology, Mercury is in retrgrade since the <br/>
15th or so of January and that means that communications is at a all time <br/>
low, or an all time high for miscommunications) Personally, I know <br/>
nothing of Astrology and dont&#39; hold a beleif about it either way - just <br/>
passing on some info from people that are into it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If not, then we could discuss it and seek further understanding.<br/>
&gt;Either way, there shouldn&#39;t be this ugliness shown to any dissenters.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in total agreement. There&#39;s nothing like a great debate to either <br/>
solidfy your own view or knock it off its axis enough for one to take a <br/>
look at oneself.<br/>
<br/>
Kinda like thinking things through out loud.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>YEs, words do mean different things to dofferent people.  And writing <br/>
styles can have a big effect.  Someone was discussing this on a <br/>
different list I&#39;m on recently.  Consensus was that those who tend to <br/>
speak in the active voice often come across and negative, <br/>
opinionated, rude, etc. because of their writing style. <br/>
<br/>
But I think what amazes me most is when even after you say, &quot;no that <br/>
is not what I meant&quot; people still insist on characterizing you as if <br/>
their misstatement of your thoughts is accurate.<br/>
<br/>
I try to give people the benefit of the doubt when they tell me I <br/>
misunderstood them.  <br/>

I should have looked it up. I wasn&#39;t quoting exactly, that&#39;s why I <br/>
put the disclaimer. I did realize I may have been reading something <br/>
into it that wasn&#39;t there.<br/>
I think the combination of people saying &quot;get lost if you don&#39;t like <br/>
our board&quot; gave me a feeling of ownership that I didn&#39;t feel was <br/>
right.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I attributed that entire view to Bridget.<br/>
<br/>
Just to recapitulate, so this won&#39;t get out of hand. I questioned the <br/>
idea that an unschool child could &quot;get behind&quot; and that we&#39;d help <br/>
them if they did.<br/>
I was jumped all over for even questioning the persons views.<br/>
In an unschool world, the idea of &quot;getting behind&quot; is nonexistant.<br/>
The person said she was not comparing her children to ps children, <br/>
nor imposing some false schedule on them.<br/>
That was a bit helpful to understand.<br/>
But then who are they being compared to if they can &quot;get behind&quot;.<br/>
I thought it was worthy of questioning.<br/>
I still think it is.<br/>
And I am dumbfounded that questioning that premise would cause all of <br/>
this backlash.<br/>

Yes I definitely agree with you here.  Even if a person miss-quotes you, <br/>
you can still get a good idea of how you are perceived by  that person.  <br/>
And, you can learn from this.  But, this is only half of the equation.<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t you also have to take into account the reader&#39;s experiences and <br/>
prejudices, not to mention their moods, etc. as they are reading what <br/>
you have written?  There is no way that we can know all these things <br/>
about our audience, since there are so many different individuals.    <br/>
Different people may react in different ways to a certain statement or <br/>
way of saying something based on their particular sensitivities at that <br/>
time.  So, in the end, shouldn&#39;t we just  try and communicate with each <br/>
other as clearly as possible and accept the words in front of us on the <br/>
screen for what they are?<br/>
<br/>
So, if a person is ever going to quote me, I hope it is going to be <br/>
complete, correct and in the appropriate context.<br/>

Yes.  This is precisely why I believe our actions are more powerful, <br/>
important, and lasting than our words.<br/>

Both of my children are behind from THEIR point of view. Oldest would like to have already finished geometry yet she&#39;s just starting it. She talks about this as a disappointment all the time. She has a goal.. a schedule... an agenda and she&#39;s not met her own expectations. She is disappointed yet she is still moving forward. My role as her parent, is to point out that what she perceives as &#39;behind&#39; isn&#39;t really behind at all if she considers that she&#39;s way ahead in other areas. <br/>

<br/>
Sarah, I used to know a grown-up (sorta--at least she&#39;s older &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
unschooler who said she *always* worried about this when she was young.<br/>
Because she *didn&#39;t* have any &quot;yardstick&quot; for comparison, she just always<br/>
felt she didn&#39;t know what she &quot;should&quot;.  She was only reassured when she was<br/>
able to help a friend through her school algebra class and knew the<br/>
answers....that was, when she had a &quot;yardstick&quot;.  No matter how much her<br/>
mother reassured her or talked with her about her fears, it didn&#39;t matter.<br/>
IN HER HEAD she worried.  I think it&#39;s probably a common phenomenon....not<br/>
inevitable, probably, but common, I bet.  I know one of my own teens has<br/>
struggled with this from time to time, too....which is the reason he chose<br/>
to do American School last year, I think.  It is his &quot;yardstick&quot;....his<br/>
&quot;proof&quot; to himself that he knows &quot;enough&quot;.  Now my daughter....she could<br/>
care less!  :-)<br/>
