If I do choose to say, or do something to this mom, she will either choose to <br/>
blow me off, or choose to let what I say/do sink it and consider it. This <br/>
will depend on where she is mentally/emotionally/spiritually, etc. This is what I <br/>
meant when I said she is doing what she is to her child (spanking) because <br/>
she is &quot;where she is&quot;, meaning in her own awareness...she only knows what she <br/>
chooses to know now, until she decides to become more open and consider other <br/>
ways.  <br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
It might not change the mom&#39;s actions at all,<br/>
but it could change the child&#39;s awareness of the world <br/>
and give her the idea that other adults don&#39;t agree, that there are other <br/>
ways, and that some adults are more courageous than his mother.<br/>

-=- In the spiritual realm, things are not perceived as &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, <br/>
&quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, -=-<br/>
<br/>
Not according to the Hindu view of reincarnation.  They have definite ideas <br/>
about beter and worse.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It is a human attribute that we think. . .-=-<br/>
<br/>
We are humans and we should act like it.<br/>
Any religion or philosophy could be wrong, but in any case, we&#39;re human.<br/>

previous lives.<br/>

<br/>
Let&#39;s limit this list to what people will do with their children to create a <br/>
great learning environment regardless of baggage from past lives or fear of <br/>
eternity.  Otherwise we&#39;ll be wasting too many people&#39;s time and energy.<br/>
<br/>
We have children now.<br/>
Were interested in unschooling now.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s religion doesn&#39;t allow for unschooling, then they can&#39;t <br/>
unschool.  That&#39;s fine.  Most people can&#39;t for one reason or another.<br/>
<br/>
For those who can, I&#39;m betting this list will continue to be a good source of <br/>
ideas and analysis.<br/>
