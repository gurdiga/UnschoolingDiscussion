<div id="ygrps-yiv-824881451">Alex just told me that if he plays 100  versus games on Super Smash Bros, <br/>
he gets a hidden character.  He says it took him about 5 minutes to play ten <br/>
versus matches, so he figures it&#39;ll take him less than an hour.  <br/>
<br/>
    He&#39;s keeping track of how many matches he&#39;s played, by occasionally <br/>
adding the number of lost matches, and won matches.  He says he&#39;s won most of them, <br/>
so it&#39;s really easy to add them up, but that he&#39;s going to finish all 100.   <br/>
He said he hopes he wins a good 90% of them.  I didn&#39;t know he knew what <br/>
percentages were.  <br/>

    Multiplication, adding, and percentages, from a video game. <br/>
