Do Pigeons Spread Disease? In a word &#39;no&#39;!  All wild birds have the potential <br/>
to pass on diseases to other birds and to human beings but the chances of <br/>
this happening are a million to one, certainly in the case of human beings.   <br/>
Pigeons are no more likely to transmit diseases to human beings than any other <br/>
species of wild bird. Why then do we read horror stories in the media every day <br/>
about the 60 or 70 fatal diseases that pigeons are capable of transmitting to <br/>
human beings?  Because the pest control industry and those that have a vested <br/>
commercial interest in controlling pigeons have a very efficient propaganda <br/>
machine constantly churning out scare stories designed to sell their products.  <br/>
Pest control is a multi-billion dollar industry worldwide and culling pigeons <br/>
and selling proofing products represents a large proportion of the profits <br/>
within this industry.  Because scientific research has proved that culling <br/>
pigeons is a completely ineffective method of control the pest control industry has <br/>
to scare the public into believing that they need to be concerned about <br/>
pigeons.  The best way to do that is to link pigeons with diseases. <br/>

&quot;To announce that there must be no criticism of the president,<br/>
 or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only <br/>
unpatriotic and servile, <br/>
but is morally treasonable to the American public.&quot;<br/>
