I did something similar when I was in high school.  I was pretty certain our<br/>
biology teacher was not reading our answers to the voluminous amounts of<br/>
homework he assigned.  I answered a few questions on one assignment, and<br/>
then inserted my mom&#39;s chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I got an &quot;A&quot; on that<br/>
assignment and on every other one. I guess the teacher did like me, but<br/>
after that &quot;experiment&quot; I didn&#39;t work so hard on the homework! (?(And<br/>
neither did any of my friends whom I showed the &quot;experiment to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The teacher should definitely be wondering why your son thinks she doesn&#39;t<br/>
read all his assignments.  She probably doesn&#39;t, but your son was unlucky<br/>
enough to find one that she happened to read!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191455570">Well here is the big laugh,<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t read the work, because if he did he would have caught more than<br/>
those two words.  Apparently my son added a whole bunch of non-related<br/>
answers to the questions.<br/>
<br/>
He apparently is pissed off because the teacher is more concerned with<br/>
length of answer than  with the answer itself. He spends time on his work,<br/>
reads the text, and searches out the answer while most kids look up the<br/>
answer and write a lot on the test....<br/>
<br/>
I can well understand why my son is pissed.  I just can&#39;t imagine calling a<br/>
parent over it...<br/>
<br/>
Be well,<br/>

But now that the teacher opened up the dialog, however negatively, I think it would be very empowering as well as productive to talk this out with the teacher.<br/>
