Please don&#39;t give up yet.  I&#39;ve gotten lots of support and ideas for<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; from this list.  I&#39;ve yet to meet a list that is RIGIDLY<br/>
on-topic.  Unschooling does encompass a wide variety of ideas.  After<br/>
all, unschooling is what our children do when they don&#39;t attend school. <br/>
We each need to do what is best for our own family and can&#39;t expect that<br/>
everything we read anywhere will fit our needs.  So give the list another<br/>
week or two before you decide if it&#39;s for you.<br/>
<br/>
Since breastfeeding is the biologically determined method of human (we<br/>
are mammals) feeding, I find it ridiculous that a child of any age would<br/>
need a bottle.  I also realize that many in our society tend to see<br/>
bottle feeding as the norm, so too many women and children have not been<br/>
able to breastfeed due to a lack of support and accurate information.  I<br/>
do respect any parent who has done the research and made an informed<br/>
decision that not breastfeeding is best for their own child.  And I feel<br/>
sad for those who were unable to breastfeed when they truly wanted to. <br/>
We can only try to do our best and continue on when life does not turn<br/>
out the way we plan.  Many of us on this list have already stepped out of<br/>
bounds of &quot;normal&quot;.  How can we be so bold as to think that our children<br/>
will become successful adults without 12 years of being taught everything<br/>
that someone else has decided is important?   Yet, I depend on the<br/>
support I get from this list to help me trust my children to learn what<br/>
they will need to have a good life.<br/>
