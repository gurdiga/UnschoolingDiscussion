<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837443344">&quot;No, wrong guess. I didn&#39;t write the Odissey.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s Odyssey.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m extremely baffled now. You only want your child to love and <br/>
be fascinated with YOU and what you write/sing/make up?<br/>
You are needing to let go of a LOT of baggage before joyful <br/>
unschooling will ever take place in your home.<br/>
I would venture to guess that there are some co-dependent behaviors <br/>
in your family. I could be wrong, but much of what you&#39;re written <br/>
sounds like it&#39;s from a place of deep insecurity, negativity and <br/>
fear. <br/>
Not a good environment for joy, which is the most important <br/>
ingredient in unschooling.<br/>
