<div id="ygrps-yiv-889466220">I talked to a friend of mine whose daughter is in public school <br/>
first grade.  She told me about the &quot;grading system&quot; for first <br/>
graders: <br/>
<br/>
N:  Not Complete<br/>
<br/>
Smiley Face:  Attempted Everything but either didn&#39;t do correctly or <br/>
didn&#39;t finish <br/>
<br/>
C:  Complete<br/>
<br/>
Wow:  Complete and extra effort obvious (How they judge the extra <br/>
effort is beyond me)<br/>
<br/>
Wow Wow (Double Wow): Completed everything with extra effort and <br/>
neatness<br/>
<br/>
My friend told me her daughter has never gotten beyond a Smiley Face <br/>
and that is OK with her but she said some of the other parents are <br/>
distraught because their kids aren&#39;t getting Wow&#39;s or Double Wow&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
 This would have been the school my daughter would be in if she had <br/>
gone to school.  This makes me very glad my daughter is not in <br/>
school as she would want to know exactly what each &quot;grade&quot; meant and <br/>
what she had to do to get one.  This is just her style.  I hate to <br/>
think of the damage that could have been done and is most likely <br/>
being done to the children in this first grade.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, I bought Sandra&#39;s book at the conference and it is a great <br/>
read.  It is a wonderful collection of essays that I thoroughly <br/>
enjoyed--along with the pictures of Sandra and her children.  I also <br/>
bought her peaceful parenting tape which has given me even more <br/>
tools to work with!  I recommend them both!<br/>

<br/>
Thanks.   Those are still available, though I&#39;m thinking of transcribing my <br/>
parts into the next book and not carrying tapes.    Lots of people are using <br/>
CDs and hardly tape players anymore, for one thing!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Still, it seems alot more subjective than when i was in elementary <br/>
school. We had &quot;S&quot; for Satisfactory (met the requirement), and &quot;U&quot; <br/>
for Unsatisfactory (didnt meet the requirement). Not &quot;you didnt meet <br/>
the requirement but we know you tried really hard&quot; (how do they know <br/>
someone DIDNT try.)<br/>
<br/>
Even when i was little, grades always seemed ridiculous to me. I <br/>
never understood why i had to PROVE that i knew something. Once i <br/>
wrote a book report in 7th or 8th grade. I wasnt there when the <br/>
assignment was given out, so i missed the requirements. It was a <br/>
huge book about John Lennon, and i wrote a lengthy report about it. <br/>
I got an &quot;E&quot; (failing), because i wrote it in pencil and it was <br/>
supposed to be in pen (or vice versa)...i thought then how <br/>
ridiculous. The teacher didnt even READ the report, just gave me a <br/>
failing grade. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad my parents didnt place any emphasis on grades. I usually <br/>
got As or Bs, but there wasnt any reward or punishment involved. <br/>
There was no fear of report card day or trying to change the <br/>
letters, like you see in sitcom episodes. <br/>

<br/>
Let&#39;s not let the list be about school.   Tell us a good story of something <br/>
sweet that happened at your house this week.<br/>
