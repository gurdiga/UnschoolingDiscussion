<br>Hi Faith,
<br>That is cute -- and a similar thing happened here too (with my son that I 
<br>used to suspect had Asperger&#39;s).
<br>
<br>I was just thinking that I hardly ever hear the words &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot;. However, I 
<br>was next to my son one morning as he was waking and he opened his eyes, 
<br>looked at me and said &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot;. &nbsp;LOL &nbsp;How can you be bored when you just 
<br>woke up? I think he really meant, &quot;I&#39;m not sure which thing I should do first 
<br>in this new day&quot;.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779861842">&quot;How do you respond or not respond to boredom in your home?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the positive things that have been written so far. I don&#39;t suggest they do a chore with me, I had that done to me as a child and hated it.<br/>
I see boredom as a restlessness. It&#39;s a feeling of having too much time on your hands and needing new input....why wouldn&#39;t I use that as an opportunity to find something fun?<br/>
So like others here, we have an idea list. <br/>
It&#39;s also a rare occasion that anyone even uses the word &quot;bored&quot; around here..their lives are pretty happy and interesting these days...but I didn&#39;t have a bunch of school to undo either.<br/>
Trevor is the one that will sometimes get bored, he&#39;s 14 and a bit restless. Computers take up most of his down time now, so it doesn&#39;t leave much room for restlessness.:)<br/>
He came to me and said &quot;I&#39;m bored out of my skull&quot; last week. He was in a &quot;stuck&quot; place. He couldn&#39;t get his new computer components up and running, he didn&#39;t feel like video gaming and the rest of us were happy being at home.<br/>
I told him I was willing to help find something projectish in a few minutes, and I handed him our &quot;How Stuff Works&quot; book, since he&#39;s been MAJOR into technology and the workings of computers and other inventions. He disappeared into his room and I didn&#39;t hear a thing for about 1/2 hour...then he shouts &quot;MOM, this book is SO cool, thanks for getting it out for me&quot;...then he&#39;s in the cave for about another 1/2 hour reading, finally emerging to get online and look up more stuff at the &quot;How Stuff Works&quot; website.<br/>
It&#39;s been an entire week of learning about magnetic ram and DNA micro-processors, which completely fascinate him (technology not perfected or available to the public yet), all from a moment of boredom.<br/>
<br/>
Part of being a creative soul is having down time...times when you seem to be doing nothing, time to assimilate all that you&#39;ve learned or created or thought about. Then you hit a spree of activity usually, a spurt when the ideas and learning seem to swirl about and flow like a river. Those down times are hugely important. I think boredom can be part of that time, and it might just be that time when the ideas and flow are about to start again. So go with it!! Jump in and offer new ideas, projects, outings, cool movies or books, maybe even a party. Why not?<br/>
