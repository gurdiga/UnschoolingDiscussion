<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>21 Aug 2004, at  5:28pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-956383380">Ok, 3 packs of cookies are gone in less than 2 days.<br/>
<br/>
That wouldn&#39;t be a problem except for one thing:<br/>
<br/>
They ate every single one without a thought that their dad might want some (since he bought them).<br/>
<br/>
He bought the last pack last night, and they were gone before lunch today.<br/>
<br/>
Its this inconsiderateness that I get angry at, not the fact that the cookies are gone.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-502433073">If I had felt it was important to Dad, I might have mentioned it to the kids<br/>
before the cookies were gone that he&#39;d like some when he got home.  If I<br/>
didn&#39;t remember to and realized it after, I would mention to the kids that<br/>
I&#39;d bet Dad would have liked to have some of those cookies, maybe next time<br/>
you could try to remember to save him some.   It would work here.  Not sure<br/>
about at your house. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-895349377">I have four kids. I&#39;m really realistic about how many minutes treats <br/>
will or can last in our house. We have treats that are freely <br/>
available. These range from pop, chips and candy to yoghurt, smoked <br/>
salmon, corn on the cob or an always full fruit bowl. <br/>
<br/>
When Mom or Dad have treats that aren&#39;t to be shared (or at least <br/>
not yet-like maybe a cake for dessert) we take them into our <br/>
bedroom. If it needs to be refridgerated or frozen then everyone is <br/>
made aware of whose treat it is. Likewise, if the kids have bought <br/>
themselves something (older ones) or requested a special something <br/>
(the whole bunch) they can also request that no one touch it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just a matter of basic respect in our house. Also, no one is <br/>
really ever hurting for treats here either.<br/>

the fact that the <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They&#39;re not doing it out of inconsideration, they&#39;re<br/>
doing it because the cookies taste good, and you have<br/>
lots of kids competing over who gets what. ;-) Big<br/>
family, right?<br/>
<br/>
You, as an adult, would maybe keep some reserved for<br/>
your husband...can you really see your young children<br/>
thinking of this on their own, and doing it?  <br/>
<br/>
You grab one package and say, hey guys, enjoy those<br/>
cookies, I&#39;m just gonna take this one for Dad. He<br/>
bought them, and he&#39;s going to want some. I&#39;m sure<br/>
he&#39;ll share when he opens them....Whatever. Or, you<br/>
just hide them. lol Seriously.  What cookies they<br/>
don&#39;t know about, won&#39;t hurt them. ;-) <br/>
<br/>
Kids this young (right?) don&#39;t automatically *think*<br/>
of these things, doesn&#39;t make them inconsiderate. As<br/>
parents of young children, we have to remember that<br/>
their experience of the world is limited, that&#39;s what<br/>
*we&#39;re* around for.  <br/>
<br/>
Beware of having adult expectations for young kids. If<br/>
you think of it that way, you might realize how goofy<br/>
it sounds. ;-)  I betcha if you mentioned how mad you<br/>
were for them not keeping any for Dad, they&#39;d be<br/>
shocked.  (not that you should do that, IMO, what&#39;s<br/>
done is done)<br/>

some by and not expect the kids to save some for him.  YOU save some for him.  <br/>
You&#39;re the one with the greater understanding.  <br/>

They can have freedom and your husband can have cookies.  Just takes a little <br/>

  We&#39;ve been &quot;free&quot; for about 2 years now...maybe longer.<br/>
<br/>
  The boundary issues have been going on since they were born.<br/>

    I think we have boundary issues here.  But I&#39;m at a loss as to how to <br/>
    &quot;facilitate&quot; respect for boundaries beyond what I&quot;m already doing, which is to model <br/>
    it, and verbalize it, and try to keep each of the kids out of the other one&#39;s <br/>
    space.<br/>
<br/>
    What do you do when that isn&#39;t enough?<br/>

    How long have you been trying to make a change from control to freedoms?<br/>
<br/>
