 (I;m not sure how you made that leap.)<br/>
This reminds me of &quot;If you don&#39;t fear God, how can you be a good person?&quot; <br/>
Physically, an abortion is surgery, is not painless and certainly requires <br/>
recovery time. There are otehr reasons not to have one other than because <br/>
&quot;it&#39;s a child&quot;.There are lots of reasons to avoid sex other than pregnancy or <br/>
VD. I hope my children all find partners that are as emotionally well <br/>
adjusted and not needy, but the fact is, there are loads of people who have <br/>
sex for stupid reasons. There are loads of people who will lie about, <br/>
manipulate, and cheat to get it. Winding up with one oif those people are a <br/>
very good reason to avaoid sex. I think it unfortunate that sex in our world <br/>
comes with so much baggage. It is a normal healthy physical act. And it <br/>
doesn&#39;t HAVE to be between two committed same sex people to be a good, happy, <br/>
healthy and right thing.<br/>
