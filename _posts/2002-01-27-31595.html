You bring up something that I have been thinking about lately.  I know some people say that unschooling is about freedom and there is no good or bad time spent. So if I am not way off on my understanding of that being an unschooling philosophy then answer me this. Other than some basic helping out around the house, what responsibilities should our unschooled kids have?  And I know most will say &quot;what ever they choose&quot; but in the past I could relate their ps time as their job. What do they need to learn to balance in their lives? <br/>
<br/>
I would love to sit here on my computer and read all 200 messages that I got today (I need to unsubscribe to some lists) but I have to balance this desire with the other things that need to get done.  I make a deal with myself that I will accomplish x or y before I sit down at the computer and allow myself x amount of time, etc.  The freedom I have is to make the deals with myself.  No one is telling me how much time or when I can have the computer and some days I might say bag it to my other stuff and veg for a little bit.  This is the same freedom I feel my kids should have.  <br/>
How can they learn to balance their desires and responsibilities in a life so free of responsibilities?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540113203">I didn&#39;t respond because there was a big flame war the last time I <br/>
said this. But here goes anyway:<br/>
I think there is a difference between unschooling and unparenting.  I <br/>
think that children should have household responsibilities.  How you <br/>
arrive at the breakdown of who does what and what the consequences <br/>
are is going to be different from family to family.  And it is <br/>
totally unrelated to what they choose to learn outside the scope of <br/>
family life.  My kids HAD to learn to cook and do laundry.  The don&#39;t <br/>
have to learn algebra or the history of the US.  Those are things <br/>
they choose to do.<br/>

growing, and isn&#39;t that still their main job?<br/>
<br/>
I think the people on this list handle the idea of chores in a lot of <br/>
different ways.  I think I&#39;m somewhere near the middle.  I do insist on one <br/>
kitchen chore daily.  I figure Rod earns the money for the meal.  I buy the <br/>
groceries and cook it.  Lars can do *something* to help with either prep or <br/>
clean up.  We ask him to do other things, but it&#39;s more asking than <br/>
insisting.  I ask him to bring in firewood and split kindling when Rod <br/>
isn&#39;t around, because I can&#39;t do it without a lot of pain.  Rod asks for <br/>
help when he needs it.  I don&#39;t worry about his room, and it gets cleaned <br/>
up more often than when I hassled him about it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think they gradually take on the responsibilities themselves.  When Lars <br/>
isn&#39;t working, he stays up late, sleeps in, and generally takes it <br/>
easy.  When he&#39;s working, he makes his lunch and gets his gear together in <br/>
the evening and then goes to bed early.  He gets up cheerfully in the <br/>
morning, because he&#39;s chosen to do this.  Even when he doesn&#39;t feel like <br/>
getting up and going to work, he does anyway because he&#39;s made a commitment <br/>
to his dad to be there.  At 14, his work habits and attitudes are better <br/>
than any of his older sibs (who went to school) and better than many of the <br/>
other employees.<br/>

<br/>
Kolleen,<br/>
My own personal understanding of unschooling is that your child is allowed<br/>
to pursue an autonomous or self-directed education.  I think the definition<br/>
ends there. Other decisions that you make regarding your children&#39;s limits<br/>
or parenting are separate issues.  Granted, a lot of things overlap and<br/>
there are many gray areas, but I would consider anyone who allows their<br/>
children to be self-directed in their education as unschool.  I think that<br/>
can include people who do not have a t.v. or choose to limit t.v or people<br/>
who make their children brush their teeth or straighten up a room.  Every<br/>
child&#39;s environment is controlled to some extent.  I think the line is drawn<br/>
when someone forces their child to do school work, including forced reading,<br/>
games, math, listening to stories that they do not choose, copy work, work<br/>
sheets, practicing an instrument, etc.  I didn&#39;t realize that other people<br/>
didn&#39;t define unschooling similarly.  From all the books I have read<br/>
concerning unschooling, that is what I have surmised.  Of course, there is<br/>
always room for other people to interpret things differently, however, after<br/>
being on unschooling lists for the last few years, that is what I understand<br/>
most other unschoolers to believe too.<br/>
<br/>
YMMV,<br/>

chores (or not watch TV).  If it&#39;s for their good, like they have to learn <br/>
to do chores before they grow up and leave the house, or  because TV rots <br/>
their minds, or whatever, then I&#39;d have to say it isn&#39;t unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, my reason for insisting on a dinner chore is just that <br/>
I&#39;m not willing to do it all myself.  I suppose if he balked at doing <br/>
something to help, I might just balk at fixing dinner.  I&#39;m not sure what <br/>
I&#39;d do.  If he consistently put the TV up so loud that I couldn&#39;t tune it <br/>
out, I&#39;d probably insist on earphones or something.  (We&#39;ll have to see how <br/>
that one pans out.  We just got a TV and cable last week.)  But none of <br/>
this insisting is because it&#39;s for his own good, which is what insisting on <br/>
math curriculum or journal writing or whatever would be.  That&#39;s where I <br/>
feel I can still call what we do unschooling.  I suppose others might disagree.<br/>

<br/>
It really feels awful to find yourself resenting someone that you love.  I<br/>
know.  I&#39;ve been there.  My son is 9 and we have been going through the same<br/>
thing.  I think it must be harder when the kids are going from being<br/>
controlled to making their own decisions.  Or perhaps its a boy thing<br/>
because both of my boys are having many more issues than any of my 3 girls.<br/>
<br/>
It has been about a year since the controls came off.  We have never been a<br/>
real controlling house but we saw where we had made some fairly arbitrary<br/>
&quot;rules&quot; and worked to change that.  Zach initially did pretty well as far as<br/>
self regulating but then it seemed that no matter where the line was drawn<br/>
(not being rude and hurtful to people) it was a major battle.  He wouldn&#39;t<br/>
go to bed at night.  We would say fine but please turn out the lights.  When<br/>
we got up in the morning, EVERY light would be on REPEATEDLY.  He would get<br/>
out dh&#39;s tools and dh would say great but please put them back when you are<br/>
done.  I don&#39;t think they were EVER put back without it becoming a big<br/>
argument over doing what you say you&#39;ll do.  I would ask him to do some<br/>
minor thing, like please pick up his jacket that he threw in the kitchen<br/>
floor and I would just get a list of reasons why he didn&#39;t have to.  Zach<br/>
would commit to projects for 4-H, things that infringed on other people in<br/>
the club if he didn&#39;t do them, I would remind him and then he would get mad<br/>
at me for bringing it up.<br/>
<br/>
It got to where I didn&#39;t want to spend time with him, didn&#39;t want to talk<br/>
with him because no matter what, he tried to turn it into an argument. He<br/>
would ask what time it was, I would look at the clock and tell him just<br/>
about 10:00, he would then proceed to tell me how I&#39;m wrong that it is 9:59.<br/>
He would get accidentally jostled by a younger sibling and yell at them.  I<br/>
would touch his shoulder and point out that it was an accident.  Zach would<br/>
jerk away from me and yell at me.  This got worse and worse over months.  I<br/>
finally lost it.  Told him I refused to be treated that way by anyone, that<br/>
I refused to have my children treated that way by anyone including him,<br/>
pointed out how I treat him with respect but that I refused to be his<br/>
whipping boy. (Reading back over this it sounds like I was calm,  I wasn&#39;t.<br/>
I really lost it....not something I&#39;m proud of)<br/>
<br/>
Zach has for now moved back into my structuring a lot of his life.  It has<br/>
been 2 days and he truly seems happier.  I don&#39;t know what that means.  Is<br/>
the problem the lack of imposed structure or is it an adoption issue related<br/>
to birth mom having another child?  Did the lack of structure somehow equal<br/>
loss of love to him?  Did he act ugly to me to try to get the structure<br/>
(love) back and it pushed me farther away?  Should I have just hugged him<br/>
anyway (even though when I did he would just pull away)?  Should my letting<br/>
go have been much more gradual?  I don&#39;t know the answers to any of it.  I<br/>
do know that my girls are doing great with lack of imposed structure.<br/>
<br/>
Any and all comments are welcome<br/>

whipping boy. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t seem unreasonable to me.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids have been yucky to one another from time to time, I&#39;ve talked to <br/>
the agressor and said things like &quot;I love you and I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re so <br/>
frustrated, but I&#39;m (Marty&#39;s or Holly&#39;s) mom too, and it&#39;s my job to see that <br/>
you&#39;re all safe and comfortable in your own home.  You can&#39;t <br/>
(torment/hit/shame/threaten) him/her here and not expect me to make you stop. <br/>
 I&#39;d make strangers and bad guys stop it, and I&#39;m making you stop it. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is to suggest that if they want to do that they need to get <br/>
their own place.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you want to be hateful to Marty, you need to wait until you can rent our <br/>
own apartment, and invite him over.  THEN you can act however you want.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think he&#39;ll come, if you keep treating him this way, but you could <br/>
invite him.  But you can&#39;t do it here, where it&#39;s his house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I was teaching junior high I used to say that to kids who were bristling <br/>
up for a fight at lunch or something.  I&#39;d say to one (if I knew one or had <br/>
one in my class) or sometimes if I was lucky BOTH, &quot;Hey, if you guys want to <br/>
fight maybe you should ask your mom to drive you to his house after school, <br/>
you knock on the door and ask his mom if he can come out to fight.  And do it <br/>
there, in his driveway.  Maybe his dad or his brothers will want to get <br/>
involved!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;d say it all merrily as though it were a happy alternative.  But I <br/>
rarely got past the &quot;ask your mom to drive you over&quot; before lots of kids were <br/>
laughing and seeing it as the ludicrous thing it was.<br/>
<br/>
What seems reasonable in the heat of the moment is often silly looking with <br/>
more light and humor on it.<br/>

<br/>
Your son sounds a lot like my boys.. ( maybe it IS a boy thing)..My 11 yo, <br/>
Ethan, is very much like Zach.  I think some people DO need structure.  They <br/>
become unsure and overwhelmed without it.   I can not relenquish all rules <br/>
and restrictions on my children.   I have read much about unlimited game and <br/>
TV time.  I do agree, that restricting time on these activities only makes <br/>
children obsess over them.. And I also know that if given unlimited use, <br/>
children will self regulate in time.  BUT, there is the issue of &quot;fairness&quot;  <br/>
For instance, we only have one computer.  All four children  ( and Mom and <br/>
Dad) cant physically have unlimited use of it.  There has to be limits.  I <br/>
have to say, Ethan, you can play for an hour, then it is JPs turn. .. And, I <br/>
have found that &quot;banning&quot; them from things they enjoy is a good consequence <br/>
for inappropiate actions.  &quot;OK boys, if you dont straighten up your room, you <br/>
can not watch Yugi Oh.      I am sure, in the unschooling philosophy, my <br/>
practices may not be acceptable, but, like I have said before, . every family <br/>
has to do what works for THEM.    <br/>

Six people can share a bathroom and yet still get to stay in as long as they <br/>

<br/>
If no one else needs in, take your time.  Bathroom or computer.<br/>

have found that &quot;banning&quot; them from things they enjoy is a good consequence <br/>
for inappropiate actions.  &quot;OK boys, if you dont straighten up your room, you <br/>
can not watch Yugi Oh.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Who will withhold what from them when they leave home to get them to clean <br/>
their rooms?<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re only trained to clean to get a reward, and not because having a <br/>
clean room is nice, will they have clean rooms when they&#39;re grown?<br/>
<br/>
If Yugi Oh has any value to them and you can see the value, will making them <br/>
&quot;earn&quot; the privilege of doing something important and useful make their <br/>
relationship with parents more trusting and solid?<br/>
<br/>
-=- I think some people DO need structure.  They <br/>
become unsure and overwhelmed without it.   I can not relenquish all rules <br/>
and restrictions on my children. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Relinquish&quot; has an extreme meaning.  It&#39;s to totally dissolve a situation <br/>
all of a sudden.<br/>
<br/>
If what your children do is done for good reasons and what you ask is for a <br/>
good reason, you can move from rules and restrictions to helping them make <br/>
good decisions  made on principle.<br/>
<br/>
Learning to live from principle will last a lifetime.<br/>
Learning to live with rules and restrictions only lasts until the rules and <br/>
restrictions are gone.<br/>

To me it seems like all those things could be playing a role, especially the <br/>
birth mother thing.  But I also think he just doesn&#39;t trust that he&#39;s really <br/>
free to do what he wants.  It&#39;s not safe for him.  Maybe he thinks that <br/>
you&#39;re pulling his chain and don&#39;t really mean what you say?  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest son couldn&#39;t make the leap to complete freedom when I took him out <br/>
of school.  He went back within a year.  It was safer for him to be told what <br/>
to do.  Thus, he&#39;s in the Army.  ?  Anyway, he was angry at me for a while, <br/>
and still holds some kind of resentment, but I think he&#39;s getting some <br/>
perspective in boot camp.  ;)  At least according to his letters.  <br/>

<br/>
But I do see in my son an ability to be very cynical about the &quot;system&quot; and <br/>
to work it to his advantage.  (I&#39;m not quite sure that&#39;s a good thing.)  For <br/>
instance, they made him platoon leader in boot camp, which is something he <br/>
wanted, because he has lots of experience and he has his mother&#39;s leadership <br/>
abilities &lt;g&gt;.  But he said his platoon was full of inept people (I won&#39;t use <br/>
the words he did), and so he worked it so they would fire him.  He didn&#39;t <br/>
want to be responsible for their mistakes.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think he would have had that capacity if there hadn&#39;t been that one <br/>
year of homeschooling.  He learned he could change things, and didn&#39;t have to <br/>
stay with the status quo.  I&#39;m not too thrilled about the way he did it, but <br/>
he&#39;s still learning.<br/>

I quoted rights and freedoms because my children do not have total freedom or <br/>
unlimited rights in our house.  In our society, there is no such thing as <br/>
absolute freedom or rights.   You are now implying that the rights and <br/>
freedoms my children have are not real.   What gives you basis to make that <br/>
judgement?  Because they have to ration thier time on the PC? Or finish thier <br/>
chores before they watch TV? <br/>
<br/>
 . Actually, I was misleading in saying &quot;straighten their rooms&quot;  that is <br/>
just what came off the top of my head.  They dont clean thier rooms.. And <br/>
they dont care if they are nice and clean. Oh yeah, they like them nice and <br/>
clean, but not enough to do it themselves.. You can&#39;t walk in thier rooms. <br/>
They cant find thier toys or games or clothes.   My mother didnt make me <br/>
clean my room either. and I am a terrible housekeeper.  Its a very sore point <br/>
with my husband, sometimes I wish I had been made to keep my room clean.. ( <br/>
OK rambling now).. But, they do have some family chores that I need them to <br/>
do to help keep our household together.. Washing dishes,  folding laundry, <br/>
feeding the pets, picking up after themselves in the living room and <br/>
bathroom..<br/>

<br/>
  I do consider myself an unschooler.   I dont use a curriculum or follow <br/>
conventional methods in raising my children.  My family is totally &quot;out <br/>
there&quot;, liberated, if you will.    I don&#39;t believe every person has to <br/>
subscribe to every one of your ( or any other unschooler&#39;s) beliefs to be a <br/>
true unschooler.  I am sure others on this list have their own methods and <br/>
practices for unschooling and parenting thier children.  Are we not allowed <br/>
to voice our opinions and thoughts if they differ from yours?  What I do not <br/>
understand is the compulsive need to convert every one to your way of <br/>
thinking in every aspect of homeschooling and parenting.   We are all <br/>
different, and it&#39;s all good.<br/>

Whoa, wait a minute there.<br/>
Bit back? Let&#39;s look at the statement I made that catapaulted this into a <br/>
defense mode, shall we.<br/>
There was a statement made (I didn&#39;t even look to see who said it, nor did I <br/>
care) that every family has to do what works for THEM.<br/>
I took exception to that IDEA, to the statement. Because I don&#39;t agree that <br/>
when people say this they mean what works for everyone. It means what works <br/>
for part of the family.<br/>
I questioned an idea, a concept, a statement.<br/>
That&#39;s biting?<br/>
Wow.<br/>
I think you need to re-read my post and my statement that my kids are equally <br/>
important in what works for our family in a different light perhaps.<br/>
It was a statement.<br/>
It was no attack on you or anyone else. I questioned an idea, I made a <br/>
statement about my family and you somehow turned it into a personal vendetta <br/>
against your parenting.<br/>
Slow down....take a deep breath....re-read the post that pissed you off so <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The post that pissed me off so bad was not really your orignal reply, it was <br/>
Sandras reply.    <br/>
<br/>
Others on this list will skirt around it,  or basically keep thier mouth shut <br/>
and not rock the boat.   But, this list is not really for unschoolers.  Its <br/>
if for a select few to tout thier ideals and methods as the only way to <br/>
unschool.  I have seen it over and over, and not just in conflict with my <br/>
personal opinions.   It reminds me of  denominations within Christianity who <br/>
think they are the only people going to heaven and everyone who does not <br/>
agree or subsribe to thier beliefs is doomed for Hell.    Sandra didnt reply <br/>
to all of the comments I made in my post, she picked the quotations mark <br/>
issue.. PFFFTTT.. big freaking deal.   What a petty issue.    I know that <br/>
what I post here is basically ignored, unless there is an iota of <br/>
disagreement with the few that reign here.  Then , my words are picked apart <br/>
like a decaying carcass by a vulture.   The funny thing is, I DO agree with <br/>
about 90% of what most practice on this list.  But I will not conform to peer <br/>
pressure to change my practices 100% to what someone thinks will work for my <br/>
family.   It&#39;s unfortunate that others wont come forward and agree with me <br/>
that we are all diverse in our unschooling methods.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I couldn&#39;t disagree with this statement more.  Unschooling is a way of life.  <br/>
Many aspects of life are affected by our choice to unschool and are relevant <br/>
to the discussion.  Why shouldn&#39;t people share what works, what doesn&#39;t, what <br/>
principles they follow, how their children react and learn and grow?  How <br/>
else are we going to learn from each other?  If we don&#39;t question our <br/>
beliefs, how are we to grow?<br/>
<br/>
This whole issue of something taking a questioning response personally tends <br/>
to come up every week or so.  Maybe that&#39;s why so many folks keep their <br/>
mouths shut, they&#39;ve defended the list before.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I will agree, I take from this list what I want and ignore the rest.  I find <br/>
a lot and I mean tons of wonderful information, some seems everyone is on <br/>
that level other get attacked for this or that or feel they do and I take <br/>
what they said and agree, I just don&#39;t feel a need to beat a dead horse and <br/>
argue or try to change someone else&#39;s thoughts especially when I teach my <br/>
children to stand by their thoughts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tuck, I hate to say it , but they make almost EVERYBODY platoon leader at <br/>
some point in Basic. (Although I am SURE he is as wonderful as you say!)<br/>
  But he said his platoon was full of inept people (I won&#39;t use <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; the words he did), and so he worked it so they would fire him.  He didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; want to be responsible for their mistakes.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is why there are so many different platoon leaders. Most do the same. <br/>
There is a reason for everything in Basic. They (The drill sergeants) are <br/>
taught an awful lolt about emotional stress.<br/>

And aren&#39;t they figuring out which of those guys show some potential in a <br/>
leadership role and which just further prove that they&#39;re not all that <br/>
together?  <br/>

I figured it was a sorting process.<br/>

Sometimes in Advanced Individual Training (AIT) when they teach you your job<br/>
Definately in real life army.<br/>
Basic is so far from Real life Army it&#39;s like a different world.<br/>
