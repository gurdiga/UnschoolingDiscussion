<br/>
Anyhooo.....Hello everyone!  My name is Holly and I have two girls.  Lili <br/>
who is age 4, and Tacy who is age 2.   We are a military family stationed on <br/>
Terciera Island, in the Azores, Portugal.  I don&#39;t know much about <br/>
unschooling but It sounds very interesting and I want to learn more about <br/>
it.  I started Homeschooling Lili last fall using the Oak Meadow Preschool <br/>
curriculum.   Im really happy that I found this list though because Im <br/>
always looking for more ideas.<br/>
