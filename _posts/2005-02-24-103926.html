<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284682000">My mom and I talked on the phone today, and she expressed concern <br/>
that my kids are really learning anything and are going to be okay.  <br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;But if they don&#39;t have to do anything, all they&#39;ll do is <br/>
play.  They won&#39;t know to ponder what Milton meant in Paradise Lost <br/>
or learn algebra 2.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I tried to explain unschooling to her, but she just sighed and <br/>
said, &quot;I can never get through to you&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a retired math teacher and is probably going to be taking a 3 <br/>
month job as a permanent substitute math teacher at a high school.  I <br/>
think that&#39;s what has probably sparked her concern.  We&#39;ve been <br/>
unschooling several years now, and homeschooling before that, and the <br/>
kids have never been to school. When we first decided to homeschool <br/>
she said that homeschooling was &quot;a slap in the face to her <br/>
profession&quot;.  She seemed to get over that though, and even seemed <br/>
supportive.  When we got into unschooling she seemed to understand <br/>
it, even though she didn&#39;t completely agree.  Now she&#39;s acting as <br/>
though she doesn&#39;t even understand it at all.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that now that she&#39;s taking a job as a teacher, her old &quot;slap <br/>
in the face to her profession&quot; feelings might be coming back, but <br/>
also genuine concern. <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of emailing her some articles about how kids learn <br/>
things, specifically math and literature since those were the <br/>
specific examples she mentioned.  I looked through Sandra&#39;s articles <br/>
and thought maybe the Jubilation and Triangulation article? <br/>
 ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/dot/hypotenuse">http://sandradodd.com/dot/hypotenuse</a> )<br/>
<br/>
I remember reading an article once about an unschooler doing stuff <br/>
that lead to Shakespeare.  I think it started out by playing cards?  <br/>
Was that on this list, or in a magazine, or....?  Anyone know what <br/>
I&#39;m talking about?  <br/>
<br/>
Any other suggested articles for a grandma math teacher worrying that <br/>
her unschooled kids are going to be okay?  I think something that <br/>
shows how &quot;playing&quot; can lead to learning stuff she sees as only being <br/>
learned in school.  She wouldn&#39;t read John Holt but she&#39;d read a <br/>
short, interesting article.  I&#39;m also going to lend her Pam <br/>
Shorooshian&#39;s mathematical joy tapes and maybe one or two others. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685112652">a long time ago, when we were first getting started unschooling, I <br/>
wrote about my oldest daughter following her interests into <br/>
Shakespeare. I posted it here, but it&#39;s buried somewhere from two <br/>
years ago or maybe more.<br/>
<br/>
It started with her reading Tolkien, from there into a love for <br/>
Medieval history, and early English literature, including Chaucer and <br/>
of course, Shakespeare. She&#39;s got several monologues memorized, and <br/>
opens on Saturday night as Narissa, from A Merchant of Venice. <br/>
Because she started reading Tolkien when she was 7ish. <br/>
<br/>
Besides Shakespeare, this kid has forgotten more about English <br/>
history than I&#39;ve ever known, from pre-Norman days through the <br/>
Tudors. She also knows a bit about Norse mythology...thank you <br/>
Tolkien! <br/>
<br/>
I have a similar problem, my mom having been a public school teacher. <br/>
But things haven&#39;t been so bad for me, since my 17 year old has <br/>
always been such a reader. If she&#39;d been more of a video gamer, or <br/>
watched more TV or something, my mom would&#39;ve been more alarmed. She <br/>
seems to be, with the younger ones. Alarmed, I mean.<br/>

I know they have been homeschooling since Jett was school age. (their son)<br/>
At that time they had said that the boy went elsewhere to actually do the<br/>
schooling. That he kept school and home separate. Never actually said<br/>
someone else tutored him but I kind of got that impression. But that was<br/>
ages ago and maybe they loosened up a lot since then. I saw the show too and<br/>
it nice to hear the way he talked about their life being &quot;strange.&quot; He said<br/>
they were like the Munsters or the Addams family, take your pick!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-582200825">I&#39;m emerging from my two weeks of listening, so I just wanted to say hello<br/>
and introduce myself.<br/>
<br/>
I first became fascinated with the concept of unschooling as I was deciding<br/>
to leave my job as a high school English teacher a couple of years ago.<br/>
Three-and-a-half years of trying desperately to give students freedom and<br/>
respect within the classroom led to the inevitable realization that schools<br/>
aren&#39;t really there for learning.  I&#39;ve done ESL tutoring online and by<br/>
phone since then.<br/>
<br/>
Now my husband Joe and I are expecting our first child in April and looking<br/>
forward to living and learning with a little one here in upstate NY.<br/>
Although he still works as an English teacher to earn most of our income and<br/>
provide our health insurance, our ultimate goal is to spring him and give<br/>
him a chance to deschool and enjoy life.  In the meantime, we have a window<br/>
on the world of compulsory education that provides fodder for good<br/>
discussions, and he has a job that will give him the summer to bond with the<br/>
new baby.  Between the two of us, we could probably add a book to the Grace<br/>
Llewllyn/John Holt/John Gatto genre someday.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
After spending 23 years in one institution or another (school, college, back<br/>
in school as a teacher), I definitely needed some time to deschool.  Only<br/>
recently have I felt as if I&#39;ve gotten to the point of shaking of most<br/>
limiting, school-y notions and habits.  Interestingly enough, I counted up<br/>
the months it took, and the grand total was 24.  That oft-repeated idea<br/>
about it taking 1 month per year of schooling to deschool seems to be right<br/>
in my case.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve enjoyed listening during the past couple of weeks and am looking<br/>
forward to sharing ideas.<br/>

I don&#39;t have an article to recommend, but perhaps you could point out that<br/>
they might not get a chance to appreciate either algebra or the works of<br/>
Milton in a compulsory school.  <br/>
<br/>
In the case of algebra, there is no guarantee that they&#39;ll learn it, even if<br/>
the information is offered.  I loved quadratic equations, so I remember<br/>
them, but I only have the faintest inkling of graphs and sin, tangent...what<br/>
was that stuff?  <br/>
<br/>
I taught many levels and grades of English, but I never taught Milton.<br/>
Let&#39;s see...did I ever read him?  Pretty sure I did, but I honestly can&#39;t<br/>
remember specifics.  I gather he&#39;s pretty important, so I&#39;m a bit<br/>
embarrassed.  Should I be?  Now how did I get a BA and an MA and only have a<br/>
faint whispering of Milton in my mind?  How was I ever entrusted with<br/>
&quot;honors&quot; students?  Maybe I&#39;ll brush up against him again in life and<br/>
something will stick.  Maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that formal schooling (and even advanced or specialized degrees)<br/>
offers no guarantee of appreciation or of the kind of learning that stays<br/>
with a person and can be drawn upon later.  Maybe this would make some sense<br/>
to her?<br/>

because of what they&#39;ve seen happening to kids in school.<br/>
<br/>
Joe (dh and a teacher) and I often talk about people who work in schools and<br/>
don&#39;t seem to see the things that we see--that kids are really learning very<br/>

 <br/>
We had to take either Milton or Chaucer when I was in the English program  at <br/>
UNM. Chaucer was highly feared because one had to read it in Middle  English <br/>
(not much like modern English at all).  So at least for some number  of those <br/>
who went to the University of New Mexico, studying Milton was the  coward&#39;s <br/>
way out. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I was interested in the history of England, so learning Middle English was  a <br/>
big JOY for me.<br/>

As for  the hanging out in Wal-Mart at midnight, it is probably <br/>
because  celebrities often shop at off-hours so they can have the <br/>
store to  themselves. They pay the store to open just for them and to <br/>
keep out other  customers.<br/>
 <br/>
====================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are 24 hour walmarts, and I doubt anyone could afford to pay them to  <br/>
CLOSE it for an hour.  And unless they went out a side door, it would  <br/>
defeatthe purpose of not being seen, as other customers would be waiting for the  <br/>
doors to open or close.<br/>
 <br/>
Someone who&#39;s going to pay a store to open after hours will probalby pick a  <br/>
better store than Walmart.<br/>

 <br/>
Im not sure my mom will ever completely loose the learning is divided into subjects one must study mindset......yet she left teaching. She taught 4th grade for a while and ended up with a 10 year old little girl pregnant yes really pregnant. She almost got fired for trying to get this girl help that she truly needed . <br/>
Then later she taught kindergarten and teachers were not allowed to touch their students. So she has these little 5 year olds barely even out of toddler stage who get feelings hurt, fall down etc but she cant give them a hug. <br/>
She got tired of all the &quot;red tape&quot; and paperwork she was having to do to keep administrators happy and how little teaching she was actually doing and changed professions. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-576938200">I&#39;m seventeen and a junior right now; he&#39;s fifteen and a freshman.<br/>
I love unschooling. I think I&#39;ll seem more unschooled than he will - I<br/>
want to be a writer, whereas he wants to be an engineer, so he will<br/>
need much more technical knowledge. He&#39;ll spend more time studying<br/>
things. I think that will be a good experience for him, though, to be<br/>
able to devote himself fully to things like engineering projects. He&#39;s<br/>
also a really good carpenter and was hired by one of our parents&#39;<br/>
friends to do some work. Dad helped him, just because he did need some<br/>
guidance, but he&#39;s very skilled. I think he would love to have more<br/>
time for that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063518408">John Gatto talks about this somewhere in his myriad essays. Teaching <br/>
as a profession was frowned upon, though teaching something that one <br/>
is already proficient in, like cooking, or math, for that matter. Get <br/>
a mathematician to teach math...what a concept...<br/>
<br/>
And the premise is right on: if a person gets paid to teach, it is in <br/>
his or her best interests that the students remain untaught as long <br/>
as possible, or in as many fields as possible.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I just have to ask -- what do you mean by &quot;I remember them?&quot;  Do you <br/>
mean you remember the formula for finding the roots of a quadratic <br/>
equation? Or do you have an understanding of situations in which a <br/>
quadratic equation would be useful, how you&#39;d figure out what equation <br/>
to use, why you&#39;d want to solve for the roots, and what the meaning of <br/>
the roots would be? Do you know what a graph of a quadratic equation <br/>
looks like and what information it provides?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I only remember taking some very simple steps to solve them, so when I said<br/>
that I remember them, I guess I meant that I think I could still solve one<br/>
today, at least the simple kind I was given in school.    <br/>
<br/>
I had/have absolutely no idea of how they would be useful or what they<br/>
meant, but I got a kind of soothing pleasure out of following a series of<br/>
steps to arrive at a final answer--kind of the same feeling of<br/>
accomplishment I get after cleaning a grimy sink and making it sparkle.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I appreciate the quadratic equations so much as the sense of<br/>
symmetry and order I got from them.  Finding the value of X was fun!<br/>
<br/>
So how ARE those quadratic equations useful out there in the world?<br/>

How lucky you were to have such a horrible teacher to work with!  <br/>
<br/>
The teachers who guided me through student teaching were sensitive, caring<br/>
and trying to be progressive in their methods.  That only gave me hope that<br/>
I would find &quot;the answer,&quot; so I persisted far longer than I needed to.  I<br/>
learned a lot, but it took a loooong time.<br/>

&lt;&lt; They&#39;re being paid not to. I think it was Socrates who said something to<br/>

That&#39;s true.  What you do as a teacher is being colored by the fact that<br/>
you&#39;re being paid to stay in step with the system, and that pay can be taken<br/>
away if you stray too far.  It can become more about your safety and<br/>
security than about communicating something important to others.<br/>
<br/>
I still wonder at the blindness among teachers, though.  I mean, I can<br/>
understand people outside the schools not &quot;getting&quot; how that kind of<br/>
institutionalization can damage a person, but what about the people who live<br/>
it every day?  It&#39;s physically and mentally painful to witness and<br/>
participate in.  I guess it&#39;s a kind of blocking mechanism, similar to what<br/>
prison guards need to employ to stay in their jobs.  <br/>
<br/>
In the classroom, Joe just tries to be as human as possible, takes the<br/>
chance to form more &quot;real&quot; relationships with students when he can, and<br/>
tries to expose school for what it is through gentle mockery, especially<br/>
with the older students who are almost free.  Still, it&#39;s hurting him to be<br/>
there.  Our &quot;Free Joe&quot; campaign continues.  :-)  <br/>
