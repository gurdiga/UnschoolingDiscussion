 </span></blockquote>A ukelele is nice - four strings and fairly simple to learn to play.<br/>
I love the sound of the mandolin,  but it would definitely cost more <br/>
and probably be more difficult to learn to play.  There are also <br/>
child-size guitars available, although sound quality does vary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763191898">We have a violin and a classical guitar, neither of which any of us<br/>
currently know how to play... we&#39;re just beginning to teach ourselves.<br/>
The question relates to my 3yo son. He&#39;s loving &quot;messing around&quot; with<br/>
the violin, but prefers to &quot;play&quot; it like a guitar.  So, for you<br/>
instrument buffs out there, what&#39;s a really small &quot;guitar-type&quot;<br/>
instrument we could get for him that would sound nice with the guitar<br/>
and violin, once we all learn to play?  A ukelele?? mandolin??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

He is now in the process of putting together a CD of his original music.  <br/>
Singing and playing guitar.  Ukelele worked for OUR family!!<br/>
