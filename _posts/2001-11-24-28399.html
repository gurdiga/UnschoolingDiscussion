I think it&#39;s wrong to give social workers the power to take children<br/>
that they have now.  Accidents can happen and there are vastly<br/>
different views of what a parents&#39; role is, as we all know very<br/>
well!  Legally, we need to respect parenting styles that are<br/>
different than our own. Whether or not we believe a parent should<br/>
spank a child should be irreleveant legally.  We can debate the issue<br/>
with the parent on a personal level, but not threaten to send a<br/>
social worker to take the child!!!  If we do that, pretty soon<br/>
they&#39;ll be sending social workers to take other children because they<br/>
don&#39;t have a bed time or don&#39;t know how to read when they&#39;re 9.<br/>
Freedom is a wonderful thing when we actually exercise it.<br/>

love google.com!  Don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a search engine work so well.<br/>
