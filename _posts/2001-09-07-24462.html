<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow you sound so defensive of the choices your husband has made to <br/>
leave his family.  When my husband got out of the airforce 5 years <br/>
ago we make a whopping $156 a week on unemployment that he was <br/>
entitled too.  We bought a house with an $800 mortgage payment.  I <br/>
wasn&#39;t going to dump my child in daycare and decided to start a <br/>
business that would work around my child.  My husband switched <br/>
professions and had to start at the bottom of the ladder.  We racked <br/>
up tons of bills, so what... creditors calling all the time.  Missed <br/>
a couple of mortgage payments, but the ultimate goal of one of us <br/>
being at home with our son and then sons all the time was <br/>
accomplished.  Now we are debt free and credit card friendly, no late <br/>
payments for 2 years and still husband quits a steady job to go <br/>
contracting so he can be with his kids.<br/>
<br/>
Now this is the kind of faith in God that I&#39;d really love to see <br/>
religous people have.  My experience, and it is extensive with people <br/>
who profess to be very religious, is that they are fear based.  Now <br/>
I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not all of them.  But the ones I&#39;ve encountered have <br/>
no faith that God will take care of them if they change their <br/>
lifestyle and step out on a limb.<br/>
<br/>
I have utter faith in God that I will be taken care of no matter what <br/>
and that cannot be shaken.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; now his job takes him away from the family during the week. He is only home<br/>
&gt; on weekends and sometimes every other weekend.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband went to Minneapolis four and a half years ago, for a six month <br/>
contract.  The pay was great, and the contract included airfare for me and <br/>
the kids to visit him every three months, and he could come home once a <br/>
month.  (Or we could have moved out there, which we declined.)<br/>
<br/>
He worked his schedule so that his one visit home lasted ten to twelve days <br/>
each month, and the kids and I got to see a part of the country we wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have been to otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
The contract was extended a year.  We still didn&#39;t want to move, and we cut <br/>
down on our visits out there to save money (taxes on the airfare, and the <br/>
cost of wining and dining kids for a long weekend).  My husband lived in a <br/>
dinky apartment instead of the fancy one the per diem allowed for, and ate <br/>
cheap food instead of the restaurant food the per diem allowed for.   We all <br/>
talked on the phone lots.  He would have liked for us to move out there at <br/>
that point, but we had bought a new house, big and not expensive, and I <br/>
didn&#39;t want to lose this house.<br/>
<br/>
They extended it twice more, and finally I said &quot;Please come home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some things were rough when he got back, because he was frustrated with the <br/>
loss of income (he still had his job here, because they had been contracting <br/>
him out to the other company in Minneapolis) and it not being &quot;his house&quot; <br/>
(since we&#39;d been here so much more), but it&#39;s all sweet and good now.<br/>
<br/>
We could have all gone with him at the time, and maybe we should have.  But <br/>
it was a decision we agreed on for reasons we kept checking on, and it was <br/>
never intended to last forever.<br/>
<br/>
There were some serious benefits to us, and some risk, which we weathered.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846190208">&lt;&lt; FACT:  Husband chooses a job that takes him away from the family.  <br/>
Where you work is a choice. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Too simplified for most real life.<br/>
There are needs and requirements and priorities and if a wife isn&#39;t going to <br/>
follow her husband to every job anywhere (which isn&#39;t a totally unreasonable <br/>
suggestion, in general) then sometimes a husband (or a wife) is going to <br/>
leave for a while to get money.  It has always happened, throughout history.  <br/>
 At least now there are phones and e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
When I go to a homeschooling conference and somebody pays me to speak, I <br/>
leave my family.  (Sometimes I take Holly.)  I don&#39;t choose it without <br/>
discussing it.  I&#39;m gone four or five days sometimes.  If I got an offer to <br/>
teach for a week or two out of town for money and we needed money, I&#39;d <br/>
probably do it.  If it was close, I&#39;d take my kids, but Kirby wouldn&#39;t want <br/>
to go (and he has a job now too).<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t just say &quot;No, I will not leave my family.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Is leaving only if it&#39;s five days straight?  A month?  A year?<br/>
<br/>
If I stay home and indirectly from that fifteen or twenty other moms give up <br/>
on unschooling and put their kids back in school, wasn&#39;t the overall benefit <br/>
to society less because I stayed with my kids those two or four days?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It depends.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112858213">That is so amazing.  I have only recently been learning about and<br/>
convinced of unschooling.  It has really taught me a lot about all this. <br/>
I am learning how society in general has brainwashed us all into<br/>
believing that we have to be so secure with benefits, etc. and retirement<br/>
so that we lock ourselves into these job situations which do not make us<br/>
happy.  My husband works for himself and for years it has bothered me not<br/>
having &quot;security&quot;.  But because of the concepts of unschooling I am<br/>
unlearning these falsities.  (I work a job that allows me to be at home<br/>
with my kids and gives me benefits and retirement investments and<br/>
&quot;security&quot;, but I am thinking of quitting so I can just be happy and do<br/>
those things that make me happy.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-274801909">Amen to that!  Unfortunately, most of us believe in God with our mouths<br/>
but not with our actions.  I am speaking of myself, of course.  I have<br/>
found that most people see God through the glasses of their childhood<br/>
experiences with earthly fathers, who are not perfect, and respond to him<br/>
likewise.  Sanctification is the process in which we unlearn these false<br/>
assumptions and are transformed into the likeness of Christ who trusted<br/>
his Father God&#39;s love to the point of dying on a cross, for the joy to<br/>
come.  But this doesn&#39;t happen overnight, and sometimes, if we refuse to<br/>
change, it never happens.<br/>

life. Dawn made a comment, to the effect that our faith is weak because we<br/>
don&#39;t just step out and change. If you only knew the changes our family has<br/>
gone through in the past 6 years, you might be a little more compassionate.<br/>
I don&#39;t feel I need to share the details right now.At the time he made this<br/>
job choice, it was God leading him there. He was working two full time jobs<br/>
and never home except to sleep.This job allowed us to get away from an<br/>
oppressive living situation, to where we could make the good choices for our<br/>
family. It is in God&#39;s timing and I am trusting Him to the details.<br/>

choices are for temporary situations, and we don&#39;t have to feel trapped. <br/>

would love to have someone dispute how work is NOT a choice.  Most of <br/>
the things we do in life are based on the choices that we make.  <br/>
Whether they are beneficial to ourselves, our families, friends or <br/>
whoever, we may not know the answer to that till further down the <br/>
line.  However there are still choices.  Maybe the difference is <br/>
really about what&#39;s important to the individual family.  <br/>
Unfortunately the western culture has come to adore and admire money <br/>
more than anything.  Money is not the most important thing in our <br/>
family.  Being together is what&#39;s important for us.  For other people <br/>
maybe that&#39;s not the most important thing.  That&#39;s ok as well.  There <br/>
are so many alternative ways to make life work, bartering, trading <br/>
are just two of them. I believe I can set my life up the way I want <br/>
it (I&#39;m not using the you because others on the list may take <br/>
offense).  Hubby and I decided on what we wanted our dream life to <br/>
look like and then set about making it look that way.  There wasn&#39;t <br/>
any difficulty in the action part once we&#39;d made the decision of how <br/>
we wanted it to look.  Why does it have to be so complicated?<br/>

wouldn&#39;t have been together as happily and peacefully as we are here.<br/>

Some people are in the military.  They don&#39;t get the luxury of being with <br/>
their children (if they have children) until their service is through. I <br/>
don&#39;t fault that.<br/>
<br/>
There has never been a time and place in western civilization when people who <br/>
weren&#39;t peasants didn&#39;t have an option to go somewhere sometime for the <br/>
benefit of their families--sailors, soldiers, merchants, sometimes have to go <br/>
to work overnight or over-season.  It&#39;s nothing recent and immoral and <br/>
irresponsible.<br/>
<br/>
So what is that limit?  A weekend?  A year?<br/>

&gt; Where you work is a choice. &gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; Too simplified for most real life.<br/>

support a family and maintain insurance. He may not be<br/>
able to find another position that pay enough and<br/>
provide insurance.  I know some have written that they<br/>
left jobs and nearly went broke and now are better off<br/>
than ever. Great! Really! - But that doesn&#39;t always<br/>
happen. It&#39;s good to look for another position if he<br/>
wants to be home more, but IMO it would be wisest to<br/>
keep the job you&#39;ve got until you&#39;ve got another (if<br/>
you have the responsibility of supporting a family etc.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t say any such thing.... To have a family intact first before worrying <br/>
where the money is coming from is having faith.  To put jobs and money above <br/>
family is not faith. IMHO<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how much plainer or in English to say this.  It&#39;s still a <br/>
choice... There&#39;s no negative or positive, just a choice... Everyone makes <br/>
choices.... Why is that so difficult to comprehend?  <br/>

&gt; &gt; There wasn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; any difficulty in the action part once we&#39;d made the decision of how <br/>
&gt; &gt; we wanted it to look.  Why does it have to be so complicated?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It doesnt Dawn and it isn&#39;t  . . . unless we choose it to be. That&#39;s the <br/>
&gt; beauty of it all. . . we get to choose, and then choose again if we want to.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has absolutely nothing to do with job market. . . it is choice just as <br/>
Dawn said. . . we make choices every single day . . . we choose or our <br/>
husband chooses to work where they do, doing what they do. I was a single mom <br/>
unschooling for many years. I chose my job. . . by doing anything and <br/>
everything I could do so that I could have my daughter with me. I chose it. . <br/>
. . I could have chosen differently and put her in school, and that would <br/>
have been okay too, but I believe Dawn&#39;s message is we are not victims of the <br/>
economy or anything else. We make choices about who we are, and how we show <br/>
up in the world. <br/>
