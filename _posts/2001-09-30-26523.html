<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013632714">I&#39;m not sure what your asking exactly but maybe this is the <br/>
answer . . .<br/>
<br/>
we like taking the tests.  We like playing with the questions and <br/>
such.  We look at them like puzzle books.  Often, we don&#39;t even look <br/>
at the scoring part (or look as an after thought), we just check the <br/>
answers to see if we did them all right.  Or to see what the answers <br/>
are if we aren&#39;t sure of some.  <br/>
<br/>
But how could I be flattered by something I view as a game?  I&#39;m not <br/>
flattered by crossword puzzles either.  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what you are asking but I think the answer is no.  I am <br/>
not flattered by crossword puzzles, word and logic games or jigsaw <br/>
puzzles.  I put IQ tests in the same category.  We play with them but <br/>
sometimes don&#39;t even bother looking at the scoring system. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-297336063">Hey, I like taking tests.  They are fun and a challenge.  So, if someone<br/>
enjoys them, why not.  The kidlets love challenges too, though they are test<br/>
takers.  We all like puzzles and tests and challenges are like puzzles.<br/>
<br/>
Along those lines, a year ago the kidlets and I found a Saxon teacher&#39;s<br/>
edition (the one with all the answers) at a library sale for $1 and bought<br/>
it.  Then we went through the book and found all the errors and incorrect<br/>
answers and sent it into the company.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, better do a complete explanation so I don&#39;t have to answer questions<br/>
later.  We had been talking about how when I was in school I would bring<br/>
home math papers that said &quot;x&quot; number were wrong and I would sit down with<br/>
my dad to rework them (it was required) and we would find that my answers<br/>
were right.  I always got a ration of bs from the teacher because teacher&#39;s<br/>
books never lie, yeah right!<br/>
<br/>
So when we saw the book at the library sale, next to youngest kidlet<br/>
remembered the talk and said, &quot;hey, let&#39;s see how many are wrong.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-77089137">That&#39;s a good point, Diane. The folowing most likely<br/>
does ot apply to you.....<br/>
<br/>
However, I don&#39;t think it reflects good anything to<br/>
brag about one&#39;s self-administered &quot;IQ&quot; test scores. <br/>
To make reference to such scores at all (unless it<br/>
comes out crummy) is bragging. Sorta blunt, but, that<br/>
was my original point. It is similiar to saying &quot;I<br/>
looked in the mirror, and I look good. On a scale of 1<br/>
to 10, compared to other people, I rate a __.&quot; Just<br/>
not done. Tacky. &quot;I took a self-administered IQ test<br/>
and I got a really high score, compared to what most<br/>
people would probably make (ie Mensa level)&quot; THAT WAS<br/>
PARAPHRASED, NOT A QUOTE is just not nice.<br/>
<br/>
The test criteria are faulty.  The test setup is<br/>
faulty.  The whole idea of IQ is faulty. And the<br/>
comaparison stuff is faulty. <br/>
<br/>
Sharon, who scores quite high in stubborness and<br/>
ability to put foot in mouth quickly and in multiple<br/>
sequences. Those aren&#39;t gifts.  I practice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057716790">&lt;&lt;wrong crowd&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was Dan.  When I was fifteen, I skipped school, drank like a fish, smoked<br/>
pot, ran with drug dealers.  I also wrote award winning poetry, helped a<br/>
friend through a suicide scare, danced through school with very good grades<br/>
and learned how to be a good friend.  My dad was the local state trooper in<br/>
a very small town.  I know the temptation to &quot;put the fear of God&quot; into me<br/>
had to be strong.<br/>
<br/>
What my parents did was keep the communication open.  Yes, I would get<br/>
grounded (they never claimed to be NCP) but we would continue to laugh and<br/>
talk together.  My friends were always welcome at my home and were never met<br/>
at the door by parents gritting their teeth, trying to not be hostile.  My<br/>
parents worked to find something of value in my friends and something of<br/>
value in me.  To this day, we are good friends and I talk with them often.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I did some stuff that could have gotten me killed or jailed.  But that<br/>
stuff made me who I am today, a person I really like by the way.<br/>
