&lt;&lt;   Who in the world ever decided that all children should learn all the <br/>
same things at exactly the same age in exactly the same way???? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know two sets of homeschooled boy&girl twins, one here and one in <br/>
California.  They were born  the same day from the same two parents, and <br/>
neither pair learned at the same rate, nor liked the same things, nor have <br/>
the same goals.<br/>
