<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057743928">We have a small campground/theme park on the eastern shore of Maryland<br/>
called Frontier Town. When DH was a kid, his parents used to take him there<br/>
ontheir yearly trip to Ocean City. There is a stagecoach ride that gets<br/>
robbed. My DH, who was then about six, was handed to sack of money and told<br/>
by the stagecoach driver not to give it to anyone, no matter what may<br/>
happen. Suddenly from behind, bandit&#39;s come, shooting of their (cap) guns,<br/>
faces masked, hooting and hollering, (though probably not saying Yippie Kai<br/>
Yay) and stopped the stage coach. When they demanded the money and ordered<br/>
little Joey Cleaveland to hand it over.......<br/>
That skinny little arm shot out and practically put it into the robber&#39;s<br/>
saddlebags himself!<br/>
It&#39;s one of Joe&#39;s favorite childhood stories.<br/>
I can just imagine it all!<br/>
<br/>
Elissa, who will soon be singing<br/>
Yippee - Kai - Yay!<br/>

&gt;being a cow poke, can can girl, and sometimes outlaw, and she said<br/>

&gt;it.  She&#39;s not sure.<br/>
&gt;Oh wait, she said in the song, it&#39;s &quot;yippee kai yi yay, get along<br/>
&gt;little doggie, it&#39;s your misfortune and not my own....&quot;or something<br/>
&gt;like that.  But to just yell it out, &quot;Yippee Kai Yay&quot;, is appropriate.<br/>
&gt;Oh this is getting funny, she just said, &quot;hey guess where I learned<br/>
&gt;that song&quot; and I said &quot;Frontier Town&quot; and she said, &quot;nope, Hey<br/>
&gt;Arnold&quot;.  Now she&#39;s singing it!<br/>
&gt;Anyway,  Have fun in New Mexico!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-237174850">Hey!  That&#39;s the one!<br/>
I grew up going to FTT every summer.  My father is a native Ocean <br/>
City boy.  My dh has worked there since he was 18, and still does <br/>
shows once a week or so, in the summer.  He&#39;s actually the voice on a <br/>
lot of the tapes for the shows (they re-did them last year) and he is <br/>
the guy you here in the message when you get put on hold, for the <br/>
camp ground. <br/>
Are you close to O.C.?<br/>
