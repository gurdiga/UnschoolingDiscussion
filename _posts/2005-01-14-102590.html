<div id="ygrps-yiv-247707203">Hey, all,<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;ve been a couple of posts returned for asking for local contacts, and  <br/>
another about local business went quite off topic.  Here are some ways you  <br/>
might find unschoolers local to you:<br/>
 <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/1078/1078.html_">http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/1078/1078.html_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/1078/1078.html)">http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/1078/1078.html)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
U.S. States up top, other nations and regions lower down.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
put in unschooling and your state <br/>
and if that nets you nothing, try homeschooling and your state.<br/>
The list might have open archives and you can scan, or you could join and  <br/>
ask there whether they know of unschoolers.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
If this list is used to make local contacts, those who want to discuss the  <br/>
philosophy and practice of unschooling might get bored and wander away, or <br/>
write  and say they only left the list because the volume of mail was too high (as <br/>
 people pretty regularly do).<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be unfriendly, just trying to keep this list more useful  <br/>
and also figuring there are more efficient ways to find locals than on an  <br/>
international list.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
 <br/>
Sandra<br/>
