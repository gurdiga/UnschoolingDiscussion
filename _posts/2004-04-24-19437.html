&lt;&lt; Also, until he has friends to do things with, you can do things with him.<br/>
 You can be his companion in reading and drawing and play.  Ask him to<br/>
show you how to draw Japanese style animated characters.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me to direct anyone who hasn&#39;t seen it to a very funny piece of <br/>
online animated art.   It&#39;s in Strongbad&#39;s e-mail, at homestarrunner.com.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s &quot;Japanese Cartoon.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And if your interest in fantasy art goes beyond anime, be sure to look at <br/>
&quot;Dragon&quot; (which is the original home of &quot;Trogdor,&quot; a character it seems most <br/>
teens know about).<br/>

<br/>
For anyone who doesn&#39;t go today from these links but thinks about it later, <br/>
go to <br/>
homestarrunner.com  (home star runner, all stuck together) and along the <br/>
bottom, near the right, click <br/>
sb emails<br/>
which is strongbad&#39;s e-mail<br/>
<br/>
Go down to Japanese cartoon<br/>
and<br/>
dragon<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re all funny, but some are funnier after you figure out who his friends <br/>
and neighbors are (as with any cartoon character).<br/>
<br/>
After each bit is done, try clicking around on things, because most of them, <br/>
especially the new ones, have a bonus bit after the main e-mail is done.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086098008">Someone mentioned homestarrunner a couple of months ago on one of these<br/>
lists, and Rowan (who&#39;s 7) goes there every day now.  She does a great<br/>
imitation of Homestar, and a pretty good one of Marzipan. Lots of little<br/>
phrases from that site have become part of our family language (&quot;I think I&#39;m<br/>
a cool guy...&quot;, &quot;I concur&quot;). Soooooo many things have come up from the<br/>
history of video games to how to make marzipan.  The humor is multi-leveled<br/>
and just so funny.  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-370850779">OMG!  That was great!  Thank you Sandra.  Alexander is sound asleep right now.  I can not wait until he wakes up tomorrow to show him this.  <br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
