I&#39;m really behind again (I should have known better than to move away from <br/>
the computer for an hour!) but here&#39;s my 3 cents worth.<br/>
I have really become interested in Jackie Chan movies. The fight scenes <br/>
(which ususally involve him trying to get away rather than beat everyone up) are <br/>
beautifully choreographed. It&#39;s kinda like watching a ballet, although with <br/>
fists. LOL The latest one I&#39;ve seen is called The Accidental Spy and there is a <br/>
long scene where he is fighting off about 20 bad guys, while running through the <br/>
streets of Istanbul. <br/>
NAKED.<br/>
There is no frontal nudity, but lots of Tushie shots!! The scene is about 4 <br/>
minutes long and it was amazing to me.<br/>
No blood, no guts, but his bum? All glory.<br/>

If you get the HBO stable of channels, keep a look out for a documentary<br/>
titled &quot;Jackie Chan: My Stunts&quot; in which he talks about, well, his stunts.<br/>
There is a lot of behind the scenes stuff both on his sets and at his<br/>
workshop/dojo where his whole team trains and he works out his creative<br/>
planning. Lots about his philosophy about entertainment and humor, and other<br/>
stuff of immense interest to me because I am writing a Martial Arts Action<br/>
script at the moment. He is a in hero Hong Kong.<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting to compare him and Bruce Lee, the documentary of whose<br/>
movie work/philosophy/life is titled, &quot;Bruce Lee: A Warrior&#39;s Journey&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
When you see J.C.&#39;s team doing those spinning horizontally in the air stunts<br/>
you know it is fully them and their muscles - not wires. He can run up walls<br/>
without wires too.<br/>

I hope it makes it over here (Australia). My kids LOVE Jackie Chan, nearly<br/>
as much as my dh. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

How cool Robyn!!! My dh loves martial arts movies, he must have seen nearly<br/>
all of them. Even the really bad ones. I used to try to hide the TV guide<br/>
from him  because the thought of having to sit through another cheesy B<br/>
grade martial arts movie was all too much for me. Nine years later I find<br/>
myself jumping for joy when a new Jet Li movie comes out and I sit through<br/>
Bruce Lee movies for the awesome fight scenes and giggle over the awful<br/>
dubbing which has old Chinese men talking like American gangsters. And don&#39;t<br/>
get me started on Kill Bill. Mark&#39;s idea of heaven--martial arts Tarantino<br/>
style.<br/>

If anyone knows what movie this is, we really want to find it.   <br/>
<br/>
Years ago there was a Saturday afternoon TV presentation of martial arts <br/>
movies called &quot;Just for Kicks Theatre&quot; and one movie we saw was set in the old <br/>
American west, but not made there, except (I think) for a scene of one of the <br/>
actors sitting on the rim of the Grand Canyon.   And so like Power Ranger&#39;s <br/>
action sequences, the flora would be all very foreign willowy stuff we don&#39;t have <br/>
here, and trees I&#39;ve never seen.<br/>
<br/>
They had built for their sets two wild-west bars and a log cabin.   The log <br/>
cabin looked great from the outside.  Big porch, nice roof, good job.  Like <br/>
they learned about log cabins watching Bonanza.   On the inside they had it <br/>
furnished like the 1950&#39;s, like they learned about American houses watching Leave <br/>
it to Beaver.  Not lots of furniture, just a stuffed living room chair, a <br/>
little table and an electric lamp, I think.  I&#39;d really like to see it again <br/>
because that day I was just in shock.<br/>
<br/>
One of the bars had its name on the wall in rope, nailed into &quot;Saloon&quot; maybe <br/>
or some word that looked good in cursive.    The other one had river rocks <br/>
glued to the wooden wall.   I don&#39;t know what they were to have had, in Arizona <br/>
in 1870 or whenever, that would have glued one-pound rocks to vertical wood.  I <br/>
need to see it again!<br/>
<br/>
One of the lines in the dubbed dialog was &quot;I&#39;m sleeping with my grandfather.&quot; <br/>
  It&#39;s an idiom they might&#39;ve avoided.  The question was &quot;Where have you been <br/>
staying?&quot; I think.  It&#39;s been so long.<br/>
<br/>
Oh--the log cabin, from the inside, besides the furniture with the flat wall <br/>
behind it (forgot that, there was an inside wall which is no crime by itself, <br/>
but I  think it was drywall with wallpaper, which still is feasible but way <br/>
unlikely), when they turned and the camera was toward the outside wall, they had <br/>
not chinked the logs.  You could see daylight through al the spaces between <br/>
logs.<br/>
<br/>
Where logs are plentiful and people have some skill with an axe and they have <br/>
time, log cabins are build with the wood touching, with the top log grooved <br/>
to fit over the roundness of the log below.  But out here where logs are NOT so <br/>
plentiful, it wasn&#39;t too unusual to go for height, and fill in the cracks <br/>
with clay.  There are still barns around New Mexico built that way (little sheds, <br/>
more like, abandoned here and there along little state roads).    <br/>
<br/>
But these guys didn&#39;t know that, so their logs had  no fill.   So their big <br/>
nice house was constructed more like a picnic shelter in a national park.<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s familiar to anyone, I&#39;d love to just buy a copy.   It&#39;s possibly <br/>
only on real-big movie, and not on video or DVD, I suppose.  Maybe I could <br/>
inquire at the local TV station, which might&#39;ve owned a copy and still, maybe.  <br/>
That was in the early 80&#39;s, I think, that we saw it and it was probably 60&#39;s or <br/>
70&#39;s itself.<br/>
