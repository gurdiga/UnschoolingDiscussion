<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917567356"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I am not sure why people say that they can have unrestricted TV in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>their house *and* also find the time to do all the other things they<br/>
want to do with their kids.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why&quot; I say it? Well I say it because it&#39;s true, of course. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Unrestricted just means that my kids have a choice to watch or not. Casey <br/>
(9) had a friend sleepover last night. They have the choice to watch TV or <br/>
not. This morning they chose to finish a movie they got from the library <br/>
last night and then they turned it off. They spent some time painting each <br/>
other&#39;s nails and now they&#39;re off playing. Later we&#39;re all going to the <br/>
Children&#39;s Museum and maybe the park.<br/>
<br/>
Conor (13) is choosing to sleep in as he does most mornings. That&#39;s because <br/>
he&#39;s usually up late listening to books. (I will say that we do ask him to <br/>
turn off the TV and computer after midnight as it keeps my dh awake.) He&#39;ll <br/>
probably get up and either go on the computer or watch a TV show before we <br/>
go to the Children&#39;s Museum where he will be volunteering. Later he&#39;ll go <br/>
bowling with his dad and friends. He has the choice to watch TV all day if <br/>
he wants. He thinks these other activities are better today. It&#39;s his <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I say, &quot;Bravo!&quot; if you can do that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you. But it&#39;s not me doing anything but keeping life interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392531251"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I do think television is addictive-- our physiology has no way of dealing <br/>
&gt;&gt;with it, because it is so different than anything in nature, and believe <br/>
&gt;&gt;it or not, we have evolved over millenia to be part of nature. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This sounds good but doesn&#39;t make clean sense to me.    I hope others will <br/>
&gt;comment...&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I would guess a lot of modern conveniences have removed us from nature <br/>
more than the recent invention of TV. Houses keep us from sleeping under the <br/>
stars, indoor plumbing keeps us from peeing on trees or digging outhouses, <br/>
heating systems keep us from huddling together by the fire at night, the <br/>
electric light keeps us up past sundown when all diurnal animals are <br/>
sleeping, refridgeration keeps us from going out to gather our food daily, <br/>
etc. Are we addicted to these things or have we learned to use them for our <br/>
benefit?<br/>
<br/>
As far as our physiology being able to adapt, I would say that man has done <br/>
nothing but adapt up until now. Why would this little invention be any <br/>
different?<br/>
