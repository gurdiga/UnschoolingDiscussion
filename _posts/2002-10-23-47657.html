 Well, I guess that you would need to know Kyle. He has been sitting on<br/>
 counters since he was around 18 months. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jalen too.<br/>
He is often found in the sink (20months now) or &quot;helping&quot; me with doing <br/>
dishes, since water play is a fave activity.<br/>
He is also very, very interested in watching us cook and being involved.<br/>
Sierra has been cutting up food and cooking since toddler age.<br/>
At five, she is quite proficient in the kitchen and rarely asks for help <br/>
anymore, except when it comes to items requiring the stove.<br/>
She can microwave a mean bag of popcorn!! :)<br/>
