<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999769884">My boys spent the weekend with their grandmother (my MIL) and were happy to <br/>
go, as she was to have them.  However, from what she told us in phone calls <br/>
over the weekend and from conversations with her and with the kids when we <br/>
got back we realized how angry she is feeling about how much freedom the <br/>
kids have been given since starting unschooling in April.  This was the <br/>
most time she has spent with them since unschooling.   She had no problem <br/>
with my 6yo because he is so self-sufficient and loves to play outdoors on <br/>
the farm by himself and happily helps her with her chickens.  But our 3yo <br/>
asked for food all day long and had lots of puzzles and coloring books and <br/>
papers, toys, etc. out all over her floor.  Apparently he wouldn&#39;t just <br/>
clean it all up when she asked (he is used to me cleaning with him) and he <br/>
went into a shaking rage.  I have never seen him do anything this <br/>
intense.  He has gotten angry of course but nothing like she described.  He <br/>
didn&#39;t tell us that he had a bad time or anything but it is clear that they <br/>
are frustrated with each other.  She also doesn&#39;t understand why we don&#39;t <br/>
make them say &quot;please&quot; or &quot;thankyou&quot; before we give them something.  We <br/>
model it and remind them ocassionally.<br/>
<br/>
We are having her over for dinner tonight to talk to her about our <br/>
parenting principles; after the kids are asleep.  I want to tell her that <br/>
the main thing I have learned here is to treat the children with respect <br/>
and to do away with all authoritarian parenting.  They make their own <br/>
choices.  We do talk about acting respectfully all the time and point out <br/>
when they are not respectful.  I just don&#39;t know how much consistent <br/>
respect she can expect from  the 3yo (or 6yo) if she is talking down to him <br/>
or with anger.  How to tell her this, without just putting her on the <br/>
defensive?  We really want her to get it.  She is a big part of their lives <br/>
and may be alone with them for a week (unless this situation doesn&#39;t <br/>
change) when dh and I go to my brother&#39;s wedding in Australia.  Thankyou in <br/>
advance for any ideas.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  We do talk about acting respectfully all the time and point out <br/>
when they are not respectful. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Respectful&quot; is too vague a concept for a three year old, so I hope you&#39;re <br/>
not using that term.   It might be too difficult a concept for an eight year old.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think telling a kid that saying please and thank you will open a lot <br/>
of doors is in any way a bad thing.  I don&#39;t force my kids to say those <br/>
things, but I never needed to force them.  If you have kids who have come suddenly <br/>
to unschooling ideas, I don&#39;t think it wouldn&#39;t hurt to make a deal with them <br/>
that they do need to act in ways that make others more comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s even &#39;respect.&#39;  Sometimes you should say &quot;please&quot; even <br/>
more surely to people you don&#39;t much respect, because you&#39;re less likely to get <br/>
their cooperation without it.  <br/>
<br/>
When one of my kids is courteous, it makes him a better person right then and <br/>
there, regardless of the response or attitude of the person to whom he was <br/>
being courteous.   So for that reason I don&#39;t see it as &quot;being respectful,&quot; but <br/>
as being the best person he can be.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I want to tell her that <br/>
the main thing I have learned here is to treat the children with respect <br/>
and to do away with all authoritarian parenting. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you telling her &quot;there&#39;s this website, and they said...&quot;?<br/>
I think that&#39;s a bad idea.<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, there are many more sources for these ideas than this website, <br/>
and if you  pin it all on one online source it won&#39;t increase her confidence.<br/>
<br/>
I think if I were explaining this to someone skeptical, I would say &quot;Lots of <br/>
families are...&quot; and present the ideas that way.  I eased into it through La <br/>
Leche L and my in-laws had met lots of those kids, so I had it easier.   <br/>
<br/>
For many people saying &quot;There&#39;s this website...&quot; is like saying &quot;There&#39;s this <br/>
gypsy fortune-teller...&quot; or &quot;I had a dream...&quot; because many see the internet <br/>
as smoke, mirrors, and wispy perverts.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She is a big part of their lives <br/>
and may be alone with them for a week (unless this situation doesn&#39;t <br/>
change) when dh and I go to my brother&#39;s wedding in Australia. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How soon is that?<br/>
<br/>
Can you borrow money to take the kids with you?<br/>
How sad for them to be away from you for a week AND miss a trip to Australia!<br/>
<br/>
And how sad if that week with their grandmother creates so much unhappiness <br/>
that the therapy to undo it would cost as much as two fares to Australia, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-769392881">Perhaps it would help to reframe what the source of the distress<br/>
is; you said you know that she is angry and that you know the<br/>
source of the anger is &quot;how much freedom the kids have been<br/>
given since starting unschooling in April&quot;.   You may be exactly<br/>
right, but the odds are always low when we say we know what<br/>
someone else feels and why.  We tend to assume that others will<br/>
oppose unschooling, which means we yell before we are hit.<br/>
<br/>
With a 3 y.o., grandmother isn&#39;t really thinking much about how<br/>
you are schooling him, but how you are raising him.  There are 2<br/>
bits it might be helpful to mull over.  First it has been a<br/>
while since she has had a 3 y.o. to take care of for a weekend,<br/>
probably at least 20 years.  We forget pretty fast just how<br/>
dependent and messy they are.  Maybe eliciting from her some<br/>
funny stories of scrapes your husband got into as a toddler will<br/>
help her remember that each stage has its own challenges.<br/>
<br/>
Second, as a parent with parents and a grandparent with<br/>
children, I know first hand, both directions, how deeply<br/>
unsettling it is to see different approaches being used to raise<br/>
kids.  Think of her saying &quot;I know that what I did was the very<br/>
best or I wouldn&#39;t have done it; because you are using a<br/>
different approach is rejecting my wisdom and harming my<br/>
grandkids to boot.&quot;  That isn&#39;t a true statement, but it is an<br/>
accurate assessment of a common interior voice.  If you can<br/>
speak to that voice, by pointing out differences in the<br/>
time/place you are versus she was and the differences in the<br/>
children you have from the children she had, you can quiet that<br/>
interior objection.<br/>

being &quot;the best person you can be&quot; vs. &quot;being respectful&quot; is a both easier <br/>
to understand and more important in life.  Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Too true!  I have been wanting to give her articles (yours! and others&#39;) to <br/>
read but she just mentioned to me last week that she thinks it is a mistake <br/>
to put much stock in what others write.  She seems to put a lot of stock in <br/>
her new age reading material but I am feeling it is the wrong week to give <br/>
her things to read!  I will talk about the kids I saw at the conference and <br/>
the Ga unschoolers who came to our farm (I wish she had spent more time <br/>
with them) and will talk about the changes we have experienced in our kids <br/>
since gradually changing the way we parent.  I know she has seen the <br/>
changes as well, in terms of their excitement about everything and how well <br/>
they get along.  She has been alone with them for a few hours and commented <br/>
about how intelligent they are and how much fun it was to learn yoga from <br/>
them or hear the latest dinosaur info. etc.  But now that there was a bad <br/>
day with Jesse I think all the blame is put on our parenting.  I guess I <br/>
want her to recognize, as I have had to lately, that our moods and style <br/>
(as the adult caretakers) have a huge bearing on how the children are going <br/>
to feel and act.  My MIL was feeling sick all weekend (wish we hadn&#39;t left <br/>
now but she insisted she was fine, until we returned!)  I think a lot of <br/>
what happened was about how she was feeling.  It is no fun to suddenly be <br/>
alone with kids when you have no energy and feel lousy.  I don&#39;t want ot <br/>
shame her just to ask her to understand why we take  time to explain things <br/>
to them and why it is O.K. with us if the little one makes a mess and then <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to clean it up.  I want a simple way of telling her.  But I&#39;m <br/>
thinking the only way she may understand is by having more of those <br/>
exciting fun days with them and letting go of her story about Jesse being <br/>
&quot;spoiled&#39;&quot; because of these few hard days.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The wedding is in Feb.  So we have 5 months.  We ahve bought the tix but <br/>
Nicolas may stay here and let me go alone.  He is very close to my brother <br/>
so we would prefer to bring the kids (that was our original plan) but the <br/>
cheapest tickets that time of year are ~$1600!! We are borrowing money just <br/>
for our tickets.  Also, my brother won&#39;t be living in Australia until about <br/>
6 mo after the wedding and we would rather bring them in a few years when <br/>
we can stay w/my bro., and for longer.  We definately want to bring them <br/>
there.  I agree we can&#39;t both go to this wedding if there is any <br/>
possibility of anger or resentment on MIL&#39;s part towards the kids.<br/>

together.  I want to communicate to her that we are attempting to trust our <br/>
kids to make their own decisions while giving them lots of attention and <br/>
gentle guidance while they make those decisions.  By guidance I mean (for <br/>
example) suggesting that it would be much more pleasant (and would get what <br/>
they want more) to ask for something nicely than to demand it.  This is <br/>
working, at home and with other friends.  I think her occasional <br/>
authoritarian voice (ykwim?) is what throws Jesse. That, and the way she <br/>
demands that he give her a kiss (we have tried to discourage this, but not <br/>
strongly enough).   She is a loving sweet woman but as you say, she is used <br/>
to a different approach.   We don&#39;t want to make her wrong but at the same <br/>
time we have to protect our children and want her to be able to spend time <br/>
with them alone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-673692628">The message I got from this was looking at things from both points of view.  <br/>
My first experience with a mother-in-law was such a nightmare that when I <br/>
decided to get remarried I had four criteria-no drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, or <br/>
living mother.  Now please don&#39;t have a cow, that was just my criteria.  Everyone <br/>
has what they will and will not live with.  Anyway, my husband is such a gem <br/>
I gave in and accepted another mother-in-law, just to have her top the last <br/>
one.  I was fortunate enough to have someone tell me what Sandra (I think) <br/>
said-you&#39;ve got to look at both sides and have compassion for the &quot;other&quot; side.  I <br/>
come out with my claws when it concerns my children, and sometimes, in my <br/>
younger years, I realize I hurt people unnecessarily because of that.  Tread <br/>
gently.  People&#39;s hearts are truly fragile, and words you use can last a lifetime.  <br/>
She does love them, or you wouldn&#39;t even consider leaving them with her when <br/>
you go to Australia.  And, one thing I keep telling myself, one day I will be <br/>
a grandmother, and I hope my daughter-in-law is more sensitive than I was in <br/>
the beginning.  But you know what &quot;they&quot; say-what goes around comes around.  I <br/>
feel your frustration.  Just be careful.  <br/>
<br/>
With great consideration,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044017482">Pam, I think I might suggest this, in a while.   She is very book-critical <br/>
right now.  But I think it&#39;s a stage.  I read _Unprocessed Child_ last <br/>
month and got a lot out of it but for her, some of it may be too radical <br/>
for her to accept the parts that we are doing (so far).  It would however <br/>
be a place from which to start a conversation...<br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t come tonight!   She had a rough afternoon and I really believed <br/>
her when she called and said that she had forgotten.  Interesting how the <br/>
kids were about her coming.  They were excited about it and really <br/>
disappointed when she didn&#39;t make it.  I think the few bad moments between <br/>
she and Jesse on Sunday were exaggerated by our nervousness about being <br/>
away from them (this was a trial run before Australia).    Also, a <br/>
wonderful young woman who works at the farm will be with them for most of <br/>
every day while we are in Australia.  She herself was home schooled (in a <br/>
different way) but really respects what we are doing and sees the boys a <br/>
lot at the farm.  We talked to her about the situation and she would be <br/>
happy to be with them rather than farm while we are gone.  They have a <br/>
great relationship.  So we will talk to MIL and see how the next visits <br/>
with her, and our talk goes before cancelling the ticket.   Starting with <br/>
tommorow night!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939515083">Just a couple of things.<br/>
<br/>
First I think a three year old is far too young to be spending a weekend <br/>
or even an overnight away from mom and dad, especially with someone, <br/>
despite relationship, who doesn&#39;t share and follow your parenting and <br/>
educational styles.  Lexie had her first sleep over at age four, Janene <br/>
at age five.   Both sleepovers took place with the idea I would and <br/>
could come get them at any time and with people who parent as we do.  <br/>
Lexie, at age 8, is just now ready for spending a week away from mom and <br/>
dad, and that she has done with another unschooling family who shares <br/>
most of our own beliefs and who raise their children pretty much the <br/>
same as we do. <br/>
<br/>
Also, each child is different.  I think Lexie could and would spend a <br/>
week with my parents, but I would not allow Janene to do this at this <br/>
time.  Part of it is age, part of it is personality.  Janene is just not <br/>
as likely to &quot;play the game&quot; with my parents as Lexie will, and this <br/>
would create stress and cause problems.  I can SO see Janene not <br/>
cleaning up and some people not getting that at age five she needs help. <br/>
<br/>
I should add that while my kids both have done sleep aways (Janene <br/>
having done maybe 2, Lexie having spent a few weeks away from me and a <br/>
lot of sleep overs at age 8) until a few months ago I had never spent a <br/>
night away from them.  I was stuck in Vegas with car problems and the <br/>
girls came back with my brother and spent the night and day away from <br/>
me.  It was interesting and OK.  I was lost without them, without <br/>
responsibility. But they were fine.  I really don&#39;t believe in parents <br/>
leaving their kids for weekends or longer until it is clear the kids are <br/>
ready and I don&#39;t think that happens at age three.  Gee at three my kids <br/>
were both still nursing.  They are still such babies and need mommy to <br/>
put them to bed.  Personally I&#39;d rather takea  vacation we all could <br/>
enjoy and afford than leave my little ones before they were ready, <br/>
especially with folks who may or may not respect our views on children. <br/>
<br/>
my 2cents.<br/>

&gt; happy to<br/>
&gt; go, as she was to have them.  However, from what she told us in phone <br/>
&gt; calls<br/>
&gt; over the weekend and from conversations with her and with the kids <br/>
&gt; when we<br/>
&gt; got back we realized how angry she is feeling about how much freedom the<br/>
&gt; kids have been given since starting unschooling in April.  This was the<br/>
&gt; most time she has spent with them since unschooling.   She had no problem<br/>
&gt; with my 6yo because he is so self-sufficient and loves to play <br/>
&gt; outdoors on<br/>
&gt; the farm by himself and happily helps her with her chickens.  But our 3yo<br/>
&gt; asked for food all day long and had lots of puzzles and coloring books <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; papers, toys, etc. out all over her floor.  Apparently he wouldn&#39;t just<br/>
&gt; clean it all up when she asked (he is used to me cleaning with him) <br/>
&gt; and he<br/>
&gt; went into a shaking rage.  I have never seen him do anything this<br/>
&gt; intense.  He has gotten angry of course but nothing like she <br/>
&gt; described.  He<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t tell us that he had a bad time or anything but it is clear that <br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; are frustrated with each other.  She also doesn&#39;t understand why we don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; make them say &quot;please&quot; or &quot;thankyou&quot; before we give them something.  We<br/>
&gt; model it and remind them ocassionally.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We are having her over for dinner tonight to talk to her about our<br/>
&gt; parenting principles; after the kids are asleep.  I want to tell her that<br/>
&gt; the main thing I have learned here is to treat the children with respect<br/>
&gt; and to do away with all authoritarian parenting.  They make their own<br/>
&gt; choices.  We do talk about acting respectfully all the time and point out<br/>
&gt; when they are not respectful.  I just don&#39;t know how much consistent<br/>
&gt; respect she can expect from  the 3yo (or 6yo) if she is talking down <br/>
&gt; to him<br/>
&gt; or with anger.  How to tell her this, without just putting her on the<br/>
&gt; defensive?  We really want her to get it.  She is a big part of their <br/>
&gt; lives<br/>
&gt; and may be alone with them for a week (unless this situation doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; change) when dh and I go to my brother&#39;s wedding in Australia.  <br/>
&gt; Thankyou in<br/>
&gt; advance for any ideas.<br/>

hug or kiss, and if he says no I say, &quot;That&#39;s alright, honey.  You don&#39;t have <br/>
to give a hug.&quot;  And move on.  As you explain it to your mil, you might point <br/>
out that one of the protections against sexual abuse is teaching a child that <br/>
they can say no about what happens to their own body, about who touches and <br/>
kisses them.<br/>
