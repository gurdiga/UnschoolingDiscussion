&gt; Me too, me too. English books are available in Japan way after they are in<br/>
&gt; bookstores in the U.S. I finally had to order Fiery Cross from<br/>
&gt; www.powells.com and now I&#39;m about halfway through it. Damn, it is GOOD!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Two more, at this point<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Haydon over here, my bliss would know no bounds.<br/>
