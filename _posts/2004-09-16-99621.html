&lt;&lt; Oooh - that&#39;s interesting. Was this limited to English? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We were just unschoolers talking about our own reading experiences and <br/>
oddities.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did hear a story and don&#39;t know the real source (if anyone knows I&#39;d love <br/>
to know) that a Roman-legionnaire writer in some early century of the <br/>
occupation of England noted in a diary or a letter home that the locals could read <br/>
without moving their lips.  That would seem to indicate that Latin was vocalized <br/>
back into language.  Or not. &lt;g&gt;  Maybe that guy just always moved his own lips <br/>
and had only been around people who did.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Can you give other examples in our language, from what you<br/>
heard in the workshop?-=-<br/>
<br/>
People talked about reading visually, and names being seen without being <br/>
pronounced.  I do that.  I don&#39;t always know the names of characters in books I&#39;m <br/>
reading.  While I&#39;m reading I do, but it&#39;s as though the name is the picture <br/>
of the character (not in a pictorial way, just in an identification way) but if <br/>
asked later &quot;What&#39;s his sister&#39;s name?&quot; I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m reading Nicholas <br/>
Nickleby, which has TONS of characters, and some I couldn&#39;t name to you, but if <br/>
I pick it up and start reading I will know all about each characters history <br/>
and interrelationships.   <br/>
<br/>
When I read music I don&#39;t think in note-names anymore.  Sometimes I need to <br/>
for a moment, if I&#39;m playing a C recorder (soprano or tenor) because I read for <br/>
F (alto).  But for piano, if I&#39;m playing I just see the music and my fingers <br/>
know what to do, without it passing through my conscious note-naming, <br/>
muttering part of my mind.  And stories from books can be that way too.<br/>
<br/>
Recipes can&#39;t.  I have to think pictures of measuring cups and ingredients <br/>
for recipes to make sense to me.  I read aloud to myself when I&#39;m making <br/>
something from scratch.  I mutter sometimes.  Because I get distracted, I think, and <br/>
because I don&#39;t remember numbers well, I will say &quot;1/2 cup of flour&quot; and then <br/>
I remember what I just said.<br/>
<br/>
Fiction and non-fiction can go straight to brain.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In Farsi, there are many words that are pronounced one way if you are <br/>
actually reading them from a book and a different way if you are just <br/>
having a conversation.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the word for &quot;rain&quot; is: &quot;baran.&quot; The first &quot;a&quot; is <br/>
pronounced like the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;mall.&quot; The second &quot;a&quot; is pronounced the <br/>
same way if you&#39;re reading, like in &quot;mall.&quot; So the word is &quot;ba-ran&quot; <br/>
with both vowels sounding like the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;mall.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But if you are just talking, the second &quot;a&quot; is pronounced like the &quot;u&quot; <br/>
in &quot;tune&quot; - ba-roon - sounds like balloon.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of words follow that pattern. Nan - bread - rhymes with lawn if <br/>
you&#39;re reading and it is &quot;noon&quot; if you&#39;re talking.<br/>

<br/>
Someone who is shy to post on the list maybe sent me that link, and we&#39;ve had <br/>
a little exchange on the side.  It doesn&#39;t specifically mention any early <br/>
Briton reading silently, but there are LOTS of clues to why that would be <br/>
remarkable and worth writing home about!<br/>
<br/>
MAYBE, if English has long been a read-silently language, then it&#39;s a <br/>
distinct and important advantage that we have all those weird spellings, because we <br/>
will read the words as themselves instead of worrying about their <br/>
pronunciations.   IF that is true (and I&#39;m just throwing an early guess that I never ever <br/>
considered before yesterday), then it&#39;s an advantage that we have too, to and <br/>
two  and similar oddities.   If English were made more phonetic, reading <br/>
silently might be more difficult.  And reading aloud &quot;cold&quot; might be more difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing some people were discussing on the side at the conference in <br/>
Chicago was the idea of what &quot;reading&quot; is.   If &quot;reading&quot; were *ONLY* causing <br/>
sounds to come out into the air again (phonetic read-aloud) then I myself could <br/>
read French and Spanish, no problem.   I could read aloud pretty well (I&#39;d <br/>
botch some verb tenses in Spanish, no doubt).  Problem is, I would only the <br/>
slightest idea what I was reading.  I know all the phonetic rules for reading <br/>
Spanish and French, but I&#39;m competent in neither.  So the answer to whether I would <br/>
be reading (as opposed to &quot;sounding out&quot;) can help me think about what I <br/>
think &quot;reading&quot; really is in young native-English-speaking &quot;readers.&quot;<br/>
