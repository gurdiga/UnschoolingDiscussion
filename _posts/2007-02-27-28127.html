Daylight Saving Time <br/>
  Beginning in 2007, daylight saving time (DST) will be extended in the United States . DST will start three weeks earlier on March 11, 2007, and end one week later on November 4, 2007. This results in a new DST period that is four weeks longer than previously observed. Unless certain updates are applied to your computer, it is possible that the time zone settings for your computer&#39;s system clock may be incorrect during this four week period. In particular, you must make sure that both your Windows operating system and your calendar programs are updated. <br/>
  Do I have to update my computer?  Home users: If you use Windows Vista or have Automatic Updates turned on, you may not be affected by the change in daylight saving time. If you want to confirm, follow the steps in the Daylight Saving Time Update Guide below. http://support. microsoft. com/gp/cp_ dst <br/>
