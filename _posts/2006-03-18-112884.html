I hire people. I read the resumes; I check the references. How would I react to the word &quot;unschooling&quot; on a resume? That applicant would be the first one sitting across from me for an interview, long before those with a public school diploma, GED, or private school diploma. <br/>
<br/>
Grown-up unschoolers are curious, hard working, and don&#39;t need to be babysat. They are willing to jump into any task or new learning experience without trepidition. They ask questions when needed. They look for answers to problems instead of waiting for others to guide them. Who wouldn&#39;t want a worker like this? And no, I don&#39;t hire people to work for a fast food restaurant; I hire people to work for a company that has a world-wide customer base and is dependant upon technology, engineering, and knowledge of global markets.<br/>
<br/>
I have also had the opportunity to meet many young people with GEDs and public school diplomas in an adult literacy program. They couldn&#39;t get jobs because they couldn&#39;t read well enough to fill out the applications. <br/>
<br/>
Give me an unschooler any day.<br/>

Crikey, that Carrie person is bit peeved isn&#39;t she?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty much impossible to sensibly answer someone who seems as<br/>
irrational as she does in her first comment. The blog poster is just<br/>
clueless, but she seems to be nuts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I went to her blog and she&#39;s very conservative and angry and  <br/>
defensive about lots of things.  It&#39;s not healthy for her.  It&#39;s not  <br/>
healthy for others to read.   She doesn&#39;t seem to have peace or joy  <br/>
and she doesn&#39;t want anyone else to have any either.<br/>
                Afterword to the following.  The fun details are for  <br/>
this list, not for a &quot;serious blog.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I left a post that might or might not go through.  I should&#39;ve cut it  <br/>
to show here, but basically I told about Kirby being offered a job  <br/>
when he turned 14 and Marty being offered a job when he was 15.  (I  <br/>
didn&#39;t say he had been offered a job too where Kirby worked, but he  <br/>
didn&#39;t want to work with Kirby, which was a decent decision to make;  <br/>
Kirby wouldn&#39;t have been as happy.)<br/>
<br/>
Each is on his second job now, having applied for jobs at job-change  <br/>
time.  Well...  Kirby applied for two and turned one down; both said  <br/>
yes.  One, at a video gaming shop said Yes PLEASE!  Now! but he said  <br/>
no.  I was disappointed and said so.  I said we had prepared him his  <br/>
whole LIFE to work in a video gaming store, and he wasn&#39;t fulfilling  <br/>
his potential.  But no, he didn&#39;t care what his parents thought he  <br/>
should do.  He went to work at a pizza place that required a uniform  <br/>
and a haircut, rather than at the cool place where his hair could&#39;ve  <br/>
been long and he could&#39;ve continued to wear gaming shirts as he had  <br/>
for years.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has twice been chatted up by the deli manager at the big  <br/>
grocery store where he works.  The first time she commented on how  <br/>
cheerful and happy he always seemed to be.  The next time it was  <br/>
about how fast and hard he worked.  He said last week she asked him  <br/>
how old he was.  He said 17 and her face fell.  She asked when he  <br/>
would be 18.  That&#39;s the minimum hire age for her department.   But  <br/>
Marty wants to go into the police academy when he&#39;s 21 (I didn&#39;t tell  <br/>
that at the anti-unschooling discussion) and is thinking of going to  <br/>
college first.  That&#39;s not about getting a job, though.  That&#39;s about  <br/>
Marty. &lt;g&gt;  And unschoolers just think the stories of their lives are  <br/>
all about THEM.  Heee HEEEEE.<br/>

  This sounds like my mother who has Borderline Personality Disorder (bpd).  She could be mentally ill and if she is, there probably no use in talking to her. Ignoring may be the best solution.<br/>
