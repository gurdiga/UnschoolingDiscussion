<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608758371">&quot;Am I being neglectful <br/>
to utilize this to read etc. to ds? We have no limits on the tv, but while I am<br/>
 <br/>
delighted to be reading etc. with ds, it feels funny to use tv for dd.We <br/>
didn&#39;t have much tv when ds was little.Any thoughts, opinions?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
ENJOY!!! WHat a fabulous solution to your challenge. I LOVE that Jalen enjoys tv and movies, it gives me time to focus on other things and he is content and entertained. AND, they&#39;re learning from it too...how cool. :)<br/>
