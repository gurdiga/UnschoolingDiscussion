<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323208081">Julie Thank you for this idea.  I&#39;m going to try it.  I&#39;m so afraid my ds<br/>
will hurt himself when he goes into one of his &quot;out of control&quot;.  I&#39;ve tried<br/>
holding him & talking to him softly but that takes so long.  I used to take<br/>
1-2 hours now 30-45 minutes.  But when the moment passes he&#39;s such a sweetie<br/>
& like he doesn&#39;t know it ever happened.  Later he&#39;ll tell me he&#39;s having a<br/>
really bad day.  I&#39;ve tried swats (through pants & only enough to feel) a<br/>
few times but that doesn&#39;t work at all so it&#39;s been dropped.  But your idea<br/>
of laying next to him & talking is worth a try.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-508778121">Susan,<br/>
<br/>
Does he have any favorite music or a really favorite story, one that he can<br/>
listen to over and over again??  We used music and reading to calm addicted<br/>
babies while we held them tight (actually swaddled them) and rocked them in<br/>
a rocking chair.  Based on this, it has been tried with extremely<br/>
hyper-sensitive children and works for them as well.<br/>
