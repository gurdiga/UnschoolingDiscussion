I went on the unschooling.com message board and asked the same question.  I think they are all recovering from the conference and I know Sandra is recovering from breaking her leg or ankle?  She just got out of the hospital.  Maybe you know this but thought I&#39;d clue you in if you didn&#39;t.<br/>
