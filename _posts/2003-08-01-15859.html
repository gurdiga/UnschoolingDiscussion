<div id="ygrps-yiv-675238432">I just want to say quickly...I came to list and don&#39;t remember reading a <br/>
description...as a newbie I was snotty to Sandra and then very <br/>
embarrassed about it but nobody asked me to go...so thank you.  <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to tell all of you what Aislinn said to me the other night.  I <br/>
asked her and she said I could tell you.  It was about 1:30 am which is <br/>
my time with &quot;only&quot; her because nobody else can stay up as late as the <br/>
two of us.  We were all cuddled up and she wanted to play a game of <br/>
&quot;What If.&quot;  And this was one of her&#39;s... &quot;What if wishes were like <br/>
presents from the Easter Bunny and you KNEW you were going to get what <br/>
you wanted if you really looked hard enough for it.&quot;  Then she said, <br/>
&quot;Well, I guess that&#39;s not really a &#39;what if&#39; because that&#39;s the way <br/>
things are already.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I thought that was pretty profound for a 7 yr old.  I hope she believes <br/>
that for the rest of her life.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943636586">I love how astute unschoolers are!  My Katie (10) told me her teenage brother was trying to walk/act cool in front of some girls at the mall.  She said he&#39;s just like the peacocks at the zoo shaking their tail feathers to attract the females.<br/>
 <br/>
She also said she&#39;s glad to have parents like me and her Daddy because her friend (who goes to school, parents divorced) &quot;doesn&#39;t have any self esteem, she just wants people to like her.&quot;<br/>
