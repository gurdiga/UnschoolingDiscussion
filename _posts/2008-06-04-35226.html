<div id="ygrps-yiv-623433827">I have a couple of ideas for the drops.  It might help if one child  <br/>
puts the drops in the other child, while you hold the other child&#39;s  <br/>
hand and speak soothingly.  It might be like a version of &quot;one  <br/>
divides and the other one chooses,&quot; because each child will want to  <br/>
do it the way he would like it done for him.<br/>
<br/>
A good way to get drops in the eyes is to turn the head so it&#39;s the  <br/>
nose that&#39;s flat and not the eye, put the eye drops in that little  <br/>
impression at the top of the nose, and then the child can hold his  <br/>
own eye open and turn his head just enough that the already-warmed  <br/>
eyedrops go gently into his eye.  that way he doesn&#39;t have to see the  <br/>
dropper or the bottle coming at all.  His eye can be closed when you  <br/>
release the drops and then when he opens it and turns, he sees  <br/>
nothing but you smiling at him!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069474005">Well if it is your own baby you could just drop it in the eye right  <br/>
from your breast.  If not, have the BF mom express it into a cup or  <br/>
container and then yes, a dropper would work great.  And I also want  <br/>
to mention that breastmilk is a live fluid, so make sure you know who  <br/>
and where it is coming from.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-777629762">One way to put eye drops in that kids often like better is to have them put their head back and close their eyes.  Then, they can, or you can, put the drop into the indentation beside the eye close to the nose.  Put the two or three drops needed in that eye and then they can, slowly, open their eyes, allowing the drop to go into their eye... they can control it, open the eye slowly, and it is a more respectful way for drops to to gin.  repeat in a few minutes for the other eye.<br/>
<br/>
Alexx has had six surgeries on her eyes, and eye drops on a regular basis, both for exams and also for infection and also before and after each surgery, and this is how we do it.  Her doctor taught us, and he said it was a more gentle way to get the drops in.  It&#39;s very scary to have your eyes open and the HUGE looking bottle coming up to your eye, it&#39;s very much a loss of control.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, breastmilk 3-4 x a day, 2-3 drops per eye, for 10-14 days, will also cure pink eye.  I did that with my husband when we didn&#39;t have insurance, years ago, and also with my own daughters... it also can help with stuffy noses, and, well lots of other things...  Of course, if you aren&#39;t breastfeeding or know of someone breast feeding... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804327128">I massage the eye with breast milk and I &quot;spray&quot; (!) the area every two hours and massage the nose as it is <br/>
all the same organs area linked.<br/>
I alternate with chamomille tea bags on the eye lid.<br/>
It is possible to heal an eye without forcing the eye to take the drop in.<br/>
The lid will filter and let enough<br/>
liquid in.<br/>
<br/>
My kids had severe conjonctivitis at a very young age and after treatment with the breastmilk I<br/>
healed all their other little wounds the same way.<br/>
It is amazing all the benefits without medication.<br/>
To this day, my children have never got need of werstern medicine.<br/>
<br/>
I used a bit of chinese remedy for improving the quantity of breast milk in time of need.<br/>

I recommend trusting mother nature.<br/>

&gt; Really? How do you use it like that? Not that I have a kid with pink eye right now but I never heard of that. Do you just use a dropper?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-225671899">-=-I recommend trusting mother nature.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not bad advice, as long as everyone remembers no one on this list is  <br/>
mother nature, and mother nature kills off everyone eventually.    <br/>
Mother nature was doing better at keeping the population down before  <br/>
people started figuring so many things out.  If world human- <br/>
population keeps doubling in every long lifetime, it might be time to  <br/>
think  mother nature has her own dangerous infection.<br/>
<br/>
If the eye irritation or infection is from normal everyday causes  <br/>
(dirt, a cold, bacteria) it should be will in a few days or a week  <br/>
whether you do anything or not.    Warm washcloths on the face with  <br/>
eyes closed feels great, but probably it&#39;s mostly the &quot;eyes closed&quot;  <br/>
part that feels great.<br/>
<br/>
If kids don&#39;t want drops, will they take showers or baths?  The steam  <br/>
might be soothing.  Bubbles wouldn&#39;t be, so I wouldn&#39;t do a bath with  <br/>
anything that would make it worse.  Baby shampoo or baby-wash,  <br/>
maybe.  Or just warm water.<br/>
