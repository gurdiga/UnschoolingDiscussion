<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162764762">I love the idea of giving the kids a budget.  I want my kids to be <br/>
able to have things they want, like dance lessons, toys, snacks, <br/>
etc.  We&#39;re in a situation though where if I were to add up the <br/>
money I spent on extras for the kids, most months it would be under <br/>
$5-$10.  I&#39;m frugal and tight because that&#39;s how we have to be.  <br/>
Occasionally, perhaps once a month, we splurge and order pizzas for <br/>
$11, or maybe every other month go to a movie.  I buy little <br/>
convenience food either, and what I do buy is like veggie burgers or <br/>
bread or cold cereal.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are little.  My oldest is not yet 5.  When she asks, which <br/>
she&#39;s doing more often, for things, I say, &quot;You can buy it with the <br/>
money in your piggy bank.&quot;  Only once has she wanted to, when we <br/>
were yard-saling one day.  I had given her a dollar to spend, and <br/>
asked if she wanted to bring extra; she pulled out 43 cents, and <br/>
spent it all at the first yard sale.  I reminded her there would be <br/>
other yard sales that day, but she finalized her purchase and spent <br/>
the day asking.  I&#39;m ok with saying &quot;no,&quot; because I know we don&#39;t <br/>
have it.  I was looking for specific items for our home and not <br/>
buying things for me or the kids, and I explained that to her, and <br/>
she started asking differently, &quot;Would you buy this for me because <br/>
you love me?&quot;  Again, a gentle no, a cuddle, love, move on. <br/>
<br/>
I feel badly.  I hate having to tell a child of 4 we can&#39;t afford <br/>
it, and explaining why.  I did work for a while when my second child <br/>
was only 4 months old, and she cried each night that I went to <br/>
work.  We talk about that.  I&#39;m starting a home business to make <br/>
extra, and we talk about that too.  DH is starting a new career as a <br/>
nurse, so things will get better soon.  He&#39;s just graduated and <br/>
starts his new job soon.  But now my mother, in front of my <br/>
daughter, likes to say things like &quot;Now that Dan&#39;s got a &quot;real job&quot; <br/>
you can send her to dance class.&quot;  I try to redirect the <br/>
conversation but have told my mother again and again that, no, <br/>
before dance classes we will first buy a house that better fits our <br/>
family since we&#39;ve outgrown our trailer and get some savings for <br/>
emergencies like car repair, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Do any of you deal with these issues?  Sometimes reading this list <br/>
and allowance figures of $50 or $60 a month I feel like we&#39;re the <br/>
only ones.  DH and I don&#39;t even have a disposable income for <br/>
ourselves of that much.  I know others have to struggle with it <br/>
too.  Do any of you have small children who&#39;ve found ways to make <br/>
their own income without having to spend money for startup, etc.?  <br/>
I&#39;d love to hear about it.  I want something she can do only when <br/>
she wants that can allow her to raise money for things between <br/>
holidays.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-290659850">Kristi you are NOT the only ones lol. I have 3 kids 12, 8 and almost  7. We<br/>
have little disposable income. I laughed at the  50 bucks a month. I don&#39;t<br/>
spend that much on ANY extras.  When we can afford it the kids get an<br/>
allowance. the equivilant of half thier age. So the 8 yo gets 4 dollars. <br/>
But it is  only MAYBE once a month that we can afford it.  We do go out to a<br/>
fast food place once a week. <br/>
I don&#39;t know how people do it.  We live on one income and one car.  I spend<br/>
MAYBE 200 dollars a year on ALL of our clothes and that includes shoes sock<br/>
and underwear. LOL  Our &quot;extras&quot; include bubble bath , chips  and the 2<br/>
letter of soda at walmart that is .50.  I WISH I could give them more money<br/>
but it is not possible. The kids do not always understand but it gets easier<br/>
as they get older. THey don&#39;t like it any less but they understand.  My 12<br/>
yo dd Wanted to color her hair so she saved her money and bought the hair<br/>
color.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t feel bad telling a 4 yo you can&#39;t afford it. From the time they were<br/>
babies I would say: &quot;mommy can&#39;t afford this now&quot; or &quot; We do not NEED this,<br/>
we just WANT it maybe next time we can get things we WANT but this time we<br/>
are getting things we NEED&quot;  I tried to start early letting them see the<br/>
difference between WANTS and NEEDS.  I do however let them look at anything<br/>
they want and even press all the buttons on the toys with demo buttons.  <br/>
<br/>
It is hard when the money is just not there.  Especially when you or the<br/>
child sees freinds or others getting a lot of stuff. OR even a large<br/>
allowance.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway you are not alone there are many of us out here in the same boat<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137573580">Kristi,<br/>
<br/>
I can totally relate to your situation.  I can&#39;t say I have any specific<br/>
advice, because I struggle with being able to afford what my children need<br/>
and want all the time, but I wanted you to know that you aren&#39;t the only<br/>
one.  My own children are young, also--the oldest is not yet 5, but my<br/>
stepdaughter who is with us for awhile until her mom returns from a study<br/>
abroad in Germany is 10.  She is really helpful and fun to have around, but<br/>
she eats so much!  I used to be able to serve leftovers for lunch the next<br/>
day--no more!  She eats as much and more often much more than I do.<br/>
Anyway, this has been difficult financially, and it&#39;s so frustrating when<br/>
you are trying to change and give the kids the freedom to eat what they want<br/>
when they want it, and they just eat it all, right away.  I really can&#39;t<br/>
afford this.  My 4 year old does this, in part, I think, because she watches<br/>
her older sister and figures, she better eat a bunch too, or she might not<br/>
get any.  Very frustrating.<br/>

We have not always been in the position to give this much allowance to our son.  Also, we only have one child.  Which I know makes a HUGE difference in the household budget.  If we had more than one child, we would not be giving so much allowance.  We have finally got ourselves where we can afford to do this, and I figured we were probably spending more than this a month on toys and video games.  Wanting to get it under control, hubby and I decided on an amount that we could now handle, and that would give him enough to buy what he really wanted.  Right now it works for us, but a year ago we would not have been able to afford it.  Time has just made our situation better for us.<br/>

They should do things to help because they are part of the family, not because <br/>
we pay them.  <br/>
<br/>
I am not saying they don&#39;t occasionally get a buck or two if they go out of <br/>
their way and really do something above and beyond.  There is, however, no <br/>
weekly/monthly allowance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess that&#39;s just part of being a parent, huh? The price tags get - <br/>
bigger, but we still have the same real-life constraints when they get <br/>
older - we can&#39;t do everything or buy everything that we&#39;d like, we <br/>
have to make choices.<br/>
<br/>
My 16 and 19 yo&#39;s want so MUCH to go see Miss Saigon at the Pantages <br/>
Theater in Hollywood - like this week. Prices are $40 to $65. I&#39;ve seen <br/>
it - saw the L.A. premier. They love the music. They don&#39;t have the <br/>
money - I just can&#39;t spring for it this week.  They understand better <br/>
than a 4 yo would.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve both bought quite a few cd&#39;s in the past month with their own <br/>
money - I have to remind myself that they HAD the money and spent it <br/>
already. If they&#39;d &quot;saved it for a rainy day&quot; they&#39;d have it now to get <br/>
tickets to this show.<br/>
<br/>
Still --- I think it is normal for parents to wish they could give <br/>
their kids everything. Especially when they&#39;re little and don&#39;t yet <br/>
really understand the constraints of income and time.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d be more inclined to give the allowance, just not tie it to chores or things to be done around the house.  Andy helps, because he&#39;s part of the family, lives here, and makes part of the mess, not because of money or things he&#39;s given.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633055711"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I would always let him know BEFORE we went into the store if that day was looking only or if he could buy something.  If there was a price limit on a buying day he also knew what it <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have always tried to just avoid being where things are for sale if we have no money to spend at all.  It&#39;s less painful.  If we were going to a big store or a mall for one purpose, kind of in and out, I would make that clear.  <br/>
<br/>
But to say in advance &quot;you can buy something&quot;...  what if they don&#39;t want anything they see, really, but they find something just because it was &quot;buy something&quot; time? <br/>
<br/>
So I would declare the &quot;just here for underwear&quot; days (or whatever) but otherwise didn&#39;t specify.  And as to price limit, if you see a most glorious thing that would make all your lives better and last for forty years, but it costs $20 and you&#39;ve already said &quot;We&#39;re only spending $10,&quot; the kids might resent the discrepancy.   <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes at a thrift store, yard sale or the fleamarket we find something wonderful.  A local-tradition table and three chairs, all hand-joined, no nails or even pegs.  $50.  I would have put back any and everything else we had to get that.    <br/>
<br/>
Flexibility in spending might have come from flexibility in pursuing other kinds of subjects and activities in life.  If we go to a museum just to see the Imax movie, but there&#39;s a new display the kids are excited about, I will rearrange life and schedules if I can to allow them a chance to see it.  <br/>
<br/>
Learning and spontaneity are higher priorities than budget and schedule for me.  Sometimes there ARE reasons people absolutely have to leave.  &quot;Because I said so&quot; has never been one of them for me.   &quot;Someone is waiting for us&quot; is prime for us.  If nobody is waiting for us, there is much flexibility.   &quot;Have no money whatsoever&quot; (and charge cards are past limit, and dad is fearful for cashflow, and the sewer needs redone, and Marty needs braces)--that&#39;s a reason NOT to buy some things, but it&#39;s not a reason not to buy something that will never come along again and is worth many times more than the price being asked.<br/>
<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t needy of stuff, and I&#39;m not sure of all the reasons for it, but because of that, we negotiate each request on its merits in the full context of need, interest, benefit, sharability (sometimes that&#39;s a cool aspect, if lots of other people can benefit too)...<br/>
<br/>
Flexibility and being open to special opportunities seems important to me.<br/>

Do any  of you have small children who&#39;ve found ways to make <br/>
their own income  without having to spend money for startup, etc.?  <br/>
I&#39;d love to hear  about it.  I want something she can do only when <br/>
she wants that can  allow her to raise money for things between <br/>
holidays.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My older two children had LOTS of jobs when they were younger.  One  was <br/>
delivering newspapers, not a daily newspaper but the weekly local  paper.  They <br/>
dropped them off, the kids had to fold them and stuff them  into baggies and <br/>
deliver them to the front porches of two hundred  townhouses/homes.  They got <br/>
paid three cents per paper.  They got paid  once a month.<br/>
 <br/>
They would put them in their wagon and pull them around the neighborhood  and <br/>
the next one over to deliver.  That was of course ten years ago and  would <br/>
depend on if you had houses close enough for this.  Or kids  determined.  They <br/>
did it in snow, rain, even and ice storm once.  THEY  felt it HAD to be done.<br/>
 <br/>
Mothers&#39; helper is also a good way for them to earn money.  Sometimes  <br/>
parents would not be quite sure if they were old enough at ten or eleven to  watch <br/>
their child so they would bring them to our house just for added  security.  <br/>
They usually made big bucks doing that.<br/>
 <br/>
When my older boy was about ten he started mowing neighbor&#39;s lawns,  <br/>
shoveling snow, etc.  He had a regular client list that he did on certain  days and <br/>
got quite a savings account from that.<br/>
 <br/>
A not so fun job but paid well was popper scooping yards.  My youngest  did <br/>
that, with regular customers and made about a hundred a week or more,  several <br/>
years ago.  People with fenced in yards that let their dogs do  their business <br/>
there often don&#39;t have time to clean it up for parties or to keep  the kids <br/>
or anyone from stepping in it.  He got twenty dollars a week per  dog per <br/>
house.  A teen that I knew a couple years ago took that idea and he  made a LOT of <br/>
money the summer before he headed off to college and had lots of  free time as <br/>
well.<br/>
 <br/>
Those are just some of the things I can think of right now that my children  <br/>
did.  The of course had the lemonade/koolaid stands in the summer for  &quot;quick&quot; <br/>
money at times too.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope these ideas help.<br/>

I try to  redirect the<br/>
conversation but have told my mother again and again that,  no,<br/>
before dance classes we will first buy a house that better fits  our<br/>
family since we&#39;ve outgrown our trailer and get some savings  for<br/>
emergencies like car repair, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know people that have nice houses.  Big houses, wonderful  houses.  They do <br/>
little with or for their children because they can&#39;t  afford it.  I live in <br/>
an old house, old neighborhood.  We surely could  have used more room when all <br/>
the children lived at home.<br/>
 <br/>
We stayed in our old, needs repairs/remolding house and spent the money on  <br/>
the things the kids wanted to do.<br/>
 <br/>
They are in our lives wholly for such a few years, I figure the house can  <br/>
wait, the savings can wait.  Dance lessons are important to some  children.  To <br/>
others a new leather baseball glove is important, important  today, not so <br/>
important some years or months from now when we might or might not  have savings <br/>
and a better house.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking back to when I was a kid and I think he&#39;s a lot <br/>
like me. Always wanting to look at catalogs, pick out the best of <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t really know how to respond to him. When we get a new Thomas <br/>

about how happy he is and will be. I am happier now that I&#39;m less <br/>
materialistic, but I didn&#39;t learn that until my 30&#39;s! <br/>
<br/>
There is a positive side, I know, to the relentless search for more, <br/>
for the best. And I know Mikey will learn math skills with no <br/>
problem...my parents sent me to the store when I was 5 or 6 and told <br/>
me I could buy a treat with the change. I bought the milk or <br/>
whatever, then went back and bought a big container of cookies and <br/>
came home with 1 cent!<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, I&#39;d love to hear perspectives on this. I sense that I&#39;m to <br/>
close to the situation and too worried to really think about it <br/>
objectively.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A spending limit was an &quot;ish&quot; thing.  $20ish or $10ish.  If he saw something and he really wanted it, be it a toy or something for everyone, he would ask about it, no matter what the cost was in relation to the limit.  Sometimes I could afford it, and sometimes it had to be put off for a couple of weeks or a month.    <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Have no money whatsoever&quot; (and charge cards are past limit, and dad is fearful for cashflow, and the sewer needs redone, and Marty needs braces)--that&#39;s a reason NOT to buy some things, but it&#39;s not a reason not to buy something that will never come along again and is worth many times more than the price being asked.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;I&#39;m broke or I&#39;m overdrawn,&quot; is something my Mom would say frequently as I was growing up.  It didn&#39;t mean either one.  It meant I have less than an extra $x,xxx stubbed off in the checking account.  <br/>
<br/>
Andy has heard his Gram say both of those statements.  It bothers him to hear it.  I&#39;ve explained it&#39;s not what *she* means.  But he knows that if he hears me say, &quot;I&#39;m broke,&quot; or whatever that&#39;s exactly what it means.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Looking days&quot; were broke days.  A spending limit and the finances needed to be watched.  &quot;Have no money whatsoever,&quot; and it wouldn&#39;t matter if it was a once in a lifetime thing that would never come along again, it would mean I had no money -- zip, zero, zilch, nada.  <br/>
<br/>
When money is available, it&#39;s for whatever he&#39;d like -- sometimes even when I think it&#39;s a bad purchase.  This is how he learned commercials aren&#39;t necessarily an accurate representation of the product.  Example:  The Clorox pen bleaching areas it didn&#39;t touch.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when it hasn&#39;t been readily available, I&#39;ve found it because he&#39;s wanted something really bad, or for a specific purpose. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-569162867">Another approach is to write down what he wants. I remember making a <br/>
wish list for Christmas: EVERYTHING the Sears catalog had that I <br/>
wanted was written down, with page number and item number. You know, <br/>
hundreds of items! Obviously, I did not receive everything on my <br/>
lists but writing it down made my desire more real and acknowledged. <br/>
This helped me to see the extent of my wishes and I could review it, <br/>
change my mind or decide something really was a high priority. And <br/>
worth waiting for. Basically, I do this now too. We are renovating <br/>
our house. I want everything (new roof, new heating/air, patio, new <br/>
kitchen counters, new floors)....but this is not possible all at <br/>
once. And I change my mind. I mark things off the list as something <br/>
more important to me comes up. So, this is a useful tool in <br/>
prioritizing our wants. This works the same when my 3 y/o wants to do <br/>
x and y and z all right NOW! We have/get to choose what is most <br/>
important. <br/>
<br/>
Often we have to wait for things we want....I get to model this all <br/>
the time. I tried to keep my wants non-verbalized, but I realized <br/>
that my child couldn&#39;t see me model waiting for things if I didn&#39;t <br/>
tell him how I wanted things too and why I was wanting to wait (what <br/>
I was doing/getting) instead.<br/>
<br/>
We also give our 3 y/o money of his own (not attached to any behavior <br/>
except that he is part of our family). When he wants something, I <br/>
explain why I do or don&#39;t want to buy it (plastic, limited use, <br/>
poorly made...) but he can buy anything he wants with his money. <br/>
Sometimes I buy things for him because I want to. Sometimes he saves <br/>
the money for later. We decide to start when he asked for a $250 drum <br/>
set. (he has a small, cheaper set already) He gets $5 a week. He has <br/>
saved a lot so far. He wants the drums. Most weeks, it is at the top <br/>
of his list.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest toys that I think look interesting. However, he frequently <br/>
says &quot;I don&#39;t want anything today&quot;. Anything that he does want to <br/>
touch or hold in the store I try to facilitate. This alone seems to <br/>
be the key for us though. Usually, he just wants to touch and see <br/>
things up close. Then I ask &quot;are you done holding it?&quot; and we put it <br/>
back. We go to the drum store and touch ALL of them, and touch all of <br/>
the guitars...everything. This outing alone is worth owning any one <br/>
thing from the store. We go several times a month, cheap fun.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a really good point.<br/>
One reason I love garage sales and flea markets so much is you CAN pick things up and mess with them.  At stores, sometimes the toys are in boxes, but still if the kid can turn the box over, look at the back, have someone read the contents or discuss what&#39;s good about it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ve seen parents with kids in toy stores and it&#39;s not like they&#39;re even there together.  The kid is all on his own, looking or not looking with no assistance. Maybe taking something home is his most likely way to really examine it, sometimes, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
But I do agree about touching things sometimes being the &quot;I want that&quot; originally intended.  &quot;I want to touch that&quot; or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes having a toy in the cart, and the kid getting to hold it a while, and really examine it, was enough for mine.  THey&#39;d be fine with putting it back, or putting it on a list or things they might want for birthday or Christmas.  And lots of times I&#39;ve said &quot;We can get it if you want to,&quot; but they&#39;ll say &quot;No, that&#39;s okay.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I think I&#39;ve been focusing on the money aspect and on the actual <br/>
buying, including saying &quot;hurry up and pick something&quot; usually <br/>
because Caroline is getting fussy. But maybe I could do something <br/>
differently, like instead of getting a toy while we&#39;re out shopping <br/>
for other things, Mikey and I could make a separate trip and spend <br/>
more time picking things out. <br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll start talking to Mikey about the different things you <br/>
could do with $5...buy 5 things at the dollar store, 1 small toy, a <br/>
present for someone else, save it to buy something bigger next time, <br/>
etc. He&#39;d probably be fine if I just handed him $5 a week, but I need <br/>
to work up to the hours of conversation about it!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah - I&#39;d forgotten about this. I used to do that a lot when the kids <br/>
were little enough to be in the cart. I&#39;d say, &quot;Do you want an &quot;in the <br/>
store toy?&quot;&quot; They would pick out something to hold in the store and <br/>
then we&#39;d put it back at the end of the trip.<br/>
<br/>
In the grocery store, my kids liked to play &quot;babies&quot; with bags of beans <br/>
or rice. They&#39;d cradle the bag and sing to it and pat it and pretend it <br/>
was their baby.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157312730">howdy everyone!<br/>
<br/>
if sandra allows, i&#39;d like y&#39;all&#39;s input.  we&#39;re planning to finish our basement within the next year.  it&#39;s about 1200 square feet of space.<br/>
<br/>
while i *definitely* do not believe in the school-at-home thing, and *definitely* plan to get our kids&#39; input, what i&#39;m looking for from y&#39;all would be the tried-and-true, it&#39;d-be-good-to-have, if-only-i-had kinda things.  (ie not specific suggestions, like a pottery wheel corner because someone&#39;s daughter/son like theirs -- i&#39;ll get specific input based on my kids and their interests, of course!)  any suggestions that would facilitiate our long-term unschooling approach is what i&#39;m looking for!<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve already figured out that we need lots of built-in storage space.  and that we need flexibility in the entire space.  and that we&#39;re not doing anything typical!  what i&#39;d really love is astrotuf floors, padded/paintable/staplable/pinable/chalkable/etc walls, and a gigantic drain in the middle of the floor so i can just hose-down whatever and whenever!  including the kids and myself!  lol!<br/>
<br/>
if this discussion needs to be off-list, then please email me directly at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ummhjm@...">ummhjm@...</a> .  and, as always, even when i&#39;m on the receiving end of change-how-you&#39;re-thinking advice, i thank y&#39;all in advance because i so, so appreciate it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-239817636">Thanks everyone for your input about this!  I&#39;ve decided to offer to <br/>
Morgaine that she can make things to sell on the website I&#39;m putting <br/>
up if she wants, and so far she&#39;s declined.  I&#39;ve started asking her <br/>
at the beginning of each outing if she wants to bring money from her <br/>
piggy bank, since I dislike always making her put off purchases, and <br/>
she usually says No, and is asking less often.  I&#39;m wondering if my <br/>
attitude about money is making her want to horde, but I&#39;m not sure <br/>
what to do about that.  I am extremely tight with our money, right <br/>
now we are paying off debt and hoping to sell our trailer and move <br/>
within three years (when baby will certainly be moving out of our <br/>
room and the three kids will be sharing a little bedroom).  They <br/>
could continue sharing a room, but I expect that by the age of 7 or <br/>
8 they&#39;ll want some more space of their own. <br/>
<br/>
As far as the comments from my Mom about dance, I should have been <br/>
more clear -- my Mom wants Morgaine to take dance.  As soon as she <br/>
was potty trained at 25 months, my mother enrolled her in dance.  <br/>
Orion loves to dance and also wants to do it, and my mother doesn&#39;t <br/>
think boys should dance, so will only pay for Morgaine.  I stopped <br/>
lessons just about the time baby was born, since Orion was crying <br/>
through them and I couldn&#39;t give him such complete attention with a <br/>
newborn, and told my mom that she&#39;d need to send them both if she <br/>
wanted to continue, or stop the lessons.  That&#39;s when she decided I <br/>
should pay for one child -- though Morgaine seems perfectly content <br/>
with what she calls &quot;homeschool dance class&quot; -- putting on music to <br/>
suit her mood and dancing at home for long stretches of time while I <br/>
and her dolls act as the audience.  I&#39;m just frustrated by my mother <br/>
trying to create a need -- both for dance lessons as well as other <br/>
things -- for something that isn&#39;t there, and saying in front of the <br/>
kids that now we can pay for it since Dan&#39;s getting a better job.  <br/>
The better job helps him not have to work 80 hour weeks to make ends <br/>
meet so he can be home to enjoy our family.  *Sigh*  Having parents <br/>
living nearby can be such a mixed blessing, much as we love them!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks again for the input and encouragement.  I really <br/>
appreciated it. <br/>
<br/>
Kristi <br/>
mama to Morgaine, 4.5, Orion, 2, and Isaac, 3.5 mo.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060961467">I pretty much did the same thing with my daughter.  I hate trying to say &quot;we don&#39;t have money for that&quot; etc...  or trying to explain it when I know she just doesn&#39;t get it.  She doesn&#39;t care that the electric bill needs paid, all she knew was that you hit the switch and get light...<br/>
 <br/>
I would try to accomodate some of her smaller requests when possible - i.e. bubbles, cheap puzzle or game, 50 cents for the silly gum/toy machines at the checkouts... stuff like that.  That way, I wasn&#39;t always saying &quot;no&quot;, and I wasn&#39;t saying &quot;yes&quot; to stuff we really couldn&#39;t afford.  <br/>
 <br/>
When we went to the store, we usually would head for the toy aisles first... I would tell DD that we were not buying any toys today, but she could pick out 1 or 2 to play with as we shopped, and that she&#39;d have to give them to the cashier when we left.  Not only did that help keep her occupied while I focused on getting the shopping done, but she would willingly give up the toy to the cashier as we left.  I think there was only one time that she started to fuss and I told her that if she fussed then she wouldn&#39;t get to play with a toy next time.  Worked for me - and of course I meant it... I found it very important to say what you mean and mean what you say...<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck<br/>

Another approach is to write down what he wants. I remember making a <br/>
wish list for Christmas: EVERYTHING the Sears catalog had that I <br/>
wanted was written down, with page number and item number. You know, <br/>
hundreds of items! Obviously, I did not receive everything on my <br/>
lists but writing it down made my desire more real and acknowledged. <br/>
This helped me to see the extent of my wishes and I could review it, <br/>
change my mind or decide something really was a high priority. And <br/>
worth waiting for. Basically, I do this now too. We are renovating <br/>
our house. I want everything (new roof, new heating/air, patio, new <br/>
kitchen counters, new floors)....but this is not possible all at <br/>
once. And I change my mind. I mark things off the list as something <br/>
more important to me comes up. So, this is a useful tool in <br/>
prioritizing our wants. This works the same when my 3 y/o wants to do <br/>
x and y and z all right NOW! We have/get to choose what is most <br/>
important. <br/>
<br/>
Often we have to wait for things we want....I get to model this all <br/>
the time. I tried to keep my wants non-verbalized, but I realized <br/>
that my child couldn&#39;t see me model waiting for things if I didn&#39;t <br/>
tell him how I wanted things too and why I was wanting to wait (what <br/>
I was doing/getting) instead.<br/>
<br/>
We also give our 3 y/o money of his own (not attached to any behavior <br/>
except that he is part of our family). When he wants something, I <br/>
explain why I do or don&#39;t want to buy it (plastic, limited use, <br/>
poorly made...) but he can buy anything he wants with his money. <br/>
Sometimes I buy things for him because I want to. Sometimes he saves <br/>
the money for later. We decide to start when he asked for a $250 drum <br/>
set. (he has a small, cheaper set already) He gets $5 a week. He has <br/>
saved a lot so far. He wants the drums. Most weeks, it is at the top <br/>
of his list.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest toys that I think look interesting. However, he frequently <br/>
says &quot;I don&#39;t want anything today&quot;. Anything that he does want to <br/>
touch or hold in the store I try to facilitate. This alone seems to <br/>
be the key for us though. Usually, he just wants to touch and see <br/>
things up close. Then I ask &quot;are you done holding it?&quot; and we put it <br/>
back. We go to the drum store and touch ALL of them, and touch all of <br/>
the guitars...everything. This outing alone is worth owning any one <br/>
thing from the store. We go several times a month, cheap fun.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

lots of ways.    We could talk about their day, or ideas, or about things at <br/>
the store, and slowing down to their pace and making being at the store as good <br/>
as (better, often) being at a park or museum made it soothing instead of <br/>
jittery, and enjoyable for all of us (or most, and the kid having the least fun <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Veering OT here, but I recently put this question to my husband (who worked<br/>
grocery for over 10 years). He said stores are annoyed if you take a frozen<br/>
item and ditch it in the bakery section (thereby spoiling the item) but it<br/>
is fine to ditch toys in the checkout. Stores understand that people with<br/>
happy kids shop longer and spend more money. If having an in-store toy makes<br/>
your child happy, they are generally pleased to accommodate you by<br/>
re-stocking the item.  The basic rule of thumb is - will the item still be<br/>
in sellable condition when they re-stock it? If yes, you are ethically in<br/>
the clear. If no (like when a toddler chews it up) you really ought to buy<br/>
it. Obviously it is extra-considerate to put it back where you found it, but<br/>
just so you know, there is no bad karma for leaving it with the checker -<br/>
and it&#39;s easier for the store than if you put it back in the wrong place.<br/>

 Consistency is often just an unwillingness to look at something from<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-805669996">I guess that does sound selfish and lazy.  I feel like a horrible person now!  Most times we do put the toys back, but sometimes we don&#39;t.  I meant no offense, and certainly have never meant to selfishly place a burden on any cashier.  I was a cashier at one time, and just saw it as part of my job and was glad to be of service to folks - it also gave me some time away from the register to reshelve things and learn the layout of the store so I could better direct people.  I guess I have been looking through the wrong glasses though...       <br/>
 <br/>
My daughter started walking at 6 months of age (walking - not cruising) - and pretty much hated being confined in a stroller or shopping cart.  Additionally, her fine motor skills were such that she could work buttons, buckles, snaps and ties better than even I could.  She is a regular Houdini at times.  She wanted to be up walking and running.  She is intense, active, and curious.  While that is good and I have encouraged it (and part of the reason I&#39;ve kept her from school so it would not be squashed), it can be dangerous in some situations - especially at such a young age.  <br/>
 <br/>
We have had and continue to have intense converstions while shopping or otherwise.  I used the toys as a tool to keep her from running off and hiding under racks, slipping down ailses, standing up in the cart and falling out, or from being snatched by someone.  I am human and one person and when you are looking on a shelf it can be quite easy for such a wee one to get away from you.  At least, in my experience it can be.  I am a full-time working single mom, and while shopping is necessary, it isn&#39;t something I like to spend a lot of time doing.  I already feel guilty that I am not home with my daughter, and so I like to spend our time differently - doing things she truly enjoys.  I make it as pleasant as possible, take time where needed, but since neither my daughter or I are the &quot;shopper&quot; types we don&#39;t spend much time in a store.  Her brain goes so fast and furious that she is easily bored, so I have used toys to occupy her.  The only exception is the material department at<br/>
 Wal-Mart where my daughter and I spend time selecting fabrics for her to sew with since that is a high interest to her.  <br/>
<br/>
Past tense &quot;found&quot; because it was something I &quot;found&quot; in the past - discovered, learned, realized...  I apparently was not clear that I was remarking on the part where the previous writer said someone said &quot;We are broke&quot; and meant &quot;I don&#39;t want to spend money on that&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think having the flexibility to do what seems best outweighs clinging to an artibitrary decision for the sake of &quot;consistency.&quot;   I consistently tried to be flexible and compassionate.

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Forgive me, I am unsure what you mean by all this.  I think I am misreading your comments, or perhaps it is because I did not provide clarity in my post for you.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have flexibility in plans, etc...  I am ADD... I was born with flexibility, and consistency is hardly used to describe my life... LOL.  Saying what you mean and meaning what you say is simply choosing words carefully.  i.e. my sister moved in with us for a short time and ran up a $300 phone bill.  I asked her to pay it.  She said &quot;I have no money - I&#39;m broke.&quot;  What she meant was &quot;I am planning on taking a two week vacation and treating my boyfriend to a trip to Chicago to see 2 concerts and spending my money there&quot; etc...  It&#39;s a big difference to say &quot;I have no money&quot; and &quot;I have allocated my money elsewhere&quot;...  Am I wrong?<br/>
 <br/>
As far as promises, I try not to say &quot;I promise&quot; unless I can be as sure as possible that I can fulfill those promises.  I also try not to say that we have certain activities planned, etc... because this is life.  Things happen, plans change, something better or more important can come up.  Like the time we planned on attending a big tea party, but I fell down the back steps and broke my arm - we spent all day at the ER instead of the tea party... or the time we planned to go to the drive-in but Bekka was beyond crabby an hour before we were to leave, ended up crawling in bed and falling asleep.  I thought it wiser to reschedule than to try to drag a sleeping child to a drive-in that she wouldn&#39;t enjoy or remember.  Also, I may plan yardwork, but an opportunity may come up to go tadpole hunting or bike riding, or Bekka would like to show me her new play... quite frankly, the yard can wait! (well... at least until the city is knocking on the door - gotta love neighbors)<br/>
 <br/>
I hope I have not come off with an attitude... I know this online communication can be a challenge, and I will try harder to clarify more in the future.  Thank you for your patience with me.  Also, if I have misunderstood or have skewed perceptions please tell me.  I appreciate it very much, as I am still learning, and I realize that I can be selfish and simply not pay attention to life or people around me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679375470"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;It&#39;s a big difference to say &quot;I have no money&quot; and &quot;I have allocated <br/>
&gt;my money elsewhere&quot;...  Am I wrong?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a large part of my problem with my daughter.  (And, probably <br/>
soon, my middle child as well, since he keeps on growing -- LOL!)  I <br/>
can&#39;t just say &quot;we can&#39;t afford that.&quot;  Instead, when she wants <br/>
something, I explain that it costs money and we don&#39;t have alot of <br/>
money.  -why? -well, Mommy quit her job so that .... -why do we need <br/>
money? -insert explanation with way too much info here. -I wish Daddy <br/>
could stay home too. -conversation about this. <br/>
<br/>
There are variants to this conversation, far too many to list, and <br/>
she understands our desire to get a house; the trailer park we live <br/>
in just made us get rid of some of our outdoor toys, she wants a pool <br/>
and some personal space that she&#39;s not sharing with her baby <br/>
brothers, etc.  But I just feel that I&#39;m immersing her in adult <br/>
concerns at a young age (4.5), and she&#39;s a very sensitive little <br/>
person; I&#39;m concerned that I may be transferring my general anxiety <br/>
about finances to her by being forthright and showing her how many <br/>
different bills we&#39;re paying right now.  If she has a few ready ways <br/>
to make money, though, I can skip this part of the conversation and <br/>
go to, &quot;I want xyz.&quot;  &quot;OK!  Let&#39;s make a plan to pay for it.&quot;  <br/>
Unfortunately Dan and I are pretty much stretched as far as we can <br/>
go, definitely past our comfort lines.  And it seems wrong to me <br/>
sometimes to suggest to a 4yo to make her own money tp meet her <br/>
wants, but I think it will give her the option to step outside our <br/>
tight, frugal lifestyle if she wants.  Physically, she gets what she <br/>
*needs,* but then I feel sometimes that she also *needs* certain <br/>
things to make her feel more comfortable inside this world (like a <br/>
child who wants brand name shoes even though second hand shoes do the <br/>
same physical job).  We&#39;ve already worked out a few ideas and we&#39;ll <br/>
see how they go!<br/>

My little neighbor girl is recently turned five.  She sometimes comes  and <br/>
wants to &quot;help&quot; me do stuff.  She pulls weeds with me in my flower  beds.  She <br/>
LOVES to run the vacuum (even though to me it seems bigger than  her!).  She <br/>
loves putting her hands in soapy water and washing  dishes.<br/>
 <br/>
She recently told me quite matter of factly that she is now &quot;grown&quot; and  does <br/>
ALL the cooking and cleaning at her house, she&#39;s even allowed to use a  <br/>
knife!  I had to laugh.  I was peeling potatoes and she wanted to do  it for me!<br/>
 <br/>
Of course at her house, those things aren&#39;t nearly as attractive to do as  at <br/>
my house.  Maybe because I have no other small children and I have  patience <br/>
and time to wait patiently while she does this &quot;work&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
I always send her home with a few dollars.  She feels very  proud.  If I know <br/>
she especially wants something, I usually pick it up for  her.  <br/>
 <br/>
I know some people think it&#39;s odd or unusual for a five year old to &quot;work&quot;  <br/>
but I think a lot of it is just being listened to and responding to her and  <br/>
enjoying her company that makes her want to do this so much.  I don&#39;t think  she <br/>
has a lot of interaction with her mother.  I do know one Grandmother is  very <br/>
hands on, but of course would never let a &quot;toddler&quot; do &quot;work&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe your daughter can find an adult lady to &quot;help out&quot; and  befriend.  It <br/>
could be beneficial in many ways to both of them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-243781498">Hello everyone.  I recently joined the group, and have been reading posts <br/>
eagerly for several weeks now.  My name is Emily and I am currently homeschooling <br/>
(leaning and learning more on unschooling) for some time now.  My children <br/>
are Joshua who&#39;s 8 (close to 9) and Stephanie who is 3 (close to 4).  Both bdays <br/>
are at the end of summer. <br/>
The latest topics on the list have had me very eager to respond, but being <br/>
that the custom and request is for new members to read for several weeks, I have <br/>
been biding my time.  <br/>
The more I read, however, the more I realize that my natural instincts in <br/>
parenting, since my son was born, truly matches much of what I&#39;ve learned about <br/>
unschooling families.  And, yet, I&#39;ve only recently learned of that <br/>
terminology.  It&#39;s great to realize I have not been alone in how I&#39;ve always felt most <br/>
comfortable in raising my children.  Meaning ... allowing them their freedom in <br/>
growing and learning, rather than restricting them simply because it&#39;s how <br/>
&quot;everyone else has been raised.&quot;  <br/>
I&#39;ve often been criticized, lectured, and sneered at for what I believe, but <br/>
rarely let it effect me.  But the funny thing is, many of the people who have <br/>
done this, eventually tell me that my children are considerably &quot;brighter,&quot; <br/>
and &quot;more socially well behaved&quot; than the majority of other kids they have come <br/>
across.  (Please note, I am quoting specific comments that I&#39;ve heard more <br/>
than once from people)<br/>
Anyway... I&#39;ve been wanting to comment myself, on the latest topic of <br/>
discussion here.  About allowances, spending money and such.  <br/>
My children are young, and often have the &quot;gimmes&quot; and &quot;I wants.&quot;  But coming <br/>
from a one income family we live on a tight budget.  From the time my son was <br/>
born, I&#39;ve always believed in being very honest and open with him and then my <br/>
daughter.  Especially about money and finances.  My parents always kept <br/>
income and finances some sort of sacred secret, and that left me in the dark once I <br/>
was adult and on my own.  Therefore, I&#39;ve had to learn as I go ... which was <br/>
difficult.  I didn&#39;t want the same for my kids ... but my honesty goes with <br/>
all topics, not just money.  Anyhow, what I find myself doing with my kids is <br/>
being honest, and allowing them to help me with bills and shopping, rather than <br/>
just saying &quot;bills need to be paid, so we have no extra money.&quot;  Every pay day <br/>
is &quot;running&quot; day for us.  And being that the kids are home with me, this <br/>
means they go with me to do this.  I find the fact that they must do the traveling <br/>
means their day is being effected and disrupted so instead them being bored, <br/>
and miserable, they become a part of the day and responsibilities.  And of <br/>
course, they love to be helpers, so I allow them to do just that. Being that my <br/>
daughter is only 3, she likes to help me make my daily lists.  She &#39;writes&#39; the <br/>
lists, and then tells me what&#39;s on them.  This may be for where we need to <br/>
go, and is also for the groceries.  I always try to keep mental note of what she <br/>
tells me is on there so that I can be sure to accommodate some of what she <br/>
puts.  Such as carrots and dip (her favorite) or brownies, or what type of juice <br/>
she wants.  This allows her to feel important and an active and appreciated <br/>
part of the family and decision making.  My son, being older helps me with the <br/>
math part of things a lot.  After going to the bank he&#39;ll keep a notebook and <br/>
pen with him.  He&#39;ll write down the money amount we are beginning with ... and <br/>
after each stop and bill paid, he&#39;ll subtract what we spent for me.  This <br/>
allows him to truly visualize and understand where the money goes, and why.  We <br/>
always discuss what&#39;s being paid, and why it&#39;s important and/or necessary for <br/>
each thing paid.  Such as, electric bill, or phone bill, or rent.  The last <br/>
stop we always make is the grocery store.  He already knows ahead of time what <br/>
amount of money is left for shopping, since he did the math along the way.  As <br/>
we shop with our list (Stephanie&#39;s in hand also) both kids will help choose the <br/>
items and put them in the cart.  Yes, we have a list, but the list may simply <br/>
say &quot;cereal,&quot; so they can pick which type they want.  Or it may say &quot;yogurt&quot; <br/>
so they can pick their favorite flavors.  This also allows them to feel <br/>
appreciated.  After all, they are human, and have likes, dislikes, and emotions <br/>
also!  I&#39;ve always resented those who demand children &quot;must eat what&#39;s made, like <br/>
it or not,&quot; or the comment &quot;it&#39;s what was made and you will sit there until <br/>
your plate is cleared.&quot;  I have NEVER expected such things from my kids, and <br/>
always shop keeping in mind what they do or do not like.  If they do not like <br/>
beef stew (which they don&#39;t), when I make it, I will always accommodate something <br/>
separate for them.  Well, my point is, I keep my kids, even the youngest, <br/>
involved.  I allow them to make their choices and give their input.  But I also <br/>
have them help me, so they gain an understanding of where the money goes.  So <br/>
there is never empty comments of &quot;we don&#39;t have the money.&quot;  My son especially <br/>
now has a very mature understanding of what &quot;bills need paying&quot; means.  He <br/>
sees, on paper, how the money dwindles down each week.  We discuss freely the <br/>
importance of what each bill paid is for.  He may not understand yet the <br/>
complications ... but he knows we cannot drive our car unless we pay to keep that <br/>
license plate on it and the car insurance paid.  &quot;What insurance?&quot; he asks.... I <br/>
keep it simple, I say, &quot;Insurance is so that if there is a car accident, the <br/>
insurance company helps pay for the expensive damages and/or doctor bills.&quot;  The <br/>
phone bill needs to be paid so that we can have the phone to keep in touch <br/>
with friends and family.  Cable bill ... well, you have your favorite shows, and <br/>
we have ours.  If I don&#39;t pay for the cable, we will not be able to watch <br/>
them. <br/>
I know I&#39;ve written SO much here, and I apologize if this is too long for <br/>
some to want to read.  But I just had one more comment I&#39;d like to make. <br/>
Someone made comment about using worldly comparisons to make kids <br/>
&quot;appreciate&quot; their lives.  This is something I would and have never done.  My thoughts on <br/>
this is that few people are better off than anyone else, because money and <br/>
material things do not buy happiness.  Perhaps people in 3rd world countries do <br/>
not have the modern technology America does.  But why on earth would that make <br/>
&quot;us&quot; better than them?  If it&#39;s all they&#39;ve known, and it&#39;s the only life <br/>
they&#39;ve lived, they may not know of, or resent our modernization&#39;s.  Of course, <br/>
without doubt, there is poverty and starvation over seas ... but ya know ... <br/>
there is PLENTY of that in America also.  We never compare, but we do help!  <br/>
THAT is something that makes my son come to me on his own and say, &quot;Mommy, I <br/>
really feel sad for them, we are lucky we have all our toys, clothes, food, etc.&quot; <br/>
We give to food shelters, donate old clothes and toys to abuse shelters, <br/>
homeless shelters, and things such as that.  My son will pack boxes and go through <br/>
his dresser and closet and toy boxes once a month to donate.  They go with me <br/>
to drop the things off.  Always a companion, never a &quot;tagalong.&quot;<br/>
Thanks for all who took the time to read this mini-novel. (hehehe) I look <br/>
forward to continuing reading, and perhaps making some new friends and confidants <br/>
here.  <br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
Emily<br/>
