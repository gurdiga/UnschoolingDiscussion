There&#39;s an entire thread (or two) on special needs/autism/aspergers<br/>
<br/>
Anne (AnneO) Ohman and Mary (Zenmomma) Gold and Lisa Bugg/Miriam have written <br/>
extensively about special needs and how UNschooling---the lifestyle---is the <br/>
best option for the child to be &quot;himself&quot; and not some form of being the <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there are definitely kids for whom unschooling works <br/>
differently. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d say that it doesn&#39;t work. My kid is <br/>
a &quot;special needs&quot; kid, having fairly severe SID (sensory integration <br/>
dysfunction), and there are a lot of things we&#39;ve worked with him on <br/>
to deal with that, but we&#39;ve tried to work within what he is <br/>
comfortable with, and talk with him about them so that nothing is <br/>
being done *to him*. For instance, while most kids just learn to do <br/>
simple motor skills like dress themselves, his motor planning is/was <br/>
so off that he just wasn&#39;t getting it. So, when he asks for help in <br/>
dressing, I give it to him, but I also explain what I&#39;m doing in <br/>
words so that he can process it and figure out how to translate that <br/>
into bodily action. For instance, I might say &quot;When you have to <br/>
balance to put on your jeans, you can sit on the edge of the bed or <br/>
bathtub.&quot; Before I mentioned that, he would literally try to stand <br/>
on one leg and then fall over, and he would just keep repeating <br/>
that, becoming frustrated that it didn&#39;t work. Is it <br/>
not &quot;unschooling&quot; that I have to give him more information to do a <br/>
task than most people need? My daughter just figures these things <br/>
out, my son seems to need to hear verbally how to do something. I <br/>
can&#39;t imagine withholding information from him that helps him.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, when we saw how many problems he was having in every day <br/>
life (like not being able to brush teeth, comb hair, go in places <br/>
that were too light or too noisy, walk on surfaces that were too <br/>
soft or too hard or too fuzzy, or whatever, wear almost any kind of <br/>
clothes or shoes, walk without tripping, sit on a chair without <br/>
falling off), we sat down and talked it over with him and suggested <br/>
going to OT (occupational therapy). We told him exactly what it was, <br/>
and how it might help him out. He really loved going to visit Molly, <br/>
his therapist, and play there. The therapy helped re-wire his brain <br/>
so that these things no longer bother him to the extreme that they <br/>
once did, allowing him to function in the world. <br/>
<br/>
I do think that parenting him has given me a much greater <br/>
appreciation for how incredibly differently kids can learn. I can <br/>
see how there might be a point at which unschooling wouldn&#39;t work. <br/>
Who among us can put ourselves in the shoes of the parent of a non-<br/>
verbal autistic kid and say with certainty what we would or would <br/>
not do? Would trying to reach a child like that with therapy be not <br/>
considered unschooling, if the child could not verbally or <br/>
nonverbally communicate or give consent? I don&#39;t know. I can only <br/>
say that unschooling has worked for myself in our situation - that <br/>
we&#39;ve found a way to honor the ways in which our child is different <br/>
while still trying to help him work through the ways that his <br/>
differentness made his life miserable and unworkable. And we always <br/>
strive to do that while honoring his own feelings and wishes for <br/>
what is happening with his body and mind. <br/>

<br/>
There was just a discussion on the message boards about the <br/>
difference between structure and routine. Most of us enjoy having <br/>
some sort of routine built in to our day. We get up, have a cup of <br/>
coffee, eat, play, read, work, whatever. That&#39;s much, much different <br/>
from having a contrived structure imposed on us. I think any child <br/>
will feel good in a loving family with a gentle, happy routine. Our <br/>
routines include time to watch TV, time to read (or be read to), time <br/>
to create, time to move, etc. It&#39;s not the same every day, but it has <br/>
a sense of flow and familiarity.<br/>

<br/>
The thing is, all we can ever be is ourselves. Think about that for a <br/>
minute, because it&#39;s really important. It&#39;s not our job to *fix* our <br/>
special needs kids. It&#39;s our job to understand them and help them to <br/>
understand themselves. It&#39;s our job to help them to learn and to *be* <br/>
in their own unique way. It&#39;s our job to let them follow their own <br/>
path as they mature into their grown selves.<br/>
<br/>
If we allow our children to lead the way, to set the pace, they will <br/>
lead *us* on an adventure of learning, doing and being. I have <br/>
learned soooo much by being with my kids and working to understand <br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
Remember too, that the routines of a real life won&#39;t look like <br/>
school. It will look like life. And in the midst of living that life, <br/>
there will be learning. Guaranteed. <br/>

But whole post has said that having your son home, letting him live <br/>
life at his own pace and on his own terms has helped him <br/>
immeasurably. That&#39;s unschooling. Even if a child needs therapies, it <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they need to be in a school, or forced to do &quot;lessons.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I see your point about kids that are so low-functioning or non-<br/>
communicative or unable to be reached. But I don&#39;t think we can <br/>
really put those kinds of truly disabling factors in with a discusion <br/>
of whether unschooling works. That&#39;s at such a far end of the <br/>
spectrum. If we put that caveat of &quot;well under certain circumstances <br/>
it won&#39;t work&quot;, I think we leave a big, huge hole for parents to hide <br/>

Yes.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re saying &quot;Unschooling can and does work this way&quot; and then someone <br/>
comes along saying <br/>
&quot;HARUMPH!  My child is blind and isn&#39;t going to learn braille just feeling <br/>
around the house.<br/>
And she HATES watching movies, and art books are worthless to her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My response to that would be &quot;Duh.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So we don&#39;t want to tear down what we DO know about natural learning by <br/>
saying &quot;Exceptions disprove our rule.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The problem will come when someone wants to say ADD is an exception, or *&quot;gi<br/>
ftedness&quot;* is an exception.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854542103">My kids came to us as foster children.  After three years of seesawing between their bio parents and our home, they became our adopted children.  Our older son is 14 and came to us just before his 8th birthday.  He had been with parents who were in an extremely dysfunctional relationship and who abused both drugs and alcohol.  His younger brother was born cocaine exposed which is what brought them into the child welfare system.<br/>
The abuse and neglect which my older son experienced, as well as prenatal alcohol exposure, has left him very emotionally damaged and with very hard to categorize but increasingly recognizable brain damage.  He is also 14!  He has a whole line of alphabet diagnoses(FAS,ADHD, PTSD, Depression, Obsessive/compulsive tendencies as well as sexual abuse) which aren&#39;t very helpful in explaining this complicated soul who lives in our house but resists being part of our home.  We continue to try to have him realize that he is part of a family where he is loved and protected.  Unfortunately, he has many understandable barriers to such realization.  Formal school institutions, both public and private, with specialized IEPs and within the mainstream, just didn&#39;t want him.  Our younger son (his brother) came to us at 4 months.  He has been diagnosed as ARND (Alcohol Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder) but does not have the behavior/social problems of his older brother.  We kept him home after K for many reasons but mostly in order to prevent the devastating effect on his self esteem which happend to his brother in a system which did not have the time or resources to address his particular problems.  We took our older son out after this past Christmas when it became apparent that the IEP was a joke and that he was just tuning out/dropping out when he was not involved in behavioral episodes.<br/>
I had naturally evolved to a more relaxed approach to homeschooling with my younger son just because it felt right. Now that our older son is home, I&#39;m not quite sure what to do.  There is so much sibling rivalry despite the difference in their ages since Michael, our older son, is often more developmentally close to 6 years old, that it is difficult to leave the two boys in the same room.  Michael is also still caught up in &quot;getting the right answer&quot; that it is difficult to enjoy anything.  He makes everything a competition.  My younger son wants me to play a game with him right now (and we also have a 3 year old foster daughter who needs attention) so I find it very difficult to keep up on this board but I want the wisdom of your experiences!<br/>
I also have problems re: TV and computer with our boys.  Maybe I&#39;m wrong but they both seem much less &quot;humanly&quot; attached after time in front of screens and with button-pushing (my bias is showing but it&#39;s true).  My husband and I have theorized that it is an easier world for them to navigate than the complex one of human relationships.  For kids with attachment problems (substitute alcohol damage), I think these things are lethal.  Michael wants friends and does not know how to get or keep them.  Relating to a machine only seems to make it harder for him.  I&#39;m trying to accept who he is but it is difficult when he has such low self-esteem and is often very unlikable.<br/>
Help,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876752818">Mary,<br/>
These are sweet words to my eyes. My oldest was born with down syndrome. He<br/>
has been home for 2 years now and this is the kind of mantra I mutter to<br/>
myself each day. He is so happy and learning so many things. I just loved<br/>
seeing the things I believe in writing coming from someone else.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Cathy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  There was just a discussion on the message boards about the<br/>
  difference between structure and routine. Most of us enjoy having<br/>
  some sort of routine built in to our day. We get up, have a cup of<br/>
  coffee, eat, play, read, work, whatever. That&#39;s much, much different<br/>
  from having a contrived structure imposed on us. I think any child<br/>
  will feel good in a loving family with a gentle, happy routine. Our<br/>
  routines include time to watch TV, time to read (or be read to), time<br/>
  to create, time to move, etc. It&#39;s not the same every day, but it has<br/>
  a sense of flow and familiarity.<br/>
<br/>
  Do you mind if I ask what kind of special needs are you talking<br/>
  about, Sheila?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;Anne (AnneO) Ohman and Mary (Zenmomma) Gold and Lisa Bugg/Miriam<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  have written extensively about special needs and how UNschooling---<br/>
  the lifestyle---is the best option for the child to be &quot;himself&quot; and<br/>
  not some form of being the parent would like for him to be.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  The thing is, all we can ever be is ourselves. Think about that for a<br/>
  minute, because it&#39;s really important. It&#39;s not our job to *fix* our<br/>
  special needs kids. It&#39;s our job to understand them and help them to<br/>
  understand themselves. It&#39;s our job to help them to learn and to *be*<br/>
  in their own unique way. It&#39;s our job to let them follow their own<br/>
  path as they mature into their grown selves.<br/>
<br/>
  If we allow our children to lead the way, to set the pace, they will<br/>
  lead *us* on an adventure of learning, doing and being. I have<br/>
  learned soooo much by being with my kids and working to understand<br/>
  them.<br/>
<br/>
  Remember too, that the routines of a real life won&#39;t look like<br/>
  school. It will look like life. And in the midst of living that life,<br/>
  there will be learning. Guaranteed.<br/>
<br/>
  Life is good.<br/>

what you are giving to your children. My situation is much milder than <br/>
yours. But still, I believe that school and any kind of school structure <br/>
should be the least of your worries. In fact I don&#39;t think you should give <br/>
it another thought. Your son needs to heal. He needs help with emotional and <br/>
physical damage he has been left with. He doesn&#39;t need to deal with negative <br/>
school pressures. He doesn&#39;t need one more piece of stress piled on his <br/>
plate. He doesn&#39;t need to &quot;master&quot; his studies before he&#39;s 18. He needs a <br/>
break. And you know that. That&#39;s why you&#39;re here asking these questions.<br/>
