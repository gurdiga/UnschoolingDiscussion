<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665430692">When we were first unschooling and people asked me questions like that I <br/>
tended to say, &quot;We&#39;ll just see how it goes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Many times I said, &quot;If unschooling doesn&#39;t work out, he can go to school.&quot;  <br/>
It gave hem hope and I didn&#39;t have to defend what we were doing.<br/>
<br/>
By the time a few years passed, they had friends and I had counter-arguments <br/>
for the everyday stuff.<br/>
<br/>
You might also ask her simple questions like, &quot;What do you mean by <br/>
&#39;socialization&#39;?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Pretty  much people don&#39;t know what they mean when they ask it.  Or ask her <br/>
if teachers didn&#39;t say to her &quot;you&#39;re not here to socialize.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You might go to google.com and put in <br/>
socialization question<br/>
or<br/>
socializing homeschooling<br/>
<br/>
and might find some articles already out there.<br/>

PERFECT -- We&#39;ve got a neighbor who was chomping at the bit to get <br/>
his daughter in school to &quot;socialize&quot; her properly (this line has <br/>
been repeated more than once as he sneers at our eight kids&#39; <br/>
isolation from the *benefits* of the school system.)  He decided to <br/>
enroll her (age four) in Catholic preschool this fall, because she <br/>
wasn&#39;t getting near enough peer group interaction in the comfort of <br/>
her nanny&#39;s home or while attending the weekly playgroup -- you <br/>
know, the one where Bobby got kicked out for biting his playmates <br/>
last year at age three (you assess that one!)  <br/>
<br/>
Last week, she brought her dollie over and suggested a game <br/>
where &quot;Tommy&quot; was dead, and the kids should assist in burying him so <br/>
he would go to the deadworld.  We don&#39;t even get into Halloween <br/>
anymore around here, so someone suggested they play TAG instead.  I <br/>
won&#39;t play psychologist, but her dad had just been reprimanded by <br/>
her mom (who had left as soon as he joined us, immediately prior to <br/>
this scenario) not to leave her alone in the street.  <br/>
<br/>
I get the distinct impression from comments he&#39;s made here and there <br/>
that he thinks that we&#39;re not quite up to snuff in the parenting <br/>
department, but I suppose anybody will do if he has more important <br/>
things on his agenda than spend a few minutes socializing with his <br/>
own child or her friends.  I had previously informed him that over <br/>
the years I have established an understanding with my neighbors that <br/>
stay-at-home moms don&#39;t mean free sitting services 24/7, unless <br/>
there&#39;s a genuine need.  <br/>
<br/>
People see a woman with eight kids and seem to think, what&#39;s one or <br/>
two more till the whole neighborhood&#39;s running around in my <br/>
backyard -- even when my crew has come in for the day (and often <br/>
disappeared on purpose because of the obnoxious ways the other kids <br/>
acted when they showed up after school!)  I finally got the idea to <br/>
tell each one in turn to bring a parent with them from now on so we <br/>
could all experience the benefits of socialization!  Not <br/>
surprisingly, no one wanted to play that game with us...  C&#39;est la <br/>
vie.   <br/>

&lt;&lt;i am trying to discuss unschooling with my sister and she asked <br/>
about the socializing aspect.  i answered as best i could remember i <br/>
had been taught, but i would like some links if possible.  i am <br/>
searching on my own too, i just thought i would ask you all as <br/>
well.  thanks for any help, leslie in tx&gt;&gt;<br/>

I dont recall my source (maybe John Holt&#39;s books)? What I say to people is <br/>
&quot;socialization isn&#39;t of just those in your group/class/grade it is of a grand <br/>
mix of people and places and things&quot;.<br/>

There was a longer version of that interview.<br/>
I have it somewhere.  Maybe I should put it online.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know where Emily Subler went, who did the interview?  I really <br/>
liked her.<br/>
