<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215734242">&lt;&lt;We&#39;ve been playing a card game that&#39;s a humorous take off on D&D called <br/>
Munchkin.  It&#39;s funnier and simpler than full-fledged D&D, so it&#39;s a <br/>
possible entry point for families who want to raise their kids up to be <br/>
dungeonairians. &lt;g&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

I&#39;d like to learn more about this game.  Can you point me to instructions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

It&#39;s better to go to the page, where you get art and links, but it&#39;s kind of <br/>
interesting, and what they say about shirts and bookmarks is true.  They give <br/>
you powers in the game.  Really.   It&#39;s in the rules.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Written by Steve Jackson  Illustrated by John Kovalic <br/>
Go down in the dungeon. Kill everything you meet. Backstab your friends and <br/>
steal their stuff. Grab the treasure and run.<br/>
Admit it. You love it.<br/>
This award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence <br/>
of the dungeon experience . . . with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. <br/>
You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what <br/>
magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff <br/>
of Napalm . . . or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by <br/>
slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the <br/>
Plutonium Dragon . . .<br/>
And it&#39;s illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can <br/>
reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they&#39;re laughing, you can <br/>
steal their stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913891161">My earlier post may have been misleading.  Munchkin can be called a <br/>
&quot;card game&quot;, but it isn&#39;t played with standard playing cards.  You buy <br/>
168 special cards in a box.  (I got mine used at the Sacramento conference.)<br/>
<br/>
The game is made by Steve Jackson games, who also makes some less silly <br/>
role-playing games.<br/>
<br/>
This is their website:<br/>

and reads well and is really into monsters...this is sounding like something <br/>
he&#39;d be interested in. Where would he find others playing it....gaming stores, <br/>
maybe?<br/>
