<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; SO Ned,<br/>
&gt; What do you want US to do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned responds: <br/>
What has happened has been a crescendo of ill feelings, mostly triggered<br/>
this past week by the flap over the Bryants. For my seemingly simple plea<br/>
that they be treated as people whose reasonable rights were (are) being<br/>
trampled, I was amazed at the reaction. I can&#39;t believe that hsers could<br/>
feel the way we&#39;ve had expressed here. Blame the victims! is what I<br/>
hear...they brought the problem upon themselves. I can&#39;t buy that. But, sad<br/>
to say, a similar attitude has existed in CT for many years.<br/>
<br/>
My hope is that everyone know his/her rights -- not just the ones permitted<br/>
by the government of your state, but those you are born with and cannot be<br/>
infringed by any laws. Start with how you want to live your life. If you&#39;re<br/>
content to obey the big one -- &quot;do unto others..&quot; -- then it seems to me<br/>
that no one has the right to force you to do anything against your will,<br/>
ever.<br/>
<br/>
I want you to express your freedom, if you have time for that. If your state<br/>
doesn&#39;t give you freedom to live as you&#39;d like, something is wrong, and I<br/>
hope you will help change it so that your kid and mine will live in more<br/>
freedom than we have, and under less of a threat.<br/>
<br/>
I admit that I see things through political lenses. We live according to<br/>
laws. If those laws restrict us unnecessarily or onerously, then they are<br/>
bad, and we need to change them. If someone can tell me that there is a<br/>
large group in MA that is helping the Bryants so that all homeschoolers in<br/>
the state will have easier, less hassled lives, I would be pleased.<br/>
<br/>
As for unschooling, the big trick for many parents is learning not to<br/>
believe that your child needs schooling as you remember it. I did not<br/>
realize until I was about 40 that I had had a miserable time in school. All<br/>
that time, from varios influences and explicit teaching, I believed that I<br/>
had enjoyed school.<br/>
<br/>
Only with the perspective of time was I able to realize how limited my life<br/>
had been. Luckily for me, my school had a good program of sports, and I was<br/>
intimately involved in those. It was the UNschooling at school that gave me<br/>
the feeling that I was enjoying the whole thing. I can say with total<br/>
conviction that I learned almost nothing from the schooling, but everything<br/>
important from the sports, the clubs, the trips, the singing (choir and<br/>
chorus), times spent in casual conversation with teachers, etc. Here&#39;s the<br/>
catch for homeschoolers: All of that good stuff is available, full time,<br/>
outside of schools. Don&#39;t ever believe that your kid is missing something.<br/>
<br/>
Give the children the advantage they have by not being in schools. Give your<br/>
children access to people doing real things. Do you need examples. I don&#39;t<br/>
think so, but take your kid places. It doesn&#39;t need to be far. Walk, and<br/>
get in the habit of talking to people who are doing what they&#39;re interested<br/>
in...the shopkeeper, the butcher, the mechanic, reporters, etc. They will<br/>
love your attentions, and your kid will take it all in and participate.<br/>
<br/>
John Gatto talks about real learning. He tells us that we need to learn real<br/>
stuff. He believes that learning to build a house is urgent business, and<br/>
learning to build a proper boat, and knowing how to make good clothes, and<br/>
grow good food are essential knowledge. I agree. John Gatto says that if a<br/>
person doesn&#39;t know how to perform essential functions of living, such as at<br/>
least a few of the above, then that person has no business teaching his kid.<br/>
Most teachers have no clue about the above, and the world outside the school<br/>
house walls scares them. I was married to one, briefly.<br/>
<br/>
What I want you to do is the same I want for the children. To start living<br/>
your real life, not the one you think you are expected to live. I see the<br/>
two as vastly different for many people. The Sudbury Valley School has a<br/>
graduation policy: You can graduate any time you feel you are ready. I think<br/>
kids should start their lives whenever they want to. Mine took charge very<br/>
well, at age four. We gave him the reins, so to speak. We did the feeding<br/>
and some grooming. All he needed was our trust.<br/>
<br/>
 Today&#39;s life is synthetic. Many people feel the need to do crazy things<br/>
just to feel alive.  I&#39;ve been lucky in having had a varied life so far. I&#39;m<br/>
68. Training and work designing lots of people&#39;s houses, private school<br/>
teaching -- most subjects, most grades, professional skiing and golf,<br/>
farmer, contractor, store owner, antique dealer, elected office holder,<br/>
wrote two books, published both,  more. I can ride a horse, sail a boat, fly<br/>
a small plane, build a house, play three instruments poorly, make tv<br/>
programs twice a month. None of the above was learned in school. I did study<br/>
architecture, but I had to learn the real stuff after grad school. I wasted<br/>
forever in school.<br/>
<br/>
What I want you to do is to believe in yourselves, not wait for anyone to<br/>
say it&#39;s OK to do something.<br/>
<br/>
A great example of what we need to overcome is the belief that things are<br/>
difficult and that we can&#39;t do them without experts telling us how.<br/>
<br/>
I was asked to teach school at some friends&#39; school. I can&#39;t believe my<br/>
first reaction, &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know how.&quot; After 18 years in classrooms,<br/>
imaging feeling I couldn&#39;t teach 2nd grade. They handed me the book,<br/>
Teacher, by Sylvia Aston Warner, the New Zealander (whom I met years later<br/>
in Colorado where I was living and she came to teach in a school I helped<br/>
start) and the next morning I was perfectly prepared to teach school. We had<br/>
a ball, too, and I felt like most teachers do -- I was doing something<br/>
terribly important, blablabla. Nonsense. It was prison for them and for me.<br/>
My work was making it sufferable, because not going through it in those<br/>
days, was un-imaginable.<br/>
<br/>
Today we know better. Just do it. Learn as you go. Start in the middle.<br/>
 Nothing is hard to do, if you want to do it.<br/>
<br/>
All of the above is dangerous advice, too. I don&#39;t care. I want you to live<br/>
-- if you want to. I am on the side of individuals, not institutions or<br/>
groups. I want individuals to take advantage of the freedoms we are all born<br/>
with in this country.<br/>
<br/>
Luz and I have had two encounters recently that are significant. One, with a<br/>
woman from Taiwan. We met because of our website and she phoned me two<br/>
months ago and that convinced her to come here. She has friends in RI and so<br/>
it was not far to visit our home with her wonderful 9yo son. They are the<br/>
leaders of the homeschooling group in Taiwan. that country is considering<br/>
making Hsing illegal, but she is leading the fight to keep it legal.<br/>
Imagine, this tiny oriental woman, standing like the student in front of<br/>
that Chinese tank, fighting the Taiwan government, almost single-handedly.<br/>
<br/>
The other was in Germany. Our unschooled now college grad son was traveling<br/>
in Germany a month ago when a woman emailed us from Dusseldorf about<br/>
homeschooling. It is illegal there, but she was planning to move to Canada<br/>
so she could homeschool her now 4yo boy.  We gave her our son&#39;s email<br/>
address and she contacted him in Berlin and he took the train across Germany<br/>
and spent two days with her little family. Her first homeschooler, and he<br/>
was most impressive to her.<br/>
<br/>
I am saddened that on opposite sides of the world, there are modern<br/>
governments, and so many people here too, that are opposed to letting their<br/>
citizens exercise freedom of education.<br/>
