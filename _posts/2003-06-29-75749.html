<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623783636">&quot;My boys are doing that as well.  They make something out of legos or just <br/>
strike a pose and have me take a picture of it.  Then download it on the<br/>
 computer <br/>
and they add the attack/defense etc to the bottom of the card and print it <br/>
out. <br/>
<br/>
Too funny...my boys have been doing this also. <br/>
They figured out that in the KidPix program, they can create the entire card then print it out. Looks fairly convincing. They even got the size right.<br/>
They slip them into the protectors, so no laminating here. Very cool!<br/>
