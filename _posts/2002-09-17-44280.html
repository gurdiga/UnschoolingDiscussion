<div id="ygrps-yiv-852092040"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, the &quot;Teacher&#39;s&quot; do the diagnosing, one of the things I plan to<br/>
&gt; do in the future is lobby for law changes regarding &quot;Teacher<br/>
&gt; Diagnosis&#39;s&quot; but that&#39;s in the future. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please call me when you do. If I am not qualified to teach my child (Both<br/>
the principal and his teacher have said that) then my child&#39;s teacher<br/>
certainly cannot diagnose a medical problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; DFACS tricked me into signing her up for crossroads then tried to<br/>
&gt; file neglect charges when I realized what sort of school itwas, and<br/>
&gt; went and snatched the signed papers out of thier hands and tore them<br/>
&gt; up &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good for you! I wish I had been as brave when they put Chris in &quot;Impact&quot;<br/>
(Same sort of program). They drugged him and gave him excuses for bad<br/>
behaviors. It took me forever to get his thinking back to normal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Not only the school system, but also what you call DSS (DFACS here).<br/>
&gt; They use theri self appointed power to try and run people&#39;s live&#39;s,<br/>
&gt; when their energies shouldn&#39;t be on parent&#39;s that refuse to drug<br/>
&gt; thier children, but on those that actually do abuse and harm children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolute power corrupts absolutely...God I wish i knew who said that. i am<br/>
always quoting it&lt;GGG&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry, don&#39;t mean to ramble myself, but you sound like you&#39;ve been in<br/>
&gt; the same shoes as me almost, and it&#39;s so nice to know that there are<br/>
&gt; others out there that do understand.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t hear me complaining. I am glad to meet someone who rambles as well<br/>
as I do&lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you ever need someone to talk to, I&#39;m just a phone call away.<br/>
&gt; Drop me an email and I&#39;ll give you a call on my dime.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I may very well do that, love. Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men<br/>
are almost always bad men.&quot;<br/>
