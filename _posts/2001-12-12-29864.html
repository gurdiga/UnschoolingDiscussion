<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657458108">Here&#39;s one source (unverified, just found it on a search) that details which<br/>
vaccines are cultured on human diploid cells, which they say is from human<br/>
fetal tissue:<br/>

Please note, the rabies vaccine mentioned here is the one given to *humans*,<br/>
like myself, who need pre-exposure vaccine because of working in<br/>
animal-related fields.<br/>
<br/>
A page on vaccines in the UK, with a link to US vaccines, suggesting ethical<br/>
alternatives to common vaccine lines. This page explains that the main two<br/>
cell lines used to propagate vaccines are fetal cells from two aborted<br/>
fetuses, one in the 1970s and one in the 1960s.<br/>

Still no mention of animal vaccines.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t log on to the member areas of the AVMA website right now to check<br/>
the cell culture source of animal vaccines, but if I do find that they are<br/>
propagated on human diploid cells, I will repost. I doubt it, however, if<br/>
simply because it is more expensive to do so. Thanks for bringing this up,<br/>
though; it&#39;s something I wasn&#39;t aware of.<br/>
