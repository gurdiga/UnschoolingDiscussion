&gt; Anybody going to the HSC Conference in Sacramento this weekend?  I know<br/>
&gt; Betsy, Pam S. and Pam H. are.  With me that&#39;s 3 Pams.  Anyone else?  And can<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It looks like they&#39;ve put me at 8:30 on Sunday morning to speak on the<br/>
Unschooling panel (I&#39;ll have to lodge a formal protest &lt;g&gt; as it&#39;s cruel to<br/>
make me talk that early.)<br/>
<br/>
I will be breezing into town (okay, at that hour, stumbling) just to talk<br/>
and run, but would be happy to chatter and drink coffee with anyone after<br/>
the panel ends at 10 a.m.<br/>
<br/>
I *could* also go nap in the car at 10 a.m. and then meet everyone for lunch<br/>
(don&#39;t think I&#39;m kidding, it&#39;s exactly what I did last year, when they put<br/>
me on the &quot;Everyone-Here-Is-Unschooling-Of-Course-In-Spite-Of-Any<br/>
Curriculum-They-Happen-To-Be-Using-They-Just-Unschool-On-The-Weekends-Except<br/>
-For-Math&quot; Panel -- i.e, Methods and Styles). After my violent twitchings<br/>
they somehow did NOT select me for it again. What poor unsuspecting<br/>
Unschooler sap did they rope in for it this year? I should warn them to<br/>
bring a muzzle for themselves. And sedatives.<br/>

My 14dd (yes, the one with &#39;no interests&#39;) is on the Teen Conference Committee, so we will arrive Thursday afternoon. I&#39;m game if I can stay awake (this is not an insult to you guys- I just get sleepy)<br/>
I would Love to meet Pams and Betsy and Joylyn. <br/>

<br/>
Yes!!!!  We&#39;ll even try really hard to remember your real name, Mary, <br/>
and not call you Pam-just-because-it&#39;s-easier-to-remember and a likely <br/>
guess in this group. &lt;bweg&gt;<br/>

I will be yawning a lot, too.  It&#39;s not meant to be personal.<br/>
