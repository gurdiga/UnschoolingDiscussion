I always wonder about people who don&#39;t have their own email address, but<br/>
share one with a spouse.  Maybe it is their only option.  But every email<br/>
account I&#39;ve ever had (from the free to the very expensive) offers several<br/>

set up how your address appears to people who receive email from you.<br/>
<br/>
My other life saver is to have all unschooling-dotcom email go into a<br/>
separate folder.  Then I can arrange them by date received, or by subject,<br/>
or by person who sent it.  Sometimes I need to delete hundreds of them at a<br/>
time, because I can&#39;t keep up.  But it&#39;s easy, because they are all in one<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-271943277">We&#39;ve always (except once) had just one address. Since I&#39;m the primary <br/>
one who does email, it makes sense for us. For a while I maintained him <br/>
a hotmail acct. but that eventually went defunct.<br/>
<br/>
In the unlikely event he gets email that&#39;s not also for me, or for joint <br/>
email, I&#39;ll call him to the computer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-211283205"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; How can I seperate my emails into different folders? This would be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>useful<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; inorder to keep personal and unschooling seperate.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends on what you&#39;re using for email.  If you use Outlook Express,<br/>
right click on Local Folders and then click new folder.  Make a folder for<br/>
each category you want. I make one for each list I&#39;m on.  Then click Tools,<br/>
Message Rules, and then Mail.  Now you can set up your filters.  Click New.<br/>
In #1, click where subject line contains specific words.  In #2 click move<br/>
to specified folder.  In #3 you click on the underlined words to edit them.<br/>
So for specified words, you&#39;d click that and then type in<br/>
Unschooling-dotcom.  Then click specified and choose which folder it will go<br/>
to.<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
Also, it would help everyone else if you delete everything but the specific<br/>
words you want to quote in your reply.  (You left in all the yahoo baloney,<br/>
which we had to scroll past in order to get to your question.<br/>
