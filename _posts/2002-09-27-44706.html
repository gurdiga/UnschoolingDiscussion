  I certainly understand where your daughter is coming from. Our 15yod<br/>
has thought for a long time it was a waste to go to college and spend<br/>
tons of money...most likely come out with debt and end up doing what she<br/>
wants in the first place ~ be a mom!<br/>
  She would be pressed to use her &quot;skills&quot; later on when she would rather<br/>
be at home with her children anyway. She is very much a people person and<br/>
would love to be working in the public even around minimum wage and happy<br/>
than having to settle on a career to pay a college debt.<br/>
  I have wondered though whether many of the &quot;big&quot; advocates of college<br/>
are from those that either never went or did not finish and feel they<br/>
missed out on higher paying jobs. Kind of unfulfilled I guess!<br/>
  Our daughter is working p/t in a consignment shop and has helped<br/>
customers put together outfits. The owner is thrilled (more sales) my <br/>
daughter loves it and a N.Y. City designer came in and heard her talking<br/>
to a customer. He listened awhile and then later told my daughter she has<br/>
a natural talent and should go into designing or interior decorating.<br/>
Neither of which appeals to her...she just loves people and putting<br/>
things together to make an outfit, decorate her room etc.<br/>
  Our desire for her and the other children is to find what they want to<br/>
do and then go for it. Is that too simplistic?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s the same thing we see with public schools, really.  The<br/>
they-didn&#39;t-hurt-me-so-they&#39;ll-be-good-for-you-too syndrome.  The folks who<br/>
went to college and got the degree are now working, making it, etc. and so<br/>
they can&#39;t see outside that box.  They can&#39;t see the damage it does to many<br/>
people, and also may have done to them.  They did it, and they&#39;re making big<br/>
bucks, so everybody should.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only when you step outside that box, step out of the path that<br/>
everybody else walks that you see the problems with it.  If all these<br/>
&quot;happy&quot; college-educated people are so happy, why do self-help books sell so<br/>
well?  Why do people feel unfulfilled by all the stuff they&#39;ve acquired and<br/>
want more, more, more?  Why are so many people searching for some sort of<br/>
meaningful in their lives?<br/>
<br/>
Unjobbing and unschooling college make complete sense to us because we&#39;ve<br/>
already stepped outside the accepted norm.  It&#39;s trying to get our friends,<br/>
family, colleagues, etc. to see that there is life outside that norm, and<br/>
really, it&#39;s better out here!<br/>
<br/>
At least that&#39;s my take on the situation.<br/>

I had another example this week of my kids NOT being spoiled even though we <br/>
let them have tons of stuff and freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby saved $330 over a year.  I had a rice box I was putting change in.  <br/>
That was $70, when we counted it, and that was for him too, for taking to an <br/>
anime convention in Denver, over 300 miles away.<br/>
<br/>
He came back with almost $175.  He had bought gifts for those who had helped <br/>
him out, he had bought gasoline and meals, helped pay for the room he shared, <br/>
etc., and brought back just three things for himself, a CD of music of one of <br/>
the Final Fantasy games, and two lapel pins.  <br/>
<br/>
He went last year too.  He wants definitely to go next year.<br/>
<br/>
First thing he did when he came back was tell us all stories for hours, and <br/>
pay me and his dad back for some money we had fronted him, for leather for <br/>
armor (his dad) and for a superdy-renewal of his Nintendo Power (which I had <br/>
put on a charge card), which came with a video game.<br/>
<br/>
So he was out of debt, still had pocket money, good memories, we were all <br/>
happy with him...<br/>
<br/>
Not needy.<br/>
<br/>
But if we had said &quot;NO, you don&#39;t need to go there, stay home,&quot; or &quot;You take <br/>
$150 and make it stretch,&quot; or &quot;We&#39;re not fronting you money,&quot; he WOULD have <br/>
been stressed and more needy and less secure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175981687">Has everyone on this list had such unhappy experiences at College?  I am<br/>
amazed!<br/>
Personally, I found that as far as teaching me a subject (in my case<br/>
Japanese language and political systems)it was not very successful.  For my<br/>
husband, however, the opposite is true.  He is a natural student and soaked<br/>
it all up like a sponge.  As for a social time, it was excellent for both of<br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
From what I observed in friends and family there is both good and bad in<br/>
college.  If you have a few good teachers (and there are some great ones to<br/>
be found) then it can be worth every minute.  I can&#39;t speak for every penny<br/>
as I went to college in Australia where the costs to the individual are<br/>
almost nil.  Some engineering and technical schools can provide a training<br/>
that you would be hard pressed to get on your own.  It can also be a huge<br/>
waste of time.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t doubt that there could be far better alternatives to college, but<br/>
our society is not set up for much else.  I am not willing for my kids to<br/>
not go to college out of some kind of principle, so I am looking at the<br/>
ability to get into a college as a benchmark in our homeschooling.  Whether<br/>
they ever choose to go to college or not is another question, I don&#39;t want<br/>
to be blamed at some future date for having failed to prepare them for life<br/>
adequately and I think that university is too much a part of our culture to<br/>
dismiss it so easily.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I am not willing for my kids to<br/>

<br/>
The ability to get in is not the issue with us.  They can get in.  Kids can <br/>
start at any little junior college, trades school, state college, and with <br/>
good grades (if they&#39;re liking it enough to do that) can transfer to a <br/>
university.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t want<br/>
to be blamed at some future date for having failed to prepare them for life<br/>
adequately and I think that university is too much a part of our culture to<br/>
dismiss it so easily.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s saying they want to purposely prevent their children <br/>
being prepared for college.  The only people I&#39;ve EVER heard say anything <br/>
even near that was Christian families who didn&#39;t want their *girls* to go to <br/>
college, at all.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Some engineering and technical schools can provide a training<br/>
that you would be hard pressed to get on your own.  It can also be a huge<br/>
waste of time.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All absolutely true.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m understanding the attitude to be about college, when it seems like <br/>
&quot;whatever&quot; from some homeschoolers, is that they hope their children are <br/>
growing up to see value in people and professions and jobs and hobbies <br/>
WITHOUT first asking &quot;Do they have a college degree?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Too many people have NO idea what they like or want when they graduate from <br/>
high school.  All they&#39;ve been encouraged to want or need is to get into <br/>
college, and some get out of college STILL without a clue or direction.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed school, personally.  Enjoyed college, and am glad I didn&#39;t drop <br/>
out.  Finished at 20.  Paid off my own loans.  Still have friends from those <br/>
times.  Still in touch with a couple of professors.  Went to the funeral of <br/>
one a few years back.<br/>
<br/>
My kids know there are specialties that need training.  They know some need <br/>
college, some need other training.  They are not &quot;preparing for college&quot; in <br/>
that focussed, memorizing, cramming way most people think of it.  They are <br/>
preparing for life.  College is a part of life.  It doesn&#39;t have to begin at <br/>
17 or 18.  It doesn&#39;t have to happen in four years.  <br/>
<br/>
I majored in English.  I went to school with people who had never ever <br/>
written a single word that wasn&#39;t assigned by a teacher.  There were people <br/>
there who ONLY knew how to read assigned books.   Instead of having read for <br/>
fun, things they just came across, they always chose their reading off lists <br/>
of books that were supposed to be read.  &quot;Classics.&quot;  WHY!?  Because they <br/>
were school-trained up to their ears in the idea that at each decision point <br/>
there was a &quot;right&quot; decision (traditional, conservative, leading toward &quot;a <br/>
goal,&quot;) and the wrong (time wasting, creative, personal, frivolous).<br/>
<br/>
They weren&#39;t thinking, they were reacting the right way.<br/>
<br/>
Some of them were in their 20&#39;s and still waiting for permission to be <br/>
individual humans.<br/>
<br/>
I think probably THAT is what people are trying to avoid when they say they <br/>
don&#39;t care whether their kids go to college.<br/>

<br/>
If I may,<br/>
<br/>
I went to college, majored in Cultural Anthropology because that&#39;s what<br/>
I was interested in (after the fine art degree and the barber&#39;s license)<br/>
and I loved it.  My husband is just now finishing his degree in a field<br/>
that interests him.  Our children have college funds set up for them by<br/>
their papa (my father).  I think it&#39;s all great - if that&#39;s what you<br/>
want and where you want to be.  If not, then college isn&#39;t for you.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, my father and I don&#39;t care if the kids use the college fund<br/>
for college, or traveling, or house payments, or books, whatever they<br/>
choose - it&#39;s theirs.  They will not be pressured into going.  As a<br/>
matter of fact our youngest is saying she will never go to school, ever,<br/>
even college (she decided to try kindergarten this year and went one<br/>
day.  She walked out of the classroom saying she got hit by another<br/>
student three times, they only got to read one book, they spent most of<br/>
their time waiting for other people and she&#39;s bored and doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
go back - so she didn&#39;t.  I&#39;m so proud of her.).<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m trying to say, is that whether you go or not should be a<br/>
personal choice, and just because you decide to go does not mean you<br/>
need to finish it with a degree in your hand.  One of the smartest men I<br/>
know took classes that interested him over a ten year period and then -<br/>
1 class away from his degree - he quit because he was done.  That&#39;s the<br/>
way to do it in my book - just go after what interests you.<br/>

I agree w/that completely. The reason *I* personally don&#39;t feel the need to <br/>
go, is because I can&#39;t think of anything that interests me enough to go <br/>
through the hassle of getting enrolled. Mostly I just hate paperwork. LOL. <br/>
My wife would love to go to hone her wheel-pottering skills. However, she <br/>
hasn&#39;t been able to find a college that would let her take just *one* <br/>
class, without doing the entrance test, or aiming for a degree, so she <br/>
doesn&#39;t go. If a person knows what they want to study, then by all means, <br/>
they should go. I just don&#39;t think the &quot;collective we&quot; should be *expected* <br/>
to go to college because &quot;that&#39;s what our society says is necessary&quot;. Ya <br/>
know? :)<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t afford to build a trust-fund for the kids&#39;. So, when the time <br/>
comes that they want to try college, we&#39;ll be looking hard into grants :-) <br/>
Else they could start saving their allowances for it, but they&#39;d rather buy <br/>
fun things right now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-206786191">I wanted to make a comment here.  Although we are new to hs (and <br/>
uns) when I think about my college history....I went to college <br/>
right after highschool and did it only because it was &quot;what you <br/>
did.&quot;  I felt pressured and did not like the fact that I was now in <br/>
college with the same people I was in hs with and I didn&#39;t even <br/>
really know what I wanted to do.  I had not experienced enough of <br/>
life to have a clue.  My hs counselor talked to us about college as <br/>
if it were this prerequisite to life in general.  I very shortly <br/>
after starting dropped out.  Now at 32 I am back in (well it has <br/>
been a ten year process).  Over the years I have gone back for a <br/>
while working towards a degree and then not.  I still had no idea <br/>
what I wanted.  I would have liked to have the ability to make that <br/>
decision 14 years ago, but it just never happened.  Now however I am <br/>
so glad to be in college and pursuing the degree that I am.  It is a <br/>
wonderful feeling to be working towards something you really want <br/>
and a career I want to be in.  I&#39;ll stop blabbing...the post just <br/>
made me think of my circumstances.  Of course if my children know <br/>
what they want sooner and want to enter college - great!  But I do <br/>
not want them to feel they have to go to get a 4 yr. degree that <br/>
means nothing to them just to get on with their lives. <br/>

&gt; adequately and I think that university is too much a part of our <br/>
culture to<br/>
&gt; dismiss it so easily.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s saying they want to purposely prevent their <br/>
children <br/>
&gt; being prepared for college.  The only people I&#39;ve EVER heard say <br/>
anything <br/>
&gt; even near that was Christian families who didn&#39;t want their <br/>
*girls* to go to <br/>
&gt; college, at all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Some engineering and technical schools can provide a training<br/>
&gt; that you would be hard pressed to get on your own.  It can also be <br/>
a huge<br/>
&gt; waste of time.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All absolutely true.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I&#39;m understanding the attitude to be about college, when it <br/>
seems like <br/>
&gt; &quot;whatever&quot; from some homeschoolers, is that they hope their <br/>
children are <br/>
&gt; growing up to see value in people and professions and jobs and <br/>
hobbies <br/>
&gt; WITHOUT first asking &quot;Do they have a college degree?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Too many people have NO idea what they like or want when they <br/>
graduate from <br/>
&gt; high school.  All they&#39;ve been encouraged to want or need is to <br/>
get into <br/>
&gt; college, and some get out of college STILL without a clue or <br/>
direction.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I enjoyed school, personally.  Enjoyed college, and am glad I <br/>
didn&#39;t drop <br/>
&gt; out.  Finished at 20.  Paid off my own loans.  Still have friends <br/>
from those <br/>
&gt; times.  Still in touch with a couple of professors.  Went to the <br/>
funeral of <br/>
&gt; one a few years back.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My kids know there are specialties that need training.  They know <br/>
some need <br/>
&gt; college, some need other training.  They are not &quot;preparing for <br/>
college&quot; in <br/>
&gt; that focussed, memorizing, cramming way most people think of it.  <br/>
They are <br/>
&gt; preparing for life.  College is a part of life.  It doesn&#39;t have <br/>
to begin at <br/>
&gt; 17 or 18.  It doesn&#39;t have to happen in four years.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I majored in English.  I went to school with people who had never <br/>
ever <br/>
&gt; written a single word that wasn&#39;t assigned by a teacher.  There <br/>
were people <br/>
&gt; there who ONLY knew how to read assigned books.   Instead of <br/>
having read for <br/>
&gt; fun, things they just came across, they always chose their reading <br/>
off lists <br/>
&gt; of books that were supposed to be read.  &quot;Classics.&quot;  WHY!?  <br/>
Because they <br/>
&gt; were school-trained up to their ears in the idea that at each <br/>
decision point <br/>
&gt; there was a &quot;right&quot; decision (traditional, conservative, leading <br/>
toward &quot;a <br/>
&gt; goal,&quot;) and the wrong (time wasting, creative, personal, <br/>
frivolous).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They weren&#39;t thinking, they were reacting the right way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some of them were in their 20&#39;s and still waiting for permission <br/>
to be <br/>
&gt; individual humans.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think probably THAT is what people are trying to avoid when they <br/>
say they <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t care whether their kids go to college.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-525023896">Kate, <br/>
I agree with you.  I was the first in my family(baby of the family) of four to go to college/uni.  <br/>
I had to fight my whole way there because no one else had gone, including my parents. They couldn&#39;t understand why I would want to go.  I just loved the wealth of knowledge there!  I didn&#39;t much get into the clickiness (sp?), it was a small liberal arts college.  But there were so many talented individuals there sharing those talents.  <br/>
For me that was my desire and I got lots of financial aid because my parents couldn&#39;t afford it. <br/>
On the flip side, I have a business and English degree, and sometimes as I was making student loan payments I would wonder was it worth it?  Being a stay at home mom and not making any income.  And you know what?  I probably wouldn&#39;t be the person I am today,  good or bad, I&#39;m happy with me. <br/>
My husband and I both went to college but if our children don&#39;t want to....more power to them! All I want for them is to be happy ... hopefully growing up in an unschooling/open environment will do that for them! <br/>
Take Care,<br/>

Oh, I don&#39;t know about that. I can dismiss it quite easily. &lt;g&gt; Here I<br/>
am,<br/>
at 37, have a beautiful homestead, family, etc. and I&#39;ve only attended<br/>
college for 1.5 years. And I was always thinking I would rather be<br/>
somewhere else :) I consider my life to be a &quot;success&quot;, and the minimal<br/>
time I spent in college had *nothing* to do with it.<br/>

<br/>
If I may,<br/>
<br/>
I went to college, majored in Cultural Anthropology because that&#39;s what<br/>
I was interested in (after the fine art degree and the barber&#39;s license)<br/>
and I loved it.  My husband is just now finishing his degree in a field<br/>
that interests him.<br/>

The magic word is &quot;audit.&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt; I do <br/>
not want them to feel they have to go to get a 4 yr. degree that <br/>
means nothing to them just to get on with their lives.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
AMEN.<br/>
<br/>
And there is not really any big rush.<br/>
<br/>
If we lived way out in the middle of nowhere and my kids had never had lots <br/>
of interaction with others, I&#39;d be hoping they&#39;d want to got to college for <br/>
sure.  But in our case, we&#39;re in a college town, and they DO have lots of <br/>
interaction with people their own ages and younger and older, and adult and <br/>
in college, so they see it, they know it&#39;s available, and nobody&#39;s stressing.<br/>
<br/>
My husband started buying the savings bonds you can use on education years <br/>
and years ago, so although we don&#39;t have enough to get anyone through four <br/>
years, we DO have enough to allow all three to dabble and see what they want!<br/>

  The ability to get in is not the issue with us.  They can get in.  Kids can <br/>
