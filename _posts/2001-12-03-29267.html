<div id="ygrps-yiv-397176789">I like these ideas, Tia.....think I&#39;ll ask my almost 10 y.o. about them for<br/>
her.<br/>
One thing that seems to frustrate dd the most is the time it takes to read<br/>
and figure out the words....by then,  it&#39;s difficult to put the sentence<br/>
together to mean something....and the storyline is really easy to lose.  And<br/>
she doesn&#39;t like simple stories anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm....just had an idea.......maybe we need to find some fun poems,  where<br/>
the length is not intimidating and the flow of the language is usually<br/>
*fun*.<br/>
<br/>
Susan<br/>
<br/>
There were some looooooong pauses<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;but she would eventually figure out the word (sounding out phoneticly).<br/>
&gt;These pauses were unbelievably long and made me uncomfortable. I realized<br/>
&gt;that *part* of our problem is I&#39;m impatient. I see her struggling so I jump<br/>
&gt;in and tell her the word. She doesn&#39;t like this *at all*.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is something that Lars hates.  One of the problems we had working with<br/>
reading is that we didn&#39;t figure out a signal that he could use to let me<br/>
know that he wanted help.  You might want to talk with your daughter about<br/>
how she wants you to handle those spaces.  Just wait?  Wait till she asks<br/>
for help?  She gives you a signal that says she wants help?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;More than that, though, I think *I* could be her biggest obstacle because<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;my rush-rush personality which doesn&#39;t allow her the time she needs to<br/>
&gt;figure things out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is one reason I suggested that you try having her read silently, just<br/>
pointing to or spelling out words she wants help with.  Then you could be<br/>
doing something else (that you don&#39;t mind interruptions with) and just tell<br/>
her the words.  This way, you wouldn&#39;t even know that she was struggling<br/>
until she asked you a word, and your impatience wouldn&#39;t come into it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Might work for her.  It didn&#39;t work with Lars, but that&#39;s partly because we <br/>
tried it when I was doing my non-unschooling insistence on reading <br/>
practise.  Also, he never did get rhymes.  He may have the idea now, but <br/>
even a couple of years ago he couldn&#39;t rhyme to save his life.  It didn&#39;t <br/>
matter how many times or ways I explained it, the concept just wasn&#39;t grasped.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been months now since I mentioned the word reading to him, and I <br/>
noticed last night that he was reading a rather complicated-looking manual <br/>
that came with his bike shocks.  I do see him reading more, though I have <br/>
no idea how much of it he&#39;s comprehending.  (And I&#39;m not going to try to <br/>
find out!)  He still won&#39;t tackle fiction, though sometimes he&#39;ll read <br/>
ahead a few pages if I&#39;ve stopped at an exciting part.  (Maybe I need to <br/>
get better at stopping at the exciting parts. &lt;g&gt;  I have trouble doing <br/>
that in my own reading.)<br/>

<br/>
I went to www.nhgri.nih.gov/educationkit/ and ordered a packet on The Human Genome Project.  I received it, but we haven&#39;t started using it yet.  I got it for free.  They said at that site that they have other reference resources and will post updates there too.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some.<br/>

The actual books I had were, I think, Jim Diamond Mysteries, published in the 70s.  Probably out of print now, but you can find high/low readers in a lot of places.  Ask at a book store, do an internet search, and go to the State Textbook Depository downtown.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796434781">Thanks, Joy!  Worth checking into.  I read Parents Who Love To Read,<br/>
Children Who Don&#39;t......and one of the main points was that children need to<br/>
be successful in reading in order to want to do it more.  Other than that,<br/>
I know we have a &quot;book rich&quot; environment here.....books of all shapes,<br/>
sizes, difficulty levels.  I&#39;m feeling more comfortable trusting myself that<br/>
she&#39;ll get it when she&#39;s ready.....thanks mostly to the dialog on this list.<br/>

It was one of the most enlightening moments when I realised that Kenna didn&#39;t learn the same way I did. I&#39;m a visual learner and so is Michael, but Kenna is more kinetic, spatial. I see letters and numbers when someone is giving me diections while Kenna see shapes and colors. That was such a big help with unschooling her. Severely cut down on frustration on all sides. My kids don&#39;t like all of the same things I do. Maybe Your dd&#39;s reading is similar in that she&#39;s not learning to read the same way you did?  <br/>

I find that if I quit reading this list for awhile I get more of a &#39;school at home&#39; mentality thing going on. This list and others helps with keeping me relaxed and confident.<br/>

We have had a lot of linguistic stuff happening around here lately.  <br/>
The first was the realization that dd 14 &#39;sees&#39; words when she hears <br/>
them.  I forget what the word was, but she kept question what we <br/>
meant when we said something and it turned out to be a homophone <br/>
thing happening in her head.<br/>
The second was something that we have to work with Vaidas about,  <br/>
Lithuanian does not have a &#39;th&#39; sound.  He has trouble with things <br/>
like &#39;that&#39; - he writes &#39;what&#39; and &#39;other&#39; - he writes &#39;over&#39;.  He <br/>
can&#39;t pronounce it right either.  It&#39;s funny really because my mom is <br/>
using the same resources for this 18 yo exchange student and my 9 yo <br/>
son who has a speech quirk with &#39;th&#39; too.<br/>
The third was a website with a mind game on it involving colors and <br/>
words.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.optillusions.com/43.html">http://www.optillusions.com/43.html</a>  It was interesting to <br/>
see who in the family could do it and who could not!  Put me in the <br/>
could not camp.<br/>
<br/>
In searching for the color site I found this one too . . .Way cool <br/>
stuff!!!<br/>
