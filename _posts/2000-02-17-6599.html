<br/>
&gt;Please send me the address for the earth box. My 7 year old loves the idea of a &gt;garden, but we have a small yard. This sounds like a great alternative. Thanks.<br/>

I think I&#39;ll order one and try it. They have a technical page that lists some of their test results that seem impressive. Aleasa</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138088286">This is just my .02 on the earth box..went to the site and looked at the <br/>
info...it definetly  looks like it will do what it says...first<br/>
off your dealing with a raised bed idea with perfect/nearly perfect soil <br/>
conditions...and <br/>
next you have a water resevoir...gardening made simple...<br/>
Now if you didn&#39;t want to go thru the expense of buying one of these, you can <br/>
make<br/>
your own raised bed and fill it with soil and organic materials in a sunny <br/>
spot in your <br/>
yard...the water is the only thing you will need to keep up on..but that is <br/>
often the <br/>
joy of the little hands that are helping you...raised beds make gardening <br/>
alittle easier<br/>
because you can amend  only part of your soil  not a whole big garden <br/>
plot...say..<br/>
start with a small 4x6 bed...a few tomatoes, peas, lettuce, carrots..eect<br/>
like I said...this is only my opinion  ..<br/>
your humble gardening friend,<br/>
