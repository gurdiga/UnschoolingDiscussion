<div id="ygrps-yiv-208034628">I am looking forward to unschooling my 5 year old daughter who has<br/>
been in a private Christian school for the past year. She seems<br/>
excited too and asks frequently when we&#39;re going to get started.<br/>
Little does she know that as she&#39;s weighing the fruit in the grocery<br/>
store that we&#39;ve been started and that learning never stops.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to the new year,<br/>
Latoya<br/>
