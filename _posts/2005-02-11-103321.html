<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045553216">anyone remember me? It&#39;s been at least a year since I posted. At <br/>
LEAST. More, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m enjoying everyone&#39;s posts, especially the TV, food, and bedtime <br/>
thread, and laughing at My Former Self who would have sniffed a <br/>
hearty, snooty SNIFF at &quot;all that TV&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d drop in and see how things are going in this group, <br/>
and update youse, if you&#39;re interested.<br/>
<br/>
Last January we moved to Ogden, UT from Idaho ranch country. We are <br/>
within walking distance of the local community non-profit theatre, <br/>
where my 17 year old daughter spends pretty much every evening. She <br/>
landed the part of Narissa in their upcoming production of Merchant <br/>
of Venice. Narissa is the lady-in-waiting for Portia: the main female <br/>
character. She&#39;s also assistant stage manager for the current <br/>
production of Forever Plaid, and will be the assistant director for <br/>
the upcoming musical The King and I. She&#39;s been babysitting for my <br/>
sister since we got here, but is now putting in applications for a <br/>
part time job, in order to afford her acting and voice lessons.<br/>
<br/>
The younger kids are absorbed in TV, gameboy, a computer game called <br/>
Rune Quest, Star Wars, big cats, some Playstation, snow play, dog <br/>
care, ( for which my youngest hires herself out in the neighborhood <br/>
and makes a buck here and there) <br/>
<br/>
Middle child just turned 12 and is Mr. Mellow, concerned mostly with <br/>
mastering the latest computer game and making sure to be in front of <br/>
the TV when Teen Titans comes on. And running. <br/>
<br/>
Youngest child turned 10 last summer, and is still not reading, good <br/>
LORD. But she approached a woman in the neighborhood who specializes <br/>
in dyslexia at the local school, and we&#39;re going to get set up with <br/>
an assessment. This is something my youngest has taken on herself, <br/>
completely. I don&#39;t necessarily want to get involved w/the public <br/>
system, but if it&#39;s what she thinks will help her get a handle on <br/>
reading, then we&#39;re going to do it. Reading aside, she&#39;s having no <br/>
trouble with expressing herself and has a fantastic vocabulary, and <br/>
is superb at spatial things. She&#39;s also got a way with numbers.<br/>
<br/>
I am taking piano lessons at the advanced level, pushing towards the <br/>
spring Flying Fingers Festival and loving every minute of it, even <br/>
the scales in minor and minor natural keys. *shudder* The piano <br/>
studio is also within walking distance. <br/>
<br/>
One big reason I dropped in was to give a jolt to our unschooling. To <br/>
remind myself that it&#39;s a GOOD thing. and it is.<br/>
<br/>
Nice &quot;seeing&quot; youse. Now to get reading some more posts.<br/>

If she things that&#39;s what will help her but it doesn&#39;t help, she will just <br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I don&#39;t like the idea. In fact, I&#39;m pretty sure just from <br/>
reading, that she has dyslexia, and Katie knows it, and accepts it. <br/>
The scenario I see coming from an official diagnostic appointment <br/>
would be almost for sure, the public school at the very least, <br/>
pushing to have her enrolled. If there ever was a kid who shouldn&#39;t <br/>
be subjected to the classroom, my katie is her. <br/>
<br/>
thanks, Sandra. Katie and I will talk about it some more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not a disease or a debilitating condition that you should say she &quot;has&quot; or that she should need to accept.<br/>
<br/>
If you had just told her she would learn to read when it made sense to her and couldn&#39;t a moment before that, you&#39;d be telling the truth.  If you tell her there is a thing called dyslexia and she HAS it, it sounds negative and awful.<br/>
<br/>
If Marty had gone to school, school would have (for purposes of justifying their reading lab and their two or three master&#39;s-degreed reading specialists) diagnosed him with &quot;dyslexia.&quot;   I never said that word to him and didn&#39;t even think about it while he was little.  He read at nine.  He reads fine, and lots, and with no regard whatsoever to &quot;reading level.&quot;  He never read baby stuff, only real things.<br/>
<br/>
What six to nine year olds do at school is rarely real honest-to-god reading anyway.  They&#39;re sounding words out from books that were designed to only have words they were likely to be able to sound out.  <br/>
Even the library books they end up being assigned or seeing are often kid-level books, designed to &quot;make reading seem fun and easy!!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259879660">I would be considered dyslexic, and thank god I didn&#39;t have that label when<br/>
I was a kid because instead I just figured out ways around my &quot;problem.&quot;<br/>
And the only problem that I had was that I didn&#39;t read the same way<br/>
everyone else did (or more to the point, I didn&#39;t read the way everyone<br/>
else thought I should.)<br/>
<br/>
I say wait until it all clicks naturally.  Anything else is just torture.<br/>
Some may even say to you &#39;it&#39;s important to do this early&#39; or &#39;there is a<br/>
certain window of opportunity.&quot;  This may be true, but only with the<br/>
perspective that the child will be in the school system.  All of the<br/>
studies are with the #1 assumption that kids are suppose to read early.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always said that if I had been left alone I would have naturally<br/>
started to read between about 12 and 13.  I remember the shift that<br/>
happened for me at that time, physically and mentally.  That&#39;s when I was<br/>
ready, but by then I had given up on it because it was something I knew I<br/>
couldn&#39;t do.  By then I had figured out how to be successful at school<br/>
another way.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that I&#39;m making a guess about this, but I bet that all of the<br/>
techniques in the reading programs aren&#39;t about helping the kids learn to<br/>
read but are designed so the teacher can see for themselves that the kids<br/>
are reading the way they are &quot;suppose&quot; to.  When I finally figured out how<br/>
to read *my* way it went against every reading comprehension program I&#39;d<br/>
ever known about.  I was reading w/o comprehension (ie. I couldn&#39;t take a<br/>
test on it), but I absorbed and integrated what I read... it started to fit<br/>
into my life, I made connections with other things.  It was really awesome,<br/>
and so much more real than anything one can be tested for.<br/>

You&#39;re right.<br/>
It is called &quot;accountability.&quot;<br/>
Teachers need measurable outcomes so that they can prove they&#39;re doing their jobs.  They show their &quot;outcomes&quot; to principals and parents.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm. I didn&#39;t figure it out until my late 20&#39;s, taking some business <br/>
classes at night. If I had figured it out before high school, <br/>
college, etc. I&#39;d sure have had an easier time. <br/>
<br/>
I think the label would have helped me if it came with the strategies <br/>
for coping and just the idea that my brain worked differently than <br/>
other people&#39;s--who were held up as &#39;correct&#39; in some way. Just a <br/>
year ago, I read about ADD and felt so much relief at understanding <br/>
the whys of various aspects of me!  <br/>
<br/>
But. I was in the school system being told that I should be able to <br/>
spell words easily since I read so much/so well. Being compared to <br/>
other kids, comparing myself.  I don&#39;t think anyone ever talked about <br/>
different strategies for learning until college.<br/>
<br/>
So I can see that the label might not matter to an unschooled child <br/>
who has an individual learning style, strengths and weakness that are <br/>
respected. OTOH, if a child were noticing the difference between <br/>
him/herself and other family members, I could see the explanation--<br/>
and not necessarily the label at all--being helpful.<br/>

truth.  If you tell her there is a thing called dyslexia and she HAS <br/>
it, it sounds negative and awful.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, what you say makes sense. And, in my heart of hearts, I <br/>
know that she will some day start reading, whether I fret about it or <br/>
not. It is a bit difficult not to fret, because we have two public-<br/>
educator grammas in the family. So, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve come across as <br/>
completely worry free about this. <br/>
<br/>
But in my own defense, the reason why I mentioned it to her at all <br/>
was, Katie herself was beginning to wonder what was going on, since <br/>
she really REALLY wanted to be able to read, and it wasn&#39;t coming. I <br/>
checked out a book from the library two years or so ago, the title of <br/>
which i don&#39;t remember, but it explained dyslexic brains as being <br/>
extraordinary, not flawed. The ability to see things in all their <br/>
three dimensions is a trait that should be envied. When I explained <br/>
dyslexia to katie, she was completely accepting of it, and even a <br/>
little bit relieved &quot;Oh! THAT&#39;S why I&#39;m not reading yet.&quot; I consider <br/>
it sort of like a person maybe with a port wine birthmark, <br/>
thinking &quot;What is WRONG with me!?&quot; and someone telling her it&#39;s a <br/>
skin mark that she was born with, nothing dangerous. That&#39;s not the <br/>
best analogy, but I can&#39;t think of a better.<br/>
<br/>
And as for her accepting it...well, if she was in school, and <br/>
officially diagnosed with dyslexia, she would have been made to know <br/>
for sure that she was flawed because of it, and more likely NEVER to <br/>
accept it. Better to accept it and learn everything you can about <br/>
both the strengths and the weaknesses inherent with a spatially <br/>
oriented brain, than to be told &quot;because you can&#39;t decipher two <br/>
dimensional figures with your three dimension-prone brain, you lose.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Whatever else we&#39;ve done, we haven&#39;t placed a negative connotation <br/>
upon the term dyslexic. Promise<br/>

were. She knew she was different, and it was almost a relief to her <br/>

minds, and he uses the word &quot;spatial learning&quot; or some such, and she <br/>
appreciates the bits that fit her style, when I read them to her. <br/>

This book, btw, describes the mind that functions better at night, <br/>
too. :) He even says &quot;it&#39;s too bad we don&#39;t have schools for night <br/>

theory and technique sections, pushing to get from level 6 to level <br/>
8. They figured I was probably in 8 for performance, but to <br/>
participate in the competition in May, all three must be at the same <br/>
