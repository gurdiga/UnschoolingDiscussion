<br/>
Absolutely!  I even get it from my ENTIRE family and many days, that <br/>
includes my husband!  The best thing I can think of is just to perservere.  <br/>
Ignore the glares and comments and try to be friendly.  Maybe you are <br/>
misreading what they are saying.  Maybe not.  There will be some who &#39;get <br/>
over it&#39; and will become your friends and admire what you do...even if they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t choose that path themselves; and there will be those who continue <br/>
to act like blooming igmoes and walk around with their snouts in the air.  <br/>
I&#39;d try at least to get a few in my ranks.  Likely your children will be <br/>
playing with their children, so you need to be friendly with some of them!<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s frustrating, but I don&#39;t know what else to suggest.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
Jennifer<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832461877">I think we all get it.  I know what you mean, I always feel like I am <br/>
*apologizing* (it works for us, its not right for everyone, etc.)  <br/>
Many of my friends have been very supportive but they all say ,&quot;I <br/>
wish I could do that, but I couldn&#39;t.  I do not have the patience--as <br/>
if I am a martyr for this choice)  The saddest thing is not one of <br/>
those people have ever asked how I found it, what books I read, etc.  <br/>
Inside, I feel they do not want to know.  They are &quot;blissfully <br/>
unaware&quot; which is certianly easier but not better.  In alot of ways <br/>
these are the same people that never question their Doctors, <br/>
government and such.  They *are* the products of the school system.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry you are having a hard time.  It makes a big difference to <br/>
have support.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325902425">Sometimes I wonder if there&#39;s any group of people so vicious to each <br/>
other as women.  It&#39;s like a division we shouldn&#39;t have, a war zone <br/>
with WOHM vs SAHM and it&#39;s not personal, it&#39;s just there.  And we can <br/>
try to ignore it, but it&#39;s not going away.  WOHMs are afraid that <br/>
we&#39;re judging them for not &quot;raising their own children&quot; (and admit <br/>
it, many of us are).  SAHMs are afraid that they&#39;re judging us <br/>
for &quot;letting feminism down&quot; or even &quot;being lazy and wanting someone <br/>
else to support us&quot;.  And admittedly, some of them are.  It&#39;s an ugly <br/>
thing between women, but the fact is that there are nasty judgments <br/>
on both sides and individual women are caught in it just by the <br/>
decisions we make in our own homes, which are personal decisions and <br/>
not usually intended as political statements.  I wish I knew what to <br/>
do about it.  Women will become truly powerful when we learn to stand <br/>
beside each other instead of across invisible battle lines.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how much of it the media helps with.  I read a book when I <br/>
was in college, it was written by a slave owner in the 1600s and he <br/>
said the way to keep slaves in line is to divide them.  Make some of <br/>
them field workers and others house servants (divided by the shade of <br/>
their skin) and they&#39;ll be so busy fighting over who&#39;s superior and <br/>
judging each other by every little shade of color difference that <br/>
they won&#39;t have time or inclination to revolt.  I wonder how much of <br/>
the war between women is manufactured by a media that doesn&#39;t care <br/>
whether women have power and likes to see the fallout when they <br/>
say, &quot;Look what the other side has been saying about you!&quot;<br/>

It&#39;s not just you. We make people uncomfortable by demonstrating that <br/>
there is another way. The worst is usually when the kids really like <br/>
me and being at our house because it&#39;s fun. Parents feel threatened <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407791392">You know, I actually feel less alienated from my non-homeschool mom <br/>
friends than I do from my school-at-home friends.  School-at-homers <br/>
seem to be very uneasy around unschoolers.  I guess it is still the <br/>
same type of thing, that in their mind our lifestyle somehow puts <br/>
down theirs.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure that the non-homeschool moms totally feel guilty, <br/>
because most I know would never even consider homeschooling, and are <br/>
so sucked into the whole educational culture they don&#39;t even realize <br/>
the wrong in it.  I think we all just tend to get (at least a little) <br/>
defensive when someone is doing something &quot;new&quot; and &quot;radical&quot; and we <br/>
assume that they think we are wrong for not doing it.  <br/>
<br/>
At least that is what I am working on in telling people that I <br/>
unschool.  It is hard to explain why I am unschooling without saying <br/>
what is wrong with schooling at home.  Same with homeschooling in <br/>
general.  It is hard to explain why we homeschool without saying what <br/>
is wrong with the public/private educational system that they are <br/>
involved in.  <br/>
<br/>
But no, you are definitely not alone!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270718977">Just the other day I got &quot;Are all these yours?&quot; at the market.  I only have<br/>
4.  She said she couldn&#39;t have 4 because they would drive her batty and that<br/>
her 2 make her nuts.  I guess people are just very cautious and unsure about<br/>
anything they haven&#39;t researched, and won&#39;t research anything they find<br/>
intimidating or uninteresting to them.  People like things to be easy and<br/>
comfortable.  So do I.  <br/>
<br/>
The hardest thing I ever did was to look at myself honestly and change the<br/>
way I live.  How many times did I speak out to the universe to help me see<br/>
how to be a different mommy ( i knew i wasn&#39;t following my instincts), how<br/>
many candles did I burn?  I don&#39;t know.  All I know is all of a sudden I<br/>
started looking things up, reading, researching, and found unschooling.com,<br/>
again.  I had run across it a couple years ago but thought it was too<br/>
radical, couldn&#39;t be done by me.  lol..  I just had some more searching to<br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to get back on your question, it&#39;s not just you.  I haven&#39;t had any<br/>
really cold shoulders, probably because I&#39;m not as sociable as people say I <br/>
should&quot; be... whatever that means.  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m having a big conflict with this myself.  While I&#39;m still finding my way, <br/>
I fervently believe in unschooling.  I find it quite difficult to deal with <br/>
my aunt and my best friend, particularly, whose children are in ps.  It <br/>
causes some seriously stressful conversations.  I have a hard time <br/>
expressing and discussing my beliefs and the reasoning behind them without <br/>
sounding like I am attacking them, or at the very least frowning upon the <br/>
choices they have made.  No matter how I put it, they take offense.  I&#39;ve <br/>
noticed the distance it has placed between us.<br/>
<br/>
It seems very similar to the spanking thread a few weeks, or so, ago.  Even <br/>
if you have been a spanker all your life, when the enlightenment comes, it <br/>
is strong and persistant.  It feels absolutely wrong to say, &quot;I firmly <br/>
believe in *never* spanking but I can respect your decision to do so.&quot;  I <br/>
can&#39;t!    Much in the same vein as keeping quiet when I hear them talk about <br/>
punishing, sometimes harshly, for undone homework.  I just want to scream!!!<br/>
<br/>
When I became a mother, I lost friends without children who didn&#39;t want to <br/>
wait around on me anymore.  I couldn&#39;t jump up and head out the door at last <br/>
minute notice, nor did I want to!  Then I got married and lost single <br/>
friends.  Friends who couldn&#39;t understand my desire to curb my daily social <br/>
life for my marriage.  I now find myself separating from friends who follow <br/>
very mainstream parenting practices.  These weren&#39;t overnight losses.  Many <br/>
of them took years to disolve but the change in lifestyles crept in and ate <br/>
away at the friendships.  I am still acquaintances with most, but those deep <br/>
friendships are gone.  I&#39;m finding that even with my own aunt and now my <br/>
best friend of 15 years.  It&#39;s easy to ignore political differences or even <br/>
deep personal beliefs, take religious beliefs for example.  But ignoring <br/>
someone spanking their child everyday or not allowing them to eat dinner <br/>
until homework is done is harder.  Maybe it&#39;s just me, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
There is a bill up for legislation here in Texas right now to make corporal <br/>
punishment a legal and acceptable form of discipline.  It is tearing our <br/>
local homeschool group apart at the seams.  Even though our group is <br/>
secular, a portion of the Christian movement is attacking like Roman <br/>
soldiers, sending emails asking for support of the bill, making it hot topic <br/>
discussion at gatherings and even the email lists, citing scripture in their <br/>
sig lines to avoid being removed from the group, and gutting anyone who <br/>
does&#39;t support their path of righteousness, so to speak.  It is even <br/>
separating the Christians from one another.  I feel like I&#39;m my own little <br/>
island.  Lost in a sea of mainstream ideaology and their vessels are eating <br/>
away my shoreline.  Is it just that I&#39;m in a very conservative state??  Or <br/>
does this happen to everyone?<br/>

way but that not everyone is ever going to do it.  I know that he is<br/>
considered a wonderful teacher by people I know whose kids have had him.  He<br/>
tries to do the very best he can for kids, even though he knows it isn&#39;t<br/>
enough (or enough of the right stuff).  But this discussion was about what<br/>
to tell people who don&#39;t homeschool so as not to put them off.  Talking<br/>
about how it&#39;s working best for his family is a good way to do that.  It&#39;s<br/>
quite different from someone coming on here and saying that they do what&#39;s<br/>
right for their family and that includes curriculum and spanking.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I can really relate to what you are experiencing. I have relatives that parent and school in very different ways and they are not ways I can smile and say its okay to.I have ended up having limited visits with these people and we now don&#39;t have those discussions. The parenting differences are the hardest for me to &quot;ignore&quot; for the sake of family relations. I accept their choices but I sure don&#39;t like them or think they are okay for the children involved.<br/>
<br/>
We are experiencing something similar around competition right now. My son has joined soccer as it is a passion with him for the last three years. He has low thyroid which is now being treated and for the first time he has energy to last an entire game on the field and still be able to run some. I explained to his coach that K might need breaks until his muscles catch up to his new energy. Later in the game he made some remark to him on the field about how much he was resting out there.The parents sitting around tittered. It was made in such a way that my husband was not to sure it was a dig or not The whole competition and sports mentality is in conflict with our parenting, learning, and lifestyle beliefs and our son still wants to play but we despise the field energy etc..<br/>
<br/>
Makes it tough to be supportive and also to find support in our community. <br/>
<br/>
Yikes! I feel like such a radical. <br/>

<br/>
  &lt;&lt;I guess I feel so strongly that unschooling is truly the best fit for<br/>
  ALL children, but in the meantime I recognize that not all parents<br/>
  can comprehend it, much less live it, because it is so radically<br/>
  different than the way most of us were raised.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m having a big conflict with this myself.  While I&#39;m still finding my way, <br/>
  I fervently believe in unschooling.  I find it quite difficult to deal with <br/>
  my aunt and my best friend, particularly, whose children are in ps.  It <br/>
  causes some seriously stressful conversations.  I have a hard time <br/>
  expressing and discussing my beliefs and the reasoning behind them without <br/>
  sounding like I am attacking them, or at the very least frowning upon the <br/>
  choices they have made.  No matter how I put it, they take offense.  I&#39;ve <br/>
  noticed the distance it has placed between us.<br/>
<br/>
  It seems very similar to the spanking thread a few weeks, or so, ago.  Even <br/>
  if you have been a spanker all your life, when the enlightenment comes, it <br/>
  is strong and persistant.  It feels absolutely wrong to say, &quot;I firmly <br/>
  believe in *never* spanking but I can respect your decision to do so.&quot;  I <br/>
  can&#39;t!    Much in the same vein as keeping quiet when I hear them talk about <br/>
  punishing, sometimes harshly, for undone homework.  I just want to scream!!!<br/>
<br/>
  When I became a mother, I lost friends without children who didn&#39;t want to <br/>
  wait around on me anymore.  I couldn&#39;t jump up and head out the door at last <br/>
  minute notice, nor did I want to!  Then I got married and lost single <br/>
  friends.  Friends who couldn&#39;t understand my desire to curb my daily social <br/>
  life for my marriage.  I now find myself separating from friends who follow <br/>
  very mainstream parenting practices.  These weren&#39;t overnight losses.  Many <br/>
  of them took years to disolve but the change in lifestyles crept in and ate <br/>
  away at the friendships.  I am still acquaintances with most, but those deep <br/>
  friendships are gone.  I&#39;m finding that even with my own aunt and now my <br/>
  best friend of 15 years.  It&#39;s easy to ignore political differences or even <br/>
  deep personal beliefs, take religious beliefs for example.  But ignoring <br/>
  someone spanking their child everyday or not allowing them to eat dinner <br/>
  until homework is done is harder.  Maybe it&#39;s just me, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
  There is a bill up for legislation here in Texas right now to make corporal <br/>
  punishment a legal and acceptable form of discipline.  It is tearing our <br/>
  local homeschool group apart at the seams.  Even though our group is <br/>
  secular, a portion of the Christian movement is attacking like Roman <br/>
  soldiers, sending emails asking for support of the bill, making it hot topic <br/>
  discussion at gatherings and even the email lists, citing scripture in their <br/>
  sig lines to avoid being removed from the group, and gutting anyone who <br/>
  does&#39;t support their path of righteousness, so to speak.  It is even <br/>
  separating the Christians from one another.  I feel like I&#39;m my own little <br/>
  island.  Lost in a sea of mainstream ideaology and their vessels are eating <br/>
  away my shoreline.  Is it just that I&#39;m in a very conservative state??  Or <br/>
  does this happen to everyone?<br/>

<br/>
I understand how you feel.  I feel like if I talk about my choice, <br/>
then maybe others will feel like I am *pushing* them.  But it is a <br/>
double edged sword because the reality is that we are keeping our <br/>
children at home and they are not.  Anytime we explain why, they must <br/>
confront their own decisions and yet *I* feel obligated to defend my <br/>
own or at least express them.  So it always leaves these <br/>
uncomfortable pauses.  Of course, I think those that respect the <br/>
choice because they KNOW they would never do it are more comfortable <br/>
than those who feel maybe they should be looking into it.<br/>
<br/>
The further we move from the mainstream, the more difficult it is to <br/>
watch those around you who seem to be walking around blindfolded.  <br/>
The harder it is to have friends you just do not respect in some <br/>
cases.  So quality versus quantity in my case, and I feel the same <br/>
for my children.  IT is not about looking down on others, but more <br/>
about feeling they are not being honest with themselves and are <br/>
unwilling to take a deeper look at issues.  How easy is it to respect <br/>
someone who will not think out of the box.  My best friend from high <br/>
school was suprised when I did not give my son all the required <br/>
vaccinations, she said she &quot;didn&#39;t know you could do that&quot;.  All I <br/>
could think was, &quot;you never asked.&quot;  So certainly the more our <br/>
choices take us away from the mainstream, the more our choices for <br/>
really great friendships narrow.  Of course, this is just my <br/>
experience and I am sure there are others who feel differently.  <br/>
Also, as my dh always says, you just have less patience for bullsh*t <br/>
the older you get!  Things you ackwardly smiled at or ignored, you <br/>
challenge now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually I somewhat envy that you have a secular support group.  The <br/>
three support groups in my area are very fundamental, very assuming <br/>
groups.  You aren&#39;t asked, &quot;Do you go to church?&quot; you are <br/>
asked, &quot;What church do you go to?&quot;  They are truly taken aback when I <br/>
say I don&#39;t go to church.  Luckily, they usually are so speechless <br/>
that I don&#39;t get questioned further.  So it is just assumed that <br/>
EVERYONE will agree with any conservative right legislation that <br/>
might be up for discussion.<br/>
<br/>
So I am really considering not joining any of the groups next year <br/>
(for many reasons, but largely because they are a group of people so <br/>
different in mentality.)  I felt like I had to hide the fact that we <br/>
celebrate Halloween for my daughter&#39;s sake because you are just right <br/>
there next to satan himself if you dress your kids up in a costume <br/>
and let them go door to door getting candy. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I am swerving off topic here, but I can definitely relate.  But <br/>
as so many have accurately pointed out before, I am SO relieved to <br/>
have this group to read about and learn from.  <br/>

<br/>
Exactly.  This is what&#39;s going on with my bg and I.  As time goes by and she <br/>
sees the effects of unschooling on my children...and myself!...she talks <br/>
more and more about homeschooling and learning more about unschooling.  She <br/>
grills and drills me, which I find wonderful, but somehow, it always comes <br/>
back to how much she LOVES having the kids in school so she has her own <br/>
time.  The big thing for her right now is her youngest will start full time <br/>
preK and the middle child will start Kindy next year.  She can&#39;t wait!  <br/>
Makes me want to lose my lunch every time she says that.  Her kids are <br/>
completely out of control.  In the past 6 months or so, every time I talk to <br/>
her she is laying on the couch, not knowing what the kids are doing.  When <br/>
we are on the phone, she spends nearly the entire time whining at her kids.  <br/>
Begging them to stay out of this, quit doing that.  Screaming their names <br/>
over and over and over, yet never once getting up to handle the situation.<br/>
<br/>
I fluctuate between wanting desperately to help her and feeling guilty <br/>
because I am truly not getting much out of the friendship anymore.  Sure, <br/>
there are the moments when we are talking about things that don&#39;t involve <br/>
our children and things are ok and light, but together, we have 10, so <br/>
that&#39;s a tough subject to delete from our conversations, kwim?  I&#39;m <br/>
frustrated and tired of listening to her *want* to homeschool, *want* to <br/>
stop screaming at them all the time, *want* to quit being so lazy,  all the <br/>
while she does nothing to change where she is and tells me how much she is <br/>
dreading summer vacation because by day two she will be sick of her kids.  <br/>
Ugh!  HOW does that make any sense whatsoever?<br/>
<br/>
Grrrrr!  I&#39;m feeling like the loo of the universe this week, can you tell?  <br/>
Thanks, once again, for letting me blow off some steam.  <br/>

Hi, Jennifer --<br/>
<br/>
There may in fact be no nice way to say &quot;school is a big, failed<br/>
brainwashing experiment based on some very faulty science about how<br/>
people learn&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It just sounds like a big, wet slap in the face no matter how softly you<br/>

husband live out near us, and they have one daughter close in age tomy son, <br/>
who is seven. B has been my dear friend for 10 years, and we had our babies <br/>
so close together and attended league together, discuss parenting all the <br/>
time, etc. The one thing she can&#39;t do is home/unschool. they have a big new <br/>
house to pay for, and can&#39;t stay home with dd. I can see it hurts B very much <br/>
to hear and see the different experience of life that Tommy is having from <br/>
that of her daughter. Her child struggles socially(Who wouldn&#39;t in public <br/>
school) and she sees that tommy does not have those same struggles. I feel as <br/>
if the one subject that we can&#39;t discuss is school, and god forbid I should <br/>
bring it up around her husband. He would completely freak out. Why do I have <br/>
to dance around a subject that is so much a part of what I do and who I am, <br/>
when I still have to listen to school stuff from them? <br/>
I guess I don&#39;&#39;t have to , I choose to. I still like this woman and hang to <br/>
what is left of our friendship. It does seem as if I have to apologise for my <br/>
choices with people. How timely of this subject ot come up on this list. Our <br/>
social group is so small because of our choices for our children, and that is <br/>
hard sometimes.My husband doesnt&#39; care as his is not needy of much social <br/>
time, but I am.<br/>
At this point in time, I feel exceptionally alienated from non-homeschool <br/>
moms!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910626372">I too have been in this situation EXCEPT I was the president of the PTA and <br/>
was Unschooling family.  Its actually kinda funny, the PTA president is a <br/>
homeschool Mom. HA!<br/>
I had a friend who secretly wanted to be PTA president but didn&#39;t tell me <br/>
until one day she said you know you shouldn&#39;t be the president. Oh Really? <br/>
<br/>
To make a long story short we went to the next meeting and they voted her in <br/>
a CO-President, I resigned after a bit and have not talked to her since.  Her <br/>
son has since been kicked out for bringing a gun to school in 5th grade and <br/>
she actually has the b*** to call me and ask about HS.<br/>
She is a Teacher now and is telling my close friend not to HS.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I feel like I&#39;m my own little<br/>
 &gt; island.  Lost in a sea of mainstream ideaology and their vessels are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>eating<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; away my shoreline.  Is it just that I&#39;m in a very conservative state??<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; does this happen to everyone?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I don&#39;t think it happens to everyone to that extent. Yes, a lot of it is<br/>
that you&#39;re in a very conservative state. I count myself very lucky to be<br/>
homeschooling among a huge group of similar-minded moms. While not all my<br/>
homeschool mom friends are &quot;unschoolers&quot; to the full extent of the word, the<br/>
most conservative among them are fairly relaxed occasionally-use-curriculum<br/>
type. I absolutely adore them and look forward to the time we spend<br/>
together. They are my friends in every sense of the word, and I enjoy their<br/>
company at homeschooling occasions and also doing things on our own.<br/>
Yesterday I went and ran a Mother&#39;s Day Half Marathon with one of the other<br/>
homeschooling moms, it was great to have such good company!<br/>
 Then again, I guess it&#39;s not really luck that I&#39;m here. We gave up<br/>
extremely lucrative job/business to come live here and there have been<br/>
months where we barely scrape by. It is definitely worth it to us to have<br/>
the quality of life over the ability to buy material things that we had<br/>
before (though I do miss having enough money to go on vacations right now, I<br/>
would *so* love to come to the conference in SC!)<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve noted that is interesting (this is veering off on a tangent,<br/>
but oh well here goes) is when people post about their unschooling days,<br/>
almost all of the posts I&#39;ve read involved going somewhere and buying<br/>
something - Target, WalMart, whatever. Buying video games or clothes or toys<br/>
or books or going out for food or whatever. That&#39;s one thing we just don&#39;t<br/>
do very much of. I can&#39;t remember the last time I was in a Target or<br/>
Walmart - maybe 6 months ago? I don&#39;t buy books in Borders or Barnes and<br/>
Noble anymore, I get them at the library or borrow them from friends. Our<br/>
clothes are hand-me-downs or thrift stores, and going out to eat (even fast<br/>
food) happens less than once a month. For us, at least, such is the price of<br/>
living here where we have a great support group of like-minded<br/>
homeschoolers, lots of really, really cool kids for our kids to hang out<br/>
with, and plenty of good adult friends for us. Even setting aside<br/>
environmental goals of reducing consumerism, this trade-off has been a very<br/>
positive one.<br/>
But to get back to your original question, I do think it&#39;s natural to drift<br/>
away from people we have less and less in common with. I do still keep in<br/>
touch with my childless friends, but we don&#39;t hang out much together<br/>
anymore. I can&#39;t leave everything at the drop of a hat to go off and do<br/>
something for a weekend and they can. It changes everything. Likewise, I<br/>
have drifted away from friends who do have kids but whose parenting ideals<br/>
are much different from my own. That includes friends whose kids are going<br/>
to school. My kids feel the same way as well. My son rarely asks to play<br/>
with the neighborhood friends that he was once so close to. Once they<br/>
started in to school, *they* changed. They no longer play the same way, they<br/>
tease more, fight more, and have different attitudes towards life that<br/>
perplex him. One mom friend in particular really wants to still get our kids<br/>
together often. The boys used to be the best of friends. It&#39;s getting to the<br/>
point now where I&#39;m going to have to tell her that my son just doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to play with hers anymore. I know she will be hurt by this. Sometimes around<br/>
the other neighborhood moms they will talk about all the problems they&#39;re<br/>
having in school and then look over at me and say something like &quot;I bet<br/>
you&#39;re listening to this and thinking you&#39;re glad that you homeschool,<br/>
right?&quot; I just smile and nod, they&#39;ve said it all for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-945936515">I recently had an opportunity with my sister, matter of fact. She has <br/>
been opposed to us homeschooling until quite recently. Still might <br/>
be, but she doesn&#39;t bring it up anymore. Anyway, she asked what will <br/>
we do when our kids need to take chemistry? L and I said &quot;If they <br/>
need chemistry or are interested in it, Idaho has laws that allow us <br/>
to dual-enroll, so they could take a chemistry class at the high <br/>
school. But, if they&#39;re not going into a field that demands <br/>
chemistry, why should they study it?&quot; And gave the example of my best <br/>
friend&#39;s son, who wants to go into pharmacology, who DID need <br/>
chemistry, and DID take it when the time came. She totally <br/>
understood, when I put it that way. Of course, she is an eyewitness <br/>
to how cool my kids are! :D after seven years of homeschooling! L<br/>

tell me her panicky problems about school, I came to eventually try to be <br/>
dispassionate (keep doing dishes, hear the sounds she was making, but not <br/>
involve myself emotionally in the stury) and when she stopped to breathe I <br/>
would say &quot;You have a choice&quot;  or  &quot;You don&#39;t have to send them back.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just that.<br/>
<br/>
If you say just that to your friend she will either decide &quot;Yes, but I WANT <br/>
to&quot; and realize she shouldn&#39;t tell you her problems, then, OR she can ask <br/>
more about homeschooling.<br/>

But just putting your tiny little verbal-finger up with &quot;You don&#39;t have to&quot; <br/>
