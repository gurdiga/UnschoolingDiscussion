A public school superintendent has sent police in squad cars to the <br/>
houses of homeschooling families to deliver his demand that they <br/>
appear for a &quot;pre-trial hearing&quot; to prove they are in compliance <br/>
with the law. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Though this didn&#39;t even raise a ripple here, I just posted this on another<br/>
list and thought it might be useful here since this is the second scary<br/>
article about threats to homeschooling I&#39;ve seen from WorldNetDaily. And I<br/>
suspect, considering where this leads, that it won&#39;t be the last scary story<br/>
they publish.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to About World Net Daily<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://WorldNetDaily.com/resources/about_WND.asp">http://WorldNetDaily.com/resources/about_WND.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
you find:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; WorldNetDaily.com is a fiercely independent newssite committed to hard-hitting<br/>
&gt; investigative reporting of government waste, fraud and abuse.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Founded by Joseph and Elizabeth Farah in May 1997 as an Internet project of<br/>
&gt; the non-profit Western Journalism Center, WorldNetDaily.com, Inc. began<br/>
&gt; operating as a for-profit corporation Oct. 1, 1999. Now a leading Internet<br/>
&gt; news site in both traffic and influence, WorldNetDaily.com has broken some of<br/>
&gt; the biggest, most significant and most notable investigative and enterprising<br/>
&gt; stories in recent years:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; WorldNetDaily.com&#39;s editorial policy reflects the old-fashioned notion that<br/>
&gt; the principal role of the free press in a free society is to serve as a<br/>
&gt; watchdog on government -- to expose corruption, fraud, waste and abuse<br/>
&gt; wherever and whenever it is found.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which makes it sound pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
But if you Google Joseph Farah and the Western Journalism Center, you&#39;ll<br/>
find the Western Journalism Center was founded by Joseph Farah and James H.<br/>
Smith, the former publisher of the Sacramento Union.<br/>
<br/>
and under the WJC FAQs it says:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2.) Is the WJC conservative, liberal or what?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We subscribe to neither, nor are we the captive of any political party. We<br/>
&gt; pursue the traditional newspaper objective:  We are a &quot;watchdog&quot; on<br/>
&gt; government. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And yet, if you go to:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/clinton/Clintonculwar8-06.htm">http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/clinton/Clintonculwar8-06.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Western Journalism Center, (WSJ) is a project of Joseph Farah, former<br/>
publisher of the ultra-conservative Sacramento Union-once owned by Scaife.<br/>
The Carthage Foundation, controlled by Scaife, is one of the largest funders<br/>
of the WSJ.<br/>
<br/>
And Scaife, from some reports in the Washington Post:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaife">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaife</a><br/>
050299.htm<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Funding Father of Right<br/>
&gt; Part One: May 2, 1999<br/>
&gt; Richard Mellon Scaife, the Pittsburgh billionaire who has financed numerous<br/>
&gt; anti-Clinton activities, helped fund the creation of the modern conservative<br/>
&gt; movement in America. By compiling a computerized record of nearly all his<br/>
&gt; contributions over four decades, The Washington Post found that Scaife and his<br/>
&gt; family&#39;s charitable entities played a central role in the rise of the right,<br/>
&gt; giving at least $340 million to conservative causes and institutions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah. WorldNetDaily may not be &quot;captive of any political party&quot; but they&#39;ve<br/>
got directors and big bucks tied to a *huge* conservative agenda.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to Conservative Web Watch<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There are 3 people profiled: L. Brent Bozell, Joseph Farah, and Christopher<br/>
Ruddy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny how the WorldNetDaily says it:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; currently attracts nearly 2 million unique visitors a month and<br/>
&gt; more than 40 million pageviews, according to its own internal monitoring<br/>
&gt; software. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But if you go to Nielsen/Netratings (the TV program rankers who kept track<br/>
of the most watched TV shows now keep track of the most visited websites to<br/>
advise advertisers where to spend their ad dollars) they some how seem to<br/>
have missed how busy WorldNetDaily is:<br/>
