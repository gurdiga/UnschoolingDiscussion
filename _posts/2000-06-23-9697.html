<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991141283">I bought a book at Borders and after looking it over decided to take it back. <br/>
I had the receipt, and it was within 10 days, and they wouldn&#39;t give me a <br/>
full refund! With a receipt! And furthermore, they only gave me store credit <br/>
and not cash!<br/>
<br/>
I am extremely upset with them, and would advise everyone not to shop there.<br/>
