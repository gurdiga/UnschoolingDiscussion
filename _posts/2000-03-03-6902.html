<div id="ygrps-yiv-135255971">History... what an interesting thought!  My kids are going on 6 and going on<br/>
8, and so far I am delighted about seeing the process of natural learning<br/>
just happening with so little *effort* on my part.  But I am glad you<br/>
brought up the thread of history... I was thinking about it as well just<br/>
this week in fact.  I was listening to a program on CBC radio about whether<br/>
or not we need to emphasize history, and specifically CANADIAN history more<br/>
in the BC curriculum.  It got me to thinking about that... it is important<br/>
to me that young people get a since of the history of their country; their<br/>
heritage etc, as well as a larger since history of human civilization.  I am<br/>
not entirely sure that, as is the case with the three R&#39;s, they will just<br/>
pick this up naturally...<br/>
<br/>
The only solution I have thought of so far is to re-educate myself and then<br/>
share what I am learning in the form of &quot;stories&quot;... and hopefully spawn an<br/>
interest so that later on they will continue to add pieces to the puzzle as<br/>
they present themselves in life.  I like the idea of making it into an<br/>
engrossing tale I can share with them.  It just seems to me this is one area<br/>
where natural learning might require a lot of &quot;homework&quot; on my part!<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to reading other people&#39;s ideas in this regard as<br/>
well...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; we have been homeschooling since my 10yr old arrived at birth.  her sibs<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; an almost 8yr sister, and two brothers almost 4 and 20mos.  we are<br/>
expecting<br/>
&gt; our 5th child to arrive in july.  the way homeschooling has worked for us<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; collaborative learning...  for eg. if i see that10yodd needs some more<br/>
&gt; &quot;substance,&quot; i encourage something and she either agrees or not, and we go<br/>
&gt; from there.  it has worked beautifully as she has not lost a love for<br/>
&gt; learning and is very self motivated, taking on self-created projects<br/>
often.<br/>
&gt; my question involves history.  i hated (who didnt?) the boring historical<br/>
&gt; facts presented in school and therefore remember little of what i parroted<br/>
&gt; back short term to do well.  dd reads voraciously and has read plenty of<br/>
&gt; historical fiction choices, which i assume she will continue to do.  i am<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; sure about presentation of history.  this sonlight curriculum list offers<br/>
&gt; interesting options for a reading list.  and their idea seems to be that<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; can learn history by: a) read the books, and b) plug them into a timeline.<br/>
i<br/>
&gt; am wondering about other ways that your children have acquired a knowledge<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; history, besides randomly, which might work just as well!  especially<br/>
parents<br/>
&gt; of older kids, do you end up having them &quot;do&quot; a course in highschool to<br/>
&gt; satisfy pre-college credit?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972737335">We have an unusual approach to history, which covers medieval history. We go<br/>
to SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism). It is a group that re-encacts the<br/>
middle ages wearing costumes. I do it because it is alot of fun, but it is<br/>
also educational for all of us. There are experts in crafts (needlework,<br/>
spinning, costume making,<br/>
cooking, woodworking,all sorts of things...), herbalism, games, dancing, and<br/>
of course, history of the times. People involved pick a persona which is a<br/>
person they create in history, a name, and research all about the life and<br/>
times of the persona they create, along with their skills and hobbies. I am<br/>
figuring out what my Irish name in the 1500s will be, and think I am a wise<br/>

At SCA events, they often have simulated safe fighting<br/>

There seem to be people willing to share expertise and that will be<br/>
wonderful for Gabe when he is bigger and able to make use of these mentors.<br/>
I am learning alot from them.<br/>

Sharon, can you share how you learned to do things like tan leather and
cook in pit, and make moccasins, and where you got the materials?
<br>This is how we like to do history too.
<br>We also have a history book club.&nbsp; We all read the same book,
and then get together every two weeks.&nbsp; We do an activity, talk about
the book, and usually everyone brings something they have done during that
week.&nbsp; When we read &quot;If you lived with the Cherokee&quot;, we made beads
and corn pone ect...
