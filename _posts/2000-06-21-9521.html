 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve never read it, but have you seen Dr. William Sears&#39; ADD Book? I really respect him in all other areas of parenting that I&#39;ve read, so I wouldn&#39;t doubt I&#39;d agree with what he says regarding ADD. I have a feeling he&#39;ll talk quite a bit about ADD&#39;s connection with food. Has your friend explored that possibility at all?<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-764459961">Hi all,<br/>
I have a friend whose 9 yr old daughter has just been tested and diagnosed<br/>
as ADD and Dyslexic.  Before taking her out of public school she was on<br/>
medication, but only for a short while.<br/>
<br/>
She would like to try something, anything, before putting her child back on<br/>
medication.  I know there are books out there and/or programs which address<br/>
diet and homeopathic remedies.<br/>
<br/>
Can any of you make suggestions?<br/>
TIA<br/>
Cindy</div>
