Indymedia Centers: FBI contacts San Francisco Indymedia over server logs: Indymedia keeps none From Portland IMC<br/>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) contacted volunteers from San Francisco Indymedia on Friday. Agent Chuck Esposito, from the Oakland FBI office, telephoned &quot;Espe&quot;, a volunteer who has worked with the SF Indymedia collective. Esposito indicated that the FBI is interested in reviewing Indymedia server logs. While an alleged criminal act is the stated reason for the inquiry, activists feel it is not beyond the pale to suspect that this contact is meant to intimidate individuals and organizations involved in legal political acvitity whose views are not popular with the government in the current climate of war-time repression. | Protecting your electronic rights<br/>
Sierra Club: Congress Pressures Sierra Club To Name ELF, ALF As Terrorists<br/>
This from our newswire: The House Subcommittee on Forests and Forest Health has sent a letter to the Sierra Club asking us to disavow the Earth Liberation Front and the Animal Liberation Front, calling them terrorist cells.
