I would think it would be difficult for a tutor to be able to &quot;get&quot; <br/>
unschooling. Because then there would be no need for a tutor and she would be <br/>
out of a job. A conflict of interest for her as I see it. <br/>

How can you tutor an unschooler?<br/>
What about just hiring an afternoon babysitter/mothers helper, who <br/>
can play games, take walks, read books....whatever the child wants to <br/>
do.  It would probably be way cheaper and a lot more fun.<br/>

I agree with Joanna absolutely about the &quot;way cheaper&quot; but...<br/>
<br/>
You might give the tutor some John Holt or unschooling stuff to read, and ask <br/>
her to try natural learning.  This will be a subversive act which might <br/>
culminate in the benefit of every student she comes in contact with for the <br/>
rest of her life.  I did a little tutoring years ago, but I was never able to <br/>
do it without individualization, creativity, humor and playing games.  They <br/>
were grammar and writing situations, I accepted money (not much, because I <br/>
knew the families) and I did it toward the magic-act end of things.  &quot;What <br/>
does your teacher want and how can you fake doing it?&quot; while showing them the <br/>
amusing, amazing parts of what they already knew.<br/>
<br/>
IF a tutor filled with ranks and levels and visions of showing progress were <br/>
to be given guidelines which she can&#39;t cross, then it would become an <br/>
educational game for her, and she would learn some things she might not have <br/>
learned in school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d give that a shot first.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s of the mind that she&#39;s a professional and doesn&#39;t take advice from <br/>
non-educators, then yeah--go for paying a nice teenager $5 an hour to play <br/>
and read.<br/>
