So you can be your kids&#39; best teacher simply by turning them loose in <br/>
your basement, backyard, or garage. On their own they&#39;ll discover <br/>
hundreds of ways to get smarter, with little prompting and no money <br/>
changing hands. Using simple things like muffin tins, scrap wood, <br/>
recycled cans, and old shoes, they can launch a learning festival <br/>
that will run for years. ~~ Laurel Schmidt in Seven Times Smarter <br/>

BIG HAIRY AUDACIOUS GOALS<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/183.html">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/183.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Last spring I learned an acronym that changed the lives of my kids: <br/>
B-HAG - Big Hairy Audacious Goals. My husband&#39;s company set their <br/>
long-term goals using that term and I thought, &quot;Aha! Perfect for <br/>
homeschool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I asked my kids what big, hairy, audacious, sky&#39;s-the-limit kind <br/>
of goals they would like to pursue while they&#39;re still kids at home. <br/>
I was startled by the clarity and unique vision of each child.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest son, Noah (13), said that he&#39;d like to act in a Shakespeare <br/>
play, learn to design computer games and play the piano. Piano, it <br/>
turns out, was the secret passion of Noah&#39;s heart. He had wanted <br/>
lessons for years and began to well up with tears when he told me <br/>
that his life would be happy if he could just learn how to play. <br/>
Gulp! How come I hadn&#39;t known that?<br/>
<br/>
Next in line was my daughter, Johannah (11). She reeled off two <br/>
enormous projects that took my breath away. She wants to produce a <br/>
Jane Austen-style ball instead of a high school prom for herself and <br/>
other homeschooled friends. In order to do it, she needs to take <br/>
vintage dance lessons, then hold classes to teach these dances to <br/>
other kids. In addition, she plans to learn how to sew the dresses <br/>
from that era so that she can make costumes.<br/>
<br/>
Her second goal (as if that one didn&#39;t already overwhelm me) is to <br/>
direct her own production of A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream. &quot;And I&#39;m <br/>
going to do it, Mom,&quot; she told me emphatically. I didn&#39;t doubt her!<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, school provided me with sensible goals that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t interfere with my parents&#39; lives too much. I wasn&#39;t taught <br/>
to dream about bigger-than-life projects that would require driving <br/>
all over kingdom come or that would oblige my family to participate <br/>
in my areas of interest. Instead, I joined the pre-fab school <br/>
organizations that offered me bite-sized experiences of the interests <br/>
I had. Certainly some of my teachers rose above the mediocrity and <br/>
contributed profoundly to my life, but on the whole, most of my <br/>
school life was keenly managed and required mere compliance from me. <br/>
I didn&#39;t own the experiences and I certainly didn&#39;t orchestrate them.<br/>
<br/>
Enter the B-HAG into our family. Suddenly I&#39;m on a radical learning <br/>
curve led by my kids. It dawned on me that instead of micro-managing <br/>
their experiences, I could throw myself into their big dreams by <br/>
offering the kind of support that an adult can give to a young person <br/>
- I can drive, I can look stuff up in the phone book, on the Internet <br/>
and in the community papers, I can fix hair to look like Lizzie <br/>
Bennett.<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t have to muster is the energy to &quot;get up&quot; for these <br/>
activities. We&#39;ve found that the B-HAG itself drives our children to <br/>
a level of motivation that releases energy throughout the family.  ~ <br/>

NEW MEXICAN HOMESCHOOLERS WIN!<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers in New Mexico worked hard to change an oppressive <br/>
homeschool law that required mandatory testing and THEY WON! No more <br/>
state-mandated testing for these homeschoolers. The relevant section <br/>
of the law reads as follows:<br/>
<br/>
45th Legislature, First Session, Laws 2001, Chapter 62,<br/>
Senate Bill 374 as amended<br/>
22-1-2.1 HOME SCHOOL -- REQUIREMENTS.-- Any person operating or <br/>
intending to operate a home school shall:<br/>
A. within thirty days of its establishment, notify the state <br/>
superintendent of the establishment of a home school within thirty <br/>
days of its establishment and notify the state superintendent in <br/>
writing on or before April 1 of each subsequent year of operation of <br/>
the school district from which the home school is drawing students;<br/>
B. maintain records of student disease immunization or a waiver of <br/>
that requirement; and<br/>
C. provide instruction by a person possessing at least a high school <br/>
diploma or its equivalent.<br/>
Congratulations New Mexico homeschoolers, on a job well done! You can <br/>

Most of us have forgotten what it was like to follow our own noses, <br/>
to ask our own questions and find our own answers. Years of <br/>
educational treatment have convinced us that learning is, and can <br/>
only be, the result of teaching. We grow up into adults who insist <br/>
that our children &quot;receive&quot; an education. We trust neither ourselves <br/>
nor our children.<br/>

<br/>
DON&#39;T YOU JUST HATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS!<br/>
<br/>
Two months ago I sent the plea below, asking you to ask me questions. <br/>
Two weeks ago, during a hard drive spring cleaning, my email programs <br/>
were deleted. I don&#39;t know how many emails you&#39;ve saved over the past <br/>
7 years, but I lost a bunch-including all the wonderful questions <br/>
readers had sent me. So if you sent me a question and I told you I&#39;d <br/>
consider answering it in a future column, that probably won&#39;t happen <br/>
unless you are kind enough to send it again. If you didn&#39;t send me a <br/>
question, don&#39;t let this mishap deter you! I&#39;m backing everything up <br/>
these days and I&#39;d love to hear what you have to say.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have questions about homeschooling that you never seem to find <br/>
the answer for? Are you struggling with a part of homeschooling that <br/>
you&#39;d like to get advice about? Is there a question you&#39;d like to see <br/>
answered so you can show the answer to friends or family who don&#39;t <br/>
seem to get what homeschoolers do? If you answered yes to any of MY <br/>
questions, this is your chance to send YOUR question to me! In every <br/>
issue of Home Education Magazine, I answer one or two questions in a <br/>
column called Ask Carol. Some of the questions I&#39;ve been asked are:<br/>
<br/>
* Can I homeschool if I have a tattoo and ride a Harley?<br/>
* What if my kids won&#39;t work?<br/>
* How can I unschool and still test?<br/>
* How can I homeschool with a toddler in the house?<br/>
<br/>
If you have a troubling or intriguing question, a funny or serious <br/>
question, or just want to dig a little deeper into homeschooling <br/>
issues, let me know by sending an email to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AskCarol@...">AskCarol@...</a>. Or you can send a letter by snail mail <br/>
to Carol Narigon c/o Home Education Magazine, PO Box 1083, Tonasket <br/>
WA 98855.<br/>
<br/>
Questions will be edited for length and clarity.<br/>

&quot;What would a world without school be like? Without certified <br/>
experts? Without forced associations? Coerced tests and grades? <br/>
Arbitrary rules? We don&#39;t mean just for children, but for all of <br/>
society. What would the ripple effects be? In Chicken Run, Ginger <br/>
said, &quot;You know what the problem is here. The fence isn&#39;t just around <br/>
the farm. It&#39;s up here, in your heads.&quot; This is our humble attempt at <br/>
tearing down the fence in our heads.<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling.org will post original articles exploring the effects of <br/>
compulsory schooling on society and what a world returned to <br/>
intellectual liberty might look like. We are firm believers in the <br/>
moral imperative of liberty, so Illich&#39;s...insight (read it at the <br/>
website) will be applied using liberty as our prism.&quot;<br/>

CRITTERS<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nahee.org">http://www.nahee.org</a><br/>
<br/>
Why do deer have smelly feet? What animal is the world&#39;s best jumper? <br/>
When do chickens do the cha-cha? What happens if you tickle a rat? <br/>
Find out with the KIND News Book of Critter Clues and the KIND News <br/>
Book of Critter Views, two books that are sure to be a hit with your <br/>
homeschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
Recently published by the nonprofit National Association for Humane <br/>
and Environmental Education (NAHEE), these pocket-sized books make <br/>
reading, learning, and natural science a blast with their kid- <br/>
friendly formats and quirky facts about animals and their behaviors. <br/>
Both books can be used by students alone or in groups, while <br/>
homeschooling parents can easily incorporate them into their lessons.<br/>
<br/>
The KIND News Book of Critter Clues features fun (and tricky) clues <br/>
to 30 familiar wild animals and pets. Answer keys reveal the <br/>
identities of mystery critters plus fascinating facts about their <br/>
behaviors, history and habitats. The KIND News Book of Critter Views <br/>
is packed with humorous illustrations and amazing but true tales from <br/>
the world of animals. Information for the books was culled from KIND <br/>
(Kids In Nature&#39;s Defense) News, NAHEE&#39;s award-winning newspaper for <br/>
elementary school-age children.<br/>
<br/>
The KIND News Book of Critter Clues and the KIND News Book of Critter <br/>
Views are priced at just $2.50 each. To order online, visit <br/>
www.nahee.org.<br/>
<br/>
(Editor&#39;s note: My 10-year-old animal lover reviewed the Critter <br/>
books and here&#39;s what she has to say: &quot;As for Critter Clues, it was a <br/>
wonderful, interesting book with lots of info on the habits and <br/>
strange preferences of many different animals, including humans. <br/>
Critter Views was great, with creative illustrations and weird, fun <br/>
facts. For example, I didn&#39;t know shrews eat three times their small <br/>
weight every day!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
SEVEN TIMES SMARTER<br/>
<br/>
All of those books based on Howard Gardner&#39;s seven (eight now) <br/>
intelligences are innovative, interesting and really hit home for <br/>
many homeschoolers, but how do you put the theory into practical use <br/>
in your own home? Laurel Schmidt&#39;s book Seven Time Smarter: 50 <br/>
Activities, Games, and Projects to Develop the Seven Intelligences of <br/>
Your Child can not only help, most of the activities are perfect for <br/>
unschooling and homeschooling families. In fact, Schmidt says about <br/>
schools, &quot;With all these ways of being smart, why do so many kids <br/>
feel dumb? One big reason is school, which can be a crushing <br/>
experience for any kid, unless they have strong linguistic and <br/>
mathematical intelligence...So you can be your kids&#39; best teacher <br/>
simply by turning them loose in your basement, backyard, or garage. <br/>
On their own they&#39;ll discover hundreds of ways to get smarter, with <br/>
little prompting, and no money changing hands.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Schmidt believes parents should let kids explore and create on their <br/>
own. For instance, she recommends making &quot;un-models&quot; by throwing away <br/>
the instructions for model kits and letting kids put them together <br/>
their own way or by mixing up the pieces of several models and seeing <br/>
what they come up with. She&#39;s also a big fan of boredom, believing as <br/>
many homeschoolers do that boredom encourages imagination. Kids are <br/>
much more likely to build a fort from tables and sheets if they <br/>
aren&#39;t being shuttled from one &quot;enrichment&quot; opportunity to another. <br/>
You provide the sheets and card tables.<br/>
<br/>
Eleven chapters show you ways to encourage your child&#39;s creativity <br/>
and intelligence, mostly using materials you have around the house or <br/>
recycled &quot;junk.&quot; Each chapter offers several options, geared toward <br/>
the particular intelligences, for investigating different topics <br/>
including families and self; movement and sound; odds and ends <br/>
(junk); writing; handmade tasks; books; art; out-of-doors and your <br/>
community. Many of the sections in the chapters also include a list <br/>
of books or other resources to encourage reading and further <br/>
exploration.<br/>
<br/>
Seven Times Smarter is available through your favorite bookseller or <br/>
from Amazon.com for $15.00 ($12 at Amazon).<br/>

FINAL WORD<br/>
<br/>
We provide time for doing the thinking. Doing schoolwork is learning <br/>
about other folks&#39; thoughts, but doing your own thinking is what <br/>
counts. Time for playing, time for experimenting, time for just <br/>
sitting and pondering--these are the luxuries that gift the child <br/>
with thinking skills beyond the ordinary.<br/>
