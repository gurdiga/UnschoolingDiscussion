&gt; black dot here refers to this key on the piano, and we call it C.  We could<br/>
&gt; call it George, or Fudnups, or whatever, but we call it C.  It&#39;s giving a<br/>
&gt; name and a symbol to something that any pianist would understand, but <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know how to put into writing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Or learning how to knit. I learned by DOing. I can&#39;t read directions. I can <br/>
knit and purl and even do cables. I&#39;m very fast and have very even tension. <br/>
But I have to kind of &quot;fake&quot; it. I plan to learn to read directions so that I <br/>
can follow a pattern. It ought to be pretty easy when I&#39;m ready! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
