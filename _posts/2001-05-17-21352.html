&lt;&lt;  Stress causes bad<br/>
effects to your brain chemistry. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not just brain--other systems too.<br/>
<br/>
But the belief about stress is common among many.  I&#39;m sure it was a <br/>
justification put on opressive child-rearing practices by some of the more <br/>
compassionate among them.  My mother-in-law is elderly (80&#39;s) and was a nurse <br/>
and raised three kids.  She was appalled by our kindnesses to our kids.  She <br/>
said we HAD to frustrate them, it was part of growing up.  I told her there <br/>
were natural frustrations and natural consequences and I wasn&#39;t going to <br/>
trump any up.<br/>
<br/>
I know all her kids.  My husband&#39;s two brothers were just here for three <br/>
days.  I have heard stories from all of them about the growing-up years.  <br/>
They lied to their parents, they were sneaky, one ran away, their mother was <br/>
cold...<br/>
<br/>
My kids are nicer and more thoughtful and considerate than hers were then (if <br/>
their stories are accurate, and their stories are told in best-light, too) or <br/>
are now.  They handle stress better than I do.<br/>
<br/>
If the stress/frustration theory is correct, shouldn&#39;t we hold our kids at <br/>
knifepoint from time to time and threaten their lives so if they&#39;re ever <br/>
attacked in an alley they won&#39;t pee their pants.  Should we break their <br/>
fingers so if they ever get a broken arm or leg they&#39;ll be prepared for the <br/>
pain?<br/>
<br/>
Analogies all make it look as dumb as it is.  But the cliches of traditional <br/>
European child-rearing &quot;science&quot; make it look inarguable because there are <br/>
religious practices and state and county social work principles and school <br/>
systems based on that very idea, that you have to learn to live with people <br/>
you don&#39;t like, and you have to learn to accept teachers you can&#39;t stand, <br/>
etc., because you have to prepare for &quot;the real world.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I believe it&#39;s wrong.  If I believed it was right, my kids would be in school.<br/>

<br/>
Do you think Native Americans parents one and two generations ago would<br/>
have been less likely to accept the Prussian model, and European American<br/>
parents more likely to embrace it?  Both of my maternal grandparents had<br/>
German last names, so I think the Prussian tradition comes down a bit in my<br/>
family.  Fortunately my mom was kind of a pre-hippie type, educated at<br/>
Berkeley, and caught the counter-culture wave early.  She breastfed me in<br/>
1959 when rates of breastfeeding were abysmally low.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the key thing I don&#39;t like about Prussian ideas are the ideas that<br/>
human systems of interaction can be managed as if they were machinery. <br/>

<br/>
Lots of childrearing belief and practice in this country is based on English <br/>
and German medical and psychological belief, but at the time schools were <br/>
starting up in the Western U.S. Germany wasn&#39;t an influencing factor in the <br/>
way the one-room rural schoolhouses with local school boards were set up.  <br/>

Thank you, thank you.   I  have been unsuccessful in formulating a simple<br/>
response to the &quot;history&quot;  that has  gained the acceptance of  many urban<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-371788562">The term that Hilliary made so icky to some, &quot;it takes a village&quot; is the<br/>
basis for American Indian learning up until the advent of the U.S.<br/>
government passing laws stating that Indians were not humans and had no<br/>
rights given to humans.  This was used to remove all Indian children from<br/>
their homes and ship them off to boarding schools where the worst of the<br/>
worse parts of the Prussian model were practiced.  They were all given<br/>
Buster Brown haircuts (boys and girls) and dressed in white uniforms.  They<br/>
were denied their language and religion and punished for practicing either.<br/>
They were also punished for getting their uniforms dirty.  How exactly they<br/>
were suppose to play, be children and still keep white uniforms white is<br/>
beyond me!<br/>
<br/>
Those children that were not shipped off to boarding schools were forced to<br/>
attend church run schools on the reservations.  Same haircuts and uniforms<br/>
were required.  The treatment was brutal because it was &quot;o.k.&quot; to beat and<br/>
torture Indian children because they weren&#39;t &quot;human.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which does not exactly answer your question but gives you a foundation for<br/>
the answer.<br/>
<br/>
The American Indians did not embrace the concept but they were given no<br/>
choice.  There are currently several lawsuits going on where &quot;survivors&quot; are<br/>
sueing the church schools for the physical and mental abuse they received<br/>
under their &quot;care.&quot;  However, some of those that were raised in the system<br/>
have embraced the system.  And there is a lot of propaganda out there now<br/>
(good ol&#39; government push) telling them that the only way their children<br/>
will get out of the live cycle of poverty and alcoholism is to push them<br/>
through ps and get that diploma.<br/>
<br/>
The Europeans were use to a more controlled life style.  They (most) had<br/>
been under some sort of control since written history and even before<br/>
that--rulers, churches, etc.  I don&#39;t think there was much of a transition<br/>
from one type of control to another type of control.  It was something they<br/>
simply didn&#39;t question.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, that is why homeschooling, in particular, and generally, any freedom<br/>
of choice style (LLL, unschooling, midwives, homebirths, simplified living,<br/>
alternative life styles) are so hard for the average person to accept.  The<br/>
ps system, here and elsewhere in the world, is geared to train people to not<br/>
question certain basic facts (these may be different depending on the<br/>
country/religion/school).  To do so is considered abnormal and those that do<br/>
so are considered rebellious, different and a threat.  And most folks want<br/>
to fit in, be part of something, belong to something whether they realise it<br/>
or not.  Ye ol&#39; herd instinct, doncha know.<br/>
<br/>
You even see it in unschooling &lt;g&gt; with *the* definition, joining<br/>
unschooling support groups, *doing* unschooling the *right* way, etc.<br/>

I didn&#39;t think it was an American Indian quote.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought it was African.  Can anyone confirm or deny?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is not so.  &quot;It takes a village&quot; was not ANY justification for taking <br/>
kids to boarding schools.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They were all given<br/>
Buster Brown haircuts (boys and girls) and dressed in white uniforms. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps in one school you know of.  To make a claim like all Indian boarding <br/>
schools wore white uniforms is simply to supply misinformation.  And to claim <br/>
that they cut the hair of all the girls is false.  Boys, most likely.<br/>
<br/>
I live where there were still Indian schools very lately (still might be St. <br/>
Katherines&#39; in Santa Fe, but if so, haircutting even for boys is long, long <br/>
gone), and what you&#39;ve written is not applicable.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; They<br/>
were denied their language and religion and punished for practicing either.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is true, but that&#39;s was also true in public schools of children speaking <br/>
LOTS of languages even until lately, and probably even today in some places.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Those children that were not shipped off to boarding schools were forced to<br/>
attend church run schools on the reservations.  Same haircuts and uniforms<br/>
were required.  The treatment was brutal because it was &quot;o.k.&quot; to beat and<br/>
torture Indian children because they weren&#39;t &quot;human.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Where are you getting this information?<br/>
<br/>
Last time I asked for resources you said you had classified sources and then <br/>
denied saying it.  <br/>
<br/>
Please, please--tell what is true or don&#39;t tell anything.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Which does not exactly answer your question but gives you a foundation for<br/>
the answer....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Answers should be founded in documentable truth when possible, and direct <br/>
account when possible.  Sources and quotes, please.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not questioning the evils of Indian schools.  I&#39;m questioning your <br/>
assertion of details as thought there was one overall model of boarding <br/>
school, or one overall group of Indians.<br/>

I think more what was said or implied is &quot;we aren&#39;t going to let your<br/>

It bugs me that the concept &quot;it takes a village (or a community)&quot; gets<br/>

worse parts of the Prussian model were practiced.  They were all given<br/>
Buster Brown haircuts (boys and girls) and dressed in white uniforms.  They<br/>
were denied their language and religion and punished for practicing either.<br/>
They were also punished for getting their uniforms dirty.  How exactly they<br/>
were suppose to play, be children and still keep white uniforms white is<br/>
beyond me!<br/>
<br/>
Those children that were not shipped off to boarding schools were forced to<br/>
attend church run schools on the reservations.  Same haircuts and uniforms<br/>
were required.  The treatment was brutal because it was &quot;o.k.&quot; to beat and<br/>
torture Indian children because they weren&#39;t &quot;human.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which does not exactly answer your question but gives you a foundation for<br/>
the answer.<br/>
<br/>
The American Indians did not embrace the concept but they were given no<br/>
choice.  There are currently several lawsuits going on where &quot;survivors&quot; are<br/>
sueing the church schools for the physical and mental abuse they received<br/>
under their &quot;care.&quot;  However, some of those that were raised in the system<br/>
have embraced the system.  And there is a lot of propaganda out there now<br/>
(good ol&#39; government push) telling them that the only way their children<br/>
will get out of the live cycle of poverty and alcoholism is to push them<br/>
through ps and get that diploma.<br/>
<br/>
The Europeans were use to a more controlled life style.  They (most) had<br/>
been under some sort of control since written history and even before<br/>
that--rulers, churches, etc.  I don&#39;t think there was much of a transition<br/>
from one type of control to another type of control.  It was something they<br/>
simply didn&#39;t question.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, that is why homeschooling, in particular, and generally, any freedom<br/>
of choice style (LLL, unschooling, midwives, homebirths, simplified living,<br/>
alternative life styles) are so hard for the average person to accept.  The<br/>
ps system, here and elsewhere in the world, is geared to train people to not<br/>
question certain basic facts (these may be different depending on the<br/>
country/religion/school).  To do so is considered abnormal and those that do<br/>
so are considered rebellious, different and a threat.  And most folks want<br/>
to fit in, be part of something, belong to something whether they realise it<br/>
or not.  Ye ol&#39; herd instinct, doncha know.<br/>
<br/>
You even see it in unschooling &lt;g&gt; with *the* definition, joining<br/>
unschooling support groups, *doing* unschooling the *right* way, etc.<br/>

&gt; Hi, Lynda --<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you think Native Americans parents one and two generations ago would<br/>
&gt; have been less likely to accept the Prussian model, and European American<br/>
&gt; parents more likely to embrace it?  Both of my maternal grandparents had<br/>
&gt; German last names, so I think the Prussian tradition comes down a bit in<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; family.  Fortunately my mom was kind of a pre-hippie type, educated at<br/>
&gt; Berkeley, and caught the counter-culture wave early.  She breastfed me in<br/>
&gt; 1959 when rates of breastfeeding were abysmally low.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe the key thing I don&#39;t like about Prussian ideas are the ideas that<br/>
&gt; human systems of interaction can be managed as if they were machinery.<br/>
&gt; Ick.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287943845">It wasn&#39;t that they used that phrase but more that it is pharse understood<br/>
today and works as a modern day explanation of how things were.  Children<br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;belong&quot; to individual parents.  Something that we hear so much<br/>
now--&quot;Those are MY children&quot;  &quot;I will raise them the way I want&quot;  etc., etc.<br/>
etc.  More like children are chattel than small people that are a gift put<br/>
into our care to raise with love and consideration.<br/>
<br/>
Children learned from all elders in a tribe.  Children learned from whomever<br/>
was doing whatever it was that they needed/wanted to learn.  The &quot;village&quot;<br/>
raised the child.  There were no orphans or even a word for &quot;orphan&quot; in most<br/>
tribes.<br/>

<br/>
But that&#39;s what teachers say about bullies in school.  &quot;Just ignore them and<br/>
they&#39;ll stop.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand perhaps there is no way to stop a bully whatsoever, and<br/>
those afflicted with being picked on have to just endure it like a disease<br/>
and not complain to others around them.  Suffer with dignity and all...<br/>
<br/>
Is it ever appropriate to ask bullies to stop?<br/>
-------<br/>
<br/>
Appropriate? Heck yes. Successful? Sigh. Not usually, in my experience.<br/>
Usually, they have to BE stopped.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what the list rules are in such matters (and I can&#39;t go read<br/>
archives or list guidelines or anything - Yahoo and I are having<br/>
relationship problems and it won&#39;t speak to me).<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s family was here for Mother&#39;s Day. My sister in law was talking<br/>
about her step-daughter (who wasn&#39;t here, was at her Mom&#39;s house that<br/>
weekend) and saying that Jenny was worried about going to junior high<br/>
school, because many of the kids there were not nice. My sil made some<br/>
off-hand remark that Jenny needed to adjust as this was &quot;the real world&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Well, you probably will guess I couldn&#39;t let THAT go by. &lt;g&gt; I said, &quot;You<br/>
know, I live in the real world and in my real world I don&#39;t spend much time<br/>
legitimately worried about people beating me up.&quot; And because my sil is not<br/>
a moron &lt;g&gt; it morphed into a rather interesting conversation about peer<br/>
pressure, etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
Here on this list, in my opinion and observation, Lynda is using words to<br/>
beat Sandra up. I find most of Lynda&#39;s posts that target Sandra as<br/>
incomprehensible as a bully&#39;s fists. I have no power to stop her. I will,<br/>
since I think it&#39;s a fair request, also ask her to stop. I hope I&#39;m wrong in<br/>
my estimation of my request&#39;s potential for success.<br/>
<br/>
And, in case the asking is a failure, I will also ask someone to snip<br/>
anything relevant from the list guidelines about targeting posters, removal<br/>
from lists, etc. And I will also ask the list moderator to consider the<br/>
effect (and cause) of this on the list in general.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, would like to talk about unschooling, but not at the cost of<br/>
ignoring muggings on our virtual playground.<br/>
