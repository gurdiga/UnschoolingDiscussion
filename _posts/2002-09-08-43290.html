now just going through all the stuff I missed. Not sure if this got posted <br/>
or not but I would really LOVE a response in the way of &quot;have you tried <br/>
this&quot; or &quot;this might work&quot; from SOMEONE!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, my question was in no way meant to reflect on anything you<br/>
did with your kids. I was asking on behalf of myself and my kids.<br/>
My son is rather an old soul and so very different from our other 3.<br/>
Much more complex. He just doesn&#39;t get keeping his hands to himself<br/>
with his sister. I also don&#39;t go with the never hit thing and have<br/>
explained that whole scenario. He gets that, he understands that it&#39;s<br/>
not nice to hit or even productive within the family. But when his<br/>
sister frustrates him, like I know she&#39;s good at doing, he just<br/>
smacks her without thinking. He knows he shouldn&#39;t, he admits to me<br/>
that he did it and why. I just can&#39;t seem to get him to come to me or<br/>
say something to her first. His first reaction is to pop her one. Now<br/>
it&#39;s not really bad.(meaning she&#39;s not really physically hurt) He doesn&#39;t <br/>
use anything but his hand and it&#39;s<br/>
not a punch or anything and she gets very dramatic when he does it.<br/>
The whole thing ends up a major deal on both parts. Whatever I&#39;ve<br/>
been saying isn&#39;t getting it.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t happen every day but enough for me to worry why I can&#39;t<br/>
solve this. You can tell right away he&#39;s sorry he does it but just<br/>
doesn&#39;t think about it first. We&#39;ve worked out together all kinds of<br/>
other ways for him to solve the problem but when the time comes, he<br/>
doesn&#39;t use any of them. These are the 2 that are 13 months apart.<br/>
They are almost 7 and 8. She&#39;s the younger one.<br/>
