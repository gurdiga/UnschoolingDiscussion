&gt; An extremely valid point and observation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My objective was to try to clear some of the smoke of an ongoing <br/>
&gt; smouldering and firey debate.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since noboby argues nearly as much about chores.. since it falls into the <br/>
&gt; parenting sector... I thought the TV would also... and some of the smoke <br/>
&gt; would clear.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When we talk about chores, I never know how to categorize whether we have <br/>
them or not. My son, Julian, does TONS around the house, and certain jobs <br/>
have kind of become &quot;his.&quot;  For example, Julian does all the family&#39;s laundry <br/>
(except for folding and putting away. He enjoys it, and doesn&#39;t mind the long <br/>
trip to the basement carrying heavy stuff. He is NOT reponsible for <br/>
remembering to do it or staying on top of it -- if we notice we&#39;re piling up, <br/>
or if we need a particualr garment, we&#39;ll ask if he minds doing a load. He <br/>
never does.<br/>
<br/>
We now have three large people in this house (Julian is tallest, at twelve), <br/>
and we all manage to keep the house this side of disaster. But no one is <br/>
punished or responsible for the whole thing.  I do think about what happens <br/>
when he leaves--the work load will increase significantly!<br/>
