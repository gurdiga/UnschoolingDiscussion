&lt;&lt; Hello wise peolpe,<br/>
<br/>
I have a unique situation I need  some help thinking throrgh before I act. My <br/>
son, 7 got in a fight during a parkday.  Specifics are he wanted to check out <br/>
a toy, the boy who brought the sword would not share. When the sword was down <br/>
on the ground my son picked it up to check it out. Owner ran after him, grab <br/>
tackled him, my son reacted by fighting and kicked him hard. I was the parent <br/>
who sprinted to stop this, out in the field. It lasted all of 15 seconds. The <br/>
boys split, the one who owned the sword was hurt from my son. My son needed <br/>
away time for cool down so I left him alone. During the next 5 minutes I chatted <br/>
with the mom and the boy, making sure he was ok. He was a bit hysterical <br/>
about other things talking about trying to do what his counslers say to do <br/>
etc.They left without waiting for my kid to come over, so the boys did not get a <br/>
chance to talk through what happened. Well, the mom called the police who showed <br/>
up at my door a few days later. She did not try to contact me after the <br/>
incident. She told the police I was overprotective of my son and she wanted it <br/>
documented that he battered her child.<br/>
<br/>
What do you all think I should do? My son and I have talked about the group, <br/>
he actually doesn&#39;t like the kids there that much so one option is to just <br/>
drop hanging out with them. The group is active, I like the families and have <br/>
been attending for several years. This mom is relatively new, she often has <br/>
personal toys with her that her child does not share and which causes similar <br/>
conflicts. Part of me wants to open this up to the other 50 members for discussion, <br/>
but I hesitate to. My husband is a bit freaked out because the officer said <br/>
the family could press civil charges against us for this. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
They *could* press any kind of charges they want.  I don&#39;t think it  would <br/>
get very far.  It&#39;s a &quot;school yard&quot; fight amongst 7 year olds.   Your child was <br/>
tackled and could have been hurt as well.  It doesn&#39;t appear  to me that any <br/>
bullying was going on.  <br/>
 <br/>
What did the police say about the incident?  <br/>
 <br/>
Did the other child suffer a broken limb or anything like that?  How  bad was <br/>
he hurt?  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d like to know more about that before I say anything else.  About  the <br/>
support group, though...we&#39;ve had a similar thing happen in a  group.  It was a <br/>
much younger kid whacking a much bigger kid with a  limb.  It was a particularly <br/>
aggressive little boy, and others were often  complaining about how he <br/>
behaved with his weapons.  It became a serious  issue after this incident.  <br/>
 <br/>
His mother was finally shocked into seeing what others had been saying, and  <br/>
she took decisive action.  I think the outcome was good, but this  particular <br/>
mother was interested in making things better.  Sometimes  mothers are <br/>
irrational and can&#39;t see beyond their own child&#39;s injury, no matter  how slight.<br/>
 <br/>
I think it was useful for our group to deal with the issue as a  whole.  We <br/>
didn&#39;t have a meeting or anything, but we had lots of phone  calls.  It was a <br/>
topic of conversation.  There has to be someone there  who can strongly <br/>
advocate for the peace, and for the cohesion of the group,  too.  Not everyone is <br/>
going to be completely happy with how it shakes out,  but that&#39;s life.  Julie <br/>
will probably have something to say about that  incident, and what&#39;s happened <br/>
since.  <br/>
 <br/>
The important thing, I think, is that if someone has a problem that makes  <br/>
their experience unpleasant, and they desire to continue getting the other  <br/>
benefits of the group, that it should be addressed in some way.  Go to the  most <br/>
active and forceful leader or facilitator of the group and tell her what  has <br/>
happened.  Tell her what you&#39;ve told us.  Ask her advice and if  she doesn&#39;t <br/>
think it&#39;s big enough to talk about, go to the next one.  Of  course, this <br/>
depends on how much you want to fight for the group.  I  wouldn&#39;t be secretive <br/>
about it.  I would talk to the other mother directly  about it, too.  Apologize <br/>
for the kicking, without pointing a finger.   Give her an opportunity to take <br/>
responsibility for what her son did, as  well.  I look forward to hearing more <br/>
about the police.<br/>

that can invite all sorts of hard feelings about &quot;not sharing&quot;, and <br/>
that perhaps he should choose a toy to bring that he would be <br/>
willing to share. Judging from the boy&#39;s reaction, she probably <br/>
didnt have that conversation with him, unfortunately. Do other kids <br/>
bring toys they don&#39;t share or is it mostly this kid? <br/>
<br/>
I dont have a whole lot of support group experience, but i would <br/>
think that it might be good to bring up the subject of toys, and how <br/>
to avoid this in the future. The one group that i&#39;ve occasionally <br/>
attended is held in a library, kids bring toys to play with, and it <br/>
would be a little strange to not share them (the whole point is to <br/>
share them, to play with the other kids.) It seems reasonable to me, <br/>
that if a child brings a toy, sets it down and is done with it, the <br/>
child who picks it up shouldnt be tackled to the ground. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well, the mom called the police who showed  up at my door a few <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a very nonconfrontational person, but this would really piss me <br/>
off. I would call her. I think its terrible that she called the <br/>
police instead of talking to you about it. <br/>
<br/>
Once, when my son was probably 4 or 5 yrs old, we were at McDonald&#39;s <br/>
playplace, and he was twirling around with a small plastic toy in <br/>
his hand. A little toddler wandered by and he accidentally smacked <br/>
the kid in the face really hard, and the little boy was hysterical. <br/>
I tried to apologize to the parents and they looked at us like we <br/>
were evil, like my son was out of control or did it on purpose. It <br/>
was really uncomfortable. I thought they would say something <br/>
like &quot;Its ok, we know it was an accident&quot; but they didnt. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If your son doesnt *want* to hang out with them, independant of this <br/>
situation, then i wouldnt make him go. But i wouldnt want to drop <br/>
out just because of this situation, because i dont think your son <br/>
was the one who was wrong here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Part of me wants to open this up to the other 50 members for <br/>

&gt;against us for this. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would ask the other members of the group about it, about how <br/>
personal toys can cause these sorts of problems. I would do it <br/>
openly, so it doesnt look like you are trying to get people &quot;on your <br/>
side&quot; behind the other mother&#39;s back. I wouldnt worry too much about <br/>
any charges, her son attacked your son and he defended himself (too <br/>
well, it seems.) I wouldnt hesitate to tell her that either. Your <br/>
son could &quot;press charges&quot; against hers for starting the fight. The <br/>
point is not who &quot;wins&quot; or who is hurt more, they were both <br/>
involved, they both are held accountable. I think its ridiculous <br/>
though that the other mother would even involve the police, it <br/>
sounds like she has more issues than her son. Maybe she called the <br/>
police first because she thought you might?<br/>
<br/>
I know its really unsettling when a cop shows up at your door, but i <br/>
dont think there will be much more made out of the situation on <br/>
their end. She can press charges against you if she wishes, but she <br/>
would have to show damages, and it would be small claims. And i <br/>
doubt she would win.<br/>

might have a turn with it.  I mean, I might put my<br/>
knitting down as well, but that doesn&#39;t mean I want<br/>
everyone picking it up and knitting, purling, or<br/>
knot-tying when I&#39;m in the bathroom.  Do you really<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Because of their ages.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s being suggested that kids *have* to share whatever they<br/>
bring into public. I think it&#39;s being suggested that kids be helped to<br/>
understand the dynamics that can result when bringing things that can and<br/>
can&#39;t be shared.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s important for a child to take a particular toy they don&#39;t want to<br/>
share to a park, they can be helped to understand that they should *expect*<br/>
other kids to want to play with it and *expect* other kids to be upset when<br/>
they can&#39;t. That&#39;s just going to be a natural consequence. If they dislike<br/>
the upsetness more than they want the toy, then they&#39;ll choose to leave it<br/>
behind.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I doubt most 12 yos will want to play with your daughter&#39;s purse! Most 6 yos<br/>
will understand not wanting to share a teddy bear but it would be helpful<br/>
for her to know that it&#39;s possible that someone will really really want to<br/>
play with it and that there could be kids who are upset by not being able<br/>
to.<br/>

has to do with the setting. If I&#39;m with my kids at a<br/>
playgroup, I would expect all toys being brought to<br/>
the playgroup to be shared unless told otherwise. <br/>
<br/>
I also think there is a difference between a special<br/>
teddy bear - the toy that a child carries everywhere<br/>
and is a &quot;security blanket&quot; - and other toys. It&#39;s<br/>
somehow more personal. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>But these aren&#39;t toys, meant for children to play with. If your <br/>
daughter gives you her ring to take care of, she isnt dropping it <br/>
down on the playground grass and forgetting about it. And if she DID <br/>
do that, and another child picked it up to look at it, i dont think <br/>
it would be appropriate for her to tackle the other child to get <br/>
them to give it back. Its one thing if its a &quot;lovey&quot; like a security <br/>
blanket, or even if its something the child is worried about getting <br/>
broken, but still, i think its not a good thing to bring a toy to a <br/>
community event if you are going to flip out if someone else touches <br/>
it. And i dont think the mother prepared her child well for what <br/>
would happen if someone DID want to touch his toy. <br/>
<br/>
Do you really<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not think people should bring things into public that<br/>

&gt; houses and make a sandwich because they&#39;re not home...&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm....i dont see these things as being the same as a toy sword <br/>
brought to a park day where there was a high liklihood of other boys <br/>
being there who would want to play with that sword. At the very <br/>
least, its not very nice or considerate of him. Yes, its his &quot;right&quot; <br/>
to not let someone else see his sword. Just like it would be my <br/>
right to bring say, yummy cupcakes to a gathering, but say &quot;Oh these <br/>
are only for US, you can&#39;t have any!&quot; Its my right, but it seems <br/>
likely to cause bad feelings when its unnecessary. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying the child should be forced to share his toys. I&#39;m <br/>
saying that if he didnt want someone to play with his toy he <br/>
shouldnt have brought it at all, or asked his mom to hold it for <br/>
him. Put it back in the car. Lots of options. But instead, when <br/>
another child picked it up he tackled that child and then his mom <br/>
called the police. <br/>
<br/>
If my child had something valuable, or he didnt want other kids to <br/>
play with it, and we had visiting children in our home i wouldnt <br/>
say &quot;oh you can&#39;t play with that&quot; ,i would put the stuff up out of <br/>
sight. My son brought a gameboy with a saved game on it, to a <br/>
library day, and the kid who borrowed it accidentally erased his <br/>
game. Yes, that sucked, but my son knew ahead of time he was risking <br/>
his game if he let someone else play. I think the poster&#39;s child, <br/>
who grabbed the sword knowing the other boy didnt want him to play <br/>
with it, is somewhat &quot;at fault&quot; as well, as he knew it wasnt his <br/>
property and shouldve asked. But i think the other boy&#39;s mother <br/>
shouldve stepped in and helped navigate the situation.<br/>
<br/>
I dont think its a good idea to bring toys you dont want to share to <br/>
a park day when there is likely to be a lot of kids there who want <br/>
your toy. Why create those kinds of problems if its not necessary? <br/>
Why set your child up for that kind of confrontation? I&#39;m not sure <br/>
how you&#39;ve jumped from a sword laying on the ground in a public <br/>
park, to walking into someone&#39;s home. <br/>

&gt; bring into public. I think it&#39;s being suggested that<br/>
&gt; kids be helped to<br/>
&gt; understand the dynamics that can result when<br/>
&gt; bringing things that can and<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t be shared.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We often meet with all ages of people--so there is<br/>
just as much chance a 3 yo will want to play with my<br/>
12 yo&#39;s purse (it&#39;s very cute) than my 6 yo&#39;s teddy<br/>
bear.  If my kids need to set them down, they usually<br/>
bring them to me for safe keeping.  If a little person<br/>
asks to play with them while they&#39;re in my care, I say<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but this is something very special to<br/>
Lauren and she&#39;s not wanting to share it.&quot;  I haven&#39;t<br/>
noticed anyone being upset about it.  Consequnetly, my<br/>
kids know what that means, and don&#39;t play with other<br/>
people&#39;s &quot;special things&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
When we have friends over, we put away everything we<br/>
don&#39;t want them to touch, and put out only toys we&#39;re<br/>
happy sharing.<br/>

just about the expectation of kids to share.  But<br/>
y&#39;all are reassuing me that NO, no one is being forced<br/>
to share, so I&#39;ll just take a chill-pill now ;)  My<br/>
kids wouldn&#39;t lay something on the ground that was<br/>
important to them--they would bring it to me or put it<br/>
in the car for safe-keeping.  We have never had a<br/>
problem with this, so maybe I probably just don&#39;t know<br/>
what I&#39;m talking about--but I hear echos of my SIL&#39;s<br/>

share, and I feel for the children who are forced to<br/>
do so.  My kids have lots of special things, and they<br/>
don&#39;t share them, but then they also have things they<br/>
do share.  They often bring toys that are special to<br/>
the park, but we also bring 4 pails and shovels that<br/>
everyone can use, various other fun stuff that can be<br/>
shared.  I didn&#39;t mean, in any way, that the attacker<br/>
was right in tackling the other child for touching a<br/>
sword left on the ground.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-597003015">I thought and thought and this is what I thought I would do if it were me:<br/>
<br/>
I would compose a very careful letter to the mom saying you were sorry for <br/>
your son&#39;s part in the incident, and you were sorry it wasn&#39;t worked out while <br/>
both boys were there.  I would indicate at the bottom of the letter that copies <br/>
were going to the two moms I trusted most in the group.  And I would make <br/>
those three copies and keep one.<br/>
<br/>
I would do it on paper, not e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
Well, maybe e-mail too, but definitely signed real piece of paper.<br/>
<br/>
And I would deliver them and then she would have to either back off or make a <br/>
scene.  But IF she tried to press, she would be pressing with one hand and <br/>
holding a signed apology in the other.  And IF she tried to act like nothing <br/>
happened,  there would be witnesses who knew what had happened.<br/>
<br/>
Then if that doesn&#39;t feel good enough, maybe write another letter, a general <br/>
letter, with 30 copies to just pass out however at a group meeting, not at all <br/>
reciting the tale of &quot;She called the police!&quot; but requesting that the moms <br/>
not bring things that will cause strife, and that any mom whose child is <br/>
involved in an incident should get up and go there directly and not leave the park <br/>
without trying to resolve the issue there, for the good of the peace and future <br/>
of the group.  Make it positive and hopeful and stirring and great, and that <br/>
should shut her up and shut her down.<br/>

I&#39;ll help you write it if you want, or you could post drafts here and <br/>
everybody could sand and polish with you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dana, do you go to park days?<br/>
<br/>
Generally, kids bring things to play with WITH other kids - since that <br/>
IS the point of going to a park day - playing with other kids.<br/>
<br/>
So there is a reasonable assumption that kids have brought toys they <br/>
intend to share, especially among the younger kids.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the parents will inform their own kids that they ought to ask <br/>
before taking another kid&#39;s toy to play with - that&#39;s how the kids <br/>
learn to respect each other&#39;s stuff, true. But it isn&#39;t a terribly <br/>
unusual  &quot;offense&quot; for a kid to pick up a toy that is lying on the <br/>
ground and have a look at it - maybe THEN turn to the other kid and <br/>
say, &quot;Can I play with this?&quot;<br/>

These weren&#39;t unschoolers, I was reminiscing about our attempts to join<br/>
in park days here with the local homeschooling group. <br/>
<br/>
The moms liked to make outings *educational* so they assigned a science<br/>
survey of the creek.   This was typical of park days here and probably<br/>
still is.  In the winter months the homeschool group gets together for<br/>
&quot;gym days&quot; at the community center, but the kids don&#39;t get to play, the<br/>
moms outline and referee games and activities.   The kids would get<br/>
fifteen minutes of free time at the end of the hour.   <br/>

&gt; already think he&#39;s right. (!?!! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Intelligence is inherited.  It can throwback or be screwed up like any <br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; inherited trait.  But two musical parents will likely have musical <br/>
&gt; kids.  Two<br/>
&gt; tone-deaf parents probably won&#39;t.  Same sports, math, language...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Gardner says &quot;interpersonal intelligence,&quot; and I think two people who <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have it can&#39;t pass it on by nature OR by nurture.<br/>

Folks I just can not get past the fact this woman called the POLICE over <br/>
this. I would not contact her, I would not try to &quot;fix&quot; it, I would <br/>
avoid all contact with them in the future.<br/>
I would let others know...if only for their own protection.<br/>

I would apologize on paper because calling the police a second time is <br/>
probably easier than the first.  (And this probably wasn&#39;t even her first.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an apology designed to effusively say &quot;I was wrong, please forgive <br/>
me.&quot;  It&#39;s a formalized statement of &quot;bummer; regret my kid was affected by <br/>
your kid&#39;s weirdness.&quot;<br/>
