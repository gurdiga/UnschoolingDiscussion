<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265125352">My site&#39;s search boxes quit working.  I e-mailed to inquire (my site  <br/>
is through yahoo/geocities) but got an automated response.  So I was  <br/>
out poking around the web, and ran my search page through  <br/>
netmechanic&#39;s checker.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t find anything that would help, but did make some spelling  <br/>
suggestions, because it didn&#39;t know &quot;unschooling&quot; or &quot;SandraDodd&quot;  :<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SandraDodd<br/>
Saturated, Sundered, Syndicated<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling:<br/>
Uncoiling, Unschooled, Unicycling<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I like the poetry of &quot;Uncoiling, Unschooled, Unicycling.&quot;<br/>
