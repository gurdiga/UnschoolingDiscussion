<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792052016">Hi again<br/>
<br/>
I need some websites for my brothers and sisters.  Mom is reluctant to<br/>
just let the kids go, and would like some websites that they could just<br/>
check out on their own.<br/>
<br/>
What would anyone suggest for a (I know I&#39;m stereotyping here, but...)<br/>
an 18 year old boy, a 16 year old boy, a 13 year old girl, and a 9 year<br/>
old girl?  I suggested <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freeworksheets.com">http://www.freeworksheets.com</a> (my little sister<br/>
loves doing worksheets, and Mom will feel that she&#39;s actually<br/>
accomplishing something).  But there&#39;s a website - um something about<br/>
howstuffworks and Dr. Science, etc.  I really expect my brothers to just<br/>
take care of everything themselves - they were &quot;Very good students&quot; and<br/>
will probably go to the library ASAP and check out lots of &quot;educational<br/>
materials&quot; - basically take charge of what they feel their education<br/>
should be.  My sisters, though, I&#39;m sure, need quite a bit of<br/>
deschooling time - Mom says she&#39;s willing to allow that, but I&#39;m afraid,<br/>
at the pressure of my Dad (he&#39;s got a PhD+ and always expected us to do<br/>
the same), it&#39;s not going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of people just don&#39;t think about what they believe - they<br/>
just believe because that&#39;s what they were taught.  (Just to clear<br/>
things up, I&#39;m not talking about people who have studied their beliefs,<br/>
and I&#39;m not bashing religion - I&#39;m very religious &lt;but not fanatic about<br/>
it&gt; myself.  I&#39;m trying to express how I feel about the way some people<br/>
seem to feel like they have authority and others don&#39;t, etc - Now I&#39;m<br/>
really not making sense...)  Before I searched and researched, I thought<br/>
homeschooling was just a way to legally escape  the torture the rest of<br/>
us were expected to go through and that school was the only way to learn<br/>
anything and that kind of thing.  That&#39;s what I had been taught by the<br/>
authorities, and as a fully ps&#39;ed child, I had been taught never to<br/>
question the authorities.  Until I had multiple degrees, etc., then my<br/>
opinion would never matter or be correct.  I just accepted this as the<br/>
way things were.  I think a lot of people are like this.  From the time<br/>
they are four or five, they&#39;re brainwashed that the teacher is always<br/>
right, and the teacher knows best, and the kid is always wrong, and the<br/>
kid&#39;s opinion doesn&#39;t matter.  When this goes on for 13-17+ years,<br/>
people lose their confidence and self-worth.  When they get certain<br/>
degrees, they finally have their authority.  And they just assert what<br/>
they were taught - they just teach others (their own kids, or anybody<br/>
else) that you should never question authority and it&#39;s just another<br/>
cycle.  My dad is like this.  My husband is like this.  I used to be<br/>
like this - &#39;course, I was always (and still would be - if it wasn&#39;t for<br/>
the liberation of unschooling) at the bottom of the pecking order.  Does<br/>
my rambling make sense?<br/>
<br/>
Love, Melanie in Japan<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I&#39;m on the digest version (Using Netscape 4.6) and never have<br/>
problems with the list coming as an attachment or having to download or<br/>
anything...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-467050506">Hi Melanie.  Yes, your ramblings make some sense to me. I was so scared to<br/>
finish college on &quot;time&quot; --my father said I HAD to finish in 4 years--that<br/>
I took 27 units of English lit my senior year. It was the only year I made<br/>
the Dean&#39;s list. Of course I remember nothing. I started homeschooling my<br/>
oldest because I saw his propensity to become a &quot;company man&quot; and buy into<br/>
whatever the &quot;Mrs. Whoever&quot; said was correct. Now he&#39;s a fourth grader and<br/>
used to scrutinizing and questioning every authority (with appropriate<br/>
respect) and I feel I&#39;ve broken the cycle.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, way out there.  C C in California<br/>
