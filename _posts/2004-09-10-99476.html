<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144685763">I just finished watching the hour long repeat show on PBS from last night.<br/>
The last 7 or 8 minutes are really interesting to hear for an unschooler.<br/>
I think George Lucas knows about unschooling, it sure sounded like what<br/>
he was talking about without actually saying the words.   Really interesting!<br/>
<br/>
Charlie Rose is on again this evening with Mr. Lucas on PBS at 6pm so<br/>
maybe he&#39;s on in other places again if you want to see it.  :o)<br/>
