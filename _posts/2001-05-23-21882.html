<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522948409">Rita said: If I unschool my child and my child is not taking an initiative<br/>
to learn<br/>
anything ...<br/>
then I as a parent can do one of two things - stand by and watch my child<br/>
become a byproduct of bad parenting - or I can find ways to encourage them<br/>
and ignite that desire to learn new things...<br/>
<br/>
Rue now:<br/>
I think the issue of chores is one that not all unschooling parents will<br/>
agree on, one way or the other. Of course, we don&#39;t all even agree on<br/>
unschooling.  I don&#39;t watch my children for signs that they&#39;re &quot;taking an<br/>
initiative to learn&quot;, but I&#39;m not too worried about them becoming &quot;a<br/>
byproduct of bad parenting&quot; either.  ~Rue</div>

 </span></blockquote>Right.  I think it&#39;s helpful not to think of one&#39;s child as a &quot;product&quot; or<br/>
as a &quot;byproduct&quot;.<br/>
