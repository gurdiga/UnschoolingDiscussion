<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463781479">Hi all, I know this is perhaps a bit off-topic from Unschooling but <br/>
was hoping that perhaps since lots of you have older kids and <br/>
experience, perhaps you could help me with this. I am having trouble <br/>
potty training my 3 1/2 yr old son. We&#39;ve been working on it off and <br/>
on since he turned three (and some before then, but he wasn&#39;t ever <br/>
dry through the night untill then and so we didn&#39;t push it too much <br/>
and we also moved cross country in February and had read that you <br/>
shouldn&#39;t try when there is a big life change like that). We read <br/>
all the books (picture books about potty training), I have two <br/>
Video&#39;s about Potty Training that he likes to watch (was hoping Elmo <br/>
would get him excited enough to learn! Since Elmo is his favorite! <br/>
No dice!)I put him in cloth training pants every few days to &#39;try <br/>
again&#39; but he and I both end up frustrated when he ends up <br/>
wetting/messing his pants and just go back to diapers or pull-ups. <br/>
Have read a bit about letting him go about w/ no pants on at all, <br/>
but it&#39;s pretty cold and don&#39;t know if he&#39;d get too cold? Not sure <br/>
what to do. His sister is about to turn two the end of this month <br/>
(and is just getting verbal enough to start thinking of training <br/>
perhaps) and I am thinking perhaps I&#39;ll try and train them at the <br/>
same time so maybe he&#39;ll be more interested in it if it&#39;s a group <br/>
activity...? I am frustrated and feeling like a bit of a failure. <br/>
Like, if I can&#39;t even teach him to use the toilet, how will I EVER <br/>
teach him to read, write, etc etc etc... He&#39;s a bright little boy in <br/>
other areas and he likes to sit on the toilet, but just to &#39;pretend&#39; <br/>
and practice &#39;wiping&#39;(he&#39;s observed his Dad and I going to the <br/>
bathroom as we&#39;ve read that is a good idea for him to see so he <br/>
knows &#39;what to do&#39;)... But as for him actually going in the toilet, <br/>
NO SUCCESS at all...?? Has anyone else had a &#39;late bloomer&#39; in <br/>
toileting and advice one what they did? As I&#39;ve posted before too, <br/>
he&#39;s somewhat speech delayed and has only, in the last month or two, <br/>
been using the &#39;potty training jargon&#39; from the books I&#39;ve been <br/>
reading him. Any help or advice would be GREAT!!<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
 Smiles,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes; my firstborn was nearly 4, and I had an infant in diapers at the <br/>
same time.  She was simply not interested in the toilet.  At the time, <br/>
I was still working, and our work lunch room had a shelf of books to <br/>
take or trade.  One of them was &quot;Toilet Training in Less Than a Day,&quot; <br/>
which I grabbed onto like a lifeline.  I didn&#39;t know it at the time, <br/>
but this would be my first experience with operant conditioning (what <br/>
animal trainers commonly call &quot;clicker training&quot; now, and which I&#39;ve <br/>
since used with great success on dogs and horses).  It&#39;s also the kind <br/>
of training Alfie Kohn derides in &quot;Punished by Rewards.&quot;  Kind of a <br/>
conundrum for an unschooler, I know :-)  But, I wasn&#39;t an unschooler <br/>
back then!<br/>
<br/>
I read the book, got the tools together (cloth panties, a baby doll <br/>
that could wet, salty snacks, juice boxes, M&M&#39;s, an apron for me to <br/>
put snacks), told my dd that this would be the day she would never have <br/>
to wear diapers again, and endured the screams of protest (&quot;I will <br/>
NEVER wear panties!!!&quot;).  I didn&#39;t let it get to me, just proceeded to <br/>
&quot;teach&quot; the doll to use the potty.  I could go into greater detail <br/>
about the method, or you could find the book if you&#39;re interested.  <br/>
Just to say that the title was dead on: it took less than two hours to <br/>
go from screaming protests to smiling, &quot;I&#39;m never going to wear diapers <br/>
again!&quot;  She didn&#39;t -- and she never once wet her pants.<br/>
<br/>
By the time he brother was old enough, I&#39;d absorbed a lot of criticism <br/>
of this method (&quot;Oh, that&#39;s just operant conditioning,&quot; implying it was <br/>
somehow bad), so I didn&#39;t use it with him.  I used the charts and stars <br/>
method.  It took months.  He was at least somewhat interested in the <br/>
potty, having an older sister who could use it, and he may have started <br/>
a bit younger, so that could explain his having accidents when she did <br/>
not (including in bed).<br/>
<br/>
You might want to look for the book, since you have a child who is old <br/>
enough but not motivated.  Honestly, the whole experience was fun and <br/>
positive, and a real bonding time for my daughter and me.  It hinges on <br/>
the child teaching the dolly to use the potty, including teaching the <br/>
dolly to hurry to the potty from different rooms in the house (it got <br/>
quite hilarious after awhile!).<br/>

are 19 and 16 now!)</div>

<br/>
This is really not an unschooling question.<br/>
You&#39;re asking people to help you teach more efficiently, but people  <br/>
here are going to tell you not to teach.<br/>
<br/>
You will not ever teach him to read.<br/>
You will not ever teach him to write.<br/>
<br/>
You should stop trying to teach him to use the toilet.<br/>
<br/>
Create an environment in which he will learn calmly and happily in  <br/>
his own time.  Part of that environment needs to be your calm, happy  <br/>
acceptance.<br/>
<br/>
If you can do it with toilet training, you can do it with reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-708935849">Thank you for that. I, as you&#39;ve likely noticed, manage to get <br/>
myself worked into a lather about things too often... I realized <br/>
today (after getting my &#39;monthly friend&#39;) that likely my nagging <br/>
worries about this and other things have been hormone induced. I&#39;ve <br/>
been working with my son on Potty Training and not having much <br/>
success and the more books I read about it, most of them refering <br/>
to &#39;2 and SOMETIMES 3 year olds&#39; gets me to thinking &quot;Oh my <br/>
goodness! He&#39;s three and a 1/2! I HAVE TO GET IT DONE!!!&quot; When, in <br/>
my calmer moments, I am more of a &#39;he has his own timing and will <br/>
learn when it&#39;s important to him&#39;. I know this isn&#39;t an <br/>
unschooling &#39;issue&#39; but had tried to post for advice on a few potty <br/>
training YahooGroups, and didn&#39;t get much response and so figured <br/>
I&#39;d see what this groups experiences were. I like the way you put <br/>
this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You will not ever teach him to read.<br/>
&gt;You will not ever teach him to write.<br/>
&gt;You should stop trying to teach him to use the toilet.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I need to keep that in my mind. I guess I&#39;ll just continue to put <br/>
the cotton training pants on him (so he can actually be cognizant of <br/>
when he is wet or dry, as the pull-ups seem to keep him from <br/>
registering that feeling) and let him decide when it&#39;s important <br/>
enough for him to do. He is interested in the potty training books <br/>
and likes to hear the stories, so I&#39;ll continue to read them to him <br/>
as well and just TRUST... Thanks again.<br/>

&gt; teach him to read, write, etc etc etc... <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting how thinking about it in the opposite way has helped me <br/>
so much in unschooling my son. <br/>
<br/>
He learned to use the potty, when he was around 3.5 yrs old. I can&#39;t <br/>
remember exactly how old he was, because it just wasnt that big of a <br/>
deal. I didnt teach him. In fact, other than modelling using the <br/>
bathroom myself, i didnt even really encourage him. We had potty <br/>
seats sitting around, he&#39;d sit on them sometimes, even pee in them <br/>
sometimes, but it wasnt really a big deal. I figured he would learn <br/>
eventually. <br/>
<br/>
And he did. He&#39;s now 10 yrs old, and uses the toilet all the time. <br/>
Go figure!;o)  Actually he does wear pull-ups(goodnites)at <br/>
night,because he is a very deep sleeper and will otherwise wet. I <br/>
figure he&#39;ll grow out of that too, eventually. I know i did. <br/>
<br/>
And because my son learned to use the bathroom eventually, and <br/>
stopped nursing eventually, and started sleeping in his own bed <br/>
eventually, it was easy for me to accept that he would learn to read <br/>
eventually, in his own time and at his own pace. <br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who&#39;s son is a year younger than mine. He got <br/>
underwear for his 2nd birthday (amongst other presents of course!)<br/>
She began potty training him from the time he was two....by the time <br/>
he was 3.5 he was using the toilet regularly, just like my son. <br/>
<br/>
Seems like a lot of work and worry, for something that WILL (barring <br/>
any developmental problems)work itself out on its own. I found it <br/>
was alot more work to have a child potty-training-in-progress, than <br/>
to have one who is completely ready to use the toilet. I found <br/>
diapers alot easier, you didnt have to constantly ask if he has to <br/>
go, deal with accidents, leave movies early to go to the potty, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Its really not that dissimilar to unschoolers learning to read vs a <br/>
parent teaching a child to read. I couldve struggled with my son and <br/>
got him to stumble through early readers. But i just let it go. He <br/>
skipped all the simple stuff and went straight for the good stuff. <br/>
<br/>
So my suggestion....don&#39;t worry about it. If you push him, he will <br/>
know it, and might resist. If you tell him he will be able to use <br/>
the potty when his body is ready, it will take the pressure off.<br/>

Ok... I will! I guess I&#39;ve just got to let go of the &#39;ought to&#39; <br/>
thoughts that pervade my head so often and trust my son more to know <br/>
what is right for him. I struggle with the &#39;time&#39; thing and if I am <br/>
going to be successful at unschooling, I need to let it go. I know <br/>
that. I am glad I found this group when my kids are so little so by <br/>
the time that the actual &#39;unschooling&#39; time comes (as opposed to <br/>
them just being toddlers and me being Mommy) I&#39;ll have a better <br/>
understanding and ability to &#39;let go&#39; and TRUST them... Thanks so <br/>
much to you all for continuing to put up with my lack thereof... I <br/>
had thought I was such a laid back Mom! LOL! I am getting there <br/>
though... One day at a time. Thanks!</div>

Again, I will just go back to diapers or pull ups... Like you said, <br/>
it&#39;s easier on me and I am sure my &#39;stress&#39; about it is making <br/>
him &#39;resist&#39;... Who needs it! Niether him nor me! I&#39;ll just let him <br/>
have his own timing be the rule on this (and try to on everything else <br/>
he will learn as well! I will!! I am sure I&#39;ll need reminding and <br/>
reassurance from you veterans more than once again, but I WILL!). <br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

<br/>
Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
===============<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I should elaborate.<br/>
<br/>
By keeping him in &quot;training pants&quot; you indicate to yourself and to  <br/>
him that you&#39;re still training him (attempting, wishing), and there  <br/>
is an element of that &quot;training pants&quot; business that implies that a  <br/>
kid who isn&#39;t ready to use a toilet SHOULD feel wet, and be  <br/>
uncomfortable.  Because he has failed, and sinned, and he should know  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
But what is the principle?  I think keeping him comfortable is more  <br/>
important that his feeling wet.  I think keeping his clothes dry  <br/>
(especially in the winter!) should be a primary consideration.   <br/>
Keeping urine off the bed and the couch and the carpet and the  <br/>
carseats should outrank the thought that he should be cognizant of  <br/>
when he&#39;s wet.<br/>
