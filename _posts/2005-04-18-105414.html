<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490119005">Hi, <br/>
I&#39;m looking for books or information at the internet about authentic assessment and  hands-on learning like the Linda Dodson&#39;s The Ultimate Book of Homeschooling Ideas: 500+ Fun and Creative Learning Activities for Kids Ages 3-12 .<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I&#39;m a radical unschooler so the book is for those school-at-home parents (very common  in Puerto Rico) that are looking for more flexible educational alternatives for their spirited kids.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help you can give me,<br/>

Mel Levine is a doctor/researcher who is very accepting of the fact that kids aren&#39;t all the same, but have physical, biochemical and brain wiring differences.  I know he has a website with some information, just don&#39;t remember how extensive it is.  (I recommend you google it.)  One of his books is called The Myth of Laziness.  (I&#39;d like to make all parents who repeatedly call their kids &quot;lazy&quot; stay after school and read that one. &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
<br/>
Other authors who have written about kinesthetic learning styles (Armstrong, Markova, Tobias) would have sections that are appropriate for really energetic kids who can&#39;t function sitting still in school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-221588436">Diane Flynn Keith&#39;s &quot;Carschooling&quot; book has a lot of ideas - she <br/>
gathered ideas from her email list and then published. Not all are <br/>
car-only activities - most could be done at home or elsewhere, too.<br/>
<br/>
These are good books for unschoolers who don&#39;t think they have enough <br/>
imagination to come up with spontaneous ideas on their own, too.<br/>
<br/>
Another might be &quot;Trust the Children&quot; by Anna Kealoha -- more <br/>
schoolish, but still good.<br/>
