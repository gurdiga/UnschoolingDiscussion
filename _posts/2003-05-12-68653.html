<div id="ygrps-yiv-212061275">I all...i am new to the list and SO glad to have found you.  I am hoping you <br/>
can help me save my sanity, and keep from thinking i have totally ruined my <br/>
kids&#39; lives.  <br/>
<br/>
First a little about me...My name is Aradiann, but my friends call me Raydie. <br/>
 I am 37 years old, happily married (17 years this past Feb.), mom to two <br/>
boys, ages 16 and 13 1/2 (14 in August).  We have been home/unschooling for 3 <br/>
years now.  It has been a FANTASTIC experience.  I have learned so much and <br/>
my boys have flourished.  I live in North Florida, and in Florida the <br/>
schoolboard requires an annual evaluation by an active certified teacher.  <br/>
This hasn&#39;t been a problem for the first two years, as i had an acquaintance <br/>
who understood what i am doing, who also happened to be a teacher who was fed <br/>
up with the school system and thus supported my efforts.  At the end of our <br/>
&#39;school&#39; year, (as designated by the schoolboard), i would type up a little <br/>
&#39;report&#39; describing some of the things we learned during the year, (these <br/>
reports also helped me to see just how much we really WERE learning, while <br/>
having so much fun...thus kept me from thinking that i was doing the wrong <br/>
thing)....the teacher would sign the form and it was submitted to the <br/>
schoolboard.  Now...here&#39;s my dilemma.  This year, this acquaintance has had <br/>
some family issues and has disappeared.  I don&#39;t know where she is, when she <br/>
will be back, etc.  The end of the year reports are due....I found another <br/>
teacher, but she tells me that what i have isn&#39;t enough.  I need papers, (i <br/>
do have the boys do a little on paper, just for this purpose)....things need <br/>
to be &#39;perfect&#39;.  So i freak and call the school board.  I figure i have <br/>
totally screwed up, so maybe the boys should go back to school.  For high <br/>
school, (i mean, who the heck do i think i am keeping my kids out of school <br/>
for these important years, and then i am not even teaching them, right?).  <br/>
They give me the number to the high school so i can call them.  First of all, <br/>
the red tape is ATROCIOUS!!!!!  Then i get a real &#39;cold&#39; reception and end up <br/>
on the line with a real jerk.  The youngest will have to take a battery of <br/>
tests just to &#39;provisionally&#39; place him, (if he can&#39;t keep up he will be <br/>
demoted -- this moron talked to me like this was an inevitability), the <br/>
oldest is doomed.  He doesn&#39;t have any documented &#39;credits&#39;, and without a <br/>
COMPLETE portfolio for the last TWO YEARS, he won&#39;t get them.  Even WITH <br/>
these portfolios he will need to take a battery of exams....the MLST&#39;S, <br/>
SAT&#39;S, etc., etc.  He&#39;s freaking.  I am freaking.  I don&#39;t know what to do.  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t seem to matter that my oldest son is doing COLLEGE BIOLOGY, (he <br/>
wants to be a zoologist)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I called the teacher who has <br/>
all the paperwork and told her to just send my stuff back, i would figure <br/>
something out, but she wasn&#39;t there and i haven&#39;t heard back.  All this stuff <br/>
needs to be turned in by July 1, and i just dunno what to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Whew....i think that&#39;s the Reader&#39;s Digest version....THANK YOU ALL for any <br/>
advice and support...i could really use it right about now....I don&#39;t know <br/>
anyone else who is unschooling, let alone unschooling TEENAGERS!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again....<br/>

<br/>
We are blessed to live in British Columbia, Canada where the law states a child MUST be registered.  That is ALL the law states.  No other requirements.  Homeschoolers can enter college with the College president&#39;s signature - takes about an hour.  Yet if you asked a teacher or principal, or worse a school board administrator, they would tell you a attendance etc. is mandatory/preferred.  And they&#39;ll tell you that a child will NEVER get into a college without a high school diploma. (They don&#39;t know/aren&#39;t telling that great colleges are head-hunting for homeschoolers because they can think!)<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that if one teacher can approve you and another won&#39;t then the law may weigh in your favour.  My suggestion to you is that, if you haven&#39;t done so already, you understand the law in Florida, not anyone&#39;s interpretation.  Use a lawyer even.  Or a law student.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if the laws are weak here, perhaps there are no REAL consequences to NOT getting your info package to they on time (if at all, as the law here in BC states) and you can take the time to seek a more sympathetic teacher.  You may have to research that a bit using your personal connections and maybe this list.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there!<br/>
<br/>
PS. Anyone on this list already done this legal work?<br/>

I have not had to register my son yet because he is not the mandatory <br/>
age.  However, I was told in FLorida (we are in south florida) you <br/>
can register under an &quot;unbrella&quot; private school and pretty much do <br/>
what you want with no checks.  You can also start one your self, I <br/>
think you need about 4 kids or so.  Go here:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.parentdirectededucation.org/Establishing%20a%20Private%<br/>

<br/>
Many people have them.  I know through my support group there are <br/>
people who have them, so check with your local group to see if you <br/>
could join up with one if you are interested.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps a little.  SOmeone on this site gave me the info so <br/>
maybe she will respond as well with more specific information.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Blew my friend&#39;s mind, when we were arguing about the SAT&#39;s. Her son <br/>
is entering college next year, and she was worried for me/about me, <br/>
how will my kids be ready to take the SAT&#39;s cuz they&#39;ll never get <br/>
into college without it. Um...I didn&#39;t get a diploma. A GED. I never <br/>
took the SAT&#39;s or their equivalent, because by my Jr. year, I hated <br/>
school BADLY and never bothered with the tests. and I got in to the <br/>
University of Utah, on my entrance exam scores. She was <br/>
speechless. &quot;Really? They&#39;re asking (boy) for his SAT scores on every <br/>
piece of paper.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to watching my kids enter adulthood with dreams <br/>
that haven&#39;t been put aside, really knowing themselves and able to <br/>
push forward with life. SAT&#39;s? Heck, get the book on how to study for <br/>
it, from the Library, if you feel compelled.<br/>
<br/>
HeidiC<br/>
<br/>
p.s. and there&#39;s a high school at home program available. A two year <br/>
course, and you come out with a transcript and an official diploma, <br/>
if jumping through the hoops is important to a family.</div>

You said your boys were flourishing with unschooling. I wouldn&#39;t let <br/>
the school driven authorities shake your confidence. As you said, <br/>
they don&#39;t understand anything about unschooling. Your kids aren&#39;t <br/>
playing their game. It&#39;s natural that they wouldn&#39;t have the papers <br/>
to prove that they are.<br/>

<br/>
Why not have him go directly to Community College and skip the high <br/>
school bull? It&#39;s very doable and sounds like a good fit for him. Get <br/>
some more and better info about the Florida homeschooling laws and <br/>
proceed from there. I don&#39;t think putting your kids back in school is <br/>
really the answer your family is looking for.<br/>

&gt; they don&#39;t understand anything about unschooling. Your kids aren&#39;t <br/>
&gt; playing their game. It&#39;s natural that they wouldn&#39;t have the papers <br/>
&gt; to prove that they are.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are, of course, right....the boys are both extremely bright, and can hold <br/>
conversations with the most versed of adults...i just get caught up in the <br/>
whole hellabaloo of authority and red tape.  It just throws me that my boys <br/>
need MORE &#39;proof&#39; than what they aren&#39;t teaching the public kids that are in <br/>
school....absolutely ridiculous, in my opinion....&gt; <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Why not have him go directly to Community College and skip the high <br/>
&gt; school bull? It&#39;s very doable and sounds like a good fit for him. Get <br/>
&gt; some more and better info about the Florida homeschooling laws and <br/>
&gt; proceed from there. I don&#39;t think putting your kids back in school is <br/>
&gt; really the answer your family is looking for.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am going to look into this, &lt;after i get through all this crap that is due <br/>
July 1&gt;.&gt; <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Breathe, Raydie. All is well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Life is good.<br/>
&gt; ~Mary<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you so much for the great support and advice Mary.  Yes, Life is <br/>
good...i just don&#39;t have alot of patience, and i tend to freak out...what a <br/>
wuss i am!  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, and i am looking forward to all the comaraderie here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733192538">All good advice, esp. if you don&#39;t want to go to court to defend your rights.  Then again, maybe a high-profile Supreme Court battle might establish a clearer guideline in BC/Canada, for better and yes, maybe for worse.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I HATE about homeschooling & unschooling is dodging the question.<br/>
<br/>
PS. IF an unschooled child wants to go to university in Canada, I can&#39;t think of a better way to avoid the academic nonsense of &quot;UNIVERSITY&quot; than taking as many courses as possible at a community college.  Cheaper too, at least in my day.  But that&#39;s a personal choice.<br/>
