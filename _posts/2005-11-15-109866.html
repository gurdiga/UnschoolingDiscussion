<div id="ygrps-yiv-802145222">We read THE PRINCESS BRIDE for a book club I led, where I had to research it all.  Morgenstern is a name used by Goldman--the book has many layers of irony and humor, the name thing just being a piece of the whole clever puzzle. I&#39;ve read THE SILENT GONDOLIERS, too (also by Goldman,) which is just a very sweet, cute fable of loyalty.<br/>

Interesting, except that means he was lying through his teeth in an<br/>
interview published by the Science Fiction Book Club (on their website)<br/>
where he told the story that I quoted about giving the &quot;original&quot; book to<br/>
his son. I rather resent being bullshitted to like that (although it doesn&#39;t<br/>
change my enjoyment of the movie).<br/>
