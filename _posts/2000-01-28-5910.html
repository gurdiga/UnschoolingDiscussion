<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534287961">It seems a lot of people think a better school is more strict, &quot;has<br/>
higher standards&quot;.  I met a mom who is very proud that her kids<br/>
kindergarten class is so strict bc the children know what the rules<br/>
are????  They get sticks for breaking rules and aren&#39;t even allowed to<br/>
talk in the bathroom!!  This is at a private school in our community. <br/>
Seems to me it just sets up more kids for failure.<br/>
I also know two hs families who live right next to a school.  They use<br/>
the playground after school hours.<br/>
