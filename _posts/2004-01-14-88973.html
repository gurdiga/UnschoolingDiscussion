<br/>
  The last few months I&#39;ve been writing what the kids have been doing and <br/>
other thoughts ...when I feel like it,in no specific order . I call it December <br/>
ramblings , January ramblings, etc  and just keep it saved to my computer.<br/>
So would that be a Blog if I put it on a Blog hoster?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406960123">Yup! That would be a Blog! People write about all sorts of things, and it&#39;s all interesting to me - what people are doing and thinking, the various opinions on subjects. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-220071558">Yeah, a blog is pretty much a public, online journal, a soapbox, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I want to do it because it might be more fun--kind of like using crayons instead of a pencil. Plus, I like to keep up with the technology.<br/>
