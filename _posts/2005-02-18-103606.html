Yet  still people (even unschoolers!) will caution that it could <br/>
become  addicting, if it isn&#39;t already.<br/>

==========================<br/>
 <br/>
Even unschoolers? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t defend that argument.  Maybe unschoolers who limit TV would  make <br/>
that self-supporting argument.<br/>
 <br/>
I was looking for one of my own webpages (some get lost because I don&#39;t  <br/>
remember where I&#39;ve linked them or what the names are) and came upon something  <br/>
I&#39;d never seen or heard of and it had a link to my site.  There were people  <br/>
discussing unschooling, with only a couple of unschoolers coming in to clarify a  <br/>
bit.  I saved it on another computer and will bring bits of it over  here.  <br/>
Interestingly, all the weird stereotypes seemed represented.<br/>
 <br/>

All those 19th century opium fiends are dead. <br/>

My mom was an alcoholic all her adult life, with a nine year AA  reprieve.  <br/>
She smoked cigarettes with NO break, from her late teens.   She lived into her <br/>
70&#39;s.  But her nicotine and alcohol addictions were  real, and ugly and <br/>
expensive, and both were listed on her death  certificate.  Still...  <br/>
 <br/>
If habit and addiction can denote (name, or refer to) the same thing, they  <br/>
have very different connotations (side information).<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s that father&#39;s day saying about lots of men are fathers, but only  the <br/>
special ones are daddies (or some such).   There are other  denotations for <br/>
male parents.  &quot;Sperm donor&quot; isn&#39;t a very nice one.<br/>
