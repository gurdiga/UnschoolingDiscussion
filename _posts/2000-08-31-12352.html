<div id="ygrps-yiv-70471943">One of the women in my homeschooling group sent us this e-mail and I thought <br/>
you guys might like to read it<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I just bought this U.S. Presidents Fact Pack from Wal-Mart.  It has some<br/>
 </span></blockquote>interesting information about all the Presidents (including Clinton, though<br/>
his card isn&#39;t quite up to date.  It only covers up to his re-election.)<br/>
What I found most interesting was the way that most of the Presidents were<br/>
educated up through Truman.  Here is some of what the cards say...<br/>
<br/>
Harry S Truman - could not afford college.  He got his education the hard<br/>
way, in the army.<br/>
Warren Harding - worked at many different jobs as a boy, one of which was a<br/>
printer&#39;s apprentice.  At 14 he entered Ohio Central College...<br/>
Theodore Roosevelt - was tutored at home until he went to Harvard where he<br/>
was a Phi Beta Kappa honor student.<br/>
Benjamin Harrison - attended school in a log cabin his father had built.  He<br/>
graduated from Miami University (Ohio).... fourth in his class.<br/>
James A. Garfield - attended school only three months of the year, but he<br/>
loved learning and read a lot.<br/>
Rutherford B. Hayes - went to private school and received some of his<br/>
education at home.<br/>
Ulysses S. Grant - worked in his father&#39;s tannery and on the family farm...<br/>
In 1839 (age 17) he went to West Point and excelled in mathematics.<br/>
Andrew Johnson - was apprenticed to a tailor at 14.... he had learned to<br/>
read a little, and his wife taught him to write.<br/>
Abraham Lincoln - received no more than a year of schooling, but read every<br/>
book he could borrow and became a master of the English language.<br/>
James Buchanan - loved to learn and worked hard in his father&#39;s store.  He<br/>
went to Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA, and eventually graduated with<br/>
honors.<br/>
Millard Fillmore - spent his early youth working with his father....  He<br/>
educated himself and attended New Hope Academy for six months.<br/>
Zachary Taylor - had little or no formal education, except for a small<br/>
school in Louisville, Kentucky.<br/>
William Henry Harrison - was first educated at home, attended Hampden-Sidney<br/>
College in Virginia, and studied medicine but gave it up to join the army.<br/>
John Quincy Adams - was educated in a village school, then under the<br/>
guidance of his mother.<br/>
John Adams - grew up on a farm and was very athletic.  At 16 he went to<br/>
Harvard....<br/>
George Washington - had no formal schooling.<br/>
<br/>
All those not listed here went to either private or public schools.  Each<br/>
card specifies the school or &quot;a school,&quot; etc. except the ones listed above.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know that only 1/4 of the U.S. Presidents went to public schools?<br/>
The rest went to college only (no early education), private schools, no<br/>
school at all, or were educated at home!  Yet, the &quot;powers that be&quot; say that<br/>
you can&#39;t get a good education unless you go to &quot;school&quot; for 12 years.  And<br/>
most of the time, they mean public school!<br/>
<br/>
Public schools these days (and even many private schools that accept<br/>
state/federal $$) are not about education, they are about indoctrination ~<br/>
the &quot;it takes a village&quot; mentality.&lt;&lt;</div>
