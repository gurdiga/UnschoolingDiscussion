<br/>
You recognize this in yourself - so as a positive you are not ignoring that you feel this way! And this can be overcome!<br/>
<br/>
The little girl next door who played with us and did all kinds of crafts etc. until school came along gets &quot;reader&quot; of the month and reads with the principal etc.  My daughter is able to cheer her on - without the competitive spirit of knowing that far before this she was helping this girl to read. I am very proud of her because , the thought has crossed my mind that my daughter who has been a fabulous reader would surely have been &quot;reader of the month&quot;  at least once. But thankfully, she doesn&#39;t carry that competitive baggage and just does what she does because she enjoys it - not because someone will recognize her for it.<br/>
<br/>
My personal story is similar to the ones I have heard. I was a very bright student - all honors and everything. I didn&#39;t LOVE school - and got by with as little work as possible ( even though my grades were great). I constantly heard all my life how smart I was, and my parents were always so happy with my achievements. I too started college and got married and had three kids in the middle. I continued to go part-time for 7 years and finally graduated. Of course my Father was thrilled thinking I would get on with it and make the &quot;real money&quot; etc.  Guess what - I am finding that the journey that I started with my children is far more fulfilling than some big, corporate job with lots of monetary recognition.  I do have deep conflicts where in reality I know the time I am taking with my children is the most important - but I constantly feel that nagging feeling of &quot;not living up to my potential&quot; that I heard all my life.  I also am finding with the few interviews that I went on that the fact that I have a great grade point average and was recognized as an outstanding scholar - means little in comparison with work experience (or lack thereof).  The point is - although I know logically that what I am doing right now is the best thing I can be doing for my children- the praise and recognition I received as a child for good grades, etc. stops once you stop performing in that arena and I often have issues of feeling inadequate for what I think I lack. <br/>
<br/>
So, try and joy in the fact that your daughter is a wonderful person - and that she has so many qualities that are valuable in life. Getting academic, sports or other recognition doesn&#39;t do much for you once the moment is gone.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I found most appealing about unschooling - was letting my children develop whatever talents they have that they want to develop. I will not  jump on them and insist they practice the piano or whatever because I see &quot;budding potential&quot;. They may hate the piano. The way I see it - if you are doing what you love - that is where you will find the most success and happiness. <br/>
<br/>
I am still trying to figure out what that is for me. It doesn&#39;t make any difference if you got great grades - and lack real skills. I am sure I have some - but what they are is difficult to discern. How sad it is that to have gone through years and years of &quot;school&quot; and still not have some concrete skill that is useful!  So, I guess I will be using my time now developing whatever it is, I didn&#39;t have the time to develop while I was performing academically!<br/>
<br/>
In any case - that type of recognition is so temporary. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>{{{{{Laura B.}}}}}  You&#39;re human, and you were *schooled* ~ there is NO shame <br/>
in either of those.  Kudos for not putting this on your kids and for keeping <br/>
your feelings to yourself.  Your kids are a credit to you by *being who they <br/>
are* and for you allowing them such privilege!  As an unschooler, I find my <br/>
*credit* coming to me in amazing ways ~ seeing my child be kind, just <br/>
because; seeing the *lightbulb* go on during a discussion of an *adult* <br/>
topic; hearing wisdom pour forth from tiny mouths that would have been <br/>
squelched by a teacher.  <br/>
I also struggle with the things I missed in school.  If my children were <br/>
guaranteed the *ultimate* (in my mind) school experience (honor roll, <br/>
cheerleader, letters for sports, musician, prom queen/king, etc...) I really <br/>
doubt I would send them still ~ at 35, those things seem so moot compared to <br/>
what I have learned by *not* having those things (does that even make <br/>
sense?!).  I&#39;ve lead and continue to lead a life that is full and richer than <br/>
I could have imagined ... <br/>
Be kind to yourself, enjoy your life, love your children...<br/>

Don&#39;t take it so hard. I&#39;m very impressed that you have this level of <br/>
self-awareness to know what was going on inside your head. Lots of <br/>

<br/>
With your gift for the written word, I don&#39;t think you really need <br/>

If it helps, studies have shown that the high achieving, award <br/>

<br/>
AHA!  But they don&#39;t tell the kids in school that, do they?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I figured out when I was in my 20&#39;s that my cousin Nada (about my age, same <br/>
grade, grew up with our family, shared a room with me until we were 14) who <br/>
was ALWAYS a B/C student (AND was inducted into the national honor society in <br/>
high school even though she was also using drugs AND she was having sex which <br/>
I, good girl, was NOT and not for lack of opportunity rant rant rant, but I&#39;m <br/>
over it now) was smarter than I was at being in the world, taking care of her <br/>
car, buying groceries, paying bills, cooking, cleaning, entertaining--all the <br/>
things that really matter for adults, Nada could do way better than I <br/>
could!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Was that fair!?<br/>
<br/>
Was that right!?<br/>
<br/>
No longer could I just whip out a &quot;blacken the dots&quot; standardized test and <br/>
reap the praise and glory of all around.  No longer could I do a good <br/>
termpaper and get a paycheck (report card).  REAL life paychecks came harder, <br/>
and in my case had often involved donuts, making drinks from a recipe book <br/>
(because I could never learn the drink recipes by memory) and serving more <br/>
sopaipillas to table 28,  until I got my REAL job, teaching Jr. High.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT!? <br/>
<br/>
More people needed enchiladas than needed Jr. High, but I didn&#39;t know that at <br/>
the time!!!<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, rejoice at happy, average kids.  They&#39;ll be happy above-average <br/>
adults!!<br/>

Thanks for the hug.<br/>

What I&#39;ve excerpted above -- it does have to be a conscious decision on our <br/>
parts, doesn&#39;t it?  I agree with the last part of your statement here, even <br/>
as I said in another post that I don&#39;t have much to show for my life at 42.  <br/>
I really do -- they&#39;re just intangibles, mostly.  And subtle things.  Our <br/>
society only embraces and applauds the obvious and dramatic, though...<br/>

Well thanks. :o) I&#39;m glad you took my slap in the right way. Everyone <br/>
else was giving hugs, I was starting to feel like I was too rough on <br/>
you. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
I once asked Sandra to slap me around about something and she <br/>
refused! All she would give me was an offer for a sympathetic ear, a <br/>
cup of tea and a sandwich. So much for her reputation as a hard-ass. <br/>
&lt;g&gt; (Hi Sandra) I just figure if you ask for a slap, I&#39;ll give you a <br/>
slap. But only the cyber/silly version.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you&#39;re feeling better. FWIW I was thinking more about what you <br/>
wrote. I know that I&#39;ve had those feelings creep up from time to time <br/>
about other stuff. Like when people post about karate and I think <br/>
about Conor&#39;s disastrous attempts at the dojo. Or how proud I was at <br/>
Casey&#39;s talent in gymnastics only to have her break my proud mama&#39;s <br/>
heart and quit because they were putting too much pressure on her. So <br/>
I can&#39;t claim brown belt or level 5/6 gymnast&#39;s mother status.<br/>
<br/>
I think these thoughts do catch us from time to time. The trick is to <br/>
just observe them for what they are-thoughts. They don&#39;t define us or <br/>
our children. Being aware of them makes it that much easier to watch <br/>
them come and watch them go. No need to hold on to them.<br/>

I think these thoughts do catch us from time to time. The trick is to <br/>
just observe them for what they are-thoughts. They don&#39;t define us or <br/>
our children. Being aware of them makes it that much easier to watch <br/>
them come and watch them go. No need to hold on to them.<br/>

Very true Mary I agree . And what is this about Sandra being a hard ass??? I rather like that about her. &lt;eg&gt;Tracy<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I know that I&#39;ve had those feelings creep up from time to time <br/>
<br/>
about other stuff. Like when people post about karate and I think <br/>
<br/>
about Conor&#39;s disastrous attempts at the dojo. Or how proud I was at <br/>
<br/>
Casey&#39;s talent in gymnastics only to have her break my proud mama&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
heart and quit because they were putting too much pressure on her. So <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t claim brown belt or level 5/6 gymnast&#39;s mother status.<br/>

<br/>
The other day a homeschooling mom considering convertion to unschoolerism <br/>
spent most of the day with us.  She was out smoking a cigarette and Marty was <br/>
out chatting with her.  I went out just as Marty was telling her that I made <br/>
him finish all the skating classes (to level six) before I would let him play <br/>
hockey when he was eight.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing she had asked whether I ever made him do anything, from the tone <br/>
of it and what parts she was paying most attention to.<br/>
<br/>
That was five years ago.  Holly and Marty went to take a Snowplow Sam course <br/>
through continuuing education, and they both had fun, but Holly didn&#39;t have <br/>
as much fun as Marty did.  I think she went to level two of the regular <br/>
classes.  Maybe three.  But Marty said &quot;HOCKEY!&quot;  And it being the desert <br/>
here, and me knowing it wasn&#39;t going to be easy for him to practice between <br/>
times, and me being kinda cowardly about jockitunal endeavors, I said I <br/>
wanted him to finish the skating lessons so he would be really good at it and <br/>
not get hurt.<br/>
<br/>
So when I heard him telling our friend this story, I said &quot;I probably <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do that now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And it was true, but I hadn&#39;t thought of that story in terms of &quot;what would I <br/>
do now&quot; since then (ever, I mean).<br/>
<br/>
Partly, honestly, it was because he was male and young and cute, and in a <br/>
school/rink full of mostly female skaters, being a quick study had made him <br/>
the teacher&#39;s favorite, and he could have been a skating partner for every <br/>
ice dancer and gymnastic skater-chick on our side of town in a heartbeat.  I <br/>
was hoping he would want to go into the next level of lessons, ice dance.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him the important questions:  Don&#39;t you want a chance to be a <br/>
chipmunk in some Disney on Ice show?   He said no, he wanted to play hockey.<br/>
<br/>
Now when they go skating he&#39;s the patient coach of little kids who haven&#39;t <br/>
skated much or at all, he&#39;s the encourager of frustrated beginners who fall <br/>
down, he&#39;s the clown and the chaser and the on-ice host of whatever skating <br/>
group might be there that day, and that&#39;s nice too.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:LauraBourdo@...">LauraBourdo@...</a> wrote:Backstory (in other words, don&#39;t slap me yet):<br/>
I&#39;m relatively new to unschooling (2 years), and came into it too late with <br/>
my kids to persuade my eldest to leave ps behind.  I am therefore in the <br/>
peculiar position of living the *educational extremes* -- unschooling my now <br/>
almost 15 yo ds, and supporting my 18 yo dd as she finishes her public high <br/>
school career.  Believe me, it&#39;s weird sometimes.  Okay.  Most of the time.  <br/>
My heart is really with unschooling, but it didn&#39;t fit dd under her <br/>
circumstances at the time we made the leap.  I have to accept that and not <br/>
allow myself to be overcome with regrets.  The conflicting emotions, however, <br/>
are another story entirely...<br/>
<br/>
My little problem:<br/>
I went tonight to dd&#39;s annual sports awards banquet.  She&#39;s a 4 year <br/>
basketball letterman -- enthusiastic if not highly successful (in the <br/>
prototypical sense).  As a matter of fact, that&#39;s kind of what I&#39;m stumbling <br/>
over tonight.<br/>
<br/>
I have raised, in her, a totally marvelous, delightful young woman, full of <br/>
exceptional but relatively intangible gifts -- a terrific sense of humor, a <br/>
wonderful way with people, an open and loving heart, a positive <br/>
self-image...you get the idea.  <br/>
<br/>
What she&#39;s NOT is successful in terms that the world (especially the <br/>
perverse, hypocritical, overly competitive world of public high school) <br/>
appreciates and recognizes.  She is an average student and athlete, has <br/>
friends but is not *popular*, has enjoyed high school but has very little to <br/>
show for the time she spent there in terms of extracurricular activities, is <br/>
healthy and attractive but not glamorous.<br/>
<br/>
I sat there tonight and listened as all of these kids were getting special <br/>
recognition for exceptional, tangible gifts and skills -- records broken, <br/>
scholarships and leadership awards given -- and felt this awful feeling of <br/>
jealousy creep up my spine.  Gag!<br/>
<br/>
I would never, in a gazillion years, breathe a word of this to either of my <br/>
children, but it&#39;s there like a cancer, inside me.  I wanted a child like <br/>
that.  I wanted my offspring to be a credit to me.  I wanted the applause for <br/>
her accomplishments...for me!  And I knew, as I sat there, with an awful <br/>
feeling of despair, that I&#39;ll never get that from either of my children now.  <br/>
She&#39;s done, and her brother&#39;s at home -- never to even have a shot at that <br/>
sort of acclaim.<br/>
<br/>
Now tell me...how sick is THAT?  Who&#39;s being perverse, hypocritical and <br/>
overly competitive now?  I&#39;m so ashamed of myself.<br/>
<br/>
So, somebody -- please slap some sense back into me.  I need to regain my <br/>
perspective.  The tentacles of a twisted world are wrapping themselves around <br/>
me and I&#39;m having a hard time breathing...<br/>
<br/>
Tell me, please, with all of the poetic wisdom of which I know you&#39;re <br/>
capable, that we really are doing the right thing here, and that this, too, <br/>
shall pass.<br/>

up again for a homeschoolers swim/gym class. He loves it but said that he wanted to<br/>
take a break and go back in the fall. My first reaction was to convince him to keep<br/>
going...after all, he does love it, it is a great outlet for his energy plus it<br/>
helps give me something to tell my dad that we are doing (and helps me feel like<br/>
we are doing something too - ouch!). Basically I realized<br/>
that my reasons for wanting him to stay were mostly for me. In talking with him,<br/>
he just said that that 2 days/week was too much and wanted to take a break. Seems pretty<br/>
smart for a 6 yo. And now it has actually freed us up to do other things, so all in all<br/>
a good decision even if it was not the one I would have made. :o)<br/>
