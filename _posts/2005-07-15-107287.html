I would hate that.<br/>
I would hate it if I were the kid, and I would hate it if I were an adult (I <br/>
DO hate it) being told by someone else&#39;s mom to tell me ANYthing (like <br/>
&quot;thanks&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t treat an adult that way.   I wouldn&#39;t begin to say to a grown <br/>
friend or my husband, &quot;How did that make you feel?   Now tell the grocery store <br/>
clerk how that made you feel.&quot;   And just imagine if someone said &quot;How does it <br/>
make you feel when the security guard/policeman asked you to step to the side?  <br/>
 Now tell the officer how you felt.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=i&#39;ve never seen the one who&#39;s hurting<br/>
not WANT to do this-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen kids more afraid of the other person than of the mom, but afraid <br/>
nonetheless, and not feeling empowered to say, &quot;No, not only do I not want to <br/>
repeat what I just said in front of the other person, but I don&#39;t like the <br/>
babytalk either.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-the next thing i would do, if it wasn&#39;t already addressed, is ask him<br/>
what he needs from<br/>
zoe&#39;s mom to make him feel better.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in these scenes as the subject and the other kid (when it was done <br/>
with/to kids, and I have never had as much respect for the manager of the <br/>
scenario afterward.   It&#39;s not natural human behavior, and it doesn&#39;t help the <br/>
child figure out what he might do if the parent isn&#39;t there to orchestrate the <br/>
horribly awkward &quot;solution,&quot; which I think is worse than the problem. <br/>
<br/>
-=-it&#39;s usually an apology or a hug<br/>
and sometimes it&#39;s<br/>
nothing-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would say nothing if I were pressed to request what would make me feel <br/>
better.   What would make me feel better in any of those situations would be to <br/>
express myself in private and either figure out on my own or with advice how I <br/>
might want to respond the next time such an occasion arises, if ever.    I <br/>
would not feel better having someone puppet-master a fake solution.<br/>
<br/>
The mom who did this the biggest and worst and most sing-songy in my life was <br/>
one whose son involved two of my kids in sexual misconduct, both younger than <br/>
he was.    When she found out about it she made totally lame-ass excuses and <br/>
offered to pay for counselling.  Yeah, like a one year old girl needs <br/>
counselling.   With no one there to tell her what would be good to say, she didn&#39;t <br/>
have a clue, but she was great at telling her son how to act and what to say.   <br/>
In the absence of parental scripting and prompting, he wasn&#39;t making very good <br/>
decisions on his own at all.<br/>
<br/>
-=-probably the most important thing is to let him use his voice,<br/>
there&#39;s nothing more<br/>
powerful than that :)-=-<br/>
<br/>
The freedom to choose not to use his voice might be just as important, or the <br/>
leeway to decide when and how.<br/>
