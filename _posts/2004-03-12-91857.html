<div id="ygrps-yiv-545706060">This comment by Pinkflyingponies made me think:  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Now I feel really bad for this month of crazy bedtime demands.  I let <br/>
 </span></blockquote>my mother bother me.  I was hiding the fact that Hannah was still <br/>
nursing past 3yrs.  She has never approved of my parenting or my <br/>
decision to homeschool, she was on me for a bit about hannah going to <br/>
preschool.  Saying that Hannah needs to go to preschool so that she <br/>
would learn to respect adults, and learn how other kids her age <br/>
should be.( I didn&#39;t realize ~hOw~ bad that sounded until I just <br/>
wrote it)&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Recently we bought tap shoes for Isabel because they were the<br/>
&quot;clackiest&quot; shoes we could find.  When she proudly showed them to my<br/>
parents they said in unison &quot;Oh, are you taking tap dancing class?&quot;  We<br/>
all shook our head no and I saw my mom struggle for a second but she had<br/>
to lecture me about letting her have tap shoes without lessons.  I said<br/>
&quot;why would you squash the joy out of wearing a pair of tap shoes?&quot;  She<br/>
said it wasn&#39;t the way it was done.  We discussed this again at a later<br/>
time and she said that children aren&#39;t taught anymore that achievement<br/>
comes only through hard work.  I asked what that had to do with a pair<br/>
of tap shoes.  She said we were never going to see eye to eye and that<br/>
was the end of it.  <br/>
 <br/>
I used to try to defend my position to my parents (especially since I<br/>
told them I was not going to do school-at-home and they told me I had no<br/>
right to experiment on my children - but that&#39;s another on-going<br/>
discussion).  I don&#39;t think I ever really understood that my parent&#39;s<br/>
view of life and children in general is that there are rules attached to<br/>
everything.  If you want to have a camera you better become a<br/>
world-renowned photographer.  If you want tap shoes you better take<br/>
classes or you have no right to wear them.  I&#39;m not sure where this rule<br/>
structure came from, whether most people from their generation (the 50&#39;s<br/>
and 60&#39;s) have the same belief system or not.  I do see that it takes<br/>
the joy out of life and learning.  Unschooling to them means letting a<br/>
child rule the house.  Seen and not heard are what they believe in.   <br/>
 <br/>
We went to dinner at their house and they expected my children to sit<br/>
still and eat until everyone was done.  That&#39;s not what I expect at my<br/>
own house because if my dh and I want to talk, we&#39;ll sit there for<br/>
awhile.  Same at my parents.  There&#39;s always some long-winded discussion<br/>
going at dinner, this day was no different.  When my children finished<br/>
they wanted to get up (especially my 2yo).  I said I didn&#39;t feel the<br/>
necessity to make them sit through a discussion that they are not<br/>
&quot;allowed&quot; to participate in because they will be chastised for<br/>
&quot;interrupting&quot; when they had eaten and were done.   My 2 yo is sitting<br/>
there crying because my mother was making her sit by not letting her get<br/>
down and giving me a hard time because she wanted to sit in my lap.  I<br/>
snapped and asked why she had to be such a tyrant at the dinner table.<br/>
Granted, it wasn&#39;t a nice thing to say to my mom, but it was the only<br/>
word that fit.  I don&#39;t want to be a dictator in my house and make my<br/>
kids do things just because I was told they should be done that way.  My<br/>
5 yo got up to go to the bathroom - I didn&#39;t notice but my mom did - who<br/>
notices stuff like that and puts a black mark in their mental book?<br/>
Someone who thinks children are here to obey and by doing so become good<br/>
adults.  Isn&#39;t that the same as what  Deb&#39;s mom said about going to<br/>
preschool to learn to respect adults?  Is respect learned by blindly<br/>
obeying?  Or is it from being shown from the beginning that you are a<br/>
person with feelings and thoughts as much as anyone else around you.<br/>
Respect is learned by having your feelings and thoughts respected, too.<br/>
Not saying kids don&#39;t say &quot;disrespectful&quot; things but helping them to<br/>
realize that they have hurt someone else&#39;s feelings is how children<br/>
learn to respect others.  <br/>
 <br/>
This got very long . I have been doing a lot of thinking about how I was<br/>
raised to view children by the way my parents raised me.  I&#39;m going<br/>
completely against my parents&#39; grain by viewing my children as people<br/>
with thoughts and feelings.   They don&#39;t &quot;run&quot; the house but they do<br/>
know their feelings and thoughts are as important as anyone else&#39;s in<br/>
the family.  That they are part of our family and not just an extension<br/>
of myself and my dh.  I think that is where my first paradigm shift took<br/>
place (this may be a personal shift others here have not needed to go<br/>
through but I needed to make it before I could even begin to get the<br/>
rest).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199211150">Rheta - I think you are so brave!  Standing up to my parents and in-laws has been really hard for me, so I am really impressed by your post.  One thought (that may or may not be helpful):  I think going over to your mother&#39;s house is optional.  In fact, having anything at all to do with your mother is optional.  Who says you have to spend time with her?  If you weren&#39;t related by blood, is she someone you would choose to spend time with?  If she weren&#39;t realted to you, is she someone you would leave your children with?  Personally, I avoid people who are out to &quot;fix&quot; me or my children.  Maybe it&#39;s just that I know that my own self-esteem can&#39;t handle too many of these little attacks--those moments when someone questions how I am doing things.   And I know that I am parenting in a completely different way than me or my husband were raised.  Maybe I&#39;m just trying to limit their influence by spending less and less time with them.  But I do know for sure that I&#39;ve got more important things to do than argue with someone about how I&#39;m living my life.  Deirdre <br/>

<br/>
If they&#39;re that old, I think undoubtedly.  But it was 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s in the <br/>
speculation:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Maybe THEY over-efficiently internalized their own depression-era parents.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is much like a guy who lived through the depression.   Why?  <br/>
Genetics, maybe, in part.  Both his parents&#39; hobbies and focus involve not eating <br/>
much and not spending much.  I was there one day when his dad finished a roll <br/>
of scotch tape (cheaper brand).  He had noted the price and date and <br/>
roll-length, taped it on the dispenser with a SMALL piece of tape, and when he ran out, <br/>
he calculated how long it had lasted and what the price per foot had been, and <br/>
reported this to my mother in law, who seemed happily impressed.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re in their late 80&#39;s.  Their 56th wedding anniversary (maybe 57th) is <br/>
tomorrow.  <br/>
<br/>
Stereotypes or real causes?  Nature or nurture?   They&#39;ve had the depression, <br/>
and WWII.  He was a Navy recon pilot in the Pacific; she was a nurse.  They <br/>
are of Scottish ancestry.  They are Presbyterian.<br/>
<br/>
They seem baffled that my kids have so much stuff.  <br/>
They give checks for gifts.<br/>
We used to give them checks and now we don&#39;t.  We were there one Christmas <br/>
when she laughed derisively at gifts from the other sons (who weren&#39;t there) so <br/>
I can only imagine if we hadn&#39;t been there ours would&#39;ve gotten the same <br/>
treatment.  (In fact one was returned to us while we were there, but politely, if <br/>
such a thing can be polite.)<br/>
<br/>
They would not think tap shoes outside a tap-dance class or dance performance <br/>
would have any virtue or purpose.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being a kid and taps were sold separately and could be put on any <br/>
shoes, and it was the fad for a while for older kids to put taps on their <br/>
shoes.<br/>
<br/>
We used to try to get soda-pop lids to stick in our shoes sometimes just so <br/>
we&#39;d make noise when we walked. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=- I don&#39;t think I ever really understood that my parent&#39;s<br/>

<br/>
Some people just get in the habit of bitching about everything, though, and <br/>
maybe they don&#39;t realize they do it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873169863">&lt;&lt;We&#39;ve had better luck in public places with the inlaws than at their house or ours.&gt;&gt;<br/>
We have learned not to leave my kids alone with mom when they are young.  My mom is a wonderful woman and has much to offer my kids - i don&#39;t want to cut off their relationship but need to monitor or be there to protect my kids from some of her attitudes that i think are offensive to young children.  I&#39;ve attempted to talk to my mom about it but she feels criticized and gets defensive.  I&#39;ve gotten better at sharing my ideas with her without it being about her and her ways...but she still doesn&#39;t integrate my understandings into her behaviour.  So, i continue to model (and be taken advantage of - according to her &lt;g&gt;) at the same time - she has expressed awe of my infinite patience.  Patience has nothing to do with it (most of the time).  I think once you have an understanding of being in the moment and living respectfully with all people you don&#39;t need &quot;patience.&quot;  For me, patience is called upon when expectations gets in the way of being in the moment and acceptance of individuality.  <br/>
<br/>
Now my mother adores being with my 10dd.  She says she such a joy, so self expressive and interesting. (This is so funny considering my mother thinks unless someone has an advanced degree they are uneducated).  <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s really interesting.  I&#39;ve had friends say I&#39;m really patient with my <br/>
kids.  I don&#39;t consider myself to be a very patient person.  I don&#39;t like to <br/>
wait, I don&#39;t like to sit still, I&#39;m easily frustrated.  But maybe the way <br/>
you&#39;ve worded your explanation gives me an idea of what my friends were saying with <br/>
&quot;patient.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they had just never seen anyone be respectful with a child, and it <br/>
looked like patience.<br/>
<br/>
When they saw, for example maybe, a little-boy Kirby trying over and over to <br/>
get a straw into a soda lid by himself and not wanting help, they saw him <br/>
taking too long, or &quot;needing help&quot; or wasting time or being in danger of spilling <br/>
a soda.   I saw him as learning, and feeling big, and doing something on his <br/>
own, and it didn&#39;t matter to me if it took him five or ten minutes.  The second <br/>
he got tired of it and asked for help I was ready to do it for him, but not a <br/>
moment before that.  So that seemed like patience, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad for what you wrote because I had an unfinished stuck-thought about <br/>
it.<br/>
