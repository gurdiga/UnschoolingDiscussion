&lt;&lt; Then they came to me, I think about 18 months or so ago (maybe a little<br/>
longer) and said, &quot;Can we buy some pajamas?&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, now *I* want to know where they got that idea.<br/>
Was it watching TV?<br/>
<br/>
Did you have to BUY your children something just because they saw it on TV?<br/>
<br/>
AND... here you raised your children the way you thought was right,  only to <br/>
have them see some fictional TV thing, and they want to be like THOSE people <br/>
instead of like you?<br/>
<br/>
Pajamas.<br/>
<br/>
Next they&#39;ll want UZIs.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has been watching Cyndi Lauper videos (Twelve Deadly Cyns, DVD with <br/>
commentary--I highly recommend it) and wants to be and dress more like Cyndo <br/>
Lauper than she already inadvertently was doing.<br/>
<br/>
I offered to look up lyrics for one of the songs online for her, and print <br/>
them out.  She said &quot;No, that&#39;s okay,&quot; reached over and changed the settings <br/>
to have subtitles, and started singing right along.  OVER and over and over.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind.  And on one song Ms. Lauper plays recorder, so now Holly thinks <br/>
my recorder playing is cooler.   And maybe, who knows, Holly will make her <br/>
living by being a Cyndi Lauper impersonator when she grows up, and those <br/>
hours spent singing along and memorizing the dance steps on the videos is <br/>
more important to her than a chemistry class to a pharmacist.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly was asking me what pharmacists do.  I told her, and told her <br/>
that not long ago they were required to study Latin and doctors and <br/>
pharmacists communicated by secret and universal &quot;code,&quot; but now they pretty <br/>
much only dispense pre-made medicines from factories and advise on side <br/>
effect.   And that comes off the computer.  So anyone want to defend the <br/>
current educational requirements for dispensing pharmacists??<br/>
