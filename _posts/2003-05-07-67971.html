 </span></blockquote>Wow! I am amazed how many of us had this kinda crap going on in our schools ~ <br/>
and all over the ding dang country, too! :::eek::: By 6th grade I had read <br/>
all of the books in our teeny tiny school library and I wasn&#39;t allowed (by my <br/>
parents) to use the public library ... so I was sneaking romance novels into <br/>
school, as that was the only thing I had to read.  Instead of encouraging me <br/>
by giving me more appropriate books to read, I was sent home with a report <br/>
card that said *reads too much*  Luckily, my best friend&#39;s mom was a school <br/>
teacher in another district and *she* (not my mom!) went to my teacher and <br/>
chewed her out!! I remember her saying &quot;How do you expect these kids to learn <br/>
anything if you&#39;re not encouraging them to read!!&quot; Same woman made sure I had <br/>
*appropriate* reading materials to bring to school.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; By 6th grade I had read <br/>
<br/>
all of the books in our teeny tiny school library and I wasn&#39;t allowed (by my <br/>
<br/>
parents) to use the public library ... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had a very sweet situation.  Once I read up the library, I started on the <br/>
public library.  It was about five blocks from school, and the kid-trail <br/>
leading there went across &quot;the corn patch&quot; (which maybe once was a corn patch <br/>
but had long been the  vacant-lot baseball field the school used for P.E.), <br/>
behind city hall (a big Victorian house, very rare for our town), down the <br/>
front stairs and into the big irrigation ditch.  Not paved, dirt.  Across one <br/>
road, along the ditch behind some houses, through a vacant lot, through a <br/>
space in a coyote fence kids could fit through but adults could not (coyote <br/>
fence is a lashed-pole wall, kind of, really common in northern New Mexico), <br/>
and across the tiny city police parking lot to the library, which was in an <br/>
old adobe building.  Very cool and quiet.  <br/>
<br/>
I rode a late bus, so I had 35 or 40 minutes from the time school was out til <br/>
the bus came, from 5th grade to 9th.   <br/>
<br/>
PERFECT!  <br/>
I only missed the bus a couple of times.<br/>
<br/>
If only that library had had more and better books!!<br/>
