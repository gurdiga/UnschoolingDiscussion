<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461146272">Yes, you did just the right things.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
CPS **HAS** to investigate every claim.  Therefore if some neighbor or upset<br/>
relative called, they had to respond.  As you child is 6 and below the<br/>
complusary attendence age, then this should be the end of it.  What did the<br/>
worker say to you when she arrived? Did she leave you a card or say anything<br/>
about what she would need to do next to close the file?<br/>
<br/>
What you need to do next is contingent on what policy she must follow.<br/>

Very interesting.<br/>
So good.  If they ask the neighbors they&#39;ll say you&#39;re fine.<br/>
If they HAVE family contacts you didn&#39;t give them yourself, that means they <br/>
got family contacts from... family!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194042220">HSLDA won&#39;t be a help.  They deal with school age kids AND they do not help<br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
The educational neglect can&#39;t be a problem since the kids aren&#39;t required to<br/>
be in school and that should have been quickly cleared up by telling them<br/>
the age.<br/>
<br/>
As to the other two, well, when did they say they would be back?  If they<br/>
didn&#39;t say, then they plan on a sneak attack because they will be back.  All<br/>
states mandate that you have to check the children themselves if there are<br/>
reports of physical abuse.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a pediatrician that you are on real good terms with and<br/>
insurance that covers well-baby visits, etc., I would trot off to the doc&#39;s<br/>
and have him/her do a check and sign a statement that there aren&#39;t any signs<br/>
of physical abuse.  This was what we recommended to clients when I<br/>
coordinated an ICWA program.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-185750348">I would urge to immediately become familiar with the education code in your<br/>
state.  It is my understanding that compulsory education effective anywhere<br/>
until the first grade, so you should be safe there.<br/>
<br/>
In California, without a court order all I am required to show them is a<br/>
copy of my R-4. And I dont have to let them in to inspect my home without a<br/>
court order. I agree it was a good thing that the children were not home,<br/>
from what I have heard of CPS they sometimes remove children FIRST and ask<br/>
questions later :(<br/>
<br/>
My prayers are with you<br/>
