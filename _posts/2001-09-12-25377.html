Here in conservative, rural MT,  liberal, tree hugger, vegan is<br/>
synonymous with communist!   Add unschooling and WOW!  ( never mind<br/>
religion! )<br/>
I lived on a commune for a few months in my younger days.  A most<br/>
profound experience.<br/>
<br/>
I hear so often that unschooling makes kids so   &quot; different &quot;  from<br/>
other kids.   I&#39;m thinking these kids being different already ( from<br/>
families that don&#39;t fit the norm ) is just one more reason to unschool.  <br/>
Knowing some of the problems faced at the public school by some of my<br/>
friends children ( who are mainstream )  I shudder to think of what my<br/>
little guy might have faced.   <br/>
<br/>
How is unschooling working out for a communist in Texas?<br/>

for kids who (or kid&#39;s whose parents) refuse to abide<br/>
by the norm.<br/>
