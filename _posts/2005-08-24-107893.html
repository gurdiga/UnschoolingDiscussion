&gt; went through this with<br/>
&gt; privilege vs. right). I&#39;m interested in exploring that.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I thought I saw it as a word choice issue, but since the dictionary <br/>
&gt; does not I&#39;ll try another approach:)  SO I guess then the difference <br/>
&gt; for me is in application.  It doesn&#39;t fit with my parenting philosophy <br/>
&gt; if a judgment is handed down and compliance is expected. I also see <br/>
&gt; that as having the potential to cut off the flow of discussion.  It <br/>
&gt; stops us from getting at the need because the focus turns to the &#39;bad&#39; <br/>
&gt; behavior.  This may be different for me because Afton is so quick to <br/>
&gt; be hard on herself.  Her internal judgments are harsh and quick, so I <br/>
&gt; certainly don&#39;t need to be adding to that.  I try to get her to look <br/>
&gt; beyond what she did to &#39;why&#39; and how she thinks she could have handled <br/>
&gt; it differently. It isn&#39;t important how I think she should handle it, <br/>
&gt; but instead what she would like to do differently. I can provide my <br/>
&gt; opinion but ultimately it is up to her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess I&#39;m interpreting what you are doing as handing down edicts - <br/>
&gt; &quot;a proclamation issued by an authority figure&quot;.  Keep in mind, this <br/>
&gt; may not be what you are doing at all :) it&#39;s just how I&#39;m reading it.  <br/>
&gt; So in that scenario it&#39;s the authority figure that I don&#39;t like, that <br/>
&gt; somehow the authority figure&#39;s opinion/judgment is more important or <br/>
&gt; even the final word. It supercedes the individual&#39;s judgment of a <br/>
&gt; situation.  I also believe it ceases to become just information when <br/>
&gt; there are consequences attached or expectation of compliance to the <br/>
&gt; opinion or principle.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, so for me, I wouldn&#39;t say there are consequences for not following <br/>
the proclamation issued by an authority--no authority and no <br/>
consequences, at least not consequences with which I am uncomfortable <br/>
with in Unschooling terms. So, we&#39;re back to privilege/ right, which I <br/>
brought up, so...<br/>
<br/>
If the judgment is &quot;hitting hurts&quot; then the consequence will be no <br/>
proximity with the object of one&#39;s aggression--either because one of the <br/>
two parties have removed or I am between them. Technically, that can be <br/>
considered an externally imposed consequence. I don&#39;t see it as a <br/>
consequence in punitive terms; I see it as protection.<br/>
<br/>
I think, for me, it boils down to better and worse choices that are <br/>
situationally- and principle-based. A better choice is one that is more <br/>
Considerate/ Respectful/ Safe, etc.; a worse choice is less Considerate/ <br/>
Respectful/ Safe, etc. I would like my children to have the tools of <br/>
discernment that allow them to choose better and worse choices. I think <br/>
I can gently help them develop those tools by genuinely sharing my use <br/>
of such tools.<br/>
<br/>
Better and worse, for me, allow for a continuum--lots of gray shades <br/>
rather than a black/white dichotomy. So, for instance, I would be more <br/>
comfortable and likely to ask &quot;Can we come up with a better choice?&quot; <br/>
than I would be to label something as a &quot;bad&quot; choice. For me, there are <br/>
very few things in life that I see as black and white, as truly good or <br/>
truly bad. And nothing I see as absolutes for all times and all places <br/>
and all people.<br/>
<br/>
But, I do believe in moral conviction. I hold the moral conviction that <br/>
killing is bad. I believe it strongly, deep down in my being. That&#39;s not <br/>
to say that I can&#39;t think of situations where circumstances may justify <br/>
making a morally bad choice in order to prevent a worse outcome. For me, <br/>
however, that&#39;s a *very* heavy choice to make. Although I believe in a <br/>
moral conviction such as &quot;killing is bad,&quot; that doesn&#39;t mean that I <br/>
judge a person who kills as a bad person. I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t believe one <br/>
transfers to the other. There&#39;s a middle term of blame that is missing <br/>
from that logical syllogism. For that to transfer, I would have to <br/>
accept the premise that all people who engage in an act I deem as bad <br/>
are bad people, and I do not accept that premise. Compassion, <br/>
understanding and love prevent that middle term from having purchase in <br/>
my heart or mind. I believe there can be opinion, judgment and <br/>
discernment without blame.<br/>
