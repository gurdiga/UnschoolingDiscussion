&lt;&lt; The next theme is on democracy at home and community. I am looking for <br/>
someone to perhaps speak (write) on behalf of democracy (if or when it applies) <br/>
at home or within homeschool groups. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Paul, <br/>
Maybe you can collect responses to what I&#39;m about to post, and publish the <br/>
good parts of those?   Or maybe someone here would love to write about the topic <br/>
and could coordinate with Paul on the side, or maybe volunteer to write a <br/>
post incorporating quotes from what&#39;s below (which might be worthless and <br/>
expendable) and (or only) the responses.<br/>
<br/>
When I ran an unschooling group, starting many years back and fizzling out <br/>
four years ago, it wasn&#39;t at all democratic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The group had grown out of a playgroup of La Leche League families.  First <br/>
phase was always at the same park (and I was a new member, not an organizer).  <br/>
Those organizers fell away and those most regular wanted to change parks.  This <br/>
was pre-decent-e-mail and pre-webpage, and I used to pass out little booklets <br/>
of maps (hand drawn and notated) to the next six or seven parks.  We called <br/>
it &quot;Park Parties&quot; and &quot;The Park Explore.&quot;  After about a year, some of the <br/>
newer families started to complain about one park or another being too babyish or <br/>
too dangerous for little kids, or too close to a road, or not enough shade.  <br/>
Basically they wanted to stick to one park. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So I had lived through a whole set of change with that group, but at least <br/>
there were kids my kids had hung out with through the whole time, and always <br/>
some new ones.<br/>
<br/>
Families with oldest kids Kirby&#39;s age got to the school-choice age and many <br/>
chose school.  With another mom who had chosen homeschooling a year or two <br/>
before, we decided to shift the focus to unschooling, and we made three rules <br/>
before we advertised it.  The rules were based on our certain knowledge of what <br/>
problems had come before and they were:<br/>
<br/>
No field trips<br/>
No officers<br/>
No discussing curriculum<br/>
<br/>
Of course that made us the defacto &quot;officers&quot; or enforcers, and we didn&#39;t <br/>
mind, because if we were going to be there, and have the back-up plan and do the <br/>
contacting and reminding, we didn&#39;t want other people trying to turn it into a <br/>
&quot;learning co-op&quot; or a curriculum-whining session.<br/>
<br/>
To reinforce our intent, we called it &quot;The Goof Group.&quot;  Then we put little <br/>
flyers with a map to the starting park, and the three rules, in several places <br/>
we thought people would be.  It took very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
It was a strong group with sometimes 18 families, for several years (more on <br/>
the list, but that many attending).  Stayed at one park for a season, we had <br/>
some public-indoor-site rotation winters (didn&#39;t work so well, some families <br/>
complained if there was food for sale, some complained if there was any <br/>
expense).  Eventually when we bought a big house, the meetings were at our house.  <br/>
After a year and some of that, my boys had reached their frustration level.  It <br/>
had come to be us doing other families a favor by introducing them to other <br/>
unschooling families and helping them have contacts.  We weren&#39;t benefitting <br/>
anymore, there was a lot of cleanup (physical and social--handholding of members <br/>
who wish other members weren&#39;t just the way they were), a couple of people left <br/>
because I said, &quot;No, really, if you want to do a field trip just announce it, <br/>
but it&#39;s not going to be a field trip of this group, and our family is <br/>
definitely not going.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone had a list of all the other people&#39;s names and phone numbers and <br/>
kids&#39; names and that was unbroken tradition since the third group back.    But <br/>
others wouldn&#39;t organize things, they would just whine at me to change policies <br/>
and do it THEIR way.<br/>
<br/>
Not democracy.  It was me and Monica Cordova providing an opportunity that <br/>
was still a reason for us to get our kids together every week, and which helped <br/>
some unschoolers and lots of relaxed and eclectic homeschoolers who did have <br/>
curriculum problems and concerns but were wise enough not to tell us about them.<br/>
<br/>
As to my family, we do something I consider to be much better than democracy. <br/>
 We built a freedom nest for our kids.  Who else could have?  <br/>
<br/>
I was in a discussion years ago among homeschoolers about the nature of <br/>
freedom.  Some said freedom is natural and god-given.  I disagree.  I think freedom <br/>
is given and defended.   We have given our kids LOTS of freedom, but they <br/>
have it because we gave it to them.  And we have responsibilities (legal, moral) <br/>
that we still have to hold in mind, so if a child&#39;s free choices go beyond the <br/>
boundaries of what the city/state/government allow, we (my husband and I) <br/>
need to do something.  First plan has always been to explain and reason and <br/>
persuade.  That has worked in all but a handful of minor instances.  In those <br/>
instances, it becomes &quot;freedom denied,&quot; but those  have been about things like <br/>
firecrackers or other loud noise  too late at night and being out and about after <br/>
midnight when they were very young (city parks have &#39;closed&#39; hours, and it <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s right by your house).<br/>
<br/>
Some people confuse freedom with anarchy, and choices with wild destruction.  <br/>
Freedom has a context and boundaries.    Even when the earth was sparsely <br/>
populated  by a few small groups who might&#39;ve thought they were the only humans <br/>
in the world, their freedom would be limited by the group&#39;s needs and safety <br/>
concerns, and by what other neighboring groups or species would allow.   Freedom <br/>
to hike for miles alone gave lions the opportunity to exercise their freedom <br/>
to eat you.<br/>
<br/>
So in my two major experiences, I didn&#39;t set up a democratic system either <br/>
time.  I&#39;m a benign dictator, or a generous monarch or something.   My husband <br/>
rarely vetoes plans or policies because he knew me for almost ten years before <br/>
Kirby was born and if he didn&#39;t trust me he wouldn&#39;t have stuck around, and <br/>
anyway I&#39;ve always incluced him in the benefits of the (weird) designer life <br/>
we&#39;ve lived.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of times it looks like democracy here, but it&#39;s more like individuals <br/>
having options within the stated plan.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re wanting to go to a restaurant because we&#39;re on the road, we will <br/>
find a mutually agreeable place if we can.  Last road trip, we went into a KFC <br/>
because Holly wanted macaroni and cheese, and the others were interested in <br/>
accommodating her desire.  After Kirby and Marty already knew what they wanted, we <br/>
found they had no mac&cheese.  So we said, &quot;Oh, sorry, that was the thing we <br/>
came in for.  Sorry.&quot;  And we left in search of a mac&cheese place.   When we <br/>
got there it was way too crowded and the kids were very hungry, so we ate at a <br/>
Taco Bell next door.     It wasn&#39;t the work of an evil dictator, but had it <br/>
been &quot;democracy,&quot; we would have stayed at KFC because the group had made a <br/>
majority decision and our goal was accomplished once a restaurant was chosen.<br/>
<br/>
So what we do is more consensus on mutual days, than democracy.<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s another thing we do, and that is &quot;whose day is it?&quot;   If Holly <br/>
needs something from the store, her brothers are probably welcome to go (unless <br/>
her real request was some alone time with a parent), but Holly gets the front <br/>
seat, because it&#39;s her trip.    Yesterday was Kirby&#39;s birthday and he got <br/>
decisions weighted in his favor, if other factors were equal.  But that&#39;s a <br/>
management decision, too.  It&#39;s something my husband and I figured out was a <br/>
peace-tool long ago.  There are precedence issues, and letting the oldest child have <br/>
precedence all the time is unfair and oppressive.   When we went to Holly&#39;s <br/>
girl scout presentation, it was a Holly night.  We left when she was ready, we <br/>
went to a restaurant she chose.   It was a freedom and privilege and power she <br/>
had because her parents gave it to her.  And the boys go along with that <br/>
because they know they will have situations in which they are supported and <br/>
followed by the rest of the family.<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a good one to write an article on democracy if the <br/>
intent is to show democracy in its classic, idealized American-mythology form.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-412661633">Actually in a nut-shell I suppose my intent is to break the mold of the traditional held &quot;myths&quot; of democracy and to delve into the meaning of the &quot;d&quot; word, readily supported by those classic ideals. My other objective to those interested is to speak more on behalf of the consensus process that occurs in the home and community.Some questions in the wind... &quot;What works for you as an individual or within group settings?&quot; and &quot;What is this popular rhetorical word democracy really about?&quot; - &quot;Are families commonly democractically structured?&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
Basically just would like to stir up a pool for discussion by the &quot;experts. As a student, unmarried and without children myself, I have many curiosities about family ideals and how this can relate on a community level and possible global... I greatly appreciate the feedback, it is very insightful and thought provoking. Peas! Paul<br/>
