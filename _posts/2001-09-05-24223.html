 </span></blockquote>We like the game boy advance for its portability, and if you use rechargable<br/>
batteries, there&#39;s not so much waste/expense with them (it takes 2AA).<br/>
There sure seems to be enough variety out there for our family -- I bought<br/>
it for my son, who plays pacman and chess on it, but Dad plays chess on it,<br/>
too, and I play tetris after they both go to bed!  :)<br/>
<br/>
We had a game boy color long ago, which was stolen, so we got advance.  It<br/>
is nicer, in my mind.  Bigger screen.  The only problem I&#39;ve ever had with<br/>
it was the theft of the first one.  Small is easier to steal, I suppose, but<br/>
it also goes to all sorts of &quot;boring&quot; meetings and on the train and in the<br/>
car.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mary&#39;s right; it might not. &lt;G&gt; Or it might take a loooong time.<br/>
<br/>
I was horse crazy as a child. My mother thought it would just pass---ALL <br/>
little girls are horse crazy, right? She happily paid for piano lessons for <br/>
three years (6-9), and then dance lessons for four years (9-13), while I <br/>
begged constantly for riding lessons. She wanted a sweet, little musical <br/>
dancer for a daughter---NOT a grubby, dirty rider. Besides it&#39;s dangerous!<br/>
<br/>
By 13, I was old enough (and maybe LOUD enough) to be heard and I finally got <br/>
riding lessons. I was obsessed. Daddy got me my first horse when I was 14. My <br/>
second when I was 16. That&#39;s all I did (well, a little dog training too) when <br/>
I wasn&#39;t in school. I rode hunters, jumpers, eventers. College came and went. <br/>
At 22 I rode racehorses for Frank Whitely. At 24 I opened a tack shop; I was <br/>
STILL horse obsessed! I rode a litle after getting married and a dozen or so <br/>
times after having Cameron, but it&#39;s finally something that I DID. The <br/>
obsession&#39;s over! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I had a good &quot;career&quot; in horses. It WAS something I would do all day to <br/>
the exclusion of a lot of things.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily for many of us, Stephen Spielburg&#39;s mama didn&#39;t harp on his constant <br/>
movie-viewing and -making. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no crystal ball to see what our children will &quot;become&quot;, but they&#39;re <br/>
do damned good at being who/what they are RIGHT NOW! Video gaming *could* <br/>
play right into his future.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has a wonderful tape of the benefits of video gaming as well as some <br/>
articles up on her site. You should buy the tape and visit the site!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-78345852">Hello fellow unschoolers!!<br/>
<br/>
I have ages 12 and down in my home and since the<br/>
oldest was an infant, we have provided and encouraged<br/>
computers.  They have helped to teach practically<br/>
everything.<br/>
<br/>
The computer GAMES were a worry to me and my husband<br/>
at first until we realized that some of the games<br/>
enhanced such things as general knowledge, vocabulary,<br/>
writing, spelling, eye-hand coordination,<br/>
inventiveness, thinking skills, imagination (yes there<br/>
is a place for this in games, plus it is enhanced by<br/>
the sights sounds colours and ideas presented in each<br/>
game), and also basic skills practice.  My kids play<br/>
games specifically intended for and also not geared<br/>
towards typical &quot;educational&quot; programs.  Both<br/>
varieties teach and enhance to some degree.  <br/>
<br/>
I was amazed and delighted when my younger child<br/>
brought up more advanced vocabulary the other day in<br/>
general conversation. When asked where she had learned<br/>
this, she told me all about the elaborate game<br/>
situation in which she had been involved and it was a<br/>
great conversation.<br/>
<br/>
My son can go on about historical references facts and<br/>
figures and name all sorts of weaponry et/cetera.<br/>
Fascinating that a game like Battlefield 1942 gave<br/>
some insight into some popular historical times. <br/>
<br/>
EVERYTHING is educational.  It depends absolutely upon<br/>
your perceptions. ~Amy Loughrey, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolerof3@...">unschoolerof3@...</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904498054">Hi Sonya<br/>
<br/>
Lemme tell you about imagination. First of all, your boy is probably <br/>
going to play a lot at first. Let him. It won&#39;t ruin his imagination; <br/>
it will just give him something new to attach it to.<br/>
<br/>
Example. The other day, we&#39;re driving down the road (backroad, in the <br/>
country) and my 10 year old son is riding shotgun, seatbelt around <br/>
his waist, but not around his shoulders, window down, head out the <br/>
window. He was on the lookout for...Rock Monsters, I think it was. <br/>
<br/>
The sound effects emanating from this boy were a wonder to behold, <br/>
and once in awhile he&#39;d pull his head in and &quot;type&quot; firing orders on <br/>
the dashboard, then back out the window again w/the sound effects. <br/>
Once, he pulled inside and said &quot;Did you see THAT?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
...er, no...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I got a THOUSAND of them, with just that one shot! It&#39;s the blaster <br/>
bomb we picked up back there. It can destroy many rock monsters in <br/>
one shot.&quot; LOL he&#39;s been doing computer game sound effects since he <br/>
was three years old. <br/>
<br/>
In the book &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; I was pleased to read about <br/>
imaginative play that Jem and Scout engaged in...they played what I <br/>
imagine lots of kids read in those days: The Rover Boys. It&#39;s <br/>
mentioned just in passing, Scout missing Jem because he&#39;s getting too <br/>
big to play Rover Boys.<br/>
<br/>
My dad played Indians a la Last of the Mohicans. My brother and I <br/>
played Gunsmoke, because it was a favorite tv show in our house. I&#39;m <br/>
sure our play time was riddled with characters and plots from many <br/>
shows, cartoons, books, and so forth. I&#39;m sure every crop of kids <br/>
does the same thing, whether the source is books, shows, or these <br/>
days video games. <br/>
<br/>
The newness will wear off, and he&#39;ll have some new material from <br/>
which to concoct his play time. Honest.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>

<br/>
My sister had three kids all close in age, and about my boys&#39; ages.  They&#39;re <br/>
all teens now.  <br/>
When they were little, Kirby (mine) had a Nintendo, but she said she would <br/>
NEVER buy a game system, because when her kids got around one that&#39;s all they <br/>
wanted to do and they&#39;d fight over it.  She said she would spend her money on <br/>
something else.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;Would you rather get something that&#39;s not worth fighting over?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We discussed WHY kids would be so fascinated with something that it was worth <br/>
fighting over, and what good there could be in something so mesmerizingly <br/>
wonderful that they could do it for hours.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; The sound effects emanating from this boy were a wonder to behold, <br/>

and once in awhile he&#39;d pull his head in and &quot;type&quot; firing orders on <br/>
<br/>
the dashboard, then back out the window again w/the sound effects. <br/>
<br/>
Once, he pulled inside and said &quot;Did you see THAT?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

and there was a little boy we didn&#39;t know, about five or six.  He was standing <br/>
by himself between us and the stage where a band was playing.  Very intently he <br/>
reached over, turned a key, looked like, pulled something (invisible) out of <br/>
a(n invisible) console, struck a pose, and shuddered and stretched and <br/>
repositioned himself and looked in the face bigger and different, and walked away <br/>
with a different posture.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Did you see him transform!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly said &quot;Yeah!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Clearly transforming. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105137313">Hi Sonya, <br/>
When we were relaxed HSing, my younger dd was about 8, and the first computer games came into our house (if those are a lot different from &#39;video games&#39;, I plead ignorance).....before that we had restricted computer time and TV. She began to play one of them, Caveman Rocks, a lot- not quite all the time, but every time she got a chance. So, we just let her, and she would come and get us to show us which level she&#39;d gotten to, or how something worked. She looked a little obsessed (if there is such a thing) by the game. <br/>
Then she got as far as she wanted to go, and stopped playing. Once or twice in the year and a half since, she has tried it. She learned all she could from it and that was it- now it&#39;s of practically no interest. I could try to put what she learned into educationese, but I&#39;m lazy or too busy learning other things myself. Since then I&#39;ve been more willing to trust and let something burn itself out, and am in process of looking at our families unwritten rules about following interests, spending money, what is of value, etc......Hope this helps......<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-86493396">Thanks again to all of you who responded.  <br/>
Pam, I actually did play with my son and we had a lot of fun <br/>
together.  Well I did he kept yelling no mom you don&#39;t know how to <br/>
play !! LOL................ Anyway I was watching him drive on his <br/>
James bond game and I was laughing hysterically and he was getting a <br/>
kick out of it. He kept reassuring me he wouldn&#39;t really drive like <br/>
that in real life. LOL................... It is a lot of fun !!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I will look into the game guides you described to me Sandra. I have <br/>
not seen them as of yet but I am interested in looking to understand <br/>
in how I can help him further his game.<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Sonya</div>

<br/>
Just last night I too was told I was doing it all wrong!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The game guides are great as is the Nintendo Power magazine (if you have a Nintendo system).  My son reads them all the time.  The other thing he uses a lot is www.gamefaqs.com since lately we&#39;ve found published guides harder to come by (we don&#39;t have any gaming-specific stores nearby).  They have guides and FAQs written by players ... usually multiple ones per game so he can choose the style that he likes best.  You can read them to him for now, though I&#39;d bet having something interesting to read will help him pick it up.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, my son&#39;s a bit older (11) and just this week he got set up for online gaming through his gamecube ... he&#39;s having an awesome time!  Finally found himself some players that are up to his skill level!  And now he&#39;s learning all about computer chat acronyms.  LOL!!  <br/>

<br/>
Nope .. you only have to join if you want to post on the message boards.<br/>
<br/>
When you get there you can find stuff various ways: search for the game title in the search box on the left; click on the system you want at the top which brings up an alphabetical list of the games for that system; or if the game is popular they have the top ten FAQ pages listed at the right.  Click on the game title and that brings up the info for that game.  There are links across the top for the various pages about that game: game info, faqs & guides, codes & secrets, reviews, message board.  In the faqs & guides section they break it down into general faqs / walkthroughs for the whole game (or as far as the person has gotten), and in-depth faqs that focus on one aspect of the game (collecting stuff, boss battles etc.).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-609116340">Thanks Pam !! I really like that site !! Joey and I went on to check <br/>
it out this mornig and we read about a (007 James Bond) game that he <br/>
is playing.  I was reading some of the stuff to him and he liked it.  <br/>
Also when he was playing later he remembered what we had read and got <br/>
excitied about the information that he got to read ahead of the <br/>
game.  Thanks again<br/>
Sonya<br/>
<br/>
P.S. My son Joey likes the taste of sleepy-time tea by &quot;Celestial <br/>
Seasonings&quot; I add sugar to it because he likes it sweet and I think <br/>
it works. I know it relaxes him anyway. <br/>
<br/>
Also I&#39;m so glad to hear about your daughters reading.  Did you like <br/>
the Harry Potter books ? I wonder if Joey is to young for those (7 <br/>
years) they are pretty big books  !!!!</div>

&lt;&lt;It always amazes me what these little minds are working on. I have a <br/>
friend who doesn&#39;t let her children have video games and doesn&#39;t <br/>
really veiw television as a good thing(she homeschools). I use to be <br/>
that way. I ran into her at a public place and my son loves to share <br/>
his excitment with everyone he sees about his video games. He thinks <br/>
it&#39;s so facinating how he figures things out and loves to talk non-<br/>
stop about it. I thought she would lecture me about why it wasn&#39;t a <br/>
good thing and she surprised me. She said maybe you&#39;ll grow up and <br/>
design video games Joey :)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My eleven year old son loves to talk about video games with absolutely anyone <br/>
he meets whether they&#39;re interested or not.  (Sometimes embarrassing me with <br/>
his enthusiasm.)  Recently he started volunteering at a retirement community, <br/>
and after his first day, he said he didn&#39;t know what to talk to the men about. <br/>
 I said why not bring in your video games next week.  Well he did and they <br/>
all loved playing.  I think he&#39;s on his way to forming some new gaming <br/>
friendships with the over 100 crowd.<br/>
