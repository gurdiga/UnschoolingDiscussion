Knowing cats, you wouldn&#39;t need to.  they know when <br/>
they&#39;re on to a good thing, and I&#39;m assuming that they <br/>
have access to the outside world, so if they weren&#39;t <br/>
ahppy, they&#39;d leave.  Cats are like that.  We got one <br/>
that way.  Dogs, however another thing altogether, and <br/>
while I know that any dog of mine (ha! I wish, dh would <br/>
never...) wouldn&#39;t be abused, they do stay with their <br/>
owners even when they are.  Sad isn&#39;t it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-973951100">Oh dear, I hope not.  There was a group down in the Marin/Sonoma County area<br/>
that was &quot;liberating&quot; pets a couple of years ago.  They took the animals and<br/>
turned them loose so they would be &quot;free&quot; with the end result that several<br/>
dozen pets died of starvation before the local animal rescue folks rounded<br/>
up the balance and saved them.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I&#39;m not saying animals should be vegan, it&#39;s 
nature, or that people should not have pets.&nbsp; For my family it seems 
unsanitary to have an animal kept in a house where they will shed hair, have 
parasites, relieve themselves in a box or in the yard where I would have to pick 
it up.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with animals shedding or going to the 
bathroom, etc., just not in my house.&nbsp; I respect animals for their nature, 
so to me it is unnatural to have animals living with humans.&nbsp; That&#39;s also 
why I don&#39;t eat them.&nbsp; Humans are devastating the earth.&nbsp; We are no 
longer a part of nature/natural balance.&nbsp; As for the environment, cats are 
not part of the natural environment in my area, maybe a mountain lion once upon 
a time.&nbsp;We already have a decline in songbirds&nbsp;because&nbsp;of loss of 
habitat in the rainforest so I really hate finding&nbsp;them dead in my 
yard.&nbsp; The mice and squirrels provide food for the few fox that happen to 
be left in my area.-Collette</font></div>

Once upon a time when I lived in a rural area and still let my cats roam, one <br/>
of the two suddenly disappeared.  Only one came home.  The next morning I <br/>
looked outside just in time to see the biggest owl I&#39;ve ever laid eyes on <br/>
(wing span of at least 5 feet) silently soar over the easement that the cats <br/>
usually played in.  I knew what had happened to the other cat and it looked <br/>
as though the owl was back for seconds.  The other cat didn&#39;t seem to play in <br/>
that easement anymore.<br/>

  <div><br></div><tt>ah! <br>to have someone speak/type your actual thoughts 
  as<br>though they are writing in your name is a very wierd<br>thing. I was 
  just up allll night (as in 4:30am) last<br>night with my boyfriend cuz we had 
  a deep discussion<br>about something and he was done when the 
  discussion<br>was done and I was getting soooo frustrated cuz I<br>can&#39;t just 
  do that. I there is no such thing as<br>absolute closure for me when it comes 
  to thinking and<br>worrying and a forboding feeling and that quote 
  from<br>Sandra is just what I needed. I&#39;m painting it huge and<br>hanging on 
  my wall. <br>Me and my sister are always complaining that we DON&#39;T<br>want to 
  be like other people we know that just stroll<br>along thinking everyhting 
  grand and NEVER think or be<br>concerned with anything, are just happy to 
  be<br>disillusioned with rose colored glasses, (ok,<br>sometimes we do..heeh, 
  but it is actually physically<br>impossible for us)&nbsp; but we take it to 
  the other<br>extreme and can&#39;t shut it off. <br>It&#39;s truly a problem for me, 
  moreso lately, it seems.<br>I know there was a point in my life where I 
  felt<br>content I had come pretty close to finding that<br>balance, but who 
  knows what happened. My dad was sick<br>for awhile and everyday was a worry 
  that that would be<br>the day he died and then he did die and 
  directly<br>following that was a good time for me mentally, cuz I<br>saw 
  things clearly and realized, like Sandra said that<br>you can ruin what life 
  you have right now by worrying<br>about when you&#39;ll die, but that is a hard 
  attitude to<br>keep up when you have precious kids you love and want<br>to 
  protect and it seems nowadays the amount of people<br>who were never abused in 
  any way as a child are in the<br>minority...and parents are nonethewiser, so I 
  am<br>constantly worried that I am missing something<br>important that is 
  seriously damaging my kids somehow,<br>or that I am overlooking some serious 
  health problem<br>and then one of us, or someone we love and are close<br>to 
  will die suddenly, or ...or.... or... <br>I could go on and on. K, sorry to 
  ramble on and on,<br>but it is actually really comforting to me to 
  see<br>other people who ..well...think alot. :) and don&#39;t<br>fall asleep after 
  counting three and saying the magic<br>word. I love it. <br>-Bobbie<br>---

<br/>
You know, I hadn&#39;t thought much about this thread until <br/>
you posted this, Bobbie, but now I get it!  I am like <br/>
this!  especially with the kinder...  like today I find <br/>
this great big scratch down the screen here and I sit <br/>
and wonder what I&#39;m doing wrong that my child would <br/>
feel the need to do this.  Is that crazy?  I spend <br/>
quite a lot of time wondering what I&#39;d do if dh <br/>
suddenly died, basically cos he works from home and I <br/>
have no idea where he&#39;s at with any of the business <br/>
stuff and I have no idea where we are at financially <br/>
too.  I wonder sometimes if the deep thought stuff is <br/>
down to a basic lack of control of some major part of <br/>
life.  For me it&#39;s definitely money.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes it&#39;s definitely a relief to know that there are <br/>
other morbid people out there!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-668995788">Good Lord, Bobbie.  And can you talk that fast too?  And I thought I was<br/>
long winded.  After reading your post (and yes, I did read the whole<br/>
thing and chuckled when you asked who in their right mind would still be<br/>
reading this) I am going to bed (well, I will put my weary little head<br/>
on my pillow and try not to think too much, especially about some<br/>
martians and an ET virus or something like that.)<br/>
Good night, All.<br/>

yup, I can talk that fast too. But I usually don&#39;t.<br/>
With typing I can go back and erase really quick when<br/>
I say jsut instead of just or busty instead of busy or<br/>
when I stutter. In talking I&#39;m just more confusing. So<br/>
I try to keep that to myself, unless you really know<br/>
me well and are already used to it, you would think I<br/>
was a really quiet, withdrawn person of some sort who<br/>
keeps their opinions to themselves...ok, not that last<br/>
part. but the quiet part anyway. (my family would<br/>
LAUGH though if they heard someone say &quot;bobbie&#39;s kind<br/>
of quiet, she doesn&#39;t talk much, does she?&quot;)<br/>
-Bobbie<br/>
who can&#39;t believe you actually read that whole thing.<br/>
curiousity killed the cat you know. :)<br/>
(was that in bad taste, in light of the recent<br/>
conversations about cats? sorry if it was.)<br/>

&gt; My *disease* (I&#39;m determined there must be a medical<br/>

<br/>
lolol.   I think the customary name is &quot;anxiety&quot;.   And *I*  am an<br/>
expert............although I will admit after reading to the very end of  your<br/>
post that you are indeed quite competent in the area.<br/>
