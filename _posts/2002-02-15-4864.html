<div id="ygrps-yiv-713219838">Looking for something, I found (as usual) something else on the way--an <br/>
article I had kinda forgotten about.  It was published locally, but is in the <br/>
unschooling.com library.  This is the last part of it:<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
I&#39;m an unschooler. Lessons are never over. On the other hand, lessons never <br/>
really begin. Children&#39;s question are answered and an atmosphere of learning <br/>
is created so that questions are constant and answers are never far away. <br/>
<br/>
-=-When people ask a structured family how much time it takes to homeschool <br/>
the response usually ranges from three hours a day to six hours a day (much <br/>
more than kids actually spend in classrooms in school). When you ask an <br/>
unschooling family how much time it takes to homeschool, first there&#39;s a <br/>
pause. I&#39;ve heard, in rapid succession in groups of unschoolers, &quot;None&quot; and <br/>
&quot;All of it.&quot; Their range is it takes from zero hours a day to 24 hours a day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When learning is recognized in the fabric of life and encouraged, when <br/>
families make their decisions based on what leads to more interesting and <br/>
educational ends, children learn without effort, often without even knowing <br/>
it, and parents learn along with them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Many homeschoolers fall somewhere between structured and seamless-life <br/>
learners. There are families whose children attend school whose houses are <br/>
learning labs, museums and libraries all rolled into one. Enriching our lives <br/>
for the benefit of our children isn&#39;t just for homeschoolers. Small changes <br/>
in parental attitude are sometimes all it takes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Learning isn&#39;t in fancy books or computer games, it all happens in the <br/>
ideas children have, in the trivial facts they fit together to come up with <br/>
their view of the world--past present and future. You don&#39;t need a lesson or <br/>
a unit to show a child what&#39;s wonderful about woodgrain, ice crystals on the <br/>
windshield, or birdsongs. Five seconds worth of pointing and saying &quot;Look, <br/>
these trees were not native to North America&quot; might possibly lead to an hour <br/>
long discussion, or a lifelong fascination. Bringing something interesting <br/>
home, browsing in an antique shop, listening to new music on instruments <br/>
you&#39;ve never heard--all those build neural pathways and give you a chance to <br/>
be together in a special place.<br/>
<br/>
-=-No matter how your children formally learn, take a few more opportunities <br/>
to share wonder and discovery with them. It will enrich you all.<br/>

<br/>
In schools, &quot;enrichment&quot; centers are where the good stuff is, for the gifted <br/>
kids.<br/>
Why the whole school can&#39;t be &quot;enriched&quot; is because enrichment is relative, <br/>
and ongoing.  Something&#39;s never totally and fully &quot;enriched,&quot; because there <br/>
could always be more added later.  I suppose for someone to be &quot;as enriched <br/>
as Midas,&quot; everything they&#39;d touch would turn to fascination.<br/>
