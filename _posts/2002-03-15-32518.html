  <br/>
Hello ,  <br/>
I just started an egroup to exchange postcard.  I haven&#39;t meet a  <br/>
child that does not enjoy recieving mail.  I figure this would be a  <br/>
fun way to teach them geograpy.  I have only contacted a few  <br/>
unschooling groups so far, but I am hoping to contact all 5o states.   <br/>
Please come and participate.  There are other mail exchange groups  <br/>
that cost money this will only cost a post card and postage and  <br/>
little bit of your child&#39;s time to say hello Im am in which ever  <br/>
state he or she is from.  This will be fun for all ages ( including  <br/>
the 2 and 3 yeard olds.)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you  <br/>
Hazel<br/>
