<div id="ygrps-yiv-194410388">I just had an interesting conversation with one of my housemates...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after withdrawing my boys last January from PS...I picked up at Cosco <br/>
of all places...these two books full of worksheets that supposedly are <br/>
comprehensive for second and third grade...they sat on my shelf for <br/>
awhile...basically after reading so much about unschooling and really feeling <br/>
that unschooling was the route of my family....they just sat on the shelf for <br/>
awhile...I told the boys that if they wanted to use the books go ahead...then <br/>
I bought several computer programs that they could play and use...<br/>
<br/>
Well...after about the sixth week outta PS...my mom and housemates started <br/>
asking questions about what sort of &#39;education&#39; (and I use the term loosely) <br/>
I was giving the boys...mostly...I have been letting them play...we watch <br/>
movies and talk about what happened in them...they would ask questions...I <br/>
would do the best to answer them...we hit the library about once a <br/>
week...they choose videos over books...but no sitting down at the table with <br/>
the intentions of &#39;edumacating the chilluns&#39;...so...I started pulling out <br/>
pages from those workbooks and tell my housemates to have the boys complete <br/>
them before they go to bed...(I work from 3p to 11p)...Now my housemates <br/>
wanna know why I don&#39;t have the boys do the workbooks when I am home so that <br/>
I am &#39;teaching&#39; (and I use that term loosely)...so I confessed...the workbook <br/>
pages are mostly to give ya&#39;ll a sense that they are &#39;learning&#39; and being <br/>
&#39;taught&#39;...so I explain to them...I want the boys to want to learn something <br/>
and I trust that when they are ready to learn something they will learn <br/>
it...and she says...&quot;But they gotta progress...&quot;...and I say...&quot;Don&#39;t worry <br/>
they are.&quot;  The only thing that I truly enforce that my boys do is their <br/>
daily chores...so I told my housemate...if it is too frustrating to have the <br/>
boys do the worksheets...then don&#39;t worry about it...I would rather them not <br/>
be frustrated and resistive when it comes to learning...etc etc...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think my housemates really get the concept of trusting the boys to <br/>
learn what they need to learn when they need to learn it...for me...it is <br/>
overwhelming to even imagine what it would be like to deal with on a daily <br/>
level the frustration of trying to force the boys to sit down at the table to <br/>
educate them to a PS standard...if teaching is frustrating to me and learning <br/>
is frustrating to them...then I can&#39;t imagine either of us getting very much <br/>
out of the experience...I told my housemate...that I would have no problems <br/>
acquiring a curriculum providing the boys helped me find one...I definately <br/>
do not relish the idea of spending x amount of dollars on a curriculum that <br/>
we do not use...lol...<br/>
<br/>
On a sad note...my boys got a very heart wrenching lesson about life and <br/>
death that no PS could ever impart to them...one of our chihuahua&#39;s six week <br/>
old puppies died this evening of a broken neck...a tragic accident with a <br/>
recliner...<br/>
<br/>
Anyways...it off to bed for me...tomarrow is library day...<br/>
