 </span></blockquote>Whew thanks for saying it Joanna.... When I was pregnant with Zak people <br/>
would come up to me all the time and say &quot;you must be so excited and happy <br/>
about being pregnant and having this baby (with lots of smiles and cooing at <br/>
me)&quot;  I would reply &quot;no not really... I&#39;m getting fatter, I&#39;m loosing my <br/>
balance, I&#39;ve got stretch marks, I&#39;m petrified of how painful it&#39;s going to <br/>
be actually giving birth and knowing I have no control over the experience.  <br/>
And on top of that I have no idea what I&#39;m going to feel for this baby and <br/>
I&#39;m not happy right now&quot;.... Luckily I was in England at the beginning of my <br/>
pregnancy and I had a lot of friends that had felt the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Even  when Zak was born (by that time we were in Las Vegas (military then)) I <br/>
was just so glad to get the birth over with and relieved that the pain would <br/>
end soon,  that I didn&#39;t think about how happy I was.  I wasn&#39;t that happy or <br/>
even attached to him until a couple of days after he was born.  Different <br/>
story with my second one, even though I was sick every day of my pregnancy <br/>
for 9 months and it seemed the worst 9 months of my life.... I immediately <br/>
felt bonded to my 2nd...<br/>
<br/>
Some days I wish I didn&#39;t have children and I was that carefree single <br/>
business woman, going to the theater, out to dinner, late parties, friends <br/>
over for drinks, lots of chit chat about the world and interesting things.... <br/>
then Max, who will be 2 on Friday, comes to my office (in my house), put&#39;s <br/>
his hand under my bum and says &quot;move mummy, come here&quot; and takes my hand and <br/>
I have to follow him to see what he needs.  All the thoughts of those good <br/>
old days seem to fade away and into the very distant past....<br/>
<br/>
Just thinking out loud....<br/>
