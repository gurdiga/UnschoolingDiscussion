&gt; speak to him about homeschooling. He says that he is all for<br/>
&gt; homeschooling Karen and that he does not want her to go to public<br/>
&gt; school. But, I think that if I told him tomorrow that I wanted her to<br/>
&gt; go to public school, he would say that was fine as well. His biggest<br/>
&gt; problem with homeschooling has always been that he doesn&#39;t think she<br/>
&gt; will get to socialize enough with other kids. So (not only for him<br/>
&gt; but, for me and my dd as well) I joined a local homeschooling group<br/>
&gt; that meets once a week.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any time I mention getting together at parties or field trips that<br/>
&gt; they go on, he backs out. For example....there is a camp out in July<br/>
&gt; that is only about 1/2 hour from us (sounded like fun to me). I told<br/>
&gt; him tonight that I would like to go (even though DD is only 2) so that<br/>
&gt; we can start to get to know the local homeschoolers and he does not<br/>
&gt; want to go. His reasoning (if you can call if that) is that he<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t want to go because he doesn&#39;t know anyone! I asked him how he<br/>
&gt; thought we were going to get to know anyone if we never went to these<br/>
&gt; things to get to know people?! He didn&#39;t really have an answer except<br/>
&gt; that he has only ever camped with family.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I&#39;m hoping you all might be able to help me. If nothing else,<br/>
&gt; let me know that I&#39;m not the only one with a spouse who isn&#39;t as open<br/>
&gt; minded as he says he is.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My first reaction to this is that I bet your husband&#39;s shy. My partner is <br/>
comfortable talking in front of huge groups of people. But given a gathering <br/>
of people she doesn&#39;t know very well where she needs to make conversation, <br/>
she hates it. She has been known to hide. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Can YOU go to the event and take your daughter? Maybe you&#39;ll get to know <br/>
someone you&#39;ll like, then you can invite them to dinner and they can get to <br/>
know your husband. Or maybe if you happily start planning to go, he&#39;ll get <br/>
tempted and join you. <br/>
<br/>
It also doesn&#39;t sound like he&#39;s not open-minded about homeschooling. What it <br/>
really sounds like is that he trusts your judgement about what will be good <br/>
for your daughter. That&#39;s a very cool thing. Thank him!  If you want him more <br/>
involved, or you want to share your excitement about this stuff, tell him.<br/>

You&#39;re right, I&#39;m just going to start planning to go with my DD (not<br/>
putting any pressure on him to go) and I&#39;d be willing to bet money on<br/>
the fact that he&#39;ll be going with us before it&#39;s all said and done.  :)<br/>
