&gt; &gt; Rain was 10 yesterday, on the 10th. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How is she doing with her cast?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for asking... the good news is that she got it off on Thursday,<br/>
the bad news is that one of the broken bones moved slightly while it was<br/>
in the cast. There&#39;s a noticeable bump, and it was clearly crooked on the<br/>
x-ray. :( The orthopedic surgeon said that since she&#39;s only 10, it&#39;s<br/>
okay, and it will smooth out as she grows... but I did email my dad (he&#39;s<br/>
an M.D.) to see if he knows any orthos who could give a second opinion.<br/>
It just *looks* bad.<br/>
<br/>
She has something else now, I think they called it a brace? It supports<br/>
the wrist but it&#39;s removeable, although her arm hurts when she takes it<br/>
off.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that I called MediCal (the California version of<br/>
medicaid) and they said that if we qualify, they pay medical bills<br/>
retroactive for 3 months. That would be great, since this is at 5K<br/>
already and I&#39;m sure there are more bills to come.<br/>
<br/>
So, now she wants to break her leg to see how that feels. I shared your<br/>
story and Sandra&#39;s, plus the arm seemed pretty painful, as I recall. I<br/>
told her she didn&#39;t have my permission to break any more bones, so she&#39;s<br/>
waiting until she&#39;s 18, and she&#39;s made a mental list of all the people<br/>
she knows will be happy to come and help her out (somehow Joylyn made the<br/>
list but I didn&#39;t, hmmm).  She&#39;s always been like this, though. She<br/>
didn&#39;t vomit until she was 5 or so and she really wanted to get a stomach<br/>
flu for quite a while... she didn&#39;t like it when she had it but she<br/>
wanted the experience.<br/>

<br/>
the bump sounds bad from an adult perspective, but maybe it really is ok for <br/>
a 10 year old.   Glad you are looking into a second opinion.  <br/>
<br/>
My sister broke her arm on my parent&#39;s icy driveway on Christmas morning.  <br/>
She had surgery and external pins, which will be removed once the cast comes <br/>
off in a couple of weeks.  They were worried about the bump with her if the <br/>
cast didn&#39;t hold the bones correctly.  Plus, she&#39;s a triathlete (at almost <br/>
42!) and she needs to have enough strength to ride her bike.<br/>
<br/>
Seems like each break is different.  And I can understand Rain wondering what <br/>
it&#39;s like to break something and wanting to do so.  This was my first break <br/>
ever (at 38) and I don&#39;t recommend it.  I think with legs, and age, it&#39;s that <br/>
the break really hurts, the cast really is a pain and it still hurts and then <br/>
there&#39;s the recovery from being in the cast!  I never knew about the criss <br/>
crossing tissue at the base of your leg in front that totally stiffens up in <br/>
a cast and takes forever to become pliable again.  And when the physical <br/>
therapist said she was pleased with my pointing of my left foot, I removed my <br/>
right shoe to point that one and she said, simply &quot;Oh, my.&quot;  I may never be <br/>
able to regain the extreme flexibilit and hyperextension I had from ballet at <br/>
4 years old.<br/>
<br/>
So, if she&#39;s going to do it, young is the time, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Glad she&#39;s doing better and that it looks like you&#39;ll have some coverage for <br/>
it.  What a nightmare for you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-375411972">It would be cheaper to buy crutches and other such items and let a kid pretend fractures.  10yod has long had a fascination with wheelchairs, etc.  We found kid size crutches at the thrift shop.  They&#39;re a big hit with all the kids who play here.  They also like to wrap their arm &, legs in Ace bandages and pretend that they&#39;ve broken them.  I get some great stories when I ask them what happened.  Maybe I have a future physical therapist here.  Or maybe not, but who knows?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think the crutches are the issue for Rain. We see them at thrift<br/>
stores all the time and she&#39;s never been really interested - I hadn&#39;t<br/>
even mentioned that aspect of broken legs. She just wants the<br/>
*experience*, so she&#39;d know what it was like. It&#39;s a personality thing, I<br/>
think - she&#39;ll try anything once. Nice when it comes to going places I<br/>
want to go, not so nice when it comes to physical injuries and<br/>
illnesses...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It would be cheaper to buy crutches and other such items and let a kid <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great idea!<br/>
<br/>
While I was using crutches full time, the kids kept making their own <br/>
&quot;crunches&quot; (somehow, that tch sound is hard for them) out of stacking pegs, <br/>
tinker toys, etc.  And they would carry mine all over the place - not helpful <br/>
if I wasn&#39;t paying attention.  They loved being pushed in the wheelchair and <br/>
hanging off the back.  They both really worked on their balance by hopping on <br/>
one leg.  That&#39;s helped a lot now that they are using their ballet dvds as <br/>
exercise tapes!<br/>
<br/>
New ones are about $30 at the drug store.  I&#39;m sure there have to be a lot of <br/>
used ones out there - we&#39;ll stash mine in the basement when I&#39;m done.  (They <br/>
will gather dust along with the egg coddlers, empty boxes, boxes full of <br/>
styrafoam chips, outgrown toys, half finished projects of mine and tubs of <br/>
christmas ornaments.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow. Rain tried to ride her bike with the cast on but I talked her out of<br/>
it  - it&#39;s been wet and muddy here for a month, and I just didn&#39;t want<br/>
another broken bone. She did do ballet with the cast, though...<br/>
<br/>
The ortho doc said if she&#39;d been 14 it would have been different, so 42<br/>
sounds definitely over the growth-hump.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;re able to regain that flexibility in your foot - that would<br/>
be a real bummer. I guess I figured that whatever happened, with broken<br/>
bones you&#39;d eventually be &quot;good as new&quot;, but apparently not, or not all<br/>
the time :-/<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never broken a bone, and I can&#39;t say I yearn for the expereince...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, it hasn&#39;t been that long yet.  Only a month with the cast off.  I&#39;m able <br/>
to do 40 minutes on the elliptical with just swelling problems.  I&#39;m getting <br/>
better at stairs, but down is still very stiff.  I didn&#39;t mean to make it <br/>
sound that bad, sometimes even I get sick of hearing my whining!  My pointing <br/>
ability on my right leg is abnormal<br/>
<br/>
On my sister&#39;s arm, the pins were necessary to give her the strength <br/>
eventually once the cast gets off to ride her bike.  Perfect alignment was <br/>
necessary.  Sorry if it wasn&#39;t clear before.  She&#39;s not riding her bike right <br/>
now.  And she&#39;s pretty unhappy about that.<br/>
<br/>
Bones!  I think it&#39;s amazing they can heal.  It reminds me of when we went to <br/>
see Sue, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, at the Field Museum and I read that she not <br/>
only had something like 73 teeth, but they grew back if she lost one.  A <br/>
factoid that got lost in my head in the aging process...<br/>

Iran. The ring finger on my right hand was broken and opened from the knuckle <br/>
under the nail bed to the area where the ring and middle finger meet. The <br/>
doctor set it and stitched it closed. When it healed there was a noticeable <br/>
bump on the top knuckle on the side that is closest to the pinkie finger and <br/>
the finger curves slightly so that it points toward my middle finger. The <br/>
doctor told my parents it would be okay and would smooth out as I grew. It <br/>
didn&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
