&lt;&lt;1...Teachers don&#39;t love my kids or have their best interests truly at<br/>
<br/>
heart, how can they when they only have them for 1 year/grade and must<br/>
<br/>
split their time between 20+ kids.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve reminded me of a great discussion I had with my husband recently.  We <br/>
both read an article (in an old Utne reader) about a teacher who used <br/>
unconventional methods (including playful wrestling in the classroom) to <br/>
connect with a very troubled kid who was acting up a lot at school.  After <br/>
awhile, this kid and the teacher developed a relationship that worked and the <br/>
kid behaved pretty well for the rest of the year.  But on the last day of the <br/>
year the kid set his schoolbooks on fire on the bus.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband persuaded me that the point of the article was that the teacher <br/>
had broken through and created an emotional bond with the kid, BUT the <br/>
teacher was going to be gone from the kid&#39;s life once the school year ended.  <br/>
And everyone accepted that severing of the relationship as normal.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s much better for our kids to love and trust us, their parents, <br/>
and have us *stay* with them, rather than have these disposable relationships <br/>
with teachers.  (I realize there are some exceptions where the teacher takes <br/>
an ongoing interest in the child, beyond the paid experience.)<br/>
