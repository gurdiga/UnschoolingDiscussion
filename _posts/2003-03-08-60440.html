 We see it all as interrelated and intertwined. How can we trust them in one <br/>
 area and not in another? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
I can&#39;t remember if it was on this list or perhaps at the message board, but <br/>
someone was concerned that her children would &quot;just&quot; play legos and such of <br/>
she didn&#39;t make them do other things.<br/>
OH! Maybe it was that eclectic/heretic article in HEM? Anyway....<br/>
Here&#39;s what my boys have been &quot;just&quot; doing with legos all day.<br/>
They have some propellor parts and they&#39;ve been making different things with <br/>
the propellors attached and testing out their ideas over a fan directed at <br/>
the ceiling on full blast.<br/>
Trevor had one creation hovering, but he&#39;s been struggling with another style <br/>
that he really wants to get off the ground so to speak, but is having trouble <br/>
with too much weight, wrong shape etc... <br/>
So he has reworked it at LEAST 20 times and tested it out again and again and <br/>
again....<br/>
&quot;Just&quot; legos have been a source of learning on engineering, wind resistance, <br/>
lift, drag and basic dynamics of flight.<br/>
He doesn&#39;t need to know all that, he&#39;s just having fun.  It&#39;s amazing what <br/>
kids will learn about their world through play.<br/>
How could I impose what I think they need, when they so obviously know <br/>
exactly how to explore and learn about their world in the MOST meaningful way <br/>
for their own life?<br/>
<br/>
I just looked over and Trevor has taken a break from his experimenting to <br/>
show Sierra some letter sounds on the GeoSafari. This kind of stuff would <br/>
never happen if the trust wasn&#39;t there FIRST.<br/>
She&#39;s reading at five years old, and she KNOWS she taught herself. She says <br/>
&quot;you showed me stuff Mom, but I learned it all by myself&quot;. What confidence, <br/>
what balance, what self-knowledge these autodidacts possess!!  It&#39;s been the <br/>
most magical journey ever. They&#39;ve taught me so much....<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

I have a friend who is a retired scientist.  She was telling about a science<br/>
program she did with low income kids and bemoaning the fact that none of<br/>
them had experience with legos and it was making the particular project more<br/>
difficult for them.<br/>
