***********************************<br/>
December Launch:  The Grand Opening<br/>
***********************************<br/>
<br/>
As you may know, in December the Paths of Learning Resource Center<br/>
officially opened its arms to the wider Internet community at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.PathsOfLearning.net">http://www.PathsOfLearning.net</a><br/>
<br/>
After seven months of initial research, design, and development, the Center<br/>
now contains summaries of over 300 innovative educational publications. The<br/>
Center is a free online tool for anyone making decisions about<br/>
education--choosing between student-centered alternatives, seeking more<br/>
ways to nourish different learning styles, or wanting to know more about<br/>
social/political issues involved with systemic change in education. If you<br/>
or your organization have not already linked to our web site, we welcome<br/>
you to do so. On your &quot;links&quot; page, simply place the following information:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.PathsOfLearning.net">http://www.PathsOfLearning.net</a> - a magazine and *free* online resource<br/>
center to help parents, educators, researchers and policymakers who wish to<br/>
learn more about holistic, democratic, or learner-centered approaches to<br/>
teaching and learning.<br/>
<br/>
If the content or focus of your web site revolves around education,<br/>
educational change, school alternatives, or related topics, we also invite<br/>
you to paste a free search tool of the Center&#39;s resources directly into<br/>
your web site. Then, your visitors can look for relevant education<br/>
resources from our Resource Center directly from your own web site. To see<br/>
how this search tool works on other web sites and to access information on<br/>
how to set it up on your own site, please visit the sample currently posted<br/>
at the Center for Inspired Learning:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
*******************<br/>
Resource Highlights<br/>
*******************<br/>
<br/>
As a searchable database, the types of materials indexed by Paths of<br/>
Learning Resource Center that you will not often find in other databases<br/>
include:<br/>
<br/>
* Tables of contents to back issues of such journals as the Holistic<br/>
Education Review, SKOLE: The Journal of Alternative Education, and Radical<br/>
Teacher magazine.<br/>
<br/>
* Summary reviews of such directories and guides as the Almanac of<br/>
Education Choices, The Parents&#39; Guide to Alternatives in Education, and A<br/>
to Z Home&#39;s Cool Homeschooling Web Site.<br/>
<br/>
* Carefully selected summaries from the Department of Education&#39;s resource<br/>
clearinghouse (ERIC) of resources especially pertaining to learner-centered<br/>
and holistic education options.<br/>
<br/>
* Current as well as out-of-print books that have significantly impacted<br/>
how holistic education practices are implemented which are often overlooked<br/>
by mainstream resource clearinghouses. For all books, we try to include<br/>
direct links to the publishers (or out-of-print book resellers). This<br/>
allows you to purchase the book more easily and also support small<br/>
publishers rather than Amazon. Currently, our database contains over 90<br/>
publishers.<br/>
<br/>
Coming soon (in April), we encourage you to visit the Summary Reports<br/>
section of our web site, where you will find reports highlighting resources<br/>
of special interest to families (parents and students), teachers,<br/>
administrators, and researchers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*********************************<br/>
Tips on Using the Resource Center<br/>
*********************************<br/>
<br/>
Based on the feedback we receive from you, the users of the Center, we may<br/>
soon add new tools for searching and browsing our reviews and indexes of<br/>
educational resources.  Currently, on our main &quot;simple search&quot; page, you<br/>
can select the search method that best reflects the type of information<br/>
that you are seeking. Below is a general guide that describes our primary<br/>
search options. (Please let us know which search options you find most<br/>
useful or most frustrating.)<br/>
<br/>
* Search by Keywords - when you have a number of words that you wish to<br/>
search across various fields (title, descriptors, or summary). Or, use<br/>
Keywords when you want to do a quick search about a particular concept and<br/>
are wondering whether our Resource Center suggests anything about it. Since<br/>
this option scans several fields (title, descriptors, summary, and biases),<br/>
it may often yield more results than you wish. Please see<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.PathsofLearning.net/help.htm#narrow">http://www.PathsofLearning.net/help.htm#narrow</a> for tips on &quot;Narrowing Your<br/>
Search&quot; to help you avoid this dilemma.<br/>
<br/>
* Search for an Author - when you&#39;re looking for resources created by a<br/>
specific person (includes editors for works by multiple authors).<br/>
<br/>
* Search for a Title - when you know specifically the name of the resource<br/>
you are seeking.<br/>
<br/>
* &quot;What do you wish to accomplish?&quot; provides you multiple options that<br/>
summarize the primary purposes, intended or unintended, of the materials<br/>
indexed in this Resource Center.<br/>
<br/>
* &quot;What learning options do you would to learn more about?&quot; lists the types<br/>
of educational alternatives which are the primary focus of this Resource<br/>
Center.<br/>
<br/>
* &quot;Whose viewpoints would you like to learn more about?&quot; lists any<br/>
resources written ABOUT the perspectives of a particular population, such<br/>
as students, teachers, parents, etc. (For materials written FOR a specific<br/>
audience, please see the our Summary Reports at http://<br/>
www.PathsofLearning.net/reports.htm )<br/>
<br/>
For more help on customizing the Resource Center to your search needs,<br/>
please visit our Search  Help page at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.PathsofLearning.net/help.htm,">http://www.PathsofLearning.net/help.htm,</a> or write to us directly with your<br/>
questions at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:help@...">help@...</a>. We promise to respond as soon as we<br/>
can (usually within 48 hours).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*******************<br/>
Priorities for 2000<br/>
*******************<br/>
<br/>
As we continue to expand the content in the Resource Center, the kinds of<br/>
informational materials that you&#39;ll find later this year include:<br/>
<br/>
* Resources that critically examine more learning options, such as<br/>
democratic schools, folk education, home schooling (unschooling model),<br/>
Montessori schools, teacher education, Waldorf (Steiner) schools, higher<br/>
education (progressive), and specific well-known alternatives (such as<br/>
Summerhill, Sudbury, and many others) for which we have been accumulating<br/>
many leads into lesser known but greatly valued materials.<br/>
<br/>
* Resources that cover an array of purposes, such as differences between<br/>
schooling options; outcomes of education (what really gets learned in<br/>
school), including alumni studies; money matters: effective funding<br/>
strategies; improve schools through reform and organizational management;<br/>
program development within or beyond schools; ideas to integrate parenting<br/>
and educating.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
*****************************************<br/>
Conferences in May and June: Sign Up Now<br/>
*****************************************<br/>
<br/>
If you like meeting &quot;alternative&quot; folks in education, the National<br/>
Coalition of Alternative Community Schools is sponsoring an excellent &quot;Hope<br/>
for Our Children&quot; Conference in May, which you are each warmly invited to<br/>
attend. Among other workshop leaders (including Joseph Chilton Pearce and<br/>
Herb Kohl), I will be making some small presentations on using the Internet<br/>
for information and networking in educationÖto help people unfamiliar with<br/>
the Net to begin sorting the chaff from the grain (realizing that it&#39;s<br/>
mostly chaff). The conference is at Antioch College in Yellow Springs,<br/>
Ohio, May 10-14. For more information, please visit:<br/>
<br/>
	<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncacs.org/Conf2000/">http://www.ncacs.org/Conf2000/</a><br/>
<br/>
And if you do attend the conference, be sure to introduce yourself to me!<br/>
(You can recognize me...as I&#39;ll be the one passing out Paths of Learning<br/>
magazines.)<br/>
<br/>
Another upcoming conference that we&#39;d like to recommend is IPEA 2000:<br/>
Institute for People&#39;s Education and Action.  This conference is June 26 -<br/>
June 30, 2000, in Deerfield, MA, and is sponsored by the Folk and People&#39;s<br/>
Education Association of America.  The FPEAA&#39;s 3rd annual Institute for<br/>
People&#39;s Education and Action will bring together students, teachers, and<br/>
community leaders to deepen their knowledge of and extend their practice of<br/>
people&#39;s education: popular, folk, and community-based learning for the<br/>
purpose of building more just and sustainable communities. &quot;People&#39;s<br/>
education&quot; is defined as &quot;inclusive learning among peers, based in culture<br/>
and experience, that builds democratic communities through dialogue and<br/>
action.&quot; For more details on this conference, please see:<br/>

*********************************<br/>
Other Clearinghouses in Education<br/>
*********************************<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if you can&#39;t find the educational materials that you are seeking<br/>
in our Resource Center, we have also compiled a list of other<br/>
clearinghouses that offer everything from curriculum ideas to conventional<br/>
educational research. You will find this list of recommended sites at:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
While we certainly hope to develop our database over the next few years so<br/>
that most of what you need for diverse ideas in holistic, alternative<br/>
options in education can be found at Paths of Learning, we can not be all<br/>
things to all people.<br/>
