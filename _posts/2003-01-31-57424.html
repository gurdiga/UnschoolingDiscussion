<br/>
RESOLUTION ON THE USA PATRIOT ACT AND  RELATED MEASURES THAT INFRINGE ON <br/>
THE RIGHTS OF LIBRARY USERS<br/>
<br/>
WHEREAS, the American Library Association affirms the responsibility of <br/>
the leaders of the United States to protect and preserve the freedoms <br/>
that are the foundation of our democracy; and<br/>
<br/>
WHEREAS, libraries are a critical force for promoting the free flow and <br/>
unimpeded distribution of knowledge and information for individuals, <br/>
institutions, and communities; and<br/>
<br/>
WHEREAS, the American Library Association holds that suppression of <br/>
ideas undermines a democratic society; and<br/>
<br/>
WHEREAS, privacy is essential to the exercise of free speech, free <br/>
thought, and free association; and, in a library, the subject of users&#39; <br/>
interests should not be examined or scrutinized by others; and<br/>
<br/>
WHEREAS, certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act, the revised Attorney <br/>
General Guidelines to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other <br/>
related measures expand the authority of the federal government to <br/>
investigate citizens and non-citizens, to engage in surveillance, and to <br/>
threaten civil rights and liberties guaranteed under the United States <br/>
Constitution and Bill of Rights; and<br/>
<br/>
WHEREAS, the USA PATRIOT Act and other recently enacted laws, <br/>
regulations, and guidelines increase the likelihood that the activities <br/>
of library users, including their use of computers to browse the Web or <br/>
access e-mail, may be under government surveillance without their <br/>
knowledge or consent; now, therefore, be it<br/>
<br/>
RESOLVED, that the American Library Association opposes any use of <br/>
governmental power to suppress the free and open exchange of knowledge <br/>
and information or to intimidate individuals exercising free inquiry; <br/>
and, be it further<br/>
<br/>
RESOLVED, that the American Library Association encourages all <br/>
librarians, library administrators, library governing bodies, and <br/>
library advocates to educate their users, staff, and communities about <br/>
the process for compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act and other related <br/>
measures and about the dangers to individual privacy and the <br/>
confidentiality of library records resulting from those measures; and, <br/>
be it further<br/>
<br/>
RESOLVED, that the American Library Association urges librarians <br/>
everywhere to defend and support user privacy and free and open access <br/>
to knowledge and information; and, be it further<br/>
<br/>
RESOLvED, that the American Library Association will work with other <br/>
organizations, as appropriate, to protect the rights of inquiry and free <br/>
expression; and, be it further<br/>
<br/>
RESOLVED, that the American Library Association will take actions as <br/>
appropriate to obtain and publicize information about the surveillance <br/>
of libraries and library users by law enforcement agencies and to assess <br/>
the impact on library users and their communities; and, be it further<br/>
<br/>
RESOLVED, that the American Library Association urges all libraries to <br/>
adopt and implement patron privacy and record retention policies that <br/>
affirm that the collection of personally identifiable information should <br/>
only be a matter of routine or policy when necessary for the fulfillment <br/>
of the mission of the library.<br/>
<br/>
(ALA Privacy: An Interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights);<br/>
<br/>
and, be it further<br/>
<br/>
RESOLVED, that the American Library Association considers that sections <br/>
of the USA PATRIOT ACT are a present danger to the constitutional rights <br/>
and privacy rights of library users and urges the United States Congress to:<br/>
<br/>
1) provide active oversight of the implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act <br/>
and other related measures, and the revised Attorney General Guidelines <br/>
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation;<br/>
<br/>
2) hold hearings to determine the extent of the surveillance on library <br/>
users and their communities; and<br/>
<br/>
3) amend or change the sections of these laws and the guidelines that <br/>
threaten or abridge the rights of inquiry and free expression; and, be <br/>
it further<br/>
<br/>
RESOLVED, that this resolution be forwarded to the President of the <br/>
United States, to the Attorney General of the United States, to Members <br/>
of both Houses of Congress, to the library community, and to others as <br/>
appropriate.<br/>
