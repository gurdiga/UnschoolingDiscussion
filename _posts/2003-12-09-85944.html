skirt you can imagine. She couldn&#39;t get through the door from the <br/>
lobby into the actual theater and had to spend the whole evening in <br/>
the lobby. &lt;g&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering how she thought she would fit in a seat. <br/>

Why didn&#39;t she just tip it up -- she could at least have stood at the back of <br/>
the theater -- was she too embarrassed or something?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970746676">My mother made a lot of Victorian dresses for Dickens on the Strand in<br/>
Galveston, as well as various theater productions. The hoop petticoats she<br/>
used are not authentic since they are made of lighter, flexible, modern<br/>
nylon boning instead of whalebone or steel. However the method she taught<br/>
the actors and re-enactors for getting through doors, or into the narrow<br/>
wings of the theaters is to lean to the side, pick up the bottom most hoop<br/>
and lift, gathering the hoops together like a roman blind (or those round<br/>
paper lampshades). You then tuck this under your arm so you have diagonally<br/>
(almost vertical) concentric circles across your hips, with the other side<br/>
still at the ankle. Obviously this displays your legs to a certain point<br/>
although there is usually enough fabric in the skirt to drape over the<br/>
underpants area. It was a backstage-move-quickly trick.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779334739">-=-A familiar problem -- THE HOOP<br/>
Sitting in a hoop.<br/>
Lift hoop and skirts slightly (an inch or two) before sitting down. This will <br/>
allow the boning of the hoop to lay on top of the chair without causing that <br/>
unsightly frontal raise we all dread.-=-<br/>
