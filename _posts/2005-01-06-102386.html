<div id="ygrps-yiv-255730241"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; When I heard about the<br/>
&gt; tsunami and all the people who were killed, 10,000 sounded like a lot <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; now 150, 000 sounds like a lot, but I can&#39;t really quantify it so that <br/>
&gt; I can<br/>
&gt; see how many people that is in my head.  I guess if I stopped to think <br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; it hard, maybe.  There are about 6.000 people in the biggest city near <br/>
&gt; me.<br/>
&gt; So that would be more than 20 times the number of people in that city <br/>
&gt; who<br/>
&gt; died.  Wow!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is interesting when compared to other events in which people died.  <br/>
150,000 is a lot, but when you compare it to Nazi Germany...  During <br/>
the holocaust, the low estimate is 12 million people exterminated.  It <br/>
seems nature can&#39;t quite do the damage that we, as people are capable <br/>
of inflicting upon ourselves.  All those big numbers can be hard to <br/>
grasp in your mind.  I think it should be hard to grasp - to be able to <br/>
wrap your mind around that much suffering and distruction.<br/>
<br/>
I really can&#39;t directly tie this to unschooling, just something I <br/>
thought of when I read the above statement.  And my belief that <br/>
everything that makes you think can be tied to unschooling.</div>
