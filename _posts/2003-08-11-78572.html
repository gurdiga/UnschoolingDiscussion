I fear that Brianna&#39;s bio-mom will start a fuss because we unschool. <br/>
I can&#39;t imagine our lives w/ Brianna in school. That would simply suck!!<br/>
Brianna&#39;s been writing her story - it&#39;s so imaginative! She sure has her own way of spelling - so what! The thoughts, the story is so cool! She wouldn&#39;t be writing this if she were in  govt. sanctioned school. She wouldn&#39;t be the girl she is if she were in school.<br/>
<br/>
We spend 99% of our time together. I love it!<br/>
Yes, there are times when the house is &quot;disgraceful&quot;<br/>
Yes, there are times when I wish for &quot;alone&quot; time.<br/>
But then I think.....&quot;When she&#39;s grown, I&#39;ll be alone then.&quot;<br/>
So I thank the powers that be that I have this wonderful, exasperating, comical, creative bundle of love and joy.<br/>
She&#39;s my favorite person in the world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-24510597">I guess people can&#39;t get there unless they have Netscape (and even then, it&#39;s <br/>
a weird &quot;go) so here, I&#39;ve swiped the article.  It&#39;s not very long:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  A Mom or Dad&#39;s No. 1 Complaint  <br/>
<br/>
The No. 1 complaint of parents? They don&#39;t have enough time--good, quality <br/>
time--to spend with their children. <br/>
<br/>
The demands of long work hours, housework, and other responsibilities have <br/>
encroached on the time they have to spend with their kids, The Associated Press <br/>
reports of a new study of 1,000 parents and caregivers with children under 18 <br/>
who are living at home. The study, which was released by the Boys & Girls <br/>
Clubs of America and the Pennsylvania-based nonprofit group KidsPeace, was <br/>
overseen by Harvard University psychiatrist Dr. Alvin Poussaint.<br/>
What&#39;s more, fully 94 percent of those surveyed are aware that there is a <br/>
relationship between the amount of meaningful time parents spend with their kids <br/>
and the way those kids deal with major issues, such as substance abuse and <br/>
discipline. Knowing this doesn&#39;t make it any easier to carve out a few extra <br/>
hours in the day to spend on the swings in the park or reading books together at <br/>
bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the findings, which may resonate with your household:<br/>
<br/>
*   54 percent said they had little or no time to spend in physical <br/>
activities with their children, such as taking a walk or playing catch in the backyard. <br/>
<br/>
*   Parents in about 3.5 million U.S. households spend an hour or less a week <br/>
in some type of physical activity with their children.<br/>
<br/>
*   50 percent of all parents either don&#39;t have enough time or wished they <br/>
had more time to read to their kids or help with their homework or other <br/>
educational activities.<br/>
<br/>
*   Although some 56 percent of parents acknowledged that their kids are <br/>
worried about war and terrorism, fully 33 percent admitted they had not yet talked <br/>
to their little ones about these big issues.<br/>
<br/>
*   50 percent of parents and caregivers confessed they haven&#39;t talked to <br/>
their children in the past year about sexual pressures or sexual activity.<br/>
<br/>
The primary obstacle to all this: busy work schedules.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s a parent to do? First, be aware of the situation. Second, recognize <br/>
your child&#39;s need for your presence in his or her life. Third, figure out a way <br/>
to make it happen.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They can listen to their children. They can talk, not to their children, <br/>
they can talk with their children,&quot; C.T. O&#39;Donnell, the president and CEO of <br/>
KidsPeace told AP. &quot;They can take walks in park. They can spend meaningful, <br/>
interactive reading time with their kids.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; What Is Unschooling?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is also known as interest driven, child-led, natural, organic, eclectic,<br/>
&gt; or self-directed learning. Lately, the term ³unschooling² has come to be<br/>
&gt; associated with the type of homeschooling that doesn¹t use a fixed curriculum.<br/>
&gt; When pressed, I define unschooling as allowing children as much freedom to<br/>
&gt; learn in the world, as their parents can comfortably bear. The advantage of<br/>
&gt; this method is that it doesn¹t require you, the parent, to become someone<br/>
&gt; else, i.e. a professional teacher pouring knowledge into child-vessels on a<br/>
&gt; planned basis. Instead you live and learn together, pursuing questions and<br/>
&gt; interests as they arise and using conventional schooling on an ³on demand²<br/>
&gt; basis, if at all. This is the way we learn before going to school and the way<br/>
&gt; we learn when we leave school and enter the world of work. So, for instance, a<br/>
&gt; young child¹s interest in hot rods can lead him to a study of how the engine<br/>
&gt; works (science), how and when the car was built (history and business), who<br/>
&gt; built and designed the car (biography), etc. Certainly these interests can<br/>
&gt; lead to reading texts, taking courses, or doing projects, but the important<br/>
&gt; difference is that these activities were chosen and engaged in freely by the<br/>
&gt; learner. They were not dictated to the learner through curricular mandate to<br/>
&gt; be done at a specific time and place, though parents with a more hands-on<br/>
&gt; approach to unschooling certainly can influence and guide their children¹s<br/>
&gt; choices. Unschooling, for lack of a better term (until people start to accept<br/>
&gt; ³living² as part and parcel of learning), is the natural way to learn.<br/>
&gt; However, this does not mean unschoolers do not take traditional classes or use<br/>
&gt; curricular materials when the student, or parents and children together,<br/>
&gt; decide that this is how they want to do it. Learning to read or do quadratic<br/>
&gt; equations are not ³natural² processes, but unschoolers nonetheless learn them<br/>
&gt; when it makes sense to them to do so, not because they have reached a certain<br/>
&gt; age or are compelled to do so by arbitrary authority. Therefore it isn¹t<br/>
&gt; unusual to find unschoolers who are barely eight years old studying astronomy<br/>
&gt; or who are ten years old and just learning to read.<br/>

<br/>
Learning to read was as natural as learning to walk, talk, or eat for <br/>
my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Learning to &quot;do quadratic equations&quot; would be natural too, if someone <br/>
was hanging out with mathematical people who do them all the time. Just <br/>
like learning to shear a sheep would be natural if mom and dad were <br/>
sheep shearers.<br/>
<br/>
We have to make an effort to learn some things that we don&#39;t get <br/>
exposed to &quot;naturally&quot; in our daily lives, sure. But would you put <br/>
READING in that category? Seems odd to me.<br/>

approach to their children?  Never thought it meant I should influence and<br/>
guide their choices, though.  I try to support their choices.  I guess I&#39;m<br/>
doing it wrong.<br/>

a difficult as learning to walk would be for a child with disabled legs.. or <br/>
as difficult as a child with a cleft palette learning to talk.    There are <br/>

allowed to learn on their own timetable and in their own way, are you <br/>
saying we should make generalizations about everybody else based on <br/>

Special needs are &quot;special&quot; because they aren&#39;t &quot;general.&quot;<br/>

What was said, again, was:<br/>
&quot; Learning to read or do quadratic equations are not &quot;natural&quot; <br/>

Are you going to argue, as an unschooler, that learning to read is not <br/>
a natural process, in general?<br/>

The entire BASIS of unschooling is that learning is as natural to <br/>
humans as swimming is to a fish or flying is to a bird.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I am not trying to argue anything.  I simply stated a fact that reading <br/>
does not happend &quot;naturally&quot; with all children, unschooled or not.   is it  <br/>
natural &quot;in general&quot;   I don&#39;t really know, I would have to do some kind of <br/>
scientific study.. lol.   For my own experience, reading was natural in 2 out 3 of <br/>
myself and my sibs.. Reading came naturally for 3 out of 4 of my children.    <br/>
I have seen many unschoolers on this list ask for &quot;tips&quot;, suggestions, <br/>
support, with children who WANT to read, but are struggling.    Obviously, it does <br/>
not happen &quot;naturally&quot; with all unschooled kids.<br/>
<br/>
Why is stating a fact, whether it it in regards to a little or a lot of <br/>
people, considered arguing?     It&#39;s just a fact.<br/>

as difficult as a child with a cleft palette learning to talk.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that.  There are not many alternate ways to talk or walk, but <br/>
the brain is VAST and not everyone reads the same way.  There are LOTS of <br/>
ways to interpret information, and children can figure out the one that works for <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Before vocational therapy was ever thought of EVER, people who were missing <br/>
limbs learned to feed themselves and hold paintbrushes and pencils.  That&#39;s <br/>
because there are other ways to hold a spoon or a paintbrush, and you don&#39;t HAVE <br/>
to have a fully functioning hand to paint.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; There are <br/>
disablitlies in some folks brains that make reading as hard to master as <br/>
physical <br/>
disablites make walking and talking challenging.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are experts in helping them keep up with other kids in school.  They <br/>
fail, these experts, because those kids rarely ever catch up before they&#39;re <br/>
grown. Yet because they have college degrees and paychecks, they are &quot;experts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are no &quot;experts&quot; in learning to read naturally.   John Holt hadn&#39;t seen <br/>
people learn to read without ever going to shool at all, except those few who <br/>
learned early and just hadn&#39;t been YET.    So no expert can say &quot;Yes, just as <br/>
we thought&quot; about the FACT that my children read well, yet they didn&#39;t read <br/>
&quot;on time,&quot; and they don&#39;t read by the same mental methods.   <br/>
<br/>
If it makes someone feel better to say that some kids won&#39;t learn to read <br/>
naturally, WHY does that make that person feel better?<br/>

Unschooling and eclectic homeschooling are the same thing? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Eclectic is an English word pre-dating it&#39;s particular use by the schism off <br/>
unschoolers and unit studies grups.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Eclectic&quot; describes my books and my closet and my collection of friends.  <br/>
If that was a John Holt quote, he can&#39;t possibly be held to having been <br/>
careful to avoid using a word some homeschoolers are using as a new mantle.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe income matters.  I&#39;m willing to make parents think hard for the sake of <br/>
their kids, but I&#39;m usually a total volunteer.  He&#39;s charging by the hour for <br/>
phone conversations.  I&#39;m spending two or three hours a day helping strangers <br/>
I&#39;ll never see.  He wants to collect his check at the end.  I just want to <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve seen it.  It&#39;s really ugly. <br/>
<br/>
A family we know took a verbally precocious (socially retarded, to this day) <br/>
nine year old out of school, and showed her were all their college textbooks <br/>
and reference books were.  They said &quot;read those and if you have any questions, <br/>
ask us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Darned if she didn&#39;t decide to go back to school.<br/>
<br/>
I expect that was their intent.  (That and/or they didn&#39;t have enough <br/>
interpersonal intelligence to interact with her OR to pass on good genetics in that <br/>
department.)<br/>

The only way you will believe what you experience yourself directly is to <br/>
rely on &#39;scientific study&#39;?<br/>

That&#39;s not how unschooling is unfolding.  It can&#39;t be studied scientifically <br/>

support, with children who WANT to read, but are struggling.    Obviously, it <br/>
does <br/>
not happen &quot;naturally&quot; with all unschooled kids&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What you call &quot;obvious&quot; is not obvious in an objective way.<br/>
When people are worried, and when kids are struggling, it has invariably had <br/>
to do with their age and with outside pressures and inquiries.  I know of not <br/>
ONE single story, ever, of a later reader who wasn&#39;t at all worried and whose <br/>
parents weren&#39;t worried who grew to manhood without being able to read.<br/>
<br/>
I know of many stories of people who had some rough times because they <br/>
panicked BECAUSE of school/age/comparison, and would have learned to read more <br/>
easily and possibly sooner without that crap.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why is stating a fact, whether it it in regards to a little or a lot of <br/>
people, considered arguing?     It&#39;s just a fact.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When it&#39;s not a fact.  When you put a little fact-costume on an opinion, <br/>
that&#39;s just arguing.<br/>

natural?<br/>
<br/>
Most kids learn to ride bikes. (Well, they pretty much have to! There really<br/>
isn&#39;t a way to teach it. 99% of it is getting muscles used to the balance<br/>
and coordination.) But don&#39;t some of them want to before they are physically<br/>
able? And aren&#39;t they frustrated?<br/>
<br/>
There are kids who can&#39;t speak as soon or as well as they&#39;d like to. Some<br/>
may have a slower development in the part of the brain needed for speech.<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean speech isn&#39;t natural? Or not natural for them?<br/>

it, that IS the beginning of arguing.<br/>
<br/>
So - instead of assuming you meant to argue, I ASKED you if you <br/>
intended to argue that it is not true that &quot;learning to read is a <br/>
natural process.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is learning to walk a natural process? Is learning to talk a natural <br/>
process? Does the fact that there are children who have specific <br/>
disabilities that make learning to walk or talk difficult or impossible <br/>
mean we should not say, &quot;Learning to walk and talk is a natural <br/>
process?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking an &quot;unnatural&quot; process would be one where the child never <br/>
would never develop an interest and/or never find a way to learn it on <br/>
his/her own timetable and in his/her own way if someone didn&#39;t impose <br/>
it on him/her. An unnatural process would be one that doesn&#39;t take <br/>
place &quot;naturally&quot; in the course of life, but is inserted unnaturally <br/>
into the child&#39;s life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-12196730">**... to say that some kids won&#39;t learn to read naturally, ...**<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Natural&quot; and &quot;naturally&quot; are fairly broad, vague words that we may not <br/>
all be interpreting in the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Some folks may be using &quot;learn to read naturally&quot; as meaning &quot;learn to <br/>
read unassisted&quot;.  But, to me, it is natural for children to have <br/>
assistance.  After all it is natural for human children to be nurtured <br/>
by parents, to closely watch their parents and to learn using their <br/>
parents behavior as examples.  I would personally also include &quot;help&quot; <br/>
and &quot;explanations&quot; and &quot;demonstrations&quot; as part of natural learning.  I <br/>
think it&#39;s natural for kids to learn from parents, siblings and caring <br/>
members of the community.<br/>

How are you defining naturally? Do you mean effortlessly? Or do you mean<br/>

Nothing happens BAM were learning is concerned.  There is interest, <br/>
observation, exposure, trial and error, question and answer.  None of that needs <br/>
lessons, a curriculum, or a phonics method.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing unnatural about a person figuring something out in those <br/>
ways.  It&#39;s the way people learn about unschooling all the time.   Interest, <br/>
observation, exposure, trial and error, question and answer.   There&#39;s enough <br/>
reading online already to last someone weeks, without what&#39;s being added daily.   <br/>
<br/>
Yet some are determined to look for evidence that unschooling doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
This is a funny place to look for it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe some people are fishing for that, I really couldn&#39;t say for <br/>
sure. But I do think that it&#39;s unfair to assume that everyone who <br/>
questions whether reading is a truly natural process must somehow <br/>
not &quot;get&quot; unschooling. I think of myself as a fullblown, whole-<br/>
hearted, John Holt-worshipping radical unschooler (and the only <br/>
person who is going to tell me otherwise has been dead for 18 years)--<br/>
but for the reasons that I&#39;ve stated in my posts, I do personally <br/>
think that reading needs to be &quot;taught,&quot; in a way. <br/>
<br/>
Now hold on, before people start flaming me or taking my words out of <br/>
context, let me clarify that remark by saying that most people seem <br/>
perfectly capable of teaching this to themselves!! BUT, there do seem <br/>
to be some people who need a little extra help figuring it all out. <br/>
Where I believe the unschooling philosophy comes into play here is <br/>
whether the child is given the freedom to seek this help out on his <br/>
own, or whether the parents get pushy and try to force instruction on <br/>
the child. <br/>
<br/>
If my child still wasn&#39;t reading when he was 13 or 14, I might be a <br/>
bit concerned, and as a loving parent I might sit down with him and <br/>
ask him if he&#39;s having any specific difficulties, and ask him if he <br/>
would like any help. If he told me that he was fine and didn&#39;t want <br/>
any help, then I would probably leave it at that. What I wouldn&#39;t do <br/>
is start buying him phonics workbooks or sign him up for a reading <br/>
tutor or anything like that, unless of course he asked me to. I would <br/>
leave it up to HIM to decide if his inability to read was a concern <br/>
to him, and what if anything he would like others to do to help him <br/>
out. Maybe not everyone on this list agrees with that approach, but <br/>
who says that we all have to agree on every single thing? <br/>
<br/>
Every philosophy, every movement, has room for differing opinions, <br/>
different interpretations, different methods of implementation. Does <br/>
everyone in the Green Party agree on every single point? Does every <br/>
Muslim pray the exact same way? Obviously there are a few basic <br/>
tenets which are at the core of a philosophy and are pretty much <br/>
undebatable, but there are plenty of other specifics which should be <br/>
open to evolving debate. <br/>
<br/>
If we want to label ourselves unschoolers we should probably all <br/>
agree that learning in general is a natural process--that&#39;s a core <br/>
part of the unschooling philosophy.  But, that doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean that we can&#39;t still debate (and disagree about) specifics, such <br/>
as whether all human brains are equitably wired to easily decode <br/>
written symbols for spoken language, and whether all brains are <br/>
naturally inclined to &quot;read&quot; symbols for music and math as well for <br/>
that matter. Those are legitimate questions to explore, and those who <br/>
choose to ponder such things shouldn&#39;t be written off as being un-<br/>
unschooling. <br/>
<br/>

take that post at face value, and if it gets messy later, then I&#39;ll take the <br/>
egg on my face.  <br/>
<br/>
If a kid wants to learn how to read, is struggling, and wants and asks for <br/>
help, and you help, that is still unschooling.  That&#39;s still child led learning. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t withhold assistance when he asks me for it.  Sometimes the help you <br/>
give is just explaining that maybe they really don&#39;t need help, but hey, <br/>
sometimes they do.  Help to look at something in a different way, or to remind them <br/>
that they can give something a break for a while and come back to it later.  I <br/>
call it turning the key.  My hubby sometimes says something that just turns <br/>
the key and unlocks something for me, and I love it when that happens, cause I <br/>
was really stuck in a brain rut.  Alex doesn&#39;t need the turn as often as I do, <br/>
tho.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just respectful parenting at work there.  No throwing the kid in the <br/>
deep end to make them learn how to swim required, right?  And, no keeping them <br/>
away from water, either.  Am I missing something?  <br/>

&gt; would like any help. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seemed to me that in this scenario, (and I don&#39;t have the whole<br/>
original post), but it seemed to me that you would be presenting this<br/>
because you have a concern that this child wasn&#39;t meeting your<br/>
expectation for his or her learning.  (Honestly,  as I type this, I see<br/>
you went into the world of hypotheticals,  so maybe it&#39;s not worth any<br/>
more discussion.)<br/>
DO you know of any unschooled 14 year olds who cannot read?  I know<br/>
Tia&#39;s Lars had a hard time,  but Tia will say it was her teaching<br/>
intervention that slowed down the process,  and (I think) that Lars<br/>
reads as well as he wants and needs to for his life these days.<br/>
<br/>
And the whole thing reminded me of earlier in my journey...when I<br/>
thought I &quot;got&quot; it,  but I managed to add a load of stress to Katy, my<br/>
oldest, because I failed to believe she would read when she wanted to.<br/>
Because I was and continue to be a concerned parent,  but I&#39;m not<br/>
concerned that my kids will not learn to read.  I do truly believe that<br/>
they will and are learning what they need.  <br/>
<br/>
I am thrilled that Katy and I have restored our trust. I am not<br/>
concerned about her reading or not reading,  I know she can and will.<br/>
She now will come to me to ask a word from what she is reading.  She<br/>
will now yell out the letters across the house when she doesn&#39;t know the<br/>
word.  I have weeded out every one of my own issues that I have become<br/>
aware of to this point...and I have let them go.  <br/>
<br/>
I tried to &quot;sit and talk with her.&quot;  It added to her pressure and she<br/>
reacted to my unconscious dissatisfaction with her abilities.  It was a<br/>
roadblock.<br/>
<br/>
If a child has opportunities with written language and doesn&#39;t read by<br/>
14,  it is probably due to roadblocks put in the child&#39;s path....perhaps<br/>
even the unnecessary &quot;concern&quot; of a parent. <br/>
<br/>
Since youe scenario was hypothetical,  I say forget the age number...if<br/>
you truly trust your child&#39;s learning, you aren&#39;t likely to need to<br/>
initiate that conversation.<br/>

&lt;&lt; If a child has opportunities with written language and doesn&#39;t read by<br/>
14,  it is probably due to roadblocks put in the child&#39;s path....perhaps<br/>
even the unnecessary &quot;concern&quot; of a parent.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Liam McClure was a bit older, and his roadblock was a life of comparison to <br/>
his twin sister who learned EVERYTHING early, easy, fast, soon.   He seemed <br/>
often to just not want to do whatever it was Renee was doing.    Had he been a <br/>
single birth, I think there would be lots of differences in his life.  He was <br/>
the younger twin, not by ten minutes, but by weeks (later <br/>
germination/implantation/start), and he was the runt of the two for quite a while.   He never went <br/>
to school, and his mom wasn&#39;t pressing him, but he had other reasons to look <br/>
the other way, sometimes.<br/>

&gt; Here is a quote from you:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;If my child still wasn&#39;t reading when he was 13 or 14, I might <br/>
&gt; be a <br/>
&gt; &gt; bit concerned, and as a loving parent I might sit down with him <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; It seemed to me that in this scenario, (and I don&#39;t have the whole<br/>
&gt; original post), but it seemed to me that you would be presenting  <br/>
&gt; this because you have a concern that this child wasn&#39;t meeting your<br/>
&gt; expectation for his or her learning.  (Honestly, as I type this, I <br/>
&gt; see you went into the world of hypotheticals, so maybe it&#39;s not <br/>
&gt; worth any more discussion.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL, no, this isn&#39;t a personal problem at all. As I mentioned before, <br/>
my son taught himself to read before he was 2, and my almost-2-year-<br/>
old daughter is starting to as well. <br/>
<br/>
I think I qualified this hypothetical with a later post, giving the <br/>
specific example of perhaps noticing that the child appeared to be <br/>
having vision problems. Regardless, my main point was that I don&#39;t <br/>
see anything wrong with a parent being concerned about their child&#39;s <br/>
well-being, and if a child is still not reading at a relatively late <br/>
age, AND  he&#39;s been obviously trying very hard but still having <br/>
great difficulty with it, it COULD (could! as in, probably not, but <br/>
maybe) be a sign of a physical or neurological problem that a parent <br/>
needs to have addressed. Again, obviously that scenario is rather <br/>
rare, but we can&#39;t dismiss it completely.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I am extra sensitive to this possibility because I myself <br/>
have a visual handicap (I&#39;m blind in my right eye thanks to being <br/>
born with a congential cataract), so to me the possibility of a child <br/>
having some sort of handicap is not merely theoretical, it&#39;s quite <br/>
possible and maybe more so for my children since these things can <br/>
often be hereditary. Now in my case, it obviously didn&#39;t affect my <br/>
ability to read, because I too was reading before age 2! It DOES <br/>
greatly affect my spatial reasoning skills however, because I have no <br/>
depth perception and my field of perception is skewed to one side. <br/>
<br/>
