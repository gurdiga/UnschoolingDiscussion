&lt;&lt; It has taken a lot to change those reflexive behaviors, and a lot to admit <br/>
 some of it on an email list. But if it can help break the cycle for someone <br/>
 else or show how much a simple homeschooling method can change lives, I have <br/>
 nothing to hide.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

I think your story was very inspirational. You&#39;re brave to share and I <br/>
commend you for the difficult changes you&#39;re trying to make. And for your dh <br/>
for understanding and trying to change too!!<br/>
I know how terribly hard it is to undo. I&#39;ve regretted every time I&#39;ve lost <br/>
my temper and I STILL fight the urge to swat a child into submission.<br/>
Sometimes the head knows things that haven&#39;t sunk deep into the heart yet.<br/>
Anger from childhood still haunts me and rears it&#39;s ugly head at the damndest <br/>
times.<br/>
Hang in there, you&#39;re doing great.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
