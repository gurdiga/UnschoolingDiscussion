<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468732480">Example:  Child wants music lessons.  Parent pays.  Child may or may not<br/>
want to go consistently.  Does parent let them skip or force<br/>
&quot;responsibility&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Here is my thinking on this.  If a child is old enough to research getting<br/>
lessons (knows when and where, what type of instrument he/she is interested<br/>
in), the child can probably handle a &quot;budget&quot;.  Why not sit down as a family<br/>
discuss how much money is available for things like lessons, classes, toys,<br/>
gizmos, etc.?  Let the child know how much money they have available to<br/>
them, their &quot;budget&quot; if you will, and let them decide how to spend it.<br/>
<br/>
That takes the burden of &quot;money wasted&quot; off the parent if the child isn&#39;t<br/>
really interested in the class or whatever.  The child will choose to spend<br/>
money on things they enjoy, just like adults do.<br/>
