<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046332448">-- I really feel offened by certian points here... I do keep my house <br/>
clean and my laundry done! I currently rent and my landloard would <br/>
not approve if it were dirty!  I even kept the home we owe clean when <br/>
we lived in it as i was proud to have it and liked it clean!I also <br/>
plan things as I have too or We would not be able to do things..I <br/>
work a full time job! and a part time job!I am our sole support.Yes, <br/>
I pretty much plan everything  so this way we are able to get the <br/>
most of a time period or our hard earned dollar!<br/>
My son does chores, just like his older sister and brother had done <br/>
before him! They turned out just fine!And with a knowledge of how to <br/>
do things in the house!!!<br/>
I do put myself last as my family is the most important things before <br/>
me...There needs and wants are more than mine..My son will be 18 soon <br/>
enough and he will be on his own and not need me then so i will do <br/>
for him now. My hubby is disabled and his needs are more than my <br/>
needs..life has been not a bowl of cherries but we will get through. <br/>
Maybe you have it very, very easy ..but others may not. We may have <br/>
to follow a schedule  and do our own house and laundry..I work full <br/>
time and have to do these things at times so that my uniforms are <br/>
clean to wear to work and my work clothes are clean to wear to the <br/>
other job I have. I have no choices as well I&#39;ll do it tommorrow <br/>
casue tommorw is usally full with other other details to do..DRs. <br/>
appointments, homeschool trips, a hike, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I am not boring , nor do I have a  boring life! I do many things and <br/>
learn many new things along the way!  You may be very surprised At <br/>
what you can find interesting and fun things at!  ANYWHERE AT ANY <br/>
TIME! life is a struggle at times but I make the most of it, and I <br/>
think before you state things, you need to think of otherw who may <br/>
have to live differently than you. I did not choose to live like <br/>
this..I did not choose to have my hubby injured and then have many <br/>
health problems, not did I choose to have cancer as I do. If I don&#39;t <br/>
work my full time job.. I lose my healthe benefits and then i don&#39;t <br/>
get my treatments or my hubbys meds, testing paid for, etc.<br/>

If someone does everything on that list, unschooling will stop  <br/>
working for them (or never start working, more likely).<br/>
<br/>
Probably everyone here has done lots of those things, and probably  <br/>
still does a few.<br/>
<br/>
No one is trying to offend you.  If this list begins to focus on  <br/>
being absolutely free of potential hurt feelings instead of focusing  <br/>
on  helping people see what helps unschooling work, we might as well  <br/>
close it up and do something else.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s your choice.<br/>
<br/>
But no one can choose to clean (or not clean) if they don&#39;t feel they  <br/>
have the choice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I work a full time job! and a part time job!I<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s great you can also provide unschooling for you kids. :-)<br/>
<br/>
It also sounds like you&#39;ve got resentment and frustration building  <br/>
up. Releasing it at people who aren&#39;t the cause of your situation,  <br/>
who have no power over your situation doesn&#39;t help anyone. All it  <br/>
does is potentially darken some mornings that would have been happy.  <br/>
And potentially (unconsciously) cause them to spend less time  <br/>
answering a question from you that might actually help relieve some  <br/>
of your stress.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My son does chores, just like his older sister and brother had done  <br/>
&gt; before him! They turned out just fine!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This list doesn&#39;t exist to support mainstream approaches when there  <br/>
are ways that build relationships *and* get the tasks done.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel you need to have kids do chores, then embrace that fully  <br/>
as your choice. (The kids might not though! All choices have  <br/>
consequences.)<br/>
<br/>
The list is for putting relationships first and finding ways to fit  <br/>
everything else in around that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And with a knowledge of how to do things in the house!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So does my daughter. Without the chores. And if I ask her to do  <br/>
something she more often than not says &quot;Sure!&quot; or &quot;I&#39;d love to!&quot; How  <br/>
many moms of 16 yos more often than not get a groan and an eye roll?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do put myself last as my family is the most important things  <br/>
&gt; before me...There needs and wants are more than mine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe you can&#39;t see another way. Feeling we don&#39;t have a choice makes  <br/>
us feel secure in what we&#39;re doing. It&#39;s less work if we don&#39;t have a  <br/>
choice. But it&#39;s an illusion. Those who see something better and feel  <br/>
the effort needed to get there is worth it, do find other ways.<br/>
<br/>
As a general rule putting everyone else ahead of self isn&#39;t healthy.  <br/>
Nor should we be more important. Everyone should count, including  <br/>
mom. When we take our own needs into consideration, we model caring  <br/>
for ourselves for our children. We free them from the guilt of  <br/>
&quot;having to&quot; do for others. We allow them to joyfully choose to help  <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
(The problem is that often our &quot;needs&quot; are really old scripts that we  <br/>
don&#39;t realize have no meaning. That&#39;s why everything needs examined.  <br/>
Though, when kids are little, we do need to set aside a lot (not all)  <br/>
of our needs for a while. It&#39;s a stage.)<br/>
<br/>
While those who put their all into something, sacrificing themselves  <br/>
in the process, often accomplish a lot, quite often they don&#39;t get  <br/>
the respect for their sacrifices they may end up feeling they  <br/>
deserve. It creates resentment and anger. It creates moms who rail on  <br/>
the phone &quot;Why don&#39;t you call? You never call me! All the sacrifices  <br/>
I made for you all those years and you can&#39;t pick up the phone?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When people choose to sacrifice themselves, they should acknowledge  <br/>
that it&#39;s a gift they&#39;re joyfully giving with no strings attached.  <br/>
*No one* has asked anyone to make sacrifices. *No one* will  <br/>
appreciate the sacrifices for things they didn&#39;t ask someone to make  <br/>
sacrifices for. (Especially if they&#39;re handed a &quot;bill&quot; at the end  <br/>
with a &quot;You owe me!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sympathetic to your situation but the list is for people to work  <br/>
on relationships, not create martyrs. If you don&#39;t feel some advice  <br/>
is useful for you, let it go. It&#39;s meant for others.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe you have it very, very easy ..but others may not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, many lives are easier than others. It makes life even more  <br/>
difficult if we look at how full others buckets are rather than  <br/>
looking at how full our own is, though.<br/>
<br/>
If my bucket and Sandra&#39;s bucket and Pam&#39;s and Ren&#39;s and Kelly&#39;s and  <br/>
Deb&#39;s (and the list goes on) buckets were not as full as they are,  <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t have the time to spend on lists helping others. Would  <br/>
that be good? Would there be some satisfaction if everyone suffered  <br/>
equally with no time to help others?<br/>
<br/>
And there *are* single working mothers who unschool who do find ways  <br/>
to make advice here work. (Obviously, and unfortunately, they tend to  <br/>
have less time to write and help others figure out how to do it!)  <br/>
It&#39;s *really* helpful not to picture everyone on the list having an  <br/>
intact family with working husband.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have no choices as well I&#39;ll do it tommorrow casue tommorw is  <br/>
&gt; usally full with other other details to do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You *choose* to wash your uniforms because you like that option  <br/>
better than the option of wearing a dirty uniform. No one has every  <br/>
option available. Not all options are equally good. But everyone has  <br/>
choices they make all the time. It&#39;s only when we dismiss the options  <br/>
we don&#39;t like as though they didn&#39;t exist that we feel trapped by  <br/>
&quot;have tos&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think before you state things, you need to think of otherw who  <br/>
&gt; may have to live differently than you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s supremely frustrating to feel your situation prevents  <br/>
you from using a lot of the advice offered. But taking your  <br/>
frustration out on people who are helping others doesn&#39;t help you or  <br/>
them. Better to take it to the cause or a support group for those in  <br/>
similar situations where it might actually do some good. Can you find  <br/>
some support groups through your hospital?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I did not choose to live like this..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I&#39;m really sorry life has thrown you a crap load of curve balls.  <br/>
But you&#39;re punching people who might come up with great ideas for  <br/>
some situation you have but punched people often don&#39;t like helping  <br/>
their punchers. *Especially* when they&#39;ve been punched because  <br/>
they&#39;re just a convenient target.<br/>

<br/>
That behavior can come from moms who set their kids aside and thought  <br/>
of themselves first all those years, too.<br/>
<br/>
I spent much of the past two days with Holly, at Holly&#39;s request most  <br/>
of the times.  We went to a movie.  We went shopping a different  <br/>
time.  We worked on the art for Learn Nothing Day together.  I helped  <br/>
her with some things in her room, which she&#39;s cleaning out and  <br/>
rearranging.<br/>
<br/>
Her boyfriend (a nice guy I like) spent much of that time with his  <br/>
relatives, but against his will, and when he did answer the summons  <br/>
he got &quot;Why don&#39;t you call?  You&#39;re a failure.  Aren&#39;t you ashamed?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They wonder why he&#39;d rather be at our house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356351600">Actually this list helps me to not foster resentment and frustration that can sneak up on me because of my situation.  <br/>
<br/>
It helps me to keep on the happy side so to speak - to keep me focused on why I &quot;have to&quot; er I mean choose to get up and go to work. I choose to because I don&#39;t fancy living on the streets nor would I want that for my family.  My working hard enables us to play and do things we would not be able to do otherwise.  My cup is  full not empty.  It is a combination of air and water and it is my/our particular combination - every one has their own combination.  When I saw how I chose to go to work it really did help my attitude.  I was also grateful that I had a job - or that we both were not sick, etc. etc.  Reading about others in much worse conditions than I and how they triumph is a great inspiration for me - I just come across these stories now and then in the news paper, books, the internet, the news.<br/>
<br/>
When I get to a place of the pity party for myself I give myself a shake and chose to focus on the joy.  No one ever promised me a rose garden - but I choose to bloom where I am planted. <br/>
<br/>
I once heard an analogy and it is a great analogy for this list, for us anyway (hubby and I):  An airplane pilot knows where he wants to end up and heads in the right direction.   Because he is always a bit off course, he uses his knowledge and constantly checks his instruments.  He makes minute corrections in his &quot;flying&quot; to stay the course and end up where he wants to.  If he did not make those minute corrections he would end up where he did not want to be.  I probably botched that in written form but I hope it conveys the message I wanted it too.<br/>
<br/>
This list helps me stay the course, constantly learning new ways of looking at things, trying them on for fit and keeping what is a good fit and setting aside for further contemplation that which rubs a sore spot.  This list is for learning; for stretching out of our comfort zone.<br/>

<br/>
I didnt mean to say that all of those things, in and of themselves,  <br/>
are incompatible with unschooling. My house is clean (sometimes. ha!)  <br/>
and I do laundry and make plans and put other people first. But not  <br/>
all the time, not rigidly, and not when it would be better to do it  <br/>
differently.<br/>
<br/>
Other family members help out around the house. But we let the place  <br/>
get messy if we are involved in a project (yesterday we made a fort  <br/>
in the living room with sheets) and we veer off plans if better  <br/>
options present themselves.<br/>
<br/>
But a large part of it, is the intent behind it, the motivation. This  <br/>
group of ideas, I meant to show that moms have to take care of  <br/>
themselves too, or they burn out or get frustrated. That its  <br/>
important to be a role model-*being* a person who is engaged in life  <br/>
and can find ways to get their needs met and enjoy things. That its  <br/>
important to not make your kids feel like indentured servants working  <br/>
off a debt they incurred just by being born into your household.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m willing to consider amending that list anytime.<br/>
<br/>
I understood the intent of it.  If someone did all the things on that  <br/>
list they&#39;d be nowhere near unschooling.  Each one they could drop in  <br/>
favor of really looking at their child or teen or children as an  <br/>
intelligent, emotionally whole human would bring them nearer to good  <br/>
relationships.<br/>
<br/>
And if they did the opposite of ALL those things, at least most of  <br/>
the time, would it BE unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we&#39;ve left out some crucial bits, but we can keep tweaking it.   <br/>
I think it&#39;s a useful tool.   Telling people &quot;what to do&quot; makes some  <br/>
of them totally bristle up, even when they&#39;ve made some effort to  <br/>
come to a place like this and lay out their whole life and say &quot;What  <br/>
should I do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And clearly doing a shadow-show of it, showing the outline in  <br/>
opposite terms, caused some bristlyness too.  (The spell checker  <br/>
doesn&#39;t like &quot;bristliness&quot; or &quot;bristlyness&quot; or &quot;bristleyness.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
There are people all around us who will roll at the least  <br/>
criticism.   They&#39;ll whimper at a minorly questioning facial  <br/>
expression. There are even homeschooling writers who get themselves  <br/>
in positions of softening their statement of beliefs to keep  <br/>
advertisers or sponsors or list members or readers.<br/>
<br/>
Compromising one&#39;s beliefs to appease strangers is too thin a soup  <br/>
for me, personally.  Of course when strong ideas are laid out in  <br/>
words or pictures, some people get scared or wish we would take it  <br/>
back, &quot;be inclusive,&quot; or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily for us all there are lots of magazines, and lots of webpages,  <br/>
and lots of discussion lists.  Nobody has to be (nor could be, nor  <br/>
should be) anyone else&#39;s sole source of information.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not setting out to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings, nor to soothe anyone&#39;s  <br/>
feelings.  I like to be in communication with others who are willing  <br/>
to look at the what and why and how of natural learning, with  <br/>
examples from their real lives.  When I write or speak, I&#39;m thinking  <br/>
about what might be helpful to those in the audience who want to move  <br/>
more toward unschooling.  I&#39;m not thinking about the comfort and joy  <br/>
of those who think unschooling is no good, nor am I ever interested  <br/>
in prolonging or supporting the negativity of those who are used to  <br/>
seeing things in cynical and pessimistic ways.  I think it&#39;s great  <br/>
when something someone writes here cheers them up or gives them the  <br/>
first glimpse of the fact that they can choose to be happier. That&#39;s  <br/>
great!   But I won&#39;t make sure cynics are comfortable over there in  <br/>
the dark corner.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995449155">This really hits home with me. Thank you for this insight. I got a lot out of reading &quot;Loving What Is&quot; by Byron Katie and she talks about this principal. <br/>
<br/>
I am loving this list because it is giving me wonderful opportunities to examine my thinking. Even when things are directed at me, it is wonderful practice for me to look at my own reaction and work on the things that make me defensive. I also love how people try to clarify their thinking. <br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Jae<br/>

<br/>
I have found in the past that when something someone has written on a list<br/>
that is not directed to me personally, causes me to react strongly, it is<br/>
often because it is something I need to give more thought. When I am firm<br/>
in my belief in something, I don&#39;t generally react strongly to someone&#39;s<br/>
challenging ideas. I may acknowledge that I don&#39;t agree and then I easily<br/>
move on and it doesn&#39;t cause me to get angry or annoyed. I only get stuck<br/>
when something digs at my conscious.<br/>

Too many children are shamed and guilted with the assumption that  <br/>
they should be happy and grateful just for the huge privilege of  <br/>
being born.   Most humans are the byproduct of sex-for-fun episodes  <br/>
(or worse, when NOT for fun).   Yes I know, and it&#39;s fine, that some  <br/>
people love to think that God has his eye on the little spermatazoa  <br/>
and guides the best one to the ovum at just the right time in that  <br/>
mother&#39;s life when God wants her to get pregnant.   Everyone who  <br/>
claims to believe that can probably name dozens of people who seem  <br/>
serious evidence against it, but they believe God guides sperm in  <br/>
mysterious ways.<br/>
<br/>
I think most people are just accidents.   There&#39;s no gratitude due  <br/>
for being the accidental effect of sex.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once the spermatazoic deed is done, though, then people have choices  <br/>
to make about how to act, how to sit/stand/speak/sing. And some of  <br/>
those will be things to be grateful for, and some will not be.<br/>
<br/>
Making a child feel guilty for being insufficiently grateful for the  <br/>
miracle of life is a lowdown rotten thing women have been doing to  <br/>
children for a long time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>While my daughter does express gratitude I think seeing that as a  <br/>
goal for a child can trap us into teaching mode. *How* do you help a  <br/>
child feel grateful for blessings? If we&#39;re thinking &quot;I need to get  <br/>
her to see things this way,&quot; we can end up pushing them that  <br/>
direction when it seems they aren&#39;t facing that way. We might tell  <br/>
them what we want them to believe. Especially when they aren&#39;t acting  <br/>
grateful we can slip into &quot;You shouldn&#39;t whine because the present  <br/>
wasn&#39;t what you wanted. Some kids don&#39;t even get presents!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But, on the other hand if we are sincerely grateful for them being in  <br/>
our lives and for what we have, that spreads out and infects others. :-)<br/>
<br/>
(We can also help them deal with disappointment (and whatever else  <br/>
that makes it seem like they&#39;re facing the wrong way) with real tools  <br/>
that will help them rather than shame at what are honest feelings.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or do you mean he should not be obligated to<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Correct, no obligation. Kids didn&#39;t ask to be born. We invited them.  <br/>
And with all the good stuff about them, we invited their messes and  <br/>
their different points of view and their pull on our time. Rather  <br/>
than pointing out how inconvenient they are, much better to accept  <br/>
that inconvenience is part of the bargain and help them get whatever  <br/>
they&#39;re trying to get.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390764928">You can&#39;t teach them to be grateful, anyway. So when you say &quot;help&quot;  <br/>
them be grateful, I&#39;m not sure what you mean. If you mean that you  <br/>
model being grateful for what you have to be grateful for, cool. If  <br/>
you mean anything else, it sounds kind of contrived. I&#39;ve made this  <br/>
particular mistake a lot - took me a lot of years to fully understand  <br/>
what a mistake it was - here is the typical scenario:<br/>
<br/>
Kid seems to me to be not showing enough appreciation for something -  <br/>
not grateful for something I think she ought to be grateful for. Seems  <br/>
to me to be a sort of negativity and a taking things for granted  <br/>
attitude. It is truly NOT that I&#39;m personally feeling underappreciated  <br/>
or that I want the kid to act more grateful to me, for my own sake. It  <br/>
is truly that I think the child will be happier if she has a more  <br/>
grateful attitude. So, I point it out. I say something like, &quot;It is so  <br/>
nice that your aunt gave you that book,&quot; or &quot;That sandwich looks  <br/>
really tasty,&quot; or even, &quot;You must be grateful to your sister for  <br/>
making that cd mix for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s already feeling all kinds of gratitude, then fine. I didn&#39;t  <br/>
help her develop it - she already had it. But, if she&#39;s not feeling  <br/>
grateful at all, you know what I just did? I shamed the kid who now  <br/>
thinks, &quot;I &quot;should&quot; be feeling grateful and I&#39;m a bad person because I  <br/>
do NOT feel grateful, I&#39;m just slightly annoyed that --- aunt didn&#39;t  <br/>
get the right book, the sandwich has mustard which I do not like, or  <br/>
my sister made me a cd mix with the music &quot;she&quot; likes, not what I  <br/>
like--- etc. So - I blunder in and basically say, &quot;You should be  <br/>
grateful&quot; and now the kid feels like a jerk.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do that anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I might mention that someone else would appreciate knowing it if the  <br/>
child IS grateful for something. &quot;You liked that book so much; it  <br/>
would be cool if you let your aunt know how much you appreciated it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I might point out something if I genuinely think the child doesn&#39;t  <br/>
know and would like to know - if the chid walks in and eats a pastry  <br/>
that she clearly is really enjoying, I might say, &quot;Hey, be sure thank  <br/>
your aunt for bringing those,&quot; or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is going through list of all the bad stuff that has  <br/>
happened to them, I might say, &quot;You got that great book from your  <br/>
aunt, remember?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a single two-dimensional continuum.  There are  <br/>
lots of factors involved in gratitude.  Is their life worth being  <br/>
grateful for?  There&#39;s one way--make their lives rich and safe and  <br/>
good (or make choices that will lead toward, rather than away, from  <br/>
that).<br/>
<br/>
Optimistic behavior and speech and facial expressions and phrases all  <br/>
will lead to more gratitude.  Eeyore-like pessimism and cynicism will  <br/>
lead to more dissatisfaction, suspicion and negativity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some moms seem to think they&#39;re trying to help children see what  <br/>
there is to be grateful for by saying &quot;BE GRATEFUL, you selfish  <br/>
brat&quot; (or a more gentle version of that).   So I think I do help my  <br/>
children to live lives appreciatively, but I try to stay away from  <br/>
the guilt induction.  (I don&#39;t always succeed.)<br/>

lurking.  Like in the example above, if the book wasn&#39;t right, I may acknowledge with them <br/>
that they really wanted a different book, but then point out that aunt likely didn&#39;t really know <br/>
(or whatever might be true) and that it&#39;s possible to be appreciative of the energy she put <br/>
into the attempt and still think the book stinks.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it seems like they just need a little help finding it, and through one set of lenses it <br/>
isn&#39;t visible, but through another it is.<br/>
