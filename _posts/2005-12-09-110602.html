<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191603803">Hello all :)<br/>
<br/>
Some of you will remember me (I was not King of the Gordok Ogres then) - Pam<br/>
Hartley, unschooling mom in California. I have been a long time away from<br/>
this list (and my other unschooling haunts) but I&#39;m trying to pop in a<br/>
little more often, chat a little more frequently :), and see you all a<br/>
little more consistently!<br/>
<br/>
Brief update, boring to everyone but especially those who have NO idea who<br/>
the heck I am: Wally is great, about to be hired by our local police<br/>
department full time as the animal control officer (increased pay, medical<br/>
benefits after 7 years flying without them, I&#39;m pretty happy); I am great,<br/>
working in the family tax and accounting business (2 minutes from my house,<br/>
flexible hours, music of impending doom in my head since Tax Season is just<br/>
around the corner) training dogs and selling books on the side; Brit and<br/>
Mikey are great, now 11 and 8, still unschooling happily.<br/>
<br/>
This is my favorite time of year, the Christmas tree goes up tomorrow, and I<br/>
start baking every day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll catch up with the conversations and post meat and potatoes stuff as it<br/>
seems appropriate, but wanted to say &quot;hi!&quot; first.<br/>
<br/>

P.S. Obscure World of Warcraft gaming reference in title for those in the<br/>
know. ;) Our entire family of four is highly involved in the game. If you&#39;re<br/>
on Dragonblight server, send a tell to Cassilda sometime!<br/>
