&lt;&lt; A couple of days ago someone mentioned being annoyed by Sagwa on PBS. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Can I <br/>
just say how annoying I find Arthur to be?  He&#39;s always in fear of being <br/>
shamed at school by his friends&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sure!<br/>
<br/>
Holly and another homeschooling family of kids (four of them altogether) LOVE <br/>
Arthur.  They can quote the episodes, they analyze the changes in characters <br/>
over the years, they discuss what lines they think might have been out of <br/>
character or episodes they thought fell short of their potential.  So for <br/>
them, they way THEY watch it, it&#39;s a good source of lots of information about <br/>
interpersonals.  And it makes them all glad they&#39;re not in school!  Some of <br/>
them have been in, and they tell Holly which parts of the school aspects they <br/>
think are realistic.   They mine the heck out of Arthur.<br/>
<br/>
For a while here when the PBS kids&#39; schedule changed it was only going to be <br/>
on at 6:30 a.m. and none of them wanted to get up for it.  But someone at <br/>
KNME figured out this plan was bad, and so it&#39;s repeated at 4:30 or 4:00 in <br/>
the afternoon and now they&#39;re all happy again.<br/>
