<div id="ygrps-yiv-757663787">Hello from a silent reader,<br/>
<br/>
a groups of Dutch Home-educators just started an email action to our<br/>
government. As you might know (or not) home education, let alone<br/>
unschooling, is not a legal possibility in our country as such. We ourselves<br/>
e.g. are still in court after almost 4 years. Next week a meeting will take<br/>
place between the Minister of education and a educational committee of<br/>
members of parliament where this subject will discussed. International input<br/>
is very much appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Background information, sample mails and emailadresses can be found at<br/>

Thank you in advance for your time,<br/>
<br/>
