<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434981945">I have never met a mean Pit Bull . Ever.  And I&#39;ve met many.  I think it<br/>
depends on whether they grow up in a house with guns, live on the east<br/>
coast or  west coast,  rural or urban, public school or homeschool.  Or<br/>
maybe it&#39;s just about learning to be nice.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll take the little boy across the street with his toy six shooter any<br/>
day over the monster next door who likes to pull the legs off<br/>
grasshoppers.  The guy with the toy isn&#39;t hurting anyone.  Parents make<br/>
all the difference, guns or no guns. <br/>
