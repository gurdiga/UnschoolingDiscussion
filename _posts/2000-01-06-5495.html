<br/>
This is an exerpt of a letter I wrote to someone on another list. She was<br/>
asking about a fifth grader, but all of these things can be applied to<br/>
your grandson.<br/>
<br/>
--Read to him daily, (the Bible, stories, Jr. biographies, fact books,<br/>
poetry, classics.) listen to different types of music, find fun ways to<br/>
learn math, raise some varmints, take nature walks, watch the Discovery<br/>
channel (if you get it!), bake cookies, let him write stories, poems or<br/>
letters to family members, keep an ant farm, raise tadpoles, play on the<br/>
computer, teach him how to use the computer, keep a journal, visit the<br/>
library, let him help you make dinner, do a craft, draw or paint, visit a<br/>
museum or science center, go to the zoo, visit a farm, go camping, let<br/>
him help you with menu planning and grocery shopping, take a class<br/>
together, see a movie, visit relatives, buy a roll or two of film and<br/>
have him take pictures of the most interesting things he can find, visit<br/>
the beach, teach him how to run a vacuum, the dishwasher, the washer and<br/>
dryer, and an iron. Grow a garden, flowers, or veggies.<br/>
<br/>
My point is, that there are so many things for you to do with your son,<br/>
that there isn&#39;t a public school student alive who will benefit more than<br/>
your child. Work on your relationship with him, helping him to grow<br/>
morally strong. Teach him how to treat girls, and how he should treat his<br/>
wife one day. Help him to develop a strong work ethic. <br/>
<br/>
I initially was very concerned with teaching to the ps scope and<br/>
sequence, but have since changed my thinking on that. Now, when I think<br/>
of the things I want my children to learn, I have a whole different set<br/>
of standards. I want them to love learning, to have a personal<br/>
relationship with Jesus, to know the Bible intimately, to have a general<br/>
understanding of the way the world works. I think children should be<br/>
exposed to classical music, literature, and biographies of people of<br/>
merit and honor. (This has been difficult to follow through with as the<br/>
library is chock full of bio&#39;s on sports figures, rock and film stars) I<br/>
want my kids to have a strong base in mathematics, and be able to run a<br/>
household singlehandedly, (even our son). I want them to learn<br/>
discipline, honesty, and consideration for others, and have a strong work<br/>
ethic. I want them to have an appreciation for nature, living creatures,<br/>
and for their freedoms. I want them to thank God without ceasing for the<br/>
many blessings in their lives, and live life with a positive attitude. I<br/>
want them to keep themselves fit and healthy, and take care of their<br/>
families. <br/>
