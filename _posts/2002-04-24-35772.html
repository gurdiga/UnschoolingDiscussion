<div id="ygrps-yiv-617760894">You are sooo right!<br/>
  And because of school being what it is, kids who read novels are considered <br/>
  GOOD kids, studious kids, bright kids.  No matter that the novel is about sex <br/>
  and drugs and murder, the vision of someone reading a book is soothing in <br/>
  this culture.  If the kid sitting next to the reader (the reader would have <br/>
  been me) is drawing some REALLY cool pictures with details of WWII planes, <br/>
  that is BAD, dumb, a waste of time and paper.  If another kid is looking out <br/>
  the window translating new things he&#39;s learned into Tewa (what they speak in <br/>
  Santa Clara Pueblo), it looks like he&#39;s doing NOTHING.  (But at least he&#39;s <br/>
  not wasting paper).  And if another kid is writing a note to a friend who <br/>
  REALLY  needs some friendship and support, that note will be confiscated and <br/>
  torn up and they&#39;ll both be in trouble.  But that kid who&#39;s reading about <br/>
  hookers and the mafia is a GOOD KID!<br/>

I was reading this and I wondered something too, what about spelling? I<br/>
liked my children to learn spelling rules. Spelling is proven to NOT be<br/>

My children picked up on writing very easily and happily as they wrote<br/>
to their grandparents, friends or &quot;Rule&#39;s for my Bedroom!&quot; LOL! And<br/>
knowing how to break down syllables and knowing the rules with each<br/>
syllable. They were happy to not to have to ask for help in their<br/>
spelling as often and got a huge feeling of independence from it. That<br/>
was my observation.<br/>

I like to use the Writing Road to Reading, there are no workbooks, but<br/>
the child develops a notebook on their own as they go along. It&#39;s a<br/>

I&#39;m not sure I believe this and here&#39;s why;<br/>
<br/>
My dad was a high school drop out.  My mom has a master&#39;s degree in <br/>
education.  My dad could spell any word you asked him to (well, <br/>
except for the REALLY odd exceptions), my mom uses a dictionary all <br/>
the time.  I too, learned all the spelling &#39;rules&#39; in school.  It <br/>
hasn&#39;t done near as much for my spelling as my love of reading has.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose you could try to get them interested in playing hangman.  <br/>
That might help.<br/>

<br/>
Proven is a very strong word. Who proved this and under what <br/>
circumstances?  I don&#39;t agree.<br/>
And the only reason the &quot;whole language&quot; thing gets a bad rap, is <br/>
that it can&#39;t produce a measured result. Schools like testing <br/>
and &quot;proving&quot; a child knows something. Kind of hard to do when you <br/>
are letting them learn in a natural fashion....which is what whole <br/>
language is based on.<br/>
It claims that children learn written language the same way they <br/>
learn to speak...by being submersed in it.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest ds is learning to spell better, a little at a time, mostly <br/>
by using the internet.<br/>
The other point to remember is that not all people are naturally good <br/>
at spelling...there are many adults that learned all the <br/>
spelling &quot;rules&quot; (let&#39;s also remember that every rule gets broken by <br/>
certain words), took all the tests, did all the damn worksheets and <br/>
still aren&#39;t very good spellers.<br/>
Being able to spell perfectly is not the pivotal hinge for success in <br/>
this life.<br/>

I understood it as; the material being read by the child is immoral but<br/>
because the child is &quot;reading a book&quot; he&#39;s considered &quot;a good student.&quot;<br/>
Not taking into consideration the nature of the material no matter how<br/>

has taught himself how to drive the family station wagon!&quot; But ignoring<br/>
the fact he&#39;s driving on the wrong side of the highway!<br/>

<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What does &quot;not natural&quot; mean? Eating with a fork is not natural but kids<br/>
pick it up through modeling. We don&#39;t need fork lessons ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Communicating through speech may be natural, but English isn&#39;t. Wearing<br/>
clothes. Using a bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, English is not a particularly regular language. But kids learn to speak<br/>
it without English lessons. Is learning to spell through and though and<br/>
thought any different than picking up how to conjugate &quot;to be&quot;? Kids may<br/>
stumble over conjugations when they become unconsciously aware of the<br/>
pattern (like reverting to &quot;he runned&quot;) but do they need lessons to learn<br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>

except the syllables. (Though she has a vague concept of them from writing<br/>
comic books and having to split lots of words to fit into the balloons she<br/>
insists on drawing first ;-) Her spelling is still occasionally creative at<br/>
10 but it&#39;s vastly improved to what she used at 9. She&#39;s never had a<br/>
spelling lesson and doesn&#39;t seem irritated at asking for spellings. To her<br/>
spelling is a big messy interesting puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
Which is just saying that lessons weren&#39;t necessary for it to come about.<br/>
There are pros and cons to lessons and no lessons, but lessons are not<br/>
necessary. For me at least two of the pros are her realizing she&#39;s puzzled<br/>
out the intricacies of the English language without being taught, the<br/>
freedom to do other things during what would have been lesson time. The cons<br/>
are getting spelling later than some other kids. (But not all kids. Some<br/>
people never do learn to spell even with &quot;expert&quot; instruction.) Which is<br/>
only a problem if she is faced with some sort of comparison but that&#39;s never<br/>
happened so it&#39;s no big deal.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are advantages to teaching. But there are also trade offs. I think Pam<br/>
does this really well and my daughter wants to do stuff so I&#39;ll let someone<br/>
else handle this one. (Or I&#39;ll get back to it.)<br/>

but everything, as my daughter writes for her own pleasure and discovers<br/>
spelling on her own. It&#39;s more than about acquiring spelling rules.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve really got to go. I&#39;m really sorry this isn&#39;t as thorough as I<br/>
could be.<br/>

Well, like I said, I knew that couldn&#39;t be what she meant.  But I had <br/>
to read it twice to make sure.<br/>
<br/>
And then we are into the subject of censoring what our kids read.  <br/>
Jenni reads books most parent don&#39;t let their kids read.  She has read <br/>
the entire Laurell K Hamilton, &quot;Anita Blake&quot; vampire series.  (I&#39;m <br/>
almost done with them - like I said she reads faster than anyone I <br/>
know. <br/>
So who gets to judge what is moral and good for your kids to read?  <br/>

There is no method to cover all of English&#39;s many exceptions.  English has a <br/>
German grammatical base, with a TON of French words from 1000 years ago, VERY <br/>
many from Latin (biology, law) and Greek (math, sciences), and although <br/>
learning spelling rules for all those things might help some people, it&#39;s <br/>
more likely to really make the teacher feel good than to cover all bases for <br/>
the students.  And why do some English words have &quot;k&quot; in them, like &quot;ski&quot; and <br/>
&quot;skirt&quot;?   Norse.  &quot;Skirt&quot; and &quot;shirt&quot; were the same word at one time, and it <br/>
came back into English in another form, so we kept both, separate, with <br/>
separate meanings.  What spelling rule will explain why English is so weird?  <br/>

I understood it as; the material being read by the child is immoral but<br/>
<br/>
because the child is &quot;reading a book&quot; he&#39;s considered &quot;a good student.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not taking into consideration the nature of the material no matter how<br/>
<br/>
damaging it can be to the child&#39;s character. Sort of like, &quot;Oh Johnny<br/>
<br/>
has taught himself how to drive the family station wagon!&quot; But ignoring<br/>
<br/>
the fact he&#39;s driving on the wrong side of the highway!<br/>
<br/>
Is that right? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.  It&#39;s one facet, but not the form.<br/>
<br/>
Many people call reading good no matter WHAT a child is reading (unless it&#39;s <br/>
a comic book or a magazine about skateboarding; those are still in the BAD <br/>
category, because they have pictures and the material won&#39;t be on the test).<br/>
<br/>
Many people call call watching TV bad no matter WHAT wondrous thing a child <br/>
is learning.<br/>
<br/>
Many people call looking out the window &quot;doing nothing&quot; without regard to <br/>
what the child is thinking.<br/>
<br/>
For unschoolers, these prejudices can be insurmountable stumbling blocks.  As <br/>
small as they seem, they create walls between people and the real world.<br/>

In our family, the kids can read what they want.<br/>
In schools, since most kids who are reading are reading on the sly under the <br/>
desk anyway, they can read what they want if they don&#39;t get caught. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My point wasn&#39;t about the morality, but about the lack of judgement about <br/>
content in someone who says &quot;reading is good&quot; while saying &quot;other input is <br/>
not as good.&quot;<br/>

Spelling may not be natural &lt;G&gt; - but learning to spell certainly is for most <br/>
unschooled kids. (About 1 out of 5 people seem to NOT have the ability to <br/>
spell well - and all the formal lessons in the world don&#39;t seem to impact <br/>
that. There are some strategies they can learn to help them deal with <br/>

Hi Sandra, <br/>
Thanks for taking the time to help me mill this over! :O)<br/>
Well, maybe too, the method that was used on your husband didn&#39;t work in<br/>
school, and maybe early on he just plain burned out so learning stopped<br/>
and left a bad experience for him to remember. And writing things that<br/>
matter to the author is VERY important. Who wants to write about<br/>
something they aren&#39;t even interested in? I&#39;m sure as an adult he finds<br/>
resources to help him spell better and help him with grammar.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
With all do respect, many homeschoolers have turned from ps because of<br/>
&quot;whole language&quot; which diminishes the child&#39;s ability to sound out words<br/>
using phonics. Children were found to naturally try to connect the<br/>
sound, but without the &quot;rules&quot; they were unsuccessful, especially in the<br/>
area of spelling. The term &quot;inventive spelling&quot; or &quot;phonetical spelling&quot;<br/>
(what I call incorrect spelling) was birthed after &quot;whole language&quot; was<br/>
introduced into our school systems. Children that heard words that were<br/>
only spoken to them and not written down, (which they are exposed to<br/>
more audio than visual in a given day) were not able to spell the new<br/>
words spoken to them because they had no &quot;plan of action&quot; so to speak.<br/>
 <br/>
 The American alphabet is phonetical. There are certain sounds and rules<br/>
that go together. Every &quot;symbol&quot; has a sound and a rule: like the &quot;q&quot;<br/>
will always be accompanied by the &quot;u&quot;, and USUALLY the &quot;e&quot; ending will<br/>
make a vowel in a syllable &quot;say its name sound.&quot;<br/>
The Chinese use &quot;characters&quot; to read, (not even the Chinese know the<br/>
extent of their written language! They tend to &quot;max out.&quot;) I feel that<br/>
my children will be handicapped in the area of written language if I<br/>
don&#39;t take the time to gently introduce their language and its rules to<br/>
them. I prefer that they don&#39;t read the English language the way the<br/>
Chinese read the characters of their language. Eventually I will have to<br/>
end their frustration by giving them the rules anyway, they make perfect<br/>
sense and they are proven. So my children find them valuable.        <br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t get that &quot;spelling is proven not to be natural&quot; from a spelling<br/>
book :o). It was research done by, not an educator at all, but a<br/>
neurologist. Dr. Orton and his sidekick Gillingham researched that the<br/>
written language is best learned MULTISENSORILY. In other words, using<br/>
ALL the senses rather than just sight, or sound, but phonetics with even<br/>
saying sounds allowed to oneself while writing the letter symbols. His<br/>
work showed that the brain doesn&#39;t really ready &quot;letters&quot; but lines,<br/>
parts of lines, circles and part of circles and that those lines and<br/>
circles trigger the brain to retrieve sounds as the child remembers them<br/>
when creating a letter. <br/>
 <br/>
Look at the work of Noah Webster! What a great man, he took the time to<br/>
&quot;format&quot; our language so that the written word would be clearly<br/>
understood by all people. He, in essence, wrote a curriculum, the<br/>
reference book, the dictionary which is where we go for spelling rules<br/>
as well as sounds. He backed up his work with the renown &quot;Blue Back<br/>
Speller.&quot; I don&#39;t care for this type of book really, but some parts of<br/>
it are redeemable, this particular book seems to be merely a &quot;crash<br/>
course&quot;. In his day, those who were extremely literate understood why<br/>
words were formed the way that they were, including the Latin and Greek<br/>
roots. It was taught in some early educational institutions with zeal.<br/>
Unlike today, where spelling programs are wimpy and flat, no real<br/>
information at all to use for further guidance or to perk curiosity and<br/>
in fact create frustration.<br/>
 <br/>
Some phonograms have more that one sound, even the multiple letter ones<br/>
like &quot;ch&quot; which can be used as &quot;ch&quot; (hard sound) &quot;k&quot; and &quot;sh&quot;. There is<br/>
a reason we pronounce &quot;church&quot; the way that we do, though I won&#39;t get<br/>
into it unless you want to. :o)&lt;bg&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s important for my children to know all the sounds of the<br/>
short &quot;i&quot; sound, and when to use a &quot;y&quot; and that there are only three<br/>
words in the English language that end in &quot;u&quot; impromptu, you and thou.<br/>
Knowing that helps them to spell better. The word &quot;blue&quot; can&#39;t be<br/>
spelled &quot;b-l-u&quot; because they now know that only those THREE words are<br/>
spelled with &quot;u&quot; so they must investigate one of the FIVE silent &quot;e&quot;<br/>
rules.<br/>
They have learned these rules over the space of just more than a year.<br/>
Only FIVE rules for &quot;e&quot; in a YEAR? Yes, we take if VERY easy and work as<br/>
we feel it&#39;s time to move on. They have learned that research and<br/>
referencing can produce great things for them when they want to expand<br/>
their abilities. <br/>
 <br/>
The world is full of illiterate people. People that WANT to learn to<br/>
read, but have to learn differently, maybe multisensorily? We are<br/>
virtually surrounded by the written word everywhere. If it were true<br/>
that &quot;whole language&quot; was successful then there should be NO illiteracy<br/>
at all, people would just pick up reading and spelling skills just by<br/>
walking down a very busy Market St.  Remember, there are many different<br/>
learning types, not just visual. It has been reiterated over and again<br/>
that 80% of the population isn&#39;t visual, but AUDITORY.<br/>
And again, shows the failure of &quot;whole language.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
My husband didn&#39;t learn English until he was 12. He is Mexican, born in<br/>
South Texas. He is second generation born in America on his mother&#39;s<br/>
side, first on his father&#39;s side. He went to ps there. He really<br/>
struggles because when the dilapidated system that he was in decided to<br/>
teach him &quot;whole language&quot; instead of phonics and virtually NO grammar,<br/>
he became stumped as an adult. We have a CD Rom that he enjoys very much<br/>
and is excited about how much he has improved over a short couple of<br/>
months. <br/>
He struggled with spelling tremendously, but when we talk about new<br/>
words, I use my material to expose him to rules that now make sense, so<br/>
he gains knowledge and he is more comfortable with being able to write<br/>
and express himself the way he should. He has to do plenty of writing<br/>
being in the Navy!<br/>
 <br/>
In DC where our laws are made, legislation gets passed through that<br/>
effects ALL our lives due to the fact that the average American doesn&#39;t<br/>
understand the English language. When people don&#39;t understand what they<br/>
are reading, the average person avoids or ignores the material.<br/>
It&#39;s easier and &quot;who has time anyway?&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s not my calling to know<br/>
it&quot; and really what has happened is the skills were NEVER developed. <br/>
 <br/>
Does it matter that my children gain a systematic approach (one that<br/>
isn&#39;t overbearing or redundant)? I do think so. Just as I don&#39;t want my<br/>
children to think &quot;Ebonics&quot; is a language that will help them to succeed<br/>
in life, (maybe in a town that reads, writes and speaks Ebonics) but not<br/>
the rest of the world, I don&#39;t want them thinking that not having the<br/>
best written communication possible is essential for adult living.<br/>
 <br/>
Remember that I&#39;m USing the &quot;Ebonics&quot; as merely an example of our school<br/>
system&#39;s caving in and not teaching the English language as it is, but a<br/>
crippling second rate form of expression, same applies to Tex-Mex that<br/>
my husband learned in ps. You will not see either of these language<br/>
expressions broadly based in our English speaking American culture,<br/>
causing those who learn these to be in essence, handicapped in<br/>
communication.<br/>
 <br/>
I just feel like having them read isn&#39;t enough. They must also write,<br/>
and spell and do those things very well. <br/>
 <br/>
These are MY convictions about the English language. I&#39;m not trying to<br/>
offend anyone. Please excuse my passions as I think through the idea of<br/>
USing and language arts. Thank you for giving me a forum in which to<br/>
&quot;think out loud.&quot; :o)<br/>

No. He just gets better from practicing and reading.<br/>
He has written formal opinions about things, letters, reports, announcements <br/>
and flyers, and I&#39;ve proofread for him (and he for me), and he has never <br/>
&quot;found a resource&quot; to help him with anything in any school-looking way.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; <br/>
<br/>
With all do respect, many homeschoolers have turned from ps because of<br/>
<br/>
&quot;whole language&quot; which diminishes the child&#39;s ability to sound out words<br/>
<br/>
using phonics. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That would be &quot;due respect.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Many homeschoolers have turned from public school for a LOT of reasons.  That <br/>
doesn&#39;t make all the things they left to avoid wrong just because people used <br/>
that particular thing to blame when they left.<br/>
<br/>
Phonics is just a tool.  I learned by sight reading.  We used to draw boxes <br/>
around the letters, following their shapes.  Then I switched states and <br/>
schools and did phonics.  I could already read at that point, and so spent <br/>
two years doing phonics exercises just because that&#39;s what we had to do to <br/>
&quot;get a good grade in reading.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Whether a school uses look-say or phonics, each individual child learns to <br/>
read, somehow, in his own way, either with the assistance of or in spite of <br/>
the intervention of, the school&#39;s &quot;method.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; <br/>
<br/>
 The American alphabet is phonetical. There are certain sounds and rules<br/>
<br/>
that go together.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re preaching to a choir which has moved on beyond what you&#39;re saying, for <br/>
the most part.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Look at the work of Noah Webster! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of the people here are former teachers, or current teachers, and some <br/>
are researchers, some are counselors who have studied development, etc.  <br/>
We&#39;ve looked at lots and tons of studies and theories.<br/>
<br/>
And through all that, there is much practical belief and experience pointing <br/>
toward unschooling as a rich, viable plan of action.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Unlike today, where spelling programs are wimpy and flat, no real<br/>
<br/>
information at all to use for further guidance or to perk curiosity and<br/>
<br/>
in fact create frustration.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
While unschooling, there is no need to use ANY spelling program.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There is a reason we pronounce &quot;church&quot; the way that we do, though I won&#39;t <br/>
get<br/>
<br/>
into it unless you want to. :o)&lt;bg&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of complex historical reasons that the same word became &quot;kirk&quot; <br/>
in Scotland.  But the fact remains that kids learn to pronounce things in <br/>
their native dialect (and other dialects later, in many cases) and then to <br/>
spell in standard ways by various means.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think it&#39;s important for my children to know all the sounds of the<br/>
<br/>
short &quot;i&quot; sound, and when to use a &quot;y&quot; and that there are only three<br/>
<br/>
words in the English language that end in &quot;u&quot; impromptu, you and thou.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nobody needs to know those particular items in order to know how to read or <br/>
spell.  If it&#39;s fascinating to you, that&#39;s great and I&#39;m sure your kids will <br/>
pick up on your enthusiasm.  But if you&#39;re telling yourself or your children <br/>
that that is the ONLY way they could have learned, that those things were <br/>
necessary, or that without you and your noble sacrifice to teach them they <br/>
could never have learned to read, you&#39;ll be setting you and them up to think <br/>
that now you&#39;ll have to find the perfect method for other subjects.<br/>
<br/>
And if they meet my kids and see that they can spell no better and read no <br/>
faster than kids who learned by wilder, more everyday means, then what?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If it were true<br/>
<br/>
that &quot;whole language&quot; was successful then there should be NO illiteracy<br/>
<br/>
at all, people would just pick up reading and spelling skills &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you can find a population with leisure and no history of forced education <br/>
at an age before they&#39;re ready to understand reading, then maybe you&#39;ll have <br/>
a control group for your theory.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In DC where our laws are made, legislation gets passed through that<br/>
<br/>
effects ALL our lives due to the fact that the average American doesn&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
understand the English language.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get the point.  &quot;Affects,&quot; not &quot;effect,&quot; but I still don&#39;t understand <br/>
if you&#39;re saying that because not all Americans can read contract law or <br/>
legalese....  You lost me.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; <br/>
<br/>
Does it matter that my children gain a systematic approach (one that<br/>
<br/>
isn&#39;t overbearing or redundant)? I do think so. Just as I don&#39;t want my<br/>
<br/>
children to think &quot;Ebonics&quot; is a language that will help them to succeed<br/>
<br/>
in life, (maybe in a town that reads, writes and speaks Ebonics) but not<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unless you are talking about a monetary unit used in Albania, the qintar.<br/>
Or the wooly undercoat of a musk ox, used in making fabrics, the qiviut.<br/>
There are a few more, like Qatar, which is the only one I&#39;d personally<br/>
run into before checking the dictionary... but the world &quot;always&quot; when<br/>
applied to spelling is often wrong... and I only checked the words<br/>
beginning with a q.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter learned to read mainly through sight reading, as far as I can<br/>
discern. When she first started reading, words she didn&#39;t recognize were<br/>
sort of acknowledged and skipped through - she knew that Tia Dolores was<br/>
Josefina&#39;s aunt, but when she wanted to tell me about her she called her<br/>
&quot;tilldoris&quot;, and wasn&#39;t really concerned about how close or far that was<br/>
from the actual word. <br/>
<br/>
I noticed that the more she read, the more she could pronounce things<br/>
correctly. I think she intuited the generalities of phonetic<br/>
pronounciation through being exposed to them - if you notice that every<br/>
word beginning with the letter &quot;t&quot; starts with the sound /t/, you can<br/>
begin to expect that to be true. Occasionally I&#39;ve pointed out a phonetic<br/>
generality when she&#39;s asked about spelling, I remember telling her at one<br/>
point that the /ng/ sound was almost always spelled &quot;ing&quot;... but most of<br/>
those she&#39;s just figured out for herself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t foolproof - the other day she was telling me how she loved the<br/>
name she pronounced &quot;Jack-wee-ess&quot; for  a boy, and as we talked it<br/>
eventually became clear that she had read the name &quot;Jacques&quot; and<br/>
mispronounced it... although he way would make perfect sense if it wasn&#39;t<br/>
a French word. So we talked some about French words and French phonetics.<br/>
<br/>
I also remember that she knew how to spell Jacques from reading it...<br/>
<br/>
And, sort of off the subject, but you seem to have a pretty skewed<br/>
understanding of the Whole Language theory. Whole Language certainly<br/>
includes seeing  words, reading them, playing with them...when done<br/>
correctly, it even includes some basic phonics, although the phonics<br/>
knowledge usually comes after the word itself has meaning. Words are seen<br/>
more holistically, not as phonemes stuck together but as individual units<br/>
of meaning.  <br/>
<br/>
And no schools teach &quot;Ebonics&quot;, at least none of which I&#39;m aware. I<br/>
believe there&#39;s still a difference of opinion over whether it&#39;s a dialect<br/>
or a language. However, it is in no way inferior to what you or I speak.<br/>
I can&#39;t speak &quot;Ebonics&quot; (African-American Vernacular English is the<br/>
preferred term, or AAVE). Linguistic systems are not inferior or<br/>
superior, they just *are*. AAVE has its own unique grammar and<br/>
pronouciation rules, different than ours but just as definite and<br/>
complete, maybe more so. For example, standard english has no grammatical<br/>
way to differentiate actions done habitually with those done once, except<br/>
of course by adding &quot;habitually&quot; or some other awkward construction. In<br/>
AAVE, the word &quot;be&quot; denotes a habitual activity, so saying &quot;She be<br/>
reading books&quot; means &quot;She habitually reads books&quot;, whereas &quot;She reading<br/>
books&quot; means &quot;She&#39;s reading books right now&quot;. I wish I could speak  AAVE,<br/>
although I&#39;d probably look pretty dumb doing it as a white girl... kinda<br/>
like the old woman in the movie &quot;Airplane&quot; who spoke jive...;-)<br/>
<br/>
I heard John McWhorter talking about this on NPR one day. I&#39;ve read a<br/>
couple of his books, too, and they&#39;re fascinating...<br/>
<br/>
And yes, it&#39;s nice to be fluent in standard english, especially when<br/>
you&#39;re applying for jobs and stuff, but I&#39;m not worried about it, I know<br/>
it&#39;ll happen... but then, I worry very little anyway. ;-)<br/>

 <br/>
In essence YOU were the resource by proofreading, and I&#39;m sure<br/>
correcting things that may have needed it taught him. The reading of the<br/>
books is, in essence a resource, familiarizing oneself with the words<br/>
that are spelled consistently. <br/>
But what if he learned rules for spelling? Then you would no longer<br/>
needed to proofread for correctional purposes. Writing formal letters<br/>
require certain formats. Different letters need different formats.<br/>
I&#39;m sure he had to learn what format was appropriate for what he was<br/>
writing. Not just anything would do. Did he learn by &quot;trial and error&quot;<br/>
or did you &quot;teach it &quot; to him? Or did he turn to a resource to find the<br/>
correct format? It couldn&#39;t have come naturally, letter writing and<br/>

doesn&#39;t make all the things they left to avoid wrong just because people<br/>
used <br/>
that particular thing to blame when they left.<br/>
I was writing only of &quot;whole language&quot; nothing else. It stands to reason<br/>
that there are many reasons to leave, crime is a huge motivator!<br/>
 <br/>
Phonics is just a tool.  I learned by sight reading.  We used to draw<br/>

to <br/>
&quot;get a good grade in reading.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;,,<br/>
I like to think that Phonics is more for &quot;spelling&quot; purpose than<br/>
reading. Many children read wonderfully, but spelling is a different<br/>
matter entirely. Spelling is  much more difficult to learn and I believe<br/>
more time consuming. <br/>
 <br/>
Whether a school uses look-say or phonics, each individual child learns<br/>
to <br/>
read, somehow, in his own way, either with the assistance of or in spite<br/>
of <br/>
the intervention of, the school&#39;s &quot;method &quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Spelling is a different matter, also, words that were unusual and had<br/>
many syllables were very hard to read correctly. Like my last name,<br/>
Cifuentes  VERY FEW adults can read my last name correctly and usually<br/>
add a &quot;qu&quot; sound where the &quot;f&quot; is. But when I break down my name into<br/>
syllables (not a whole language thing to do), they get it fine! :O)<br/>
<br/>
 You&#39;re preaching to a choir which has moved on beyond what you&#39;re<br/>
saying, for <br/>
the most part. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
And I&#39;m still thinking anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Look at the work of Noah Webster! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of the people here are former teachers, or current teachers, and<br/>
some <br/>
are researchers, some are counselors who have studied development, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve looked at lots and tons of studies and theories.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>
 <br/>
I understood that to be so before I posted. :O)Thanks for the reminder.<br/>
But I was discussing Webster&#39;s work and how it helps us even today when<br/>
it comes to language arts. His work is FACT, not theory. It&#39;s a fact<br/>
that our spelling today is standard, where before, it was not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And through all that, there is much practical belief and experience<br/>
pointing <br/>
toward unschooling as a rich, viable plan of action.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
But the whole point of my writing this is about SPELLLING. I still<br/>
haven&#39;t heard more on SPELLING that makes sense. Remember, there seems<br/>
to be an agreement here that folks that need a bit of walking through<br/>
and clicking with the idea slowly get that chance. Can&#39;t my questions be<br/>
simply answered as to a method when it comes to SPELLING?<br/>
<br/>
While unschooling, there is no need to use ANY spelling program.<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Back to my original question, then how do they learn SPELLING RULES that<br/>
will help them SPELL?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of complex historical reasons that the same word became<br/>
&quot;kirk&quot; <br/>
in Scotland.  But the fact remains that kids learn to pronounce things<br/>
in <br/>
their native dialect (and other dialects later, in many cases) and then<br/>
to <br/>
spell in standard ways by various means. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
My concern is with the ENGLISH language. What they will use to<br/>
communicate with in written form as adults which is STANDARD.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nobody needs to know those particular items in order to know how to read<br/>
or <br/>
spell.  If it&#39;s fascinating to you, that&#39;s great and I&#39;m sure your kids<br/>
will <br/>
pick up on your enthusiasm.  But if you&#39;re telling yourself or your<br/>
children <br/>
that that is the ONLY way they could have learned, that those things<br/>
were <br/>
necessary, or that without you and your noble sacrifice to teach them<br/>
they <br/>
could never have learned to read, you&#39;ll be setting you and them up to<br/>
think <br/>
that now you&#39;ll have to find the perfect method for other subjects.<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Well, I wouldn&#39;t call it a &quot;noble sacrifice&quot; but I am glad that I do<br/>
keep them with me because we are a family. I was just saying in the<br/>
above, wouldn&#39;t it be neat to just &quot;know&quot; those things to make it<br/>
easier. Didn&#39;t you ever look at something and say &quot;Oh! Now I get it, I<br/>
wish I&#39;d known that a while ago!&quot; Same thing...<br/>
<br/>
And if they meet my kids and see that they can spell no better and read<br/>
no <br/>
faster than kids who learned by wilder, more everyday means, then what?<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No different than me meeting adult who learned any given subject<br/>
different than me. I&#39;m inspired by them. :O)<br/>
Not that I know all that much either. But I&#39;m merely exploring spelling<br/>
rules and their validity. <br/>
And I&#39;m not comparing our children here, or anywhere. I don&#39;t care to<br/>
worry about comparisons, but what tools are beneficial for MY kids and<br/>
does anyone else feel the way I do. <br/>
<br/>
If you can find a population with leisure and no history of forced<br/>
education <br/>
at an age before they&#39;re ready to understand reading, then maybe you&#39;ll<br/>
have <br/>
a control group for your theory. <br/>
I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s &quot;my theory&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get the point.  &quot;Affects,&quot; not &quot;effect,&quot; but I still don&#39;t<br/>
understand <br/>
if you&#39;re saying that because not all Americans can read contract law or<br/>
<br/>
legalese....  You lost me. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>
 <br/>
I have a thought that those who do not read well or spell well have a<br/>
disadvantage. Only, that&#39;s how I feel right now. Maybe that might<br/>
change? I&#39;m just exploring the idea right now.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Spanglish,&quot; it is in Northern New Mexico.  People who use mixed phrases<br/>
KNOW <br/>
it&#39;s just for speaking and not for writing. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
Well, typically, where we are from, 45 mins from the border, it&#39;s<br/>
Tex-Mex on the American side.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
Mexicans over the border just say &quot;Spanish&quot; as does the Mexicans in the<br/>
area of Texas I&#39;m from. I&#39;m not so sure about the entire state of Texas.<br/>
<br/>
But either way, it&#39;s NOTHING like the Spanish that is spoken in<br/>
California, or Spain or Cuba or any other country. Dialects are rampant,<br/>
even with the same region. It&#39;s confusing to a &quot;Gringa&quot; (slang for white<br/>
person, where I&#39;m from, but might be an insult to someone in another<br/>
region?) like me to learn, especially in NC! Where I may learn the<br/>
Spanish presented to me by the local of this area, but then again, when<br/>
I go home. They don&#39;t understand me  and I&#39;m still unfamiliar with what<br/>
some of their words are. (I really should remember more, but for some<br/>
reason, I just didn&#39;t get interested as a youngster.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; <br/>
<br/>
I just feel like having them read isn&#39;t enough. They must also write,<br/>
<br/>
and spell and do those things very well. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you feel you must HAVE them read, write and spell, then they are<br/>
doing <br/>
what you decide to do, on your terms, to your standards.   <br/>
<br/>
I hope for your sake and theirs you&#39;ll lighten up before they&#39;re not<br/>
having <br/>
any fun at all. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I do not approach them the way I approach the list at all! I&#39;m sure that<br/>
what I&#39;m saying may be &quot;wordy&quot; or whatever one would dub it. My children<br/>
love to learn English, and SPANISH! <br/>
We just have to learn what is available and my husband&#39;s input is a help<br/>
too.<br/>
 <br/>
Please don&#39;t assume that those who get excited about learning methods<br/>
are burning out their children, I believe that I can have some really<br/>
good ideas and they help us come up with some good ones too. I haven&#39;t<br/>
been the &quot;heavy&quot; since we started looking closely at the English<br/>
language, and my children find it fascinating too. Why is it considered<br/>
&quot;not fun&quot; to learn about SPELLING? <br/>

I haven&#39;t figured out what might help someone like that to spell better, <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wonder if you hate the whole language approach because of the way it&#39;s <br/>
been implemented in the schools.  Originally the idea was to immerse the <br/>
kids in good literature and give them chances to begin writing down their <br/>
ideas before they had learned all the mechanics of writing (and before they <br/>
had learned to hate writing *because* of the mechanics).  Along the way, <br/>
they were supposed to get some instruction in phonics related to what they <br/>
were trying to read or write, much the way an unschooling parent would <br/>
point out the appropriate spelling rule when it came up.  Then a lot of <br/>
school districts outlawed the phonics component, turning the approach into <br/>
the look-say method, which helps some kids but not others.<br/>

beginning with a q.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter learned to read mainly through sight reading, as far as I<br/>
can<br/>
discern. When she first started reading, words she didn&#39;t recognize were<br/>
sort of acknowledged and skipped through - she knew that Tia Dolores was<br/>
Josefina&#39;s aunt, but when she wanted to tell me about her she called her<br/>
&quot;tilldoris&quot;, and wasn&#39;t really concerned about how close or far that was<br/>
from the actual word. <br/>
<br/>
I noticed that the more she read, the more she could pronounce things<br/>
correctly. I think she intuited the generalities of phonetic<br/>
pronounciation through being exposed to them - if you notice that every<br/>
word beginning with the letter &quot;t&quot; starts with the sound /t/, you can<br/>
begin to expect that to be true. Occasionally I&#39;ve pointed out a<br/>
phonetic<br/>
generality when she&#39;s asked about spelling, I remember telling her at<br/>
one<br/>
point that the /ng/ sound was almost always spelled &quot;ing&quot;... but most of<br/>
those she&#39;s just figured out for herself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t foolproof - the other day she was telling me how she loved the<br/>
name she pronounced &quot;Jack-wee-ess&quot; for  a boy, and as we talked it<br/>
eventually became clear that she had read the name &quot;Jacques&quot; and<br/>
mispronounced it... although he way would make perfect sense if it<br/>
wasn&#39;t<br/>
a French word. So we talked some about French words and French<br/>
phonetics.<br/>
<br/>
I also remember that she knew how to spell Jacques from reading it...<br/>
<br/>
And, sort of off the subject, but you seem to have a pretty skewed<br/>
understanding of the Whole Language theory. Whole Language certainly<br/>
includes seeing  words, reading them, playing with them...when done<br/>
correctly, it even includes some basic phonics, although the phonics<br/>
knowledge usually comes after the word itself has meaning. Words are<br/>
seen<br/>
more holistically, not as phonemes stuck together but as individual<br/>
units<br/>
of meaning.  <br/>
<br/>
And no schools teach &quot;Ebonics&quot;, at least none of which I&#39;m aware. I<br/>
believe there&#39;s still a difference of opinion over whether it&#39;s a<br/>
dialect<br/>
or a language. However, it is in no way inferior to what you or I speak.<br/>
I can&#39;t speak &quot;Ebonics&quot; (African-American Vernacular English is the<br/>
preferred term, or AAVE). Linguistic systems are not inferior or<br/>
superior, they just *are*. AAVE has its own unique grammar and<br/>
pronouciation rules, different than ours but just as definite and<br/>
complete, maybe more so. For example, standard english has no<br/>
grammatical<br/>
way to differentiate actions done habitually with those done once,<br/>
except<br/>
of course by adding &quot;habitually&quot; or some other awkward construction. In<br/>
AAVE, the word &quot;be&quot; denotes a habitual activity, so saying &quot;She be<br/>
reading books&quot; means &quot;She habitually reads books&quot;, whereas &quot;She reading<br/>
books&quot; means &quot;She&#39;s reading books right now&quot;. I wish I could speak<br/>
AAVE,<br/>
although I&#39;d probably look pretty dumb doing it as a white girl... kinda<br/>
like the old woman in the movie &quot;Airplane&quot; who spoke jive...;-)<br/>
<br/>
I heard John McWhorter talking about this on NPR one day. I&#39;ve read a<br/>
couple of his books, too, and they&#39;re fascinating...<br/>
<br/>
And yes, it&#39;s nice to be fluent in standard english, especially when<br/>
you&#39;re applying for jobs and stuff, but I&#39;m not worried about it, I know<br/>
it&#39;ll happen... but then, I worry very little anyway. ;-)<br/>

But why? Not an attacking question. Just ask yourself what you think<br/>
would<br/>
have happened if you didn&#39;t teach them spelling rules. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
I saw what happened before we started learning rules, they questioned me<br/>
about why certain words needed correcting. It was a relief to be able to<br/>
systematically show them. We find it interesting around here. Believe<br/>
me, my kids would sound the gong if something wasn&#39;t interesting to them<br/>
and I&#39;ve given up &quot;forced learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What does &quot;not natural&quot; mean? Eating with a fork is not natural but kids<br/>
pick it up through modeling. We don&#39;t need fork lessons ;-)<br/>
[Valerie Cifuentes] Actually, my children did get fork lessons! Well, I<br/>
would just show them how to hold it. My son, until recently &quot;scooped&quot;<br/>
and held his elbow way out. His sister didn&#39;t appreciate the whacking!<br/>
So, I INSISTED that he hold his fork correctly to prevent the whacking.<br/>
He did. He wasn&#39;t one to really care.<br/>
Also, he didn&#39;t like sitting up at the table. He would stoop over. it&#39;s<br/>
comical really! But I insist that he sit up and straight with good<br/>
posture. <br/>

Communicating through speech may be natural, but English isn&#39;t. Wearing<br/>

 I read the rest, but didn&#39;t respond. I like what you&#39;ve written and<br/>
your pleasant <br/>
Thank you! I&#39;ve gotta go!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, English is not a particularly regular language. But kids learn to<br/>
speak<br/>
it without English lessons. Is learning to spell through and though and<br/>
thought any different than picking up how to conjugate &quot;to be&quot;? Kids may<br/>
stumble over conjugations when they become unconsciously aware of the<br/>
pattern (like reverting to &quot;he runned&quot;) but do they need lessons to<br/>
learn<br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I really detest the &quot;whole language&quot; approach to spelling.<br/>
&gt; My children picked up on writing very easily and happily as they wrote<br/>
&gt; to their grandparents, friends or &quot;Rule&#39;s for my Bedroom!&quot; LOL! And<br/>
&gt; knowing how to break down syllables and knowing the rules with each<br/>
&gt; syllable. They were happy to not to have to ask for help in their<br/>
&gt; spelling as often and got a huge feeling of independence from it. That<br/>
&gt; was my observation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And my daughter too picked up writing easily doing all the same things<br/>
except the syllables. (Though she has a vague concept of them from<br/>
writing<br/>
comic books and having to split lots of words to fit into the balloons<br/>
she<br/>
insists on drawing first ;-) Her spelling is still occasionally creative<br/>
at<br/>
10 but it&#39;s vastly improved to what she used at 9. She&#39;s never had a<br/>
spelling lesson and doesn&#39;t seem irritated at asking for spellings. To<br/>
her<br/>
spelling is a big messy interesting puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
Which is just saying that lessons weren&#39;t necessary for it to come<br/>
about.<br/>
There are pros and cons to lessons and no lessons, but lessons are not<br/>
necessary. For me at least two of the pros are her realizing she&#39;s<br/>
puzzled<br/>
out the intricacies of the English language without being taught, the<br/>
freedom to do other things during what would have been lesson time. The<br/>
cons<br/>
are getting spelling later than some other kids. (But not all kids. Some<br/>
people never do learn to spell even with &quot;expert&quot; instruction.) Which is<br/>
only a problem if she is faced with some sort of comparison but that&#39;s<br/>
never<br/>
happened so it&#39;s no big deal.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; son would get frustrated if he knew the word was spelled wrong but<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t know the correct spelling. Now he has a method that works.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are advantages to teaching. But there are also trade offs. I think<br/>
Pam<br/>
does this really well and my daughter wants to do stuff so I&#39;ll let<br/>
someone<br/>
else handle this one. (Or I&#39;ll get back to it.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I like to use the Writing Road to Reading, there are no workbooks, but<br/>
&gt; the child develops a notebook on their own as they go along. It&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; pleasant pace and there are NO workpages or LESSONS. Only steps that<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i before e except after c, type thing.<br/>
&gt; How do you handle spelling?<br/>
&gt; Thank you for letting me share! :o)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do pass on rules when she asks about a word that the rule applies to.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just that I see a great deal more happening, not just with<br/>
spelling,<br/>
but everything, as my daughter writes for her own pleasure and discovers<br/>
spelling on her own. It&#39;s more than about acquiring spelling rules.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve really got to go. I&#39;m really sorry this isn&#39;t as thorough as I<br/>
could be.<br/>

<br/>
They were borrowed, without much change, from other languages - in the<br/>

now part of our language. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They taught them the language, or they taught them academics using their<br/>
native language? There&#39;s a big difference. The whole ebonics controversy<br/>
in Oakland centered on labeling who spoke AAVE as ESL/BLE (English as a<br/>
Second Language/Bi-Lingual Education) students, which allowed them to get<br/>
federal funding for programs that allow them to be taught in AAVE (much<br/>
as monolingual Spanish-speaking children are sometimes taught academics<br/>
in Spanish while they learn English).<br/>
<br/>
The thinking is not so much not to interfere with their &quot;native tongue&quot;,<br/>
but to ensure that they are actually learning, rather than just being<br/>
&quot;immersed&quot; in a langauge they don&#39;t understand. Becoming truly English<br/>
proficient often takes years, even for children. Good bi-lingual<br/>
education classes result in children who are learning new things, as well<br/>
as learning another language. My personal opinion is that AAVE is a<br/>
dialect, not a language, so BLE classes aren&#39;t necessary - but it&#39;s an<br/>
interesting thought.<br/>
<br/>
From an unschooling perspective, an ESL class is somewhat analogous to<br/>
taking a young child who wants to learn about, say, genetics, and giving<br/>
him some standard college textbooks on it, and maybe having him attend<br/>
some lectures. He is &quot;immersed&quot;, but he doesn&#39;t understand what&#39;s going<br/>
on, what it&#39;s all about, and he won&#39;t understand a lot of it for a long<br/>
time....A BLE class, as it&#39;s supposed to work, includes a teacher who can<br/>
&quot;translate&quot; the book for him, put it into words he can understand, help<br/>
him read the text or else read it herself and share the information.<br/>
<br/>
This may be stretching it a bit. ;-) I&#39;m trying to be relevant but I love<br/>
this topic...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660602393">**&lt;&lt; So who gets to judge what is moral and good for your kids to read?<br/>
You?  Them?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In our family, the kids can read what they want.<br/>
In schools, since most kids who are reading are reading on the sly under<br/>
the<br/>
desk anyway, they can read what they want if they don&#39;t get caught. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My point wasn&#39;t about the morality, but about the lack of judgement<br/>
about<br/>
content in someone who says &quot;reading is good&quot; while saying &quot;other input<br/>
is<br/>
not as good.&quot;**<br/>
<br/>
I still think Bridget&#39;s question about whether or not to censor reading<br/>
is one that&#39;s worth discussing.<br/>

Also, do people feel differently about censoring TV/video images than<br/>
they do about censoring reading choices?<br/>

It got here.  I wondered how someone who had grown up in the U.S. and was <br/>
smart enough to take something to the post office to mail it could TOTALLY <br/>
mis-address (as to format, I mean) a package! <br/>
<br/>
But my dad could not carry a tune whatsoever, and it wasn&#39;t for lack of <br/>
opportunity, nor for lack of hearing music, nor for lack of genetic <br/>
opportunity.  His parents could sing.  His brother was a music director at a <br/>
church.  My sister and I can sing.  My dad could not sing.<br/>
<br/>
That guy had seen lots of packages, no doubt, but somehow did not process <br/>
where on a box the address should go.  I&#39;m sure he went to public school and <br/>
was &quot;taught a rule,&quot; too.<br/>
<br/>
Rules are overrated.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Many children read wonderfully, but spelling is a different<br/>
matter entirely. Spelling is  much more difficult to learn and I believe<br/>
more time consuming. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And less important!  There&#39;s no reason for it to be learned in two years <br/>
instead of over twenty years.  What&#39;s the big rush?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Spelling is a different matter, also, words that were unusual and had<br/>
many syllables were very hard to read correctly.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not for everyone.  Holly, who&#39;s a fearful reader, read &quot;responsibilities&quot; the <br/>
other day, because it made sense in the context of what she was reading and <br/>
she knows the word already.  Learning to read before one has a large <br/>
vocabulary might be part of the whole reading problem in schools.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Like my last name,<br/>
Cifuentes  VERY FEW adults can read my last name correctly and usually<br/>
add a &quot;qu&quot; sound where the &quot;f&quot; is.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But no English phonics rules will help one bit.<br/>
I could read it, but I grew up in a 70% Hispanic area, surrounded by <br/>
Ceballeses and Maldonados and Maestases and Abeytas and lots and LOTS of <br/>
Trujillos and Martinezes.  Fresquez and Gonzales were easy reading for us <br/>
early on.  Not because of English rules, but from recognition and repetition.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But the whole point of my writing this is about SPELLLING. I still<br/>
haven&#39;t heard more on SPELLING that makes sense. Remember, there seems<br/>
to be an agreement here that folks that need a bit of walking through<br/>
and clicking with the idea slowly get that chance. Can&#39;t my questions be<br/>
simply answered as to a method when it comes to SPELLING?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think what people are saying is that unschooled kids can and do learn to <br/>
spell well without a method.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Back to my original question, then how do they learn SPELLING RULES that<br/>
will help them SPELL?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They learn rules gradually, if at all, and if they don&#39;t need help spelling, <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t have needed the rules anyway.  Some people don&#39;t know the rules <br/>
and spell well.  Some people passed many tests in school on the rules, and <br/>
yet don&#39;t spell well.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There are lots of complex historical reasons that the same word became<br/>
&quot;kirk&quot; in Scotland.  But the fact remains that kids learn to pronounce things<br/>
in their native dialect (and other dialects later, in many cases) and then<br/>
to spell in standard ways by various means. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;My concern is with the ENGLISH language. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They speak English in Scotland.<br/>
So what is your spelling-rules explanation for the pronunciation of &quot;church&quot;? <br/>
And is it going to tie into the history of the word and the splitting off of <br/>
the major medieval English dialects to account for &quot;kirk&quot; (a variant of the <br/>
same word)?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Didn&#39;t you ever look at something and say &quot;Oh! Now I get it, I<br/>
wish I&#39;d known that a while ago!&quot; Same thing...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sure.  Do you think you can teach them every thing that they might want to <br/>
know ten years hence?  In so doing, might you not teach them a few thousand <br/>
things they do NOT want to know and might never need?<br/>
<br/>
WHEN they need it is the time to learn it.  That&#39;s what unschooling&#39;s about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704267643"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; I was reading this and I wondered something too, what about<br/>
&gt; spelling? I<br/>
&gt; &gt; liked my children to learn spelling rules. Spelling is proven to NOT<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; natural and I really detest the &quot;whole language&quot; approach to<br/>
&gt; spelling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I, for one, am a very good speller and I believe that has come from being a<br/>
voracious reader my whole life and constantly *seeing* the words in the context of<br/>
whole language, *not* from taking a zillion spelling tests and learning &quot;spelling<br/>
rules&quot; in school.<br/>
If I&#39;m unsure of how to spell a certain word, I&#39;ll sometimes write it down two<br/>
different ways and go with the spelling that looks right and familiar to me, and I&#39;m<br/>
usually right.<br/>
Spelling rules (like &quot;i before e except after c&quot;) seem to have so many exceptions<br/>
that they aren&#39;t all that useful anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm.  I always thought phonics, while helpful in puzzling out new reading words, was detrimental when it came to spelling.<br/>
(I&#39;m thinking of those t-shirts that say something like &quot;hukt on fonix werkt fer me.&quot;)<br/>
When my eight year old (who is a very good reader) writes me a note he writes completely phonetically which leads to poor spelling... for example he might write something like &quot;wuts for dinr?&quot;<br/>
We recently played a game where I made a list of words in two columns with one spelled correctly and one spelled incorrectly, and he guessed which was right.<br/>
He guessed something like 10 out of 12 correctly.  We did this following a conversation about spelling and the fact that it becomes easier the more experience you have with what correctly spelled words look like.<br/>
I have no doubt that he eventually will spell just fine without reading lessons or &quot;programs.&quot;<br/>
