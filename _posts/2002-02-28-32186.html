<div id="ygrps-yiv-836497124">Well, here I sit on my high horse, and as<br/>
<br/>
-a &quot;born-in-Canada&quot; (Ottawa, precisely) person<br/>
-of primarily British descent (who fondly remembers a cockney granny who&#39;d be<br/>
112 this year),<br/>
-who worked and studied acting in New York for three years;<br/>
-who took a bunch of linguistics courses as an undergraduate in Toronto,<br/>
-who got another degree in education and certification as an English and Drama<br/>
teacher (eeeuww!!),<br/>
-who then lived in B.C. for five years,<br/>
-who followed that with six years in Kitchener (in the dreaded &quot;area relatively<br/>
close to Toronto&quot;),<br/>
-is now living in Toronto again (for a running lifetime total, so far, of about<br/>
fifteen years),<br/>
-with an American husband who hails from South Dakota,<br/>
-and who rarely, if ever, says &quot;eh?&quot; at the end of an utterance<br/>
<br/>
I feel both obliged and qualified to jump defensively into this fray.<br/>
<br/>

Tia, you  wrote from the wet coast<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And I should add that I sound pretty much like all the born-in-Canada<br/>
&gt; people who live around me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>which made me giggle, because west coast raised folks sound like Californians to<br/>
me, too.  Before we lived there, I assumed that it was simply because all of my<br/>
friends&#39; kids had at least one parent (and grandparent) from California.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I ask because I&#39;ve run across this attitude (which I find quite amusing,<br/>
&gt; no I don&#39;t take it to heart) in the area relative close to Toronto,<br/>
&gt; Oakville to be exact. Mostly settled by the English and predominantly<br/>
&gt; still very much that way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know much about Oakville, but Toronto is one of the most culturally<br/>
diverse cities in the world.  Even little German settled Kitchener has growing<br/>
and largish Somalian and Portuguese communities, among others.<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Although, while in Canada recently, someone mentioned to me about<br/>
&gt; how THEIR dialect was correct because it was the closest to &#39;Oxford&#39;<br/>
&gt; english.. how silly eh? :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t say as how I&#39;ve run into this attitude much in this region any more than<br/>
any other, though I don&#39;t hang around the Tim Horton&#39;s in Oakville much, so I<br/>
may have missed something (insert &quot;all in good fun&quot; or &quot;just joshing&quot; emoticon<br/>
here).  And as Dona wrote, we have as many regional variants in Canada as do<br/>
y&#39;all south of the border.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not heard, either, of &quot;Oxford&quot; English being touted as superior, although<br/>
&quot;RP&quot;, Received Pronunciation, has been taught in British acting and broadcasting<br/>
schools as the &quot;standard&quot;, as has Standard American in the United States.<br/>
Actors here in Canada who haven&#39;t learned these standard forms  take classes to<br/>
improve their employability.  American movies require American accents.  No,<br/>
that&#39;s not true, sometimes they want folks to sound as if they might come from<br/>
Newfoundland, or have a trace of a Yiddish accent (and for that, Montreal or<br/>
Toronto can be as authentic as New York).<br/>
<br/>
I have met individuals in  places east and west, Canadian and American, who<br/>
believe that the way they talk is right, and who chuckle at the peculiar<br/>
linguistic ways of folks from other areas..<br/>
<br/>
I lived with someone from Waterbury, Connecticut once, who moaned every time a<br/>
British movie came on television.  He said he couldn&#39;t understand a word.   His<br/>
family (which emigrated from Italy when he was three years old) laughed at the<br/>
way I talked, too.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, an intelligent, well educated actor type carries with him from<br/>
childhood the traces of a belief that folks with English accents are a little<br/>
stuck up.  His ear isn&#39;t always quick to pick up class and regional differences<br/>
in those speakers.   My friends and I were raised in a hotbed of ex-pat Brits in<br/>
post-war Ottawa, even if our own parents were born in Canada, and our ears<br/>
absorbed all of those sounds.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s aunt, who was raised in South Dakota and settled into a teaching<br/>
career in Arkansas as a young woman, used to ask me to repeat things on the<br/>
telephone because I sounded so &quot;cute&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s my point? I don&#39;t even know, except that generalizations bug me<br/>
(insert &quot;I&#39;m being jolly, please don&#39;t think I&#39;m a mean person&quot; emoticon here).<br/>
I take immense joy in the diversity around me every day, even though I live in<br/>
southern Ontario. I enjoyed it even when I was actually working as an English<br/>
teacher.<br/>
<br/>
The only place I&#39;ve been pressured to change my dialect  was at acting school in<br/>
New York, where we were all required to learn and use Standard American.  And<br/>
everyone was tsked and chuckled at, no matter where on the continent they came<br/>
from, because we all had unfortunate regionalisms and defects ripe for rooting<br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
AND ANOTHER THING.......now I&#39;m on the wrong side of 45, I find that EVERYBODY<br/>
mumbles, and all recent movies and television shows have perverse sound<br/>
technicians who seem to be mixing the  voices farther and farther back, just to<br/>
make my life, and the life of all older people, more difficult.  To say nothing<br/>
of young whippersnapper actors whose entire characterizations seem to consist of<br/>
turning perfectly good text into mush and gobbledygook.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
Oh, geeze, namaste everybody and have a great day!<br/>

it was 70+ degrees.  Next morning the low temp was 26 degrees! - frigid for<br/>
us (first freeze we&#39;ve had this winter).<br/>
<br/>
The weird thing is, Spring starts here on February 1.  Nobody had winter<br/>
clothes out any more when the freeze hit!<br/>
<br/>
Today the high was in the 60s again, but a front is moving in and they say<br/>
we&#39;ll be in the 20s Sunday morning again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, yes actually it is.  Obviously, in your region the climate used <br/>
to be slightly different. People got used to putting there warm <br/>
clothes up in February and getting their spring stuff out.  The fact <br/>
that you can&#39;t rely on the weather to cooperate anymore IS a symptom <br/>
of global warming.  <br/>
I wish they would find a better word for it.  People seem to think <br/>
that it means every place on the planet will get warmer <br/>
simultaneously.  That&#39;s not what is happening.  The overall average <br/>
temperature is rising (and no reputable scientist says otherwise <br/>
anymore).  This is causing climate CHANGE.  Some areas may even get <br/>
cooler.  Some like Ohio will get less predictable but milder overall. <br/>
 Storm patterns will change.<br/>
And the problem is that some people cannot disassociate the debate <br/>
over WHETHER it is happening (even the Rebublicans are starting to <br/>
admit it) from the one about WHY it is happening.  And the majority of <br/>
average citizens don&#39;t understand a lot of what they read about it and <br/>
don&#39;t take the time to investigate it fully to understand.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sure your right, there is definite disagreement about the causes and the potential risks, of any human activity, that contributes to the effect, but there is no dispute, that global warming is a reality and that we&#39;re not certain of the implications. We feel/are relatively helpless and we&#39;re the ones who are responsible. I guess it&#39;s pretty hard to wrap your head around all that but I fall on the side of the environmentalists and the conservationists. I&#39;d like to see human life continue on this planet for ever and ever and ever....... <br/>

the earth.  NO scientist can say that acid rain, chemically polluted air and<br/>

<br/>
But did you read any of the information in the articles from National Geographic or Scientific American, two sources you have confidence in?. The choice to save our species is in our hands and if we all adopt your attitude we&#39;re destined to let a few short sighted industrialists destroy our ecosystem. Now that we&#39;re mothers, we can&#39;t in good conscience, let &quot;nature?&quot; take it&#39;s course!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-5568535">How in the world would you remove the impact of cities.  That is like saying<br/>
that you aren&#39;t going to count the frosting on a cupcake towards the<br/>
cupcake&#39;s calories.  the impact of a city is not limited to the space it<br/>
occupies.  Now that would really be called manipulating data to make the<br/>
statistics say what you want them to.<br/>
<br/>
And there isn&#39;t anything natural about industrial output or vehicle<br/>
emissions or nuclear testing or clear cutting forest or the miriad of other<br/>
things we do to the plant.<br/>
<br/>
The only way to let a &quot;natural&quot; cycle occur is to remove what is unnatural<br/>
and that would be all the garbage created by humankind.<br/>

mags because he reads most of them. (He reads those and technical <br/>
manuals like I read novels.)  He doesn&#39;t remember the last article he <br/>
read that purprted that global warming was a myth.  He thinks it was <br/>
in the mid 90&#39;s.<br/>
There was still a bit of doubt in the scientific circles about whether <br/>
or not there was warming a decade ago but in the last five years, <br/>
everyone, well the reputable scientists anyway have pretty much agreed <br/>
that it is happening.  Even some of the most vitriolic anti-global <br/>
warming voices have publically changed their tune.<br/>

WHETHER it is happening, just disagreement over WHY.<br/>

the satellite data.  However, the reason they don&#39;t do that anymore is <br/>
