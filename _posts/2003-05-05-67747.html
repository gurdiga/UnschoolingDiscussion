<div id="ygrps-yiv-127022029">As I have mentioned before I babysit my two year old nephew during the days. Today I saw a delightful event that <br/>
<br/>
reminded me why respectful parenting is so great. We are having another dump of snow. We thought it was spring <br/>
<br/>
but alas we were fooled. Anyway Noah saw it and wanted to go see it. He was in his pyjamas still and had on his <br/>
<br/>
runners and no coat. I immediately thought about dressing him up but realised he would if he wanted. He didn&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
want to so hopped out to the snow and delightfully walked up and down watching it go on his shoes and make <br/>
<br/>
patterns. He giggled and bounced the entire time. He had so much fun. When he was cold he came in. To think I <br/>
<br/>
could have clogged that all up with my wants.It was very inspiring to watch this person so fully enjoy the moment.<br/>

Maureen, I enjoyed reading about your nephew, Noah, going out in the snow.  <br/>
The rules this culture has about what to wear when are amazing.  Even in <br/>
laid-back parts of the English speaking world (not even thinking about <br/>
wealthy London/Boston/Virginia ancient rules of what to wear when, which <br/>
socks and what color) we have more crazy rules and restrictions passed down <br/>
that could even BEGIN to make sense.<br/>
<br/>
Marty left the house Sunday with a female acquaintance.  He was wearing <br/>
boots, canvas cargo pants, a long-sleeved t-shirt (heavy) with another <br/>
t-shirt over.  His friend was wearing nearly nothing.  Cropped tank top, <br/>
hip-hugger short-shorts.   It made an odd combo, but I didn&#39;t say a word, <br/>
because who knows, in New Mexico, in Spring.  They were both probably within <br/>
comfort-range.  I can&#39;t &quot;know&quot; what they need or should wear.  Now that my <br/>
youngest is eleven, I&#39;ll remind people about taking sun screen or a jacket <br/>
sometimes, but if I press I&#39;m often wrong, so since they&#39;ll need to be making <br/>
those decisions themselves long after I&#39;m gone, I just state my case, say <br/>
&quot;Whatever you want&quot; and try not to worry.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a big kid and teen, I would go out in the snow barefooted to get <br/>
the newspaper.  It was rolled up and stuck in a paper can (anyone from <br/>
northern New Mexico remember they bright yellow &quot;Santa Fe New Mexican&quot; <br/>
boxes?) about four steps from our back door.  My mom could never let it go <br/>
without a lecture.  It wasn&#39;t worth it.  <br/>
<br/>
So partly in memory of that one thing, I let my kids go out in snow however <br/>
they want to.  What I do when kids say &quot;We want to play in the snow!&quot; is I <br/>
look for gloves for them, and I build a fire and get some towels out.  If <br/>
they&#39;re still not in I&#39;ll heat water in case they want some hot chocolate.  <br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re going further from the house, I&#39;ll make more suggestions about <br/>
layers and such, but if it&#39;s in the yard, they could be nekkid (well, not <br/>
anymore) and I&#39;d just build them a fire.<br/>

absolutely nothing.  And he roared his protest when brought in for more<br/>
clothing.  He would have been about 15 months.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

  Too true Sandra.I hated hats and always had ear infections. I was always lectured about wearing a hat but hats never stopped the ear infections. Not drinking milk di though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Hear hear. I like the supportive idea. Took me awhile to let go of the old tapes and not do the I told you so but I am learning and it is so much nicer. I am so glad I was born with a gut that hurt when I am being unkind or unfair. <br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;If they&#39;re going further from the house, I&#39;ll make more suggestions about <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97149704">We must have mortified the neighborhood when we were kids, me and my <br/>
sibs. A big, heavy snow in nearly every circumstance, had us at least <br/>
once, going outside in our barefeet to race all the way around the <br/>
house. It was so much fun! stingingly cold to the feet, and <br/>
wonderfully stimulating.<br/>
<br/>
My kids continue in that tradition: running around the house at least <br/>
once, in the snow barefoot. Wonderful!<br/>

Oh!  This reminds me of my Nicholette.  Once, when she was just barely two, <br/>
I was downstairs folding laundry.  She had just finished with her bath and <br/>
my husband forgot a towel and sent her downstairs to get a warm towel from <br/>
me.  She walks in, freezing and shivering and says:<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I&#39;m so cold<br/>
Cold like the wind<br/>
Cold like the snow, burning my feet!<br/>
<br/>
My husband walked downstairs just about that time and we just sat there with <br/>
our mouths on the floor!  She was all of 26 months old!  I still feel amazed <br/>
when I think about that!  How true!  We were shocked to hear such a grown up <br/>
thought coming from such a tiny girl!<br/>
<br/>
Nic is still our &#39;drama queen&#39;.  She makes up poems and songs daily.  Not <br/>
too long ago, she made up a song about being so in love with her Daddy that <br/>
it hurt just to think about it.  LOL!  I&#39;d give anything to have written <br/>
that one down!  Something about seeing him and how the butterflies in her <br/>
tummy made her wiggle and giggle.  It was so cute!  She says she wants to be <br/>
a singer when she grows up.  I always hear famous singers talk about their <br/>
parents saying how they sang and made up songs from an early age, soooo <br/>
maybe we&#39;ll see Nicholette&#39;s name in lights someday! :)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, we have her &#39;first poem&#39; framed and dated on our living room wall.  It <br/>
is a wonderful reminder that my children are creative, expressive beings and <br/>
I still feel that same sense of amazement when I read it!<br/>
