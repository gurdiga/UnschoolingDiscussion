<h4>The Wolfe&#39;s</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770030850">I loved this article. Really makes you think. I guess I should introduce myself. My name is Mary Ellen and I live in snowy Ohio. I have 3 daughters, 20, 17 and 12. The 20yr. old and 17 yr. old have been granted a &quot;diploma&quot; and I am currently unschooling myself along with my 12 yr. old. The 17 yr. old is married and expecting my first grandchild in 2 weeks. My 2 older ones went to school until I pulled them out in 7th and 8th grades, but not before the damage was done, esp. to my oldest, but that is another story... My youngest went to kindergarten and half of 1rst grade. I love unschooling because it doesn&#39;t feel like learning, just enjoying life. But I can see that my daughter is learning new things constantly (as I am). I have enjoyed reading the &quot;what age children learn to read&quot; thread. I do not remember when my youngest learned to read. She is not really reading chapter books yet. She seems to mostly read books and magazine articles about things she is interested in at the time, like her pets(snake, hamsters, etc.) And she likes reading magazine articles. And when I lay down to take a nap in the afternoon, I always say, &quot;Honey, would you please read me a book? I just love the sound of your voice.&quot; And she happlily does. Oh, and she loves to read cookbooks and is becoming a wonderful cook. Well, that&#39;s enough for now. I really enjoy reading everyone&#39;s posts and the article posted about nerds. Great reading!<br/>
