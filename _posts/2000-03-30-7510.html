<div id="ygrps-yiv-13267009">I just wanted to apologize for the strange way my posts were sent - I <br/>
am having trouble with my mail.  When it doesn&#39;t go thru I try forwarding it <br/>
rather than rewriting!  But now I see that leads to a lot of stuff I don&#39;t <br/>
want.  Oh well, please bear with me while I teach this computer who&#39;s <br/>
smarter!  ha ha    jackie</div>
