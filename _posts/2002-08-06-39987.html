well, i think new orleans cause i lived there for a few years,,, <br/>
and i KNOW it is an unusual place.. <br/>
<br/>
i just think there needs to be more focus on mardi gras here in texas.. in galveston they&#39;ve got a big mardi gras thing going.. after all. .east texas is sorta the south.. here in central texas it&#39;s all FIESTA... so there is much ignoring of mardi gras..<br/>
<br/>
i do like the whole thing of the long mardi gras season, tho.. then there&#39;s less of a letdown after xmas/new year season... (well, i always took care of that with a january birthday..went from xmas to birthday season for me).. <br/>
<br/>
and as to different celebrations in different religions.. <br/>
one thing is that most religions have holidays at similar times of year.. they ALL go back to natural phenomenon.. solstice, equinox, new growing season, harvest time.. etc etc.....this is the way i like to celebrate holidays.. for their underlying beginnings as well as overlayed religious meanings.. <br/>

  ,&quot;.. would have to bring the next cake.. it&#39;s a whole strange new <br/>
  orleans thing.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
  No, actually it&#39;s a whole Southern thing. Mardi Gras actually has <br/>
  it&#39;s roots in Mobile (about 45 minutes from where I live) but New <br/>
  Orleans gets all the focus and people think it started there because <br/>
  it gets so insanely crazy over this holiday now.<br/>
  Here in Pensacola, you will find King&#39;s cake in every store come <br/>
  February, the typical purple, gold and green beads on people and <br/>
  yards get decorated right after the Christmas decor comes down.<br/>
  I love Mardi Gras here, we don&#39;t get the crazines of New Orleans, but <br/>
  it is a big deal. Many parades and events to attend come February. <br/>
  The kids love getting their moonpies (never knew what those were <br/>
  before moving here) and beads.<br/>
