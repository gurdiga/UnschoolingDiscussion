<div id="ygrps-yiv-813694492">I have not used my dryer for 7 years! I dry the unmentionables (underwear, bras) on a wooden tree in my bedroom.  Everything else goes outside on the line. DH just built me a nice big 50&#39; long laundry line with 4 wires, that&#39;s 200 feet of drying space!  So far, I&#39;ve not had to use all the space, but I most likely will in winter when it takes a longer time to dry clothes.<br/>
