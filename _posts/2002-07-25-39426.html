One girl reading fluently at 7 1/2 to 8.<br/>

Twins - one boy reading fluently at 6, one girl reading fluently at 10. Girl <br/>
struggled with reading, wanted desparately to read but had great difficulty, <br/>
boy picked it up seemingly effortlessly and didn&#39;t much care one way or the <br/>
other. The end result is that at 10 they have approximately the same reading <br/>
level.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Carol&#39;s kids have a set of twins in the middle.  Renee is the quickest of her <br/>
four kids.  ZIPPY--zippy to learn, quick talker, observant, quick to see <br/>
problems and solve them (especially logistical or social problems).   Liam is <br/>
Renee&#39;s twin brother.  But when they were born, Liam seemed possibly two <br/>
months younger than Renee.  She seemed full term and he seemed very preemie.<br/>
<br/>
He has caught up. &lt;&lt;g&gt;  Took over a dozen years, but he did.<br/>

Deborah, is that a possible parallel?  (maybe not at all)<br/>

<br/>
Some. :) Not the premie/full term bit though - they were born full term and <br/>
the same size, stayed the same size as each other all this time, never more <br/>
than a 1/2 inch difference in height and two pounds in weight right up until <br/>
this spring when Sarah went into that BIG puberty growth spurt. Oddly enough, <br/>
now that there&#39;s actually a significant size difference between them they&#39;ve <br/>
recently had several people notice that they&#39;re twins.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, back to topic. When they were younger it was a huge source of <br/>
frustration to Sarah how easily Patrick picked stuff up. He not only learned <br/>
to read without trying when she was the one who really really wanted to read, <br/>
he played with math for fun in his head while she had to slowly ponder <br/>
everything. And of course the only things people ever ask about are math and <br/>
reading. <br/>
<br/>
The first time she came up with the answer to a math problem they were both <br/>
contemplating before he did it shocked the heck out of everyone in the room. <br/>
(It was something for a game - adding scores maybe, or maybe it was a mileage <br/>
thing.) It doesn&#39;t happen often, but because they think in different ways <br/>
about math every so often her way works out faster than his does, even though <br/>
he&#39;s definitely both more interested in math and more accomplished at it. She <br/>
has definitely &quot;caught up&quot; - acheived competence at the kind of stuff that <br/>
comes up normally around here - the not coming up normally stuff he&#39;s <br/>
exploring all on his own without her though. <br/>
