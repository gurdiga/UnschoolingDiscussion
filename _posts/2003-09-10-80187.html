<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541041544">&lt;&lt;Just curious, how many of you don&#39;t limit quantity TV watching, but put limits on types of programming?  Would love to hear some varying opinions on that subject...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have never limited our boys television watching in any way.  They <br/>
can watch whatever they want, when they want, and they always have.  <br/>
We talk about everything we see on there, and have found it to be <br/>
invaluable for introducing topics of conversation which might <br/>
otherwise be awkward to introduce.  <br/>
<br/>
For instance, this week we watched that new Lifetime Movie, &quot;Sex and <br/>
the Single Mom.&quot;  We talked about the double standard, about how the <br/>
mom wanted to have sex but didn&#39;t think her daughter was responsible <br/>
enough.  <br/>
<br/>
We watch Fox News and talk incessantly about political topics, which <br/>
not only keep our kids informed about world events, but introduce <br/>
many conversations about right and wrong and about how that is a <br/>
matter of opinion, and who decides what is considered right?<br/>
<br/>
They also freely choose to watch the Discovery Channel a lot, or <br/>
National Geographic.  But they just as often choose MTV or a slasher <br/>
movie.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t worry about what they watch because:<br/>
<br/>
A.  I remember how much TV I watched as a child (which was a lot) and <br/>
how it didn&#39;t warp me, even though no one EVER discussed with me <br/>
anything I saw on TV.<br/>
<br/>
B.  We are always here to discuss with them anything that was in the <br/>
show that needs discussing, if they are concerned about it.<br/>
<br/>
They are smart kids, they can see right through the people who make <br/>
these shows.  They know what the agenda is, and can enjoy the show <br/>
for what it is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616523652">&lt;&lt;Just curious, how many of you don&#39;t limit quantity TV watching, but put limits on types of programming?  Would love to hear some varying opinions on that subject...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have never overtly limited types of programming, though I have been known not to put on a particular show when the kids were around (mostly violent shows since I know they are sensitive to that).  My kids seem to limit themselves all on their own.  Whenever we had an &quot;adult-type&quot; show on and the kids walked in, they would ask us to please change the channel.  When they turned on the TV and asked what was on, I would go through the kids programming channels and they would choose from those, nothing else interested them.<br/>
<br/>
I spend lots of time watching the shows with them so we can talk about them and I understand the characters etc. when they talk about their favourite shows.  I remember when my eldest was around 5 he asked to watch Power Rangers (I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still popular).  I had heard some negative things about it so I just made sure to watch it with him and we had a quick talk about the fighting scenes, how it was acting etc. and that was fine.  I remember explaining to his school principal (he was at school until grade 4) all the cool things my son was learning from watching Pokemon, which of course he had no clue since he didn&#39;t watch it, even though it was insanely popular with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I do remember that when I was first married and pregnant with my first child I swore to my husband as we were watching The Simpsons that no kid of mine was watching that show until he/she was 20!  LOL!!  He loves to remind about that now.  When my kids were younger they had never heard of the show, no interest, I didn&#39;t put it on etc. so it never came up as an issue but, because of the conversations on this list over the past year I&#39;ve been on it, I put The Simpsons on a couple of months ago while everyone was around and now the whole family is hooked!  We have satellite and a digital recorder so we get 4 or 5 new shows recorded every day.  My eldest walks around quoting entire scenes, we have so many interesting conversations based on tidbits from the shows, and it has lead to MANY connections.  For example, there was a show called &quot;Weekend at Mr. Burns&quot;, with a take on the movie &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#39;s&quot; which ended up being on a couple of days later so we watched it!  My husband and I will make very quick mentions of all the connections we see and the kids often pursue them.  My daughter is asking for full version of one of the songs they use pretty regularly on the show - Close To You (by The Carpenters I think).  I found an old Simpsons CD my husband had from before we were married and my daughter has claimed it now.  The kids think that The Simpsons writers are the greatest!  I also found out that J.K. Rowling is doing a show for the new season and we&#39;re all looking forward to that (another great connection with their love of Harry Potter).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have found my kids naturally limit themselves to their interests and whatever scare/thrill factor they can take. Pretty often my youngest, who&#39;s 6, will drag me out of the TV room to go do something else when a movie is on he doesn&#39;t want to watch, even if I do and he&#39;s welcome to stay (Lord of the Rings, Kangaroo Jack, and Chronicles of Narnia come to mind).  And I&#39;ve learned that if they&#39;re interested, they&#39;re learning something from it!<br/>

We don&#39;t limit much. Porn is off limits, as is gratuitous, realistic violence (&quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;American History X&quot; are examples of movies we deem inappropriate: The Sopranos would be a TV show in the &quot;forbidden&quot; category). Mind you, my kids have never asked to watch them, or that type of show. I don&#39;t like them watching MTV or what have you, because of the objectification of women, but I try hard not to censor that, and I have discussions with them about the inappropriateness of some of the videos. They seem to understand that my problem is not so much with the shows or videos themselves, rather the tendency to idolize the actors/ performers in them. I like Eminem, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s an appropriate role model for my children, kwim? <br/>

We don&#39;t limit either, my kids are pretty good at regulating themselves. I <br/>
really hate the argument that if you don&#39;t limit what kids watch they will go <br/>
all out and watch porn and violent movies all the time. That is so very untrue! <br/>
I don&#39;t know one young child who would do that, things like that don&#39;t <br/>
interest them. What six year old is going to want to watch things like that? Maybe it <br/>
might be an issue with older kids, but Sandra has said often enough that she <br/>
doesn&#39;t have problems with her boys doing that, and that if they do express <br/>
interest in sex related themes on the computer, TV, movies, magazines, books <br/>
that she has spoken with them that they respect others in the house and keep it <br/>
to themselves. How much more healthy can you get than that? I think that kids <br/>
watch TV programs and movies based on their interests. When mine were younger <br/>
they watched things like Barney (who I can&#39;t stand, but hey whatever! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;)Tellytubbies, Rollie Pollie Ollie, Out of the Box, Sesame Street... things like <br/>
that. Now they watch Disney movies, Sponge Bob, G Gundum (sp?), Moly likes some <br/>
of the &quot;teen&quot; Nick and &quot;teen&quot; Disney shows, that are really for preteens. <br/>
<br/>
If Darin and I want to watch a movie that we think may have things in it that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be appropriate for kids our kids ages, we wait until they are in <br/>
bed. Nuf said!! The other day I was watching a movie called Bobbie&#39;s Girl (I <br/>
think that is what it was called) about two lesbians and one had inherited her <br/>
nephew after his parents died, and then she discovered she had breast cancer. It <br/>
was a wonderful movie. Moly watched most of it with me. (she came in about 30 <br/>
minutes into it) She asked me all sorts of questions about what it means to be <br/>
a lesbian. I was so glad she saw this movie that portrayed women as a family <br/>
in such a light. There was no sex, there were some tender intimate moments. It <br/>
showed the women owning their own business, raising a child, dealing with <br/>
cancer, just like any other family. It didn&#39;t show lesbianism as just some <br/>
fantasy for men to get their kicks. I was so happy because Moly had lots of <br/>
questions. And I was glad that her first view of a family different from hers was <br/>
shown in such a way. So I don&#39;t limit, I watch with my kids, I talk to them, I <br/>
respect their emotional development and keep things I want to see for later. And <br/>
so far it has worked.<br/>
