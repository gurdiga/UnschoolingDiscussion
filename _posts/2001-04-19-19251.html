&lt;&lt; I know what you mean but I think the problem lies in defining ANYONE by <br/>
 how they earn their money.  It&#39;s one aspect of their lives but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
 have much to do with whether we&#39;ll have something important in common with <br/>
 the person (usually) and I wish we would get away from that being the most <br/>
 common first question when people meet (so what do you do...translation, how <br/>
 do you earn your money?)<br/>

lucky. I don&#39;t bring home the bacon so I don&#39;t really *DO anything. I have <br/>
had quite a few questions about what do you do all day. I actually have very <br/>
little &quot;time&quot; on my hands. Now my dd is telling people she is homeschooled <br/>
b/c they ask her what grade she is in. Then I get the &quot;that&#39;s great, I could <br/>
never do that.&quot; I just nod and smile. not worth expanding the conversation in <br/>
my opinion. I have learned to keep my opinions mostly to myself and my family <br/>
here b/c I don&#39;t have the energy to get into it. <br/>
<br/>
    Can you tell I nearly had a talk w/ the dental hygienist yesterday, very <br/>
fresh in my nerve fibers. It was about sending dd (not yet 5) to a specialist <br/>
in the near future for dental work and such. Then I received a propaganda <br/>
sheet from Crest. Enough! At least they didn&#39;t hound me about the NO FLUORIDE <br/>
emblazoned on her record sheet.<br/>
<br/>
    OK sorry I guess I did need to get into it. :o)<br/>

&lt;&lt; There&#39;s no special hygiene--showers or baths.  She doesn&#39;t need anything <br/>
up <br/>
 inside, unless she&#39;s using tampons.  But douche and like that?  No.  It&#39;s <br/>
not <br/>
 good.     &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Just wanted to add in that I wish when I was younger I had discovered <br/>
other forms of feminine products. Tampons are so bad for our bodies and pads <br/>
too b/c they are bleached to become white products and other reasons. Never <br/>
douche unless medically needed. I have a few sites I can send you if you&#39;d <br/>
like more info. I just now find it very important for other women to know <br/>
these facts. off my box now. :o)<br/>

telling us how to do it, right?<br/>
<br/>

could handle it or they couldn&#39;t live without the<br/>
two-income lifestyle. What they mean is they don&#39;t<br/>
WANT to, but they can&#39;t just say that, they have to<br/>
act like they have no choice.<br/>
<br/>
Though the exception, for me, was this woman I talked<br/>
to the other day. I saw her at the library with two<br/>
boys, who turned out to be 5 and 7. I thought it was<br/>
earlier than it was, school hours, so I asked her if<br/>
she homeschooled. She got really sad and talked to me<br/>
for a long time about how much she WANTS to<br/>
homeschool, how she feels SURE it&#39;s better for the<br/>
kids, but she&#39;s single now, and she&#39;s going to college<br/>
PLUS working at night. She says she knows she could<br/>
work at night and homeschool during the day, but she<br/>
feels that getting herself a better education and job<br/>
will be better for them in the long run than if she<br/>
homeschools them while working at her minimum wage<br/>
job. I felt really bad, because I hadn&#39;t meant to make<br/>
her feel guilty. I mean, she wasn&#39;t making excuses, I<br/>
could tell she&#39;d thought about it and just made this<br/>
decision instead, and I respect that. She says she<br/>
hope to marry again someday, and then maybe she&#39;d<br/>
homeschool. I told her that&#39;s just what happened with<br/>
me, that my kids went to a couple years of PS when I<br/>
was divorced, but then I married my dh and we decided<br/>
to homeschool. She looked happy, like she was relieved<br/>
she wasn&#39;t being too greedy to hope for a dh who would<br/>
be willing to earn the money so his wife could<br/>
homeschool his stepkids. And his kids, if that<br/>
happened. <br/>
<br/>
What do you guys say when someone wants badly to<br/>
homeschool, but it really does seem to you like they<br/>
can&#39;t because of their life situation?<br/>
