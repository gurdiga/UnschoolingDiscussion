<div id="ygrps-yiv-437389072">If they let you rent DVDs for free, that is if you have a DVD player <br/>
these are great.  They all most all have this wonderful commentary <br/>
about the move.  We love to see where and how the move was done.  <br/>
Very educational.  Kevin Costner in Dances With Wolves goes through <br/>
the entire move with commentary, do not try to watch the movie and <br/>
this all in one day! :)<br/>
