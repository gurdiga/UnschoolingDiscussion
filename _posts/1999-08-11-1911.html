 </span></blockquote>Somebody from NY can help you with those specific regs,  but people <br/>
manage to unschool in every state and work it into their <br/>
regulations.  I think the key in your paragraph above is - with his <br/>
input - what does he want to learn?  When he&#39;s learned as much as he <br/>
wants to on that subject,  will he be free to move on to another?<br/>
<br/>
Also,  one topic you&#39;ll come across is deschooling.  Kids who have <br/>
been in ps or homeschooled in a very traditional manner often need <br/>
some deschooling time in the switch to unschooling.   It might take <br/>
quite awhile with a child that&#39;s been in school as long as your son.  <br/>
This is unstructured time intended to reawaken his own curiousity and <br/>
desire to learn.  Some kids watch lots of tv and play lots of video <br/>
games.  Others stare into space or sleep.  Most of them worry their parents <br/>
(who also have to deschool) who think that they&#39;ll never do anything <br/>
constructive again.  Then, one day,  they ask to go to the library or the <br/>
bookstore,  or they get on the internet and while you stand there <br/>
with your mouth hanging open,  they amaze you with their new desire <br/>
to learn.  They might even amaze you with what information they <br/>
processed while it appeared they were doing nothing.  It&#39;s a time <br/>
that requires lots of patience,  but it comes with a big pay-off.<br/>
It&#39;s so wonderful to witness that joy of learning return.<br/>
My kids were so schooled that I had to continually reassure them and <br/>
myself that this would work.  Now,  my 13 year old wouldn&#39;t have it <br/>
any other way.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that everything is educational.  My son still watches tv.  <br/>
We have no time restrictions on tv or video games.  What I have seen <br/>
change is what he chooses to watch and play.  He doesn&#39;t need<br/>
&quot;escape &quot; time  so much anymore, so he&#39;s just as likely to pick an <br/>
&quot;educational&quot; show as he is a sitcom,  or to play an &quot;educational&quot; <br/>
game on the computer.   We don&#39;t make these &quot;educational&quot; <br/>
distinctions at our house anymore.  Everything is input,  and with <br/>
that freedom, my son has become much choosier.<br/>
<br/>
I&quot;ve rambled long enough - hope this helps.<br/>

Thanks for the book titles. I just ordered them from my local independent<br/>
bookstore.<br/>
Our biggest concern is how develop a lesson plan that is challenging,<br/>
interesting and well rounded for our 14 year old, (with his input), while<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well,  Brian,  everyone here seems to agree that Grace Llewelen&#39;s (sp?)<br/>
&gt; Teenage Liberation Handbook is top notch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like her book _Real Lives_ also.  It&#39;s personal accounts of how<br/>
teenage unschoolers spend their days.  I took my daughter out of<br/>
school at 15 and have never regretted it.  She&#39;s 19 now and in<br/>
college and I have a 13 year old son unschooling.  What would you<br/>
like to know?<br/>
