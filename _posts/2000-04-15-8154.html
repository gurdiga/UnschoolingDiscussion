That is pretty amazing! What a coincidence. We must have both been<br/>
experiencing the &quot;birthday boy is growing up too fast&quot; blues that day! What<br/>
time was he born? Mine was born at 9:30 PM (EST). I would love to know if<br/>
they have any common interests or personality traits. Drop me a line if you<br/>
can. Maybe they could send each other a postcard (or an email card). Oh,<br/>
and Happy Birthday to him too!<br/>
