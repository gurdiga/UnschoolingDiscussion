<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628300897">I agree with what Tracy said (I think it was tracy) It depends on <br/>
what the book actually covers.  When I first started h/s I found that <br/>
most of the books in the local library where targeted at the younger <br/>
child - my dd was 11yrs old when we started h/s  (moving on to <br/>
unschool.)  I would have loved a book telling ME about deschooling, <br/>
what to expect, how to motivate, what to do. I couldnt realate to the <br/>
other books. Even now I wish I had a book that I could read and re-<br/>
read, some thing that would boost moral.<br/>
I did read *out of Eygpt (I think thats the name) it was a lovely <br/>
book - but it was about above average children - my dd is not above <br/>
average<br/>
Some one else suggested you publish it yourself.  I would imagine <br/>
this could be costly - but if you have the money, well worth looking <br/>
into.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>
