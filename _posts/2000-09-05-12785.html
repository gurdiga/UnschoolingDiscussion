<div id="ygrps-yiv-684833863">Hi Amy and Julie et. al.,<br/>
My girls are older now and can stay home by themselves, but my DH and I<br/>
still don&#39;t go on very many &#39;dates&#39;!  About the closest we get to a date is<br/>
going to the movie theatre and letting the girls see their own movie while<br/>
DH and I see ours!!!  I think the whole time my girls were little we left<br/>
them about 4 times with a sitter!  Our dates were much like Amy&#39;s, rushed<br/>
and conversation was only about the children!  They are 14 and 10 now!  But<br/>
I always liked being with my girls and I still do!!!  We did get a kind of a<br/>
break (I don&#39;t think it could be called a date) when we went looking for a<br/>
car!  They didn&#39;t want to go!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-26976893">over the yrs, we&#39;ve done the same thing ... if the kidlets couldn&#39;t go w/ us<br/>
someplace then we PROB didn&#39;t need to be going ... dh travels so much and<br/>
when he&#39;s home he *LOATHES* leaving the kids and so do I ... so, we&#39;ve just<br/>
always packed everyone up and taken them w/ us; no biggie ... and, after 24<br/>
yrs (married 28 yrs), it&#39;s worked and no regrets &lt;G&gt;<br/>
