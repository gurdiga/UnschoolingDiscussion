<div id="ygrps-yiv-181196498">I&#39;m new to this group, although not new to unschooling.  I have two <br/>
grown unschoolers.  I have an almost 5-year-old that I would love to <br/>
homeschool in the unschooling way, but I&#39;m a single mom and I have a <br/>
job that I love now.  So, I&#39;ve been thinking about starting <br/>
an &quot;unschool&quot; for my son and other children whose parents would like <br/>
to homeschool, but cannot do so on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else tried to do this?  Sudbury Valley Schools seem to be <br/>
the closest, but I don&#39;t want to do anything that big and there are <br/>
none in my area.  I just want to create an unschooling community <br/>
learning center for a small number of children.  <br/>
<br/>
If you have any suggestions, ideas, or warnings for me, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Sue</div>
