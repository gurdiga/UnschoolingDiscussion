<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047970119">When I was around 8yo I was playing with matches and toothpicks, <br/>
seeing how close they could get before igniting.  I was alone in our <br/>
basement/playroom because I was forbidden to play with matches. <br/>
After blowing them out, I threw them away.  Of course, one wasn&#39;t <br/>
fully out and started a fire in the trash can.  I ran straight for a <br/>
bucket of water, put it out, and went upstairs after I stopped <br/>
shaking enough and &quot;confessed&quot; to my parents. They had no idea, and <br/>
were quite shocked as I rarely disoebeyed, and that scary experiment <br/>
gave even more weight to the &quot;Mom&#39;s always right. She has more <br/>
experience and knows what she&#39;s talking about.&quot; tape that played in <br/>
my head for too many years.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, my 12yo has been allowed to experiment with fire, legal <br/>
fireworks, and such with our supervision from a younger age than I <br/>
was comfortable. DH was happy to participate and guide him in those <br/>
endeavors! I was so amazed when DS and his friend figured out how to <br/>
start fires with magnifying glasses on a camping trip. I had never <br/>
seen or done that as a child so I was just as excited as the kids! <br/>
<br/>
When we were at a local park, not long after that camping trip, a <br/>
woman came up to us and asked if we had any matches. She was with a <br/>
big group of people who had a whole picnic set up, but no one had <br/>
matches to start the grill. I said, &quot;No, sorry.&quot; Then I <br/>
remembered, &quot;But we do have a magnifying glass.&quot;  She looked at me <br/>
like I had three heads and said, &quot;So?&quot; I pulled it out of my <br/>
backpack, gave it to my son and told him to go and help them start <br/>
their fire. He and his friend went, and were back in a few minutes <br/>
with huge grins on their faces. That was one of my favorite <br/>
unschooling/thinking outside the box moments.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I guess I just wanted to agree with everyone who is saying <br/>
that forbidding things from children obviously doesn&#39;t protect them <br/>
from whatever it is. Information, experience appropriate to that <br/>
child&#39;s age, personality, tempermant is much better insurance in my <br/>
mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533114801">My 3yo DD likes to watch matches burn.  During the Winter we sat in the <br/>
bathroom (tile floor - no rug) and I&#39;d strike the match for her.  She&#39;d <br/>
take it from me, watch it burn, the blow it out.  Then she&#39;d put it in <br/>
the toilet.  We went through a couple books of matches over 2 or 3 days <br/>
and then she pretty much lost interest. Every once in a while -- if she <br/>
sees me lighting a candle -- she&#39;ll want to do a few, but (because she <br/>
CAN) it&#39;s not so exciting any more.  :)<br/>
