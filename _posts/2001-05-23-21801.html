<div id="ygrps-yiv-750280227"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Since it wasn&#39;t made &quot;honestly,&quot; I sent the reply I did.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From the responses from several &quot;experts&quot; about Indians, you are correct,<br/>
there is &quot;a long history of intentional blindness that some don&#39;t recognize<br/>
as being alive and well.&quot;  This thread has clearly demonstrated that.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Honest **representation** was what I mean in the first place.<br/>
Not that you knew me from Adam.<br/>
Not that you inquired before you put on your show.<br/>
I didn&#39;t represent myself as someone who knows Indian life, either, but as<br/>
someone<br/>
who appreciated many of the things you had said in the post that I popped in<br/>
on. I felt<br/>
that it was timely that I had watched the movie just before reading it. I<br/>
later expressed<br/>
my own heritage as a way of saying that I wasn&#39;t attempting to insult anyone<br/>
else&#39;s by<br/>
enjoying the movie...which is what I had felt you were accusing me of and<br/>
THEN addressed.<br/>
<br/>
*I* have been honest in my representations of myself, and of my thoughts<br/>
on this subject. That the making of the movie wasn&#39;t as simple as I first<br/>
believed...fine. I&#39;m usually THRILLED for further information.<br/>
But...<br/>
There are things just as important than information...which as an Unschooler<br/>
I<br/>
try to teach my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Some people just pick arguments without hesitation for the sake of doing so.<br/>
That&#39;s pretty blind.<br/>
