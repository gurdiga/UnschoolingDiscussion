<div id="ygrps-yiv-858912165">Greetings, all,<br/>
<br/>
I received the below post this morning and have not been able to think about<br/>
much of anything else all day.  With permission I am sending it to several<br/>
lists (please forgive any duplication from this) in an effort to find<br/>
Kimberly some much needed support.<br/>
<br/>
If a support group exists (even online) that would be wonderful.  But if you<br/>
are a mom with similar experience, I&#39;m sure it would help Kimberly a lot if<br/>
you contact her directly, too.  Her email address is  &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kilogg@...">kilogg@...</a>&gt;.  If<br/>
you could just send me a brief personal note to let me know that you are<br/>
corresponding with Kimberly I might rest a bit easier, too.  Thank you for<br/>
any help and comfort you may provide.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Linda<br/>

---------------------------------------<br/>
my name is kimberly loggins-marshall (from torrance,ca). i<br/>
spoke with you via telephone a few months back. i was pregnant with my now<br/>
deceased baby girl, &quot;audrey sinclare marshall&quot;. she was born healthy on feb<br/>
6th 2000. then, she died unexpectedly in my arms and at my breast on march<br/>
6th 2000. i have a surviving son name &quot;avery&quot;. he is three and a half years<br/>
old. as you can imagine, it has been difficult to homeschool and grieve at<br/>
the same time. our family and friends have simply &quot;disappeared&quot;. i have<br/>
managed to take avery to a few parks in our area so that he can play with<br/>
other kids. when the kids parents find out that i have a deceased child/or<br/>
when they see my apparent sadness - they to; disappear! a lot of kids at the<br/>
<br/>
parks (just as they do in preschools) have clicks. they leave other children<br/>
<br/>
OUT of their play activity. they do not allow other kids to play with. it is<br/>
<br/>
sad to see how small children are learning how to be mean and unaccepting at<br/>
<br/>
a very young age. my son is very outgoing and friendly. not a shy bone in<br/>
his little body. he accepts everyone as long as they are not harmful toward<br/>
him. lately, he has not wanted to frequent the parks. today i asked him if<br/>
he wanted to go to the park; he replied, &quot;no, the kids are not going to play<br/>
<br/>
with me anyway&quot;. he has since created this imaginary friend name jim/jack.<br/>
this friend is his age and very smart :) my heart aches not only for my<br/>
deceased daughter, but for my living son as well. do you know of any other<br/>
bereaved parents who are also homeschooling their children? i belong to a<br/>
few support groups but no one is homeschooling their children. neither do<br/>
they have any kids averys age. i am eager to continue with the homeschooling<br/>
<br/>
process. it is important for me to see my son interact with other children<br/>
with the similar values and unbringing. and of course race does not matter<br/>
with us. i have noticed that it does for some cultures. ---snip--- if you<br/>
have any<br/>
ideas, please let me know or keep me posted. :)</div>
