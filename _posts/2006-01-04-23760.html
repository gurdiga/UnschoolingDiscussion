<div id="ygrps-yiv-174417967">Sandra since this is unschooling related I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s okey to <br/>
post this here, so far it&#39;s only been talked about on the <br/>
unschooling rescources group but I think we&#39;re ready to start <br/>
looking for more members to get the group going. <br/>
   I am trying to develop some sort of &quot;call list&quot; for the children <br/>
of people who are on unschooling lists where the kids can use Skype <br/>
to talk to each other FREE over the computers (Especially valuable <br/>
for younger kids who don&#39;t type well yet and if you&#39;re anything like <br/>
us are having a hard time finding likeminded playmates who arn&#39;t <br/>
stuck in School mode all the time) All it takes is for Skype to be<br/>
downloaded on the computer (free) and that they have available<br/>
headsets w/microphones (or just speakers and a microphone will also <br/>
work.) <br/>
    Don&#39;t get me wrong - I know &quot;socialization&quot; is overrated but I <br/>
think my son would enjoy talking with other kids more often than he <br/>
gets a chance to now. For those of you not familiar with Skype it is <br/>
kindof a cross between MSN messenger and a phone, they can make <br/>
lists of people on their call lists and can choose to be not <br/>
available or offline anytime. So they know when others are online or <br/>
they could post a message on the yahoo group (with or without <br/>
parents help) that someone is available or a new kid would like to <br/>
make some friends. <br/>
    Of course we (parents) could talk using it<br/>
occasionally as well and should each be responsible for moderating <br/>
our own child&#39;s activity! Anyhow here is the link for the yahoo <br/>
group:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Freeschoolingkidsnetwork">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Freeschoolingkidsnetwork</a><br/>
and you will also need to download www.skype.com (owned by ebay)<br/>
There is also a chatroom available for people who want to use it <br/>
instead. <br/>
    Lots to think about as we&#39;re just getting started but if you <br/>
have a kid who would like to talk with other kids then please join. <br/>
