<div id="ygrps-yiv-795375043">When my third son wanted to go to school I told him we&#39;d &quot;do school&quot; at home <br/>
first to see if it was what he really wanted.<br/>
I got out some workbooks and had him sit at the table. He started to get up <br/>
and I asked what he was doing and he said he needed a drink. I told him he <br/>
would have to wait three more hours, until lunch. So he sat back down. Then he <br/>
started to get up again and I asked what he was doing. He said he had to go to <br/>
the bathroom. I told him he&#39;d have to sit down and wait his turn, because there <br/>
was already one child in the bathroom. This lasted about 15 min. and no one <br/>
has ever asked to go to school again.<br/>
 I think school is horrid. I think it&#39;s a place set up to provide day care <br/>
for a lot of kids and teach our children to roam in herds, not to be individuals.<br/>
My kids started equating college with regular PS , so we sat down and talked <br/>
about that. I told them that they will get a lot more out of college (if they <br/>
decide to go) than a lot of people. They won&#39;t go with the expectations thrown <br/>
on them that they have to get a degree, not only that but they have to be a <br/>
Dr., a lawyer, a whatever. My kids are putting some of their money into <br/>
savings, plus they get savings bonds for their b-days. Right now none of them want to <br/>
go to college and two of my boys want to use the money to open a business and <br/>
my oldest wants to travel the world. Most of the family is OK with this. The <br/>
one who isn&#39;t, is a grandpa who was a college Prof, but he&#39;s coming around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114680093">I&#39;ve considered doing this with my daughter, 4.5, and I&#39;ve heard of<br/>
lots of parents who have taken this approach.  In the end, I decided<br/>
it&#39;s too manipulative and have taken a different approach with her --<br/>
we&#39;ll try homeschooling for a while and if she doesn&#39;t like it and<br/>
still wants to try public school after a few years she can go (she has<br/>
put the number 16 on this -- &quot;Like when I&#39;m 16?&quot;).  <br/>
<br/>
She wants to go to school because her friends do.  Because she could<br/>
ride the bus.  Because it looks and sounds like fun.  Because teachers<br/>
on TV are usually awful nice (and in real life that&#39;s true, too). <br/>
Because in books and TV you see the fun interactions kids have in a<br/>
classroom and in the cafeteria.  And frankly, school can be fun. <br/>
There&#39;s a lot about it that I object to as a parent, and a lot she may<br/>
or may not dislike.  As a mom I&#39;ve decided she&#39;s too young to make<br/>
that decision yet, and I hate telling her know. But to sit her at the<br/>
table and say &quot;This is what school is like ... oh you don&#39;t like it? <br/>
OK&quot; in order to get her to say no seems like lying, because in truth,<br/>
she might find the negative things coupled with the positives not to<br/>
matter as much.  To draw a parallel, I dislike cutting clothing out of<br/>
patterns.  I dislike the entire process.  But I really enjoy sewing<br/>
and creating clothing for the kids, and I especially enjoy<br/>
embellishing them, so I start with the patterns and also do the fuss<br/>
work with hems and the like, because I enjoy it enough to make it<br/>
worth it.  She might like school enough that waiting for the bathroom<br/>
isn&#39;t so bad.  And until she gets to experience it, she&#39;ll probably<br/>
feel like she&#39;s missing out, at least until we build a stronger<br/>
homeschooling network (we&#39;re working on it!).  But if I&#39;m brainwashing<br/>
and manipulating her, IMO, I&#39;m not doing her any better service than<br/>
the schools I&#39;m keeping her from.  Does anybody have another angle on<br/>
this?  I&#39;m always glad to read about this topic as it&#39;s one we often<br/>
struggle with in our home.  <br/>
