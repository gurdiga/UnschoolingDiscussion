I love all the information you all have been sending!!! :  )  Please, keep it <br/>
coming: ) : )<br/>
<br/>
I am new at this veggie stuff and I am always interested in new ideas <br/>
ecspecially where food is concerned.  My hubby is a little on the <br/>
conservative side, but is willing to try things as long as they don&#39;t appear <br/>
&quot;wierd&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I am very interested in alternatives to mayo.  Thanks for the recipes, I <br/>
intend on trying the eggless one after my next trip to the healthfood store.  <br/>
My little one does not do to well with eggs either.<br/>
<br/>
I found a great tasting alternative to American cheese this weekend at the <br/>
grocery store.  It actually taste like cheese to me, the real taste will be <br/>
my daughter and hubby.  It is called Rice slice.  It didn&#39;t taste funky to me <br/>
at all. <br/>
Speaking of eggless, can someone tell me what kind of alternatives they use? <br/>
( For baking and eating).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681654891">A good egg substitute that you can purchase is called Ener-G egg replacer.<br/>
It&#39;s a powder and you add it with the required amount of water depending on<br/>
how many eggs the recipe calls for.<br/>
<br/>
Then you have Flax Eggs. Wonderful. Gives you omega3 oils on top of being<br/>
completely nutritious.<br/>
1/3 cup whole flax seeds<br/>
1 cup water.<br/>
<br/>
In a blender or food processor, blend the seeds to an even meal. Then slowly<br/>
add water while blending. Blend until mixture resembles a thick milkshake.<br/>
Transfer to a sealable container and store in the fridge (will keep for 3-6<br/>
days). If you like you can pour through a straner to remove the seeds. Makes<br/>
the equivalent of 6 eggs. Flax eggs are great for binders in pancakes,<br/>
breads, and other baking, but not to eat on their own. 3 Tablespoons of flax<br/>
eggs equals 1 egg.<br/>
<br/>
A note on the soy/rice cheeses. If you&#39;re looking for  vegan alternatives to<br/>
cheese, there are very few that do not contain casein, a milk derived<br/>
protein. If you have little ones that are sensitive to dairy, casein can<br/>
trigger the same reactions. SOYMAGE is a vegan cheese, as well as<br/>
VEGANRELLA. HOWEVER, when you&#39;re not eating cheese, you do not crave it.<br/>
These types of cheese are not meant to be consumed like dairy cheese. They<br/>
are meant to be used very sparingly. I use them rarely. Maybe a tiny bit<br/>
sprinkled VERY lightly on a veggie pizza every now and then, but I haven&#39;t<br/>
done that in a while. We just don&#39;t use them often.<br/>

Figuring out what triggers allergies has been one of my biggest parenting<br/>
challenges yet. My 4 year old&#39;s reaction to things is a rash all around her<br/>
mouth. She recieves no dairy or nuts (2 products that I know set her off)<br/>
and she still breaks out quite often. Sometimes the reaction is so delayed I<br/>
can never pinpoint the food. I am begining to suspect tomato products too.<br/>
She also is allergic to Huggies pull ups (which she needs for bed). Talk<br/>
about diaper rash! Most other brands she does o.k. with. I had to take her<br/>
out of cloth because she pees too much to hold it. My 2 yr. old has severe<br/>
allergies to nuts and eggs, but luckily seems to have outgrown her wheat and<br/>
dairy allergies. All 3 of my kids have asthma and very sensitive skin. It&#39;s<br/>
so hard to go out because we have to travel with at least one epi pen, 2<br/>
inhalers, and a nebulizer. Whew. Anyway you might want to check ou<br/>
www.fan.org for food allergy info. Sorry I rambled. Good Luck.<br/>
