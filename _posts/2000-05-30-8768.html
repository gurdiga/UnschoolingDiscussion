She LOVED Harry Potter and has read them many times.  I would love to find <br/>
similar type books as that is what she is into right now.  Also, please keep <br/>
in mind that she is extremely sensitive and does not want to read about <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-417380107">I was going to suggest Where the Red Fern Grows, until you mentioned the<br/>
sensitivity issue. Although, I too am extremly sensitive about animal rights<br/>
(which is why I&#39;m vegetarian) and it&#39;s still one of my favorites. You could<br/>
also try the Little House series. I&#39;m reading Red Fern right now and Little<br/>
house is next and my 7 yo loves them!<br/>

<br/>
Here are some recommendations from my 12 yo son:<br/>
<br/>
The Enchanted Forest Chronicles (quartet - Dealing with Dragons/Searching for <br/>
 Dragons etc.) by Patricia C. Wrede <br/>
<br/>
Minds Quartet (Of Two Minds and sequels) by Carol Matas<br/>
<br/>
The Castle in The Attic (and sequel) by Elizabeth Winthrop<br/>
<br/>
Narnia Chronicles by C. S. Lewis<br/>
<br/>
Fantasies by Edward Eager<br/>
<br/>
Also ones by E. Nesbit <br/>
<br/>
(the last 3 authors we&#39;ve been reading out loud from during the last year - <br/>
and both my 12 yo ds and very sensitive 8 yo dd have enjoyed them),<br/>
