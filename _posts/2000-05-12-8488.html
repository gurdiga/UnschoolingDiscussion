<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hello and welcome,</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">How you choose to educate your children is a 
question that will take some time to figure out for you.&nbsp; Most new 
homeschoolers are confused when they start looking at curriculum, methods, 
etc.!</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">How old are your kids?&nbsp; Have they been in 
public or private schools?&nbsp; Any learning problems?&nbsp; All of those 
things will have an effect on what you choose to do.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My oldest (12yo boy) is also interested in 
computers and electronics.&nbsp; These comprise the bulk of our 
&quot;curriculum&quot;.&nbsp; He also is heavily involved in 4-H and Awana.&nbsp; Those 
are the rest of our curriculum for him.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My daughter (10) loves horses and is going through 
a unit study on horses.&nbsp; She will do several days worth of &quot;study&quot; and then 
leave it alone for a while.&nbsp; She also is involved with 4-H, and 
Awana.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My youngest (7 1/2yo boy) loves to build 
things.&nbsp; He has pretty much free reign in the basement workshop, and can 
spend hours down there making some wonderful things.&nbsp; He is just learning 
to read, and I spend time with him reading when he is interested (about every 
other day).</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hope that gives you some idea of what one unschool 
&quot;looks&quot; like, but you will not two identical homes, so just try to find your own 
place.</font></div>
