&gt; There are other alternatives.  As Quakers, as a religious matter we<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t celebrate any holidays (or, more accurately, all days are holidays<br/>
&gt; as they hold equal promise for revealing the divine to us); as a<br/>
&gt; cultural matter, we are free to do as we choose.  We are very conscious,<br/>
&gt; however, of how important Christmas is to the people around us, and we<br/>
&gt; try hard to honor that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the problem I have with Christmas, that so many other people set such<br/>
store by it.  I&#39;m not dominant enough in our family to put my foot down and<br/>
say, look, we&#39;re just not doing that this year, because I know I&#39;d offend a<br/>
lot of my and my dh&#39;s family.  Your philosophy sounds great, to celebrate<br/>
whatever comes your way!  I sometimes don&#39;t feel like celebrating ANYTHING,<br/>
except surviving the day!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, does anyone have any insight on this?  I don&#39;t want, for so many<br/>
reasons, my children to go to school.  But I don&#39;t know if I get on well<br/>
enough with my eldest to do her justice by keeping her with me.  Of course,<br/>
I&#39;d be mortified with guilt of I did send her to school and something<br/>
happend, and I don&#39;t want to &#39;give up&#39; on her by giving up my beliefs on<br/>
school and education and life.  I can&#39;t seem, atm, to stop picking her up<br/>
for little stuff, not &#39;schooly&#39; stuff, behaviour, and some&#39;s real petty,<br/>
too.  Perhaps I&#39;m just PMS-ing, and I&#39;ll get better, but it seems unfair.<br/>
<br/>
Time to stop Rambling!<br/>
