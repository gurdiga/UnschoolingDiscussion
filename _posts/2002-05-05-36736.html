&lt;&lt; How many of you have unschooled through high school?  I&#39;d like to know how<br/>
you got across the higher maths and sciences... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I addressed the general question, but I need to mention the particular:  I <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;get across&quot; anything to my kids.  I&#39;m there while they get it <br/>
themselves.  It doesn&#39;t cross from me to them.  I might throw something out <br/>
on the table, into the air, but they pick it up themselves, turn it over, <br/>
make sense of it, and store it in themselves.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a gigantic difference, and this is one of those times that <br/>
terminology matters.<br/>
