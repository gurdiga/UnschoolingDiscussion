&gt; What about vouchers for homeschooling? If we are able to use them to<br/>
&gt; choose a public school and the government &quot;lets us&quot; home unschool why<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t we get our money and use it at home? Michele<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This question begs the better solution of separating the government from<br/>
education altogether so that money would not be taken by force from people<br/>
who do not use the schools. If we kept our own money, we could spend it for<br/>
our own children&#39;s education as we see best.  Wow, what a concept.<br/>
<br/>
In short -- because the teachers&#39; unions run the schools, and they know that<br/>
every dollar that goes to vouchers is less for them. Since the teachers&#39;<br/>
unions contribute heavily to the elections of school-supporting politicians,<br/>
the politicians hold the purse strings of tax money, and give every<br/>
advantage to those unions in return for their contributions. It&#39;s simple<br/>
bribery.<br/>
<br/>
A famous remark by Albert Shanker, the former head of the AFT (American<br/>
Federation of Teachers, the second largest teachers&#39; union) was, &quot;When<br/>
homeschoolers start paying teacher union dues, that&#39;s when this union will<br/>
start working for them.&quot;   (the quote might not be exact)<br/>
