 </span></blockquote>I have this exact situation with my three and a half year old.  Very long, <br/>
very curly, very tangly.  It&#39;s been a long process.  We wash about once a <br/>
week - just when both the kids get stinky.  then we glob on the conditioner <br/>
and let it sit.  Then we comb.  It used to be a screaming match.  I talk <br/>
calmly throughout.  telling her how it will break off in clumps if not combed <br/>
(we jhave a cat who mats and this illustrated the problem nicely), how <br/>
beautiful her hair is when it&#39;s combed, how we could decide to cut it short <br/>
if she really doesn&#39;t want it combed, yada, yada.  Options given and <br/>
rejected.  Crying time shortens.  Each time someone outside comments on her <br/>
hair (it really is beautiful!), I mention how it was just combed.  Now she&#39;s <br/>
asking for it to be combed.  She&#39;s not happy during the combing but likes the <br/>
end result.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure this was the right way or the wrong way.  She didn&#39;t want her <br/>
hair cut, which seemed to be the only logical resolution to the problem.  <br/>
She&#39;s started looking at herself in the mirror now.  Ultimately it was her <br/>
decision to keep her hair long and have it combed.  At least I think it was.  <br/>
i looked at it like her inhaler.  She doesn&#39;t particularly like to use it, <br/>
but if she doesn&#39;t, she gets an asthma attack with each and every cold.  <br/>
She&#39;s mostly accepting of that now too.<br/>
