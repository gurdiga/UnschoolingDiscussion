<div id="ygrps-yiv-498812742">This morning, Logan was figuring out size comparisions with strips of bacon. We had three left, so I split one so that we each had one and a half slices. I showed him how it was equal..we both had one big and one little slice, and I explained how the little one was half a slice. <br/>
<br/>
He looks at them and says &quot;I&#39;m like this one&quot; holding up the large slice. &quot;Megan is this one,&quot; he then said while holding up the small one. &quot;Oh, yeah?&quot; I asked. &quot;Yeah. And Jeremiah is a big one, and Gracie-baby is a little one!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Wow. Lessons learned with bacon...who&#39;da thunk? <br/>
