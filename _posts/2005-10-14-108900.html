<div id="ygrps-yiv-773179199">Hi my name is Dana and I am a mother of 5. I have been a lurker who <br/>
has been on this list for only a couple months I guess...So that <br/>
said...Hello to you all.  I have a question can someone point me in <br/>
the right direction to finding out different ways to record what my <br/>
children are doing so that when they have there evaluations it will <br/>
all make sense to the evaluator who is a certified teacher.  When we <br/>
moved from Albuquerque to Florida all I did was journal which was <br/>
fine with the evaluator, but now since we have been unschooling <br/>
longer, I no longer &quot;watch&quot; what my children do in order to <br/>
compartmentalize their activities into &quot;school subject boxes&quot; as I <br/>
used to.  Suddenly I am realizing that I still need to meet this <br/>
requirement for the state.  All that to say that I need suggestions <br/>
on how to explain what my children do without going back to looking <br/>
at everything through &quot;school&quot; eyes.  <br/>
<br/>
And for Sandra, I am almost positive that I spoke to you once early <br/>
on when me moved to Albuquerque back in 2001 and was looking for <br/>
homeschool support groups that was when I first learned of <br/>
unschooling.  Unschooling has sort of evolved for us and what once <br/>
seemed proposterous is now the norm in our home.  I am forever <br/>
grateful for finding this message board and the support it has <br/>
offered me through all of your experiences and insight.  TIA for any <br/>
suggestions about the record keeping.  Oh and anyway to legally get <br/>
around it would be even more phenomenal.<br/>

Would it be possible for you to contact a couple different evaluators now<br/>
and ask them what they expect you to bring?  Find out how long they have<br/>
been evaluating portfolios and be sure they are still planning on doing them<br/>
in the spring.  That way you would know for sure just what you need and not<br/>
just be guessing and stressing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Angela,<br/>
<br/>
I think that is a good idea.  I know the evaluator and she loved my <br/>
journaling...even said that she had never seen anything like it <br/>
before.  I guess I am just finding it hard to journal now that I <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;see&quot; things in school subject terms.  Does that make sense.  <br/>
I used to scrutinize all the kids did and label it as such.  For <br/>
example baking a cake was reading and following directions, math and <br/>
measuring, science watching it through the oven door while it <br/>
solidified or coagulated etc. Now we just bake the cake because we <br/>
like it and want to eat the cake - not for some educational reason.  <br/>
I am not sure if that makes sense but that is my probably lame <br/>
attempt at explaining it.  But I am gonna call this lady because she <br/>
would probably be very helpful in coming up with ideas.  Don&#39;t know <br/>
why I didn&#39;t think of that...probably cause it was so obvious!<br/>

Good!<br/>
I do get tired of phone calls from people who just want me to furnish them <br/>
(NOW!) with a playgroup of kids just their kids ages, and a curriculum to buy.   <br/>
But it&#39;s very cool when I hear someone stuck with it long enough to find and <br/>
understand unschooling.   <br/>
<br/>
I wish my phone number had never been published, but it&#39;s in a couple of <br/>
books and so there it is.   People expect it to be a business of some sort.<br/>

experiences are involved in whatever you&#39;ve listed.   She might just take it as <br/>
is without breakdown-style analysis.<br/>

I live in Washington state where I need to annually &quot;assess my child&#39;s progress&quot;.  The assessment needs to be signed by a certificated person, and there is a private business in Spokane, WA that provides this service for a fee.  (www.familylearning.org)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t bother to evaluate what an experience provided.  I simply list it.  &quot;Makes cake and cookies.  Uses the microwave oven.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-430362309">I put an &quot;Unschoolers Recordkeeping Form&quot; in the files area of this  <br/>
list. You can use it or adapt it - it&#39;ll work as a &quot;tickler&quot; system  <br/>
to help you record stuff while NOT having to think in school  <br/>
subjects. Your evaluator may be happy with it in that form or you  <br/>
might have to spend a bit of time reorganizing it for the evaluator.  <br/>
But at least you won&#39;t have to think in terms of school subjects all  <br/>
year long.<br/>
<br/>
You could use one page per day or one per week - whatever. Just an  <br/>
idea for a way to approach it.<br/>

Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] help with record keeping<br/>
<br/>
Hi my name is Dana and I am a mother of 5. I have been a lurker who<br/>
has been on this list for only a couple months I guess...So that<br/>
said...Hello to you all.  I have a question can someone point me in<br/>
the right direction to finding out different ways to record what my<br/>
children are doing so that when they have there evaluations it will<br/>
all make sense to the evaluator who is a certified teacher.  When we<br/>
moved from Albuquerque to Florida all I did was journal which was<br/>
fine with the evaluator, but now since we have been unschooling<br/>
longer, I no longer &quot;watch&quot; what my children do in order to<br/>
compartmentalize their activities into &quot;school subject boxes&quot; as I<br/>
used to.  Suddenly I am realizing that I still need to meet this<br/>
requirement for the state.  All that to say that I need suggestions<br/>
on how to explain what my children do without going back to looking<br/>
at everything through &quot;school&quot; eyes.<br/>
<br/>
And for Sandra, I am almost positive that I spoke to you once early<br/>
on when me moved to Albuquerque back in 2001 and was looking for<br/>
homeschool support groups that was when I first learned of<br/>
unschooling.  Unschooling has sort of evolved for us and what once<br/>
seemed proposterous is now the norm in our home.  I am forever<br/>
grateful for finding this message board and the support it has<br/>
offered me through all of your experiences and insight.  TIA for any<br/>
suggestions about the record keeping.  Oh and anyway to legally get<br/>
around it would be even more phenomenal.<br/>
<br/>
Dana<br/>

that, it&#39;s no longer a lie.  Well they can see it all the time with <br/>
us now and want to know all about it.<br/>

...nice!<br/>
<br/>
I am up early, for me~ watching the sun rise...its just wonderful, I don&#39;t<br/>
know why I don&#39;t do this much , much more! Could it be that I am on the net<br/>
late at night reading emails???grin<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to thank all the people on this list...I came here just about<br/>
a year ago...I thought that I knew so much about unschooling as I had been<br/>
(mostly) doing it for 10 years at the time ( that&#39;s only school years not<br/>
age...so longer if you count by age). I have grown SO very much with all<br/>
area&#39;s of my life since reading the posts from this group. This group has<br/>
been such a support to me.. Its very hard to meet &quot;unschoolers&quot; that really<br/>
truly &quot;get it!&quot;, I am still the only one that I know of in my area but I am<br/>
doing what I can to meet others, like creating the learninginfreedom Group,<br/>
trying to connect with people in my area. If you live in a place that you<br/>
know of others that unschool really unschool, Oh please know how truly lucky<br/>
that you are. How I wish I could meet up with others that are<br/>
likeminded...that look that you get when you say we don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; school, you<br/>
all know the one the one that you get when people ask how many hours a day<br/>
you do school, I would love to not get that look for once! When I think of<br/>
the freedom my kids have...I would love that kind of freedom from a local<br/>
meetup group..for my kids and myself, so we could have likeminded friends as<br/>
well...I guess in time ( hate that four letter word sometimes!) I just<br/>
wanted to say a BIG &quot;THANKS&quot; for this group and all the great ideas-support<br/>
it provides.<br/>
Have a great day all,<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
