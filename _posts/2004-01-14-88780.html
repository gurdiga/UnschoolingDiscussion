<div id="ygrps-yiv-534260615">My 2.5 year old DD LOVES county music and has since she was a <br/>
newborn (I think it&#39;s because I do too and used to sing to her when <br/>
I was pregnant).  Anyway, we have recently purchased a CD player for <br/>
upstairs so that she can sing and dance whenever she wants.  Well, <br/>
this morning, we were singing and dancing around upstairs together <br/>
and, all of a sudden, I had a flashback to my childhood.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to love to sing and dance when I was younger (as a matter of <br/>
fact, I took ballet, tap and jazz classes into my teens).  My mom <br/>
had this wrap around skirt that I would wrap around my dance leatard <br/>
and spin and kick around the house for hours.  My cousins, brother <br/>
and I would even make up skits to go along with the songs and <br/>
preform them for our parents.  I had completly forgotten about this <br/>
until this morning.  It&#39;s not the first time that we&#39;ve danced <br/>
together but, for some reason, this childhood memory came back to me <br/>
today.  <br/>
<br/>
My DD and I had so much fun this morning that I&#39;m even thinking of <br/>
taking some dance classes at the local community center.<br/>
