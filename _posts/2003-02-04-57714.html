different types--introverted thinkers who tend not to talk things out <br/>
too much, etc. Also in _How to Talk So Kids Will Listen (and Listen So <br/>

    Thanks for the book recommendation. I reserved it. &lt;G&gt; I have and<br/>
re-read How to Talk. It not that we have power struggles. Our relationship ,<br/>
I think, is rather good. I just wish he would talk to *me* more. I just<br/>
could be being selfish. He&#39;ll be 18 this Sept. He&#39;ll be moving out before I<br/>
know it. :-( I&#39;ll miss him being here daily.<br/>
    I wish I could find my copy of Teen/ Parent Breakthrough. Gotta run.<br/>
We&#39;re off to snowboarding today. :-)<br/>

&gt;&gt; This is what I&#39;m trying to do with my boys. The only thing is is what do<br/>
&gt;&gt; you do when they don&#39;t want to talk and share with you? I&#39;ve been trying my<br/>
