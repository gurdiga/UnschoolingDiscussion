&gt;     1. Only in America...can a pizza get to your house<br/>
&gt;  &gt; faster than an ambulance.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 2. Only in America...are there handicap parking<br/>
&gt;  &gt; places in front of a skating rink...<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 3. Only in America...do drugstores make the sick walk<br/>
&gt;  &gt; all the way to the back of the store to get their prescriptions while<br/>
&gt;  &gt; healthy people can buy cigarettes at the front. I love this one.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 4. Only in America...do people order double cheese<br/>
&gt;  &gt; burgers, large fries, and a diet coke.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 5. Only in America...do banks leave safe doors open and<br/>
&gt;  &gt; then chain the pens to the counters.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 6. Only in America...do we leave cars worth thousands<br/>
&gt;  &gt; of dollars in the driveway and put our useless junk in the garage.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 7. Only in America..do we use answering machines to<br/>
&gt;  &gt; screen calls and then have call waiting so we won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  &gt; miss a call from someone we didn&#39;t want to talk to in the first place.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 8. Only in America...do we buy hot dogs in packages of<br/>
&gt;  &gt; ten and buns in packages of eight.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 9. Only in America...do we use the word &quot;politics&quot; to<br/>
&gt;  &gt; describe the process so well: &quot;Poli&quot; in Latin meaning<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &quot;many&quot; and &quot;tics&quot; meaning &quot;bloodsucking creatures.&quot;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 10. Only in America...do they have drive-up ATM machines with Braille<br/>
&gt;  &gt; lettering..<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 11. Only in America...can a homeless combat veteran<br/>
&gt;  &gt; live in a cardboard box and a draft dodger live in the White House. </span></blockquote></div>
