Not agreeing with everything ole Henry did but breaking up the power<br/>

old England and for us by extension.<br/>

And, I don&#39;t believe he could have done if the time for change<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123891070">the church was corrupt, however, the imprisonment & killing of Catholic priests, monks, sisters & believers  was about Henry&#39;s lust and determination. The country had no choice, no say in Henry&#39;s decisions.<br/>
Certainly, there were people around Henry that agreed w/ him. Follow the money, where did the land that was stolen go to? The land that was stolen was not just from the churches - common people had to change their faith or lose everything. I doubt the country was ready for that.<br/>
<br/>
Compare that - GWB&#39;s tax cuts.  Are we, as a nation ready for the upper 2% of this nation to pay less taxes while the lower income class loses Health, Education & Welfare benefits? Are we, as a nation ready to roll back environmental laws in order for multi-national companies to get more profit?<br/>
No. We are not.<br/>
What can we do?<br/>
The common folks, the workers in the fields, the monks and the people they worked with, the inn-keepers and the blacksmiths - did these people want to change their faith - because Henry wanted a divorce?<br/>
Yes, the Church of Rome was corrupt. <br/>
Today there are many scandals going on in the Catholic Church - still - for the most part - you don&#39;t have Catholics saying they want to leave the church.<br/>
I have a feeling it was the same back then.<br/>
<br/>
Read the journals & papers - there was much resistance to this.<br/>
However, who was going to disagree?<br/>
the common people - just trying to get through -day to day??<br/>
Whether the &quot;country was ready is a question that is moot. He had absolute power. It simply didn&#39;t matter to him. Anyone w/ power - enough power to cause a problem was bought off. All the land that the Catholic church owned - became the property of the crown or Henry&#39;s loyal royals.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not passing judgement on whether or not it was good for England.<br/>
Just talking about history.<br/>

What about Springfield MA?  It&#39;s pretty central for NE.  Does it have it&#39;s own airport or do people just fly into Hartford and drive up?<br/>
