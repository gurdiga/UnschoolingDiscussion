I don&#39;t know if you saw my post about hoping to get info from Americans who have taught English to kids in Japan, but since I didn&#39;t get a reply I&#39;m wondering if you have done this or know of anyone who has.  My 21 year old son will be graduating from college in May and is going to apply for this job.  I wish he&#39;d choose a place closer to home but I certainly understand the need for learning and independence, plus his strong interest in Japan and its people.   If you know of this program and have any suggestions or annecdotal info, I&#39;d appreciate it.  He&#39;s learned both Japanese alphabets in the last month.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

If you don&#39;t get any replies here, I have friends in Japan who run a school<br/>
which teaches English.  I don&#39;t know if they have email, but I will check.<br/>
Either way, I could pass along questions, or you could write them.  Let me<br/>
know if you want me to do this.<br/>
<br/>
many blessings,<br/>
