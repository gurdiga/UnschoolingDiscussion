<br/>
I tried to find a more appropriate address to send my comments regarding<br/>
an article by Tom Danehy in the Tucson Weekly.<br/>
<br/>
The article, &quot;Poor Sports&quot; was filled with many highly charged negative<br/>
references to homeschooling. Having failed to find an address for<br/>
&quot;letters to the editor&quot; I thought I would pass my comments on to you<br/>
with the hope that you would know to whom they should be forwarded.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose controversy is a sign of success, but be that as it may, I<br/>
think some corrective information would be useful to provide a more<br/>
balanced view.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Danehy makes many generalizations about who would homeschool and the<br/>
(from his point of view) nefarious motivations that drive such<br/>
families.  Mostly he seems to be concerned about narrow mindedness and<br/>
bigotry being the driving forces behind homeschooling.  This ironic<br/>
observation would seem to be a case of projection on the part of Mr.<br/>
Danehy or perhaps simple ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
The homeschooling &quot;movement&quot; such as it is contains a wide spectrum of<br/>
individuals with an equally wide spectrum of views.  Yes there are<br/>
people who choose to homeschool because they are threatened by diversity<br/>
and seek to preserve their own insular world view for themselves and<br/>
their children.  I personally think that they are entitled to their view<br/>
and so long as they don&#39;t make me and mine conform to it they are<br/>
welcome to it.<br/>
<br/>
However Mr. Danehy&#39;s ignorance of the homeschooling/ unschooling<br/>
movement are revealed by his focus on what I believe is the minority<br/>
(though a significant one) of homeschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that he visit<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holtgws.com/index.htm">http://www.holtgws.com/index.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
which is a preeminent site for the growing without schools point of<br/>
view.  It is sponsored by a foundation established by John Holt who was<br/>
probably the leading critic of the educational system of the last fifty<br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
The community of homeschoolers with whom my family associates is<br/>
motivated by a dislike of the bland, superficial, prejudiced,<br/>
authoritarian, consumerist orientation of schools everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest a small collection of essays &quot;Deschooling Our<br/>
Lives&quot; edited by Matt Hern, &quot;Deschooling Society&quot; by Ivan Illich and any<br/>
of the many books by John Holt as an antidote to the profound ignorance<br/>
displayed by Mr. Danehy&#39;s shallow, thoughtless and bigoted remarks.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your attention to this.  I hope you are able to fwd my<br/>
comments to either &quot;letters to the editor&quot; or a similar appropriate<br/>
address.<br/>

best wishes<br/>
