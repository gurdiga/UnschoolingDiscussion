<div id="ygrps-yiv-754301432">I just learned this on another list & wanted to pass it on.  This could keep<br/>
you from being added to an unwanted group.<br/>
<br/>
Warning!<br/>
Unless you follow the following information ANYONE can add you to ANY<br/>
mailing  list or group if you are part of Yahoogroups.com! This will<br/>
protect you from someone adding you to an adult-oriented group, or a<br/>
SPAM group, or any other group you may find personally distasteful. On<br/>
the top right hand side of the menu there is a link called &quot;My<br/>
Preferences&quot; please click on this link. Or to go there straight away<br/>
follow this link http//groups.yahoo.com/myprefs<br/>
<br/>
You will see two columns. &quot;Subscriptions and Views&quot; and &quot;Email Accounts&quot;<br/>
both with edit buttons.<br/>
<br/>
On the left hand column &quot;Subscriptions and Views&quot; please note that there<br/>
is an option which says &quot;Group Moderators can directly add me to their<br/>
groups.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unless you change this anyone can add you to any type of group. So<br/>
please click on the edit button next to the &quot;Subscription and Views&quot;<br/>
heading.<br/>
<br/>
Then click the box that says &quot;Group moderators CANNOT directly subscribe<br/>
me to their groups.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then scroll down and press the &quot;save changes&quot; button. This will stop<br/>
anyone from being able to add you to a group without your permission.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It has ALWAYS been that way.  If you have not had a problem with people <br/>
doing it before, you should not have a problem with it now.  And people can <br/>
have their moderator rights taken away if they add people against their will.<br/>
<br/>
I have to subscribe people to my list a lot, but only when asked.  And in <br/>
my two years on onelist/egroups/yahoogroups I have only been subbed to a <br/>
group without me requesting it once.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would pass that along!<br/>
