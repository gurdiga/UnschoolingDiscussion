<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853665073">A bean teepee is as simple as taking some bamboo<br/>
or any other long 6-8 ft semi-straight piece of wood<br/>
and wrapping them together with some twine to make<br/>
a teepee...then at the foot of each stake you plant<br/>
some bean seeds (3 or 4) and there you have it..<br/>
just wait and as the beans grow you can help them<br/>
wind their way up the stakes..sometimes you may need<br/>
to tie them on with twine....that&#39;s as easy at it is..<br/>
you can also look onto the Burpee site..www.burpee.com<br/>
and a great new site with organic seeds and ideas<br/>
www.seedsofchange.com..<br/>
gardening has got to be one of the most pleasurable <br/>
activities I have found...I&#39;ve gone from a 4x6 raised<br/>
bed to 6 4x8 beds, one of which I will place a cold<br/>
frame on once March comes in...just so I can start<br/>
planting early...another great book to read is the<br/>
Four Season Garden by Elliot Coleman..its for anyone<br/>
who catches the gardening bug and has the time/space<br/>
to consider growing year round....the idea has actually<br/>
saved me time gardening because I don&#39;t plant everything<br/>
at once....<br/>
Anyhow that&#39;s enough from me right now..<br/>
I&#39;m starting some of my annuals under grow lights in<br/>
the basement already..need to fight these winter dole-drums<br/>
somehow...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076766665">YES! Elliot Colemam is a GURU! Four Season Harvest is another great one, our<br/>
garden measures about 2300 square feet total, and we&#39;ve taken many of<br/>
Mr.Coleman&#39;s ideas and utilized them. We are still eating from the garden!<br/>
