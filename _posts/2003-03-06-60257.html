<div id="ygrps-yiv-666789416">My 10yo daughter is insistent on going to 6th grade middle school next year.  <br/>
I don&#39;t think she will change her mind. As much as I don&#39;t like the idea, I <br/>
almost trust her to know where and how she wants to learn. I think I have <br/>
prepared myself for it. I really like &quot;Public School on Your Own Terms&quot; &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice&quot;">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice&quot;</a>&gt;<br/>

I printed it out last August, and it was really hard to swallow at first. Now <br/>
I find it as nothing short of brilliant. I guess that shows how far I&#39;m <br/>
coming with unschooling. I am prepared not to engage with the school against <br/>
my daughter, if she conducts herself the way she did in K-4th. I am prepared <br/>
not to put any stock in grades and such. I need advice on how to prepare her. <br/>
In my heart I think honesty is the best policy. I want her to know that I <br/>
think grades are a scam, and test scores are not a true representation of her <br/>
ability to learn or how bright she is. I want her to know that I was wrong to <br/>
battle with her in previous school years, that I only knew what I learned by <br/>
being part of the same school system that no one questioned. I want her to <br/>
know that there is a difference between wanting school and needing school. I <br/>
want her to know that I don&#39;t think she needs to go to school and needs to <br/>
get good grades and needs to get teacher approval to have some kind of <br/>
educational self-worth. I want her to know that my own experience as an honor <br/>
roll student was such an illusion, who was I when I stopped getting good <br/>
grades and playing the game? I want her to know that I think it is a game, <br/>
and not necessarily a beneficial one. Above all, I want her to know that I <br/>
trust her and she can trust herself in finding who she wants to be and how to <br/>
accomplish it. Do I need to do anything to share this with her, or just let <br/>
go? I get the impression that she thinks her year of unschooling was just to <br/>
get her away from the old and to go back with a new attitude. She wants to <br/>
try again, as if she failed and can prove she can do it. I know now she <br/>
wasn&#39;t failing, the system was failing her. She says she knows how to defeat <br/>
the popularity contest and bully crap she used to put up with. She says I <br/>
taught her that-- I swear I didn&#39;t! I think she idealizes school by watching <br/>
certain tv programs. I used to idealize middle school too. At least she has a <br/>
choice, isn&#39;t that half the battle?  Is it my place to show her my negative <br/>
bias against schools? I just want her to know that no matter what happens, <br/>
school is just school. Good or bad, right or wrong. It&#39;s not all it&#39;s cracked <br/>
up to be, not all what they want you to think it is.  Where I am going with <br/>
this, I am uncertain. The uncertainties of letting my child go back to school <br/>
after coming to my senses and getting her out of there after 4.5 years is so <br/>
difficult. How do you cope? Has anyone actually gone through this? Is there <br/>
anything I should or shouldn&#39;t be doing in all of this? Recommended reading? <br/>
(i am in the middle of Teenage Lib Handbook and plan to go straight to <br/>
Guerrilla Schooling next)Thanks and thanks again.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Do I need to do anything to share this with her, or just let <br/>
go? I get the impression that she thinks her year of unschooling was just to <br/>
get her away from the old and to go back with a new attitude.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can tell a current story of one of my sister&#39;s kids (from the article) who <br/>
was five or six when that was written and is fifteen now.<br/>
<br/>
Joshua, the youngest of my sister&#39;s three, wanted to go back to school to <br/>
play basketball.    Now he just goes to hang out with his friends.  He is <br/>
TOTALLY using school as socialization, and not doing well gradewise.<br/>
<br/>
But two weeks ago he was suspended for wearing a stocking cap he wasn&#39;t <br/>
supposed to be wearing.   So my brother-in-law had to go back in with him to <br/>
get him reinstated.  But my brother-in-law, who was a gifted honors student <br/>
eagle scout kind of guy in the same school system years ago doesn&#39;t care <br/>
about that hat rule, and would rather his son be home anyway.  He didn&#39;t want <br/>
to go to meet with the principal but Joshua really wanted to go back to <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
My recommendation to Gene, the dad, was to go with him this time, but tell <br/>
Joshua that the next time Gene&#39;s just going to let the suspension ride.  That <br/>
if Josh really wants to go to school and his parents would rather he be home, <br/>
then it&#39;s HIS responsibility to do what the school wants him to do to stay <br/>
there.  <br/>
<br/>
The same token the parents play saying &quot;I&#39;m not going to make you do <br/>
homework; I&#39;m not going to punish failure or reward honor roll stuff&quot; should <br/>
extend to &quot;If you get in trouble, YOU got in trouble.  Next time you get in <br/>
trouble, why don&#39;t you just come back home and homeschool?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my added piece of advice for such situations, then.<br/>
<br/>
The oldest of that family, Gina, is 18 now.  She has an extensive website.  <br/>
It&#39;s linked (and a piece of art is there that she did) here:<br/>

<br/>
and the mid-kid, Elijah, is almost 17 and lately dropped out of high school <br/>
and is going to do some community college stuff in fall, he says.  I asked <br/>
why he didn&#39;t just say &quot;homeschooling&quot; instead of &quot;dropping out&quot; and he said <br/>
the school said he would have to sign up for accredited courses at his age.  <br/>
I said they were wrong, but he just kinda was enjoying the notoriety of being <br/>
&quot;a drop-out.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
My sister just lately has decided Elijah was always on the autistic end of <br/>
life, probably Asperger&#39;s.  I think she&#39;s right.  They tested him for <br/>
deafness when he was little, and he was always in the gifted class, but often <br/>
had irritated all the other kids by being socially reckless and clueless.  <br/>
<br/>
Most of the kids I&#39;ve known who went back seemed to have a good time, and <br/>
enjoyed all the notebook organizational stuff.  I think if they&#39;ve never been <br/>
to school some explanation of school supplies would  help.  Maybe find a <br/>
friend who&#39;s going to school and find out what&#39;s standard and &quot;cool&quot; as to <br/>
backpack, binder, etc.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; supposed to be wearing.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughters take a dance class.  They are not supposed to wear jeans to<br/>
class, although many kids do.  There don&#39;t appear to be any consequences for<br/>
wearing them though.  This annoys me, because I think they should either<br/>
have a consequence for breaking the rule, or they should just do away with<br/>
the rule.<br/>
<br/>
Lisa has asked my permission to wear jeans.  I used to tell her no, because<br/>
the rule says you can&#39;t.  Now I leave it up to her.<br/>
