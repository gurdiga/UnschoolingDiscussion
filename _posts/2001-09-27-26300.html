<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144671287">Hello everyone!  Although I have homeschooled for 2 years, I am still <br/>
looking for the right approach.  I have heard a little about the <br/>
homeschooling &quot;idea&quot; and find it intriguing.  Any and all feedback <br/>
(suggestions, comments, etc. . .) would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Trisha</div>

Do you have specific questions?  There are lots of smart, experienced, <br/>
opinionated folks here.  Ask away.<br/>
Unschooling is better.<br/>
