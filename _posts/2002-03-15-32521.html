<div id="ygrps-yiv-160878528">Kolleen, I agree about the paperwork.  That&#39;s why,<br/>
when we moved to the Cincinnati area, I chose the<br/>
Kentucky side.  KY homeschool law is pretty much<br/>
hands-off but Ohio is invasive.  There are a couple of<br/>
lawmakers who try repeatedly to introduce various new<br/>
compulsory education laws in KY, but I hope things<br/>
will remain as they are.  We moved from Missouri last<br/>
year, where the law is similar to KY.  There are<br/>
documentation and time requirements for homeschoolers,<br/>
but the homeschooler is not questioned unless the<br/>
individual child is reported as neglected in some<br/>
obvious way. I provide materials and activities in all<br/>
academic and non-academic areas and keep just about<br/>
every piece of paper my daughters have written or<br/>
doodled on.  I keep lists of the books they read, the<br/>
films they watch, the websites they use, craft<br/>
projects, activities away from home. I&#39;ve never<br/>
followed a schedule, but I do keep an outline of the<br/>
approximate hours she spends on each subject area.  So<br/>
if we need it one day there is documentation.  <br/>
<br/>
If the state in which we reside does eventually<br/>
require paperwork I&#39;d just bite the bullet, but the<br/>
trend I&#39;ve seen over the eighteen years since my first<br/>
daughter was kindergarten age is toward easing of<br/>
restrictions.  At that time homeschooling was illegal<br/>
in some states, in other states the parents were<br/>
required to be licensed teachers.  Missouri was in the<br/>
process of making homeschooling legal the year my<br/>
first turned seven, so we were asked to report once to<br/>
the local superintendent just to show that we had a<br/>
plan and some form of textbooks.  Previously, Family<br/>
Services and the local school district governed<br/>
homeschoolers and were actually putting people in jail<br/>
for keeping their kids out of school.  The<br/>
superintendent was a manipulative and insulting jerk,<br/>
but with the old law off the books I knew he had no<br/>
power over me, so I listened for a few minutes and<br/>
then spread my books, workbooks, lists of books and<br/>
activities, etc., all over his desk, and enjoyed the<br/>
fact that he was at last speechless.  I had material<br/>
from the conservation dept that was designed for<br/>
public schools, but he had never seen it and asked how<br/>
he could obtain it.  The next year the new law went<br/>
into effect, requiring 1000 hrs per year, 600 of them<br/>
in academic areas and at home, the balance could be<br/>
non-academic and outside activities.  Some kind of<br/>
plan or schedule had to be written each year, sample<br/>
work had to be kept, and this was to show a judge in<br/>
the case of a neglect report which was at that point<br/>
strongly discouraged. KY law is similar.   <br/>
