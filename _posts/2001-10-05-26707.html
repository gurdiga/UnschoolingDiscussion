<br/>
&lt;&lt; I always thought I just didn&#39;t get math or science.  The whole physics <br/>
thing<br/>
threw me......then I watched Bill Nye and went Duh.  I understood physics<br/>
very well just didn&#39;t use the same words to describe things that the text<br/>
books did.  As soon as I realized that, I realized that could be true of so<br/>
many things....that I or the kids understood the concept in the real world,<br/>
just not the way that it is dissected in a &quot;curriculum&quot;.  Now I feel like<br/>
the world has opened up to me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was like that in physics too.  I understand the concepts, just not the <br/>
notation (or I was so afraid of the notation early on that I blank out, and I <br/>
can&#39;t tell which).  But I&#39;ve seen homeschooled kids who were NOT made afraid <br/>
of such things pick it up the same way they&#39;d pick up a Mario game--it&#39;s just <br/>
another game to them, another interesting bit of the world.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed with grammar, too, that when a child is already using &#39;fancy&#39; <br/>
tenses and forms, when/if the question comes up you can give a real-life <br/>
example of something they already do or know.  (And if the question never <br/>
comes up, so?  They&#39;re already using language in advanced native-speaker <br/>
fashion.)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s also why I don&#39;t mind at all the idea of kids having books read to <br/>
them that wouldn&#39;t have been assigned to them until years later in school, or <br/>
watching movies with them with &quot;adult content.&quot;  (MacBeth, or Hamlet, or the <br/>
parts of Othello they can stand are coming to mind.)  It doesn&#39;t matter what <br/>
order things are learned in by an individual.  It only (vaguely) matters at <br/>
school, since kids are batch-taught in a system which wishes it used Ford&#39;s <br/>
assembly line principles (so that an American third grader can change schools <br/>
and not be behind or ahead, but that part has  never worked yet, not even <br/>
within the same school oftimes).<br/>
<br/>
So bits and parts of different things is all that individual learners <br/>
(unschoolers and newly re-inspired parents thereof) to build a big model of <br/>
everything.   I keep learning and reviewing things I know from  years back in <br/>
light of new information.   Yesterday a friend asked me about <br/>
&quot;afghanistanism&quot; which is an old (hundred year old maybe) term.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
know the meaning until he asked me to find it, and he could have used <br/>
google.com too, but I&#39;m glad he asked me because now I know something.  It&#39;s <br/>
a term used in and about politics and journalism to describe distracting <br/>
people from local problems by saying &quot;Oh, LOOK!&quot; at something foreign and <br/>
interesting.  The term has has a new life this month.<br/>
<br/>
Now I wonder what was happening in Afghanistan in the Victorian or pre-WWI <br/>
days (IF that&#39;s when the term really originated).  But I don&#39;t have to find <br/>
out this week.  It will be on my &quot;I wonder...&quot; checkllist and someday I&#39;ll <br/>
fill it in some or I&#39;ll die first.  No hurry.<br/>

Feynmann.  It seems I can understand physics too.....when it&#39;s explained in <br/>
a way that makes sense to me.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In another one of his books is a great chapter about being on a textbook <br/>
committee.  He carefully read all the books and picked out the one(s) that <br/>
were at least accurate and explained things in a way that was easy to <br/>
understand.  Nobody else on the committee even read the books.  They just <br/>
picked the cheapest ones....sigh!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383308785">As you can tell, it&#39;s been FAR too long since I read that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve read the six easy pieces you mentioned earlier, but my dh is<br/>
teaching physics this year (high school) and ordered the lecture series for the<br/>
school, so I&#39;ll have the chance to read it.<br/>
