Hey BJ,<br/>
We had some interest going on the civil war a little over a year ago. <br/>
We were lucky enough to have some homeschoolers do a &quot;geography day&quot; <br/>
on it, due to the fact that they were re-enactors of civil war <br/>
times.  The husband got all dressed up in his confederate uniform <br/>
(hey, we ARE in the South) and had a real, live camp going complete <br/>
with food. The kids loved it. Weaponry, customs, food, clothing, the <br/>
whole aura of a time period was in person right in front of us. Very <br/>
cool.<br/>
Anyway, during that time we learned how to make hardtack, which the <br/>
kids still talk about.  Because of having to research recipes online, <br/>
we found this &quot;food timeline&quot; that has recipes in a timeline <br/>
organized method.<br/>

Have fun with that, we love it. Comes in handy for a lot of topics <br/>
and besides, it&#39;s always more fun to learn about something if you <br/>
connect it to food (just my honest opinion :)<br/>
