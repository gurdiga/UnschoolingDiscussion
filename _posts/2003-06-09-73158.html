  **My boys have a good friend that I find so rude and irritating.  But my boys <br/>
  ignore that kind of stuff because they like playing with him overall.  They <br/>
  treat him nice.  Sometimes I feel like my boys are &quot;too nice&quot; for that rude <br/>
  child. **<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Don&#39;t you think also that some things bother us when they don&#39;t bother others? <br/>
<br/>
  Also I&#39;ve thought, boy that child must have some really good qualities that I just don&#39;t get to see. My kids must see those qualities in their playing.    I just hear the things that are annoying to me! &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m learning to let certain things go.<br/>
<br/>
  I think its great that parents will let their children choose their friends,  it does show a level of respect we have for our children.  And as others have said,  if the friend is making some bad choices, our kids will usually pick up on that and then decide if they want to spend time with them.<br/>
