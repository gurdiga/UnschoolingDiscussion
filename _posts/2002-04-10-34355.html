&lt;&lt; I&#39;m not either, but they &lt;vets&gt; say it is like poison to them &gt;&gt;<br/>

I&#39;ve never had a little dog, always big ones.<br/>
<br/>
But Vets say lots of things.<br/>
And doctors say if your water breaks and you don&#39;t birth within 24 hours you <br/>
have to have a cesarean.  <br/>
And teachers say if a kid can&#39;t read by the time he&#39;s eight, he&#39;ll never <br/>
catch up.<br/>
And grandmothers say if you don&#39;t spank your kids they&#39;ll be spoiled.<br/>
<br/>
I figure any blanket &quot;rule&quot; or prediction is worthy of examination or <br/>
clarification.<br/>
<br/>
If pure chocolate can be poison to a small dog, then a parent going crazy and <br/>
punishing a kid because a Saint Bernard raided an easter basket and pooped <br/>
aluminum foil might be an over reaction.  <br/>
