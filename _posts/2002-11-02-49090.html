<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206182911">Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been meaning to respond to this for a few days - but we&#39;ve had a very<br/>
busy week!<br/>
Anyway, I am a vegetarian and have raised my boys (who are 9 & 11) veg since<br/>
birth. We are ovo-lacto for the most part. The kids have tried different<br/>
kinds of meat lately (because I told them it&#39;s their choice) but are both<br/>
basically sticking with the vegetarian diet.<br/>
<br/>
I use a lot of the meat substitutes out there like vegi-ground beef,<br/>
vegi-chicken and chicken nuggets, vegi-hamburgers and hotdogs. Since my dh<br/>
is not a vegetarian, he really enjoys when I use a typical &quot;meat&quot; recipe and<br/>
alter it using vegi-products. It works for us. If you need any help<br/>
converting some of your favorite recipes to veggie, let me know and I can<br/>
probably help. Hey, I even make my own vegi-ribs. &lt;.g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A couple books I would recommend for you and your daughter are &quot;Pretend<br/>
Soup&quot; and also &quot;Honest Pretzels&quot;, both by Mollie Katzen. They are kid<br/>
orientated with wonderful step-by-step directions and great illustrations,<br/>
and are just plain fun.<br/>
<br/>
Again, let me know if I can help in any way. I&#39;d love to - really.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-941824616">I hope it&#39;s okay to do this - but I got this list of exotic sandwiches off<br/>
the Vegetarian Kids e-mail list.<br/>
Maybe you (Julie) or someone else here would be interested in some of these<br/>
sandwich variations.<br/>
Happy World Vegan Day -today!<br/>

50 new sandwich ideas for World Vegan Day<br/>
LET&#39;S HAVE SANDWICHES THAT EVERYONE CAN ENJOY<br/>
<br/>
The average Briton eats 155 sandwiches a year, sustaining a market worth<br/>
over £3 billion according to findings of Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Caterers forget that tasty vegan fillings are suitable for meat eaters<br/>
too,&quot; said Tony Weston from The Vegan Society. &quot;On our birthday, World Vegan<br/>
Day 1st November, we want to see sandwiches that everyone can enjoy &shy;in<br/>
work canteens, on trains, in bakers&#39; shops, in supermarkets, at motorway<br/>
service stations, in cafes, in fact anywhere people might need a snack.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are a host of new vegan sandwich ingredients - ready cooked vegan<br/>
sausages, Mediterranean spreads and roasted vegetables, vegan chicken,<br/>
pumpkin seed pates, delicious dairy-free cream cheeses, egg-free mayonnaise,<br/>
vegan caviar and lots of unusual dark green leafy salads to bump up the<br/>
nutritional value while cutting down on unhealthy saturated fats and other<br/>
fast food nasties,<br/>
<br/>
Andy Mitchell, Associate Director of TNS¹ consumer usage panels said: &quot;As<br/>
consumers become more used to the high standards that the sandwich industry<br/>
has set, they are more critical about the quality of their sandwiches.<br/>
Although emphasis has been placed on increasing the variety of exotic<br/>
flavours to entice new consumers and maintain the interest of regular<br/>
sandwich purchasers, there is a strong view in the industry that much can be<br/>
gained by improving the standard sandwich by using the best quality breads<br/>
and ingredients.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Vegan Society wholeheartedly agrees.<br/>
<br/>
According to Mintel¹s research, ready-to-eat chilled vegetarian foods are<br/>
one of the most buoyant growth markets. &quot;It would be great to see more<br/>
snacks that everyone can enjoy,&quot; said The Vegan Society.<br/>
<br/>
Fillings don&#39;t necessarily have to be in bread or pitta pockets (which<br/>
exclude people on gluten-free and wheat-free diets) &shy; they can be<br/>
presented in corn tortillas or rice pancakes or as tasty salad in a<br/>
take-away tray.<br/>
<br/>

with something for everyone to enjoy:<br/>
