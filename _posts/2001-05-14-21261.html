<div id="ygrps-yiv-393447829">This reminds me of my husband as well.  He was also forced into complying with what his parents thought he was supposed to be. His mother still tries to control him!  Fortunately for him, he has always been a rebel and has refused to comply with the &quot;norm&quot; short of breaking the law!  Unfortunately for him, the woman he married has always thought she was supposed to comply with societies ways. (Yes, I&#39;m talking about myself:/)  It has been his rebellious attitude that has encouraged me to homeschool and finally to unschool my kids.  Ironically, it has been his resistance that has slowed the process down!  It is like, he knows he is supposed to act a certain way, but he just cannot be a conformist!  Now I just have to get him to quit working for the government!<br/>

I really think that is great.  Right now we are trying to undo the damage<br/>
my husband experienced in his childhood and his schooling so that he can<br/>
find his own true direction in life.  It ain&#39;t easy!  I wish he could have<br/>
taken the other path from the start.<br/>
