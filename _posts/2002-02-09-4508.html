<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108288694">I am assuming the men that turn out to be batterers exhibit some of those tendencies before they become husbands, maybe in a controlling manipulative manner.  Would that be typical?<br/>
<br/>
One thing we talk about a lot here is manipulative behavior.  Girls usually say to my daughters &quot;I won&#39;t be your friend if you don&#39;t .......&quot;  Or they will cry to make my daughters feel sorry and let them have their way.  We have gotten so calloused to this type of thing it has become a joke in our house.  I know it sounds cruel but my daughters will not be victims of manipulative behavior.  They tell their friends how they feel and they are direct in their communications.  <br/>
