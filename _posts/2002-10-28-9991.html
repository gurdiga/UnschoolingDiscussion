<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541128762">**In New Mexico you can&#39;t get a learner&#39;s permit until you&#39;re enrolled in <br/>
<br/>
driver&#39;s ed.  All the driver&#39;s ed courses are aimed at and scheduled for <br/>
<br/>
schooled kids.  Kirby works Monday afternoon, teaches Karate Tuesday <br/>
<br/>
afternoon, TAKES karate Thursday, and it&#39;s after school that the classes are, <br/>
<br/>
so we need to try a vacation course.  Thanksgiving MAYBE.  Christmas if we <br/>
<br/>
miss Thanksgiving.  Those are morning to 2:00 pm classes and won&#39;t impinge on <br/>
<br/>
his other schedule (not counting sleep).**<br/>
<br/>
Illinois is the same, no permit unless you&#39;re enrolled in driver&#39;s ed (from <br/>
age 15 to age 17 and 9 months). Melissa was in the same predicament, the <br/>
classes were at times she had commitments, and she&#39;s not the sort of kid <br/>
who&#39;d say, well, I&#39;m just not going to dance for a month, or someone else <br/>
will have to teach my classes. And the vacation classes were also during a <br/>
time she had other commitments!<br/>
<br/>
I started calling around to the drivers ed schools until I got one to agree <br/>
to hold classes just for her, at our convenience. I paid 1 1/2 times the <br/>
normal cost for the classes. She was bored silly by it all but we got it out <br/>
of the way.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s too late to think about for this kid, but the next one you might <br/>
want to try it.<br/>

Thanks for the idea!  One school had agreed to let him miss tuesdays and <br/>
thursdays, and I had hoped to do that in November, but now I&#39;m all <br/>
wheelchaired and not driving myself.  AND now Kirby has a newly added Monday <br/>
afternoon commitment so that wouldn&#39;t have worked out anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I already have the book.  There is a movie which is required for any new <br/>
driver in New Mexico, and I think for people who let their licenses lapse or <br/>
move from other states.  It&#39;s a drunk driving movie.  So maybe if he attended <br/>
class for that and on Thursdays we could ask for special other sessions and <br/>
the guy would go for that, MAYBE.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114708478">In North Dakota though, they will not take any Driver&#39;s Ed course for a<br/>
child under 16 (you can get a permit at 14 or 14 1/4 here), unless it is the<br/>
Driver&#39;s Ed put on by the school district.  I have a friend who even brought<br/>
the a homeschool driver&#39;s ed program into the office and spoke with them<br/>
about it, and they would not budge.  Wouldn&#39;t even look at it!  And it<br/>
wasn&#39;t one she had made at home, it was a purchased curriculum!  We have<br/>
decided, rather than forcing our child to go through the driver&#39;s ed at the<br/>
public school (because he said he did not want to do that), we will just<br/>
wait until after the &quot;magic&quot; age of 16 for him to get his permit.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a weird thought -- what happens if you happen to be over, say, 18?<br/>
Can you just go take the tests and get a license, if you know how to drive?<br/>
Do you have to get a learner&#39;s permit if you&#39;re over 18?  Hmm.... I&#39;ve got a<br/>
California driver&#39;s handbook in my glove compartment; I should look at it!<br/>

I did. In this county, not even the schools do it.  Only licensed driver&#39;s <br/>
education schools count.<br/>
<br/>
And homeschoolers register intent to homeschool, they&#39;re not private schools.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-47186359">I&#39;m sorry that New Mexico doesn&#39;t have that option, but then you probably<br/>
don&#39;t have 15 year old licensed driver&#39; either,lol.  I am originally from<br/>
California, so I think 14 for a permit and 15 to drive is awfully young.  Of<br/>
course, we currently live in farm country, and kids around here are driving<br/>
the riding lawn mower at 6 or 7 and a tractor by the time they are 10, so<br/>
they think nothing of this young driving age.  It probably makes sense on<br/>
the farm, but when you get into the cities where children haven&#39;t learned to<br/>
drive so young, it is pretty crazy!<br/>
