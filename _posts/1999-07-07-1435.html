<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141565622">Hi all, I have a question to throw out to all of you from California, or<br/>
who may be familiar with California laws.  After wading through the legal<br/>
jargon listed under the laws for California on the Unschooling.com website,<br/>
I have emerged not much wiser.  I have a niece who is interested in what<br/>
her local laws are (she is visiting me here for the summer.)  <br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to Unschool in California, as the mumbo jumbo I read did not<br/>
leave me with that impression.  What are her options for possible<br/>
Independent Study, programs that may allow her to jump start into community<br/>
college programs, or other educational opportunities?  She was 13 this<br/>
April and will be entering 8th grade next year.  She is in the gifted<br/>
program in her public school and has been an academic star since the first<br/>
day of kindergarten.  She gets high test scores, academic achievment<br/>
awards, certificates of excellence, and is on both the school honor roll<br/>
and National Honor Roll (letter from Clinton, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
She is dissatisfied with the social climate at the ps, the attitute of the<br/>
staff and faculty, the academic fare, etc.  She has also felt the pressure<br/>
of being a high achiever at school and suffered from the expectations of<br/>
her parents and teachers alike (&quot;You&#39;re my A student.....&quot;etc)   She has<br/>
had a bleeding ulcer from the stress.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know what options she may have, as she is interested in what<br/>
I have had to tell her about Unschooling, my experiences in ps and how my<br/>
sons will have a very different experience.  She is &#39;jealous&#39; and wants to<br/>
get info to take home to her parents on what options she may have.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

&gt; Hi all, I have a question to throw out to all of you from California, or<br/>
&gt; who may be familiar with California laws.  After wading through the legal<br/>
&gt; jargon listed under the laws for California on the Unschooling.com website,<br/>
&gt; I have emerged not much wiser.  I have a niece who is interested in what<br/>
&gt; her local laws are (she is visiting me here for the summer.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is possible to unschool in CA.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the confusion lies in the number of choices one has for<br/>
being a homeschooler.  The Independent Study Programs are just one<br/>
(or two) ways of doing it.  The ISP can be a public school ISP, either<br/>
your own district or if you can get approval another district.  We<br/>
also have a number of private charter ISPs who operate statewide.<br/>
Success of unschooling with either ISP program is dependent upon<br/>
one&#39;s supervising teacher (for public school ISPs) or facilitators<br/>
(for the private ISPs).  Another option exists which I did not<br/>
see you mention - that is to file an R-4 affidavit.  This is an<br/>
affidavit which states that you are running a private school so then<br/>
the homeschool is subject to regulations for private schools.  This<br/>
is the way I will do it when I reach that point (in 2 years).  My<br/>
children are under the age of compulsory attendance.<br/>
<br/>
For more information check out Homefires webpage<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homefires.com">http://www.homefires.com</a>  There is an email list for northern CA<br/>
on onelist called CAhomeschool; I&#39;m sure there is something for southern<br/>
CA too.  I&#39;m sure her questions would be welcome on the CAhomeschool<br/>
list -- Diane Flynn Keith, the editor of Homefires is quite active<br/>
on the list as are others quite well versed in the way it works in CA.<br/>
A number of people use whatever option works for them during a <br/>
particular year and change when they need something else.<br/>
<br/>
I do know a lot of people who unschool quite successfully in all<br/>
of the above mentioned ways of homeschooling. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316219216">Unschooling in California is very simple, actually. You (or in this case,<br/>
the girl&#39;s parents) need to file an R4 form with the state. This establishes<br/>
the family as a private school in California and voila. That&#39;s it. They are<br/>
obligated to keep attendance, to have their instruction primarily in the<br/>
English language, and some other things that are equally beside the point<br/>
for homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
It is really, really unusual for California homeschoolers to be hassled in<br/>
any way, and if by some fluke they are, there is a good, inclusive, powerful<br/>
state group to help you fight, and you can check them out at this website:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hsc.org">http://www.hsc.org</a><br/>
<br/>
which will also give you the exact ins and outs of the R4.<br/>
<br/>
There are independent study programs through both private and public schools<br/>
in California, and that&#39;s another legal option, but IMHO most unschoolers<br/>
will find jumping through the hoops a tedious business when they could be<br/>
getting on with their lives. The R4 is freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
