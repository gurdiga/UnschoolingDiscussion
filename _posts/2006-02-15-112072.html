<div id="ygrps-yiv-720544454">Hi... I&#39;m new to this list, we took the kids out of public school last May after the school year ended (it ends early in Texas) and have been deschooling since... I got tired of the older 2 bringing home stuff related to the yearly achievement test.. from 3rd grade on, school became &quot;all about the TAKS test, uhg)... we also moved (in December) & packing was a TON of work and we&#39;re still remodelling & living in the 2 finished rooms in the house...<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re still feeling our way with schooling/unschooling... at the outset, we tried using the Robinson curriculum but the math was Saxon math & the older boys used Saxon in school.. can you spell disaster? (One of my boys said that Saxon gave him some bad memories... ) Also they weren&#39;t interested in writing very much... I&#39;ve been doing a lot of reading (a lot about waldorf & I have 2 or 3 books by John Holt & recently purchased Guerilla Learning by Lllewellyn Grace, would&#39;ve gotten her other book but didn&#39;t know if it was mainly for teens...<br/>
<br/>
All 3 of the older boys (11 yr old twins & an 8 year old) got their 6 hours for 6 flags reading done & next year all 4 of my boys will be eligible for the 6 flags reading program... I&#39;m looking forward to watching them on the roller coasters, hehehe... (maybe I&#39;ll go on one, too!) The youngest (4-1/2) will be able to participate next year... (mostly reading aloud unless he teaches himself how to read)...<br/>
<br/>
One of my boys is *very* interested in chemistry, wants a chemistry set & wants to fix up our camping trailer to use for a chemistry lab when we&#39;re not using it for camping... any suggestions for good chemistry books or maybe a good chemistry set or supplies or a book or website with good info for putting together our own? There are so many & my son wants test tubes/vials... someone on one of my homeschool email lists posted a ton of science books...will show him the list later...<br/>
<br/>
Ren: I want to hear more about that signature shawl! Is there a story behind it? Did she make it? I can&#39;t see if it&#39;s knit, crocheted, woven or... but I&#39;m guessing crocheted from the texture that I can see...or maybe it&#39;s garter stitch? It&#39;s gorgeous! I can&#39;t wear shawls, I get tangled up! &lt;lol&gt; Maybe when I&#39;m out of the kiddo carrying stage... (I&#39;m a knitter & weaver & whatever, as long as it&#39;s color...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-214285411">LOL It may be &quot;healthier&quot;, but a whole lot less expensive when you are <br/>
talking about taking a family with more than just one or two children <br/>
to an amusement park like Six Flags! Mine are also looking forward to <br/>
those free tickets to Six Flags! Without &#39;em, we probably couldn&#39;t <br/>
afford it! <br/>

off, rather than keeping track of minutes or pages?<br/>
<br/>
We have used the pizza hut book it program.  This comes with charts and <br/>
stars, but we just use the coupon for a free pizza.<br/>
<br/>
I just got forms to get free kid&#39;s tickets to Silverwood (a water theme park <br/>
in Idaho).  I&#39;m just going to divide the required reading by the number of <br/>
days and fill in the chart.<br/>
<br/>
My schooled nephew recently won his classroom&#39;s reading contest.  The winner <br/>
was taken out for ice cream by the teacher.  He is 10 and normally reads <br/>
books such as Redwall.  During the contest he read short books because the <br/>
winner was the one who read the most &quot;books&quot; not pages or minutes.  Not sure <br/>
what he really won in the long run there, but he did get the ice cream.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The sheet we have for this has places for the time spent reading. They <br/>
are supposed to get it in exchange for so many hours of reading. We <br/>
are doing it by counting our story times together, and other places. <br/>
Since my kids aren&#39;t reading on their own a lot yet, we are counting <br/>
their time being read to. <br/>
To do it the other way feels dishonest to me, so we are doing it this <br/>
way. We are sending in two sheets,(one for each kid with a different <br/>
parent listed) so we get two adult tickets out of the deal. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146376035">Or just keep track of the reading by making guesses, and not telling <br/>
the kids about it, just that you are going to be going to six flags <br/>
after the tickets or certificates come in. That way it isn&#39;t tied to <br/>
it for the kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The point of these programs is supposed to be to encourage children to read. <br/>
I&#39;m sure the company sponsers benefit, as they get business from the adults <br/>
bringing the children to redeem their &quot;free&quot; stuff and probably tax <br/>
deductions too.<br/>
<br/>
My children live in a very reading friendly household.  We have lots of <br/>
books, I read to them daily (they are 13 and 10).  I get books from the <br/>
library and other sources.  We listen to audiobooks together.  None of that <br/>
is required, except for the bedtime reading which they practically require <br/>
me to do, lol.  But I enjoy it very much.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel that I&#39;m doing anything dishonest in making use of a program <br/>
that wants to give stuff to kids, even if we aren&#39;t using the program <br/>
exactly the way it was envisioned.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737673668">Oops! Guess I forgot to say that I haven&#39;t kept track of exact <br/>
hours read and my kiddos aren&#39;t aware of that piece of <br/>
the &quot;requirement&quot; either. Like another mom here, we are all big <br/>
readers in our household, just because we like to read and be read <br/>
too, so I&#39;m don&#39;t feel guilty in &quot;guesstimating&quot; the hrs we&#39;ve read. <br/>
In hindsight, I see now that I leftout a big piece of information with <br/>
my original post. This group sure keeps one on their toes! LOL <br/>
