<div id="ygrps-yiv-8919458">Both my teens, Nell 16 and Sky 19, went two summers in a row to NBTSC in<br/>
Oregon. It was an inspiring and enriching time for them. . . opening up<br/>
their hearts and minds a great deal. Mostly for them it was an affirmation<br/>
that the way they learn and view the world is shared by other teens, which<br/>
is surely not the case here on Kauai, where they are the only unschooled<br/>
teens we know. They both made some deep personal shifts and some great<br/>
friends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009068164">I just checked out this website: www.nbtsc.org regarding their &quot;not <br/>
back to school camp&quot; which takes place in both Oregon and Vermont. The <br/>
website makes it look and sound great! Has anybody had a child attend <br/>
one of these, or know of anybody who has, and can give some feedback? <br/>
Thanks.<br/>

their kids LOVED it. <br/>
Cameron Lovejoy is going again this year, and will tell  you all sorts<br/>
of wonderful things about camp. In fact, he was sharing something he<br/>
picked up at camp during conference this year...hug buttons!:)<br/>
He drew hug buttons on himself, or on anyone that asked for one. When<br/>
you push the hug button you get a hug of course.<br/>
<br/>
Elissa&#39;s son Zack has gone before and enjoyed it. Oh, and Mary Gold&#39;s<br/>
son Connor is going this year. I encouraged my son to check it out,<br/>
but he&#39;s reluctant to fly on his own still...so maybe another year.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a kids discussion about camp over at unschooling.info.<br/>

Brenna  (16) has gone to West Virginia for two years and will go to  Vermont <br/>
this year.  An all positive experience for her.  She says  it&#39;s hard to <br/>
describe but... &quot;once you go, you get it.&quot;<br/>
She&#39;s made some wonderful friends, shared time with other unschoolers and  <br/>
expanded her world by going.<br/>
 <br/>
She does think her brother (who is 13) would enjoy it more if he  waited one <br/>
more year to go. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-808909250">My oldest daughter went first as a camper and then went as a staff  <br/>
person for the past couple of years. Not sure if she&#39;s going to be  <br/>
able to do it next time, but she will most definitely want to do it -  <br/>
she LOVES NBTSC and will talk your ear off about how wonderful it is.  <br/>
If you have more specific questions, I could pass them along to her.<br/>
