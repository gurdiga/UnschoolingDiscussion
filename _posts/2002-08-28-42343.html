<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793940527">I agree with Paula and find myself going even one step further - I don&#39;t<br/>
believe plays were really *meant* to be read as literature.  They were<br/>
written for the express purpose of being performed.  The script is only the<br/>
road map of the production.  Reading a script is like looking at a road map<br/>
of someone&#39;s trip to the most beautiful place on earth and trying to get a<br/>
sense of it from only that 2 dimensional piece of paper.  Don&#39;t torture<br/>
yourself trying to read plays, there it too much other good stuff out there!<br/>
My husband and I also do theatre and when I am getting ready to design the<br/>
costumes for a play I always go to the first read through.  Even though it<br/>
is just the actors and director sitting around a table reading the script<br/>
aloud, it *always* clarifies the story for me.<br/>
<br/>
Save a particular play for when you can find an affordable production of it<br/>
live, or rent it on video tape or find a book on tape version.  Or if you<br/>
just can&#39;t wait, get a group of friends together and do your own read<br/>
through!<br/>

&gt; I find a LOT of plays boring to read - and we are theater people! I<br/>
&gt; really <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t understand a play until I&#39;ve seen it on it&#39;s feet, then read it,<br/>
&gt; then <br/>
&gt; seen it or worked on it some more.**<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hey, Paula --<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think my son is too young, and my budget too lean for live theater.<br/>
&gt; But I&#39;ve been wanting to get more plays on video.  My son has watched<br/>
&gt; some Shakespeare and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead with avid<br/>
&gt; interest.  I&#39;m thinking he can handle some pretty complicated ideas if<br/>
&gt; he gets to take them in on the comfort of his couch.  Do you want to<br/>
&gt; recommend anything?  (The rest of you are welcome to chime in.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think I&#39;m getting my husband Steambath on video for Christmas.<br/>
&gt; Irreverance really appeals to him.  (Definitely explains why he married me.)<br/>
