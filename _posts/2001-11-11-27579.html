&gt; before summer. I get as much cabin fever here in the summer where you can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; go outside in the heat as I figure people in the snow get. When it starts to<br/>
&gt; cool down in November and we can open the windows, I feel like a new person,<br/>
&gt; and start to get a little energy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OTOH, though, I don&#39;t want to go where there&#39;s a LOT of snow, either, just<br/>
&gt; someplace with four seasons.<br/>

mid-winter, when you&#39;re REALLY wanting to experience the joy of snow and <br/>
seasons, and i&#39;m just sick of it, you can come spend a nice week in Salem, <br/>
Massachusetts and  I&#39;ll go to your place in Tucson!  :)<br/>
