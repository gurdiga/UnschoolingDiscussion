<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512139808">I&#39;m no expert by any means, but to my knowledge anime is japanese style <br/>
animation. Much (but certainly not all) of it is dark and sexualized. <br/>
Princess Mononoke is an example of the non-dark variety; we enjoyed it, <br/>
although it was a bit too heavy for my then 9 yo.<br/>

The Right Stuf - Introduction to Anime<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rightstuf.com/introduction/">http://www.rightstuf.com/introduction/</a><br/>
<br/>
I think, as someone suggested, that the anime that is most readily available<br/>
on video in the US tends to be dark, violent and sexual because the audience<br/>
most into anime in the US is the young adult male audience and they have<br/>
more disposable income to spend on it. And dubbing them is expensive. (Most<br/>
people who appreciate anime want subtitles, but the manufacturers can sell<br/>
more if they&#39;re dubbed.) In Japan, anime is marketed to all sorts of<br/>
audiences, as wide a range as movies in general.<br/>
<br/>
On TV, the big audience is kids: Pokemon, Dragonball Z, Digimon, Yu-gi-oh,<br/>
Gundam, Hello Kitty, Hamtaro. Cartoon Network has a block of it 4-6 (or so)<br/>
every weekday afternoon and some more adult stuff Saturday around midnight.<br/>
<br/>
That lack of variety seems to be changing with DVD&#39;s which, though they<br/>
often are priced higher, maybe are cheaper to get into production, ship<br/>
(they&#39;re lighter), display (they&#39;re smaller) so companies can make a profit<br/>
off a title that won&#39;t sell a huge number of disks.<br/>
<br/>
And some of the dark, violent, sexual ones are very good -- for adults of<br/>
course! -- even for people who don&#39;t normally watch dark, violent, sexual<br/>
stuff like me ;-) Akira comes to mind. They have a depth to them that leaves<br/>
you feeling like your brain has had a work out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll repost what I wrote last time since I really should be working in my<br/>
conference talk ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Could you<br/>
&gt; ask him what the appeal is?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whereas with the cartoons we watched as kids the first episode wasn&#39;t much<br/>
different than an episode 3 season later in terms of character or setting<br/>
(if it was, it generally indicated the cartoon wasn&#39;t doing so well and they<br/>
were trying to fix it and make it better ;-) the anime stories tend to be<br/>
multilayered. The division between good and bad can be less distinct than in<br/>
western cartoons (and western movies for that matter.) Anime stories tend to<br/>
be on going with the characters changing and developing over the course of<br/>
the series so it gives more of a feeling of tension that anything could<br/>
happen. And that you&#39;ll miss something if you don&#39;t keep watching. ;-) (In<br/>
fact sometimes they&#39;ll start all over again with a different story line like<br/>
they did in Tenchi.) Basically they treat the viewer as intelligent. For<br/>
some reason kids like that! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anime developed out of -- and are still often translations of -- Japanese<br/>
comics (manga) which is a *huge* industry in Japan. And *not* just for kids.<br/>
<br/>
Neither is anime just for kids. Some (perhaps a lot since the market for it<br/>
in the US tends to be teen and 20&#39;s males) is very definitely not for kids.<br/>
In Japan there isn&#39;t the western prejudice against sci-fi and animation and<br/>
they can use both to tell a story without the fear that they&#39;re limiting<br/>
their audience.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why the big eyes on the<br/>
&gt; character ;)?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They are windows to the soul :-) The most innocent characters have the<br/>
biggest eyes with the most light spots. Westerners tend to think they are<br/>
western eyes, but westerners don&#39;t have baseball sized eyes any more than<br/>
the Japanese do. ;-) The eyes just indicate something about the character.<br/>
Sort of like black hair in western movies indicating a bad person and blond<br/>
hair a good person. The eyes are just more so. It&#39;s probably a holdover from<br/>
the comic books where they can often tell a lot of the story without words.<br/>
<br/>
The hair, too, is a holdover from manga with imaginative hairstyles and<br/>
unnatural colors. It helps people identify characters quickly. The covers<br/>
are colored but the inside pages of most books are black and white so having<br/>
distinctive hair was a big help in keeping the characters straight.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How does it compare to &quot;American&quot;<br/>
&gt; cartoons?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If she hasn&#39;t seen My Neighbor Totoro or Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service, go out and<br/>
rent them right now. They&#39;re a full course meal and make Disney look like<br/>
Fizzies.  (Of course Miyazaki is the best of the best and his lastest<br/>
picture (Spirited Away I think is the English title) is the highest grossing<br/>
film of all time in Japan.)<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s Japanese animations.<br/>
There are poplular, not-so-great ones like Dragon Ball Z, or some really <br/>
great ones like Cowboy BeBop, Outlaw star or Inu Yasha (although the first <br/>
two maybe not good for very young children).<br/>
I have a website saved somewhere that rates different anime, from movies to <br/>
tv shows and lets you know how good they are.<br/>
I have agreed with it so far, they pay attention to not only the plot/story <br/>
line but the quality of animation.<br/>
A couple of really great movies that my kids LOVED (and good for all ages) <br/>
are &quot;My neighbor Totoro&quot; and &quot;KiKi&#39;s Delivery Service&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
I think (could be wrong) that &quot;anime&quot; is French for animated films.  And it <br/>
would get an accent on the last e.  <br/>
<br/>
And then there was &quot;Japanimation&quot; as a term for a while.  And then I guess <br/>
American animation fell quite by the wayside, and the Japanese stuff was <br/>
&quot;Japanese animation,&quot; and it picked up the name &quot;anime&quot; mostly all by itself.<br/>
<br/>
That might end up in urban legends as bad information, but it has a hint, <br/>
kernal or perhaps a good-sized lump of truth.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Disney bought the rights to dub and distribute Miyazaki&#39;s films and they&#39;re<br/>
just sitting on them. I suspect Disney thinks they might be huge money<br/>
makers -- they are in Japan -- but they don&#39;t want to squander the<br/>
opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
They *did* finally release Totoro on DVD. (Due in December maybe?) I even<br/>
said that in July that Disney would do that to me as I finally broke down<br/>
and bought a VHS copy after waiting for the DVD ;-)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an excellent site that has loads of well researched information<br/>
about his movies at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://WWW.Nausicaa.net/miyazaki/">http://WWW.Nausicaa.net/miyazaki/</a> There are even scripts<br/>
from some of them.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s a new (to the US) film in theaters now, Spirited Away. (It&#39;s PG)<br/>
There&#39;s a theater list at the Nausicaa site.<br/>

&lt;&lt; That lack of variety seems to be changing with DVD&#39;s which, though they<br/>
often are priced higher, maybe are cheaper to get into production, ship<br/>
(they&#39;re lighter), display (they&#39;re smaller) so companies can make a profit<br/>
off a title that won&#39;t sell a huge number of disks. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Also the DVD&#39;s give you the option of subtitles or dubbing, whereas the <br/>
videos tried to do both (but separately).  There are series of Japanese <br/>
cartoons which were/are on TV over there.  Kind of like fantasy soap operas.  <br/>
Those aren&#39;t adult content.   Time travel, adventure, heroics, teamwork, <br/>
mysteries...<br/>
