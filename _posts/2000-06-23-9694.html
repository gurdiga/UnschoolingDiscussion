<br/>
Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
My son is 6 years old and I have been doing my own  business for over 4 years.  He&#39;s gotten<br/>
kind of used to it.  When I get a call I just tell him that it&#39;s a business call and &quot;most&quot; of<br/>
the time he&#39;s patient.  I also talk to folks sometimes when we are out and about and I&#39;m<br/>
looking for prospects, sometimes he does well, sometimes I slip him a quarter for the nearby<br/>
gum ball machine.  I do more of my serious work in the evening a few nights a week when my<br/>
husband is home.  I also keep in touch via e-mail to folks already with my company or<br/>
interested in my company.  Right now, I&#39;m grabbing some time as my son is playing with<br/>
neighbors in the back.  I always have to be alert and ready to any change.  I also have to<br/>
make sure I make time for my family.  It&#39;s also an interesting situation when my son gets<br/>
really busy in the house and leaves &quot;projects, creations&quot; around the house, when I&#39;m not<br/>
looking and on the phone.<br/>

&gt;   My second son is the same way - very independent.  He will go and lay down<br/>
&gt; in his bed when he is tired(he is going to be 2 July 7th).  My oldest (3<br/>
&gt; 1/2) still likes someone to lay down with him, and he co-sleeps with his<br/>
&gt; brother.  They still get up and want someone in there at night sometimes -<br/>
&gt; hubby gets that job.  He enjoys it really.  They are just different children<br/>
&gt; with different needs.  My oldest though is more outgoing to strangers - goes<br/>
&gt; up to them and talks with them.  My youngest will wander off and not even<br/>
&gt; look back.  So I am sure you are doing what is right but they just have<br/>
&gt; different night time needs.<br/>

&gt;        I can imagine how said you feel when you&#39;re daughter is being so<br/>
&gt; independent, but just think how wonderful it is that because you met all of<br/>
&gt; her attachment and security needs when she was an infant you gave her the<br/>
&gt; self-confidence to do all of these things on her own. I wouldn&#39;t doubt that<br/>
&gt; your son might have been hanging on a bit longer because of those nights in<br/>
&gt; the crib, but every child is different. You just have to do what works with<br/>
&gt; each one, huh?<br/>

&gt; Welcome Dawn!<br/>
&gt;    Keep reading this list it is wonderful and banishes my doubts daily. I<br/>
&gt; have found ,in my experience that you do not have to entertain them<br/>
&gt; constantly, in fact it&#39;s probably better if you don&#39;t, they become more<br/>
&gt; creative when left to their own devices. I&#39;m always amazed by what my son<br/>
&gt; (age 6) comes up with on his own. Good luck.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Japanese editorial on crime by children<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi folks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s election time here in Japan, and you know what that means: more<br/>
&gt; clouding of the real issues at hand, tons of promises, and little or no<br/>
&gt; action taken to address the problems once all the noise is over.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Following is a newspaper editorial in today&#39;s Japan Times newspaper that<br/>
&gt; gives some idea of what those in official circles are thinking during<br/>
&gt; this election campaign about child-related crime.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I say &quot;official circles&quot; because despite its independent status, the<br/>
&gt; Japan Times is well-known for historically having a very cozy<br/>
&gt; relationship with the Japanese government. The paper has dutifully earned<br/>
&gt; its reputation as the &quot;mouthpiece&quot; of Japan&#39;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs<br/>
&gt; on just about every economic and political issue you can name. One of the<br/>
&gt; newspaper&#39;s past presidents, Mr. Shintaro Fukushima, in fact, has<br/>
&gt; formerly served as Japan&#39;s ambassador to the United Nations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But for what it&#39;s worth, here&#39;s the editorial. Not too surprisingly, the<br/>
&gt; article never delves into the influence that Japan&#39;s oppressive school<br/>
&gt; system has on the psyches of these so-called &quot;young miscreants.&quot; Oh well,<br/>
&gt; maybe in the next election....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I hear a campaign soundtruck coming up the<br/>
&gt; street, and I must go outside and get my daily dose of noise pollution. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; EDITORIAL - The Japan Times<br/>
&gt; Tuesday, June 20, 2000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; AGE IS NOT ALL THAT MATTERS<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With the volume favored by candidates&#39; loudspeaker cars, it can be<br/>
&gt; difficult to tell what issues they are addressing in the campaign leading<br/>
&gt; up to Sunday&#39;s election for the House of Representatives. Both the ruling<br/>
&gt; and opposition parties are engaging in the usual name-calling and<br/>
&gt; sloganeering and not giving more than superficial attention to some of<br/>
&gt; the main concerns of potential voters. One of these is the rising tide of<br/>
&gt; juvenile violence that parents, school authorities and the police all<br/>
&gt; seem powerless to control.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A number of heinous incidents this year have all involved 17-year-olds.<br/>
&gt; But as each day&#39;s news brings a fresh report of yet another case of<br/>
&gt; youthful criminal behavior, the age level of the perpetrators has dropped<br/>
&gt; to as low as 15 or even 14. Meanwhile, all the political parties are<br/>
&gt; mainly concentrating on the idea of lowering the age at which young<br/>
&gt; people legally become adults to 18 from the present 20. Prime Minister<br/>
&gt; Yoshiro Mori, campaigning nationwide for the Liberal Democratic Party and<br/>
&gt; its partners in the governing coalition, is having some success in<br/>
&gt; controlling his tendency to make provocative statements that embroil him<br/>
&gt; in instant controversy. He is putting the emphasis in stump speeches on<br/>
&gt; reducing the age at which minors can be tried in criminal courts for<br/>
&gt; serious offenses from 16 to 14.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This appears to be what all the parties have in mind, in the wake of the<br/>
&gt; public&#39;s disappointment at the failure of the regular Diet session, which<br/>
&gt; ended June 2, not only to pass but even to discuss the widely heralded<br/>
&gt; bill aimed at revising the Juvenile Law to better deal with the increase<br/>
&gt; in youthful crimes of violence. As a result, the bill was scrapped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The present Juvenile Law, which came into effect in 1949, stresses the<br/>
&gt; rehabilitation of young wrongdoers. The Family Court has jurisdiction<br/>
&gt; over cases involving young people under 20. Serious cases involving<br/>
&gt; youths 16 or older can be referred to prosecutors for handling in a<br/>
&gt; criminal court, although until recently this has rarely occurred.<br/>
&gt; Juveniles under the age of 14 who engage in acts that legally would be<br/>
&gt; considered criminal offenses are referred to a special consultation<br/>
&gt; office for children. But as the level of youthful violence has escalated,<br/>
&gt; and the types of crimes perpetrated have become more serious, many people<br/>
&gt; now believe the law is too lenient.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Young people in Japan today certainly are more physically mature than<br/>
&gt; their counterparts of half a century ago. They also are more<br/>
&gt; sophisticated, thanks to rapid developments in mass communications and<br/>
&gt; the influence of unsavory elements in the media. Whether they are more<br/>
&gt; mature emotionally is debatable. Many are clever enough to admit, if<br/>
&gt; challenged, that they are sometimes tempted into risky behavior by the<br/>
&gt; knowledge that they will be treated lightly if they happen to get caught.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the youth of Japan are to be empowered to vote from the age of 18, a<br/>
&gt; step many other nations have already taken, then it stands to reason that<br/>
&gt; the Juvenile Law should be revised to apply to young people under that<br/>
&gt; age. Before this is done, however, any proposed revisions must be<br/>
&gt; discussed and debated in detail, with testimony provided by educators and<br/>
&gt; law-enforcement officials. Voters should not allow politicians to fall<br/>
&gt; back on hollow promises. Vague suggestions of cracking down on teenage<br/>
&gt; criminal behavior do not solve the problem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The issue is not simply the age of the culprits. The larger question is<br/>
&gt; why so many young people in this country now resort to violence so<br/>
&gt; easily. A recent survey of male junior and senior high school students by<br/>
&gt; the Management and Coordination Agency found that the older they are the<br/>
&gt; more likely they are to consider physically attacking their parents or<br/>
&gt; teachers. The National Police Agency has just reported that police<br/>
&gt; throughout the nation arrested 31 male juveniles suspected of murder or<br/>
&gt; attempted murder from the beginning of this year through the end of<br/>
&gt; April, double the number in the same period of 1999.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is all too easy, however, to use the threat of severer punishments as<br/>
&gt; a cure-all. Some youthful lawbreakers deserve and require time in<br/>
&gt; juvenile reformatories, or possibly even in adult prisons. The motives<br/>
&gt; for the violence and the warning signs that are often ignored by parents<br/>
&gt; and teachers need to be considered. Too-hasty moves to incarcerate young<br/>
&gt; miscreants with adult offenders will only succeed in turning more of them<br/>
&gt; into hardened criminals.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s not a mattress on a sprung or wooden base.  The mattress<br/>
&gt; itself is just fastened to legs, it&#39;s quite low that way.  It also means<br/>
&gt; that there&#39;s no frame to work around.  You can get castors for<br/>
&gt; them, but ours don&#39;t have them, I think they&#39;d drift about a bit (and<br/>
&gt; seeing as I&#39;m the one closest to the gap...)<br/>

&gt; Dawn --<br/>

&gt; He&#39;s in preschool?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So you could try it for a while and see how it works.  Keep him home.  Try<br/>
&gt; doing a few things.  We are going fishing today, for example.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; See if everyone likes it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since you are used to being out there in the corp world (even tho from home)<br/>
&gt; it may be an adjustment.  And your son may miss his little play buddies.<br/>
&gt; Maybe you could see how he adjusts and how you adjust.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then, in a year or 2, when K or 1st grade would be appropriate you could<br/>
&gt; reassess.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re having a ball (as I suspect) you could continue on and explore the<br/>
&gt; world and guide when you think it&#39;s important and follow your son&#39;s interests<br/>
&gt; when they take off and, this is big to me, get him a library card!, and turn<br/>
&gt; your house into the same kind of mess I&#39;m living in with books stacked<br/>
&gt; everywhere (but we&#39;re happy).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or not.  You could decide hsing just is not for you.  You long for the more<br/>
&gt; traditional, structured approach and think he would do better in school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since you seem to care so much about doing the right thing, I&#39;m sure you<br/>
&gt; will.  Whatever that turns out to be for you and yours.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck exploring.<br/>

&gt; Plus, diapers are way yuckier.  It was such an eye opener to me when my<br/>
&gt; son got to the point where food became a staple for him and I suddently<br/>
&gt; had to *think* about having snacks int he diaper bag and meals for him and<br/>
&gt; such.  For two years at least I didn&#39;t have to take food into<br/>
&gt; consideration for him and my older, more verbal son was good at letting me<br/>
&gt; know he needed to eat (which meant I really didn&#39;t have to think too much<br/>
&gt; about that--see a pattern here?).  This baby I&#39;m hoping will not eat<br/>

&gt; it depends, I guess.  My nickname (which is my ICQ screen<br/>
&gt; name) is Troggers, cos a friend at school had had a friend at the<br/>
&gt; previous school called Tracy Hoggers, so she got called troggers,<br/>
&gt; and so did I.  Considering the stereotypes connected with &#39;Tracy&#39;<br/>
&gt; (or Tracey) and awful way it sounds out loud (especially with an<br/>

&gt; Hi to all the newbies &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m Tracy, I live in Yorkshire, England<br/>
&gt; with my dh and 2 dd&#39;s, we work from home, we learn from home,<br/>
&gt; we live at home.  On the subject of reassuring folk, I&#39;ve never had<br/>
&gt; a problem with what my kids will learn.  If it&#39;s interesting to them,<br/>
&gt; and/or they need it for something, they&#39;ll learn it.  But I know<br/>
&gt; some folk need more structure in the way they live than I and<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s fine.  But kids have varying needs of structure too, and<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s nothing wrong with them deciding that, too, IMO &lt;G&gt;<br/>

&gt; Thanks for writing what you did.  It made me feel sick to think of him in a<br/>
&gt; traditional type of school or even being in school.  Since I wrote this last<br/>
&gt; night hubbie and I had a long talk way into the early hours and Zak is not<br/>
&gt; going back to pre-school.  Last night Zak told me a story about monsters and<br/>
&gt; I asked him if he&#39;d like to go to the library today to look for books on<br/>
&gt; monsters and on the computer.  He also suggested we could spend some time<br/>
&gt; drawing and coloring monsters and then we could drive around the neighborhood<br/>
&gt; (It&#39;s 110 here today in the desert) and look for them.  I&#39;m very open and<br/>
&gt; willing to do this an I guess this is what unschooling is all about.  The<br/>
&gt; baby (9months) is exploring walking now anyway and seems quite entertained by<br/>
&gt; his brother being here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll continue to be constantly concerned about both of them and &quot;the right<br/>

RE: Unschooling and homebase business<br/>
<br/>
Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
My son is 6 years old and I have been doing my own  business for over 4<br/>
years.  He&#39;s gotten<br/>
kind of used to it.  When I get a call I just tell him that it&#39;s a business<br/>
call and &quot;most&quot; of<br/>
the time he&#39;s patient.  I also talk to folks sometimes when we are out and<br/>
about and I&#39;m<br/>
looking for prospects, sometimes he does well, sometimes I slip him a<br/>
quarter for the nearby<br/>
gum ball machine.  I do more of my serious work in the evening a few nights<br/>
a week when my<br/>
husband is home.  I also keep in touch via e-mail to folks already with my<br/>
company or<br/>
interested in my company.  Right now, I&#39;m grabbing some time as my son is<br/>
playing with<br/>
neighbors in the back.  I always have to be alert and ready to any change.<br/>
I also have to<br/>
make sure I make time for my family.  It&#39;s also an interesting situation<br/>
when my son gets<br/>
really busy in the house and leaves &quot;projects, creations&quot; around the house,<br/>
when I&#39;m not<br/>
looking and on the phone.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Japanese editorial on crime by children<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi folks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s election time here in Japan, and you know what that means: more<br/>
&gt; clouding of the real issues at hand, tons of promises, and little or no<br/>
&gt; action taken to address the problems once all the noise is over.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Following is a newspaper editorial in today&#39;s Japan Times newspaper that<br/>
&gt; gives some idea of what those in official circles are thinking during<br/>
&gt; this election campaign about child-related crime.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I say &quot;official circles&quot; because despite its independent status, the<br/>
&gt; Japan Times is well-known for historically having a very cozy<br/>
&gt; relationship with the Japanese government. The paper has dutifully earned<br/>
&gt; its reputation as the &quot;mouthpiece&quot; of Japan&#39;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs<br/>
&gt; on just about every economic and political issue you can name. One of the<br/>
&gt; newspaper&#39;s past presidents, Mr. Shintaro Fukushima, in fact, has<br/>
&gt; formerly served as Japan&#39;s ambassador to the United Nations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But for what it&#39;s worth, here&#39;s the editorial. Not too surprisingly, the<br/>
&gt; article never delves into the influence that Japan&#39;s oppressive school<br/>
&gt; system has on the psyches of these so-called &quot;young miscreants.&quot; Oh well,<br/>
&gt; maybe in the next election....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I hear a campaign soundtruck coming up the<br/>
&gt; street, and I must go outside and get my daily dose of noise pollution.<br/>

&gt; EDITORIAL - The Japan Times<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; AGE IS NOT ALL THAT MATTERS<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With the volume favored by candidates&#39; loudspeaker cars, it can be<br/>
&gt; difficult to tell what issues they are addressing in the campaign leading<br/>
&gt; up to Sunday&#39;s election for the House of Representatives. Both the ruling<br/>
&gt; and opposition parties are engaging in the usual name-calling and<br/>
&gt; sloganeering and not giving more than superficial attention to some of<br/>
&gt; the main concerns of potential voters. One of these is the rising tide of<br/>
&gt; juvenile violence that parents, school authorities and the police all<br/>
&gt; seem powerless to control.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A number of heinous incidents this year have all involved 17-year-olds.<br/>
&gt; But as each day&#39;s news brings a fresh report of yet another case of<br/>
&gt; youthful criminal behavior, the age level of the perpetrators has dropped<br/>
&gt; to as low as 15 or even 14. Meanwhile, all the political parties are<br/>
&gt; mainly concentrating on the idea of lowering the age at which young<br/>
&gt; people legally become adults to 18 from the present 20. Prime Minister<br/>
&gt; Yoshiro Mori, campaigning nationwide for the Liberal Democratic Party and<br/>
&gt; its partners in the governing coalition, is having some success in<br/>
&gt; controlling his tendency to make provocative statements that embroil him<br/>
&gt; in instant controversy. He is putting the emphasis in stump speeches on<br/>
&gt; reducing the age at which minors can be tried in criminal courts for<br/>
&gt; serious offenses from 16 to 14.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This appears to be what all the parties have in mind, in the wake of the<br/>
&gt; public&#39;s disappointment at the failure of the regular Diet session, which<br/>
&gt; ended June 2, not only to pass but even to discuss the widely heralded<br/>
&gt; bill aimed at revising the Juvenile Law to better deal with the increase<br/>
&gt; in youthful crimes of violence. As a result, the bill was scrapped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The present Juvenile Law, which came into effect in 1949, stresses the<br/>
&gt; rehabilitation of young wrongdoers. The Family Court has jurisdiction<br/>
&gt; over cases involving young people under 20. Serious cases involving<br/>
&gt; youths 16 or older can be referred to prosecutors for handling in a<br/>
&gt; criminal court, although until recently this has rarely occurred.<br/>
&gt; Juveniles under the age of 14 who engage in acts that legally would be<br/>
&gt; considered criminal offenses are referred to a special consultation<br/>
&gt; office for children. But as the level of youthful violence has escalated,<br/>
&gt; and the types of crimes perpetrated have become more serious, many people<br/>
&gt; now believe the law is too lenient.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Young people in Japan today certainly are more physically mature than<br/>
&gt; their counterparts of half a century ago. They also are more<br/>
&gt; sophisticated, thanks to rapid developments in mass communications and<br/>
&gt; the influence of unsavory elements in the media. Whether they are more<br/>
&gt; mature emotionally is debatable. Many are clever enough to admit, if<br/>
&gt; challenged, that they are sometimes tempted into risky behavior by the<br/>
&gt; knowledge that they will be treated lightly if they happen to get caught.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the youth of Japan are to be empowered to vote from the age of 18, a<br/>
&gt; step many other nations have already taken, then it stands to reason that<br/>
&gt; the Juvenile Law should be revised to apply to young people under that<br/>
&gt; age. Before this is done, however, any proposed revisions must be<br/>
&gt; discussed and debated in detail, with testimony provided by educators and<br/>
&gt; law-enforcement officials. Voters should not allow politicians to fall<br/>
&gt; back on hollow promises. Vague suggestions of cracking down on teenage<br/>
&gt; criminal behavior do not solve the problem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The issue is not simply the age of the culprits. The larger question is<br/>
&gt; why so many young people in this country now resort to violence so<br/>
&gt; easily. A recent survey of male junior and senior high school students by<br/>
&gt; the Management and Coordination Agency found that the older they are the<br/>
&gt; more likely they are to consider physically attacking their parents or<br/>
&gt; teachers. The National Police Agency has just reported that police<br/>
&gt; throughout the nation arrested 31 male juveniles suspected of murder or<br/>
&gt; attempted murder from the beginning of this year through the end of<br/>
&gt; April, double the number in the same period of 1999.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is all too easy, however, to use the threat of severer punishments as<br/>
&gt; a cure-all. Some youthful lawbreakers deserve and require time in<br/>
&gt; juvenile reformatories, or possibly even in adult prisons. The motives<br/>
&gt; for the violence and the warning signs that are often ignored by parents<br/>
&gt; and teachers need to be considered. Too-hasty moves to incarcerate young<br/>
&gt; miscreants with adult offenders will only succeed in turning more of them<br/>
&gt; into hardened criminals.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s not a mattress on a sprung or wooden base.  The mattress<br/>

&gt; to what?  I guess she is going by the &quot;if they get hungry enough they will<br/>
&gt; eat&quot; theory?  I&#39;ve never understood this desire to get kids eating solid<br/>
&gt; food as then mom has to do more (and I try to do as little as possible).<br/>
&gt; Plus, diapers are way yuckier.  It was such an eye opener to me when my<br/>
&gt; son got to the point where food became a staple for him and I suddently<br/>
&gt; had to *think* about having snacks int he diaper bag and meals for him and<br/>
&gt; such.  For two years at least I didn&#39;t have to take food into<br/>
&gt; consideration for him and my older, more verbal son was good at letting me<br/>
&gt; know he needed to eat (which meant I really didn&#39;t have to think too much<br/>
&gt; about that--see a pattern here?).  This baby I&#39;m hoping will not eat<br/>

&gt; it depends, I guess.  My nickname (which is my ICQ screen<br/>
&gt; name) is Troggers, cos a friend at school had had a friend at the<br/>
&gt; previous school called Tracy Hoggers, so she got called troggers,<br/>
&gt; and so did I.  Considering the stereotypes connected with &#39;Tracy&#39;<br/>
&gt; (or Tracey) and awful way it sounds out loud (especially with an<br/>
&gt; accent) I had NO problem with this!<br/>

&gt; Sounds like a plan to me &lt;g&gt;  No, I see no big push either.  My<br/>

&gt; social exercise than anything.  She was sat in dd1&#39;s table-seat<br/>
&gt; (one fo those clanp-on numbers) at the table in a house we were<br/>
&gt; holidaying in, me, dh, our 2 kids, my il&#39;s and bil, bil&#39;s wife and dd.<br/>
&gt; bil&#39;s dw said &quot;Can anybody say &#39;where&#39;s my waitress???&#39;&quot;  We<br/>
&gt; got the hint then &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; Hi to all the newbies &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m Tracy, I live in Yorkshire, England<br/>
&gt; with my dh and 2 dd&#39;s, we work from home, we learn from home,<br/>
&gt; we live at home.  On the subject of reassuring folk, I&#39;ve never had<br/>
&gt; a problem with what my kids will learn.  If it&#39;s interesting to them,<br/>
&gt; and/or they need it for something, they&#39;ll learn it.  But I know<br/>
&gt; some folk need more structure in the way they live than I and<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s fine.  But kids have varying needs of structure too, and<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s nothing wrong with them deciding that, too, IMO &lt;G&gt;<br/>
