<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683417233">Be sure to check out the MHEA conference at Anne Arundel Community College<br/>
(located midway between Baltimore and Annapolis) on April 5, 2003 from 8:00<br/>
am to 5:30 pm. The keynote speaker is Jessie Wise, author of The Well<br/>
Trained Mind.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the keynote speech, there will be lots of workshops for new<br/>
homeschoolers as well as veteran homeschoolers. A panel of homeschool<br/>
couples will share their parenting experiences with homeschooling, there<br/>
will be a children&#39;s activities and games room, and lunch will be available<br/>
on the premises.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there will be a Local Support Group fair with representatives invited<br/>
from every support group in Maryland, a Resource Fair with a wide variety of<br/>
vendors offering homeschooling materials (FUN Books, www.FUN-Books.com, will<br/>
be there with lots of great materials - you can order in advance and pick up<br/>
at the conference to save shipping, or request specific items you want us to<br/>
bring for you to see), and there will be a used curriculum<br/>
sale/swap/give-away fair.<br/>
<br/>
