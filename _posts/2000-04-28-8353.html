 </span></blockquote>    I heard that the best way to give a child eye drops is not to open their<br/>
eye, but rather, just put the drops in the INSIDE CORNER of their eye with their<br/>
eye CLOSED - then have them blink several times.  (You would do this with the<br/>
child laying down.)  They get more of it in this way, and it&#39;s far more<br/>
comfortable for them, and less scary.  The drops feel better going into the eye<br/>
that way (on the whites) than they do on the iris or pupil (the white has no<br/>
feeling), and the blinking naturally spreads the drops around inside.<br/>
