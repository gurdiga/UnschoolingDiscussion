<div id="ygrps-yiv-479549817">Sorry Sandra?  I&#39;m on almost 30 lists, keeping names straight isn&#39;t easy, I<br/>
was close.   Bridget already pointed out how this converstaion got started.<br/>
You were telling us what &quot;good&quot; unschoolers do.  Quite personally, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t say unschooling is the only way a child should be educated.  That<br/>
is what works for my family.  I know many ecleteic homeschoolers, and their<br/>
kids are happy, and are turning out fine!  Same with attachment parenting,<br/>
it works wonders for some kids, and not for others.  Same as the TV, some<br/>
families love the thing, it just doesn&#39;t work for my family.  My family most<br/>
lives, I don&#39;t go looking for all these enriching activities, I don&#39;t need<br/>
to.  Same as the TV, I don&#39;t need to have incoming TV for my kids to be<br/>
enriched.  My oldest doesn&#39;t even have a huge interest in the TV, even when<br/>
he goes to grandpa&#39;s who have a satilite.  He&#39;s got way more important<br/>
things to do, like catch a loose chik that spent last night out in a<br/>
horrible storm, the poor thing.  Man when you got 29 of the buggars, keeping<br/>
a count is still almost impossibe.<br/>
