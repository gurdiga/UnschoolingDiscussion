&lt;&lt; My experience is the opposite.  When children realize that adults have<br/>
been lying to them about the easter bunny and Santa Claus,  they<br/>
inevitably wonder what else they have been lied to about.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have never seen this happen.<br/>
When I found out that my mom was Santa, I distinctly remember thinking<br/>
&quot;Wow...She&#39;s been doing all of that behind the scenes!&quot;<br/>
I felt incredible love for her at that moment, and it adds an element of joy<br/>
and wonder to my Santa-ing that I can&#39;t even express!  : )<br/>
<br/>
Not to get overly religious on a non-religious message board, but I think of<br/>
Heaven that way too. There&#39;s quite a bit going on that we don&#39;t understand<br/>
fully. One day we&#39;ll *get it.* It&#39;s ok with me. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Believing in santa *IS* christmas.  Once you dont belive any more the <br/>
excitment of christmas is much less  (until you have children in the <br/>
house again)<br/>
But I do know where you are coming from.  I hated the thought of <br/>
lying to my children - so I always said that Santa only came to those <br/>
who believed in him.......This was not a lie!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459667539">I have smart kids.  When the oldest one started asking if Santa was real, we <br/>
asked what he thought.  For about 2 more years he still declared his belief <br/>
in Santa.  We noticed that he still enjoyed the Santa ritual even after he <br/>
knew the truth.  It seemed reassuring to him to know that the adults in his <br/>
life loved him enough to play along.  Also helped make us more accessible to <br/>
him because we were operating on a child level.  That child is 22 now.<br/>
<br/>
Next kidlet still won&#39;t admit anything less than Santa is real.  Does not <br/>
want to deal with his loss.  He&#39;s 12 this year.  He&#39;s savvy enough that he <br/>
literally tells me he doesn&#39;t want to talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, same kid will go out of his way to be Santa for someone else.  He <br/>
knows.  But he loves the fun of anonymous gift giving which is attributed to <br/>
Santa.  You never know who really took the time to find the &#39;whatever&#39; you <br/>
got from Santa.  Could be anyone around you.  Nice to know there are people <br/>
who love you.  I think Santa gives the older child or adult the opportunity <br/>
to count their blessings.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">When I was growing up, and found out my parents had 
lied to me, and the whole adult world had lied to me, I was devistated. I 
believe that stories that have good meaning should be told just like that as 
stories.&nbsp; We have always told our son that Christmas was a time when the 
people who loved you &amp; who you loved shared gifts to symbolize the love we 
have.&nbsp; That there is no Santa, and that Santa is a story about giving , 
without selfishness or the want of return, just out of pure Love , to show 
someone you care.&nbsp; I do not think it is right to lie to my child, that 
something exists or occurs that does not,a nd doing so would take away from the 
real meaning of what we do when we send a&nbsp; gift far across the country to 
Grandma or Grandpa, or another family member.&nbsp; GIving itself, and Loving 
others itself, is magickal enough not to be distorted by truth &amp; lies.&nbsp; 
I know it was all intended in good fun, but the stories originated by an actual 
person who used to walk through the streets giving gifts to people.&nbsp; I like 
to emphasize the &quot;Giving&quot;, in the &quot;WInter&quot; when times were sometimes harder, it 
meant more to have a meal with family.&nbsp; ANd there are so many magickal , 
wonderous things going on around us every day..the change of the seasons, the 
birth of a small cuddly animal, the returning of dead Poppy stalk to the earth 
to nourish the seeds that have fallen in the patch..WHy dull these truly 
Magickal occurences.&nbsp; What more do we truly need to add to enhance 
life?&nbsp; I believe it is all in the finding of what is fascinating &amp; 
magickal in the everyday world that is important.&nbsp; </font></div>

 </span></blockquote>Life is full of mysteries, things we do not understand or cannot explain.  I do not think that sharing the tradition of Santa Claus with a child is a destructive thing.  It depends upon how it is shared, and how the child learns the true nature of Santa when they are old enough to grasp the abstract concept of the spirit of giving.  Is a it a secret deception that the child &quot;finds out&quot; and feels betrayed about?  Or is it a special sharing between parent and child that reinforces the message behind the fantasy and brings the child lovingly into the circle of giver, as well as reciever?  It only becomes a lie if you believe you are lying.  <br/>
<br/>
If you believe everything that you tell your child about it, you are not lying.  It is believeing in intangibles, in the energy created by the belief of so many people around the world that makes a thing real.  If I tell my child &quot;I believe in Santa&quot; that is true.  I don&#39;t tell my children that Santa lives in the North Pole, but if I say that &quot;Santa can be everywhere that he is believed in&quot;  that is true and what I believe, and also &quot;Santa comes to the homes of everyone who believes in him, everywhere, during the holidays&quot; because Santa is in all our hearts as an embodiment of our holiday spirit, and comes into our homes as he comes into our hearts.  None of these are lies.  I don&#39;t lie to my children, ever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-727387576">We do Santa.  Seemed impossible to avoid, and I was not totally comfortable <br/>
with excluding ds (now 4 yo) from that bit of our culture.  When he has asked <br/>
if Santa is real I say something like, He isn&#39;t real like you and me, but he is <br/>
a spirit of giving and we can be part of Santa when we give.  We&#39;re planning <br/>
to give someone something &quot;in secret&quot; this Christmas so we can be &quot;part of <br/>
Santa.&quot;  So I am just gradually broadening out the Santa image to be a <br/>
personification of the spirit of giving.  I think I got this idea from &quot;Living Joyfully <br/>
with Children&quot; by Win and Bill Sweet.  Ds seems to get this very well and then <br/>
any &quot;deceptions&quot; I have already practiced are just me being part of Santa.  <br/>
Which makes sense to me anyway.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, ds attributes quite a lot to Santa.  We were talking about whether <br/>
parents choose their children or children choose their parents (i.e. before birth). <br/>
 Ds didn&#39;t think so.  When I asked him how the choice gets made, then, his <br/>
immediately response was that Santa decides!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021431257">My dh and I had a hard time with this.  He *really* was against Santa.  I<br/>
loved Santa as a kid and pretended I believed for quite sometime after I<br/>
knew the reality.  We ended up just not making a big deal out of it<br/>
ourselves and the Grandmas have sent presents from Santa.  Last year I got<br/>
him to agree to do one each for the kids and I was like - &#39;Look! these are<br/>
from Santa!&#39; and Harriet was looking at me like, &#39;yeah, and?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been thinking lately. Of course this comes after I already<br/>
&gt; had my daughter believing in Santa Claus. She loves fantasy and is always to<br/>
&gt; blur the boundaries between reality and fantasy but she likes to know the<br/>
&gt; boundaries first. I&#39;m feeling pretty guilty that I&#39;ve constructed this false<br/>
&gt; character for my daughter. It doesn&#39;t mesh with the honesty and trust that are<br/>
&gt; part <br/>
&gt; of unschooling for me.<br/>
&gt; So a question...I would like the Santa thing to end with Cahterine and not<br/>
&gt; have Harry believing it as well. Has anyone else dug themselves out of the<br/>
&gt; Santa <br/>
&gt; mess after their child already believed?<br/>
&gt; I know this will confirm with my relatives that I&#39;m a hippie freak and with<br/>
&gt; my in-laws that I&#39;m out to spoil all the fun but I&#39;m finally getting to the<br/>
&gt; point where their opinions don&#39;t mean diddly where it runs counter to my<br/>
&gt; daughter&#39;s interests.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ********************************<br/>
&gt; Well, we love Santa, and Julian believed, at least a little, until he was 11.<br/>
&gt; He&#39;d certainly been exposed to questions, but he let go when he wanted to. I<br/>
&gt; consider that one of the greatest gifts we&#39;ve had with unschooling... no<br/>
&gt; pressure to let go before he wanted to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s fantasy, and play, and magic.<br/>

This seems to be the &quot;norm&quot; among unschoolers. I was surprised that so many  <br/>
chimed in in FAVOR of Santa! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We really do up the Santa thang. I  have a friend that dresses up and visits <br/>
the hospitals and children&#39;s homes. He  comes here too. We &quot;find&quot; elves <br/>
whenever we trim the tree. We have leprechauns  that wreak havoc on March 17th. That <br/>
pesky tooth fairy sprinkles fairy dust  *everywhere*. And the Easter Bunny <br/>
leaves bunny poop and bunny dust all over the  house, along with all those eggs. <br/>
We&#39;ve kept canisters of &quot;Monster-Be-Gone&quot; in  the cupboard and once outfitted <br/>
Cameron&#39;s room to keep the vampires away (&quot;holy&quot;  water, crosses, garlic).<br/>
 <br/>
We also play up National Pie Day and Elephant Day and a bunch of other  <br/>
&quot;holidays&quot;. We love the fantasy of it all. It&#39;s all done in fun with no malice  <br/>
intended, so the fun overshadows the &quot;lies&quot;----but none of us consider it lying.  <br/>
It&#39;s fantasy---no different than living in Harry Potter-land or Hobbit-world <br/>
or  Metropolis/Gotham City. It doesn&#39;t last long, so we enjoy it while we can. <br/>
They  grow up so fast.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771847384">I&#39;m conflicted about the whole Santa thing.<br/>
 <br/>
When the kids were very small I never considered not playing out the Santa<br/>
fantasy.  I love Santa!  I still remember when I found out he was fantasy.<br/>
I was in third grade and the kids went around the table asking if you<br/>
believed in Santa.  No one said yes, and I didn&#39;t either.  But that was the<br/>
first time I questioned it.  I asked my mother and she said that if I didn&#39;t<br/>
believe, he wouldn&#39;t come.  I&#39;ve believed ever since.  ;0)  I didn&#39;t feel<br/>
betrayed by my mother at all, though. <br/>
 <br/>
Then one day I was talking with a cousin who also homeschools her children<br/>
and she said she told her kids from the start that Santa wasn&#39;t real.  At<br/>
first I thought it was awful for her to ruin the fantasy part of Christmas<br/>
but after giving it some thought I started to feel bad that I had lied to my<br/>
children about this, but been very honest with them in all other regards.<br/>
The reason she told her kids from the start that Santa was fantasy is<br/>
because she felt like she was the last one to learn the truth and she felt<br/>
her mother had lied to her.  She lived next to the school and one day in 5th<br/>
grade all the kids were saying that Santa wasn&#39;t real.  She went home and<br/>
asked her mother and her mother didn&#39;t tell her the truth and she went back<br/>
to school and argued it with the kids.  In the end she ended up feeling<br/>
stupid and lied to.   (If my kids asked, I would either tell them the truth,<br/>
though.)<br/>
 <br/>
Over the years it has seemed like I&#39;ve had to keep lying and changing the<br/>
lies to keep it under wraps.  (or sometimes I just say I don&#39;t know...this<br/>
is what happened when I was little.)  Over the last few years I&#39;ve tried not<br/>
to lie outright about Santa but put it a little differently......&quot;we&#39;d<br/>
better get to bed, *they say* Santa only comes when you are fast asleep.&quot;<br/>
(kind of like Sandra mentioned.)  <br/>
 <br/>
From the time the kids were small we had gifts from Santa and gifts from us.<br/>
Santa fills the stockings and leaves a few small gifts and the rest is from<br/>
us.  I can&#39;t really change that now but it has always been confusing for me<br/>
because I can never remember what gifts were from Santa and what were from<br/>
us, after the fact.  So two months later when a mom asks me where we got<br/>
something, I&#39;m likely to say enthusiastically, oh, I got that on ebay for<br/>
only $5, to which my children pipe up...&quot;no you didn&#39;t, we got that from<br/>
Santa!&quot; Agh!!!   I&#39;ve done that more times than I care to mention.  I am<br/>
getting better at saying &quot;we got it for Christmas, (and tell the details<br/>
later)  but I still forget in my enthusiasm to share a good idea or good<br/>
deal.)  My kids have always asked why we need to give to charities at<br/>
Christmas time.  Doesn&#39;t Santa give presents to everyone?   Having gifts<br/>
from both Santa and us made it easier to answer that question...Santa only<br/>
fills stocking and brings a few small gifts, but the kids seem to think<br/>
they&#39;d be perfectly happy with just the Santa gifts, so why isn&#39;t everyone<br/>
else? <br/>
 <br/>
But as my oldest gets older (she&#39;s almost 10) I have begun to worry more<br/>
about her learning the truth and feeling betrayed.  Obviously, she doesn&#39;t<br/>
go to school so she won&#39;t be questioned there.  She has one very close<br/>
friend who also believes.  She also plays with cousins somewhat regularly<br/>
but I am not sure if they would talk about that.  Will she ever learn the<br/>
truth or will I have to sneak into her house when she is grown up to deliver<br/>
presents to her kids?  LOL!  She is very analytical so part of me wonders if<br/>
she didn&#39;t figure it out years ago and just wants to believe so badly that<br/>
she&#39;s willing to overlook the inconsistencies.  If she asks for the truth I<br/>
will certainly tell her but until both my girls know I think I will feel a<br/>
little unease somewhere in the back of my mind about it.  I wish I&#39;d been a<br/>
little more mysterious about it instead of seeming like I had the facts when<br/>
they were smaller.  I did tell them that the santas in stores are not the<br/>
real Santa....but that feels like a lie too, for goodness sakes.  (it<br/>
indicates that there is a *real* Santa.)  <br/>
 <br/>
I love z&quot;Yes Virginia, There is a Santa Claus&quot; and I&#39;ve always thought I&#39;d<br/>
read that to the kids when they question me.  Sometimes thing happen off the<br/>
cuff here though and I forget what I&#39;ve planned.  We&#39;ll see, I guess.<br/>

Occasionally someone in the family pipes up that Santa might not come if my daughter keeps something up but I give them the evil eye. Catherine is firm in her belief that Santa loves all kids and would not do something so cruel as to leave coal or sticks. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598503284">I remember when I was young, there was a family we knew consisting of a <br/>
single mom and 3 boys.  She wasn&#39;t a very nice woman and every <br/>
Christmas didn&#39;t get the kids any gifts.  She told the kids that Santa <br/>
didn&#39;t bring them any toys because they were bad boys!  I just remember <br/>
feeling so bad for them, because they weren&#39;t bad kids.  They were just <br/>
your typical energetic boys.<br/>

From the  time the kids were small we had gifts from Santa and gifts from us.<br/>
Santa  fills the stockings and leaves a few small gifts and the rest is  from<br/>
us.  I can&#39;t really change that now but it has always been  confusing for me<br/>
because I can never remember what gifts were from Santa  and what were from<br/>
us, after the fact.  So two months later when a mom  asks me where we got<br/>
something, I&#39;m likely to say enthusiastically, oh, I  got that on ebay for<br/>
only $5, to which my children pipe up...&quot;no you  didn&#39;t, we got that from<br/>
Santa!&quot; Agh!!!   I&#39;ve done that more  times than I care to mention.  I am<br/>
getting better at saying &quot;we got  it for Christmas, (and tell the details<br/>
later)  but I still forget in  my enthusiasm to share a good idea or good<br/>
deal.)  My kids have always  asked why we need to give to charities at<br/>
Christmas time.  Doesn&#39;t  Santa give presents to everyone?   Having gifts<br/>
from both Santa  and us made it easier to answer that question...Santa only<br/>
fills stocking  and brings a few small gifts, but the kids seem to think<br/>
they&#39;d be  perfectly happy with just the Santa gifts, so why isn&#39;t everyone<br/>
else?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
To keep things straight Christmas morning, I&#39;ve wrapped everything from  <br/>
Santa in &quot;Santa paper&quot;---and each person has a different wrapping paper---easier  <br/>
to tell whose is whose. Santa&#39;s gifts have factory-made sticky bows. I wrap <br/>
all  gifts from our family in plainer paper---either red or white or brown with <br/>
huge  handmade bows. Most of our family gifts are books, clothes, and handmade <br/>
items.  Santa gives stockings, toys, techno-gifts, and big things---like <br/>
bikes or  trampolines (no books or clothes). Again, easier to decipher.<br/>
 <br/>
When they start figuring that all other kids *should* get presents from  <br/>
Santa---well, to me, that&#39;s the natural time that they figure the whole  thing <br/>
out. Other kids start talking and they start questioning. It&#39;s easy  for them to <br/>
connect the dots.<br/>

In Germany (where Cameron was born) they celebrate St Nicholaus Day on Dec  <br/>
6th. The children leave their shoes out, and St Nicholaus comes by and fills <br/>
the  shoes with fruit, nuts, and chocolate. His sidekick, Schwarze Peter, leaves <br/>
 coal and switches. So we celebrate St Nicholaus Day here too----just extends <br/>
 Christmas!  I make tiny bundles of licorice, wrapped in ribbon, to  <br/>
symbolize switches. We also cut and trim our tree on the 6th.<br/>
 <br/>
I have tiny pieces of coal wrapped in red tissue that Santa slips into the  <br/>
stockings---just for all the folks that ask whether they got coal and switches. <br/>
 The boys can say, &quot;YES! I got a lump of coal!&quot; Most people freak out---and  <br/>
the boys love the reactions. They always look inside for their coal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-376980502">I had the whole Santa thing going on when I was a little kid. Don&#39;t really remember when or how I found out he didn&#39;t really come. My dad even had a friend dress up and come to our house and my mom woke me up and we even got a picture of &quot;Santa.&quot; Years later, after all grown up, whenever I saw that guy, I called him Santa! Never remember me finding out the truth as being something negative.<br/>
<br/>
So naturally when my first was born, we did the whole Santa thing too. Of course she was so different than I was and questioned everything. So at the time, the only thing I knew to do was answer her questions while still keeping the magic of the man. Well her questions were incredible and I made up elaborate stories to cover. It wasn&#39;t until Tara was almost 13 that we all realized she still thought there was a Santa. She wasn&#39;t mad at me or anything but still remembers how she felt when she found out. It really was an accident as we all just thought she knew the truth by that time.<br/>
<br/>
So when second child came along, I was adamant about not lying and doing the whole Santa thing. My husband wasn&#39;t happy but I insisted. We didn&#39;t say there wasn&#39;t a Santa, just never said there was. Somewhere along the way when Joseph was about 4, he started the whole Santa thing himself. Of course his year younger sister went along with whatever he believed. By that time I was smarter and asked them what they thought. I let them figure out what they wanted to believe. <br/>
<br/>
So now at almost 10, 9 and 4, the 3 little ones believe there is a Santa. Not to the extent where it consumes them like it did my first child though. Any questions are answered by them once we talk about it. <br/>
<br/>
Santa fills stockings for them and brings one gift for each left under the tree not wrapped. He also brings one thing for all 3 younger children to share. Like last year it was the Toss Across game. Santa doesn&#39;t do adults which means not our oldest then either. Kids just kind of said he only does little ones. <br/>
<br/>
So even though I tried to not do Santa, the kids seem to want to believe in a certain degree of him. At the same time, they also know people dress up like Santa just to play fun. I figure with them, they will eventually come up with other answers on their own. This way it&#39;s much more comfortable for me than the first go around and I think it&#39;s healthier for my kids too.<br/>

 The kids love it cuz it turns their mouths and teeth pitch black and they <br/>
love sticking out their tongues and showing it off :o)  I think it&#39;s called a <br/>
&quot;Lump of Coal&quot; candy.  Not real easy to find but it goes a long way and sure is <br/>
fun.  I can&#39;t stand the taste of black licorice but it&#39;s worth it for the day. <br/>
 And for switches we use &quot;pixie sticks&quot; and roll them once with brown paper <br/>
and tape or glue them and then they look like sticks.<br/>

the night and leave presents. They think that is creepy. They never <br/>
spoiled the idea of Santa for other kids - they got it that this was <br/>
something the kids WANTED to believe in and they didn&#39;t mess it up for <br/>
them.<br/>
