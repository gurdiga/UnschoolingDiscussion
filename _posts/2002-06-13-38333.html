<br/>
I&#39;d like to see more answers to one of your questions:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;19. What, in your opinion, have been the greatest benefits of homeschooling<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for you/your family?<br/>
A. Benefits: Mutual respect; happiness; trust; a lasting good understanding<br/>
between parents and child. As for academics, schools can&#39;t touch<br/>
homeschooling by conscientious parents. &lt;&lt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230174488">**I think a lot of people THINK we&#39;re telling them that, if they let<br/>
their kids<br/>
have real freedom to choose, their kids will regain their love of<br/>
learning<br/>
(which is true), and that they&#39;ll choose to learn the same kinds of<br/>
things in<br/>
the same kinds of ways that schools try to teach (which is highly<br/>
unlikely).**<br/>
<br/>
Pam, this is a good point.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve sometimes fallen into the error looking for ways to hook into<br/>
school subjects.  I sit around wringing my hands because my son doesn&#39;t<br/>
have interests like The Civil War or Astronomy.  I was overlooking the<br/>
fact that Pokemon is an interest.  Just because the state of California<br/>
doesn&#39;t think kids have to learn about Pokemon and be tested on it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that Pokemon isn&#39;t an interest that I can encourage.<br/>

I just don&#39;t see public school siblings being as good of friends as my daughters are with each other.    I enjoy the freedom of using whatever resources I want to help &quot;teach&quot; a specific topic.  No text books, but historical fiction, biographies, videos, field trips.  MUCH more interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-405179919"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;All good answers --- are they &quot;expecting&quot; the radical unschooling point of <br/>
&gt;&gt;view? I&#39;m also giving a talk this week (along with someone else) to people <br/>
&gt;&gt;just considering homeschooling and we always struggle with how much to <br/>
&gt;&gt;make it unschooling-based versus how much to just be more objective and <br/>
&gt;&gt;tell them about all the different ways homeschoolers homeschool.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have this dilemma every time a schooler comes to me with thoughts of <br/>
taking their kids out of school. I always want to talk up unschooling. <br/>
However, while they&#39;re still in the school system I&#39;m afraid that this much <br/>
freedom will just scare them away. The idea that learning is not divided <br/>
into neat little subject areas is a true eye opener to most people. Too <br/>
frightening and feeing to be true, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been using my kids as an example most of the time. If I sense the <br/>
parents are getting too uncomfortable, I&#39;ll throw in the idea that lots of <br/>
parents start out with an eclectic style or with unit studies. That seems to <br/>
make them breathe easier. I can&#39;t make myself suggest anything more <br/>
structured than that.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>

<br/>
What I suggest is for them to wait a while before buying a curriculum and <br/>
they might decide they don&#39;t really  need one.  Then if they ask me more <br/>
about that I can talk about unschooling.  If they don&#39;t I just cross my <br/>
fingers and hope they&#39;ll figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
(That&#39;s for the phone calls from people who got my phone number from the <br/>
library or some such.)<br/>

asked to learn was french!! LOL LOL<br/>
It didn&#39;t last too long, we learned about Impressionist art, went to the art <br/>
museum, learn some basic phrases, all around the time my mom went to Paris. I <br/>
am thinking she may become ready for asking for more in the future. I enjoyed <br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; her a little because i took 4 years in high school and i remember <br/>
what i enjoyed learning :0)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; jumping in this thread a tad late, but one of the first things my <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This made me think... I can&#39;t remember Rain ever asking to learn anything<br/>
- she just does it. The things she&#39;ll ask for are very specific, things<br/>
she&#39;s decided she needs in order to learn what she wants to learn. She<br/>
asks me to show her how to knit again, or download the lyrics for a song<br/>
from the net, or make sure we&#39;re home at a certain time to watch a show<br/>
on Joan of Arc, or get books on a orphan trains at the library. I think<br/>
the idea of coming up to me and saying, &quot;I want to learn French&quot; would<br/>
never occur to her, she&#39;d be more likely to come and ask if I knew where<br/>
the Rosetta Stone demo CD was, or if we had any books in French, or if we<br/>
had any friends who spoke French. <br/>
<br/>
This may be a personality thing. She&#39;s always been the kind of kid who<br/>
decides what she wants and goes about getting it, and trying to guide or<br/>
steer her at all is iffy. Even if her plans are unrealistic, she usually<br/>
has to discover this for herself before she&#39;ll take much advice from me.<br/>
OTOH, sometimes things I think are beyond her capabilities turn out to be<br/>
things she does quite successfully, so perhaps she&#39;s right to ignore me<br/>
sometimes :-)<br/>
