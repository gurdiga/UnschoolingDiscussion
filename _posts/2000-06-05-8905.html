<div id="ygrps-yiv-939351755">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a news story that came out today on the dumbing down of Japanese <br/>
students and how the private-sector market is getting a piece of this <br/>
action.<br/>
<br/>
Japan&#39;s Ministry of Education just can&#39;t get any respect these days: On <br/>
one side are the educators and critics who blast the ministry&#39;s idea of <br/>
cutting school hours and other &quot;reforms&quot; as mere window dressing that <br/>
won&#39;t even come close to solving the nation&#39;s ongoing educational crises.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are the other educators and critics who claim just the <br/>
opposite, that what public schools in Japan need from the Education <br/>
Ministry is not less, but MORE: more school hours, more regulations for <br/>
students, more resources for more teachers.<br/>
<br/>
It is from a position of sympathy with this latter camp that Ms. <br/>
Kinoshita, the author of the following piece, seems to be writing.<br/>

KYOTO ACADEMIA TURNS TO PRIVATE SECTOR FOR HELP<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
KYOTO -- The nation&#39;s university education system has entered a time of <br/>
change. Students&#39; academic abilities have worsened noticeably as a result <br/>
of the reduction in educational content taught at high schools, which <br/>
have recently been set the goal of giving students more breathing room. <br/>
In addition, universities are seeing students exhibit the behavior of <br/>
high school students, such as skipping classes and not showing the kind <br/>
of maturity they previously exhibited upon becoming university students.<br/>
<br/>
More change is on the horizon: In 2009, the decreasing child population <br/>
will reach college-entrance age. When that time comes, virtually all of <br/>
them will be able to attend university if they wish, as universities are <br/>
expected to experience a sharp fall in the number of applicants. This <br/>
will undoubtedly heat up competition among universities to acquire a <br/>
sufficient number of students to support their operations. Some <br/>
universities have already moved to take up the challenge, and Kyoto&#39;s <br/>
Ryukoku University is one of them. Students in the university&#39;s economics <br/>
department are currently taking classes in mathematics -- which in itself <br/>
is nothing unusual.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s unusual is that the class is taught by a teacher dispatched from <br/>
Sundai Yobi Gakko, one of the nation&#39;s leading college-entrance prep <br/>
schools. &quot;You break up a number into numbers that can&#39;t be divided any <br/>
more. This process is called factorizing into prime factors. Take the <br/>
number six for example: Its prime factors are two and three,&quot; Shinichiro <br/>
Ochiai, the Sundai instructor, told one of his classes of about 30 <br/>
students, who nodded to show they understood. <br/>
<br/>
The class was part of a project started this spring as part of an <br/>
initiative of the University Consortium Kyoto, which consists of 48 <br/>
universities and junior colleges in Kyoto Prefecture. Seven universities <br/>
currently hold classes taught by instructors from outside of academia to <br/>
help students acquire the basic necessary skills that they failed to <br/>
acquire while in high school. <br/>
<br/>
Ochiai&#39;s class is well received by the Ryukoku freshmen, one of whom <br/>
said: &quot;His teaching is to the point, and it&#39;s easy to understand.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
But he is disturbed by the surprisingly low skills of his students. <br/>
<br/>
In one of his classes, Ochiai wrote out 10 equation and graph <br/>
interpretation problems. One problem was:<br/>
<br/>
0.125x plus 2/5 equals 7/8 <br/>
<br/>
which was something the students were supposed to have learned in the <br/>
first year of middle school. But despite Ochiai&#39;s remark -- &quot;Just relax <br/>
and enjoy solving it&quot; -- they apparently could not. They seemed slow in <br/>
working through the problem in their notebooks. In fact, only half of <br/>
them managed to solve it. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m shocked their skills are so low. It&#39;s much worse than simply <br/>
forgetting formulas they had learned,&quot; Ochiai said. &quot;It seems to me they <br/>
lack the ability to think logically. I&#39;m now worried about the future of <br/>
Japan. I&#39;m not exaggerating.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ochiai&#39;s class continues for the first half of this year, and by the 12th <br/>
and final class, his plan said the students would have understood <br/>
economic theories using differential and integral calculus. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, I do hope to get to at least teach differential calculus,&quot; Ochiai <br/>
said. <br/>
<br/>
Declining academic ability is not a problem that is limited to <br/>
mathematics. <br/>
<br/>
Seian College of Art and Design in Nagaoka-kyo in the prefecture holds a <br/>
credit course teaching plain old Japanese, just to prop up the students&#39; <br/>
often shaky skills in their native tongue. <br/>
<br/>
In the first class this spring, Naoki Kamisaka was teaching how to write <br/>
a self-introduction. The class started virtually from the basics of <br/>
writing, and thus included such instructions as &quot;Leave the first square <br/>
open for an indentation&quot; on the Japanese manuscript sheets provided. Four <br/>
hundred squares are printed on each sheet, and each square is filled by a <br/>
character or a punctuation mark. <br/>
<br/>
Indeed, Kamisaka, who was dispatched from the Japanese-language and <br/>
writing section of Kawai-juku, another leading college-entrance prep <br/>
school, detected a problem in students&#39; writing ability. <br/>
<br/>
After he collected the 40 or so students&#39; written papers, he noticed that <br/>
they had just written down their thoughts the way they would say them. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have a feeling young people&#39;s writing skills are affected by writing <br/>
e-mail,&quot; Kamisaka said. &quot;They are good at dragging on and on about <br/>
whatever pops into their mind, but they aren&#39;t good at saying what they <br/>
want to say in a logical, organized way.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Kamisaka said that, from the second class on, he would present the <br/>
students with model texts and teach uses of conjunctions such as &quot;mazu&quot; <br/>
(first) and &quot;ippo&quot; (meanwhile). Kamisaka usually teaches test-taking <br/>
techniques for college entrance applicants in Kawai-juku&#39;s fast-paced <br/>
classes, but for Seian students he plans to go slowly, teaching one theme <br/>
per class to make sure his students learn to express themselves well in <br/>
writing. <br/>
<br/>
According to a survey by the Education Ministry, 43 state-run <br/>
universities and 56 private universities conducted courses to boost <br/>
students&#39; basic skills in 1998. But the consortium&#39;s project is the first <br/>
of its kind as it involves multiple universities. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s a costly undertaking for a single university, but since we have a <br/>
concentration of universities and colleges in Kyoto, we thought we would <br/>
be able to conduct the supplementary courses through a cooperative <br/>
scheme,&quot; said Hiroshi Yamaguchi, an official of the consortium. &quot;And the <br/>
important thing for us was to try this idea we came up with.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;At first, faculty members taught supplementary courses, but it seemed <br/>
too hard for us to cope with the situation,&quot; said Prof. Susumu Misaki of <br/>
Ryukoku&#39;s economics department. &quot;And university teachers don&#39;t have the <br/>
necessary experience to conduct supplementary courses. So in the end, we <br/>
decided to enlist outside help.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The consortium&#39;s project also involves courses taught not only by <br/>
prep-school teachers, but other private educational experts. <br/>
<br/>
Starting from the latter half of this academic year, the junior college <br/>
of Otani University in Kyoto&#39;s Kita Ward is going to offer a course in <br/>
verbal communication, including vocal exercises, by an instructor <br/>
dispatched from an Osaka temporary-employment agency, which usually <br/>
offers such courses for company employees as part of in-company training. <br/>
The Department of Food Science and Nutrition at Doshisha Women&#39;s College <br/>
of Liberal Arts in Kyo-tanabe in the prefecture will have the Nihongo <br/>
Bunsho Noryoku Kentei Kyokai (Society for Testing Skills in Written <br/>
Japanese) dispatch instructors to teach basic writing skills. <br/>
<br/>
Experts seem to be divided over whether to view the consortium&#39;s <br/>
initiative as a favorable development or representing a lamentable <br/>
situation in university education. <br/>
<br/>
Kazuo Nishimura, who wrote about university students&#39; declining academic <br/>
abilities in &quot;Bunsu ga Dekinai Daigakusei&quot; (University Students Who Can&#39;t <br/>
Handle Fractions), which he coauthored, views the Kyoto institutions&#39; <br/>
move favorably. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Universities usually try to strike a pose as proud institutions, and it <br/>
must have been a difficult decision for the (Kyoto) universities and <br/>
colleges to enlist outside help,&quot; said Nishimura, a professor at Kyoto <br/>
University&#39;s Institute of Economic Research. &quot;They faced the reality of <br/>
the situation bravely and made a courageous decision. These universities <br/>
and colleges are working together, and that helps make things work <br/>
better. It will also help them solve other problems that may crop up.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
But Prof. Hidenori Fujita of Tokyo University&#39;s School of Education sees <br/>
the situation as evidence that universities are not fulfilling their <br/>
functions. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;These schools seem to have first accepted students, and then told them, <br/>
&#39;You must learn a few more things (to be able to learn what we teach),&#39; <br/>
and that&#39;s like putting the cart before the horse,&quot; Fujita said. &quot;For <br/>
sure, the current situation is one result of the nation&#39;s education <br/>
system going wrong, and I recognize the need for complementary courses <br/>
like theirs.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;But when you get down to the bottom of things, universities must make <br/>
clear what they want high schools to teach their prospective applicants, <br/>
and make their entrance requirements clear,&quot; Fujita said. <br/>
<br/>
The Kyoto universities pay 12,000 yen per class for the complementary <br/>
courses, and 200,000 yen for the development of each course. Though it is <br/>
not yet clear whether this is a worthwhile investment, one thing is clear <br/>
-- as an instructor at one of the prep schools involved put it: &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
pretty sure this market for supplementary college courses is going to <br/>
grow.&quot; <br/>
