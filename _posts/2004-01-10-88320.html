 </span></blockquote>We have a similar situation, my 12yro son Tom is musical guy, he took violin <br/>
lessons a few years ago for about 6 mos but got interested in piano so the <br/>
same teacher would play around with him during the lesson with both the piano and <br/>
the violin. Eventually he decided that he didn&#39;t want anymore lessons at that <br/>
time but liked the teacher (and she liked him) and felt bad at leaving her.<br/>
<br/>
Last year he thought he might like more piano lessons so we caled a lady in <br/>
our neighborhood but she had a waiting list which we put his name on and found <br/>
another teacher. Whoa, the application alone felt like a college application <br/>
and she made learning the piano look like a lot of work to me, Tom went 2 weeks <br/>
and asked if he could stop so I let him. <br/>
<br/>
The lady in the neighborhood called so he tried a few lessons with her and <br/>
still opted to go it alone. He has added the electric guitar to his collection <br/>
and is quite content having dad show him a few cords and figuring the rest out <br/>
on his own. He will play the piano a while then leave it alone. A friend came <br/>
over with her kids one day and one of her boys showed him the rest of a song <br/>
he had been picking out. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve offered lessons on either instrument if he wants them. It&#39;s just <br/>
interesting to watch the progression. I am glad he is adament that he doesn&#39;t want <br/>
lessons if he doesn&#39;t. So many people think that just because you like something <br/>
or are good at it you should run and take a lesson and I admit that was my <br/>
first thought but my son has taught me otherwise. <br/>
<br/>
He also taught me how to give time for an answer, when he was learning to <br/>
read he would read out loud to me, if he got stuck on a word I would right away <br/>
tell it to him. He would get so angry and tell me to let him figure it out and <br/>
if he wanted help he would ask. We still do it that way and I have even had to <br/>
tell my mom to wait which she hated, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are good teachers, <br/>
