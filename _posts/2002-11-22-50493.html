<div id="ygrps-yiv-533381708">Well we had our 15 minutes of fame today after about 6 1/2 hours!!! That&#39;s <br/>
how long I had camera, light, audio men and a producer in my house. It was <br/>
tiring. They rearranged my entire living room and computer room. Nice as <br/>
they were, they put it all back right where they found everything. They were <br/>
a very nice bunch of guys. The producer was very sweet and patient. Tara was <br/>
nervous and I just kept thinking about all the other stuff I wanted to do! <br/>
The 3 younger kids were great all day. They shot 4 tapes and took pictures <br/>
too. All this for maybe 2 minutes of tape for the show, if that. I do <br/>
believe that Tara and I will be sitting in the audience front row for the <br/>
show. Makes us both feel better to have all the people behind us instead of <br/>
in front of us. Neither one of us are on stage kind of people. Tara is just <br/>
thrilled to go. She&#39;s never been on a plane and is excited about the limo <br/>
and the hotel and all. We get to have our makeup and hair done too on Monday <br/>
morning for the show. I figure maybe they&#39;ll ask us maybe one or two <br/>
questions and that&#39;s it. We&#39;ll be on the second half of Tuesdays show. And <br/>
then on the Oxygen channel for a half hour after the show. I have no idea <br/>
what the tape will look like that they put together. We&#39;ll have to wait <br/>
until Monday to see if we come across like insecure flakes!! You never know <br/>
with editing.<br/>
<br/>
They took some tape of me with all the kids except Joseph. He just didn&#39;t <br/>
want to do it. I explained to him how much it would mean to me to have him <br/>
with us and he just didn&#39;t want to. Tara, I found out later, trying bribing <br/>
him and that didn&#39;t work either! So we&#39;re minus my boy unless they show a <br/>
picture of him. He made a choice and stuck by it. I&#39;m proud of him for that. <br/>
Gotta love those choices! I mentioned homeschooling but not sure any of that <br/>
will get in.<br/>
<br/>
Now I spend the next 2 days rounding up warm clothes to wear of which I have <br/>
none.<br/>
<br/>
Today was definitely a learning experience for us all.<br/>
