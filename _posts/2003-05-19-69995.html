<div id="ygrps-yiv-127218527">Thank you so much!  I was just telling Glena offlist that even though I was <br/>
trying to help YOU, I really in truly helped myself.  It&#39;s so easy to sit by <br/>
myself, removed from the stress and post things like this.  Not because it <br/>
isn&#39;t true but because it isn&#39;t always that way.  I have bad days.  Baaaad <br/>
days.  But when I take the time to write about them, for myself or others, I <br/>
have something tangible to turn to.  Someone to remind me that most of the <br/>
time, I&#39;m doing the right thing.  That I&#39;m NOT alone!  Isn&#39;t that <br/>
glorious!?!?!<br/>
<br/>
I feel like the mother hen here, but I&#39;m so proud of you for sharing your <br/>
frustrations.  It&#39;s hard to admit when we are down.   Scary to think that <br/>
someone might consider us bad parents.  I love it that you feel safety in <br/>
this list as I do.  I am honored that everyone who responded and possibly <br/>
many more were touched and affected by my experiences, for I am touched and <br/>
affected daily by this list.  This is truly a wonderful group of women (and <br/>
men too!) with fascinating, inspiring and heartfelt stories that change my <br/>
life everytime I log on and check in.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys!  I can&#39;t wait to meet as many of you as possible in SC!!!<br/>

I snipped just a piece of your post (below) about your current stresses <br/>
(and, boy, do I feel for you!) and I noticed that, even when you didn&#39;t feel <br/>
very patient, you acted in a patient way.  With all that is going on in your <br/>
life just now, I wanted to say kudos to you for not blowing up!<br/>
