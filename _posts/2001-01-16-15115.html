<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201459706">We did this recently too.  Our 10 year old daughter loves to stay up<br/>
half the night, and sleep half the day.  Until she begged us to let her<br/>
watch Nightmare on Elm Street, &quot;everybody else has seen it&quot;.  After<br/>
several months of this I let her try the movie.  As I expected, she<br/>
didn&#39;t last too long and has slept with us every night for a week now,<br/>
going to bed at our bedtime and up early.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m struggling with how much control to give up.  She says now I<br/>
probably shouldn&#39;t have let her watch the movie.  She craves sugar, junk<br/>
TV, Brittney Spears.  Do I indulge?  What books are you reading?  I<br/>
really like the idea of letting her make her own choices.  I wonder,<br/>
though, if sometimes it really is to her benefit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-88854510">I think I&#39;ve read TOO many books on<br/>
unschooling/homeschooling, to be quite honest. We have<br/>
only begun unschooling/homeschooling in September, but<br/>
I have learned so much more about parenting than about<br/>
homeschooling. I do indulge my boys alot, with video<br/>
games, movies (not scary ones- I hate scary movies!).<br/>
I like to visit the unschooling boards alot, because<br/>
there is so much being said that isnt on this list-<br/>
the nitty gritty, daily grind of life with kids.<br/>
Reading books on unschooling didnt really help me<br/>
much, even made me feel bad that my kids werent<br/>
writing music and neighborhood newsletters- without<br/>
being poked with a branding iron, that wont happen<br/>
here:) I think someone should write a book on the<br/>
AVERAGE unschooled kid. The ones who balk at writing<br/>
anything at all! The ones who love tv and video games,<br/>
and sports! Did you all know that theres a<br/>
homeschooler rookie on the Miami Dolphins??? Well, I<br/>
guess I am babbling a bit, but I&#39;m learning to go with<br/>
my instincts, not by the book. Dont let too many &quot;how<br/>
to&quot; homeschooling/ unschooling books discourage you.<br/>
All those moms and dads wrote about what they know,<br/>
and if you did the same it may not help everyone,<br/>
kwim?<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m off the deep end now!<br/>

but I could only convince my parents to let me homeschool, and they bought <br/>
textbooks, but I have stopped using them now. Both of my parents work and <br/>
they are busy, so I basically do my own thing, but I hate being expected do <br/>
school at home, and they don&#39;t support my unschooing and I can&#39;t talk about <br/>
it with them, I have to be hush- hush about it. They know what I do, but <br/>
they don&#39;t say anything, because I think they don&#39;t want to confront <br/>
me-AGAIN.<br/>
I wish they would be convinced and be supportive so I can call myself an <br/>
unschooler and &quot;come out of the closet&quot;.&lt;sigh&gt;<br/>

LOL this is a book that a lot of Christians need to read... the best part of <br/>
the book is not the words of Elissa or myself, but the essays of Christian <br/>
Unschoolers from all over the US and Canada:) I am not out to convert anyone <br/>
to my way of raising my children, I just want to offer solace to those <br/>
families who are burning out from school at home and support for those <br/>
Christian unschoolers who feel out of sync with simply everyone!!! Thanks for <br/>
the note..... makes me feel good at a time when I Just KNOW that everyone is <br/>

Hi again Ren...Have you read The Teenager Liberation Handbook by Grace<br/>
Llewellyn? Heady stuff, but a must-read, in my opinion. Maybe if you read<br/>
it, then you can read the best parts aloud to your parents to help deschool<br/>
them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Another excellent one is &quot;Real Lives&quot; also by Grace Llewellyn. That one is <br/>
about the lives of 11 teenages who do not go to school.  Some went to <br/>
school and quit, others never attended school.   My husband just finished <br/>
both Real Lives and Teen Lib Handbook, they really are must reads.<br/>
<br/>
I co-founded a homeschooling org here in the St Louis area, and I often get <br/>
emails and questions from people just starting out homeschooling, or <br/>
thinking about it.  I almost ALWAYS get asked what curriculum people should <br/>
buy for their kids.  I  suggest these two books to parents of older kids <br/>
(and even younger ones sometimes), and tell them to not worry about <br/>
curriculum.  They are books both parents and the child can get something <br/>
out of.<br/>
<br/>
I really wish Grace Llewellyn would go back and revisit the teens in the <br/>
Real Lives book.  It has been nearly 10 years since it was written, and <br/>
they are all in the mid 20&#39;s now and I would be very interested to see what <br/>
they are doing now.<br/>
<br/>
Another good one is : &quot;The Unschooling Handbook: How to use the whole world <br/>
as your child&#39;s classroom&quot;  By Mary Griffith   Most anything by John Holt <br/>
of Gatto is a good bet too.<br/>
<br/>
Something else you might do to convince them is get into some volunteering <br/>
or some internship programs.   Show them that there are more valuable ways <br/>
to spend your time other than doing boring text work.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope maybe something in that helps.  I know how you feel.  My <br/>
family is not unsupportive, but my dad and step-sister are both teachers, <br/>
so I think they were expecting a bit more traditional methods (why they <br/>
thought that of me, the big old black sheep of the family I have no <br/>
clue!!).  So, mostly they just ignore the fact that we do what we do.  This <br/>
xmas was the first time they really acknowledged anything and they did that <br/>
buy getting the kids some really wonderful books and hands on things to <br/>
do.  So, maybe they are finally starting to accept, if not understand.<br/>
<br/>
Just hang in there!  It is your education, as long as they are not <br/>
physically stopping you, go for it!<br/>

Life written by an unschooler(Erin Doty,she lives in Portland, and we are <br/>
now in sort of occasional touch-if any of you know her). She suggested it, <br/>
along with Real Lives, and I convinced my mom to get it for me right away. <br/>
She didn&#39;t know what she was getting into! :-) I have higlighted, dogeared, <br/>
bent, and read tons of it to my parents, but it didn&#39;t seem to help.<br/>

parts of it at a bookstore when we were at the beach this past summer, and <br/>

I very maturely stuck my finger in my mouth and pertended to throw up-I <br/>
don&#39;t like the Shurley Method. Not a good move. Anyway, we got into an <br/>
argument about diagramming sentences. She said, &quot;Well, you don&#39;t know how to <br/>
do that&quot;. I know most of the parts of speech and I write and speak <br/>
correctly(when I wish to). I just don&#39;t see the point and I told her so. I <br/>
asked her when she ever used this in life, besides when she was teaching her <br/>
kids. She said I would need it in college and on tests. And I said, &quot;Yes, <br/>
but what practical purpose will it serve me in the real world?&quot;. She <br/>
obviously didn&#39;t have an answer for that, and so she didn&#39;t(answer, that is <br/>
:-). She just got all uptight and said, &quot;You just will!&quot; &quot;No I won&#39;t- if you <br/>
knew of some reason I&#39;ll need it you would tell me.&quot; &quot;You -will- need it, <br/>
don&#39;t argue with me.&quot;<br/>
There&#39;s just no point in argueing with her then, anyway.<br/>

people are born with an understanding way beyond their years. Keep <br/>
explaining and discussing these issues with your parents. They know what an <br/>
intelligent and kind person you are. They just worry. It must  be difficult <br/>
for them to embrace this philosophy. It makes them question their whole life <br/>
and the work they have done. Teaching! Questioning is always a good thing so <br/>
just keep it up. They will come around. Are they aware of the wonderful <br/>
input you give this group? They would have to be very impressed. Thanks <br/>
again for all your kind words and keep writing!        Warmly,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi again Ren...Have you read The Teenager Liberation Handbook by Grace<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Llewellyn? Heady stuff, but a must-read, in my opinion. Maybe if you <br/>
&gt;read<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;it, then you can read the best parts aloud to your parents to help<br/>
&gt; &gt;deschool<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;--Valerie in Tacoma<br/>
&gt;I have read it(cover to cover a couple of times, and a ton of selected<br/>
&gt;reading and browsing), worn it to bits actually! That was the first thing I<br/>
&gt;did after I heard of unschooling for the first time, in an article in Girls<br/>
&gt;Life written by an unschooler(Erin Doty,she lives in Portland, and we are<br/>
&gt;now in sort of occasional touch-if any of you know her). She suggested it,<br/>
&gt;along with Real Lives, and I convinced my mom to get it for me right away.<br/>
&gt;She didn&#39;t know what she was getting into! :-) I have higlighted, dogeared,<br/>
&gt;bent, and read tons of it to my parents, but it didn&#39;t seem to help.<br/>
&gt;My answer to this got &quot;delayed&quot; so it will probably show up again in a few<br/>
&gt;days but it might be a dead topic by then so I decide to &quot;re answer&quot;!<br/>
&gt; &gt;Another excellent one is &quot;Real Lives&quot; also by Grace Llewellyn. That one <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt;about the lives of 11 teenages who do not go to school.  Some went to<br/>
&gt; &gt;school and quit, others never attended school.   My husband just <br/>
&gt; &gt;finished<br/>
&gt; &gt;both Real Lives and Teen Lib Handbook, they really are must reads.<br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t yet read it, but I have heard tons about it. I can&#39;t find it in<br/>
&gt;bookstores in dinky Baxley,GA(thank goodness for Amazon-may they never go<br/>
&gt;out of business) but I will either save my money and get Mom to order it <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;me(I&#39;m currently broke:-) or ask for it for my birthday in April, because I<br/>
&gt;would really like to read it. And the more sucess stories I can cram into <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;parents heads the better.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I really wish Grace Llewellyn would go back and revisit the teens in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Real Lives book.  It has been nearly 10 years since it was written, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;they are all in the mid 20&#39;s now and I would be very interested to see <br/>
&gt;what<br/>
&gt; &gt;they are doing now.<br/>
&gt;That would be interesting!<br/>
&gt; &gt;Another good one is : &quot;The Unschooling Handbook: How to use the whole <br/>
&gt;world<br/>
&gt; &gt;as your child&#39;s classroom&quot;  By Mary Griffith   Most anything by John Holt<br/>
&gt; &gt;of Gatto is a good bet too.<br/>
&gt;I would also like to buy the Unschooling Handbook as soon as I can. I read<br/>
&gt;parts of it at a bookstore when we were at the beach this past summer, and<br/>
&gt;it was really good, but I wasn&#39;t able to buy it then(because I had no <br/>
&gt;money,<br/>
&gt;as usual for me). And yes I have thought of starting a business!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Something else you might do to convince them is get into some <br/>
&gt;volunteering<br/>
&gt; &gt;or some internship programs.   Show them that there are more valuable <br/>
&gt;ways<br/>
&gt; &gt;to spend your time other than doing boring text work.<br/>
&gt;I am working on starting to volunteer at the local hospital an I would like<br/>
&gt;to work with a vet or maybe with my grown cousin who has just started her<br/>
&gt;own business, a neat little card and scrapbook supply store. She makes<br/>
&gt;cards, stationary, all kinds of neat things and she has tons of stickers <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;scrapbook supplies. She&#39;s very creative and fun and she&#39;s really busy now<br/>
&gt;because the shop just took off.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Anyway, I hope maybe something in that helps.  I know how you feel.  My<br/>
&gt; &gt;family is not unsupportive, but my dad and step-sister are both teachers,<br/>
&gt; &gt;so I think they were expecting a bit more traditional methods (why they<br/>
&gt; &gt;thought that of me, the big old black sheep of the family I have no<br/>
&gt; &gt;clue!!).  So, mostly they just ignore the fact that we do what we do.<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s actually how I feel my parents act. And they are both teachers, <br/>
&gt;which<br/>
&gt;is very annoying. Last night Mama was grading papers(her third graders are<br/>
&gt;using the Shurley Method-they are diagramming sentences in third grade), <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;I very maturely stuck my finger in my mouth and pertended to throw up-I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t like the Shurley Method. Not a good move. Anyway, we got into an<br/>
&gt;argument about diagramming sentences. She said, &quot;Well, you don&#39;t know how <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;do that&quot;. I know most of the parts of speech and I write and speak<br/>
&gt;correctly(when I wish to). I just don&#39;t see the point and I told her so. I<br/>
&gt;asked her when she ever used this in life, besides when she was teaching <br/>
&gt;her<br/>
&gt;kids. She said I would need it in college and on tests. And I said, &quot;Yes,<br/>
&gt;but what practical purpose will it serve me in the real world?&quot;. She<br/>
&gt;obviously didn&#39;t have an answer for that, and so she didn&#39;t(answer, that is<br/>
&gt;:-). She just got all uptight and said, &quot;You just will!&quot; &quot;No I won&#39;t- if <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;knew of some reason I&#39;ll need it you would tell me.&quot; &quot;You -will- need it,<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t argue with me.&quot;<br/>
&gt;There&#39;s just no point in argueing with her then, anyway.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Just hang in there!  It is your education, as long as they are not<br/>
&gt; &gt;physically stopping you, go for it!<br/>
&gt;I sure will.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry about the novel length message, I just had it to get it all out!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you very much for all your advice!<br/>
&gt;Ren<br/>

Let me take this moment to say how wonderful I think all of -you- are. I am <br/>
on several unschooling lists and this one is definately the best! Everybody <br/>
is so understanding and helpful and we don&#39;t bicker about silly things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No they don&#39;t know. Sometimes I wish they could read our discussions, but a <br/>
lot of the time I would actually prefer they were not on the list, because I <br/>
can speak freely and ask for advice without worrying about what they think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-266791378">Ren, are you SURE you&#39;re only 14?:)<br/>
I homeschooled when i was 14 and I&#39;ve known alot of<br/>
teen homeschoolers in my life and most of them<br/>
-including me at some point- homeschooled just becuz<br/>
they WANTED to slack off all day. Cuz they wanted to<br/>
be able to NOT learn and just play. You seem sooo the<br/>
opposite. You actually sought out a list about<br/>
unschooling. Some kids would have just been perfectly<br/>
happy letting thier parents say &quot;homeschooling&quot; and<br/>
just watch TV all day, turn in a test every once in a<br/>
while, to keep people happy. I&#39;m very impressed with<br/>
your morale.  I am very out of the loop here on this<br/>
list, so maybe someone&#39;s already suggested it. But a<br/>
huge thing that helped me -(though my family wasn&#39;t<br/>
against unschooling by any means, but they did worry<br/>
that they should have been making me &quot;do schoolwork&quot;<br/>
instead of stuff on my own, so it helped me reassured<br/>
them)- was seeking out learning experiences (which you<br/>
obviously like doing) and then sharing them with them<br/>
all excitedly. Checking out these tapes from the<br/>
library with my then best friend (6 yrs older and<br/>
&quot;taking a correspondence course&quot; to get her diploma)to<br/>
learn Swahili, or sitting down and reading a national<br/>
geographic in thier presence, or writing a report on<br/>
something I found interesting, for no other purpose<br/>
than to write it. Not for them to read. Not for<br/>
&quot;school&quot; but just cuz I wanted to learn about<br/>
something particular and did it on my own. Making a<br/>
science experiment that they knew wasn&#39;t required of<br/>
me. Then my parents were like &quot;ok, she&#39;ll be fine. she<br/>
learns what she wants to learn.&quot; They bought me a<br/>
couple of correspondence courses Calvert and American<br/>
School and they never witnessed me really absorbing<br/>
them the way I did these other things. If you let them<br/>
see you learning on your &quot;own time&quot; (as opposed to<br/>
during the day when you are supposed to be doing<br/>
&quot;school&quot; and then be thru with it when they are home<br/>
later), and enjoying it and maybe taking an interest<br/>
in something they hope you will learn about thru<br/>
homeschooling. for instance if they encourage you to<br/>
take something as an elective in a homeschooling<br/>
course or something, then let them see you looking at<br/>
site on the net about that very thing when you could<br/>
easily be chatting with friends instead. If they have<br/>
hopes of you liking medical science, then let them<br/>
catch you reading a medical encyclopedia at some time<br/>
when one of your favorite  tv shows is on. This will<br/>
show them that learning is important to you and you<br/>
aren&#39;t just trying to &quot;get out of the work&quot;, and that<br/>
you can learn it fine on your own, without structured<br/>
lessons. Right now if you tell them something you<br/>
learned during the day, they may just assumed it was<br/>
thru the homeschooling program they have set up for<br/>
you. But if they can see with thier own eyes that you<br/>
can do it and want to do it then it may help ease<br/>
thier minds. Keep in mind that the same peer pressure<br/>
that kids get at school, adults get at work and from<br/>
family and friends. I&#39;m sure they want what&#39;s best for<br/>
you just as much as we all want it for our kids, but<br/>
they obviously need convincing in a different way than<br/>
from words and talking, if that hasn&#39;t worked. Maybe<br/>
SEEING it work will be effective. Sometimes adults<br/>
have to have &quot;hands-on&quot; learning, too, in order to<br/>
finally grasp a point. :) Hope that was somewhat<br/>
helpful and not just incoherent. I must go to bed now.<br/>
I think I typed that last part in my sleep. <br/>
