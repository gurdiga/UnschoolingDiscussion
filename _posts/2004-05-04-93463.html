&gt; Hey death sucks.  What can I do but go through this with him.  The hard part<br/>
&gt; was asking him what he thoguth and then him asking again was that true and<br/>
&gt; seeing his pain. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep. I know what you mean. I told DH the other day it would be SOO nice to be <br/>
able to tell him that we will all meet again in hevean and exist &quot;happily <br/>
ever after&quot;, but we don&#39;t believe that, so I would feel like I was lying to him <br/>
just to make him less unhappy, less afraid... its tough! I would WAY rather he <br/>
needed stitches or broke an arm or something! I can deal with that pain! :~) <br/>
Very tough...<br/>
