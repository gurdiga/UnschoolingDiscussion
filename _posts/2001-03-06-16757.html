<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965473004">I would be interested in knowing what you have. I just started<br/>
unschooling/homeschooling 4 weeks ago. Right now, we are taking it easy a<br/>
bit with a lot of reading from books and doing at least 2 math papers a<br/>
week that I download and print out from a free worksheet website. Naomi<br/>
does have a penpal and she also writes to her cousin once a week. I&#39;m<br/>
trying to see if she would write in her journal more often...think if she<br/>
sees me doing it, she will do the same &lt;G&gt;. I am a rubber stamper and<br/>
crafter...so we do make a lot of cards and other things with rubber<br/>
stamps (been doing this for 6 years). I also make homemade bread and<br/>
thats one of our projects tomorrow. Naomi helps me with grocery shopping,<br/>
cleaning, laundry as well as school. I&#39;m a single parent and disabled and<br/>
because of that disability..I am able to stay home with her.<br/>
