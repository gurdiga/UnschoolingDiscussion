<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882183761">Well, if you were holding your breath, Tuck, you can exhale now cuz I&#39;m<br/>
going to ask you questions about ukuleles.  I can hear the audible gasp &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I am a guitar player, but have become somewhat bored with it - well,<br/>
actually, I haven&#39;t done much with the guitar since I was 14 or so, but have<br/>
one to play along at our singing days and mess about with.<br/>
<br/>
I originally had a ukulele when I was little, but very few people saw it as<br/>
an end in itself, just a step towards a guitar.  But now, I&#39;m looking for<br/>
something different and am fascinated by both the ukulele and the slack key<br/>
guitar from Hawaii.  Can you give me any pointers on getting started, good<br/>
music (I can read musical notation still, I think) and CDs for the ukulele?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and hoping for a long-winded post!<br/>
<br/>
Robin B.<br/>

&gt; Ooh, I&#39;d LOVE to have a post like that about ukulele&#39;s!  But I&#39;m not<br/>
holding<br/>
&gt; my breath.  :)<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m just a beginner, myself.  I&#39;ve been enjoying it, though.  I don&#39;t play any other instruments, although I can play piano by ear some. Music is in my genes, but it never developed in me like it did in my older brother.  I think his overbearing personality might have had something to do with that.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a cool software program I found that allows you to feed in lyrics with chords and it will spit out uke tabs.  It&#39;s a little complicated but it works!  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m on a different computer so I&#39;m having to look up some links again.  When I was looking for that page, I typed in www.ezfolk.com, and then clicked on Ukes on the top.  It happened to be a page I never saw when I was googling for uke stuff.  It&#39;s a cool page with lots more songs!  Yippee!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve purchased a couple of fake books so I can feed them into the ukepix software.  But I haven&#39;t found a music store in Memphis yet that carries uke books.  I&#39;ll have to look online, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
I chose the ukulele because it&#39;s really easy to learn.  Four strings and they&#39;re nylon (I was afraid steel strings would hurt too much and make me quit...that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t try guitar.)  And, I can take it camping and play along with campfire songs and it won&#39;t take up too much space in the truck!  I also chose it because you can&#39;t play it without a smile in your face.  There&#39;s nothing serious about it!  No one else plays it around here, either.  <br/>
<br/>
My older brother received a uke for Christmas one year, instead of the guitar he had asked for.  The box was shaped funny and it sat under the tree for a few weeks and no one could ever guess what was in it.  My dad had great delight in our guesses.  We were all so surprised when it was a ukulele!  I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever seen one at all till then.  But my dad picked it up, tuned it and sat right there and played a song!  I&#39;d never seen him play any instrument (we didn&#39;t even have a piano), or even be interested in anything but singing.  Yet, he picked it right up and played a song (Of course, his mother is a musician of unschooled proportions, so he came by it naturally!)<br/>
<br/>
So John learned to play it and it was around the house a lot, but I was never allowed to touch it.  I thought it was hard, but really cool that my dad could do that, and that John was learning so quickly.  But one day his ukulele was lying on the couch next to him, and he called me over to show me something.  Being the 7 or 8 yo that I was, I just bounced right down beside him, then did a little hop up to get more comfortable.  When I did, the ukulele bounced closer and without meaning to, I sat on it and broke the neck off at the body!  <br/>
<br/>
He was so mad!  It wasn&#39;t my fault, just an accident, but he holds grudges.  By the next Christmas he had a guitar from Sears, and he went on to play in a couple of different rockabilly bands.  <br/>
<br/>
Breaking that ukulele is one of those things I&#39;ve never forgotten. I can still remember what I was wearing!  So, maybe I&#39;m reliving my childhood by learning it, but I&#39;m still having a lot of fun!<br/>
