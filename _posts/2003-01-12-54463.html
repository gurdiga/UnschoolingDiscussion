&lt;&lt; &gt; This list is eerie lately, because people keep asking here what Holly <br/>
lately <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; asked or discussed with  me<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because she&#39;s really funny! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well she is.  And poor thing is sick and she&#39;s even funny when she describes <br/>
being sick or asks for help.  She&#39;s a mine of good stories.<br/>
<br/>
But the eerie creepy part is that here we are talking about whatever thing <br/>
comes up naturally, and repeatedly this week, someone will write something <br/>
that Holly and I just discussed, so I&#39;m starting to feel uncomfortable saying <br/>
&quot;just yesterday Holly asked me the same thing,&quot; but I&#39;m up to four of them (a <br/>
couple were two days or three back, not just yesterday) and I&#39;m starting to <br/>
feel like people will say &quot;OH SURE, right, you and Holly did NOT &#39;just talk <br/>
about that yesterday.&#39;&quot;<br/>
