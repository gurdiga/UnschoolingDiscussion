 </span></blockquote>The principle of triage is to treat those who *can* be treated and hold those who can&#39;t or who won&#39;t benefit in the long run from the treatment.<br/>
<br/>
For an obvious example, someone who is unconscious, in shock, with open abdominal injuries, will be passed by for someone with just a fractured leg, simply because time and resources only allow the medical team to treat those who will likely survive. <br/>
<br/>
But in the case of a cut finger and a broken leg, the cut finger does not &quot;outrank&quot; the broken leg since both will survive.  The broken leg will &quot;outrank&quot; the cut finger because both will survive, but the broken leg requires more emergent treatment than the cut finger.<br/>
<br/>
It has nothing to do with who will return to the battle field.  It has to do with limited time and resources in the field, and how to best use them to save the most lives.<br/>
<br/>
And in less obvious situations, its a jugement call.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Was an Army nurse for 4 years and have been in field situations many times.  <br/>
5th MASH and the 5th MASH FAST team for a while.  It is very true.  In the <br/>
field you are  concerned with returning a soldier to the battle.  You need to <br/>
have a fighting force.  Also resupply only occurs at certain times.  Blood and <br/>
other medical supplies are limited.  When there is a large amount of casualties <br/>
the more serious will sit in the back of the tent or will sit in a holding <br/>
area waiting to be transferred back.  If transport doesn&#39;t come in time they may <br/>
in fact die waiting for treatment.  Triage in war is the opposite than it is <br/>
for the civilian sector.<br/>

for the physician.  But in a battle situation it does have to do with a <br/>
fighting force.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, your&#39;re talking about REAL war.    It&#39;s difficult to have to think <br/>
about, but in combat situations, things aren&#39;t pretty.  I kept seeing scenes from <br/>
Saving Private Ryan,  We Were Soldiers,  Black Hawk Down, etc, while reading <br/>
your post.   You have seen it first hand,  what better testimony could there be <br/>
as to how injuries rank in combat than from a person who has  actually <br/>
treated combat injuries.<br/>
