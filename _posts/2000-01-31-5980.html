combine, and save their money.  They learned to count by 2 and 3&#39;s while<br/>
separating their $5 into piles. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had a 4 year old who woke up one morning, crawled into my lap all warm and<br/>
smelling of sleep.  She gave me kisses and then mumbled....6 5&#39;s are 30.<br/>
She was spending her money in her sleep. &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>

okay Thea you got me there! I am still too schooled and hate seeing those<br/>
report cards and dittoes they look so boring you are right though it can be<br/>
fun and full of patterns and rhythm etc. But maybe for some people it will<br/>
never be fun and how do you determine what needs to be learned in Math? I<br/>
hated it and sometimes still do. I don&#39;t want my kids to pick that up my<br/>
hatred of Math though so I will need to watch out for that! I used to love<br/>
to teach with a number chart we made as a group so we would be able to<br/>
record the number of days we were in school and we also did the counting by<br/>
2&#39;s , 5&#39;s,10&#39;s etc. counting backwards from a hundred and blasting off into<br/>
space.. I guess I could do that as a hschooler too as the kids do love that.<br/>
I just am confused about the unschooling aspects and where my philosophy of<br/>
not seeing them as an empty vessel needs to integrate into my old school<br/>
teacher control freak ways.<br/>
I have thought of relying on the series &quot;what every first grader needs to<br/>
know&quot; but that is only on days when I want to compare my kids to others and<br/>
be sure they score high in the need for useless knowledge skills so they can<br/>
become a millionaire or win a full scholarship to Harvard etc. I&#39;d rather<br/>
they learn life skills if I have to impose anything on them and I do agree<br/>
with you having fun ought to be a life skill! We all need to have more of<br/>
it!<br/>

<br/>
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!<br/>
<br/>
Just because I want to know.  Just because knowing is more fun than not <br/>
knowing!  Just because.  <br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t have to have any other reason beyond those.  I don&#39;t have to have <br/>
any reason.  <br/>
<br/>
Hardly anythig that I know is actually useful.  But I just enjoy knowing some <br/>
neat stuff.  I hope people will remember me the way I remember my Dad -- he <br/>
read a lot.  At 82, he wasn&#39;t trying to get a better job or get a degree or <br/>
pass a test.  He just wanted to know more.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing is fun.<br/>

I get your point! It is contagious and all kids naturally want to know<br/>
things right so you go with their want or desire to know or your own at any<br/>
given moment? The problem I have with rewarding kids for learning isolated<br/>
skills the way they do in schools is they don&#39;t nec. want to learn that<br/>
stuff unless they are coerced even in Waldorf. I guess that is what I was<br/>
reacting to and asking about. You do some things for fun and the kids<br/>
naturally gravitate to those things you enjoy doing or knowing about as well<br/>
as develop their own interests separate from your own?<br/>

Sorry!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t responding to the whole &quot;should rewards be used or not&quot; discussion.  <br/>
I was just saying that math is fun.  Learning for its own sake is fun.  <br/>
Sometimes I feel we spend a lot of time justifying the need to learn <br/>
something and it is really a waste of time and counterproductive.  <br/>
<br/>
Reward or not?  I don&#39;t know.  Sometimes.  Mostly not.  How&#39;s that for vague!<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

Okay since I am new to all this I don&#39;t think it a waste of time but<br/>
appreciate your input (vague or not). I am curious what a day in your<br/>
unschooler&#39;s life is like and would love to know details not just vagary, it<br/>
sounds like it is a fun place and if you could tell me more I&#39;d be willing<br/>
to listen without judging the merits of whether it is worth learning or not!<br/>
