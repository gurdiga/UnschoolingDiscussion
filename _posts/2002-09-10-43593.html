&lt;&lt; I still don&#39;t have rules.  But I fear I&#39;ve done as much damage in talking <br/>
 about this being less nutritious than that as my friends did in having all <br/>
 those rules.  How do others handle these kinds of issues? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s our life, just for an example, not to tell you how to do it.<br/>
I buy mostly wholesome, healthy foods. I cook fairly nutritous meals and try <br/>
to make good snacks easily available. I also include my children in the meal <br/>
planning (ie: &quot;what do you guys want to eat this week?) and the grocery <br/>
shopping.<br/>
They love going to the grocery store.<br/>
Most kids I know hate it. But I go where they want, we look at all the foods <br/>
together, we talk about where they are from and how to cook the weird ones <br/>
(cactus, ugli fruit, Jicama) and they choose what they want also.<br/>
If it&#39;s junky, I try to offer a healthier alternative that would meet the <br/>
desire. Like my dd wanted Tang juices the other day, I showed her the Capri <br/>
sun (full of sugar, but at least with real fruit juice and not all the <br/>
preservatives and dye of the Tang) and she thought that was fine. If she <br/>
still really wanted the Tang I&#39;d get it.<br/>
Sure I cringe.<br/>
But here&#39;s my thought process on this.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen people eat all the things I am horrified about and live to be OLD <br/>
and healthy.<br/>
I believe that emotional/mental health is by far the most important aspect of <br/>
a persons total well being.<br/>
So if I have a choice between physical health and emotional health, I&#39;ll do <br/>
deprive the physical before the emotional.<br/>
And I hugely believe that having control of one&#39;s life, of the choices in <br/>
that life and not having feelings of deprivation, contribute to a person&#39;s <br/>
emotional health.<br/>
So sure, I cringe over the dye or sugar, but I&#39;ve also seen my children less <br/>
needy with the junk and more willing to try anything I cook. Because they <br/>
trust me to not be coercive with food.<br/>
While I was fixing their dinner last night, they all pulled out popsicles <br/>
that Sierra had made herself earlier and ate those.  I didn&#39;t notice that it <br/>
made a dent in what they ate.<br/>
I dislike that  &quot;you&#39;ll spoil your appetite&quot; garbage.<br/>
Isn&#39;t that the whole point of eating? To stop the feelings of hunger? But I <br/>
guess we just shouldn&#39;t eat since it will spoil our appetite!! LOL<br/>
But I digress...<br/>
The point is, you could make a big deal about the stuff you consider junk and <br/>
cause them to feel needy and not trust you.<br/>
Or you could relax, watch them eat it happily and think how wonderful it is <br/>
that they aren&#39;t feeling stressed about their food choices.<br/>
And then watch them eat their broccoli just as happily because they feel <br/>
confident in their own choices. :)<br/>

Last night at a restaurant, Holly wanted mozarella sticks for her meal.  When <br/>
mine came (salmon) she didn&#39;t want any salmon, but she DID want the cooked <br/>
carrots and the rice.  When desert time came, she didn&#39;t want any.  We <br/>
would&#39;ve bought her one.  She came home to a fridge she knew had cheesecake, <br/>
ice cream and popsicles.  They&#39;re all still there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605405325">Just wanted to add something about the whole food issue. Just in case anyone <br/>
is wondering about the choices their children are making.<br/>
<br/>
Tara, my oldest was a great eater as a baby. She ate everything put in front <br/>
of her, veggies and whatever it was. When she turned 2, it was like a <br/>
different child. Within a week, she cut out all meat to only meatballs. <br/>
Within the next month after that, she cut out just about everything else she <br/>
ate. She cut out milk, meat of any kind, veggies except for corn, fruit <br/>
except for baby peaches. (I mean baby food) She started to survive on french <br/>
fries, spaghettio&#39;s without the meatballs, pasta with sauce and no meat in <br/>
the sauce. Lunches were a chore as she was going to school. From the 2nd <br/>
grade up to last year, (she&#39;s almost 17)she took peanut butter and jelly to <br/>
school every day of her life. When she was young, I thought it was phase. <br/>
Whn I realized it was going to be a very long one, I let her go. What was I <br/>
going to do, force food into her?? I would feed her before going anywhere <br/>
else to eat like someone&#39;s house and even would send her with food if she <br/>
went visiting. Very gradually she started to add some things on her own. She <br/>
started with chicken tenders from BK and went from there.<br/>
<br/>
Now she can eat out at any restuarant and manages quite well. She added some <br/>
veggies and fruit along the way. She doesn&#39;t &quot;pig out&quot; on snacks, drinks <br/>
only water and ice tea, and has even gone as far as to eat steak now. The <br/>
only other meat from chicken she&#39;ll touch. Doesn&#39;t eat any kind of seafood <br/>
at all. Point is it all worked for her. Even though she&#39;s a school kid, <br/>
she&#39;s healthier than most I know. Most of the time, the whole house can <br/>
catch a cold and she gets nothing. So it certainly hasn&#39;t hurt her any and <br/>
we&#39;ve saved countless hours of fighting over nothing.<br/>
