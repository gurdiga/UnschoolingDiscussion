<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585747546">Email debates, discussions, arguements,etc go around on lists all the <br/>
time.  On another list, someone posted this.  I thought it was so <br/>

<br/>
Daily Affirmations to Avoid<br/>
As I let go of my feelings of guilt, I can get in touch with my Inner <br/>
Sociopath.<br/>
<br/>
I have the power to channel my imagination into ever-soaring levels <br/>
of suspicion<br/>
and paranoia.<br/>
<br/>
I assume full responsibility for my actions, except the ones that are <br/>
someone<br/>
else&#39;s fault.<br/>
<br/>
I no longer need to punish, deceive or compromise myself. Unless, of <br/>
course, I<br/>
want to stay employed.<br/>
<br/>
In some cultures what I do would be considered normal.<br/>
<br/>
Having control over myself is nearly as good as having control over <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
My intuition nearly makes up for my lack of good judgment.<br/>
<br/>
I honor my personality flaws, for without them I would have no <br/>
personality at all.<br/>
<br/>
Joan of Arc heard voices too.<br/>
<br/>
I am grateful that I am not as judgmental as all those censorious, <br/>
self-righteous<br/>
people around me.<br/>
<br/>
I need not suffer in silence while I can still moan, whimper and <br/>
complain.<br/>
<br/>
As I learn the innermost secrets of the people around me, they reward <br/>
me in many<br/>
ways to keep me quiet.<br/>
<br/>
When someone hurts me, forgiveness is cheaper than a lawsuit. But not <br/>
nearly as<br/>
gratifying.<br/>
<br/>
The first step is to say nice things about myself. The second, to do <br/>
nice things<br/>
for myself. The third, to find someone to buy me nice things.<br/>
<br/>
As I learn to trust the universe, I no longer need to carry a gun.<br/>
<br/>
All of me is beautiful and valuable, even the ugly, stupid, and <br/>
disgusting parts.<br/>
<br/>
I am at one with my duality.<br/>
<br/>
Blessed are the flexible, for they can tie themselves into knots.<br/>
<br/>
I will strive to live each day as if it were my 40th birthday.<br/>
<br/>
Only a lack of imagination saves me from immobilizing myself with <br/>
imaginary fears.<br/>
<br/>
I honour and express all facets of my being, regardless of state and <br/>
local laws.<br/>
<br/>
Today I will gladly share my experience and advice, for there are no <br/>
sweeter words<br/>
than &quot;I told you so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
False hope is nicer than no hope at all.<br/>
<br/>
A good scapegoat is nearly as welcome as a solution to the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Just for today, I will not sit in my living room all day watching TV. <br/>
Instead I<br/>
will move my TV into the bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
Who can I blame for my own problems? Give me just a minute... I&#39;ll <br/>
find someone.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not whether you win or lose, but where you place the blame.<br/>
<br/>
Why should I waste my time reliving the past when I can spend it <br/>
worrying about<br/>
the future?<br/>
<br/>
The complete lack of evidence is the surest sign that the conspiracy <br/>
is working.<br/>
<br/>
I am learning that criticism is not nearly as effective as sabotage.<br/>
<br/>
Becoming aware of my character defects leads me to the next step - <br/>
blaming my<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
To have a successful relationship I must learn to make it look like <br/>
I&#39;m giving as<br/>
much as I&#39;m getting.<br/>
<br/>
I am willing to make the mistakes if someone else is willing to learn <br/>
from them.</div>
