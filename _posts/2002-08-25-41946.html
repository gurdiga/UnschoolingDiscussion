The school system also does not own you.<br/>
<br/>
 If your school system makes you believe that you will get into a &quot;mess&quot; if<br/>
you keep your own child home with the intention of homeschooling, it shows<br/>
only how bad the situation is.<br/>
<br/>
No homeschoolers should feel any need to &quot;apply&quot; for the right to<br/>
homeschool; we should simply &quot;inform&quot; or &quot;notify&quot; the school that we are<br/>
removing our child so that they won&#39;t keep the child&#39;s name on their<br/>
attendance rolls.<br/>
<br/>
No school system in this country accepts responsibility for the education of<br/>
any children. <br/>
