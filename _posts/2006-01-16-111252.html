<div id="ygrps-yiv-673752942">I&#39;m looking for advice on teens, photos, and the Internet.<br/>
<br/>
13yo Lisa has recently taken a lot of photos with herself and her friends.  (Well, she&#39;s always taken a lot of photos, but she and her friends are growing up, no longer just little girls.)  Yesterday, she and a friend had printed some out and were folding them up with tabs that said &quot;pull&quot;.  I asked why they were folding the photo like that and they said it was fun.<br/>
<br/>
This morning when Pat (dh) brought in the newspaper he found two of the photos laying in the street in front of our house.  One was close up of a neighbor girl puckering her lips at a photo of a boy (as if she was about to kiss it) and the other was Lisa holding her finger to her lips.  Pat thought it was strange that the photos were on the street and asked me why they were there.  I said it was likely someone had dropped them, probably accidentally, but I didn&#39;t know and he should ask Lisa (who was asleep at the time).  That led to a discussion in which Pat expressed concern about Lisa posting photos on the internet (myspace).  His concern is sexual predators.  He left for work before she got up.<br/>
<br/>
I am not paranoid about internet predators.  Yes, I know that perverts are out there, but the risk of one effectively targeting my dd is small.  Still, I&#39;m not sure how to respond when dh gets going about the issue and I wonder if I am *under*reacting.  Lisa uses my computer for her blogging and I&#39;ve always checked her blog from time to time and am sometimes in the room while she is working on it.  She has also sometimes asked me to look at something on her blog, so I don&#39;t think she is trying to hide anything there.  I keep a blog too and invite her to read mine or sometimes ask her to read a specific post.  I do not see everything she does on the internet (posting comments to other people&#39;s blogs) or read her email unless she shares something with me.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the photos *could* be taken as suggestive, though I&#39;m uncertain whether that was the girls&#39; intent when they took the photos.<br/>
<br/>
I have talked to Lisa about using caution in choosing photos to post.  I told her that there are laws about posting photos that show certain body parts.  I was referring to a photo of one of the girls at her birthday party - a close up of her breasts in a low cut t-shirt (which had not been posted anywhere, it was just in the folder of photos from the birthday party).  It turns out that Jackie (my 10yod) had taken the photo and the girl had moved right before she snapped it.  It was not supposed to be a close up photo of breasts.  The next photo was the same girl with a nice smile.  Which goes to show that it is better to find out what the intent was before jumping to conclusions!  I told Lisa that I thought we should delete a few of the photos, rather than risk someone seeing them who might get offended.  She readily agreed to that.<br/>

Sexual predators can&#39;t pass through myspace.com.<br/>
As long as the kids don&#39;t invite any guys over or agree to meet them  <br/>
at the bus stop, it&#39;s not gonig to be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Every story I&#39;ve ever read or heard about a teen being involved in a  <br/>
frightening, questionable liason with a predator has begun with  <br/>
someone being lonely and feeling helplessly locked up and limited in  <br/>
an unhappy home, so that the company of a stranger seemed better and  <br/>
safer than what they had with parents.<br/>
<br/>
A safe, loved, respected child/teen/person who has some freedom and  <br/>
choice in life, who is happy and secure, won&#39;t even BEGIN to need the  <br/>
attentions of faceless weirdos.<br/>

I think everyone thinks that their life is blessed and nothing will happen<br/>
to them until it does. We have to live like that or we would become neurotic<br/>
with all the things that could happen. With that said there is nothing wrong<br/>
with being cautious. You may want to look at a website that requires a<br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;m thankful this discussion came up...I was going to post something about  <br/>
our situation but didn&#39;t know if it would be too off topic, though I don&#39;t <br/>
think  it is.  Mary Ellen&#39;s email about her daughters pictures touched on  what <br/>
happened with us. <br/>
 <br/>
We have pretty much given our kids access to the internet and both of my  <br/>
older (at home) kids had &quot;my space&quot; pages.  My husband and I are not  on the same <br/>
page on this, as he&#39;s much more cautious about things.  <br/>
 <br/>
My son had a couple of friends spend the night Sat and Sun, and  both nights <br/>
the boys stayed up super late on the internet.  Turns  out they were chatting <br/>
with girls, and a few &quot;risque&quot; (to say the  least) pictures got passed back <br/>
and forth.  Our son is 17, as were the  other boys.  My husband found out <br/>
because he had asked the boys  to go to bed and they got back up and when he <br/>
confronted them about it, he  saw what they had been doing.  <br/>
 <br/>
He wasn&#39;t mad over the content of the emails (photos) but that the boys  were <br/>
being very sneaky about it, and lied about what they had been  doing.  We&#39;re <br/>
not happy, but we understand that if we were their age and  had had access to <br/>
the internet we may have done the same.  I asked my  husband if he thought <br/>
he&#39;d lie if his mom had caughter him...:o)<br/>
 <br/>
Through all of this, he checked out both kids my space  pages...my son&#39;s <br/>
didn&#39;t have anything bad on it,...lots of punk stuff,  etc.  But my daughter (15) <br/>
had some pictures that were a lot the way Mary  Ellen described her daughters <br/>
pictures.  No nudity, but poses that seemed  suggestive.  This is NOT uncommon <br/>
for a lot of  &quot;my space&quot;  pages that I&#39;ve seen (kids friends, my older <br/>
daughter&#39;s friends,  etc.)  <br/>
 <br/>
But my daughter, in her blog, admitted to doing something with a boy (not  <br/>
intercourse) and my husband was very upset...I have to admit it made me sad  <br/>
too.  She wasn&#39;t doing anything that I hadn&#39;t done at her same age, but  it&#39;s <br/>
still sort of a shock.   Although we were a little  disappointed, I think what <br/>
bothers us most was that she had posted about it, and  that she tried (on the <br/>
page) to take on the persona of a rebel child, who has  had many boyfriends, and <br/>
it was there for everyone to see (we are from a VERY  small town.)  But I was <br/>
quick to identify that what bothered me the MOST  was what others would think <br/>
of ME and our family, and I&#39;ve instead put that  aside and said <br/>
&quot;F-it&quot;...she&#39;s the one I care about and I know she&#39;s a really  good, creative, wonderful <br/>
kid.  <br/>
 <br/>
My husband at first got really upset, and deleted their my space pages, put  <br/>
their AOL screen names back down to no email, no IM&#39;s, no chats, but left  <br/>
internet exploring open.  But after stepping back from the situation, he  <br/>
realized he had over-reacted.  This situation which started out as a  potential keg <br/>
of dynomite fizzled out and calmed very quickly.  I  encouraged him to talk <br/>
with each kid by themselves...my daughter got teary with  him, she was really <br/>
embarassed more than anything.  <br/>
 <br/>
My husband and I went by ourselves to the store later, and we had a good  <br/>
talk about what we were doing at their ages, and how maybe instead of cutting  <br/>
them off from the world in situations like that (no IM&#39;s, no Chats, Etc) it&#39;d be <br/>
 better to spend a lot more time talking with them about their worth, self  <br/>
respect, respect of others (the pictures a few girls sent to my son were  <br/>
terrible, heartbreaking that girls would feel the need to do this...), and  safety. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I have convinced my husband that if we just monitor a little more closely  <br/>
what they do, but give them full access,...that, along with lots of time spent  <br/>
with us talking about what they see and do on the internet (especially my  <br/>
husband and my daughter together) then I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have much to worry  <br/>
about.  We talked about starting from scratch (for their My Space page) and  <br/>
thinking about what they write, who sees it, etc,...at all times.  <br/>
 <br/>
I just wanted to get thoughts from other parents about if something like  <br/>
this has ever happened at their home, whether they notified the other parents  <br/>
(in the case of the boys), and how they handled it, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-8844705">Well said! And I agree with you. if we think about all the things that could<br/>
happen. well, some of us wouldn&#39;t get out of bed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I said cautious I didn&#39;t mean not allowing it but just as you said -<br/>
keeping lines of communication open - making sure that your child are<br/>
stranger aware even on the internet. You don&#39;t have to tell me what kids do<br/>
on the computer I grew up with one. I was once one of those kids who could<br/>
stay up 24 hours talking online. I wrote viruses and infected my school<br/>
computers with the music bug. I hacked systems just to see if I could do it.<br/>
I write back and forth in IM language that makes most adults brain hurt lol.<br/>

it&#39;s not a good unschooling move.<br/>

While you&#39;re remembering what you were doing at your kids&#39; ages, also  <br/>
remember WHERE you were doing it.  Not in your own bedroom at home.   <br/>
Not in your own front yard.  Not with kids eight states away.   If  <br/>

in some dark place alone with a boy, or with a group of other teens  <br/>
drinking cheap wine, smoking dope...<br/>

Every one of my kids is older than I was when I had done things that  <br/>
would kid of panic me if they were doing them, but they&#39;re not; not  <br/>
even a little bit.<br/>

Marty&#39;s 17th birthday was held here at home, by his own agreement.   <br/>
There was another party for him the night before at a house owned by  <br/>
a newly 21 year old, who didn&#39;t go drinking on her birthday, who  <br/>
didn&#39;t have alcohol at her house.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 17 I was in college, going DAYS without my parents having  <br/>
any earthly idea where I was or who I was with, and I was very often  <br/>
not even in the same city they thought I was in, and with people they  <br/>
had never met and never would.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not true of my kids.<br/>
<br/>
A kid who&#39;s on the computer isn&#39;t out parking on a country road.<br/>
A kid who&#39;s not in school isn&#39;t out behind the bandroom ditching class.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-931835">Oh wait, I gave the wrong impression. I was online with permission and I was<br/>
talking online and playing games and could stay on for twenty four hours and<br/>
not think anything of it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I wrote viruses because I could but it was never damaging - in fact once I<br/>
realized what I had done. Really it was just supposed to be a project for<br/>
school because my teacher didn&#39;t think I could do it. The bug itself did no<br/>
harm except locking the computer and playing an annoying song - hence the<br/>
music bug. Once it started to spread I developed an anti-virus so that the<br/>
computer would unlock.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hacked but I didn&#39;t vandalize - it was a challenge to get into somewhere<br/>
you weren&#39;t supposed to but that is all. The challenge is what excited me<br/>
not doing anyone harm.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yes, had I been better guided I could have done more with it and probably<br/>
became a programmer or some kind of network security person but I didn&#39;t and<br/>
I hope to better with my children.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The point I was trying to make was that I am computer savvy and would not<br/>
suggest to anyone to block their children from something that I grew up<br/>
using. Kids will be kids and while they might not do things the way we want<br/>
them to as long as they aren&#39;t causing harm to themselves or others or<br/>
endangering themselves. well at some point we have to trust that we did a<br/>
good job raising them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My son is five and knows more about computing then I did at his age. I<br/>
didn&#39;t learn until age 7 or 8 - our first computer was a TRS-80 Color<br/>
computer on a B&W TV. It was such a big thing at the time there was a news<br/>
article in our local paper about buying the first home computer in our area.<br/>
My first &quot;disks&quot; were fifteen minute audio tapes. He will never have to time<br/>
a tape recording to a line enter on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Our children are facing the same situations we did in a different way as<br/>
well as new problems. Like being able to talk to thirty people online but<br/>
never having human interaction for that day. Like spending time with friends<br/>
and never really talking to them because they are all talking on their cell<br/>
phones. I am not saying that your children are doing anything bad - really I<br/>
didn&#39;t do anything bad either. Annoying maybe - sneaky yes - but not bad. I<br/>
think we all do our best to raise good kids.<br/>

Did you know?...<br/>
<br/>
--most well-known brands of lipstick contain lead?<br/>

--air fresheners have toxic ingredients you aren&#39;t supposed to breathe?<br/>

--most household cleaners have carcinogens and neurotoxins such as<br/>
<br/>
             formaldehyde, phenols and/or phosphates?<br/>
<br/>
--of 2,983 everyday products, 884 have toxic chemicals?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad we switched!<br/>

We are now safer and healthier, using toxic-free products and saving money,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-585237163">I&#39;ve got to weigh in here.  I&#39;ve thought long and hard about our kids and<br/>
exchange students having access to IM over the years.  At the moment, our<br/>
house rule is that you can chat with someone, so long as you&#39;ve met them in<br/>
person first.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for this is pretty basic: There are predators out there who<br/>
devote a great deal of time, energy, experience and effort to luring kids<br/>
into situations where they can be taken advantage of.  <br/>
<br/>
It comes down to a philosophy of parenting: I view my role as a parent as<br/>
being to let my kids bear the results of their decisions, so long as they<br/>
are able to deal with those results.  Asking a kid to fend off the<br/>
attentions of a determined online predator falls well outside of that<br/>
boundary.<br/>

I hope you get them out where they can meet people.  But they&#39;re in  <br/>

anything, than they are sitting in your house right in sight of you,  <br/>
aren&#39;t they?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

being to let my kids bear the results of their decisions,-=-<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;re not letting them practice making decisions like whether to  <br/>
chat with someone online.<br/>
Do they play X-Box Live?  Are they allowed in chatrooms if there&#39;s  <br/>
someone in there they&#39;ve met?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Asking a kid to fend off the<br/>
attentions of a determined online predator falls well outside of that<br/>
boundary.-=-<br/>
<br/>
We just haven&#39;t had that problem at all here.  My kids feel no need  <br/>
to communicate with anyone who&#39;s not fun for them, and determination  <br/>
does no good if a kid isn&#39;t needy.  My kids aren&#39;t needy of attention  <br/>
or acceptance, so online predators have nothing to offer them.<br/>
<br/>
Adults generally seem to prefer e-mail, but kids like instant  <br/>
messages.   It&#39;s an interesting kind of writing, because it&#39;s in real  <br/>
time, unlike anything done in school (besides passing notes in  <br/>
class).    I&#39;ve corresponded with MANY, many people I hadn&#39;t met in  <br/>
person first.  Pam Sorooshian and two of her daughters spent a week  <br/>
at our house last week, and we&#39;ve stayed at their house before.  I  <br/>
met Pam online.  I wasn&#39;t a predator; Pam wasn&#39;t a predator.<br/>
<br/>
I have a German friend I met online because he noticed we had the  <br/>
same birthday, month, day and year.  We&#39;ve had a long correspondence,  <br/>
and when we say &quot;When I was ten...&quot; the other knows exactly what year  <br/>
it was, and what the world was like.  He&#39;s visited here twice, and my  <br/>
kids like him.<br/>
<br/>
Holly went to a homeschooling campout where she met dozens of kids,  <br/>
and later was welcomed into their MSN discussions, many of whom chat  <br/>
in groups, so she&#39;s met (&quot;met&quot; online) friends of theirs who are in  <br/>
England and Wales, and chats with a guy from Sweden who was a friend  <br/>
of one of the HesFes kids.   On X-Box Live she has played games (and  <br/>
chatted aloud, with headphones and mics) with people from Canada,  <br/>
France, England, Poland and lots from Australia.  Her opponents last  <br/>
night were speaking Spanish; she doesn&#39;t know where they were from.   <br/>
(Obviously she&#39;s right here and I&#39;m asking her for details. &lt;g&gt;  I  <br/>
told her why I was asking, and she said &quot;I&#39;m not afraid of people in  <br/>
Sweden.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
The Live and Learn conference would never have happened if we didn&#39;t  <br/>
correspond with people we hadn&#39;t met in advance, or weren&#39;t willing  <br/>
to meet people with whom we&#39;d corresponded.<br/>
<br/>
If my kids were in school they would be in the company of dozens of  <br/>
adults and hundreds of children not chosen by me.  They would not be  <br/>
home with me.  Compared to that, instant messages are EXTREMELY safe.<br/>
<br/>
Rules invite sneakiness and dishonesty, too.  Our kids are very open  <br/>
with us and with each other.   Confidence in little choices and  <br/>
freedoms leads to bigger confidence and freedom.    Someone on one of  <br/>
these lists was IMing her niece who was a teen, and who said &quot;Don&#39;t  <br/>
tell my parents because I&#39;m not supposed to use IM.&quot;   The girl was  <br/>
old enough to reproduce; she was talking to her aunt; that&#39;s not a  <br/>
dangerous situation, yet her parents had set up a situation in which  <br/>
she was no longer honest with her.  And if they told her that using  <br/>
IM was extremely dangerous, they weren&#39;t being honest with her either.<br/>

If you concentrate on making sure your kids feel confident and  <br/>
secure, that they have someone to talk to when they have problems,  <br/>
who won&#39;t shut them out when the kids are thinking of things that  <br/>
make the parents uncomfortable then there isn&#39;t a need for rules to  <br/>

If you&#39;re a road block between your kids and what they&#39;re trying to  <br/>
get, then they&#39;re vulnerable to someone who says they can give it to  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids tell you something and your focus isn&#39;t on what they&#39;re  <br/>
saying but on how to get them to think right, then they&#39;re vulnerable  <br/>
to someone who will say &quot;I understand. Tell me about it.&quot;<br/>

My dh has shared that he believes that when the family is unhealthy,  <br/>
porn more likely beomces an addiction to fill a hole.<br/>
<br/>
I agree. I think it&#39;s the same as other &quot;internet dangers.&quot; If a  <br/>
child has nothing else to do and no affirmation of wholeness, the  <br/>
internet can be an escape from what seems a lack of life. But when  <br/>
life is big and real and happy, the child will be there, in his own  <br/>
real life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your perspective and style of interacting with your kids is  <br/>
refreshing and gives me hope.<br/>

Thanks. Sometimes when I write those things so plainly I worry that  <br/>
I&#39;ll cause more damage than good in some families. But since things  <br/>

How can you classify talking to &quot;people&quot; as not having human interaction?<br/>
<br/>
My mom lives a 4 hour drive over a snowy mountain pass away from us.  We recently got webcams and now do video chats with her.  Is that not &quot;interacting&quot;?  Sure we could go back to only exchanging letters with her.  Maybe we could even find someone to deliver them by horseback or wagon, just like the good old days!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is another mom on this list whom I exchanged kid&#39;s emails with a couple of years ago.  Her dd and mine are now the equivalent of penpals - except they instant message and sometimes video chat.  Yes, it started out with me giving my dd&#39;s email address to a STRANGER.  It has resulted in lots of laughs and both kids learning a little about other parts of the country.<br/>

kids safe.<br/>
<br/>
And if a child perceives that a parent isn&#39;t being absolutely  <br/>

If a parent says IMs lead to being taken away by predators and then  <br/>
their kids meet kids like my daughter Holly who very safely chat  <br/>
online and have for years, they might doubt their parents&#39;  view of  <br/>
the world in other ways.<br/>
<br/>
To use a further-off analogy, if a family has told their kids that  <br/>
Harry Potter books are satanic spellbooks and their children could  <br/>
summon the devil just by reading them, for one thing they&#39;re making  <br/>
those books WAY (way) more powerful than they are.  But when those  <br/>
children meet kids who have read Harry Potter, dressed up and played  <br/>
Hogwarts, who own all the DVDs and see the new movies the day they  <br/>
come out, and when they learn that some of those kids are from very  <br/>
religious families, many of them good Christians, the children will  <br/>
stop trusting their parents.  And especially if they see families in  <br/>
which the parents are kind and generous, while their own parents are  <br/>
being harsh and limiting and punitive, and blaming Jesus...   it&#39;s a  <br/>
good way to have them leave the church and not look back.<br/>
<br/>
Kids won&#39;t need a predator to come and get them if the parents are  <br/>
squeezing them out with rules and questionable truths.<br/>
<br/>
[Lars, I&#39;m not suggesting your family is at this point, but there&#39;s a  <br/>
continuum of rules and limits, and as there are principles at work,  <br/>
principles apply at both ends of the spectrum.]<br/>

Is the most probably risk of IMing with bad guys the possibility that if <br/>
a kid clicks on an unsolicited IM, the &quot;bad guy&quot; correspondent might <br/>
make obscene remarks or send dirty pictures?  That&#39;s what comes to my <br/>
mind as the most probable bad thing that could happen.  (Not the worst <br/>
&quot;bad thing&quot;, just the most common one.)<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine making a distinction between being approached by someone <br/>
who is a co-participant in a game vs. someone who just pops up out of <br/>
the blue.  (Yes, game co-participants can also be perverts.  I just <br/>
think the percentage might be lower.)<br/>
<br/>
We got a fast internet connection a few months ago, and my kid plays <br/>
online games.  I think I may be a little behind in the safety <br/>
discussion, but things are going well so far.  (I&#39;m not totally <br/>
disengaged, my husband is in the same room gaming much of the time -- <br/>
I&#39;ve just let HIM be the one to consider this issue.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m up for more discussion of big risks and little risks.<br/>
<br/>
I figure if *I mostly can&#39;t get my kid to leave the house*, no stranger <br/>
is gonna know what to offer him to get him thru the front door.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  When I was a curvaceous 15 year old, I got pissed at my family and <br/>
went for a 3 mile cross-town walk in a dress and barefoot (in the <br/>
afternoon).  Two or three men driving by pulled over and offered me <br/>
rides and opportunities to go out for coffee.  I was not at all tempted <br/>
to get in their cars!  (I needed to escape my family that day, but I <br/>
wasn&#39;t stupid.)  None of them hit me over the head and dragged me away.  <br/>
But I realize it could have happened.  Happy kids are less likely to be <br/>
out there being plump targets for stalkers.  I wouldn&#39;t have been out <br/>
there if I was having a happy day.</div>

My kids all have &quot;myspace&quot; pages.  Holly was in there first, but  <br/>
because she&#39;s only 14 her page can&#39;t be looked at by just anyone.   <br/>
You have to do a friend request and she has to approve it.   Marty  <br/>
made me a friend from his page (I made a page so I could see  <br/>
Holly&#39;s--), so I can see all of Marty&#39;s.  And Kirby&#39;s over 18 so his  <br/>
is just public.<br/>
<br/>
 From each kid&#39;s page you can see their friends, and if you click on  <br/>
those you can see some or all (depending on their age) of what they  <br/>
have in there.<br/>
<br/>
For a while Holly said she was 17, but that made me nervous so she  <br/>
changed it.  Then she changed it to 80 (some kids say they&#39;re 100, so  <br/>
it&#39;s clear they&#39;re not trying to be sneaky).  She has it back to 14.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s is easiest to remember:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://myspace.com/kirbydodd">http://myspace.com/kirbydodd</a><br/>
and you can get to Holly&#39;s and Marty&#39;s from there if you want.<br/>
Their user names (or whatever they call them) change from time to  <br/>
time and are sometimes suited to the day or the occasion.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s goofy kid-humor, so don&#39;t go in if you&#39;re easily grumpy about  <br/>
kids having fun.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, there are some people who are suggestive and &quot;talk dirty&quot;  <br/>
but my kids just feel sorry for them about not having anything real  <br/>
to discuss.  One of our friend&#39;s kids has fibbed about his ethnicity,  <br/>
just for fun I guess.  He said East Indian and he&#39;s not; then again  <br/>
he might&#39;ve changed it by  now anyway.  They&#39;re not like pages people  <br/>
make and leave along, at least not my kids and their friends.  They  <br/>
put new photos up every few days.<br/>
<br/>
There are quite a few unschoolers in there, too.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow it&#39;s just not the same as regular webpages.  It&#39;s a kidville  <br/>
kind of place.<br/>
<br/>
Some people use them as blogs, but my kids&#39; friends seem to use them  <br/>
just as photo places and comment-exchanging excuses.<br/>
<br/>
You might see some of Marty in his super-hero costume, &quot;Above Average  <br/>
Joe.&quot;     There&#39;s one of Kirby in armor, too.  I like that one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575094293">-=-I think the worrisome thing about &quot;myspace&quot; is that it&#39;s  <br/>
searchable in<br/>
a classifieds sort of way--by age (18+), gender, marital status<br/>
(&quot;swinger&quot; is one category), orientation, etc., which seems to point<br/>
toward the site&#39;s original intent . . . I imagine some grown-ups<br/>
searching there are surprised to find children.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
I received that off the list.<br/>
The purpose of the list, though, is to have discussion out where  <br/>
others can read and consider, so I&#39;ve brought it here.<br/>
<br/>
Bowlings alleys and movie theaters were originally intended for  <br/>
adults too.  The bowling alley near us serves beer.  Yet I let my  <br/>
kids go there.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see that as a worrisome thing about myspace.   My kids have  <br/>
lived their lives in a world that has people of all ages, genders,  <br/>
marital status and orientation.  They&#39;ve even known swingers (though  <br/>
I doubt they were aware of it).<br/>
<br/>
The kids say that Neopets was originally aimed at older teens, but  <br/>
younger kids liked it best and it&#39;s moved more toward their preferences.<br/>
<br/>
Probably AOL and yahoo profiles are searchable by gender, marital  <br/>
status, orientation, etc.   My kids have been online for a long time  <br/>
and haven&#39;t had problems.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to take super-cautious fears seriously, as those are  <br/>
theories and our lives are lived out whole.  Someone THINKS a child  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be safe if, but I know my children have been safe for years.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a dark alley in a foreign town.  It&#39;s my own kids, in my  <br/>
house, sitting in their own rooms, or at the kitchen table, or in the  <br/>
den.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent says &quot;Don&#39;t look behind that door,&quot; that&#39;s where the  <br/>
child will want to look when the opportunity presents itself.  Kids  <br/>
told &quot;Feel free to poke around&quot; will not become obsessed with any  <br/>
forbidden areas.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of literature is based on &quot;Don&#39;t look there&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t touch  <br/>
that,&quot; starting with Adam and Eve.<br/>
Pandora.<br/>
Disney&#39;s Beauty and the Beast. &lt;g&gt; (not the original)<br/>
Five Children and It.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-939317076">**I&#39;ve got to weigh in here.  I&#39;ve thought long and hard about our kids and<br/>
<br/>
exchange students having access to IM over the years.  At the moment, our<br/>
<br/>
house rule is that you can chat with someone, so long as you&#39;ve met them in<br/>
<br/>
person first.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The reason for this is pretty basic: There are predators out there who<br/>
<br/>
devote a great deal of time, energy, experience and effort to luring kids<br/>
<br/>
into situations where they can be taken advantage of.  **<br/>
<br/>
My kids know that if they meet someone online and decide they&#39;d like to get <br/>
together in real life, I&#39;ll do my very best to help make it happen. We&#39;ve <br/>
driven across states to meet up with families in their homes who we only know from <br/>
online until we get there. <br/>
<br/>
A predator would have a really really REALLY hard time getting my kid into a <br/>
situation they could be taken advantage of. A kid who isn&#39;t supposed to talk <br/>
to anyone they don&#39;t know has much incentive to agree to sneak out to meet that <br/>
person - the parent isn&#39;t going to agree because the kid was breaking the ru<br/>
les. They&#39;re easy prey. My kids, on the other hand, know that they can ask and <br/>
I&#39;ll drive them to a safe meeting. If the &quot;friend&quot; said &quot;Oh no, don&#39;t tell <br/>
your mom&quot; that&#39;s a huge red flag for them. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had some experience with abuse and predation attempts however. Both <br/>
were people in our community, introduced to us, in person, by people we trusted.<br/>

A while back Sandra wrote something about Holly watching this movie, so I looked it up at Netflix.  I found that there are 2 movies with that name, one is &quot;Five Children and It&quot; and one is &quot;5 Children and It,&quot; and the latter has a sequel called &quot;Return of It.&quot;   I added all 3 to my queue.  <br/>
<br/>
Just an aside...<br/>

Marty was going to meet a girl at the mall, when he was 13 or 14.  He  <br/>
had met her online, on a role playing game.  He was nervous.  He took  <br/>
a friend with him, and she took a friend with her.  They found each  <br/>
other and hung out a while.  There was no problem, except that she  <br/>
wasn&#39;t as interesting in person as she had been online, or maybe  <br/>
Marty didn&#39;t seem interesting enough to her or something.  So they  <br/>
hung out an hour or so and politely said see you online or some such,  <br/>
and Marty called for a ride home.<br/>
<br/>
A woman who also knew them from that game came to town from  <br/>
California.  She was 30ish and had not much social life other than  <br/>
that game, because she had a severely disabled daughter who was ten  <br/>
or so and so had been taking care of her (single mom) for years, and  <br/>
this was her first vacation.  I gave the kids some warnings, and they  <br/>
were never alone with her.  She brought them gifts--and kind of  <br/>
expensive gifts.  She brought one of the boys a backpacking guitar,  <br/>
and she brought Kirby an embroidered shirt and something (I forget),  <br/>
but basically had bought two gifts each for four teenaged boys.   <br/>
Partly I felt sorry for her, partly I was glad the boys had been  <br/>
enough fun online that she wanted to meet them, and partly I didn&#39;t  <br/>
trust her.  But it was all fine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-48442467">We (Simon, Linnaea and I) play on toontown.co.uk.  I really enjoy how<br/>
much comes across about other players based on limited, pre-scripted<br/>
conversations.  On toontown you can only talk to those people you<br/>
know, so you exchange a secret code that toontown gives you and off<br/>
the game and that allows you to chat directly with the person you<br/>
exchanged the code with.  With those individuals you don&#39;t know you<br/>
cannot have any conversation outside of the phrases that toontown<br/>
allots.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, it is clearly a human interaction.  The game makes it<br/>
essential that you work with others.  Linnaea likes to make friends. <br/>
Simon likes to make powerful friends. I tend to like to work with<br/>
other people, but not necessarily to befriend them.  We have a local<br/>
friend who plays the game, both Linnaea and Simon will rush to her<br/>
aid, but she is less likely to help them when it isn&#39;t specifically<br/>
helpful to her.  One player that Linnaea befriended the other day has<br/>
given her gifts.  Linnaea&#39;s favorite thing to do is to go over to<br/>
other people&#39;s houses and try on their clothes (in the game--in person<br/>
too, I suppose).  It seems a strange license to me, but she really<br/>
enjoys it.  And other players seem to enjoy doing the same thing, but<br/>
it varies.  <br/>
<br/>
It is fascinating to watch these semi-virtual relationships play out.<br/>

&gt; communication, and a little better than one way if I&#39;m actually  <br/>
&gt; learning as I read.    But discussions online are interaction.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve known some in-person visits that weren&#39;t worth the gasoline or  <br/>
&gt; footpower it took to get there, when the people are just the very  <br/>
&gt; same boring way as ever, or they&#39;re being mean or dishonest.  Better  <br/>
&gt; to be online where you can just close the window if you&#39;re not having  <br/>
&gt; any fun.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s just a different kind of human interaction. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
