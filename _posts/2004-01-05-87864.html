It&#39;s almost 5:00 here and it&#39;s sixteen below.   Our friends just called<br/>
from Race Track, about fourteen miles away and it&#39;s twenty six below<br/>

I guess we&#39;ll be staying in today and watching movies and  I don&#39;t want<br/>

Like the moon, New Mexico can have big differences in temperature within the <br/>
same day.  I was surprised in Minnesota to find that a hot summer day can mean <br/>
an equally hot summer night, and that in the winter the sun coming out might <br/>
make NO difference in temperature.  <br/>
<br/>
Here it can be 40 degrees, so in spring and fall there&#39;s a time when we run <br/>
the heater in the car if it&#39;s early morning, and the air conditioning in the <br/>
afternoon.  <br/>
<br/>
Lately it&#39;s only been 20 or 25  degrees difference, and that&#39;s no fun.  58 is <br/>
our highest predicted next week, and below freezing each night.   &quot;But at <br/>
least it&#39;s a dry cold.&quot;   HA HA HA.<br/>
<br/>
(but really, without humidity, it&#39;s easier to deal with than if it were also <br/>
foggy or snowy)<br/>
<br/>
Weather is fascinating to me.  We get so used to our own local clouds and <br/>
clues that other places can seem like other planets.   We were watching a movie <br/>
the other day and Marty said &quot;The clouds are upside down!&quot;  I said, &quot;No, it&#39;s <br/>
just Iowa.  They have different looking skies.&quot;<br/>

I&#39;m loving the Oregon fog and rain. It&#39;s such a change from the high <br/>
desert climate of Utah. We were in the mountains and it was dry as a <br/>
bone all summer and then 2 feet of snow for at least 6 months. But it <br/>
was a dry snow. &lt;g&gt; Really. Champagne powder they called it. I&#39;m <br/>
still glad to be rid of it.<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely. Our first few months of fog and mist were almost magical <br/>
for us.<br/>
<br/>
Right now though it&#39;s been snowing/sleeting/freezing for about 10 <br/>
days. It&#39;s supposed to be in the 50&#39;s by the weekend though. Then we <br/>
get flooding! Cool. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
~Mary, at home, warm and dry and chuckling that they close the <br/>
schools here for 1 inch of snow.</div>
