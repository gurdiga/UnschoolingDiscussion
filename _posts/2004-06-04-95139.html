<div id="ygrps-yiv-94012822">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I just want to say thank you for all the thoughtful responses to my posts.  I was so happy to find these when I got up this morning.  A lightbulb is coming on and I can see that I need to take a leap of faith with regards to my children and the choices they need to be able to make for themselves.  I get the bicycle analogy.  I won&#39;t know until I just let go, give it more than a try and see what happens with my children.  <br/>
<br/>
I want to respond to some of the posts in more detail, but my children are up and need me to be with them, so that will have to wait until I have more time.  I do have so many questions in my head, but I will try to try things first instead of asking you, &quot;what if&quot; questions.<br/>
<br/>
I do want to tell you about this morning--I&#39;m pleased with the way the morning is going, although I do have some questions in my mind as a result of the way I handled things today.  (Also I want to tell you of some successes!)  Stella, my 4 yo, got up and after cruising the kitchen said, &quot;Mommy, why are those chocolate chip cookies on the counter?&quot;  (This is her round about way to getting to &quot;Can I have one?&quot;  I think.)  I answered, &quot;Because Sarah (the 10 year old) and I ate some last night and I didn&#39;t put them away.&quot;  Stella  didn&#39;t say anything, but I could see that she wanted one, but was resisting asking because she thought I would tell her (in possibly an annoyed voice), &quot;Stella, you need to eat something healthy first before eating snack food like this.  Let&#39;s have breakfast first.&quot;  or something to that effect.  Because I could see that she wanted one, I said, &quot;You look like you&#39;d like one of those.&quot;  She nodded vigorously.  I said, &quot;Go ahead.  Would you like something else, too, or just cookies?&quot;  She thought about that for awhile and said she wanted &quot;regular breakfast stuff too.&quot;  I asked her what she wanted for breakfast.  She wanted cereal, and I knew that she meant cold, boxed cereal that we seldom have in the house.  I said, &quot;We only have hot cereal in the house today.  Is that okay?&quot;  She said &quot;yes,&quot; but I remembered that she had been asking for boiled eggs alot lately, but noone else wanted them, so I haven&#39;t made any.  I said, &quot;oh, I could also make boiled eggs if you want.&quot;  At first she said no, but then decided she wanted boiled eggs and no cereal.  I said okay and she ate a cookie, then she asked for another cookie.  I said, &quot;Yes, if you are still hungry for a cookie.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Now here I have a couple of questtions:<br/>
<br/>
1-  How do I subtly let her know the choice is hers, and that I&#39;m not controlling that choice.  She is so used to asking me first, and so am I, because I have been the controlling authority.  If I am really giving her control over what she eats, then she should just be able to go and eat cookies anytime.  Right? So should I say to her,  Which leads to another problem for me.<br/>
<br/>
2-  I am on a very limited income right now and I have 4 children and myself to feed, and then my husband when he is here on the weekends.  So, if, for example, Stella gets up first in the morning after me, which is usually the case, and eats all the cookies, which is pretty much what was happening this morning, not only is there nothing left for anyone else, but I can&#39;t afford to keep buying more.  I don&#39;t really want her just going into the cabinets to get whatever she wants, whenever she wants, because I need to be able to plan meals and meet the needs of all of us.  My answer would be to have certain foods that can be accessed anytime, and I usually make sure there is always some fruit and some veggies and some kind of snacky food like pretzels filled with peanut butter or whatever.  I can see giving them more choice about what&#39;s on hand, but what about the amount they eat?  And what if what they want uses up too much of the grocery budget for what it actually offers in both quality and quantity?  (ie:  Stella really wants me to buy the mixed fruit that is already cut up and in a plastic container that is in the produce section. They want a ridiculous amount of money for that.  Not only is it something that would be fresher and more abundant if I just bought the fruit and made it myself, but it would cost less per pound.  Still, even after I explain this to her, she still wants that plastic bowl of fruit.  If I had more money, I would probably just buy it and let her get it out of her system, but I am truly on a budget.  Our family is experiencing some financial difficulties right now.  I get so tired of saying no, but I often have to.  <br/>
<br/>
I suppose I could just let them eat whatever they want fromt the snack foods and when they are gone, they are gone until the next time I can stock up, but then I have to spend several days saying, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but we are out of that right now.&quot;  This is essentially &quot;No&quot; as well.  This already happens when I am the one deciding when and how much snack food they get.  Sigh...sometimes it is so hard to be aware...I mean, it&#39;s easy to be aware, but it hurts my heart sometimes when I can&#39;t be exactly how I&#39;d like to be.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, back to what happened at breakfast this morning:<br/>
<br/>
The other girls, Sarah (10) and Annie (3), woke up and each wanted something different for breakfast.  I said that I could do that, but some people would get their food before others, because of cooking times and available pots.  I also said that there may be some mornings when I won&#39;t feel like cooking so many different things.  They understood.  Stella wanted boiled eggs and didn&#39;t want any hot cereal with it.  Annie wanted hot cereal alone.  Sarah and I both wanted poached eggs on toast.  Evan, the baby who is 1 today, had a combination of all--some cereal, an egg yolk and a bit of toast.  It was fun to be able to give everyone what they wanted, and when I started to feel overwhelmed with all their choices (and my worries that it would be like this every morning), I brought myself back to the moment by breathing.  It worked amazingly well, and I stayed connected with everyone and with what I was doing.  Amazingly everything came out perfectly, AND I even thought of ways to make it easier in the future (putting more eggs in to boil, in case someone else wanted one now or tomorrow morning for example.)  Stella ended up wanting hot cereal too after I had already finished making only enough for Annie and the baby (after asking her if she wanted some too), and I told her that she could have a couple of bites of Evan&#39;s, and I could make her some for another meal, but I wouldn&#39;t make more at that moment, because I was already feeding Evan and juggling the other meals that were still cooking.  She seemed okay with that.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m not sure why I posted all that.   I guess I just want to get feedback and reassurance.  I can see that this will take a while to become natural for me.  I do tend to want to control things.<br/>

Stella doesn&#39;t exist in a vacuum. If she eats all the cookies, <br/>
everyone else tells her they are sad/mad/whatever that she ate all <br/>
the cookies. If you are worried about how her siblings will respond, <br/>
you just tell her what you&#39;re thinking and feeling. It was hard at <br/>
first for me to express my thoughts and feelings without trying to <br/>
manipulate, but I&#39;m getting better. They are my thoughts and feelings <br/>
and I want to be able to share them...sometimes, in some situations.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And what if what they want uses up too much of the grocery budget for <br/>
what it actually offers in both quality and quantity? &gt; <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I suppose I could just let them eat whatever they want fromt the <br/>

I can stock up, but then I have to spend several days saying, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
sorry, but we are out of that right now.&quot;  This is essentially &quot;No&quot; <br/>
as well. <br/>
<br/>
Or it&#39;s letting them see the cause and effect. You have to figure out <br/>
how much you can spend on groceries and then you can discuss the <br/>
different ways of spending it. A few expensive treats that are gone <br/>
in a day or lots of inexpensive treats that last until the next <br/>
shopping trip. Is one of these options wrong?? I don&#39;t think so, tho&#39; <br/>
I definitely know which one I&#39;d choose. <br/>
<br/>
Hey, or maybe they&#39;d rather have food treats than...toys <br/>
occasionally, or something else you spend money on. Who knows until <br/>
you ask??<br/>

<br/>
    My answer would be to have certain foods that can be accessed anytime, and I usually make sure there is always some fruit and some veggies and some kind of snacky food like pretzels filled with peanut butter or whatever.

<br/>
   Still, even after I explain this to her, she still wants that plastic bowl of fruit.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Could you buy it once and then refill that bowl with homemade stuff?<br/>
<br/>

I would start by just saying yes more, or offering things you know <br/>

<br/>
We go to Costco once a month and get a few things my son really <br/>
likes, like Gogurt and bagel dogs.  He can eat as much of those as he <br/>
wants in a given day, but when they are gone he has to wait until the <br/>
next time we go to Costco to get more.  I&#39;ve explained it to him and <br/>
he understands.  If he chooses to eat all the Gogurts in a week, I <br/>
just tell him we are out and won&#39;t get more until the next time we go <br/>
to Costco.  He is disappointed but he does understand.  Usually he <br/>
will eat a lot of whatever we got the first few days after we shop <br/>
and then he will slow down on eating them.<br/>

not the same kind of &quot;no.&quot;<br/>

have all she wanted.  After she had eaten 2or 3,  I said, &quot;Annie and Sarah<br/>
might want cookies too when they wake up and there are 5 left.&quot;  She left 3<br/>
for them on her own.  Also, and this surprized me, she left more than half<br/>
of the last one she started eating, and told me, without my asking, that she<br/>
was tired of eating cookies.  (!!)  She ate it a little while later when the<br/>
other girls ate some cookies, but still, I was a little surprized to see her<br/>
stop when she felt full.  In the recent past, she hasn&#39;t done that.  If she<br/>
was &quot;allotted a certain amount of some sugary treat, she would eat it all<br/>
even if she was full.  She&#39;s actually told me, &quot;I&#39;m really kind of full,<br/>
Mommy, but I don&#39;t want to miss out of this ice cream.&quot;  or something to<br/>
that effect.  Thinking about that now, I can see that she felt like she<br/>
might not get it again soon, so she ate it up.   Already even a  little<br/>
freedom with regards to sugar has made her a little less greedy about it!<br/>
While I expect it will take some time before she no longer feels that threat<br/>
of missing out on something, I do have hope that she will eventually eat<br/>
only when she is hungry.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since we have so few things in the cupboards that my young children would<br/>
want to eat, I hadn&#39;t thought about this.  I cook mostly from scratch and I<br/>
don&#39;t buy a lot of &quot;ready to pop in your mouth&quot; kind of foods that would be<br/>
easy to eat, except for fruit and things like baby carrots (and they have<br/>
full access to these anytime and they know it), so what usually happens is<br/>
they will ask me to make popcorn, for instance, or cook some other<br/>
particular meal they like, like the boxed macaroni and cheese, which is<br/>
something I wouldn&#39;t really choose, but that they like, so I keep it on hand<br/>
most of the time.  They couldn&#39;t even reach the cabinets where the food is<br/>
in this house, except by climbing on the counters.  I think at their age,<br/>
it&#39;s fine for them to just ask me to get something down. My older son, who<br/>
is fifteen and who now lives with his dad, always had full access to the<br/>
food once he could get inside the cabinets, now that I think about it.<br/>
(Actually, I was so much more relaxed about everything with him....I was<br/>
young and didn&#39;t worry about much.  He was one really mellow boy.  We lived<br/>
in a cabin in Homer, AK where I chopped wood for heat and hauled my own<br/>
water.  We went to the beach all the time, where we were surrounded by<br/>
mountains and glaciers across Kachemak Bay, and seals popped out of the<br/>
water to look at us.  It was a pretty charmed existence, even though there<br/>
were some rough patches.  I was just WAY more energetic.  Hmmm...and I had<br/>
healthier teeth and weighed less...and I had no pain in my joints.   Hey!<br/>

an adult I learned to eat much more than necessary because I feel like I never <br/>
had the choice as a kid.  It&#39;s funny how kids seem to eat when they are <br/>
hungry and adults tend to eat just because.<br/>

I&#39;m kinda guessing &quot;no.&quot;<br/>

We&#39;re doing something that I don&#39;t think has been done every before.  I could <br/>
be wrong, but I think this idea of food-freedom for kids is quite new.  I <br/>
first read about it in Mothering Magazine, mid-80&#39;s.  Does anyone know who wrote <br/>
that article?  I gave all my  issues away in box one day to a parenting <br/>
library.  <br/>
<br/>
I grew up with food being rationed out, counted, measured.  It was no fun.  <br/>
When I left home, I ate for comfort, I ate to reward myself, I ate if I was sad.<br/>
<br/>
The other day I was helping Holly pack for a camping trip and was <br/>
recommending maybe she take some snacks in her stuff to have in her own tent, in case she <br/>
got stressed.   <br/>
<br/>
I said it without even thinking.   She said, &quot;I eat when I&#39;m stressed?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She thought I was being mindful and observant.  No, I was running at the <br/>
mouth without a filter.  <br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;No, you don&#39;t.  I guess sometimes *I* do,&quot; and  I laughed.   <br/>
<br/>
She really doesn&#39;t eat when she&#39;s stressed.  She doesn&#39;t reward herself with <br/>
food.  She doesn&#39;t eat lots in case it will be gone later.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong, Joyce. Neither of my kids eats more than <br/>
they need/want, and haven&#39;t at any age. But I&#39;m also thinking that a <br/>
child overeating (not through anything the parents have taught it) is <br/>
not outside the range of possibilities. A few years back, we had a <br/>
dog that would overeat, which was always so surprising to me. With <br/>
all of the other dogs I&#39;ve ever had in my life, you could put a big <br/>
bowl of food out, and they would just eat as much as they needed to, <br/>
but this dog just didn&#39;t seem to have any internal shut-off <br/>
mechanism. She would literally eat herself sick. We also had to pick <br/>
up all the green apples that fell off of our apple tree because she <br/>
would eat *those* until she got really sick to her stomach. She would <br/>
eat blackberries too, picking them off with her teeth. I&#39;ve only met <br/>
one other dog like that, and this other one is worse. It eats rocks <br/>
and other weird stuff. Just as with these dogs, I do think that <br/>
occasionally, from time to time, it&#39;s possible for people to exist <br/>
who just don&#39;t have whatever it takes to regulate their eating. <br/>
People are also born without eyes or legs, or the ability to speak, <br/>
or whatever, so I can&#39;t imagine it would be impossible. Unlikely yes, <br/>
impossible no. I think it&#39;s important to remember that all the advice <br/>
on this list is just anecdotal - it&#39;s what works with our kids, it&#39;s <br/>
what we&#39;ve seen and what we describe from our personal experience. It <br/>
will most likely work with most kids out there. I&#39;m not convinced <br/>
that any one piece of advice will work for everyone. It&#39;s quite <br/>
possible that there are kids out there who will not self-regulate <br/>
their eating. I&#39;ve never met one, but it&#39;s totally possible.<br/>

I agree.  The mainstream advice doesn&#39;t work for everyone either, but works <br/>
for lots (depending on the criteria an individual uses to agree to &quot;works&quot;), <br/>
and school works for some but not all.<br/>

&lt;&lt;     The Summit on Obesity this week called this response evolutionary - <br/>

<br/>

first read about it in Mothering Magazine, mid-80&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       I know almost nothing about it, but I&#39;m interested in learning more. <br/>
The summit just ended Friday and seems to be news; it was being discussed on <br/>
NPR today as our family went to see the new Harry Potter. The movie made me cry <br/>
btw, but everything does these days -- that&#39;s another story. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       Because this list was speaking particularly of four-year-olds, it was <br/>
odd to hear one participant -- the author of a book called &quot;Fatland&quot; I think <br/>
-- say that obesity research shows a difference between age three and age five! <br/>
I didn&#39;t hear anything about limits or conditioning either way, just that <br/>
three-year-olds naturally self-regulate when food is plentiful (stop when full) <br/>
but five-year-olds keep eating past that point. <br/>
<br/>
       The clear implication from what I heard was that the research keyed in <br/>
on some developmental change at about age four, not any conditioning effect <br/>
of limits or plenty. <br/>
<br/>
       As I said, I don&#39;t know much but I&#39;d love to know more about this or <br/>
anything that might contradict it, from Mothering Magazine or elsewhere. <br/>
<br/>
       But I can&#39;t imagine any research finding that would nullify the value <br/>
of what unschoolers here have experienced and advised! Or the importance of <br/>
each person thinking through any research, idea, story or advice in the context <br/>
of one&#39;s own family and unschooling. Nothing I post is meant any other way. :) <br/>

<br/>
If they don&#39;t have controlled test groups, they&#39;re just observing the <br/>
prevailing culture,aren&#39;t they?<br/>
<br/>
Even if it was cross-cultural, many cultures are not living with plenty.<br/>
And those with more food tend toward controlling when, where and how much to <br/>
eat.<br/>

Sounds as if the children had started attending school at four!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Eat breakfast---FAST, because the bus will be here any minute. <br/>
 <br/>
Snacktime at 10:00, whether you&#39;re hungry or not. <br/>
 <br/>
Lunch at 12:00, whether you&#39;re hungry or not----and NO talking! Lunch is  NOT <br/>
a time for socialization; it&#39;s a time to eat----and you only have twenty  <br/>
minutes, anyway, so EAT!<br/>
 <br/>
Supper at 6:00 with the family because it&#39;s the time to reconnect with Dad,  <br/>
whom you haven&#39;t seen all day. Clean your plate---or no dessert.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know. I think it&#39;s an imposed reality, not a natural one.<br/>

My intellect tells me this must be so. But if someone like this were <br/>
found, it would be interesting to know if there were other areas in <br/>

Could they then using food as a response to that which is not related <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-326407914">Age 4-5....isn&#39;t that the time most kids enter preschool or kindergarten? I wonder if they even looked at that fact?<br/>
<br/>
I know in the schools I went to you had a set time to eat, and you HAD to eat as much as you could then, because you didn&#39;t get another chance.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that most preschools/kindergartens aren&#39;t as strict as elementry on up, but you still have set snack and lunch times.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;        Because this list was speaking particularly of four-year-olds, it was <br/>
&gt; odd to hear one participant -- the author of a book called &quot;Fatland&quot; I think <br/>
&gt; -- say that obesity research shows a difference between age three and age five! <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t hear anything about limits or conditioning either way, just that <br/>
&gt; three-year-olds naturally self-regulate when food is plentiful (stop when full) <br/>
&gt; but five-year-olds keep eating past that point. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;        The clear implication from what I heard was that the research keyed in <br/>
&gt; on some developmental change at about age four, not any conditioning effect <br/>
&gt; of limits or plenty. </span></blockquote></div>

&gt; in Germany but doesn&#39;t post anymore.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She said (paraphrasing here) that she noticed she was getting<br/>
&gt; impatient with her son because he always asked her - even though she<br/>
&gt; always said yes.  One day she was a bit irritated and asked him why<br/>
&gt; did he always ask when he already knew she would say yes.  His reply<br/>
&gt; (he was 6 or 7 - young) was that he was just checking to make sure<br/>
&gt; someone else didn&#39;t want or need what he wanted.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is sweet, and good for me to hear, because I have been wondering when<br/>
they would start thinking of others when they make their food choices.  (I<br/>
don&#39;t expect it right away, though they might surprize me!)<br/>
