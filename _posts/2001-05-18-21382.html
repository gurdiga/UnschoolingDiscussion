<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443239578"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: &quot;Kim&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sinclai@...">sinclai@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Kim, I wanted to address your post on this subject. My mail server<br/>
cr*pped out so I haven&#39;t been getting this list for a couple of days, but<br/>
from searching on the yahoogroups website, it doesn&#39;t look to me like this<br/>
thread was continued, so here goes...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We also take a handful of multiple vitamins every night.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t tell from this sentence whether you are saying  you take a bunch of<br/>
the same multi-vitamins, or if you just mean that you take a bunch of<br/>
different vitamins but thought I&#39;d mention that taking a handful of one type<br/>
of multi-vitamin could be dangerous. There are some vitamins you can OD on<br/>
(especially in concentrated form), or at least are not healthy in large<br/>
amounts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think we could get enough of the vitamins in the foods we eat<br/>
&gt;otherwise.  We are also overweight, so we can&#39;t eat too much, at least<br/>
&gt;enough to get all the vitamins we need.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, this is what I wanted to address, because nothing could be further<br/>
from the truth. If you eat a well-balanced diet full of fresh fruits and<br/>
vegetables, whole and sprouted grains, and natural protein sources, you<br/>
should easily be able to get enough vitamins *and* lose weight safely.<br/>
Aiming to lose a pound or *less* a week is a healthy way to lose weight -<br/>
slowly and healthily. I have definitely been there, I was overweight most of<br/>
my life and lost almost 70 pounds through healthy eating and exercise. Then<br/>
when I got pregnant with each of my kids, I gained 60+ pounds each time. So<br/>
I&#39;ve had to do that weight-loss battle 2 more times as well. It took me<br/>
about a year each time to lose the weight, at 1/2 to 1 pound a week. It is<br/>
hard not to buy into the &quot;diet&quot; fad, but much healthier to make a total<br/>
lifestyle change and become healthy for life.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, that eating healthily of natural foods, you might not get every<br/>
single vitamin in every single day. But over the course of a week, you<br/>
should get all that you need. If you are eating foods that are full of<br/>
nutrition, instead of nutrition-poor junk foods, you should not have any<br/>
trouble losing weight while getting the proper nutrition. For instance, a<br/>
baked potato is only 200 calories, and has tons of vitamins and minerals<br/>
(vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, b vitamins, magnesium, calcium, folate,<br/>
zinc). By contrast, a McD&#39;s french fries has at least twice the calories,<br/>
and about 1/4 the vitamins.<br/>
This website is a great place to look up the nutritional content of any<br/>
food:<br/>

<br/>
It shows calories, fat and sodium content, and 29 separate nutrients.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a good page that contains the short &quot;facts&quot; on each major vitamin,<br/>
and lists foods that are sources:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We have looked into the raw-foods<br/>
&gt;thing as well, but we don&#39;t have the discipline to eat just raw foods!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Eating just raw foods is great, but it&#39;s not necessary for having a healthy<br/>
body!<br/>
Also, exercise is a great mood booster, especially when combined with<br/>
healthy foods. Depression runs in my family and my sister is Bi-polar, as is<br/>
my dad I suspect (though he has not been diagnosed). My sister has been able<br/>
to control her depression through exercise and diet alone. I know for myself<br/>
that if I don&#39;t exercise every day, my mood takes a definite turn for the<br/>
worse.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saying all of this because I have spent years of my life being<br/>
overweight and unhealthy. I know how wrong it feels, how depressing it is,<br/>
and how hard it can be to change. But I also know what it feels like to come<br/>
out the other side, so I hope I have offered something here to encourage you<br/>
to make this a total lifestyle change for your family! I think modeling<br/>
taking good care of our bodies is one of the best gifts we can give our<br/>
children.<br/>
