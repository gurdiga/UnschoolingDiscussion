<div id="ygrps-yiv-699606442">When I was growing up we were allowed to have candy on Saturdays only because we had two elderly neighbor ladies that would give us candy every day, anytime they saw us.  Because we liked them (and the treats) so much we saw them a LOT!  However, eating candy that much made us not hungry for meals and we couldn&#39;t sleep at night until late and of course there was school to think of!  Consquently, Saturday was Candy Day!  All the candy we were given throughout the week was saved up for that day.  After we moved when I was nine the reason for Candy Day was no longer there but we still thought of Saturdays as Candy Day.  <br/>
