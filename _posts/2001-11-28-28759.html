<div id="ygrps-yiv-102661436"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So as an unschooler, if your child comes to you with a story she&#39;s<br/>
&gt;written, do you point out the spelling/grammar mistakes or not?<br/>
&gt;Sheila<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t. unless she *asked* me to help her proofread. Think about it this<br/>
way. If you wrote a love sonnet, or song, or short story and proudly showed<br/>
it off to your best friend, and she pointed out all the mistakes you made,<br/>
how would you feel? Another way to think about it - dc spends quite a while<br/>
drawing a picture of the new baby elephant at the National Zoo, she puts her<br/>
heart and soul into this painting, adding colorful details such as the spots<br/>
on the baby&#39;s trunk, the bale of hay that the mother elephant eats, the<br/>
rubber ball that the keepers put in the pen for the baby to play with. She<br/>
skips over to her Daddy and shows him her beautiful drawing. He says &quot;Very<br/>
nice dear, but an elephant doesn&#39;t have a long tail like a horse, and babies<br/>
don&#39;t have tusks yet, and grown up elephants don&#39;t eat hay. Why don&#39;t you do<br/>
this over with the corrections?&quot; Does the dc joyously go back to the table<br/>
and do it over? I wouldn&#39;t think so.<br/>
Many years ago when my older brother was a teenager, he wrote a poem at<br/>
summer camp and sent it to our Grandpa. Gramps sent him back a letter that<br/>
enclosed the poem, in which he had highlighted all the spelling and<br/>
grammatical mistakes. My brother never again shared his writing with our<br/>
Gramps and still brings this hurt up today. (He is now 48). How sad.<br/>
