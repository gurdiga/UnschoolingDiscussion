<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359517391">Well, folks, this list is not what I thought it would be. I needed a forum <br/>
to receive support and ideas on how to keep on doing what we are doing. I <br/>
could bring up my questions, but really, with all the talk of religions, <br/>
heaven, and hell - &lt;shrug&gt; I understand lists go through periods of off <br/>
topics, however, this is too much for me to have to wade through to get the <br/>
one or two pieces of mail that would be helpful to me.<br/>
<br/>
Going now to unsub.<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874054874">NOOOOO Bob.. don&#39;t stop posting.. <br/>
please.. we like you here.. <br/>
i may think you are a bit narrow minded.. but a lot of people think I&#39;M a total lunatic.. and i keep posting.. <br/>
<br/>
i mean when you get a bunch of intelligent strong people together there is going to be strong dialogue.. personally i enjoy it.. most lists are way wimpier than this one.. <br/>
<br/>
and by the way.. who said god was a HE? i think it was some midieval monk holding onto his job, myself.. <br/>
