<div id="ygrps-yiv-597368603">You&#39;re taking the fun out of it with the planning.  A food fight can be as<br/>
simple as splotching your ice cream cone on their nose (or their ice cream<br/>
cone as they try to take a bite), throwing a cup of water on them on a hot<br/>
day when you are drinking (we did this at an ice cream place - our friends<br/>
actually started the fight with our kids, and we ended up chasing each other<br/>
with water from a water fountain in cups for at least two hours, it was<br/>
great and we couldn&#39;t go past that ice cream place without the kids asking<br/>
to stop and play again).  The surprise is half the fun.  They can&#39;t know<br/>
that it&#39;s coming, and hot days with cool liquids are the best IMNSHO.  But<br/>
if you do want to use actual &quot;food,&quot; you could use veggies cooked soft like<br/>
they do in the movies and stuff.  Anyway, enjoy.<br/>

I am just curious about food fights.  My ds Andrew, 6 has requested such an<br/>
activity after watching a couple in movies and I&#39;m all for it but has anyone<br/>
ever done it?  I am thinking outdoors and garden hose.  He likes to help<br/>
cook<br/>
and we talked about making things for this &quot;adventure&quot;.  Like mashed<br/>
potatoes,<br/>
jello, and other relatively soft things so they don&#39;t hurt on impact after<br/>
being launched at someone.  I asked why he&#39;d like to do it.  He said it<br/>
looks fun.<br/>
 So my questions are:  Will the fun be lost in the planning of this activity<br/>
or should we just do it one day without his knowledge to retain the element<br/>
of<br/>
surprise?  What other food ideas?  Has anyone done this, am I crazy?  Any<br/>
ideas?</div>

Right.  But giving kids the idea that it&#39;s okay could cause a BiGtime problem <br/>
in a public place or someone else&#39;s dining room.<br/>
<br/>
Things are funny in Three Stooges movies that aren&#39;t funny in real life.<br/>
<br/>
One thing Marty and Kirby did want to do when they were little was <br/>
pie-in-the-face.  We got pre-made pie crusts and spray whipped cream and did one for <br/>
each, on the patio in the back yard.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Maybe choose a couple of &quot;stock&quot; ingredients for the arsenal, but then <br/>
have <br/>
each participant bring a &quot;secret&quot; choice to add to the table? It would give <br/>
some room for creativity and a little bit of surprise to see what folks <br/>
brought. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, good idea.  And you could sit down like for a garden party.  You could <br/>
wear straw hats.  You could serve tea.  You could be formal and then insult <br/>
someone&#39;s hat who throws a pea at yours, and from there, in tea-party persona, the <br/>
fight would have a purpose.<br/>
