<div id="ygrps-yiv-388581882">What about looking  for books about knot tying at the library.  At our <br/>
library they&#39;re located near the ones about sailing.  You might also be able <br/>
to find information on-line.  Maybe a site about scouting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292924486">Thanks for offering!  I mentioned it to my dad, who was looking at it <br/>
and is pretty sure he can do it.  He did the flagpole, but when he <br/>
was here the kids had lost the other part.  I&#39;ve since found it and <br/>
am saving it for him.  I think one of the strings might be lost now, <br/>
but hopefully that will show up before he visits again.  He said the <br/>
flag pole was just a regular square knot (it looked like a fancier <br/>
knot than that in the picture--I wish they would use some words!)  <br/>
Although now that I think about it I don&#39;t even know what a square <br/>
knot is.  I&#39;m lucky I can tie my shoes! lol  He thinks the other knot <br/>
is a square knot or maybe a slip knot--nothing complicated according <br/>
to him.  Whatever, as long as he ties them!  Shame on me, that&#39;s not <br/>
a very good unschooling attitude to be modeling for my kids.  But I <br/>
really, really tried--for an HOUR, and then another hour trying to <br/>
match the picture of the knot to pictures on the web.  <br/>

I learned this poem for tying a square knot. Start by holding the ropes ends <br/>
one in each hand. &quot;Left over right, (pull new right end of rope through the <br/>
loop) then right over left,(pull new left end of rope through loop) makes a <br/>
knot that&#39;s neat and tidy and tight.&quot;<br/>
