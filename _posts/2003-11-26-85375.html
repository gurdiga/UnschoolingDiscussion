**********************************************<br/>
This is the case with taking my 3 of my kids back out of school (homeschooled <br/>
their whole lives, went public a couple of years, now back to homeschooling) <br/>
and the oldest 2 are 17 and 13!  Today Charlotte (oldest) pulled out some <br/>
jigsaw puzzles and a game, and all kinds of activities and played with our 11 and <br/>
12 yo foster sons (home from school for a week), and 10 yo adopted son.  She&#39;s <br/>
able, again, to just be a &quot;little&quot; kid and enjoy it.  My 13 yo daughter is a <br/>
happy, bubbly kid again, not a tired, sullen grouch.  Once in a while she gets <br/>
lonely for her friends at school, so I am very easy about her spending the <br/>
night with friends, (especially homeschool friends) and I am happy to take her <br/>
just about anyplace.  I&#39;m so happy I have my kids back again too.<br/>
