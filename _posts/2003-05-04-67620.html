<div id="ygrps-yiv-931842984">The Buzzard, The Bat and The Bumblebee<br/>
<br/>
If you put a buzzard in a pen six or eight feet square and entirely open<br/>
at the top, the bird, in spite of his ability to fly, will be an<br/>
absolute prisoner. The reason is that a buzzard always begins a flight<br/>
from the ground with a run of ten or twelve feet. Without space to run,<br/>
as is his habit, he will not even attempt to fly, but will remain a<br/>
prisoner for life in a small jail with no top.<br/>
<br/>
The ordinary bat that flies around at night, a remarkable nimble<br/>
creature in the air, cannot take off from a level place. If it is placed<br/>
on the floor or flat ground, all it can do is shuffle about helplessly<br/>
and, no doubt, painfully, until it reaches some slight elevation from<br/>
which it can throw itself into the air. Then, at once, it takes off like<br/>
a flash.<br/>
<br/>
A Bumblebee if dropped into an open tumbler will be there until it dies,<br/>
unless it is taken out. It never sees the means of escape at the top,<br/>
but persists in trying to find some way out through the sides near the<br/>
bottom. It will seek a way where none exists, until it completely<br/>
destroys itself.<br/>
<br/>
In many ways, there are lots of people like the buzzard, the bat and the<br/>
bee. They are struggling about with all their problems and frustrations,<br/>
not realizing that the answer is right there &quot;above&quot; them.<br/>
