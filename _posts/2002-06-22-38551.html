<br/>
There are lots of books about unschooling, but I&#39;d like to recommend some <br/>
that aren&#39;t directly about it and yet have affected some people strongly <br/>
(including many of the homeschooling philosophers).   <br/>

<br/>
at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://SandraDodd.com/conferences/Sacramento2001">http://SandraDodd.com/conferences/Sacramento2001</a><br/>
<br/>
there is a list (scroll down) of a few books which really affected my <br/>
thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to cut and paste from there but it messed up.  I&#39;ll try in a separate <br/>
e-mail.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-300377823">If it&#39;s ok to do a little self promotion here as well as answer Scout&#39;s<br/>
question--my book &quot;The Parent&#39;s Guide to Homeschooling&quot; has a long section<br/>
in it on different homeschooling techniques/methods with an emphasis on<br/>
unschooling since this is what we do here. You can find out all about the<br/>
book on amazon.com or www.marspub.com.  Thanks,<br/>
