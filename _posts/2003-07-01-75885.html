<div id="ygrps-yiv-681600064">Reading what Pam wrote about how she came to be confident with unschooling has me thinking about something I do think about from time to time. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t at all think everyone just get some concepts right away. There are many things that take me awhile before I understand to my comfort level. <br/>
<br/>
Unless I&#39;m not just seeing it though, unschooling, for me has never been a struggle. And the reason why I bring it up is because I&#39;m not sure why it hasn&#39;t been, or maybe I just haven&#39;t *seen* it. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been parenting a lot longer than I&#39;ve been unschooling and parenting is harder for me to get. I do have to make a definite effort every day to watch what I say or what I do or how I handle a certain situation. I&#39;m hoping as my kids get older, I won&#39;t have to as much. I know with Tara now it&#39;s so much easier to not do the wrong thing!<br/>
<br/>
We wanted to homeschool way before Joseph was ready to go according to his age. He was 2 when we joined our local homeschool support group. At that time, I wasn&#39;t really interested in checking out exactly *how* to go about it. We just knew we wanted to. Within a year, I met someone locally who was very much an unschooler. Knowing more now, I still know she really got it. She explained what it was to her and what they did and didn&#39;t do. It all just made so much sense to me right away. Maybe because the kids were still really little. But I did have a daughter in school and my husband and I had always gone to school. I remember telling my husband about it and reading one book about the Colfaxes. I never went searching again for more information. I have read other things, but just because they seemed interesting to me. Not really looking for info.<br/>
<br/>
I just wish my respectful parenting ways came as easy to me as the unschooling did.<br/>

<br/>
Just the other day we were at the fabric store picking out stuff for a Harry <br/>
Potter robe. I was SOOO frustrated at Duncan&#39;s indecision. Looking back, I see <br/>
ALL those fabrics and they&#39;re ALL so beautiful and shiny and soft and...well, <br/>
I do that too!<br/>
<br/>
But he&#39;d changed his mind only a dozen times or so! Black with blue and <br/>
purple. No, black with red and yellow. No, grey with garnet and gold. No, shiny <br/>
black with the silvery stars. I was about to pull my hair out!<br/>
<br/>
Finally he blew up at me that it was HIS robe and didn&#39;t I understand that he <br/>
wanted it a certain way?  Why couldn&#39;t I see what was important to him?<br/>
<br/>
Gotta love &#39;im! &lt;G&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s black with red trim on the hood and mantle with silvery stars on the <br/>
sleeves and a black hat with yellow lining. Whew!!!<br/>
<br/>
Short of wanting to strangle him---well, it was more about time and <br/>
money---(final cost? $25! and time spent? 1 hour!)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s going to be SO THRILLED with this robe! It will be all worth it. I&#39;m a <br/>
GOOD unschooling mom---a &quot;radical&quot;, so I hear---but I still struggle with being <br/>
the most respectful mom I can be! <br/>

Good for you and good for him. I think it helps a lot, well especialldy with<br/>
me, when the kids can snap me back to reality. Every now and then Joseph<br/>
will say, &quot;well why are you getting mad at me???&quot; That&#39;s my note to chill a<br/>
bit. Of course Tara will say something, but so far Sierra and Alyssa won&#39;t.<br/>
I&#39;m actually looking forward to when they will too. It helps me because<br/>
sometimes I don&#39;t see how I&#39;m getting.<br/>
<br/>
We have summer kids cards for the Blockbuster store for free family movie<br/>
rentals. So the first time I got it, I picked out a movie. Then I figured I<br/>
would take Alyssa and let her pick, then Sierra and then Joseph. It&#39;s only<br/>
one movie a day. So I went on Monday with Alyssa and we spent a half an hour<br/>
in the family section while she picked one up and said maybe this, then<br/>
NOOOOOOO and went along to do it about 100 times. At the end of the time,<br/>
before I was just about to scream she ended up telling me what she wanted.<br/>
It was the same movie we had just brought back. The 2nd Peter Pan movie. So<br/>
I had to tell the girl to get it for me from the bin I had dropped it into.<br/>
<br/>
Then we got to go grocery shopping. I had about $200.00 worth of stuff to<br/>
get and Alyssa insists on pushing the cart the whole way. She&#39;s not yet 3 so<br/>
you can imagine how long it took us. I was trying so hard to be good and I<br/>
did a pretty good job if I do have to say so. She was just having such a<br/>
good time!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Luckily I made it home before I erupted. My other two came running out of<br/>
the house to greet me and helped with bringing in the groceries. I was all<br/>
better then. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Our local grocery store has self check units available and my kids love em.  It (seems) takes forever!  Oh well, if they decide to get a job as a checker someday they&#39;ll have previous experience!<br/>
