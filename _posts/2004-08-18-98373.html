<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861658148">Hi Robyn,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to see you are in the middle of such unfun stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Makes me glad the only children that come over are ones with whom my <br/>
parenting skills don&#39;t CLASH! yikes.<br/>
<br/>
In my home there are guidelines and restictions when my daughter goes <br/>
out with me I try to keep her within reasonable boundaries and when I <br/>
leave her with families I tell them what we are accustomed to and <br/>
hope they will try to respect that but I know my daughter will wander <br/>
as far into whatever appeals to her as she can get.<br/>
<br/>
There is a mom in my local group however whose kids tho &#39;restricted&#39; <br/>
as many might think of them would never stray from what they know by <br/>
home example to be appropriate without qualms.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot be sure what causes this but it does lead me to believe <br/>
setting limits does not always mean children will rebel and resent.<br/>
<br/>
Families are so complex we may never really figure it all out.<br/>
<br/>
But also watching some families and kids it does seem that tho in age <br/>
many children are old enough to make their own choices in actuality <br/>
they are not mature enough, not being groomed toward that outcome, or <br/>
the parents simply do not want to relinquish their control over <br/>
certain issues so the children reamain stunted or at least contained.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent leaves a child with me I feel it appropriate to tell them <br/>
what my ideas are on food nutrition snacks etc before they leave and <br/>
let them know I will treat their children according to those <br/>
guidelines unless we predetermine some other course of action.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not my job alone to over ride, undermine or enforce their rules.<br/>
<br/>
The control and other issues being showcased in the playmate you have <br/>
shared about are complex and on a core level not about anything <br/>
tangible so there might be little you can do to change negative <br/>
behaviors from this vantage point.<br/>
<br/>
ggrrr 2 minute warning this is no way to discuss such issues but I <br/>
have to truncate myself right now.<br/>

My reaction was a little different, as it struck me as being pretty<br/>
DISrespectful of the *nine* year old visitor, who surely is old <br/>
enough  .. Which brings me to what is a bit of a dilemma: <br/>
 .. bowls...and she then ate no more. If he asked for ice cream (or <br/>
anything actually) she immediately wanted the same (then didn&#39;t eat <br/>
it except for the ice-cream). ..  I HATE FEELING AN OBLIGATION TO SAY <br/>
THIS KIND OF STUFF.</div>

<br/>
I fortunately don&#39;t need to leave Jayn with anyone - only ever did so once.<br/>
I am always nearby on her play-dates.<br/>
<br/>
I think if I were to, I would do as you do and explain the freedoms that<br/>
Jayn lives by in terms of food. It is as simple as &quot;Jayn may eat or drink as<br/>
much or little of anything she likes whenever she wants, but she is allergic<br/>
to peanuts.&quot; I would not be leaving her with someone who was uncongenial or<br/>
unwilling to let her eat her food, or leave it either (and I would always<br/>
have the food bag to leave with her)<br/>
<br/>
My job as an Unschooler is to help Jayn wander as far into everything that<br/>
appeals to her as she wants to, and as far as we can manage from a practical<br/>
point of view. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your daughter is &quot;testing those boundaries&quot; to use some<br/>
jargon from modern parenting. Are we still talking about food?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;There is a mom in my local group however whose kids tho &#39;restricted&#39; <br/>
as many might think of them would never stray from what they know by <br/>
home example to be appropriate without qualms.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Would never&quot; is a big phrase.<br/>
<br/>
Does &quot;qualms&quot; mean these are children who are afraid of their parents, or<br/>
punishment? Jayn has no fear of dh or me. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I cannot be sure what causes this but it does lead me to believe <br/>
setting limits does not always mean children will rebel and resent.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you recommending restrictions then? I&#39;m not understanding your point. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;But also watching some families and kids it does seem that tho in age <br/>
many children are old enough to make their own choices in actuality <br/>
they are not mature enough, not being groomed toward that outcome, or <br/>
the parents simply do not want to relinquish their control over <br/>
certain issues so the children reamain stunted or at least contained.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for the opportunity to cross post something I wrote<br/>
several weeks ago on U/B. Warning to members of both lists - here comes some<br/>
of the &quot;Buzz Words&quot; post again - feel free to stop reading now if this is<br/>
old news.<br/>
<br/>
Slightly Modified Quote Begins:<br/>
<br/>
I am going to look at some semantics here... because of a larger issue of<br/>
how we as Unschoolers are beyond a lot of modern parenting and its<br/>
discourses.<br/>
<br/>
I want to suggest the idea that in the wider parenting world the words<br/>
&quot;implementing limits&quot;, or more usually &quot;setting limits&quot;, is a buzz word<br/>
phrase - politically correct jargon of supposedly aware parenting, which can<br/>
often be translated into &quot;controlling the children&#39;s behavior&quot;. &quot;Limits&quot; can<br/>
mean &quot;what parents tolerate in their comfort zone&quot;. Similarly, the term<br/>
&quot;consequences&quot; is often a euphemistic way of saying &quot;punishments&quot; - even<br/>
though time outs or grounding or doing specific related chores (like washing<br/>
the walls off [after drawing on them] for example) are orders of magnitude<br/>
better than old fashioned strategies like screamed insults, shame and guilt,<br/>
spanking, being sent to bed with or without supper, or being sent off to<br/>
military school or ensconced in a nunnery. <br/>
<br/>
Lists that discuss unschooling often include so much that is about changing<br/>
your parenting on a deep thought level, so using these part-time buzz words<br/>
may spark unexpected semantics based responses. From the TV series based on<br/>
the Buddhist folk tale &quot;Monkey&quot;: &quot;With our thoughts we make the world&quot;. With<br/>
(only) our words, we make our thoughts known online. <br/>
<br/>
Another modern parenting idea is &quot;Give your children choices&quot;. How could<br/>
this be problematic for Unschoolers? Well, I recall an episode of Oprah<br/>
where a very nice modern mother was enthusing about the various strategies<br/>
she uses for ease of parenting and family life - her big tool was &quot;giving<br/>
kids choices&quot; that included which color of jacket to put on. For anyone who<br/>
has been around unschooling for even a little while, it just looks like<br/>
manipulation - hmmm, actually it *is* manipulation (and [she was] proud of<br/>
it!). The choices aren&#39;t real, they are &quot;practice choices&quot; in situations<br/>
that are resoundingly trivial, because the idea is to fool the kid into<br/>
behaving a certain way, and any alternative outside of the two or three<br/>
parent sanctioned ideas is not &quot;given&quot;. Again, a huge improvement over no<br/>
choices at all and fear based obedience, but not as enlightened as<br/>
unschooling can be. Gosh, it sounds smug to use &quot;enlightened&quot; but it still<br/>
seems the best word.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are usually on a path towards real choices that their children<br/>
&quot;make&quot; rather than being &quot;given&quot; or &quot;permitted&quot;. Sometimes this means<br/>
gritting your teeth and biting your tongue. Occasionally these real choices<br/>
are likely to have crummy (but presumably not life or limb threatening)<br/>
results, especially when the children are young. For most &quot;ordinary parents&quot;<br/>
the teeth gritting over bad choices comes when the youngster is grown up or<br/>
in their late teens and is suddenly &quot;given&quot; (translation: mandatory<br/>
acceptance) responsibilities and adult behavior expectations. We get to<br/>
practice gritting for way longer. ;)<br/>
<br/>
One quantum leap in thinking is letting go of the &quot;giving&quot; of choices.<br/>
Instead it becomes about &quot;creating&quot; an environment and lifestyle where the<br/>
children, and indeed the adults in the family, have the opportunity to make<br/>
real choices, or dither about making them. A principles-based lifestyle,<br/>
instead of a hierarchy.<br/>
<br/>
It becomes about letting go of the need to ensure that they are &quot;learning<br/>
from their mistakes&quot; and not have every bad result elucidated for them, as<br/>
if they were too stupid to notice that they felt cold when they didn&#39;t<br/>
choose any jacket. (Just quietly bring the favorite along, or keep a spare<br/>
in the car without comment). When consequences are seamlessly obvious, they<br/>
need not be mentioned. <br/>
<br/>
In this created life follwing this leap, the thought processes behind<br/>
choices can be unsullied by the suspicion that the parents are trying to<br/>
manage and control (or just bullshitting). It becomes about a parent not<br/>
being emotionally attached to the free advice they are able to give when<br/>
asked, by children who actually trust their parents to express only truthful<br/>
and plausible misgivings, and help brainstorm around those problems.<br/>
<br/>
It means that the parents get to own and express their own varying comfort<br/>
levels, without the rigid concept of &quot;setting limits&quot;. It means that the<br/>
children don&#39;t have to constantly look for the delineation of those limits<br/>
and test their validity.  <br/>

outlooks.  You don&#39;t need to feel obligated to be friendly with people you <br/>
don&#39;t like just to broaden their minds.  I think we, just naturally, will <br/>
tend to expose our young kids to people who are &quot;like-minded&quot; because they <br/>
are our friends. As they get older they will make friends with kids you <br/>
aren&#39;t nuts about.  It&#39;ll happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037837964">Hi TIA,<br/>
<br/>
Your question is of course rather rhetorical glad you are living and <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
What I was thinking as I wrote was the decision to have children come <br/>
over to my house for a playdate usually comes about when I am talking <br/>
to friends. Which not that we all think exactly alike but have at <br/>
least come to some agreements on how to handle letting our children <br/>
be together and how our different parenting styles can be implemented <br/>
and or respected.<br/>
<br/>
In our daily activities we are exposed to whomever comes into our <br/>
path learning from them enjoying what is enjoyable about them etc. <br/>
which I think is all that is reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
Staying open to that is I think beneficial. <br/>
<br/>
Knowing what parameters you can comfortably navigate in when <br/>
encountering or getting to know better someone new is I think helpful.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of what types of people children will ultimately be exposed <br/>
to is bigger than the people we might bring home. Unless you never <br/>
leave home or accept any media etc and also to large degree in <br/>
absence of that type of a lifestyle how children percieve the world <br/>
they increasingly becoming aware of.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598770862">&lt;&lt;&lt;Just wondering: would I be doing my kids a disservice by only exposing <br/>
them to like-minded people? My daughter is so young that it&#39;s not really <br/>

here and at Unschooling Basics and at unschooling.com but I still have <br/>
so many questions.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My feeling is that social events should be enjoyable, and maybe even<br/>
relaxing. As someone undertaking a lifestyle and parenting style that is<br/>
outside of the mainstream, seeking out like-minded people to have most of<br/>
our interactions and fun with, is a good thing. I want Jayn to have fun<br/>
without being hassled to &quot;be careful&quot;, and only slide down the slide, as it<br/>
were. I want us both to be able to be ourselves free of other people&#39;s<br/>
judgmental attitudes whenever possible.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it helps me consolidate my actions by seeing other gentle parents in<br/>
action, and it saves me from having to feel like I have to justify myself or<br/>
my child and just makes everything more relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
Like-minded is a sliding scale also. For practical purposes, there are very<br/>
few almost completely like-minded folk around. We find each other once a<br/>
year at the Live and Learn Conference. The rest of time for us Coburns, it<br/>
is a pleasant compromise with folk who concur for the most part, and these<br/>
points of separation make less difference to Jayn, for her playing, and the<br/>
adults maintain polite toleration of the areas of schism.<br/>
<br/>
The wider society presents plenty of opportunities to see the dominant<br/>
ideology at work, and people who are not like-minded (in the parenting area)<br/>
for comparison. The only way to avoid wider society is to sequester yourself<br/>
in tiny communities, and actively seek to be isolated. I know that some<br/>
people do this. We do not. Our family is out in the wider community, as well<br/>
as seeking out congenial companionship.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-999536816">Thanks, that makes sense. I just felt like unschooling is so great at <br/>
preparing kids for the &quot;real world&quot; in so many ways, I didn&#39;t know if <br/>
maybe it would be a shock at some point for them to realize that &quot;not <br/>
everyone is like us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kind of like it&#39;s a shock for many schooled kids to suddenly be shoved <br/>
out on their own at 18 and expected to cook and clean and balance a <br/>
checkbook when they&#39;ve had everything done for them up to that point.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s natural for me to feel drawn to other parents who are either <br/>
practicing or trying to implement the parenting techniques that I <br/>
believe in but I didn&#39;t know if that was best for DD or not. I guess I <br/>
should just trust my instincts!<br/>
<br/>
I want to be surrounded by people who are non-judgemental too. That <br/>
sounds good! Right now I feel like the only &quot;crunchy&quot; parent in a <br/>
&quot;chewy&quot; world if you know what I mean. People here don&#39;t sling their <br/>
babies or co-sleep etc. and they think I&#39;m weird.<br/>
<br/>
Not that I care what they think, lol. I just think I confuse people <br/>
because they are all the same and I&#39;m the only different one (that I <br/>
know of). Part of it is that I&#39;m just so isolated out here in the <br/>
country. I&#39;ve got to get my license!<br/>

I think it would be great for her development just meeting like-minded people for as long as possible. My 3 turned into nervous wrecks meeting fundie conservative judgemental people for 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
If we had met them from a strong place I doubt it wuld have affected them but we knew no like-minded people and we&#39;d just moved countries so they were rather vunerable. Jayn will get plenty of time when she is a grown up to meet differnt types and by them she will be a strong, loving, forgiving type of person who wont let herself be affected by it.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion. And Heather still asks about Jayn :-)<br/>

close on the sliding scale is pretty small.  I wish there were more!  <br/>
Sometimes we are less social than we&#39;d like because of a lack of like <br/>

I&#39;m probably going to ignore my kids a lot, but they&#39;re big now.  Feel free <br/>
to find them and interrogate them in some subtle fashion if you want to (and if <br/>

was well on my way down the unschooling path, and you go and post this! LOL I <br/>
can see I&#39;m going to need you folks here to keep me on my toes and keep me <br/>
from getting complacent! Thanks!<br/>
