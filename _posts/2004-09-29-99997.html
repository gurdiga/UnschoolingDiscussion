<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302225690">So...<br/>
Teens who aren&#39;t in college aside for a moment, it seems that ever fall here <br/>
and there the idea comes up of whether homeschoolers should have a <br/>
responsibility to represent all homeschoolers in a good light.   I know we&#39;ll never <br/>
decide (among homeschoolers) what that &quot;good light&quot; would be (my kids might &quot;use <br/>
language,&quot; and they watch R rated movies and they&#39;re going to dress up on <br/>
Halloween).    <br/>
<br/>
So let me change gears and say unschoolers instead.   If unschoolers are <br/>
getting together somewhere (park, zoo, community center, museum, hotel) what seems <br/>
reasonable or unreasonable as to expectations?<br/>
<br/>
Is it my child&#39;s responsibility to set a good example?<br/>
Is it my responsibility to live a good unschooling life so that others will <br/>
see unschooling shining in me?  (Yeah, letting the little Baptist kid in my <br/>
shine forth for a second. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; shine forth for a second. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a tough question, because it doesn&#39;t seem fair that we should <br/>
feel obligated to be &quot;unschooling missionaries&quot; just because we&#39;re in <br/>
the minority in our educational philosophy.  But yet we *are* in the <br/>
minority and we *do* care about the philosophy, so I guess yeah, kind <br/>
of.  I don&#39;t think we should break stuff and leave big messes and <br/>
blatantly disregard the rules of the places we go. I don&#39;t think we <br/>
should be rude and disrespectful of others.  But then again we <br/>
shouldn&#39;t do those things anyway even if we don&#39;t care about making <br/>
an impression for unschooling, so maybe my answer is no.  Maybe we <br/>
should just be ourselves and let who we are shine.  If we try to make <br/>
ourselves look more shiny than we really are, then the shine that <br/>
others will see isn&#39;t real.  <br/>
<br/>
And even if we think we&#39;re being a good example, others might not <br/>
think we are.  If we are in Wal-mart with our kids at midnight, are <br/>
people going to talk about &quot;those wild unschoolers who have no <br/>
bedtimes?&quot;  I think at that point, we should not choose to stay home <br/>
at midnight and hide because of what others might think.  <br/>
<br/>
We were at a fair today and one of the stands had decorative water <br/>
fountains for yards.  My 5 year old put his hand in the water while <br/>
we were looking at them and the guy said, &quot;Ooooh, I wouldn&#39;t put my <br/>
fingers in there, the water is all dirty&quot;. Luke immediately took his <br/>
hand out, and a lady the guy was waiting on said looked right at me <br/>
and said, &quot;Some people nowadays just don&#39;t care about their kids&quot;.  <br/>
UGH!  (No, the water wasn&#39;t that dirty and the kids have had their <br/>
hands in worse just playing outside in the yard).  Now that lady <br/>
didn&#39;t know we are unschoolers, but if she had, should I have worried <br/>
that I made a bad impression because I let my 5 year old put his <br/>
fingers in &quot;dirty&quot; water?  No, I don&#39;t think so.  <br/>
<br/>
What if our kids do something unusual ordering from a menu?  Order <br/>
dessert first?  Order something and then barely eat it?  Will people <br/>
look at us and think poorly of us because of that?   I don&#39;t think we <br/>
should care at that point.  <br/>
<br/>
If we take an 8 year old to a museum and the guide realizes he can&#39;t <br/>
read?  <br/>
<br/>
I think worrying about making a good impression would just wear us <br/>
out, and it could be for nothing.  We might see all the joy and peace <br/>
and know that we&#39;re shining but others might just see the non-reader <br/>
and the late bedtime and the fingers in &quot;dirty&quot; water.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-443552308">I&#39;m finding this thread so interesting, as it is making me look at my<br/>
own behavior recently. I can recall 3 different occasions where I told<br/>
Tyler (12--in his/our first month of unschooling) that he needed to<br/>
set a good example. It just came out of my mouth before I even<br/>
realized I was going to say it. My old tapes are really cranking<br/>
because of the challenges of our new journey. I am talking as honestly<br/>
as I can with him about it, but wow, it just keeps coming.<br/>
<br/>
What attracts me to unschooling so much is the space and freedom made<br/>
available for the child to discover his or her truest self--and all of<br/>
the aspects of that self, child, sibling, citizen, relative, karate<br/>
student, writer, illustrator, historian, bug-lover, rabbit-raiser,<br/>
tipi-builder, Yu-gi-oh World Champion (he&#39;s really driving for this<br/>
one!)<br/>
<br/>
etc..<br/>
<br/>
I think we could put the pressure of being *missionaries to the cause*<br/>
on our kids no matter what umbrella we are holding over our heads. I<br/>
am trying to learn how to NOT do that, because what I see as a good<br/>
example often doesn&#39;t fit what is true for my boy in that moment.<br/>
Sometimes he needs to go through facing his wants and what they will<br/>
do in a situation or to a relationship. Isn&#39;t it true that unschooling<br/>
supports the idea of finding ones own creatively suitable place in the<br/>
world? And doesn&#39;t unschooling take a lot of the *shoulds* out of<br/>
life?<br/>
<br/>
Yet, I know that I Should (because it&#39;s true for me) continue to work<br/>
on my old habits and model to Tyler and Lila the freedom I am<br/>
suggesting they should have! Rather than talking it up then stomping<br/>
them down. I know that if I ignore the Should that keeps rising up in<br/>
me, we are all very unhappy, thwarted and resentful.<br/>
<br/>
Ok. I haven&#39;t had my morning coffee yet, and I think I&#39;m not making much sense.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m attempting to say is that I think it&#39;s each<br/>
individual&#39;s responsibility to live their life in as true a fashion as<br/>
they can, learning to look for the highest good, learning to accept<br/>
setbacks gracefully and as teachings instead of as bad things to react<br/>
to. This, whether they are unschoolers or traditional schoolers or<br/>
Christian or Muslim or Jewish. That&#39;s maybe not what a lot of<br/>
organized religions suggest, or what they teach in public school.<br/>
Sure, the language may be there, but the actions and the sometimes<br/>
unspoken expectations driven by rewards and punishments speak so much<br/>
more loudly than the words. But Unschooling. Unschooling has both, the<br/>
words and the action--the legions of families putting it into action<br/>
in their own unique ways. I can only think that has to be good for<br/>
society.<br/>
<br/>
Gah. I still feel like I&#39;m sort of dancing around my point and unable<br/>
to pin it down. I&#39;m going to revisit this later, once the Java God has<br/>
shined down upon my sleep-deprived brain.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023089016">I think we first have to worry about the impression we are making on our <br/>
kids.  Of course.  Then worry about the impression we make on others.<br/>
<br/>
I was just saying the other day that on my very best unschooly mommy days, <br/>
I respond really well to &quot;dirty water&quot; situations.  I turn to my kids and <br/>
firmly and clearly say (for example) &quot;It&#39;s ok, honey.  That water was put <br/>
in there this morning and it&#39;s at least as clean as all the dirt and door <br/>
handles you&#39;ve touched today.  But if you are worried, then when you are <br/>
done playing we can always wash your hands.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Say it so the adult hears how silly they are being without slamming <br/>
them.  Say it so your kid hears you acknowledging the societal norm and <br/>
dismissing it all at once.<br/>
<br/>
My usual one runs something like this:  &quot;YOu can run around in here, but <br/>
please don&#39;t yell, it disturbs other people.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s part of the consideration for me too.  Are we just out in public as <br/>
&quot;private citizens,&quot; and nobody knows we&#39;re homeschoolers or unschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
There are performances for students of some of the shows here in town, and <br/>
sometimes there will be homeschoolers&#39; tickets.   Basically, they&#39;re going as a <br/>
schoolgroup.  A space is saved, we/they file in and sit as a group, and are <br/>
released as a group.  That&#39;s the most public I&#39;ve seen.  Someone up on stage <br/>
excuses different schools in turn so that the kids aren&#39;t all mixed up with other <br/>
groups, because some of the school groups are pretty young, some have busses <br/>
waiting for them, the performance arts building is a big place, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So a group of kids NOT line-trained is released to go in front of many <br/>
hundreds of teachers and schoolkids. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

I believe it&#39;s true, though.  If people know my kids are unschoolers and they <br/>
are too loud, too rude, destructive, the people WILL say &quot;an unschooler did <br/>
this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But if they&#39;re somewhere being a representative of their state, that&#39;s the <br/>
same problem.  Or their anime club, or when Marty was on a hockey team and went <br/>
out of state.<br/>

<br/>
If we take so many shoulds out that our children aren&#39;t living in the world <br/>
or playing well with others, that WILL make unschooling look bad.  (Even to me, <br/>
and I&#39;m pretty sold on it.)<br/>
<br/>
My kids do behave well in public.  But when I describe our lives and other <br/>
people say &quot;I&#39;m going to do that too!&quot; sometimes it seems their results aren&#39;t <br/>
as good (maybe their kids were rule bound for too long, or maybe the parents <br/>
are missing the whole discussion aspect of their lives that we had so solidly <br/>
from the beginning), so not only they might have wild kids out in public that <br/>
they&#39;re not even trying to persuade or corral but they might blame other <br/>
unschoolers for telling them that was good and right.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an easy question.<br/>

That&#39;s what unschooling is about, anyway.  Following our hearts and allowing<br/>

*human beings*...because that&#39;s what they are.<br/>
<br/>
I know schooled children who are so very sweet and thoughtful and <br/>
kind and I know unschooled children who...um...aren&#39;t so much.  To <br/>
represent unschoolers has not been a factor in deciding our behavior <br/>
as much as representing our True Selves as human beings who are aware <br/>
of other people&#39;s needs and desires in life (and at times, *rules* <br/>
[written and/or unwritten] in other places that are different from <br/>
how we would behave in our free home).<br/>

My children have always just been Who They Are...and Jake strives to <br/>
be the best *Jake* he can be, and Sam strives to be the best *Sam* he <br/>
can be.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, unschooling allows them to fulfill their *best* and Shine better <br/>
than other paths...but it&#39;s just a factor in Who They Are...<br/>
<br/>
When they are older and no longer *school age* they will be <br/>
accountable as human beings...if they determine their behavior and <br/>
base their decisions now on the fact that they represent unschoolers, <br/>
then what will be the deciding factor when they are no longer <br/>
(officially) unschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s their Human Spirit that determines Who They Are and What They <br/>
Do...being unschoolers is the most glorious *aid* and *benefit* to <br/>
that human spirit, but certainly not their entire Spirit.<br/>

<br/>
Good point.<br/>
<br/>
We hardly do anything with groups anymore anyway, and in their everyday <br/>
actions my kids are rarely representing anyone but themselves (or SCA kids, or <br/>
gamers) and they do it pretty well.  But it&#39;s not because they&#39;re trying to be <br/>
good gamers, it&#39;s because Kirby is a helpful, sociable guy.  And Marty is a <br/>
reliable, funny, honest guy.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s only in cases where kids&#39; behavior isn&#39;t ideal that others would <br/>
say &quot;you&#39;re representing unschoolers now, so settle down&quot;??<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s their Human Spirit that determines Who They Are and What They <br/>
<br/>
Do...being unschoolers is the most glorious *aid* and *benefit* to <br/>
<br/>
that human spirit, but certainly not their entire Spirit.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Makes a ton of sense.<br/>

asked to line up. It is sometimes VERY funny to watch them mill around <br/>
- usually their intense conversations don&#39;t stop, so they&#39;re trying to <br/>
follow instructions, but not with their &quot;whole&quot; brains. And they just <br/>
can&#39;t DO it without working consciously at it! And their idea of a <br/>
&quot;line&quot; is very funny, too.<br/>
<br/>
One time we went on a candy factory tour. They wanted the kids to put <br/>
on these little white paper hats. So the lined up the kids against a <br/>
wall, told them in no uncertain terms to get those hats on and KEEP <br/>
them on. The kids did it. But there was a delay while we waited to go <br/>
inside and when the tour guide turned back a few minutes later, the <br/>
kids had twisted and warped those little white hats into all sorts of <br/>
odd shapes. They looked interesting, to say the least. She kept saying, <br/>
&quot;Well I guess that&#39;s okay,&quot; doubtfully, like she was trying to convince <br/>
herself &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

figured out for themselves that people look at them and are curious <br/>
about them. Even at our park days, they are somewhat aware that the <br/>
parents of younger children are interested in them as &quot;examples&quot; of <br/>
older unschoolers (my oldest is almost 20 - NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!).<br/>
<br/>
But I do gently joke with them occasionally about not &quot;scaring&quot; the <br/>
parents of the young children. My kids will tend to say just about <br/>
anything. Sometimes it seems like they&#39;ll say THE thing most likely to <br/>
shake the brains of moms of younger children, who don&#39;t have teens yet, <br/>
and still think that homeschooling is some sort of guarantee of perfect <br/>
children who never face &quot;teen issues,&quot; etc.<br/>

Anyone here know the term &quot;PK&quot;?<br/>
It doesn&#39;t completely apply, but sometimes it does.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Preacher&#39;s Kid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If someone is a speaker or a conference organizer or publisher or in any <br/>
other prominent position, their kids become part of the package, whether anyone <br/>
involved likes it or agrees to it or not.<br/>
<br/>
When Baptists talk (probably methodists and others of that ilk) and someone <br/>
says &quot;I was a PK&quot; or &quot;He was a wild PK&quot; it has meaning in that context.  Wild <br/>
PKs are nasty boys or sneaky girls who rebelled against the special <br/>
expectations put on them because their dads were ministers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen an unschooler rebel that way.  I wonder. . .<br/>
<br/>
There used to be someone who came on AOL from time to time and said he had <br/>
been unschooled and it was TERRIBLE and no one should do it to their kids.  It <br/>
was hard to tell (impossible to tell) if he was telling any truth whatsoever, <br/>
and IF he was unschooled what his parents were planning and thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just rambling now, but the ramble is still in the vague area of whether <br/>
it matters.<br/>
<br/>
Our family is going to southern California in early December.  We&#39;ll stay <br/>
with an unschooling family in Las Vegas on the way.  Holly and I stayed there in <br/>
June.  But this time the family will meet Keith, and Kirby, and Marty.  And <br/>
they WILL jld look at them to see how unschoolers could be, and would ask them <br/>
questions expecting them to say something clever about unschooling.  Pressure&#39;s <br/>
been off somewhat since we stopped organizing meetings a few years back.  <br/>
Holly goes to park days sometimes.  Some families there are unschoolers and some <br/>
aren&#39;t, and she knows she has been used as a good example by some families <br/>
behind her back, and as a bad example by some.  There&#39;s no getting around that, <br/>
really.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Marty hang out with a lot of school-attending gamers, and some who <br/>
don&#39;t go to school.   I don&#39;t think they&#39;re self conscious about it at all, <br/>
but they ARE representing homeschooling there in that group whether they mean to <br/>
or not.<br/>

 If unschoolers are <br/>
&gt; getting together somewhere (park, zoo, community center, museum,<br/>
hotel) what seems <br/>
&gt; reasonable or unreasonable as to expectations?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is it my child&#39;s responsibility to set a good example?<br/>
&gt; Is it my responsibility to live a good unschooling life so that<br/>
others will <br/>
&gt; see unschooling shining in me?  (Yeah, letting the little Baptist<br/>
kid in my <br/>
&gt; shine forth for a second. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I sent my kid to school because of the extremely negative experiences<br/>
I had with the unschoolers in my area. This was after six years of<br/>
being a total unschooling groupie, John Holt fanatic, being positive I<br/>
would NEVER sent my kid to school.<br/>
<br/>
But when I got acquainted with actual unschoolers . . . well, let&#39;s<br/>
just say that the ones in my area, those I know, anyway, are nothing<br/>
like the ones on this list. They seem to be unschooling more for<br/>
political/social reasons than as a way to get close to or nurture<br/>
their kids. They are very controlling about TV, computers, food, guns,<br/>
etc. They talk very stridently about how terrible the larger culture<br/>
is and how they are protecting their kids by not sending them to<br/>
school . . . a lot, imho, like fundie school-at-homers do. A lot of<br/>
the kids seem to be genuinely neglected by parents who are more or<br/>
less just doing their thing (raising goats or protesting wars, not<br/>
that there&#39;s anything inherently wrong with either of those<br/>
activities) and expecting the kids to join in and making them feel<br/>
guilty if they&#39;d rather be playing video games with their friends or<br/>
something. Some of the kids have asked repeatedly to go to school and<br/>
their parents guilt trip them over that too but make no attempt to<br/>
make their lives at home more pleasant -- sometimes they live way out<br/>
in the country, nowhere near friends, and really are suffering from<br/>
lack of social contact. A lot of the kids are HORRIBLY behaved, not<br/>
just &quot;free spirits&quot; but rude, destructive, violent -- basically, imo,<br/>
expressing a deep-seated discomfort and unhappiness with their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the school-at-homers were even worse than the unschoolers.<br/>
When I looked around to see who did have the best relationship with<br/>
their kids, which kids seemed happiest and nicest and most comfortable<br/>
with their lives, which parents seemed most in tune with their kids<br/>
and most concerned to do what actually made them happy, it was the<br/>
&quot;relaxed&quot; or &quot;eclectic&quot; homeschoolers -- and the attached-parenting<br/>
people who sent their kids to school. Most of the relaxed<br/>
homeschoolers had sent their kids to school originally and had brought<br/>
them home when they were unhappy and were spending a lot of their time<br/>
thinking up fun stuff for them to do, not pressuring them to do what<br/>
they didn&#39;t want, having academic goals in mind but accomplishing them<br/>
in the most gentle, family-friendly way possible. The parents whose<br/>
kids were still in school had kids who just liked school, adjusted to<br/>
it well, and were perfectly happy, so they saw no reason to bring them<br/>
home. I&#39;m talking about a select group of school parents here, of<br/>
course. They weren&#39;t obsessed with grades or achievement, parented<br/>
gently and did lots of family stuff outside of school, intervened with<br/>
the school when there were problems. <br/>
<br/>
So I took a deep breath and sent my son to school. He loved it. The<br/>
kids in his class were great. He made tons of friends. His teacher was<br/>
gentle and creative and they did all kinds of fun stuff. I had no regrets.<br/>
<br/>
Two years later, things weren&#39;t going so well . . . I had to pull him.<br/>
I tried some relaxed-homeschooly stuff but he was very resistant. I<br/>
decided to check out unschooling again and found this list . . . I am<br/>
so glad I did. It finally got through to me that I can parent the way<br/>
I want -- very attuned -- and unschool. I honestly had never seen that<br/>
combination before. I wish I&#39;d been confident enough to make it up for<br/>
myself &lt;g&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
Now I feel like I should look around my area again for some<br/>
unschoolers who are more on my wavelength -- maybe I just fell in with<br/>
the wrong group before? Everyone else here seems to rave about how<br/>
much more comfortable they are with unschoolers than with even the<br/>
most liberal school parents and that just hasn&#39;t been my experience --<br/>
I tend to be seen as a pariah by the unschoolers around here because I<br/>
have cable TV and plastic toys! Has anyone else had this experience?<br/>

&quot;new-ager-than-thou&quot; for me!!<br/>
<br/>
And some of those beliefs seem even more unfounded than Bible literalism is.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I just posted at unschooling.com that touches on why I <br/>
unschool:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By Sandra Dodd (Sandradodd) on Thursday, September 30, 2004 - 04:12 pm: <br/>
-=-I have read some books discussing the ways TV alters brain <br/>
waves. Has anyone else read &quot;The Plug In Drug&quot;? <br/>
-=- <br/>
<br/>
I read it and thought it was nonsense, honestly. <br/>
<br/>
If flicker effect and radiation and passivity are serious dangers, jump up <br/>
and run away from this computer you&#39;re looking at! Kids don&#39;t sit this close to <br/>
the TV or stare so closely. <br/>
<br/>
When automobiles were first invented there was professional opinion that <br/>
humans couldn&#39;t survive going that fast. Pressure on their faces or some such. <br/>
Gosh, they were wrong. And automobiles, trains and planes are necessary for <br/>
getting around the world unless one wants to have a horse or bicycle and never <br/>
leave the neighborhood. <br/>
<br/>
My children will be in a world with video after I&#39;m dead, and I can&#39;t change <br/>
the world. That iS part of our world, and living artificially separate from th<br/>
e culture and from technology might be the reason some people homeschool, but <br/>
I WANT my children to live in the world as whole people, not protected or <br/>
stunted people. <br/>
<br/>
If a child didn&#39;t have books at home he might be seriously fascinated by them <br/>
elsewhere. If a child never heard music and heard it elsewhere, it might be <br/>
seriously more interesting than his mom while he was first listening. The <br/>
answer wouldn&#39;t be to stop taking him where books or music were. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra <br/>
===============================<br/>
The last was in reference to someone&#39;s evidence that TV was bad for her child <br/>
because he (who didn&#39;t have TV at home) would become mesmerized when he was <br/>
where a TV was.   <br/>
I think that just shows he was interested in it and thought it was wonderful. <br/>
 I&#39;ve been mesmerized by things.  Last week it was the instruction manual for <br/>
my new rice machine.  When I started reading it, my husband was telling my <br/>
daughter stories I had already heard, and I tuned them out.  In a bit I heard, <br/>
&quot;She&#39;s not even listening to us.&quot;   No, I wasn&#39;t.  Not at all.  I really cared <br/>
about those instructions and pointers and at that moment if they wanted my <br/>
attention, they should have said my name (which they didn&#39;t) and waited until I <br/>
was looking at them.<br/>
Does that mean rice cookers are bad for me?  Does it mean I have ADHD?<br/>
(I don&#39;t think so.)<br/>

I was talking to Kirby in the car one day about a high-schooled friend of his <br/>
who is quite posturish and trendy and dramatic.  I said, &quot;Eric is just so <br/>
&#39;gother-than-thou.&#39;&quot;<br/>

Kirby said there was a card game called &quot;Gother than Thou,&quot; which I thought <br/>

<br/>
Yes, I find that there are those that are unschoolers in the sense that they don&#39;t use a curriculum, but are not in the sense of what is discussed here.  They have lots of food restrictions, limited media exposure (disney is evil tv is evil, coorporate monsters that will make your child materialistic, unimaginative and violent) and rots your brain, waldorfy toys, no plastic toys, earthy crunchy sorts that we have more in common with than mainstream folks, but still different.   Organic foods only, no sugar or hydrogenated whatever.  (don&#39;t eat the baked goods).  Just kidding, some is fine.  But, very restrictive in my opinion.  Probably the same as you experienced.  Kind of waldorfish.  Their kids knit which is neat.  We go to a science class in the park that has a great mix.  The class is this guy that brings neat animals and talks to the kids about nature.  <br/>
Mostly, earthy crunchy attachment parenting types.  So, for the most part we fit in great.  But, I do feel a little judged when I bring a pepsi or fast food for lunch.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214312849">I get a lot of new folks who are so afraid of unschooling because their knowledge of it came from a homeschooling friend who was not an unschooler, easy going moms afraid that if they get Johnny a science kit that they are not unschooling.  What a waste.  In time, many of them realize this is ridiculous and climb aboard the unschooling boat.  The power of face to face interactions between unschooling families cannot be understated.<br/>

Yes, I find that there are those that are unschoolers in the sense that they <br/>
don&#39;t use a curriculum, but are not in the sense of what is discussed here. <br/>

Well then, they&#39;re unschoolers in the only way most people think counts.<br/>
They are homeschoolers who don&#39;t use a curriculum.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-926547717">*** And doesn&#39;t unschooling take a lot of the *shoulds* out of life?****<br/>
<br/>
I realized a couple of months ago that if I think to myself &quot;I should do<br/>
this today...&quot; It becomes so much harder for me to do it. Saying I should<br/>
makes it an once a &#39;have to&#39; and a chore and a part of me resists it. So now<br/>
I make a list of &#39;coulds&#39; every few days. A list of possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
I could help the kids to make a kite.<br/>
I could give each child a big smile and a hug when they wake up.<br/>
I could do the dishes and clean the bathroom.<br/>
I could see if the kids want to play Monopoly.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly my whole perspective changes and life becomes a place of &#39;all that<br/>
I can do to make that place better for me and my family.<br/>
<br/>
Choice. Seeing that every day is full of it. It&#39;s empowering. I posted the<br/>
affirmation &#39;I choose this moment to be patient with others&#39; above my<br/>
workbench in the kitchen and it is a wonderful reminder that life isn&#39;t to<br/>
be lived with a sense of obligation, the killer of all things joyful and<br/>
spontaneous.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882597299">I think my favorite part of any ren faire I&#39;ve ever been to is the <br/>
last chance forever birds of prey show at Scarborough faire in Texas. <br/>
Last Chance Forever is a rehabilitation group for birds of prey and <br/>
other raptors like buzzards that is based in San ANtonio. They never <br/>
have the same birds two years in a row because they &quot;train&quot; them so <br/>
they can do things they need to do in the wild and then they release <br/>
them.<br/>
 They do a few shows around the country every year, and those shows <br/>
are how they make most of their money for their organization. The <br/>
show is quite impressive, and very educational.I certianly learned <br/>
more than I knew there was to learn about the birds that day I was <br/>
there. And how many chances to you get to see a golden eagle up close <br/>
enough to touch? (Not that it would be a good idea to try to touch <br/>
them. LOL)<br/>

I got blasted on an unschooling list once because my daughter(3 yo) <br/>
likes worksheets. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m sitting there making her do them, <br/>
she asks me to buy them. She thinks they are fun. My son (6)wouldn&#39;t <br/>
volunteer to do one unless he was really, really, really bored, but <br/>
my daughter just adores them. She doesn&#39;t always do them the way the <br/>
instructions say they should be done, but that&#39;s okay, she&#39;s just <br/>
doing things her way, having fun and happens to learn some sounds of <br/>
letters along the way. Sometimes she&#39;ll ask me to read the pages with <br/>
her, and we do, but most of the time, she&#39;ll pick one and do it her <br/>
way. :) I think we are still unschooling. But because I&#39;ve bought <br/>
worksheets, there are people who would say we aren&#39;t.<br/>
