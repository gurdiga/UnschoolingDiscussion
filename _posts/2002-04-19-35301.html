<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254177222">&lt;&lt;Will your children be able to pass college entrance exams when they are<br/>
that<br/>
age?   I am wondering because since I joined this list I have heard very<br/>
very little conversation pertaining to academics, though I have asked<br/>
more<br/>
than once.  Math, Science, History, etc.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think this requires a different view of tests and learning.  My<br/>
daughter sees a test as a hoop for jumping through to a desired activity.<br/>
 I don&#39;t care if they choose to acquire a degree for their life&#39;s<br/>
occupation or not.  If they do, however, they can memorize what they need<br/>
to pass any test.<br/>
<br/>
The public school system made sure I graduated in spite of my failure to<br/>
do the work.  When I decided to attend college a few years later I also<br/>
chose to take basic math and english classes.  The counselor thought I<br/>
was nuts since I wasn&#39;t required to do so but I knew I was lacking .  In<br/>
one semester&#39;s time I was up to speed and better.<br/>
