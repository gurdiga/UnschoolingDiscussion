&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Thank You All!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I just wanted to thank everyone for their answers to all of my posts.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; believe that unschooling is the best way to live.  I&#39;ve been changing<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; relate to my children, not that I was a mean and nasty mom, but I talk<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; them in a way that makes them on my level, and not treated like the<br/>
child.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My children are very close in age (13 months apart), and are very close<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; each other.  I&#39;ve seen how they treated each other in the past, which<br/>
&gt; mimiced<br/>
&gt; &gt; how I treated them, and I didn&#39;t like it.  My children need to show lots<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; love and respect for each other and they can learn that from me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever introduced myself.  I just started butting in on<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; converstations.  My name is Patti.  I have a girl named Natalie and a<br/>
boy<br/>
&gt; &gt; named Nicholas.  I decided when my daughter was about 2 that I was going<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; homeschool my children.  My husband immediately loved the idea.  I<br/>
started<br/>
&gt; &gt; reading a lot about homeschooling and went to my first conference last<br/>
&gt; &gt; summer.  I knew I wasn&#39;t going to be a &quot;traditional&quot; homeschooler<br/>
because<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; main reason why I wanted to homeschool was, and is, because children<br/>
learn<br/>
&gt; &gt; best if they direct their own learning.  The thought of using<br/>
curriculums,<br/>
&gt; &gt; tests, worksheets, etc. and have a set schedule to have my children<br/>
learn<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; never going to be an option, unless my children love that way of<br/>
learning.<br/>
&gt; &gt; When deciding to homeschool, I realized that I was going to have to let<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; things go in order for the family to love each other, respect each<br/>
other,<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt; a long, and live together.  I&#39;ve never been one who dictated what my<br/>
&gt; children<br/>
&gt; &gt; can and cannot do in regards to playing.  I&#39;m used to the HUGE messes<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; most of the time it doesn&#39;t bother me.  When I started reading about<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling, it made me want to learn more about it and talk to families<br/>
&gt; who<br/>
&gt; &gt; live this way.  I liked what I heard and decided I want to be an<br/>
&gt; unschooler.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This board has explained it, and has taught me a lot about families and<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; they should be.  I&#39;ve already noticed a change in how we relate to each<br/>
&gt; &gt; other, although it&#39;s more difficult to help my daughter and son relate<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; each other in a respectful manner because they get so mad at each other.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think in time they&#39;ll learn to communicate with each other without<br/>
&gt; yelling,<br/>
&gt; &gt; taking things away from each other, and hitting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks again for all your help!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Patti<br/>

&gt; apart. He was 2 mths premie. I am intrested in unschooling and looking for<br/>
&gt; more info. She is very bright. Hiding things she doesn&#39;t want me to take<br/>
&gt; away or books that need to be returned to the Library. She knows her<br/>
&gt; alphabet and counts to ten. knows shapes and colors. 1+1=2. She tries to<br/>
&gt; hide what she knows from me. ? is this normal!! One for u one for me is 2.<br/>
&gt; (oops) She is telling me the shapes of things. Cant keep her occupied.<br/>
&gt;  Her brother and her get along great. She is encouraging him to talk and<br/>
&gt; walk but the fight only for my attention. Any advice on how to stop this?<br/>
&gt; What can I do to occupie them ?<br/>
&gt; What advice can you give me on raising children so close in age. How do I<br/>
&gt; make her feel like a big girl?<br/>

&gt; Thank u for ur reply! Jolene is 2 1/2 and Eddie is 23 mths. 14 mths apart<br/>
! Eddie to mths premie wouldnt know it now though. Big for his age! Little<br/>
slow at walking but talkin up a storm. Starting use sentences  of 5 wrds<br/>
already.Has very fine motor skills and is very textile.<br/>
<br/>
My attitude has changed a bit too. I am starting to enjoy them a bit more<br/>
now reading stories and a lot of art they both love finger paint and art<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if there was an age you started at or was it more of gradual<br/>
thing? Go on what they want? I am thinkin the less structure and the more<br/>
fun you can make learning the better. Maybe a little more structure when the<br/>
reach 6 or 7. Am I on the right track. </span></blockquote></div>

<br/>
Don&#39;t even worry about it... Kids  ( and adults) don&#39;t necessarily like presure ( implied or not) - pressure to show what they do or do not know....My kids know about lots of things, I am sure, of which I am not aware...  - every now and then something comes up and I see they can help someone else with an answer. I guess I am not thinking about how much they do or don&#39;t know - just am spending time with them and trusting that they learn and grow...Leonie W. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473186486">(BTW, it would help *muchly* for people read your posts if you don&#39;t quote<br/>
the whole post. Just highlight a sentence or two that you want to respond to<br/>
and click reply. And, if your mail program doesn&#39;t put a carriage return,<br/>
make sure you hit the carriage return so the first line of your response<br/>
doesn&#39;t look like part of the quote.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it helps a lot to try to see what the world looks like through their<br/>
eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was wondering if there was an age you started at or was it more of gradual<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If they are following their interests, we don&#39;t need to &quot;make&quot; learning fun.<br/>
It already is. Think about the things you enjoy most. Does anyone need to<br/>
come in and make it fun for you in order for you to learn about them?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe a little more structure when the reach 6 or 7. Am I on the right track.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends what your goals are. If you want them to acquire a standard body of<br/>
knowledge then that way might work. But we can&#39;t help you with that since it<br/>
isn&#39;t the goal of the people wanting unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If you want them to learn from life then imposing structure will interfere.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you start? How do you find what there intrests are?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By listening to them. By not filtering what they are interested in through<br/>
schoolish eyes. For instance, a beloved cartoon is just as valuable *to the<br/>
child* as an interest that resembles something taught in school. It&#39;s we<br/>
adults who tend to focus on the interests society says are important. To<br/>
nurture who the child is and who she is growing into, we need to honor what<br/>
interests *her*, not what she&#39;s &quot;supposed&quot; to be interested in or what it&#39;s<br/>
&quot;good&quot; to be interested in.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I keep<br/>
&gt; gathering books on things my daughter is intrested, puzzles, and art<br/>
&gt; supplies. She is 2 and will be 3 in may. She counts to ten, abc&#39;s, shapes<br/>
&gt; colors, loves art airplanes and vehicle bugs, all the normal things. Lately<br/>
&gt; though she wants plants and things instead of toys. I find this a little<br/>
&gt; strange. However I did buy the plant! Flowers are great and she helps water<br/>
&gt; the plants now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*Don&#39;t* think it&#39;s strange. Think it&#39;s uniquely her! :-) Would you prefer<br/>
your child to be &quot;normal,&quot; that is like some cookie-cutter standard?<br/>
<br/>
*Celebrate* the things she enjoys. See the world through her eyes. Why<br/>
*should* a child be more interested in ABC&#39;s than plants?<br/>
<br/>
But at 2 I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about what her interests are. Certainly<br/>
buy her plants and point out VW Bugs and whatever she enjoys, but don&#39;t<br/>
worry that you need to feed her interests right. She doesn&#39;t have the<br/>
capacity to &quot;learn&quot; as we think of older kids learning. It&#39;s more<br/>
experiential and just absorbing things. (I know my daughter absorbed stuff<br/>
about dinosaurs spongelike starting at about 18 mos.)<br/>
<br/>
What they *need* at 2 is you. They need to know they are loved and that you<br/>
love spending time with them. Their interests, really, are a distant second<br/>
to that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So just let her pretend she doesnt know at wait for her to slip<br/>
&gt; and show me she does?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not totally sure what you&#39;re asking, but I&#39;ll go on a guess.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you need feedback on what she knows? I&#39;m not asking that to be<br/>
snarky. It&#39;s something to think about. What motivates you to need to know?<br/>
How do you feel when you don&#39;t know?<br/>
<br/>
What kind of things are you thinking you need to pretend she doesn&#39;t know?<br/>
What will you do if she &quot;slips&quot; and reveals that she does know something?<br/>
<br/>
(I think I need specific examples.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids will let you know if they need/want structure to learn any <br/>
specific thing, and you can give them any assistance they ask for in <br/>
finding that structure. My son is very interested in <br/>
engineering/architecture/creating and building thing, his uncle is a <br/>
great mentor for him since he was also that way as a child and now is <br/>
a civil engineer. They have lots of long discussions about this sort <br/>
of thing. Kids can be very good at finding mentors for subjects <br/>
they&#39;re interested in, however it is the rare adult who will take the <br/>
time to talk seriously to a child of 6. I&#39;m glad that my BIL is one <br/>
of those people. My son often talks about the things he wants to <br/>
learn so that he can get to the place where he can design complex <br/>
structures. He&#39;s very interested in creating Rube Goldberg-like <br/>
contraptions, building things with real tools, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, my son often asks me to buy him workbooks, like those <br/>
math ones they sell at the drugstore. He will work through them for a <br/>
week or two, then not pick them up for weeks, then do some more work <br/>
in them. I&#39;ve noticed that he goes back and self-corrects his old <br/>
work when he&#39;s advanced to the point that he can see his mistakes. <br/>
That&#39;s interesting to me since I&#39;ve never corrected his work, and <br/>
he&#39;s never seen work corrected or graded in any way. He just does <br/>
that himself because he wants to know whether things are right. He <br/>
also asked for a set of cuisinaire rods (little wood or plastic rods <br/>
of different lengths that you can use for comparitive math), but <br/>
mostly he uses them to build towers. That&#39;s fine. These are some ways <br/>
that he has sought out structure in his learning. In other areas he <br/>
doesn&#39;t look for structure, but in some ways he does.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling to me just means giving my assistance when my kids ask me <br/>
for it. If they ask me to buy a workbook or sign them up for piano <br/>
lessons, I&#39;ll do so. If they don&#39;t, I don&#39;t. I&#39;ll tell them about <br/>
things that are out there that they might be interested in. I drive <br/>
them to places like the library or homeschool group activities or <br/>
field trips if they want to go to them. We read through the weekly <br/>
calendar for our town and circle things we want to do. I&#39;m basically <br/>
the driver and helper, and of course I follow my own interests as <br/>
well. <br/>
<br/>
Structure may come, but it&#39;s not imposed from me.<br/>

&gt; that himself because he wants to know whether things are right. He<br/>
&gt; also asked for a set of cuisinaire rods (little wood or plastic rods<br/>
&gt; of different lengths that you can use for comparitive math), but<br/>
&gt; mostly he uses them to build towers. That&#39;s fine. These are some ways<br/>
&gt; that he has sought out structure in his learning. In other areas he<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t look for structure, but in some ways he does.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unschooling to me just means giving my assistance when my kids ask me<br/>
&gt; for it. If they ask me to buy a workbook or sign them up for piano<br/>
&gt; lessons, I&#39;ll do so. If they don&#39;t, I don&#39;t. I&#39;ll tell them about<br/>
&gt; things that are out there that they might be interested in. I drive<br/>
&gt; them to places like the library or homeschool group activities or<br/>
&gt; field trips if they want to go to them. We read through the weekly<br/>
&gt; calendar for our town and circle things we want to do. I&#39;m basically<br/>
&gt; the driver and helper, and of course I follow my own interests as<br/>
&gt; well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Structure may come, but it&#39;s not imposed from me.<br/>
