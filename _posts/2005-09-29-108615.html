I&#39;ll have some at the Live and Learn conference, but for those not attending <br/>
they&#39;re available for sale.   After I&#39;m home I&#39;ll probably buy some to send <br/>
from here, partly because I can mail them out more quickly than lulu.com.   But <br/>
for now, that&#39;s the source.   I&#39;ll update that page if anything changes about <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s filled with filler. &lt;g&gt;   Photos of my kids, mostly.   It turns out that <br/>
the amount of writing that fills one magazine page fills two and a half or <br/>
three pages of this book&#39;s format.   That leaves a page or more lying there <br/>
white, so I ended up stuffing it with imagery of one kind and another.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you who&#39;ve encouraged me and shared with me over the years, <br/>
helping convince me my family wasn&#39;t a lucky fluke, that others really COULD <br/>
do this too!!<br/>

them.   If there are any left, I&#39;ll bring them home. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
