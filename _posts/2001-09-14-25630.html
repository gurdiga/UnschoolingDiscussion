<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215551209">&lt;&lt; &gt; Yeah, they would. Most of our forefathers weren&#39;t Christians... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe &quot;not Christian&quot; by born-again current stats, but some of the <br/>
denominations now in the business of saying who&#39;s not Christian (and they <br/>
often start with Catholics on the &quot;not Christian&quot; list) weren&#39;t even in <br/>
existence when many of the religious-freedom-seeking Europeans came here in <br/>
colonial days.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad Johanna has these stats, because I was thinking it was <br/>
all-but-a-few-WERE too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My understanding is that of the signers of the<br/>
Declaration of Independence, out of 55 men, more than 40 were members of<br/>
their church, declared to be Christian, a few attended church regularly but<br/>
had not declared membership and only 3 or 4 were not Christian.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But what Rachel literally said was &quot;forefathers.&quot;  If we go back far enough, <br/>
NOBODy was Christian, so I&#39;m going to assume she meant of the United States.<br/>
