&lt;&lt; Doesn&#39;t AOL still have the homeschooling forum? Just <br/>
curious as to why the word old is stuck in there.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is barely any unschooling discussion left at all.<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time, eight years ago, and some on either side, there was a <br/>
hugely thriving unschooling forum there, with live chats at least once a <br/>
week, sometimes two times or three; with informal chat rooms operating day <br/>
and night; a library which at the time was about the best thing available <br/>
anywhere; a newsletter (not just on unschooling, but on the whole <br/>
homeschooling forum.  <br/>
<br/>
The closest thing to match it since is www.unschooling.com but while it&#39;s <br/>
strong and helpful it doesn&#39;t have something.  There was an electrical <br/>
sparkle and a vibrancy.  It wasn&#39;t clinical, it was alive and roiling.<br/>
<br/>
Now there&#39;s a polite but just about useless tiny vestige of some unschooling <br/>
discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Also, separate from that, Home Education Magazine had their forum on AOL.  So <br/>
did Practical Homeschooling, and some other more conservative groups.  It was <br/>
a mall, a convention, a fast-speed lifeline.  The unschooling discussions <br/>
were a ladder to and a chute away from school or structured unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of the edited chats are still in the library there.  Their &quot;unschooling <br/>
library&quot; (not nearly as vital as it was those years ago, thanks to internet <br/>
advances!) is all from those days, but much smaller than it used to be.<br/>

It seems like it has been forever since something new has been there. <br/>

<br/>
Lovely weather, and large!<br/>
<br/>
Did I tell you about the time...<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  Here, read this:<br/>
[but first I must say that Marty and Kirby AND Holly are out right at this <br/>
moment, still, with Carol&#39;s kids (named below from the time Marty was just <br/>
turning two) because it is the 18th birthday of the twins who are in the <br/>
middle of that unschooling-always family]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
January 23, 1991<br/>
Marty’s speech is really coming on.  He says “K.O.” for okay, and this <br/>
morning he said (not clearly, but certainly) “soda” and then “coke (toke)”, <br/>
“I hungry,”  “food” and yesterday he pointed at the picture on some <br/>
shredded wheat and said “trix.”   He’s turned down nursing in favor of other <br/>
drinks lately, and that’s great.  He has some cute own-words, notably <br/>
“ching-ching” for a sword.<br/>
<br/>
January 30, Carol’s kids came over and as each took a coat off, Marty would <br/>
take the coat and put in on the floor in the hall and go back for another <br/>
one.  When they’d hand him the coat he’s say “tant too” (thank you) on his <br/>
way to deposit it.  Chris didn’t take his own coat off, and so Marty started <br/>
trying to take it off him.  When it was off, Marty took it, put in on the <br/>
pile, and came back, brushing his hands together like the job was all done.<br/>
<br/>
February 2   When Kirby was at Michael’s spending the night, Marty went with <br/>
us to Lance’s to a Rocky Horror party.  He slept through most of the first <br/>
showing but was wide awake for the second one.  We took turns dancing with <br/>
him and distracting him, and during the axe scene I tried to turn him away <br/>
and cover him up in a funny way, but he twisted around with all his might and <br/>
held my hand away and watched.  It was kind of funny, how determined he was <br/>
to see it.  He thought the songs were good.<br/>
<br/>
Feb 3, Keith offered to keep Tyler while Karen went to a movie with Mark.  <br/>
Marty was kind of jealous, but not nearly as bad as Kirby used to be.  Keith <br/>
took Marty and Tyler for a mile-long stroller walk.  Earlier that morning <br/>
Marty had said “I need Jacket” while he was trying to go out into the back <br/>
yard.  He needed more than that, because he was still in his pajamas, but it <br/>
was cute, and clear.<br/>
<br/>
Feb 10, Marty was sick and saying “ow” and  when I said what hurts he was <br/>
saying “chin, chin,” and pointed to his throat.<br/>
<br/>
For a while now he’s had a good concept--HOLE.  A scabbard is a hole, a <br/>
holster is a hole, the box something goes in is its hole.  “Hole hole hole” <br/>
means to put something where it goes.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
<br/>
So now Marty is 13.  Makes his own decisions a lot of the time.  Decided to <br/>
go see &quot;Signs,&quot; and then decided to wake me up at 4:00 a.m. to sleep with me.<br/>
<br/>
And after a full day of meet at library in neighboring town, go see Julie <br/>
(Carol&#39;s youngest) in dance recital in OTHER town, watch a video, meet back <br/>
in Albuquerque for dinner at a restaurant (this all a batch of ten teens or <br/>
so, all but one homeschooled), Holly wanted to go with them to the dinner, <br/>
and they agreed.  Not enough seat belts on the way there, though, though she <br/>
could get a ride back.  I asked Keith/dh if he wanted to go there, buy me a <br/>
drink, hang out, and we could bring Holly back... if the boys didn&#39;t mind.  <br/>
Marty said &quot;I don&#39;t mind you being there, I just don&#39;t think it would be cool <br/>
if you came over to the table to tell me and Kirby to stop doing something we <br/>
were doing or to tell us how to act.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
OH HUH!  Like I would do that...<br/>
Well...  <br/>
So we didn&#39;t go, I just drove Holly there and let her out with her brothers <br/>
who had ridden in an all-full car.   And that was three and a half hours ago. <br/>
 I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fine.  There are two cellphones in the group, and three <br/>
local houses where they could be, and a cheap video arcade near there, and <br/>
the birthday celebration isn&#39;t over.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, long day.  I should go to sleep now!  Good night!<br/>
<br/>
