<div id="ygrps-yiv-469471580">My Ds 12 yp has been in scouts since age 6, he was to go to camp today<br/>
and last night well packing he confided to me he was unsure if he<br/>
really wanted to go due to much harrassment and teasing. He is a big<br/>
guy and very sensitive to other peoples feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow I e-mailed one of the leaders and she has pleaded with me to<br/>
have a sitdown meeting with my son and the other leaders. They wantmy<br/>
son to stay on due to his genourosity and kindnes towards the younger<br/>
scouts. I know my son if I mention this to him he will want to do it<br/>
merely to make the leaders happy.<br/>
<br/>
I feel this will lead to more teasing and harrassment. She is sure it<br/>
will not.<br/>
<br/>
The leaders are good people, and i am too familiar with the &quot;boys will<br/>
be boys attitude. <br/>
<br/>
What is all of your opinions? Should I suggest he should give it<br/>
another try or tell him to throw in the towel?  (I&#39;m asking this<br/>
because he is totally on the fence and so much like his mother who<br/>
doesn&#39;t often make up her mind  easily alone)<br/>
<br/>
This totally rips at my heart and I have relatives tell me I cannot<br/>
protect him from everything forever Well I feel I can try as long as I<br/>
am still breathing!! They tell me i&#39;m making him weak oh how I hate<br/>
this crap Would totally appreciate any advice from anyone who has been<br/>
through this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take care<br/>

It would be empowering for him to experience that if he doesn&#39;t like a <br/>
situation that he has more options than to put up with it or quit. That <br/>
he can speak up and try to get things changed.<br/>
<br/>
Will their focus be on solving *their* problem, the problem of keeping <br/>
your son so he can benefit the troop? Or do they acknowledge that the <br/>
harassment is a problem? And what are they planning to do about it? Are <br/>
there programs for scout leaders that address  that? It&#39;s real easy to <br/>
say &quot;stop teasing&quot; and think that&#39;s enough but then the teasers just <br/>
get more subtle. :-/<br/>

<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
They&#39;re teasing HIM?  Or they tease others and he doesn&#39;t like  it?  It <br/>
wasn&#39;t clear to me.<br/>
 <br/>
I tell  ya, it&#39;s not uncommon for me or my son or my husband to be  getting <br/>
ready for something BIG and then right before think, &quot;I don&#39;t  really want to <br/>
go/do.&quot;  With me it&#39;s usually an expression of the  overwhelming nature of <br/>
getting ready.  <br/>
 <br/>
With Will it&#39;s usually fear of what&#39;s going to happen.  Fear of the  unknown. <br/>
 We usually help him push through it, because on those  occasions where he&#39;s <br/>
really changed his mind he has regretted it SO much.  <br/>
 <br/>
The most recent example is regarding rollercoasters. Will is fascinated by  <br/>
them and loves to build them on the computer.  But when he sees one in  person <br/>
with its really high chain hill and loop d&#39;loop, it totally freaks him  out.  <br/>
He stiffens and clings to me and things are going on in his head and  it&#39;s a <br/>
true fear.  He rides the ones that don&#39;t go upside down with no  problem <br/>
whatsoever.  He&#39;s had plenty of opportunities to ride the big  ones, but up until <br/>
now he just hasn&#39;t been able to.  It causes great stress  and gnashing of teeth <br/>
and he says some really awful things about himself.   It&#39;s sad.  It&#39;s <br/>
something he really wants to do, but just can&#39;t bring  himself to do it <br/>
 <br/>
Then, on the way home hours later, after we&#39;ve ridden all but the big  ones, <br/>
he has more gnashing of teeth and self-loathing because he DIDN&#39;T ride the  <br/>
big ones while he had the chance.<br/>
 <br/>
Last Saturday at Siliver Dollar City, my husband and I coerced him to stay  <br/>
in line with us on the Powder Keg.  This after he had his fear and  <br/>
self-loathing attack, but expressed that he WANTS to ride it.  Told him he  could walk <br/>
right through the seats and out the other side if he just couldn&#39;t  sit down.  <br/>
Half way through the line while he was waivering and hating  himself, I just <br/>
finally told him he was staying in the line--not mean, not  conditioned on <br/>
riding--just that he had to stay in the line.  And then I  encouraged him by saying <br/>
&quot;be afraid, but ride it anyway.&quot;  As the time  passed and he saw the way the <br/>
train is loaded, etc., he just got through the  fear, and by the time he got <br/>
to sit down, he wasn&#39;t afraid anymore.  It was  a hump he had to get over; fear <br/>
of the unknown.  As soon as he KNEW, he  wasn&#39;t afraid anymore.  He rode it <br/>
twice.  Then he rode Wildfire--the  biggest one in the park, and recounted all <br/>
the coasters he faced and couldn&#39;t  ride before--and how that was all in the <br/>
past, because now he had conquered his  fear of going upside down and up high.<br/>
 <br/>
And on the way home, he had no regrets.<br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s pretty normal to have doubts about something big like a trip  <br/>
away from home.  I&#39;d try to fix something like anticipated bullying,  though, <br/>
without making my kid a bigger target.<br/>

<br/>
I would attempt to meet with the leaders to stop the bullying/teasing.  <br/>
Without making it worse for your son.  Like a meeting that is generic (no names).  <br/>
Making sure that all the boys understand that it is unacceptable and what it <br/>
does to others.  That type of thing.  If they (leaders) want him to stay in <br/>
then they will make it better for him.  I see the &quot;boys will be boys&quot; thing too <br/>
but it doesn&#39;t have to cost someone their enjoyment or contentment.  Scouting <br/>
should be fun.<br/>
<br/>
If not, find him a new troop/den.  He may enjoy that.  His closest friends <br/>
may be waiting around the corner in another place.  If not, maybe he needs a new <br/>
thing.  Or a break.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Him, and these incidents happened last year at summer camp, he<br/>
sometimes holds things in and they build-up and come out all at once.<br/>
<br/>
 It was when we were packing he confided a few stories to me. Example,<br/>
Last year while at camp, he had gottten his feet wet and his shoes<br/>
bled a blueish color onto his socks, he took his wet socks and shoes<br/>
off to put by the campfire to dry and some other scout threw them in<br/>
the fire claiming they were a &quot;biohazard&quot;. And then he earned the<br/>
nickname trenchfoot.<br/>
<br/>
At this particular camp the tents are built up on 2 by 4 frames to<br/>
keep the rain out, when he entered a tent to hang out with some other<br/>
boys One scout demanded he get out because he was exceeding the weight<br/>
limit and was sure to bust the floor.(He is about 25 lbs overweight,<br/>
according to &quot;charts&quot;  he&#39;s healthy and it doesn&#39;t affect his ability<br/>
to do anything so I feel it is no big deal)<br/>
<br/>
And the one that really got me, one of the scouts took his pikachu<br/>
pillow, slit it open strung it up to a tree and beat on it.<br/>
<br/>
And the clincher, He got stuck in a tent alone, (2 cots per tent and<br/>
an odd number of boys) got frightened in the middle of the night, went<br/>
into another tent and slept on the floor when he awoke nearly the<br/>
whole group then called him sissy boy.<br/>

merely to make the leaders happy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So they want to use him, because he makes their jobs easier. <br/>
His  presence makes camp better for OTHER people.<br/>
 <br/>
That argument has been used to discourage people from homeschooling,  because <br/>
their child&#39;s sparkly nature or involved mom was good for the  classroom.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-Should I suggest he should give it<br/>
another try or tell him to throw  in the towel? -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Those aren&#39;t the only two choices.  You&#39;ve made it too black and  white.  <br/>
Staying home from one campout doesn&#39;t equate to &quot;throwing in the  towel.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I have relatives tell me I cannot<br/>
protect him from everything forever  Well I feel I can try as long as I<br/>
am still breathing!! -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe think of it as helping him as long as and whenever he wants  help.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Would totally appreciate any advice from anyone who has been<br/>
through  this.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Through... being a mom?<br/>
Having a son?<br/>
Being bullied by relatives?<br/>
Letting a child making his own decisions?<br/>
 <br/>
Offer something cool for the two of you to do during the camp, maybe, so  <br/>
that when people ask why he didn&#39;t go he can say &quot;I went to Six Flags...&quot; or &quot;I  <br/>
was out of town with my mom.&quot;  That would be a kindness, to give him an  <br/>
alternate and cool thing so he has something better to say than &quot;The other kids  <br/>
are mean so I stayed home.&quot;    And you would have the addition to  your <br/>
unschooling and interpersonal lives of a cool outing, too.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I feel this will lead to more teasing and harrassment. She is sure  it<br/>
will not.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;s saying what she thinks will get you to send him to camp.<br/>
Why should it be between you and her?<br/>
Let your son decide, but offer him something attractive and fun, too.<br/>

Which would be less likely to make bullies stop bullying, though:   &quot;You <br/>
tattled&quot; or &quot;Your mom talked to the leaders and you&#39;re a baby&quot;?   <br/>
<br/>
Some bullying just needs to be avoided.  If bullying could be  prevented, <br/>
someone would&#39;ve &quot;fixed&quot; it a long time ago.  It&#39;s one thing  to be vigilant <br/>
about bullying in your own home, but to control a boyscout camp  from a distance <br/>
ain&#39;t happenin&#39;.<br/>

 <br/>
No, I don&#39;t mean that I thought he &quot;had to&quot;.  He &quot;had to&quot; in order to  get <br/>
what he wanted.  Like, in order to get the Otter Pop out of the  freezer, I &quot;had <br/>
to&quot; open the freezer door.  <br/>
 <br/>
The hump of fear was in the way, and he&#39;d been trying to get around it and  <br/>
couldn&#39;t and once things reached critical mass and he gained momentum, he did  <br/>
it.  That doesn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t WANT to.  He clearly WANTED to.   Clearly.  <br/>
Unequivocally wanted to.  Over and over again, at many many  amusement parks, <br/>
over a number of years since he was 3.  He wanted  to.  Feeling fear about it <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t want to ride and get over  the hump of fear.  <br/>
 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Time for the Walt Disney story.<br/>
We went to Walt Disney World when Josh was 7. I told my mother it was <br/>
too soon because of all of Josh&#39;s fears, but she was footing the bill <br/>
and he wanted to go and I knew the opportunity might never come again. <br/>
(We just HAD to go then because the next year my nephew (who was also <br/>
too young) would be in school and God knows they would not take him out <br/>
for a week so we could go to WDW in early May.) Josh had fun, I had fun, <br/>
but it drove my mother (and my sister) crazy that Josh and my nephew <br/>
would not go in any shows (too dark) or any ride that looked too scary. <br/>
My poor nephew melted down in the &quot;Honey I shrunk the Kids&quot; playground <br/>
when the 1st thing he saw was the 10 foot plastic spider. Josh went <br/>
hysterical (screaming and crying---of course we left) while watching the <br/>
&quot;famous&quot; nightly fireworks &#39;cause he thought they were going to hit and <br/>
kill us.....even when they did not hit and kill us.<br/>
Mostly the boys swam in all the cool pools and looked at stuff.<br/>
At that point in Josh&#39;s life it also drove me crazy, but I kept my mouth <br/>
shut for the most part, and did not force him to do anything he was <br/>
afraid of ---unlike my sister.<br/>
The day we left Josh said &quot;I can&#39;t wait till we come again. Now that I <br/>
know what&#39;s here I &#39;ll do everything.&quot;<br/>
~sigh~<br/>
At 13 we still have not been back, but he did finally ride a rollar coaster.<br/>
I guess my point is I understand Tucker&#39;s point about the hump of fear. <br/>
She knows how far Josh (and in a way me and my inability to deal with <br/>
it) has come in moving past his fear of unfamiliar situations, people, <br/>
and places.<br/>
Josh has always been afraid and tentative of a lot of things and I&#39;m <br/>
really never sure when to push or not. What I do know is that I do not <br/>
want him to grow up always looking back, wishing he had tired this or <br/>
that, regretting the chances he did not take. He still regrets what he <br/>
did not do at WDW.<br/>
I do not want his fears to rule his life.<br/>
So I encourage him to do things and go places that his first response <br/>
might be &quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot; (that a fearful &quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot; instead of <br/>
a &quot; ~meh~ that&#39;s not something I like to do&quot;) with the understanding <br/>
that he can leave or stop whenever he wants to.<br/>
Like camp.<br/>
He went to camp this summer and had a pretty good time, but he knew I&#39;d <br/>
come and get him if he hated it, or the kids were mean, or if there were <br/>
bad storms ----(thunderstorms are another fear that can paralyze <br/>
him---somedays we do not go places if he even knows that there is a <br/>
chance of storms)----which there were, but in the end he made it through <br/>
by calling me to check on the warnings and to get radar updates.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If adults are aware and alert to the beginnings of teasing (which I <br/>
think that is what this was really about) - they can possibly nip it in <br/>
the bud, I think.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best approaches I&#39;ve seen is to simply remind all the kids <br/>
that they can step in and say, &quot;Stop it,&quot; if they are uncomfortable <br/>
about somebody teasing one of their friends. Lots of times teasing gets <br/>
to become the way kids relate - and some kids think it is &quot;just <br/>
teasing&quot; and doesn&#39;t really mean anything and that the teasing kids are <br/>
just &quot;fooling around,&quot; and stuff like that. So they ignore it when <br/>
somebody is getting teased. But - if a trusted adult whom the kids know <br/>
and like will just mention that they&#39;ve heard there is teasing going on <br/>
and that people&#39;s feelings are getting hurt and that it is up to them <br/>
to create an atmosphere in which teasing isn&#39;t the way kids relate to <br/>
each other -- that can make a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
Not a big lecture. Not a big huge deal made of it. Talking not to the <br/>
teasers, but to the kids who are standing by and letting it go on. <br/>
Often they&#39;re uncomfortable, too, and it just takes bringing it out <br/>
into the open to get them to be willing to say something.<br/>
<br/>
Also - the kid being teased might benefit from a bit of what used to be <br/>
known as &quot;assertiveness training&quot; - learning to say, &quot;Don&#39;t talk to me <br/>
like that anymore, I really don&#39;t like it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Talking to the parents of the teasing kid - that seems unlikely to help <br/>
and could make things worse.<br/>

<br/>
That was last years&#39; camp you said?  So do these things still go on?  If so, <br/>
and he agrees to get out-then do it.  I highly recommend a new group if he <br/>
wants to stay in.  Obviously he has held onto these things and it&#39;s not cool.  I <br/>
agree with finding a new thing to do-something fun for him to replace this <br/>
camp stuff.<br/>

  &gt; What is  all of your opinions? Should I suggest he should give it<br/>
  &gt; another try or  tell him to throw in the towel?  (I&#39;m asking this<br/>
  &gt; because he is  totally on the fence and so much like his mother who<br/>
  &gt; doesn&#39;t often make up  her mind  easily alone)<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; ~~~<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; They&#39;re teasing HIM?  Or they tease others and he doesn&#39;t like  it?  It<br/>
  &gt; wasn&#39;t clear to me.<br/>
<br/>
  Him, and these incidents happened last year at summer camp, he<br/>
  sometimes holds things in and they build-up and come out all at once.<br/>
<br/>
  It was when we were packing he confided a few stories to me. Example,<br/>
  Last year while at camp, he had gottten his feet wet and his shoes<br/>
  bled a blueish color onto his socks, he took his wet socks and shoes<br/>
  off to put by the campfire to dry and some other scout threw them in<br/>
  the fire claiming they were a &quot;biohazard&quot;. And then he earned the<br/>
  nickname trenchfoot.<br/>
<br/>
  At this particular camp the tents are built up on 2 by 4 frames to<br/>
  keep the rain out, when he entered a tent to hang out with some other<br/>
  boys One scout demanded he get out because he was exceeding the weight<br/>
  limit and was sure to bust the floor.(He is about 25 lbs overweight,<br/>
  according to &quot;charts&quot;  he&#39;s healthy and it doesn&#39;t affect his ability<br/>
  to do anything so I feel it is no big deal)<br/>
<br/>
  And the one that really got me, one of the scouts took his pikachu<br/>
  pillow, slit it open strung it up to a tree and beat on it.<br/>
<br/>
  And the clincher, He got stuck in a tent alone, (2 cots per tent and<br/>
  an odd number of boys) got frightened in the middle of the night, went<br/>
  into another tent and slept on the floor when he awoke nearly the<br/>
  whole group then called him sissy boy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I tell  ya, it&#39;s not uncommon for me or my son or my husband to be<br/>
  getting<br/>
  &gt; ready for something BIG and then right before think, &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
  really want to<br/>
  &gt; go/do.&quot;  With me it&#39;s usually an expression of the  overwhelming<br/>
  nature of<br/>
  &gt; getting ready.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; With Will it&#39;s usually fear of what&#39;s going to happen.  Fear of the<br/>
  unknown.<br/>
  &gt;  We usually help him push through it, because on those  occasions<br/>
  where he&#39;s<br/>
  &gt; really changed his mind he has regretted it SO much.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; The most recent example is regarding rollercoasters. Will is<br/>
  fascinated by<br/>
  &gt; them and loves to build them on the computer.  But when he sees one<br/>
  in  person<br/>
  &gt; with its really high chain hill and loop d&#39;loop, it totally freaks<br/>
  him  out.<br/>
  &gt; He stiffens and clings to me and things are going on in his head and<br/>
  it&#39;s a<br/>
  &gt; true fear.  He rides the ones that don&#39;t go upside down with no<br/>
  problem<br/>
  &gt; whatsoever.  He&#39;s had plenty of opportunities to ride the big  ones,<br/>
  but up until<br/>
  &gt; now he just hasn&#39;t been able to.  It causes great stress  and<br/>
  gnashing of teeth<br/>
  &gt; and he says some really awful things about himself.   It&#39;s sad.  It&#39;s<br/>
  &gt; something he really wants to do, but just can&#39;t bring  himself to do it<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Then, on the way home hours later, after we&#39;ve ridden all but the<br/>
  big  ones,<br/>
  &gt; he has more gnashing of teeth and self-loathing because he DIDN&#39;T<br/>
  ride the<br/>
  &gt; big ones while he had the chance.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Last Saturday at Siliver Dollar City, my husband and I coerced him<br/>
  to stay<br/>
  &gt; in line with us on the Powder Keg.  This after he had his fear and<br/>
  &gt; self-loathing attack, but expressed that he WANTS to ride it.  Told<br/>
  him he  could walk<br/>
  &gt; right through the seats and out the other side if he just couldn&#39;t<br/>
  sit down.<br/>
  &gt; Half way through the line while he was waivering and hating<br/>
  himself, I just<br/>
  &gt; finally told him he was staying in the line--not mean, not<br/>
  conditioned on<br/>
  &gt; riding--just that he had to stay in the line.  And then I<br/>
  encouraged him by saying<br/>
  &gt; &quot;be afraid, but ride it anyway.&quot;  As the time  passed and he saw the<br/>
  way the<br/>
  &gt; train is loaded, etc., he just got through the  fear, and by the<br/>
  time he got<br/>
  &gt; to sit down, he wasn&#39;t afraid anymore.  It was  a hump he had to get<br/>
  over; fear<br/>
  &gt; of the unknown.  As soon as he KNEW, he  wasn&#39;t afraid anymore.  He<br/>
  rode it<br/>
  &gt; twice.  Then he rode Wildfire--the  biggest one in the park, and<br/>
  recounted all<br/>
  &gt; the coasters he faced and couldn&#39;t  ride before--and how that was<br/>
  all in the<br/>
  &gt; past, because now he had conquered his  fear of going upside down<br/>
  and up high.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; And on the way home, he had no regrets.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I think it&#39;s pretty normal to have doubts about something big like a<br/>
  trip<br/>
  &gt; away from home.  I&#39;d try to fix something like anticipated bullying,<br/>
  though,<br/>
  &gt; without making my kid a bigger target.<br/>

They should&#39;ve put three in one tent.   That&#39;s just hateful bad  planning.<br/>

Crap like that will stick with a person for life.  You&#39;re not  protecting him <br/>

I thought it was going to be the more recent Disney story of a boy who  died, <br/>

&gt; &gt; They&#39;re teasing HIM?  Or they tease others and he doesn&#39;t like  it?  It<br/>
&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t clear to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Him, and these incidents happened last year at summer camp, he<br/>
&gt; sometimes holds things in and they build-up and come out all at once.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It was when we were packing he confided a few stories to me. Example,<br/>
&gt; Last year while at camp, he had gottten his feet wet and his shoes<br/>
&gt; bled a blueish color onto his socks, he took his wet socks and shoes<br/>
&gt; off to put by the campfire to dry and some other scout threw them in<br/>
&gt; the fire claiming they were a &quot;biohazard&quot;. And then he earned the<br/>
&gt; nickname trenchfoot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At this particular camp the tents are built up on 2 by 4 frames to<br/>
&gt; keep the rain out, when he entered a tent to hang out with some other<br/>
&gt; boys One scout demanded he get out because he was exceeding the weight<br/>
&gt; limit and was sure to bust the floor.(He is about 25 lbs overweight,<br/>
&gt; according to &quot;charts&quot;  he&#39;s healthy and it doesn&#39;t affect his ability<br/>
&gt; to do anything so I feel it is no big deal)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And the one that really got me, one of the scouts took his pikachu<br/>
&gt; pillow, slit it open strung it up to a tree and beat on it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And the clincher, He got stuck in a tent alone, (2 cots per tent and<br/>
&gt; an odd number of boys) got frightened in the middle of the night, went<br/>
&gt; into another tent and slept on the floor when he awoke nearly the<br/>
&gt; whole group then called him sissy boy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh Hell NO would I send my kid back to that type of abuse....your poor <br/>
boy....unless he really, really wanted to go and felt that he could deal <br/>
with it. I&#39;d also try to encourage him to maybe move to a different <br/>
troop if possible and try some other type of summer camp.<br/>
Sandra is right that type of crap stays with you your whole life.<br/>
I was teased horribly by two girls who were supposed to my best friends <br/>
(Sue Haag and Vicky Zerillo---see how bad it was, I can even remember <br/>
their names and I&#39;m 42) in 7/8th grade. I can still remember how cruel <br/>
it was and still have no idea why I never told my parents or one of the <br/>
Nuns---I just wanted to be their friend so desperately, but I also <br/>
wanted an adult to notice and get me out of it without being shamed by <br/>
those girls in the process. When our relationship was good, it was so <br/>
much fun, but I never knew when I was going to become the object of <br/>
derision and abuse. Sick, huh?<br/>
I picked the all girls high school just because neither of them would be <br/>
attending there. What really saved me was the fact that we moved and I <br/>
was free from even having to see encounter folks who might know them.<br/>
<br/>
As an adult I would walk away from a situation like the one described.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Those are some pretty bad incidents.  What can happen in those groups,<br/>
too, is that someone like your son is bothered by a few of those<br/>
incidents, and his anxiety increases around the group.  The group<br/>
picks up on that, and starts poking at him more and more.  It can fall<br/>
into a really bad dynamic, and one that the adults there don&#39;t<br/>
comprehend at all.  The adults continue to see your son as &quot;such a<br/>
nice guy,&quot; and that exacerbates his role among the kids, too,<br/>
especially if the adults try to stick up for him or get the teasing to<br/>
stop.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying this dynamic definitely *will* happen, but it can.  I&#39;m<br/>
sure we&#39;ve all seen it happen at school and at camps in our own<br/>
childhoods.  Most adults forget about it, I think, but it&#39;s there,<br/>
under our radar.<br/>
<br/>
If, after you&#39;ve encouraged him to do something else, he still really<br/>
wants to go (I&#39;m doubting it, but who knows), I would make sure he has<br/>
an exit plan.  A cell phone, an adult there that will call you,<br/>
someway to get you there to pick him up.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
If these happened at summer camp, why would he drop entirely out of Boy <br/>
Scouts because of it? These aren&#39;t the boys he is with on a regular <br/>
basis, right?<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t send him back to the same summer camp because of the <br/>
obviously poor planning and supervision. If he really wants to go to <br/>
camp, try another one, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
But - for some reason the original question sounded like it was an <br/>
ongoing situation - didn&#39;t it refer to talking to the scout leaders <br/>
and/or parents, etc?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hot and cold with these kids. Sometimes he comes home so excited<br/>
cause they were nice to him, and other times deflated cause they were<br/>
mean. Always wanting to go back till this time, I think he finally had<br/>
enough.  <br/>
<br/>
I am so glad, and I have tried to make this week extra special for<br/>
him, bought him an extra jug of gas for his 4-wheeler so he could ride<br/>
with the neighbor boy who is his friend thru thick or thin. We are<br/>
going to Chuckie cheeses Thursday, we have a ton of free token coupons<br/>
of the kool-aid Bursts, He&#39;s fishing today with his uncle. He&#39;s going<br/>
to work with his dad friday  then we will go to the drive-in movie to<br/>
see Star wars.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad he is done, and on his own terms. I guess I felt I was<br/>
overreacting to the incidents due to what some family (mostly in-laws)<br/>
said and the one leader I spoke to. However when I told my mom and she<br/>
sobbed, I realized helping him get out was the right thing to do. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the advice. <br/>

be the ones who will give you a hard time about making sure they &quot;sick <br/>
with it&quot; and not letting them &quot;be quitters&quot; and all that stuff.<br/>
