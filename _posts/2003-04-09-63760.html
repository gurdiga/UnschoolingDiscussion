my mother-in-law/next-door-neighbour/Experilab shop-owner about how my kids are never going to make<br/>
it in life because they are not getting a &#39;proper&#39; education (their view of course), but I give in<br/>
to the pressure and the fear, and then I yell at my kids -get off that computer and do<br/>
something constructive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And then I feel so terrible because I still have to grow and<br/>

pillar to post and I don&#39;t handle that so well because it makes me feel like I&#39;m failing and so then<br/>
I get stressed and short-tempered and irritable and answer questions in that stressed and<br/>
short-tempered and irritable kind of way so that the learning experience and closeness is ruined and<br/>
my kids regret they asked.........<br/>
<br/>
Or when they try something and do it &#39;wrong&#39; and then I am not gracious about the failure.......<br/>
<br/>
Or when I have an &#39;idea&#39; but the rest of the clan is less than excited about it and then I feel<br/>
hurt/rejected/whatever because it was an important idea to me, and then I don&#39;t handle that so<br/>
well........<br/>
<br/>
Or when I walk into the kitchen and one of the kids is painting/cooking/whatever and going overboard<br/>
with the paint/ingredients and/or is making a colossal mess, and then I yell at them and then I feel<br/>
bad because they weren&#39;t actually doing anything wrong - just inexperienced. So I cool off and come<br/>
back and<br/>
say sorry but the<br/>
creativity that was flowing has been shut off just like that and it is 3 weeks before anyone touches<br/>
the art cupboard again.........<br/>
<br/>
Or sometimes it&#39;s just because the baby woke up cross, and interrupted something really precious<br/>
that was happening and we  don&#39;t get back to it because the moment was lost....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;.......a particular day that is not very successful in completely unschooling........&quot;  is when I<br/>
try to realise that ideal of being an unschooling parent but fail, and we all lose out as a result.<br/>
Fortunately :-) these kind of experiences are happening less and less often. But they do still<br/>
happen. Because unschooling asks so much more of me than I am right now; challenges me to be soooo<br/>
different from the kind of authoritarian controlling mother I had; asks me to give so much more<br/>
freedom than my dirt-poor family and boarding-school life ever gave me. I am learning to smile at<br/>
myself and at my kids; to know that it doesn&#39;t matter if any of us fail - we will do better next<br/>
time. I am so grateful for the opportunity to learn in freedom alongside my kids. Life is wonderful.<br/>
Life is healing.<br/>

curriculum in our information age.  Ask people how many hours a day the<br/>
local schools are providing Computer Lab, and if public schools are<br/>
preparing students for the amount of time adults spend on the computer.<br/>

it&#39;s the _______.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I HIGHLY recommend that you send Sandra a check for her audiotape, <br/>
Peaceful Parenting. If THAT won&#39;t get you &quot;there&quot;, I don&#39;t know what will!<br/>

Good luck!<br/>

These are good to say out loud - days like this - we ALL have!!! All of  <br/>
us get overwhelmed at times, that&#39;s for SURE. Life does that to us.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking she meant something other than these kinds of totally  <br/>
normal mom-has-had-it moments (or hours).<br/>
<br/>
My mom, who thought unschooling was the best thing in the whole world,  <br/>
told me that some people needed to send their kids to preschool, not to  <br/>
learn and get ready for school or anything like that, but so that the  <br/>
little ones could have somewhere that it was okay to make a mess and  <br/>
that, once they were out of preschool, those poor kids NEVER got to do  <br/>
anything that was messy ever again - that it upset their parents too  <br/>
much. I really hadn&#39;t thought about what it would be like to not let  <br/>
the kids ever make a mess. Mine are SO messy - especially my oldest  <br/>
daughter (now 18) who STILL plays with mud (she is a ceramicist) and  <br/>
does collaging and all kinds of art - right now she has clay all over  <br/>
the patio tables (I moved her outside - it started off in the house)  <br/>
and little pieces of sea glass all over the living room coffee table  <br/>
that she is using to make a mosaic. I&#39;ve lived with so much mess for so  <br/>
long that I&#39;m used to it - but once in a while I look around and just  <br/>
wish that I could have an &quot;ordinary&quot; house. Okay - truth is - ONCE in a  <br/>
while I look around and wish I could have an &quot;ordinary&quot; family. But -  <br/>
that&#39;s just when they are all being TOO creative and I have these  <br/>
moments of thinking IF they all went to school I&#39;d have 5 or 6 hours to  <br/>
myself five days a week AND I could send them to bed early for good  <br/>
reason and they&#39;d have to spend an hour or two a day doing homework and  <br/>
just THINK of all that time I&#39;d have to ---- do what? Clean the  <br/>
house??? WHAT a boring life - I&#39;d be so miserable!!!! NEEEEEVVVVVERRRRR  <br/>
MIIIIIIIND!!!!!!!<br/>

&lt;&lt;Or when 5 kids all want me to interact/help them with something at once<br/>
and I feel harried from<br/>
pillar to post and I don&#39;t handle that so well because it makes me feel like<br/>
I&#39;m failing and so then<br/>
I get stressed and short-tempered and irritable and answer questions in that<br/>
stressed and<br/>
short-tempered and irritable kind of way so that the learning experience and<br/>
closeness is ruined and<br/>
my kids regret they asked.........&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well this one I can certainly empathize with. Of course not 5 kids but I do<br/>
have 4. And even though most people tell me how lucky I am to have Tara, I<br/>
feel lucky in a way they are not thinking of. I have most people figure that<br/>
because she&#39;s 17 she somehow doesn&#39;t need mothering and I can pretty much<br/>
leave her on her own. That and that she can help me with the other 3. I can<br/>
count on one hand the times I&#39;ve actually asked Tara to watch the kids for<br/>
me. Of course she interacts with them on her own, but not in a watching<br/>
mothering kind of way. I certainly woulnd&#39;t expect her to. And Tara,<br/>
although easier because of her age, has a whole other set of parenting<br/>
needs.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s the only time I feel the strain. When all 4 want something and<br/>
I&#39;m just not enough of a person at once to do it. My mom tells me I have a<br/>
rubber butt because I&#39;m bouncing up all the time. Seems like when I do get a<br/>
chance to sit down, someone needs something and of course the others never<br/>
need something too until I try and sit back down!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure though that this has most to do with unschooling as much as it<br/>
does just being a mom of more than 1 or 2 kids. It&#39;s hard sometimes, like<br/>
when one gets sick and you just know you are going to be dealing with it for<br/>
awhile as it makes it&#39;s way through the whole house. (like me now again!) Or<br/>
when you go somewhere and 3 are having a good time and 1 is bored. With one<br/>
child, you either just stay or go! They get sick and then well!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, my frustration today with Joseph and Alyssa getting sick is showing.<br/>
We missed a field trip today. Sierra missed sports camp last week and it<br/>
looks like Joseph will miss this week. We were planning on the zoo this<br/>
weekend. Alyssa was up last night not feeling good.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s times like this that make me feel not like it&#39;s not a good unschooling<br/>
day, just like it&#39;s not a good mother day. Meaning I should be able to do<br/>
more.<br/>
