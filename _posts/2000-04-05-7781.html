&lt;&lt; Hello all, I am trying to find somewhere that I can buy a model of the<br/>
 ear/inner ear. My four year old daughter is REALLY interested in learning<br/>
 how the ear works, and I would love to get a model for her. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Try asking your pediatrician.  They often get these models from drug reps - <br/>
you&#39;ve probably seen them sitting on the counters in the little examining <br/>
room.  If you overlook the drug company&#39;s logo on the side of it, they are <br/>
pretty decent models.   Maybe she/he would let you have one, or at least <br/>
borrow one for awhile.  <br/>
