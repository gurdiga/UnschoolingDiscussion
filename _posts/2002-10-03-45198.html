<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616305021"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:starsuncloud@...">starsuncloud@...</a><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Sierra is like this too.<br/>
If she doesn&#39;t want to talk to someone, she won&#39;t look at them and just acts <br/>
like they don&#39;t exist. It drives some people batty.<br/>
But she is slowly getting more open and talkative. Even ordered her own food <br/>
at the restaurant last week, a first! Usually the waiters get ignored.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s the name. &lt;BG&gt; My Sierra will talk in the kind of ways you are <br/>
mentioning. What I have a problem with is her talking to me when something <br/>
happens between her and her brother or sister. She generally just starts <br/>
crying and I can&#39;t get anything out of her. If I try later when she&#39;s calmed <br/>
down, she may just start crying all over again, or get real teary eyed and <br/>
not say anything but &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; It&#39;s real hard for me to get a <br/>
discussion going with her about &#39;what happened&#39; and what we can do to fix <br/>
it. There are times when she just sits there without saying anything at all <br/>
while I&#39;m just asking her a question. It&#39;s very frustrating to me and my <br/>
husband when we are trying to help. And this only happens with her when <br/>
there is some kind of confrontation, either because of her or in spite of <br/>
her.<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
