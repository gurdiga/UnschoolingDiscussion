<div id="ygrps-yiv-742867359">This came up on another board (nothing to do with schooling either) that I belong to and I was wondering if any of you have researched it at all. If you have what are your thoughts on it.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149981905">I did a very quick look see.  Basically skimmed two websites.<br/>
<br/>
What do I think?  I think it looks like a new age, pyramid sitting,<br/>
massive rationalization on why we should treat our kids like human<br/>
beings.  Oh, and why we shouldn&#39;t be surprised, that having become<br/>
anti-establishment folk, we should have kids who can&#39;t stand in line<br/>
for no good reason.<br/>
<br/>
Uhm, seems a bit silly to me.  And I&#39;m a card carrying witch for whom<br/>
phrases like &quot;past lives&quot; and &quot;old soul&quot; don&#39;t sound unusual or<br/>
unreasonable at all.  (No, I don&#39;t really have a card, no wait!  I<br/>
do!!!  LOL!  I have a business card for the community group I help run.)<br/>
<br/>
Our children are who they are.  MOST people respond better when<br/>
treated like human beings and not chattel.  No matter how their karma<br/>
is doing.<br/>

Personally I&#39;m not convinced it&#39;s anything much beyond wishfulness or another <br/>
way to describe long-existing traits.<br/>
<br/>
One place to go to read more about it is<br/>

They have other kinds of articles too, but they seem to specialize in Indigo <br/>
and giftedness (they see that as a form of giftedness, I think, in their <br/>
context).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791962381">The following is a quote from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://kryon.com/k_37.html">http://kryon.com/k_37.html</a><br/>
a description of a book called The Indigo Children.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;These children are truly special, representing a great percentage of all the kids being born today on a worldwide basis. They come in &quot;knowing&quot; who they are - so they must be recognized, celebrated for their exceptional qualities, and guided with love and care.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now aren&#39;t all children truly special, coming into the world knowing who they are.  As a parent I believe it&#39;s been my job from the beginning to not get in the way of my child being her self, to celebrate their exceptional qualities in a loving and caring environment.<br/>

Thank you for posting this. It is clarifying the reasons why I have always<br/>
had an amorphous feeling of discomfort on the various occasions I have come<br/>
across this Indigo Children concept � future cultural/spiritual leaders<br/>
or�something. Somehow reading that some kids are born more special than<br/>
others made me feel worried or like I should be concerned that Jayn was<br/>
somehow inadequate � it�s a bit like how sometimes reading fashion magazines<br/>
can make me feel fat and ugly in the midst of all the �how to be beautiful�<br/>
advice. Without the magazines I feel much better about myself. Maybe the<br/>
point should be that all children are Indigo, but I never felt it when I<br/>
read about indigo children online. Who decides that a child is not worthy of<br/>
being celebrated or guided with love and care? Don�t children with any kind<br/>
of setback need just as much love and care? Bah!<br/>

Yeah, well...<br/>
I suspect it&#39;s about the moms at some level more than about the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone seen any &quot;My child is an Indigo&quot; bumper stickers?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d buy one.  Rather - how about &quot;all children are indigo.&quot;   I am still looking for the &quot;unschooling schoolbus&quot; bumper sticker to put on my car &lt;or&gt; &quot;drive carefully school is not in session.&quot;<br/>
