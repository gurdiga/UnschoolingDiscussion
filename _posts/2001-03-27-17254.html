<div id="ygrps-yiv-824546282">It&#39;s that time of year again...testing.<br/>
<br/>
I live in VA, which requires that I show proof of progress each year either<br/>
by portfolio, evaluation or standardized test.  The minimum requirement for<br/>
testing is the 23rd percentile, which is not so difficult.  My ds is &quot;in<br/>
2nd&quot; grade so last year was the first year we were required to show proof of<br/>
progress.  The test seems the least obtrusive way to show progress to the<br/>
school board, especially since there are no qualified evaluators in my rural<br/>
area who would be sympathetic to unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
My question, as an unschooler, can I possibly keep using standardized test<br/>
scores as my child gets older?  We&#39;ve just received our CAT and he&#39;ll have<br/>
no problem with it this year.  However, I&#39;ve looked at the CAT tests for<br/>
older kids and the math continues in a very textbook  fashion.  There are<br/>
many things that I can&#39;t see coming up naturally on the 3rd/4th-grade (and<br/>
on) tests.<br/>
<br/>
My ds has a very good understanding of math principles but since we don&#39;t<br/>
&quot;do math&quot; I don&#39;t know how I can keep using the tests unless I become a ps<br/>
teacher and simply teach to the test 2-3 weeks before administering it.<br/>
<br/>
We are committed unschoolers and it works perfectly for my ds.  I don&#39;t want<br/>
to unschool everything but math.  I can&#39;t see how we can put together a<br/>
portfolio either, since we don&#39;t do &quot;schoolwork&quot;.   Any suggestions from<br/>
veteran unschoolers would be greatly appreciated!<br/>

<br/>
Instead of &quot;portfolio&quot; think &quot;scrapbook.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of cool clear-plastic envelopes and photo pages for regular <br/>
old three-ring binders like schoolkids use.  Put in a photos of your child <br/>
doing interesting things and being in interesting places (not necessarily <br/>
exotic and out of town).   Put in museum brochures and handouts.  Tickets <br/>
from concerts, or a movie ticket next to some tie-in things, and if the <br/>
evaluator asks you can say &quot;Watching that movie led to an interest in <br/>
[whatever] and we pursued that.&quot;  Letters in and out, magazine articles you <br/>
read.  Lists of books read, or books-on-tape listened to.<br/>
<br/>
There are PBS websites for the kids&#39; shows like &quot;Between the Lions&quot; and maybe <br/>
some printouts from that with notes that your kids watch whatever <br/>
occasionally, which covers [and then the list of academic skills targetted <br/>
from the show].<br/>
<br/>
Those are things your kids don&#39;t even have to know happened.  They&#39;re <br/>
learning without the scrapbook, and you-the-mom could be making something <br/>
neat for them to look back at after the theatre&#39;s closed adn those TV shows <br/>
are defunct and the places they visited have been all remodelled.<br/>
<br/>
FOR INSTANCE:  Holly and I went to the Jorvik Viking center in York.  I just <br/>
got this from my friend who lives there:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been offered a job at the New Jorvik Viking Centre. The paying <br/>
<br/>
sort. Weekends only, but it&#39;ll look good on my cv. It starts next <br/>
<br/>
week and I am very excited about it. They got rid of the time cars on <br/>
<br/>
the ground and are building a whole new panorama below and the cars <br/>
<br/>
will be above like the people mover from Disneyland. I am not sure of <br/>
<br/>
everything I&#39;ll be expected to do, but they know I am an <br/>
<br/>
archaeologist, historian, and recreationist--I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll find <br/>
<br/>
something.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So Holly and I went on those little cars the last year they were used!  NOW <br/>
our museum flyers are even more special.<br/>
<br/>
Holly mentioned that museum just yesterday, and I got the e-mail this morning.<br/>
<br/>
With that method of recordkeeping, you could do very minimal things, trying <br/>
to touch on various subjects.  You could photograph your child playing with a <br/>
geoboard or dice or counting money.   You could photograph him reading, <br/>
painting (photograph him with the artwork), dressed up in historical costume, <br/>
looking at plants and butterflies in the yard...<br/>
<br/>
You could print out or photocopy some checklist like Worldbook&#39;s (there are <br/>
some things on line, some &quot;expected competencies&quot; kinds of lists and just <br/>
notate that page--maybe line through things he knew before &quot;the year&quot; <br/>
started, date those he comes across (he never needs to see it)... it would be <br/>
official looking, &quot;real&quot; and non-intrusive.<br/>

everything until I have a few minutes to sit down and read), but I do<br/>
portfolio assessments for unschoolers in our area, and many of them have<br/>
WAY more to show me than the more school-at-home type have.  Lots of<br/>
brochures, pictures, scraps of paper, lists of software worked<br/>
on/mastered, library slips, lists of videos, pictures of projects, etc.  <br/>
I also get musical performances, art exhibits, tours of gardens, etc.  <br/>
some bring in actual science projects.  Others page after page of<br/>
programming code they hwave written, lists of url&#39;s to sites they have<br/>
built, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748086196">I am finally listening to the tapes from the conference. I heard most of Ned &<br/>
 Luz&#39;s today. <br/>
<br/>
They mentioned the &quot;t&quot; word. But in this context: they said that Cassidy <br/>
wanted to move to New York to &quot;test&quot; himself---to see whether he could do it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the test that&#39;s important. We &quot;test&quot;ourselves every day in our <br/>
attempts at better parenting, in our trying to say &quot;yes&quot;, in MY hosting a <br/>
conference, or in whatever we&#39;re doing that&#39;s new or hard for us. We&#39;re <br/>
rewarded with happiness and joyfulness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988368803">Can&#39;t really be much help with the whole thing but I do know some kids just <br/>
don&#39;t test well. My Tara is one of them. She&#39;ll do great on the work and <br/>
understands it all, then testing time comes and her mind just freezes up. <br/>
She&#39;s always been like this. She doesn&#39;t bomb the test, but doesn&#39;t do as <br/>
well as she should with the previous work she has done. It&#39;s something we <br/>
try to work through by making sure she feels confident about the work before <br/>
the test. She has gotten a bit better. I think it&#39;s a matter of her getting <br/>
use to it all.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just a block about knowing the test itself is more important than the <br/>
work. I mean after all, that&#39;s what her teachers are always looking at.<br/>
<br/>
She just recently took her SAT&#39;s and did pretty well on them. Score wise <br/>
above average which for a test for her is great. I think that helped her <br/>
confidence some and she wants to take it over and see how she does. We&#39;ve <br/>
gotten to the point where we don&#39;t worry about it and now neither does she. <br/>
She excels in so many more ways and just understands it&#39;s one thing that <br/>
doesn&#39;t work well for her.<br/>
