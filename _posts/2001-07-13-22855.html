<div id="ygrps-yiv-858470128">So here&#39;s the dilemna then... I have a home business that I&#39;ve been <br/>

<br/>
Thank you so much for that simple solution... The problem is me and I know <br/>
it... I feel guilty about doing that, although I would be available to them <br/>
all the other times and in the evening when hubby is also home... I just got <br/>
off the phone with my husband and said &quot;this is all about me and how I deal <br/>
with this issue&quot;... It&#39;s not about the kids because they seem great.  As I&#39;m <br/>
replying to this e-mail Zak ( nearly 6) is making puzzle words and Max <br/>
(nearly 2) is helping him (well walking away with the pieces and showing me <br/>
and then coming back to Zak).<br/>
<br/>
So working on the guilt I feel for wanting to work and keeping my kids home <br/>
is where I&#39;m at... I bet you didn&#39;t think it was that deeply psychological <br/>
did you Tracy (LOL)?<br/>

<br/>
Dawn<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but still there&#39;s nothing wrong with a simple <br/>
solution!  LOL  I think most of us need to find ways to <br/>
keep ourselves connected to the world outside our <br/>
little nuclear families, I know I resent having stuff <br/>
to do with dh&#39;s business taken out of my reach, even <br/>
when it&#39;s done as a &#39;help&#39; to minimise pressure on <br/>
me...  :-(  <br/>
<br/>
Remember, though, that if you&#39;re all at home, at least, <br/>
you ARE accessible should they need you in an emergency <br/>
or if you choose to put down your work for that time.  <br/>
Flexibility is one of the big big pluses of home-ed for <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Is it really guilt, too, or frustration that to remain <br/>
&#39;adult&#39; you have to put your children to one side for a <br/>
while?  Personally, I don&#39;t &#39;do&#39; guilt, it doesn&#39;t help <br/>
me much to wallow...<br/>

Hey, I was on a roll there wasn&#39;t I?  LOL  Wish I could <br/>

What I find frustrating isn&#39;t so much that I need to <br/>

children, more that the rest of the world seems to <br/>
expect me to need to...  kwim or am I CAM??<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband and I run a construction company from our home. My children<br/>
have always been home and unschooled.  We have been in business for<br/>
many years.  I have had help on and off, from mother&#39;s helpers to <br/>
secretarial help.  I much prefer someone helping me in the office.  The<br/>
beauty of unschooling is the flexibility.  How much time do you need to<br/>
spend on your business?  My children entertain themselves <br/>
when I am working.  They are 7, 6 and 4.  They spend a lot of time<br/>
playing, creating, thinking, doing, eating and somethings arguing<br/>
together, whether I am working or not.  I have a set day I work in <br/>
the office with my assistant, but I am not tied to that day.  I also work<br/>
sporadically during the week on things, but if it can hold until the following<br/>
Monday I usually let it.  I don&#39;t feel as if my children are neglected at<br/>
all. They are getting a very real life lesson, one which my husband<br/>
and I encourage on home/family/life/business basically a home-<br/>
centered lifestyle.  They are very much a part of what we do and attend<br/>
all business meetings with me/us--banker, realtor, accountant.  They<br/>
are by no means perfectly quiet children, often interrupting to beg me<br/>
for another piece of candy from the accountants desk. But thats ok &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
Not only are my children learning, but so are the adults around them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718905674">What great feedback and ideas many of you have given me.  I think I just need <br/>
to re-arrange some parts of my business.  For example when I speak to clients <br/>
for 45 minutes in a coaching session I cannot be interuppted and those are <br/>
the times I&#39;m going to need to either do those appointments when dh is home <br/>
or schedule them when I have some help.  I think this also makes me have to <br/>
be even more organized than I already am.....  I&#39;ll need to get more creative <br/>
and I think that will work.  Alternatively I could quit what I&#39;m doing right <br/>
now and get on with another part of my business that I can do at anytime <br/>
which is finish writing a book I&#39;m working on.  So maybe my kids need to be <br/>
homeschooled so that I can take a look at where I want to put my energies... <br/>
Very deep thoughts....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-170255658">I run a veterinary clinic in my home.  I work part time, around the kids<br/>
schedules.  They either entertain themselves upstairs (clinic in basement)<br/>
or they &quot;help&quot; out.  The clients don&#39;t mind; my almost 7 yo dd does some<br/>
basic things like restocking.  The almost 3 yo ds usually just watches.<br/>
<br/>
Does it get chaotic?  Sometimes.  Do I wish I had time to focus completely<br/>
on the task at hand?  Sure.  And I do when dh is home.  Do I go nuts at<br/>
times?  Yes.   But would I do anything differently?  Absolutely NOT.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d prefer to work alone and concentrate.  I&#39;m an introvert by nature and<br/>
like peace and quiet.  But, I am choosing to stay home with my kids and<br/>
homeschool them, so this goes along with the territory at times.  I have<br/>
chosen to get help in the clinic rather than get a babysitter or nanny.<br/>
<br/>
If you already have a sitter and she is working out I see no reason not to<br/>
keep her for both kids (unless she only wants to care for one).<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some.<br/>

time with them - they watch your kids during your appts, and you give<br/>
them equal time later. Also, if you know any teens who homeschool, you<br/>
could flat out hire &#39;em as babysitter for those times.<br/>

I&#39;m not as guilty. But every day he went off to school I felt I had<br/>
