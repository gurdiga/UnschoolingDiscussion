What can you tell me about the Civil Air Patrol?  I have a son, who&#39;s <br/>
almost 13 who is very interested in flying/aviation.  Would this be a <br/>
good way for him to explore this and possibly learn to fly?  I&#39;m a <br/>
bit worried that it may be too regimented for him, being associated <br/>
with the military and all.<br/>
<br/>
As for the report card thing, I would have made up a report saying he <br/>
was meeting or exceeding the requirements for his grade, period.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think I would have signed anything saying he wasn&#39;t achieving <br/>
70% as that implies he is having difficulties and is only <br/>
being &#39;included&#39; as a special case.  Like Sandra said, grades are <br/>
very subjective.  For some reason, parents feel they are not <br/>
qualified to issue them or evaluate the child simply because they are <br/>
not &#39;real teachers&#39;.  I can see why a parent would not want to, but <br/>
as a formality, like for Pop Warner, I don&#39;t see the problem.  You <br/>
know best your own child, see it as permission to sing his praises <br/>
and brag a little! <br/>

Sorry I took so long to get back to you.<br/>
<br/>

 I think this would be a good way to do this.  They require study in <br/>
aviation and aviation history.  Once their first stripe is earned <br/>
(this requires a physical test and mutilple choice test), they can <br/>
prepare and get a gliders license.  They also do o-flights (I think <br/>
that&#39;s the right name) and they go up in private planes like a <br/>
Cessna, with the pilot and two Cadets in each plane.  They will land <br/>
at two different airports and hopefully get a chance to take over the <br/>
controls for a little while.  <br/>

<br/>
Does he like anything about the military?  I would say my <br/>
son,too,hates anything regimented, but he enjoys the Civil Air <br/>
Patrol.  They do make them learn all the &quot;about face&quot; stuff and are <br/>
quite strict about their appearance.  You can always find your local <br/>
unit and try it.  They require you to attend at least three or four <br/>
meeting before you make your final decision.  They may vary from one <br/>
group to the next, I am not sure.  They are an auxillary of the Air <br/>
Force.  They do a lot of community service such as crowd control for <br/>
air shows and traffic control for local events and for the BIG <br/>
firework shore on the fourth.  They have a CAP t-shirt that he would <br/>
have to wear if he joined, until he was there long enough to get his <br/>
BDU (Basic Dress Uniform) and after six months gets to wear his Dress <br/>
Blues. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
