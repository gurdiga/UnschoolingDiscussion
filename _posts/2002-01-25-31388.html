<div id="ygrps-yiv-556637127">For her sixteenth birthday my Carrie wanted permission<br/>
to look for work.  She&#39;s worked since a month after<br/>
that.  Most of her work has been food and/or service<br/>
related.  She would like eventually to own a small<br/>
restaurant.  She learns a great deal from each job,<br/>
and enjoys having more than enough money to live on. <br/>
I chose to spend all my time with her as she grew up,<br/>
only taking jobs I could do at home or with her along.<br/>
 I&#39;ve always been satisfied that I did the best thing<br/>
for us both, but we did without a lot of material<br/>
things.  Now she enjoys greater  physical comfort and<br/>
even gives her little sister an allowance.  Her<br/>
present job with a food factory involves her with the<br/>
EPA, so she&#39;s learning a lot about legal issues,<br/>
health, and safety.  What she liked best in college<br/>
were the theatre classes.  If she had transferred to<br/>
the university she would have majored in theatre.  She<br/>
loves the art of stage and screen production.  She<br/>
writes beautifully and designs clothing and decor. <br/>
Life is long and takes us where we should go.  I&#39;ve<br/>
always emphasized that the most important thing we can<br/>
do is help others.  My girls are good and kind people.<br/>
 As long as they are comfortable with the people<br/>
around them, I&#39;m happy for them.  I know the places<br/>
I&#39;ve landed have always been better than where I<br/>
thought I wanted to go, so I also emphasize the<br/>
importance of allowing life to unfold and waiting for<br/>
a sense of guidance.  If Carrie becomes an actor or a<br/>
restauranteur, she&#39;ll touch people&#39;s lives in an<br/>
important way, but I want them to understand that we<br/>
all give of ourselves within whatever sphere we<br/>
inhabit, and it&#39;s always important.  <br/>

SHe sounds like she is on a wonderful path. I owned a restuarant several <br/>
years ago (okay, more than several!). If she would like to corespond with me <br/>
by email about how I started, please feel free to give her my email addy.<br/>
