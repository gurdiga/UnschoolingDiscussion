<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928790144">Oh boy, here we go . Just today on the front page was an article about an 11 <br/>
yr old boy being locked in the bathroom for days at a time by his parents. <br/>
Apparently the parents were experiencing &quot;spiritual problems&quot;. Of course the <br/>
paper had to mention the fact that the child was being homeschooled, or the <br/>
absence of the child at school would have been noticed and it would never have <br/>
happened. As if the parents of school kids couldn&#39;t lock the poor little guys in <br/>
the bathroom before and after school.<br/>
I have had this incident mentioned to me 5 times today in relation to <br/>
homeschooling!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That truly bites! How do you respond? Have you ever mentioned in your <br/>
responses, that pretty much every kid in the foster systems were abused in some way <br/>
and more than likely they went to school? School attendence doesn&#39;t determine <br/>
who is abused and who isn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m a gamblin kind of girl, I&#39;d <br/>
place a seriously large wager that the percentage of abused children who attend <br/>
school far outweighs those who don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck Nancy in BC!!!<br/>
