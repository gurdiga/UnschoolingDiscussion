their child for whatever they wanted to. Some presented certificates or<br/>
other things they had created for their kids. Some were quite academic, some<br/>
included all sorts of things. We wanted to just honor the kids for the<br/>
things they did that were special to them, or to us. It was a very nice<br/>
evening and a great chance for everyone to hear and honor the things that<br/>
the kids were doing.<br/>

This was what we said for Mackenzie, for instance:<br/>
<br/>
We honor Mackenzie for the many things he has accomplished this year,<br/>
including:<br/>
<br/>
- Learning to ride a 2-wheeler bike<br/>
- Starting his own business and earning his own money through several plant<br/>
sales<br/>
- Running in a road race, a track meet, and doing a bike/run duathlon<br/>
- Writing his own stories and illustrating them<br/>
- Swimming all the way across the pool<br/>
- Constructing all sorts of imaginative machines, pulley systems, and lego<br/>
ships<br/>
- Inventing and caring for the Ojo Team of Legos<br/>
<br/>
and Asa&#39;s was:<br/>
- Learning to ride a bike<br/>
- Inventing stories that keep us all laughing<br/>
- Running in her first road race and a track meet<br/>
- Learning to write her own name<br/>
- Taking good care of her horsies and dollies<br/>
- Drawing many imaginative things, including the classic &quot;Mad Bee&quot;<br/>
- Bringing smiles to everyone around her with her beautiful singing and<br/>
great sense of humor<br/>
