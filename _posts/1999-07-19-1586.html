John is right about the museum....I think it&#39;s rated tops in the country.  We have been members for the past five years - even though we live almost two hours away!!  <br/>
The museum is open until 5 p.m. most days.  I think thet are closed on Mondays.  Also,  they have a park somewhere north of Indy....can&#39;t remember the name or much about it.  We have not been there,  but the literature on it looks great.<br/>
  Try their website....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132206135">Richie Woods is the Children&#39;s Museum&#39;s nature &quot;park&quot;.  It&#39;s northeast of <br/>
downtown off I-69 at 96th st exit... They have a few hiking trails, a <br/>
shelter and two teepee frames.  My eldest has gone to their summer camps <br/>
there and I rate their camps and personnel practically a 10.  Make sure you <br/>
take Mosquito repellant!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-514503405">PS: Richie Woods is a nature preserve...not your typical &quot;park&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s great for older kids--not very stroller friendly, although their trails <br/>
have wood chips.  Members are free; fee&#39;s (i think) are $1 per person.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve just got to put my 2 cents in about the Museum:  IT&#39;S WICKED <br/>
AWESOME!  That&#39;s one of the major things I miss.  Portsmouth NH has a <br/>
Children&#39;s Museum, but in no way measures up to Indys.  Yes, it&#39;s not cheap. <br/>
  But for 5 stories of jam-packed exhibits of the highest quality... (they <br/>
need to do a two day pass or something--I&#39;ve seen many a family practically <br/>
drag the kids from one exhibit to the other, trying to get it all in)<br/>
Not to snub my nose at the one here in NH, but when other Children&#39;s Museums <br/>
are located in an old house with only a handfull of exhibits--wow, I&#39;ve <br/>
realized how good a museum Indy has...<br/>
(do I sound a little &quot;homesick&quot; for the museum?!)<br/>
