<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477746261">Thank You Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
What wonderful comments! I love this list. I love reading everyones posts and replies. Someone always posts an angle that didn&#39;t even occur to me......I know, thats the point but it needs to be said.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, on my own this weekend, I was able to see thru MY cloud of self doubt and realize it was MY cloud. I like the idea that the looks on their faces might be toy-store-what-am-i-missing looks instead of the-other-half-is-doing-all-this-and-I&#39;m-not looks......Yes, I am not deschooled but I&#39;m trying. Yes, I secretly loved the store and wanted to buy a million things but was very careful to not lead them or coax ...maybe too careful.<br/>
Maybe it was lack of sleep the night before, who knows, but &quot;I&quot; felt uncomfortable in the store whereas if I had been there by myself , I think I would have been fine.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t the stuff that they wanted or found interesting that bothered me , it was my , MY feelings of am I doing whats best for them, are they getting enough diversity, meaning there were so many things that we had not looked at,in life, the way they were presented in the isles and I knew I had had that (in elementary school) and I turned out ok. <br/>
<br/>
Sandras website taught me about strewing and I love that and they love it and it gives them diversity, ...<br/>
It was MY problem  and I lost my way , thank you everyone. I read a little Summerhill and Teach Your Own again and am reaching for Learning All the Time right now............thanks for the bridge until I found it myself.<br/>
My next post will be similar to how today ,suddenly my 6y/o ds read this sentence from a book &quot;Then Ricky and his giant Robot flew home for chocolate milk and grilled cheese sandwiches.&quot; (it had been read to him once before, the day before in a book of 121 pages -a few sentences per page with illustrations the rest of the pages)I know, he remembered it, he hesitated a few seconds before chocolate and grilled, but reading is remembering and I&#39;m runnning with it..........he LOVES the book and thats the end.<br/>

No way.<br/>
That website just sits there.   If nobody read it it would be doing nothing <br/>
but being paid for every month and clogging up google.    <br/>
<br/>
You learned about strewing because you found some things other people had <br/>
written and they resonated inside you and you tried it and liked it!<br/>
<br/>
You got an idea, played around with it, thought about the results, and had a <br/>
good time.<br/>
