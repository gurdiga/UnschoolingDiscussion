&lt;&lt; Hey Ren,<br/>
 What is this? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a Japanese Anime show, on the &quot;Adult Swim&quot; program.....which is on the <br/>
Cartoon Network later at night.<br/>
Adult Swim is one of those programs with the warnings up front about <br/>
violence, rude behavior and language etc...<br/>
We love it!! hehe<br/>
InuYasha is fairly tame...it&#39;s about a 1/2 demon 1/2 human and a girl that is <br/>
a reincarnation of a demon slayer. They go about slaying demons and having <br/>
adventures, it&#39;s somewhat dark at times, very mystical/supernatural and <br/>
interesting. I love Inuyasha&#39;s long, white hair. He&#39;s decidedly immature at <br/>
times though.<br/>
Some other programs from Adult Swim are &quot;Home Movies&quot;, &quot;The Brack Show&quot; <br/>
(totally hilarious if you like warped humor), &quot;Space Ghost&quot; (which has real <br/>
live celebrities being interviewed by a cartoon character &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; <br/>
(another Japanese anime).<br/>
The thing they all have in common is the crass humor and/or dark themes.<br/>
Oh, and &quot;YuYu Hakasho&quot; is another anime during that time.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605939282">OK! I know of Adult Swim although I rarely make it that late. I would fall <br/>
asleep about ten but then I&#39;d miss Samurai jack so I fall asleep around <br/>
10:31.<br/>
Now that&#39;s a great cartoon!<br/>

Ooh, I forgot about Samurai Jack, we watched that last night!!<br/>
I LOVE the song &quot;Gotta do that, back to the past, Samurai Jack&quot;...cool.<br/>
He learned how to jump really, really high from these furry, fat forest <br/>
creatures that didn&#39;t know how to defend themselves.<br/>
Jack took care of business boy howdy!<br/>
