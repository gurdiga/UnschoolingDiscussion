<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463646677">Fun things to do while stuck at home without a car:<br/>
<br/>
bake<br/>
build a solar oven<br/>
garden<br/>
build a tree fort<br/>
train the dog<br/>
watch birds<br/>
learn to predict the weather<br/>
do experiments with water pressure<br/>
read everything you can get your hands on<br/>
build bat houses<br/>
raise rabbits<br/>
sew<br/>
<br/>
But above all, do what the kids want to do.  The marine park passes are a<br/>
great idea as long as the kids don&#39;t have to go if they don&#39;t want to or<br/>
they don&#39;t have to be quizzed on the animals, etc..  You might also check<br/>
out 4-H (its not just about raising steers) because many of the projects the<br/>
kids can complete almost completely at home.<br/>

Question...this self directed learning....sounds wonderful and I am loving <br/>
it. As I read the posts on the board I can see how this would work for my <br/>
family and for myself. However, every job gives you a test, you need to take <br/>
test in college, you have to take a driving test, how do you prepare your <br/>
child for test taking if you are not giving them the &quot;formal education&quot; that <br/>
everyone says children need? Did I explain that right? I hope so!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A young woman I know wanted to go to the community college when she was <br/>
16.  Having been unschooled and having no diploma, they wanted her to take <br/>
an English placement exam which involved writing an essay.  She had never <br/>
taken a test in her life, nor written an essay.  After writing several <br/>
essays and getting them critiqued by an English teacher, she got 96%.<br/>
<br/>
If they want to do the thing they have to take the test for, they can learn <br/>
how to take tests.  It&#39;s a skill that can be learned any time.  In fact I <br/>
learned more about test-taking from my grade 7 art teacher than anywhere <br/>
else.  She taught us lots of little hints like:<br/>
Look over the whole test first.  See where the harder and easier parts are.<br/>
Do all the easier questions first, then do the harder ones.<br/>
Unless you&#39;re actually penalized more for a wrong answer, guess the ones <br/>
you don&#39;t know.<br/>
Leave time to proofread but don&#39;t change an answer unless you&#39;re sure it&#39;s <br/>
wrong.  Your first answer was probably right.<br/>
There were probably more, but I can&#39;t think of them just now.<br/>

<br/>
I am not clear how it is that anyone thinks that all jobs do not &quot;test&quot; the <br/>
job-holder.<br/>
<br/>
In a sense, I believe that unschooling can be analogized to the omnipresent <br/>
testing of every real person in the real world, whether it be in the context <br/>
of employment, parenthood, relationships, Monopoly, or otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
If people did not, in general, somewhat innately and somewhat learnedly, <br/>
respond to the &quot;tests&quot; presented by circumstance, then we would not, as a <br/>
society, thrive, progress, and/or exist.<br/>
<br/>
Our desire to strive to address and resolve these &quot;tests&quot; is, to me, the <br/>
essence of unschooling.  Particularly, of course, when the &quot;tests&quot; are those <br/>
of wanting to know that which is unknown, or to learn that which is not yet <br/>
learned.<br/>

of it&#39;s applicants.  One of the hotels I worked for gave a test to <br/>
every applicant.  But even a job for which there is no paper test to <br/>
get the job has one big test for the people who are employed . . . the <br/>
first week or so on the job.  Just because it isn&#39;t a paper and pencil <br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the harder parts of getting unschooling is seeing how the world is<br/>
contained in the world, so to speak ;-) When things get pulled out and<br/>
treated as artificial, we get the feeling they are artificial. But they<br/>
aren&#39;t. It&#39;s only the artificial reproduction of them in schools that<br/>
doesn&#39;t exist in real life.<br/>
<br/>
Before you asked for ideas on helping a child learn the sounds of the<br/>
alphabet. But if you look at your older kids, was grasping that so difficult<br/>
for them? The sounds *are* there in real life. If they weren&#39;t, then why<br/>
would we learn them (formally or informally). It&#39;s useful to walk so kids<br/>
walk. It&#39;s useful to talk so kids talk. The sounds the letters make are<br/>
useful for figuring out what the on screen commands in a video game mean<br/>
(among loads of other things!) so kids figure them out. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
As people said, tests are a part of life. Our mouths will pass or fail us on<br/>
how well we&#39;ve read directions or a recipe. ;-) Tests are also part of real<br/>
games people do just for fun. Video games, logic games, crossword puzzles,<br/>
computer games, personality quizzes and so on.<br/>
<br/>
I think the one lesson about tests that kids don&#39;t need is that their entire<br/>
future is riding on how well they do. That&#39;s a way too prominent message in<br/>
school and kids are having tests thrown at them every which way. If your<br/>
kids want to take the SATs and know there&#39;s books and software and classes<br/>
to familiarize them with the style if they feel it&#39;s necessary and they know<br/>
they can take it as many times as they want (as far as I know!), then it&#39;s<br/>
not a big deal. (petersons.com, ets.org and collegeboard.com all have free<br/>
practice tests.)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, there&#39;s a lot of information about unschooling and getting into college<br/>

Well by that definition, finding out about the job is a test, filling out an <br/>
application and getting an interview is a test, deciding what to wear and <br/>
getting it all on straight and right-side out is a test, finding the place, <br/>
getting there on time, walking through the lobby...<br/>

The original question was about giving paper and pencil tests to kids to <br/>
prepare for all those &lt;exaggerated amount of&gt; required paper and pencil tests <br/>

time since I was 15 at many more jobs than I could ever list. I took a <br/>
written test one time - to apply for a civil service job as a telephone <br/>
switchboard operator for the city. I was 18 and I scored 3rd out of over <br/>
2,000 people taking the test (everybody applying for ANY civil service job <br/>
took the same test at the same time, once a year). It was a basic literacy <br/>
test and it included situational things like: You need to enter someone&#39;s <br/>
backyard on official city business. A sign on the gate says &#39;Beware of Dog.&#39; <br/>
You should: a) open the gate and run in as fast as you can and hope the dog <br/>
doesn&#39;t see you, b) open the gate and call the dog to see if it is friendly, <br/>
c) go to the front door and ask the owners to control the dog before you <br/>
enter, and d) skip that house and go on to the next one.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d go to the front door, but my second answer would be skip it.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had as many jobs as some people here, but two in college (no test), <br/>
one at Dunkin Donuts (no test), El Paragua restaurant (not test), taught in a <br/>
public school (no test, but I had taken a spelling test required before <br/>
certification--the other tests had been abandoned one by one as unfair or <br/>
unworkable), worked in the records office at the university here (no test), <br/>
worked for the SCA being the CEO and overseeing publications and mailings <br/>
(two different jobs, different times, no tests).  But I did take a typing <br/>
test when I was 26.  They asked how fast I could type and I shrugged and said <br/>
&quot;60?&quot;  I had never broken 40 when I was in school, but I knew I had gotten <br/>
faster from typing for fun, words to songs, tests and handouts for school, <br/>
since I never used the textbooks when I taught), doing newsletters for <br/>
clubs...   I tested 90.  I shrugged again.  They found me a job.<br/>

from an ongoing discussion to clear up some confusion is not only not<br/>
frowned upon but encouraged.<br/>
<br/>
What *is* discouraged -- because it makes sense not because it&#39;s some<br/>
arbitrary rule! -- is returning to a past argument to rehash who said what<br/>
and who meant what. If it couldn&#39;t be settled at the time based on fresh<br/>
interpretations of what people were trying to communicate, it certainly<br/>
won&#39;t be settled by returning to it based on *memories* of interpretations<br/>
of what was said.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s some point of unschooling philosophy it&#39;s Truth exists independent<br/>
of how someone expressed themselves in the past and we should approach it<br/>
from a fresh angle to understand it better.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not some point of unschooling philosophy, the argument gets a bit<br/>
tedious to others after a few emails.<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s not clear, please ask and I can try to explain it better.<br/>
<br/>
You may all return to your *unschooling* discussion now. :-)<br/>

&gt; correct that impression?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My impression of what transpired matched what Sandra was saying. Funny thing<br/>
is that over the 8 years that I&#39;ve been reading Sandra¹s writing, every time<br/>
I think she might be remembering wrong and I go back and check, darned if<br/>
she isn&#39;t right. You may interpret my confidence in what she remembers as<br/>
bias. I interpret it as learning from experience.<br/>
<br/>
So, since my impression matched what Sandra was saying, I didn&#39;t check<br/>
before stepping in, but since you&#39;re pursuing this I will check just to make<br/>
sure.<br/>
<br/>
Dee: However, every job gives you a test, you need to take test in college,<br/>
you have to take a driving test, how do you prepare your child for test<br/>
taking if you are not giving them the &quot;formal education&quot; that everyone says<br/>
children need?<br/>
<br/>
Kate: I&#39;ve missed the genesis and evolution of this thread (pun intended). I<br/>
am not clear how it is that anyone thinks that all jobs do not &quot;test&quot; the<br/>
job-holder.<br/>
<br/>
[Me: Not meaning to insult Kate since she was merely being honest in<br/>
admitting having missed the beginning of the thread. It¹s just to show that<br/>
there was at least one person who said she hadn&#39;t read everything.]<br/>
<br/>
Bridget: Just because it isn&#39;t a paper and pencil quiz, doesn;t mean it<br/>
isn&#39;t a test.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra: The original question was about giving paper and pencil tests to<br/>
kids to prepare for all those &lt;exaggerated amount of&gt; required paper and<br/>
pencil tests which will &lt;not&gt; barrage people in life.<br/>
<br/>
[Me: one might argue that Dee did not say &quot;pencil and paper tests&quot; but the<br/>
examples she gave: &quot;you need to take test in college, you have to take a<br/>
driving test, how do you prepare your child for test taking if you are not<br/>
giving them the &quot;formal education&quot; that everyone says children need?&quot; are<br/>
indeed formal, pencil and paper types of tests.]<br/>
<br/>
Bridget: And like I said before, I&#39;ve had to take actual paper and pencil<br/>
tests as part of job apps.  So has Rachel.  There are employers out there<br/>
like that and unless you are independently wealthy or win the lottery, you<br/>
might have to take one to get a job.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra: The question is not whether there were some.  The question was<br/>
whether EVERY job required it.  They do not.  I think most do not.  If some<br/>
do, then the original statement was still in error.<br/>
<br/>
Bridget: I never read anyone who said that EVERY job required it ...<br/>
<br/>
[Me: If you never read anyone who said ³every job², when ³every job² was not<br/>
only in the original post but in the quotes of *4* posts that came before<br/>
you said you ³never read², then is it a great leap to conclude ³Then you&#39;re<br/>
the second person in this thread to admit not having read it all?²]<br/>
<br/>
Bridget (cont.): I never read anyone who said that EVERY job required it<br/>
only that it might be a good thing to at least be aware of and maybe<br/>
prepared to face because some jobs require it.<br/>
<br/>
[Me: What you say above doesn&#39;t match *anything* -- even *paraphrased* --<br/>
that anyone said previously. If you want to check the entire thread from<br/>
Dee&#39;s question up to the point of my moderation it is down below my<br/>
signature.]<br/>
<br/>
Sandra: Then you&#39;re the second person in this thread to admit not having<br/>
read it all. PLEASE, to everyone involved, if you&#39;re skimming or just<br/>
reading every third post, try to refrain from insulting or correcting the<br/>
commentary of those who ARE reading carefully.<br/>
<br/>
Dee: Well, not every...sorry! But some.<br/>
<br/>
[Me: By this Dee is apparently realizing from the answers that she didn¹t<br/>
ask the question she really want to. But to be fair to anyone who answered<br/>
after this, Dee didn¹t include any quotes or anything so in the midst of 3<br/>
or 4 simultaneous conversations it wasn¹t really clear what these two<br/>
sentences were referring to.]<br/>
<br/>
Bridget: I NEVER said any such thing.  In fact, in the 20 or so hours<br/>
between the post you cite and this post the conversation about testing had<br/>
included several posts and at the point I wrote mine, NO ONE was claiming<br/>
that every job required a pen and paper test.  In fact, the poster of the<br/>
one you cite below has since explained that based on HER observation it<br/>
would appear that not all but most jobs require written tests.<br/>
<br/>
[Me: 3 sentences and 3 or 4 factual errors: 1) You did not say you did not<br/>
read in so many words, but your actions certainly lead to that conclusion.<br/>
2) The 5 posts including the ³every job² phrase were in the 20 hour period<br/>
you mention. 3) You will notice Dee did not say ³most². She said ³some.² 4)<br/>
And to call Dee¹s 2 short sentences an explanation based on her observation<br/>
is stretching the truth real close to the breaking point.]<br/>
<br/>
Bridget: I read every post.<br/>
<br/>
[Me: Previous to compiling this, I was giving you the benefit of the doubt<br/>
that you may have read the first post a bit too quickly and missed the<br/>
³every job² bit. But now that I¹ve laid out everything nice and neat and<br/>
since the ³every job² part was quoted 4 times, and then your memory and<br/>
summarization of what was said previously is *incredibly* faulty, my powers<br/>
of belief don¹t stretch quite that far. If you really are reading every post<br/>
my suggestion would be to no longer rely on your memory of what was said and<br/>
to go back and reread what was actually written before telling someone else<br/>
their memory is at fault. I would also suggest including direct quotes<br/>
since, at very the least, based on this and numerous past posts, *my*<br/>
confidence in your memory and abilities to accurately paraphrase is now<br/>
nil.]<br/>
<br/>
Bridget: And I was under the impression that the moderators were frowning<br/>
upon the concept of pulling an old post out of context like you did here.<br/>
<br/>
[Me: Since I¹ve patiently explained to you the reasoning behind the ³no<br/>
bringing up old posts² suggestion *at least* twice which was *after* one of<br/>
the previous moderators explained it *at least* once, to have this garbled<br/>
version of it posted to the list is really trying my patience.]<br/>
<br/>
So once again, Sandra is right.<br/>
<br/>
(Damn she¹s good.)<br/>

&gt; A young woman I know wanted to go to the community college when she was 16.<br/>
&gt; Having been unschooled and having no diploma, they wanted her to take an<br/>
&gt; English placement exam which involved writing an essay.  She had never taken a<br/>
&gt; test in her life, nor written an essay.  After writing several essays and<br/>
&gt; getting them critiqued by an English teacher, she got 96%.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If they want to do the thing they have to take the test for, they can learn<br/>
&gt; how to take tests.  It&#39;s a skill that can be learned any time.  In fact I<br/>
&gt; learned more about test-taking from my grade 7 art teacher than anywhere else.<br/>
&gt; She taught us lots of little hints like: Look over the whole test first.  See<br/>
&gt; where the harder and easier parts are. Do all the easier questions first, then<br/>
&gt; do the harder ones. Unless you&#39;re actually penalized more for a wrong answer,<br/>
&gt; guess the ones you don&#39;t know. Leave time to proofread but don&#39;t change an<br/>
&gt; answer unless you&#39;re sure it&#39;s wrong.  Your first answer was probably right.<br/>
&gt; There were probably more, but I can&#39;t think of them just now. Tia<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am not clear how it is that anyone thinks that all jobs do not &quot;test&quot; the<br/>
&gt; job-holder.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In a sense, I believe that unschooling can be analogized to the omnipresent<br/>
&gt; testing of every real person in the real world, whether it be in the context<br/>
&gt; of employment, parenthood, relationships, Monopoly, or otherwise.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If people did not, in general, somewhat innately and somewhat learnedly,<br/>
&gt; respond to the &quot;tests&quot; presented by circumstance, then we would not, as a<br/>
&gt; society, thrive, progress, and/or exist.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Our desire to strive to address and resolve these &quot;tests&quot; is, to me, the<br/>
&gt; essence of unschooling.  Particularly, of course, when the &quot;tests&quot; are those<br/>
&gt; of wanting to know that which is unknown, or to learn that which is not yet<br/>
&gt; learned.<br/>

&gt;&gt; you are not giving them the &quot;formal education&quot; that everyone says children<br/>
&gt;&gt; need?<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the harder parts of getting unschooling is seeing how the world is<br/>
&gt; contained in the world, so to speak ;-) When things get pulled out and treated<br/>
&gt; as artificial, we get the feeling they are artificial. But they aren&#39;t. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; only the artificial reproduction of them in schools that doesn&#39;t exist in real<br/>
&gt; life.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Before you asked for ideas on helping a child learn the sounds of the<br/>
&gt; alphabet. But if you look at your older kids, was grasping that so difficult<br/>
&gt; for them? The sounds *are* there in real life. If they weren&#39;t, then why would<br/>
&gt; we learn them (formally or informally). It&#39;s useful to walk so kids walk. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; useful to talk so kids talk. The sounds the letters make are useful for<br/>
&gt; figuring out what the on screen commands in a video game mean (among loads of<br/>
&gt; other things!) so kids figure them out. ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As people said, tests are a part of life. Our mouths will pass or fail us on<br/>
&gt; how well we&#39;ve read directions or a recipe. ;-) Tests are also part of real<br/>
&gt; games people do just for fun. Video games, logic games, crossword puzzles,<br/>
&gt; computer games, personality quizzes and so on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the one lesson about tests that kids don&#39;t need is that their entire<br/>
&gt; future is riding on how well they do. That&#39;s a way too prominent message in<br/>
&gt; school and kids are having tests thrown at them every which way. If your kids<br/>
&gt; want to take the SATs and know there&#39;s books and software and classes to<br/>
&gt; familiarize them with the style if they feel it&#39;s necessary and they know they<br/>
&gt; can take it as many times as they want (as far as I know!), then it&#39;s not a<br/>
&gt; big deal. (petersons.com, ets.org and collegeboard.com all have free practice<br/>
&gt; tests.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, there&#39;s a lot of information about unschooling and getting into college<br/>

&gt; Well by that definition, finding out about the job is a test, filling out an<br/>

&gt; The question is not whether there were some.  The question was whether EVERY<br/>

&gt; Not all dogs have four legs, some have three. Saying &quot;All dogs will have three<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve had to take one. ONE - I&#39;m fifty years old and I&#39;ve worked full or part<br/>

&gt; taking the test (everybody applying for ANY civil service job took the same<br/>
&gt; test at the same time, once a year). It was a basic literacy test and it<br/>

&gt; official city business. A sign on the gate says &#39;Beware of Dog.&#39; You should:<br/>
&gt; a) open the gate and run in as fast as you can and hope the dog doesn&#39;t see<br/>

&gt; I haven&#39;t had as many jobs as some people here, but two in college (no test),<br/>
&gt; one at Dunkin Donuts (no test), El Paragua restaurant (not test), taught in a<br/>
&gt; public school (no test, but I had taken a spelling test required before<br/>
&gt; certification--the other tests had been abandoned one by one as unfair or<br/>
&gt; unworkable), worked in the records office at the university here (no test),<br/>
&gt; worked for the SCA being the CEO and overseeing publications and mailings (two<br/>
&gt; different jobs, different times, no tests).  But I did take a typing test when<br/>
&gt; I was 26.  They asked how fast I could type and I shrugged and said &quot;60?&quot;  I<br/>
&gt; had never broken 40 when I was in school, but I knew I had gotten faster from<br/>
&gt; typing for fun, words to songs, tests and handouts for school, since I never<br/>
&gt; used the textbooks when I taught), doing newsletters for clubs...   I tested<br/>
&gt; 90.  I shrugged again.  They found me a job.<br/>

&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; The moderator (of which I am the one and only) encourages clarity. Quoting<br/>
&gt; from an ongoing discussion to clear up some confusion is not only not frowned<br/>
&gt; upon but encouraged.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What *is* discouraged -- because it makes sense not because it&#39;s some<br/>
&gt; arbitrary rule! -- is returning to a past argument to rehash who said what and<br/>
&gt; who meant what. If it couldn&#39;t be settled at the time based on fresh<br/>
&gt; interpretations of what people were trying to communicate, it certainly won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; be settled by returning to it based on *memories* of interpretations of what<br/>
&gt; was said.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If it&#39;s some point of unschooling philosophy it&#39;s Truth exists independent of<br/>
&gt; how someone expressed themselves in the past and we should approach it from a<br/>
&gt; fresh angle to understand it better.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If it&#39;s not some point of unschooling philosophy, the argument gets a bit<br/>
&gt; tedious to others after a few emails.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If that&#39;s not clear, please ask and I can try to explain it better.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You may all return to your *unschooling* discussion now. :-)<br/>

clarity, honesty and accuracy are important.<br/>

Let&#39;s strive for clarity here so those who are new to the list are not<br/>
misled. Yes, the list is moderated. (Obviously.) But there is *no one* on<br/>
moderated status (as in needing their posts to be approved before they are<br/>
released to the list.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If anyone has a complaint with the moderation or with the way the list is<br/>
run, please email me privately so the list isn&#39;t disrupted. It would be a<br/>
good idea to keep a copy of all correspondence so if I can&#39;t resolve it you<br/>
can have a full copy of what was discussed and continue it with Helen<br/>

  I&#39;m a little tired of this line of discussion and had made up my mind to delete any further comments without even reading them when I started to read this one.  BUT this particular statement from the MODERATOR surprised and shocked me.  For someone who is supposedly trying to *keep the peace* (so to speak)on this list, which I&#39;m sure at times is trying to say the least, this statement seemed to be trying to stir up unrest(and I&#39;m sure it was a success).  Sandra may always be RIGHT, as you said, but Sandra is also downright RUDE in her comments sometimes.  Nomatter how RIGHT someone is, that is hard to digest.  Especially when it seems the moderator supports and encourages her. <br/>

  &gt;&gt; <br/>
  &gt; A young woman I know wanted to go to the community college when she was 16.<br/>
  &gt; Having been unschooled and having no diploma, they wanted her to take an<br/>
  &gt; English placement exam which involved writing an essay.  She had never taken a<br/>
  &gt; test in her life, nor written an essay.  After writing several essays and<br/>
  &gt; getting them critiqued by an English teacher, she got 96%.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; If they want to do the thing they have to take the test for, they can learn<br/>
  &gt; how to take tests.  It&#39;s a skill that can be learned any time.  In fact I<br/>
  &gt; learned more about test-taking from my grade 7 art teacher than anywhere else.<br/>
  &gt; She taught us lots of little hints like: Look over the whole test first.  See<br/>
  &gt; where the harder and easier parts are. Do all the easier questions first, then<br/>
  &gt; do the harder ones. Unless you&#39;re actually penalized more for a wrong answer,<br/>
  &gt; guess the ones you don&#39;t know. Leave time to proofread but don&#39;t change an<br/>
  &gt; answer unless you&#39;re sure it&#39;s wrong.  Your first answer was probably right.<br/>
  &gt; There were probably more, but I can&#39;t think of them just now. Tia<br/>

  &gt; I&#39;ve missed the genesis and evolution of this thread (pun intended).<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I am not clear how it is that anyone thinks that all jobs do not &quot;test&quot; the<br/>
  &gt; job-holder.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; In a sense, I believe that unschooling can be analogized to the omnipresent<br/>
  &gt; testing of every real person in the real world, whether it be in the context<br/>
  &gt; of employment, parenthood, relationships, Monopoly, or otherwise.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; If people did not, in general, somewhat innately and somewhat learnedly,<br/>
  &gt; respond to the &quot;tests&quot; presented by circumstance, then we would not, as a<br/>
  &gt; society, thrive, progress, and/or exist.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Our desire to strive to address and resolve these &quot;tests&quot; is, to me, the<br/>
  &gt; essence of unschooling.  Particularly, of course, when the &quot;tests&quot; are those<br/>
  &gt; of wanting to know that which is unknown, or to learn that which is not yet<br/>
  &gt; learned.<br/>

  &gt; The library here gives a test on the book classification system to all of it&#39;s<br/>

  &gt; But even a job for which there is no paper test to get the job has one big<br/>

  &gt;&gt; you are not giving them the &quot;formal education&quot; that everyone says children<br/>
  &gt;&gt; need?<br/>
  &gt;&gt; <br/>
  &gt; One of the harder parts of getting unschooling is seeing how the world is<br/>
  &gt; contained in the world, so to speak ;-) When things get pulled out and treated<br/>
  &gt; as artificial, we get the feeling they are artificial. But they aren&#39;t. It&#39;s<br/>
  &gt; only the artificial reproduction of them in schools that doesn&#39;t exist in real<br/>
  &gt; life.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Before you asked for ideas on helping a child learn the sounds of the<br/>
  &gt; alphabet. But if you look at your older kids, was grasping that so difficult<br/>
  &gt; for them? The sounds *are* there in real life. If they weren&#39;t, then why would<br/>
  &gt; we learn them (formally or informally). It&#39;s useful to walk so kids walk. It&#39;s<br/>
  &gt; useful to talk so kids talk. The sounds the letters make are useful for<br/>
  &gt; figuring out what the on screen commands in a video game mean (among loads of<br/>
  &gt; other things!) so kids figure them out. ;-)<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; As people said, tests are a part of life. Our mouths will pass or fail us on<br/>
  &gt; how well we&#39;ve read directions or a recipe. ;-) Tests are also part of real<br/>
  &gt; games people do just for fun. Video games, logic games, crossword puzzles,<br/>
  &gt; computer games, personality quizzes and so on.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I think the one lesson about tests that kids don&#39;t need is that their entire<br/>
  &gt; future is riding on how well they do. That&#39;s a way too prominent message in<br/>
  &gt; school and kids are having tests thrown at them every which way. If your kids<br/>
  &gt; want to take the SATs and know there&#39;s books and software and classes to<br/>
  &gt; familiarize them with the style if they feel it&#39;s necessary and they know they<br/>
  &gt; can take it as many times as they want (as far as I know!), then it&#39;s not a<br/>
  &gt; big deal. (petersons.com, ets.org and collegeboard.com all have free practice<br/>
  &gt; tests.)<br/>
  &gt; <br/>

  &gt;&gt; you might have to take one to get a job.<br/>
  &gt;&gt; <br/>
  &gt; I&#39;ve had to take one. ONE - I&#39;m fifty years old and I&#39;ve worked full or part<br/>
  &gt; time since I was 15 at many more jobs than I could ever list. I took a written<br/>
  &gt; test one time - to apply for a civil service job as a telephone switchboard<br/>
  &gt; operator for the city. I was 18 and I scored 3rd out of over 2,000 people<br/>
  &gt; taking the test (everybody applying for ANY civil service job took the same<br/>
  &gt; test at the same time, once a year). It was a basic literacy test and it<br/>
  &gt; included situational things like: You need to enter someone&#39;s backyard on<br/>
  &gt; official city business. A sign on the gate says &#39;Beware of Dog.&#39; You should:<br/>
  &gt; a) open the gate and run in as fast as you can and hope the dog doesn&#39;t see<br/>
  &gt; you, b) open the gate and call the dog to see if it is friendly, c) go to the<br/>
  &gt; front door and ask the owners to control the dog before you enter, and d) skip<br/>
  &gt; that house and go on to the next one.<br/>

  &gt; Yesterday, Thursday, here:    &quot; every job gives you a test&quot;<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; In context:<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &lt;&lt;Great ideas. I will be saving this one to my favorites folder.<br/>
  &gt; Question...this self directed learning....sounds wonderful and I am loving it.<br/>
  &gt; As I read the posts on the board I can see how this would work for my family<br/>
  &gt; and for myself. However, every job gives you a test, you need to take test in<br/>
  &gt; college, you have to take a driving test, how do you prepare your child for<br/>
  &gt; test taking if you are not giving them the &quot;formal education&quot; that everyone<br/>
  &gt; says children need? Did I explain that right? I hope so!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; It&#39;s not metaphysical, it&#39;s not philosphical, it&#39;s not metaphorical, it&#39;s just<br/>
  &gt; about plain old tests.  And it says &quot;every.&quot;  And it is not true.<br/>

  &gt; Was there no extra credit for write-in answers?   What if you were a dog<br/>
  &gt; hypnotist, or what if you could develop a safe an inexpensive<br/>
  &gt; dog-tranquilizing mist?<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I&#39;d go to the front door, but my second answer would be skip it.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I haven&#39;t had as many jobs as some people here, but two in college (no test),<br/>
  &gt; one at Dunkin Donuts (no test), El Paragua restaurant (not test), taught in a<br/>
  &gt; public school (no test, but I had taken a spelling test required before<br/>
  &gt; certification--the other tests had been abandoned one by one as unfair or<br/>
  &gt; unworkable), worked in the records office at the university here (no test),<br/>
  &gt; worked for the SCA being the CEO and overseeing publications and mailings (two<br/>
  &gt; different jobs, different times, no tests).  But I did take a typing test when<br/>
  &gt; I was 26.  They asked how fast I could type and I shrugged and said &quot;60?&quot;  I<br/>
  &gt; had never broken 40 when I was in school, but I knew I had gotten faster from<br/>
  &gt; typing for fun, words to songs, tests and handouts for school, since I never<br/>
  &gt; used the textbooks when I taught), doing newsletters for clubs...   I tested<br/>
  &gt; 90.  I shrugged again.  They found me a job.<br/>

  &gt; I NEVER said any such thing.  In fact, in the 20 or so hours between the post<br/>
  &gt; you cite and this post the conversation about testing had included several<br/>
  &gt; posts and at the point I wrote mine, NO ONE was claiming that every job<br/>
  &gt; required a pen and paper test.  In fact, the poster of the one you cite below<br/>
  &gt; has since explained that based on HER observation it would appear that not all<br/>
  &gt; but most jobs require written tests.<br/>

  &gt; I read every post.  And I was under the impression that the moderators were<br/>

  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Okey dokey. This can stop now. It&#39;s not helping anyone understand unschooling<br/>
  &gt; any better.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;&gt; And I was under the impression that the moderators were frowning upon the<br/>
  &gt;&gt; concept of pulling an old post out of context like you did here.<br/>
  &gt;&gt; <br/>
  &gt; The moderator (of which I am the one and only) encourages clarity. Quoting<br/>
  &gt; from an ongoing discussion to clear up some confusion is not only not frowned<br/>
  &gt; upon but encouraged.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; What *is* discouraged -- because it makes sense not because it&#39;s some<br/>
  &gt; arbitrary rule! -- is returning to a past argument to rehash who said what and<br/>
  &gt; who meant what. If it couldn&#39;t be settled at the time based on fresh<br/>
  &gt; interpretations of what people were trying to communicate, it certainly won&#39;t<br/>
  &gt; be settled by returning to it based on *memories* of interpretations of what<br/>
  &gt; was said.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; If it&#39;s some point of unschooling philosophy it&#39;s Truth exists independent of<br/>
  &gt; how someone expressed themselves in the past and we should approach it from a<br/>
  &gt; fresh angle to understand it better.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; If it&#39;s not some point of unschooling philosophy, the argument gets a bit<br/>
  &gt; tedious to others after a few emails.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; If that&#39;s not clear, please ask and I can try to explain it better.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; You may all return to your *unschooling* discussion now. :-)<br/>
