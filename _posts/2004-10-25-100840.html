&gt; Hello. I came across your web site while researching homeschooled <br/>
&gt; families.<br/>
&gt; We&#39;re casting a TV show for ABC that acts as a cultural exchange for<br/>
&gt; American families. The show takes American families and sends them to <br/>
&gt; remote<br/>
&gt; destinations around the world to live with a local, host family. These<br/>
&gt; families live together for about 10 days and learn from each other<br/>
&gt; throughout that time. I was hoping that you might know of some <br/>
&gt; families who<br/>
&gt; might be interested in the opportunity. Attached (and embedded below) <br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; some details on the show. Please let me know if you have any <br/>
&gt; questions. I<br/>
&gt; can be reached at (212) 780-6002. Thank you in advance for you help!<br/>

&gt; IS YOUR FAMILY IN DESPERATE NEED OF A CHANGE?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In a Rut?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does your family&#39;s hectic lifestyle make you feel more like strangers <br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; family?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If so, take an all-expense paid journey of a lifetime - leave where <br/>
&gt; you are<br/>
&gt; to find who you are, as a family.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We are looking for families willing to travel to a remote, foreign <br/>
&gt; location<br/>
&gt; for two weeks. Forget the creature comforts of your home and prepare to<br/>
&gt; embrace each other and another way of life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If your family is outgoing with lots of personality and ready for an<br/>
&gt; adventure, then you must also meet the following criteria:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Have children (ages ranging from 9 to 18) who are able to travel.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. Be available to travel for two weeks in November.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. Be in good overall health and have health insurance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. Little to no travel outside the United States<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5. Have a sense of adventure and a great personality.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In a home video no more than 20 minutes long tell us why we should <br/>
&gt; choose<br/>
&gt; your family?  Have some fun and take us on a tour of your lives. Show <br/>
&gt; us<br/>
&gt; your personality. Go to www.trueentertainment.net/adventure for <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-613219774">I&#39;ve seen a couple of these shows here in Australia. They were eye opening<br/>
to say the least. Along the lines of Trading Spouses in terms of viewing<br/>
family dynamics. One show had a family live with an African family for 10<br/>
days. This family was a real mess; words fail me! The African family was so<br/>
amazing. Full of joy and trust in one another.  The younger American boy<br/>
was so angry, always yelling at his parents and having tantrums. He became<br/>
so attached to the African father. They would go for long walks together and<br/>
when this little boy was sad and angry this huge but gentle man would sit by<br/>
him and soothe him with kind words and a back rub. The little guy would just<br/>
melt and you could see all the anger and tension dissipate. It was beautiful<br/>
to watch. But sad too because you knew he was going home with his inept<br/>
parents who didn&#39;t appear to have learned much at all from the experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-859262259">I&#39;ve seen a show that sounds like this that airs on the National <br/>
Geographic channel called &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;. If it really is an ABC show <br/>
they usually put their reality show auditions on their website. The <br/>
episodes of &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; I watched were really interesting and eye-<br/>
opening...I think it could be an amazing experience.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My sister and I were talking about that little boy just yesterday! <br/>
About how wonderful it was that the african father was so in tune <br/>
with him, so accepting and loving and the boy really responded to <br/>
that. <br/>
<br/>
I dont know if it was the same episode or maybe a different one, <br/>
where there were two brothers,the older was the well behaved, <br/>
sensitive type, the younger was more &quot;spirited&quot;, hyper kid...but in <br/>
the jungle HE was the one that did better, he was asked to go on a <br/>
hunt (even though he was the little brother), because he was <br/>
fearless. It made me think of how our society labels our energetic, <br/>
fearless (mostly)boys as being behavior problems, ADHD, etc when they <br/>
just have the unfortunate situation of living in a society that does <br/>
not value their skills. <br/>
<br/>
It sucks that ABC would just revamp the National Geographic show. No <br/>
doubt it won&#39;t be as good. Just like NBC has this new reality show <br/>
about weight loss called The Biggest Loser, when Discovery Health <br/>
channel did the same thing only much better.<br/>
