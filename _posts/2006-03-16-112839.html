<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103409368">Unschooling is becoming known to some families in France because of  <br/>
the work of  Sylvie Martin-Rodriguez (who has been on this list  <br/>
before, as <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eliott2@...">eliott2@...</a>) and<br/>
Catherine Dumonteil Kremer, who does a newsletter.  You can see some  <br/>
of their writings (and some are translations of English articles)  <br/>
here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.webzinemaker.com/louves-online/">http://www.webzinemaker.com/louves-online/</a><br/>

<br/>
Today the listowners received the following request.  I think they  <br/>
could probably handle more than one family responding!  So if you  <br/>
(parents or children either) would like to help some French boys with  <br/>
their English, that would probably be fun for all involved.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Christine,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the mother of two boys, Antoine, ten years old and Mathis, seven  <br/>
years old. My husband, Gontrand, has resigned this year to be more  <br/>
free for homeshooling. Now, we work together at home, and then, since  <br/>
two weeks, we do homeschool !!<br/>
<br/>
We live in the french Alpes. And, we want to travel all together, but  <br/>
before, we would like too improve our english language. Antoine and  <br/>
Mathis are beginners but they enjoy so much to learn english, that  <br/>
they make up stories to remember the vocabulary... and I&#39;m not sure  <br/>
to be good enought to rectify their syntaxe... I think it could be a  <br/>
fantastic experience for all of us to have conversastions with  <br/>
english people...<br/>
<br/>
Antoine and Mathis could send their english texte, and some of you or  <br/>
children if it&#39;s possible, could answer them about what they  <br/>
think ... They could make up stories with english children !<br/>
. . . .<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>
