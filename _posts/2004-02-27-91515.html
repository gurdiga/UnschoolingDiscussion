<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648550296">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I have mentioned before we were thinking about moving north.  I was <br/>
wondering if anyone know much about the flexability of NY <br/>
homeschooling laws, obviously with unschooling in mind?  Also, does <br/>
anyone know of any good homeschool groups in the Syracuse area that <br/>
would be good to contact for more info??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Olga :)</div>

I live in Syracuse, NY.  NY homeschool regs are quite strict, but I have no <br/>
problem unschooling and still following them.  The biggest problem is that <br/>
currently NY requires testing in grades 5, 7, 9, and 10.  You can choose the test <br/>
and administer it at home.  You can also say your child is in a younger grade <br/>
than what their age would suggest to delay testing.  Luckily my kids don&#39;t <br/>
mind the test.  They think it&#39;s fun to *play school* one day a year.  If you had <br/>
a real late reader, this could be a big problem though.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been able to find an unschooling friendly homeschool group in  <br/>
Syracuse, and I&#39;ve been trying to start one, but haven&#39;t been able to find anybody <br/>
interested!  <br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me off list if you&#39;d like more info.<br/>

<br/>
You could read the questions to them.<br/>
It happens with kids in school who can&#39;t for some reason (not usually <br/>
reading, they consider non-reading just a lazy sin) need help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-152433723">Make sure you investigate how individual school districts treat homeschoolers in general before moving to a specific neighborhood.  Some districts are very willing to accept the minimum requirements by state while others are constantly harassing homeschoolers who are not strictly curriculum based and very structured.  There are alternative methods i know of in our area where some students are enrolled in very p/t Sudbury style school and thus don&#39;t have to file paperwork.  I know a few families who use a Maryland based company to file all paperwork for them and when school districts make issues they are directed to the Md company who handles all correspondence with schools protecting you from direct harassment.  <br/>
<br/>
The PASS test was minimally intrusive (at home and leisurely) - however, from my pov it was a drag and i would have much rather not have had to do it...we tried to approach it as a &quot;learning&quot; experience but it became more stressful than not.   Fortunately we don&#39;t have to deal with it again for two more years.<br/>
<br/>
As for unschoolers in NY - some exist within larger homeschooler groups.  So just because a group is not called &quot;unschoolers&quot; don&#39;t assume you won&#39;t bump into those that follow a similar path as your own.   Bottom line - every family does it differently from every other family and we&#39;ve never felt excluded or alienated amongst other homeschoolers in our area because of our &quot;style.&quot;  It&#39;s always a treat when the more structured homeschoolers (usually newbies) find there way into relaxing a bit as a result of witnessing the unschoolers amongst us.<br/>
