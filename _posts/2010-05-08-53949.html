<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011151906">Sandra, <br/>
I&#39;m reading your book. I love it. It&#39;s amazing, it really is. I&#39;m actually only on page 191. By the way I love what you did on page 189/190...LOL. I actually stopped reading and spoke to my son, Wolfgang, about your &quot;contradictions&quot; on that page...and how it *didn&#39;t make sense* you had said those things after saying the other stuff right on that page. I told him I was a little disappointed. <br/>
<br/>
Then I turned the page. And laughed and laughed and laughed. <br/>
<br/>
Anywho, my *real* point of this post is that John Taylor Gatto is relevant. In my opinion...in the same ways that Attachment Parenting and LLL are. Libertarianism is another gateway into unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
If you extend your existing principle of non-force/non-violence unschooling is really the only place you can end up. This is really how *I* came to unschooling. Extending my philosophical principles to all parts of my life and all people. <br/>
<br/>
Philosophically I am 100% Radical Unschooler...reality is I&#39;m still probably only 85-90% there in my actions but I work to change my behaviors to be more compassionate, loving, open, mindful everyday. It is a gradual process. And it started in me with thinking of people as individuals believe it or not Ayn Rand 16 years ago. (and I&#39;m not even a huge fan of hers, totally disagree with her thoughts on altruism and such)<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Kelly<br/>

-=-And it&#39;s good to check when he said what he&#39;s quoted as saying <br/>
because his views on various things have shifted over the years.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But they didn&#39;t shift from direct experience with unschooling <br/>
families, and the original statements weren&#39;t made because of direct <br/>
experience with unschooling, so it didn&#39;t seem like the best thing to <br/>
quote in a radical unschooling forum.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t understand that when questions are asked of other <br/>
unschoolers, the questioner has found a place like RUNning or this <br/>
list *because* they want the input of people with unschooling <br/>
experience. Quoting dubious experts or offering insipid &quot;support&quot; <br/>
aren&#39;t what people come for.<br/>

<br/>
I have a problem with the libertarianism part of this argument.<br/>
<br/>
There is measurable proof that attachment parenting and LLL benefit children<br/>
and mothers, and both support parents in becoming their children&#39;s partners.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto is good to listen to if you are still trying to detach<br/>
from school - he&#39;s been there and can offer some concrete examples of how to<br/>
successfully break away from school, though he&#39;s not an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Libertarianism, though, is a political philosophy about public policy, and<br/>
there are no (that I know of) working examples of libertarian cities,<br/>
states, or nations. And if there were, I&#39;m not sure how they would relate to<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
Working example: <br/>
<br/>
The United States for the first 100 years. (sadly we excluded blacks, native americans and women from being idividuals - but the US Constitution is a near-perfect model of the libertarian government)<br/>
<br/>
==&gt;And if there were, I&#39;m not sure how they would relate to<br/>
unschooling.&lt;==<br/>
<br/>
The following is a quote from Sandra&#39;s book (p. 180: Modeling Joy). <br/>
<br/>
==Attempting to force someone to do something has never led to peace and cooperation. It creates sneakiness and avoidance.==<br/>
<br/>
Now I understand this was not at all meant to be applied to libertarian thought. But from my perspective it *is* libertarian thought. I believe (and it&#39;s clear if you look around the world) we cannot force morality. We cannot force/legislate people to be good people, to make good choices etc. <br/>
<br/>
The core of libertarian philosophy is peace, individualism & non-coercion. If those are not extensions of unschooling philosophy (or the other way round) I don&#39;t know what is. <br/>
<br/>
A couple of links I think are great examples of libertarian philosophy...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-369287336">I&#39;m just going to respond to this topic briefly and then stop, because it<br/>
may be straying too far from how unschooling works in families.<br/>
<br/>
When we started homeschooling a few years ago I noticed that some<br/>
homeschoolers and unschoolers spent a lot of time talking about<br/>
libertarianism. About the same time (I live in New Hampshire) the Free State<br/>
Project was getting publicity - they (the Free Stater&#39;s) were saying that a<br/>
large group of their membership was going to move to NH so they could<br/>
influence the way NH was governed. I don&#39;t know if this ever happened, but I<br/>
suspect not. I haven&#39;t heard about them in a while.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know anything about libertarianism, so read about it, and also read<br/>
counter-arguments, which is really useful &lt;g&gt;. I found lots of it<br/>
interesting and good (and fun!) to talk about.<br/>
<br/>
That said, argument about the US constitution is often made and is faulty.<br/>
Here&#39;s a link, not to an anti-libertarian site, but to a site that provides<br/>
counter-arguments to common fallacious arguments within libertarianism. It<br/>
addresses the US constitution argument in point number 1.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://world.std.com/~mhuben/faq.html#intent">http://world.std.com/~mhuben/faq.html#intent</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Libertarianism may share some goals with unschooling, but so do many other<br/>
modes of thinking about the world. I&#39;m just not convince that libertarianism<br/>
is, at this time, anything more than a nice political theory that&#39;s fun to<br/>
talk about. I&#39;m one of those show-me people; I like to have real-life<br/>
examples of something working.<br/>
<br/>
But, as Sandra wrote:<br/>
<br/>
===If someone finds unschooling because the book *Chop Wood, Carry Water*<br/>
footnotes John Holt and Growing Without Schooling, that&#39;s good!<br/>
<br/>
If someone then disputes an unschooler&#39;s advice with a quote from Chop<br/>
Wood, Carry Water, and defends that by saying the book supports<br/>

<br/>
Secular humanism.<br/>
<br/>
People will listen confusedly until they think they recognize what  <br/>
we&#39;re talking about, and if they can shout a label, they think they  <br/>
&quot;have the answer&quot;--that they totally understand unschooling.   Often  <br/>
what&#39;s called out is &quot;secular humanism!&quot; and in some thoughts and  <br/>
places (fundamentalist Christians who are a large part of U.S. school- <br/>
at-home families) it&#39;s kind of like calling out &quot;Evil satan- <br/>
worshippers!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I never cared a bit about humanism before.  I had read about it  <br/>
reading about religious history of Europe.  I had heard about it  <br/>
vaguely in psychology classes and the history of ideas about child  <br/>
development.  And sure enough, the idea that a child isn&#39;t born  <br/>
screwed up, but can have screwed-up-edness thrust upon him, is  <br/>
something secular humanists believe.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that unschoolers and secular humanists are equal, or  <br/>
that one came from the other.<br/>
<br/>
Correlation isn&#39;t cause and effect.  Overlapping in a Venn diagram  <br/>
isn&#39;t source or origin.<br/>

are the same thing or logically that one leads to the other.<br/>

Unschoolers know that children thrive when we see the best in them and <br/>
support their strengths<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers may selectively choose what to focus on, true, but that <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean we believe all the Law of Attraction stuff, such as:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So it is with the Law Of Attraction. Whatever thought energy (vibrating <br/>
seed) that you release into the universe, creates and emits a specific <br/>
vibratory pattern or frequency based on the kind and quality of of <br/>
thought, is attracted by and joined with like energy of the same <br/>
harmonious frequency or vibration which vibrates in resonance with it, <br/>
which in turn creates the events, conditions and circumstances that you <br/>
see manifest in your life every single day! &quot;<br/>

<br/>
The ideas about choosing light over darkness and peace over strife are  <br/>
universal and old, but they&#39;re not &quot;the law&quot; of the universe or  <br/>
anything. It&#39;s just something that makes plain, logical sense to  <br/>
anyone who&#39;s paying the least amount of attention to human nature.<br/>
<br/>
In the early 1980&#39;s I was pretty cynical and frustrated with the world  <br/>
and (although I didn&#39;t know it at the time) depressed.  A friend of  <br/>
mine told me kindly but strongly that I was a drain on her energy and  <br/>
she didn&#39;t want to be around me because she wanted her life to be more  <br/>
positive.<br/>
<br/>
Cool.  I was embarrassed, and not to keep her in my life, but just to  <br/>
acknowledge that she was right, I worked to become more positive.   <br/>
Also in the next few years I discovered and utilized Adult Children of  <br/>
Alcoholics, and La Leche League; had kids; got married.   Not in that  <br/>
order.<br/>
<br/>
Twenty years passed, and I can hardly stand to be around that same  <br/>
friend now because she&#39;s so cynical and pessimistic and self- <br/>
centered.  But I don&#39;t tell her so.  I know she knows how to do better  <br/>
when she&#39;s in the mood.   She&#39;s childless, so she&#39;s not ruining anyone  <br/>
else&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
None of that has anything to do with &quot;Law of Attraction,&quot; which is  <br/>
honestly an irritating bunch of bogusosity, but until people get tired  <br/>
of it, there it will be, simultaneously all shiny and new, and all  <br/>
&quot;ancient&quot; and channelled &quot;wisdom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is simply true that until someone stops thinking about &quot;teaching&quot;  <br/>
they can&#39;t stop thinking about it.  Until someone wants to see natural  <br/>
learning, it&#39;s going to be buried in a world of &quot;education&quot; things,  <br/>
opportunities, phrases and expectations.  But you don&#39;t &quot;attract&quot;  <br/>
natural learning.  You learn to see it, and to encourage and nurture it.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s funny. I have a friend who has their religion on facebook as &quot;whatever makes you want to be a better person&quot; --- that is how I feel. Whatever it is that makes you want to be kinder, gentler, more loving, peaceful etc...that&#39;s what I support. <br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t claim to know whether it *is* the law or not. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t subscribe to the concept of *Law of Attraction* but I am thrilled that it works for others. I think it&#39;s beautiful when people make connections and such. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t agree or think that these things *are* law of the universe BUT I also don&#39;t think that I can definitively say they *aren&#39;t* because I don&#39;t know. And I don&#39;t claim to either way. <br/>
<br/>
To me the Law of Attraction component is a religious component.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m agnostic. I don&#39;t have a religious component. I don&#39;t know if there is a god, if there is a higher power, if there isn&#39;t...none of that. I don&#39;t know. Maybe someday I will, who knows. But I don&#39;t claim to know I&#39;m right about Law of Attraction any more than I claim to know about any other religion. Other than if it helps you be a gentler, loving etc person and it gives you reason, validation, purpose in your unschooling...wonderful. <br/>
<br/>
There are also Christian unschooling groups that believe that is *the gateway* etc... again these are spiritual/religious components. <br/>
<br/>
Also in the next few years I discovered and utilized Adult Children of <br/>
Alcoholics, and La Leche League; had kids; got married. Not in that <br/>
order.<br/>
<br/>
++None of that has anything to do with &quot;Law of Attraction,&quot; which is <br/>

<br/>
I understand how things like this are irritating to others. I find some born again Christians to be irritating but I wouldn&#39;t call it bogusosity. I try to look at the positive. I try to see the good. <br/>
<br/>
++It is simply true that until someone stops thinking about &quot;teaching&quot; <br/>
they can&#39;t stop thinking about it. Until someone wants to see natural <br/>

opportunities, phrases and expectations. But you don&#39;t &quot;attract&quot; <br/>
natural learning. You learn to see it, and to encourage and nurture it.++<br/>
<br/>
I agree but I don&#39;t think that makes either one of us right. I think it&#39;s a matter of perspective. I don&#39;t see things in terms of law of attraction...So I&#39;m not going to see it as attraction...I&#39;m going to see it as you described because that is more the perspective I&#39;m coming from. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
+++Cool. I was embarrassed, and not to keep her in my life, but just to <br/>

order.+++<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t involved in La Leche League but I now have many friends who are. Why accepted as an extension of unschooling? Or am I wrong is it not?<br/>
<br/>
I recommended your book to three other people today. I carry it around right now with a highlighter. I think it&#39;s that good. My friend who also unschools her two boys asked me...&quot;Why do you like it so much? Is it full of revelations?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;No, more affirmations.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m already there, in mind, and have been for many years now. It&#39;s the actions that I&#39;m still working on. None of it comes from spiritual/religious anything. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s philosophical, FOR ME. Again...basically stemming from libertarian philosophy (and I don&#39;t mean the Libertarian Political Party - I mean philosophy/principles).<br/>
<br/>
Does any of this make me a better unschooler? Does is make the Law of Attraction people better unschoolers? Does it make the Christian unschoolers better? etc etc... aren&#39;t they all just pieces?<br/>
<br/>
I hope at least some of that made sense...I&#39;m really tired. I hope all of you moms had a great mother&#39;s day. I had the most wonderful day. <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

I was not nearly as rude to her as, in retrospect, I have wished I had been. It&#39;s hard for me to have positive feelings about a philosophy that invites its followers to tell someone in distress that it&#39;s their own fault.<br/>
