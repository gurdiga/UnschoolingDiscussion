&gt; or could it be that Thanksgiving doesn&#39;t usually require as much energy as<br/>
&gt; xmas? (shopping, decorating.. .all that).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well,  in my family...the past 2 Thanksgiving were at my s-i-l&#39;s....and I<br/>
could relate to the not enjoying it because TV was &quot;the star&quot; of the<br/>
day....that is,  garnered  prominent attention.  And at Christmas,   more<br/>
mingling,  story-telling, catching up ....no TV.  And it never seems enough<br/>
time to really &#39;catch up&#39;...so I wouldn&#39;t say the lack of &#39;stories&#39; is part<br/>
of it for our family.</div>
