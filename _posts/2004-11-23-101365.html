<div id="ygrps-yiv-995550650">Hi all,<br/>
I have been homeschooling for the past 9 years (very relaxed) I LOVE what I have read about unschooling, BUT here&#39;s my problem maybe you can all help me get past myself, I can see that my son will and does great unschooling, he has allot of interest in &quot;stuff&quot; My daughter (12) doesn&#39;t have much of an interest in anything...well I will get to that in a minute. She doesn&#39;t care a thing in the world about math (just does very simple adding and subtracting) does not spell good at all and really doesn&#39;t care to read, doesn&#39;t like history...I get myself scared about her , that ,and I am not a good speller and it makes me feel &quot;not very smart&quot; at times. She is dyslexic so I did not push her in these area&#39;s. I guess I get &quot;scared&quot; when other kids her age come around and I see how advanced they are and I feel like I am doing her wrong even though I know how much she hated doing &quot;school&quot;. The one thing she is interested in is making maps...maps of her room maps of our neighborhood, she loves to decorate, and she is very very good at planning parties. Its when I start to make the map making &quot;schoolesh&quot; she turns off, I thought she could learn some math with the map making, you know measuring and such but she just doesn&#39;t care.Please help me to learn to trust that she will be OK. Does anyone else have a child who doesn&#39;t really care about learning much of anything?<br/>
Thanks for all the help,<br/>
Heidi<br/>

  If he can&#39;t feel when he&#39;s full, they really should get him tested to rule<br/>
  out Prader-Willi Syndrome, as Debbie mentioned.  Maybe eating disorder<br/>
  sufferers also have trouble feeling when they&#39;re full, but it is one main<br/>
  symptom of PWS.  While trying to empower him and help him emotionally is<br/>
  wonderful, if it is Prader-Willi Syndrome they need to get it diagnosed so<br/>
  they can begin to manage it.  PWS is a genetic disorder for which there is<br/>
  no cure, but untreated the patient becomes obese and has many other issues.<br/>
  Hopefully his issues are psychological and can be overcome.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What awesome skills!  I hate to decorate, though I&#39;d like to have my house look a bit more as if it were planned rather than everything looking like it was just stuck somewhere.  I&#39;m just not good at it.  Planning parties?  People make a living at planning parties for other people!  And making maps.  Wow!  That is art and math and geography and social studies and much much more.<br/>
<br/>
Let go of what she *should* be doing and celebrate what she does.  That is a lot for a 12 year old.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702890996">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I guess I get &quot;scared&quot; when other kids her age come around and I see how<br/>
advanced they are and I feel like I am doing her wrong even though I know<br/>
how much she hated doing &quot;school&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an idea seems to be a bit of a theme floating through the lists just<br/>
now, or maybe I am just sensitive to it. It&#39;s this notion of how being<br/>
around schooled (or school-at-home) kids can make us feel inadequate, or<br/>
scared as you put it. Sometimes it goes further and makes our kids start to<br/>
doubt themselves and their futures.<br/>
<br/>
There are times when I want to say stay away from them for a while, during<br/>
transitioning to Unschooling, or particularly vulnerable times - like the<br/>
beginning of puberty perhaps. I&#39;m not sure whether this is always feasible<br/>
or desirable - after all Unschoolers usually don&#39;t force our children to<br/>
isolate themselves from their friends. But boy, there are times when it&#39;s<br/>
tempting and might make us feel better.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes feel these pressures myself. Just yesterday at Park Day some of<br/>
the H/S mothers were talking about some history curriculum on DVD, that<br/>
their really young (4,5,6 yo) kids were &quot;really enjoying&quot;. Jayn shows no<br/>
interest in history, except the idea of the magical olden days when<br/>
Princesses lived in castles. I, yes even I, felt a gentle brush of anxiety.<br/>
Which is way better than a deep and painful panicky stab of anxiety as I<br/>
might have felt a couple of years ago.<br/>
<br/>
On occasions when schooled kids seem to be &quot;advanced&quot; it is helpful to focus<br/>
only on our child&#39;s strengths and individuality, and remember that she has a<br/>
whole lifetime to learn whatever she wants to. It isn&#39;t a competition. Maybe<br/>
this is one time when some school bashing is in order ;) - these kids may<br/>
seem &quot;advanced&quot; but how much of it will they recall after the end of year<br/>
tests are done? The schooled kids are being scaled against an average. It is<br/>
helpful to remember that averages are created out of combining every number,<br/>
including the extremes at either end, and while helpful in looking at<br/>
populations, are not useful predictors of individual performance. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it would be reassuring to picture our children as completely outside<br/>
of the &quot;average scale&quot;, to picture them strolling back and forth past the<br/>
line of other &quot;graded&quot; people at will. There is no real reason to assume<br/>
that any of these kids will end up happier, kinder, more confident, or more<br/>
&quot;educated&quot; than any of our sons and daughters. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-602833178">**and she is very very good at planning parties.**<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how much extra money you have for party food and party <br/>
decorations, but it might be fun and educational to have lots more <br/>
parties.  Possibly celebrating holidays from different countries, or <br/>
birthdays of historical figures, or even something more bizarre.  (I&#39;m <br/>
sure there&#39;s more than 2 possibilities, but my brain has run out of steam.)<br/>
<br/>
However, taking her interest and purposely twisting it to be educational <br/>
(as I have suggested) could backfire.  Encouraging her interests can be <br/>
good.  Tricking her into learning history and geography is not so good.<br/>
<br/>

PS  (Before she tried to take over the planet with her multi-media <br/>
empire, Martha Stewart was a caterer.  And her magazine still has a lot <br/>
of party-oriented content.)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807091570">Thanks for all the help you guys!<br/>
I guess I got upset because my daughter came home from riding her bike and said that the kids around the corner said that she was stupid because she was homeschooled and that kids in &quot;real&quot; school learn much much more. That makes me so mad and upset and then I start to think that maybe I am doing her wrong (but for 9 years now I know different)We are new to Florida and she will be starting Scouts and I start to think Gosh what if they want her to read ( she can but really doesn&#39;t like to , it takes her longer cause she is dyslexic), I don&#39;t want her to feel bad about herself, I know in my heart that but the time she has to make her way in the world she will know all she needs but I just have a hard time every now and then with the &quot;rest&quot; of the world. I wish I knew some unschoolers that lived near me, I would for a while just hang with them until I get used to Unschooling in this state and get to know some people. Thanks for being here for me,<br/>
Heidi<br/>
Have a great Thanksgiving all!!<br/>
