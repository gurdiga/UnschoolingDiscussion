<div id="ygrps-yiv-709780292">my son is 4 1/2, and we read for about 1 hour every night.  we started<br/>
reading chapter books about 1 1/2 years ago (winnie the pooh, as well as<br/>
catwings, my father&#39;s dragon, etc, with a bit of editing).  i&#39;ve been<br/>
watching the book recommendations fly by on other homeschooling lists,<br/>
but i thought i&#39;d put out a request here.  i&#39;m looking for good, gentle<br/>
read-aloud chapter books that are nonsexist, nonreligious, and<br/>
nonviolent.  i&#39;m also looking for simple, interesting historical or<br/>
scientific fiction.  any suggestions would be much appreciated. thx.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-892792908">We really liked the Mother Westwind stories by Thornton W. Burgess.  &quot;Old<br/>
Mother West Wind&quot;   &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Skunk&quot;  etc.  I think<br/>
they&#39;re still available at Dover.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a list of some of our favorites, in no particular order. Of course, <br/>
you&#39;ll have to decide for yourself if any of these are sexist, religious or <br/>
violent.<br/>
<br/>
Charlotte&#39;s Web by E.B, White<br/>
Stuart Little  by E.B. White<br/>
Mr. Popper&#39;s Penguins by Richard Atwater<br/>
The Henry Huggins books by Beverly Cleary<br/>
The Ramona books by Beverly Cleary<br/>
The Magic Treehouse series by Mary Pope Osborne<br/>
Flat Stanley by Jeff Brown<br/>
Invisible Stanley by Jeff Brown<br/>
Bunnicula by ? Howe<br/>
Pippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145211403">My kids liked a book called Backyard Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t the highest level of eternal literature, but it was fun.<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter, if you haven&#39;t done that one.<br/>
<br/>
They enjoyed Baby Island.  Perhaps it&#39;s sexist in that it&#39;s a fantasy about <br/>
taking care of babies after a shipwreck (and girls save the day).  But it&#39;s <br/>
fun.  If he&#39;s not interested, it doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s sexist, just that that&#39;s <br/>
not one of his fantasies.  All my kids listened through it, though, boys and <br/>
girl all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389124947">You could try Peter Pan and The Water Babies by J.M. Barrie; The <br/>
Cricket in Times Square by George Selden; Dr. Doolittle; Charlotte&#39;s <br/>
Web and Stuart Little by E.B. White; James and the Giant Peach and <br/>
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl; the Little House on <br/>
the Prairie series by Laura Ingalls Wilder; The Moffats by ?Estelle <br/>
Estes.  We (my 5.5yodd and I) also like books by Marcia Williams - <br/>
The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Iliad and the Odyssey, Tales from <br/>
Shakespeare, and the Asterix and Obelix series by Goscinny and <br/>
Uderzo, all in comic book format and some more historical than <br/>
others, although not always gentle.<br/>
