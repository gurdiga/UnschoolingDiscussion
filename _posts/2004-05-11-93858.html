 </span></blockquote>The following is a list of things we do when we get bored. It is not<br/>
exhaustive nor is it full proof. However, so many of these work that I<br/>
thought I&#39;d throw them out here. (We began years ago by making a list<br/>
that we posted to the refrigerator that could be referenced when<br/>
someone got bored. Just having this list posted saved a lot of<br/>
cloudy-eyed wandering through the house...) This list applies to all<br/>
the ages of our kids ranging between 7-17. We have five children.<br/>
<br/>
1. Find a sibling and play a board game (list of games we own)<br/>
2. Jump on the trampoline<br/>
3. Kick the soccer ball<br/>
4. Make a tent out of sheets in the living room and eat snacks under it<br/>
5. Call a friend on the phone to chat or to come play<br/>
6. Dress up and pretend<br/>
7. Play drama games (we have a book of these and we are theater hounds)<br/>
8. Make tea and muffins, invite others to join you. Set table and light<br/>
candles.<br/>
9. Cut flowers, make a bouquet<br/>
10. Bake clay creations using sculpey clay (I try to buy a fresh set of<br/>
colors every few months)<br/>
11. Use mom&#39;s binoculars to watch birds.<br/>
12. Cut paper and glue it.<br/>
13. Use the Prismacolors to draw (refer to &quot;how to draw&quot; books on book<br/>
shelves)<br/>
14. Draw with sidewalk chalk<br/>
15. Play in the creek<br/>
16. Play the piano or saxophone or guitar<br/>
17. Go online and play a game on the Internet, or X Box Live<br/>
18. Pop popcorn; watch a movie<br/>
19. Start a fire (winter, in the fireplace. Summer; in the outdoor<br/>
fireplace) roast hotdogs or marshmellows.<br/>
20. Make popsicles.<br/>
21. Read a book<br/>
22. Memorize a poem<br/>
23. Write a poem<br/>
24. Choreograph a dance in the living room<br/>
25. Write on your bedroom walls things you want to remember - song<br/>
lyrics, friend&#39;s names, funny jokes<br/>
26. Keep a scrapbook<br/>
27. Take some pictures<br/>
28. Make origami<br/>
29. Make and hang Chinese lanterns from a string across the kitchen<br/>
30. Play croquet or badminton<br/>
31. Bake cookies<br/>
32. Write a letter or email<br/>
33. Have a water fight<br/>
34. Rearrange your bedroom furniture<br/>
35. Plant seeds or flowers<br/>
36. Write your own myth or legend after reading the Greek myths<br/>
37. Clean out your wardrobe to make space for new clothes<br/>
38. Sit in a tree and whistle<br/>
39. Take a walk with a bottle of water<br/>
40. Create a cozy hiding place (blankets, pillow) and bring your<br/>
headphones/CD player to it. Sit quietly reading or listening or<br/>
snoozing.<br/>
<br/>
That should be enough to get anyone started. :)<br/>
