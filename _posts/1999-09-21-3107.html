<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102678029">The whole thread on late nights and spouses attitudes has definitely rung a<br/>
bell here.  Part of my problem recently has been that I got depressed<br/>
(permanently tired, finding fault) since we moved house.  I&#39;m coming out of<br/>
it now, although there are other factors...  But anyway, to cut a long story<br/>
short, I tend to &#39;hide&#39; when I get that way, and the &#39;puter&#39;s a good way.<br/>
Now, I have offered to have the &#39;puter downstairs so I could<br/>
play/work/chat/whatever while dh watches tv, which is his &#39;thing&#39; but no,<br/>
the typing would drive him crackers and it wouldn&#39;t look right (the<br/>
aesthetics thing&#39;s a whole other ball game, I won&#39;t go there just now!)  But<br/>
we figured it out, and he knows that since we co-sleep, I don&#39;t get space at<br/>
all, so this is my time.  If I want to go watch the late-night rerun of Star<br/>
Trek with him, I do.  If I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t.  We are both late night folks,<br/>
him more than me, but he works from home, so that&#39;s when he works.  I&#39;d get<br/>
up earlier for me-time if dd2 didn&#39;t wake up too, cos that&#39;s not me-time!<br/>
<br/>
Tami, how wierd that he should suddenly change tune like this.  Have you<br/>
read any of the Faber-Mazlish books?  It&#39;s fairly basic psychology, but if<br/>
it works on kids, it ought to work on anyone, right?  Can you find out<br/>
what&#39;s behind this using those kinds of tools?  (particularly instead of<br/>
giving an argument, listening and affirming what he&#39;s telling you?)  After<br/>
19 years, you perhaps think you ought to be able to read him like a book,<br/>
but we all have some hidden secrets - has something happened to dredge<br/>
something up from his own childhood?  I don&#39;t know what else to say, except<br/>
that it does sound awfully like some medical problem, a food allergy<br/>
perhaps, I&#39;m trying to steer clear of the obvious and scary brain tumour -<br/>
oops, I&#39;ve gawn and done it now...<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I&#39;m not alone, you&#39;re not alone, we all seem to have similar<br/>
situations and we all solve them in our own ways, and in our own time, if<br/>
you&#39;ll excuse the pun!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m off to watch that Star Trek episode now!!<br/>

     That is a thought.  (The food allergy maybe----not the brain tumour, I&#39;m <br/>
not ready to go there yet).  Anyway, we are talking and checking the whole <br/>
thing out, so maybe I will know more soon.<br/>

<br/>
The current issue of a woman&#39;s magazine (Woman&#39;s Day, Family Circle?) ran an <br/>
article about medical reasons people might be tired.  And, in addition to the <br/>
possibilities that are always mentioned (like thyroid), they specifically <br/>
mentioned food allergies.  So if the problem isn&#39;t just not getting enough <br/>
sleep, then you might want to grab this article and share it w. your husband.<br/>
<br/>
My husband has been exhausted this month, and we are seriously considering <br/>
giving up dairy products for awhile.  (Milk just seems to inspire us to eat <br/>
cookies!)<br/>

     Even if I could prove to my husband that is was dairy causing his <br/>
problem, he still wouldn&#39;t give it up.  The guy loves his milk!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-732944731">Kim and others,I really liked what you said, but are there any suggestions to get a tired, very hard working hubby to understand the difference between me making it work for us (me doing what you want because you want me too) and us making it work for us (instead of I go to work statement vs. how can contribute to make it work).<br/>
Is this the eternal problem or what?<br/>
Tami-<br/>
I hope you can find a solution, it sounds pretty stressful!� I know what you mean about differences that seem to grow.� Dh and I just had one of those debates that there are no winners of, I have learned to ignore the differences that didn&#39;t seem to be there 15 years ago, but some of them just loom so LARGE at times.� Good luck to you.<br/>

&gt; week...that is probably enough for him�.� I do enjoy talking with him and�<br/>
&gt; spending time with him.� I am sure we can commit to carving out a notch of�<br/>
&gt; time everyday while I am preparing dinner or something like that.� If we are�<br/>

      I haven&#39;t tried goats milk.  I did buy some rice milk (Rice Dream).  It <br/>
didn&#39;t matter what flavor (regular, chocolate, or vanilla) my family hated <br/>
it.  Now I just buy it for me, and I let them go back to drinking their milk <br/>
&lt;grrrrr&gt;.  Maybe if I tried sneaking goats milk into the regular containers <br/>
like you suggested, they would actually like it!  :)  Its worth a try!<br/>

small amounts at first, and gradually got bigger, until the gallon was all <br/>
