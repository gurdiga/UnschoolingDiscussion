<div id="ygrps-yiv-238733662">-=-=-=-Unschooling isn&#39;t just learning without being taught.<br/>
Unschooling is  learning without being taught *full time*.<br/>
<br/>
------------------<br/>
Unschooling is learning fulltime without being taught.<br/>
<br/>
I want to suggest that clarification because if our definition is being  nit-picked, I don&#39;t want someone to say &quot;I&#39;m not teaching full time, just part  time, so I&#39;m unschooling; Joyce said so.&quot;-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Oh, hell! And *I* want to clarify further to say that teaching *can* take place in unschooling...BUT, if the learner has no interest, then learning isn&#39;t happening. OR the lesson being learned isn&#39;t necessarily the lesson being taught! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want someone to say, &quot;He CAN&#39;T take piano lessons because he CAN&#39;T be taught. That&#39;s not unschooling; Sandra said so!&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Teaching *can* happen in unschooling---but NOT without the learning that would accompany it. <br/>
<br/>
Teaching for teaching&#39;s sake is NOT unschooling.<br/>

Learning can happen.  Sometimes there&#39;s a teacher. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
If that teacher is the mom, and the mom is giddily proud of it and the  child <br/>
feels the mom teacher is his source of learning, unschooling is on  slippery <br/>
ground.<br/>

Unschooling is a lifestyle of learning that is not governed by a structured school system or <br/>

I like that.  I thought of something else, too, that I&#39;ve never  considered <br/>
before.   Taking guitar lessons isn&#39;t a kid thing.   It&#39;s a human thing.  <br/>
Adults take guitar lessons.  So if someone takes  guitar lessons of his own <br/>
freewill, he&#39;s doing something that he could do at any  age.  Not so, third grade.  <br/>
Not so, t-ball.   Aikido or  dressage or Spanish lessons--also things people <br/>
take any age.   That  makes it a real-world thing, rather than a school- or <br/>
kid-thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Teaching happens often within unschooling. Whether it&#39;s a parent teaching a<br/>
child a skill or music lessons or siblings teaching each other things. It&#39;s<br/>
not the resulting learning that makes it &quot;acceptable&quot; it&#39;s the fact that the<br/>
child asked for it. For example, my daughter has asked me to teach her how<br/>
to tie her shoelaces, so I taught her. She lost interest, so I stopped<br/>
teaching her. She didn&#39;t learn to tie her shoelaces (yet).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just recently gone back to recieving mail from this list after a long<br/>
time on nomail. Too busy, travelling etc. I&#39;m glad to be back and really<br/>
enjoying the discussions. I think the volume of posts has gone down too, so<br/>
I might be able to keep up!<br/>

If there is no resulting learning, then what happened?<br/>
If the learning isn&#39;t what makes it &quot;acceptable,&quot; by what measure would it be <br/>
worth anything?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If she didn&#39;t learn it, you didn&#39;t teach it.  You talked and demonstrated and <br/>
whatever all else, but if that&#39;s teaching, and she didn&#39;t learn, it wasn&#39;t a <br/>
good use of energy, was it?<br/>
<br/>
If you think of it as &quot;I showed her&quot; and &quot;I told her a way to remember it&quot; <br/>
that might click inside her at some point, but I wonder that you&#39;d say &quot;I taught <br/>
her&quot; when she still can&#39;t tie her shoes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s tricky.  At school, a teacher can show a pile of papers and get a <br/>
paycheck.<br/>
At home with no paycheck, the question is no longer &quot;did you show up in this <br/>
classroom at the appointed hour and do a song and dance?&quot;  <br/>

My shoelace story was an example of how teaching and learning are not the<br/>
same thing, and that learning does not necessarily follow teaching. It<br/>
wasn&#39;t worth anything. Except maybe the value of my child knowing that if<br/>
she asks me to help her with something, I will try.<br/>

I agree with you on the wording. I read one of your posts about that just<br/>
after I sent mine and thought yes! That&#39;s right. I don&#39;t generally talk<br/>
about teaching. I show, help, tell, whatever, as you say.<br/>
<br/>
However the 1st definition of teach in my dictionary is: To help to learn,<br/>
tell or show.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The point you&#39;re trying to make is valid. Yes, when kids ask it&#39;s okay <br/>
to pass on information!<br/>
<br/>
But the word teach carries a lot more images than just showing. It <br/>
carries lots of school baggage with it. So to someone who is still <br/>
thinking in terms of &quot;learning = school&quot; telling them that teaching is <br/>
okay when kids ask, for them it calls up images of sitting them down at <br/>
a table and doing something schoolishly formal like a page of math <br/>
problems.<br/>
<br/>
One way to help people get unschooling is to help them replace the old <br/>
images of learning they have with new ones.<br/>
<br/>
The word &quot;show&quot; doesn&#39;t have the schoolish baggage that teach does. <br/>
Show doesn&#39;t call up images of textbooks and teachers and classrooms <br/>
the way teach can.<br/>
<br/>
Show and similar words without schoolish baggage help people imagine <br/>
what the process of helping a child with something they&#39;re trying to <br/>
figure out looks like whether they have schoolish baggage or not. But <br/>
teach only helps those without schoolish baggage and sets back the ones <br/>
with schoolish baggage.<br/>
<br/>
So, while you&#39;re right, it&#39;s a lot more helpful to those trying to get <br/>
unschooling to describe unschooling without words that call up school <br/>
images.<br/>
