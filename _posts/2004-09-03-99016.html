<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781927205">Finally we&#39;re home.  We had TONS of fun, but exhausting fun, and we&#39;re glad <br/>
to be home.<br/>
Yesterday when we got home I explored the changes in the yard, watered some <br/>
stuff, and went shopping with Keith so we could tell stories.  I fell asleep <br/>
about 8:00 and woke up at 3:15 with a sore throat, but I DON&#39;T CARE!  I&#39;m <br/>
home.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly is playing with her rats and Marty is playing a video game in his room. <br/>
 They&#39;re up early from being up early for a week on Eastern time.<br/>
<br/>
So for the rest of the day I guess I&#39;ll be answering week-old (and <br/>
increasingly more recent) posts, until I quit to take Marty clothes shopping or to take <br/>
Holly to a D&D game she wants <br/>
<br/>
-=-I think the crafts are more compelling if they are grown-up, <br/>
authentic things. Making a banner is more interesting if you have a <br/>
real herald there showing you what some of the symbols mean, <br/>
accurate color combinations and layouts and such.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Speaking as an unschooler, as a longtime SCA member, and as a Mistress of the <br/>
Laurel (which will mean nothing to most of this list, which is fine), I think <br/>
people shouldn&#39;t have to wait for a real herlad to show them about layouts <br/>
and color combinations, because there are some GREAT heraldry books and webpages <br/>
out there.   Preparations for events like costume making, banners, dishes, <br/>
learning to weave, should ideally all take place away from events and so the <br/>
learning that happens should happen in preparation for going to an event all <br/>
doodied up in period outfits.    <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how I see it as the most unschooling-glorious activity it can be.   <br/>
And for people who are already long &quot;out of school&quot; and have no children, for <br/>
them too the learning should be at home, with friends or alone, at guild <br/>
meetings MAYBE (our group resisted &quot;guild&quot; culture) but for fun.  And if it&#39;s not <br/>
fun, it shouldn&#39;t be done.   And when someone really cares about medieval or <br/>
Renaissance life, all that learning is fun.<br/>
