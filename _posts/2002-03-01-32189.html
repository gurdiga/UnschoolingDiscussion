<div id="ygrps-yiv-360221927">Hi, my name is Sara. I have 3 kids: Jade (b)7, Zoe (g) 4.5 & Savitri (g) 8 <br/>
weeks. We live in West Linn, OR which is on the outskirts of Portland.  I <br/>
value unschooling along with other aspects of natural living (eating raw <br/>
foods, unassisted childbirth, extended breastfeeding, natural healing, etc.) <br/>
  I unschooled until last year when I decided to put Jade in 1st grade.  I <br/>
had been unable to figure out his interests & I could see how bored he was & <br/>
he&#39;s been resentful of his sister since she was born.  So I thought school <br/>
might give him something all his own & feed his outgoing social nature.  I <br/>
hoped we&#39;d see an improvement in his negative behavior. He was behind <br/>
everyone but caught up once he got into the groove. He started by memorizing <br/>
& then it seems like he figured out how to process info in his brain & is <br/>
really loving learning.  But there&#39;s all the negative social/behavioral <br/>
effects of being in school that will only get worse as he goes up in grades. <br/>
His negative behavior hasn&#39;t changed a bit & now he&#39;s added some other <br/>
negative habits as well. He knows I&#39;m not putting him in next year but he&#39;ll <br/>
finish up the year. He seems okay with it. I honestly don&#39;t know how I&#39;ll <br/>
handle him. He doesn&#39;t give me very good cues about his interests. He also <br/>
drains me quickly & he always has. I am already overwhelmed just with my 4yo <br/>
at home with a newborn. The baby doesn&#39;t suck right so I am pumping milk for <br/>
her around the clock. This really limits my ability to go places & to engage <br/>
with the 4yo for any period of time becuase the time in between pumps always <br/>
seems filled with making food, cleaning up, showers, brushing teeth, running <br/>
errands. I make beautiful food & beautiful children but other than that I <br/>
lack creativity & don&#39;t think I&#39;m much fun as a mom. Of course I&#39;ve spent a <br/>
lot of my time as a mom pregnant & peuking (4.5 pregnancies) or exhausted <br/>
from nursing every 3 hours (5+ years). I&#39;m not complaining, but rather just <br/>
trying to put myself out there & see if any of you can relate & how you&#39;ve <br/>
handled it. The other major challenge I should mention is money. It seems <br/>
we&#39;re always just scraping by & borrowing money (pre-spending)just to have <br/>
food in the house.  To offer them more fullness in life I&#39;d like to be able <br/>
to afford books, toys, museums, etc that they&#39;re interested in.  My seasonal <br/>
allergies have really gotten in the way of all the nature things I&#39;d like to <br/>
do also.  I hope I don&#39;t come across as grossly negative, I&#39;m just a tired, <br/>
overwhelmed mama who wants to give them all I can & I&#39;m looking for ideas, <br/>
support, encouragement, etc.  Glad you&#39;re all out there giving this gift to <br/>
your children.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-370037298">Sara J., Hi, I&#39;m Bonni.  I live in Springfield-Eugene area of Oregon.  I<br/>
also am interested in raw foodism, although I seem to do it for seasons<br/>
at a time separated by times of eating cooked foods.  I first was turned<br/>
on to it a couple of years ago.  I have four kids, and it&#39;s been a while<br/>
since I had them as young as yours, but I can relate to your feelings.  I<br/>
hope you will see that you are a good mom and it is okay to be tired and<br/>
discouraged now and then throughout motherhood.  As for boredom, since<br/>
starting to unschool all my kids, which is only this last year, when they<br/>
get bored and come to me to entertain them, my &quot;mantra&quot; is &quot;boredom. is.<br/>
the soil.  in which.  imagination.  grows.&quot;  And since I&#39;ve not been<br/>
feeling so obligated to entertain them, they have learned to use their<br/>
minds to find their own interests.  Now occasionally, my seven y.o.<br/>
daughter comes to me and says, &quot;You&#39;re right mom, when I am bored my mind<br/>
starts thinking about things.&quot;  It&#39;s my job to offer them things and<br/>
their job to decide what to pursue or not.  Then, it&#39;s my job to listen<br/>
and  not hinder them from pursuing their interests.  Surely your son has<br/>
some interests.  What did he do when he was at home?  What does he do now<br/>
in his spare time?  That is his interest.  A good book I am recommending<br/>
right now is How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will<br/>
Talk.  I don&#39;t know the author.  But I got it at the local library and<br/>
took notes.  It&#39;s really made my job as a mom easier and has improved my<br/>
relationship with my children, and even with my husband(big kid).  To<br/>
keep your son from draining you, you might consider how much and at what<br/>
times you want to devote just to him.  Then he won&#39;t expect your<br/>
attention at times when you need to give it to baby or to resting, but<br/>
will be secure knowing certain times are just for him.  Anyhow,  it<br/>
sounds like you are a bit overwhelmed with finances and children.  I have<br/>
been there before and still am at times.  Sometimes it helps me to sit<br/>
down and pray the serenity prayer and make a list of what I can change<br/>
and what I cannot change.  Peace.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; took notes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The author is Adele Faber. She also has a book out for school and <br/>
home educators called How to talk so Kids Can Learn. I have read them <br/>
both and also have an audio tape of the author discussing her book. <br/>
Her techniques really do work - even with husbands! &lt;big grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you do a search at Amazon.com on Adele Faber it will pull up the <br/>
above titles. Often, you can find them in used book stores because <br/>
they are so popular. It is almost certain that they will be in your <br/>
local public library.<br/>
<br/>
Another author who uses a similar method of talking to kids (but <br/>
doesn&#39;t outline it as well as Faber) is Barbara Coloroso - &quot;Kids are <br/>
Worth It! Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Coloroso Website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kidsareworthit.com/">http://www.kidsareworthit.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
The teachings of these two authors have led me onto reading a third <br/>
author who has a very thought provoking message, her name is Alice <br/>
Miller. Her books: &quot;Banished Knowledge : Facing Childhood Injuries&quot;<br/>
and &quot;For Your Own Good&quot; among several others. They all relate to <br/>
behavior in children and the processes that we use to discipline and <br/>
why.<br/>
<br/>
Alice Miller&#39;s website is: The Natural Child Project @ <br/>
