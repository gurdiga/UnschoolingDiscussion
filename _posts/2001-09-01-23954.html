<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332270806">The legal system encourages it, so it trickles down through the various<br/>
layers of law enforcement.  There is also a huge fear factor and natural<br/>
instincts that predicate knee jerk reactions.  They are continually<br/>
bombarded with news of &quot;perps&quot; shooting other officers and the majority of<br/>
the shooters are folks &quot;of color.&quot;  Auto reaction is to think that they are<br/>
going to be shooters.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469333784">If somebody comes in and robs you of your culture & tries to replace it with values & religions that aren&#39;t real, how would you react?<br/>
If everything you believe in is challenged and/or destroyed, how would you behave?<br/>
If your language was outlawed?<br/>
If your children were kidnapped and forced to live a thousand miles away, would you drink?<br/>
If your children, taken at the age of 7 and sent away to be made &quot;white&quot;, are lost to you forever, what do you do?<br/>
If you know - for a fact - that if a white rapes you - and you speak up - you will be killed - what do you do?<br/>
If you can count the number of female relatives that haven&#39;t been sterilized - how do you behave?<br/>

As for reservations - did you know that there have to be a certain number of carded American Indians on the rez? If not, the nation looses the land.<br/>

Did American Indians decide that the Ghost Dance is illegal?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, this adress part of Janis&#39; point.  I&#39;m a first gen American on my<br/>
dad&#39;s side.  He was born in a DP camp in Germany.  And my mom&#39;s family was<br/>
busy dying in droves that generation.  (Polish and Russian Jews.)  MY<br/>
ancestors didn&#39;t do a damn thing to indigenous people in the US.<br/>
<br/>
But, as a citizen NOW I am responsible for knowing about that history and<br/>
making political and social decisions based on it.  Now, I make the same<br/>
choice as you in this case--I won&#39;t avoid a book just because that group<br/>
doesn&#39;t like it.  But I&#39;m no less responsible for knowing why they think<br/>
that way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sure, but I think that doing your own work to make decisions is part of<br/>
unschooling, no?  Understanding other&#39;s feelings and needs is part of<br/>
unschooling, no?  How we model this things to our children is part of<br/>
unschooling, no?<br/>

&lt;&lt; How can you say what is racist to an Amnerican Indian woman? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;ve read a book and another person hasn&#39;t, we&#39;re in the same situation as <br/>
someone who knows nothing about unschooling telling an unschooler what it is, <br/>
as regards that book.<br/>
<br/>
And we DO need to be talking about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The original recommendations seemed to be books to avoid because of <br/>
portrayals of Indians.  <br/>
<br/>
IF people are going to forbid/discourage/make unavailable Indian in the <br/>
Cupboard without having read it, what&#39;s the difference between that and a <br/>
fundamentalist Christian who KNOWS Harry Potter is evil without having read <br/>
it, because his minister said so?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;When an American Indian walks down the street, there is no putting another <br/>
face on. You are American Indian.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is not my experience in New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
It may be that in Rhode Island or Ohio or Florida it&#39;s different.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How can you say what is racist to an Amnerican Indian woman?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
American Indian women do not own the concept or the term &quot;racist.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I will not be pressed to agree with someone or be seen ignorant just <br/>
because that person claims ownership of a concept.   This is the point of The <br/>
Emperor&#39;s New Clothes.<br/>
<br/>
If someone says &quot;Only the ignorant would disagree that this book is racist,&quot; <br/>
then ANYONE who says &quot;Oh, yes!  Very racist!&quot; just to avoid seeming ignorant <br/>
is in collusion.<br/>
<br/>
Another person on this list who identified herself as Indian for being part <br/>
(which I know is totally legal to 1/4, but that doesn&#39;t mean the person isn&#39;t <br/>
3/4 non-Indian and ignoring those parts is a special oddity common among <br/>
those who like to claim to know all to be known about racism)  accused me of <br/>
racism on this list for asking her to document some claims which were simple <br/>
&quot;facts&quot; according to her.  It wasn&#39;t right then and it&#39;s not right now.<br/>
<br/>
Who made the argument about Japan?  I honestly don&#39;t remember.  It was before <br/>
I left town for the weekend and it was lost in the flow.   I know a fair <br/>
amount about the Ainu, the group before the current Japanese, who were pushed <br/>
north by the migration.  <br/>
<br/>
How many generations should go by before people stop living in the past?  How <br/>
many people should become furious at ME, who was born in 1953, about things <br/>
that happened in 1400, 1600, 1800?  Someone here&#39;s claiming righteous anger <br/>
about what Christians did to her ancestors!?  WHEN?  1500 years ago?  Nobody <br/>
can be so sure who their ancestors were 1500 years ago.  And if some future <br/>
genetics testing proves one person&#39;s purity back 1500 years to a certain town <br/>
and place, who owed them compensation for a language change 1500 years ago?<br/>
<br/>
And who is blaming whom for government schools?<br/>
Is this list not pretty thoroughly people who are opposed to separation of <br/>
parents from children and from compulsory attendance even in neighborhood day <br/>
schools?<br/>
<br/>
Can some of this vitriolic reaction to Indian in the Cupboard be doused and <br/>
can we get back to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
