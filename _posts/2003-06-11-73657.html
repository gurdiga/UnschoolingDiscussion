<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032424240">Had to laugh. Poor Tim didn&#39;t know what a jumper was, so I explained it to <br/>
him. I think we should take up a collection and get him one of his own to wear <br/>
to Toastmasters. He might just look good in it, and then the rest of us hairy <br/>
legged and pitted creatures would feel great.<br/>
Nancy, in BC, get to talk to Tim and Maureen any time I want to, almost.<br/>

must not own any since I as well quite know what they are for sure. Are they <br/>
those like over-all dresses or those pantsuits that are like a one piece <br/>

disco dancing - Saturday Night Fever kind of clothes. <br/>

Sorry, but I only have 446 posts left to go and it&#39;s 1:40 am in So Cal right <br/>

 </span></blockquote>In England it&#39;s a sweater, I think ;-) (I&#39;d like to know why! Sweaters at<br/>
least have something to do with sweat. I can&#39;t see what they have to do with<br/>
jumping.)<br/>
<br/>
But in America it&#39;s sort of like the top of overall pants attached to an<br/>
A-line dress.<br/>

Go to Google. Click on Images and type in &quot;denim jumper&quot;. You&#39;ll see<br/>
hundreds.<br/>

Birks are not flip-flops.  I hate flip-flops.  Flip-flops go between toes<br/>

extremely comfortable and make walking heavenly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Although they do make Birks that go between the toes as well.  It is the <br/>
footbed that sets them apart.  The construction, not just cork but cork is a big <br/>
part of it.  They are made so after you wear them for a while the footbed will <br/>
conform to your foot.  You have a foorprint in the shoe.  That makes them so <br/>
comfy and helps them to stay on your foot without being tight.  They last <br/>
forever.  And they do make shoes as well, not just sandals.  Jackson wears the <br/>
shoes to the office.  <br/>

have a removable insole and three wide front straps and a back strap so they <br/>
will fit snug to stay on while hiking.  Also have more of a &quot;hiking&quot; tread on <br/>
them.  I love them to hike in.<br/>
