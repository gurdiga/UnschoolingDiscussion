<div id="ygrps-yiv-173111492">True...the other kids in preschool aren&#39;t competing for Mom&#39;s <br/>
attention...they just don&#39;t get any (while they&#39;re in preschool, anyway). I <br/>
could see him resenting the babies for sending him away every day though. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could think of it as a &quot;unit study&quot; program, and this unit is on <br/>
home economics. You may find that he&#39;s so much help with the twins, you&#39;d <br/>
have a hard time if you sent him to preschool. <br/>
<br/>
Also, with new twins, getting everyone up, fed, dressed and ready to go take <br/>
him to preschool by 9 am might be a tad stressful, then just as you recover <br/>
from that, it&#39;s time to get everyone fed again, dressed again and in the <br/>
carseats again to pick him up.<br/>
<br/>
All in all (IMHO) I think everyone benefits by keeping him home where he <br/>
belongs, and everyone would have a lot tougher time by sending him away.<br/>

in a ton of activities, we are all finding ourselves more centered and<br/>
calm than ever before.  No way would i be able to get them up and ready<br/>

everyone we are taking this year off to adjust to the baby.  Next year,<br/>
I&#39;ll tell them we are taking the year off becuase it&#39;s hard to do anyting<br/>

Some who support more coercive strategies assume that children will run<br/>
wild if they are not controlled.  However, the children for whom this is<br/>
true typically turn out to be those accustomed to being controlled--those<br/>
who are not trusted, given explanations, encouraged to think for<br/>
themselves, helped to develop and internalize good values, and so<br/>
on.  Control breeds the need for more control, which is then used to<br/>
justify the use of control.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534930191">So I am not going to say you can&#39;t do it. I am going<br/>
to say that I did have my dd go to preschool after her<br/>
brother was born. She really enjoyed it. I really<br/>
needed the support of having a place I could count on<br/>
to take her so I could get some down time. Ds tended<br/>
to nap while dd was in at preschool. It was what kept<br/>
me sane during the girst year after ds was born.<br/>
<br/>
I would say if you need to have time. If preschool<br/>
would help you I thinks its okay to do (not that you<br/>
need my permision). Mainly I don&#39;t think we should<br/>
feel guilty if we need to reach out for help.<br/>
Sometimes it might be preschool sometimes it might be<br/>
family. <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Dear Cath</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Firstly, Congratulations! </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Secondly, why do these people think he will get the 
attention he needs from being one of 30 when they don&#39;t think he will get it 
being one of three?&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">It could be that many of them are worried about 
you.&nbsp; How could you possibly cope when they don&#39;t think they could?&nbsp; 
How would you like to get up every morning in a rush and try to get him to 
preschool?&nbsp; Talk about stress.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My eldest had just turned four when we took her out 
of the local nusery school. She had only been going mornings for one term. 
(Although schooling doesnot officially start until the term they turn 5 here in 
England , it is pretty much common practice to put them in Nursery the term they 
turn&nbsp;4 )&nbsp;&nbsp; When we took her out I had a 6 month old baby and I 
remember saying to the head, that this decision was not permanent and we could 
be back by the time she turned 5, and one of the examples I used was if I were 
to have another baby.&nbsp; How could I possibly cope?&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, here I am two more babies later.&nbsp; The 
youngest is 15 months old, and yes having a toddler does stop us from doing 
things.&nbsp; I never found it a problem when they were babies.&nbsp; It&#39;s 
toddlers that get me.&nbsp; We can do no painting, lego, baking, anything that 
she doesn&#39;t get her hands into.&nbsp; SOmetimes it is a pain and sometimes it is 
great fun to watch (basically it depends on my mood and whether or not I mind 
cleaning up :-) )</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have found that it is very important for us to be 
together as we all adjust to a new person.&nbsp; It has taken us at least a year 
every time.&nbsp; I read a lot of&nbsp;stories to them while I am nursing,  I 
even beep like a casstte tape when it is time to turn the page. Sometimes they 
use the computer.&nbsp; We have a lot of conversations while hands are busy 
doing other things, like changing nappies. We have in the past gone to a lot of 
coffee mornings,&nbsp;LLLers and like minded people .&nbsp; It was easy to just 
plop down on somebody else&#39;s sofa.&nbsp; I think it is really important for us 
to be together, to be able to grab those precious moments when the baby is 
asleep, or the siblings are quiet with a video so that I can do something with 
the eldest, or the youngest.&nbsp;I want to be here when the four year old walks 
up to me with his revelation that there are bones inside you body....I may be 
occupied but we are still TOGETHER.&nbsp;Ans that is the&nbsp;&#39;real world&#39; 
experience that everybpdy is so worried about, isn&#39;t it?  My ears and my heart 
are still there for them all.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The same day that our daughter was born upstairs, a 
woman down the street had a little boy.&nbsp; SHe was in hospital and they still 
sent their 12 year old daughter to school.&nbsp; She didn&#39;t get tosee her 
brother for a couple of days.&nbsp; Even the day they brought him home from 
hospital, she was at school. I sometimes get the feeling that she gets to play 
with our baby more than she gets to play with her own.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">That is not the life for us.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">yes it is hard.&nbsp; Yes, he will want you more

<div id="ygrps-yiv-472338849">Did it ever occur to your &quot;well meaning&quot; friends that<br/>
shoving your son out the door as soon as the babies<br/>
get there will send a message of &quot;got new babies now,<br/>
dont need you&quot; to him? Geez, people can be dumb when<br/>
there trying to be smart!!<br/>
Go with your instincts. Your son will have leaps in<br/>
self esteem when he sees what a huge help he CAN (not<br/>
must) be to you. <br/>
As far as &quot;activities&quot;, I agree with the others---<br/>
crayons, paint, legos, trains- whatever. Home holds<br/>
all a preschooler needs when your a loving parent.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son was just over 3 when our daughter was born. Yes, it was a big<br/>
adjustment, but also enriching for all of us. Some of the best advice I got<br/>
was &quot;give yourself 6 weeks for things to settle out after the baby is born&quot;,<br/>
and I would add to that &quot;then give yourself 6 more weeks, then 6 more weeks,<br/>
then...&quot; :-) It seems that every month or two with a new baby (or in your<br/>
case two) comes with new challenges. As some things get easier, something<br/>
else gets harder. At first when the babes are little, they will spend a lot<br/>
of time nursing or napping and so you can most likely get lots of books read<br/>
while nursing or lying down with the babies. Then as they become more alert,<br/>
there will be times when they will sit or lie near you and you can do crafts<br/>
stuff on the floor - they won&#39;t be mobile enough to put beads or playdough<br/>
in their mouth. Once they become mobile, things get trickier. If you&#39;re<br/>
lucky, they will have settled into some sort of predictable nap routine and<br/>
possibly you can do stuff with your oldest then, otherwise some stuff will<br/>
have to be shelved until they&#39;re past the oral stage. At around 1 year, they<br/>
really get into imitating mom, so we&#39;ve found that this is a good age to do<br/>
projects together, like cooking and cleaning where we all do it together. I<br/>
give my babe some measuring cups and flour to play with and she thinks she<br/>
is &quot;baking&quot; too. I also got some small baking stuff (rolling pins, wooden<br/>
spoons) from IKEA for cheap and she uses those to &quot;cook&quot;. Or we sweep the<br/>
floors or dust together. Everything takes forever, but that&#39;s the way it is<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, your son will get less of your time, you will most likely feel guilty,<br/>
he will sometimes feel angry or upset. OTOH, he will get siblings which can<br/>
be a great joy in themselves. I love to watch my kiddos playing together and<br/>
I also know as my daughter&#39;s imagination begins to bloom they will have more<br/>
and more fun together. Yes, preschool can give you a break to have time just<br/>
to parent the two babes, but it also will add some stresses (schedule,<br/>
driving with babies in carseats), and it will remove your son from this new<br/>
family that is his reality. I think it&#39;s much less stressful on the child to<br/>
have them be an active part of their new sibling&#39;s lives. I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
missed all the special moments between my son and our baby daughter for<br/>
anything (of course, now that she can get into his legos and wreck his train<br/>
layouts, it&#39;s a bit tougher, LOL!).<br/>
<br/>
As far as activities go, if you get a double-stroller you can take the<br/>
kiddos out in the great museum of life - out for nature walks and such. It<br/>
doesn&#39;t even have to be anywhere especially important as a destination. My<br/>
son&#39;s favorite site last summer was a cluster of trees in an empty lot that<br/>
he dubbed &quot;The acorn fairy trees&quot;. We would walk or bike there and I would<br/>
sit and nurse my daughter in the shade and he would make little beds from<br/>
acorn shells for the fairies - these are some of the best memories of last<br/>
summer and it didn&#39;t involve any great amount of thought or energy, just a<br/>
few snacks and a walk to a small spot. You can help your son create sacred<br/>
spaces - we&#39;ve piled up pillows in the hall to make a special fort for my<br/>
son, or gone to special places outdoors he likes - and tell stories about<br/>
these places. That doesn&#39;t involve a book or any other accoutrements, only<br/>
your imagination and voice. I&#39;ve also found that singing helps keep life<br/>
interesting and more peaceful around here - we have songs for everything<br/>
(cooking, cleaning, bedtime, teeth brushing, baths, meals), and sometimes<br/>
getting into a routine (not enforced or rigid, but as a guideline) can help<br/>
keep everyone&#39;s sanity.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you, you know that you will get lots of support for your<br/>
decision to keep your family at home together here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-884186670">I&#39;ve been feeling tired and finding it hard to put myself to do the <br/>
things I want to do recently, and I&#39;ve just had a good suggestion, so <br/>
I&#39;ll pass it on.  Teenagers or college students might exchange <br/>
spending time with the children, or helping around the house, for <br/>
things you could do, like transport or typing up papers, giving them <br/>
&#39;net access for their projects, perhaps (this is good, needs no <br/>
physical involvement on your part).  If nothing else, the company <br/>
would probably be helpful, I know I feel isolated at times.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I&#39;ve been on the list for about 3 months now.  My son is 3.  We have<br/>
&gt; been trying to conceive and are thankfully nearing the end of our<br/>
&gt; first trimester with fraternal twins, due in august.  My son will be a<br/>
&gt; few weeks away from his 4th birthday when the babies arrive.  Due to<br/>
&gt; our family&#39;s commitment to the unschooling vision, we have no plans to<br/>
&gt; put him in preschool. We feel these are the most important years *not*<br/>
&gt; to place a child in an educational program, due to the delicate nature<br/>
&gt; of the unfolding mind.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since telling a few friends about the upcoming increase in our family<br/>
&gt; size and sudden change from a family of 1 to a family of 3, we have<br/>
&gt; been bombarded with advice:  That even though my son didn&#39;t like going<br/>
&gt; with a swim instructor when he was 2, he has grown and may now really<br/>
&gt; like preschool (being away from a home based life).  That he may<br/>
&gt; resent the babies as they grow and say &quot;Oh, now they&#39;re awake---now i<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t do this project with you mom&quot;, and that he will get a lot out of<br/>
&gt; being with kids his age who do not compete for his mothers&#39; attention.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I find myself rather defensive to these remarks from well-meaning<br/>
&gt; friends.  I want to try to keep my son at home, even though i know he<br/>
&gt; will get less of me during the year he has just turned 4. Caring for<br/>
&gt; two babies will be time consuming.  I feel hopeful however that it<br/>
&gt; will be enriching for my son, somehow.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any suggestions or experience with keeping life passionate and<br/>
&gt; stimulating for a 4 year old while we all adjust to big family<br/>
&gt; changes? I just can&#39;t picture toting 2 babes and a 4 year old to the<br/>
&gt; museums and libraries and old folks homes.......!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627592368">I discussed this question with my two older kids here. My 20yo daughter, <br/>
Jenny, says that unschooling with younger siblings around taught her several <br/>
things. Most importantly she says she has no illusions about what&#39;s involved <br/>
in having babies. She witnessed her brother&#39;s birth when she was 4 3/4 and <br/>
was almost 9 when her sister was born. She knows just how much having babies <br/>
ties one down and is very unlikely to become a mother before she&#39;s ready.<br/>
    My 15yo son says it&#39;s hard enough to have a new sibling without being <br/>
also &quot;sent away&quot; to preschool. He was very affected by his younger sister&#39;s <br/>
birth so for him this would certainly have been true. Even though my kids <br/>
have a fairly high level of conflict they are also close and I feel confident <br/>
they will be good friends when they are all adults. They&#39;re getting there <br/>
slowly but surely:&gt;) -Amalia-</div>
