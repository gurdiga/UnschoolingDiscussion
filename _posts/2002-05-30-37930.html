I want to mangle together the paper tiger and the straw man to make my<br/>

This made me think of the story of The Lady and the Tiger, about picking the <br/>
door.  <br/>
<br/>
Literary reference day for sure!<br/>
<br/>
If there were two or three pinatas and had different things in them (some not <br/>
so nice)...   some mathish kid could come up with some great puzzles from <br/>
that.  <br/>
<br/>
But if it were a REAL problem and not hypothetical, I know my kids would <br/>
think to heft it, smell it, rattle it...<br/>
<br/>
I like the image of &quot;beating a dead pinata,&quot; though.  Especially a <br/>
tiger-shaped one, made of straw.<br/>

crap.  I don&#39;t know if she made it up or had heard it somewhere, but I love <br/>
it.<br/>
