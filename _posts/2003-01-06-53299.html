<br/>
&lt;&lt;But, I still am at a loss for what ( if any) consequence is natural for <br/>
breaking the <br/>
controller out of anger.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Natural consequences&quot; means natural.<br/>
Not what parents decide is natural.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If he continually deals with frustration in an aggressive and destructive <br/>
manner without <br/>
consequence, what will be the &quot;thing&quot; that helps him begin to control his <br/>
temper? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The thing that causes ANYONE to control himself is understanding.  Not fear <br/>
of punishment.  Fear of punishment makes people sneaky, and makes them lie, <br/>
and makes them yearn for the day when they leave that house and do exactly <br/>
the opposite of what they were forced to do, or forbidden to do.<br/>
<br/>
Holly told us about a conversation late at a New Year&#39;s Eve party.  Somehow <br/>
it had come up that she never got punished at home, but that she was truthful <br/>
with her mom.  One of the girls looked at her with big eyes (as Holly acted <br/>
it out) and said, &quot;But if she doesn&#39;t punish you, you could lie a LOT!&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Holly said, &quot;Why would I?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So the little girl seemed to think that the reason she didn&#39;t lie was fear of <br/>
punishment.  Holly saw it altogether as the lying itself being the result of <br/>
the punishments.  She&#39;s eleven years old.  And very truthful!<br/>
<br/>
The natural consequence of lying is people don&#39;t like you or trust you as <br/>
much.  Any other consequences are UNnatural and created, and &quot;consequences&quot; <br/>
which are imposed by parents are just punishments.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644510622">I had to respond to this because just recently I&#39;ve been experimenting with &quot;no restrictions&quot; at our house.  If I&#39;ve already posted here about this I apologize.  I may have cross posted.<br/>
<br/>
I have given my kids total freedom for the past 3 weeks or so.  I must say...they talk to me MORE now than they ever have. (And I thought they talked a lot before!)<br/>
<br/>
I have learned about some scary things, but I also think I am having some influence...and not just on MY Kids, but on their newer friends too.  The friends all look at me, and then look at my kids like &quot;is she for REAL?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Within a week, our house became the &quot;hangout&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
It is scary hearing about some of what they&#39;ve been up to, but I&#39;ve decided the only way to stop them is to lock them in a closet.  The only other way to stop them is to have influence....by being trustworthy...and gaining their respect.<br/>
<br/>
It really is &quot;either or&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I have had to clarify though that lack of punishment does not mean I &quot;approve&quot; or I &quot;condone&quot; or I &quot;don&#39;t care what they do&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We get this a lot. ALL of Cameron&#39;s friends are punished and grounded and <br/>
have things taken away from them for various &quot;transgressions&quot;. They can&#39;t <br/>
believe that Cam wouldn&#39;t lie or that we wouldn&#39;t punish. They figure he can <br/>
get away with anything (which basically he CAN &lt;g&gt;). But he doesn&#39;t---or if <br/>
he does, he tells us, and we talk about it. <br/>
<br/>
Most of the kids can&#39;t imagine talking with their parents about ANYthing. <br/>
Oddly, they don&#39;t mind talking to me! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
It seems mostly like simply a control issue. The kids aren&#39;t doing anything <br/>
really bad---or at least nothing the parents didn&#39;t do themselves when they <br/>
were teens...&lt;g&gt; <br/>
