&lt;&lt; What is it about<br/>
the freedom of childhood that makes everyone so nervous? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t charge real money for &#39;doing nothing.&#39;<br/>
You and I know that it&#39;s not doing nothing to keep children safe and happy, <br/>
to provide them cool experiences and all, but this culture is run on <br/>
money-by-the-hour and proveable results.  &quot;A product.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A product of the public schools.&quot;  You&#39;ve heard that phrase, no doubt.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Her main<br/>
obstacle will be her natural bent to control and organize life in<br/>
general.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have that.  So I put that energy into controlling my children&#39;s freedom <br/>
from other people&#39;s controls. &lt;g&gt;  I put the organization into organizing <br/>
opportunities.  <br/>
<br/>
Local homeschoolers are doing field trips (lots of them) lately for the <br/>
younger kids.  My youngest is the age of their oldest, pretty much, at nine.  <br/>
My older boys have stuff going (gaming geek stuff, mostly, but not <br/>
exclusively) with other boys--mostly homeschooled.  Our house is the #2 <br/>
hangout.  #1 is the gaming shop a mile up the road.  We have enough sleepling <br/>
space and bedding and are conveniently located that sometimes there are three <br/>
or four extra kids here, and not just on weekends.  So my primary job lately <br/>
has been being transport and supervision for that group.  I try to provide <br/>
table space for gaming, make sure there&#39;s milk (luxury days:  soda) and <br/>
juice, reassure parents who need the okay that it&#39;s fine for the kids to be <br/>
here two or three days straight without them reciprocating (some can&#39;t, and <br/>
it wouldn&#39;t be the same--one family lives 50 miles out in the country which <br/>
defeats the purpose).  I occasionally expose them to a movie they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have seen or a comedian or some music, subtle-like.  I spell words when they <br/>
need spelling (sometimes two computers are on both phone lines late at night) <br/>
and otherwise provide physical-plant support.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;results&quot; or &quot;product&quot; aren&#39;t &quot;legitimate.&quot;  I&#39;m babysitting is all.  I&#39;m <br/>
providing them a safe place.  Babysitting doesn&#39;t pay what *teaching* pays.  <br/>
Teaching has charts and &quot;progress&quot; through test scores and such.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why so many states have testing requirements, because it seems wrong, <br/>
in this culture, not to &#39;show progress.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The most I can say of these boys (and be able to prove anything) is that <br/>
they&#39;re off the streets and not setting fire to anything (usually).  <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll look back at it twenty years from now as an idyllic wonderland, I <br/>
imagine.<br/>
But that never pays money. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div><font face="Pooh">Lately I have been having the feeling that I need to 
provide a safe haven for my daughter and her friends (she has a couple at this 
point in time)...but the place where we live does not allow that and I&#39;m praying 
that the Lord will give me direction in this issue. Maybe with this move within 
the next month will provide a place where we can have the room to be able to do 
that.</font></div>
