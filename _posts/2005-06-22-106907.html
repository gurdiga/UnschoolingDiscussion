Recess thing is going to subscribe to some magazine&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Can you tell me more about your perpetual recess thing?  Do you own a building?  Rent?  How many times a week?  Is it all unschoolers? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some of this is from a response last month:<br/>
I was one of the founding members, along with Tuckervill, of an <br/>
inclusive support group here in Little Rock. It has mostly been made up <br/>
of relaxed homeschoolers and unschoolers. One of the things have talked <br/>
about for years is having a&quot;space&quot; to hang out, having meetings in and <br/>
do activities that are not great for someone&#39;s home.<br/>
One of the other founding members of Live and Learn began working at an <br/>
after school care program at their church which had a lot of unused <br/>
space. She asked them if it could be rented and they were willing to <br/>
rent it at a very, very cheap price. We have one main room that was once <br/>
their sanctuary, a kitchen, den, 2 &quot;classrooms&quot; and use of the gym, <br/>
playground and grounds. We&#39;re there from 10ish to about 2:30 on Tuesdays <br/>
and Thursdays and we have a $20 a month fee. We decided not to be <br/>
affiliated with our support group, but most of the members of the <br/>
Homeschool Zone come from there. I think we have 15 - 20 families who pay.<br/>
<br/>
I call it perpetual recess which is a title I stole from an article in HEM :<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeedmag.com/HEM/211/jfrecess.html">http://www.homeedmag.com/HEM/211/jfrecess.html</a><br/>
last year about a co-op in the northeast. Our initial idea was to have a <br/>
part-time &quot;free-school&quot; type of situation. We soon realized that in this <br/>
part of the country a freeschool was not gonna happen and its become <br/>
more like a very loosely run co-op. We&#39;ve found that in this part of the <br/>
country even a loosely run, non-religious, non-corrosive, free-choice, <br/>
its-ok-to-hang-out-and-play-video-games-all-day co-op has a hard time <br/>
attracting members. Everyone is just too busy &quot;homeschooling&quot; and if <br/>
they are going to do something that might take time out of their &quot;school <br/>
day&quot; it had better fill some kind of educational need.<br/>
~meh~<br/>
So we have a weekly schedule that comes out via email. This week&#39;s <br/>
schedule looked like this:<br/>
10-? Music Morning (one of the moms brings her accordion and auto harp <br/>
and will play tunes for us to sing to. Yesterday it was Beatles songs <br/>
and then she began teaching another mom who to play the autoharp)<br/>
During this time &quot;doll club&quot; was happening and video games were being <br/>
played also.<br/>
There was also moms sitting around talking, Tuckervill was in town so it <br/>
was nice to sit and talk to her about the baby. We talked some abut the <br/>
funshop I&#39;m gonna try and do at the Live and Learn conference. I think <br/>
the girls went outside at some point to ride scooters.<br/>
11:45 Lunch<br/>
12:45 Cartooning  (I&#39;m meeting with some kids and moms who want to work <br/>
on drawing cartoons. We&#39;re all working out of different books and off <br/>
and on I&#39;ll point out something, but its fun just to work with others) <br/>
during this time moms with younger kids went to the playground.<br/>
The rest of the day kids played and hung out. I know at some point there <br/>
were a few guys out front hacking and slashing with boffer swords. I <br/>
know they went to the gym for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday is like this:<br/>
10ish Old Tyme show and tell (bring in antiques and heirlooms and talk <br/>
about them...this is facilitated by a 9yr old girl)<br/>
10:45 Digital scavenger hunt   (this is being facilitated by an 11 yr <br/>
old. He is coming up with a list and we will break into groups with a <br/>
van and digital camera and go find what is on his list. Afterwards we <br/>
will come back and look through the pics to see who found what.)<br/>
11:45ish Lunch<br/>
1:00 Cheerleading (one of our moms does this and we have this group of <br/>
little girls who just adore it)<br/>
<br/>
Most days have more in them. I like the lightly scheduled days, but a <br/>
good amount of members just won&#39;t come if there is nothing scheduled. <br/>
They miss the best days at the Zone because those days end up being so <br/>
much better.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Looks like fun, huh?<br/>
For us it is---we have all we need there in an endless supply of boys <br/>
(and some girls) who will hang out with Josh and play VG or boffer <br/>
swords. Sometimes he will get out Heroscape and play that. He does the <br/>
cartooning with me and if there is some type of theater thing (like <br/>
imporv) going on will join in those classes. The truth is it is more <br/>
stressful for me. I make the schulde and deal with the complaints that <br/>
there is not &quot;anything I can&#39;t do at home. Why would I miss a day of <br/>
school to do something I can do at home with my kids?&quot;---arrggghhh, then <br/>
plan something you find value in and see if anyone else wants to do it. <br/>
I really think that this would be the case among any group of folks who <br/>
have some very distinct differences in how they raise their children and <br/>
how they homeschool. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it is working, there is just <br/>
always a group of folks with in any homeschooling thing I&#39;ve ever been <br/>
involved in who want so much but want everyone else to do the work.<br/>
~sheesh~<br/>
I also spend time running interference for Josh and the moms who have <br/>
problems with VG.<br/>
This was our 1st year and over the summer we will go to just Thursdays <br/>
and discuss what worked and what did not work this year. One thing that <br/>
I&#39;ve noticed is that the child facilitated activities seem to be better <br/>
attended and enjoyed, I also have seen a few flop because the child <br/>
facilitating had no support from their parent.<br/>
We also have a lack of teens. I hope we can work on getting more <br/>
families with older kids involved next year.<br/>

theme to some other type of show and tell the next time.<br/>
