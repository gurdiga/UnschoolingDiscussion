<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264873620">From a family who *loves* seeing movies on opening day (before anyone <br/>
else, because we go even before schools let out) -- we just saw &quot;Mean Girls.&quot; <br/>
It stars Lindsey Lohan from Parent Trap and Freaky Friday, along with half the <br/>
Saturday Night Live cast, including SNL&#39;s first female head writer Tina Fey, <br/>
who also wrote the movie. SLN producer Lorne Michaels produced it.<br/>
<br/>
       All this we knew going in.<br/>
<br/>
       What we did NOT know, or expect, is that the first words spoken in the <br/>
movie introduce its heroine as a homeschooler (it looks more like <br/>
unschooling) in the wilds of Africa for her whole life. Back in the States, her parents <br/>
decide she should try high school to &quot;get socialized.&quot;  This is a recurring <br/>
theme throughout the movie. Motivation or backstory, I guess they call it.<br/>
<br/>
       It sounds dumb, and maybe after seeing it some homeschoolers will <br/>
grumble and cluck, taking offense, but we laughed our heads off (me, DD14 and even <br/>
DS8). Then we talked about it all the way home, which is usually a really <br/>
good sign. Can&#39;t wait to own it!<br/>
<br/>
       And once some of you here get the chance to see it too, I&#39;d love to <br/>
&quot;analyze&quot; it or even have an intellectual conversation about it! :)  JJ<br/>

I was just reading a review of the movie and saw the homeschooling part too.<br/>
Had intended to write in and ask if anyone saw it. What the review I read<br/>
said the lead character shows strength and doesn&#39;t become the shrinking<br/>
violet. I thought that was a good sign for homeschoolers. We will probably<br/>
wait for the dvd but I&#39;ll put it on my list just the same.<br/>

I haven&#39;t seen the movie, but I saw Lindsay Lohan talking about it with <br/>
Dr. Phil, and Tina Fey talking about it with Conan.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to get extra-intellectual ;-) , the movie is based on the <br/>
nonfiction book _Queen Bees and Wannabes_.<br/>

(OK, I can&#39;t swear about the spelling.)<br/>
