<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013190932">Ok, had time to read several posts before I responded.  (nursing a <br/>
really horrid double ear infection, can&#39;t hear ugh.)<br/>
Having the kids at Montessori allows me to go to an hour of therapy <br/>
each week with a woman who seems very knowledgeable about sexual abuse <br/>
issues, pms and hormone imbalances in general, I also get 1 hour of <br/>
reiki ( on trade, I sew for him, he does reiki for me) and I go to the <br/>
Chiropractor.  Now my insurance changed and therapy isn&#39;t covered, so <br/>
I&#39;m trying out yoga ( missed this week cuz of the ears).<br/>
I am working really hard to get healthy, and being a mom at the same <br/>
time is hard.  It&#39;s gets a little better a bit at a time, I just am <br/>
soooo tired.  I think every parent is to some extent.<br/>
I have way more on my plate than I should.  I have a cloth diaper <br/>
business, I teach Bradley classes weekly, I am a doula, I run a co-op, <br/>
I&#39;m on the committee of another co-op project with the local chapter of <br/>
Weston A. Price.  I should quit most of that and just be a mom.  I am <br/>
terrified to do that.  I have made great strides in my therapy, been <br/>
doing it in some fashion since I was ten( EMDR was my favorite).  My <br/>
kids do deserve the best and I go to great lengths to do the best I <br/>
can.  I think the real problem is I don&#39;t give myself any credit.  My <br/>
husband is an amazing father, 400 times better parent than me.  He is <br/>
not very good at being a cheerleader*for me*, and most times I feel <br/>
inferior around him.  I know I must be doing ok because I am constantly <br/>
complimented on how great my kids are.  I love them intensely and they <br/>
are great kids!  I just go into melt down mode really fast when they <br/>
argue or cry and I can&#39;t figure out what is wrong.  I feel so helpless <br/>
because all I know how to do is hug.  Got that part down really well.  <br/>
I never realized before I had kids that someone would ever turn down a <br/>
hug!  now what?  If I can stay calm long enough to redirect them it <br/>
works sometimes.  There are days Crispin just cries all day long and I <br/>
have no idea why, look at his mouth, his butt, feel his tummy, take him <br/>
to the Chiropractor, let him lay in the middle of the floor and scream <br/>
and feel like a failure.  I had the misconception before I had children <br/>
that if you could love them enough, everyone would be happy.<br/>
My house is super tiny and cramped and I keep think if we had more <br/>
room, I might be more calm about them helping me and being with me <br/>
while I do stuff, since I wouldn&#39;t trip on them.  I also think we <br/>
should have at least one room in the house where they can touch <br/>
anything they want and not be told &#39;no, that&#39;s an ouch&#39; or something <br/>
like that.  We really don&#39;t have that.  I have ideas of how to create <br/>
that but my husband wants to move so badly he won&#39;t agree to totally <br/>
rearrange the house with me ;)<br/>
I do think if I could find a mother&#39;s helper it would work well for us. <br/>
  I had a wonderful lady while I was pregnant with Crispin but she <br/>
couldn&#39;t work for $5 an hour for ever.  She was such a good cook too!  <br/>
There aren&#39;t a lot of people who can work for what I can pay.  That is <br/>
how we ended up with day care (NIGHTMARE!) then Montessori.  Originally <br/>
I was too sick to care for them on my own and it wasn&#39;t a choice.  Now <br/>
it is more realistic to find a way to make it work.  If I could have <br/>
someone sitting on my shoulder all day to just whisper &quot; you&#39;re doing <br/>
fine&quot; I think I could do it.  Typing just that line made me cry - not <br/>
sure why.  May be I just really need to hear it.<br/>

&gt; so strongly believe something is right, yet feel so wrong in the role? <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m guessing the Montessori tuition is more expensive than counselling <br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe you can (QUICKLY!) find a really good short-term counsellor, <br/>
&gt; someone<br/>
&gt; who doesn&#39;t intend to draw out your entire life&#39;s story and keep you <br/>
&gt; as a<br/>
&gt; regular client for years, but who could have some incredibly easy and <br/>
&gt; good ideas for<br/>
&gt; getting you past your stuck place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you plan to stay stuck, unschooling might not work out for you.  If <br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; want to unschool, you need to have some flexibility and joy and happy<br/>
&gt; expectation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are you an introvert and just get crowded?  Can you hire a mother&#39;s <br/>
&gt; helper,<br/>
&gt; to hang out with the kids and get them snacks and water and play with <br/>
&gt; them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;I don&#39;t like to read to my kids, I don&#39;t like it when they<br/>
&gt; try to &#39;help&#39;.  I feel like a creep! &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some moms like one age lots more than others.  Maybe you don&#39;t love <br/>
&gt; toddlers,<br/>
&gt; but if you don&#39;t love THESE particular children, it will be harder to <br/>
&gt; unfold<br/>
&gt; with them as they grow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can heal your own childhood traumas by looking at little things <br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; children do and thinking that you wish you could have done that.  And <br/>
&gt; if you think<br/>
&gt; it sweetly instead of with jealous resentment, you can allow the hurt <br/>
&gt; child<br/>
&gt; inside you to experience a moment of release.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I could be off on this, but if you have childhood issues you&#39;ve been <br/>
&gt; burying<br/>
&gt; or ignoring, it might be the season to release them.  If it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; child-of-alcoholic stuff, al-Anon can help you and it won&#39;t cost <br/>
&gt; money.  If it&#39;s codependency,<br/>
&gt; you might find a self-help group too.  If it&#39;s survival of sexual <br/>
&gt; abuse,<br/>
&gt; likewise.  If it&#39;s less generic, it might be worth going to <br/>
&gt; counselling for a<br/>
&gt; while, so that you are freed up and open to give your children what <br/>
&gt; they need so<br/>
&gt; that they don&#39;t grow up with a lump left over from childhood too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I was 32 I started four years of going to Adult Children of <br/>
&gt; Alcoholics<br/>
&gt; meetings.  Without that, I would not have been a good mom, and my <br/>
&gt; marriage<br/>
&gt; probably wouldn&#39;t have lasted, because I had knots in me I didn&#39;t know <br/>
&gt; that other<br/>
&gt; people didn&#39;t all have.  In that same first season, I got pregnant <br/>
&gt; with Kirby.<br/>
&gt;  And I went to La Leche League after he was born.  Those two <br/>
&gt; organizations<br/>
&gt; and their ideas about how peple can and should live in peace changed <br/>
&gt; my life,<br/>
&gt; and my kids&#39; lives, and my husband&#39;s life in really good ways.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unschooling seemed quite like more of the same, to me,  beause it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; related<br/>
&gt; to them both.   Children have natural needs for peace and positive <br/>
&gt; regard and<br/>
&gt; for joy.  They grow best when they&#39;re not stunted, which seems <br/>
&gt; obvious, but<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s easy to forget if we go with the cultural flow which says <br/>
&gt; children are bad,<br/>
&gt; irritating, whiney, sneaky and so forth.  Children raised openly and <br/>
&gt; kindly<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t need to be that way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think that where your kids are or aren&#39;t won&#39;t matter unless you <br/>
&gt; change<br/>
&gt; your own heart and eyes toward them and toward yourself.<br/>

because all I know how to do is hug.  Got that part down really well.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My sister used to be that way.<br/>
<br/>
I told her it was as though she had a huge load of straw on her cart, and <br/>
everything that happened was the last straw.  So she would &quot;calm down&quot; by taking <br/>
one little straw off her cart, and the NEXT thing that happened was THE LAST <br/>
STRAW!<br/>
<br/>
Instead of REALLY finding ways to calm herself and get to a truly quiet <br/>
place, she got just calm enough to barely function.<br/>
<br/>
If you can find ways to be really calm, you can give some of that calmness to <br/>
your children.  Moods are contagious, and if you&#39;re frenzied (even <br/>
frenzied-but-controlled) they&#39;ll be more like that too.  And if you&#39;re frenzied, your <br/>
heart and digestion and breathing aren&#39;t probably working as well as they could.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you do nothing else, if you start breathing more deeply—slow, deep <br/>
breaths you hold and let out slowly— it will help.  Not all your breathing, just <br/>
once in a while.  Try for ten.  You might not have time or concentration to <br/>
make it all the way to ten, but if you do you&#39;ll probably find that your head <br/>
clears out and stills, that your heartrate slows down, and that you just feel <br/>
less bristly in your skin.  You can do it while you&#39;re reading online, or <br/>
driving, or doing dishes, or folding clothes, or lying down for a rest.  You can do <br/>
one deep breath the next time you feel like yelling or grumping, and as <br/>
you&#39;re letting it out you can try to think of two things you could do, and then <br/>
choose the better one when the breath is out.<br/>
