&lt;&lt;  Just because it isn&#39;t a paper and pencil <br/>
 quiz, doesn;t mean it isn&#39;t a test. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of course not. But the original question was about formal tests......the kind <br/>
you take to get into college and gain employment.<br/>
I never can understand why people worry about tests.<br/>
It takes all of a few minutes to understand how to take a test....maybe a bit <br/>
longer for a more complicated testing style. But not 12 years of formal <br/>
academics!!! When my children see a need to take a test, I&#39;ll help them learn <br/>
how to take one. Until that day, why worry about it? It&#39;s not a skill that is <br/>
important until the person actually needs to take a test.<br/>
Here&#39;s a link about an unschooler that had never tested, didn&#39;t know her <br/>
multiplication tables and got into college only to ace her higher level math <br/>
courses and end up graduating with something like a 3.8 average.<br/>

These kind of stories can really help you realize that as people see a use <br/>
for, or desire a skill, they will get it EASILY. Without years of formal <br/>
academics, stress or pressure to perform as others wish.<br/>
