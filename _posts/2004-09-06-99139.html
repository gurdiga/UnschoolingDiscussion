So now  I&#39;m just concentrating on contentedly meeting the needs of my <br/>
family, and  remembering that I love them and that I want to make <br/>
things peaceful and  happy for them.  And I&#39;m not feeling like a <br/>
victim because I &quot;have  to&quot; clean up.  I&#39;m mindfully reminding myself <br/>
every time I break a  dish and have to sweet it up, or spill a drink, <br/>
or have to cut the grass  that dealing with these things in life <br/>
doesn&#39;t make me a victim.   They&#39;re not terrible, woeful things, <br/>
they&#39;re just a matter of fact part of  life.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Out LOUD!<br/>
 <br/>
Telling them out loud what you&#39;re doing and why won&#39;t hurt.<br/>
 <br/>
Not in a shaming way or in a guilting way. Just the facts, m&#39;am.<br/>
 <br/>
I was out weeding one day. Cameron was 14, I guess. He was standing there  <br/>
watching me. He asked whether I wanted him to help. I said, &quot;No. Not unless you  <br/>
*want* to help.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
All his friends&#39; moms MADE them help---and even recruited Cameron to help  if <br/>
he were there too. Cam wanted to know *why* I didn&#39;t make him. I told him  <br/>
that if I made him, he would do it ( *I* have the power!)----but grudgingly,  <br/>
unhappily, without joy. I figured that *one* day, he would want to help me  <br/>
because he would like to be with me and share with me and enjoy each other and  <br/>
what we were doing. No helping until he was ready and wanted to. (Keep in mind,  <br/>
he was schooled and traditionally parented up to this point.) <br/>
 <br/>
One day, he asked whether I&#39;d like help. I  said, &quot;Only if you want to.&quot; He <br/>
got down and shoveled and weeded  and pruned. We worked all day. While we <br/>
worked we talked. It was fun.<br/>
 <br/>
Now he joyfully takes out garbage, cleans the kitchen and den, helps Duncan  <br/>
with Dunc&#39;s room, keeps his own room nearly spotless (better than mine!). He&#39;s <br/>
 cleaned the bathrooms a few times, but really doesn&#39;t like that. He always  <br/>
empties the dishwasher for me and often does the laundry. Never a complaint or <br/>
a  &quot;do I *have* to?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Two years, though. That deschooling time. How long have you nagged?  coerced? <br/>
bribed? whined? bitched? I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some formula! &lt;g&gt; It  may take a <br/>
long time, but I think it&#39;s worth it. They need to see (and  hear) you joyfully <br/>
&quot;doing&quot; for them and for you and for the house.<br/>
 <br/>
Model joyful cleaning. &quot;The dishes are calling my name!&quot; &quot;The compost says,  <br/>
&#39;Turn me!&quot; &quot;The kitchen floor needs me right now.&quot; And skip in to do it. (I&#39;m  <br/>
not joking!)<br/>
 <br/>
Glow in what you&#39;ve achieved! Show your pride in what you&#39;ve  <br/>
accomplished----even if it&#39;s just clean dishes! &quot;Soapy water feels so  good!&quot; &quot;The garden is <br/>
weed-free and gorgeous!&quot; &quot; You could EAT off that  floor!-----let&#39;s DO it!&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
Say it out LOUD! <br/>
 <br/>
The more you do it, the better and easier it gets.<br/>
 <br/>
Making it fun only works if you&#39;re making it fun for yourself. Making it  fun <br/>
*just* to get them to do it for you only makes them resent your stupid  <br/>
efforts! &lt;g&gt; Like playing a game so they&#39;ll learn math. It needs to be  real. <br/>
Actually take pleasure in what you&#39;re doing. They&#39;ll catch it like a  fever!<br/>

Yesterday was David&#39;s birthday and we had guests.  I left dishes in the<br/>
sink when I went to bed.  I got up early with the dogs but then went back<br/>
to bed.  When I got up later Dylan had done the dishes.  He said &quot; I know<br/>
you really like to do the dishes mom, so I hope you don&#39;t mind, but I<br/>
just felt like doing them.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
Dylan is twelve. <br/>
<br/>
I *know* living life joyfully makes a difference in the way our kids see<br/>
us and the way they see the little things that make life better.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a timely post. Tonight my husband and I were talking with our oldest son, <br/>
unbeknownst to us, my daughter (7) cleaned my entire kitchen top to bottom without any <br/>
help as a suprise for me. She washed all the family dishes, started the dishwasher, put <br/>
away clean dishes, shined the sink, swept the floor, put away newspapers, emptied the <br/>
trash and left me a heart-shaped note that said, &quot;Thank you Mom and Dad.&quot; I have no idea <br/>
why she was thanking us in her note when she was the one working. <br/>
<br/>
But it blew me away. We&#39;ve been unschooling about 20 months now and this was such an <br/>
amazing surprise.<br/>
<br/>
Recently my son told me that he liked it when the family room stayed neat and he wanted <br/>
to be the one to make sure that everyone kept it up. He would make sure once a day. He&#39;s <br/>
made good on that promise.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to report that they do catch on when they see that it&#39;s valued and appreciated <br/>
and allowed to be a choice.<br/>

I have friends who are unhappy and feel justified in their negativity.   It&#39;s <br/>
harmful to them and their families.   When you feel negativity, and when you <br/>
try to learn how to replace it with &quot;positivity,&quot; your life is better right <br/>
that second, and the next, and... until you let the negativity come back.<br/>

<br/>
*************<br/>
<br/>
There is a saying that &quot;love is a verb&quot;.  And it is true (studies have been done) that show that when you pretend long enough, the feelings of &quot;wanting to&quot; follow.<br/>
<br/>
There is value in pretending if after awhile, it can help it be sincere.<br/>
<br/>
I think emotions are important, but I don&#39;t think they should be the determing factor in what we decide our actions will be.  For children, that is an element of maturity, but it doesn&#39;t hurt for them to become aware of it when they are young.<br/>

My dh does this every morning,  to himself, in the mirror.  This big cheesy grin.   I saw him one morning and just kind-of stopped and said &quot;what the heck are you doing?&quot;  He told me he does this every morning to get himself into an *up* mood.  I just stared at him in awe.    The guy is in sales,  he has found a way to stay up.  I learned something from him that day.  :)  &lt;---  there,  there&#39;s my smile.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Joy isn&#39;t pretend.  You can&#39;t just grimace and call it smiling. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think people can pretend smiling, and pretend they&#39;re having fun, but I <br/>
don&#39;t think they can pretend joy.  Joy isn&#39;t something others perceive.  It&#39;s a <br/>
flush of something from inside ourselves, some biochemical release, that <br/>
changes the way we feel and see.   People can learn to induce that, but they can&#39;t <br/>
fake it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think emotions are important, but I don&#39;t think they should be the <br/>
determing factor in what we decide our actions will be. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Emotions are a constant.<br/>
Someone can decide what an action should be but be incapable of performing <br/>
that action, because of emotion.<br/>
<br/>
People can learn to manipulate their own emotions, though--to recognize <br/>
depression coming and to stave it off, to recognize frustration and breathe it <br/>
down, to recognize fear and regression (childhood voices overwhelming reason) and <br/>
to regain control of their own conscience.<br/>
<br/>
Those aren&#39;t easy things to do and if one SAYS they can do it, but really <br/>
can&#39;t, then they really can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
But yes, on a basic level, taking the steps to get there can involve playing <br/>
the role of a happier person and then finding others&#39; responses are aids to <br/>
truly becoming happier.<br/>

  &quot;Joy isn&#39;t pretend.  You can&#39;t just grimace and call it smiling. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I think people can pretend smiling, and pretend they&#39;re having fun, but I <br/>
  don&#39;t think they can pretend joy.  Joy isn&#39;t something others perceive.  It&#39;s a <br/>
  flush of something from inside ourselves, some biochemical release, that <br/>
  changes the way we feel and see.   People can learn to induce that, but they can&#39;t <br/>
  fake it.<br/>

  determing factor in what we decide our actions will be. -=-<br/>
<br/>
  Emotions are a constant.<br/>
  Someone can decide what an action should be but be incapable of performing <br/>
  that action, because of emotion.<br/>
<br/>
  People can learn to manipulate their own emotions, though--to recognize <br/>
  depression coming and to stave it off, to recognize frustration and breathe it <br/>
  down, to recognize fear and regression (childhood voices overwhelming reason) and <br/>
  to regain control of their own conscience.<br/>
<br/>
  Those aren&#39;t easy things to do and if one SAYS they can do it, but really <br/>
  can&#39;t, then they really can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
  But yes, on a basic level, taking the steps to get there can involve playing <br/>
  the role of a happier person and then finding others&#39; responses are aids to <br/>
  truly becoming happier.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know anything about Leapster, but Jayn (4.75) has a Gameboy Advance<br/>
SP which has a lighted screen. This makes it much easier to use. <br/>
<br/>
To be honest she seems to like the idea of it more than actually playing it<br/>
- and usually gets me to play it for her. The games she has are Disney<br/>
Princesses doing something or other, and Dora the Explorer. She also has a<br/>
couple of Dora TV episodes in that format that play on it.<br/>
<br/>
Now our neighbor Jonah (5 last July) absolutely loves his Gameboy, and has<br/>
been accomplished at using it for at least 8 months. He likes the more<br/>
combat oriented games, and is always trading back and forth with dh, James.<br/>

My five year old has a gameboy and has these games:<br/>
I SPY<br/>
Scooby Doo<br/>
A combo with pacman, dig dug, galaga and something else (retro games)<br/>
Piglet&#39;s Big Movie<br/>
Monkey Ball Junior (this one is hard though)<br/>
He really likes Mario Bros, he plays that one in Walmart.  He&#39;s saving up for that I think.<br/>
<br/>
I heard that Finding Nemo is good and there are a few others that we are looking at for later.  Many of them involve reading, so we have to help him out at first.  Though, he is picking up a lot of reading from the games. <br/>
I wasn&#39;t thrilled when he got one, I wanted to wait a few more years.  We bought it as a distraction when he fell and had to get stitches.  I was worried he&#39;d play it a lot.  He does when he first gets a game.  Now, I see how much he has learned from playing.  And it makes him happy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891664495">I would get what she wants.<br/>
 <br/>
We had bought a Leappad (don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the same as Leapster) prior to unschooling.    I think Kyra was 5 at the time.  We thought she&#39;d enjoy it.   She hardly touches it.    Except for the &#39;Composers&#39; book we got for it,  she loves dancing to Tschaichowsky and listening to all the different kinds of music.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
This year we got her a Gameboy SP,  she wanted her own handheld and had been playing the two older kids gameboys for the last 2 years.    She doesn&#39;t play it as much as her brother,  but still enjoys it when she does.   She is just beginning to read words so I help her with it when she asks.   Some games she has: Princess Collection, Barbie Detective, Rugrats, Jungle book.  She also plays some of the pokemon ones.   She loves battling pokemon on her gameboy.   :) <br/>
 <br/>
Ella might be different from Kyra maybe she&#39;d like the Leappad thingy.  How about you show her the choices out there and let her pick.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363344231">We got Leapsters for my 2-1/2 and 5-1/2 year olds.  The younger one can<br/>
do some of the games but gets frustrated by the pen  its a bit touchy;<br/>
she also doesnt get the point of most of the games  she just likes<br/>
pushing buttons and having things happen!  The older one played<br/>
constantly (literally on at 8am off at 8pm) for about three weeks.  We<br/>
have four of the cassettes and he did each one through the various<br/>
levels.  Since then, hes barely touched the Leapster :-).  Whenever<br/>
hes around someone playing with a game boy he gets very excited.  Im<br/>
not saying we chose wrongly because Im perfectly happy he got so much<br/>
enjoyment out of it and if he never picks it up again Ill still feel we<br/>
got our moneys worth, but there are limited games available for<br/>
Leapster and theyre not coming out with new ones very quickly.  On the<br/>
other hand, many of the multitude of GB games seem a bit too mature to<br/>
appeal to my naïve 5-y.o.  I think Leapster was a good introduction to<br/>
handheld games and using the buttons  its pretty user-friendly and<br/>
gives feedback if a child keeps pressing the wrong button.  Hope some<br/>
of this helps you in your decision.<br/>

had tried Gameboys at the store and had gotten very frustrated <br/>
because the buttons were small and there were so many of them.  The <br/>
Leapster has bigger buttons and less of them, so it is easier to <br/>
use.  However, there aren&#39;t that many games and they aren&#39;t really <br/>
action games.  He loves the Spongebob game and plays it a lot, but <br/>
didn&#39;t care for the Dora game at all.  We will be getting him a <br/>
Gameboy in about a year I imagine.  I&#39;ve been hoping to get one of <br/>
the old ones from someone after they upgrade to the SP.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-432711345">My 6yo got his first gameboy when he was 4 1/2.  His sisters had requested<br/>
them for Christmas gifts, so he thought he&#39;d like one too.  I figured he&#39;d<br/>
be way too young for it, but bought for him regardless.  He was better at<br/>
the games than his sisters were...actually he still is.  He plays a lot of<br/>
combat-type games (loves the LOTR games) and also Spongebob and Mario games.<br/>
It&#39;s been a great investment for us.  The Gameboys were almost solely<br/>
responsible for helping us keep our sanity on the 13 hour drive to St. Louis<br/>
last year.<br/>
<br/>
He got a LeapPad that same year for his birthday and might have played with<br/>
it twice.  He gave it away to his 4yo cousin last week after sorting through<br/>
some of his things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-202133129">No, but you CAN &quot;fake it &#39;til you make it.&quot; You CAN pretend to enjoy<br/>
something until you do, but you have to be striving for it for it to<br/>
happen. You<br/>
have to WANT to enjoy it. **<br/>
<br/>
I even read a blurb (somewhere) about a scientific study that showed<br/>
that making a large fake smile actually causes the release of some of<br/>
the same positive chemicals as a real smile.  So, in addition to trying<br/>
to smile and laugh naturally a lot, sometimes when life is dull, I do<br/>
the fake smile thing as an exercise for my face and brain.  (It&#39;s hard<br/>
to do it without feeling silly.)<br/>
============================<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m catching up on my emails, so I&#39;m just getting this, but I just had to<br/>
tell how I&#39;ve been doing something similar with my little ones.  When I&#39;m<br/>
getting frustrated about some behavior and I&#39;m about to be stern and &quot;fuss&quot;<br/>
at them, I have been catching myself, and instead smiling at them.  It<br/>
starts out fake (since it doesn&#39;t match my frustration), but switches to the<br/>
real thing in microseconds, because that smile not only feels good (and<br/>
goofy!), but it makes my children smile too!  When I see my children smile,<br/>
I can&#39;t help but have a real smile to give back.  And I can feel my<br/>
frustration melt away and my real feelings of love and compassion come to<br/>
the front right away.  It&#39;s an amazing little trick!  I may still say, &quot;What<br/>
are you doing?&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t think (so-in-so) likes that&quot; or whatever, but<br/>
it&#39;s said kindly and with love, and gets a much better response.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-728482023">P.S. ~ The REST of the story...the little boy GOT his gameboy and now <br/>
he sits in the back of the kid&#39;s section of the library by my boys, <br/>
all of them playing their gameboys while listening to me reading <br/>
books to the kids!  He couldn&#39;t be HAPPIER ~ this child SHINES as <br/>
he&#39;s playing next to my *big kids*!<br/>
<br/>
Also ~ I told the story at the conference about my little English <br/>
friend (age 4) asking me to be his Mum ~ it came from his love of the <br/>
Gameboy and his family&#39;s frustration with his desire to play it so <br/>
much, and my UNDERSTANDING his desire to play with it so much!<br/>
<br/>
I know this subject is a week old...but it caught my eye and I wanted <br/>
to share my experience!<br/>
<br/>
Be Well ~<br/>
Anne</div>
