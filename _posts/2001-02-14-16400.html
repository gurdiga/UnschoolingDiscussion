People keep telling me that cos I have children I should dress &#39;normally&#39;
and look &#39;normal&#39; :)
<br>Can&#39;t think why.
<br>We&#39;ll be living in Fairfax county just outside of DC, where all the
senators live. Perhaps the house prices will drop when english weirdo punk
moves in :)

how boring.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can&#39;t think why.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>heeh, my older sister (very into looking &quot;put<br/>
together&quot; and &quot;cute&quot;...to each his own, I say) once<br/>
(or twice) said (along with a few other people) that I<br/>
was not setting a good example for the kids dressing<br/>
all wierd and having wierd hair teaching them how to<br/>
apply thier own temp tatoos letting them draw tatoos<br/>
on me with henna pens...staying up late, what have<br/>
you.. I SAY<br/>
I would be setting a bad example if they saw me<br/>
dressing and doing my hair in order to please OTHER<br/>
people, and not being comfortable with it myself. I<br/>
SAY I&#39;m teaching them it&#39;s ok to be whatever you want<br/>
to be, as long as you feel good about it and you<br/>
aren&#39;t infringing on anyone else&#39;s rights or hurting<br/>
anyone else doing it. I SAY I&#39;m teaching them that<br/>
it&#39;s not just OKAY to be different but it&#39;s also<br/>
really fun sometimes.<br/>
THEN I get flack cuz people (my family mostly) thinks<br/>
I like doing things JUST TO BE different, &quot;to get a<br/>
reaction&quot; and that whole stereotype thing (bleh)...so<br/>
then I&#39;m teaching my kids &quot;rebellion&quot;, etc...<br/>
But I like to think of dressing for the day as getting<br/>
into costume of whatever I feel like being that day. I<br/>
have dayz where I want to wear my cute little 80&#39;s cut<br/>
off shorts (folded, not frayed) with a tucked in<br/>
t-shirt and matching colored fingernails.....<br/>
sometimes<br/>
I like blow-drying my hair down and wearing a floral<br/>
dress with heels (though, that&#39;s once in a blue moon,<br/>
but still....it happens.&lt;g&gt;).... doing just what other<br/>
people are doing is fine, too, if that&#39;s what you FEEL<br/>
like.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was just discussing what my next color will be with<br/>
my &quot;betend sis in law&quot;. <br/>
I&#39;ve been doing this growing out thing (pics of my<br/>
long hair got the best of me) but I don&#39;t know how<br/>
much longer I can handle this whole auburn soft<br/>
&quot;motherly&quot; look. (Though my mom LOVES it) &lt;g&gt; (soft<br/>
being not spikey...it is still every which way...<br/>
that&#39;s just something I can&#39;t help).. I&#39;m either going<br/>
to have to do a drastic dye job (maybe just blackest<br/>
black possible..it&#39;s been awhile since that one) or<br/>
chop it off again.<br/>
