&gt; Beware Spyware<br/>
&gt; Experts have discovered that those free software products that ask only<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in October 2000 when North Carolina Democratic Senator John Edwards<br/>

 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; how this erosion is occurring.&quot;<br/>
&gt; At Zone Labs, we draw a distinction between Spyware and Adware. Adware<br/>
&gt; includes a piece of code that can be used by software vendors to track<br/>
 </span></blockquote>your<br/>

 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; advertisers whose products or services are advertised on the software, and<br/>
&gt; in some cases to track your use of the software to determine your behavior<br/>
&gt; as a user.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s usually a fair trade - you the user allow the software vendor to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>track<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your use of their product so they can target appropriate advertising<br/>
 </span></blockquote>through<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the product - and you get the software free. And while Adware from<br/>
 </span></blockquote>reputable<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; companies is rarely malicious, it does raise some important privacy<br/>
&gt; questions, especially whether it&#39;s enough to take the vendor&#39;s word that<br/>
&gt; they will use the information for advertising only, and no other purpose.<br/>
&gt; Spyware is much more malicious, and is increasingly used by hackers to get<br/>
&gt; inside your PC, track your behaviour, steal your data, and use you as a<br/>

&gt; And many security and privacy experts believe that the confusion between<br/>
&gt; Adware and Spyware could be a big problem for many consumers, especially<br/>
&gt; when it comes to privacy. One of the largest distributors of free software<br/>
&gt; claims to sell more than 500 different titles to more than 28 million<br/>
&gt; consumers. And although the company freely admits to using Adware in its<br/>
&gt; products, it also claims that it&#39;s only to best target advertising through<br/>
&gt; these products.<br/>
&gt; When one user of that company&#39;s free software conducted a simple and free<br/>
&gt; test to see if his computer did in fact contain any Adware, a total of<br/>
&gt; twenty-seven Adware &quot;parasites&quot; were detected.<br/>
&gt; The test is called Opt Out, offered by Gibson Research, and you can try<br/>

&gt; When a spokesperson for toy-maker Mattel was asked why they used Adware in<br/>
&gt; more than 100 children&#39;s software titles, the response was &quot;The program<br/>
 </span></blockquote>was<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; originally designed to offer consumers additional product content and to<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; consumers, parents could be forgiven for being alarmed when they first<br/>
&gt; stumbled across the secret. And suspicion is often further increased when<br/>
&gt; the information being sent over the Internet from your computer to an<br/>
&gt; unknown source is so heavily encrypted there&#39;s no way of telling what&#39;s<br/>
&gt; being sent.<br/>
&gt; If the information is not encrypted, who else can grab and use is? And<br/>
 </span></blockquote>what<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if a disgruntled programmer designed the Adware to do something much more<br/>
&gt; sinister? Like siphon off email addresses, credit card number, or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>passwords?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What to Do?<br/>
&gt; Think twice about how free &quot;free&quot; advertising-based software really is,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; whether it&#39;s worth the loss of privacy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re considering using advertising-supported free software, ask the<br/>

&gt; Ask The Expert<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Q: We&#39;re planning on installing a local area network - we have around<br/>
 </span></blockquote>twenty<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; PCs, between two offices, as well as half a dozen laptops. What security<br/>
&gt; precautions should we consider?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A: It is recommended that you first determine what it is you want to<br/>
&gt; protect. For the purposes of discussion, it&#39;s assumed that it is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>information<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you ultimately want to protect. If so, then you should identify who &quot;owns&quot;<br/>
&gt; that information (a business owner and not always the system<br/>
 </span></blockquote>administrator);<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; who the owner wants to grant access to the information to; and over what<br/>
&gt; systems, networks, databases, and applications that access is to be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>granted.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The more sensitive the information, the more safeguards you have to employ<br/>
&gt; to protect that information.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another point to consider is how critical the information is to the<br/>
&gt; company&#39;s operations. How long can your company continue to operate<br/>
 </span></blockquote>without<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the availability of the information? The more critical information is to<br/>
&gt; your business operations, the more safeguards you have to implement to<br/>
&gt; ensure its availability.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Typical security precautions, however, include the following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Inventory and baseline your systems, networks, and peripheral equipment.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s virtually impossible to do an effective job of protecting your<br/>
&gt; architecture if you don&#39;t know what you have to protect.<br/>
&gt; Institute configuration control procedures and review the impact to your<br/>
&gt; overall security environment from any subsequent system/network changes.<br/>
&gt; Put the LAN server and routers behind locked doors in a room or<br/>
&gt; well-ventilated closet with physical access restricted to the absolute<br/>
&gt; minimum number of people on your staff.<br/>
&gt; Ensure users have to log-in with effective IDs and passwords before being<br/>
&gt; granted access to the system.<br/>
&gt; Establish a one-time password capability (like SecureID or Safeword<br/>
&gt; Softoken) for your employees when they dial into the company&#39;s system<br/>
&gt; through an extranet modem pool or over the Internet via IP connection.<br/>
&gt; Audit user activities while in the system. Simply making sure they have<br/>
&gt; access isn&#39;t enough. You want to be able to know what it is they are doing<br/>
&gt; in your system and make them accountable for their actions.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Harden&quot; your operating systems. If using NT, run the C2 configuration<br/>
&gt; utility from your Resource Toolkit. On Sun Solaris operating systems,<br/>
&gt; consider stripping out unnecessary commands like the &quot;r commands&quot; or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;tftp&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if not essential to business operations.<br/>
&gt; Restrict the number of &quot;share&quot; drives or directories as well as how many<br/>
&gt; users can see files in those shared resources.<br/>
&gt; Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) on your router(s). You can filter<br/>
&gt; activity based upon IP packet criteria. Ensure that router activity is<br/>
&gt; logged and (as with Cisco routers) both levels of access to the router are<br/>
&gt; secured with ID/password access controls.<br/>
&gt; Encrypt your most sensitive information so that only those with a<br/>
&gt; &quot;need-to-know&quot; can decrypt it and read it.<br/>
&gt; Encrypt network traffic between critical or sensitive nodes on your<br/>
 </span></blockquote>network.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Encrypt email if you send sensitive information.<br/>
&gt; Utilize firewalls between critical LAN nodes/file servers/etc. and less<br/>
&gt; secure zones or the Internet. DON&#39;T poke so many holes in your firewall<br/>
&gt; business rules that it becomes essentially &quot;swiss cheese&quot; useless.<br/>
&gt; Purchase security cables and locks to secure your highly portable laptops<br/>
&gt; during business hours. Don&#39;t leave laptops out on the desk at night. Lock<br/>
&gt; them up in a drawer or take them home with you.<br/>
&gt; Install disk security and encryption on laptops so that if they are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>stolen,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the sensitive information on them is not compromised.<br/>
&gt; If you can afford to, hire an information security expert to help you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>build<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a Security Risk Management Program.<br/>
&gt; Document security procedures and policies. Enforce them. Monitor<br/>
&gt; system/network use to ensure compliance with policy and procedures.<br/>
&gt; Draft up an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for email, Internet, and system<br/>
 </span></blockquote>use.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Familiarize and sensitize your staff with security awareness through<br/>
&gt; informational media and some sort of orientation program.<br/>
&gt; Make sure all laptops and home computers have the same protection as<br/>
&gt; business PCs so employees don&#39;t take hidden risks to work with them. </span></blockquote></div>
