&gt;   I<br/>
&gt; &gt; said that once on a list or in a forum with a lot of Christian <br/>
&gt; homeschoolers<br/>
&gt; &gt; (it was several years back before there was much separation) and one mom<br/>
&gt; &gt; snapped back very defensively &quot;TRUST ME, my kid is NOT the second coming.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I felt really bad for her child.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of a wonderful story I&#39;ve read/heard in a number of contexts:<br/>
There was a monastery located in the outskirts of a town, that had not had <br/>
anybody join it in years. Many of the monks had died, and it was down to the <br/>
last eight monks, who were responsible for keeping the monastery up. They <br/>
were worried about how the monastery was going to function in the future as <br/>
they got older. Thus they passed their day worrying, and because they were <br/>
worrying they bickered a lot, until the bickering and the worrying just <br/>
became normal. And so they passed their days in this state. One day, a <br/>
stranger showed up on their door step and announced to them that one of them <br/>
was the messiah. The stranger was greeted with derision at first, the monks <br/>
thinking this was nonsense. Each monk looked around the table at the seven <br/>
other monks, and thought to himself, well it couldn’t be that monk, because <br/>
he eats too much, and it couldn’t be that monk, because he does a horrible <br/>
job of building, and it couldn’t be that monk because he is too loud. Each <br/>
monk then thought, &quot;well maybe its me, maybe I am the messiah. Well I don’t <br/>
know, I’m not so good either.&quot; Pretty soon though, the monks were looking at <br/>
each other a little differently. &quot;Ok, so Sam is loud, he does have a kind <br/>
heart.&quot; Each of the monks began treating each other as if the other was the <br/>
messiah. Pretty soon, the bickering stopped and the worrying stopped, because <br/>
each was too concerned with treating the others as the messiah should be <br/>
treated. Pretty soon, the word got around that there was this monastery where <br/>
the monks treated each other with extraordinary kindness, and people began to <br/>
visit. Soon enough people began to join, and the monastery was able to <br/>
reinvigorate itself, and the monks were delighted that the monastery was a <br/>
place of happiness and peace again.<br/>
