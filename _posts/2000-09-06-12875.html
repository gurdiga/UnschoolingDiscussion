<div id="ygrps-yiv-47446375">&quot;In all seriousness, do you think it&#39;s possible for someone who is<br/>
racist to the bone to change?  (I know you said stupid, not racist...but<br/>
it is sometimes interchangeable)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know whether he was ever racist &quot;to the bone&quot;, but my father<br/>
once told me that when JFK was shot he was glad. . .one less<br/>
n****r-lover in the world.  He said it with a great deal of regret,<br/>
looking back on the boy (well, teen-ager) he was then from the<br/>
perspective of the man he&#39;s become.  He&#39;s now a great advocate for<br/>
racial tolerance and embraces the students of the school at which he is<br/>
guidance counselor (98% are African- and/or Latin- American) with love<br/>
and respect.  Several of them have mentioned that he changed their views<br/>
on the &quot;White race&quot; single-handedly (he was the first pale-face they<br/>
ever met who DIDN&#39;T look down on them).  And he goes to great lengths to<br/>
make sure the teachers and staff of the school, as well as the students,<br/>
are educated on a great many topics (like aspects of history and<br/>
geography having to do with persons of the students&#39; rather than the<br/>
administration&#39;s ethnic backgrounds) which were never addressed at the<br/>
school before he got there.  My best friend jokingly calls him her<br/>
&quot;White daddy&quot;, and he considers her an extra daughter.  When I told him<br/>
we&#39;d decided that if anything happened to us she&#39;d be the one to raise<br/>
my son, he applauded it as an excellent choice and said she was just who<br/>
he would have chosen.  He didn&#39;t even mention her hot-cocoa coloring. .<br/>
.it&#39;s not what&#39;s important to him, any more.<br/>
<br/>
What did it for him was intimate exposure.  It started when he was in<br/>
his early teens, and started spending summers with his grandparents and<br/>
the African-American woman who helped out with the housework they<br/>
couldn&#39;t do anymore, and escalated when he entered the Navy and found<br/>
himself in a mixed company.  (When push came to shove, the unit split<br/>
into two social groups along geographic rather than race lines. . .he<br/>
and the other White Southerners decided they&#39;d rather hang out with the<br/>
OTHER Southerners than the damn Yankees.)  He got to really know some<br/>
people of color then, and after then, and gradually came to see that the<br/>
attitudes about race he&#39;d been taught growing up, the ones that were<br/>
universally accepted in Memphis and Mississippi in the 1950s and early<br/>
60s when his worldview was being formed, were simply unfounded.  By the<br/>
time I hit highschool, he didn&#39;t have any objection to my dating across<br/>
race lines, though he felt it important to mention that I might want to<br/>
move out of the South if I decided to have &quot;mixed&quot; children.  And today,<br/>
he proudly points out pictures of his uncles and grandfather and states<br/>
his conviction that we, ourselves, must be mixed (there&#39;s a &quot;missing&quot;<br/>
great-grandfather on his side, and that&#39;s his theory as to why granny&#39;s<br/>
lips stayed sealed).  It certainly doesn&#39;t show in me (I&#39;m another<br/>
glow-in-the-dark type), but he&#39;s probably right; my grandmother&#39;s<br/>
brother looks eerily like Gregory Hinds after a few weeks of summer sun.<br/>
Most of his cousins would like to string him up (no, I&#39;m not joking).<br/>
Maybe they never had the opportunity he had to learn first-hand how<br/>
wrong what they were all taught is.  Maybe it takes a kind of openness<br/>
that he has and they don&#39;t.  Maybe the spirits of our ancestors picked<br/>
him out specially to work on the hatred and bigotry into which he was<br/>
born.  Maybe he just got lucky.  I don&#39;t know how or why he was able to<br/>
overcome his racism.  But he did.<br/>
<br/>
So I, for one, not only believe but KNOW it&#39;s possible to change that<br/>
kind of thinking. . .though only in yourself.<br/>

thought I had to answer this question.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-355125653">Hi Misty,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rather new to the group also.  Your post on the AAH list was most<br/>
helpful during one of the flame wars that occurred not too long ago.  The<br/>
points you made about race are good and have made me more reflective and<br/>
open to the possibility that racists can change.  I grew up in Mississippi<br/>
and got into several scrapes because I wasn&#39;t going to put up with the junk<br/>
racists used to say and do (and sometimes still say, if not blatantly do)!<br/>
Things haven&#39;t changed all that much in some parts of the South.  My husband<br/>
tells a story of traveling to Mississippi from Texas  (for a family funeral)<br/>
at the time of JFK&#39;s death.   In fact, they were on there way to<br/>
Philadelphia, MS.<br/>
<br/>
Many people were thrilled to see JFK fall.  Apparently the flags were not at<br/>
half staff in MS and many kids cheered in schools around the state when his<br/>
assassination was announced on the intercom.<br/>
<br/>
Somethings have changed----but not nearly enough.  Periodically, I return to<br/>
the state and think somewhat wistfully of moving back to some of the family<br/>
land.  Then I encounter another blatant racists and come to my senses!<br/>
Thanks for sharing the uplifting story about your father.  There does appear<br/>
to be hope!<br/>
