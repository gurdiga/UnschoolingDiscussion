<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535943841">I&#39;ve a question for all regarding pets.  My daughter desperately wants a<br/>
pet for herself, something she can cuddle with a night, small enough to pick<br/>
and, one that is active enough to play with her, but not wildish temperament<br/>
  And that could take the heat of Israel....We will probably purchase the<br/>
animal in Israel at this point. Any suggestions where we could go to<br/>
research?  For a number of years she had her heart set on a rabbit, but we<br/>
just couldn&#39;t afford it at the time, and now she isn&#39;t sure of a rabbit<br/>
anyway.  I&#39;m really looking for a place on the internet we could search<br/>
together, but a suggestion of a pet is fine also. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the ideas folks!<br/>

be well,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425371650">My son has a rabbit.  They CAN be cuddly and they are very smart.   He found <br/>
a lot of info on the net before he got the rabbit, he did all sorts of <br/>
research.  A small dog also seems like a good choice, or a cat.  But really, <br/>
pets are a lot like people, the have thier own personalities and its <br/>
difficult to determine how they will interact with thier owner.   Good luck <br/>
in your search.. OH.. be sure to check out adoption alternatives for your <br/>
pet.  There  are also lots of resources online for pet adoption.  You can <br/>
save some $$ and also save an animal.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d second what Teresa said. Personality is a big factor. Purebreeds are<br/>
often breed for specific traits and temperatments so if you go that route<br/>
you stand a better chance of getting a particular type of personality. But<br/>
there&#39;s still the chance factor. So some good books or websites on cats or<br/>
dogs should give you some ideas about the temperaments of the various<br/>
breeds. (My daughter suggests rag doll and ocicat as two to look at.)<br/>
<br/>
If you adopt an older pet you can pick by personality. A good shelter could<br/>
give you some ideas about the personalities of the ones they have. If you<br/>
get friendly with the volunteers they might keep an eye out for a particular<br/>
personality.<br/>

back they will be in lock down quarantine for 6 months when you come to the <br/>
us.  At least this is what it was years ago when we came back from Taiwan.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-286874930">If you are thinking of adoption, which I think is wonderful. make sure you <br/>
don&#39;t also rule out older dogs or cats. Most are already housebroken and in <br/>
need of a loving home. You already know their size and all too. Most <br/>
shelters, at least I would hope, try to find out about the dogs they are <br/>
adopting out. And if you adopt a puppy, try to find out exactly what&#39;s in <br/>
it. My sister adopted the cutest little black dog once and named her Pixie. <br/>
Well Pixie ended up being 65lbs. Not exactly what they had in mind.<br/>

Our neighbors have a puppy they&#39;re  neglecting and when it gets loose from <br/>

will be a part of their family for 15 or more years). They&#39;ll debate ad <br/>
nauseum whether they should get leather or cloth, sun roof or not, blue or <br/>
green. But they&#39;ll walk into a pet store or a shelter and pick out the puppy <br/>
that runs up to them first or has the cutest eyes. It&#39;s a life-long <br/>

all.. But she does have a LOT of energy, and labs tend to stay in the &quot;puppy&quot; <br/>
stage longer than other breeds.   Joy is one year old and actually, shes not <br/>
as hyper as we expected her to be.   This is just another example of pet <br/>
personality.   Even among breeds that are supposed to have certain traits or <br/>
qualities, there is always room for personality differences.   The breed <br/>
thats is supposed to most loyal might turn out to be the dog that doesnt give <br/>
a flip about where his food comes from and long as he gets it.. LOL.. And, <br/>
the breed that is supposed to be a ferocious gaurd dog might end up lying on <br/>
the sofa letting burgulars ramsack your house.. And, the sweet little lap dog <br/>
might end up being the one that bites your neighbor in the crotch..  A person <br/>
searching for a pet should do research on breeds and traits and dispositions <br/>
of dogs.  At least it gives you a basis for making a decision.  But, in the <br/>
end, its just the luck of the draw what &quot;kind&quot; of dog you end up with..  We <br/>
certainly got lucky with Joy.. she is a real sweetie.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747608803">Thank you all for your suggestions, but:<br/>
<br/>
I need to add something here...since I see a lot of people are suggesting a<br/>
dog.<br/>
We have family pets already, one dog, one cat (dogs a basset hound...one of<br/>
the best types for kids, imho.) What my Esther is looking for is her own,<br/>
just mine, pet.  The one she can take into bed with her at night (she sleeps<br/>
on a bunk bed) who&#39;ll be her friend when she needs a friend.. etc. etc. <br/>
Dogs and cats are pretty much out, I think, in her mind. She wants something<br/>
different.  Large enough to cuddle, small enough to pick up.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for being unclear...hey, the info was in my mind, you mean you<br/>
couldn&#39;t read it? LOL...and people blame me because they aren&#39;t psychic, go<br/>
figure...<br/>
<br/>
What I really need, and I saw it once but can&#39;t find it again, is a actual<br/>
search tool that lets you plug in your criterion and come out with the<br/>
perfect pet for you--- or in this case my Esther.<br/>

<br/>
As for other critters, rabbits are very sweet, can be litterbox trained and <br/>
allowed the run of the house (or at least the room &lt;g&gt;). Again, look around <br/>
seriously. Don&#39;t go for the first one you see. There are many breeds of <br/>
rabbits---each with different characteristics. The larger rabbits tend to be <br/>
&quot;sweeter&quot; and more kid-friendly, but heavy; the smaller ones, more skittish <br/>
and jumpy, but easier for small hands/arms---but there are always exceptions. <br/>
Best to buy one that&#39;s been socialized with humans from the get-go. Again, go <br/>
to a rabbit show. Talk with many breeders. Get informed. Make an educated <br/>
decision, a wise choice. It&#39;s a lifelong commitment.<br/>
<br/>
Rats are GREAT pets---check the archives for more info. They&#39;ve been <br/>
discussed several times here. And there are TONS of websites. Check &quot;fancy <br/>
rats&quot;, though.<br/>
<br/>
Ferrets don&#39;t do much for me---but they have their fans. Illegal in some <br/>
states.<br/>
<br/>
Chinchillas---I have NO experience, but they could be good. (I don&#39;t know <br/>
whether they &quot;cuddle&quot;. Totally ignorant here.)<br/>
<br/>
Generally, I&#39;d rule out mice, gerbils, and hamsters (although I like them <br/>
all, when they get out, they&#39;re often GONE).<br/>
<br/>
Any help at all?<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly, the hopeless rodent fan (and we lost the second of our two ratties <br/>
day before yesterday :-( )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-822988069">Can a rabbit sleep on a top bunk??  I mean sleep, maybe, but get up and down? <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Cats tend to sleep wherever they want to, instead of with their &quot;owner.&quot;  One <br/>
slept on me all through half of October and November and then decided to go <br/>
elsewhere for no discernable reason.  <br/>
<br/>
Our dog sleeps with the kid who goes to sleep last.  Maybe a herding thing.  <br/>
&quot;Now that you&#39;re down, STAY down.&quot;  She was chosen as a puppy by Marty, from <br/>
the pound, after we went to both county pounds and back to the first one.  <br/>
She was with her mom and two littermates.  He wanted a dog that wouldn&#39;t get <br/>
too big.  She&#39;s bigger than her mom was.  We didn&#39;t know when we picked her <br/>
what kind of dog she was until other people started saying &quot;Oh! a blue <br/>
heeler!&quot;  Pam Hartley told me the &quot;real&quot; name (Australian cattle dog) so we <br/>
could look in books.  Sure enough.  But she&#39;s not as small as Marty had <br/>
hoped.  She makes up for that by being smarter than any of us could have <br/>
imagined.<br/>

When we go for walks, Gudrun, the dog, doesn&#39;t like for us to get separated.  <br/>
Holly often goes ahead (on a bike or skates) and I walk, talking, lazily, <br/>
with whoever else.  Gudrun goes back and forth, accusing me of neglect, and <br/>
trying to get me to either hurry up or call Holly back!  I tell her to go on <br/>
with Holly.  She often does.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite communication with her (&quot;command,&quot; but it&#39;s more like &quot;how about <br/>
it, huh?&quot; with her) is &quot;go home.&quot;  It&#39;s relative to where she is.  <br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re a block from home and I say &quot;go home&quot; she runs happily to the yard <br/>
and waits for me.  If we&#39;re in the yard she goes in to the house on &quot;go <br/>
home.&quot;  She&#39;s pretty wonderful.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our &quot;dog door&quot; is in a single window frame next to the back door.  Inside, <br/>
there&#39;s a old endtable made to go next to a low couch, so there&#39;s the bigger <br/>
table part, and the higher lamp part, and that&#39;s the &quot;stile&quot; from the inside.<br/>
<br/>
Outside is a platform we found broken behind the bowling alley.  I don&#39;t kow <br/>
what it was for.  It&#39;s just basically a 2x4 table with plywood.  We used to <br/>
have another box near it but the cats didnt need it and the dog got bigger.  <br/>
Now that we&#39;re training our neighbor&#39;s puppy to come on in whenever he can <br/>
get off the leash, we need a step for him.  He can get out, but not back in.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of a stair of furniture for the dog to get down from the bunk <br/>
too.  Maybe a high-backed upholstered chair so he could jump on the back and <br/>
then the seat.  Like an old recliner, with a beanbag on a shelf behind it.   <br/>
(You can imagine, my house is not decorator-approved.)<br/>

I&#39;m pretty certain Ladybug would and could walk up the catwalk with the right <br/>
motivation (like a cat up there on the perch).  I&#39;m glad his cats always hide <br/>
from us when we come to visit.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Will&#39;s room is 10x10, and with the drumset and baseball paraphenalia <br/>
collection, there&#39;s barely room for his bed!  But maybe someday.  :)  <br/>

out of their spacious pen at our old house.  We had a sunroom that closes off <br/>
from the rest of the house.  They went through doggie door through the wall, <br/>
out onto a dogwalk attached to the deck, down the hatch in the dogwalk and a <br/>
stairway down to ground level, a little hop through one vent opening in <br/>
foundation of sunroom and then out the other side, into the pen.  The pen was <br/>
equipped with an electric fence to prevent the leaper from getting out (which <br/>
only had to shock her once, and then was off permanently).  They didn&#39;t even <br/>
have to go out in the rain to use the bathroom, since they had 400 sq feet of <br/>
covered dirt under the sunroom!  <br/>
<br/>
We could leave them in the sunroom for 3 days with food and water and they <br/>
would be just fine, except for missing us. <br/>
