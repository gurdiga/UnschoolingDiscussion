&gt; &gt; Perhaps the person should be silenced in that particular thread.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And if you grant *a segment* of the population the right to silence<br/>
someone<br/>
&gt; for reasons you agree with then you grant *a segment* of the population<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; right to silence someone for reasons you *disagree* with. What if a vocal<br/>
&gt; group of fundamentalists decides Harry Potter and Halloween shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; discussed here since some fundamentalists left because of such<br/>
discussions?<br/>
&gt; (Or pick some other subject that might bother some people that you feel<br/>
&gt; strongly in favor of.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If everyone agreed (or no one disagreed) that something should be a<br/>
certain<br/>
&gt; way, then it should be changed to be that way. But I think the length and<br/>
&gt; number of people involved in this particular discussion makes it pretty<br/>
&gt; clear that not everyone does agree.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyone who has ever done public speaking knows that you can do one of<br/>
two<br/>
&gt; &gt; things, do it your way regardless of the audience and hope that at least<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone in the audience &quot;gets&quot; what you are saying OR you can gage your<br/>
&gt; &gt; approach so that it fits the immediate situation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How about the option of *knowing* that a segment of the population that<br/>
&gt; *won&#39;t* be reached another way *is* getting it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think the 2nd choice is valuable to someone whose goals are to reach as<br/>
&gt; many people as possible. What if that isn&#39;t someone&#39;s goal? What if<br/>
they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; goal is to reach the type of people that are best helped by their method?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why should there be just one goal for everyone who speaks in public?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I think a suggestion should be added to the &quot;potential email<br/>
reminders&quot;<br/>
&gt; that people should feel free to delete the posts of anyone whose style<br/>
&gt; annoys them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The suggested emails were sent to the list so *the list* could have input<br/>
and constructively criticize them. Or discuss how the whole thing isn&#39;t a<br/>
good idea. Or offer something else. Had I wanted to railroad my ideas<br/>
through I would have taken up Helen&#39;s offer to be a moderator and sent them<br/>
out in an official capacity as a done deal. But I feel strongly that the<br/>
list should decide how to moderate itself and what the role of the<br/>
moderators is, not the moderators. Others are certainly welcome to their own<br/>
strong feelings and to make their own suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
If you have problems with the language then please quote and suggest<br/>
something different. &quot;Sounds more like school at home&quot; is too vague to be<br/>
helpful.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you see how a flame war could start -- whether caused by something on<br/>
list or off -- if there&#39;s a policy of no discussions about the discussion?<br/>
I&#39;m willing to clarify the wording if you can suggest something.<br/>
<br/>
Though I think contacting someone is the mature way to handle personal<br/>
differences, some people can feel free to say things privately that they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t dare say on list. Perhaps a suggestion that people keep all<br/>
correspondence dealing with a difficult poster until the differences are<br/>
settled so everyone keeps in mind that anything they say privately can be<br/>
turned over to the moderators? I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the best solution or not.<br/>
Suggestions/discussion are more than welcome.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a possibility. I&#39;ll ask Helen before putting her on as a contact. Or<br/>
perhaps as the contact if the moderators can&#39;t resolve something. She&#39;s<br/>
mentioned a number of times over the years that she trusts people to be able<br/>
to monitor themselves. I interpret that as meaning she doesn&#39;t want to be<br/>
our babysitter. I will check to make sure I wasn&#39;t assuming too much.<br/>
