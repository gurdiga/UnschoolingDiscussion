 </span></blockquote>I know that even within the medical field it is accepted that college <br/>
education is not the be all and end all.  I know Jackson (for this state and for his <br/>
FP certification) he must complete 150 CME credits ( I believe that is the <br/>
number) per year.  Those credits can be seminars and conferences attended but <br/>
also medical or hospital meetings, medical journals, meetings with mentors and <br/>
experts in other medical specialties etc.  All count toward those credits.  Your <br/>
learning is varied, and does not stop once you receive your MD.<br/>
<br/>
Also to specialize at all you need to go through residency which is very <br/>
little of what is considered &quot;traditional book work&quot; it is almost all mentoring, <br/>
group work, on the job training with a specialist, etc.  Yes, you need to <br/>
attend college, and yes, you do need to pass a couple of board exams but that is <br/>
not the end of it.<br/>
<br/>
I know it isn&#39;t a story about a doctor who never attended a day of college <br/>
but it was the best I could do.....<br/>
