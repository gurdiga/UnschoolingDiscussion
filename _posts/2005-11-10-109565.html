<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649432715">Susan&#39;s sttatement &quot;I realise that part of my problem is that I value  <br/>
reading more than some of you&quot; got me to thinking.<br/>
<br/>
It often seems that if someone isn&#39;t working directly towards  <br/>
something it looks like they don&#39;t care if they reach that goal.<br/>
<br/>
That isn&#39;t always the case. And in the case of unschooling it isn&#39;t  <br/>
at all true.<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling, the primary goal is living a joyful life in an  <br/>
environment that&#39;s loving and supportive of who a child is.  <br/>
Unschoolers *know* that by pursuing that goal, reading (and other  <br/>
learning) will happen as a side effect. But since we aren&#39;t actively  <br/>
working towards reading or math or science or getting into college,  <br/>
it seems like we don&#39;t care if those things happen or not.<br/>
<br/>
We all want our kids to learn how to speak. And yet when our kids are  <br/>
infants and toddlers we aren&#39;t consciously pursuing the goal of  <br/>
getting them to speak! We&#39;re confident that as long as we&#39;re living  <br/>
life with them they&#39;ll speak. It&#39;s just a natural part of getting  <br/>
older for kids and we don&#39;t even need to think about it.<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean we don&#39;t care if they speak or not?<br/>
<br/>
No, it just means we know that speaking happens as a natural side  <br/>
effect of living life.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s how unschooling works. It&#39;s about being confident that  <br/>
learning happens as a side effect of life.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not all. Like learning to speak, learning in general  <br/>
doesn&#39;t happen in a vacuum. If we don&#39;t speak to infants and toddlers  <br/>
they&#39;re not going to learn how to speak. If we don&#39;t create an  <br/>
&quot;unschooling environment&quot;, kids&#39; learning is going to be limited.<br/>
<br/>
So what is an unschooling environment?<br/>
<br/>
I like Deb&#39;s quote:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling works well when parents understand learning is natural and<br/>
&gt; does not need to be forced.  Unschooling works well when children are<br/>
&gt; respected.   Unschooling works well when parents are generous with  <br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; time, love, attention, possessions and money.  Unschooling works well<br/>
&gt; when parents are interesting, positive, thoughtful, considerate,<br/>
&gt; generous, passionate, honest, respectful individuals.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would add in curious about the world since that will help parents  <br/>
naturally bring the world to their children just because they think  <br/>
it&#39;s interesting.<br/>
<br/>
And I would also point out that thoughtful is a part of attention.  <br/>
Thinking about them and pointing out or bringing home something they  <br/>
might like, helping them further explore what they&#39;re actions say  <br/>
interests them (which -- in addition to the interests like astronomy  <br/>
and analytical calculus that we might be looking for if we&#39;re still  <br/>
stuck in school mode -- might be comedy movies or video games or ATVs  <br/>
or ...)<br/>
