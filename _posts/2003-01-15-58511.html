<div id="ygrps-yiv-672042165">Adriane (12) was painfully shy when she was little.  Everyone talked about<br/>
how well behaved she was, but really she just didn&#39;t want anyone looking at<br/>
her so she kept a very low profile.  She has always had friends but they<br/>
always sought her out, not the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
Then she found her passion, gymnastics and animals.  She was able to<br/>
overcome her shyness to talk with people about what she loved, to get<br/>
answers to questions, etc..  And it has bled over into her life in general.<br/>
She has been an officer in her 4-H club for 2 years now and often gives<br/>
reports in front of 40-50 people.  She still isn&#39;t the life of the party and<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to try out for the play but she is happy and functioning<br/>
socially well enough to meet her needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424188972">Hello,<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking on this list for awhile, absorbing new ideas and <br/>
seeing some amazing changes within myself and my approach with my <br/>
kids.  I always thought I was a pretty relaxed homeschooler, but now <br/>
I see that I was relaxed as long as everyone was going along with MY <br/>
agenda.  (So, not relaxed at all, really!)<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve been struggling with is how my daughters interact in <br/>
social situations.  They are ages 8 and 11, both shy, and reluctant <br/>
to try new things.  They have a few close friends, but these are <br/>
mostly daughters of my friends, and not necessarily homeschoolers.  <br/>
When we do go to a homeschool gathering, they often feel <br/>
uncomfortable because they have trouble getting plugged into the <br/>
group, and instead kind of hang around on the outskirts.  Then they <br/>
don&#39;t want to go back because they felt uncomfortable.<br/>
I was really shy as a kid, and so seeing them go through it makes me <br/>
want to avoid the whole group thing, which of course isolates them <br/>
further.<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d like some feedback on how the philosophy of unschooling <br/>
plays in with socialization issues.  How much do I push them to try <br/>
new things?  Do I let them set their own pace, even when they say <br/>
they want more friends but won&#39;t initiate anything?<br/>
I don&#39;t encounter too many other shy kids, and really never see <br/>
anything written about this in homeschool journals.  Anyone have any <br/>
ideas or experiences to share?<br/>
Thanks so much for all you do--you have really helped me to question <br/>
a lot of my parenting/homeschooling practices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882948753">Hi Joanne,<br/>
I too have two shy daughters too.   Mine are 6 and 8 and  I follow their<br/>
lead as to how much socialization they get.  If they don&#39;t want to go to<br/>
something, we don&#39;t go.  At first I felt like we needed  more socialization<br/>
but on further reflection, I don&#39;t think we do. We are doing what makes us<br/>
comfortable and just because we are different than the majority of the<br/>
population, there is nothing wrong with us that needs fixing.  <br/>
 <br/>
My girls are best friends with each other and with my brother&#39;s kids, who<br/>
are also homeschooled.  They also are great friends with another cousin who<br/>
is in public school but unfortunately we don&#39;t see much of her with her busy<br/>
schedule.  We have a few other friends/acquaintances who we visit sometimes,<br/>
but the kids just haven&#39;t hit it off.  We have all acknowledged that we<br/>
would like to have one other family that we really connect with and we are<br/>
trying to find that someone now, not because we should, but because we would<br/>
like to have someone else to play with and visit during the week.  <br/>
 <br/>
My girls aren&#39;t comfortable in group situations at all.  It has gotten a<br/>
*little* easier as they have gotten a little older, but they prefer, like<br/>
me, to play or visit with one family at a time.  It took me awhile to feel<br/>
ok with this, mostly because other people put the pressure on us to be in a<br/>
group.  As an adult, I prefer to have a couple close friends rather than a<br/>
large group of acquaintances and that ok for my kids too.  I realize that<br/>
society thinks socialization only happens in large groups, but it just isn&#39;t<br/>
true.<br/>
 <br/>
When we do go to group events, my girls are often happy watching from the<br/>
sidelines.  If your girls want more friends, I would ask someone from the<br/>
group that you think might be a good fit over to your house so you can get<br/>
to know them on a more personal level.  When I have done this I try to have<br/>
an activity available so the kids can warm up to each other gradually, like<br/>
a painting or craft project or a walk to the neighbors farm.<br/>
 <br/>
I hope this helps.  Keep in mind that if your kids went to public school,<br/>
they would most likely draw further into themselves, not turn into little<br/>
extroverts.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221923301">Just wondering since your daughter seems to want friends, if maybe you could <br/>
hang around with her and others to kind of break the ice. I don&#39;t think the <br/>
age is too much where they would not like you hanging around. I know I did <br/>
this with one of my daughters when she was younger. It helped her to see how <br/>
to go about new social situations. You know, the whole modeling thing. I <br/>
would go over with her to a group or even just one or two other girls, say <br/>
hi, ask names and introduce Sierra and just start talking. Now she has no <br/>
problems at all doing this herself. Of course she doesn&#39;t always get names <br/>
but at 7, that doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem. It really didn&#39;t take her long <br/>
to start going out on her own at the playground. Now she&#39;s fine with <br/>
homeschooling kids, school kids and she&#39;s working on adults.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is something I wish I had done more with Lars.  We used to go to a<br/>
homeschoolers&#39; swim, and I could have gotten him involved a lot more by<br/>
doing just what you said.  At the time, I rationalized that the kids could<br/>
socialize with each other, but I needed adult socialization.  I guess I<br/>
thought he could manage it himself, but he didn&#39;t really.  He eventually<br/>
learned on his own, but he missed out on becoming friends with some really<br/>
nice homeschooling kids.  He ended up making friends with kids on his sports<br/>
teams who all go to school.<br/>
