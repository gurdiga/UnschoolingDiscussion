<div id="ygrps-yiv-693339677">Want to let others know that for the past three years (since we <br/>
started hsing), we have naturally &quot;fell&quot; into the unschooling <br/>
lifestyle. Not by anything I did, as a matter of fact, until I <br/>
started reading about unschooling, I didn&#39;t realize that&#39;s what we <br/>
were doing! :) Sometimes I think it&#39;s better NOT to research <br/>
everything to death, (for me anyway, then I &quot;think&quot; too much about <br/>
doing things &quot;the right way&quot;)<br/>
We are Christian and have to say that for us, it&#39;s all about how God <br/>
has directed our lifestyle. Just wanted to add that in since there <br/>
seems to be the misconception that &quot;fundies/ Christians&quot; are pushy, <br/>
strict, &quot;school at home&quot; types, or anit-home/unschooling. This is not <br/>
the case for all,, the same could be said about any religion/ and or <br/>
beliefs. (bigotry is what it is, regardless of what you call <br/>
yourself, if anything)<br/>
We don&#39;t judge others, just love them and I never force anything on <br/>
my kids, they see from &quot;how&quot; my husband and I live, and NOT from what <br/>
we &quot;teach&quot;. <br/>
So if you are new to unschooling, try not to exclude yourself from <br/>
others based on their or your religion. <br/>
Personally, we hang out w/ lots of different types of people that <br/>
have varying beliefs and religions. Of course living in FL helps w/ <br/>
that as it&#39;s a very diverse state. <br/>

&lt;&lt; Just wanted to add that in since there <br/>
<br/>
seems to be the misconception that &quot;fundies/ Christians&quot; are pushy, <br/>
<br/>
strict, &quot;school at home&quot; types, or anit-home/unschooling. This is not <br/>
<br/>
the case for all, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just because it&#39;s not the case for all doesn&#39;t make it a misconception.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;the same could be said about any religion/ and or beliefs. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Like what?  Do you know of another group who advocate pushy, strict <br/>
school-at-home and who badmouth unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;(bigotry is what it is, regardless of what you call <br/>
<br/>
yourself, if anything)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you think people who believe that strict school-at-home parents are <br/>
statistically likely to be Christians are bigots?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We don&#39;t judge others&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Who are those bigots you just referred to then?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So if you are new to unschooling, try not to exclude yourself from <br/>
<br/>
others based on their or your religion. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s good advice to anyone, but the most exclusionary people you will find <br/>
will be Christian homeschoolers in statement-of-faith groups.  They&#39;ll even <br/>
exclude other Christians.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re a Christian who happens to be a homeschooler who is unaware of the <br/>
massive Christian homeschooling movement, you should look into it and not deny <br/>
that it exists.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some starting places, which were not at all hard to find.  They are <br/>
some of hundreds:<br/>

A quote from that last one:<br/>
<br/>
Some of the areas in which we want to encourage moms. <br/>
*   Homeschooling<br/>
*   Wearing dresses<br/>
*   Not limiting the number of children<br/>
*   Conservative Christian music<br/>
*   Submission to husbands<br/>
*   Avoiding make-believe characters in celebrating holidays or special events<br/>
*   Biblical child raising<br/>
*   No sports<br/>
*   No television <br/>
*   Sheltering children<br/>
<br/>
While moms who do not hold these same views or convictions are welcome at <br/>
MOMSBoard, you need to know that we don&#39;t approve posts supporting or endorsing <br/>
something different from this, particularly in these areas. <br/>

<br/>
So if people think THIS e-mail loop is limited in scope, I think our few <br/>
rules are nearly nothing compared to that.  (And for anyone who missed seeing the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since mine was the post that started it, I&#39;ll just let you know that <br/>
I had checked out the groups in my area, and attended more than one <br/>
meeting with an open mind.  The groups turned out to be school-at-<br/>
homers and very isolationist -- one leader shared that she did not <br/>
let her children play with neighborhood children, ever.  Every group <br/>
in my area has a description listed that states very similar <br/>
principles.  That&#39;s why I said &quot;not for me,&quot; which is my right.<br/>
<br/>
I am pretty interfaith, and Christianity is still a big part of my <br/>
spirituality.  I do not believe all Christians are pushy, etc., but <br/>
in my particular area the homeschooling community is made up of <br/>
fundamentalist, isolationist, strict school-at-homers.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t go into this in my first post because I knew that people on <br/>
this list would know what I meant -- we&#39;ve had this discussion <br/>
before, as the archives will show.<br/>

years and we have been excluded from participation after years of service and friendship <br/>
with those involved due to a change of belief.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the Statements of Faith are to keep out anyone not of like mind.<br/>
<br/>
And unschooling is often seen as humanistic. First hand experience here to offer as <br/>
support.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Sandra,<br/>
It&#39;s unfortunate that there has been a bad experience among many, as <br/>
it seems, from those that &quot;call&quot; themselves Christian. It is sad that <br/>
is the case.<br/>
Yes, there are many strict types, however, I do personally know of <br/>
other faiths and  groups that do promote their agenda, exlude others <br/>
from their &quot;groups&quot; and socialization is limited w/ others. <br/>
To be honest, a lot of Christian Unschoolers are out here, but feel <br/>
like they are attacked either way, from both sides if they speak up. <br/>
One from the &quot;my way is the only way group, and the Christian <br/>
bashers&quot;. <br/>
I really don&#39;t see what difference it makes that any group has a <br/>
statement of faith, that is what our country is all about. Freedom of <br/>
speech and freedom to choose.  I do not, and know many who feel the <br/>
same, want to &quot;push&quot; my beliefs onto anyone. <br/>
BTW, I rarely wear dresses, (personal preference), jeans and cotton <br/>
shirts are my usual attire, love to wear make-up, have since I can <br/>
remember. We&#39;re not into &quot;dress codes&quot; in this family, to each <br/>
his/her own. Matter of fact,I wore hip jeans to church today, w/ <br/>
black studded belt, and polo shirt and sandals.  We listen to All <br/>
types of music, interact daily w/ so many different types of people, <br/>
go to interesting places and are constantly learning together. We are <br/>
subscribers to HEM, love it, and big John Holt fans. (which btw, I <br/>
didn&#39;t start reading until last year) oh, I like Dr. Phil too! :)<br/>
IMO, &quot;teach your own&quot;, by John Holt & Pat Farenga is a good book to <br/>
read to help people(regardless of faith,which I am including <br/>
Christians) that have problems w/ other groups beliefs and such get <br/>
past them. Question from above book, page 29, &quot;How are we going to <br/>
prevent parents with narrrow and bigoted ideas from passing these on <br/>
to their children?&quot; If anyone is interested in what follows please <br/>
check this book out, as I have already taken too much of Sandra&#39;s <br/>
time. <br/>
BTW, regardless of differences of opinion, I think this is a good <br/>
unschooling site! :)<br/>

<br/>
Blanket statements about any particular group aren&#39;t correct unless <br/>
<br/>
you know EVERYONE in that group.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Who knows everyone in any group?<br/>
Do we just stop talking or writing?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know every unschooler in the world, so should I not say anything abut <br/>
unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know every single person in Albuquerque, so should I say &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m <br/>
not qualified to say anything about people in Albuquerque because I don&#39;t know <br/>
them all&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why is it that in discussions <br/>
<br/>
about christian unschoolers there is usually a disclaimer added to <br/>
<br/>
any acknowledgement that maybe not ALL are the same, BUT......this <br/>
<br/>
rarely happens when another group is being discussed?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimers are good.<br/>
Without &quot;labels&quot; (nouns) and general statements, we can&#39;t discuss anything at <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There is no denying that people like the ones Sandra often describes <br/>
<br/>
exist.  But must we ALL be painted with the same brush? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.  If something doesn&#39;t apply to me I don&#39;t jump up and take it in the <br/>
face.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you <br/>
<br/>
(generally speaking)  want to use blanket statements for ease in <br/>
<br/>
making your point then there are going to be alot of people excluded <br/>
<br/>
from getting any benefit out of a discussion because of <br/>
<br/>
generalities.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe this is so.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nor do I.  This started with my post saying (paraphrased), <br/>
*&quot;I&#39;m looking for an unschooling group or at least a homeschooling <br/>
group that isn&#39;t fundamentalist and is committed to respectful, <br/>
attachment parenting, and <br/>
*here&#39;s what I&#39;ve explored, and <br/>
*I&#39;ve found that every known group in my area *is* fundamentalist and <br/>
is *not* practicing respectful parenting, and <br/>
*can you help me think of other things to explore?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think lots of people can benefit from some of the very good ideas <br/>
that the original post inspired.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
