<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995944039">If anyone has information about teacher discounts at stores or for services,<br/>
could you please let me know?  I&#39;ve heard of some from time to time, however<br/>
there doesn&#39;t seem to be a source for a list of them.  Not really looking<br/>
for online ones, more along the lines of physical stores.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you think they&#39;re just local, do post them or email me, ok?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>
<br/>
