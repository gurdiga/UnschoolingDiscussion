I am nearly in tears at reading your response. I got a lot of wonderful,<br/>
supportive feedback from the group and don&#39;t really have time to respond<br/>
(kid is hungry) but thank you so much for this.<br/>
Do you realize what a totally radical concept this is? This is the exact<br/>
opposite of what my parents would have done if I had hit one of them or<br/>
thrown any kind of tantrum, and I can&#39;t help but wonder how I would have<br/>
turned out if I&#39;d been allowed to express my feelings instead of being<br/>
punished. I am just blown away. Again, thank you!!<br/>
And to all the others who responded, thank you too. I&#39;ll try to write more<br/>
after dinner....<br/>
you are a great source of support and suggestions.<br/>

I know what you mean about these totally new and radical thoughts.  (New to some people anyway)     They are so different from how alot of us were raised, but yet they make so much sense.<br/>
