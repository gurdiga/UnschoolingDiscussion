<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225046108">and what a summer it has been.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like the list retains its usual &quot;flavor&quot;! :) I&#39;ll be peeking in <br/>
here frequently again, as I bolster my desire to really unschool the <br/>
kids. It&#39;s easy in summer; not quite so easy when friends ask &quot;When <br/>
will you be starting YOUR school year?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to be moving, which will be a boon: getting into a town, <br/>
closer access to more activities. I&#39;ve finally pulled out of a mild <br/>
to moderate depression that pretty much immobilized me, and ready to <br/>
face life again. <br/>
<br/>
so, happy posting.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC</div>

Good, and great!<br/>

I didn&#39;t even know school had started until as I was leaving from delivering <br/>
Kirby to work I saw the parking lot at the high school behind there FULL of <br/>
cars, and people leaving the building.  I rushed to get home before hundreds of <br/>

<br/>
I must be getting over school, too.  I didn&#39;t know school had started either<br/>
until I saw my mother take her foster kids to school yesterday.  I was like,<br/>
&quot;Why are they going to school, it&#39;s still summer!&quot;.   Poor kids.  They range<br/>
in age from 4-8.  Then I drove past the town pool and people were still<br/>
swimming.  It&#39;s going to be 90 here tomorrow and those kids are going to be<br/>
sitting in their classrooms.  Summer is not over for us.  It&#39;s over when<br/>
when the weather decides it&#39;s over, not when the calendar says it&#39;s over.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t do much to write about this summer, either, because it rained here<br/>
more than it was sunny.  We didn&#39;t get much of a garden in.  We didn&#39;t get<br/>
the baby his outside toys that I&#39;ve been looking for at yard sales.  That&#39;s<br/>
ok, there&#39;s always next year.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There seems to be this expectation of summer being footloose and fancy free, <br/>
and SO......you should schedule activities for every waking moment in order to <br/>
&quot;fully experience&quot; it.  lol <br/>
<br/>
Ugh, my cousin, on vacation, asking me if I would like to do this, and like <br/>
to do that, couldn&#39;t understand when my answer was NO.  I&#39;m on vacation.  She <br/>
wanted to schedule that vacation so tight I couldn&#39;t breathe.   I don&#39;t want to <br/>
&quot;schedule a fricking trip 5 minutes away to the damn chocolate factory.  I am <br/>
&#39;planning&#39; to go when it&#39;s rainy and everyone wants chocolate, dammit!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
She actually had the nerve to tell me that because I &quot;never&quot; schedule <br/>
anything that maybe on vacation I &quot;should&quot;.  My gods, I schedule things like root <br/>
canals, not chocolate factories.  I don&#39;t think she sees a difference.  Root <br/>
canals are not the same as trips to chocolate factories, but she sure makes it <br/>
feel like the same!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Where does that idea come from??  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> I dunno, school?  The belief that summer is fun and the rest of the year is <br/>
work?  <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t gone camping this summer, and that&#39;s been disappointing.   This <br/>
summer was cold and wet early on and now it&#39;s nasty hot and humid.  Hubby&#39;s <br/>
taking the Friday before Labor Day off, we know a site that&#39;s always empty , and <br/>
we&#39;re planning to go for four days, but I&#39;m not going to brave horrible weather, <br/>
or whatever,  just &quot;to get it in&quot;.   I can go camping as late as October, <br/>
depending on the weather, so I&#39;m keeping that in mind.  <br/>
<br/>
Planning to do something and then being flexible cause the plan isn&#39;t <br/>
working, :-0  , or having fun or getting things done because planning helped make it <br/>
so, isn&#39;t the same thing as strangling the summer ( or your life!) with <br/>
schedules.  Schedules are for people who don&#39;t have enough time and have to &quot;get it <br/>
in&quot;.  We are not those people anymore!  WHEE!!!  Maybe you needed to <br/>
deschedule?  lol <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Didn&#39;t get the new patio built, or the garden in, or traveled to such<br/>
and such, or blah blah blah. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       You could start planning next year&#39;s garden now, you could plant bulbs <br/>
to bloom in the spring,  you still have time before winter to build a patio, <br/>
and travelling can be done anytime.  <br/>
<br/>
If you really want to do those things, you still can!  Labor Day is not a <br/>
deadline.  lol <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I struggle with this also. Big plans that get derailed somehow. This <br/>
year it was great weather, but this broken arm and FIL having a stroke have <br/>
really changed the focus for us. We have scaled down our expectations a lot, just <br/>
wanting to get by.But  we have had some real fun, lots of nice kids around, <br/>
and tons of time to dream and putter around while Mom moans on the couch.(G)<br/>
I know what you mean tho. <br/>
To get past it we try to look at the big picture and simply enjoy the really <br/>
beautiful moments  with our kids , The yardwork and horseriding and porch <br/>
painting will always be there. Hope that is not too smarmy for you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-164254792">Here in this part of GA. the public schools started on Aug 1st this year!  We were eating outside that day and heard the kids on the playground at the elem. school that is through the woods.  When I told my older son that was the school kids back in school he just smiled.  It was great to see because just last Dec. when he heard them playing he would say he wanted to go to school.  We weren&#39;t unschooling yet.<br/>

  Where did Summer go?  Every year I get to this point and get down on<br/>
  myself that all of my grand plans for summer never materialized. <br/>
  Didn&#39;t get the new patio built, or the garden in, or traveled to such<br/>
  and such, or blah blah blah.  When people ask me &quot;So what have you<br/>
  been up to this summer?&quot; I go blank.  LOL  It&#39;s so ingrained in me<br/>
  that I need to constantly be &quot;productive&quot; that I almost feel guilty<br/>
  for just hanging out and &quot;doing nothing&quot;.  I guess I&#39;m still<br/>

  TIA - TreeGoddess <br/>
<br/>
  I struggle with this in summer, winter, fall, etc... I just keep reminding myself that productivity level does not indicate whether I am a worthwhile person. I really haven&#39;t found anything to successful but i sure do understand what you are referring to.<br/>

Means fall (my favorite season) is coming, the heat and hardest farm season is ending and I may see my husband off the fields a little more.  Though the lack of heat and huge amount of rain was wonderful this year.  I would love Seattle.<br/>
