<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think any kid can and will spontaneously clean a bedroom or<br/>
&gt; living room that looks like a bomb went off in it.  I think it takes<br/>
&gt; years of teaching, modeling, and most importantly cleaning it up with<br/>
&gt; them before they are able to do much useful cleaning by themselves. <br/>
&gt; (And even then, I can&#39;t promise you that they will want to clean.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cameron, at 12 (now almost 15), suddenly decided that he LIKES a clean room. <br/>
The only thing he DOESN&#39;T like to do is vacuum, so the floor is littered with <br/>
tiny pieces of crap (I&#39;m happy to vacuum.). Otherwise his room is downright <br/>
CLEAN. He didn&#39;t get that from me. &lt;g&gt; He also will clean the kitchen/do <br/>
laundry on mornings I&#39;m not home.<br/>
<br/>
I never asked him to clean by himself as a child. We would work together or I <br/>
would do it while he was in school. He LOVED to come home to a clean room and <br/>
always thanked me profusely.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan, at six, gets the same breaks Cam got at that age. I pretty much do <br/>
everything, or we work together. With any luck, he&#39;ll eventually like things <br/>
relatively clean too.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron went through a time at 11 or 12 (he was still in school) when he got <br/>
angry about ANYTHING I asked him to do and would whine/shout, &quot;WHY???&quot; &quot;Do I <br/>
HAVE to?&quot;  I always said, &quot;NO, you don&#39;t HAVE to do ANYthing. But I have that <br/>
same right of refusal.&quot; It was not a threat: I have never refused to do <br/>
anything for him if I was able, but he started to realize that I had the <br/>
ability to be JUST as disagreeable. It didn&#39;t last long. He&#39;s really a sweet <br/>
and agreeable child---I blame the stress of school for those brief episodes.<br/>
<br/>
I still can&#39;t get him or my husband to turn their socks right-side-out <br/>
though! Yech!<br/>

They can be washed and put back into the drawer inside out.  You don&#39;t<br/>
have to match them, either.  <br/>

chuck &#39;em in the drawers.<br/>
Mind you, I&#39;m tired of my kids putting their dirty clothes back in the <br/>
drawers cos its closer than the laundry basket (by a whole 2 feet). <br/>
When they turn into stinky teens it will be a problem.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> We get that too. I stick a pile of clean laundry on their beds, they <br/>
tip it onto the floor anda few days later they chuck it in the basket <br/>
cos its easier than folding it and putting it away. Heck, they don&#39;t <br/>
even have to fold it. It&#39;s not like I actually iron anything!<br/>
Every 2 or 3 weeks this whole messy thing really gets on my tits <br/>
and I explode then they *help* for a day or two. I think watching me <br/>
foam at the mouth and becoming incoherant with fustration has a <br/>
sobering sort of effect ;-)<br/>
Then its back to normal.<br/>
<br/>
This is really gonna bother me in the spring when we put our house <br/>
on the market cos people wil be coming round to see it. Here in <br/>
Stepford everybody elses houses are immaculate with matching <br/>
stuff. My furniture is battered and not matching so I need the house <br/>
tidy to at least make a good impression.<br/>

is!!! My brother lives in Dubai but he loves it and never wants to go <br/>
back to Britian. He&#39;s planning on a move to Canada in 3 years.<br/>

I think part of homesickness comes from an inability to go home. <br/>
We went last xmas but can&#39;t afford to go this year at all :-(<br/>

Must start my xmas pud too. I went to get brandy at the liquor <br/>
store the other day but they wouldn&#39;t let me cos I didn&#39;t have my ID <br/>
with me!!! Apparently looking 34 and having 3 kids didn&#39;t prove I <br/>
was over 21. Grrrrrrrrrr<br/>
<br/>
When we leave the US in 2 years time there are things I will miss <br/>
like fireflies and the garbage disposal unit. Plus all my American <br/>
friends but I am so looking forward to getting back and hearing Brit <br/>
accents again.<br/>
We&#39;ve been here 18 months and so far the kids have kept their <br/>
accents but I don&#39;t know what another two years will do too them. <br/>
(It&#39;s not that I dislike American accents its just that they ain&#39;t <br/>
ours....)<br/>

(Marks and Sparks, BHS, Early Learning Center, Adams ....) and of course<br/>
tons of expats so you get lots of Brit talk! We have even have the British<br/>
Club we could join if so inclined -- a place to sip gin and tonics served<br/>
by Indians while bitching about the damn locals (very colonial:)<br/>
But of course we have white beaches, turquoise ocean, and blue skies which<br/>
