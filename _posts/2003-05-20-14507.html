&lt;&lt; I write to the list saying my 12 year old boy, who has been offered <br/>
his freedom :), becomes worried about the loss of social scene. I <br/>
collect the answers (mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gw@...">gw@...</a>) from all you <br/>
great people, and compile the following and send it in with the <br/>
original question and a Subject heading: SUMMARY: Social Scene) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The reason I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea is that unschooling and parenting <br/>
aren&#39;t like web design, where a code works no matter what the motivation of <br/>
the programmer was, or whether the programmer was honest.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I do NOT want answers offlist.  The discussion is heavily <br/>
dependent on how the answers are first worded, for me, because this is <br/>
interpersonal stuff and cognitive stuff, not technical stuff.<br/>
<br/>
This is an analogy for a purpose, so go with it instead of just saying &quot;Poof, <br/>
not applicable,&quot; okay?<br/>
<br/>
In the SCA we have discussions about who should be elevated to peerage <br/>
(knighthood, order of the Laurel, etc.)   In some kingdoms they do it in <br/>
writing and someone summarizes and that goes out batch-like, and without <br/>
names.<br/>
<br/>
For me, on a matter involving integrity and personal knowledge, I not only <br/>
want to know who said what, but I&#39;d prefer to see them say it.  Our kingdom <br/>
has those meetings in person, without notes taken even, and we say what we&#39;re <br/>
going to say in front of the other members of the order who choose to be <br/>
there.  Who speaks how and after whom and how they choose to say what they <br/>
say and what upsets them, all that is important information in the overall <br/>
picture of WHY they think what they think.<br/>
<br/>
So there&#39;s the other extreme. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
An online discussion about unschooling and parenting is halfway between those <br/>
two, I think.  It&#39;s about interpersonal/emotional stuff, rather than <br/>
technical.  And I can&#39;t see faces and glances between people, but it DOES <br/>
matter to me whether the information is coming from someone I trust, who has <br/>
seemed selfless and generous in the past, whose kids DO have a good <br/>
relationship with them, or whether it&#39;s just theoretical noise from someone <br/>
whose kids were in school last year and might be in next year, who have no <br/>
special relationship with them.<br/>
<br/>
To have those recommendations all rolled together in one summary would make <br/>
them less pure, less alive, less dynamic.  At that point it would be FAQs, <br/>
not exchanges.  For web design or deck building or cooking, that would be <br/>
GREAT!!! Someone collecting the best chocolate pudding recipes, sure!  <br/>
<br/>
This is a different type of discussion altogether, though.<br/>

me to.  <br/>

<br/>
Click on Browse Projects to see what&#39;s happening.  Also read the overview <br/>
page.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a little difficult to understand at first.  But what it is is a <br/>
moderator asks a question...say about socialization.  Then all the participants go <br/>
through and answer the question.  Then certain people are assigned to respond to <br/>
the responses, and rate the responses, etc.  We&#39;ve been doing a project called <br/>
Homeschooling for a few weeks now and it has been interesting.<br/>
<br/>
It is not as dynamic and interpersonal as lists are,--but I think if the <br/>
right people were to use it, the easily searchable archive would be a wonderful <br/>
resource to have out there on the internet.  There are all kinds of subjects out <br/>
there already.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone is welcome to participate in the homeschooling project.  <br/>
