<div id="ygrps-yiv-883925283"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hi again, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My  11 year old daughter is very interested in  Mexican-American history.<br/>
This interest has been fueled by having Josephina (Amer. Girl Doll) and<br/>
having read all the books about her. <br/>
I haven&#39;t been very helpful in her pursuit of great historical fiction<br/>
regarding this era in American history (we do not cover it here in<br/>
Canada...esp. at elementary levels). She is particularly interested in the<br/>
1800&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any great links or (even better) some good titles of<br/>
childrens novels about this period please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,,,<br/>
