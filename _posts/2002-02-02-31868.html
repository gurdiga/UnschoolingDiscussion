<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924681835">Hi all, my name is Kama and our family lives in Lillooet, BC.  I <br/>
thought I would introduce myself and share a moment.  We have been <br/>
learning outside of Public School for three years.  We have a son <br/>
(13) and a daughter (11 on Monday).  Last fall the kids decided that <br/>
they wanted to return to PS.  That was a difficult time in our <br/>
journey.  Although it was scary (re-entering the tyrranic system - my <br/>
thoughts of course) we dicided to support them in their path toward <br/>
exploring  <br/>
options and choices.  About the end of November, our son started to <br/>
share some of his thoughts and feelings about this new direction.  &quot;I <br/>
can&#39;t believe we are there for seven hours&quot;, &quot;I am tired of waiting <br/>
for everyone and everything&quot;, &quot;They keep us in ONE place and they <br/>
even have a fence around it to keep us in&quot;, and &quot;I am so bored&quot;.  I <br/>
have <br/>
to admit it was music to my ears.  Not that he was following what I <br/>
valued but that he was coming to this place all on his own.  Over the <br/>
next month I observed him weighing out the choices, the options, and <br/>
the results.  He finally made a decision at the end of December.  He <br/>
told us that he had realized that he was loosing his &quot;self&quot; and that <br/>
his own level of self-expectations were dropping.  He chose to return <br/>
home and re-enter the &quot;world&quot; of learning.  I am very proud and <br/>
excited for our family and for my son.  His own sense of self, self-<br/>
confidence, and trust empowered him to acknowledge his own needs, <br/>
find a way to honour them, and meet them.  I know this was a <br/>
difficult <br/>
process for him.  Over the time I watched him struggle, formulate, <br/>
and choose a choice even in the midst of peer and adult pressure from <br/>
the world.  All this at the age of 13.  My daughter has made the <br/>
decision to stay in PS for the remainder of the year and then return <br/>
to the world to learn.  This is her current choice although I do see <br/>
her struggling with some of the same experiences as my son.  We&#39;ll <br/>
see how the process unfolds for her.  I know that we have once again <br/>
entered a new path on the same journey and my hope is that we <br/>
continue to examine and learn what is best for each of us.  I hope to <br/>
learn, teach, share, and post with everyone as we continue our <br/>
journey.  I know for me that life is about a process and this is no <br/>
different.  When our kids first came home to learn we developed our <br/>
own experiences to fit Ministry of Education goals and objectives <br/>
(mostly theme unit oriented stuff), then we tried distance Ed stuff, <br/>
then back to our own identified goals and put together our own <br/>
curriculum.  Towards <br/>
then end of the first three years we had moved through the process <br/>
and developed our own understanding, value, and philosophy, of <br/>
unschooling.  We now are &quot;unschooling&quot; ( quotations are loosly used <br/>
to reflect that obviously there is a large encompassing understanding <br/>
of what this may mean to different people)and we are constantly <br/>
learning, developing, and formulating our own process and definition <br/>
of what that is.  This is our <br/>
path for now, our understanding as of today, and the place that fits <br/>
with our world and our perception of it at this moment.  I guess that <br/>
this was a pretty long intro but I wanted to share our &quot;family&quot; <br/>
moment, to say that I am glad to be back in the loop, and to share a <br/>
little about where we are and where we&#39;ve been.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome Kama. . . and welcome back to the loop. My daughter also chose to go <br/>
to school a couple of years ago and made the decision to not do so again. <br/>
What a great experience it was though in that she was able to fully come to <br/>
unschooling of her own choice. It was a challenge to have to stick to my &quot;it <br/>
is always your choice whether to homeschool or not&quot;. . . yikes!! But now she <br/>
is so committed to it and understands how she loses part of her soul in the <br/>
school system (even though it was  Montessori). As with everything, it was a <br/>
great learning adventure and opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
