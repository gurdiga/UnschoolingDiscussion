<div id="ygrps-yiv-561684450">We haven&#39;t let our son completely loose on his bedroom walls yet, but we did<br/>
let him pick the color he wanted his room to be. The only reason we didn&#39;t<br/>
let him paint pics was because we were getting it ready to put on the<br/>
market. I&#39;m all for that kind of stuff though - in college my roomie and I<br/>
did a floor to ceiling wall collage (it was removable without damaging the<br/>
wall considering the wall was only on loan...) and it was great fun and we<br/>
really enjoyed looking at it.<br/>
<br/>
When next we buy a house, if my kids still want to, they will be able to<br/>
decorate to their hearts content.<br/>

&gt; Subject: painting walls<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My 8yo ds wants to draw pictures of Pokemon on his wall in his new<br/>
&gt; bedroom downstairs.  I&#39;m all for it, I think it&#39;s neat and something<br/>
&gt; I wanted to do when I was his age, but my husband doesn&#39;t agree and<br/>
&gt; sees it as something that will turn into a huge disaster because then<br/>
&gt; everyone will want to write and paint on walls all over the house!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve pointed out that we&#39;d make guidelines and I feel as though our<br/>
&gt; children respect those pretty well when they understand them.  Also,<br/>
&gt; we know people who have their children&#39;s bedrooms painted in murals<br/>
&gt; by professional artists and that&#39;s o.k.  How&#39;s my son going to become<br/>
&gt; the next Michaelangelo :&gt;}<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just wondering, any others that have let their children<br/>
&gt; have &quot;artistic freedom&quot; on their bedroom walls??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; If any of you are in need of a good dictionary (my kids are always wondering<br/>
&gt; what words mean), B&N stores (not the dotcom) have a huge Webster&#39;s Unabridged<br/>
&gt; dictionary in their bargain section right now.  The copyright on it is 1996,<br/>
&gt; but I don&#39;t think that makes it any less worthwhile.  Retail on it is $100....<br/>
&gt; it is marked $29.95.  With my discount card, it was only $21.18 including tax.<br/>
&gt; I am guessing this is chain-wide, since a neighbor bought one at a different<br/>
&gt; B&N than the one I went to today.  Mine had several copies. </span></blockquote></div>

&gt; Ivan Doig wrote three neat novels about Scottish friends settling in<br/>
&gt; Montana.  I had to read the first one because of the tempting title<br/>
&gt; _Dancing at the Rascal Fair_.  The third book, which has a modern setting,<br/>

<br>Well, there are some truncated branches around here.
<br>
<br>Funny incident: &nbsp;My mom was on the phone about some banking thing and was 
<br>asked to give her mother&#39;s maiden name (you know how they do that). &nbsp;Well, my 
<br>mother&#39;s mother was sort of MIA and her last name is lost to history. &nbsp;So 
<br>here&#39;s my 60-year-old mom trying to remember what name she made up when she 
<br>opened the bank account years earlier. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Sometimes these things seem a little disconnected from reality to me -- 
<br>assuming that a lot more people know who their grandparents are than really 
<br>do.

 </span></blockquote>   Thank you for the clay recipe Chris. Can&#39;t remember if I made an intro yet <br/>
so, I am Nicki SAHM to Zoe who will be 5 in May. Basically she plays all day <br/>
w/ her horse,dinosaurs,cats,and dogs, and people. We also take care of the <br/>
animals around here;dogs,horses,and a cat. We clean,cook,and do errands. We <br/>
hit the library once a week hopefully on story day b/c they bring in <br/>
something like a snake or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
    Our &quot;educational&quot; stuff comes in when she asks questions or while reading <br/>
to her. Zoe has begun writing like a mad woman all on her own accord. She <br/>
copies words and asks how to spell things constantly. Even moping the other <br/>
day she was writing our letters. Also vet visits and farrier visits are <br/>
always an education. We play some games and do puzzles too. Zoe occasionally <br/>
does a workbook type activity when it strikes her. We receive Brighter Vision <br/>
packages once a month and they send a workbook. I don&#39;t buy them, not my <br/>
style.<br/>
<br/>
    Basically I think that sums it up for us. She does watch a video or 2 a <br/>
day but doesn&#39;t actually pay attention to it, she seems to use it as <br/>
background noise. I wish I could get her to use the stereo instead. My <br/>
mistake. <br/>

him use one wall in his room or 2. Would that make your dh feel any better?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29984675">Here is another really good clay! Dries very smooth and hard.<br/>
Corn Starch Clay<br/>
2 cups baking soda<br/>
1 cup corn starch<br/>
1 1/4 cup water<br/>
<br/>
Cook this over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the consistancy of <br/>
mashed potatoes. Let cool. It doesn&#39;t work very well if you add color to the <br/>
dough, but you can paint it nicely. I used these to do hand prints for all <br/>
my kidlets, we hang them on our tree. I have alot of clay recipes, some use <br/>
dryer lint and sawdust. My oldest dd has a fondness for clay and we are <br/>
always experimenting with things. Hope someone finds this useful and fun!<br/>
