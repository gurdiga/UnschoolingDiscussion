I called my mom &quot;Mommy&quot; until I was grown and irritated at her and wanted to <br/>
depersonalize it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My sister&#39;s kids call her &quot;Irene.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of four other homeschoolers who&#39;ve been over lately and they all <br/>
say &quot;Mom&quot; of their moms too.  One calls her dad by his name, but I think he&#39;s <br/>
a stepdad.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids call me &quot;Momma&quot; , although I spell it &quot;Moma&quot; and they laugh at me <br/>
because they say it&#39;s wrong.  ( just good natured teasing)  I spell it Moma <br/>
because that is how my Moma spells it :-)  Its really more like &quot;Mama&quot;.. They <br/>
call me Moma most of the time, unless they are hurt or sad or lonely, they <br/>
will call me &quot;Mommy&quot;..  Hmm, except for Landon, he&#39;s not did the &quot;Mommy&quot; <br/>
thing in a few years, hes 16.  They call me Mom if they are yelling for me or <br/>
referring to me. &quot;Go ask Mom, Where is Mom.. etc&quot;.   They call refer to their <br/>
Dad in the same way. Generally they call him Daddy, but for reference or <br/>
attention getting, they say &quot;Dad&quot;.   Same goes for me and my parents and DH <br/>
and his parents.  Grandparents are Grandma and Grandpa.  When the kids were <br/>
smaller they called them Mamaw and Papaw... My Dad still gets Papaw <br/>
sometimes.  <br/>

Just kidding. (I couldn&#39;t resist!)<br/>
<br/>
Actually, we call each all sorts of silly stuff from Pookie kid/Pookie mom <br/>
to just plain &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;Marji.&quot; My favorite, though, was this one time <br/>
when Liam was about 2 or 3 years old.  We were visiting good friends, and <br/>
the three of us (me, Jim [dad], and Liam) were sleeping on a futon at our <br/>
friends&#39; house. Liam had gotten a toy light saber (the first he had ever <br/>
seen) and was up REALLY early playing with it.  He was standing up on the <br/>
bed in between us and poked Jimmy right in the eye with it.  Liam said <br/>
seriously, &quot;Sorry, Jim.&quot;  He had never called him &quot;Jim&quot; before. It was as <br/>
though he was waiting for just the right time to use this cool new name.<br/>
<br/>
Even then, it was really funny.<br/>

common practice around here ( maybe other places too)  Children in daycare <br/>
and preschool ( and sunday school and bible school) call thier teachers Miss <br/>
First name.  I guess because its supposed to be a sign of respect. Little <br/>
kids have a hard time saying or remembering last names so they those in <br/>
authoratative roles Miss First Name.   Of course, Miss First Name gets <br/>
switched to Miss Last Name as soon as they hit Kindergarten.  UNLESS they <br/>
occasionally have a teachers assitant in the lower grades that has a <br/>
difficult last name.    Its weird is&#39;nt it.<br/>

Just kidding. (I couldn&#39;t resist!)<br/>
<br/>
Actually, we call each all sorts of silly stuff from Pookie kid/Pookie mom <br/>
to just plain &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;Marji.&quot; My favorite, though, was this one time <br/>
when Liam was about 2 or 3 years old.  We were visiting good friends, and <br/>
the three of us (me, Jim [dad], and Liam) were sleeping on a futon at our <br/>
friends&#39; house. Liam had gotten a toy light saber (the first he had ever <br/>
seen) and was up REALLY early playing with it.  He was standing up on the <br/>
bed in between us and poked Jimmy right in the eye with it.  Liam said <br/>
seriously, &quot;Sorry, Jim.&quot;  He had never called him &quot;Jim&quot; before. It was as <br/>
though he was waiting for just the right time to use this cool new name.<br/>
<br/>
Even then, it was really funny.<br/>

  My kids call me &quot;Momma&quot; , although I spell it &quot;Moma&quot; and they laugh at me <br/>
  because they say it&#39;s wrong.  ( just good natured teasing)  I spell it Moma <br/>
  because that is how my Moma spells it :-)  Its really more like &quot;Mama&quot;.. They <br/>
  call me Moma most of the time, unless they are hurt or sad or lonely, they <br/>
  will call me &quot;Mommy&quot;..  Hmm, except for Landon, he&#39;s not did the &quot;Mommy&quot; <br/>
  thing in a few years, hes 16.  They call me Mom if they are yelling for me or <br/>
  referring to me. &quot;Go ask Mom, Where is Mom.. etc&quot;.   They call refer to their <br/>
  Dad in the same way. Generally they call him Daddy, but for reference or <br/>
  attention getting, they say &quot;Dad&quot;.   Same goes for me and my parents and DH <br/>
  and his parents.  Grandparents are Grandma and Grandpa.  When the kids were <br/>
  smaller they called them Mamaw and Papaw... My Dad still gets Papaw <br/>
  sometimes.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-140266223">Jon Phillip reminded me last night when I went to bed of one my favorite <br/>
things he calls me.  <br/>
<br/>
I went to bed and he was snuggled up with his Dad.  I said.. &quot;Who is that in <br/>
my bed?!?!&quot; ( friendly, amused tone).. He said..&quot;Its Jon Phillip!&quot;  <br/>
(giggling).. I said.. &quot;Jon Phillip??? who is Jon Phillip?&quot;  Giggling more he <br/>
said. &quot;I&#39;m your son!&quot;   I said&quot; My son?  my SON?  I thought you were my <br/>
little boy?&quot;  Crawling into bed, he snuggled up beside me and hugged me, and <br/>
said..&quot;Im AM your little boy, and your are my sweet Moma&quot;     Then I <br/>
remembered that he calls me sweet Moma pretty often.  Like as a greeting.. <br/>
HEY sweet Moma, Good morning sweet Moma.. Or when he asks for something.. <br/>
&quot;Will you get me some drink, sweet Moma&quot;     Ethan used to call me Special <br/>
Moma when he was younger.  <br/>
<br/>
While contemplating all of this before I went to sleep, I also thought about <br/>
what I call my children.   I kissed JP goodnight and said &quot;good night, <br/>
sweetheart&quot;  Ethan came in and I said.. &quot;night night, babe&quot;   I call them <br/>
honey, sweetie, babe, sugar pie,  other terms of endearment.   I call Anna , <br/>
chick and girlie.  I call the boys, &quot;son&quot; and buddy or bud..   I also have <br/>
made up names for them like JP is punky doodle.   or Japula ( long story.. <br/>
and its funny too) Ethan is Feefon ( cause that is what Anna called him as a <br/>
baby).. Landon is Landino, he used to be Boo-chi when he was a baby...  Anna <br/>
is Annabana.<br/>
<br/>
  I call my husband Gray, his name is Gralyn.    I have always been Teresa.  <br/>
Not Terri, not Teesie,  and I like it that way. What I hate most is when <br/>
folks call me &quot;Treesa&quot;.. ughghg.. and I get that alot from country folks.. <br/>
lol<br/>
