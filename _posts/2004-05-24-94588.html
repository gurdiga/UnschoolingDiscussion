<div id="ygrps-yiv-884830157">I may be way off the mark, but in reading your post a few things jumped out at me.   <br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Which would be great if this guy would understand that HIS IS NOT THE F&#39;IN PARENT.  We are.  And while he is more than welcome to model behavior he thinks is appropriate and even encourage, he is not supposed to &quot;discipline.&quot;  Ever.  And he tries to do it in front of us sometimes, which would be hysterical if only.. ..  I mean honestly, even if we weren&#39;t unschooling and trying to be non-coersive and all that, I&#39;d be pretty pissed.<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like this has been a problem before.  How have you addressed it then, or did you just let slide? Does this friend know how you feel about discipline?  <br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Our son was supposed to spend a couple days at this man&#39;s house.  He camehome because when he refused to take a shower his friend, and I quote, &quot;wouldn&#39;t reward that behavior by letting him play video games.&quot;   Our son,quite resonably, chose to come home rather than deal.<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
okay, again I don&#39;t know this guy or your son, but... A man who is not your 8yo son&#39;s father insisted your son take a shower.  Personally, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be comfortable -- no, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d be very uncomfortable -- with this scenario.  Something about it just feels inappropriate, especially if your son didn&#39;t feel comfortable showering at this friend&#39;s home.  <br/>
<br/>
I will admit that my &#39;weird&#39; radar is easily set-off (several incidences of child molestation in my extended family) but for me it&#39;s a big, red flag when an man without kids of his own takes a personal interest in a young boy. <br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
We have asked him for help in the past with giving our son an outlet for things that are tough with littler sibs around and with over worked parents. We have asked for his help in our home with the mess we have trouble with because of our own habits and having small children.   He has repeatedly interpreted that as free license to try and parent us.<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
Well, sure he has!  You&#39;re talking about a guy who &#39;helped&#39; raise his younger sibling.  You&#39;ve asked him for &#39;help&#39; with your bad habits and mess.  I can understand where he got the impression you are immature, incapable parents who need his guidance.  He probably feels like he&#39;s doing your son a favor, given the lack of direction it appears he gets at home (I&#39;m not saying I think it&#39;s lack of discipline, just that I can see where he would think that).  <br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
I commented that the 8 year old can be rough with his younger sibs.  It happens.  I wasn&#39;t asking for advice, I wasn&#39;t doing anything but commenting.  He asks, &quot;And what consequences are there for doing that?&quot;  In this amazingly condecending tone like, &quot;And didn&#39;t you do anything about it?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Have you told him what your method is, or just left him to believe you are &#39;doing nothing&#39; about discipline? It sounds to me like the friend believes you should be &quot;doing more.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Who in their right mind talks to a parent that way?<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
Someone who thinks you are a negligent parent, in need of his guidance. Again, have you told him how you feel?  If not, is it because you&#39;re concerned you might lose him as a support system? Of course, the next question should be whether he is the kind of support system you want?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
He&#39;s a good guy, who really genuinely cares about our son.  I don&#39;t doubt that for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
IME, the world is full of well-meaning &#39;good&#39; folks whose motives in befriending others are sometimes more about &#39;helping&#39; them to see what&#39;s right, and less about genuine friendship.  I would really look closely at whether or not this guy is being a good support system for you and what his opinion of your parenting says to your son.  <br/>
<br/>
If it were my kid, I&#39;d be seeing red flags all over this situation, and probably find some way to limit his influence.<br/>

My brother is a programmer, so I&#39;m familiar with seeing an adult think <br/>
that stimulus-response programming is a fine technique for interacting <br/>
with little humans.  I&#39;m with you in thinking that it can be quite <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073251852">I&#39;m jumping away from the original topic to talk about the basis for <br/>
friendships.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; IME, the world is full of well-meaning &#39;good&#39; folks whose motives in <br/>
befriending others are sometimes more about &#39;helping&#39; them to see what&#39;s right, and <br/>
less about genuine friendship.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what most of the homeschooling lists and support groups and playgroups <br/>
end up being.   Either people are trying to help others or they&#39;re asking for <br/>
help, or they&#39;ve agreed not to discuss much and just let their kids play <br/>
without comparing parenting-belief notes.  And that only lasts until one kid <br/>
throws sand in the other one&#39;s faces.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking last week about how people (I have too) disparage school <br/>
friendships as being just like having friends in prison, as soon as you&#39;re gone <br/>
you&#39;re gone.  But there&#39;s a photo right here of six of my schoolmates, and <br/>
another photo of two former best friends of mine, and Holly got to meet them all <br/>
when some of us got together at the request of one who&#39;s been living in <br/>
Washington for years and wanted to see us.<br/>
<br/>
I really like those people.  Some I&#39;ve kept in contact with.  ALL of them, <br/>
I&#39;ve been thrilled if I ran into them, but they&#39;re all in Santa Fe and points <br/>
north, and I&#39;m in Albuquerque &quot;lately&quot; (for the past 24 years or so).   Some of <br/>
them I&#39;ve known since I was seven.  We WERE friends outside of school, and <br/>
knew each others&#39; families and dogs and cousins.<br/>
<br/>
There are some homeschoolers I&#39;m friends with in and as it concerns <br/>
homeschooling.  Sometimes when one stops homeschooling, the relationship fades quickly. <br/>
 Partly, sometimes, it&#39;s because they don&#39;t want to be reminded of what they <br/>
decided against, or they want their kids to bond with the school friends now <br/>
and not look back.  Sometimes it&#39;s just I don&#39;t really care about the details <br/>
of their lives if their kids are no longer going to be at my house every week <br/>
or two or they are going to be talking about school a lot.<br/>
<br/>
So there are relationships built on homeschooling as a mutual &quot;place.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
But in the real world of random relationships with neighbors and friends&#39; <br/>
friends and former co-workers and all that, sometimes there ARE close and <br/>
longterm friendships based on something between the two individuals at an intangible <br/>
level.    Sometimes it&#39;s entirely mutual.   Many more friendships, though, in <br/>
my experience, are based on need and exchange of services, ideas, assistance, <br/>
sympathy, attention, in a more temporary way.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has some anime friends.  What they have in common is an interest in <br/>
anime and a shared set of experiences and adventures at Lobo Comics here, and Nan <br/>
Desu Con in Denver every year.    With some, he has done other things at <br/>
other times.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Marty have lots of gaming friends.  If one of them decided gaming <br/>
was stupid and a waste of time and energy, the friendship would probably fade <br/>
pretty quickly and without animosity.<br/>

Maybe you could write to him and say that.  Things in writing are good, in my <br/>
opinion.  You can&#39;t be interrupted or intimidated while you&#39;re writing.  He <br/>
can&#39;t claim you said something you didn&#39;t, if it&#39;s in writing.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could say that he might never have thought of it in those terms, <br/>
but you don&#39;t want your son to be parented or babysat.  You want him to visit, <br/>
and be treated as a visitor.  You don&#39;t want him punished or rewarded, just <br/>
treated like a person.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Anyway, the biggest reason I&#39;m so pissed, really, is the effect on their<br/>
<br/>
friendship.  It means so much to our son, he&#39;s clearly really upset. I think<br/>
<br/>
he&#39;d like to go back over, if not this weekend, then next, as planned. But<br/>

That changes a lot of things.  If he has been in a position of saying &quot;bath <br/>

change that relationship.<br/>

<br/>
I thought about that too.  Some people grew up with and maintain the <br/>
tradition of beds being for only freshly-washed humans in clean pajamas.  I never did. <br/>
 I&#39;d rather wash the bedding because i went to bed really grubby than to have <br/>
to wash me when I&#39;d rather just crash out that instant.<br/>
<br/>
But when I&#39;m a guest, I&#39;m more aware of keeping the room the way the owner <br/>

the Gift by Gavin De Becker.  If you have ANY doubt about this guy, you<br/>
need to trust that doubt.  <br/>
 <br/>
I just fired my long-time babysitter because of one betrayal of trust.<br/>
Once I could no longer trust her, it was not possible for me to send my<br/>

Check into YOUR feelings about this man.  Then trust them.<br/>

<br/>
I totally understand.  It&#39;s sad that our society is such that we do get<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;guidance.  He probably feels like he&#39;s doing your son a favor, given the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lack of direction it appears he gets at home &gt;(I&#39;m not saying I think it&#39;s<br/>
lack of discipline, just that I can see where he would think that).<br/>
<br/>
We have talked about this before.  I don&#39;t think he thinks we are negligent<br/>
as such, but that he sees so clearly how our choices make life difficult for<br/>
us and if we could only just see that he has the answers.....-sigh-  I&#39;ve<br/>
never met an evangelical Buddist before, it&#39;s kinda weird.  -grin-<br/>
<br/>
We talked today and he says he does tend to &quot;mother&quot; and that it is related<br/>
to taking care of his brother, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Have you told him what your method is, or just left him to believe you are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&#39;doing nothing&#39; about discipline? It sounds &gt;to me like the friend believes<br/>
you should be &quot;doing more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not really.  I dont&#39; see him as often, except when passing our son off.<br/>
Hubby sees him more, but then, guys don&#39;t talk about this stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I did talk to him today and he made the situation much clearer.<br/>
<br/>
It was a matter of not wanting our son to be dirty in/around his bed and<br/>
other stuff.  Which is fair.  I didn&#39;t think my eight year old was that<br/>
grubby, but then I am surrounded by kids and cats and general grubbiness.<br/>
He isn&#39;t.  His house, his choice.<br/>
<br/>
What ended up happening was classic parental miscue (not making it clear it<br/>
was about his space)/everyone being overtired, not in the frame to work on<br/>
it (son is even not feeling so well)/and getting into a power struggle.<br/>
Which let me tell you, my kid excels at.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s going back over today, with a clearer understanding on both sides.<br/>

with it.  -grin-  It&#39;s a heat of the moment thing.  With a night&#39;s<br/>
reflection he can see how they got there and what part his actions played.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL!  I commented in another post that I&#39;ve never met an evangelical<br/>
Buddhist before and he can be one.  If only we would see how much easier<br/>
life would be if we would only do it &quot;this&quot; way.  -sigh-<br/>
