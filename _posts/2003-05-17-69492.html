&lt;&lt; If there were a thread where parents were discussing children and allowing<br/>
unlimited free reading and you liked TV more would you say &quot;If we had my way<br/>
there would be no books because we enjoy watching TV more&quot;? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, we can all do BOTH!<br/>
Some people can do two at the same time.<br/>
I unfortunately cannot. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can sure SEW and watch a movie, though, while I can&#39;t begin to sew and read <br/>
a book at the same time, and sometimes I need to sew.  But if I sew without <br/>
additional input, time starts to stack up and I don&#39;t do well sitting quietly <br/>
without at least music.     If it&#39;s a movie I haven&#39;t seen much, I like to <br/>
totally pay attention (and maybe eat at the same time, or hem something, or <br/>
peel bark for kindling, or something I can do in the room).  If I need input <br/>
while sewing, I put on a movie I know really well, so I know when I need to <br/>
look up and when I don&#39;t.  The movies I like best often have good music, one <br/>
way or another.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d hate to say music out of context is better than music IN context.  I like <br/>
the soundtrack for Henry V, but I&#39;d rather hear it with the voices and other <br/>
sounds than separate out by itself.<br/>
<br/>
Some people like two things at once.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes just the fact of a movie having sights, dialog and music is <br/>
sufficient input to keep a zippy-brain calm.  People who don&#39;t have that <br/>
zippy-brain problem might not know how much more value there can be in video <br/>
than in a book.<br/>
