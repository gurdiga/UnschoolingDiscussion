<br/>
&gt;  The 11 required subjects needs to be included in your curriculum.<br/>
&gt; RCW 28A.225.010 (4)<br/>
&gt; The 11 required subjests are reading, writing, spelling, language,<br/>
&gt; math, science, social studies, history, health, occupational<br/>
&gt; education, and art and music appreciation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; VI   You must keep records. RCW 28A.200.010 (2)<br/>
&gt; Your homeschool records should include the student&#39;s annual test<br/>
&gt; scores or assessment report (see V) and immunization records,<br/>
&gt; together with any other records that are kept relating to<br/>
&gt; instructional and educational activities.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What does the law say about who gets to see these? If nobody, you can keep<br/>
this information in your head. If you actually have to turn this stuff over,<br/>
or if you just want to, it looks like it&#39;s straightforward enough to comply:<br/>
<br/>
Keep a chart listing the 11 subjects, and fill in when your child does<br/>
something that pertains to one or more of them (one activity will often be<br/>
two or three or four subjects).<br/>
<br/>
Write up an annual assessment report, &quot;This year, Johnny learned his<br/>
letters, how recognize and use fractions...&quot; etc.<br/>
<br/>
You can also keep a file of projects that your child has done, or photos of<br/>
him doing them.<br/>
