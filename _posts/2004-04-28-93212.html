<div id="ygrps-yiv-12930907">Someone asked me to repost this from the Unschooling.com message boards. I<br/>
changed the questions a bit so they make more sense out of the context of<br/>
the thread (and got to clean up a couple of my own sentences ;-) -- Joyce<br/>

**Maybe it&#39;s just simple fear holding me back from unschooling.**<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s say you&#39;re certain that the only way to keep from drowning is to strap<br/>
on as many swimmies as you can and hold onto the side of the pool. If<br/>
someone says they&#39;ve taken off their swimmies and has let go of the side,<br/>
the only apparent outcome for them it seems is drowning.<br/>
<br/>
If we take away school, it seems like we&#39;re left with nothing between birth<br/>
and college or job.<br/>
<br/>
This site is about what fills that hole left by school.<br/>
<br/>
The amazing thing is that once you get school out of life, you realize that<br/>
school wasn&#39;t a natural part of life and didn&#39;t leave a hole.<br/>
<br/>
School is like a stack of dry books on ³all the stuff it¹s important to<br/>
know² in a windowless room. When people first hear of unschooling, it sounds<br/>
like we&#39;re removing the dry books and leaving kids in a windowless room. But<br/>
we&#39;re removing the windowless room to let kids see they&#39;re in the middle of<br/>
a vast library full of wonderful media to explore. They could look at the<br/>
dry books, but they probably won&#39;t because they have much more interesting<br/>
ways of exploring the same things.<br/>
<br/>
**I just fear they won&#39;t learn enough to get by.**<br/>
<br/>
School is like a grocery store. It&#39;s everything you might need to cook with.<br/>
And what schools do is spend 12 years cramming the entire grocery store into<br/>
kids so they can be prepared to cook anything they want.<br/>
<br/>
But how much of the grocery store do you ever use?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about browsing the grocery store, learning about what&#39;s<br/>
available, having access to recipes and cookbooks and cooking shows, but<br/>
taking home just the stuff that you&#39;ll actually use and eat.<br/>
<br/>
An unschooling life is about browsing the world, seeking out things that<br/>
look intriguing. Looking closer at what interests them. And delving into<br/>
what they find themselves passionate about.<br/>
<br/>
No one needs the whole grocery store. They just need to be able to find what<br/>
they need when they need it.<br/>
<br/>
**Colleges are very picky now, and employers only want to hire the best.**<br/>
<br/>
Standard American dream is success leads to happiness. Success is usually<br/>
defined as a high paying job that allows someone to purchase the &quot;good life&quot;<br/>
for their families. And to get that high paying job you need to go to a<br/>
really good college. And to get into that really good college you need to<br/>
get good grades in high school.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about replacing that with something *better*.<br/>
<br/>
**My oldest son who is in high school would think I was nuts if I said let&#39;s<br/>
just learn through life and not worry about college or the future.**<br/>
<br/>
Yes, he would. As would most people who¹ve been through school or are in<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone can see every single day that the sun obviously goes around the<br/>
earth. Anyone who says otherwise is nuts. So if someone thinks they already<br/>
know what is true, anything outside that truth is going to sound false.<br/>
<br/>
When someone knows there are only two options: stay in school or be a drop<br/>
out, then anything other than school sounds nuts.<br/>
<br/>
**I was always taught to train them for a higher goal including reaching for<br/>
the best financially or otherwise.**<br/>
<br/>
Again, standard American dream. But how does it turn out in truth?<br/>
<br/>
Standard thought is that school prepares kids for life. But how many kids is<br/>
that true for? We *want* to believe it¹s true. We focus on the kids who<br/>
appear to be models of success. We find ways of explaining the failures of<br/>
school -- with reasons that point to causes other than school like<br/>
unmotivated kids and uncaring parents and bad environment that school can¹t<br/>
compensate for.<br/>
<br/>
But in general -- not in every case, but in general -- people find success<br/>
to be an elusive goal and the happiness that was promised with it never<br/>
quite there.<br/>
<br/>
If pursuing the American Dream led to happiness, then everyone who set out<br/>
on the path to pursue it would be happy. But they aren¹t. And some people<br/>
who reject the American Dream are happy.<br/>
<br/>
Since pursuing the American Dream isn¹t a guarantee and some people find<br/>
happiness without pursuing the American Dream, there¹s some other factor<br/>
involved.<br/>
<br/>
That other factor is what unschooling is about. It dispenses with the false<br/>
hopes dangled by the American Dream and focuses on joy being the goal.<br/>
<br/>
**My oldest son has always been free to explore life but he has always had<br/>
rules to live by. Not too strict, but still rules.**<br/>
<br/>
If your son is in school, his freedom to explore life is severely limited.<br/>
If he can¹t do whatever he wants whenever he wants for as long as he wants<br/>
-- free from messages that what he¹s choosing isn¹t as good as what¹s done<br/>
in school -- then he isn¹t truly free.<br/>
<br/>
If he¹s convinced that school is the best path to be on and that doing<br/>
homework is better than reading the ³fluff² he enjoys, then he doesn¹t have<br/>
true freedom. He is confined by false beliefs that are as secure as iron<br/>
bars. But they¹re invisible so he doesn¹t even realize he¹s confined.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has had true freedom and no rules and she¹s a great kid. So<br/>
there¹s some factor other than rules that creates great kids.<br/>
<br/>
**I just can&#39;t wrap my mind around how they will be prepared for college and<br/>
employment.**<br/>
<br/>
You can¹t imagine it because it isn¹t in your experience. Reading here will<br/>
help you fill the vacuum that¹s left behind by school.<br/>
<br/>
Just as finding out about the structure of the solar system will help<br/>
someone reconcile what they they see with what is really true.<br/>
<br/>
**I guess part of me is still trained to feel that doing well in school is<br/>
the only way to get ahead in life.**<br/>
<br/>
Well, yeah. If someone could get to a similar place that school takes them<br/>
just by living life, why would anyone stay in school?<br/>
<br/>
**I want my boys to have the best of both worlds, free to explore life but<br/>
still having all the education they need to get ahead in life. Did you ever<br/>
feel so torn about your decision or did you just know it was right?**<br/>
<br/>
It wasn¹t until I realized that unschooling offered something *better* than<br/>
the standard path to (supposed) success that I finally understood what<br/>
unschooling was all about.<br/>
<br/>
I could tell you that unschooling is about happiness and joy and pursuing<br/>
passions, but at this point I suspect you¹d dismiss it as pie in the sky. I<br/>
would have.<br/>
<br/>
What made me stick with investigating unschooling was the belief that there<br/>
had to be more interesting ways to learn than how school went about it. Life<br/>
was interesting to me and I wanted to know more. But school only offered<br/>
dull ways of learning about interesting things. I did well in school, but it<br/>
felt unsatisfying.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started out investigating homeschooling, I read posts from<br/>
people all along the spectrum of homeschooling. All the homeschoolers<br/>
pursuing more schoolish methods were rarely having fun. Most of their posts<br/>
were about how to get their kids to do their work, or how to handle more<br/>
grades than one, or what are the best resources. But the unschoolers were<br/>
living joyful lives while they learned. And since my daughter was only 4,<br/>
any concerns I had about algebra could wait for several years.<br/>
<br/>
Before I got unschooling, I thought the best I could offer my daughter was<br/>
to prepare her so she could go to MIT if she wanted. But sticking with<br/>
unschooling for the early years allowed me time to realize that it&#39;s better<br/>
to help her be who she is so that if she were someone who wanted what MIT<br/>
offered, she¹d naturally be heading in that direction pursuing interesting<br/>
things that would make MIT a viable option for her. (As it is, she¹s<br/>
pursuing writing and drawing with a passion.)<br/>

I love this!  I think analogies are great for expressing emotional truths.<br/>
