 </span></blockquote>I worry about this all the time with my almost 2 year old.  She spends a<br/>
considerable amount of time watching toddler programs that are geared for<br/>
children entering the school system.  And I cringe every time they focus<br/>
on rewards and punishments and busywork and all of the things we want to<br/>
avoid by unschooling.  Franklin and Little Bear are the worst I think<br/>
because they&#39;re about &quot;days in life of&quot;.  At least Sesame Street and<br/>
Teletubbies are just about learning and not &quot;going to school&quot;.  I&#39;d love<br/>
to hear other thoughts as well.<br/>
