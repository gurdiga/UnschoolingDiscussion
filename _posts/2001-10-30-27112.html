When did we respond to pleas from &quot;the Jews&quot;? If you believe our government <br/>
in any way responded to the plight of the Jews in Europe in the Nazi era you <br/>
are mistaken, I&#39;m afraid. Our government steadfastly refused to respond or <br/>
help right up until the end of the war, and then claimed that no one knew <br/>
before then. <br/>

now.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am so sad.  I mourn for the country America could have been, once almost<br/>
was, now never will be.<br/>
<br/>
I am hostile to law enforcement right now.  They are taking away my rights.<br/>
<br/>
I am not afraid of bin Laden and I refuse to be intimidated by our<br/>
government.  Guess Ashcroft was right about one thing.....we should be on<br/>
high alert.<br/>
<br/>
Some college students were protesting the war just this last weekend in NYC.<br/>
Their permit forced them to break up into small groups.....only to cover a<br/>
10foot deep space separated from the other groups by the length of a block.<br/>
Then NYC firetrucks were allowed to park next to them and blow their sirens.<br/>
Anyone walking along the street who stopped to listen to the protest was<br/>
told by police to keep moving.  What happened to our right to assemble?  I<br/>
got this information straight from a student on another list who was present<br/>
at the demonstration.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-167050366">In response to Bridget,<br/>
 I added the disclaimers for your benefit, I don&#39;t know what else to say. I<br/>
tried to word things so my intentions and message wouldn&#39;t be misunderstood<br/>
as they were on the other list. I love to read the British papers online,<br/>
but I don&#39;t think they offer much of a different perspective. The paper I<br/>
treasure the most is the Christian Science Monitor, they are not profitable<br/>
and are not owned by anyone with an objective other than doing the best job<br/>
not to be biased. The monitor offers  great glimpses of people around the<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
On a different note, I have been reading some of the links with assumptions<br/>
about news,i.e., Gore really won Florida, and it the information is being<br/>
hushed. These stories are just as sensational and irresponsible as some<br/>
extreme right winged news people, and the apparent objective is to agitate.<br/>
I don&#39;t see any sign of the basic five W&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
The Florida election was tainted from the beginning, because there was a<br/>
margin of error. All candidates knew this prior to the election. The media<br/>
shouldn&#39;t have called a winner  before the polls closed.  Jesse Jackson<br/>
shouldn&#39;t have called for a re-vote-knowing it was an impossibility, but was<br/>
agitating nevertheless, and maybe people who think they voted wrong, should<br/>
have corrected it at the time. I voted in West Palm Beach , in the center of<br/>
town, for 8 years, and never ran into a bully-all I ever encountered were<br/>
sweet, elderly people, that were willing to bend over backwards to assist,<br/>
and lines of 5 minutes or less. Also, despite news stories, Palm Beach<br/>
County is a very large county,and  it isn&#39;t surprising that there were<br/>
Buchanan supporters. If one drives out of the center, the chances are pretty<br/>
likely that you&#39;ll see a truck with a big ole rebel flag, and not<br/>
nessacerily sons and daughters of the Confederates, but people that have put<br/>
new meaning on that flag. (I don&#39;t mean to imply that all of the hype about<br/>
Pat is true, I don&#39;t really know).<br/>
All we can do is move on; because by law, and just as likely, as not likely,<br/>
Bush won by votes. He is the President.<br/>
I am inspired and can feel the Spirit of America which is the loving Spirit<br/>
of the world, past generations, and future.<br/>
Sorry, getting soap-boxy and sappy, but remaining patriotic in Ohio.<br/>

The &quot;supposed&quot; threats that are secret and vague are concerning to me.<br/>
Seems like every time people start questioning the government, we get warned<br/>
of an impending threat somewhere, with something, from somebody.<br/>
<br/>
Also, talks of government sanctioned assassinations and secret military<br/>
tribunals instead of trials...Sweeping surveillance of citizens in case they<br/>

think we need to look at the issue in depth to figure out exactly <br/>
what went wrong and why.  Not so we can challenge the standing <br/>

ever happen again.<br/>

FBI Considers Torture as Suspects Stay Silent<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
AMERICAN investigators are considering resorting to harsher<br/>
interrogation<br/>
techniques, including torture, after facing a wall of silence from<br/>
jailed<br/>
suspected members of Osama bin Laden&#39;s al-Qaeda network, according to a<br/>
report yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
More than 150 people who were picked up after September 11 remain in<br/>
custody, with four men the focus of particularly intense scrutiny. But<br/>
investigators have found the usual methods have failed to persuade any<br/>
of<br/>
them to talk.<br/>
<br/>
Options being weighed include &quot;truth&quot; drugs, pressure tactics and<br/>
extraditing the suspects to countries whose security services are more<br/>
used to employing a heavy-handed approach during interrogations.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re into this thing for 35 days and nobody is talking. Frustration<br/>
has<br/>
begun to appear,&quot; a senior FBI official told The Washington Post.<br/>
<br/>
Under US law, evidence extracted using physical pressure or torture is<br/>
inadmissible in court and interrogators could also face criminal charges<br/>
<br/>
for employing such methods. However, investigators suggested that the<br/>
time<br/>
might soon come when a truth serum, such as sodium pentothal, would be<br/>
deemed an acceptable tool for interrogators.<br/>
<br/>
The public pressure for results in the war on terrorism might also<br/>
persuade the FBI to encourage the countries of suspects to seek their<br/>
extradition, in the knowledge that they could be given a much rougher<br/>
reception in jails back home.<br/>
<br/>
One of the four key suspects is Zacarias Moussaoui, a French Moroccan,<br/>
suspected of being a twentieth hijacker who failed to make it on board<br/>
the<br/>
plane that crashed in Pennsylvania. Moussaoui was detained after he<br/>
acted<br/>
suspiciously at a Minnesota flying school, requesting lessons in how to<br/>
steer a plane but not how to take off or land. Both Morocco and France<br/>
are<br/>
regarded as having harsher interrogation methods than the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The investigators have been disappointed that the usual incentives to<br/>
break suspects, such as promises of shorter sentences, money, jobs and<br/>
new<br/>
lives in the witness protection program, have failed to break the<br/>
silence.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are known for humanitarian treatment, so basically we are stuck.<br/>
Usually there is some incentive, some angle to play, what you can do for<br/>
<br/>
them. But it could get to that spot where we could go to pressure . . .<br/>
where we don&#39;t have a choice, and we are probably getting there,&quot; an FBI<br/>
<br/>
agent involved in the investigation told the paper.<br/>
<br/>
The other key suspects being held in New York are Mohammed Jaweed Azmath<br/>
<br/>
and Ayub Ali Khan, Indians who were caught the day after the attacks<br/>
traveling with false passports, craft knives such as those used in the<br/>
hijackings and hair dye. Nabil Almarabh, a Boston taxi driver alleged to<br/>
<br/>
have links to al-Qaeda, is also being held. Some legal experts believe<br/>
that the US Supreme Court, which has a conservative tilt, might be<br/>
prepared to support curtailing the civil liberties of prisoners in<br/>
terrorism cases.<br/>
<br/>
However, a warning that torture should be avoided came from Robert<br/>
Blitzer, a former head of the FBI&#39;s counter-terrorism section. He said<br/>
that the practice &quot;goes against every grain in my body. Chances are you<br/>
are going to get the wrong person and risk damage or killing them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In all, about 800 people have been rounded up since the attacks, most of<br/>
<br/>
whom are expected to be found to be innocent. Investigators believe<br/>
there<br/>
could be hundreds of people linked to al-Qaeda living in the US, and the<br/>
<br/>
Bush Administration has issued a warning that more attacks are probably<br/>
being planned.<br/>
<br/>
Newsweek magazine reports today that Mohammed Atta, the suspected<br/>
ringleader who died in the first plane to hit the World Trade Center,<br/>
had<br/>
been looking into hitting an aircraft carrier. Investigators retracing<br/>
his<br/>
movements found that he visited the huge US Navy base at Norfolk,<br/>
Virginia, in February and April this year.<br/>
