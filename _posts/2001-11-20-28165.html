<br/>
I am telling you something real, and you&#39;re predicting the outcome in most <br/>
definite terms.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of familes here not &quot;making&quot; their kids do dishes, who are not <br/>
out of dishes.<br/>
<br/>
When I don&#39;t like the mess, I do the dishes.  If I never did the dishes, if I <br/>
didn&#39;t mind the mess, someone else would get tired of it sooner than I did.<br/>
<br/>
What should be the percentage of my dishwashing?  Should I only wash those I <br/>
eat from?  1/6, 1/5, 1/2?   I am NOT going to start counting up, timing, or <br/>
otherwise measuring dishwashing in my house.  That would be more work and <br/>
grief than if I did all the dishes every day forevermore.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But that just doesn&#39;t happen, and I don&#39;t know how else to explain it.<br/>
Our family doesn&#39;t run that way. The families we have known who don&#39;t<br/>
assign chores or make people get up and clean don&#39;t work that way. It&#39;s<br/>
just not an adversarial relationship with someone trying to make someone<br/>
else do things. <br/>
<br/>
Last night I plopped down on the couch next to Cacie with a full laundry<br/>
basket ready to be folded, and I was sort of surprised that she didn&#39;t<br/>
start folding with me. She usually does. I could have said something, I<br/>
guess, but I didn&#39;t, and as time went on I realized that she was really<br/>
intently watching the video we had on, and later on she even wrote some<br/>
notes about it. To me, that&#39;s more important than helping me fold<br/>
laundry, and it really wasn&#39;t that big of a deal for me to do it all. <br/>
OTOH, later that evening she went and cleaned the catbox, a job no one<br/>
has ever assigned to her, a job that she actually taught herself to do by<br/>
watching me and started doing fairly regularly. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820163913">Oops, sorry, you&#39;re right (was it Sandra?)... I shouldn&#39;t have extrapolated <br/>
my experience to your family.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if dishes pile up at *other* people&#39;s houses, someone else in the <br/>
family besides the chief dishwasher notices it and washes them. That never <br/>
happened when I had housemates. That doesn&#39;t happen in my family, either, at <br/>
least not promptly enough to suit moi. Ergo, chores.<br/>
<br/>
But dishes (mine, yours, anyone&#39;s) weren&#39;t the point! The point was simply <br/>
that you CAN have chores and limits and STILL allow your children to learn <br/>
and grow at their own pace. You can ditch the school system, but you don&#39;t <br/>
have to ditch parental responsibility.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1605<br/>
&gt;Date: Tue, Nov 20, 2001, 4:30 PM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If I didn&#39;t like the mess, I&#39;d do the dishes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And then you&#39;d end up always doing the dishes, and never having dishes when<br/>
&gt; you want to eat, and that sucks!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If nobody else did the dishes (which in our household is a fact, I do the<br/>
dishes, period. More on that in a minute) and I had a *problem* with that,<br/>
I&#39;d ask for help and I&#39;d get it. It wouldn&#39;t suck, it would be a small point<br/>
in our family life that if I felt irritable about being the sole dish-doer<br/>
I&#39;d address. But I would not expect to assign one of my children to do it,<br/>
any more than I&#39;d expect to assign my husband to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Now, a fact of nature in our house is that I don&#39;t mind doing dishes.<br/>
Sometimes, I actively enjoy it. So I do the dishes, because my daughters<br/>
really aren&#39;t old enough (if later they find they enjoy them, too, we&#39;ll<br/>
find ways to take turns) and my husband hates doing them.<br/>
<br/>
Me, I hate lawn mowing. Really detest it, so my husband, who rather likes<br/>
making the yard look nice, does that. We both do laundry, as we can take it<br/>
or leave it. We all all fold clothes and put them away, without needing to<br/>
talk about it or assign it. We all pick up in general. We all vacuum. We all<br/>
dust, though usually I&#39;m the first to notice it and the rest get in on the<br/>
act.<br/>
<br/>
If one of us bothered by a mess, we tend to clean it. If we&#39;re bothered and<br/>
want help, we ask nicely for it and get help.<br/>
<br/>
But there is no difference between how the adults or children are treated in<br/>
the asking.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t grow up in a family like this. I grew up in a family that used<br/>
every single solitary chore-devising and tracking method known to man, and<br/>
not one of us ever voluntarily cleaned up anything in that house, only the<br/>
bare minimum of what was assigned and enforced, if that.<br/>
<br/>
I find the way we have now a lot more relaxing, a lot more calm and warm and<br/>
respectful.<br/>

responsibility.  Can you not see that, just as we all handle our <br/>
responsibility for our children&#39;s education a little differently, so do we <br/>
all handle our *parental responsibility* differently?  Doing things <br/>
differently from the way you do them, doesn&#39;t need to result in an <br/>
accusation of irresponsibility.  (And as long as you are looking at it as <br/>
irresponsibility, you&#39;ll never need to really look at the idea in terms of <br/>
what value it might have.)  Keep in mind that I&#39;m a parent who *does* <br/>
assign a chore, though I&#39;m not at all rigid about it.<br/>

I had a same-age cousin who lived with us.  She used to volunteer to do <br/>
housework sometimes--and big stuff, like mopping, or cleaning bathrooms.  It <br/>
was (official decision of the other kids) STUPID to do that.  She was sucking <br/>
up, at best.<br/>
<br/>
If Holly gets the urge to clean a bathroom, she can do just a little and <br/>
that&#39;s cool.  <br/>
If I assign her (force her) to clean it, her options are to do a perfect job <br/>
and get no big thanks, or to do a crummier job and earn criticism.  There&#39;s <br/>
not a winning situation for her, really.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s not forced and she does a great, full job, it&#39;s wonderful!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967556561">Anybody have suggestions on non-scary cartoons (in video form) for our son<br/>
Tyler, who is two and a half? He much prefers cartoons to other videos. I<br/>
prefer videos to TV for him. (And I do try to keep his viewing time to about<br/>
an hour a day  until very recently he didnt watch anywhere near that  but<br/>
time limits are of course a different subject and one thats being discussed<br/>
in other threads.)<br/>
<br/>
We have a family bed, so I sometimes know (because I hear the words he<br/>
says) what makes Tyler occasionally cry out in his sleep. A couple of times<br/>
it has been scary scenes from TV.<br/>
<br/>
(Once, though, it was a scene from a seemingly inoffensive Frog and Toad<br/>
book I had read aloud to him. Tyler moaned, Hole, hole! in his sleep. The<br/>
next day he searched out the book and said, Hole!, and I had to find the<br/>
page with the part about the hole for him. The story was about Toad worrying<br/>
that, because Frog was late to his birthday party, he might have fallen into<br/>
a hole/been eaten by monsters/gotten lost/etc. Because these are just the<br/>
morbid imaginings of Toad, who tends to be a worrywart, it hadnt bothered<br/>
me, but of course Tyler saw the worrying bit and Toads going to get a rope<br/>
to rescue Frog, and was not equally impressed by the happy ending in which<br/>
Frog showed up, late to the party only because he had been wrapping Toads<br/>
gift.)<br/>
<br/>
We like the George and Martha (hippos) videos so far. I guess Arthur videos<br/>
are okay, except that I dont like the way the kids sometimes tease each<br/>
other in a sing-songy, nah-nah-nah-nah tone (You cant go to camp! Were<br/>
going on vacation!), as if this were just the way kids are.<br/>
<br/>
Im saying non-scary rather than non-violent because some might not<br/>
consider a cartoon in which sharks attack a boat with kids in it to be<br/>
violent (The Wild Thornberrys, on TV one Sunday - the kids got away<br/>
unharmed). I told my husband I dont really want Tyler seeing sharks<br/>
(crocodiles, etc.) attacking people, even if it is a supposedly<br/>
pro-environmental cartoon about an interesting (and apparently<br/>
homeschooling) family of world travelers. He said, Dont you think its a<br/>
good idea for him to learn that sharks can be dangerous?<br/>
<br/>
I said, Later in life. Right now hes had only three or four real-life<br/>
experiences in lakes and at beaches, and I dont want him being afraid of<br/>
something that isnt even there. When we go somewhere where there are<br/>
crocodiles/sharks/etc., we should be the ones to worry about it, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I also told him about the nine-year-old city kids in the Fresh Air Fund<br/>
summer camp I used to work at who were afraid to go near the lake because of<br/>
Jason (some murderous undead thing that comes out of a lake in the movie<br/>
Friday the 13th, I was told). Doesnt seem fair to me to hit kids with this<br/>
before they have any substantial experience in nature to counteract it. He<br/>
saw my point.<br/>
<br/>
We liked one Babar video, but then suddenly found ourselves watching another<br/>
one featuring a war, complete with the razing and burning of an elephant<br/>
village, the capturing of elephant slaves (who were then whipped), the mommy<br/>
elephant with a metal collar and ropes around her neck, fleeing baby<br/>
elephants, etc. My fault for not paying attention to the title or synopsis<br/>
on the video case, I suppose. Tyler started getting scared but didnt want<br/>
to turn it off. So I let him watch the whole darn thing to the end and then<br/>
tried to tell him it didnt really happen, that it was pretend and a story<br/>
someone made up. Dont think that works.<br/>
<br/>
Later that day he cried during his sleep  dont know whether it was because<br/>
of this video. I told him we werent going to watch it again because it was<br/>
too scary and I didnt like it. He cried but I put it out of his reach.<br/>
Later he seemed happy with George and Martha. Then I started wondering<br/>
whether, if you screw up and let a kid this age see something scary like<br/>
this a first time through, youve really got to let them watch it again and<br/>
again to process it. Dont know. Just want to avoid his seeing this sort<br/>
of stuff in the first place, as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
He seems to understand an awful lot about the world, but his grasp of what<br/>
pictures are supposed to stand for is still tenuous. The other day I was<br/>
reading him a book in which two boys are sitting on the floor with a big<br/>
picturebook in front of them, and he said, Book fall! I then realized that<br/>
there was blankness where the floor was supposed to be, and that it was only<br/>
from other clues that I could tell the book was actually resting on the<br/>
floor and not hanging in midair. This is why I really prefer books  I have<br/>
more of a chance to answer his questions or concerns.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>K- I&#39;ll list a few of our favorites. We usually watch them on Nick Jr., <br/>
or Noggin. They are popular with my preschooler, and have no <br/>
commercials during the program. Just piled up in between programs. If <br/>
you don&#39;t have those available, the library, or rental might have them.<br/>
<br/>
We like <br/>
<br/>
(from Nick Jr.)<br/>
<br/>
1. Dora the Explorer- girl hero uses spanish and english, simple maps, <br/>
goes on mini qeusts to help solve problems with friends. Lots of <br/>
thinking, gentle puzzles, and viewer participation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Blues Clues- Steve (&quot;not the sharpest knife in the drawer&quot;) follows <br/>
clues left by his girl puppy Blue to find out what Blue wants to do <br/>
today. Also lots of thinking, gentle puzzles and viewer participation.<br/>
<br/>
3. Little Bear- very imaginative simple tales of Little Bear and his <br/>
friends. Warm and fuzzy, yet not dull or syrupy.<br/>
<br/>
There are others on Nick Jr. or Nogin that you might like.<br/>
<br/>
On Disney Channel my kids like Rolie Polie Olie, PB&J Otter, and some <br/>
people like Bear in the Big Blue House. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Not on cable/dish tv. probably only rent or library)-<br/>
<br/>
1.Veggie Tales- Depending on your beliefs about religion and <br/>
indoctrination, you may or may not like this series. It is true to <br/>
itself as a Christian cartoon series. I am not Christian so I have <br/>
mixed feelings about the series. We enjoy the humor, the songs, and the <br/>
computer animation. Sometimes we will take what we like from it, and <br/>
leave the rest. Other times it annoys me with it&#39;s presentation of <br/>
religion as fact, or as the only reason for moral behavior. They talk <br/>
about the Christian God, sometimes in a story from the Christian Bible, <br/>
or just at the end as a quote from same. The lessons don&#39;t come across <br/>
heavy, but they can be something to talk about with themes of <br/>
forgiveness, thankfulness, generosity, etc., and discussions of your <br/>
own religious beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
2. &quot;There Goes a Truck&quot;, or a plane or space shuttle, etc. These aren&#39;t <br/>
cartoon, but my kid really likes them. They are videos of real trucks, <br/>
or whatever the topic is and have a variety of (to my 4y kid) &quot;cool <br/>
stuff that you don&#39;t see everyday.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
E-&quot; I guess Arthur videos<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; are okay, except that I don&#39;t like the way the kids sometimes tease each<br/>
&gt; other in a sing-songy, nah-nah-nah-nah tone (You can&#39;t go to camp! We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; going on vacation!), as if this were just &quot;the way kids are.&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Boy do I know what you mean there. I liked some Arthur, and other aimed <br/>
at kids stuff, but alot of it is filled with rudeness presented as <br/>
&quot;normal&quot;. I also hated the new baby episode that implies all babies <br/>
must have bottles, have horribly stinky diapers, and must sleep in a <br/>
cage in another room and scream all night. But that&#39;s seen as normal in <br/>
our society partly because of cartoons like this that reinforce it as <br/>
normal. I know it&#39;s not the fault of the cartoon, it&#39;s just annoying to <br/>
see the same old story. We did talk after the show about why people <br/>
think babies are that way, and how for many families, babies are not <br/>
like that. Breastfeeding, and sharing sleep, get rid of most of those <br/>
three problems.<br/>
<br/>
Whew, got carried away. Back to the suject.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
E-&quot; This is why I really prefer books  I have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; more of a chance to answer his questions or concerns.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Elsa Haas&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really agree. Being there when they watch something new can also be <br/>
handy because you can have that same kind of chance. It also gives you <br/>
the chance to explore the story with him. You can ask him questions <br/>
about the material like &quot;Why do you think this character acted that <br/>
way?&quot;, &quot;How did that character feel when...?&quot;, or &quot;What do you think <br/>
the character could have done instead?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hope that might help a little.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556515508">My dd is 3 1/2 and is VERY sensitive....she cries during Charlotte&#39;s Web<br/>
when the farmers wife whisks the pig out of the house with a broom.  She saw<br/>
Beauty and the Beast at a friend&#39;s house and remains afraid of the Beast.<br/>
She seems to have a grasp on real v. imaginary, but that doesn&#39;t mean she<br/>
likes to watch the imaginary....<br/>
<br/>
DD has liked the Little Bear videos....nicely paced...but we haven&#39;t watched<br/>
very many of them, so I don&#39;t know how they all are.  She&#39;s on a BIG Land<br/>
Before Time kick....everyday.  So far we&#39;ve seen three different ones.  We<br/>
are avoiding the first one, I&#39;ve been told the mother dies in that one....my<br/>
son died just three and half months ago, so we&#39;ll skip that one for a long<br/>
time.  We have been liking them.  I&#39;m not sure they are accurate in their<br/>
representation of dinosaurs time-wise....and the meat eaters always end up<br/>
looking like &#39;bad&#39; guys.  Some parts are a little scary...earth shakes,<br/>
sharp-teeth attacks...but DD is rather sensitive and she&#39;s been OK with<br/>
these scenes....she watched them all at least once from our laps...now she<br/>
watches them on her own, but will go behind a chair for the scary parts and<br/>
watch from there.  I hesitate to recommend stuff to other people...it&#39;s so<br/>
individual, but these are the current big hit in our house.  Past hits have<br/>
included Blues Clues, Madeliene in Cooking School and the first Madeliene<br/>
(AVOID Madeliene in Paris!!!!!  Horrible!  She&#39;s kidnapped and put into<br/>
forced labor!  I was HORRIFIED and DD was TERRIFIED...so we have had a<br/>
situation similar to yours Elsa).  Richard Scarry was an everyday request<br/>
for a long time.  As were many of the Barney videos...ugh, those songs were<br/>
in my head for months!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-239786906">&lt;&lt; Then I started wondering<br/>
<br/>
whether, if you screw up and let a kid this age see something scary like<br/>
<br/>
this a first time through, you’ve really got to let them watch it again and<br/>
<br/>
again to “process” it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would sit and watch it with him and do a commentary.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were that age they really liked Disney Singalong videos, and <br/>
there are two Raffi videos.  Maybe he would like musical stuff?  There&#39;s also <br/>
a Land Before Time singalong (so you get the dinosaurs without the <br/>
obligatory-per-movie chase scene with Cera screaming her head off, which I <br/>
hate and which scares babies).<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was afraid of the Pirates of the Caribbean, on the video.  He was <br/>
scooting so far back up on a big upholstered chair once he was perched up on <br/>
the back of it with no further back to scoot.  He couldn&#39;t take his eyes off <br/>
the show, but the song and music and faces were scaring him.   After that I <br/>
told him if anything scary came on to call  me.   He would, and I&#39;d either <br/>
sit and talk through it (which breaks the spell of the soundtrack) or I&#39;d <br/>
fast-forward if he&#39;d rather.<br/>
<br/>
Muppets (Follow that Bird is one of my favorites, but it&#39;s sad, and somewhat <br/>
slow and deep for little kids; Muppets Take Manhattan is easier and quicker), <br/>
Sesame Street videos.<br/>
<br/>
Animaniacs Singalongs, Muppet Singaongs.<br/>
<br/>
Movies?  There are kid-friendly movies.<br/>

These are all great! This made me LOL! My dd was<br/>
scared of the bit in The Snowman where they&#39;re at the<br/>
party and the balloons pop! There is no sound of the<br/>
popping (just lovely music), but she was so terrified<br/>
of popping balloons when she was little (still is a<br/>

that bit! <br/>

If none of the kids are interested in being Chief BottleWasher, as it were,<br/>

then you might consider hiring someone. Or bartering with someone. Or buy a<br/>

everything. :)<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t really hate doing them but hate the idea of being the only one<br/>
who does, I&#39;d work more on your attitude (if it was mine) and worry less<br/>
over the Moral Impropriety of a child not doing any dishes. :)<br/>
<br/>
If you only hate doing them sometimes, you could say so and ask for help at<br/>
those times. &quot;Hey, family, I can&#39;t face these horrible dishes today. Will<br/>
someone PLEASE do them for me?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-867156303">Pam,<br/>
<br/>
Your ideas are great, and I have used most of them, and have mostly just<br/>
done the dishes myself.  But you see, it is not exactly just doing the<br/>
dishes.  It is finding the dishes whereever they have been laid down, taking<br/>
them to the kitchen, and then doing them.<br/>
<br/>
My real desire, of course, would be for the kids (and husband if we are<br/>
being honest here), to take the dishes to the kitchen and put them in the<br/>
dishwasher.  It is especially bad when part of the family is home, and I am<br/>
off driving to various activities.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  Yesterday my daughter had play practice (45  minute drive each<br/>
way) and we had to return videos, library books, take clothes to thrift<br/>
store, etc.  We got home at 5:00, and needed to leave at 5:30 to go to<br/>
AWANA, another 35 minute drive each way in the other direction.  (We live in<br/>
the middle of nowhere).<br/>
<br/>
The point here is, I am tired at this time!  And I walk into a hourse with<br/>
dirty dishes everywhere, food left out, wrappers, etc. on the counter.  This<br/>
all done by the two which were home (husband and son).<br/>
<br/>
My desire would to be to come home to a house where someone has realized I<br/>
have been running all day and would have taken the responsibility to clean<br/>
up after themselves.  My question is, how do I get there without making it a<br/>
requirement?  I really don&#39;t want to make it a requirement.  I want them to<br/>
see that they are leaving a mess and want to clean it up, or at least clean<br/>
some of it up because they know it bothers me, or something.<br/>
<br/>
What I did do was the dishes.  And I don&#39;t know if that is the problem.<br/>
They expect that I will come home and do them.  They expect that I will come<br/>
home and do them without complaining about it, etc.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My desire would to be to come home to a house where someone has realized I<br/>
have been running all day and would have taken the responsibility to clean<br/>
up after themselves.  My question is, how do I get there without making it a<br/>
requirement?  I really don&#39;t want to make it a requirement.  I want them to<br/>
see that they are leaving a mess and want to clean it up, or at least clean<br/>
some of it up because they know it bothers me, or something. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ask them if they could clean up the kitchen while you&#39;re gone.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re still the one who wants it done.  You&#39;re asking them to do something <br/>
you want done. <br/>
Obviously it&#39;s not  high on their list of priorities.  But I bet they&#39;d say <br/>
&quot;okay&quot; if you asked.<br/>

done it.<br/>

(I am not trying to be difficult, even though it sounds like it : - )<br/>
