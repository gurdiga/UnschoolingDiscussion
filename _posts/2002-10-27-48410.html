&lt;&lt; None of the above situations would bother me in the slightest to be <br/>
honest although I may point out to my child that wearing a satanic <br/>
t-shirt might lead to encounters with narrow minded bigots.<br/>

t-shirt&quot; would be a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, for all the Christians make noise about Satan, he only exists <br/>
within the framework of THEIR RELIGION.  For non Christians there is no such <br/>
thing as Satan.  For agnostics or atheists there is no such thing as Satan.  <br/>
For Buddhists, Hindus, no.  (Although Hindus have some war-involved deities, <br/>
but not one boogie man who takes little children and ruins their lives, or <br/>
who tries to keep people from God.)<br/>
<br/>
Satan is part and parcel of Christianity.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess if there are &quot;satanic t-shirts&quot; what they exist to do is to piss <br/>
off Christian parents.<br/>

I think there are teenagers who go through a &quot;let&#39;s be freaky&quot; phase and do <br/>
outrageous things.<br/>

Most Satanists I have met are in the Temple of Set (robes and very <br/>
middle class) or The Chrch of Lucifer (bit odder but nothing to worry <br/>
about).<br/>
I&#39;ve met a few of the balck robes n dead chickens lot too. They <br/>
seem to fall into two camps. Those who are serious about their <br/>
path and those who think dressing up in black and sacrficing <br/>
chickens is &#39;cool&#39;<br/>
A fair few teens go for the second lot. It tends to wear off.<br/>
