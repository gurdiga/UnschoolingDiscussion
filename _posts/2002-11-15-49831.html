I can&#39;t shed much light on it. I think it&#39;s natural, seeing as you are very <br/>
musical though.<br/>
I was incredibly attracted to my dh before I knew about his musical <br/>
abilities, but after he played guitar for me it sealed the deal. <br/>
There is something very sexy about a man that plays guitar to me. And then he <br/>
plays keyboard, drums, had a history with trombone etc....<br/>
He&#39;s very musical, so I understand being comfortable with musical types. <br/>
Musicians are usually free spirited and interesting.<br/>

OOOOH!!<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be wild if musical intelligence turned out to be the greatest <br/>
indicating factor for unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
One family I know the dad wants to unschool (he&#39;s a musician AND into <br/>
science/medicine) but his wife doesn&#39;t (NOT a musician &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
But one family that came into my unschooling group when that was really <br/>
active dropped out in a few months and started a pretty severely structured <br/>
group and co-op.  Both parents were musicians.  But maybe in the <br/>
over-the-edge of structure way.  He was the conductor of the symphony (and <br/>
didn&#39;t last long here, I don&#39;t know why; maybe his dissatisfaction with such <br/>
an environment, in Albuquerque; he was Brit and uptight Brit), and his wife <br/>
was a concert violinist who travelled lots.  Some of the kids were adopted.  <br/>
ALL were studying music bigtime.<br/>
<br/>
Two points of info.  Not much.<br/>

to be a little more open minded in general.  <br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m not as musically talented as my mom.  I&#39;m unschooling and <br/>
she&#39;s a teacher who isn&#39;t too sure about my unschooling.  My husband <br/>
isn&#39;t musical at all and he&#39;s all for unschooling.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>And if it turned out to be true, where would it leave the parents without<br/>
musical intelligence? Should they do unit studies? Calvert? Keep their kids<br/>
in school?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a lack of a need to control is a skill involved in being a &quot;natural&quot;<br/>
unschooler and having high musical intelligence. But that doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
everyone else is zero on the scale. Everyone will be able to get unschooling<br/>
(and music) to a more or less degree.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s better for the kids? Parents who recognize they don&#39;t have the<br/>
potential to be virtuoso unschoolers or parents who have the ability to<br/>
recognize there are hurdles between where they are and where they&#39;d like to<br/>
be?<br/>
<br/>
I think having parents with the natural ability to unschool is a lucky<br/>
thing. But are those kids the only ones who can benefit from unschooling?<br/>
Can&#39;t it be valuable to the kids if their parents recognize unschooling&#39;s<br/>
merits even if the parents have (perhaps untimately insurmountable) hurdles<br/>
in the way? Isn&#39;t recognizing the merits of unschooling self-selecting? Can<br/>
parents who can&#39;t unschool be drawn to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I think people can *misunderstand* what unschooling is. They can be drawn to<br/>
what they *think* unschooling is, like letting the kids &quot;educate themselves&quot;<br/>
so the parents can give up the hassle of making the kids do school work. But<br/>
isn&#39;t it more likely that someone would seek justification to nonparent<br/>
because of personal problems than because they lacked the natural ability to<br/>
unschool? Would those kind of parents hang around someplace long enough to<br/>
be shown why they can&#39;t unschool? And what reason would they have to accept<br/>
that judgement as true? Would being told they don&#39;t have &quot;unschooling<br/>
intelligence&quot; stop them from neglecting their children?<br/>
<br/>
So perhaps in addition to being drawn to unschooling, even more important is<br/>
the ability to self-examine, to be *able* to recognize how far you are from<br/>
where you&#39;d like to be. And to be *willing* to examine those inner hurdles<br/>
and try to get around them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s being a musician that even makes you ask the question ;-) With<br/>
music there are many instances where there&#39;s obviously a right way to do<br/>
something. Being honest with those who can&#39;t do it right is helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Though there are right ways and wrong ways to unschool as there are right<br/>
ways and wrong ways to play ballads, a greater part of being able to<br/>
unschool is the ability to apply it to someone&#39;s own life. It&#39;s the ability<br/>
to recognize the essence without concern for the details. It&#39;s the ability<br/>
to recognize what is and isn&#39;t a ballad and the desire to find ways to tweak<br/>
it towards being more ballad like, I think, rather than the ability to<br/>
reproduce a particular ballad that&#39;s more akin to unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you really believe that everyone can get unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m totally willing to withdraw the music idea.  It was put out as a goof, to <br/>
see what responses came.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t believe that anyone can get unschooling to a degree.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What&#39;s better for the kids? Parents who recognize they don&#39;t have the<br/>
potential to be virtuoso unschoolers or parents who have the ability to<br/>
recognize there are hurdles between where they are and where they&#39;d like to<br/>
be?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, there it is.  They have to think they&#39;d like to be there.<br/>
And those who think they would like to be there have to be willing to GET <br/>
there, not sit and ask people to bring it to them and sing it in their ear.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Isn&#39;t recognizing the merits of unschooling self-selecting? Can<br/>
parents who can&#39;t unschool be drawn to unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What would that really mean?  You mean they can listen to unschooling on the <br/>
radio (perhaps that would mean reading www.unschooling.com and thinking it <br/>
sounded good) but not perform themselves?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But isn&#39;t it more likely that someone would seek justification to nonparent<br/>
because of personal problems than because they lacked the natural ability to<br/>
unschool?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the difference?<br/>
Personal problems can BE the inability to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Would those kind of parents hang around someplace long enough to<br/>
be shown why they can&#39;t unschool? And what reason would they have to accept<br/>
that judgement as true?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People without what Gardner calls intrapersonal intelligence might see a <br/>
failure, but instead of taking it personally, they sometimes declare <br/>
&quot;Unschooling doesn&#39;t work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they&#39;re as right as I would be if I said &quot;Unschooling DOES work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess I need to keep remembering to say &quot;Unschooling can work if...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So perhaps in addition to being drawn to unschooling, even more important is<br/>
the ability to self-examine, to be *able* to recognize how far you are from<br/>
where you&#39;d like to be. And to be *willing* to examine those inner hurdles<br/>
and try to get around them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There it is.  If they can&#39;t &quot;self examine,&quot; perhaps unschooling isn&#39;t within <br/>
reach for them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Though there are right ways and wrong ways to unschool as there are right<br/>
ways and wrong ways to play ballads&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are more-traditional and less-traditional ways to present ballads.  <br/>
&quot;Right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; are way subjective as regards art.<br/>
<br/>
There are efficient and workable ways to unschool, and there are combinations <br/>
of actions which should not in good conscience be called &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s the ability to recognize the essence without concern for the details.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t, to me:  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s the ability to recognize what is and isn&#39;t a ballad and the desire to <br/>
find ways to tweak<br/>
it towards being more ballad like, I think, rather than the ability to<br/>
reproduce a particular ballad that&#39;s more akin to unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Trying to make a ballad out of something that isn&#39;t has no productive value.<br/>
Collecting and performing ballads is like being an antiques collector.  No <br/>
sense taking a modern pocket knife and trying to tweak it to seem to be an <br/>
18th century knife.  Just keep looking for an 18th century knife, and let the <br/>
modern one be what it is.<br/>
<br/>
One good ballad, albeit not &quot;traditional&quot; but composed, is the themesong to <br/>
Gilligan&#39;s Island.   <br/>

<br/>
I went to school and I hated it.  I resented having to ask for <br/>
permission to go to the bathroom.  Once, as a high school senior, I <br/>
asked for permission to go to the bathroom, and the teacher <br/>
said, &quot;Are you sure you have to?&quot;  I resented not having time to do <br/>
things I liked because I had all kinds of homework to do.  I felt <br/>
like I was in a prison. (I was.)  Now, if I had parents who didn&#39;t <br/>
make me go to schol, I wouldn&#39;t have gone.  If my parents hadn&#39;t done <br/>
anything at all to encourage my interests outside of school, I still <br/>
would have been happier outside of school.  My brother felt similarly <br/>
to me about school, but instead of sticking it out like I did, he <br/>
dropped out.  My parents didn&#39;t do a lot to encourage his natural <br/>
interests (not that they didn&#39;t care about him, but because they <br/>
thought being a good parent meant trying to figure out how to get him <br/>
to go to school and be responsible).  Yet, he taught himself all <br/>
kinds of valuable things that led to an interesting college major.  <br/>
(music! lol)  Would my brother have been better off if my mom had <br/>
been interested in his guitar playing and tried to provide all kinds <br/>
of interesting things for him, driving him places, buying him new <br/>
music, etc.?  Probably.  But if the choice is only between going to <br/>
school or not going to school and being left to oneself, I would pick <br/>
being left to oneself.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I think that when someone doesn&#39;t go to school and <br/>
is basically neglected by the parents (especially at a younger age), <br/>
a lot of emotional issues can develop.  i don&#39;t think this is a good <br/>
situation at all.  But a lot of emotional issues can develop from <br/>
going to school too.  At least the child is free.  There are no <br/>
truancy officers at the door ready to escort him to school if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel like going, there is no screaming because the parents <br/>
don&#39;t want to pay truancy fines.  There are no phone calls from the <br/>
school wondering where the child is.  There is no stigma of bad <br/>
grades on a permanent record if the child didn&#39;t feel like doing <br/>
hours of homework at night to get good grades.  The child has a <br/>
chance, at least, to make something of himself instead of submitting <br/>
to school&#39;s desire to mold him into something he is not.  <br/>

How are they going to want to change having no interest in it?<br/>
How would they begin to change &quot;not willing to be different&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Or are you saying that some people are innately incapable of <br/>
unschooling? Not intelligent enough or something? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Some just ask the same questions over and over, or say &quot;Tell me what to <br/>
do,&quot; or have no interest or desire to HAVE an interest in what their children <br/>
want to do.  They&#39;re hoping cleaning house and watching TV and leaving the <br/>
kids alone will somehow turn to something fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Even those who <br/>
aren&#39;t really intelligent *could* encourage their kids to explore, <br/>
expose them to lots of interesting things and people, and really take <br/>
a sincere interest in their kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well if they can do all that, they&#39;re intelligent enough.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Those kids would be better off <br/>
with sub-intelligent parents than in school with highly intelligent <br/>
teachers who make them sit and do stuff they hate. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you haven&#39;t met many sub-intelligent parents.<br/>
Some kids are better off in school.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But everyone *could* self examine if they forced themselves to, <br/>
couldn&#39;t they? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This honestly doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>
Think about it.<br/>
If they have to &quot;force themselves,&quot; then what do you think they&#39;re examining? <br/>
 And with what facilities?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Even if they had to hire a therapist to help them do <br/>
it, it is something that *could* be done.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t want to, and they don&#39;t know how to, they can&#39;t really do it.<br/>
Hiring someone else to guess for you isn&#39;t quite the same as having <br/>
intrapersonal skills.<br/>
<br/>
Personal awareness isn&#39;t a one-shot deal, where you figure out yourself and <br/>
you&#39;re done.  It&#39;s constant, it&#39;s momentary and continuing.<br/>

learning so those people won&#39;t even stop at the unschooling spot on the<br/>
dial. The idea of letting kids choose will select out the people who won&#39;t<br/>
or can&#39;t see kids choosing as a plus.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What&#39;s the difference?<br/>
&gt; Personal problems can BE the inability to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The difference is talking about finding a way to help people figure out if<br/>
they can unschool or not. I think those who sincerely want unschooling are<br/>
the ones who would take such a test to heart. And those are the ones I think<br/>
who can get unschooling. I think those who want to grasp for something easy<br/>
or are looking to be spoonfed aren&#39;t going to care one whit about whether<br/>
some test says they can do unschooling or not. That&#39;s just total gut feeling<br/>
so I could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There it is.  If they can&#39;t &quot;self examine,&quot; perhaps unschooling isn&#39;t within<br/>
&gt; reach for them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if they lack intrapersonal intelligence to assess what went wrong, are<br/>
they likely to accept the results of some test that says they can&#39;t<br/>
unschool? It seems to me self revealing tests are meaningless to those<br/>
without intrapersonal intelligence. And intrapersonal intelligence is what&#39;s<br/>
necessary to get unschooling for those who don&#39;t get unschooling right off.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess I need to keep remembering to say &quot;Unschooling can work if...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s a good idea. I think the way people explain unschooling has<br/>
evolved from the AOL days. There are things that are expressed regularly<br/>
that people hadn&#39;t thought to express before. (Or maybe it&#39;s just *my*<br/>
understanding that&#39;s grown and I see things in a different way!)<br/>
<br/>
I see people trying to express more of what unschooling is when it was more<br/>
heavily focused on what it wasn&#39;t before.<br/>
<br/>
But I think it&#39;s no where near where it could be. There are still things<br/>
about unschooling -- or more probably about getting people unstuck from the<br/>
schoolish mindset -- that people can&#39;t find words for. And it *is*<br/>
misleading. People can come away with the wrong idea of what unschooling is.<br/>
Like there&#39;s still a huge gulf between the letting kids play and being<br/>
involved in their lives aspects of unschooling. Letting kids be and<br/>
providing a rich environment for them. Child led and parent strewn. The only<br/>
way to grasp how the seemingly opposite aspects can both be true is to read<br/>
bits and pieces of people&#39;s unschooling lives.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately it&#39;s more meaningful to be presented the evidence/stories and to<br/>
draw your own conclusions, but school tends to train that ability out of<br/>
people :-/ It&#39;s no wonder people go looking for others to tell them what to<br/>
do when so much of what society says is &quot;right&quot; means ignoring the obvious<br/>
conclusions about what we&#39;re seeing, like it being the right thing to do to<br/>
walk away from a child crying at the door of preschool. Who wouldn&#39;t need to<br/>
be told what to do when society says we need to ignore our instincts in<br/>

&gt; &quot;Right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; are way subjective as regards art.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I meant as in hitting the right notes. Unschooling doesn&#39;t have right notes.<br/>
You can&#39;t buy a specific something (the right notes/product) to get a<br/>
specific result (a particular song/math skills). Unschooling has theory. And<br/>
everyone needs to first understand the theory then figure out what that<br/>
looks like given their particular children with their particular interests<br/>
and personalities. Everyone&#39;s song will be different. But all the songs will<br/>
have certain aspects in common that will make them unschooling rather than<br/>
eclectic. Like jazz songs as opposed to polkas.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There are efficient and workable ways to unschool, and there are combinations<br/>
&gt; of actions which should not in good conscience be called &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess I&#39;m more concerned that people find something that works for their<br/>
kids than that they get unschooling. I enjoy discussing unschooling but if<br/>
people take away ideas that make whatever they&#39;re doing better for their<br/>
kids, then that&#39;s a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful to people trying to get unschooling to talk<br/>
about &quot;whatever works for your family&quot; style of homeschooling. So I think<br/>
it&#39;s helpful to keep it clear what is and isn&#39;t unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Trying to make a ballad out of something that isn&#39;t has no productive value.<br/>
&gt; Collecting and performing ballads is like being an antiques collector.  No<br/>
&gt; sense taking a modern pocket knife and trying to tweak it to seem to be an<br/>
&gt; 18th century knife.  Just keep looking for an 18th century knife, and let the<br/>
&gt; modern one be what it is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One good ballad, albeit not &quot;traditional&quot; but composed, is the themesong to<br/>
&gt; Gilligan&#39;s Island.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ack, no, of course it didn&#39;t make sense! The nonmusician in me grabbed at<br/>
the first song type that popped into my head. ;-) I was really looking for a<br/>
style like jazz or blues or rock.<br/>
<br/>
(Speaking of ballads -- though maybe it&#39;s just a story with musical<br/>
accompaniment -- ironically I happened to pick up Arlo Guthrie&#39;s Greatest<br/>
Hits CD at the library with Alice&#39;s Restaurant on it last week. And even<br/>
more ironically, we serendipitously (though unfortunately before I&#39;d gotten<br/>
around to playing the CD for Kathryn) ended up in Stockbridge a couple days<br/>
later where &quot;Alice&#39;s restaurant&quot; was. Had I known we&#39;d be there and had<br/>
looked up the trivia about the song we could have seen the church (now<br/>
Guthrie Center) and the 8x10 color glossies (that were actually black and<br/>
white). And I can&#39;t figure out if the restaurant in the center that was<br/>
&quot;formerly Alice&#39;s Restaurant&quot; (closed either for the season or permanently<br/>
wasn&#39;t clear) was Alice&#39;s restaurant. (Alice&#39;s restaurant refered to in the<br/>
song was called The Wooden Spoon I think.) It&#39;s down an alley and not<br/>
&quot;around the back&quot; as in the song. Perhaps she moved it to the present<br/>
location later and renamed it Alice&#39;s Restaurant.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14561287">**Yes.  Some just ask the same questions over and over, or say &quot;Tell me<br/>
what to <br/>
do,&quot; or have no interest or desire to HAVE an interest in what their<br/>
children <br/>
want to do.  They&#39;re hoping cleaning house and watching TV and leaving<br/>
the <br/>
kids alone will somehow turn to something fascinating.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a theory!  I wonder if people who aren&#39;t &quot;close&quot; to their<br/>
children wanted to unschool, whether they could do it well.  Maybe they<br/>
couldn&#39;t.  (I can&#39;t really relate to a woman who would RATHER wash her<br/>
kitchen floor than be with her kids.  Nor do I admire a husband who<br/>
would push those priorities onto her.)<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be interesting to study this question by putting<br/>
location detectors on parents and kids and tracking the distance between<br/>
them throughout the day and night.  Then the statistics could be<br/>
adjusted for age of kids and size of house.<br/>
<br/>
I postulate that people who are closer to their kids would be &quot;better<br/>
unschoolers&quot; but I have no idea how to measure that outcome.<br/>

Cynicism? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

You are luckily so far missing people coming back and complaining that they <br/>
tried this thing and it didn&#39;t work, and then explaining how they &quot;tried&quot; it <br/>
(making clear that they were cluefree on arrival and departure).  And you&#39;ve <br/>
missed the secondhand reports of people who say &quot;My neighbor says she&#39;s <br/>
unschooling, but she&#39;s doing this&#39;n&#39;that...&quot;  And when they&#39;re right, and <br/>
it&#39;s bad, it&#39;s bad!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;ll keep on missing that stuff forever.  Good, if so.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And if they lack intrapersonal intelligence to assess what went wrong, are<br/>
they likely to accept the results of some test that says they can&#39;t<br/>
unschool? It seems to me self revealing tests are meaningless to those<br/>
without intrapersonal intelligence. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what &quot;test&quot; you&#39;re talking about.  I&#39;m talking about the normal, <br/>
real test of real life--whether they can unschool when they think they&#39;re <br/>
trying to do it.<br/>
<br/>
A test like bicycles test riders.  You&#39;re either up or you&#39;re on the pavement.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The only<br/>
way to grasp how the seemingly opposite aspects can both be true is to read<br/>
bits and pieces of people&#39;s unschooling lives.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But some people seem to read and read a long time, and then look at their own <br/>
children without being able to apply what they&#39;ve read.  They still want to <br/>
direct their children&#39;s play, or leave them alone and hope for them to <br/>
discover some unstrewn environment as an unschooling paradise.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I meant as in hitting the right notes. Unschooling doesn&#39;t have right <br/>
notes.-=-<br/>

<br/>
-=-You can&#39;t buy a specific something (the right notes/product) to get a<br/>

<br/>
Music has theory too!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
No, we can&#39;t say &quot;THIS is the one single tune,&quot; but we can say the tune goes <br/>
kind of like this...<br/>
and we can &quot;play it&quot; for others to see, and they can play along (heavy on the <br/>
&quot;play&quot;) until they can play it themselves.  IF they can play by ear.<br/>

<br/>
The nearest musical term for the style of Alice&#39;s Restaurant is &quot;talking <br/>
blues,&quot; where there&#39;s recitation and then a chorus, more recitation, same <br/>
chorus, with music in the back.   But since the chorus is folky and not <br/>
bluesy, then it must be talking folk-blues. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

The hardest part is letting go of the illusion of control. <br/>

Still working on it myself, the habits of a lifetime aren&#39;t easy to let go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-622421824">We are not official &quot;unschoolers&quot; as of yet. With our oldest child (11, dd) <br/>
we have her study for things that will be on a placement test when she goes <br/>

are giving her this opportunity.<br/>
  However, our youngest definately wants to continue homelearning, and our <br/>
second child (we have three), has not completely made up his mind yet, if it <br/>
is homelearning or ps. The child(ren) that stays home will be &quot;unschooled&quot;. <br/>
The more I read about this, the more interested I am in it. Is it difficult <br/>
to &quot;unschool&quot; in a state that requires records? how would I go about keeping <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784642730">Exactly! I remember more things that I have learned on my own, than <br/>
everything I was &quot;taught&quot; in ps. There were more times the teachers were only <br/>
worried about getting you ready for tests, that they didn&#39;t teach you a <br/>
thing. ONly wanted to make sure &quot;their&quot; classes made the grade. <br/>
One thing that still urks me (badly) is the fact that many school districts <br/>
do not require the teachers to take the same exams they expect their students <br/>
to take. Sad, I think. If you refuse to take the test, then you shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
allowed to teach at all.<br/>

I go through the workbooks to see if there are any new pages done <br/>
that I can photocopy.  We also have to keep a record of reading <br/>
material used, which is easy.  I just keep a notebook and jot down <br/>
the title of the book she&#39;s reading.  We also have to be evaluated at <br/>
the end of the year, but I have an unschooling-friendly evaluator.  <br/>
