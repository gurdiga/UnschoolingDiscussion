If there&#39;s anyone from New Jersey here or who knows their laws, could you <br/>
please go here and encourage this mom?  Her post is just so vibrant and I don&#39;t <br/>
have a NJ clue.  She wrote this, but didn&#39;t leave an address.  I&#39;ll send her <br/>
the link to how to find locals, too, but something about this just yoinked my <br/>
heartstrings, y&#39;know?:<br/>

This all sounds too good to be true. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, however, I <br/>
take my 12 yr old daughter to museums, lots of cultural trips (I grew up in <br/>
New York and didn&#39;t take advantage of these opportunities - didn&#39;t know they <br/>
existed until I moved to New Jersey 20 years ago!) <br/>
<br/>
Lindsay has been exposed to a critical environment since the 1st grade. She <br/>
became unrecognizable in the 7th grade (currently) I am going to begin <br/>
unschooling for 8th grade. Wish I could begin now! <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone begun homeschooling in the midst of a school year? <br/>
