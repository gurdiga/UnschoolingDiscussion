You have all inspired me though to get back to writing in a journal, and<br/>
keeping one by my bed to write things I am thinking while I&#39;m lying there<br/>
listening to everyone (including the dog) snore.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758704303">I wanted to get some for Satori the last trip to the<br/>
library cuz he said he wanted a detective book, and it<br/>
showed up on the computer catalog thingy but they were<br/>
nowhere to be found. :( I&#39;m not giving up though. I<br/>
sold all mine a while back. My favorite was &quot;The Happy<br/>

detective when I was younger...still have a bit in me,<br/>

secret spy clubs (even made up membership cards), and<br/>
codes and codecracking and spy tools you could make<br/>
from kleenex boxes, etc...I think I may just be so<br/>

I found out last year that an old schoolfriend had <br/>
decidied to join the &#39;Foreign Office&#39; (there&#39;s nothing <br/>
so obvious as the CIA here, at least they don&#39;t recruit <br/>
directly...) having been inspired by the spy bits of <br/>
the David Eddings Belgarion series (pl)  Last known <br/>
location was China...<br/>
