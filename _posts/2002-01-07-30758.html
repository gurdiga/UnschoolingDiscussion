&gt; I remember taking a field trip several years ago to the local tv station. <br/>
&gt; We<br/>
&gt; gathered in the lobby to wait for everybody to get there and naturally,<br/>
&gt; there was a big-screen tv for all to view. The kids who had limited tv were<br/>
&gt; GLUED to the tube and were like zombies when somebody spoke to them. The<br/>
&gt; kids who were *not* limited with tv were more interested in the <br/>
&gt; surroundings<br/>
&gt; and how things work, etc. It was interesting to watch because there was not<br/>
&gt; just two families involved (one tv and one not) but an entire group of<br/>
&gt; unschoolers! I reinforced my belief to not limit tv.<br/>

Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am happy to be &#39;tuning in&#39; amongst all you fellow unschoolers.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
on other lists that weren&#39;t even a quarter as active as this one.  I want you <br/>
know that over the last few days reading all your posts - I sense a certain <br/>
&#39;freedom&#39; here and I like it.  <br/>
<br/>
I take a snip of Sarah&#39;s post because I could relate to her experience.  When <br/>
my kids were more restricted to tv, they wanted it all the more.  It drove me <br/>
nuts!  Now, (mostly, except for my six yos) it&#39;s no big deal...  A little <br/>
reverse psychology in action.  It&#39;s working.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, our family lives in MA, USA.  We have six children ages 12, 9, 6, 4, <br/>
2.5, and 6 mos.  We have always home schooled.  Our modes and methods have <br/>
changed over the years but our overall mission remains the same.  That is, to <br/>
be out of the systems and to be &#39;free&#39; as God should lead us.  It&#39;s been <br/>
quite a trip!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
