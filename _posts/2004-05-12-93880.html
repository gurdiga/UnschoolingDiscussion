Ren, I couldn&#39;t agree with you more.  And to flip this another way, anyone studying buddhist principles should live with an unschooling familiy to see what living in the moment, mindfully and respectfully is really all about. ; - )  And how it can translate into parenting.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad people mentioned this.  I knew when I started unschooling I <br/>
was going to have to do a lot of switching over to a <br/>
meditation/yoga/writing mode, where I just stop and see things as <br/>
they are.  Sometimes I need a little actual meditation in the middle <br/>
of the day to help me, and sometimes I can just take in how my son&#39;s <br/>
smile leaves his eyes still wide, or how his hair smells, or what <br/>
the eggs that I&#39;m cooking for him at 10 at night look like in the <br/>
pan, all crinkly around the edges . . .<br/>
<br/>
Living mindfully would be &quot;strewing&quot; with things that open up your <br/>
world or you think would open up your children&#39;s, but not with <br/>
calculation about the educational value of this experience.  A rock <br/>
that honestly caught your eye, not a &quot;potential geology lesson.&quot;  <br/>
Using Buddhist values to plan a field trip would be enjoying the <br/>
process of packing snacks, mapping your route, and driving there as <br/>
much as you hope to enjoy the field trip, and would also be leaving <br/>
a lot of openness to the &quot;plan&quot; for detours and unexpected <br/>
happenings.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Man, I need Buddhism for Dummies, then! <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;ll look for moments like that. I think I&#39;ll have to go back <br/>
to what I used to do and get ready for outings the night before, <br/>
after the kids go to sleep. Much more likely to be enjoyable then <br/>
than when the kids and I are in a hurry to get moving.<br/>
