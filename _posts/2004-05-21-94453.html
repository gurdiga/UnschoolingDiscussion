<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933655135">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
  I have read most of the articles about video game/tv use, and understand<br/>
that controlling your child with your own values will not enrich their<br/>
lives, along with the fact that many of you believe their are many benefits<br/>
in the process of playing video games/tv.  My 6yo son has been loving the<br/>
true switch to unschooling - he&#39;s playing video games at every opportunity<br/>
(it&#39;s been about 2 weeks), and is so excited, frustrated, angry, overjoyed,<br/>
proud - you name it, the emotions are running high.  However, my concern is<br/>
this (eveyone&#39;s comments on the Life Learning article has helped me to<br/>
cristilize my concerns):  With 3 children in my house, the 2 oldest often<br/>
want to do opposite things, with my 6 yo son often wanting to do<br/>
media-related activities, and my 8yo daughter wants to do gardening, crafts,<br/>
scrapbooking.  The 2 yo follows me, and annoys his siblings by &quot;getting<br/>
into&quot; what they&#39;re doing.  In the end, the unschooling is looking more like<br/>
the 6yo is spending time ALONE doing the video games more often than not,<br/>
and this is for a few reasons.  Whenever I become occupied, making<br/>
breakfast, changing a diaper, answering the phone, helping his sister - he<br/>
sees this as an opportunity to play VG&#39;s.  Or, sometimes just waking up in<br/>
the morning is enough reason to play VG&#39;s, and often it is not possible for<br/>
me to be with him.  I also really, really, enjoy doing the activities my<br/>
daughter enjoys, and we invite him along, but he often declines.  (not<br/>
always - it depends on the day and the VG he&#39;s playing).  Or, the 2yo gets<br/>
in the way while he&#39;s playing, so the 6yo asks me to take the 2yo upstairs.<br/>
I just am noticing that I am spending less time with my 6yo son since we&#39;ve<br/>
started unlimited VG use, and I&#39;m a bit saddened by it.  I do join him at<br/>
some point each day, and play the VG a bit (I really suck!), and I&#39;ve made a<br/>
point to watch movies with him, which has been REALLY lovely and he really<br/>
appreciates, but I can&#39;t seem to get around the fact that he often plays<br/>
VG&#39;s alone, without me there.  Another point to mention, I guess, is that my<br/>
husband LOVES VG&#39;s as well, and will often join my 6yo son in the evenings<br/>
and play with him.  My 6yo will also run across the house and share exciting<br/>
moments, if I&#39;m not in the basement with him, so I get included in that way.<br/>
I&#39;m worried that the &quot;researched&quot; detriments to media use may apply in this<br/>
situation, and I&#39;d love to hear anyone&#39;s comments on this.  Is this kind of<br/>
media use, where I&#39;m not able to be there right with him for most, or even<br/>
half of the time, truly unschooling?  And if it isn&#39;t, how have other<br/>
families balanced the different needs/wants of all their children to share<br/>
in their lives as much as possible?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re asking two separate questions but lumping them together.<br/>
You&#39;re asking if the situation you have is okay and you&#39;re asking if video<br/>
games are okay.<br/>
<br/>
What if the situation were reversed and you loved playing video games but<br/>
your daughter enjoyed gardening. And she was in the garden as soon as you<br/>
were on the phone or as soon as she was up in the morning or any opportunity<br/>
she could grab to be outside.<br/>
<br/>
The disconnection between your son and the family isn&#39;t because of the video<br/>
games. It&#39;s because he&#39;s choosing to do something that resides in a place<br/>
that&#39;s away from the family. Anything could draw one member of the family<br/>
away. You maintain the connections the same way you&#39;d maintain the<br/>
connections with any activity. By being with them when you can. Talking<br/>
about their interests. Bringing them snacks.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage to video games over gardening is that you could move the games<br/>
and TV so he&#39;s in an area where the family is more likely to be. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Is *he* feeling disconnected? You can ask him if he&#39;s feeling separated and<br/>
if he&#39;d like to be able to play where you are more.<br/>

Well, two weeks is not a long time to adjust to any change.  Maybe he&#39;s<br/>
enjoying the chance to play whenever he can since that is new to him.  Maybe<br/>
after a while when he realizes that the choice to play will always be open<br/>
to him he may start to choose other activities as well.  Or maybe not! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Whenever I become occupied, making breakfast, changing a diaper,<br/>
answering the phone, helping his sister - he sees this as an opportunity to<br/>
play VG&#39;s. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like he&#39;s finding lots of opportunities to do something he really<br/>
enjoys!  And it sounds like he may not be sure you&#39;ll always let him play<br/>
whenever he wants, if he&#39;s often waiting until you&#39;re occupied to start<br/>
playing.  Give yourselves some time to adjust to this new level of freedom.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I also really, really, enjoy doing the activities my daughter enjoys, and<br/>
we invite him along, but he often declines.  (not always - it depends on the<br/>
day and the VG he&#39;s playing). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That sounds like he&#39;s making good decisions for himself ... considering the<br/>
activity you have offered and then deciding what is right for him at that<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I just am noticing that I am spending less time with my 6yo son since<br/>
we&#39;ve started unlimited VG use, and I&#39;m a bit saddened by it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On issues like these I like to follow my gut feeling.  If you feel in your<br/>
heart that you are not spending enough time with him, try to address that.<br/>
You said you are offering the other activities to him and he is choosing<br/>
video games.  So work with that; enjoy and support his choices.  There are<br/>
lots of ways you can get involved with your son during the day.  We are<br/>
often moving the game consoles around the house depending on the game being<br/>
played, the other activities going on in the house etc.  Can you and your<br/>
daughter do your activities in the same room as he&#39;s playing?  When he gets<br/>
stuck or frustrated in a game you can search for help/hints online<br/>
(gamefaqs.com is great for that).  You can chat with him when he comes to<br/>
share exciting moments (as you mentioned).  You can drop by and ask<br/>
questions about his progress.  You can keep the 2yo occupied when he&#39;s<br/>
getting in the way (btdt). ;-)  You can bring him drinks, snacks or meals<br/>
when he&#39;s particularly busy with a game.  You can find shows and magazines<br/>
related to what he enjoys playing and surprise him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Another point to mention, I guess, is that my husband LOVES VG&#39;s as well,<br/>
and will often join my 6yo son in the evenings and play with him. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s great that your son and dh can enjoy this activity together!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  how have other families balanced the different needs/wants of all their<br/>
children to share in their lives as much as possible? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I listen to the kids.  If they&#39;re playing video games and calling me often<br/>
to come see something, I take the time to hang out for a while because they<br/>
seem to be at an exciting spot.  If I go try to hang out and I&#39;m asked to<br/>
leave (usually by the oldest during complicated play - I guess I&#39;m too<br/>
distracting &lt;g&gt;), then I leave.  If I want to do something with them I try<br/>
to suggest something interesting enough for them to join me.  Whether it&#39;s<br/>
crafts, gardening, watching movies or playing video games, it&#39;s just the<br/>
give and take of living together.<br/>
<br/>
My 12 yo son often plays video games &quot;alone&quot; but he knows I&#39;m around.  Last<br/>
night he was particularly upset about something that happened playing online<br/>
and he came upstairs to find and tell me.  We ended up talking for a couple<br/>
hours, first upstairs then back downstairs while he vented about what went<br/>
wrong, ran through is options, came up with a plan, and a backup plan and<br/>
then we came back up to watch X-Play.  ;-)  It&#39;s pretty rare that we&#39;ll chat<br/>
for that long but he knows I&#39;m around when he needs me.  I do check in with<br/>
him regularly throughout the day (bringing food, chatting etc.) and he comes<br/>
to find me when he has a question or something to share.  As I said, I go<br/>
with my gut feel about how much time I am / am not spending with each of my<br/>
3 kids and try to adjust accordingly.<br/>

<br/>
Two weeks in is WAY too early to say &quot;in the end...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not NEARLY the end.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has played video games since he was five.  He&#39;s nearly 18.  He will go <br/>
days without playing.  But Thursday night, he and Marty signed on to a new <br/>
online game, and he played seven hours straight yesterday.  Then he went to work <br/>
and Marty got on for the rest of the day and evening.   <br/>
<br/>
I could say &quot;In the end, they will play new and exciting games a lot, and <br/>
will go days without playing anything,&quot;  but is this &quot;in the end&quot;?  The people <br/>
who talked Kirby into getting in on that game are two older friends.  One is <br/>
just back from college for the summer, and the other is 22 or so, fully employed, <br/>
lives in an apartment.    Neither of them were homeschooled. <br/>
<br/>
In the end, people are different, but in the end, it&#39;s better for everyone <br/>
involved if people are living peaceful lives of choices instead of being managed <br/>
or micromanaged by parents.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Whenever I become occupied, making<br/>
<br/>
breakfast, changing a diaper, answering the phone, helping his sister - he<br/>
<br/>
sees this as an opportunity to play VG&#39;s.  Or, sometimes just waking up in<br/>
<br/>
the morning is enough reason to play VG&#39;s, and often it is not possible for<br/>
<br/>
me to be with him. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re making it about you.  The game is exciting and alluring to him.  He&#39;s <br/>
not plaing because you&#39;re changing a diaper.  Let him play!<br/>
<br/>
-=-I also really, really, enjoy doing the activities my<br/>
<br/>
daughter enjoys, and we invite him along, but he often declines.  (not<br/>
<br/>
always - it depends on the day and the VG he&#39;s playing). -=-<br/>
<br/>
Once he really believes that you will let him play the minute he gets home, <br/>
if he wants to, he&#39;ll be MUCH more willing to walk away from the game to do <br/>
something else.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m worried that the &quot;researched&quot; detriments to media use may apply in this<br/>
<br/>
situation, and I&#39;d love to hear anyone&#39;s comments on this. -=-<br/>
<br/>
They have to do with schoolkids.  Much of social science and even cognitive <br/>
science these days is in support of school and &quot;school success.&quot;   Without <br/>
school as a factor, very little of it applies.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I can&#39;t seem to get around the fact that he often plays<br/>
<br/>
VG&#39;s alone, without me there.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Try to figure out what emotions you&#39;re having.  Is it guilt? Is it <br/>
frustration that your vision of homeschooling doesn&#39;t match this week&#39;s reality?  Is it <br/>
jealousy?  Wistfulness that he&#39;s growing up?  I&#39;ve had all those feelings <br/>
about my kids.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is this kind of<br/>
<br/>
media use, where I&#39;m not able to be there right with him for most, or even<br/>
<br/>
half of the time, truly unschooling? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think of it as &quot;media use.&quot;  Don&#39;t look at the world as though your <br/>
child is on the far side and all this &quot;media&quot; is being &quot;used&quot; between you and him.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about you providing him an environment in which he can learn <br/>
his own way.  So look at it from the viewpoint of you standing right behind <br/>
him, enabling him to do what&#39;s fascinating to him right now.   <br/>
<br/>
Does he like Lego?  If he got a $90 Lego set and played with it for two days, <br/>
would you say &quot;Is this kind of Lego use, where I&#39;m not able to be there right <br/>
with him for most, or even half of the time, truly unschooling?&quot;  If he gets <br/>
into fantasy fiction in a few years and is reading some Cherryh or Card series <br/>
and wants to be by himself in a corner, reading, and you just take him lunch <br/>
and he keeps reading, would you even wonder to yourself, &quot;Is this kind of book <br/>
use, where I&#39;m not able to be there right with him for most, or even half of <br/>
the time, truly unschooling?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
-=And if it isn&#39;t, how have other<br/>
<br/>
families balanced the different needs/wants of all their children to share<br/>
<br/>
in their lives as much as possible?-=-<br/>
<br/>
With two younger children, it seems you might just want to see the bright <br/>
side of his being obsessed with something in a safe place, while you can spend <br/>
more time with the others.  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like things are going great at your house!<br/>

<br/>
I agree. We&#39;ve been unschooling for 18 months and my eldest son Jesse (10)<br/>
has only just reached the place where he is interested  in turning off the<br/>
TV and joining us in a game or some art or cooking....<br/>
<br/>
I had to put aside many expectations of how I thought unschooling would look<br/>
and how it would make me feel, which was hard but it did make me focus way<br/>
more on building up a close relationship with each child and looking for the<br/>
good that was happening every day in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Now I can see that what we have is so much better than that which I<br/>
envisioned and I feel great about it. It just takes time and patience and<br/>
lots of &#39;biting of the tongue&#39; &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
 And don&#39;t forget to breathe &lt;g&gt;.  Sandra, that has to be the best  advice<br/>
ever!<br/>
