<div id="ygrps-yiv-30150144">I was in Target the other morning shopping. There was a lady shopping with her I would guess about 3-4 year old.<br/>
<br/>
I passed her three different times while shopping and this is what I overheard....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re doing so GREAT!!!!!. Let&#39;s keep going&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Fabulous choice. You picked out a really great card!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Now we have to go buy detergent, so that we can wash our clothes. That way if you get paint or glue on them at preschool we can get them clean. Hop on the back of the cart and let&#39;s go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now the little boy never said anything, during the entire time I saw them. Maybe he just can&#39;t yet talk. He had a glazed over look on his face. Yes..only my observation I know....<br/>
<br/>
I know that she was following the advice of some experts like &quot;super nanny&quot; to engage him in the process, to keep him from melting down or such. But the whole conversation was very unnatural. She seemed to speak extra loud (although I don&#39;t believe the child was hard of hearing), perhaps for the benefit of other&#39;s to hear, or maybe just because she was trying to keep his attention. I remember John Holt once mentioning in a book, about commenting on what you&#39;re doing &quot;now we&#39;ll put on the coat and zip it up&quot; etc., but he also mentioned that it had to be natural.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering what you think about this type of  activity. Forced teaching/conversation. Obviously it&#39;s wonderful to include and engage our children in the activities we are doing. But is forced or almost scripted conversation good with younger children, or is better to just answer questions, be genuine, share your own thoughts etc. I tend to do the latter. Just sort of curious.<br/>

know more of what was going on in between those snippets and in <br/>
general. Obviously, the high, &#39;poodle voice&#39; (as Sandra calls it, <br/>
fits well) is out but often with my DS at that age a running stream <br/>
of chat was how we made it through a shopping trip - it provided a <br/>
bridge for him from one thing to the next because transitions are <br/>
tough for him in general. Over the top &quot;Fabulous!&quot; was not one of my <br/>
choices but things like &quot;Oh that looks like a great choice - I bet <br/>
&lt;grandma, grandpa, cousin T...&gt; will love it&quot; I probably would leave <br/>
out the discussion of -why- we need detergent unless he asked <br/>
(because he helped out with laundry anyhow by then and knew what <br/>
detergent was) but I&#39;d often say &#39;Okay now we need laundry <br/>
detergent, hop on and let&#39;s go find it&#39; or something similar. Also, <br/>
I&#39;d make sure to leave space in the commentary for his input - some <br/>
talk, some quiet space so he could just be or ask something or <br/>
comment or whatever.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe it was  natural for that family.  When my children were very young, I <br/>
often got  &quot;looks&quot; and occasionally someone felt the need to tell me that my <br/>
child didn&#39;t  have a &quot;clue&quot; what I was talking about so why was I doing it?  <br/>
 <br/>
The one time that clearly sticks out in memory was my oldest was maybe 2,  <br/>
sitting in her stroller and we were clothes shopping for her.  I knew it  <br/>
couldn&#39;t be much fun and I was trying to engage her in conversation to make it a  <br/>
bit more pleasant.  I would hold up outfits and ask her which she liked  better; <br/>
 this one or this one?  I clearly thought she was responding  and making <br/>
choices but a &quot;better&quot; mother took the time to inform me that I was  just being <br/>
ridiculous that she had no idea what I was talking about and I was  wasting my <br/>
time.<br/>
 <br/>
Uh, OK, but short snippets of people&#39;s lives are rarely enough to make  <br/>
profound judgments, especially when it&#39;s not something that &quot;appears&quot; at to be  <br/>
harmful.<br/>
 <br/>
What is normal anyway?  What&#39;s a &quot;normal&quot; voice for one Mom might seem  very <br/>
animated to another Mom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880764261">I clearly  said it was&quot; only my observation I know...&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I can see where my poor wording choice saying SHE was following some experts opinions meant I assumed she was. But that honestly was not what my words meant. I mean that I know some experts agree with this type of conversation and whether it was her own idea to do it or the experts was really not what I was getting at.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t thinking negative things towards her really. Actually at the time I did say to myself, hey she seems like a  concerned mom who was trying to engage her child. <br/>
<br/>
But from the tone of voice, it seemed UNnatural. Doesn&#39;t mean it was wrong or that it was right. It JUST seemed unnatural to me which then made me  pause to think on it and wonder if it was truly unnatural then is that kind of forced discussion a good thing for our young children.<br/>
<br/>
Situations make us think lots of things, and it was just something I thought about as I left and later at home and wanted to see what others thought.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean anything negative. I looked at as something to discuss. Whether that type of one sided conversation if it is unnatural is a good thing.<br/>

Some people just don&#39;t have the interpersonal skills God gave a  <br/>
donut, and that&#39;s a sad thing.<br/>
<br/>
Some people have the potential to do better, but they grew up without  <br/>
good models and experiences and they&#39;re making it up on the fly.<br/>
<br/>
Some do better at that than others.<br/>
<br/>
Some people just don&#39;t have much facility with being natural, meaning  <br/>
in this instance (my meaning, I mean) calm and sincere and  <br/>
conversational.<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s mom writes the most stilted letters in the world.  No human  <br/>
talks that way.  She doesn&#39;t talk that way.  But she writes that  <br/>
way.    Some people kinda speak in an unnatural way too...  I think I  <br/>
know what you might mean by unnatural.  Like a script, without regard  <br/>
to the other person&#39;s responses.<br/>
<br/>
If it was one sided it wasn&#39;t much of a discussion at all.<br/>

I&#39;m just wondering what you think about this type of  activity. Forced <br/>
teaching/conversation. Obviously it&#39;s wonderful to include and engage our <br/>
children in the activities we are doing. But is forced or almost scripted <br/>

curious.<br/>
-=-=-=-=--<br/>
 <br/>
Depends. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I call it thinking out loud (and more often math-out-loud).<br/>
 <br/>
I do it a LOT when figuring math---out loud rather than in my head---that way my kids can see that I have to *think* about it---that it doesn&#39;t just *appear*, but that i work to get to that answer. I do it at the beach: &quot;Why are the sea gulls in Boston darker than the sea gulls in SC?&quot; &quot;I wonder why they chose to use red paper here rather than blue---the blue would have shown off the ____ better.&quot; &quot;If I run by the bank first, I can have plenty for lunch AND that frame...&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Ben teases me about how MUCH I talk out loud! &lt;G&gt; I have running conversations with myself all day. It&#39;s how I think through things and make sure things get done. I&#39;m sure many of you saw me doing that at the conference! &lt;bwg&gt; I just chat away at myself!<br/>
 <br/>
But I specifically do it when I&#39;m with my (when-they-were-younger) boys (they&#39;re not so keen on it any more---they&#39;d rather I think to myself more! &lt;g&gt;). But it helped them to *see* what I was thinking or how I came up with the reasons why/where/how to do something.<br/>
 <br/>
Too often I think adults DON&#39;T talk to children about what they&#39;re doing or thinking. The children have no idea where those thoughts came from---what process was used to get to the end. They don&#39;t see us struggle with day-to-day thoughts and ideas. *I* think we need to talk more.<br/>

I have no idea if the mom in the store sounded unnatural or not, but I<br/>
always talked to my kids when they were little about what I was doing and it<br/>
seemed very natural to me.  (I think my mom did the same thing)  Both my<br/>
kids talked very young and understood speech very young and I attribute a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-346977983">This reminds me of the story of the young mother pushing her fussy child <br/>
in a shopping cart through a crowded grocery store.  She kept up a <br/>
running monolog (Ha!  I accidentally typed &quot;momolog&quot; -- that works, <br/>
too!) while she flung in the groceries -- &quot;Just one more aisle, Jennifer <br/>
... I just have to get the meat while it&#39;s still on sale...   there&#39;s <br/>
the milk ... we just have to get through the line.  It&#39;ll only be a few <br/>
more minutes, Jennifer.  You&#39;re doing great&quot; kind of thing.  An older <br/>
gentleman observed this, and complimented her parenting; her calming <br/>
tone; the care she was taking to try and distract the impatient <br/>
toddler.   Then he turned to the little girl. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;See, Jennifer?  That wasn&#39;t so bad, was it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The young mom sheepishly corrected him.  &quot;Ummmm.... *I*&#39;m Jennifer...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, it was a lot funnier before I knew about respectful parenting, and <br/>
NOT dragging your little ones through the store....<br/>

  I&#39;ve always talked to mine in the thinking out loud mode.  It&#39;s something my Mom and sister did/do, too.

He was convinced that conversation with adults is how kids learned.  It&#39;s just always been the way we in our family talk to kids. Lots of running commentary.  Like Kelly, I do it to help my kids see my thought process and what&#39;s involved.  <br/>

I&#39;m just wondering what you think about this type of  activity. Forced <br/>
teaching/conversation. Obviously it&#39;s wonderful to include and engage our <br/>
children in the activities we are doing. But is forced or almost scripted <br/>
conversation good with younger children, or is better to just answer<br/>
questions, <br/>
be genuine, share your own thoughts etc. I tend to do the latter. Just sort<br/>
of <br/>
curious.<br/>
-=-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
Depends. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I call it thinking out loud (and more often math-out-loud).<br/>
<br/>
I do it a LOT when figuring math---out loud rather than in my head---that<br/>
way my kids can see that I have to *think* about it---that it doesn&#39;t just<br/>
*appear*, but that i work to get to that answer. I do it at the beach: &quot;Why<br/>
are the sea gulls in Boston darker than the sea gulls in SC?&quot; &quot;I wonder why<br/>
they chose to use red paper here rather than blue---the blue would have<br/>
shown off the ____ better.&quot; &quot;If I run by the bank first, I can have plenty<br/>
for lunch AND that frame...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ben teases me about how MUCH I talk out loud! &lt;G&gt; I have running<br/>
conversations with myself all day. It&#39;s how I think through things and make<br/>
sure things get done. I&#39;m sure many of you saw me doing that at the<br/>
conference! &lt;bwg&gt; I just chat away at myself!<br/>
<br/>
But I specifically do it when I&#39;m with my (when-they-were-younger) boys<br/>
(they&#39;re not so keen on it any more---they&#39;d rather I think to myself more!<br/>
&lt;g&gt;). But it helped them to *see* what I was thinking or how I came up with<br/>
the reasons why/where/how to do something.<br/>
<br/>
Too often I think adults DON&#39;T talk to children about what they&#39;re doing or<br/>
thinking. The children have no idea where those thoughts came from---what<br/>
process was used to get to the end. They don&#39;t see us struggle with<br/>
day-to-day thoughts and ideas. *I* think we need to talk more.<br/>
<br/>
Chatty, chatty me,<br/>

And also hearing people talk to themselves reminds me I&#39;m not so strange when I talk to myself :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oddly enough, thinking out loud/talking to DS has even gotten this <br/>
introverted mommy to start talking to total strangers in the grocery <br/>
store! (typically when he&#39;s not there to listen) Just the other day <br/>
I mentioned to a person nearby in the baking goods aisle that the <br/>
cinnamon chips are tasty on oatmeal. And the trip before last, I had <br/>
two people ask me questions as I was meandering and mumbling and <br/>
helped them find what they were looking for. I think maybe it&#39;s <br/>
because having DS around I tend to be more outward focused (focusing <br/>
more on him than on my inside world) and moving a bit more slowly <br/>
and that&#39;s become habit. Pre-DS I used to turbo shop - speed through <br/>
without pausing to look around and make sure not to go on the day <br/>
that the senior citizens bus was there. Now I relax, maybe say a <br/>
word or two to someone here and there, chat with the cashier and bag <br/>
person, help the mom in the car next to mine get her groceries in <br/>
the trunk ASAP because a storm is coming and she&#39;s got an infant on <br/>
hand, and so on. I used to be way introverted but since DS I&#39;ve <br/>
moderated more to the middle of things - I still need recharging <br/>
time alone but I can be more open more of the time. Interesting - <br/>
thanks for this thread - I hadn&#39;t pondered this for a while.<br/>

The one  time that clearly sticks out in memory was my oldest was maybe 2,   <br/>
sitting in her stroller and we were clothes shopping for her.  I knew  it  <br/>
couldn&#39;t be much fun and I was trying to engage her in  conversation to make <br/>
it a  <br/>
bit more pleasant.  I would hold up  outfits and ask her which she liked  <br/>
better; <br/>
this one or this  one?  I clearly thought she was responding  and making <br/>
choices  but a &quot;better&quot; mother took the time to inform me that I was  just <br/>
being  <br/>
ridiculous that she had no idea what I was talking about and I was   wasting <br/>
my <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Yeah, Will was about that age and he was playing with the train in the  <br/>
bookstore while I sat nearby and looked at books.  A dad was playing with  his <br/>
little one at the train, too.  It was almost time to go and I told  Will, &#39;we have <br/>
two more minutes&quot;, and the guy looked at me and said, &quot;He  has no concept of <br/>
time.  He doesn&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;   I just kind of shrugged <br/>
and laughed.<br/>
 <br/>
When the two minutes were up I said, &quot;Will, it&#39;s time to go&quot; and Will  looked <br/>
up and took my hand and said, &#39;bye bye&quot; to the train.<br/>
 <br/>
The whole reason I warned my kids when it was time to go was so there  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be a scene when they didn&#39;t want to leave.  I hardly ever had to  carry a <br/>
screaming kid away from anything.  <br/>
 <br/>
No, Will probably had no clue how long 2 minutes is.  That guy had no  clue <br/>
what Will knew or not.<br/>
