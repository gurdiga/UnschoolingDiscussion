&lt;&lt; What does everyone else feel about kids and the use of computers?<br/>
 <br/>
 Our son was 2 when we had one computer, we would sit with him when he wanted <br/>
to use it.  It made everyone nuts.  Then we decided to upgraded our computer <br/>
we gave the old one to our son and just put his programs on it.  His ability <br/>
expanded immediately when he was able to work on his own.  He is now 5 and <br/>
amazing at what he can do.  We have a wonderful program that he can write a <br/>
story, record his voice, record sounds and draw pictures.  <br/>
My husband and I use computers so we saw no reason to limit him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-962900470">have you seen Pingu on the tv?  the cute little penguin, oh, maybe not, I seem to remember something about US networks not liking the &#39;toilet humour&#39; anyhow, the BBC have a couple of programs aimed at 3-6yo and while there&#39;s a lot of &#39;well done&#39; and &#39;fantastic&#39; a little over-exuberant for my tastes, it&#39;s a darn sight better than the comments on &#39;lazy-itis&#39; from DK&#39;s Learning Ladder when it&#39;s not ben used for a couple of minutes.  In short, it&#39;s a puzzle, reading and number CD from the BBC with Pingu on it.<br/>

HTH!!<br/>
