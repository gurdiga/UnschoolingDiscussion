&lt;&lt;  Okay, so where can I find a concise (or, heck, wordy!) report or list <br/>
 of the goals of unschooling. Laid out plain and simple, so I can get <br/>
 it! LOL &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I agree with Sandra, that it&#39;s simply my goals as a parent.  With <br/>
unschooling I am not trying to &quot;mold&quot; or &quot;shape&quot; anyone, so their goals are <br/>
what I care about.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s a little essay I wrote sometime back when the question was posed <br/>
&quot;What do you hope your children will have gotten from unschooling when <br/>
they&#39;re grown?&quot;<br/>
Which to me is a different question than what my goals are:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  This was originally a post at unschooling dotcom email list: <br/>
<br/>
What do you hope your kids will have gotten from unschooling by the time <br/>
they&#39;re ready to move on from home? <br/>
<br/>
Ren&#39;s reply: <br/>
My main goal was that their sense of self would be so strongly intact that <br/>
the world could not rob their joy, their uniqueness and thier natural <br/>
curiosity. <br/>
Beyond that..... <br/>
That the status quo will not matter so much to them as what is good and <br/>
right. That they<br/>
would have a deep seeded knowledge in their hearts that they are intelligent, <br/>
capable human beings and can learn anything they wish.  A sense of wonder so <br/>
awesome <br/>
that they will never quit seeing how magical the world truly is.  Have <br/>
idealism <br/>
tempered with realism.  Spirituality that flows natrually and freely from a <br/>
loving heart and <br/>
posses kindness rare.  The ability to follow their dreams and achieve their <br/>
goals, <br/>
whatever those may be. <br/>
<br/>
And how do you plan to help that along? <br/>
<br/>
It humbles me to think about this.  I came out of High School battered <br/>
emotionally, not knowing who I was or what I realy wanted.  And fifteen years <br/>
later, here I am <br/>
spouting off ideals for my children that I couldn&#39;t have dreamed of at the <br/>
time. <br/>
I will help that along by becoming a better person myself. <br/>
By reading , watching , searching and regaining that sense of wonder, which <br/>
my children have helped me with already. <br/>
By delving deep into questions and not pretending I know more than them. <br/>
By being willing to set everything aside, change plans midstream and go off <br/>
in a new direction when necessary. <br/>
By listening carefully and responding appropriately. <br/>
By respecting these amazing beings I&#39;ve been entrusted with and the inner <br/>
knowledge they already possess. <br/>
By dialoguing with them, these matters of the heart and showing love to the <br/>
earth and my fellow human beings. <br/>
By filling my home with books, movies, music, instruments, nature, toys, art <br/>
materials and whatever oddities my children bring home. <br/>
By taking them to the places they want to go and ones they never knew <br/>
existed. <br/>
By fixing them new and exciting foods from other countries and making trips <br/>
to the grocery store an adventure. <br/>
By making every day an adventure, by my attitude, every mundane chore or <br/>
daily activity sacred by how I approach it. <br/>
Healing myself has definitely been the most important step in assisting these <br/>
worthy individuals in their unschooling journey.  I have learned much from <br/>
them <br/>
thank the heavens they came here to teach me. <br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
