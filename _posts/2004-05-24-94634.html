Recently, several homeschoolers have asked why HSLDA.US was closed<br/>
down.  The web site contained a great deal of educational<br/>
information - not available anywhere else - which enabled<br/>
homeschoolers to make an informed choice about whether membership in<br/>
HSLDA (Home School Legal Defense Association) would be a choice for<br/>
their family.<br/>
<br/>
HSLDA sent the registered owner of the domain name a letter ordering<br/>
that the site be shut down because of trademark infringement<br/>
(&quot;HSLDA&quot;) and accusations of Cybersquatting.  Because the owner had<br/>
graciously offered web space for the authors of HSLDA.US and because<br/>
the authors believed it was improper to place that owner in legal<br/>
jeopardy, the site was taken down.   The authors also believe this<br/>
action by HSLDA was an attempt to silence their critics and prohibit<br/>
potential members from being fully informed about HSLDA. HSLDA has<br/>
purchased the domain HSLDA.US.<br/>
<br/>
The authors of the More Information About HSLDA pages maintain that<br/>
the content of HSLDA.US was accurate to the best of our knowledge<br/>
and note that Home School Legal Defense Association did not challenge<br/>
the accuracy of that content.<br/>
<br/>
We do not believe the use of the word-mark HSLDA is a copyright<br/>
infringement for several reasons:  trademark laws indicate there is<br/>
a problem if you are profiting from using someone else&#39;s `word-mark&#39;.<br/>
Obviously, HSLDA.US was using &quot;HSLDA&quot; in a non-commercial, non-<br/>
profit  manner and was not diverting business from HSLDA, but rather serving<br/>
as an educational venue for information about Home School Legal<br/>
Defense Association.  Using a `word-mark&#39; is permissible in an<br/>
educational manner, criticism or as an identifier of the owner of<br/>
the mark, all of which HSLDA.US felt was an appropriate - and legal -<br/>
use.  Indeed, HSLDA gave up the use of the word-mark `HSLDA&#39; with<br/>
regard to printed materials in 1990.<br/>
<br/>
The intent of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act is to<br/>
prevent Cyberpiracy and offer remedies to businesses and individuals<br/>
who&#39;s domain or personal names have been stolen for profit, are<br/>
intentionally confusing to consumers, are used to divert business or<br/>
could harm the goodwill of a trademark in addition to other<br/>
provisions.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t believe we committed any crime under the Anticybersquatting<br/>
Act because HSLDA.US did not divert consumers from Home School Legal<br/>
Defense Association. HSLDA.US had no members and did not sell any<br/>
products.  In fact HSLDA.US provided both a disclaimer that it was<br/>
not Home School Legal Defense Association and a link to HSLDA.org.<br/>
<br/>
Home School Legal Defense Association is responsible for the<br/>
goodwill - or lack of it - they have cultivated within the<br/>
homeschool community.<br/>
<br/>
But perhaps the most important clause in the Anticybersquatting<br/>
Consumer Protection Act is Sec. 3008, the Savings Clause.  It<br/>
clearly states, &quot;Nothing in this title shall affect...a person&#39;s right to<br/>
free speech or expression under the first amendment of the United<br/>
States Constitution&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So the bottom line is we took the site down out of respect for the<br/>
owner of the domain name, not because the information was<br/>
inaccurate, not because using the word mark &quot;HSLDA&quot; is prohibited and not<br/>
because there was any violation of the Cybersquatting Act.  We still believe<br/>
we have a 1st Amendment right to speak freely about HSLDA and will<br/>
continue to do so.  Thanks for all the questions - it was nice to be<br/>
missed &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
oh, and by the way, drop by the new web site:<br/>
