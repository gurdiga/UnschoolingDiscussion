<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758851766">Sorry folks, this will be my last post on this thread.  Spanking is one<br/>
of those issues I feel compelled to respond to and am working on making<br/>
them more concise.  I know this is redundant to many but in consideration<br/>
of the possible benefit to kids I continue to discuss the issue.<br/>
<br/>
These verses are in response to those from the OT on using physical<br/>
discipline.<br/>
<br/>
(John 15:15)  Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth<br/>
<br/>
  not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for <br/>
  all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known <br/>
  unto you. <br/>
<br/>
(GALAT 2:21)  I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness<br/>
come <br/>
  by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. <br/>
   (GALAT 3:1)  O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye<br/>
should <br/>
  not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been <br/>
  evidently set forth, crucified among you? <br/>
   (GALAT 3:2)  This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by<br/>
the <br/>
  works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? <br/>
   (GALAT 3:3)  Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now<br/>
made <br/>
  perfect by the flesh? <br/>
<br/>
(GALAT 3:10)  For as many as are of the works of the law are under the <br/>
  curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth <br/>
  not in all things which are written in the book of the law to <br/>
  do them. <br/>
<br/>
I could quote much more but I believe Jesus made it abundantly clear that<br/>
He intended to establish a new relationship with us.  There is a balance<br/>
in scripture and our &quot;friendship&quot; with God demands that we live by faith.<br/>
 Anyone who knows scripture also knows that there is MUCH from the Old<br/>
Testament which most Christians do not practice and we are cautioned<br/>
about trying to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, all scripture is profitable but we also have direct guidance and<br/>
common sense.  Again, I ask (even plead) if a child can be raised without<br/>
spanking why do it?  Is it really about whether spanking will cause<br/>
damage?  What does spanking gain?  It gains an immediate response, so<br/>
would a LOT of unacceptable methods.  Compliance out of fear is not<br/>
cooperation which should be the goal.  Violence against loved ones, at<br/>
the least, is wrong and that should include children.<br/>
<br/>
Having met MANY wonderful and productive people who were never struck as<br/>
children it is clear, to me, that it&#39;s use is NOT needed to attain this<br/>
end.<br/>
