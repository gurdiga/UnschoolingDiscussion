Have you  considered turning this post into an article for Live Free, Learn<br/>
Free or  Life Learning Mag? It is beautifully expressed and very informative<br/>
too.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
================<br/>
 <br/>
I liked it a lot and put it here:<br/>
 <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/special/videogames_">http://sandradodd.com/special/videogames_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/special/videogames)">http://sandradodd.com/special/videogames)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
(just in case people want to find it later)<br/>
 <br/>
and it it DOES become a magazine article (which would be cool), I could  gush <br/>
mightily and brag it up on that page above and link to the whole finished  <br/>
article.   I can see it now...<br/>
 <br/>
And what I can really happily see is the dozens to hundreds and eventually  <br/>
thousands of kids whose lives will be either just a little or extremely easier  <br/>
and better.  And because of that their siblings&#39; and parents&#39; lives will be  <br/>
better.  <br/>
