digests and I&#39;m COMPLETELY BUMMED (hope that&#39;s not a bad word in the UK,<br/>

say has no doubt already been said OR the discussion has long since moved<br/>
on.<br/>

There, I feel much better for sniveling. I will return you all to your<br/>
CURRENT posts. &lt;g&gt; When I catch up, maybe I&#39;ll be able to play, too!<br/>

but it sure looked that way when it posted), so jump right in!<br/>
