<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977249300">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I have been struggling lately with my five year old&#39;s<br/>
growing independence. She is really wanting to explore<br/>
more of her environment/ the home. I find I am<br/>

So some examples of things I find she does:<br/>

Yesterday she found the food coloring, open it up and<br/>
was mixing it with water. She likes to do a lot of<br/>
water experimenting but I&#39;ll find her doing it in the<br/>
carpeted living room...sigh<br/>

What I see is a kid who is interested in exploring a<br/>

I cannot guarantee that I am sane but my house is<br/>
1. always a mess<br/>
2. always in the process of cleaning the house<br/>
3. always in the process of proceeding with a project.<br/>
My husband and I decided to be okay with the mess. As long as we had clean<br/>
up days and we decicided that the whole family had to clean, Momma is not a<br/>
maid.<br/>
I am at one with the mess.<br/>

Try letting her do her science/art experiments in the bath tub. Preferably<br/>
naked. We&#39;ve had lots of bath tub science, involving peanut butter, food<br/>

I don&#39;t have any btdt with my daughter since she&#39;s 18 months and just<br/>
starting to want to get messy in the house :).<br/>
<br/>
I had a few thoughts, though, about making her exploration a bit &quot;neater.&quot;<br/>
If she loves to experiment with the water and food coloring, how about<br/>
buying one of those huge pieces of plastic that you put underneath a<br/>
highchair to catch all of the food? Then you could get her a big bowl of<br/>
water (maybe even something like a baby bathtub?) and let her go crazy even<br/>
in the carpeted living room.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember if this was in &quot;You Are Your Child&#39;s First Teacher&quot; or if<br/>
somebody once mentioned it to me, but I think it really helps put my child&#39;s<br/>
messes into perspective to look at all of the toys strewn about or whatever<br/>
it may be and see it as them being an equal member of the family. It&#39;s her<br/>
space, too, and if I&#39;m going to have my books and papers all over the house<br/>
then I&#39;m glad she feels comfortable to leave her toys and crayons<br/>
everywhere, too. Of course that doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t teach them about<br/>
picking things up :).<br/>

My kids used to do the same thing! It was a phase they out grew but my <br/>
goodness, the patience it took! My Mother said I and my sisters used to make <br/>
&quot;shooki skaki ( our terminology at the time), and would put anything and <br/>
everything in it. So I guess it is a phase, though how long I am unsure! <br/>
But, one day it will be taking apart the vcr,clock radio or something else <br/>
just to see how and know how it works. There is a book ( dont remember the <br/>
name or author now) that says children like this will be scientists, or <br/>
chemists etc. So I always just pretty much went with the flow until the next <br/>
phase started.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840631243">Hi Samantha<br/>
My eldest is very similar and has handed the trait down to her youngest<br/>
siblings.  :-)  We have a box of stuff which is just for &quot;science<br/>
experiments&quot; which we keep under the kitchen sink.  It has the necesseties<br/>
of food colouring, vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, and then we add other<br/>
stuff, such as out of date food stuffs, cheap food stuffs, pulses,  free<br/>
samples of hair/perfume products that come through the post, yeast and<br/>
sugar, coffee granules, powder paints, things that dissolve and things that<br/>
don&#39;t, all sorts of stuff.  And it is seperate from the stuff we use for<br/>
cooking/baking so when we want to bake, we know to go to the baking cupboard<br/>
and the ingrediatns will be there. And we have a lot of fun as the kids now<br/>
have lab coats and goggles to use! They do this around the sink area but we<br/>
still get stains on the work surface which can be scrubbed clean when I can<br/>
be bothered.  It has been getting more sophisticated lately, checking PH<br/>
levels, actually writing recipes and baking cakes, using a chemistry set to<br/>
determine what colour flames come from different materials.  Of course they<br/>
do the latter with their scientist father, but usually, they can be left at<br/>
the sink concocting stuff. It is great that you are taking her need to<br/>
explore seriously. I hope that some of the suggestions here can help. :-)<br/>
Peace<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496554848">Hello Samantha,<br/>
<br/>
Our house is one big project - drawing and painting in the kitchen, play <br/>
horses in the living room, science experiments in the bathroom and my dh is <br/>
doing some &#39;improvements&#39; to the house!<br/>
<br/>
The best advice is to remember that a tidy house is a form of feminine <br/>
creativity supression and muck right in there with the perpertrators of the <br/>
mess. You&#39;ll find it so much more fun than cleaning!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, here comes the practical stuff. Ask yourself seriously how much you want <br/>
your house to look as if no children live there. You will recognise straight <br/>
away that this is impossible and impractical. Ok, that&#39;s the first step. Then <br/>
decide, with your children and any other interested parties, how you want the <br/>
house to be. Do children want run of the house? Do parents want a sanctuary <br/>
from the mess of living (be warned, if you go for this option, the first time <br/>
you leave it messy, one of your children will notice and keep telling you <br/>
about it!) Once you have decided how you all want your house, change it to <br/>
suit. If money is tight and you&#39;ve all decided you should all be able to <br/>
paint in the carpeted room, stick plastic bags together to make a washable <br/>
rug. If your bedroom is no go, respect that your children may choose the same <br/>
option etc. etc. Be creative in your thoughts and you will find you can all <br/>
be happy. Also IGNORE any comments from friends, family and well meaning <br/>
in-laws!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

Well, since we&#39;re doing true confessions...the only time I&#39;ve ever watched<br/>
she gave me a great idea for my daughter&#39;s 7th b-day party. I bought a<br/>
special cake pan to make mini-doll cakes, the one where the cake is the<br/>
skirt and you put a cake doll in the middle. But with these mini-cakes you<br/>
put a Kelly doll (Barbie&#39;s littlest sister) in the middle. I got a different<br/>
one for each guest, only about $3 each on sale, and put them (starkers) in<br/>
the cakes. Then the girls got to decorate their own cakes. (the craft) Very<br/>
messy, very fun. I took a photo of each girl with her cake and doll, then<br/>
they ate them. (dessert) While they ate, I washed the dolls and put them in<br/>
gift bags with the dolls&#39; clothes. Ta-da! Party favors!<br/>

When we all went up the mountain behind our house to get this year&#39;s <br/>
Christmas tree we spent some time cutting lots of interesting seed <br/>
stalks and weed skeletons, too. Tall golden feathery things, and <br/>
short brown seedy things, and gray-green leafy branches of <br/>
something... and branches of magnificent bright red rose hips and <br/>
lovely stems with white berries in clusters... I&#39;d planned on making <br/>
wreaths with them all, but dd Jody tucked everything into one of my <br/>
tall crocks and stood it beside the tree and I&#39;ve just been delighted <br/>
with the effect and haven&#39;t wanted to make wreaths out of them after <br/>
all. We also found several pine branches with huge pinecones on them <br/>
and she put them in a big glass bowl beside the crock - it all just <br/>
looks so Martha Stewart-ish! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, that comes *after* Christmas, dearie. Following my dear mother&#39;s <br/>
example, I tend to go all out for Christmas, displaying my ages-old <br/>
collections of unique bells and reindeer (some are truly <br/>
magnificent!), my seasonally appropriate needlework wall hangings, my <br/>
four sons&#39; huge collection of nutcracker dolls (the smiling little <br/>
men are gracing various alcoves in the kitchen this year - it&#39;s <br/>
almost scary to go in there!), and of course the lights strung <br/>
everywhere, the garlands, the wreaths, the candles...<br/>
<br/>
Everyone loves it at first, but by about December 28th we&#39;re all <br/>
thinking it&#39;s a little gaudy and ostentatious.... but our youngest <br/>
son&#39;s birthday is Dec. 31, and he always wants the decorations to <br/>
still be up for his birthday. So they stay, usually until about the <br/>
2nd or 3rd, and by that time I&#39;m so tired of all the colors and <br/>
textures and confusion - lovely as it is - that I go on a rampage and <br/>
start packing away, sorting the clutter and tossing out almost <br/>
everything that gets in my way as I go, and by the time I&#39;m done we <br/>
don&#39;t even need to bother with spring cleaning!<br/>
