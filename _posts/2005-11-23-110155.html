 </span></blockquote>As I decided what to do and how with kids, I tried to see the benefits to me, <br/>
too, so that I wasn&#39;t &quot;sacrificing.&quot;    I would think &quot;This will be cool!&quot; <br/>
and &quot;I&#39;ll be learning a lot.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
My life would have been different without children, we would have had more <br/>
money, I would have gone on trips with my many other childless friends, who <br/>
under the circumstances kind of distanced themselves (or in some more recent cases <br/>
I distanced myself because their attitude and comments about children in <br/>
general just grated on me).    But we WANTED to have children.   We found after <br/>
Kirby was born that we LIKED being parents, and so it was something for me and <br/>
Keith, more than for them.   Anyone who pretends to think they did their kids a <br/>
big favor by bringing them to earth is showing a mean, delusional streak.   <br/>
Earth isn&#39;t that great a place, and being alive can be pretty painful and <br/>
irritating.    I haven&#39;t heard it lately by anyone being serious, but when I was <br/>
younger I did hear people saying things like &quot;We gave you life,&quot; and &quot;Your <br/>
mother risked her life to have you&quot; and &quot;You owe us&quot; and &quot;We&#39;ve done you a big <br/>
favor&quot; and other &quot;We are generous and you are insignificant&quot; messages.<br/>
<br/>
Having those in mind has helped me as I&#39;ve tried to keep a better perspective <br/>
than that.   I keep them in a collection in my mind as things not to use.   <br/>
Sometimes when one of my kids has been unhappy from treatment by another friend <br/>
or a sibling, when they were younger, I&#39;ve apologized and said something like <br/>
that I knew there were moments like this in life, and I&#39;m sorry that they&#39;re <br/>
experiencing that just because I wanted to have kids.   And I&#39;d say I hoped <br/>
they didn&#39;t have too many more really bad moments.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;ve had this kind of thing from my mother most of my life. Not as<br/>
overtly as the dad has done, it was much more subtle, but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
make you feel loved it just makes you feel permanently disapproved of.<br/>
Both me and my brother had left home by the age of 18.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The letter made it pretty clear that the mom&#39;s pain was the son&#39;s fault.   <br/>
Something was his fault before he left, and things are his fault now.   He&#39;s a <br/>
faulty guy, one way or another. He has surely screwed up those people&#39;s lives, <br/>
poor parents.   How could he have come to earth against their will and then <br/>
not served them on their terms?   (That was sarcasm.)    The letter didn&#39;t say <br/>
&quot;You were right&quot; about anything, or &quot;If you come back things will be <br/>
different,&quot; or &quot;We&#39;ll be in New York reclaiming our careers, but if you want a plane <br/>
ticket to see us we&#39;ll gladly pay for it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m thinking like an unschooler.   It&#39;s not fair to overlay my attitudes <br/>
toward respecting children and being partners with them.   I have to credit La <br/>
Leche League (again).   All around me parents DO act as though children are <br/>
alien burdens who weren&#39;t expected or wanted and couldn&#39;t possibly be loved and <br/>
appreciated.   All over the place parents are complaining to their friends <br/>
about how awful it is to be a parent, but *THEY MADE IT HARD.*   They sabotaged <br/>
any possible joy and hope, and then they martyr themselves about it.   What <br/>
about the child?   What about his feelings, and joy and hope?<br/>
<br/>
At my house that&#39;s not a problem.   When they&#39;re joyous I am too.   When <br/>
they&#39;re hopeful and creative and energetic, we all get to share that.   When they <br/>
have a hard moment, others are not going to say &quot;That&#39;s what you get,&quot; we&#39;re <br/>
going to comfort and sympathize, and when the time is right, we&#39;ll help them <br/>
recover and repair.<br/>
<br/>
The other night my kids had &quot;a fight&quot; (in Marty&#39;s words) after the parents <br/>
were asleep.   I wrote about it elsewhere, but have the followup now.   I&#39;ll <br/>
post it separately.<br/>
