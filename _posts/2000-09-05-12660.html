<br/>
here ya go (Pris handing Melodie a nice COOOOOOLD glass of lemonade) ~&gt;<br/>
would you like a yummy  maraschino cherry in your lemonade, too???  lol ...<br/>
yes, we&#39;re in the burbs of SA where we&#39;ve OFFICIALLY reached an ALL TIME<br/>
HIGH of 109* in SA ... the 5pm news said this was the HIGHEST OF ALL HIGHS<br/>
EVER RECORDED since they&#39;ve kept records in the late 1890&#39;s!!!  wellllllll,<br/>
my weatherbug said it was 111*, who cares, this heat is just RUTHLESS ...<br/>
all my ferns are DYING b/c we&#39;re rationing water and the poor grass crunches<br/>
when you walk on it ...<br/>
<br/>
ohhhhhh yes, I know exactly where you are (Llano/Fred)!!!   ohhhhhh, the TX<br/>
hill country is one of our *fav* places to go camping in the fall/spring &lt;G&gt;<br/>
... we&#39;re HOPING to get the *camping itch* in a few wks when the weather<br/>
cools off a bit but NOT RIGHT NOW :P<br/>
<br/>
Pris ~&gt; waving to her hill country neighbors :)<br/>
WARNING: I cannot be help responsible for the above, as apparently my cats<br/>
have learned how to type ...<br/>

&gt; Pass the Lemonade!  My weatherbug says its down to 105. But considering<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; it is after 6:30, I&#39;m underwhelmed with the decrease from a high of 108<br/>
&gt; earlier in the day!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Did you say you are in the burbs near San Antonio?  I am in the sticks<br/>
&gt; approximately 100 miles from both SA and Austin.  Actually we are 21 miles<br/>
&gt; to Llano and 21 miles to Fredericksburg.  As soon as we can find good jobs<br/>
&gt; and get our place (21 acres, house, antique log cabin, and several<br/>
&gt; outbuildings) on the market, we are heading for the Pacific Northwest.<br/>
&gt; Their highs in the daytime are lower than our lows at night.<br/>
