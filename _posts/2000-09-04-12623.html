&gt; Another thing that I thought was totally defeatest was that they are PAID<br/>
&gt; to get right answers, MONEY!  I mean, I always thought (and that&#39;s how we<br/>
&gt; work it) that education should be from the love of learning.  Geez, just<br/>
&gt; one more way to make good little greedy capitalists &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or the one that I saw on tv not too long ago (I think it was this same<br/>
&gt; group) that taught adding and subtracting with M & M&#39;s, Good & Plenties<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; other candies and they only got to eat them if they got the answer right.<br/>
&gt; I mean, I would just love to see how this teacher explained to a child<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; was hypoglycemic or had diabetes that they couldn&#39;t participate in math.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d also like to see just how many walls these kids bounced off of.  Wanna<br/>
&gt; bet she complained of discipline problems, like DUH!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; not only that Nance but TX teachers *TEACH* the TAAS test<br/>
&gt; &gt; ALLLLLLLLlllllllllllll YEARRRRRRRRRRRRR LONGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG ... and ...<br/>
&gt; &gt; after the tests are completed in the spring, they have parties in their<br/>
&gt; &gt; classrooms to CELEBRATE; give me a *break*!!!   another pathetic thing<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; happens is *some* teachers have been caught HELPING their students by<br/>
&gt; giving<br/>
&gt; &gt; answers (gotta get those correct answers @ all costs, don&#39;t you know)<br/>
BUT<br/>
&gt; &gt; THE ANSWERS WERE *WRONG*!!!  (ha)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a good chuckle or if you&#39;re really bored, you can take a look @ the<br/>
&gt; TAAS<br/>
&gt; &gt; test for yourself @ their website and see how ridiculous this test<br/>
really<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; ... and ... don&#39;t forget the kidlets STUDY FOR IT!!!  BLAH :P<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I was taken by how impressed everyone in the article is that X%<br/>
&gt; &quot;passed&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; TAAS.  This is not a particularly demanding test, and all the focus<br/>
&gt; seems<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; be on how many kids can pass it.  Not do well on it.  Just pass.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So we are going to spend lots and lots of hours aiming at the lower<br/>
&gt; half<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the class and making sure everyone can pass a meaningless test.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh goodie.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, where was that web page about the Independent Party.  They may<br/>
&gt; lose<br/>
&gt; &gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at least I don&#39;t have to hear this particular brand of hogwash.<br/>
