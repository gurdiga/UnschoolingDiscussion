That&#39;s not the kind of reading that helps kids read chapter books in bed at <br/>
night.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve collected lots of reading accounts here:<br/>
I&#39;ll add a small one here. :)<br/>
<br/>
DS was an early reader -- I think he was born reading. :)<br/>
<br/>
DD asked to be taught to read -- demanded it -- &quot;everyone but me can read!!!&quot; <br/>
-- at about 6. We browsed through various &quot;how to&quot; books on line and she <br/>
picked the &quot;100 Easy Lessons&quot; book. She did about the middle third of that book. <br/>
Which I think is important. That we didn&#39;t do every page and feel obligated to <br/>
start at the beginning or finish it.<br/>
<br/>
And we have tons and tons of books around. <br/>
<br/>
So now she reads -- it took about a year for enough things to click that she <br/>
was an independent reader.<br/>
<br/>
But I also will add in that we are not among the &quot;reading a book under the <br/>
covers crowd.&quot; DS reads the papers and when he needs to read to do something. He <br/>
has never enjoyed fiction. DD likes a good story but isn&#39;t obsessed about it <br/>
-- she&#39;ll take out a few books a week from the library (another good reading <br/>
tool btw - your own library card :) ) and likes to read but isn&#39;t about to <br/>
tackle Harry Potter. Sometimes I read posts online and they seem to suggest that <br/>
kids across America are in bed with Harry P and that just isn&#39;t so in this <br/>
house. And that&#39;s just fine. :) <br/>
