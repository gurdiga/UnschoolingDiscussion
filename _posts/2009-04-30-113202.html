<div id="ygrps-yiv-473213234">Hi folks! This is a reminder that the Early Bird Deadline for registering  <br/>
for the Northeast Unschooling Conference in Wakefield, Massachusetts August <br/>
27 -  30 is tomorrow, May 1.  This is also the deadline to apply for full <br/>
and  partial registration scholarships. Early Bird registration are eligible <br/>
for the  raffle for the cool gift basket stuffed with great stuff, worth over <br/>
$150.<br/>
 <br/>
I also encourage reserving your hotel rooms as soon as possible even if you <br/>
 don&#39;t anticipate being able to make the early registration deadline, <br/>
because the  rooms in our block are going fast. If it looks like we have a need I <br/>
may be able  to increase the block, but the longer we wait, the less likely <br/>
it is.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m really looking forward to this year&#39;s conference. We have great  <br/>
presenters, including the elusive Rue Kream, Madeline Rains, the Lovejoys, and  <br/>
many more. In addition to those presentations, we&#39;ll have a bunch of panel  <br/>
discussions where we can talk about some of the biggest issues that <br/>
unschoolers  face right now. The hotel is gorgeous, and we&#39;ll have lots of space, with <br/>
a  gaming room and an arts, crafts, and creativity room, and lots of great  <br/>
funshops, including a duct tape funshop with the amazing Rick Rossing. <br/>
 <br/>
Let me tell you about the entertainment. On our opening night we&#39;ll have a  <br/>
great dance and Karaoke party led by a good friend of mine, Jean Callahan, <br/>
who  does this professionally.  Friday night a family of grown unschoolers  <br/>
from Rhode Island who have a Celtic folk band called Fishing with Finnegan <br/>

will  be performing for us. Saturday will be our own Talent Show, always <br/>
with lots of  surprises.<br/>
 <br/>
All weekend there&#39;ll be space for our Untrepreneurs to sell their wares.  <br/>
Then there&#39;s the raffle and the silent auction, and most of all, an amazing  <br/>
community of unschoolers.<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s so much more! Please register soon, and, as always if you have any  <br/>
questions or ideas, please give me a call or an email.<br/>
