<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048192600">my dear little 8yog fell apart last night over her not yet being able to <br/>
read.  i really felt for her, she knows that most little people her age have <br/>
learned to read by now, and she is still struggling.  she doesnt spend much <br/>
time trying, mind you, she is very creative and i have been focusing on her <br/>
other strengths (for myself as much as for her) allowing her to create (do <br/>
crafts and artwork) play games and soccer, etc.  i only have one child older <br/>
than she, who was reading at around her 7th bday and for the ensuing 3 yrs <br/>
has spent many of her waking hours reading.  but up til now, i have seen no <br/>
real frustration with herself (8yog)-- i think she thought it would just <br/>
happen, and by now, too.  i told her that i believed that it would get easier <br/>
for her as she gets older, but if she wanted to speed things up, we could do <br/>
some sort of daily session of practice: up to her.  she was in a sad mood, so <br/>
i didnt get a firm answer... just discouragement, so maybe i&#39;ll ask her <br/>
again, or maybe i will leave it alone.  btw, she can read easy words...  any <br/>
advice is welcome.<br/>

Erin, we have &quot;twins&quot; in our children! My eldest is an 11 yog. She started<br/>
reading on her own at 6.5 with no help from me (except daily reading aloud),<br/>
and has had her nose in a book ever since. My 8 yog is more &quot;normal&quot;. She<br/>
reads haltingly and shyly. I went over phonics with her, which I didn&#39;t have<br/>
to do with the eldest. Last night she read a chapter of &quot;Little Bear&quot; to me<br/>
and was so proud of herself. She has to live in her older sister&#39;s shadow<br/>
and that&#39;s not easy. My eldest is very dramatic and the center of everything<br/>
and smart. My 8 yo is just as smart, etc, but she is doomed to be forever 3<br/>
years younger.<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago, Tabitha (8) was complaining that she can&#39;t read. I pointed<br/>
out that I&#39;ve heard her read plenty of times...reading to her little<br/>
sisters, the cereal box, something on TV, labels....She didn&#39;t count that as<br/>
reading because it&#39;s not what _Cristina_(11) was reading, some big book with<br/>
big words. I had to convince her that what she&#39;s doing is in fact reading<br/>
and she should be proud of herself and enjoy it. Then I started reading with<br/>
her without her big sister around. I think that&#39;s really helped. We sit<br/>
together and take turns reading aloud with books I know she can<br/>
handle...children&#39;s poetry, short stories. She was really proud of herself<br/>
when she read &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; to her little sister (she determinedly read<br/>
the words, not just going by memory...this is really important to her). You<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have a little one for her to read to, would you?  If not in your<br/>
own family, then a neighbor, a friend you see often? It really boosts<br/>
Tabitha&#39;s confidence when she&#39;s the older, wiser one.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my 8 yo could be e-pals with your 8 yo? She loves writing letters with<br/>
lots of help from Mom.<br/>

are very welcome, whether the patient knows you or not and the nurses will <br/>
know who needs it the most that day.  If you explain you need someone who <br/>
will listen patiently to dd, you&#39;re likely to get a good match all around.<br/>
