&lt;&lt; I should have known not to ask this list for anything as always  my post <br/>
has been ignored  when I wanted the help and now a lecture given on why I <br/>
should or should not do something, that was not what my question was it was <br/>
does anyone have any great quotes. (my mistake for explaining why I wanted <br/>
them!) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is tacky.<br/>
<br/>
There are unschooling quotes at www.unschooling.com, and all over the <br/>
internet.<br/>
<br/>
Go to www.google.com and put in learning quotes<br/>
or homeschooling quotes<br/>
or unschooling quotes<br/>
<br/>
It seems lots of the posters here have quotes after their names.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But to complain about always being ignored here doesn&#39;t seem productive.<br/>
<br/>
If you want people to help you exactly to your specifications, you have to <br/>
pay them money by the hour.<br/>
<br/>
If you want free help you have to accept it the way it comes.  Insulting your <br/>
volunteer helpers doesn&#39;t help make you a better person or make them want to <br/>
help you next time.<br/>
