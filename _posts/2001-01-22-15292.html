&gt;&gt; &gt; PRESIDENT BUSH ANNOUNCES RELIGIOUS AGENDA ON INAUGURATION DAY<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;BUSH PRESENTS HIMSELF AS &#39;DETERMINED FOE OF<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;CHURCH-STATE SEPARATION,&#39; SAYS AMERICANS UNITED<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;George W. Bush, sworn in today as the nation&#39;s 43rd president, announced<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;religious agenda in his inaugural address, including an emphasis on using<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;houses of worship for providing publicly financed social services.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Just moments after being sworn in as president, Bush used a speech laced<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;with religious rhetoric to explain the role religion will play in his<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;administration.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;[S]ome needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;touch or a pastor&#39;s prayer,&quot; Bush said. &quot;Church and charity, synagogue<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;mosque, lend our communities their humanity, and they will have an<br/>
&gt;honored<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;place in our plans and laws.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Separation of Church and State, expressed concern about Bush&#39;s comments.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Bush apparently believes he was elected national preacher as well as<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;president,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;The newly elected president presented himself<br/>
&gt;today<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;as a determined foe of church-state separation. The Constitution he swore<br/>
&gt;&gt; to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;uphold simply does not permit the president to merge religion and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;government.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Churches and other houses of worship play a cherished role in our<br/>
&gt;society,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;but they do not have a role in our secular laws,&quot; Lynn added. &quot;Bush&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;remarks showed a gross insensitivity to the constitutional principle of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;government neutrality on religion.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Bush also used his inaugural address to emphasize his plans for<br/>
&gt;education,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;remarking, &quot;Together, we will reclaim America&#39;s schools, before ignorance<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;and apathy claim more young lives.&quot; News agencies were reporting today<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Bush will unveil an education plan on Tuesday that will feature vouchers<br/>
&gt;&gt; for<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;religious and other private schools.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Far too much of Bush&#39;s agenda calls for a unity between church and<br/>
&gt;state,&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;noted AU&#39;s Lynn. &quot;To protect the religious liberties of all Americans,<br/>
&gt;his<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;plans must be rejected by Congress.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;In one of his first acts as the nation&#39;s chief executive, Bush issued a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;proclamation ordering today as a &quot;national day of prayer.&quot; Bush, in the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;proclamation, called &quot;upon the citizens of our Nation to gather together<br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;homes and places of worship to pray alone and together and offer<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;thanksgiving to God for all the blessings of this great and good land.&quot;<br/>
&gt;He<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;added, &quot;I ask Americans to bow our heads in humility before our Heavenly<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Father, a God who calls us not to judge our neighbors, but to love them,<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;ask His guidance upon our Nation and its leaders in every level of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;government.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Ironically, Bush quoted Thomas Jefferson both in his inaugural address<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;his day of prayer proclamation. Jefferson, a staunch advocate of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;church-state separation, never issued a prayer proclamation in order to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;preserve government neutrality on religious matters.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Bush would have been wise to follow Jefferson&#39;s example and allow<br/>
&gt;&gt; Americans<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;to make up their own minds about how and when to pray,&quot; said AU&#39;s Lynn.<br/>
&gt;&quot;It<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;would have gotten the Bush presidency off to a much better start.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;The Bush Administration is only a few hours old and it already has<br/>
&gt;&gt; signaled<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;remarkable hostility for church-state separation,&quot; concluded Lynn.<br/>
&gt;&quot;Anyone<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;concerned with this nation&#39;s religious liberties should realize that the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;next four years will be awfully busy.&quot;<br/>
