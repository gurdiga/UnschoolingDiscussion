<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440849422"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I attended school on days when I felt like it, and stayed home when I felt<br/>
&gt; like it, except when the school would send home notices or call my parents<br/>
&gt; and tell them that I would fail my grade and be left back.  At those times<br/>
&gt; my mother would encourage me (but not insist) to go, even if I would rather<br/>
&gt; stay home; she didn&#39;t know there were other options in the 60&#39;s.  Grades<br/>
&gt; were unimportant to them.  I watched as much tv as I wanted, in fact, I was<br/>
&gt; one of the only kids I knew who had unlimited access to television,<br/>
&gt; including a television in my room -- and I watched a lot of tv!  I went to<br/>
&gt; bed when I wanted, I ate what I wanted, etc...  My parents trusted my<br/>
&gt; judgments, and let me make my own decisions.  I was unconditionally loved,<br/>
&gt; and I was supported in my decisions, to the best of may parent&#39;s abilities.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Attending school but being truant a lot isn&#39;t unschooling. It does sound<br/>
like you had a very permissive childhood (I don&#39;t mean permissive in a bad<br/>
way, maybe that&#39;s the wrong word).<br/>
<br/>
I skipped school when I wanted to, too, with my parents support. That<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I was unschooled. Perhaps &quot;sometimes to often non-schooled&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As adults, my sister and I have real problems with organization,<br/>
&gt; persistence in difficult or unpleasant but necessary tasks - oh this<br/>
&gt; clearly requires more time to explain, and I do not have the time - but the<br/>
&gt; results are disorganized homes; difficulty finishing projects begun;<br/>
&gt; unclaimed medical reimbursements due to loss of paperwork, or lapse of<br/>
&gt; time; procrastination; this list goes on...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am still very unclear on why you blame these &quot;failings&quot; on unschooling?<br/>
(Leaving aside for the moment that you weren&#39;t unschooled). Do you not know<br/>
that thousands if not millions of schooled adults have those same &quot;faults&quot;?<br/>
That thousands if not millions of children (schooled & homeschooled) who<br/>
are, today, being told and instructed and reminded and structured and<br/>
moderated will nonetheless grow up to have real problems with organization?<br/>
<br/>
How is such a thing the fault of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What I would like to strive for with my own children are the good aspects<br/>
&gt; of the life we led, while gently guiding them away from the stumbling<br/>
&gt; blocks.  Oh this is all falling on so many deaf ears, so I don&#39;t know why I<br/>
&gt; bothered<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Informed skepticism does not make me deaf.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358177419">Interesting. My mom didn&#39;t care if I skipped as much as I wanted...I <br/>
didn&#39;t even live at home my senior year - lived on my own. In fact, I <br/>
skipped so much high school that they had the problem of figuring out <br/>
what to do with someone who had a 3.9 gpa but not enough days of <br/>
attendance to be allowed to graduate. (It was the 60&#39;s - school was <br/>
easy - there were a lot of other things to do and the beach was only a <br/>
few minutes away.)<br/>
