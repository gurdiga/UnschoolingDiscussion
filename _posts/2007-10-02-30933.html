<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177567253">What an irritating choice of words:<br/>
   <br/>
  Drought forces Lake Superior to set record for low water<br/>
   <br/>
  This was on the Yahoo.com main page, which I usually avoid but I&#39;m getting to mail through the internet instead of my happy mail program.<br/>
   <br/>
  Anyway...<br/>
  A drought shouldn&#39;t be personified as an evil thing that &quot;forces&quot; a lake (which shouldn&#39;t be personified&quot; into setting a record it didn&#39;t even want to set.  Poor lake.  Mean drought!<br/>
   <br/>
  Even professional writers can write things that say what doesn&#39;t make sense and shouldn&#39;t be said, but they shouldn&#39;t do it on this list.<br/>
   <br/>
  Kelli Traaseth is taking me and Holly (and some or all of her kids) to Duluth later this week and I&#39;ll see whether Lake Superior seems distraught about having been forced to set a record.  <br/>

<br/>
I sometimes watch the program &quot;The Universe&quot; and was appalled at the <br/>
segment on the &quot;life cycle&quot; of stars. There was a loooooong description <br/>
on the subject of gravity and nuclear fusion as opposing forces within <br/>
the star that &quot;cast&quot; gravity as some kind of evil villain, actively <br/>
trying to crush the life out of poor stars - and the heroic stars as <br/>
clever and resourceful... Yikes. <br/>
