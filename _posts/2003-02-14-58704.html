 </span></blockquote>We had an angel of a hairdresser too. She used to cut Casey&#39;s hair while <br/>
Casey snuggled against my chest with only one side of her head showing at a <br/>
time. She even cut her hair while Casey was sleeping on me once. And the <br/>
hair cuts were good! We got compliments!<br/>

(once she would sit in the chair) so that she would look down. I kept <br/>
handing her one m&m at a time. That way the hairdresser could cut the hair <br/>
at the nape of her neck. Ahh..good times. lol<br/>
