<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041420602">Does anyone know if the family learning exchange is still in existence? I<br/>
loved their magazines, and I loved the ideas I got from them. They were the<br/>
first ones to truly help me understand natural learning.<br/>
I forgot about them till today when I was cleaning out my attic (see other<br/>
post).<br/>
<br/>
I tried to get to their site but keep getting a computer error. Are they<br/>
long gone?<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>
