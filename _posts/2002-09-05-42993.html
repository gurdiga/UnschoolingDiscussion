&gt; each child a seperate CAT test so you just write the child&#39;s name <br/>
&gt; on it, fill ina % of the circles correctly yourself, being careful to get <br/>
&gt; the score just over the required 23 percentile and Seton mark it for <br/>
&gt; you and you get a piece of paper with your child&#39;s name and a <br/>
&gt; score to make the county happy.<br/>
&gt; It isn&#39;t strictly 100% legal I would imagine but the county&#39;s main <br/>
&gt; concern is to get a piece of paper with a number on it every year. <br/>
&gt; They never question further than that and you are left in peace.<br/>
