<div id="ygrps-yiv-463175151">Hi Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I have been unschooling for a little over a month now after going <br/>
through a very rough winter with a structured curriculum.  My kids <br/>
have finally I guess you could say &quot;settled down&quot; sort of state.  <br/>
There are days where I get nervous because I feel like my kids <br/>
haven&#39;t learned a thing.  I need some encouragement and support.  <br/>
Does anyone have some good pointers or know of some good books that I <br/>
could get my hands on?  I want to know how I can become a good <br/>
facilitator for my kids without getting too involved.  One of the <br/>
reasons that I decided to take this approach was because I want my <br/>
kids to make mistake, no it&#39;s okay and learn from them.<br/>
<br/>
Your advice would be greatly appreciated.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hello,<br/>
I was nervous also my first year, a new way of thinking not<br/>
only for you but your whole family.<br/>
I woke up plenty of mornings, and went &quot;what am I doing?&quot;<br/>
By God, all my friends, neighbors are all sending their kids<br/>
off to school, have I gone off the deep end?<br/>
LOL - a few of my thoughts<br/>
Hang loose, if you are being too structured.<br/>
Have fun with the kids. <br/>
Do something off the wall fun.<br/>
And as for you, take some time for you, so you are not<br/>
eaten alive! Don&#39;t consume yourself with the kids 24-7.<br/>
I didn&#39;t homeschool to educate my son like a public school.<br/>
Let the kids make some decisions and let them be the leaders.<br/>
<br/>
Write me if you need more help.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;There are days where I get nervous because I feel like my kids haven&#39;t <br/>
&gt;&gt;learned a thing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not possible so stop worrying. :o) They may not be learning a school <br/>
provided curriculum anymore, but they&#39;re learning about themselves and their <br/>
world. Give it time. You&#39;ve only been deschooling/unschooling for a month <br/>
now. Give the kids and yourself time to get used to this new way of Being.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Does anyone have some good pointers...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Relax. Breathe. Be in the moment with yourself and your kids. Get to know <br/>
each other without the veil of a curriculum between you. Treat today like <br/>
the first day of a really great vacation in a really interesting and fun <br/>
place. Do the same thing tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;...or know of some good books that I could get my hands on?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Keep reading here with an open heart. Also go to the message boards and <br/>
articles at www.unschooling.com and at www.sandradodd.com. Real unschooling <br/>
lives and stories are unfolding each day at these wonderful online <br/>
resources.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;One of the reasons that I decided to take this approach was because I want <br/>
&gt;&gt;my kids to make mistake, no it&#39;s okay and learn from them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Remember, you need to know and believe that for yourself too. Give yourself <br/>
room and understanding as you learn about this knew way called unschooling. <br/>
Your kids will be fine.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

that article was NOT a pile of garbage!!<br/>
It helped me to sit down with my 7 year old son and enjoy the movie The <br/>
Musketeer, and opened up some play for him and we cuddled and I relaxed and <br/>
was not worried about for his future as an illiterate goober due to my <br/>
neglect!!<br/>

No problem!<br/>

It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t appreciate the compliment!!  I just felt it came <br/>
unfairly, and I hadn&#39;t been fishing for it, so wanted to be honest. <br/>

nowadays) linked from here:<br/>
