<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and moving. All this, and I am not really a big rap fan! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just popping out of lurkdom to agree, I don&#39;t know anything about<br/>
Emenim, but I do know Brian Warner and how people (my mom was one of<br/>
them until I introduced her to him) can&#39;t get past the appearance or the<br/>
choice of language he tends to use.  If people could see that the choice<br/>
of language (in a lot of cases I know of personally, others I can&#39;t<br/>
comment on) is a message itself.  Saying things like &quot;you will only<br/>
listen if i talk like this&quot; or &quot;you aren&#39;t going to take me seriously no<br/>
matter what i do, so shock value will at least make you take notice of<br/>
this situation&quot; or &quot;i use this to put up a barrier between me and<br/>
everyone who has hurt me&quot; or just &quot;you and people like you piss me off&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Now I know I am getting up there (just 27 years old, but in the music<br/>
business that&#39;s almost over the hill! LOL), and I know that most of the<br/>
MTV stuff I have no idea about (since we don&#39;t even have television) but<br/>
I do know music of rebellion and--to the woman who had concerns about<br/>
her sons language in his music writing--I know what&#39;s its like to be<br/>
ostracized.  IMO your son is reacting normally and you are doing a great<br/>
job in keeping the line of communication open.  If my mom hadn&#39;t done<br/>
the same for me, if she had refused to let me explore my own boundaries,<br/>
then I would have felt the need to hide things from her and who knows<br/>
where that would have led!  Your doing great man (I mean, mom), rock on.<br/>
