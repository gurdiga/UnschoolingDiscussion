My son, Sky, who is a19 year old unschooled student of life, first played a<br/>
wooden flute in first grade at a Waldorf School - that passion for music<br/>
has now extended to his owning, and playing daily with various degrees of<br/>
proficiency - Highland bagpipes, recorder, violin, guitar, tinwhistles,<br/>
keyboard, African drum, clarinet, piano, trumpet, ocarina, bamboo flute,<br/>
and harmonica. . . . he has taken lessons on/off/on/on/off/off since 7<br/>
years old. . . several of the instruments he has collected in different<br/>
ways - bought on trips (he would rather browse in Lark in the Morning - a<br/>
music store in California - than any where else!), traded for, gotten as<br/>
gifts, etc. . . I have tried to help facilitate his interest - providing<br/>
lessons when that was possible, buying CDs as gifts, supporting his<br/>
pursuing being a classical music programmer at our community radio station,<br/>
etc. . . but I never forced him to practice, or continue with lessons when<br/>
he felt he had gotten something out of it and was ready to stop or pause or<br/>
switch . . if a child has a gift and/or passion for music (or whatever) - I<br/>
feel I can only encourage and bless that. . . not &quot;make them&quot; do it. . . it<br/>
is my opinion that doesn&#39;t work. <br/>
Just my thoughts this windy, misty evening on Kauai,<br/>
