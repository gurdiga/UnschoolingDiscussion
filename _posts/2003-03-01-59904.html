&gt; You know how sometimes we don&#39;t even realize we are using math or science <br/>
&gt; as <br/>
&gt; we go around our daily routine, but really it is?  Kinda like you cannot <br/>
&gt; hardly do cooking without fractions and baking is all about science really.<br/>

the word problems might be helpful in that.  Then, as situations naturally <br/>
arise, and if your dc ask about mathematical approaches, you&#39;ll have <br/>
something backing you up.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I mostly tend to just approximate solutions.  Not very mathematic, <br/>
but it works for me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t taken trig or calc myself, so I can&#39;t speak to these advanced math <br/>
disciplines, but I&#39;m thinking of two real-life situations where we did use <br/>
geometric and algebraic equations: planning out a garden and hanging a <br/>
complex grid of photographs on a wall.  Please don&#39;t ask me to explain :-) -- <br/>
dh and a friend helped with it and it was a couple of years ago.  I&#39;d have to <br/>
try to work it out all over again, but it was fun (for a change of pace. &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>
)<br/>

good estimators. It is a really important part of math - but in school, <br/>
they make the kids estimate when there is no reason to do so, just to <br/>
try to make them learn to do it. It doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
