<h4>Yol, Vishnu & Shanti</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-834469720">Well, maybe I&#39;m harsh too, but I would do exactly the same! Your mother needs to understand and accept that YOUR kids are not HERS and that she has no right whatsoever to control your life and jeopardize YOUR rights to homeschool/unschool and parent your kids the way you want.<br/>
You don&#39;t mention the actual legal implications of what she&#39;s done, so it hard to say what to do in that respect, but as far as she is personaly concerned, I would defnitely write her off!<br/>

&gt; &gt;  My own mother called CPS on me<br/>
&gt; &gt;  for homeschooling my kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OK, my answer is pretty harsh.  I&#39;d move and cut her out of my life.  She&#39;s<br/>
&gt; into active aggression.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My parents went from passive to active aggression over an issue.   I wrote<br/>
&gt; them a letter saying that I was sorry about the choices they had made and<br/>
&gt; that they needed to change if I was going to come back into their lives.  It<br/>
&gt; was the best thing I had ever done up to that point in my life.  And it<br/>
&gt; worked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course, now you have a government agency involved and she has put your<br/>
&gt; family at great risk.  My situation was nothing compared to this.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know anything about your relationship with your mother or about you, but if<br/>
&gt; it were to happen to me, that&#39;s what I would do.<br/>
