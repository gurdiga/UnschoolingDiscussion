<div id="ygrps-yiv-642371797">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
    My name is Virginia. I am new to the list and have been reading digests for two days and really wanted to add my two cents to this particular topic.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Two years ago a teacher &quot;diagnosed&quot; my son as having ADHD. The doctors took this diagnosis as gospel and I was bullied at the hands of DSS into medicating him. It has not worked and my son&#39;s &quot;misbehavior&quot; has only escalated. That is why I am taking him out of public school system. This is such an overused label.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have bipolar disorder. A real doctor diagnosed this problem after tests and many sessions of me explaining how &quot;weird&quot; I am, how many days on end I do not sleep and how much stuff I get done and exactly what I call risk taking behaviors. But this is something I rarely share this with others because the label &quot;Bipolar&quot; get so misused in the popular media that people have asked me some pretty strange questions. People think those with bipolar disorder are prone to be mass murderers, can&#39;t have kids, never marry and are completely deranged, only being marginally normal because of the miracle of the drug, Lithium.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The truth is that I allowed myself to be minimally medicated so that I would sleep occasionally and so that I can function as a quasi- normal parent. I have a child, have been married three times, have never killed any one and I only get mildly deranged while suffering once a month from PMS (According to my son that&#39;s Pre Monster Syndrome). I can laugh at the label I have. My son cannot laugh at his.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This label is all over his school paperwork. Teachers make assumptions right from the beginning when they see that label and it colors their interaction for the rest of the year. They say my son is disruptive. I have been in class and witnessed this. He is excited to be learning and not shy about speaking out. He is impatient to show you that he knows the answer and gets frustrated with classmates who lag behind. He is ready to move on.right now. It causes problems, to be sure. But he is not being the monster that they describe in notes home to me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Then there is this whole hyperactivity thing. He can&#39;t sit still. yes. I agree. So let the kid move. To her credit, his first grade teacher would let him move to a carpet near the books when he got too fidgety in his desk. He still participated in class while he was reading something totally off topic from the carpeted area. He was bothering no one. He was not disruptive and he passed the first grade with flying colors. except for writing. The kid&#39;s penmanship is atrocious. So what? I can read it.barely&lt;G&gt;. Mine is lousy too. I am a writer with the penmanship of a doctor. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As adults, when someone hangs us with a label we can choose whether or not to accept it, embrace it or ignore it. But when a child gets hung with a label they do not get to choose. I am not blind. Something is wrong with my son. He has wild mood swings, erratic moods, violent outbursts and unexplained crying spells. at school. It is not as bad or as pronounced at home. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have finally found a doctor who will really listen to what we are telling him about our son. And eventually we will get to the heart of the problem and heal it. But until then I wish we could just get educators to drop these labels. Just describe what it is the child is doing and get on with it. ADD and ADHD are more than just labels. They are evaluations of where are children belong in some arbitrary pecking order. They are value judgments delineating how perfect or imperfect our babies are.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You can teach Math or English from a book but not so with self esteem. Until the school system and our society as a whole sees ADD and ADHD as what they are, labels for behavior that they disapprove of   and excuses to medicate free souls into submission, then I am quite happy with my decision to remove my child from their diploma factory.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Wow. I did not realize just how badly this subject really pushed my buttons. I had not originally planned to write all of that, but now that I have I hope you all will forgive me for jumping upon such a big soapbox&lt;ggg&gt;. Before I fall off this thing, someone else jump up here with me. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am new to unschooling. In fact, I am still waiting for my paperwork to be approved. My son will still be in school until early October. I have been keeping him home a day or two a week and beginning the process of unschooling him, getting him used to the idea of it and the rhythm of it. Considering that he sees his psychologist once a week and he has missed school several times because the school will no longer let us send him to the bus stop until the bus gets here and he was left behind (He kept pretending to be a dog and tried to chase the bus, according to the bus driver.), they don&#39;t really question me too hard about his attendance.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to meeting you all and shooting off my mouth when you all indulge me&lt;G&gt; Take care.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Brightest Blessings,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806760136">Dear Virginia,<br/>
<br/>
I can somewhat relate to your description of your son.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
sent my daughter (who&#39;s almost 6) to school, and I self-diagnose her to<br/>
be ADHD based on the checklist that can be found on almost any ADD<br/>
website.  In addition, she has developed TICS, so I&#39;m self-diagnosing<br/>
her as having Tourettes.  She also has explosive outburts and blame<br/>
everybody for her problems.  I&#39;m looking into coping techniques from<br/>
&quot;The Explosive Child&quot;.  I joined a Tourette&#39;s list, because her tics<br/>
were so severe at one time, we panicked.  Sad to say, the majority of<br/>
the list members advocated medication --- this list is not a homeschool<br/>
list, so I don&#39;t think the members can relate to me very well.  <br/>
That&#39;s why I&#39;m looking for a more homeschool-friendly list for<br/>
children with &quot;special needs or gifted&quot; (however you want to call it)<br/>
that doesn&#39;t immediately jump to meds as a quick-fix to all their<br/>
problems.<br/>
I also finished reading the book &quot;ADD - A different perception&quot; by Thom <br/>
Hartmann, and it&#39;s a very empowering book.  He criticises the public<br/>
school system for failing to deal with gifted children, whom the<br/>
teachers easily dismiss as &quot;problem&quot; children.  Another book that I<br/>
found empowering is Thomas Armstrong&#39;s &quot;In Their Own Way&quot; and &quot;The<br/>
Myth of ADD&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t believe in the school system anymore, and anything<br/>
that requires interaction with the school system, I avoid as much as<br/>
possible.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope you will find homeschooling a more satisfying and rewarding<br/>
experience for you and your son.   This list keeps people &quot;sane&quot;,<br/>
instead of other lists e.g. for special needs or whatever, which seems<br/>
to advocate that people with &quot;disorders&quot; are outcasts and needs meds<br/>
to function completely in society.  This is a very sad picture.  <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>
Merilyn<br/>

       Just wanted to let you know, in case you are not aware, people <br/>
with bipolar disorder frequently are first diagnosed as ADD or ADHD, <br/>
especially kids, are put on meds, and often those meds create more <br/>
problems for them, according to a Dr. interviewed about bipolar <br/>
disorder just yesterday on KPFA, a Pacifica station (Berkeley, CA).  <br/>
Unfortunately, I do not remember the Dr.&#39;s name, nor do I remember <br/>
the name of the program, but it is one hosted by an arrogant Dr. The <br/>
Dr. he was interviewing was a bipolar specialist.  KPFA&#39;s office # is <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-605353428">Why would an unschooler choose the path of  medicating their children?<br/>
There&#39;s no need for ritalin, since the child doesn&#39;t need to be <br/>
confined in a classroom and forced to sit and behave.  There&#39;s no <br/>
need for medication for Tourettes, since there is no classroom to be <br/>
complaining about the child&#39;s tics.  Please tell me, why do you <br/>
choose to medicate?<br/>
<br/>
It is very rare to hear that parents of schooled children take the <br/>
stand of not-medicating their children, because they are usually <br/>
pressured to do so by the school system.  <br/>
<br/>
Ideally, if there&#39;s such a list out there, I&#39;d like to join which <br/>
advocates for attachment parenting, unschooling, healthy living, <br/>
homesteading, with gifted special needs children.  <br/>

<br/>
I take medication as part of my remediation of my own ADD. I&#39;m not in school. I don&#39;t have to sit still for 6 hours a day. I was in my 30&#39;s before I discovered that I had ADD, so my use of medication isn&#39;t a residual &quot;schoolish&quot; habit, either.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I take medication so that I can concentrate well enough to do things that other people take for granted. The greatest enhancement that medication brought to my life was my new ability to drive a car. I couldn&#39;t do that until I had the assistance of the meds. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
(Since I live in a rural area, that&#39;s a major widening of my life. No more carrying gallons of milk home in my backpack, buying only what other groceries I could balance in bags on my bicycle handles. Now I can take the kids places too far away to walk. Now I can go to the library even in a rainstorm.)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One of the first things that ADD adults talk about, when they start meds, is how they can complete tasks -- again, something that most people take for granted. We joke about flitting from task to task and ending the day exhausted, yet without having accomplished one single thing. We joke about how we&#39;ve never seen an entire movie in one sitting, even if we did actually sit in front of the screen without moving away. We joke about how we bring books or knitting into the kitchen while we cook, because if our wandering attention leads us out of the kitchen, it&#39;s the smoke alarm that reminds us that we were supposed to be cooking.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We joke, but ADD often plays havoc with relationships, strains family life, increases stress and aggravates stress-induced illnesses, and closes many of life&#39;s options.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Knowing that, should we say to a child, &quot;Schools over-medicate, so you don&#39;t get a chance to try meds.&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The choice to use or not use meds isn&#39;t permanent, either. My son (HFA/Asperger Syndrome with low-level TS) doesn&#39;t currently use meds. But during early adolescence, he used Catapres to help with his poor impulse control.  His frustration-induced outbursts frightened him and us, as well as blocking particpation in activities from playing Hide-&-Seek to picking out books at the library.<br/>
<br/>
(Can you imagine the terror of a parent whose highly-impulsive kids threatens to  someday throw himself in front of a truck? Been there, done that. You don&#39;t get a t-shirt, you get dark circles under your eyes.)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope parents who opt out of meds don&#39;t implant medication-phobia in their kids. Someday those kids may need meds to bypass handicaps from their lives, and may feel like &quot;failures&quot; for &quot;having to resort to&quot; using meds. Meds are an option. The choise to not use them should be an action, not a reaction to bad behavior by schools.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-297905343">Nancy,  I have to agree with you on the medication thing.  My own family struggles with different sicknesses that have been difficult to handle without meds.  ADD, my brother; MS/depression, my sister; depression,  my other brother;  and fibromyalgia/depression, me.  <br/>
I probably could get by without meds if I only had to take care of myself, but when we threw in 3 children..my health was what went.  <br/>
I used to think if I really tried I could do it without meds, but you know what?  I couldn&#39;t.  And without it, my children and family suffered.  <br/>
So I also think there is a tendency to over medicate but there is a place for meds sometimes too.  We can easily generalize and say the natural way is best, but if the quality of a persons life is being compromised, such as a child feeling unloved, as what happened to me growing up.....I say bring on the medication!!  I am such a better, laid back person, my kids enjoy me and I enjoy them.  When I can get more sleep, get more exercise and just plain take care of myself more,,, then I might beable to go off, but for now, this is what&#39;s best for me.<br/>
I suppose this has been said before to those of you who have been on the list for a long time but I felt like I needed to say it.  Thanks for listening.<br/>
Blah, Blah, Blah,  I&#39;ll stop rambling/ranting/standing on my soap box now!<br/>

help people see that not only is homeschooling a good way to raise/teach<br/>
kids, but that unschooling is also a good approach to life.  By describing<br/>
what families do and believe, I hope to help others see the validity and<br/>
benefits of this philosophy.  I definitely do not come to the research as an<br/>
