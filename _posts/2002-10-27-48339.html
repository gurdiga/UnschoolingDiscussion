&lt;&lt; I understand the desire to understand and accept people and give positive<br/>
responses . . .  But it can&#39;t be at the expense of an<br/>
innocent child&#39;s well-being.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
No, in cases of anything.  <br/>
In unschooling discussions I&#39;d rather help the children&#39;s mother to get to <br/>
unschooling for the sake of her children than to help comfor the mother who&#39;s <br/>
kinda wanting to just keep her toe in the water for a year or two thinking <br/>
about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
In cases of discussing spanking, I&#39;m more worried about improving the love <br/>
and trust between parent and child for that child&#39;s sake.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s selfish in this way:  The more adults who come out of this time <br/>
period who were not abused and forced to do stupid schoolwork, the more <br/>
adults my own kids can choose from for friends and partners.   <br/>
