only 5 percent of them were nursed by their own mothers. Infant mortality rates <br/>
were really high with under this system. There were actually public service <br/>
sorts of messages encouraging women to breast feed their own children.**<br/>

I love that poster, I have it framed and hanging in my dining area,  <br/>
along with another called Baby on Strike.<br/>
Its really fascinating to go thru and look at all the WPA posters.  <br/>
quite a few are about syphilis! and there are lots of regional ones,  <br/>
too. The art is interesting, and its interesting to see what was  <br/>
important then, and what was being promoted (propagandaed?)<br/>
