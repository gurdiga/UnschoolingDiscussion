<div id="ygrps-yiv-767922236">Hi everyone. We are new to the list.  We have two boys in early elementary<br/>
age.  I&#39;d really like to make this unschooling/delight directed<br/>
philosophie(s) work, but I&#39;m really struggling with the ...concept I guess<br/>
or the guilt maybe of not doing &quot;anything&quot;.  Can you tell me what you did<br/>
today?<br/>
<br/>
Can  you tell me your definition of unschooling?  Do you use any workbook at<br/>
all or is that what unschooling is all about?<br/>
<br/>
Right now my oldest just wants to read his Garfield comic books or watch TV<br/>
or listen to the radio or play on the computer or go sledding.  ANYTHING,<br/>
but &quot;school&quot;. So I thought, well maybe he&#39;s stressed by the workbooks, so we<br/>
cut some out of our day.  No change in him.  Sometimes I think he&#39;s just<br/>
taking this being home thing for granted and needs a dose of what it could<br/>
be like!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any tips?<br/>

<br/>
If somewhere in your life your sons are supposed to &quot;do school&quot; (instead of <br/>
sledding,  read his Garfield comic books or watch TV<br/>
<br/>
or listen to the radio or play on the computer) then you&#39;re not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Workbooks aren&#39;t unschooling materials.<br/>
<br/>
That said, my daughter finished a workbook last week.  But she started it <br/>
about five years ago, or maybe one of her brothers did.  It was in box of <br/>
puzzle books, coloring books, and such.  It was an Animaniacs 2nd grade math <br/>
book.  She finished it, some pages in a more difficult way than the authors <br/>
intended, and all for fun, and just for her own amusement.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;...or the guilt maybe of not doing &quot;anything&quot;.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Until you think of &quot;schoolwork&quot; as the small nothing and the rest of life as <br/>
the big something, unschooling won&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
You should be doing EVERYTHING with your children.  <br/>
Not nothing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Sometimes I think he&#39;s just<br/>
<br/>
taking this being home thing for granted and needs a dose of what it could<br/>
<br/>
be like!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of what being home could be like you mean?<br/>
You should spend a few weeks finding out what being home can really be like!! <br/>
Find out how sweet and peaceful and funny and wonderful it can be at home <br/>
with your children and NO school thoughts whatsoever, just happy life and <br/>
lots of togetherness.   When you get to that happy place, learning will just <br/>
fill up all the empty spaces entirely.<br/>
<br/>
If they ARE being home, why wouldn&#39;t they &quot;take that for granted&quot;?<br/>
Do they take it for granted that they are your sons?  Do they take for <br/>
granted that the sun will come up tomorrow?   No problem!  If it doesn&#39;t, we <br/>
can worry about that when it doesn&#39;t happen! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Anyone have any tips?&gt;&gt;<br/>

Hi, Tyra --<br/>
<br/>
My son is 8 and a half.  Reading comic books (incl. Garfield), riding<br/>
his scooter, watching TV and playing on the computer are the most common<br/>
things he does with his time.  We also play with friends and have<br/>
interesting conversations about what we see or read.  He doesn&#39;t do any<br/>
workbooks, and I don&#39;t ask him to.  He has gained a lot of math practice<br/>
playing games, especially Monopoly.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun to go to www.googlism.com and put &quot;unschooling&quot; in the search<br/>
field.  I got a lot of partial definitions of unschooling, kind of like<br/>
one would find in a fortune cookie.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m terrible at writing my own definitions.)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are new too and I still have days where I worry, they are getting less<br/>
now. Here is our day today.<br/>
I woke later than usual a little after 8:30. All four kids were playing<br/>
happily upstairs so I got on the computer to read emails while I ate my<br/>
bagel for breakfast. I had offered to do bagels for the kids but they had<br/>
already gotten their own breakfast of crackers, vegetarian cheese slices and<br/>
vegetarian baloney slices. Eventually all 4 kids made their way downstairs<br/>
and started batteries for their remote control cars charging.<br/>
Once downstairs the kids remembered there were still lots of balloons left<br/>
from Colin&#39;s 5th birthday on Tuesday. So then they blew some up and drew<br/>
faces on them or wrote words on them. Then they decided to make water<br/>
balloons. The oldest, Trevor age 8 1/2 was trying to figure out how much<br/>
water you could put in before it would pop, or why the air always went to<br/>
the top and the water to the bottom. Hayley-7 made a special balloon for<br/>
each of her brothers with drawings on them. Tristan-3 1/2 and Colin-newly 5<br/>
then went to watch TV while the older two continued the balloon game. Then<br/>
they were tossing the water balloons to each other and I got a little<br/>
worried about a flooded kitchen! The little guys watched Cailou and<br/>
something else then the big two came in when they heard Scooby doo start.<br/>
All four watched that show while I cooked dinner. We have our big meal<br/>
around 1:00 since DH works nights. DH woke up somewhere around then and<br/>
showered. Then we all had dinner and the kids did some creative food trading<br/>
and tried to get the puppy to play with their brussel sprouts and see if she<br/>
would eat one (some of them like brussel sprouts I wasn&#39;t being a mean<br/>
mummy!!!) The puppy did not eat a brussel sprout for anyone wondering :-).<br/>
After dinner the pattern blocks set was taken out by Hayley and she and the<br/>
younger boys played with that for about an hour. Trevor put charged<br/>
batteries back into remote control cars. Then they all played with Colin&#39;s<br/>
new remote control fire truck. It squirts water, which I did not know when<br/>
we bought it! I let them play with it in the kitchen and they made targets<br/>
to shoot the water at. Eventually all 4 made their way upstairs again and I<br/>
found them playing with a variety of toys. About 5:00 pm as I was<br/>
considering supper Colin asked if he could learn to use the toaster now that<br/>
he&#39;s 5. So I showed him how it works and he made bagels for all his<br/>
siblings. Tristan wanted something different so I got that for him and he<br/>
also shared my popcorn. The other 3 worked out how best to split Tristans<br/>
bagel. Then Trevor wanted 2 sandwiches as well, which I made for him. That<br/>
boy never stops eating. Everyone got drinks and younger three headed<br/>
upstairs to watch a video of Nick Jr. shows. Trevor stayed downstairs to<br/>
watch cyberchase and now he has spongebob on while I am reading emails.<br/>
We have used a variety of curriculum over the past 3 years, this year was<br/>
Bob Jones homesat. We are definetly de-schooling at the moment. My oldest<br/>
has SID/Aspergers and hates workbooks. It makes me cring to think I made him<br/>
do some before we came to unschooling. He is really blosoming now, he told<br/>
me the other day he counted to 1000 when he couldn&#39;t sleep one night (when<br/>
he had chicken pox last week) and then he counted to 500 by 5&#39;s and 10&#39;s!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487745385">I usually get out of bed after Pat (dh) takes his shower.  He makes me a<br/>
latte every morning and we sit at the table sharing the newspaper before he<br/>
leaves for work.  Jackie got up before he left.<br/>
<br/>
My kids called me to come see Julie Andrews on TV earlier today.  She was<br/>
doing some sort of reading promotion.  When it was over I commented that it<br/>
seemed strange to see all this stuff trying to convince parents to read to<br/>
their kids.  I told them that I read to them because I like to read to them<br/>
and they like it too.  Lisa (10) asked if she could read to me this morning<br/>
and what did I want her to read.  I mentioned a couple of books, (fiction<br/>
and non-fiction).  She read to me from a book about hamsters that I got<br/>
yesterday at the library.  We got a hamster last week.<br/>
<br/>
I went with her this morning for her petsitting job.  We walked Woody, and<br/>
when he pooped, as he always does, I picked it up for her because she thinks<br/>
it&#39;s really gross and I told her that she should give me part of her money<br/>
since I do the poop scooping, (even though I thinks it&#39;s gross too, but I<br/>
guess we moms get sort of used to poopy jobs), anyway, the poop was steaming<br/>
in the cold air and I commented on that, which led to a conversation about<br/>
things in and coming out of our bodies are warm like our bodies.<br/>
<br/>
I watched a baby Looney tunes cartoon with the kids.  The babies all overate<br/>
cereal because the granny said they couldn&#39;t have the toys in the cereal<br/>
until the cereal was gone.  They were all &quot;punished&quot; with terrible stomach<br/>
aches (lots of cartoon burping there) and the next day grammy fed them<br/>
oatmeal instead.  There was a Trix cereal commercial and I said that I loved<br/>
Trix when I was a kid, but I don&#39;t like it anymore.  The rabbit said &quot;Trix<br/>
is for kids&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Jackie (7)  asked me to listen to her sing a song on her karaoke.  I told<br/>
her that I noticed the movements she made to go along with the lyrics and<br/>
she demonstrated a couple of them again.<br/>
<br/>
Both kids made a bead design, the kind that you put little beads on a frame,<br/>
then iron it.  Lisa made a heart shaped one with an &quot;L&quot; in the middle.<br/>
Jackie spelled LOVE and she is giving it to Daddy for Valentine&#39;s Day.  She<br/>
had to redo the V and E because she didn&#39;t like the way they looked the<br/>
first time.  Later, Jackie started another one, and asked me if Daddy knows<br/>
how to iron.  I suspect that she is making it for me :-)<br/>
<br/>
We had some homeschooling friends visit today.  Jackie and Josie made<br/>
cookies.  They also went skating, biking, and scootering.  All the kids<br/>
played on the swing set for a while.  Lisa and Sarah played with play dough,<br/>
then Sarah and her mom went off to the first day of Sarah&#39;s six session art<br/>
class.  Lisa saw the neighbor walking three dogs and pushing a stroller and<br/>
went out to join her for a little while.<br/>
<br/>
I made soup and bread.  Lisa helped me braid the dough.<br/>
<br/>
The neighbor girl came over and now she and Jackie are working on a 550<br/>
piece puzzle.  We have had a puzzle going on a table in the corner of the<br/>
living room for about a month now.  When we finish one, we leave it a day or<br/>
two, then take it down and start a new one.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight we are sitting for Jackie&#39;s friend Edward for a couple of hours<br/>
while his mom is at the PTO meeting and Dad is at Karate.  Jackie is very<br/>
happy that he will be coming over.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-693011459">Hi Tyra<br/>
<br/>
I like that cool decoration in your sig line.<br/>
<br/>
This is the day we had (I am just on the edges of unschooling, and my <br/>
kids are really more &quot;deschooling&quot; right now)<br/>
<br/>
I got up at 5:30 and got some laundry started, then spent an hour or <br/>
so reading some John Taylor Gatto online, and writing in my journal. <br/>
Also, wrote a letter to my best friend and sent it, with the second <br/>
chapter in HER story, that I gave her for her b-day and am sending <br/>
one chapter at a time, to keep the suspense up.<br/>
<br/>
Kids were up by 9:00ish. They slept in, because last night was a late <br/>
night for them. We stuck Jupiter back on the ceiling. It&#39;s heavy, and <br/>
the tape doesn&#39;t hold it very well anymore. Robby wanted to know if <br/>
Pluto was really smaller than Mercury in our model, and I assured him <br/>
it was. <br/>
<br/>
I had the kids all bring their dirty clothes from their rooms into <br/>
the laundry room, and folded the whites while Katie (8) and I <br/>
watched &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; together. It hit me strongly, this time <br/>
around.  The passion and vision of that father and that girl; the <br/>
courage of following their dreams. Hmm. Funny how things come into <br/>
your life that dovetail so amazingly with other things.<br/>
<br/>
While we watched the movie, Robby was playing computer, and Abbie <br/>
studying some for the correspondence school we have her enrolled in. <br/>
She also figured out a couple of tunes on her Irish Flute. She&#39;s <br/>
trying to perfect the sharps and flats on that instrument. <br/>
<br/>
After lunch, my hubby took Abbie to her drama class and Robby went <br/>
with them. He wanted to see if the library had computer games to <br/>
check out. He&#39;s reading Hardy Boys mysteries right now, and wants to <br/>
make sure he always has two at hand, but for some reason, not more <br/>
than two. the one he&#39;s reading, plus one right available for when he <br/>
finishes. He and I also talked about what he&#39;d like to do that <br/>
involved math (I know, I know, it isn&#39;t unschooling to separate the <br/>
subjects out of life like that....I&#39;m getting there, but I ain&#39;t <br/>
there yet) No, he doesn&#39;t want to do problems on paper. He&#39;d rather <br/>
play Clue Finders or Operation Neptune on the computer. <br/>
<br/>
Katie went outside to sled, and I read some more Gatto and talked to <br/>
a friend on the phone. straightened up the front room and dining <br/>
room. Sketched out a picture I&#39;m thinking about. Katie, meanwhile, <br/>
was in and out. We listened to Hank the Cow Dog in Monkey Business <br/>
and laughed our heads off.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the family got home, and Dad took Robby with him, on some <br/>
more errands. &quot;Boys&#39; Evening Out.&quot; Abbie posted some on an online <br/>
LOTR forum and talked on the phone with a friend. Katie has some <br/>
candles lit in the middle of the table, for what purpose I&#39;m not <br/>
sure...she tells me &quot;to light it up in here.&quot; She&#39;s having a snack <br/>
and enjoying the candlelight.<br/>
<br/>
Really, this has been more of a hanging out day. Not even a speck <br/>
busy. Just being home and doing whatever. Tomorrow, we ski. ack. <br/>
First time for the kids; first time in 25 years, for me! ack.<br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;tips.&quot; Even if unschooling was completely wacked out and <br/>
utter nonsense, to be avoided at all costs, I would advise, <br/>
especially if they&#39;ve been in school...let them decompress for the <br/>
first year. Don&#39;t &quot;do school&quot; with them at all, but build the <br/>
relationship by just being with them and enjoying each other. Don&#39;t <br/>
worry about academics one bit, but just be with them. Do stuff <br/>
together. Spend time with each other.<br/>
<br/>
peace, Heidi<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-375887156">Can you tell me what you did<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; today?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, last night Luke (3) woke up at 11:30 and couldn&#39;t go back to <br/>
sleep. (The attic door is in his room and he&#39;s been scared of the <br/>
attic lately). After laying in his bed with him for awhile it became <br/>
obvious that he was wide awake and wouldn&#39;t be falling asleep any <br/>
time soon.  So we went downstairs, read 3 Clifford books, made blue <br/>
popcorn, and put on the Brave Little Toaster.  I ended up sleeping <br/>
with him downstairs on the sofa bed so that he could fall asleep <br/>
watching the video.  He didn&#39;t go to sleep until 2:30 am (which of <br/>
course means I didn&#39;t go to sleep until 2:30 am).  I don&#39;t usually <br/>
sleep the greatest on the sofa bed, so when Alisha (9) came down at <br/>
8:30 and woke us up, Luke and I went upstairs to sleep in my bed <br/>
for &quot;just a half hour&quot;.  I asked her to wake me at 9 and she did, but <br/>
I got up at 10. :)  Luke didn&#39;t get up until noon.  <br/>
<br/>
When I got up, I started cleaning the kitchen and diningroom right <br/>
away and made lunch.  Two of their friends were coming over at noon <br/>
and Alisha had chosen a menu--brocolli with velveeta cheese on top, <br/>
tomato soup, and toasted cheese sandwiches.  I put on the Horse <br/>
Whisperer on audio tape to listen to while I worked--audio tapes from <br/>
the library make cleaning more fun. :)  And what do you know--Alisha <br/>
cleaned up the livingroom without even being asked!  I was just going <br/>
to let the livingroom go, but she straightened it up and then got her <br/>
dolls out and lined them up on the couch.  <br/>
<br/>
While they were eating lunch, I got the mail.  I had won an ebay <br/>
auction for computer games and they came today--Pajama Sam Not afraid <br/>
of the dark, Little Bear Rainy Day activities and Castle Creator.  <br/>
After they ate they played computer games for quite awhile.  <br/>
<br/>
Luke asked me to play Presto Chango with him and Alisha joined in but <br/>
didn&#39;t finish the game because her friend asked her to play Mario <br/>
Party with her.  Luke lost interest too and asked to go outside.  We <br/>
played with sidewalk chalk, cleaned the windows with glass cleaner, <br/>
and (his idea) tried to chip away at the piles of icy snow on the <br/>
sidewalk.  <br/>
<br/>
Then Alisha and her friend came out and tried to go sledding in the <br/>
yard, but there&#39;s no snow left, only ice, and it was too uneven and <br/>
hard to go down smoothly.  They got some tools and tried to chip away <br/>
at the ice to make it ok for sleds but gave up on that pretty <br/>
quickly.  <br/>
<br/>
Then they asked me to take them to a store for candy.  They were <br/>
going to have some kind of club house or something and needed candy <br/>
for it for something.  I took Alisha, Luke, and one of the friends to <br/>
the store.  Matt (5) and the other friend stayed home on the <br/>
computers.  While we were out I asked them what they wanted for <br/>
supper, and they all said, &quot;Bonanza! (steak house with a good salad <br/>
bar)&quot;  So I came back home, picked up the other friend and went to <br/>
Bonanza(Matt and dh decided to stay home--dh doesn&#39;t like Bonanza and <br/>
Matt generally doesn&#39;t choose to leave the house very often)<br/>
<br/>
We got home and the kids were just starting to set up cushions in the <br/>
livingroom to do gymnastics on when the friends&#39; mom came and picked <br/>
them up.  <br/>
<br/>
Dh and I watched the Michael Jackson special while the kids played.  <br/>
I was supposed to be taking Alisha and 3 friends snow tubing tomorrow <br/>
but cancelled (and will reschedule) because we&#39;re supposed to get up <br/>
to 5 inches tomorrow (&#39;d be driving 2 hours in snow).  On top of <br/>
that, the temp is supposed to be a high of 28 but feel like 14, so it <br/>
would be COLD outside!)  So because we&#39;ll be staying home tomorrow <br/>
and because Luke has been having trouble sleeping in his room, the <br/>
kids and I laid out comforters and sleeping bags on the livingroom <br/>
floor to have a special sleepover in the livingroom.  Alisha and I <br/>
played two games of Sorry.  One played the normal way and one where <br/>
we each had two colors at the same time.  Then we popped in a movie <br/>
called No More Baths--It is a great movie so far about kids who were <br/>
inspired by Martin Luther King to protest about an elderly friend <br/>
being forced off of his home.  They protested by getting all the kids <br/>
in town to refuse to take baths.  We were probably 3/4 of the way <br/>
through the movie when Luke fell asleep and the other two asked me to <br/>
turn it off so they could go to sleep.  <br/>
<br/>
After I got everyone drinks and hugs and sang goodnight songs, I <br/>
snuck off to the computer.  It&#39;s 2:40 am and I&#39;m sure tomorrow <br/>
morning I&#39;ll be sorry I stayed up so late!</div>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can you tell me what you did today?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yesterday we played with trains until about noon, then got everyone <br/>
dressed and went to Chuck E. Cheese&#39;s. We went for a drive in the snow, <br/>
then came back home and played with blocks.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Can  you tell me your definition of unschooling?  Do you use any workbook at<br/>
&gt;all or is that what unschooling is all about?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids occasionally play with workbooks, but they&#39;re not limited to <br/>
using them the way the manufacturer had in mind. Occasionally they&#39;ll <br/>
follow the directions on the page, but more often they do something else <br/>
with each page. But they do enjoy them occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Right now my oldest just wants to read his Garfield comic books or watch TV<br/>
&gt;or listen to the radio or play on the computer or go sledding.  ANYTHING,<br/>
&gt;but &quot;school&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>THAT is what we do! Anything BUT school! We play, and live joyously <br/>
(except this week, when I&#39;ve been sick and not so joyous). I got a new <br/>
parka and hood so I can take my kids sledding, but now that we have snow <br/>
again, I&#39;m too sick to take them.    :-(   Bleah!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So I thought, well maybe he&#39;s stressed by the workbooks, so we<br/>
&gt;cut some out of our day.  No change in him.  Sometimes I think he&#39;s just<br/>
&gt;taking this being home thing for granted and needs a dose of what it could<br/>
&gt;be like!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone have any tips?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, take the rest of the year off and have fun. Watch movies. Read <br/>
your son&#39;s comics. Go sledding. Take turns playing on the computer. Do <br/>
fun stuff--ANYTHING but schooly stuff.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671292030">Well, I just wrote what we have been up to lately to another list and I<br/>
thought I would share it here too.  <br/>
<br/>
My girls are 6 and 8.  My 6 yo is a an incredible story teller.  I just got<br/>
her a cassette deck so she can tape her stories and I can type them at my<br/>
leisure.  Some days she will dictate for 3 hours straight and it is very<br/>
hard on my brain and my hands trying to keep up with her talking.  :0) The<br/>
first day I got the tape deck, I had only 1 90 minute tape for her to use<br/>
and she filled it that evening with 3 stories.  Some of her books are 10<br/>
chapters long and she hopes to publish them one day.  :0)  Some days she<br/>
will write her stories by hand and they are wonderful, but not as long and<br/>
complicated as the stories she dictates because she can go much faster.  <br/>
<br/>
Both girls enjoy playing hangman lately.  We can always find paper and a pen<br/>
in my purse and play while we are waiting in waiting rooms or whatever.  We<br/>
have been doing words in certain categories, like horse related words.<br/>
Speaking of which, both girls are now taking horse back riding lessons and<br/>
are enjoying it very much.  <br/>
<br/>
Our recent favorite read alouds are by Bruce Coville books, esp. the Unicorn<br/>
Chronicles and the Magic Shop books.  We are also enjoying Lemony Snicket&#39;s<br/>
books in the series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; tremendously.  They are<br/>
wonderful books and they leave you hanging at the end of every chapter.  <br/>
<br/>
My 8 yo has been enjoying playing a dice game where we take turns and roll a<br/>
twenty sided die and add up the the rolls for our score.  The first one to<br/>
200 or 300 wins. We have also been playing it as a subtraction game starting<br/>
at 300 and subtracting.  The first one to get to zero wins.  We got the<br/>
polyhedral dice for Christmas and she loves it. (which really surprised me!)<br/>
She has learned how to borrow and carry when adding on paper and actually<br/>
likes it.  :0)  The is amazing from my kids who hate work books and stuff<br/>
like that. <br/>
<br/>
We still love playing all sorts of games and lately the ones we play the<br/>
most are Presto Change-o, PayDay, and Life.  We also got Blink and Quiddler<br/>
for Christmas and have been enjoying those periodically, as well as<br/>
Zoombinis for the computer.  The kids are pretty sick of the computer games<br/>
we have.  They loved computer games until they got too school-ish.  Both<br/>
like<br/>
to play Need for Speed though. (whoops!  it is Midtown Madness, not need for<br/>
speed)<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, we go to the pool regularly as the girls and I love to swim.  We are<br/>
getting tired of the cold and snow, but have done some skiing and<br/>
snowshoeing as well as sliding this winter.  We have also watched quite a<br/>
few movies...Just watched &quot;Walking With Prehistoric Beasts&quot; today.  That was<br/>
pretty cool.  <br/>
<br/>

&gt; How did you assure him?  <br/>
&gt; Would letting him measure them have been out of the question?<br/>
&gt; Could he do it at a distance somehow?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, he measured and cut out all of the smaller planets, except <br/>
Mercury. He wanted Mercury to be brown, and we didn&#39;t have any brown <br/>
construction paper, so he got all the other small planets measured <br/>
and put in an envelope, and then took off to do something else. When <br/>
I got to it, I colored a piece of white paper, with a brown marker, <br/>
and cut Mercury out of that. He didn&#39;t get to measure Mercury, you <br/>
see. <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, &quot;I assured him it was&quot; means, we took a look at both <br/>
planets, and Robby could see with the naked eye LOL the difference in <br/>
size. Pluto actually is a hole punch circle from black paper. If he&#39;d <br/>
needed to, we could have put a chair under the planets and measured <br/>
them with a ruler, but he was satisfied.<br/>

&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know what? I&#39;m discovering the lack of passion and vision in my <br/>
own life. MOst certainly, I am laid back and not driven, so I&#39;m not <br/>
going to go for it as intensely as a more choleric type...but &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t know what I want to be when I grow up&quot;, you know? Starting at <br/>
age 15, I haven&#39;t known what I wanted to do with my life, and I&#39;ve <br/>
sort of drifted, like a piece of bleached wood in the surf. My life <br/>
is good, don&#39;t get me wrong, but I feel really unproductive, more a <br/>
consumer than a producer, and I don&#39;t like it. And I don&#39;t want my <br/>
kids&#39; innate desire to live quelched by unnatural, inhuman methods. I <br/>
don&#39;t want them to think they have to play the game or jump through <br/>
the hoops in order to have a terrific life. <br/>
<br/>
Gatto has helped me so much, to see that the very methodology in use <br/>
for &quot;schooling&quot; today, is inappropriate. I&#39;m finding connections <br/>
between him and my favorite (conservative) Christian educator/authors <br/>
that just bring tears to my eyes. It&#39;s like, finding the connecting <br/>
ideas between authors of The Great Books: &quot;Yeah! I&#39;ve read this <br/>
somewhere else! He is clarifying this point, made in that book by <br/>
that author, by coming at the same idea from a different angle. But <br/>
it&#39;s the SAME IDEA!&quot; That is very exciting. We are starting to pick <br/>
up on &quot;how the Cranes are going to do it&quot;. I&#39;m not wringing my hands, <br/>
wondering if we&#39;re doing it right; I&#39;m searching and finding OUR way <br/>
of doing it.<br/>
