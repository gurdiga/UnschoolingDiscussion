<div id="ygrps-yiv-649889580">Hello,<br/>
To the gal with the Laundry Soap reciepe, could you answer these questions?<br/>
I have a friend that is interested with these questions.<br/>
E-Mail me personally, in the Subject Line put  ----------Linda<br/>
<br/>
   Can you ask her if the laundry detergent gels, does she just scoop<br/>
a cup of gel and use that in her laundry, or what.  How much does it<br/>
take?  How does she store it all?   has she tried freezing it?</div>
