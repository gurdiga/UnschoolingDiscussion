<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746336621">Hello All!  I have been totally unable to keep up with the outrageous amount <br/>
of postings on this list, but I did catch the last few and feel a need to <br/>
talk.<br/>
<br/>
Being raised as many of us were, in a box, being fed predigested information, <br/>
it is hard for us to not try to define the undefinable.  We cannot define our <br/>
children, or unschooling, we can only facilitate (liking that word a bunch) <br/>
our children&#39;s growing and learning and our own growing and learning.  Formal <br/>
stuff comes in when it needs to, relaxing happens as it needs to.  It all <br/>
happens as it needs to, in due time.  Perfection has not been met yet by us <br/>
earthlings and there is no such thing as absolute or total when it comes to <br/>
our chosen way of raising our children.  We will all make mistakes, we will <br/>
all make changes, we will contstantly grow and learn ourselves.  And we will <br/>
indeed continue to waste our time trying to define the undefinable.<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s join hands, closing our mouths, and opening our hearts to what each <br/>
of us, every one of us, has chosen as a way of life.  Take comfort in our <br/>
similar beliefs and feel secure that we are in a place where we are truly <br/>
understood and left unjudged by each other.  We all share a connection here <br/>
that unfortunately, so many other parents are missing out on.  We all feel <br/>
it, we all take great comfort in it.  Finally, someone understands how we <br/>
think and feel, and we are safe here.  Some of us have journeyed so far to <br/>
get here.  And so many us need reassurance and encouragement to maintain our <br/>
stronghold on the undefined, yet completely natural, path we have chosen.  <br/>
Some of us have a new feeling of freedom, and are not sure how to take that <br/>
leap off of the cliff just yet and are here to get a much needed push.<br/>
<br/>
Wherever each one of us are on our journey... let&#39;s not let go of each <br/>
others&#39; hands.  Let&#39;s not section off, or correct each others&#39; words (how <br/>
humiliating and &quot;school-like&quot;).  Let&#39;s continue to embrace each other with <br/>
all of our faults and attributes in tow.  Let&#39;s keep our minds open to what <br/>
each other is experiencing and living and learning.  Something we have been <br/>
wishing and hoping for from our own families, communities, and government, <br/>
yet we have been guilty of doing it to own &quot;community&quot; here on this list, is <br/>
not keeping our minds open and our mouths shut.  let us resolve to encourage <br/>
and build up our fellow unschoolers, and school at homers, and classic <br/>
homeschoolers, and ecclectic homeschoolers, and religous homeschoolers, and <br/>
prepackaged cirric. homeschoolers, and... well ,you get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this forum is for those of us who learn outside of the box.  But think <br/>
about it for a minute ... the inside of the box is really small and confined, <br/>
easily definable isn&#39;t it?  But what about the universe outside of the box... <br/>
you can&#39;t measure it, you can&#39;t categorize it, you can&#39;t define it!!!!!!!!!  <br/>
it is too expansive and awesome even for us to comprehend.  We have stepped <br/>
out here and found a beautiful world in which we all have room to learn, grow <br/>
and live.  We must become content to just &quot;be&quot; here and not waste time trying <br/>
to figure out what &quot;here&quot; is.  Enjoy, embrace, love, live this wonderful life <br/>
you have chosen for you and your children.  Isn&#39;t it beautiful?<br/>
<br/>
A neighbor and I were talking about my garden.  She asked if I was ever just <br/>
going to sit and enjoy it?  Or am I always going to keep working, working, <br/>
and working in it?  So caught up in its development, that I couldn&#39;t find <br/>
time to sit and enjoy it for what it was.  Something for all of you to think <br/>
about today ........<br/>
<br/>
I am giving all of you a big hug... old, new, unsure, insecure, all of you in <br/>
your undefinable glory.  I am blessed to have your hands to hold and your <br/>
encouragement to continue my journey outside of the box (no matter how scary <br/>
it is).<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Kim in Ohio</div>

Kim,<br/>
This is exactly what I was feeling from this list before the letters began to <br/>
say that we shouldn&#39;t do this and we shouldn&#39;t do that.  The list was so free <br/>
and flowing, there were so many posts because so many people were excited to <br/>
find a place where they could share.  My gosh, people were actually inviting <br/>
others to come to their homes and stay if they were coming to see some <br/>
historical reenactments, or what ever.  This was so neat, I wanted to know <br/>
more and be a part of this.  Sandra told me to go to AOL and chat, come back <br/>
later and I would find a better list.  I don&#39;t understand how you can learn <br/>
if you can&#39;t discuss and yes, gasp! chat with each other, that&#39;s support.  <br/>
Now what I find on this list is people who are new to just plain old <br/>
Homeschooling, and interested in unschooling, but don&#39;t know how they can <br/>
apply it, afraid to ask and apologizing for what they might have said that <br/>
might have been wrong.  People say they want child led learning, well, <br/>
children learn by asking questions and if rebuffed, or told to go elsewhere <br/>
and come back later,  they learn not to ask, So to with adults.  We should <br/>
all be able to learn and share, no matter what style we use, and yes, it is a <br/>
compliment that others want to know what you use.  For everyone, you take the <br/>
best of everything and use what is right for your family.  That IS a <br/>
lifestyle. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Teresa, I am one of those children who was tuaght not to question. SO there<br/>
are alot of things that i do not feel i know. Now that I am more secure in<br/>
myself I have learned to ask questions. I may stop asking them here if they<br/>
are unwelcome but i will ask them and i will find what is best for me. I<br/>
agree that asking those questions is important to me on that journey i call<br/>
life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>it is also hard for us to change our way of thinking. some of us are trying<br/>
hard to do that and some have been able to. I know I can use some help in<br/>
changing my thinking and learning about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping that this list would be for those of us learning too and<br/>
needing help.<br/>

no one to follow. I must find the way on my own. but the guidence and<br/>
advice and stories of otehrs would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
