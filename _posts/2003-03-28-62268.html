<div id="ygrps-yiv-933277329">It has happened again. My son has again humbled me with his ability to do <br/>
what he needs to do. Two years ago we bought him a new mountain bike. He is <br/>
seven years old now, and only 2 inches short of 5 feet tall, about 150 pds. <br/>
No small fry! He was terrified of this bike when we got it, cried, fell, and <br/>
I got mad at him for being scared, tried to bully him into riding it, and <br/>
then we put it away and got him a large wheeled scooter for our rural roads. <br/>
Last year we dragged the bike out again, and he cried again and was scared, <br/>
and I got mad, tried bullying again, then we put it away again. <br/>
Yesterday, Tommy wanted to try his bike again. I groaned inwardly, but agreed <br/>
to help.<br/>
We took out the bike. Much crying and screaming, he said he was so scared, <br/>
but really wanted to try it . He screamed, bellowed, and hollered. Big kid, <br/>
big voice!!!<br/>
I simply listened, said I understood how conflicted he must be, said he <br/>
didn&#39;t have to . The crying continued. I waited, then quietly said I <br/>
understood, but would he please either get on or put it away, as the yelling <br/>
was getting to be a bit much! <br/>
Tommy  stopped yelling, got on the bike, and rode it!! He rode it and rode it <br/>
and rode it some more. He then informed me he would sleep better because he <br/>
would not dream that he would never ride a bike anymore.<br/>
Everything that I despair of  him doing he does when HE is ready. I will try <br/>
to never push him again. I hope I don&#39;t go to hell for all the mistakes I <br/>
have made with this child. I hope he speaks to me when he is older. <br/>
I felt the need to share this story . It simply amazes me over and over  when <br/>
this happens.<br/>

and put it away for over a year. He also just got on and rode away when he <br/>

through and overcome a fear like that. Conor did that with the diving board <br/>
years ago. He forced himself to just try it because he said that otherwise <br/>
he would have just worried about trying it all summer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for sharing that Nancy.<br/>
As a home-educator it took me a long time and a difficult journey towards unschooling to realise that my kids would do stuff *when* they are ready and all coercian does is create bad feelings.<br/>
My youngest is nearly 8 but is convinced he&#39;ll never ride a bike. He&#39;s small (about 40 pounds) so is still using a little tiny bike with training wheels but he cries over the fact that other kids might<br/>
laugh at him cos he can&#39;t ride a &#39;proper&#39; bike :-(<br/>
We have tried many times but he just can&#39;t get the balance. Even with the saddle so low his can put his feet flat on the ground. He sort of crouches on the saddle with all his weight to one side which<br/>
means he is unstable. It usually ends up with him kicking the bike and storming off home (red-head temper!)<br/>
I&#39;m trying to persuade him to sit behind me on my bike so he can feel how a bike moves and balances but its a no-no at the moment.<br/>
The bike he has is a hand-me-down Toys R Us peice of rubbish (in my opinion....) so I&#39;m tempted to buy him a nice bike from the bike shop. Hubby says no, kids that size don&#39;t need &#39;proper&#39; bikes. I did<br/>
look round the other day but they had nothing small enough apart from those girly pink and white tricycles with ribbons on the handlebars (yuck).<br/>

of us are.  Most people wouldn&#39;t even think you did anything wrong, so just<br/>
realizing it is a big step.  And telling about it can maybe help someone<br/>

We found with the scooter that Tommy used, he had speed, was able to learn <br/>
balance in a way that was not threatening to him, and could try jumps etc. <br/>
The scooter has large rubber tires, so can go on thesame terrain as a <br/>
bicycle. Great confidence builder.<br/>
It is soooo hard to watch them struggle with this, or any other thing they <br/>

<br/>
Conor took the training wheels off his bike and just sat there on it with <br/>
his feet touching the ground. He just sat there and bounced from left to <br/>
right off of each foot getting the feel of it. He spent some time just <br/>
getting from place to place by pushing off with both feet and not worrying <br/>
at all about the pedals. I think that&#39;s what helped him figure out his <br/>
balance point.<br/>

Do you have kids trailerbikes available? We bought one (Burley <br/>
Piccolo) when our son was 4 and too big to be in the trailer with his <br/>
sister anymore. So he pedaled behind me on that for a year or more <br/>
before trying his hand at two-wheeled balancing. I think it helps <br/>
give them a feel for it, and it&#39;s totally stable. Around here, you <br/>
can rent them in bike stores for the afternoon.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We got a nice Trek bike for our son after he learned to ride without <br/>
training wheels (he was almost 6). It&#39;s a terrific *real* bike, with <br/>
good hand brakes and 6 gears. I think it&#39;s great for kids to have a <br/>
real quality bike if they&#39;re going to be riding it a lot. He has <br/>
ridden up to 8 miles on it on his own steam, so I&#39;m glad we invested <br/>
and got him a good one. Plus, I have to say I really believe in <br/>
supporting small bike stores and not the Toys R Us type places, if <br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
What helped him best in learning to ride a 2-wheeler is that we <br/>
borrowed a bike without training wheels that a friend had outgrown <br/>
and just kept it in the garage. We told him he could ride it or sit <br/>
on it if he wanted to, but he still had his regular bike with the <br/>
training wheels on to ride whenever he wanted to. I think it really <br/>
helps to take the pressure off of removing the training wheels. Then <br/>
you either ride it, or you have to put the darned things back on. <br/>
This gave him all kinds of options.<br/>
<br/>
At first, he wasn&#39;t too interested in that bike. But one day he just <br/>
got on it and glided a few inches. Then a few inches more. A few days <br/>
later he could glide across the entire garage. I casually mentioned <br/>
that we could take it to the park if he wanted to go further. He did. <br/>
We took it and he glided some more. Then I did the run along behind <br/>
him and hold onto the seat thing until he got the balance down, and <br/>
he took off riding that day. Fortunately, a friend of mine was at the <br/>
park and captured it all on video. That week we took him to pick out <br/>
his new bike at the bike store. The next week, he asked to ride it to <br/>
the toy store to buy some Legos, it was a 6 mile round trip. He made <br/>
it with no problem! I think riding the trailerbike for two years <br/>
ahead of time gave him a lot of stamina for longer rides.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I liked just having a bike around with no training <br/>
wheels without having to take the wheels off of the bike he was  <br/>
already comfortable on. It definitely removes all the pressure and <br/>
leaves the ball in their court.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-560646890">Do you have kids trailerbikes available? <br/>
 <br/>
We just got a trailer bike yesterday.  What a blast!!  The kids really<br/>
love it that they can ride with me and not worry about falling over and<br/>
I really love having someone on my rides with me without worrying about<br/>
them getting run over.  My 8 yo is just getting her balance on a two<br/>
wheeled bike and it&#39;s been a long frustrating haul for both of us.  She<br/>
has really wanted to be able to ride, but was really scared about<br/>
falling.  Her feet can finally reach the ground and that has been really<br/>
helpful.  Both my girls are tiny (38 and 40 lbs) and learning to ride<br/>
was even more difficult because the smallest bikes we could buy were<br/>
still to big.  And, they are just not extremely physical kids. Anyway,<br/>
if you like to ride and your kids aren&#39;t too heavy, I really recommend a<br/>
trailerbike.  Ours is an Adams, which I think was the original one.<br/>
