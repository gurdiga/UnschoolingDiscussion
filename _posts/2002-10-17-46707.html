<div id="ygrps-yiv-334081947">I have broken my leg again.  The last time was in July, 1985, so breaking it <br/>
again October 11th 2002 isn&#39;t TOO frequent, I guess.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well it is too frequent because it inconveniences a lot of people and puts <br/>
much of our everyday lives at a standstill.  Keith was saintly the first time <br/>
and we didnâ€™t have any children yet.  This time the kids will get much of the <br/>
workload, with Keith still being saintly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The big inconvenience this time was I was in South Carolina to speak at a <br/>
homeschooling conference, and I was on my way to the opening remarks and <br/>
intro, after which I was doing a keynote speech.  I had a talk and a workshop <br/>
scheduled for Saturday, a workshop for Sunday and the farewell address.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Between the second floors of the two buildings in the hotel was a ramp.  Too <br/>
steep, too slippery, some kind of indoor/outdoor carpet on it, and I went <br/>
down.  This wasn&#39;t the foot I sprained a month ago, but the other one, the <br/>
left one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marty was not far behind me, several people were on the little patio at the <br/>
end of the ramp. Paramedics came.  Nice women, smart, friendly, but they had <br/>
a gurney that only cranked down to about 18&quot; off the ground.  I was afraid to <br/>
stand up on the lately-sprained left foot, ON that ramp, still slippery, so <br/>
they got firemen to put me on the gurney.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My first ambulance ride!  One of the homeschooling moms, Kathryn, went with <br/>
me.  They took me  to a VERY near hospital, a mile or less up the road, <br/>
Palmetto Baptist.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I spent several hours in a little closed room in the emergency area, hoping I <br/>
could have surgery that evening.  It seemed possible, but didn&#39;t happen.  <br/>
X-rays showed breaks just above the ankle on both bones.  (Not nearly as bad <br/>
as the 1985 breaks.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was not happy thatI was going to miss the first alternative homeschooling <br/>
conference in the southeastern U.S., and I felt horrible for letting people <br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Surgery was noon Saturday and I hoped that I could leave the next afternoon <br/>
in a wheelchair to at least do the closing speech, or that maybe the hotel <br/>
could bring conference people in a bus to some big room at the hospital or <br/>
SOMETHING, but on Sunday I was sick from post-op this&#39;n&#39;that, and throwing <br/>
up.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had a dozen visitors, all of whom assured me that although I was missed, <br/>
the conference was wonderful and people were meeting others and learning a <br/>
ton.  That was good to hear, but also sad because I wasn&#39;t getting to meet <br/>
everyone, and the morphine drip was keeping me from being equally alert at <br/>
all times.  I was zoning out, but it was keeping the pain down.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marty sat in on the panel discussion in my place, and seemed really happy <br/>
about having done so.  He made a good impression on lots of people there.  I <br/>
heard reports about how good he was at helping the younger kids with games, <br/>
that he seemed more mature than they expected of a thirteen year old, and <br/>
that he was handling the stress very well.  I was grateful to people for <br/>
bringing him to see me in the hospital, and we talked on the phone some too. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because of this accident , the hotel will make concessions for next year&#39;s <br/>
conference, I hope, and the room Marty and I had, he stayed in free for four <br/>
nights.   Anne Ohman was right next door to Marty and Joyce Fetteroll past <br/>
that.  Mary Gold was down a couple of floors.  They all helped Marty out on <br/>
the weekend, and Anne and Joyce had video-game-playing kids with them, and so <br/>
there was some good interaction about that, some sight-seeing, some trips to <br/>
good kid-food places (since they had a van).    So IF they fix that ramp and <br/>
are as  helpful to Kelly Lovejoy, our hostess and organizer, as they need to <br/>
be, we&#39;ll try again next year.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly, thank you for ALL your help, and the ride to the airport.  Even though <br/>
it wasn&#39;t &quot;a good weekend&quot; for me, I had a great time being with you and your <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We flew home as scheduled, with me being carried up the steps in a special <br/>
chair to the Canadair jet, and down (flight to Cincinnatti) and then helped <br/>
into a first class seat on the 737 for the rest of the flight home.  My foot <br/>
didn&#39;t hurt as much as I had been afraid it would, I didn&#39;t get woozy, and I <br/>
didn&#39;t need to try to use an airplane bathroom, so my fears were happily <br/>
<br/>
unmet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of the four flat levels of the house, I&#39;ve been stationed in the den so I can <br/>
get to &quot;the cat bathroom&quot; and the office, but the first night home I was in <br/>
my OWN bed, next to Keith, and that was good.  It was dark and quiet and the <br/>
mattress and pillow weren&#39;t plastic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll probably end up deleting some of the yahoogroups mail because it&#39;s quite <br/>
piled up.  It might take me a bit to get through all the personal mail too, <br/>
but I figured one report on this to everyone would keep me from having to <br/>
retell it (because it hurts my leg and my feelings every time I tell it) and <br/>
it will give people a heads up on why I might be flakey or a no-show in the <br/>
next few weeks.  (Kathy, we need to reschedule that lunch; Helena, I can&#39;t do <br/>
a Jasmine pick-up or delivery as I should have; Jeff and Mike, music practice <br/>
will need to be here or not at all for a while, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No weight on it for six weeks is what they told me in South Carolina.  I <br/>
guess maybe that means after six weeks I can get a walking cast, but I don&#39;t <br/>
know.  I guess I&#39;ll see a Lovelace ortho-guy next week to see x-rays and get <br/>
a preview of my coming weeks.  They put pins in one bone and a plate and pins <br/>
in the other.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m not happy, but I&#39;m safe at home and will try not to bring down the <br/>
happiness of those around me.  I can only sit up a while at a time now.  I <br/>
have a wheelchair and a walker.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When some of the photos of me are available, I&#39;ll put them on a website so <br/>
you can see me downed on the ground, and in the hospital if you want more of <br/>
the full effect.   I&#39;ve been to South Carolina twice now, and been in the <br/>
hospital both times (well, the first time my parents were living in Aiken and <br/>
went across the border to Augusta, Georgia, for my birth, so maybe that <br/>
doesn&#39;t count).   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really sorry for the inconveniences this will cause in the coming weeks.  <br/>
I have movies to watch and books to read and kids to hang out with, and I&#39;ll <br/>
be able to sit at the computer longer as time goes on, so I&#39;m not lonely in a <br/>
quiet home alone at all!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All o&#39;ya&#39;ll be careful walking on wet ramps.  (Add that to your list of <br/>
things to watch out for.)<br/>

I&#39;m glad to hear you&#39;re doing better. This will make one of those <br/>
great conference stories to tell later in life. Wasn&#39;t it ironic that <br/>
your keynote speech was to be &quot;Moving a Puddle&quot; and wet carpeting at <br/>
the end of a ramp with a puddle of water was what did you in. If only <br/>
that puddle had been moved the day before so the carpet could have <br/>
been dry by conference time!<br/>
<br/>
Although I&#39;ve never broken a leg, I completely tore my Achilles <br/>
tendon this past year and had to have surgery to re-attach the ends, <br/>
so I can sympathize with being laid up for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
You were missed at the conference, but I think it is a testament to <br/>
Kelly Lovejoy who organized it, all her helpers, and the great <br/>
unschooling attendees who made the conference a big success despite <br/>
possibly the worst set-back a conference organizer could imagine!<br/>
<br/>
Heal quickly!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Even when I was downed, my foot wasn&#39;t in the puddle.  It wasn&#39;t the puddle <br/>
that did it.  There was water dripping off the roof at the top of the ramp, <br/>
and instead of having skidproof surface, the VERY steep ramp had <br/>
indoor/outdoor carpetting.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll replace it soon.<br/>
