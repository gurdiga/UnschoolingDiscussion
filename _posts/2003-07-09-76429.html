But I think that it would be strange, Blue may work as that is the color of the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We won&#39;t be visible to our neighbors (I love that) The purple is going to be <br/>
a deep purple stain, like a pickle. (Not an eating pickle but a pickling <br/>
stain.)<br/>
Purple is also my favorite color.<br/>
