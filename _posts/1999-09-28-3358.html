&lt;&lt;  She is always worried about calling things to their <br/>
 attention (like lack of child support and harrassment), she is afraid that <br/>
 they will get tired of hearing from her and condemn her for it instead of <br/>
her <br/>
 husband.<br/>
 I will pass on the things that you told me.  Thank you for all your help and <br/>
 I will let you know how it goes.<br/>

(I changed the sub line, LOL) Just keep telling her that Friend of the Court <br/>
has NO IDEA of what is going on without her persistence. I am now (as of last <br/>
night) dealing with a my youngest&#39;s mother. That sounds funny, but my dh had <br/>
a child previous to us, and we went thru FOC to take mother&#39;s rights away. <br/>
After everything was said and done, she just no showed. It has been 2 years, <br/>
and we can officially get her on abandonment. Well, she showed up here <br/>
yesterday, wanting to take the child for a visit! YE GADS. WE denied her.<br/>
Back to your friend...Just keep pressing, make sure that FOC (who are only <br/>
mediators) know what is up, and only give him as little as possible. FOC will <br/>
hit her with trust, and I know that she does not trust him. <br/>
You are always welcome to my help, and I am here for you- even if it is to <br/>
vent...<br/>

     I will do that.  I have passed the other messages on to my friend.  She <br/>
was surprised at some of the things you suggested.  I will continue to do so. <br/>
 Thanks for your help, I will keep you posted.<br/>
