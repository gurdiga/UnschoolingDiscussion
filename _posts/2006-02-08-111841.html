<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712779929">I have e-mail this morning from two of the French unschooling writers  <br/>
who can also read and write English.  I&#39;m really glad for their  <br/>
ability and presence, because they can channel some of what&#39;s being  <br/>
written in English into the radical parenting community in France.<br/>
<br/>
Sylvie has posted on this list in times past, and looks like this:  <br/>
Sylvie Martin/<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eliott2@...">eliott2@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Sylvie has written an article on her journey from snobbishly  <br/>
disallowing TV and taking pride in the fact that her family didn&#39;t  <br/>
watch it, to trying things because of discussions on this list (!)  <br/>
and describes what she learns all in one place, and elegantly.     <br/>
I&#39;ve asked her to translate it into English, and she&#39;s working on that.<br/>
<br/>
Here is something from our e-mail exchange yesterday, and she&#39;s given  <br/>
me permission to just post it directly:<br/>
<br/>
-=-When I will have time, I will write a mail for the unschooling  <br/>
lists, to say how wonderful is our life with unschooling. Our  <br/>
children are so... I can&#39;t find a word to explain... I remember when  <br/>
I wrote on &quot;Always learning&quot; about tv, and about Tom who will watch  <br/>
it all the day, with no end if I let him do it.. And some of you told  <br/>
me &quot;How do you know ? Did you try ?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Yes, now, we tried, and it&#39;s so wonderful, how my children seem to  <br/>
feel &quot;free&quot;... I&#39;m not judging anymore, I&#39;m not scared anymore ...  <br/>
It&#39;s because of you.. I beggan to trust what you said, you, Sandre,  <br/>
and lot of women on those lists, I think I felt inside it was &quot;true&quot;,  <br/>
but I could&#39;nt really believe it.. And trusting you made me trusting  <br/>
my children. A trust I didn&#39;t have before, or it was well hidden :-))-=-<br/>
<br/>
=========================<br/>
<br/>
She said she&#39;s getting grief from some of the other parents there who  <br/>
don&#39;t want to consider that TV limits are unnecessary.  They don&#39;t  <br/>
like that she&#39;s described that as controlling.   (Sounds familiar,  <br/>
right?)<br/>
<br/>
If any of you read French or know people who read French who could  <br/>
benefit from knowing their site is there, and easy address to  <br/>
remember is<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/french">http://sandradodd.com/french</a><br/>
<br/>
Once you get in there, the links lead to other links.<br/>
<br/>
Another of the moms writing there is Jeanine Barb√©, who wrote (this  <br/>
morning, and their site address is included in that):<br/>
==============<br/>
Sandra dear,<br/>
<br/>
I am very confused, I don&#39;t remember whether I sent you an email or not,<br/>
to tell you that I&#39;ve translated &quot;moving a puddle&quot; and &quot;balancing in the<br/>
middle ground&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been talking with Sylvie about... an article on<br/>
unschoolingdiscussion...and It just hit in my head!! Did I sent an email<br/>
to Sandra?? Did I?? I guess no but I should and had the strong intention<br/>
to do so :-)<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I LOVE your articles!<br/>
<br/>
And also, I am surviving a pc crash lol and lost a lot of emails!!<br/>
Anyway, since December, I just can&#39;t follow the many yahoolists I used<br/>
to read regularly!!<br/>
<br/>
Please receive my apologises and my very best wishes for this year!!<br/>
Thank you for you support, and the kind of spicy joy you share through<br/>
your articles and email!!!<br/>
<br/>
Gros bisous<br/>
Jeanine<br/>

No, she hadn&#39;t told me; neither had Sylvie, but I discovered them on  <br/>
my own lately, looking for a URL, and it was a cool surprise!<br/>
