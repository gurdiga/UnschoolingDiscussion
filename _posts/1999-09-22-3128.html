&gt; i found the key that does cents on my macintosh just because you asked, and i<br/>
&gt; had been wondering myself!  even though i thought it would be ambiguous to<br/>
&gt; find in the manual, there it was under keyboard-- ha!<br/>
&gt; i just push option and 4 together to get it, drumroll please....<br/>
&gt; 2�!!!!  AND i can also do this:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124477325">There is no &quot;option&quot; key on PC keyboards. Hold the &quot;alt&quot; key, then press<br/>
0162 on the numeric keypad, release the &quot;alt&quot; key and you will get this: �<br/>
<br/>
Even easier, if you open the &quot;system tools&quot; folder (under &quot;programs,<br/>
accessories in win95/98) you will see an icon for &quot;Character Map.&quot; It will<br/>
let you easily view and select the printable characters for any font. You<br/>
can also run C:&#92;WINDOWS&#92;CHARMAP.EXE if you can&#39;t find the icon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943648246">woops!  so much for showing off my new keyboard savvy!!  for some reason it <br/>
doesn&#39;t translate at all!  i really did find an impressive array of symbols <br/>
including the cents sign!!!!  oh well, hope you can find it on your keyboard <br/>
anyway...  <br/>
