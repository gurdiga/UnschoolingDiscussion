<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820380564">Mary: One thing Kalie gets a LOT of is one-on-one time with me! She&#39;s our <br/>
only child, and I&#39;m home with her, and all day long she helps me with my <br/>
work, and reminds me to play! She sleeps in our room in her own little bed <br/>
(half the night), and the other half in ours (if she wakes and wants to), and <br/>
we do lots of library trips and shopping and playgrounds and just fooling <br/>
around together. I think she gets enough of me!<br/>
<br/>
As far as trying to rile someone up - that is exactly how I would describe <br/>
what she&#39;s doing, and the look on her face when she does it, although I coul<br/>
dn&#39;t have put a name on it until now. It was suggested that she is trying to <br/>
interact with the other child and doesn&#39;t know how, and I think that might be <br/>
valid, too, but I also really like your idea that she&#39;s bored. She is the <br/>
oldest in her playgroup of 4 girls by 6 weeks, and the youngest is 6 months <br/>
younger, which can be a lot at age 3. I&#39;d suggested to my husband that I&#39;d <br/>
like to get her around some older children (girls and boys), because she <br/>
seems more comfortable with the older ones, and also because the older <br/>
children don&#39;t tolerate hitting, etc. as much - the little ones don&#39;t even <br/>
react except to scream. Kalie likes to play games, and she&#39;s used to asking <br/>
questions and having them answered, etc., where the other children still <br/>
aren&#39;t responding to much and don&#39;t &quot;converse&#39; like she does - their language <br/>
is still pretty limited.  (We talk constantly at our house with her- she <br/>
wants to know about everything!) <br/>
<br/>
We also have a different attitude toward children - we repond to Kalie when <br/>
she talks, instead of just ignoring or talking over her like the other <br/>
parents in our group.All the others are in preschool situations, ballet <br/>
classes, etc - not our atttitude at all. They&#39;re all concerned about &quot;messes&quot; <br/>
at their house, too - when Kalie dumps her toys here, they used to actually <br/>
tell her not to, in shocked voices. (It was kind of funny, if it hadn&#39;t been <br/>
so annying. I made it clear dumping is fine with me.) Maybe it&#39;s just time to <br/>
find some older, more appropriate playmates for her! (And we&#39;ve even been <br/>
learning the song, &quot;Make new friends, but keep the old..&quot; this week!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much, Mary. I feel much more hopeful about this situation now, with <br/>
the help everyone has given.<br/>

Well I&#39;ll just throw this question out. Does Kalie get enough attention and <br/>
one on one interaction with just you? I know you said she gets plenty of <br/>
attention but I mean only you and her. I know it&#39;s hard, believe me with my <br/>
4 it&#39;s hard to take the time for just me and one of them but my husband and <br/>
I try very hard to do this often. Even if it&#39;s just a trip to the store.<br/>
<br/>
Also she sounds like she&#39;s just trying to rile someone up. Maybe she&#39;s bored <br/>
and needs more stimulation? I&#39;m just talking out loud so if this isn&#39;t the <br/>
case, disregard!!! Maybe too, she is ahead of playing with her ages. Are <br/>
these kids her same age? I know my Alyssa (2) doesn&#39;t like to play with 2 <br/>
year old stuff and does much better with older kids. Then we she does get <br/>
around younger ones, she has a tendency to play better because it&#39;s <br/>
different. But mostly she doesn&#39;t like to play like most 2 year olds.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337406580">Hi Linda,<br/>
<br/>
I caught that your daughter was an only child a few posts ago. Sorry, I must <br/>
have missed that. And I think Joyce made the remark that maybe she want&#39;s to <br/>
interact but doesn&#39;t know how to go about it. Also when you said that the <br/>
kids aren&#39;t quite as vocal and such as she is, maybe she does want to play <br/>
but just doesn&#39;t get the kind of response she&#39;s looking for. That mixed with <br/>
boredom, again from not getting what she wants can add up to just kicking <br/>
someone out of frustration of it all. I can understand that. Maybe trying <br/>
some older kids would help.<br/>
<br/>
My Sierra happens to get along great with kids her age and older kids too <br/>
but just loves ones a bit younger than her. She has this mother thing she <br/>
does and plays really well with 4 and 5 year olds. My son and youngest <br/>
happen to like older kids more so but still get along great with kids the <br/>
same age or younger. It just seems like a preference they have right now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll figure it out in no time with all the great advice flying <br/>
around here.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know how it goes.<br/>
