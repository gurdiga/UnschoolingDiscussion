<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497551203">Hi folks! I wanted to let you all know that we have an update on the Live and <br/>
Learn Unschooling Conference site.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more info on presenters, a few details on program, and a few <br/>
exhibitors who are confirmed, etc., and now you can register! Go to <br/>
www.LiveandLearnConference.org<br/>
<br/>
The conference is the third Annual Live and Learn Unschooling conference, <br/>
with the first two  having been held in Columbia, SC.  The conference will take <br/>
place at the Peabody Marriott August 27-29, 2004, and will welcome all ages. <br/>
<br/>
Please e-mail me with any questions, but please know I&#39;ll be out of town for <br/>
a few days as my partner&#39;s mom has had a heart attack.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Kathryn Baptista, Conference Coordinator<br/>

The photo of me is taken by Holly and we might send a different one later, <br/>
but my shirt matched the truck and so...<br/>
<br/>
And I hope link can be changed to sandradodd.com/unschooling (please, <br/>
Kathryn) at some point, though this one is second best!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085588024">We&#39;ve had lots of struggles working out things with Paypal, but now we&#39;re all <br/>
set! Because of the struggles some of you had trying to register and pay, <br/>
we&#39;re extending the offer of a free gift at check-in when you register by April 1.<br/>
<br/>
The Live and Learn Unschooling Conference will be held August 27-29 at the <br/>
Marriott Hotel in Peabody, MA. We already have folks registered from California <br/>
to Toronto to South Carolina. Come join us!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962940945">We registered our 50th family for the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference <br/>
today! So far we have over 180 people coming from all over the US and several <br/>
from Canada!<br/>
<br/>
The conference will be held August 27 through 29 at the Marriott Hotel in <br/>
Peabody, Massachusetts, just 15 miles north of Boston. <br/>
<br/>
Speakers will include Sandra Dodd, Anne Ohman, Pam Larricchia, Ben Lovejoy, <br/>
authors Barbara Sher and Valerie Fitzenreiter, FUN Books owner Billy Greer, and <br/>
more. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the Funshops that will be available are Making Fairies, Wire Jewelry, <br/>
Geocaching, Ham Radio, Raising Guide Dog puppies, American Sign Language, <br/>
and, because we&#39;ll be right next door to Salem, Witches. (There&#39;ll be many more!) <br/>
 The Family Resource Center will be bringing in Museum Educators from all <br/>
over the area to do fun things with us throughout the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
There will be a storyteller, Beth Toolan, and a Children&#39;s Music performer, <br/>
Robin Blair. We&#39;ll be holding the world premiere of Stirling, a movie written, <br/>
acted by, and made by homeschooled teens.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE COME! I think the conference is going to be a blast. Deadline for <br/>
Early Bird conference rates is June 1st. The web site should have a big update at <br/>
the beginning of next week. Please pass this along to anyone you think will be <br/>
interested.<br/>
