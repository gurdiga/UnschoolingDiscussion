 Oh,  dear,  then right now  I&#39;m not more interesting than the new Ruby <br/>
version Pokemon game my son is playing. &lt;g&gt;  &lt;sigh&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ha! Trevor just bought that today. We also got Fantasy Star Online and <br/>
WindWaker for Gamecube. It&#39;s going to be a big old video game bonanza today, <br/>
I won&#39;t be more interesting than all that for a few days probably.<br/>
But I guarantee they will do lots of other stuff, swirling in and around the <br/>
games.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
