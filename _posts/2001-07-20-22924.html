<div id="ygrps-yiv-782160524">Hi everyone, I am on digest and I usually respond to<br/>
threads individually and change the subject line<br/>
accordingly.  However I am sick (AGAIN!) and was<br/>
vomiting and feverish yesterday and most of last night<br/>
so I am feeling rather weak and do not have the energy<br/>
to do it this time.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say, Welcome Kathryn!  <br/>
<br/>
Also wanted to comment on the pet thread but I do not<br/>
have the energy to compose my thoughts right now. <br/>
Someting about the fact that I got a kitten when I was<br/>
6 who was sickly and prone to infections and my<br/>
parents never had a thing to do with her.  I had to<br/>
learn how to do all her medical care, drain and clean<br/>
wounds, etc.  Then when I was 11 I began working at<br/>
the zoo for 5 years where I did a damn sight more<br/>
animal care than that, and in a building with about<br/>
100 different animals that were part of the<br/>
educational program (Zoomobile that went to schools,<br/>
churches, etc and a Nature Trail program in the<br/>
summer, etc).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, maybe some kids are just more inclined to take<br/>
on the responsibilty, or maybe some are just more able<br/>
to commit to things long term.  Or maybe it was just<br/>
part of my dysfunctionality that allowed me to do it,<br/>
since I was the caretaker in my alcoholic/dysfuntional<br/>
home and collected all sorts of &quot;strays&quot; in my own<br/>
species when I got older.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this doesn&#39;t make much sense, but I am out of<br/>
energy now and that is about all you are giong to get.<br/>
 I am going back to be.<br/>
<br/>
