If you put goldfish in they will eat the mosquito larvae. . and you never <br/>
have to feed the fish. . .you can but you don&#39;t have to. The slime takes a <br/>
bit more. . .plants can help and of course, there are lots of other products. <br/>
. but I had a beautiful crystal waterfall with pond deep in the South. My <br/>
challenge now is I am in the Northeast and dont know about the winters and <br/>
ponds :)<br/>

That&#39;s so cool! As I slid across the pond last winter I thought it would<br/>
be great to put a pair of skates on, but ours is only 8 x 15 and not<br/>
worth the effort. By the time you start you&#39;d have to turn around and<br/>
come back. <br/>

&gt; about the winters and <br/>
&gt; ponds :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>We live in NJ and if I had it to do over again I&#39;d go<br/>
at least 3 feet so the fish can winter over. Some<br/>
years ours make it (and we&#39;re only about 12&quot; - 18&quot; we<br/>
didn&#39;t measure, I&#39;m guessing) At one time my husband<br/>
was really into this and we use to move the Koi into<br/>
plastic horse troughs in the greenhouse for the<br/>
winter. Well, he had invested literally thousands of<br/>
dollars in Koi - and we had a *sudden* early cold snap<br/>
and lost them all!  Since then we stick to gold fish<br/>
and shiners and the like (when my oldest dd were<br/>
younger they use to go cray fishing at the creek down<br/>
the road and release the cray fish in the pond. One<br/>
time we saw a neighbor boy going up the road with a<br/>
string of fish,one was a beautiful sunny and the gills<br/>
were still moving. We ask him if he&#39;d release it in<br/>
the pond, he did, and thanks to mild winters it lived<br/>
a few years!) Even at 3&#39; it would be best to have an<br/>
aerator though - but if you have an aerator it won&#39;t<br/>
freeze completely so the kids can&#39;t skate (our<br/>
original purpose.) The funniest thing to me is when<br/>
the pond first gets a thin sheet of ice on it and the<br/>
fish are still swimming (when it really freezes they<br/>
go into a sort of suspended animation) and the cat can<br/>
see them under the ice and chases them around batting<br/>
at the surface of the ice!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637445133">If there is too much algae the turtles get soft shell disease.  A filtration<br/>
system is best with turtles because they, shall we say, &quot;add&quot; so much to the<br/>
water.  If you are going to have fish in the same pond, you need lots of<br/>
vegetation because the turtles eat the fish.<br/>
<br/>
Chemical algae remover harms the turtles, airation (hmmm, that doesn&#39;t look<br/>
right, oh well, call the spelling police &lt;g&gt;) helps and when you cement<br/>
having smooth &quot;walls&quot; so you can clean them helps.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always put a double filtration system in ponds that are going to have<br/>
turtles when hubby has added them to landscaping jobs he&#39;s done.  One that<br/>
draws the water out and then circulates it back in and one that is a large<br/>
sponge affair that stays in the pond laying on the bottom.<br/>

<br/>
He &#39;gave&#39; us three fish because his tanks overbred and he can&#39;t figure<br/>
out any way to get rid of them.  They are some plain old brownish grey<br/>
fish, nothing pretty.  Some kind of feeder fish and he now has HUNDREDS. <br/>

all putting me on.  And if I end up with 300 fish in my turtle tank, I&#39;m<br/>
gonna make him come fetch every last one of them.<br/>

ps - yes filtering a turtle tank is a good idea.  We run one small filter<br/>
and pump but we still vacuum the bottom and change the water a few times<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619417219">I don&#39;t know too much about their &quot;au natural&quot; habits.  We have two turtles,<br/>
one #3 son caught in the river (Western Pond turtle) and one a local summer<br/>
school was going to have euthenized because they were through with it and<br/>
when #3 son heard about it from a friend he waltzed into their class, asked<br/>
the teacher when the last day of school was and then informed her he would<br/>
be back to pick up the turtle, which he did.  I asked our turtle lover and<br/>
he said that they are usually territorial and most aquatic turtles don&#39;t do<br/>
much wandering on land unless their water source dries up.  So if you get a<br/>
real draught in a local area where turtles live, you might get turtle<br/>
visitors.<br/>
