&lt;&lt; While there I read &quot;Deschooling our Lives&quot; edited by Matt Hern... I was <br/>
 tempted to turn the cover back so no one could see the title but instead <br/>
held <br/>
 open the book proudly.  The man sitting next to me asked if it was some sort <br/>
 of new school that was starting in Tucson.  Where to begin explaining.  I <br/>
 said &quot;no it&#39;s about a form of homeschooling&quot;  He said &quot;oh my sister <br/>
 homeschools her kids, they love it and seem to be doing great&quot; so we then <br/>
got <br/>
 into this conversation about the difference between homeschooling and <br/>
 unschooling.  What a pleasure it was...<br/>
 <br/>

were feeling at the recent party  you were at.  I am happy for you!!  :)  <br/>
