<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842396121">It sometimes takes two or three days for yahoo to stop sending mail when you unsubscribe.  It can also take time to start getting mail when you first subscribe.  Other times I have noticed that the changes register immediately.<br/>
<br/>
If you go into yahoo groups and it shows that you are not a member of a group, you will stop receiving the mail.  Sooner or later...<br/>

away, but the next day a blip of about 20 came through. It was weird. And <br/>
during that time, Yahoo lost a bunch of my groups. They&#39;re back now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
