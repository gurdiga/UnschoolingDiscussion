<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498569887">Ladies,<br/>
    tonight my family&#39;s view on life was permanently altered. We send our <br/>
children to Awana on Tuesday nights. Tonight, they called to tell us that our <br/>
youngest, Tiffany, was upset and we should come and get her. We left the <br/>
house in a rush (Tiffany has Selective Mutism and she is very insecure. When <br/>
we hear she is upset, we go now!) and left the door unlocked. We went and got <br/>
all the children and picked up McDonald&#39;s on the way home. We saw that the <br/>
front screen door was open, and thought that it was odd, but not much... So <br/>
we came in and ate. Ron, my dh, went into our bedroom to take a pain <br/>
reliever, and this is where everything changed. ALL OF OUR MEDICATIONS ARE <br/>
GONE! All of Ron&#39;s pain relievers for the car accident. I am asking for <br/>
prayers for both my family and whoever has the meds. That they do not <br/>
overdose, and that we are ok with how our life goes. We are on a fixed <br/>
income, so we are not able to refill the meds until our insurance picks them <br/>
up again. I am so frustrated. I am at wit&#39;s end with this town. I know that <br/>
God is good, and that he will make everything right. It is just the horrible <br/>
feeling of being violated. Mentally. The officer is here, I need to go. <br/>
Thanks for letting me vent, too. <br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

       I can run home and eat something sweet to keep up my energy! s.<br/>
    Believe in others, and be a part; believe in yourself, and be the lead. s.<br/>

medication.  Addiction is a terrible thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182429432">Thank you Jill. What makes the ordeal worse is that the officer acted as if <br/>
we were nuts. Why would someone just take medicine? I think they were scared <br/>
off before they could get out with anything else. <br/>
