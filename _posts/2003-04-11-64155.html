<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been reading this whole conversation and it has really provided a lot<br/>
of<br/>
food for thought, especially the examples of how different religions view<br/>
spanking.  Would anyone care to offer concrete examples of how they would<br/>
deal with a situation in ways other than spanking?  A couple of examples:<br/>
You&#39;re in a store and your child wants something you don&#39;t have the money<br/>
for<br/>
or you don&#39;t think they need (candy, toy, etc) and they begin to throw a<br/>
tantrum.  What would you do instead of spanking?  Another...Child is asked<br/>
repeatedly to put their things away, they don&#39;t do it, and if told again<br/>
look<br/>
the parent in the face and say, &quot;No!&quot;  And what about lying?  (I am dealing<br/>
with this big time with one of my foster sons right now.)  I really believe<br/>
in logical/natural consequences, as it takes punishment out of the picture<br/>
and instead puts the ball in the child&#39;s court...but lying is something I&#39;m<br/>
having a hard time coming up with solutions on.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess it would depend on the circumstances as to what I would do. Is the<br/>
wanted object something big and expensive? Imean what does a candy bar cost?<br/>
A dollar or two. I would buy the kid a piece of candy. If it&#39;s something<br/>
large and costly, one can find ways for the child or parent to save up to<br/>
get it for the child. Work together on a goal. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what<br/>
you are talking about. I can say that I have never had a child throw a fit<br/>
in a store. Not for any reason. My children get a couple of dollars a week<br/>
to spend as they want. So they always have money of their own for things.<br/>
Buying them a candy bar is something I do when they ask. They go with me a<br/>
lot, sometimes they do ask, most times they don&#39;t. You have to look at the<br/>
whole picture. If the child is always denied, he&#39;s going to keep asking. Or<br/>
at least have feelings like what he wants isn&#39;t being considered.<br/>
<br/>
If I ask my children to clean something up, they have the choice to say yes<br/>
or no. That&#39;s the way it works here. If I want it cleaned up bad enough, I<br/>
will do it myself. If they say no, it might be because there is so much.<br/>
Then my husband or I or one of the other children will help. That &quot;no&quot; child<br/>
will always then help. Joseph&#39;s room was a mess for weeks. Really no floor<br/>
space at all. My husband and I asked him to clean it up so my husband could<br/>
connect the dsl to his computer. Things had to be moved and there was no<br/>
room. It was so overwhelming to him he didn&#39;t want to bother. He started on<br/>
the floor some, and his dad went and helped him do a great job. They both<br/>
actually had fun and their bonding time.<br/>
<br/>
Lying would be different as to the circumstances and how old the child was.<br/>
Not sure there&#39;s a general answer I would have.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess all 3 of my kids have thrown a tantrum, great thing about them<br/>
&gt; getting older, is I have a tendency to forget most of those things.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When they put up a fuss for a candy bar lets say,<br/>
&gt; I first had to evaluate if they were really hungry.<br/>
&gt; If they were really young, I would just take them out of the store,<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
&gt; It was to watch them, standing by my cart, look at my watch occasionally<br/>

I think there is a world of difference between not being able to afford<br/>
something, (a real reason for not buying) and the adult deciding the<br/>
child doesn’t *need* the item - which could be an arbitrary reason. In<br/>
the world where food is not restricted, then the candy question does not<br/>
come up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have been trying not to use the word “tantrum” - Non-Violent<br/>
Communication recommends avoiding judgmental words in favor of neutrally<br/>
descriptive language. Change your language, and you change your<br/>
thoughts. When Jayn has a desire that is beyond our financial means, I<br/>
explain that we can add it to her list, or look for it at the factory<br/>
outlet later, on sale (which we then follow through on of course). When<br/>
she cries and is upset, I comfort her, and sometimes I am able to<br/>
distract her by inviting her to help unload the buggy. Usually she just<br/>
needs to vent the feelings for a few moments. I find that if I let it<br/>
happen, with sympathy expressed, the sad feelings blow over. The desire<br/>
stays - she will say on a regular basis that she is “a little bit<br/>
upset” that she doesn’t have such-and-such a doll. Oh and the joy when<br/>
we are able to get it for her!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and usually I just don’t go down the toy aisle at the market unless<br/>
she specifically asks me to.<br/>
