There are some very good groups in the Twin Cities area.  As for the h/s <br/>
laws...you have to contact the school district/superintendent&#39;s office of the <br/>
area you&#39;re in and get the packet on homeschooling.  If you don&#39;t have a <br/>
Bachelor&#39;s degree or more, you have to file a quarterly report card with them <br/>
on subjects but you don&#39;t have to list any kind of curriculum or anything <br/>
like that.  They want you to have your kids tested once a year and that part <br/>
kind of worried me but the h/s groups have names of private indviduals who <br/>
administer a test (there are different ones you can use) and it seemed pretty <br/>
laid back.  You are not required to show the school district those tests, <br/>
just to have them done.<br/>
     Get in touch with a support group there.  I have the name of someone in <br/>
Chaska who can give you more info about who to talk to...if you want it, <br/>
email me privately about it.<br/>
     I really enjoyed living there.  There is a lot to do and the overall <br/>
atmosphere is tolerant and progressive.  And I&#39;m going there on Wed. to see <br/>
my sister&#39;s twin babies for the first time!!!<br/>
