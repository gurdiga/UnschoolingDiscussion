<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765923839">Dear homeschooling friends <br/>
<br/>
By now, many of you have read about the tsunami that has just hit the<br/>
coastal areas of the Bay of Bengal. I am particularly sad to report<br/>
that areas of the coast of southeast India are in ruins.<br/>
<br/>
This is the area in which my adopted Indian parents have been doing<br/>
land reform/development work for the past 40 years, and also where<br/>
American homeschoolers have contributed much-needed funds to help<br/>
build houses for people who were previously living in little more than<br/>
mud and grass huts that would be destroyed during every monsoon, and<br/>
to support 220 orphans. A wall of water 30-40 feet high hit and moved<br/>
more than 10 miles inland (where the orphanages are), destroying<br/>
everything in its wake.. The mangroves, which had been the only<br/>
natural protection against such destruction, had all been cut down by<br/>
multinational/World Bank-backed projects in industrial shrimp farming.<br/>
 As of this writing, 1,100 people are reported dead in this district,<br/>
and upwards of a million homeless. I am awaiting more direct word from<br/>
my mother or sister, but am unlikely to receive it anytime soon. (My<br/>
sister is head of a pediatrics hospital in the region  I expect I<br/>
won&#39;t hear from her in weeks!),<br/>
<br/>
As it turns out, my daughter (former homeschooler and now Smith<br/>
College first-year Aliyah) and I were planning to leave for the area<br/>
on Tuesday evening. We would (and may) still go, though with plans to<br/>
assist in the relief effort. But I expect the local airports will be<br/>
commandeered for relief aid, so we&#39;ll just have to see.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, we have set up a relief fund. All proceeds from the<br/>
sale of my book &quot;The Color of Freedom&quot; (which is an oral biography of<br/>
my parents, and the story of their work) were already going to their<br/>
efforts, and can be purchased through my website at<br/>
www.skylarksings.com  Tax-deductible donations  cash, checks, or<br/>
credit cards  can be sent to me at the address on the site (if for<br/>
more than $500, checks should be made out to The Gandhian Foundation;<br/>
if not, simply to Skylark Sings, as the funds will get there faster.)<br/>
The quickest way is simply to call me at 360 352-0506 (will be out<br/>
this evening, though), and I&#39;ll do what is necessary  we will wire<br/>
the combined contributions directly, and there will be no overhead to<br/>
cover.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your help and prayers.<br/>
<br/>
