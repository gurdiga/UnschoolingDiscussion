&gt; <br/>
&gt; refuse to buy the toy, or whatever it is, and stand your ground.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s better than &quot;maybe later.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Why insult a child and destroy hope?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And it&#39;s important to make sure that you&#39;re not just standing your ground to <br/>
establish or confirm your authority. I used to do that, like Sage would want <br/>
something and, only half listening, I&#39;d say no. Then came a tantrum and when <br/>
I actually paid attention, and thought about it, I could really say yes. Then <br/>
comes the humbling part, to tell him that I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t really paying <br/>
attention and that it&#39;s ok with me. But I had to get over that, &quot;I have to <br/>
make sure he doesn&#39;t just get his way all the time&quot; thing.<br/>
<br/>
And on destroying hope, I want to really avoid that. I remember very young <br/>
losing the hope of asking my parents for anything, at least anything big. <br/>
While they got the point across that I couldn&#39;t have everything I wanted all <br/>
the time, they also forgot to teach me that with enough time, planning, and <br/>
saving, I could get almost anything I wanted. I just had the idea that big <br/>
things were out of my reach.<br/>
<br/>
My current problem is that 3yo son has just suddenly taken interest in the <br/>
larger dollar item stuff. Up until now I&#39;ve been able to divert requests to <br/>
smaller dollar items in department stores and it&#39;s pretty much free reign at <br/>
goodwill. So I&#39;ve never really taken the time to explain to him money issues. <br/>
But now he&#39;s really upset at my not buying him $30 toys at each trip. <br/>
<br/>
So, I really like what Sandra said about maybe he&#39;s needing more time and <br/>
attention and less stuff. In fact I just recently rearranged his room and set <br/>
up some really cool stuff in there and we&#39;ve really been spending a lot more <br/>
time in there, I think that&#39;s helping some.<br/>
<br/>
But what about money? I&#39;ve been thinking of starting an allowance for him, <br/>
but not sure how to go about it. I think it might help him to know/have some <br/>
control over when  we can and can&#39;t get stuff. Instead of it just being sort <br/>
of a luck of the draw to him. I&#39;m sure it seems like sometimes I say yes and <br/>
sometimes I say no, just because.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; Let the tantrum take it&#39;s course and try and ignore the stares from <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; strangers as much as possible. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think, when I&#39;m in a store, that the other people have the particular <br/>
&gt; right <br/>
&gt; to shop in peace.  I have read baffling advice from homeschooling moms (and <br/>
&gt; some others) who are  basically saying &quot;to hell with other people; live <br/>
&gt; your <br/>
&gt; life with your child as though other people don&#39;t exist.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I try to let my son&#39;s tantrum run its course AND be considerate of others. I <br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to other people to have to sit thru a screaming tantrum <br/>
of a small child. On the other hand, it isn&#39;t fair to my son to tell him to <br/>
stuff it because he&#39;s disturbing others. I try to calm him, then move to a <br/>
bathroom, or sometimes we go outside. There have been times when we&#39;ve gone <br/>
outside or to the car then returned to the store when things have calmed done.<br/>
<br/>
I have not been upset when dining or shopping to hear another child/baby <br/>
start to cry or throw a tantrum. It&#39;s life. My problem is when it continues. <br/>

disturbing others - not helping him gain that awareness isn&#39;t fair either.<br/>

A 12 yo probably ought to have learned enough self-control to not melt down <br/>
when it happens that you don&#39;t agree to buy him what he wants when he wants <br/>

I think we are on the same page.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m agreeing to helping the child become aware of the world around them.<br/>
This help *probably* ought to happen somewhere *between* 2 and 12.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure where all the *shoulds* came from.<br/>
<br/>
The expectation that a person starts to become aware of the society around<br/>
them between toddling and puberty does not seem to me, the strict age based<br/>
bias you are worried about.<br/>
<br/>
When overly concerned friends, relatives and strangers were asking when our<br/>
3 year old son was going to stop nursing I would reply straight faced with<br/>
&quot;before the prom.&quot;  This was an expectation on my part. But never once did<br/>
it become a age based *should* for us.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Yes, I agree that a parent should help a child come to the understanding <br/>
that his behaviour is distrubing others, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the amalgamated point (you might have deleted some?) was that at some <br/>
point between three and twelve (or between any age and any other later age) a <br/>
child develops more awareness, and while a parent shouldn&#39;t expect a three <br/>
year old to understand consideration for others, that if a parent treats a <br/>
twelve year old like a three year old it&#39;s a disservice to someone who IS <br/>
getting older.<br/>
<br/>
Some three year olds are more considerate than some twelve year olds.  That <br/>
doesn&#39;t change the fact that in the life of any one individual child the <br/>
messages from parents should ideally get more refined and detailed over the <br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
I think that was the rolled-altogether, point, so I think Carol was mostly in <br/>
agreement.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the quibble, though.  I think it bothers me as much when people <br/>
want to get all excited that one of my kids is ahead of their <br/>
schedule/checklist as it does when they&#39;re giving me &quot;the look&quot; because they <br/>
perceive one of mine to be &quot;behind.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
*****<br/>
Setting up an allowances was something we had talked about earlier this year. Not for the store outbursts, but for general good measure -- so they can practice real choice-making that we can afford -- and so that they can see their money accumulate and disappear.<br/>
<br/>
One hint I read was to offer a weekly amount (a month can be interminable for me :)). Say two dollars (or more, but with three kids and what I&#39;ll share below, this can add up quickly). In order to illustrate the power of saving and to show that shopping is not the same as buying, the parent can stipulate that whatever is left at the end of a week will be doubled (I&#39;d like that interest rate!). So if nothing is spent in a month, the child has a total of $16. <br/>
<br/>
My brother added that to help the kids begin to think about the long-term, an additional monthly &quot;dividend&quot; could be added as well as a yearly &quot;bonus.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Money is a tremendous source of frustration for me. We work had for our income and I want the kids to learn that willingness and ability to work hard, so I am trying to figure out how to deal with the allowance itself. How much money? I&#39;m thinking there should be a set base amount (even if it&#39;s only 50 cents a week) they get just because they are in our family and are unable to get money any other way. This small sum would permit them not to have to feel the extent of my money-spending power all the time -- they would not be completely dependent upon me (except for getting them to the stores :)). <br/>
<br/>
The other part is can they do things to add to their regular amount if they want to get something special? I am loathe to make regular keep-the-house-running-smoothly tasks up for financial grabs, but maybe there are other things they could do to be entrepreneurs....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

anything my son wants is totally my decision, even if he generally gets it.  <br/>

adult wages.  He recently worked for 3 weeks making $20/hour.  I&#39;ll still <br/>
give him his allowance if he asks, but I won&#39;t pay &quot;back wages&quot; if he <br/>
forgets to ask.  He&#39;s got way more disposable income than I do.  &lt;g&gt;  He <br/>
just finished paying off a $3700 bike!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s *very* good with money so far.<br/>

&lt;&lt; how early did they start receiving <br/>
allowance? Do they ever request an increase or are they ever offered stuff to <br/>
earn more? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At five.  They all started at once (the boys) when they were five and seven, <br/>
and so Holly got in on it when she was five.  (Holly reminded me of this.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not something we thought up from birth at all.  It just happened that <br/>
way.  And they get allowance on Sundays.  That&#39;s because we first did it on a <br/>
Sunday. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Some parts of other people&#39;s plans just shouldn&#39;t be emulated.   &lt;bwg&gt; **<br/>
<br/>
We thought of going to Saturdays but decided it&#39;s so much easier to spend <br/>
money on a Saturday that if they got it Sunday they could more easily plan <br/>
ahead for something during the week.<br/>
<br/>
We had read about another family that did dollar per year per week (six year <br/>
old gets $6 a week) but we couldn&#39;t afford it, so we did the 75% thing.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s great at stashing and saving.  Kirby asks us to keep it until it <br/>
builds up.  Holly keeps hers too.<br/>
<br/>
They usually get money from relatives on birthdays and Christmas.  Sometimes <br/>
I&#39;ll pay Marty to do something yucky or to stay with Holly if I know he needs <br/>
money for something.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby has a job at minimum wage plus first obligatory raise.   He spends most <br/>
of it on anime books (I forget the Japanese word for cartoon books based on <br/>
animated series) and gaming cards.   He also takes friends out to eat.  He <br/>
bought one of his friends a $30 toy (birthday gift)--an 18&quot; wide dragon <br/>
figure of some fantasy character.  They were both really happy with the whole <br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
My favorite story about how traditions get started:<br/>
<br/>
It was Christmas and Dad was carving the Christmas ham. The curiosity of the <br/>
youngest raised a question: &quot;Mom,&quot; she asked, &quot;why do you cut the ends off of <br/>
the Christmas ham?&quot; &quot;An easy question,&quot; thought Mom. &quot;Ah, because that&#39;s the <br/>
way my mother did it,&quot; she answered with a smile. <br/>
<br/>
Grandma was sitting at the table and she was asked, &quot;Grandma, why did you cut <br/>
the ends off your Christmas ham?&quot; Grandma answered with a smile, &quot;Because <br/>
that&#39;s the way my mother did it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Great Grandma was sitting in her place. &quot;Great Grandma,&quot; she was asked, &quot;why <br/>
did you cut the ends off your Christmas ham?&quot; She couldn&#39;t believe somebody <br/>
was talking to her. She looked around the table. All eyes were on her. &quot;Huh?&quot; <br/>
she said. &quot;Great Grandma, why did you cut the ends off your Christmas ham?&quot; <br/>
She stared off into the distance, looking back into the past. Slowly smiling, <br/>
she said, &quot;Well, the reason I cut the ends off my Christmas ham was because <br/>
the ham was always too big to fit into my baking pan. I had to cut the ends <br/>
off so the ham could fit into my pan and then could fit into my oven.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-502521498">We tried the allowance thing at one point, but we all would forget to do it, <br/>
including Julian. Or we&#39;d forget to get cash. We&#39;d end up owing him lots of <br/>
money, and just felt guilty. So we all agreed to stop the charade. LOL<br/>
<br/>
For most stuff, most of the time, if Julian wants something and we can afford <br/>
it, we just buy it. When we&#39;re out, I&#39;ve gotten in the habit of asking him if <br/>
there&#39;s anything he wants or needs before we leave. Most of the time he says <br/>
no.He doesn&#39;t ask for stuff much (maybe because he knows it&#39;s an option?), so <br/>
when he asks, it&#39;s something he REALLY wants. If it&#39;s a bigger thing, we <br/>
might ask him to wait until Christmas or a birthday (Or Julian Day, another <br/>
story).  Or sometimes things come together and it just works out to get it <br/>
for him.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s gotten really good at shopping critically. There was a magazine with <br/>
Computer game codes he was interested in at one point for eight bucks.  I <br/>
told him I could probably get all the codes online, and asked if he wanted to <br/>
buy it, or try that first. He decided the latter, and was happy we didn&#39;t <br/>
spend the money.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I&#39;m thinking there should be a set base amount (even if it&#39;s only 50 <br/>
cents a week) they get just because they are in our family and are unable to <br/>
get money any other way. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In our family, my children (eldest dd) have come up with ideas for making her<br/>
own money. She doesn&#39;t ask for money or ask to work for me to make money.<br/>
I think it started out that she just liked the idea of selling something and<br/>
making money, not that she really had a want or need for it, just the idea<br/>
of a &quot;sale&quot;.  So we picked avocadoes and she sold them when she was<br/>
6.  She made a fortune.  Next year our friend, and avocado rancher told<br/>
us to come pick his so we did, and the kids almost tripled their income.  <br/>
Obviously this is a little niche the children have found, they have the right<br/>
product (plus its FREE) and a good location.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;This small sum would permit them not to have to feel the extent of my <br/>
money-spending power all the time -- they would not be completely dependent <br/>
upon me (except for getting them to the stores :)). &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am finding this allowance talk informative.  I like what you have said here.<br/>
We don&#39;t give an allowance and I <br/>
really hadn&#39;t planned on it.  The way I was raised, I didn&#39;t get<br/>
one but I seldom seemed to want for anything either.  Mom paid for the show,<br/>
or whatever.  We did garage sales and I always got stuff.  With<br/>
the kids it seems to be the same way.  Plus their dad leaves tons of change<br/>
around which sometimes they ask if they can have.  If it falls from the <br/>
dresser<br/>
or counter, its goes to whomever finds it LOL.  I thought for a long time that<br/>
this was the best way, letting them come up with ways to earn money<br/>
(but not making it too hard by letting them have the change, plus Grandma<br/>
money etc). but I do sometimes like the ideas discussed with allowances.<br/>
They opened savings accounts from their last sale and frankly I think<br/>
they have forgotten about the money.  <br/>
I have to share the cutest story today. We were at a Stationary store and<br/>
the kids were off shopping on their own, each carrying his/her wallet.  I<br/>
was on one end they on the other with calling back and forth mom? how<br/>
much is this, I would go check or have them bring it to me. Half way thru<br/>
my shopping expedition my littlest who is 4 comes up to me telling me<br/>
he wants to buy this pencil. So I let him know how much it is as he gets<br/>
in line. I stand back a ways.  He asks me to hold his balloon and I say<br/>
no you better pay for it first.  He tells me he already payed for it.  He was <br/>
just so cute to see standing in line like he knew his business and paying<br/>
for his stuff and he really didn&#39;t need me at all!  When I had been in another<br/>
part of the store he had gotten in line and already paid for the balloon! <br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt;The other part is can they do things to add to their regular amount if <br/>
they want to get something special? I am loathe to make regular <br/>
keep-the-house-running-smoothly tasks up for financial grabs, but maybe there <br/>
are other things they could do to be entrepreneurs.... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My dd has a book on ideas for kids to make money. Something I think would<br/>
be really cool for a kid to do is to sell outgrown toys, games etc. on ebay.  <br/>
My<br/>
dd wanted a new American Girl doll, so she sold her old one on ebay for almost<br/>
as much as we paid for it and purchased a new one.  I think she only had<br/>
to pay a difference of about $6 and I picked up the difference for her anyhow,<br/>
plus I hate to have her pay for shipping so I paid for that also. Sometimes I<br/>
think I&#39;m not teaching her about money when I don&#39;t have her pay for those<br/>
Shipping etc. but she has little and I have more and I like to share.<br/>

she&#39;s doll obsessed! It&#39;s a great connection to her<br/>
Mamaw (my mother), because my mom is obsessed with<br/>
buying her American Girl stuff for her to &#39;collect&#39; -<br/>
yeah right.<br/>
By the way, my dd called me mummy (we recently moved<br/>
here from the UK) until a few months ago. Now I&#39;m<br/>
&#39;mum&#39; because &quot;Mummy is too babyish&quot;. Where does she<br/>
GET this stuff? Not that I mind what my title is, as<br/>
long as I still get lots of cuddles &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
