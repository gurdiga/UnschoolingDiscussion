<div id="ygrps-yiv-829314243">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  If she does not do any of it<br/>
(including the weeks chores) then she looses some autonomy.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Autonomy is a synonym for freedom in the thesaurus, but if by &quot;loses some<br/>
 </span></blockquote>autonomy&quot; you mean her freedom is limited if she didn&#39;t finish her work,<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
control. &lt;<br/>
<br/>
I understand that she wants to achieve a goal (college or whatever) and she<br/>
needs to master some material in order to achieve that.  If she asks for<br/>
some help with that, that&#39;s still unschooling.  If you help her set a<br/>
schedule over a period of weeks to months in order to achieve that, it&#39;s<br/>
still unschooling.  If she decides not to do the work or follow the<br/>
schedule, that should be HER decision alone, and the consequences (not<br/>
getting into whatever program) are HERS alone, THAT is unschooling.  And she<br/>
will have learned a valuable life lesson either way.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, my daughter, almost 7, has a problem with her handwriting.<br/>
She avoids it because she knows it&#39;s bad, and it&#39;s hard for her.  On<br/>
occasion she&#39;ll come to me and ask for help.  I&#39;ll give her some suggestions<br/>
and she&#39;ll maybe work in a workbook, trace some letters, etc.  But if after<br/>
30 seconds she decides to go watch a video or do a watercolor or ride her<br/>
bike, that&#39;s fine.  I&#39;m not enforcing 10 minutes several times a week to<br/>
achieve that goal.  I may ask her every now and then if she wants to<br/>
practice, but if she says no, that&#39;s ok with me.<br/>
<br/>
That is what is being said on this list.  I haven&#39;t seen anyone trying to be<br/>
rude, but some have been very blunt because it seems that you&#39;re not<br/>
understanding this crucial point.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the problem in understanding here stems from this:  Our lives are<br/>
completely integrated.  Housework and &#39;schoolwork&#39; are part of life.  We<br/>
don&#39;t give allowances and we don&#39;t pay for work done.  We consider room<br/>
and board enough payment but if one of them wants something, they are<br/>
much more likely to get it if I am happy with them than if I am not.  Use<br/>
of the car is one of those things.  It isn&#39;t her car.  Heck, it isn&#39;t<br/>
even mine.  The money for gas more often than not is my money.  So it&#39;s a<br/>
trade, if she wants something from me, I want something from her. <br/>
Bartering at it&#39;s finest and most subtle.  And if on any given week she<br/>
does not feel like writing, I probably won&#39;t make an issue of it.  I<br/>
might make an issue of it if she does not feel like getting out of bed<br/>
for an entire week, but that is somethign different entirely.<br/>
