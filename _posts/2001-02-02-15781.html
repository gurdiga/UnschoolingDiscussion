<div id="ygrps-yiv-607135546">Thanks, Dawn. I have a Roman Catholic friend who went on the pill when she<br/>
was younger as a way to rebel against her parents :). And now she&#39;s had a<br/>
very successful time using NFP, which is something I want to learn more<br/>
about. I have &quot;Taking Charge of Your Fertility&quot; just sitting there waiting<br/>
to be read.<br/>
