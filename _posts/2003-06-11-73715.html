<br/>
&lt;&lt;I had been doing so much better in this area last year!  I even got<br/>
called a &quot;hothead&quot; for the first time in my 38 (then) years!  Joe says I<br/>
 need to maintain some of that &#39;hotheadedness&#39; ...meaning say what I<br/>
think and don&#39;t be concerned about how the other people feel.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to respond to you the first time you wrote about this. I seem to<br/>
have a hard time with things like this too. I&#39;m very outspoken when it comes<br/>
to certain things, mostly that would be my kids. I won&#39;t stand for anyone<br/>
offending them. But for me, that&#39;s another story. I seem to be somewhat of a<br/>
pushover. And what bothers me is I never was. I was always very able to<br/>
stand up for myself, sometimes being bitchy but hey it got me what I wanted<br/>
or needed. Not in nasty way mind you just to the point. I would let people<br/>
know if they said something out of line. Now I find I let so much go that I<br/>
stay up some nights just seething as to why I didn&#39;t say this or that.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is very sarcastic and very very quick to say what&#39;s on his mind,<br/>
even if it&#39;s &quot;your an asshole.&quot; That&#39;s one reason why I tend to be gentler,<br/>
I think to make up for what he might say! Well in the process I&#39;ve lost<br/>
myself.  I really avoid conflict at all costs. And because of this, I feel<br/>
like I get stepped on more than I should allow.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if there is a 12 step program for people like us???<br/>
