<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140998150">So, I have this little homeschooling mini-speaking tour planned, and<br/>
with a little hole in the middle. I am speaking in Pittburgh the<br/>
afternoon and evening of Thursday, August 14th, and in Columbus, Ohio<br/>
the afternoon and evening of Saturday, August 16th.  So, have car,<br/>
will travel.<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping to set up a speaking engagement for folks who would be<br/>
interested in having me anywhere from Cleveland/Akron/(Erie?) to<br/>
Toledo (Detroit would be real stretch, but theoretically possible), on<br/>
the afternoon/evening of Friday, August 15th.  I promise that it will<br/>
be fun (and, hopefully, educational!) . You can read about what I like<br/>
to talk about on my site ? www.skylarksings.com<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, if you are intrigued, just e-mail me and we can kibbitz some,<br/>
and see if we can make it happen. (I think there are some folks on<br/>
this list who can vouch for me....)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

on October 11th, and then down in Garden City, Long Island on October <br/>
12th. (It&#39;s true, I&#39;ve never spoken in Connecticut before, and very, <br/>
very rarely get to the northeast.)</div>

That&#39;s wonderful! We can&#39;t wait to go! <br/>
<br/>
Do you have a place where you will be posting the time and place that you <br/>
will be speaking?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be in Connecticut from NH on those dates so that works out perfect. <br/>
Looking forward to it. Thanks!<br/>
