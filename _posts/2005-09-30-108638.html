<div id="ygrps-yiv-816034874">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
When dealing with the idea of safe/unsafe strangers or people in general, I remind my kids that they know instinctively about the person if they listen to their inner voice. We all feel safe around most people and a little off around others.<br/>
<br/>
And on an aside, I love unschooling because I am with my little ones when they are out exploring the world and interacting. It&#39;s not as if my 6 year old is out all day with a bunch of strangers. She is with me and may want to talk to the guy at the park and I am right there too. Safe, talking to interesting people, learning and growing. <br/>
<br/>
When Riley was 3 he loved everyone he met. Once I could not find him in the playgroud, it&#39;s a big wooden maze place with 2 opening and I had 2 other little one&#39;s I was following around and he just got out of site. When I did locate him, he was sitting on the hill with a family right in the middle of their picnic, chatting away, asking if they lived in Davis, telling them our phone number, where we lived, the color of our house. I calmly walked over, introduced myself, and we stayed a few more minutes until Riley was finished meeting new people.<br/>
<br/>
He still gravitates towards interesting groups, watches from the egde and slowly interacts. I have noticed that kids who are home and out in the world are able to interact with all types of people because they have been allowed too. <br/>

and some don&#39;t feel safe or off in the same degree others do.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know instinctively how or where to kick a ball, and I&#39;m not good at <br/>
throwing things long distances.    I know instinctively how to harmonize <br/>
several kinds of traditional music, different styles.<br/>
<br/>
Just because some kids are better at reading strangers than others doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean an across-the-board rule will help, but when parents are aware that a <br/>
particular child is maybe too trusting or too paranoid, he could be coached himself <br/>
where he is, and maybe some tricks or escape plans could be discussed.   <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes!!<br/>
Kids in school live in a setting in which you only talk to adults in <br/>
prescribed ways, you don&#39;t talk to people much older or younger than you are, you <br/>
don&#39;t talk to cliques you don&#39;t like, or there might be some you insult in passing <br/>
without regard to their actual individual humanity.    That doesn&#39;t happen <br/>
with unschooling, as far as I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>

instinctively had their instincts questioned or quashed or muted because of <br/>
those repeated warnings and the way they were raised? Or is that more of a <br/>
&quot;nature&quot; kind of thing? Just curious-is Mr. Gardner an author?<br/>
