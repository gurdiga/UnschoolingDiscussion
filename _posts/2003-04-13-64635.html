<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935324583">I don&#39;t usually post here, but I am a Scientologist and wanted to say that if <br/>
you truly want to know more about it, try Scientology.org as a place to <br/>
begin.  Specifically on children you can try:   <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/catechism/pg012.html">http://www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/catechism/pg012.html</a><br/>
<br/>
And just as my opinion which should be taken for whatever it&#39;s worth to you, <br/>
but it not only sounds like Tia didn&#39;t have a very happy experience with <br/>
Scientology, but it also sounds like her parents severly misinterpreted <br/>
Scientology principles.  If a child said &quot;I hate you, Mom&quot; and was met only <br/>
with a reply such as &quot;Thank you&quot;, that&#39;s not a very sane reply.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
seen this in any of the Scientologists I&#39;ve met.  <br/>
