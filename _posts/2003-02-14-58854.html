***My dad was great.  His brother died last year, my last favorite<br/>
relative on <br/>
that side, my Uncle John.  He reminded me lots of my dad, and could<br/>
always <br/>
tell me stories about my dad or when I was a baby.***<br/>
<br/>
All of my dad&#39;s siblings are gone now, too.  My last uncle on my dad&#39;s<br/>
side used to take us flying as kids and he had horses and a pet pig.   My<br/>
mom could never stand him but we loved him.   My dad&#39;s family had a hard,<br/>
quick kind of biting humor that my mom was always being hurt by.    She<br/>
raised five kids who were just the same, poor woman.<br/>
<br/>
My dad was a horticulturist and florist, like his dad.   That&#39;s what I<br/>
did too for awhile so I guess it&#39;s genetic.   I still have and plant<br/>
seeds from my dad&#39;s hand collected assortment and their offspring.   He&#39;s<br/>
still a big deal around here in spite of being  gone two years.   <br/>
<br/>
My dad served in WWII as a medic.  He&#39;d been to medical school for a<br/>
while and  volunteered for service as a conscientious objector.   He said<br/>
it was his hope to kill fewer people as a medic than a soldier.   He was<br/>
also in Japan during the occupation and made friends with a Japanese man<br/>
who continued to correspond with my dad until he died. <br/>
<br/>
As kids we were mostly afraid of him but in the last years of his life we<br/>
became great friends and healed some and discovered we could understand<br/>
and love one another.    Dylan remembers him as the funniest man he&#39;s<br/>
ever known.   Not a bad way to be remembered by your grandson.  <br/>
<br/>
My dad&#39;s name was Lloyd Morgan, artist, gardener and funny guy.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961186171">We have been and will be remembering my father in law.  He was diagnosed as <br/>
terminally ill in Dec with liver disease.  His prognosis is to be dead by <br/>
April at the latest.. maybe much sooner.  He is 63.  Wonderful father of 5 <br/>
and loving husband to his wife of 42 years.. He will be sorely missed.  Its <br/>
tough, but our family is bonding to take care of him.   I&#39;ll be staying on <br/>
Tuesday nights and Wednesdays.   If it crosses your mind.. think of us and <br/>
send us good thoughts during this difficult time.  <br/>

they&#39;ve ever known. Generous with his money, with his knowledge, with his <br/>
time, and with his love. Another wonderful way to be remembered by your <br/>
grandsons.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been lucky! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
