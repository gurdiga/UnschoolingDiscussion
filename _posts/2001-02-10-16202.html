<div id="ygrps-yiv-215988153">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading my 6 3/4 year old son the 3rd Harry Potter book now.  In the<br/>
last book and this one I have to read more slowly because he&#39;s now<br/>
stopping me and asking me to define words he doesn&#39;t know and explain<br/>
things that have happened.  He&#39;s also relating more what happened before<br/>
and what&#39;s next, how the picture relates to the story or not.  We had<br/>
also listened to the tapes before we had read the books.  It&#39;s like he&#39;s<br/>
figuring out how one puts a book together.  We  read it at least 1 hour<br/>
a day.  Isn&#39;t Unschooling great?<br/>
<br/>

PS  Is anyone living in Upper Michigan or Northeast Wisconsin?</div>

Yes!  While reading one of the Harry Potter books, there was a part about<br/>
a quidditch (how do you spell that?) game.  My 7dd made two comments<br/>
about the math involved in the scoring and the number of players on a<br/>
team.  I love those moments of seeing them learn something they weren&#39;t<br/>
&quot;taught&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of books on tape, we have really enjoyed &quot;My Lousiana Sky&quot;, The<br/>
&quot;Indian in the Cupboard&quot; series and &quot;Charlotte&#39;s Web&quot;, read by the<br/>
author.<br/>

Hi Sherry<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone cautioned you about reading the 4th book before you read it to <br/>
your son?  It was, IMO, much darker than the previous books and it scared my <br/>
10 year old a LOT.  She had to ask me to stop for a couple of nights.  Just <br/>
thought I would mention this.<br/>

***True. I&#39;d suggest reading it yourself first.<br/>
