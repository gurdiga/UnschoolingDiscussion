&gt;Susan,<br/>
&gt;     Yep, sounds just like my family!  Only they wish that my kids were <br/>
&gt;into<br/>
&gt;soccer or baseball like my sil kids.  My kids are not into sports.  They <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;into computers, role playing games, and scouts.  I let them choose.<br/>
&gt;     LOL  We do close doors and curtains!  Yes we do get surprise visits  <br/>
&gt;:-(<br/>
&gt;One time my parents just showed up and we were all still in bed.  It was <br/>
&gt;even<br/>
&gt;later than usual (about 10:30 or 11:00 am) and I knew my parents would <br/>
&gt;think<br/>
&gt;we were horrible!  They already think that about sleeping past 8:00 am!)  <br/>
&gt;We<br/>
&gt;had been up late reading Harry Potter and playing games.    So we just <br/>
&gt;stayed<br/>
&gt;in bed and giggled and didn&#39;t answer the door.  A few minutes later my <br/>
&gt;phone<br/>
&gt;rang.  The answering maching picked up and my mom was screaming into it.  <br/>
&gt;She<br/>
&gt;was still in the driveway on her cell phone!<br/>
&gt;She was &quot;frantic&quot; that we were hurt, since our van was in the garage.  She<br/>
&gt;thinks that living in the country is dangerous, so she thought we were <br/>
&gt;laying<br/>
&gt;dead in the house!  Well it ticked me off!  So I just let her rant and rave<br/>
&gt;and still didn&#39;t answer the door.  When we finally spoke hours later on the<br/>
&gt;phone, I told her how silly she had been.  I really showed her how <br/>
&gt;ridiculous<br/>
&gt;it looked for her to stand out in my driveway on her cell phone, while she<br/>
&gt;tried to break in my house (I forgot to mention that earlier, but she tried<br/>
&gt;to also break in to &quot;save&quot; us).  Needless to say, we don&#39;t get so many<br/>
&gt;surprise visits, but I still don&#39;t trust them!<br/>
&gt;Tammy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; omigosh Tammy, this sounds so much like what we are going through with<br/>
&gt; &gt; my in-laws right now - all three of them (fil, mil, sil -- they come as<br/>
&gt; &gt; a unit). We won&#39;t leave the kids with them anymore, due to lack of trust<br/>
&gt; &gt; (long story). 12 yo dd has asked to not have to go there at all anymore,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and we said okay. A friend has agreed to take her whenever necessary.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They no longer quiz her - they ignore her. The only time anyone seems to<br/>
&gt; &gt; talk to her is to ask if she&#39;s taking dance lessons yet. She has told<br/>
&gt; &gt; them, I have told them, that she isn&#39;t interested in dance, she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; involved with acting. They have little interest in that, and dd no<br/>
&gt; &gt; longer wants them invited to her plays (fine with me and hubby).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I agree, kids first, grandparents second - and the kids act more mature<br/>
&gt; &gt; and compassionate than the &quot;adults&quot;.  We also get the behind the back<br/>
&gt; &gt; questioning and stuff too. We hate it, kids hate it. How disrespectful.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve been told that they (in-laws) don&#39;t need us telling them anything<br/>
&gt; &gt; about children because they raised two of their own. What we have to say<br/>
&gt; &gt; about our own kids is of no interest to them - including safety issues.<br/>
&gt; &gt; (okay, heading towards a rant here.... sorry)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, trust your instincts, trust your kids, and close the curtains<br/>
&gt; &gt; and lock the doors (you do get surprise visits, don&#39;t you? )<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; quick! how many unschoolers does it take to do a math problem?... well,<br/>
&gt; &gt; first you need to have a reason to do a math problem..hmm.. let&#39;s bake<br/>
&gt; &gt; brownies.. then we...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; take care,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700184509">I really enjoyed that program. I just wish that I had seen the 1900<br/>
House when it was on. I liked that they focused a little more on the<br/>
family accomplishing things, rather than the emotional problems of the<br/>
folks (Frontier House was like a soap opera). The family seemed to be<br/>
enormously changed from only 9 weeks. I loved the board game the boys<br/>
created. <br/>
<br/>
I would love to do something like this also. Perhaps they will do a<br/>
1914-18 House. <br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned Peter Pan II, one of my dd&#39;s favorites. The lack of<br/>
&quot;blackout&quot; irritates me. It doesn&#39;t actually scan age wise from the<br/>
previous film - Wendy would be way older.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;did anyone see the 1940&#39;s house?  the 10yob was made the fuel warden.<br/>
He <br/>
had to calculate how much energy different items used (mainly lights)<br/>
and <br/>
ways to conserve.<br/>
