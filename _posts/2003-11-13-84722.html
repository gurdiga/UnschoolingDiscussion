<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990677490">Okay, I&#39;ve got 2 different sorta math questions to ask here. <br/>
<br/>
1) I was talking with a mom at Casey gym the other day. Her daughter <br/>
is 12 and has Down&#39;s Syndrome, pretty high functioning from what I <br/>
could tell. She mentioned that she homeschooled her and was eager to <br/>
ask me lots of questions when she found out that we unschool. Her <br/>
main concern was math. Well actually, her first concern was really <br/>
that she was looking for &quot;permission&quot; to live and play more and &quot;do <br/>
schoolwork&quot; less. I was able to handle that fine. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
She told me of her daughter&#39;s passion for birds and wildlife and her <br/>
ability to recognize and name even rare species. She also shared <br/>
feeling guilty because all they did was can fruit and veggies from <br/>
their garden in September, an activity which her daughter loved. <br/>
(They &quot;got a late start for school.&quot;) I set her straight (as *I* see <br/>
it) and she was open and ready to hear what I had to say.<br/>
<br/>
But her concern with math is that her daughter does not seen to have <br/>
one to one number correlation. She doesn&#39;t get the idea of counting, <br/>
I guess, and so can&#39;t move forward with any math program. I channeled <br/>
what I could of Pam Sorooshian to her &lt;g&gt; and explained about games <br/>
and hands on and thinking mathematically and how it doesn&#39;t need to <br/>
look like pages of worksheets. But now I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s <br/>
something more to it in light of her daughter&#39;s Down Syndrome. Is it <br/>
more necessary to drill with these kids? My sense is that this is <br/>
what wasn&#39;t working anyway. <br/>
<br/>
So does anyone have any  other fab ideas for helping this mom play <br/>
ability appropriate number games that might help with the one to one <br/>
correlation?<br/>
<br/>
Geez this is long. I&#39;m putting my second question in a separate post.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
