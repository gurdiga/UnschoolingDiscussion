<br/>
Help her plan ahead.  If you know she wants to watch Arthur (or whatever) <br/>
when it&#39;s nearly time, see if she needs the bathroom or some food before it <br/>
starts.<br/>
<br/>
If she sees the clock and knows she needs to watch RIGHT THEN, and if it&#39;s a <br/>
show you yourself approve of enough to want to encourage it, maybe you should <br/>
just breathe through your resentment, imagine YOU being her, and imagine how <br/>
cool it would have felt if you, at seven, could have asked for food delivery, <br/>
and how cool it would have been if your mom had smilingly brought you food.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not PBS, tell her to get food at the commercial.  If it&#39;s taped, <br/>
pause it and help her get food.<br/>

What exactly upsets you about getting food for your daughter? Do you think <br/>
at her age she should be getting it herself?<br/>
<br/>
At 7 I don&#39;t see this as much of a problem. It&#39;s not like hours on end of <br/>
waiting on her. Maybe if you can meet her half way it would help you some. <br/>
Make something and then ask her if she can come and get it. I serve my kids <br/>
all day long and usually just put everything on the pass through counter <br/>
from kitchen to playroom. That&#39;s usually where they are when they eat and <br/>
Joseph and Sierra take turns serving each other. Even Alyssa is starting to <br/>
try but with her height, the other two usually help her out. We&#39;ve had a few <br/>
plates dumped on the floor with her trying to help.<br/>
<br/>
If the kids ask for something and I&#39;m in the kitchen, I&#39;ll get it for them. <br/>
If I&#39;m not in the kitchen, I&#39;ll ask if it&#39;s something they can get. Like <br/>
from the pantry or I always keep their drinks in their glasses on the <br/>
outside part of the fridge. Then they go and get it. And if by some chance I <br/>
want something and one of them is in the kitchen and they can get it, I&#39;ll <br/>
ask. They have always got it for me too with no problem.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; My 7yod is doing this a lot - turning on the TV then saying she is <br/>
hungry.<br/>
 I have been bringing her food and beverage when she asks.  I find I&#39;m<br/>
 feeling very resentful about this and I&#39;d like some feedback. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s easy to get resentful when we believe our children should <br/>
understand what a good life they&#39;ve got compared to what we had, but they <br/>
can&#39;t compare their life to what you lived. They can only live theirs.<br/>
The resentment comes from a place of unhappiness about our own <br/>
selves/childhood usually. But I wouldn&#39;t do things that make me resentful, <br/>
that&#39;s not honest.<br/>
I would try to understand the resentment though, try to work through it and <br/>
figure out if you can lose it.<br/>
Dialogue with her how you feel and why. Have her help come up with some <br/>
solutions. Or knowing this about your child, make sure there are foods fixed <br/>
or available by simply opening them ahead of time.<br/>
<br/>
I know a Mom that lost her child this last month. An unschooling Mom.<br/>
Think of that pain and then maybe it will seem like a privilege rather than a <br/>
chore.<br/>
If my child is asking me for food or leaving messes, it is a poignant <br/>
reminder to be grateful because they are with me and healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a snack due to being ill?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, she and her sister have both been sick and dh has been away home more<br/>
than usual.  They each had a day with a fever and really unable to get out<br/>
of bed or even be awake much.  7yod was feeling *better* but still not well.<br/>
They were watching a movie on my bed when she asked for cinnamon toast and<br/>
after I brought that to her I was thinking about crumbs in my bed and that<br/>
was when *I* started feeling resentful.<br/>
<br/>
-----snip-----I have lots of snacks and drinks that are reachable for my<br/>
sons.  The bottom<br/>
shelf of the frig is theirs along with a shelf in a low cabinet etc.  That<br/>
way they can get to snacks.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I need to rethink this one.  It appears to me that food is easy to get, but<br/>
I could ask the kids for ideas for stuff they like that they think would be<br/>
easy for them to serve to themselves.<br/>
<br/>
------snip------maybe you should<br/>
just breathe through your resentment, imagine YOU being her, and imagine how<br/>
cool it would have felt if you, at seven, could have asked for food<br/>
delivery,<br/>
and how cool it would have been if your mom had smilingly brought you<br/>
food.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is my problem.  I know that she is not doing it to annoy me.  Last<br/>
night we were watching a movie and someone suggested Popsicles.  Lisa hopped<br/>
up and brought everyone the flavor they wanted, and with a napkin.  I can<br/>
see that they are more likely to learn the joy of doing for others if I do<br/>
for them with joy.<br/>
<br/>
----snip----What exactly upsets you about getting food for your daughter? Do<br/>
you think<br/>

<br/>
Good question.  I know she is capable of getting food.  She has no problem<br/>
climbing on the counter to get chocolate chips out of the cupboard &lt;g&gt;.  I<br/>
think there are some other things going on in my life that led to one<br/>
request being that &quot;last straw&quot; for me.  Fortunately I have all of you to<br/>
whine to.  I don&#39;t think she realized that it bothered me.<br/>
<br/>
---snip----Why do you think you&#39;re choosing to feel resentful? What do you<br/>
think will<br/>
happen if your daughter continues with this pattern for awhile?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just know it will lead to her spending the rest of her life sitting in<br/>
front of the TV demanding that others bring her food!  OK, now I&#39;m laughing<br/>
a bit about the whole thing.  Thank you all for the support and ideas!<br/>
<br/>
Dh is finally home today and I think I will take a well needed break to<br/>
grocery shop and sit at a coffee shop with a book, by myself.<br/>

That&#39;s funny. Humor helps.<br/>
<br/>
Lately Joe has been teasing that he intends on gaining a whole bunch of <br/>
weight. He pokes the belly he has way out and pulls his pants way up walks <br/>
around all goofy. Sierra teases that he&#39;s turning into Santa Claus. He has <br/>
20lbs that he gains and loses every year. He can&#39;t seem to get motivated <br/>
now. Well last night I felt awful and was so hungry but nothing was tasting <br/>
right. I asked for a BK chicken sandwich and fries. For some reason when I&#39;m <br/>
sick, I love fast food. Well naturally everyone got something. Joe and I <br/>
were sitting on the couch watching CNN. I wasn&#39;t interested in the talk but <br/>
was reading the news that runs along the bottom screen. One of the stories <br/>
was the major contribution to obesity in America. Eating fast food and <br/>
sitting on the couch!!!!! Joe and I were hysterical!!!<br/>
