<div id="ygrps-yiv-85690836">thanks for all of the feedback...I&#39;d love to hear more! Just to clarify,<br/>
Monk is only going on 4 (12/2), so I&#39;m not incredibly concerned with the<br/>
pace of his learning...I was just curious as to what everyone felt about<br/>
allowing him to spell things wrong - if it might affect his ability to do it<br/>
right later. He HATES being corrected, even when he spews completely<br/>
incorrect information about ANYTHING. If I attempt to correct him, he says<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m PRETENDING it&#39;s spelled that way.&quot; And gets rather annoyed with me.<br/>
So...I think the idea of just spelling things for him when he&#39;s NOT spelling<br/>
things himself is a good one. We spent much of yesterday afternoon drawing<br/>
and painting and I would give titles to all of his work. It got to the point<br/>
where he was so interested in what I was writing that he would put two<br/>
splashes of paint on the page, say &quot;look mom, it&#39;s another leaf hopper&quot; and<br/>
demand that I write letters on the page. He&#39;s obviously ready to learn this<br/>
stuff, but maybe I need to just relax and let him go at his own pace.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again...<br/>

son that will be 4 (&nbsp; Nov 30)&nbsp; this fall.&nbsp; He also is coming up 
with very creative spellings for words.&nbsp; He is also making up scenarios and 
stories where he describes himself as a character.&nbsp; He does this off and on 
all day.&nbsp; He hasn&#39;t decided to draw pictures of his stories, just 
verbalizes everything.&nbsp; Same for the spelling-- all verbalized at this 
point.&nbsp; I&nbsp; think encouragement for what he is doing is appropriate, 
and I might say, &quot;Would you like to make a book for your story?&quot;, but I 
try&nbsp; not to focus on correct spelling too much yet.&nbsp; I think doing so 
could *spoil* the magic he is experiencing on his own.&nbsp;

elephant, but say DOG.  Instead of saying, &quot;No, that&#39;s an elephant.&quot;  We&#39;d <br/>
say, &quot;Well, that kind of dog is called an elephant.&quot;  That way we avoided <br/>
outright correction, but got the point accross.  With such a short name, Zack <br/>
didn&#39;t often mix up the letters, but he often wrote the Z and the C <br/>
backwards.  Instead of saying &quot;Do it this way,&quot; I&#39;d say, &quot;This is how I write <br/>
those letters.&quot;  Then I&#39;d show him.  We never acted like he was wrong, we <br/>
just found a way to model the correct word or letters or whatever.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Soon he&#39;ll be asking you how to spell words.  When that happens it will be <br/>
because he wants the information and it will stick longer.<br/>
<br/>
We learned to ignore spelling lessons entirely.  Tried to do some at about <br/>
age 8, but it wasn&#39;t working well.  DS was simply not interested.  OTOH he is <br/>
a perfectionist and really wants it to be right.  That meant he wasn&#39;t <br/>
willing to write anything because he didn&#39;t already know how to spell the <br/>
words correctly.  Led to lots of frustration and he simply was not willing to <br/>
do any repetitive spelling exercises.  For the last 3+ years I&#39;ve been <br/>
encouraging him to spell the words exactly the way they sound to him.  Since <br/>
the words look like they sound, it was a piece of cake for me to figure out <br/>
what he was writing and he got his thoughts down on paper/computer.  His <br/>
reading level is quite &#39;advanced&#39; and he reads constantly, so I was pretty <br/>
confident he&#39;d instinctively figure out how to spell.  I did teach him to <br/>
read phonetically, I&#39;m sure that made a difference to this approach.  <br/>
<br/>
In the last year he has started asking me how to spell words when it is <br/>
important to him to get it right.  Once he gained confidence in my ability to <br/>
read what he was writing, it made a huge difference!  Now I let him know that <br/>
his spelling is improving.  He spells most words he uses correctly and asks <br/>
for help when he doesn&#39;t have a clue.  I encourage him to write it as best he <br/>
can when I find the occasional word that is spelled incorrectly, I let him <br/>
know how it is supposed to be spelled and give him a phonics rule or nemonic <br/>
device to help him remember it next time.  I don&#39;t expect him to correct it.  <br/>
He often does so on his own, however.  We don&#39;t do repetitive drills.  It <br/>
amazes me how well it is working.<br/>
<br/>
As an interesting side note, DH is a college graduate and still spells <br/>
horrid.  When I would help him edit his term papers the joke went something <br/>
like this:<br/>
<br/>
    Me:  Honey, how do you spell &lt;fill in the blank&gt;?<br/>
    DH:  You know how I spell it, you are looking at it!<br/>
<br/>
Then I&#39;d tell him the rest of the world doesn&#39;t spell it that way.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, it was really hard to let go of the &#39;need&#39; to &#39;teach&#39; spelling.  I&#39;m <br/>
really glad we&#39;ve taken this approach, though.  It has greatly decreased the <br/>
stress in our family.  The only &#39;negative&#39; thing is a cousin that likes to <br/>
bug DS with claims that DS is stupid because he h&#39;schools.  That is <br/>
improving.  We keep reminding DS and the cousin that people learn different <br/>
things at different times and it has nothing to do with intelligence.  DS&#39;s <br/>
confidence has improved as he figures out that there are some things he has <br/>
learned/is learning way ahead of the cousin&#39;s schedule.  <br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m soooo looking forward to school starting again (NOT!).  I&#39;m sure this <br/>
cousin will be up to the same stuff.  I hear lots of phrases from him that <br/>
come directly from the NEA via his ps teacher.  Yuck!  Just one more reason <br/>
to homeschool!)<br/>
<br/>
This got long...sorry.<br/>
