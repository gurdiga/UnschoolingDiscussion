<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532194593">Mother Dance by Harriet Lerner.  This is NOT an unschooling book, but I&#39;m<br/>
finding lots of passages that apply to unschooling.  (There are also things<br/>
that would work against unschooling, but that is not the point of the book.)<br/>
<br/>
She has a chapter on food which ends with her son sneakily gorging on grapes<br/>
(which were forbidden in their home), while ignoring the desserts.<br/>
&quot;limiting a child&#39;s access to and intake of particular foods ... will<br/>
intensify the child&#39;s wish for them. ... Once the food is legalized and on<br/>
hand for the child in greater amounts than he or she can possibly be hungry<br/>
for, the child first turns to it with a vengeance and later usually loses<br/>
interest in it.&quot;  Obviously, this applies to homes where there had once been<br/>
restrictions.  If a food had never been restricted a child&#39;s reaction would<br/>
be different.<br/>
<br/>
There is a quote from the section on sex that I think could apply to just<br/>
about anything.  This basic idea has been promoted on this list over and<br/>
over, so it isn&#39;t anything new.  Replace [sex] with sugar, TV, R rated<br/>
movies, or whatever else you think your child should never be exposed to.<br/>
She isn&#39;t saying to tell your teen daughter, sure go have sex.  She is<br/>
saying that if the parent is operating on the assumption that it is always<br/>
wrong to have sex before marraige, the child cannot ever make the decision<br/>
not to on their own.  The child will benefit if the parent accepts that some<br/>
people do have sex before marraige and has open discussions with the child<br/>
on the issue.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When the dictate to say no to [sex] is founded on fear and external<br/>
pressure, it&#39;s not a true choice.  It is also less likely to be maintianed<br/>
if the girl doesn&#39;t experience herself as having the power and agency ever<br/>
to give an affirming yes.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018180348">It&#39;s been a long time since I read that book, and I don&#39;t remember most<br/>
of what she said, but one thing has stuck in my mind.  She was talking<br/>
about how people say that motherhood is the hardest job in the world and<br/>
she said, &quot;It&#39;s not a job, it&#39;s a relationship.&quot;<br/>
