<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917139593">Public School Horror<br/>
<br/>
By Jen Garrison Stuber (playing off Quinn Cotton&#39;s original--which was<br/>
every bit as ignorant)<br/>
<br/>
You know how there are fascist states throughout the world? Well, in<br/>
my country, we have numerous &quot;public schools&quot; humming in the cities, the<br/>
country, and suburbia. They&#39;re almost as scary as the fascist ones in<br/>
some ways -- and they definitely have some traits in common with them.<br/>
When we first moved to North Carolina, the houses next to us, behind<br/>
us, and diagonally across the street all contained children who<br/>
mysteriously left home each day, and mothers with glazed expressions on their <br/>
faces<br/>
who piled into cars, disappearing from sun up to sun down. The whole<br/>
set-up of moms driving off with their infant, toddler, and school-age<br/>
kids to give their care and education over to strangers gave me the<br/>
willies, and that was before I even had one of my own.<br/>
Middle class areas seem to be magnets for little suburban public<br/>
schools. Even though there are magnet schools all over North Carolina,<br/>
somehow I don&#39;t picture your basic Ballantyne babe risking breaking a<br/>
nail on a chalkboard while substitute teaching, or skipping a tennis<br/>
set for an educational excursion to the sewage plant as a chaperone.<br/>
Likewise, I doubt many Belmont moms miss a beat packing those kids off<br/>
to public school. It&#39;s the middle class that gets suckered into the<br/>
myth that mothers and older children cannot survive being together all day<br/>
without somebody being strangled.<br/>
What&#39;s scary is that a lot of the public school faithful are as fueled<br/>
by a fanatical, state-based belief in their mission as fascists, and<br/>
seem to be just about as brainwashed. Sometimes I even wonder if<br/>
they&#39;re a manufactured race along the lines of the Stepford wives in Ira<br/>
Levin&#39;s book, but assembled in schoolhouses instead of family basements. Like<br/>
the Stepford robots, they&#39;re programmed to send their children into<br/>
the arms of strangers, only in this case it&#39;s their role as the Ultimate<br/>
Working Mothers.<br/>
Other times I feel like the heroine in another famous horror story by<br/>
Levin, Rosemary&#39;s Baby, at that chilling moment when she puts together<br/>
the anagram &quot;All of Them Witches&quot; and realizes it refers to her<br/>
seemingly harmless neighbors. Some of the public school moms (PSMs)<br/>
are kind of witch-y, with the professionally hair and the dry-cleaned<br/>
skirts because pants on females are not business attire, but the description<br/>
that really applies to this coven is &quot;All of Them Followers.&quot;<br/>
They&#39;re not only fascist in their conviction that their calling is<br/>
state mandated, public schoolers also often have a broad one-size-fits-all<br/>
streak. Rather than convince their neighbors that the school provides<br/>
a superior education, though, they commit legislation, sacrificing their<br/>
own freedoms, and those of their neighbors, to teach their kids. I&#39;ve<br/>
known one or two to go to private schools as an excuse to get out of<br/>
public school hell, but the true martyrs keep right on sending their<br/>
children to windowless buildings with violent children, drugs, sex,<br/>
and alcohol.<br/>
Historically, children are just not meant to be separated. It&#39;s<br/>
unnatural. Keeping the kids at home worked in the Stone Age and right<br/>
on through to the past 100 years, but cave women hadn&#39;t been convinced by<br/>
&quot;experts&quot; that they &quot;weren&#39;t qualified&quot; to teach their own children<br/>
life, and they had a broader range of skills not afforded women who<br/>
train in a specialized area.<br/>
Kids need their parents to be adults, and to take responsibility for<br/>
their educations. They don&#39;t need to be sent away to institutions<br/>
where sexual predators, homi/suicidal kids with guns, and drug dealers have<br/>
access to them and they have no escape. Were you in the group of cool<br/>
jock kids? No? You were a studious child who was picked on for being a<br/>
&quot;nerd&quot; when the stated reason for going to school was to learn? How&#39;d<br/>
that go? Like _Lord of the Flies_? &#39;Nuff said.<br/>
All young animals must be exposed to adults modeling adult behavior.<br/>
Believe me, I&#39;m aware that public school families get their children<br/>
together, since there&#39;s a zillion minivans on the road between 3 and<br/>
8,  and on the weekends, but being with a few kids from across town once a<br/>
week doesn&#39;t do the trick. It takes serious community for developing<br/>
humans to catch on to the nuances of adult behavior and to have a<br/>
chance<br/>
to make enough friends. I just can&#39;t see public school providing<br/>
adequate socialization, when children are sequestered away from anyone<br/>
who isn&#39;t within 8 months of their same age.<br/>
One of my neighboring former PSMs sent her two kids to public school<br/>
through eighth grade, then took them out when the they were threatened<br/>
at knife point in the john. The boy ended up opening his own business,<br/>
and the girl got her PhD at 22.<br/>
Yes, I know that public school kids have joined the National Honors<br/>
Society, but for every public schooler who aces a spelling bee,<br/>
there&#39;s some poor child being &quot;instructed&quot; by a &quot;teacher&quot; who&#39;s barely<br/>
literate herself, and only teaches &quot;to the test.&quot; Teachers in the public <br/>
school<br/>
system are required to have certification and college degrees, but<br/>
none of them are required to actually teach their charges anything.<br/>
What&#39;s really scary about public schools is what it can do to the<br/>
sanity of a child and parent deluded into thinking it&#39;s their civic duty. No<br/>
child was ever meant to be trapped in a windowless school all day with<br/>
 other children old enough to spell &quot;homicide.&quot;<br/>
So if new neighbors move in next door and you notice that the kids<br/>
leave don&#39;t return until after dark and mom carries a brief case, be afraid.<br/>
Be very afraid.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-217534047">She wrote a retraction, too:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dear Editor,<br/>
I would like to retract my earlier revision of Quinn Cotton&#39;s<br/>
&quot;Homeschooling Horror.&quot;  Reading more of her work, I stumbled upon the<br/>
below.<br/>
<br/>
I did not realize earlier that she finds her child to be &quot;bratty,<br/>
berserk, annoying&quot; and &quot;a major hassle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She must not have realized that those of us who homeschool don&#39;t need<br/>
to practice offensive parenting, trying to undo the pathologies that<br/>
7-9 waking hours of institutionalization creates in children.<br/>
<br/>
It stands to reason, then, that of course she wouldn&#39;t understand that<br/>
most homeschoolers find our children to be delightful human beings<br/>
(often--gasp--more delightful than our former colleagues).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Come on, we know what these teacher workdays are really for, and it&#39;s not<br/>
just to catch up on the grading. They exist because the teachers want a<br/>
break from our bratty, berserk, annoying kids -- but the problem is, we<br/>
parents do too, and we&#39;re paying major bucks for it in the form of either<br/>
taxes or tuition. We&#39;re the employers here, yet the employees get to<br/>
set the<br/>
schedule in another reverse twist from most professions, and we&#39;re<br/>
supposed<br/>
to just go along with it.<br/>
<br/>
The only people who really benefit from teacher workdays are the teachers,<br/>
natch, and the students who get to sleep in. For many households, what<br/>
to do<br/>
with the kids is a major hassle, and often the solution seems to be to<br/>
either leave them home alone and pray this isn&#39;t the day they discover<br/>
matches or porn sites, or just drag them along on the job. If you look<br/>
around on teacher workdays you&#39;ll see little girls hanging out in the<br/>
grocery store aisles while their fathers stock the shelves and guys<br/>
slumped<br/>
over Game Boys behind their mothers&#39; desks. &quot;<br/>
