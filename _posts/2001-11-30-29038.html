<div id="ygrps-yiv-943728444">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Also, I&#39;ve found that when they have helped fix<br/>
do the shopping and <br/>
then<br/>
helped fix them they are more inclined to eat them. <br/>
We make homemade<br/>
granola and healthy muffins and stuf and they devore<br/>
them because, in <br/>
part,<br/>
they are part of the process.  They&#39;ve been either<br/>
sitting on the <br/>
counter or<br/>
standing on stools to help since they were old enough<br/>
to sit unaided.  <br/>
So,<br/>
they &quot;own&quot; the foods and thus eat things other kids<br/>
might not.<br/>

Oh, I wish, I wish this had worked for me. My dd<br/>
was/is also always part of the process. Unfortunately,<br/>
the older she gets, the more finicky she gets! And<br/>
this isn&#39;t just with &#39;healthy&#39; things but also with a<br/>
lot of desserty sweet things. She will happily help me<br/>
make apple cake, but she won&#39;t touch it with a barge<br/>
pole when it comes time to eat it :-). <br/>

I have a question. You seem to be very concerned about what foods you all <br/>
eat. I don&#39;t understand the degree of it, but I respect what you think you <br/>
are trying to do. The only reason why I say &quot;think&quot; is because none of us <br/>
really know if my kids will be any less healthier than yours when they are <br/>
all 50. That&#39;s a giime on all accounts.<br/>
So, have you or will you in the future let your kids eat at a restaurant or <br/>
someone else&#39;s house? Can they attend a birthday party at some kid friendly <br/>
establishment or go to a carnival and have stuff there? Will they be able to <br/>
eat what they would like to try at any of these places?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-727904058">Mary, <br/>
Yes to all of those questions! LOL They can try anything (well, almost - I really can&#39;t agree to eating raw seafood no matter what at this age, because their systems aren&#39;t mature enough to properly handle the bacteria) when they are out and about. They do like to try things like carnival food, but they also have learned that much of that kind of stuff makes them sick, so they will often stick to the things we bring in the car for snacks all on their own. At birthday parties, they&#39;ll usually request very small slices of cake. Restaurants - we do eat at those occasionally, but skip the fast-food places. Fresh fish is a favorite for our menu choices. We all love Chinese food, and splurge on that about once every 3/4 months. That&#39;s just something I&#39;ve never learned to cook! &lt;g&gt; The boys go out to eat every Sunday lunch with my parents to buffet-style places. I&#39;m not a t-totaler with food choices by any means, but I do think that the majority (all before age 2) of the food we eat should be as natural and additive-free as possible. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and your pantry can&#39;t be any worse than my parents&#39;!!! LOL Chef Boy R Dee, meals-in-a-box or can, meat sticks or spreads, white bread only, etc, etc. Nothing fresh to be found in the whole house! LOL Then again, they both work full-time and don&#39;t eat at home much, anyway. Interestingly, their health has declined very much in the last few years since my mom stopped cooking every day and went to work. <br/>
