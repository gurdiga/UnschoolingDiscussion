<div id="ygrps-yiv-617515531">**If you had a child who loves to read and do<br/>
workbooks, would you school at home instead?**<br/>
<br/>
No. Why would one have anything to do with the other?<br/>
<br/>
I have always unschooled kids who love to read and love workbooks. (heck, I <br/>
love puzzle books, and that&#39;s how they use workbooks.) That doesn&#39;t mean they <br/>
have the slightest interest in school at home. <br/>
<br/>
Owning and using workbooks doesn&#39;t make it a schooling home or an unschooling <br/>
home. Who chooses and who uses, that makes it a schooling or an unschooling <br/>
home. I buy workbooks on request (or occasionally without a request when I <br/>
find unused copies dirt cheap at rummage sales etc.) That&#39;s my last <br/>
involvement with them unless I&#39;m requested to help, or if I step on them and <br/>
need to get them removed to a shelf somewhere. I don&#39;t assign work. I don&#39;t <br/>
structure a sequence of study - I don&#39;t care if they choose to do the <br/>
multiplication book before the addition book or choose a third grade book at <br/>
age 10. I don&#39;t grade and I don&#39;t correct unless plied with chocolate and/or <br/>
kisses. :)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand at all why &quot;loves to read&quot; was put in there as a possible <br/>
reason to school at home, or a negative for an unschooler? My unschooled kids <br/>
count reading as one of the biggest benefits of unschooling. They&#39;ve seen <br/>
what happens to the reading desire of schooled kids (even homeschooled <br/>
schooled kids) who read on someone else&#39;s schedule and someone else&#39;s list. <br/>
They  count freedom to read what they want as long as they want a great gift. <br/>
They know the joy of being able to say &quot;This books stinks&quot; and not having to <br/>
finish it, as well. They can spend as long as they need to finish a difficult <br/>
book, or race through without waiting to answer comprehension questions. And <br/>
they LOVE the experience of reading a great book first, of handing it to <br/>
someone else (usually me) with the directive &quot;You have GOT to read this book!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Last night all three of my still home kids were sprawled around the front <br/>
room at 11 pm reading. Melissa &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;, Sarah finished Bunnicula <br/>
and started on the second book I can&#39;t remember the name of, Pat was in the <br/>
middle of Holes - Sarah read her copy last week so now we&#39;re waiting on him <br/>
to go see the movie. <br/>
<br/>
Sarah is lately the &quot;designated reader&quot; for a younger friend of Pat&#39;s who&#39;s <br/>
not reading yet, when they play games that need something read without the <br/>
other players knowing about it. Way cool for her after her long struggles <br/>
with reading, to have people casually asking her for help knowing she can <br/>
give it.  :)<br/>

the other month. Needless to say it was very interesting. ;oP Luckily there enough<br/>
other topics that I enjoyed myself. Plus I got to meet Joanna (from this list!) and<br/>
pick up my order from Fun Books.<br/>
<br/>
What I found very interesting about Jesse Wise is that she seems to take FULL credit<br/>
for her kids being smart. She started teaching them phonics etc early so of course they<br/>
were advanced readers. She followed a classical education so of course they went on<br/>
to get advanced degrees. Everything was about what she did and very little about<br/>
what her kids learned on their own. She really seemed to take the approach that kids<br/>
are empty vessels that need to be filled up. It took all I could do not to snort <br/>
out loud at some of the things that she said (had to be good as my really good friend<br/>
who was with me is using the Well Trained Mind).<br/>
<br/>
What really bugged me was that she really made it sound like it is completely up to the<br/>
parents...if they do everything like she tells you to do, you will have smart well trained<br/>
kids. So how many parents are beating themselves up because their kids do not take well<br/>
to this method? And worse how many kids are subjected to this against their will.<br/>
<br/>
The one nice thing about listening to her speak is that it really hit home that unschooling<br/>
is really right to me. There was just so much I wanted to debate with her about. It<br/>
just all seemed so wrong to me....<br/>

Conor loves books but read later. He led us out the school system and <br/>
into unschooling. Casey actually did start writing at 3. She asked to <br/>
learn cursive at 4. I used to bribe her occasionally with the promise <br/>
of a new workbook. It never led me to school-at-home with her <br/>
however. I still just followed her interests, kept her well supplied <br/>
with materials, answered her questions and followed her pace. Still <br/>
unschooling. <br/>

<br/>
LOL True story...Casey asked me to pick up The Iliad for her at the <br/>
library yesterday. It had been referenced in another book we were <br/>
reading and she wanted to check it out. I doubt she&#39;ll read it alone, <br/>
or read past a few pages even. But she&#39;ll see what it is. She&#39;ll have <br/>
exposure to Homer and Greek epics. I also brought home the Clif notes <br/>
in case she wants to just hear the story. I found a DK children&#39;s <br/>
illustrated version of The Odyssey to look at too. Conor grabbed that <br/>
up and said he had been wanting to read it. Huh? Surprise for me. LOL<br/>
<br/>
FWIW We make no distinction here between books on tape, reading alone <br/>
or reading together. They all get the information from the books and <br/>
into our heads.<br/>

ONLY be interested in reading and writing practice.  But my son read at 4<br/>
(technically -- it was just a few weeks shy of his 5th birthday), and had<br/>
been putting letters in various sequences before that.  If anything, his<br/>
learning to read sent our homeschooling strongly in the unschooling<br/>
direction.  <br/>
<br/>
I figured if he could learn to read when all I really recall us doing was<br/>
playing and having fun, then why did I need a curriculum at all?  Somebody<br/>
gave us some of the little A Becka books when he had just learned to read,<br/>
and although he read signs and books, the newspaper, and cereal boxes, he<br/>
refused to read those little books.  I could see why!  Curriculum is SO<br/>
stilted.<br/>

years.  By novels, I am saying books on the same difficulty level as<br/>
&quot;Holes&quot; or &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.  I&#39;m not exactly sure when she started<br/>
reading, but she was going strong when she was only 3.  There is nothing<br/>
that I could have done to have stopped this.  She was reading board<br/>
books at 2.  It is in her nature to look at a word and just know what it<br/>
says.  I think that it is genetic since I was that way as well.  I toyed<br/>
with the idea of getting various curriculums for her when she was<br/>
younger, the thing that stopped me (then) was that I could see how Zoë<br/>
refused to ever learn how to do anything unless she was interested in<br/>
it.  She already knew at least half the things in all the curriculums<br/>
that I looked over for kids in grades k- about 5th.  The rest of the<br/>
things I knew that she would learn them if AND ONLY IF she ever had a<br/>
need and desire to learn them.  She does so many new things because her<br/>
reading allows her to read about things that spark an interest in her.<br/>
<br/>
Learning at someone else&#39;s schedule doesn&#39;t mesh with my daughter.  For<br/>
example, she has no desire to ever ride a bicycle or skip.  These are<br/>
things that kindergartners all need to do, or be threatened with failing<br/>
their grade (this happened to me even though I later skipped two grades<br/>
due to academics).  Are riding a bicycle and skipping really truly<br/>
important to every single adult?  I don&#39;t think so, so why does our<br/>
society try to make all children identical?<br/>
<br/>
So, your answer is: NO.  My daughter&#39;s learning to read at an early age<br/>
did not turn our family into a school-at-home family.<br/>

because I witnessed something that my son learned to do on his own, because <br/>
of his own desire. <br/>
