<div id="ygrps-yiv-329627574">I hear you!  and the voice in my head too ;)<br/>
<br/>
I have recently consciously made the effort to just let go sometimes.  Even<br/>
if my kids are completely emptying the bookshelves or arguing or whatever, I<br/>
just tell them they are going to have to figure it out for themselves.  I<br/>
can&#39;t always fix everything or be a constant moderator.  Sometimes they are<br/>
hitting each other, but I tell them if they don&#39;t like it, the 2 of them are<br/>
going to have to figure out a better way to play together or decide to play<br/>
apart.  Mommy needs some time to herself!  I&#39;d rather have 2 hours to myself<br/>
totally absorbed in a magazine or whatever and have to reassemble their room<br/>
later, than to fight for 2 hours and keep it tidy.  So far no one has bled<br/>
or broken anything.  They have gotten very loud and frustrated sometimes,<br/>
but I choose not to take the bait and tell them to figure it out.  It felt<br/>
so mean the first few times but they can actually figure it out now after<br/>
hearing me say over and over &#39;what do you want to be different? Ok, so tell<br/>
him that!&#39; etc.  I did give direction I guess, but I refused to get up from<br/>
my spot.  Now they have figured out how to play either together, side by<br/>
side, or that they also can choose to get up and go find something else to<br/>
do on their own.  And then of course sometimes they don&#39;t ;)  I think the<br/>
biggest thing that helped was figuring out what was the time of day I needed<br/>
the break most.  From 2-4 pm, I hit a wall.  I am tired, cranky, short<br/>
tempered and mean.  So, I interact much more with my kids at other times and<br/>
save that time for &#39;leave me alone&#39; time.<br/>
The other thing is - I *know* they are capable of getting along and enjoying<br/>
each other.  They do it very well when I am not around, like when I swap<br/>
date night with a friend or something.  I return to wonderful compliments<br/>
about how kind and gentle they are etc.  I no longer try to participate in<br/>
getting them ready for bed and to sleep because if I do, they fight and<br/>
argue and stay awake forever.  With my dh, they read some books, brush<br/>
teeth, turn out the lights, sing a few songs, and fall asleep 10 minutes<br/>
later or less.  Mommy is the &#39;safe&#39; zone where they can let it all out and<br/>
test etc.  <br/>
Now what I *haven&#39;t* figured out is how to get them to cooperate with me<br/>
when I need to get in & out of a store or whatever.  Charles can take them<br/>
all day on errands and they get along great.  For me, they fight argue, beg,<br/>
whine.  Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I sit down<br/>
&gt; with a cup of tea after playing with them or serving lunch and cleaning the<br/>
&gt; kitchen, I can&#39;t even finish it without getting up several times to deal<br/>
&gt; with something.  I don&#39;t suppose that this is unsual for a mother with 3<br/>
&gt; young children, and I guess that&#39;s the crux of it.  I&#39;m thinking that unless<br/>
&gt; I can come up with some money for an occasional sitter or mother&#39;s helper,<br/>
&gt; then this is it for awhile.  I can&#39;t tell you how much I wish I could truly<br/>
&gt; relax for a WHOLE day! LOL<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, sorry to overwhelm everyone with my long and intense post.  I&#39;m kind<br/>
&gt; of embarrassed now.  Oh well, I&#39;m embarrassed even when I&#39;m all alone with<br/>
&gt; myself.  I hear this voice in my head, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?  Breathe.<br/>
&gt; How can this be so hard?&quot;<br/>

-----------------<br/>
<br/>
Poor kids, though.  If an adult can&#39;t figure it out, how can little kids?<br/>
<br/>
My parents raised two cousins along with me and my sister.  The ages went <br/>
like this (and so forth along)  10, 9, 7, 6. My sister and I were 9 and 6 in that <br/>
lineup.<br/>
<br/>
The second cousin (7) was abusive to the rest of us. Mean, sneaky, she hit. <br/>
There was no &quot;figuring it out.&quot;  We needed to be defended from her and <br/>
protected from her.  So because of my experience with that, I bristle when mother <br/>
blythely announced that they will let their kids work out their differences.<br/>
<br/>
Each child should have peace and safety in her own home.<br/>
I just wrote this earlier today somewhere else. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There are hurts that don&#39;t bleed.<br/>

<br/>
I recommend not saying ANY thing over and over. Say it a new way every time.<br/>
And maybe you could get up from &quot;your spot&quot; and give them some food, a drink <br/>
of juice, a hug. <br/>

<br/>
Are you less guarded and formal with your husband than with strangers?<br/>
I know I am.   <br/>
<br/>
But just because he&#39;s the safest person in my life doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m testing <br/>
him when I let thing out.  I doubt your kids are &quot;testing you.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I noticed in your sig line your kids are ages 2 and 4? Thats really <br/>
really young. I think too young to expect them to work things out on <br/>
their own or left unsupervised for long periods of time. I would <br/>
think at this age they really need you right there helping them work <br/>
out disagreements, helping brainstorm solutions that they both like, <br/>
engaging them in play. My son is almost 8, and his niece just turned <br/>
9, and i still have to help them work things out sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I only have the one child, so i might be way off base, but i think <br/>
there has to be a better solution, when one child is hitting another, <br/>
to say &quot;if you don&#39;t like it leave the room&quot;...i think first and <br/>
foremost i would want to immediately stop the hitting behavior. <br/>
Sandra has made some good comments in the past about siblings hitting <br/>
each other. Its really important to create a safe zone where this <br/>
stuff is taken seriously (esp if its usually one doing most of the <br/>
hitting)and talked about, and stopped. That being said, i have 7 <br/>
brothers and sisters and i know that kids can get rough with each <br/>
other. But i just think toddler and preschool age kids need a great <br/>
deal of supervision.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, i don&#39;t have 2 preschoolers so maybe i am wrong here, but i <br/>
think your expectations are too high. It seems you are saying (and i <br/>
admittedly havent read the entire thread)that you want to be able to <br/>
be totally uninterrupted for two hours, to be able to focus on you <br/>
during that time. I dont think you&#39;ll get the kind of mommy time you <br/>
want until your kids are older. I&#39;ve also found that my son and his <br/>
niece have much better behavior and get along more effectively when i <br/>
am there with them, helping them figure stuff out, rather than when <br/>
they are in a room by themselves left to their own devices. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think if something &quot;felt mean&quot; to you, you should listen to that <br/>
instinct and really look at *why* it felt mean. The above statement <br/>
reminds me of the justification for letting a baby cry himself to <br/>
sleep &quot;it felt mean to let him cry but after several nights of him <br/>
knowing we werent picking him up, he stopped crying and went to sleep <br/>
on his own. It worked!&quot; But did it really? I think that you can give <br/>
the same kind of info you were giving them (&quot;Tell him what you want <br/>
to be different&quot;)but present it in a more positive way. I encourage <br/>
my niece and my son to work things out themselves, but i also try to <br/>
model some good communication strategies (&quot;Anna, you seem to saying <br/>
you feel its not fair that seamus is taking more turns at the game <br/>
than you, and now you want to stop playing? Seamus, you seem to be <br/>
saying that the reason you took more turns is because anna said it <br/>
was ok, and now you feel she is punishing you for that. How can we <br/>
work this out? What do you think would be fair to both of you?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; did give direction I guess, but I refused to get up from my spot.<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>You seem to be saying that you don&#39;t care how they work things out <br/>
just as long as they don&#39;t bug you while you are getting your <br/>
downtime. I can see how, with a mom who is stressed with very young <br/>
kids, who feels she needs this time to stay sane, it might be a <br/>
better strategy than, say, spanking them into submission, or putting <br/>
them in time out, or locking them out of the house. But it doesnt <br/>
seem ideal. Can maybe you take them somewhere every day, like the <br/>
park, and read while they play on the equiptment? When my son was a <br/>
bit younger, and i wanted some time to read, or just zone out a <br/>
little, i would take him to Chuck E Cheese, or McDonalds Playplace, <br/>
and let him play while i focused on my magazine or whatever. Your <br/>
kids might be less likely to fight if they are in a new, interesting, <br/>
neutral location like that. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, i really do feel for you. I can only imagine how <br/>
exhausting it can be to have more than one. By the end of each week, <br/>
i am ready to send my niece back to her home, so we can have piece <br/>
and quiet again. <br/>

<br/>
I agree.  <br/>
<br/>
Mine are 12, 15 and (as of yesterday) 18 and I&#39;m willing to help them work <br/>
things out everytime, because they don&#39;t need to be harrassed by someone they <br/>
didn&#39;t choose to live with.<br/>

<br/>
Good idea!<br/>
<br/>
Then they don&#39;t have the space and ownership problems they have at home.<br/>
<br/>
We used to meet other families at parks sometimes just so we didn&#39;t have to <br/>
negotiate which family&#39;s rules or stuff or sharing traditions or whatever to go <br/>
by.  Neutral space, neutral rules, and LOTS of room to wander away to avoid <br/>
something or get over frustration.<br/>

I do let them work things out at times but it&#39;s usually when there&#39;s a minor spat going on. About half the time they work it out, if it escalates to yelling I step in and help them come up with solutions. If there&#39;s hitting, everything stops. The one hit gets hugs while the one that hits goes to their room to calm done and the toy that was used (so often the case) gets put  up for the day.

They&#39;ve only got a few years practice at living and usually not the experience to negotiate sometimes complicated situations.

  I do fight for me time sometimes and unless I can get right out of the house it rarely works. If I&#39;m there, they need me and that&#39;s just how it works. The funny thing, when I give up the fight and surrender...It gets sooo much better. We have fun and I can just be myself with them. <br/>

I can be a good mom.  On one hand, I desperately want to enjoy my children<br/>

time trying to figure out how to escape them because mothering is<br/>
overwhelming for me.  I can handle snuggling really well, but they just<br/>
don&#39;t want to snuggle all day.  I can read 15 books in a row, I can turn on<br/>
the hose, I can get Barbie&#39;s clothes on & off.  I think I fake it pretty<br/>
well.  In reality I still am just not comfortable with my role.  I had the<br/>
idea and strong picture of being a perfect parent and I didn&#39;t realize until<br/>
my babies were here that it had nothing to do with actual children.  Now<br/>
they are here, they are amazing and I love them intensely, but so often I<br/>
wish I could watch them through a window so I wouldn&#39;t have to interact with<br/>
them.  How do I fix that?<br/>
