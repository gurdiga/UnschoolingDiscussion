<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779131893">&lt;&lt; Hey, at least youll get to wear a sexy red dress and really high heels! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Red Satin<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Really high heels are on the banned list for sliding down the inflatable <br/>
slide (so Holly and I read in the picture-card instructions for getting out <br/>
of the plane in case of emergency).  No spike heels on the inflatable slides. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And one picture said don&#39;t open the emergency door if it looks like hell <br/>
outside (jagged debris, smoke or flames).<br/>
