<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093648669">I think I know what is best for me to do right now. I think I had better take a big old break from posting and just read for a while and see if I can understand how to go about this better. I think I will re-read things and go over more information on unschooling again at the group site and so on, until I feel confident that I will be able to post messages that are more aligned with how things are done here. I just don&#39;t have it down yet. Never belonged to a group like this before and it takes some getting use to. <br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
