<div id="ygrps-yiv-935247943">This is where I live right now!  I just moved here in June from Central MA<br/>
and so far I like it a lot.  I am only about 20 min from Amherst!<br/>
And--housing is unbelievably cheap here compared to the rest of the state.<br/>

*********************************<br/>
<br/>
I lived in Boston as a child and teenager and years later went to college in<br/>
Western Mass. in &quot;the happy valley&quot; as it is sometimes called.  Western<br/>
Mass. was a great place to live.   My stepfather is living there now and<br/>
moved there from Cambridge to get away from the things you seem to want to<br/>
leave.  There are a lot of small and larger, village-y like towns and five<br/>
major colleges (Amherst, Smith, Hampshire, UMass and My. Holyoke).  I lived<br/>
in both Northampton and in Amherst and there is a large college pop. but the<br/>
locals have a firm standing.  Unless it&#39;s changed a lot, you don&#39;t feel<br/>
overrun by the college pop.   I gave my step-father a book named _Home<br/>
Town_ by Tracy Kidder, that is about Northampton.   Reading it convinced my<br/>
step-father&#39;s wife (my mother is no longer alive) to check out the area.  I<br/>
have read it and don&#39;t know exactly what did this, but it is a good book.<br/>
There are a lot of possibilities in that area and it is beautiful;<br/>
mountains, valleys,  great swimming watering holes in hidden bits of the<br/>
forests, a huge variety of culture and of people...  I would love to move<br/>
back there.  I don&#39;t know about the local hschooling laws there though.<br/>
