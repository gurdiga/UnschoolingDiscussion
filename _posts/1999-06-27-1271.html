<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855732557">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
A little birdie (hi Linda!) told me the list had calmed down and was no <br/>
longer a danger to my poor overstuffed mail box :-)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my intro:  I stumbled across unschooling in AOL&#39;s homeschooling forum <br/>
about 5 years ago and my almost 8 yo daughter Kathryn has been benefiting <br/>
ever since.  We live not far from Boston.  I was a software <br/>
engineer/technical writer in my former life and now I spend a lot of time <br/>
playing on the computer.  My husband decided to make a midlife career change <br/>
and is going back to school for Athletic Administration.  And my daughter is <br/>
busy exploring Nickelodeon after mining Cartoon Network for a couple of <br/>
months, in between drawing, writing, playing, talking and generally being a <br/>
kid.<br/>
