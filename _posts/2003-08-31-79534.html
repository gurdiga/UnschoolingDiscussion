&gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt;is, so a 2 year commitment to him is like a 6 year commitment to you. What<br/>
&gt; &gt;if you signed up for something you realized you didn&#39;t like after a couple<br/>
&gt; &gt;of months? How would you feel if your husband insisted you stick with it <br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt;the next 6 years because you signed up for it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I totally agree with what everyone is saying on this, but what about <br/>
&gt; following through on something you commit yourself to?  What if he <br/>
&gt; gets a job and signs a two year contract to work for someone, he <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t just quit, because he signed a contract to work for that <br/>
&gt; person.  This kind of speaks to a real life situation.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand your fears, but think of it this way: if he were in that <br/>
situation, it&#39;d be a real-world situation, and there he&#39;d be. (And really, there <br/>
aren&#39;t that many of those in the world.) In this case, it&#39;s a pretend situation, <br/>
because he COULD quit. Why not let him have that opportunity if he wants.<br/>
<br/>
There might be an out on the whole program. If not, he&#39;ll still have the <br/>
materials, and without the pressure, he might or might not be able to use them as <br/>
resources for studying photography the way he wants to. He can take a lot of <br/>
pictures, get better, and use those materials to learn how to make them better <br/>
or to market them. Or maybe he&#39;ll do something else entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Thirteen is awfully young to commit to two years, much less what he wants to <br/>
do for the rest of his life.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, both of you have learned something really valuable here: sometimes <br/>
before making a long, expensive commitment, it&#39;s a good idea to explore other <br/>
options, and really think about how you want to do something. <br/>
