<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591294659">Hello all,<br/>
Well it&#39;s about time I introduce myself, I have been reading all of your posts and you have helped me tremendously to trust my children&#39;s natural desire to learn.  I have a 4 year old and an 11 month old and have always known that I wanted to homeschool, and well I have stumbled upon unschooling in my research and I am glad that I have found it.  It&#39;s what we have been doing all along and well it works so why stop a good thing.    Anyway, I wanted to comment on phrases, Kiele and I use this phrase often, &quot; I help you, you help me, things get done so easily&quot;  I think it&#39;s from Blue&#39;s Clues.  It helps when she doesn&#39;t want to clean up her toys or we just say it when she has offered to help me with everyday chores.  It&#39;s a nice way to get things done too!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  One thing my MIL taught me is to make it more miserable for the kids<br/>
  when they&#39;re doing something you don&#39;t want them to do. For example,<br/>
  we&#39;ve had trouble with scissors in our house this year with my daughter<br/>
  and her cousin. It started when they cut off my daughter&#39;s long<br/>
  beautiful hair. They also cut the cord on the blinds, and cut up a few<br/>
  things in the house. In short order they were banned from scissors.<br/>
  Recently they were doing a craft with our Japanese student, and they<br/>
  were left with scissors, and alas, again cut something. This time our<br/>
  futon chair cover. They are 4 and 5 years old - so they&#39;re certainly old<br/>
  enough to know that this isn&#39;t a good choice. I got mad at them and then<br/>
  I told them if they cannot make good choices when no one is watching<br/>
  them, then they would have to be watched all the time. I made them stick<br/>
  right by my side. When I was working on the computer they sat on the<br/>
  floor beside me reading a book. Then I made them come downstairs to get<br/>
  a load of laundry. We&#39;d sit in the family room to fold it and I let them<br/>
  watch TV while I did it - but I would purposefully get up right when<br/>
  they were really getting into it and say, &quot;Okay. Time to go into the<br/>
  kitchen.&quot; Or wherever. They didn&#39;t dare complain because they knew the<br/>
  gravity of what they had done and knew they didn&#39;t have any room for<br/>
  negotiation. We only had to do this for about 3 hours until they begged<br/>
  me to trust them again. So we did it for the next 3 hours in a little<br/>
  more limited sense. The lesson stuck. We haven&#39;t had a problem with<br/>
  scissors for a long time. <br/>
<br/>
  When my husband and his siblings weren&#39;t getting along my MIL would make<br/>
  them hold hands or sit on chairs with their knees touching, until they<br/>
  talked and solved whatever the problem was. I&#39;m actually quite amazed at<br/>
  how they get along in his family. They just were plain not allowed to be<br/>
  unkind to each other. It doesn&#39;t mean that they didn&#39;t have<br/>
  disagreements - but unkindness was not tolerated. I hope we can do that<br/>
  in our family with our children as well.<br/>
<br/>
  Another thing that comes to my mind is to have a theme of the week or<br/>
  day, or whatever seems appropriate. Have a phrase that you ask them to<br/>
  say to you. For example, my daughter has one lately that she got from a<br/>
  book that says, &quot;I&#39;ll be happy all day if I obey.&quot; I&#39;m surprised<br/>
  actually how many times she comes back to the little quip. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
  something I started - she got it out of a book - but she has really made<br/>
  it stick in her mind and the process has made me think it might be<br/>
  worthwhile to come up with some more of those in our home. Not sure what<br/>
  they&#39;ll be yet. I&#39;d like something right now that helps them remember to<br/>
  clean up toys!! But that&#39;s an entirely different thread. :0)<br/>
<br/>
  Good for you for reaching out and asking for help. Some people just<br/>
  figure kids fight and that&#39;s life. I don&#39;t think it has to be that way.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  This is a toughie and it&#39;s something we&#39;ve worked on avoiding with our<br/>
  own <br/>
  kids.  (and its&#39; worked!) So, know that it IS possible to have kids who <br/>
  don&#39;t torment each other.  It&#39;s not something that you can just <br/>
  plug-in-and-play, but is rather a paradigm shift in how you think about <br/>
  relationships.  I don&#39;t know you, and I don&#39;t know your kids, so I&#39;m<br/>
  just <br/>
  going to throw stuff out there to be thought about.<br/>
<br/>
  Firstly, you&#39;ve read and ingested and re-read Adelle Fabers&#39; books, <br/>
  right?  The whole &#39;learn to talk so kids will listen&#39; thing?  It&#39;s<br/>
  really <br/>
  helped us out with learning how to talk with our kids and identifying <br/>
  subtly aggressive behavior, which means we can deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
  Secondly, do some work on self-assertiveness for Yourself.  I&#39;m<br/>
  wondering <br/>
  if sometimes it&#39;s difficult for you to say when something is not feeling<br/>
<br/>
  right for you and sitting that child down to peacefully talk it over<br/>
  with <br/>
  them so you can understand WHY they want to write that their brother is <br/>
  stupid and WHY they were trying to trick you into doing something you <br/>
  didn&#39;t want to do (ie, write that the brother was stupid) and thereby <br/>
  facilitating the other brother&#39;s being mean to the younger brother.  I <br/>
  mean, there&#39;s a Whole LOT of discussion that needs to go on about that<br/>
  with <br/>
  the child in question (and not in a mean way, but in a gently<br/>
  inquisitive <br/>
  way, to find out what they&#39;re thinking and how they got to think that <br/>
  way.)  Then you both/all need to talk about how it&#39;s making you, the<br/>
  mommy, <br/>
  feel.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;d also suggest doing some work on family inter-dependence, that is, <br/>
  emphasizing how one family member can be affected by another family<br/>
  member <br/>
  because of the love within the family and talking about it with great <br/>
  concern for BOTH parties (because after all, if family won&#39;t stick up<br/>
  for <br/>
  or care for family, what&#39;s left?)  If one child &#39;doesn&#39;t want to hear<br/>
  it&#39;, <br/>
  maybe say, &quot;I am very sad when you hurt my family and I need to talk<br/>
  with <br/>
  you about it.   Hurting your brother makes my heart cry.  I&#39;m tired of <br/>
  being hurt and I need you to stop.  I don&#39;t know how to stop feeling the<br/>
<br/>
  hurt.  Will you help me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Do you think some of it is that the middle (and teasing) child is<br/>
  looking <br/>
  for more attention from you?  If so, maybe make some dedicated time for <br/>
  just Mom-and-middle-child, say 10 or 15 minutes solid when NOTHING will <br/>
  pull you away from talking to him and playing with him, and doing<br/>
  whatever <br/>
  he wants to do.  If another child needs you, tell them that you&#39;re with <br/>
  this child now and you&#39;ll be there in a while.  Ignore the phone. <br/>
  Etc.  Just you and he, every day, for a certain time (and this goes for <br/>
  EACH of the children.)<br/>
<br/>
  As for the daughter, I&#39;d have told the 3 year old that he didn&#39;t have to<br/>
  go <br/>
  inside, but that his sister was scared about being alone does he<br/>
  remember <br/>
  how it feels when he is scared?  Well, he and mommy are going to help<br/>
  her <br/>
  be not so scared and if he didn&#39;t want to go inside, then he could stay<br/>
  in <br/>
  the car (with the windows cracked) but that you were going inside to<br/>
  help <br/>
  sister feel not so scared and would watch him from the window.  Ask him <br/>
  Does he want to bring a book or a toy for the car?  Then I&#39;d plop myself<br/>
  in <br/>
  the front window where I&#39;d be with my daughter and could wave (and make <br/>
  funny faces) to my son, out in the car.  Maybe make it focus on taking<br/>
  care <br/>
  of (and relating to) someone else when they&#39;re feeling badly.<br/>
<br/>
  Which reminds me, we have a tradition of, &quot;if you cause the pain, you<br/>
  take <br/>
  care of it &#39;tll it&#39;s gone.&quot;  If I hurt someone, I need to stay with that<br/>
<br/>
  someone until they&#39;re okay again, and take care of them and get them ice<br/>
  or <br/>
  hugs or whatever they need to be okay again.  This goes for physical as <br/>
  well as emotional owies and it gives people a way to stop being the <br/>
  &#39;meanie&#39; and become the &#39;caring person&#39;.   No Guilt.  No <br/>
  recriminations.  Just taking care.  You&#39;ve got to help them do it<br/>
  (sweetly) <br/>
  the first few times, but later on, they&#39;ll generally move to do it on<br/>
  their <br/>
  own.<br/>
<br/>
  Good luck.  There&#39;s so much more, but without knowing your kids, I&#39;d be <br/>
  whistling into the wind more than I am already!<br/>

Holly was watching Mary Tyler Moore on a DVD we got from Netflix, the first <br/>
eight episodes.  We were discussing the social realities (and cool clothes) <br/>
of 1970.   She was getting (belatedly but surely) all the references in <br/>
various cartoons and other movies to the theme song and the hat tossing and <br/>
such.    The in one scene the neighbor came and said something about loving <br/>
to visit Mary because she was so GAY!<br/>
<br/>
Holly knows from West Side Story (&quot;I feel pretty and witty and gay!&quot;) and <br/>
other references in books that &quot;gay&quot; has a rapidly changing recent history.  <br/>
But it was fun for her to see it not from the 30&#39;s or the 50&#39;s, but from 1970.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to tell her how different it was for there to be a TV show about a <br/>
woman who wasn&#39;t in the show for being the mother, or the wife, but was there <br/>
for being a single woman who was okay being single, who had a job, who lived <br/>
by herself without a male person.  <br/>
<br/>
I know she heard me and believed me, but I could feel the air of her <br/>
wondering whether it really could have been that different so recently.<br/>
