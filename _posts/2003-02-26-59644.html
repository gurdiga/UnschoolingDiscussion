<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sustained silent reading (SSR) programs are a hot trend in education<br/>
&gt; right now (at least in California where I am).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agreed with the two quotes you posted from Pilgreen, but here&#39;s my problem<br/>
with the various silent reading programs: they don&#39;t ask if kids are ready<br/>
to read at this particular moment.<br/>
<br/>
I have times when I don&#39;t wanna read.  I&#39;m just not in the mood.  Yea, in<br/>
school, maybe it would have been more fun than a lot of the things we did.<br/>
But if you&#39;re not in the mood to read, is sitting quietly, staring at a book<br/>
to make a teacher happy, while feeling surly inside REALLY going to help a<br/>
child&#39;s love of reading?<br/>
<br/>
I suppose that challenges the basic foundation of school itself; namely that<br/>
kids should happily do what they&#39;re told to do at any given moment, but<br/>
that&#39;s what bugs me about those programs.<br/>

But it looks good on the school&#39;s PR raz-ma-tazz about how they CARE about <br/>
reading and giving kids a chance to really get some quiet time to read <br/>
(formerly, insert &quot;anything they want to&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t believe SSR is being combined with prescribed books.  That&#39;s just <br/>
&quot;making kids read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere along there the line is crossed, and it&#39;s whether ANY freedom lies <br/>
with the child.<br/>
