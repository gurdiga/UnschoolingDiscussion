<div id="ygrps-yiv-989116358">Julie, I&#39;m jealous!  My husband is a townie - albeit, small town, but I<br/>
would love to live out in the &quot;boondocks&quot;.  We compromise by owning a couple<br/>
of acres out-of-town but on a state highway.  I think that if you need the<br/>
blinds drawn to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, then you are<br/>
not living in the country!      Deb K.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Do you make goat cheese?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a recipe for ricotta that I just love.  Takes about 15 minutes to<br/>
make and good enough to eat with a spoon.  We also make goat yogurt (which<br/>
makes a fantastic strawberry smoothie) and we like the milk just raw and<br/>
plain as well.<br/>
<br/>
We also raise rabbits and use the meat.  Tastes like the sweetest chicken<br/>
you ever had.  I tried to tan the hides this time but I didn&#39;t get the salt<br/>
on thick enough to ward off the flies.  Live and learn.  We just got our<br/>
baby chicks so we are trying those for the first time this year.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You are living my dream&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is actually a compromise between dh and myself.  He would live in<br/>
Manhattan.  I would live way out in West Texas where you can&#39;t even pick up<br/>
a radio station.  Not surprisingly, we think of  &quot;The Theme from Green<br/>
Acres&quot; as &quot;our song&quot; and dh refers to our home as &quot;the Haney place.&quot;  We<br/>
just have a couple of acres but it is plenty of room for what we are doing.<br/>
