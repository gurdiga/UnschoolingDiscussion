&quot;Your efforts may, at first, seem more like scrap lumber randomly scattered <br/>
across the vast universe that is your child rather than a remarkable <br/>
structure you watch rise, floor by measurable floor. But the Eiffel Tower <br/>
didn&#39;t appear overnight, and the most beautiful cathedrals of the world took <br/>
decades to complete.<br/>
<br/>
It helps to think of yourself not as &quot;teacher&quot; the way you remember it, but <br/>
like the supplier whose purpose is merely making sure the builder - your <br/>
child - can get his hands on the necessary materials when he needs them. Be <br/>
happy when you make any sale, however modest. The true architect will use the <br/>
materials in his own way, in his own time. <br/>
<br/>
Schools force a child into using his limited resources today. &quot;Build a bird <br/>
house,&quot; they demand, &quot;so that we may count how many sticks you&#39;ve collected.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At home there&#39;s no need for immediate &quot;proof&quot;. Be patient. Don&#39;t measure. Who <br/>
can say what exquisite masterpiece your child will shape and build from the <br/>
scraps tomorrow - or ten years from now? The more he collects, the greater <br/>
the structure he&#39;s capable of building. And when that structure is life <br/>
itself, don&#39;t settle for a bird house today. Trust you&#39;ll find a castle <br/>
tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Simply provide the materials.&quot;<br/>

Not Back to School<br/>
<br/>
In late summer, when it sometimes seems that the entire universe is obsessed <br/>
with Back to School hoopla, new and even not-so-new unschoolers often find <br/>
themselves filled with doubts. Many parents feel confident in their ability <br/>
to help their children understand almost anything, except math. &quot;But how will <br/>
they learn math?&quot; is one of the most common questions posed to unschoolers on <br/>
email lists, message boards, and in face to face conversations with the <br/>
curious and the hopeful. <br/>
<br/>
This issue is a musing about math - how kids learn skills and how they don&#39;t, <br/>
what helps, what hinders. Having fun with math. Learning to see and share the <br/>
math in everyday life. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve included several longer book excerpts from favorite authors. I hope they <br/>
supply you with food for thought, and that you&#39;ll seek out the books to read <br/>
further after you&#39;ve finished pondering this newsletter. I&#39;ve also included <br/>
some recent conversations on math from the Unschooling-dotcom email list. <br/>

Harmonious Multiplication<br/>
<br/>
From a conversation on the Unschooling-dotcom email list: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;... the bit about multiplication was just a side note to the division being <br/>
repeated subtraction. Most kids undoubtedly don&#39;t see multiplication as a <br/>
quick way to do repeated addition either. Multiplication as far school <br/>
learning is concerned is just more magical mumbo jumbo like division. &quot;<br/>
Joyce<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My kids know how it really works, and how to do it in their heads, but I&#39;m <br/>
pretty sure if they saw some typical 6th grade math textbook with pages of <br/>
&quot;problems&quot; in the regular school format they wouldn&#39;t know what it was or <br/>
what a person might be expected to do with it. If someone spoke the same math <br/>
question in English (&quot;How many fifteens are in 300?&quot;) they could figure it <br/>
out. <br/>
<br/>
I liken that to being able to sing and harmonize and to make up songs but not <br/>
to understand a bit of musical notation.&quot;  Sandra<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And - SHEESH - imagine teaching musical notation to a kid who hasn&#39;t ever <br/>
heard music?<br/>
<br/>
Schools teach math to kids who have no equivalent of having &quot;heard music&quot;. <br/>
They have no relevant context.&quot; --pamS<br/>

Marilyn Burns on Music and Math<br/>
<br/>
I began taking piano lessons when I was seven or eight years old. I remember <br/>
learning to read notes and play scales and memorizing the sharps and flats <br/>
for each key. These things were basic to learning to play the piano, just as <br/>
we may think of arithmetic facts and procedures as being basic to learning <br/>
mathematics.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a big difference, however, between the way I was taught to play the <br/>
piano and the way I was taught mathematics. Before learning to play the <br/>
piano, I&#39;d had many opportunities to hear music played on the piano. I&#39;d seen <br/>
people play the piano - in person and in movies. I&#39;d watched and listened to <br/>
my mother play the few songs she knew. In my very first piano lesson, I was <br/>
invited to learn to play a song. Making music was part of my learning, and <br/>
each new piece of music I tackled taught me new skills and gave me the chance <br/>
to practice what I had already learned.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I did practice scales, arpeggios, and other exercises in isolation from <br/>
playing music. But I was always clear that my goal for learning to play the <br/>
piano was to play music.<br/>
<br/>
Three of my aunts came to visit regularly and showed interest in what I was <br/>
learning on the piano.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;d love to hear you play a song,&quot; Aunt Freda would say.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What piece can you play for me?&quot; Aunt Florrie would ask.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Come, darling, play something on the piano,&quot; Aunt Gertie would coax.<br/>
<br/>
And I would give a short performance, pleased by their interest and bathed in <br/>
their attention. I continued studying the piano all through high school, <br/>
which amounted to almost ten years of lessons. Never, never, in all of those <br/>
years, did Aunt Freda, Aunt Florrie, or Aunt Gertie ask me to play scales or <br/>
arpeggios. It was music they wanted and expected to hear.<br/>
<br/>
So who cared about my ability to play scales, arpeggios, and other exercises? <br/>
My piano teacher did, and she had me do so for part of my one-hour lesson <br/>
each week. But the bulk of each lesson focused on the music I was learning to <br/>
play, and most of the teaching of skills - helping me with fingering, playing <br/>
difficult passages, interpreting the music - was done in the context of the <br/>
music I was studying.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the parallel with math? While I never lost sight that making music was <br/>
the reason for learning to play the piano, when learning math I never got <br/>
even a glimpse of anything beyond learning skills. All I experienced for the <br/>
first several years of school was a steady diet of pages of practice with <br/>
arithmetic skills, with a little bit of measurement and learning about shapes <br/>
thrown in.<br/>
<br/>
I thought doing arithmetic exercises was doing math. It isn&#39;t. Doing math has <br/>
to do with thinking and reasoning about problems or situations that call for <br/>
applying mathematical ideas and skills. The skills are part of doing math, or <br/>
course, but for a purpose, not as ends in themselves. Skills should be <br/>
learned in the context of problems and situations and should not exist <br/>
isolated from the problems and situations that give them their purpose.<br/>

NHEN Mission Statement:<br/>
The National Home Education Network exists to encourage and facilitate the <br/>
vital grassroots work of state and local homeschooling groups and individuals <br/>
by providing information, fostering networking and promoting public relations <br/>
on a national level. Because we believe there is strength in a diverse <br/>
network of homeschoolers, we support the freedom of all individual families <br/>
to choose home education and to direct such education. <br/>
<br/>
National Home Education Network<br/>
Changing the Way the World Sees Homeschooling<br/>
<br/>
Since its founding in 1999, NHEN, an all-volunteer organization connecting <br/>
homeschoolers nationwide, has evolved into a respected source of information <br/>
for the homeschooling community as well as the general public. Our <br/>
award-winning website contains a wealth of firsthand information about <br/>
homeschooling, written from a variety of viewpoints. In keeping with our <br/>
mission statement, NHEN espouses no one particular political agenda or <br/>
homeschooling philosophy.  Instead, we know that homeschooling parents can <br/>
read all of the material and determine for themselves what is best for their <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
In response to media requests, we help reporters find accurate, balanced <br/>
information about homeschooling and put them in touch with NHEN members who <br/>
have previously indicated a willingness to be interviewed. Information and <br/>
interviews provided by NHEN contacts have appeared in articles in Time, on <br/>
National Public Radio, and other national, state, and local media. <br/>
<br/>
All homeschoolers are invited to participate in our network. NHEN membership <br/>
is free. By joining NHEN you will add your voice to those of thousands of <br/>
other homeschoolers who have approved our mission statement. The more <br/>
homeschoolers connect through our network, the better we will be able to help <br/>
each other in our joint efforts to improve the climate for homeschooling in <br/>
this country; numbers matter to legislators and the media. <br/>
<br/>
By joining NHEN you also send a message of appreciation to the dedicated <br/>
volunteers who answer questions,  provide extensive website information, work <br/>
on the newsletters and email list forums - free of charge for all. <br/>
NHEN operates only through volunteer contributions. Once you&#39;ve joined, be <br/>

Playing with Math<br/>
<br/>
From a conversation on the Unschooling-dotcom email list: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;My kids figured out multiplication by &quot;skip counting&quot; and goofing around <br/>
with pennies and stuff, and by me giving them a blank multiplication table <br/>
for them to fill in if they wanted to, as a puzzle.  I didn&#39;t give them <br/>
terminology or time limits or reasons.  It was fun for its own sake.  And <br/>
they discovered the cool patterns of fives and nines and twos and threes all <br/>
on their own.&quot;  Sandra<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My kids learned multiplication facts by playing games too, I guess. <br/>
<br/>
A page of 100 numbers, ten rows of ten numbers in each row -- a &quot;Hundreds <br/>
Chart&quot; as they&#39;re usually called -- is nice to just have around &lt;G&gt;. Make <br/>
some copies so you have one to pull out and play with when something just <br/>
comes up.<br/>
<br/>
One fun thing to do (if it isn&#39;t fun - don&#39;t do it) is to draw a simple <br/>
pattern in all the squares where the number is a multiple of two - draw an X <br/>
across the square, for example. Then - draw a different pattern, with a <br/>
different color, in all the squares where the number is a multiple of three. <br/>
Then a different one for multiples of four -- and so on. Make the patterns <br/>
simple and use different colors -- as you&#39;re doing it - it is interesting to <br/>
see how some numbers are &quot;special&quot; -- they start looking much more fancy than <br/>
others -- the number twelve, for example, gets the patterns for two, three, <br/>
four, AND six.  It is really kind of a cool thing - and kid sometimes want to <br/>
do it over and over - with different colors and patterns. Again - this isn&#39;t <br/>
an &quot;assignment - done to &quot;teach&quot; them the multiples -- it is a game. <br/>
<br/>
Also - play &quot;Buzz&quot; --- we play in the car. If you&#39;re doing &quot;threes&quot; you play <br/>
like this:<br/>
First person says: 1<br/>
Second person says: 2<br/>
First person says: BUZZ<br/>
Second person says: 4<br/>
First person says: 5<br/>
Second person says: BUZZ<br/>
First person: 7<br/>
Second person: 8<br/>
First Person: BUZZ<br/>
<br/>
If you have more people you&#39;ll find some interesting things -- for example, <br/>
if you have three people, doing &quot;threes&quot; is boring since the same person just <br/>
says BUZZ every time. That is enlightening - itself, but doesn&#39;t make for a <br/>
fun game, so the kids will figure out to avoid doing numbers that don&#39;t work <br/>
well for whatever number of people they have playing. <br/>
<br/>
Then - you can make the game WAY more complicated. Do two sets of multiples <br/>
at once when you play: &quot;BIZZ BUZZ&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Example -- 5 people playing twos are BIZZ and threes are BUZZ:<br/>
Person 1: 1<br/>
Person 2: BIZZ<br/>
Person 3: BUZZ<br/>
Person 4: BIZZ<br/>
Person 5: 5<br/>
Person 1: BIZZ BUZZ<br/>
Person 2: 7<br/>
Person 3: BIZZ<br/>
Person 4: BUZZ<br/>
Person 5: BIZZ<br/>
<br/>
and so on.&quot;   --pamS<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...wondering why phonics and times tables is relevant to the *unschooling* <br/>
list anyway, LOL.&quot;  Rachel<br/>
<br/>
&quot;As an unschooler - I expect that my kids will learn to sound out words <br/>
(phonics) and will learn to multiply (multiplication tables). Unschooling <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean &quot;unlearning&quot; &lt;G&gt;. I don&#39;t &quot;make them learn&quot; and I don&#39;t plan <br/>
their learning in some systematic structured progressive bit-by-bit way. But <br/>
I do have a lot of ideas and fun and interesting possibilities always at my <br/>
fingertips -- that&#39;s how we live our lives. I treat multiplication tables as <br/>
a potentially interesting and useful thing to know or do in the same way I <br/>
treat riding a horse, clearing the dinner table, going to an opera, or <br/>
reading a book. <br/>
<br/>
So - you&#39;d have to know that, I guess, or you might think I was suggesting <br/>
sitting your kid down and telling them, &quot;Now is multiplication time - please <br/>
fill out this chart in this way using these colored pencils.&quot; No -- we&#39;re not <br/>
doing that. In fact, I&#39;m more likely to fool with it myself and then &quot;let&quot; <br/>
the kids do one too, if they ask. Or - I might say, &quot;Here - I had this cool <br/>
idea about multiplying - wanna see it?&quot; OR - a kid might moan and groan that <br/>
they don&#39;t know multiplication facts and it is slowing them down in some <br/>
other activity they&#39;re trying to pursue - so I might tell them that I have <br/>
some pretty fun ways in mind that can help them learn them.<br/>
<br/>
It is always an offer and it is always something that they can take or leave <br/>
or expand or cut short or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I agree - a formal phonics or math program would not be appropriate to <br/>
suggest on an unschooling list. Thanks for pointing that out, Rachel, and <br/>
giving me the opportunity to clarify how I intended the multiplication stuff <br/>
to be considered - just as something fun that kids and parents might enjoy, <br/>
not as a &quot;lesson,&quot; by any means.<br/>
<br/>
You should have seen me sitting here drawing the spirolaterals the other day <br/>
-- I had a bunch of kids here and after 5 minutes they were all drawing and <br/>
coloring too. That&#39;s just for fun, not school.&quot;  --pamS<br/>

Real World Geometry<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A friend of mine just made a big tent.  Big.  Like 18&#39; tall in the center, <br/>
7&#39; side poles, 22 feet long or so. Big.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a very meticulous guy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve made tents, but never that big.  Still, all mine had sides out at <br/>
angles, and roofs at angles.  <br/>
<br/>
I figured mine out on paper, and double-checked the measurements before I cut <br/>
the cloth, and they worked out fine.<br/>
<br/>
My friend said (and I let him run on without comment, because he has to leave <br/>
for three weeks of a big medieval deal tomorrow and he was stressed enough) <br/>
that had the walls been straight it would have only involved geometry, but <br/>
with angled side-walls it was trigonometry and so he asked our friend Tomas, <br/>
a research engineer involved in astronomy or some space something, to help <br/>
him with the math.  So they worked it all out.  And the measurements were <br/>
wrong.  So he had to recut the cloth, but he finally got it worked out.<br/>
<br/>
I &quot;don&#39;t know trig,&quot; and that&#39;s for sure.  It&#39;s something engineers do.  <br/>
Sometimes not well, apparently! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But cloth, I can do.  And the angles and measurements are very mechanical.  <br/>
There&#39;s an angle from the top of the wall, and it can only go so far.  There <br/>
are triangles involved.  They can be drawn on paper, and measured.  And the <br/>
long side of the triangle is just a measurement.  And the corners can be made <br/>
out of a rectangle with the diagonal of the longest length, cut and turned so <br/>
the points of the triangles are both up, and the short side is toward the <br/>
ground.<br/>
<br/>
And if all else fails, and a calculation was wrong, it&#39;s easier to shorten <br/>
side-poles or get longer poles than it is to redo all those acres (okay, <br/>
dozens of yards) of canvas!! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve built tents in English and with sketches.  Not trigonometry.&quot; <br/>

John Holt on Measurement<br/>
<br/>
What then should we do about making the world of numbers and math accessible, <br/>
interesting, and understandable to children?<br/>
<br/>
A few good principles to keep in mind: (1) Children do not need to be <br/>
&quot;taught&quot; in order to learn; they will learn a great deal, and probably learn <br/>
best, without being taught. (2) Children are enormously interested in our <br/>
adult world and what we do there. (3) Children learn best when the things <br/>
they learn are embedded in a context of real life, are part of what George <br/>
Dennison, in The Lives of Children, called &quot;the continuum of experience.&quot; (4) <br/>
Children learn best when their learning is connected with an immediate and <br/>
serious purpose.<br/>
<br/>
What this means in the filed of numbers and math is simply this: the more we <br/>
can make it possible for children to see how we use numbers, and to use them <br/>
as we use them, the better.<br/>
<br/>
What do we adults do with numbers? We measure things with them, a huge <br/>
variety of things in the real world around us. Why? So that we can think <br/>
better about them and make better use of them. We measure, among a host of <br/>
other reasons, to find out whether we are sick or well; to find out whether  <br/>
we are doing something better than we did before; to find out which of <br/>
several ways of doing this is better; to find out how strong we have to make <br/>
things in order to make them stand up; to find out where we are, or where <br/>
we&#39;re going; to find our, if we do a certain thing, what other things are <br/>
likely to happen as a result. And so on. We don&#39;t measure things out of idle <br/>
curiosity. We measure them so that we can decide things about them and do <br/>
things with them.<br/>
<br/>
Since all this is inherently interesting and important to us, it will also <br/>
interest children.<br/>
<br/>
So we should introduce children to numbers by giving them or making available <br/>
to them as many measuring instruments as possible - rulers, measuring tapes <br/>
(in both feet and meters), scales, watches and stopwatches, thermometers, <br/>
metronomes, barometers, light meters, decibel meters, and so on. Whatever we <br/>
measure in our lives and work, we should try to measure so that children can <br/>
see us doing it, and we should try to make it possible for them to measure <br/>
the same things, and let them know how we are thinking about the things we <br/>
have measured. <br/>
<br/>
Children are interested in themselves, their own bodies, their growth, <br/>
quickness, strength. In What Do I Do Monday? I suggested a whole range of <br/>
experiments that children might do to measure their own size, strength, and <br/>
speed, and how these things change over time and vary with different <br/>
conditions. Thus children might measure their own respiration and pulse rate, <br/>
then exercise violently for a while, then measure their breathing and pulse <br/>
rate again, then measure it at intervals to see how long it takes it to get <br/>
down to normal. Or children might do various tests of speed and strength, <br/>
running timed distances or lifting weights or doing other exercise, and what <br/>
happens when they try to do this a second time, and how their performance <br/>
varies with the amount of rest they have, and how their speed or strength, <br/>
and their recovery times, vary from week to week or from month to month.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from involving numbers, all this is true science, not the passive <br/>
science of the schools where children are told about the wonderful things <br/>
that scientists have discovered, or the fake science of other schools where <br/>
children do &quot;experiments&quot; to find out what is already well known, or to get <br/>
answers which a teacher marks &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong.&quot;<br/>

True Confessions of Alison McKee<br/>
<br/>
... when Christian was ten, he developed a keen interest in the nature <br/>
preserve that is at our back door. During the winter months, he would just <br/>
wander the acres. After one of these wanderings, he announced that he wanted <br/>
to do a &quot;habitat study.&quot; Apparently, he had been scouting for a plot of land <br/>
to study for quite some time.<br/>
<br/>
As on other occasions, Christian knew what he wanted to do and had devised <br/>
his own plan of study. Over the next few weeks, he made repeated trips to his <br/>
little plot of land in the park. Each time he returned from one of his <br/>
excursions, he had new and interesting things to tell us. One afternoon he <br/>
might tell me about a flock of geese that he;d seen heading north: a sure <br/>
sign of spring! A week later, he might report that the temperatures were <br/>
somewhat cooler; therefore some of the buds had ceased opening. His reports <br/>
were always interesting and involved great detail.<br/>
<br/>
In my eagerness to help Christian &quot;do a better habitat study,&quot; I began to <br/>
interfere. At my suggestion, he showed me his plot of land. It was simply a <br/>
stretch of land next to the path, and included a piece of field, some <br/>
low-lying shrubs, and a small section of woods. There was nothing <br/>
particularly remarkable about it; it just was.<br/>
<br/>
I, of course, being a &quot;teacher&quot; began to cook up lots of ideas about how he <br/>
should do his study. I knew how such projects should be conducted! When I was <br/>
in high school, our biology teacher had assigned just such a project, and <br/>
later I had helped many of my own students put together sciences projects. <br/>
These experiences called for the application of &quot;proper methodology&quot; and I <br/>
was ready to see to it that Christian was well-versed in its use. Suggestions <br/>
poured forth. I didn&#39;t bother to ask Christian whether or not he wanted my <br/>
suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
My first suggesting was that Christian measure his plot of land. Measuring, I <br/>
surmised, would lend itself to creating a scaled drawing. I knew from <br/>
experience that illustrations were and important part of any graded project <br/>
and felt that Christian needed to include one in his work. Never mind the <br/>
fact that he might come to the same conclusion on his own, or, conversely, <br/>
never feel that he should illustrate or share his work with anyone!<br/>
<br/>
Christian acquiesced. Together with his sister, we took our meter stick (all <br/>
scientific measurements must be done in metric measure - another of my <br/>
&quot;teacher&quot; notions) and measured the plot. Without realizing it, I was already <br/>
limiting Christian&#39;s project. Not only was I setting boundaries to something <br/>
that he had seen as free of boundaries, I was also causing him to think in <br/>
terms of my limiting experiences of &quot;school projects.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When we returned home, I asked Christian to draw a scaled map of his plot of <br/>
land. Christian saw no need for this but, like a good son, he tried. Soon his <br/>
interest was truly on the wane. Seeing this, I once more attempted to take <br/>
control in hopes of rekindling his dying interest in his habitat study. <br/>
Before I had jumped in, I had noticed that Christian had been taking <br/>
temperature readings using the thermometer outside our bedroom window. This <br/>
met his needs. He simply enjoyed noting the temperature and the date and time <br/>
of day that it was taken. Now I insisted he chart and graph his readings, and <br/>
of course, this put a damper on his interest in keeping track of temperature <br/>
at all. To counter this, I offered him a bribe - a nifty thermometer he could <br/>
clip onto his jacket. Christian seemed to understand what I didn&#39;t; that the <br/>
thermometer was not a gift, but rather an attempt to buy back his interest <br/>
and that if he accepted the thermometer, he&#39;d be more firmly bound by my <br/>
notion of how he should conduct his project.<br/>
<br/>
Although the thermometer temporarily rekindled Christian&#39;s interest in his <br/>
habitat project, by this time the damage had been done. My schooled voice had <br/>
overpowered Christian&#39;s intuitive idea of how to study his habitat, and as a <br/>
result he gave up on it. Finally, as I watched him put away his notes for the <br/>
last time, the light dawned; I remembered what John Holt had said in a Mother <br/>
Earth News interview: that rewarding a child for work that is self-rewarding <br/>
eventually kills the child&#39;s interest in doing the work at all. This was <br/>
exactly what I had done. I felt remorse when I realized that my best <br/>
intentions to help Christian had, in fact, not helped at all.<br/>
<br/>
When I realized that we had effectively ruined Christian&#39;s habitat study, we <br/>
sat down for some serious discussion. If we were going to continue <br/>
unschooling, we needed to understand what had driven us to insist that <br/>
Christian change the design of his study. Our discussions eventually led us <br/>
to a truth that we were not readily acknowledging: in spite of our <br/>
convictions about the merits of unschooling, we simply didn&#39;t trust our <br/>
children and their intuitions about how best to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Although we had watched our children initiate many interesting projects, any <br/>
time Christian or Georgina decided to do something that reminded us of our <br/>
school experiences, we&#39;d feel the urge to help them &quot;get it right.&quot; We&#39;d <br/>
meddle just a little bit with such projects, so that neither Christian nor <br/>
Georgina would wander too far from our understanding of how things &quot;ought&quot; to <br/>
be studied.<br/>

Final Thought<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Computation (routine calculation) is to mathematics as spelling is to <br/>
literature. It has value in itself, but it is no substitute for the real <br/>
thing.&quot;<br/>
