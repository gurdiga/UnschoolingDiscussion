Okay, no we&#39;re not! You need to really like your kids and want them around.<br/>
You need to respect them and trust them. Be aware of their needs and wants<br/>
and where they want to go. Provide tools for them to be able to get what<br/>
they want. Play with them and laugh with them. Cuddle, talk, run and love<br/>
them. That has nothing to do with higher education or being gifted. Just<br/>
ignore those who know not what they say.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404821808">Maybe it&#39;s time for some new &quot;friends&quot;.  Their kind of support you DON&#39;T need.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Nope, not if you mean college degrees.  And if I&#39;m &quot;gifted&quot;, it&#39;s BECAUSE of unschooling!  I used to be an ordinary parent, doing the slow dance along the school assembly line like everyone else, but now we&#39;re unschoolers.  That in itself is a gift.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll bet there are people here that had to undo a lot of their higher education in order to BE an unschooler.  <br/>
<br/>
Find some new people to talk to.  People that are more willing to step out of the box every once in a while.  <br/>

Come on now...do you really believe that?  Think about<br/>
what unschooling entails.  These people are making the<br/>
same assumptions as the other person who put you<br/>
through the wringer in your last post.<br/>
<br/>
For one, this list is full of people from all walks of<br/>
life, unschooling right now, this very minute,<br/>
successfully and happily.  Some in the city, some in<br/>
the country, some in the suburbs.  All religions,<br/>
races, ethnic and cultural groups, all different<br/>
income levels and education levels.<br/>
<br/>
There are how many people on this list now?  over<br/>
1600?  <br/>
<br/>
How many women are on that list?  How much research<br/>
into unschooling have they done?  What books have they<br/>
read?  What websites have they visited?  What<br/>
discussion groups have they joined?  None?  Then tell<br/>
them to shut up.<br/>
<br/>
Stop letting other people steal your joy, and create<br/>
fears where there don&#39;t need to be.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt was interviewed in 1980 for Mother Earth<br/>
News.  Here is the link to the interview if you want<br/>
to read it all: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomington.in.us/~learn/Holt.htm">http://www.bloomington.in.us/~learn/Holt.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
In this interview he was asked where he went to<br/>
school, and he refused to answer that question.  When<br/>
asked why, his answer was perfect:<br/>
<br/>
PLOWBOY: Perhaps it was your own classroom experiences<br/>
that sparked your interest in education. Where did you<br/>
go to school?<br/>
<br/>
HOLT: I won&#39;t answer that question.<br/>
<br/>
PLOWBOY: You won&#39;t? Did I say something wrong?<br/>
<br/>
HOLT: No, but I&#39;ve come to believe that people&#39;s<br/>
education is as much their private business as their<br/>
religion or politics. Let me just say that most of<br/>
what I know I didn&#39;t learn in school, or in what<br/>
people call &quot;learning situations&quot;. I don&#39;t owe<br/>
anything to formal education for my love of language,<br/>
reading, and music. I had those interests before I<br/>
went to school, I lost a lot of them in such<br/>
institutions, and I&#39;ve managed to get them back since.<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793516716">Yikes! I&#39;m sorry to hear they are being so harsh with you about YOUR choice! Personally, I barely managed to graduate high school and ONLY because it was easier than dropping out and getting my GED so that I could enlist in the Coast Guard and high-tail it away from a toxic home situation. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve tried college, but outside of the classes I REALLY wanted to take and had an interest in, I didn&#39;t have it in me to care enough to make sure I attended, and so I dropped out of that as well.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m a classic &quot;gifted but doesn&#39;t live up to her potential, if only we could get her head out of the clouds&quot; geek type. <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s hampering my children&#39;s unschooling. If anything, because I have many many interests, they are exposed to more than if I just focused on one thing LOL<br/>

and a belief in your kids.  Nothing &quot;higher ed&quot; about any of that.<br/>
<br/>
But I totally understand being hurt in this situation.  I have a group I&#39;ve<br/>
been with since we were pregnant the winter of 95/96.  Our kids are all<br/>
turning 8 this month and next.  We&#39;ve been together for 8.5 years at this<br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
When I tried to explain unschooling it became a shooting match--me and the<br/>
only other homeschooler (and she&#39;s not an unschooler, although she was<br/>
supportive.   Recently one of the mothers described me as &quot;withholding an<br/>
education from my children.&quot;   She implied, non too subtly, that I was a<br/>
neglectful parent.<br/>
<br/>
It was to think that I&#39;d had this long conversation, with women I thought I<br/>
could trust, who would hear me honestly.  She only heard that I didn&#39;t think<br/>
formal education was important, thus her formal education was crap (never<br/>
said that, just for the record) and I was a bad parent.<br/>
<br/>
-sigh-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really hurt and angry about it.  I seriously considered leaving the<br/>
group.  I still do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been very, v e r y careful about this. If you say higher education <br/>
is not important, people will hear &quot;higher education is crap, therefore <br/>
you are crap&quot;. education & profession are the markers of status for <br/>
americans for lack of real class consciousness. it amazes me the kind <br/>
of poverty many people endure in order to get an advanced degree. now <br/>
that i am out of that world, i also find appalling that many people <br/>
neglect their kids through schooling and after school programs because, <br/>
if the kid gets to Harvard then well, it will be proof of your success <br/>
as a parent.<br/>
<br/>
when it comes down to it though, for lack of a class system based on <br/>
royal lineage, americans have come to use education and profession as <br/>
surrogates to nobility. if you pooh-pooh their MBA and resume, well, <br/>
you&#39;re pooh-poohing their claim to status.<br/>
<br/>
i dwell within many different social circles and it gives me <br/>
opportunities for weird moments. just the other day i went to an event <br/>
where i met some of the most important sponsors of digital art in this <br/>
country. their combined worth was in the billions. it was a weird <br/>
moment of reckoning how with their jeans and somewhat shabby look they <br/>
were in the room soaking up the art vibes, so to speak. some of them <br/>
are related to the kids that appeared in the documentary &quot;born rich&quot; <br/>
(which aired on HBO and which i highly recommend). they are in such a <br/>
different social plane, it&#39;s amazing. college? formal education? what <br/>
for? it&#39;s more like a sport, something to keep themselves busy with. <br/>
it&#39;s not like some of them don&#39;t work (they do have professions and are <br/>
parts of executive boards and the like), but they don&#39;t live by their <br/>
work, their profession or their education (or lack thereof).<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s really, really interesting to be around people who have basically <br/>
been raised with the &#39;&#39;freedom&quot; to do whatever they wanted to do with <br/>
their lives because money, class and education where never an issue.<br/>

I don&#39;t hang around anyone that is consistently unsupportive.  Asking questions about unschooling is one thing, but anyone that tears down what you choose to do isn&#39;t much of a friend.<br/>

Beware those that will lift themselves up by digging a hole under you.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Now some of the other group members have kinda told <br/>
me that its wrong and just now one of them told me that only people with <br/>
higher education should unschool, and that you must be a very smart person <br/>
to unschool. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you aware of Howard Gardner&#39;s theories on &quot;multiple intelligences&quot;?  <br/>
(Let us know if you&#39;re not, and we can review, but you could look at google <br/>
too if it&#39;s not something you&#39;ve already run across).   It would help you to <br/>
ask them which kinds of &quot;smart&quot; they think would be best for unschooling.   <br/>
<br/>
There are some &quot;very smart&quot; people who are likewise NOT &quot;very smart&quot; in one <br/>
area or another.   Sometimes the husband and wife together get all the 7 to 9 <br/>
intelligences covered; sometimes not.  But it hardly matters.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s important for unschoolers is to be interested in learning, to think <br/>
the world is a cool place, to be upbeat, to be imaginative and willing to go at <br/>
a child&#39;s pace sometimes, to seek out new inputs and opportunities for the <br/>
child, and not to screw him up.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my opinion, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known some people I didn&#39;t think would be successful at unschooling.  <br/>
Some seemed &quot;not bright&quot; to me, but in the not sparkly, not quick to say &quot;Sure! <br/>
Okay!&quot; way.  Some were dull in that they were cynical and declared at least <br/>
have the world to be &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;boring.&quot;   That&#39;s an anchor in the <br/>
mud.  <br/>
<br/>
Some were so smart (in their own minds at least) they were unwilling to <br/>
consider that their children might know things they didn&#39;t know, or might have <br/>
really great ideas, so they managed their children&#39;s lives too much, and squelched <br/>
the kids&#39; desire to initiate projects.<br/>
<br/>
Some are too impatient. They&#39;ll give their kids six months to prove <br/>
unschooling works, oh well, it didn&#39;t, I think I&#39;ll put them in school and learn to sky <br/>
dive, oh, they hated that school so I put them in another school, it&#39;s <br/>
lovely, I think I&#39;ll leave my husband, oh, I broke a nail.  (That needs to be <br/>
performed in the perky, quick, distracted voice of someone who&#39;s not paying any <br/>
attention to her audience, and then you see that she never slowed down long enough <br/>
to really hear and see her children, either.)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Recently one of the mothers described me as &quot;withholding an<br/>
<br/>
education from my children.&quot;   She implied, non too subtly, that I was a<br/>
<br/>
neglectful parent. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You could tell her that maybe you&#39;re wrong, and she should wait a few years <br/>
and see how your child is doing.<br/>
<br/>
I just got a Christmas letter from a friend of mine who confides in me.  It <br/>
went to all her MANY relatives, and her husband&#39;s.  Their kids were <br/>
mondo-schooled, and her daughter went off to Stanford, but dropped out without telling <br/>
people, moved in with a guy who&#39;s so far good for nothing (but might amount to <br/>
something eventually), has lied nine ways, cost them a TON of money for medical <br/>
evals for lupus, and then she doesn&#39;t do what the doctor says, etc., etc.,   <br/>
<br/>
They haven&#39;t heard from her for many weeks.  Last spring when they thought <br/>
she was in school but she had dropped out, she travelled across the country <br/>
(they live in Virginia) and didn&#39;t call them or tell them she was in town (they <br/>
found out accidentally), and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
Yet in their Christmas letter they told every possible positive thing about <br/>
her and didn&#39;t mention a single negative.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t trust every schooled child&#39;s mom&#39;s account of how wonderfully she&#39;s <br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
If Kirby were screwing up like crazy I&#39;d at least say &quot;Kirby&#39;s going through <br/>
a non-communicative phase but we hear he is...&quot; instead of going &quot;LA LA LA <br/>
EVERYTHING IS PERFECT.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have some side-by-side comparison families, whose kids are Kirby&#39;s age or a <br/>
bit older, and travelling to fancy this&#39;n&#39;that, or getting scholarships.  I&#39;m <br/>
unconcerned.  A couple of them chose colleges really far away because they&#39;re <br/>
wound up like 13-year-school rubber bands and are launching themselves as far <br/>
away from mom as possible.   The parents say &quot;How nice, she&#39;s *so* <br/>
indePENdent!&quot; and the kid rolls her eyes behind the mom&#39;s back where I can see it and <br/>
tells me later she&#39;s glad to be leaving.<br/>
<br/>
I was glad to be leaving when I went to college.  But I had just turned <br/>
seventeen, younger than Kirby is now, and that was the last of being parented for <br/>
me.  Too soon, too soon; yet staying home had lost most nurturance.<br/>
<br/>
Having a more comfortable nest, our kids&#39; patterns for leaving will be <br/>
different.  <br/>
<br/>
The direct comparisons don&#39;t work so well, and it&#39;s not over &#39;til it&#39;s over.  <br/>
Some people get into a hotshot job and don&#39;t last, or they end up too big too <br/>
quick, and ruin a marriage or lose a car and house, or or or...   <br/>
<br/>
Success isn&#39;t a snapshot thing.  It&#39;s an ongoing state, and it REALLY needs <br/>
to take satisfaction, honesty, respect of friends and neighbors and other <br/>
factors than just money and level of education into account.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think having advanced degrees helps in any way with unschooling. The only way it might&#39;ve helped with me is by making me keenly aware that I didn&#39;t want my children to feel that they had to go the education route. I never wanted them to feel that college was any better than carpentry, music or whatever other passion they develop. I think it also helped me when I taught to see how little college kids knew, how little many of them wanted to learn, and how many of them didn&#39;t have a clue why they were there.<br/>
<br/>
What matters is a passion for learning, as others have said. Not to be mean, but I&#39;d be far more concerned about someone, regardless of their own degrees, who felt they were just a servant to their children and didn&#39;t want to stop what they were doing to help a child figure something out, than a parent with a highschool diploma (or even without one of those!) genuinely and lovingly learning alongside her children. If you love your children and enjoy being with them, learning and discovering with them, allowing them to open the world to you through their eyes--that to me is a real education and one that is priceless!<br/>

ideas that are toxic to your understanding of unschooling. So you need to<br/>

embracing unschooling with a free heart?<br/>

You could ask them how many books on unschooling they<br/>
have read, how many websites have they visited, how<br/>
many true unschoolers do they know, how many<br/>
discussion groups have they joined.  If the answer is<br/>
none, which it probably is, then tell them they are<br/>
judging something they know nothing about.  Give them<br/>
a list of books, websites, etc. to read, and tell them<br/>
that until they have, they are only showing their<br/>
ignorance.  Then tell them you are leaving the group<br/>
and that you wish them well but you aren&#39;t going to<br/>
take the rude, insulting way they are treating you,<br/>
that you need to be with people who support you and<br/>
care about you.<br/>

With all that, I sometimes wish more unschooling parents would look into <br/>
child development, or that anyone who&#39;s going to homeschool, rather, would ALREADY <br/>
have read enough child development summary (it doesn&#39;t take much, a chart of <br/>
Piaget&#39;s developmental stages, maybe, while really looking around at real kids <br/>
to see what he&#39;s talking about) so that they wouldn&#39;t expect unreasonable <br/>
things of too-young children.   <br/>
<br/>
Very few unschoolers end up expecting too much too soon, but overall, a WHOLE <br/>
lot of perental frustration and unwise action and response could dissolve in <br/>
air and light if parents were aware that there are some kinds of thinking that <br/>
don&#39;t kick in until children are older.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s something lots of people do learn in college, but it&#39;s certainly not <br/>
something someone needs college to learn!<br/>

Maybe you could say that you wouldn&#39;t write about brain surgery if you didn&#39;t <br/>

    It will be up to your son and what _he_ wants to do. You and your family<br/>
are there to help that along. Getting into college isn&#39;t that hard for<br/>
unschoolers if they want it. Who knows what he may want or need to do. There<br/>
are so many paths he could take. College is but a small one in the grand<br/>
scheme of _life_ learning. There are ways around most obstacles that may<br/>
come up. We just have to look for them and sometimes create a few. Did you<br/>
read that John Holt interveiw/article in Mother that just went through? He<br/>
created his opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
    This may help to think about. My oldest (18) you read about just a few<br/>
post before. He&#39;s really a great young man. He is attending community<br/>
college here and doing well. He hasn&#39;t stepped in a classroom since spring<br/>
of 1996. We&#39;ve unschooled from that beginning. He surprised himself in his<br/>
english class and really enjoyed it. So much so that he is considering<br/>
changing from a computer major to an english one. We&#39;ll see, he&#39;s enjoying<br/>
taking all different types of classes. He has a psychology class along with<br/>
another english this quarter that he really thinks he&#39;ll enjoy. his computer<br/>
classes are easy As for him. He&#39;s learned this stuff on his own. Our<br/>
relationship is strong and he hasn&#39;t had any trouble with anything he&#39;s done<br/>
considering who *I* am. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
    Don&#39;t let them get you down. You don&#39;t have to justify your choices.<br/>
You&#39;ve already had some great responces here. It is hard to feel the hurt<br/>
but I&#39;ve found that that is when I grow by solidifying my beleifs. Hang in<br/>
there, circles of friends change many times in a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
    To give an example. I remember when I got married. I sent out 100<br/>
invitations to family and friends. At least a third I thought would attend<br/>
or at least acknowledge my wedding. It was a rude awakening for me. Turned<br/>
out I had a very small intimate wedding with immediate family and couple<br/>
friends. Most didn&#39;t even send a card. Stuff like that has happened several<br/>
time over the years. Not to that magnitude but still. Friends when we<br/>
started a family, Moms groups, Homeschool circles, now neighborhood friends.<br/>
Change can be a good expansion of who you are. Be strong in yourself.  Well<br/>
I&#39;m rambling now. <br/>

Why would I go to school if not for a degree? Well, because I&#39;m a <br/>
learner by nature. A degree is just a consequence. If I can make <br/>
more money than great, but who cares if not. I just want to go for <br/>
learning&#39;s sake.  It&#39;s sad to see people trudge through school, pay <br/>
thousands and have their bubble burst when they get a whiff of <br/>
what&#39;s out there. If I&#39;m going to pay thousands of dollars then I&#39;m <br/>
going to make sure I at least like it! Am I being unrealistic?</div>

    We have something else in common. My husband did the same thing. In<br/>
Hawaii of all places. He has also, at one time, taken college classes and<br/>
did very well. We love to learn. He&#39;s really close to getting his pilots<br/>
licence now. He&#39;s having a blast doing it too.<br/>
<br/>
    I love that last paragraph. It&#39;s how I feel too. I want them to be happy<br/>
in what they choose to do. I never could understand why, in high school, so<br/>
many were going after careers they cared nothing about just for the $$ it<br/>
represented. Making $$ is one thing but enjoying what you do is really where<br/>
it&#39;s at in my book. :-)<br/>

&gt; I am just a high school graduate, and my husband dropped out (later earned a<br/>
&gt; diploma in the military).  But there are so many things I CAN do that many,<br/>
&gt; MANY average mom&#39;s were never taught (sewing, altering, knitting, spinning,<br/>
&gt; carding,   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I seriously consider the kind of person they turn out to be the most<br/>
&gt; important, high above academics.  They&#39;re all easy to get along with, kind to<br/>
&gt; others, crazy funny, independent, and strong in their convictions.  I want<br/>
&gt; them to <br/>
&gt; know, above anything, that THEY can make their lives happy if they choose to<br/>
&gt; be happy in whatever they do.<br/>

&quot;With all that, I sometimes wish more unschooling parents would look into <br/>
child development, or that anyone who&#39;s going to homeschool, rather, would ALREADY <br/>
have read enough child development summary (it doesn&#39;t take much, a chart of <br/>
Piaget&#39;s developmental stages, maybe, while really looking around at real kids <br/>
to see what he&#39;s talking about) so that they wouldn&#39;t expect unreasonable <br/>
things of too-young children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I understand what you&#39;re saying, but I think it works both ways for some people too.  If they &#39;know&#39; when a child is &#39;supposed&#39; to be able to do a certain thing, they worry when it doesn&#39;t happen.  I&#39;ve seen a lot of posts from different places that hint towards this.  Maybe not always a full blown worry, but a nagging little pest in the back of their heads that just won&#39;t shut up. <br/>

&gt;I assume the cyber relationship with these women is providing you with<br/>
&gt;something you need, but that need is being met at a price. The price is<br/>
&gt;ideas that are toxic to your understanding of unschooling. So you need to<br/>
&gt;choose: is the social bond or whatever you&#39;re getting more important than<br/>
&gt;embracing unschooling with a free heart?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;An even better choice is to find another place that will give you both :-)<br/>

assuming that these are people you don&#39;t even know in real life. Is it <br/>
perhaps projection of their own worries about their own kids that they <br/>
aren&#39;t willing to even look at?<br/>

This is so true!  I attended two years of engineering school but <br/>
never graduated. MJainly financial reasons.  Now when Ii consider <br/>
going back to school, I have no drive to get a degree. Could care <br/>
less. I just want to take some interesting classes. When I discuss <br/>
