<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395961531">**I can only imagine what it would have been like to have an Unschooled kid <br/>
in one of my classes.**<br/>
<br/>
Probably a lot like having those returning students, without the depth of <br/>
life experience (though more than most of the schooled students).<br/>
<br/>
Melissa (always unschooled) has been taking community college classes off and <br/>
on for three years or so, part time. (She&#39;s 20 now). Without exception, the <br/>
people she connects with and make friends with are the older students, almost <br/>
always adult women many years older than she is. <br/>
<br/>
The absolute biggest difference between her and her schooled age mates in <br/>
those classes is what I noted before - they don&#39;t really expect things to make <br/>
sense. Some sigh and roll their eyes when she asks questions because she doesn&#39;t <br/>
understand something - not because they do (the sighers are often barely <br/>
passing) but because it keeps them from getting out early. Whatever they&#39;re there <br/>
for, it isn&#39;t the learning, they don&#39;t expect that. It&#39;s baffling to her.<br/>

Kirby is having the odd experience of being in classes with people he knew  <br/>
already.  Unschoolers. &lt;G&gt;  Liam McClure, whose mom was one of  my first LLL <br/>
leaders when Kirby was a baby, is in one of his classes.   Liam&#39;s twin sister, <br/>
Renee, has class in another building and they all go to  lunch afterwards.  <br/>
Someone in his math class is also in another class, but  he&#39;s young too.  They <br/>
and two others of their crowd (these others are  19-21, to Kirby&#39;s 18) are <br/>
planning to take at least one class together next  semester.  Of those five, four <br/>
are unschooled (Brett from 3rd grade, Renee  went to school part of one year, <br/>
7th grade or so, out of curiosity) and the  fifth was schooled at home by a <br/>
very forgetful and disorganized mom.<br/>
 <br/>
Among the gamers and anime club, Kirby&#39;s had lots of older friends.   Maybe <br/>
when he was little they just thought he was cute, or he was available more  <br/>
easily than kids in school, or maybe he just actually TALKED to them like they  <br/>
were human instead of ducking and dodging because they were adults and he  <br/>
wasn&#39;t.   He was offered rides and meals and participation in lots of  things <br/>
other kids his age didn&#39;t have.<br/>
 <br/>
Just a little more info-dump.<br/>
