<div id="ygrps-yiv-275225787">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone point me in the direction of research/articles which suggest that TV and gaming is positive, as opposed to the usual belief that it is negative, for young (around six and under) children please?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance,<br/>
Jo<br/>

I&#39;m going to link you to some things Joyce and I have collected.<br/>
You could look at research, but we&#39;re ahead of the curve on this.<br/>
<br/>
Same with reading and choices and lots of things &quot;mainstream&quot; authors have written in the past couple of years as though they discovered or created the benefits, we&#39;ve been doing this for many years.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Sopolsky of Stanford gave permission to be quoted here, but my writing pre-dates his on that particular topic. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-230685627">Thank you for those replies - I have now read them all. The one about economics really made sense to me - I would recommend that one in particular to anyone with niggles about tv watching.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
