<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Being a &quot;non-mathie&quot;, I don&#39;t get too wanged out about math. I use VERY <br/>
little (read probably NONE) of the higher math I was &quot;taught&quot; in school. <br/>
{Now, Joyce will probably come along and give you ZILLIONS of ways I use <br/>
higher math every day. She&#39;ll just say that I don&#39;t KNOW I&#39;m using it! &lt;G&gt;}<br/>
<br/>
BUT. When I questioned why we had to take algebra, trig, calculus, my <br/>
teachers would always say that it exercises your brain on a higher plane. <br/>
Your point.<br/>
<br/>
As for my children: thinking on a higher plane could means DOZENS of things! <br/>
Cameron was consumed by magic for two years. Magic, to me, is the ultimate in <br/>
&quot;higher plane thinking&quot;. You&#39;ve GOT to be contemplating things way above the <br/>
average person&#39;s thought processes (to be any good, anyway). He wasn&#39;t &quot;just <br/>
doing tricks&quot;. He was doing card and coin manipulations (now you see it now <br/>
you don&#39;t) a la Jeff McBride, storytelling a la Eugene Berger, and and <br/>
characters a la Max Howard. It was amazing to see his thinking process <br/>
explode like that!<br/>
<br/>
As for algebra---go to the race track! &lt;G&gt; Handicaps in racing are a <br/>
practical use of algebra. <br/>
<br/>
Our favorite math game---hell our favorite GAME---is Zoombini&#39;s. Algebra, <br/>
logic, problem solving, strategy, calculus, all sorts of math junk---and it&#39;s <br/>
FUN! And you&#39;re NOT doing &quot;number exercises&quot;!<br/>

We have had Zoombinis for years, and the kids are all better at it than I am, <br/>
but<br/>
it&#39;s NOT math, it&#39;s just cartoons.  It&#39;s just playing on the computer.  <br/>
Because math looks like numbers, and there are no numerals anywhere in the <br/>
whole game.  (Oh.  Not counting that you have sixteen at a time and there&#39;s a <br/>
population count at the end, and you can only fill in so many in the <br/>
campground places...)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just playing.<br/>
Colors aren&#39;t math.<br/>
Hats and shoes aren&#39;t math.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(And I&#39;m just playing and being sarcastic for shock effect, but what if <br/>
people learn something from just playing?  There are articles online about <br/>
the depth of the mathematical experience of Zoombinis, but it works better if <br/>
the kids DON&#39;T know that, and the moms don&#39;t need to know it either.  If kids <br/>
knew what mathematical principles they were learning, they might not be <br/>
having NEARLY as much fun, so in the same way it doesn&#39;t make sense to kill <br/>
the goose to get the golden eggs out, don&#39;t kill a perfectly wonderful <br/>
golden-egg-laying computer game by cutting it open to find the math!)<br/>
