<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070264757">For some reason I don&#39;t know, I have a copy of a magazine called &quot;What is <br/>
Enlightenment?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mostly it has the air of a competition to become enlighteneder-than-thou and <br/>
NOW, and to wear nice clothes while doing it.   VERY high-pressure <br/>
enlightenment.    And there&#39;s a fullpage ad of someone&#39;s very vague claims, but two <br/>
phrases seemed to match recent discussions here:<br/>
&quot;If you believe physical death to be your destiny, why waste another thought <br/>
about your health and welfare? However, if you have even the slightest hint in <br/>
your heart that you were made to liave forever, then your health matters.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For $69.97 plus $10 postage, he&#39;ll tell you all about it, whatever &quot;it&quot; is.   <br/>
And will send extra audio CDs worth BIG bucks (in his eternal universe) and <br/>
sayd &quot;Giving you three albums for free is like laying sixteen $20 bills on the <br/>
table and saying &#39;Take it as a gift!&#39;&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
So cool.... He just gave me sixteen $20 bills, so sending him $70 bucks is <br/>
CHEAP!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling more enlightened already.   But that was an advertisement, not an <br/>
article.<br/>
<br/>
Does it matter, in a magazine, what&#39;s ad and what&#39;s article?   <br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, I looked the guy up and one website that was outing him said he had <br/>
ads in a Kung Fu magazine and is basically selling magnets.   Magnets to help <br/>
you live longer?   Forever?   This one seemed to lean toward herbs.<br/>
<br/>
Are magnets and herbs &quot;enlightenment&quot;?    Is living vaguely longer than you <br/>
would if you were to die &quot;enlightenment&quot;?   <br/>
<br/>
I think enlightenment is when your thoughts are clearer and you&#39;re not so <br/>
much in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
IF (big if) this guy DOES have information that would help people not to age, <br/>
and to feel better, and if were very enlightened, wouldn&#39;t he maybe be giving <br/>
that away free for nothing?<br/>
<br/>
I do think people should do good things in their lives, and consider moods <br/>
and posture and exercise and remember to drink water and to look at the sky and <br/>
the breathe.   Yoga can be cool.   Meditation can be wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
None of those things will give you eternal life, nor even maybe a longer <br/>
life.   <br/>
<br/>
The best any of them can do is give you a better self.   If your real self is <br/>
better, then now is better and later isn&#39;t going to matter so much (though <br/>
later is quite likely to be better if you figure out how to make now better, <br/>
because if you can make today good, you can make EVERY day better).<br/>

<br/>
Changing the subject specifically to magazines, I wanted to mention one <br/>
that I&#39;ve heard recommended that sounds fun.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s called Make magazine:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.makezine.com/volumes/">http://www.makezine.com/volumes/</a><br/>
<br/>
And it seems to be devoted to high-tech do-it-yourself projects that are <br/>
pretty whizzy.  (I haven&#39;t read it, but I&#39;ve read about it... for what <br/>
it&#39;s worth.)<br/>
<br/>
(One of the projects referenced is a lego pinball machine that took 300 <br/>
hours to make.)<br/>
