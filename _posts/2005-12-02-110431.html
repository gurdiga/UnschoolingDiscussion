<div id="ygrps-yiv-197745170">&quot; Your sense of self will cease unexpectedly. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I got this &quot;fortune&quot; from a Neopets &quot;Island Mystic.&quot;   It&#39;s a column A, <br/>
column B, column C random construct, I&#39;m sure, but I thought it was interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Just this morning while doing dishes I was thinking about the simple but <br/>
serious dilemma involved with discussing unschooling, which is (I think, this <br/>
morning) that some people want to do it without changing themselves or their <br/>
families or their relationships and others believe that the change is what does it <br/>
altogether.<br/>
<br/>
And I was thinking about philosophy (the idea of it) and spirituality (the <br/>
reality of the effect of spirituality) and was thinking about the brain research <br/>
that says there&#39;s a place in your brain that is stimulated during meditation <br/>
or prayer, and that the sense of being one with the universe has a physical <br/>
(physical meaning biochemical, so physical on a cellular level) reality.<br/>
<br/>
Probably feeling &quot;one with&quot; one&#39;s children is some of that.   Probably the <br/>
difference between feeling adversarial (separate and &quot;right&quot; or martyred or <br/>
resentful) and feeling that you are your child&#39;s partner and ally has something to <br/>
do with that part of the brain.<br/>
<br/>
And if so, this all probably has something to do with Howard Gardner&#39;s <br/>
intrapersonal intelligence (knowledge of self) and the <br/>
proposed-but-not-fully-accepted intelligence being referred to as metaphysical or spiritual.<br/>
<br/>
Then my dishes were clean and I stopped thinking about it, until I was <br/>
playing Neopets and wondering whether the unexpected cessation of one&#39;s sense of <br/>
self was a bad thing, or maybe kind of a good thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Could be either I suppose - depends on whether it&#39;s in the <br/>
meditation/Zen-like positive losing self in a greater whole, one of <br/>
those transcendent type moments that pop up often (usually?) without <br/>
planning or expectation. Or it could be a more negative type as in <br/>
suddenly having an earthquake-like blast that shakes the very <br/>
foundations of self you thought were stable (maybe similar to a <br/>
grown person suddenly finding out that s/he was adopted and mom is <br/>
actually grandma and sister is actually mom and uncle bill is <br/>
actually dad).<br/>
<br/>
(and it might be fun to play with it a bit - we typically add the <br/>
phrase &quot;in bed&quot; to all fortunes just to &#39;spice&#39; things up a bit lol)<br/>
