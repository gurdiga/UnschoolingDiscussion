<div id="ygrps-yiv-647605494">below is the response I sent to Froma Harrop and the Seattle Times.<br/>
<br/>
As a homeschooling parent, I am very offended by the inflammatory statements made in your editorial in the Seattle Times on June 28, 2001. You start your first paragraph by joining two people who are in extremely differing circumstances. The first is a confirmed murderess of her own children. The second has never had the charges against her substantiated. <br/>
In your next paragraph, you identify homeschooling as a socially isolating situation. Most of the homeschooling families I personally know have lots of differing social situations going on. In an average week in our home, maybe one or two days are spent at home without social contact.The remainder we engage in varying activities, such as soccer or baseball teams, summer camp, Royal Rangers(similar to Boy Scouts),field trips, the library, visiting and helping neighbors, learning life skills like shopping and interacting with business people in the community.<br/>
Your next statement accuses homeschoolers as having a propaganda machine. Have you ever listened to many statements of the NEA? Many have said the same of them. <br/>
How did you come to the conclusion &quot;modern home-schooling got its start among left-wing dropouts in the &#39;60s.&quot;? Most of what I have read and studied about the beginnings of the movement came about at frustration of the public school system not really educating. You state the current success in testing is probably related to the affluence and education of parents, but studies have shown education level and income do not have an impact on home-schoolers&#39; standardized test scores in any substantial way. there is an organization called National Home Education Research Institute which has studied this issue and you can learn more by contacting them at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nheri.org">http://www.nheri.org</a> for further information. Adversely, parents of higher education and income tend to have better performing children in public schools. That has been statistically proven also. <br/>
You question the motives of homeschooling parents and give two possible values, either we are protecting our children from the outside world or can&#39;t get along with others. I refute that statement. I think the public school system is absurd in what it teaches and how it teaches. I want my children to be able to relate and communicate with people of all ages and social classes, not just their immediate peers. I want them to learn life skills they can really use as adults, not to feel like everyone else controls their time and what they do. I want my children to be able to question and reason so their convictions and beliefs are theirs, not fed to them by someone else. I am sorry a few bad examples have left a foul taste in your mouth, but I know of many more public school abuses that are just as tragic and violent as the ones you have cited and the public school system and social service agencies were not the white knight you seem to think they are. For example, high school children forced to be strip searched as part of a jail field trip,  teachers exchanging a young girl&#39;s virginity for grades, or teachers trading sexual relationships for murder. Most home-schoolers love their children and want them to succeed in life whatever roads they choose. Don&#39;t try to deny many the freedom to do good because of a few poor examples you consider failures. <br/>

sent to the paper. Even people who do not homeschool were offended.<br/>
