he didn&#39;t intend to look at Joyce&#39;s site, Pam&#39;s, unschooling.info or my site <br/>
because he didn&#39;t want dogma.   <br/>

I nearly enjoyed reading this, from him to me, in private mail:<br/>

Lest I be accused of quoting out of context, it&#39;s below in its entirety, with <br/>
the response to which it referred. For the record, I&#39;m posting this because <br/>
it&#39;s amusing, and after a long week of discussions in which our experiences are <br/>
slapped aside and   we are left to feel very badly for young children in <br/>
families in which the parents think they can MAKE them read, levity can be <br/>
healing.   The &quot;you are free to post this&quot; was the second &quot;Pandora&quot; thing.<br/>

-=-You are free to post this to your list.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Of course I am, but I&#39;m not going to post it because it&#39;s nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just in case you interpret my last message incorrectly,<br/>
what I was referring to, was that now that you&#39;ve got<br/>
people thinking about these things,  -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
John Holt and other school reformers got people thinking about these things <br/>
long before I had children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-they are (like the children) going to what to know the other side<br/>
and they&#39;re going to start looking. -=-<br/>
<br/>
There is not one single unschooler who is unfamiliar with the school system.  <br/>
Of the THOUSANDS who communicate about unschooling online, in magazines (Live <br/>
Free Learn Free; Life Learning; Home Education Magazine--I got The Link <br/>
newsletter today, and it has two artilcles on unschooling), on radio shows, at <br/>
conferences and in person, many have been teachers, and some are STILL teachers.  <br/>
Most of their kids were in school.  Many of them used to be school-at-home <br/>
families, but found that running an assembly line for one or two kids was <br/>
inefficient.   What is this &quot;other side&quot; you&#39;re imagining they need to &quot;start <br/>
looking&quot; for?  The newest of them seem to know more about school and home education <br/>
than you do.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  In order to sell &quot;Radical Unschooling&quot; you need to shelter people from <br/>
other perspectives-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m selling nothing.  People have been sharing these ideas for thirty years.  <br/>
Where have YOU been?<br/>
<br/>
-=-What you&#39;re doing to people and children is unethical.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not the arbiter of ethics, that&#39;s for certain.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not doing anything &quot;to people.&quot;<br/>
What I&#39;m doing is writing.  You do that.<br/>
<br/>
The difference is that I&#39;m writing about something I&#39;ve been doing for <br/>
fifteen years. <br/>
You just seem to be writing whatever you think will get you attention.<br/>
<br/>
If you would stop ranting and trying to stir people up about nothing and <br/>
spend more time with your children, their lives would be much better, your life <br/>
would be better, and the world would be better.<br/>
<br/>
Pandora&#39;s box was not full of joy, peace and choices.<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t hiding anything away or sheltering people from other <br/>
ideas. <br/>
There is no box.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling and unschoolers exist in the whole real world every day.  There <br/>
are no &quot;school days,&quot; there is no &quot;non-educational.&quot;  There is the world, and <br/>
there is learning. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t own unschooling.  Our list isn&#39;t the only unschooling list.  I just <br/>
put unschooling in the yahoogroups search and got 563 results.  <br/>
Google.com: <br/>
Results 1 - 10 of about 367,000 for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
How is it you&#39;re so hyperactively trying to blame me, and one discussion <br/>
list, for your personal ignorance?<br/>

His response:<br/>
=====================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 You really know very little about education, psychology, social dynamics,<br/>
<br/>
 or much of anything else other than your *way.*  I&#39;ve been fighting<br/>
<br/>
 conventional educators for more than ten years and on a personal<br/>
<br/>
 level since I dropped out of high school.  I think very little<br/>
<br/>
 of the public schools, which is why we are homeschooling.  The only<br/>
<br/>
 way you can not show your ignorance is to silence others.  I picked<br/>
<br/>
 your unschooler group because it was at the top of the Yahoo search<br/>
<br/>
 I did and BECAUSE your group description said that people have to<br/>
<br/>
 be able to come out of their &quot;comfort zones.&quot;  I have a genuine interest<br/>
<br/>
 in unschooling for both professional and personal reasons, but <br/>
coincidentally<br/>
<br/>
 I happen to enjoy battling ignorance and censorship which is one reason I&#39;m<br/>
<br/>
 still hanging around your group and I must admit that there is still<br/>
<br/>
 something there to learn.  Don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll move on in a while and you<br/>
<br/>
 can preach to your converts in peace.  Oh, and please tell me that<br/>
<br/>
 you don&#39;t derive any income from your activities so that I can believe you<br/>
<br/>
 when you say you don&#39;t profit from this.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I really hope this guy never gets a PhD in education.   I&#39;m sorry to hear <br/>
he&#39;s teaching (if he actually is) in a university.   <br/>
<br/>
The only way I can not show my ignorance is to silence others.<br/>
Is that intended to   mean that if I were to unloose the silencing spells, my <br/>
ignorance would show?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one of those statements that&#39;s fun to just turn over in my mind, kind of <br/>
like finding an interesting little rock and carrying it in my pocket for a <br/>
while, to feel it and look at it and wonder how it got that way.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; You really know very little about education, psychology, social dynamics, <br/>
or much of anything else other than your *way.* &quot;<br/>
and<br/>
&quot;The only way you can not show your ignorance is to silence others.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Interesting little nuggets.<br/>
