<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997270249">I just walked past my 3 yo son&#39;s room as he was playing Blue&#39;s Clues <br/>
Art CD on his computer.  The animated character said to him, &quot;wow, <br/>
you must be a shape expert or something!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wondering how you all feel about praising children.  My son seems to <br/>
need it, but he also gives praise a lot to others.  Is telling <br/>
him, &quot;good job!&quot; too much making him dependent on others&#39; approval?<br/>
<br/>
Lately when he says, &quot;so what do you think about that, Mom?&quot; I try to <br/>
re-direct him and say, &quot;what do YOU think about it, Zach?&quot;  He&#39;ll <br/>
say, &quot;I like it!&quot; or something, and then I&#39;ll assure him that THAT is <br/>
what counts.  Comments?<br/>
<br/>
Side note: we also say, &quot;I love you&quot; a lot in this house.  Now I&#39;m <br/>
wondering if we do it too much, and he needs that constant <br/>
reassurance<br/>

<br/>
I think &quot;good job&quot; is vague and starts to go unheard.<br/>
And if you say &quot;You are great,&quot; that might be something he comes to need, and <br/>
it&#39;s also the kind of thing that defines him (in ways you don&#39;t really have <br/>
the power or authority to do, like just because a parent tells a kid &quot;You&#39;re <br/>
really gorgeous and smart!&quot; that doesn&#39;t mean that objectively she&#39;s gorgeous <br/>
and smarter than all other kids, but she might take it that way, as something <br/>
to take to the social bank; I think that&#39;s harmful)  [punctuation went to <br/>
hell, going to another paragraph...]<br/>
<br/>
What I think is good and honest and not harmful is if parents say what THEY <br/>
think and how their child is making them feel.   Some I&#39;ve used lately and <br/>
thought &quot;Oh, good one&quot; instead of &quot;DOH!&quot; when I said it:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I like to hear you singing around the house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m really glad you and Marty are getting along these days.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thanks for helping me move that stuff.  I really appreciate it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thanks for helping Holly.  I was getting impatient with her.  I&#39;m glad you <br/>
weren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re so fun to talk to!&quot;<br/>

I rec&#39;d a tip from an older friend of mine, when my kids were young.  Instead <br/>
of saying, &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you!&quot; to her children, she would say, &quot;You must <br/>
be so proud of yourself!&quot; whenever they would do something nice for someone <br/>
else or do something well.  Isn&#39;t that great?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-89003240">I&#39;m of the opinion that, so long as it&#39;s true, you CAN NEVER SAY I LOVE YOU<br/>
TOO MUCH.  Can&#39;t be done<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with this!  I tell my kids I love them all the time, or so I <br/>
thought.  The other day my almost 5 year old son wandered off in Target and I <br/>
had to get help finding him.  My almost 4 daughter and I were really scared.  <br/>
He was fine, playing with the wedding registry computer by the door.  When we <br/>
got to the car I asked him what he thought I should do - I was pretty upset, <br/>
frightened, frustrated, but not yelling (thankfully) - to make sure he <br/>
listens to my warnings about staying close to me.  He was quiet for a while <br/>
and then said softly &quot;You could love me more.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Now I don&#39;t think he believes I don&#39;t love him.  But I think he has a hard <br/>
time understanding that I can love him and not be happy about what he is <br/>
doing.  I had really helped me, and helped our relationship, that he said <br/>
that to me.  I&#39;m so glad I asked!  I have been really listening to the words <br/>
I choose when I speak to him and trying to put them through his filter.  <br/>
Trying to understand where he is coming from to get at why he does what he <br/>
does.  <br/>
<br/>
OK, now I&#39;m not sure my story has much to do with the original post, but I <br/>
wanted to share.  I need to breathe and listen more.  My children are such <br/>
great teachers!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been trying to stop praising the kids for *good behaviour* and thanking<br/>
them more for their help/cooperation. I&#39;ve seen my boys straighten up<br/>
alittle and smile at my words of appreciation and they want to help me far<br/>
more often than they did before.<br/>
<br/>
They have always been lovely kids, helpful and kind, but it seems that in<br/>
changing the way I speak to them I&#39;ve given them back their dignity. They<br/>
are walking tall and responding with a lot of love.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s quite amazing to watch. Makes me want to cry and laugh at the same<br/>
time.<br/>
