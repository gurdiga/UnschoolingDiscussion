&lt;&lt; Did your kids ever feel as though they weren&#39;t doing anything? When I try <br/>
to give mine the space they complain they aren&#39;t learning anything.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

have you simply told them that it has now become their job to learn?  i <br/>
forget your children&#39;s ages, but my 10 and 7 yo&#39;s know that it is in their <br/>
laps.  it unleashes great creativity on their part!  <br/>

    We are working on that and it is getting better. I am being careful <br/>
though since dh is not totally supportive and does not begin to understand <br/>
what unschooling is. I don&#39;t dare explain itto him, yet I do have to prod <br/>
them along so he doesn&#39;t panic.         (How about that sentence, whew!)<br/>
I&#39;m not even completely comfortable with it yet because it is so new. We have <br/>
had kids IN school for over 20 yrs. Unchooling is a big transition. It is <br/>
where I want to go but the journey is sooo painful.<br/>
