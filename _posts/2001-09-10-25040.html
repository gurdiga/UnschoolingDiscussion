<div id="ygrps-yiv-414877498">I love these things!<br/>
I&#39;m living with my second one. We dug the first one in the Philadelphia<br/>
suburbs, it was three years old when we left it. Now our new pond in the<br/>
Denver suburbs is 16 months old. No pumps or filters in either one. I<br/>
suggest reading as many books as you can find at your local library<br/>
before you start or get too far on a project like this, but don&#39;t let the<br/>
&quot;must have filtration&quot; books discourage you. How many natural ponds do<br/>
you see with extension cords running up to them?;-) We used rubber<br/>
roofing to line our ponds covered in clay soil and gravel. Rubber roofing<br/>
is the same as but cheaper than pond liners, but check to make sure the<br/>
rubber&#39;s not toxic. A couple things to keep in mind are: The larger the<br/>
surface area of the water the better for oxygenating the water. Fish eat<br/>
algae and larvae. Gold fish and minnows have been very happy in these<br/>
ponds, but larger fish like Koi demand a filtration system. Plants below<br/>
the surface make oxygen and eat up (filter) the nutrients (the fish leave<br/>
behind) that cause algae. Surface floating plants like water hyacinths,<br/>
water lilies, and parrot feathers block the sun from growing algae. I<br/>
think the rule I read was 2/3 of the water surface should be covered with<br/>
plants. If you want to attract wildlife it&#39;s a good idea to dig a gentle<br/>
slope into part of the pond for easy access. We&#39;ve found local turtles,<br/>
frogs, snakes, squirrels, birds, gophers, dogs, cats and smelled skunks<br/>
that have visited for a drink, swim, or bath at one time or another. You<br/>
must dig at least 3 ft down in at least one part of the pond if you get<br/>
cold winters and you want to keep your fish outside. Winter in Pa. was<br/>
kinder to the pond. The kids would slide across the frozen pond for a<br/>
week or two then be totally amazed to find the fish were still alive as<br/>
it defrosted. Co. has been a different story. The pond stayed frozen for<br/>
months, then the fish floated lifelessly to the surface in the spring. To<br/>
our surprise after we put in another dozen feeder goldfish this spring an<br/>
army of baby gold fish hatched from below. We&#39;re guessing last years fish<br/>
left behind the new generation. This year we&#39;re going to try to keep at<br/>
least one hole melted in the ice to help vent any gases that might build<br/>
up from decaying plants below and give the fish some air. I use bird<br/>
netting in the fall to keep out the majority of the falling leaves to<br/>
help keep the pond clean. Like life itself the pond is a never ending<br/>
experiment. It&#39;s great when we find frog eggs and baby minnows and<br/>
goldfish , it&#39;s a sign that the pond is doing good. I think it&#39;s a<br/>
wonderfully fun learning experience for the whole family. Have fun with<br/>
it!<br/>
