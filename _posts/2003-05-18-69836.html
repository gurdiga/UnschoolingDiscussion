<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745942820">&lt;&lt; Apparently yes, because it sure sounded like she was calling me a friggin <br/>
idiot, so if I heard it so much differently than it was meant to be, guess I <br/>
am a friggin idiot.&gt;&gt;  <br/>
 <br/>
That is so sad! Be your own person. You are not an idiot just because someone <br/>
may have called you one, which IMO she did not. I&#39;m not saying that the <br/>
choice of words were right but I think that people were trying to get you to <br/>
see that what you did with your daughter in regard to smoking was wrong, no <br/>
one was picking on you. If they didn&#39;t care for you to get unschooling right <br/>
then they wouldn&#39;t bother with you. I am glad that they pointed this out <br/>
because being new to unschooling, what you suggested about smoking, I may <br/>
have tried with our son. The debate was helpful for me and maybe other new <br/>
people here to see how harmful something like that can be to our children. <br/>
There is no reason to be defensive, we all make mistakes with our children, <br/>
and sometimes we make mistakes in how clear our writing is. You have to be <br/>
willing to accept this in life and move on. I do believe it is rude if you <br/>
are new to this list, be it two months or six, to be giving advice to other <br/>
people that come on the list for unschooling advice. That is what Sandra and <br/>
the others are here for weather you &quot;get it&quot; or not.<br/>

<br/>
In that instance it was because she had suggested that we were sitting home <br/>
unschooling instead of making the world a safer place for children.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; If they didn&#39;t care for you to get unschooling right <br/>
then they wouldn&#39;t bother with you. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At this point I no longer believe she had the desire to get unschooling <br/>
right, just to see her words come back to her by e-mail, which could be done <br/>
easily without sending them to this list.<br/>
<br/>
Some new list members give great advice.  It has more to do with clarity <br/>
about what unschooling is and isn&#39;t than with the amount of time they&#39;ve been <br/>
here.  <br/>

Oh, I can see that now. I went back and read that post again. I can <br/>
see where that comment would have people upset.<br/>

I think some new members actually do give wonderful advice. The <br/>
comment was directed towards Glena and only her. I don&#39;t think<br/>
weather <br/>
she has been here 2 months or 6 (don&#39;t know how long she&#39;s been here) <br/>
that she should be giving people advice because I don&#39;t believe she <br/>
gets unschooling even though she says she does.<br/>
<br/>
Not to be directed towards anyone else- <br/>
<br/>

That was meant for her not all the wonderful new people on the list <br/>
that offer such wonderful advice.<br/>
