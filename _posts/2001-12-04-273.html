<div id="ygrps-yiv-567284829">Fascinating reading here! Nice to see so many old friends, new <br/>
friends, and such interesting, engaging conversation! Way to go, <br/>
Sandra! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We finally got the Jan/Feb issue off to the printer, and we&#39;re happy <br/>
with this one. Still not that full color glossy throughout that we <br/>
were hoping to produce by this time, but we&#39;re getting there. I think <br/>
we&#39;d have made it if not for my Dad&#39;s medical setbacks this fall - <br/>
those weeks and months took a lot away from the business that we&#39;re <br/>
just now catching up with. Not complaining, mind you - not when I <br/>
consider how close we came to losing him this time. Dad&#39;s still <br/>
paralyzed on his left side (stroke), but Mark and I are heading over <br/>
to play pinochile with them this evening, for the first time in <br/>
almost three months.<br/>
<br/>
I got a chuckle out of Sandra&#39;s reply to Laura - and Samantha&#39;s <br/>
response. &lt;g&gt; Interesting how many people fess up to having done <br/>
drugs 20-30 years ago... Alaskans are trying to decriminalize <br/>
possession again - it was for a while in the &#39;70&#39;s (or was it the <br/>
&#39;80&#39;s?), and the attitude up there is still more laid back than <br/>
anyplace I&#39;ve ever seen. Long, dark, cold winter nights and all that <br/>
rot... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like the thread about math and religion. Something about them <br/>
sharing a kind of orderliness and predictability... makes sense. I&#39;ve <br/>
never been much good at either (orderliness or predictability), <br/>
preferring to chase wild hairs more often than not, but it&#39;s somehow <br/>
vaguely reassuring to know that many people do concern themselves <br/>
with such things. Like it&#39;s okay for me to be crazy as long as you&#39;re <br/>
not. Does that make any sense? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

82.<br/>
I remember my astonishment at people just walking around in public,<br/>
smoking.<br/>
My then house mate, now husband, was growing some lovely plants right<br/>
there in the sun room, in front of God and everyone. Oh, they were<br/>
beautiful.  We discovered something though.  Cats love marijuana plants. <br/>
Mr. Hairy Potter left the door open one day and  when we returned there<br/>
wasn&#39;t a bud left.  <br/>
I had some gloriously happy cats for a few days. = )<br/>
