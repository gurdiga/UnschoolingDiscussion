<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077979789">I am going to hope for the best. Maybe Laurie&#39;s grandchildren will <br/>
laugh at all we went through to convince others that unschooling is <br/>
the only sane way to raise kids. <br/>
<br/>
I made the point in my book that Yes, Laurie has a high IQ, <br/>
BUT...that is not why the unschooling worked so well.  Success is not <br/>
measured by intelligence, but by a belief in yourself that comes with <br/>
self-confidence, self-discipline, and self respect. These things are <br/>
available to all kids whose parents nurture these qualities in them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-790053254">Your right Ambersand, but the more voices we have, like books, the more clout we have.  And I am glad you can write Valerie!  You speak for many of us!  I can remember hearing about homeschooling in general a loooong time ago, I thought it was for gifted and genius children only, but now it is a huge movement and hopefully, so will unschooling be!<br/>
