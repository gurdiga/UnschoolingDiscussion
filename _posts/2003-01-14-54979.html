sure why I do.  Not sure if it was growing up poor so when we did have the <br/>
candy we ate it in a hurry and ate as much as we could.  Or if it is just <br/>
some chemical reaction in my body.  When insulin is released it triggers the <br/>
craving to eat more.  And candy is digested so quickly.  I probably won&#39;t <br/>
limit myself to only M&Ms though.  But am going to try to have the M&Ms in <br/>
the house all the time.  With no time limit on this so that I won&#39;t feel like <br/>
I have to eat them now because next week it will be back to normal.  Etc.  <br/>
Maybe it will teach me a valuable lesson about my eating habits overall.<br/>
Anyway just my thoughts, will let you know what happens.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-44017562">Once, in college, on my way to study for a test, I bought a half <br/>
pound of Smarties. Took them and myself upstairs to a little side <br/>
lounge, tucked myself into a chair, opened my books, opened my bag of <br/>
candy, and proceeded to eat all of those Smarties while I studied. By <br/>
the time I was done, I felt AWFUL. My hair was crawling, my teeth <br/>
hurt, my stomach was churning, I was jumpy and jittery, snappy. Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
And I never did THAT again! L<br/>
<br/>
This advice, to not limit yourself, is out there among the &quot;diet&quot; <br/>
people. When you say &quot;I can&#39;t have that, I&#39;m trying to lose weight&quot; <br/>
you set yourself up for cravings at the very least. In fact, I <br/>
remember reading somewhere, among women who withheld nothing from <br/>
themselves, weight went up initially, and then went down, because <br/>
they ate the junky stuff they&#39;d always denied themselves...for <br/>
awhile. And eventually got over it. <br/>
<br/>
peace, Heidi<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>really? I mean, people (like me) who say &quot;He&#39;d do nothing but watch <br/>
TV and play computer&quot; have never had that happen? <br/>
<br/>
Since Friday, when I announced &quot;no school today. I&#39;m taking a break&quot; <br/>
and left for my girlfriend&#39;s town to play, we have not done any <br/>
official lessons of any sort. I&#39;ve been VERY FOCUSED here, to my poor <br/>
hubby&#39;s dismay...heck, this is how I learn. Build a bridge and <br/>
GETOVERIT! Besides which, it isn&#39;t like he&#39;s starving or clothed in <br/>
rags. I&#39;m taking care of things AND really focusing on this.<br/>
<br/>
My older girl has moved forward in her High School correspondence <br/>
courses, answered emails, and read. The two littles have palled <br/>
around. Lots of movies, lots of computer games, cleaned their rooms <br/>
and moved furniture around, played outside. They have played chess <br/>
and dominoes inside, and the card game War. Robby also made some kind <br/>
of mess in the kitchen sink with flour and water, thinking he would <br/>
be making bread dough. L Oh, Robby helped make bread, and Katie put <br/>
the dessert together for one meal. <br/>
<br/>
Because my mornings haven&#39;t been spent forcing them to get back to <br/>
work, I haven&#39;t been wiped out on kids by noon, and have actually <br/>
spent MORE time doing stuff with them. This is one of my major <br/>
complaints about K12, btw. you get so freaking busy &quot;doing school&quot; <br/>
that life gets left behind. This never happened before, when I was <br/>
generally following Robinson, with lots of KONOS ideas thrown in.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like I&#39;m &quot;getting&quot; this very rapidly, but actually nervous about <br/>
it. Hubby and I talked last night. He&#39;s been mellower, too, this <br/>
frontal-lobe-syndrome, rigid, can&#39;t handle doing things differently <br/>
(he used to grumble about the kids putting ranch dressing on their <br/>
broccoli or baked potatoes...&quot;That&#39;s for salads!&quot; LOL)...he was flat <br/>
grumpy for a day or so, and when I didn&#39;t make the kids sit down to <br/>
their studies, and just gave the okay for whatever, well, yesterday <br/>
HE was the one helping Robby finish cleaning up his room (cleaning <br/>
the rooms has taken two or three sessions so far. FlyLady taught me <br/>
that one: &quot;You can do anything for 15 minutes&quot;) and he was doing it <br/>
happily, without acting all frustrated and ticked off at the kid.<br/>
<br/>
If we are going to go more this direction, then we both need to be <br/>
able to chill. I asked him if he thought the game 24 would constitute <br/>
math. Yeah. What about dominoes. Yeah. What about building a house <br/>
with pattern blocks? yeah. Legos? ....What about asteroids on the <br/>
computer? Uh...neither one of us gets THAT, btw. And I know you guys <br/>
would say &quot;DOn&#39;t DO that. Just provide a rich environment and get <br/>
into life, and they&#39;ll pick stuff up that they need.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
well, anyway. Some decision is hatching in my head, whether it be to <br/>
totally unschool, or to go back to our relaxed, laid back style we&#39;ve <br/>
done for lo, these many years. THE decision that has been made: <br/>
never, ever devote whole sections of days, morning or afternoon, <br/>
to &quot;doing school.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
thanks, once again, for providing a canvas to splatter my thoughts <br/>
on! LOL<br/>

You need to move toward the point that you don&#39;t CARE what &quot;constitutes  <br/>
math,&quot; but that you&#39;re confident that math is in everything to some extent, <br/>
and that your children will extract it in their own way without your <br/>
direction.<br/>
