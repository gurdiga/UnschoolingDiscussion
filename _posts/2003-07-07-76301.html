<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Freshmen don&#39;t declare majors in any state university I&#39;ve ever heard<br/>
&gt; of.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had to declare my major as music as a freshman in order to keep my<br/>
scholarship.  Based on our declared majors, the university decided who got<br/>
into what classes.  (Majors had priority.)  Which was sad, because I had<br/>
wanted to double major in anthropology, but I couldn&#39;t get the classes I<br/>
needed to do it.  I wasn&#39;t allowed to declare a second major until I was a<br/>
sophomore or junior, and by then it was too late to get the sequence within<br/>
4 years.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; And high schools are the major source of the information that high<br/>
&gt; school is necessary for college! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I went to a smallish state university (Northern Iowa), and started taking<br/>
one class a semester in music when I was 15.  It was just cello lessons;<br/>
cheaper that way than paying the teacher outright, and he got credit for<br/>
teaching me on his schedule, too.  It took a one-page form to apply for<br/>
non-degree status at 15, and then when I was 17, I applied for degree status<br/>
(another one page form).  I finished high school, because my mother insisted<br/>
on it, but I wouldn&#39;t have needed to.  Nobody at the university cared that I<br/>
did.  <br/>

<br/>
In Iowa,  huh?  But just for scholarship purposes?<br/>
<br/>
How sad for the kids, at 17 or 18, to be fored to declare before they could <br/>
check out the things they had never heard of.<br/>
<br/>
I hope they weren&#39;t making it too horribly difficult to change majors.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448790945">My experience was that changing majors, or not declaring one at the outset, makes it very hard to get through college in 4 years.<br/>
<br/>
Not that finishing in 4 years needs to be a goal, but it&#39;s expensive to be there in the first place!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Things may have changed with time (it was longer ago than I like to admit!), but we had to apply to the University of New Hampshire in our major as they limited the number of students admitted by major.  Seems the other state universities I applies to were the same way, at least I know that I was declaring a major up front.<br/>

<br/>
Or the opposite.  Kids have to take general courses the first semester, <br/>
sometimes the first two years, before they can load up on the stuff they WANT to <br/>
learn.  <br/>
<br/>
My bro is going to college in the fall, and they picked his classes FOR HIM <br/>
for the first semester.  Ick.  I just don&#39;t get the well rounded educational <br/>
theory enough to think that it&#39;s a good idea for him to force him to take Soc <br/>
101 when he wants to be a computer engineer.  <br/>
