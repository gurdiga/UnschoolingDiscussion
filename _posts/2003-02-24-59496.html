See if your library has a subscription to HOME POWER The Hands-On Journal <br/>
of Home-Made Power.  It&#39;s the big numbero-uno when it comes to alternative <br/>
energy mags.  They cover hydro, photo, wind and even biofuels (like <br/>
biodiesel.)  ...and solar doesn&#39;t just cover electricity, but also space <br/>
and water heating, never mind water and waste sterilization, etc.  Pretty <br/>
cool stuff.  For $22.50 a year, you can get your own subscription.<br/>

If you want the adorable-factor, I think the powerpods are kind of <br/>
cute.  He might like looking at those.  I think it&#39;s powerpod.com, but I <br/>
could be wrong.  WAY too cute.<br/>
<br/>
There are a TON of websites out there too, but none that really seem to <br/>
give an over-all view.  They&#39;ve seemed very focused on their own areas (ie, <br/>
pv or hydro or heating or purification or etc.)<br/>
<br/>
If he wants to chat alternative energy with someone who&#39;s still pretty new <br/>
to it (and building a &#39;cabin&#39; in the woods no less!) feel free to send him <br/>
my offlist email (see header above.)<br/>
<br/>
Go Lars!!!<br/>

Friends of mine who have lived without electricity have used car batteries, <br/>
recharged with a gas powered generator (like portable welding machines have). <br/>
 It&#39;s not wholly alternative.  Some people use the modern little windmills, <br/>
but there&#39;s not a lot of wind where we are except in March and April.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing he already knows about the big old-timey windmills on wooden <br/>
frames that people use to pump water for cattle.<br/>

  Lars told me tonight that he wanted to research alternative energy as might<br/>
  be used by someone building a cabin in the woods or something.  Anybody have<br/>
  any really good resource ideas I can steer him to?  I found a couple of<br/>
  homesteading sites that had stuff about alternative energy to get him<br/>
  started, but maybe someone knows of a great website or book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957868543">Remember me asking about alternative energy?  I found some stuff, but not<br/>
quite what we were looking for.  Then someone sent this to the hs-ca list<br/>
today.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.re-energy.ca">http://www.re-energy.ca</a><br/>
It&#39;s just what we were looking for.  I&#39;m going to buy what we need to make<br/>
the water-power generator tomorrow.  Maybe it will be useful for someone<br/>
else.<br/>
