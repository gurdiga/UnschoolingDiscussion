<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123986491">Well, we finally found out where the Air Force is sending us: <br/>
Laughlin AFB in Del Rio, TX. Del Rio is a small (40,000) town 150 <br/>
miles west of San Antonio, 5 miles from the Rio Grande and Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rather unsure about living in a small town, given that I&#39;ve <br/>
lived in a city or close suburbs all my life. <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s another unschooler in the town! That&#39;s <br/>
a disappointment, but I&#39;m not above trying to convert a few school-<br/>
at-homers to our ways &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I keep telling myself that most of what we do here, we can do <br/>
anywhere. And it won&#39;t be cold in winter and swampy year-round <br/>
(we&#39;re in D.C.). My kids are little (5, almost 3 and 7.5 months).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a big reservoir (Lake Amistad) nearby, which means water <br/>
sports and some touristy things in town because of the people who <br/>
come for bird watching and fishing.<br/>
<br/>
Any one want to share &quot;day in the life of&quot; stories from small-ish <br/>
towns?? My head believes we&#39;ll do great--after settling in--but my <br/>
heart is still disappointed that a position in Colorado Springs <br/>
didn&#39;t work out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-684185879">My sister and her family lived in Laughlin AFB for 5 years. They left about<br/>
18 months ago.  They enjoyed it there (and coming from over 10 years in<br/>
Marquette, MI and North Dakota, they loved the weather!).  My sister hated<br/>
the schools..but that won&#39;t be a problem for you! :-)<br/>

finally found out where the Air Force is sending us: <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Laughlin AFB in Del Rio, TX. Del Rio is a small (40,000) town 150 <br/>
&gt; miles west of San Antonio, 5 miles from the Rio Grande and Mexico.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL...as a girl coming from a town with a population of only 1300 and <br/>
seeing someone write down, that a town with 40,000 inhabitants is <br/>
small.  One stoplight in Mancelona, MI.  Of course another town close <br/>
to that Alba, MI only has one blinking yellow light and their <br/>
population is only in the lower-mid hundreds.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope that you can meet or start a good group out your way.<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes<br/>

Oh gosh, you don&#39;t need much at all in a small town with kids that  little.  <br/>
Any little thing is interesting to a 5 year old!  I live in a  small town, and <br/>
I have a 12 yo and he&#39;s long past the stage of an outing at the  park or at <br/>
the local waterfall.  Just make sure you can get out of the  house often.  <br/>
 <br/>
Get the local chamber of commerce stuff and go see everything in it.   Make <br/>
sure you subscribe to the town newspaper and check the community  <br/>
announcements, etc.  Learn about the town and meet the people, you  know?  Try all the <br/>
grocery stores, get to know the librarian, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
I love my small town life.<br/>

I think most of the accounts here are edges of towns or small towns:<br/>

 </span></blockquote> I know just how you feel!  A few years ago, my husband (also Air <br/>
Force) found out that we would be moving to Colorado Springs.  We were <br/>
all SO excited!  Then the assignment got canceled - I cried.  We ended <br/>
up going to Turkey, yes Turkey.  A far cry from Colorado, but now we <br/>
are in the northwest, which we&#39;ve always wanted to try.  I hope that <br/>
you enjoy Texas.  And if you don&#39;t so much, at least you won&#39;t be <br/>
there forever :)<br/>
