<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324171542">I had my local focus group park day yesterday. I&#39;m in charge so I make it a <br/>
point to always be there. Unfortunately, the locals don&#39;t feel the same way. <br/>
Me and the kids were the only ones that showed up. Maybe it was the cold <br/>
that kept everyone away. It was in the low 70&#39;s. &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I told my kids they could play and when they all decided they wren&#39;t <br/>
having fun anymore, we would leave. Well a school bus came with kids and <br/>
they were about 5-6 years old. My three, who quickly make friends no matter <br/>
what the age is, were having a blast. The kids were there on the playground <br/>
for about 45 minutes. They had lunch previously in the pavillion. The <br/>
teachers rounded them all up and they left.<br/>
<br/>
My son came over and started to refelct as he always does on the situation. <br/>
He thought it was so sad that he made new friends and they were all having <br/>
such fun and then they had to leave. Even when they didn&#39;t want to. He asked <br/>
what they would be going back to do. I explained again what school is. It&#39;s <br/>
hard for him I guess to imagine such a thing. He again mentioned how sad it <br/>
was that the kids only got to play for such a short while every day. When I <br/>
explained that this park thing was probably not an every day outting for <br/>
them, he felt even worse. He just couldn&#39;t get why kids have to do such <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
They quickly made new friends with two little boys that were maybe playing <br/>
hooky or just off for the day. They were about 6 and 8. When they had to <br/>
leave, the kids found a birthday party of kids about 5 years old and played <br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
Being I had no one I knew to talk with I was able to observe more than <br/>
usual. I heard all these moms talking about not being able to wait to send <br/>
some of their kids to school next year. Some of the kids were 4. I watched <br/>
as some mothers hovered over the kids directing them and some gave them no <br/>
attention at all. I heard moms counting to 3 when problems arose. I saw kids <br/>
throwing fits and parents dragging them away kicking and screaming. I saw <br/>
all the 4 year olds head right for the playground, find sticks and started <br/>
&quot;shooting&quot; each other saying &quot;I&#39;ll kill you&quot; and &quot;I just shot you in the <br/>
back.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Boy did we all learn an awful lot yesterday at the park.<br/>

church&#39;s parking lot.  The boys had fun zooming all around, Cal said <br/>
he was going 456mph according to his &quot;speed monitor&quot;  LOL.. He does <br/>
have a speedometer on his bike, but hey, speed monitor works too.  <br/>
Lydie and I just sat in the van and talked.   OH,yeah, I went to the <br/>
Dollar store and racked up on lots of cheap gifts I can wrap up for <br/>
treats before Christmas OR I can use them for stocking stuffers if <br/>
they dont end up opening all of them.  Acutally, Phillip hasnt asked <br/>
to open any gifts today, but I did give him some new crayons <br/>
with &quot;flesh&quot; color in them to finish coloring Shaggy on his poster.  <br/>
I gotta go whip up some lunch.. Hope everyone else is having a good <br/>
day.  <br/>

I have to agree.  My son and his friends all did the cops and robbers thing, and the hunters thing.  The one thing we always made sure we taught them was that ANY gun is a gun and should be handled with respect.  So, while handling a toy gun, treat it as a real gun and use it like you would if it were real.<br/>

<br/>
In my experience it&#39;s more prevalent with school kids.<br/>
<br/>
MOST of what seems typical boy behavior disappears without school as the <br/>
cause and catalyst.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not so much the action as the attitude that I see different. <br/>
<br/>
Our homeschooling group, when the kids were little, had three families whose <br/>
kids hadn&#39;t been to school, and as other kids dropped out at various ages, <br/>
their common trait was suspicion, fear, and defensive meanness.  They assumed <br/>
the boys were going to be hateful, and so their actions and reactions the <br/>
first several meetings were guarded and sharp.   They softened up when they s<br/>
aw that our boys weren&#39;t pretending to be nice just to lure them in and hurt <br/>
them, they actually WERE  nicer than boys they were used to.<br/>

Did anyone see the big uproar over the toy that JC Penny offered in thier <br/>
catalog?  ( let me find the link) Shucks, they must have taken it out of the <br/>
catalog.  I cant find it.  It was a Military Command Center..  Looked like a <br/>
blown up house with a soldier and all his command post stuff.   I thought it <br/>
was pretty cool.  My boys are really into the military stuff right now.. GI <br/>
Joe and all of that.   The toy was on CNN I think or some other News show.. I <br/>
really need to do my research on this.. But, basically, lots of folks were <br/>
really upset over the toym, saying it bred hate and violence and glorified <br/>
war. <br/>

kinds. We have real live weapons, daggers, bow and arrows and bb gun. They <br/>
really love sword fighting with their SCA boffers, but they also act out gun <br/>
stuff if they don&#39;t have a realistic looking toy gun available. <br/>
My 22 mo. old got a plastic piece off of my mop ensemble that is &quot;L&quot; shaped <br/>
and is into blasting all of us into oblivion lately and laughing hysterically <br/>
when we drop dead!!<br/>
The less I made a big deal of it, the less they were obnoxious about it.<br/>
Weapons are just another way we learn about the world, another interesting <br/>
part of our lives. And my children are very non-violent, peace loving <br/>
individuals that get extremely distressed over war or people hurting each <br/>
other in any way.<br/>
Yet Trevor can tell the difference between oodles of military weapons, how <br/>
many rounds per minute most of them shoot, when the Gatlin gun was invented <br/>
and myriad factoids I am constantly amazed by.<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;Knowledge will not always take the place of simple observation.&quot;<br/>

homeschoolers we know is that the boys are, well, not very boy-ish to us <br/>
(realizing that we&#39;ve just made a judgement here).  The boys we know are &quot;not <br/>
allowed&quot; to play with guns, make guns, act with guns.  Michael likes to play <br/>
James Bond, jump off his bike, make &quot;bombs&quot;, etc.  These little kids are so <br/>
unlike Michael that he has a hard time fitting in.  Just so there&#39;s no <br/>
mistake, Michael doesn&#39;t point weapons at anyone, only imaginary &quot;bad guys&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if we (meaning Michael and I) need to redefine, somehow, our ideas <br/>
about &quot;boy&quot; behavior.  Maybe thats the problem?<br/>

<br/>
Well, the attitude is definitely different with the school kids we&#39;ve seen <br/>
that play like this.<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t needy about weaponry for one, so it&#39;s just another part of <br/>
life.<br/>
They aren&#39;t doing it to act out meanness or suffering, they JUST like weapons.<br/>
School kids are often acting out because they&#39;ve been bullied and such.<br/>
So yes, there is a big difference between playing with weapons and acting out <br/>
aggressions with weapons.<br/>
I just wanted to be fair and point out that homeschooled, peace loving <br/>
individuals could be really into weaponry and the play that surrounds it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The toy was on CNN I think or some other News show.. I <br/>
 really need to do my research on this.. But, basically, lots of folks were <br/>
 really upset over the toym, saying it bred hate and violence and glorified <br/>
 war.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, on that issue I have to admit a bit of sensitivity.<br/>
If my kids were absolutely wanting one, I wouldn&#39;t make a huge deal out of <br/>
it. But at the same time, making a toy out of what is a very serious issue <br/>
bothers me deeply.<br/>
Having weapons, learning about war etc.... has been a wonderful learning <br/>
experience for me, due to my child&#39;s fascination.<br/>
But showing a house ruined by war and making it a TOY? That did bother me.<br/>
My kids thought it was stupid when they saw it so it wasn&#39;t an issue.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s the other part of me that sees destruction as part of the <br/>
creative process. Not in a war type capacity, but kids love wrecking some <br/>
things as a creative outlet.<br/>
I can see them taking the dollhouse and making it look all wrecked, acting <br/>
out a tornado or something. Or maybe even a war if that&#39;s what they had been <br/>
learning about.<br/>
So then what&#39;s the difference between the kids turning a toy into a war torn <br/>
house and buying one that is already such?<br/>
I think the former is more worthy an activity because it came from within the <br/>
child....but even as I ponder it from this point of view, it really bothers <br/>
me to think about spending money on a toy that is making light of something <br/>
so hurtful and terrible.<br/>

Well I&#39;m so used to boys playing with boffers and toy guns that I didn&#39;t even <br/>
consider that the question had to do with guns.  I was thinking behavior <br/>
separate from props.<br/>
<br/>
I see gun-avoidance as one of the magical parenting acts (like forbidding TV <br/>
or banning commercial t-shirt logos or Disney sheets) which parents hope will <br/>
(magically) innoculate their children for their whole lives, somehow.<br/>

<br/>
Do toys necessarily &quot;make light&quot; though?  <br/>
When Barbie has a little sister, that&#39;s not making light of having a sister, <br/>
just because it&#39;s a toy.    When Ninja Turtles had nunchuku in the U.S. and <br/>
England didn&#39;t allow miniature plastic nunchuku, neither was &quot;making light&quot; <br/>
of anything.<br/>

talked about the toy with others.. ie, my husband, sister, friends. I began <br/>
to see it in a bit different light.    I showed  the link to the toy to a <br/>
good male friend of mine,and asked his reaction.  He said WOW!  COOL!  I wish <br/>
we had that when I was 10 yrs old  I said .. &quot;But the house is all blown up , <br/>
dont you think that is a bit extreme?&#39;  He replied. . Oh, nah, we pretended <br/>
to blow things up all the time when I was a kid.  That got me to thinking <br/>
about my own childrens play and how it is more creative in process than <br/>
destructive.    I didnt show the toy to JP, because I knew he would might <br/>
want it and   we really didnt have the $50 in our budget to buy it ( not even <br/>
for Xmas)  He DID ask for &#39;army men&quot; which he loves to sit up in formations <br/>
and then &quot;battle&quot; each other.    And he is getting a GI Joe action figure for <br/>
Christmas.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have to agree that it&#39;s very typical. My boys are into weapons of<br/>
&gt; all kinds. We have real live weapons, daggers, bow and arrows and bb<br/>
&gt; gun. They really love sword fighting with their SCA boffers, but they<br/>
&gt; also act out gun stuff if they don&#39;t have a realistic looking toy gun<br/>
&gt; available. My 22 mo. old got a plastic piece off of my mop ensemble<br/>
&gt; that is &quot;L&quot; shaped and is into blasting all of us into oblivion lately<br/>
&gt; and laughing hysterically when we drop dead!! The less I made a big<br/>
&gt; deal of it, the less they were obnoxious about it. Weapons are just<br/>
&gt; another way we learn about the world, another interesting part of our<br/>
&gt; lives. And my children are very non-violent, peace loving individuals<br/>
&gt; that get extremely distressed over war or people hurting each other in<br/>
&gt; any way. Yet Trevor can tell the difference between oodles of military<br/>
&gt; weapons, how many rounds per minute most of them shoot, when the<br/>
&gt; Gatlin gun was invented and myriad factoids I am constantly amazed by.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ren<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My boys run araound playing war games with swords and guns and <br/>
space rockets and they are also pacifists about war. They are also <br/>
very gentle and caring with animals and other people.<br/>

started shooting.<br/>

type this, Phillip has the plastic rod that is supposed to adust the <br/>

just watching himself in the mirror do &quot;moves&quot;  Whish, whish, <br/>
cchhhooo shhhhhinngggg..Actually,he looks pretty professional.  I <br/>
think there is a difference in how children play with weapons.  It <br/>
can be role playing, fantasizing, and acting out of things they have <br/>
seen or read.  It can be very creative and expressive.  And, I have <br/>
also seen children play with weapons that seem to be actually intent <br/>
on hurting someone.  They are more aggressive and they may be acting <br/>
out feelings of helplessness or rage.  I suppose unless we know the <br/>
child and thier family and situations on a personal level, it&#39;s hard <br/>
to know where thier inspiration and motivation lies in weapon play.  <br/>
The children on the playground may have had a running game that they <br/>
just naturally fell into.  I would be uncomfortable too if my <br/>
children were in a sitation where all the kids just started <br/>
yelling &quot;killing words&quot; because my kids wouldnt know what was going <br/>
on.   But it could have just been a fun game for these kids because <br/>
they were familar with it. <br/>
<br/>
Well Phillip has advanced from practing his moves to fighting the bed <br/>
posts.  :-)<br/>

Before my husband and I had kids, we went to see &quot;The Terminator.&quot;   I didn&#39;t <br/>
like it.  I covered my eyes a lot.  I was disturbed.  Not long after  we saw <br/>
&quot;Commando&quot; and I really liked it.  Wanted to see it again.<br/>
<br/>
Then KEITH was disturbed.  For one thing, he likes science fiction and <br/>
doesn&#39;t much like stories in modern settings.    He asked me why I never <br/>
wanted to see Terminator again, but enjoyed Commando.  I had to think about <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Commando had soldiers fighting soldiers.   And in defense of a little girl <br/>
(honorable touch).<br/>
Terminator had a crazed freak shooting housewives and mothers who were <br/>
minding their own business.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  It can be role playing, fantasizing, and acting out of things they have <br/>
seen or read.  It can be very creative and expressive.  And, I have <br/>
also seen children play with weapons that seem to be actually intent <br/>
on hurting someone.  They are more aggressive and they may be acting <br/>
out feelings of helplessness or rage.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was little he was a HUGE Ninja Turtles fan (still is; he said the <br/>
other day there&#39;s a new series of comics he wants).   He acted out all kinds <br/>
of Ninja Turtle stuff when he was little, but not on another person.  On <br/>
Shredder.  On the Rat King.<br/>
<br/>
His last karate belt test had a kata that looked like Steven Segal stuff.  It <br/>
was really impressive.  He was shy about it when we said &quot;Wow.&quot;  He&#39;s been in <br/>
a couple of real-life situations where others would have bristled up and <br/>
tried to be intimidating.  He was calm and used words.  Didn&#39;t even posture.  <br/>
Didn&#39;t even crack his knuckles and shake his hair. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, another friend of theirs is exercising daily and reporting how <br/>
many situps and push ups he can do, and getting kids to photograph him posing <br/>
to show his muscles, and seeking out situations where he can show off, and <br/>
reminding people who already know, again, how strong he is.   He&#39;s a needier <br/>
guy, emotionally and socially.  <br/>
<br/>
So there are lots of factors, but after the little-kid fantasy time starts to <br/>
fade the kids who are the most secure in their own lives will have the least <br/>
reason to have a bunch of big-boy and adult fantasies about doing violence, I <br/>
think.<br/>

Yes, I see this with my oldest ( now 22). He was &quot;obsessed&quot; with war, war games, military games, guns and weapons as a little kid but is kind of a pacifist now -  he is quiet and non aggressive, though still likes military history..Leonie W. <br/>
