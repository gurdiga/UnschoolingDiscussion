  them from the ceiling in our learning room. Has anyone done this and if so do

  will talk about each of the planets as we are making them, and the sun too.

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I was thinking that we would take a few weeks to do 
this and look up info on the net together on each planet as we go. Also, a few 
weeks ago I came across a site that had a space game you could print out and 
play together as a group. I was going to do this at the time but didn&#39;t have 
adobe. I downloaded the software and then it was late and I started having comp 
problems. I didn&#39;t bookmark the site. If anyone knows of what I am talking about 
I would apreciate the address or further info. The game had a game board, 
playing pieces, drawing cards and a spinner too I think. Corallyn</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720385303">We got a great book from the library (and eventually bought it through<br/>
Amazon.com) called Sticky Fingers: Space by Ting and Neil Morris (published<br/>
by Franklin Watts). It has lots of space-related activities and things to<br/>
make including a 3-D solar mobile. <br/>
<br/>
Here are some online sites for kids to visit (variety of age ranges, but<br/>
mostly younger):<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-962024468">Corallyn, Hi, I also have a 5 and 3 yo.  I am a bit behind on reading the <br/>
e-mail, but have been scanning through, noticing your interest in making the <br/>
solar system with your kids...Aside of making the planets from papier mache, <br/>
or clay, another idea to consider is making a mobile from thin cardboard <br/>
pieces that your kids could paint.  I have a mobile like this:  A cardboard <br/>
banner that says,&quot;The solar system&quot;--This has a hole punched at the top and <br/>
hangs from the ceiling;  underneath it is a oval shaped piece with part of <br/>
the sun on the left side, and the rest of the oval is black with orbit lines <br/>
drawn for each  planet.  These pieces are  attached to the banner above it by <br/>
punching holes and tying them;  underneath this are the planets in order.  <br/>
Each one is painted, has a hole punched at the top, and is tied to the orbit  <br/>
pathway line it corresponds to.  The whole mobile is about 3 1/2 feet long, <br/>
and looks  nice hanging.  It is something that will not be overly time <br/>
consuming ( which is good for young kids), and is inexpensive, too.  It is <br/>
also very lightweight, and easy to hang.    One other fun thing my kids got <br/>
into was making cardboard tube rockets.  We covered them with foil, and <br/>
stuffed yellow and orange tissue paper in the bottom for fire, and added a <br/>
paper cone on the top.  We used Pringles chips cans to make &quot;telescopes&quot;.  If <br/>
you are interested, hammer a nail hole in the  bottom of the empty can.  <br/>
trace the lid on black paper, and cut out the circle.  Take a straight pin, <br/>
and push holes in the paper.  Put it into the lid, and put the lid onto the <br/>
can.  Look through the hole at the bottom of the can, holding it up by a <br/>
window or other light source, and you will see &quot;stars in the night sky&quot;.  <br/>
Hope you and your little ones have fun learning about the planets.  ~Karen</div>

There is a fellow out west who has a display set up in & around his town <br/>
(he&#39;s a professor and that&#39;s all I remember, I think -- so how&#39;s that for <br/>
helpful).  Anyway, it is a terrific device for explaining the huge distances <br/>
involved between the planets.  You can walk to a couple but it takes so many <br/>
hours on a bike to get to Pluto, etc.  Maybe someone else remembers where <br/>
this is??<br/>
