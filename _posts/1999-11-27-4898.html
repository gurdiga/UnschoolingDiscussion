<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200789345">hi,<br/>
<br/>
our local homeschool group (aah - austin area homeschoolers) covered<br/>
this article  and the following was sent by peggy to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:dbiggers@...">dbiggers@...</a>. thought you might find it interesting.<br/>

Mr. Biggers:<br/>
<br/>
Please forward this letter on to Mr. Tom Danehy who is not listed as<br/>
part of your staff, nor does he have listed an<br/>
email address link from your page.  Might this lack of information be<br/>
due to his intolerance to email which would in<br/>
all probably, contradict his articles?<br/>
<br/>
I read the above referrenced article via the internet.  I am sure you<br/>
are receiving numerous letters opposing the<br/>
ideas of Mr. Danehy; so what&#39;s one more?<br/>
<br/>
I am very sorry for Mr. Danehy.  His life must be extremely closed off<br/>
from &quot;real&quot; (and very interesting) people and<br/>
his mind just a miniature, darkened forest of slow synaptic action.<br/>
Anyone, who in his apparent sincerety, believes<br/>
that all homeschoolers educate the same and for the same reasons is,<br/>
&lt;grin, tongue in cheek&gt;, grossly uneducated in<br/>
this particular subject.   However, the real problem I see is that he<br/>
has the temerity to produce such quibble on a<br/>
world-wide forum so that his ignorance is not only on display to the<br/>
inhabitants of Tucson,  but now, just envision<br/>
the multitude of people who have seen what type of person  (possibly the<br/>
Tuscon) public school system has<br/>
produced.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to give you a little education, Mr. Danehy.  I have been<br/>
home educating my sons since I was pregnant<br/>
with the first one.  My oldest is 9 and the younger son is 5.  My<br/>
husband and I both believe that there can be more<br/>
to education that what traditional schools are able to offer.  When a<br/>
child is in a classroom for most of the day, they<br/>
come home, are required to continue their education at the kitchen table<br/>
and then get ready for another day, just<br/>
like all the other ones; and thus, there is really no time left for<br/>
additional activities that the school is unable or<br/>
unwilling to provide.  Surely you could not argue that the influence of<br/>
the other students and the teacher would<br/>
outweigh the fundamental ideas of the child&#39;s parents.  This you might<br/>
be saying is good.  Well it isn&#39;t.  I will assume<br/>
also that you do not have children or do not have the luxury of &quot;really<br/>
knowing&quot; how and what your child thinks<br/>
and feels.  Most home educators are open minded and alert to the needs<br/>
and desires of their children.  We do not,<br/>
generally, want our children to have any predudices towards others.  As<br/>
a matter of fact, my boys do not yet, and<br/>
hopefully will not ever, have first hand knowledge of anyone being made<br/>
to feel inadequate because of their race or<br/>
their religion or their disability.   They are exposed, on a daily<br/>
basis, to many different life styles.  At  this point in<br/>
their lives, a difference is only a difference; it is in their minds a<br/>
natural co-existance.    They are not educated at<br/>
home in order to instill far right wing (or left wing) ideas.  We are<br/>
not &quot;religious wackos&quot; with an anti-government<br/>
agenda to fulfill.  I own my business( Plum Creek RV Resort ) and am not<br/>
a die-hard developer but not an extreme<br/>
environmentalist.  I have succeeded as an entrepreneur in my name<br/>
without assistance from anyone, except for<br/>
the people who I employ.  My husband has done the same.  And our<br/>
children are raised to believe in the &quot;American<br/>
Dream&quot; and that with hard work, it will come true.   I believe in<br/>
free-speech, free-will, and hopes for a  life of<br/>
happiness.  I am a christian who takes my children to Sunday School, but<br/>
that is not the basis for home educating.<br/>
When, what I call concentrated schooling, only takes up 3-4 hours each<br/>
day, the doors are opened to other, equally<br/>
educational opportunities.  My sons both participate in theatre class<br/>
with 2 productions each year (all of the cast<br/>
members are also home educated).  The oldest plays two instruments,<br/>
piano and guitar, both of which he performs<br/>
publically.  He is able to take lessons during the day from musicians<br/>
(two of them go out on  world tours).  These<br/>
activities would be greatly hindered should he be stuffed away in a<br/>
school all day, every day.  The youngest son is<br/>
learning to play the violin but due to the difference in interests (one<br/>
that I might be unaware of if I weren&#39;t his<br/>
teacher), we will focus on fine arts and allow him lessons with an<br/>
artist when he is ready.  They have quality<br/>
educational materials.  Some are purchased curriculums (just like the<br/>
public system school uses, by the way) and<br/>
some of the academics just come from our own imagination that we build<br/>
on, which requires some research from<br/>
the child and the parent.   I am qualified as a teacher because I am<br/>
their mother.  Noone wants a quality of life for<br/>
my sons as much as me.  I would not, in anyway destroy their mind or<br/>
their opportunity to succeed in their goals,<br/>
all of which require an education to obtain.<br/>
<br/>
My children can keep up with any child and surpass many, both<br/>
academically and socially.  Our schools, by the way,<br/>
may need a little of the fabric torn away.  Why, if the schools are in<br/>
such good shape, are so many people arguing the<br/>
the entire educational system in America needs serious attention.  Why<br/>
are there so many drop-outs?  Why are<br/>
SAT scores in low income neighborhoods so much lower than in white<br/>
collar neighborhoods?  Why, if the system is<br/>
as good as you purport, are so many parents enraged by what their<br/>
children are learning.  Why is there school<br/>
violence?  Think about these things when you open your mouth in public<br/>
or put your pen to the paper.<br/>

&quot;Poor Sports<br/>
     <br/>
         By Tom Danehy<br/>
<br/>
...I consider home schooling to be a subtle form of child abuse.<br/>
Furthermore, I believe that every single case of home schooling involves<br/>
certain amounts of either racism, paranoia, religious intolerance or<br/>
combinations thereof...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If a home-schooling parent were to search her soul (assuming she could<br/>
locate it), she&#39;d realize that the only reason she&#39;s keeping little Jacob<br/>
at home is so that he won&#39;t have to associate with my Hispanic daughter or<br/>
my Catholic son or my straight A&#39;s kids who are actually allowed to watch<br/>
TV and read dangerous books like 1984 and Huck Finn...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...there isn&#39;t a parent alive who could educate a kid fully and properly<br/>
in all subject areas. The reason there are so few home-schooled kids is<br/>
that most parents are smart enough not to even try...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Then you&#39;ve got entire teams of kids who get up around 10 a.m., go to the<br/>
gym for a couple hours, hang out for lunch, then go to school practice with<br/>
an enormous edge over the kids who have been busting their butts in the<br/>
classroom all day. What does that teach a kid? ...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is a disaster in selfish yuppie clothing, me-first thinking which<br/>
will tear at the fabric of our schools and, in turn, our society.&quot;&gt;&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677693125">I sent a letter off to the CEO for lack of a more appropriate address seeking to<br/>
educate him and Mr. Danehy.  Actually I had to laugh when I read the article<br/>
because it was such an example of the kettle calling the pot black. It is always<br/>
startling when the bigoted are outraged by bigotry.  In this case I would say<br/>
profound ignorance coupled with foot in mouth disease made for a deeply stupid<br/>
article.  Yes of course there are some families like Mr. Danehy describes just<br/>
like there are schools like Columbine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-736634910">I am mostly referring to the dangers of generalization.  To equate all<br/>
schools with Columbine (as in you will get shot if you go to school) is as<br/>
accurate as treating all homeschoolers as if they were ultra-conservative<br/>
racist, bigots because there are instances of that kind of homeschooling<br/>
families.   Probably a poor choice of analogies but do you get what I mean?<br/>
