<div id="ygrps-yiv-296528067">&lt;&lt;Ok, so I&#39;m about to go totally off subject, but Karen&#39;s  story reminded me <br/>
of <br/>
the other day when ds and I were at the store picking  out his bday cake.  Ds <br/>
has kinda long shocking white blond hair,  people walk up to him randomly all <br/>
the time to comment about his hair  (usually positive and usually to him, not <br/>
me..he just turned 5 so that&#39;s  kinda impressive).  Anyway, we&#39;re standing <br/>
amidst a group of ladies  and a random woman walks up to my ds and says &quot;boy, <br/>
looks like you need a  haircut.&quot;  He just looks at her so I respond <br/>
with&quot;noooo, I don&#39;t  think so.&quot;  One of the other ladies totally unrelated <br/>
says &quot;oh  no!  Don&#39;t you cut that gorgeous hair!&quot;  THEN, the original  <br/>
commenter turns to her and says, serious, and seriously rude, &quot;I don&#39;t  think <br/>
anybody asked you to be part of this conversation!&quot;  Talk about  oblivious.<br/>
<br/>
A&gt;&gt;<br/>
****************<br/>
My little guy is 17 months and people have made comments. His hair is also  <br/>
very blonde/white. <br/>
You know some people will always have something to say. My daughter as a  <br/>
baby had black hair at birth and then quickly began to turn blonde. I actually  <br/>
had people ask me if I bleached her hair and some didn&#39;t ask they just muttered <br/>
 under their breath.<br/>
Kids are beautiful and should all be spoken to nicely and loved. <br/>
