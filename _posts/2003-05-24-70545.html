John Wayne was never a cowboy. He was never in the military. <br/>
He was an actor who wore make-up and his real name was Marion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960230386">And he wrote to Kirk Douglas that he should NOT do (or was it &quot;should NOT HAVE done&quot;) Lust for Life (1956).  Wayne thought the movie was about a queer, a painter, that nasty Van Gough.  Not proper for a real man to portray.<br/>
<br/>
So, it comes down to symbols to me.  Men have/had John Wayne as a symbol or model for &quot;a life well lived.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Bringing it back to Unschooling, while trapped in a two storey brick encampment we call a P.School, image the symbols people (boys watching for their symbols, girls theirs) have presented to them.  Makes us well adjusted for prison and the military.  Do as your told - trust authority - move only when the bell rings.  Check your creativity and brain at the door.<br/>
