<div id="ygrps-yiv-128264267">Perhaps only 5-10% of the population in any society can truly be considered<br/>
academically gifted.  In other countries, that low percentage more or less<br/>
mirrors the percentage of people who attend college.<br/>
<br/>
In America, on the other hand, we send a much higher percentage of people to<br/>
college; more than any other major industrialized nation.  And we love to<br/>
act like those college-goers are the elite, the academically gifted.  Never<br/>
mind that an alarming number of our college graduates can&#39;t write a<br/>
persuasive essay, haven&#39;t read the classics, are geographically illiterate,<br/>
and lack a working knowledge of our system of government.<br/>
<br/>
We like to label our graduates as &quot;educated&quot; people, but perhaps deep down<br/>
inside during our private moments, we sense something&#39;s not quite right.<br/>
<br/>
The plain fact is that a substantial percentage of college students in this<br/>
country couldn&#39;t even qualify for college in a country like England or<br/>
Germany.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, the pretense is alive and well here.<br/>
<br/>
May I suggest this widespread self-congratulatory delusion creates a huge<br/>
class of pseudo-intellectuals in this country, and directly fuels bigotry,<br/>
closemindedness, and snobbery?<br/>

Well sure, but with unschoolers you&#39;re preaching to the choir directors.<br/>
<br/>
In light of John Gardner&#39;s work, &quot;academic giftedness&quot; is kind of an <br/>
embarrassing label anyway.  <br/>
