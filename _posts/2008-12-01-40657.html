<div id="ygrps-yiv-280882509">I am very new to &quot;unschooling&quot; and really need help with the following <br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
I have managed to let go of the food control and letmy kids make their <br/>
own choices during the day as to when, what and how much they eat but <br/>
the problem I am having is that when they end up eating all of some <br/>
food item that we all like to eat (eg. honey) so then for the rest of <br/>
the week my husband and I don&#39;t have any for ourselves until the next <br/>
grocery shopping day.<br/>
How can I apply the unschooling principals so that we all can have some <br/>
honey but not control the quantity that they eat?</div>

<br/>
To remove arbitrary rules doesn&#39;t mean to create a free-for-all.<br/>
<br/>
Make them food.  Make fun, interesting food that they can eat but  <br/>
that they don&#39;t have to eat.  Don&#39;t wait until they&#39;re hungry and  <br/>
then say &quot;What do you want?&quot;  Create meals, create snacks.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s something they&#39;re particularly interested in, buy more of it.<br/>
<br/>
There might be helpful ideas here:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The problem you have is that you can&#39;t yet treat food in a light and  <br/>
easy natural way. Even though you stopped having arbitrary  <br/>
restrictions, you still have &quot;issues&quot; about food. That&#39;s probably  <br/>
stopping you from thinking calmly and logically.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids eat up all of something before you get any, then, if  <br/>
financially possible, buy more of that thing.<br/>
<br/>
If you want something saved for later, say so. I put post-it notes on  <br/>
things at times.<br/>
<br/>
Before you take the last of something, make a point of asking if  <br/>
anybody else wants any. If you are considerate in that way, your kids  <br/>
will become so too.<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s how I avoid running out of high volume use foods, other than the <br/>
really fast perishables. I have one &quot;in the fridge&quot;  (or on the shelf) being <br/>
used and one unopened &quot;in the pantry&quot;. As soon as the in-use one is done, it <br/>
immediately goes on the shopping list on the side of the fridge. I can gauge <br/>
when I need to shop again by a couple of particular items, such as mayo, <br/>
bread, hot dogs and buns and skillet meals. Maybe one of your standards for <br/>
adjusting your timing would be the honey.<br/>

Robyn wrote that.  It reminded me of the differences in availability  <br/>
of shopping to different families.   There are families in northern  <br/>
New Mexico (probably lots of places) who live so far from town that  <br/>
when they come for groceries they bring a couple of coolers, and buy  <br/>
months&#39; worth.<br/>
<br/>
We live such short walking distance from a big grocery store that if  <br/>
we need eggs or milk, it can be gotten without disruption to the cooking<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s the in between.  But going to the store with me or their  <br/>
dad was one of the highlights of our kids&#39; lives--it was doing real  <br/>
work with adults who loved them, and we could have a leisurely stroll  <br/>
around the store and it was warm in the winter and cool in the  <br/>
summer, and we could talk and visit, and they learned about the names  <br/>
of things and how to weigh vegetables and where things come from  <br/>
different times of the year.   Incorporate the store into your  <br/>
unschooling life!<br/>

<br/>
We keep extras too, and refillable large containers of some things.   <br/>
The small bottle of vegetable oil is in the cabinet in the kitchen.   <br/>
The gallon to refill with is in the pantry.  We buy more spaghetti  <br/>
when we use the second to last one, not after the last one.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s can be harder for young couples without much money, but it can  <br/>
be something to remember.  When things are on sale that you know you  <br/>
would have bought anyway, buy two or three and stash them by, but  <br/>
don&#39;t wait until they&#39;re completely gone before putting it back on  <br/>
the list.<br/>
<br/>
Having something seem to be unlimited is what will help your kids get  <br/>
over their craving for it.  If they KNOW there&#39;s more ice cream (or  <br/>
anything), and there will always or usually be, they won&#39;t be in a  <br/>
hurry to eat &quot;their share&quot; (or all of it) out of fear of it being gone.<br/>
<br/>
There are seasons to things.  Lately here it&#39;s been bagels.  It&#39;s a  <br/>
staple and we buy more before they&#39;re gone.  For a while it was  <br/>
sandwich ham that was very popular.  Before that, individual  <br/>
microwaved pizzas.  Each interest was fulfilled and then it wasn&#39;t  <br/>
the most popular thing for a while again.  A year ago, corn dogs.  We  <br/>
always had corndogs.  Going with your children&#39;s direction instead of  <br/>
against it will help.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I didn&#39;t have to haul at least eight heavy bags up the stairs with my <br/>
sciatica and injured hip I would be able to enjoy grocery shopping more. As <br/>
it is we have more fun doing short shopping trips to more special food <br/>
stores for the few gourmet type items or making a family outing of Costco <br/>
(which has great take out food and lots of cool samples) than for regular <br/>
old groceries. When Jayn was younger, before the deliveries became <br/>
available, we would shop at all kinds of odd hours and Jayn enjoyed it. But <br/>
in those days James was usually available to carry the bags when I got home <br/>
and now he almost never is at the times when I can easily shop. Vons <br/>
delivery has been a godsend for me.<br/>
<br/>
My point was and is if you are regularly running out of something that <br/>
everyone likes a change in the way it is shopped for could be helpful.<br/>
