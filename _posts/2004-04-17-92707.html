<h4>Domus Ludus</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428246409">I have been sort of following this discussion.  I don&#39;t know what I can<br/>
exactly contribute except to put in my OWN experiences and views.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have already been on the range with real guns and real bullets. <br/>
This was when we lived in Texas and we&#39;re just now getting around to<br/>
preparing them to go back again - probably the first weekend of next<br/>
month because that will be the last time I can shoot before the baby<br/>
comes.  Now this is REAL guns and REAL bullets.  My kids, BTW are 5 and 7<br/>
(the last time they went to the range they were 5 and 3).<br/>
<br/>
They have &quot;toy&quot; guns which they practice with.  Not only &quot;pointing and<br/>
shooting&quot; but safety as well.  In this household there are two<br/>
ex-military men who intend (with my wholehearted approval) to teach the<br/>
children about guns, knives and martial arts.  This will (in OUR opinion)<br/>
teach them how to exercise self-discipline, self-control and safety.  Not<br/>
only how to safely handle a weapon, but how to be safe AROUND weapons. <br/>
This includes all of the above mentioned weapons -- guns, knives and<br/>
human beings.  And it is my experienced opinion that the most dangerous<br/>
weapon on this planet is the human being.  After all -- what creature<br/>
wields the inanimate gun or knife?<br/>
<br/>
Specifically the children will learn what guns and knives can do to not<br/>
only people but animals.  Especially guns.  They already know what a<br/>
knife - specifically a scalpel - does to human beings.  They caught me<br/>
viewing a page with graphics of a c-section in progress and were<br/>
fascinated.  They are both section babies and their sister will be born<br/>
the same way in 3 weeks.  And scalpels are neat and efficient.  Not all<br/>
knives are and NO gun is.  They also know a great deal about calibers and<br/>
the different degrees of damage they can cause.<br/>
<br/>
Some may say we are extremist in our own viewpoints, but the lives their<br/>
parents have led makes us believe that it is crucial to their survival in<br/>
this day and age.  Our philosophy has always been &quot;If you don&#39;t like the<br/>
way I live my life feel free not to live it that way.&quot;  This is simply<br/>
how WE unschool our children.  IMNSHO it is no better or worse to what<br/>
the collective YOU may choose to do so - it&#39;s simply different.<br/>
