Homeschooling: Teaching Thy Childre…&lt;/A&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not entirely thrilled about this article.<br/>
I&#39;ve been in worse, though.<br/>
<br/>
And for one thing, that&#39;s not the name of the article.  What&#39;s on the website <br/>
isn&#39;t what&#39;s in the paper (as to title).  <br/>
<br/>
Look soon if you&#39;re going to, because they only leave these things available <br/>
for a week and some before they&#39;re subscription only.<br/>
<br/>
For those more local, it&#39;s in Sage magazine (a monthy women&#39;s supplement to <br/>
the Journal).  There are no photos of us, because I told them it was a really <br/>
bad week for us.  They insisted a photographer was going to spend two whole <br/>
half-days just observing us homeschooling.  I said there would be nothing to see, <br/>
it was a really bad week, but told them the places where my kids would be <br/>
(Kirby at work, Marty&#39;s orc-ball game, Holly at the Harry Potter tournament, the <br/>
homeschooling get-together Holly goes to, all of those would have had <br/>
homeschoolers, but they only wanted a photo f ME unschooling THEM).   I&#39;m glad the <br/>
editor got frustrated enough to say they were going to use other photos.  She was <br/>
SURE that because they were professionals that just spending two half days at <br/>
our house they would see things I hadn&#39;t noticed before.  And she wanted <br/>
mornings.  After me reciting HOURS worth of photogenic stuff outside, she said <br/>
&quot;How are your mornings?&quot;  I said &quot;The kids are asleep and I&#39;m online.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wish she had run the article by some homeschoolers for polish on a couple <br/>
of things, and I wish she would not use indirect quotes which still put exact <br/>
words into people&#39;s mouths, and I wish she wouldn&#39;t create quotes out of parts. <br/>
 A couple of the things I&#39;m quoted as having said don&#39;t even sound like me, <br/>
although the gist of it was there.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, some of the quotes were pulled from websites so those weren&#39;t <br/>
screwed up.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s positive, though, and pretty uplifting.<br/>
<br/>
My stomach fell when I saw the quote about homeschoolers spending all their <br/>
time telling their kids what to do, so that a break each week was really <br/>
welcome.   Sad.<br/>

Thanks for sending the link. I enjoyed it. It wasn&#39;t the worst I&#39;ve read. I<br/>
liked your part very much. Should have done the whole article with you.<br/>
<br/>
The only parts I cringed at was the comment you mentioned about the mom<br/>
telling her kids what to do all day. My first thought was no wonder the<br/>
daughter wants to go to school! The other one was when I saw the pic of the<br/>
little boy printing out those letters all 10 times each. My kids would throw<br/>
the pencil at me if I ever requested that!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056272238">Sandra, that was a great article but your right the quote about homeschoolers <br/>
was sad all right. The only thing missing was photos of you or your <br/>
children!!!! It was uplifting though, thanks for posting it.<br/>
