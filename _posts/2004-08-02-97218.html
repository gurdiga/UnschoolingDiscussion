<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011503721">Hi!<br/>
 <br/>
I feel much better about my son&#39;s situation regarding the occupational therapy.  I am new to homeschooling and unschooling.  One of the things that appealed to me about unschooling was the fact that I can view my children as people not as robots.  My son is also the type that does things when he is good and ready to do them.  I just accept it as one of his traits.  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks again to everyone who gave me some advice. I would have responded sooner but our computer got a nasty virus.  I&#39;m just glad my husband is a computer programmer.  I don&#39;t have the patience for computers!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613312060">Hi, all! I&#39;ve been away almost a year, now, due to pregnancy complications <br/>
and the business of a new baby after 5 years... I just wanted to drop a line and <br/>
THANK everyone for the advice I received on preparing my then 5 year old for <br/>
a new sibling. I was all set to tell him all the points, good and bad that <br/>
might come up, but got quite a few comments here that said to let him figure most <br/>
of it out on his own, instead of giving him pre-conceived ideas or making him <br/>
aware of things that might never come to be.<br/>
<br/>
Our baby boy, Storm, was born October 28th, and after a couple months of <br/>
distance (both physical and emotional), our oldest, Wyl, finally started to warm <br/>
to the baby. I tell you, I don&#39;t think I have ever done anything harder than to <br/>
restrain myself when all I wanted to say were things like, &quot;Oh, just hold him <br/>
for a moment!&quot;, &quot;You can give him a bottle, just sit down and try.&quot;, &quot;Oh, <br/>
come play with him, smile at him and jiggle this toy....&quot; With each passing day <br/>
it got harder to keep my mouth shut, but I kept thinking of the advice I had <br/>
gotten here and bit my tongue... And your advice REALLY paid off! After 9 1/2 <br/>
months, he has FAR exceeded any expectations I could have ever dreamed up in the <br/>
brother department!! He loves his brother SO MUCH! Well, they both adore each <br/>
other! He is so helpful, loving, sweet-loves to play with him and make him <br/>
laugh, and I&#39;ve never seen a HINT of resentment or jelousy! Thank you all SO <br/>
MUCH for the advice-things would NOT be the same in our family without it.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Sang<br/>

at all.<br/>
