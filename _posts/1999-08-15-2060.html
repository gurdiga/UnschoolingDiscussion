<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868497075">Karen - you said:<br/>
&quot;They tried to get Gordon walking before he could crawl though he showed an<br/>
interest in crawling and collapsed in a heap about walking.  This, in the<br/>
name of &quot;catching up&quot;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You know, Karen, this is really the thing that concerns me most about public<br/>
school. (and lots of things concern me!)  It always felt, to me, like they<br/>
were spending so much time and energy &quot;preparing&quot; kids for what was coming<br/>
next that they weren&#39;t grounded in here and now!  I would guess it&#39;s<br/>
difficult when you have a special needs child and you want to believe the<br/>
&quot;experts&quot; know what they are doing, and you don&#39;t want to do something that<br/>
will &quot;harm&quot; your child, but your gut tells you that what they&#39;re doing just<br/>
doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>
Sounds like you&#39;ve got this pretty well figured out - so stop biting your<br/>
nails!<br/>
