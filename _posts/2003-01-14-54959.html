<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And REALLY---if you have a HUGE bowl there all the time (must be constantly<br/>
&gt; refilled and never empty) you&#39;ll be SO surprised at how little you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; EVENTUALLY eat. But just like the kids, don&#39;t expect it to happen all at<br/>
&gt; once!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has been my experience.  The more candy, cookies, etc. I keep around,<br/>
the less I want to eat them.  At one point we had an entire cupboard of<br/>
chocolate candy.  I wanted salmon and asparagus so bad, then!  Chocolate?<br/>
Blah!<br/>
