<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882634667">&quot; I so badly want to say, &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll watch your kids, no problem! <br/>
but, <br/>
my brain says NOOOOO!!!! What to do? And I feel bad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like the &quot;yes&quot; would come from a place of guilt, <br/>
rather than true enjoyment. That is not a good or proper reason to do <br/>
something imo.<br/>
I can understand why you&#39;d feel that way, the poor guy is trying to <br/>
raise two wee babes on his own, their mother abandoned them, of <br/>
course you feel bad.<br/>
But it&#39;s not your load to bear Nancy. If it in any way impedes you <br/>
from giving your own children the very best, I would say no.<br/>
That&#39;s not selfish, that&#39;s focusing on the important things in life.<br/>
Two little ones will change the flow of your day drastically.<br/>
These children already don&#39;t have the best situation, you are not <br/>
going to save them from the difficulty of losing their Mum.  But you <br/>
could frustrate yourself, and mess up the joyful flow of what you <br/>
have with your own children.<br/>
Just my .02 for what it&#39;s worth.<br/>
