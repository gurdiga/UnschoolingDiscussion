<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482780943">Generally speaking you have to drive all the way to Mt. Shasta to see real<br/>
snow.  This year there are places within 1/2 hour to 45 minutes where there<br/>
is a foot of snow.<br/>
<br/>
We generally have over 300 growing days and rarely have more than a dozen<br/>
frost days and none that stick.<br/>
<br/>
THIS year we have had over 30 frost days and about half a dozen that stuck!<br/>
<br/>
We choose to live here because it is right next to the ocean, we have REAL<br/>
trees &lt;g&gt; AND it doesn&#39;t get cold!  Now, whoever you are out there that is<br/>
sending us THEIR weather, well please take it back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078932907">Mary,<br/>
could you please send someone to pick up your weather?  It seems to <br/>
have drifted into Ohio.  THIS IS NOT WHAT OHIO MARCHES ARE SUPPOSED TO <br/>
BE LIKE!!!!!!!!  Rachel was out skiing yesterday on the back 8.  Oh <br/>
well, the dog likes the snow.  As for the rest of us, make it go <br/>
away!!!  We only like it in December and January.<br/>
<br/>
