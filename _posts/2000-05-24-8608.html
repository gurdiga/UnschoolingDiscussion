<div id="ygrps-yiv-497820049">Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
   I started my morning with some bad news.  I found out that the daughter of <br/>
a woman on another list I belong to just died after fighting a hard cancer <br/>
battle since the beginning of the year.  She was only eight years old.  This <br/>
hit me pretty hard because I am coming up on three years since the diagnosis <br/>
of my own breast cancer.  I sat in the computer room, staring out the window, <br/>
wondering why I am still here when this precious soul, who barely had a <br/>
chance to taste life, is gone.<br/>
<br/>
   As I sat by the window thinking, and admiring what promises to be a <br/>
beautiful spring day, I noticed kids gathering at the bus stop.  I started <br/>
thinking how different my morning would be if I had to get my son off to <br/>
school.  I went back upstairs to snuggle with Colton, who had migrated from <br/>
his bed to mine.  We were joined by our troublemaker Boo Cat, and my sweet <br/>
Anya, the happiest dog in the world.  My son and I played with the animals <br/>
and talked about everything and nothing for a solid half hour.<br/>
<br/>
   Colton was able to linger over a breakfast of strawberry toast and a <br/>
blackberry shake while I read to him from one of the books in the Redwall <br/>
series.  Our plans for the rest of the day will probably include pouring over <br/>
the new dinosaur books we picked up at the library yesterday, playing some <br/>
math games, a LOT more reading, and a long bike ride.  What luxury!  What a <br/>
gift!<br/>
<br/>
   Cancer taught me a valuable lesson.  I learned to live my life with <br/>
boundless enthusiasm, loving my family and friends with reckless abandon.  I <br/>
learned that so many things I used to think were important just don&#39;t matter. <br/>
 These are a few of the things that DO: Sitting with Colton for twenty <br/>
minutes while we watch a bird take a bath in the water that drips from our <br/>
picnic table.  Answering the phone to discover it&#39;s my husband, taking a <br/>
moment from his busy day to call and say he loves me.  Laughing with my <br/>
family until tears run down our cheeks and our sides ache.  Taking the time <br/>
to really listen when Colton wants to tell me more information about Pokemon. <br/>
 Taking my husband&#39;s hand when we walk together.  Telling my son I am so <br/>
happy to be his mom.  This is all holy ground.<br/>
<br/>
   Life is so fragile and fleeting, but at the same time it is achingly <br/>
beautiful.  I am grateful that I now see the world with new eyes, that I have <br/>
found the sacred in the mundane.  Yes, there are heartbreaks and difficult <br/>
valleys we must walk.  But all along the path, there are blessings that move <br/>
me to tears.  I plan to seek them out and revel in them.  Drink deeply of <br/>
life, my friends, and go give someone you love a hug.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
