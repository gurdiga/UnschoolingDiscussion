<div id="ygrps-yiv-901831382">Thank-you for the suggestions thus far.  I like the response to Dr.<br/>
Phil&#39;s suggestion to finish everything!  I had to laugh, because this<br/>
is part of my issue with this process - it does feel like we&#39;re<br/>
quitting and I feel guilty about it, even though honoring where the<br/>
kids are at feels important as well.  Boy, I can be complicated!<br/>
<br/>
My ds enjoys reading music that is designed so that your five fingers<br/>
don&#39;t move off their notes - but you play them when the music says so.<br/>
 Lots of simple tunes are written in books like this - so I think I<br/>
may search that out and put it back on the piano so he can fiddle<br/>
around with it more easily.<br/>
