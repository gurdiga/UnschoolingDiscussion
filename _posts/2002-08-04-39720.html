 </span></blockquote>Well - first, if there are people whose posting habitually bothers you, then <br/>
delete their posts before you read them - you can see who posts are from <br/>
before you read them. If you&#39;re using an email program such as Outlook or <br/>
Eudora, you can even have posts from certain people deleted automatically <br/>
before you even see them. On AOL, we can sort our email, delete all posts <br/>
from any particular email, and then read the rest.<br/>
<br/>
If you do read a post that bothers you - delete it rather than responding to <br/>
it. I&#39;ve noticed, over the years, that people who WANT to be verbally hostile <br/>
will just get more so when they are responded to  -- so the best thing you <br/>
can do is not to respond at all.<br/>
<br/>
Try to remember that what sounds rude to you may sound refreshingly direct <br/>
and clear to someone else. Focus on issues and ideas and not on what may or <br/>
may not be real or imagined personal insults. <br/>
<br/>
 I just did a quick search on yahoogroups - got over 300 unique hits on <br/>
unschooling and unschoolers. There are a lotta lists out there.<br/>
