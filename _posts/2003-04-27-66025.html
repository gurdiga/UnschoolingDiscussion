<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268121964">Hi Everyone,<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list and need to make a quick intro.  I am Kristin, <br/>
mom to Chloe (10) and Ryan (8), wife to Mark.  We currently live in <br/>
Hawaii, but are hoping to move to Massachusetts by this fall.  We <br/>
came here from California last summer.  I have unschooled there and <br/>
gone to the HSC conference in Sacramento many times.  It&#39;s a great <br/>
conference, but kids must stay with the parents at all times, so it <br/>
was a bit hard to take kids unless you had two adults.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, since we are considering a move to New England I have been <br/>
very interested in the discussion of a unschooler&#39;s conference <br/>
there.  I had always want to go the GWS conference, but didn&#39;t make <br/>
it.  I do have the old conference brochure and it took place at <br/>
Eisner Camp in the Berkshires.  Sounds like a fabulous place.  I was <br/>
wondering if it might be possible to get some conference tips from <br/>
the people at Holt Associates.  I&#39;m not sure how much of an <br/>
organization is left, but I hear that Pat Farenga is still making the <br/>
rounds so he may be able to help.  <br/>
<br/>
The other thing I just found online is the Unschoolers Network <br/>
Conference in New Jersey on June 28th.  Linda Dobson will be the <br/>
keynote speaker.  Here&#39;s the link:  <br/>

This looks like a great list, glad to be here.  Kristin</div>
