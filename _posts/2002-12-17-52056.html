<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652869591">Percy is BACK!  <br/>
<br/>
I mentioned her in my post about Ladybug a few days ago.  The two of them got <br/>
out and went missing back in September.  After 4 days, Ladybug managed to <br/>
flag down my husband on the road late one night.  We never heard or saw from <br/>
Percy again.  I presumed and felt strongly that she was dead.<br/>
<br/>
So today we&#39;re driving a direction on our road we don&#39;t normally go, and who <br/>
is standing in the road but Percy!  I stopped the car and called her name, <br/>
and she took off running.  She ran about 100 yards to her new driveway, up <br/>
the driveway and around back.  I hopped out of the car in the driveway, and <br/>
trotted to the back to find her standing on a deck chair, barking at me.  As <br/>
soon as she got a whiff of me she started wagging all over and jumping and <br/>
doing her happy dance!  :&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
By this time tears were streaming down my face, and I rang the doorbell.  A <br/>
man came out and he said they had been feeding her since she showed up, and <br/>
that she was a sweet dog and that his wife was going to be heartbroken.   :(  <br/>
We talked a little about who she was and where she&#39;d come from and about her <br/>
cataracts and her sneezing and diminished sense of smell (age or sinus <br/>
polyps, no one knows).  He knew from our conversation that I wasn&#39;t pulling <br/>
his leg.  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s healthy and slimmed down and happy to be home!  <br/>
<br/>
I bought the couple some chocolate today.  Other than a thank you note, is <br/>
there anything else I should do?  I&#39;m pretty sure they didn&#39;t spend any money <br/>
other than on dog food.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me share my happy news!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
How about taking Percy back (on a leash) for a visit every now and then? <br/>
Seems like maybe they would enjoy that.<br/>

would be very nice. So would occasional visits.<br/>

<br/>
So how did Ladybug and Percy react when they saw each other?<br/>

we put Percy on a leash and let her down and walked her around and Ladybug <br/>
finally saw her.  When the met nose to nose, Percy&#39;s tail was wagging to beat <br/>
the band, but LB was pretty standoffish.  She didn&#39;t want Percy to sniff her <br/>
at all, but sniffed every inch of Percy.  <br/>
<br/>
Now they&#39;re thick as theives again.  Percy didn&#39;t forget any of our commands <br/>
or hand signals, and seems really happy to be home.  <br/>

PS, I used to (maybe still am?) be on an email list with a woman who&#39;s kids <br/>
asked her to use made up names, one was Ladybug, so the whole time I&#39;ve been <br/>
reading this thread, I was thinking about them, forgetting who was who until <br/>
this line:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;She didn&#39;t want Percy to sniff her at all, but sniffed every inch of Percy.&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Aha! I said! Ladybug is not Ladybug the kid! She&#39;s a DOG!<br/>
DOH!<br/>
