<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803285806">** I can see where it would be confusing for a child. My MIL would put them <br/>
on<br/>
the grandson she&#39;s raising when it was convenient for HER, not necessarily <br/>
for<br/>
Todd. He&#39;d say he had to go and she&#39;d tell him to go ahead, he was wearing a<br/>
pull up. Sometimes he would even cry to be taken to the bathroom but she<br/>
would insist he just &quot;go&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s six, doesn&#39;t wear pull ups (ended up wearing depends because he&#39;s so<br/>
big) anymore but will sit in his little recliner chair watching cartoons and<br/>
then say, &quot;nanny, I messed my man shorts! come change me!&quot; And she does. <br/>
There<br/>
was a time when he didn&#39;t want to go on himself. That has passed, doesn&#39;t<br/>
bother him at all now.**<br/>
<br/>
The pullups didn&#39;t confuse the boy, his grandmother did.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s never a good idea to look at abberant behaviour and then make <br/>
generalizations from the observation. People who won&#39;t take a child to the bathroom when <br/>
he&#39;s crying to go probably don&#39;t represent the majority of pullup users.<br/>

<br/>
Probably not, but the people that I personally know that use pullups, do so <br/>
for the Parents/grandparents/adults convenience.  I&#39;m sure there are others who <br/>
use them for reasons that benefit the child.  I&#39;ve just never met them.<br/>
<br/>
I think they make it easier on the parents and perhaps more comfortable on <br/>
the child, by letting them feel less wet when they do go.<br/>
<br/>
How would one use pull ups to benefit the child specifically?  Just to help <br/>
them be more comfortable when they &quot;go&quot;?  Wouldn&#39;t the benefit be the same if <br/>
the mother/father/adult changed the child&#39;s clothing and cleaned and dried them?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be the first to admit I know nothing about these pull ups firsthand.  <br/>
Simply from watching/talking to those who DO use them.<br/>
<br/>
They seem like an expensive consumable to me.<br/>

Why use diapers at all then, even with young infants?  Why not just <br/>
let the baby pee everywhere and then just change their clothes <br/>
continually?  I&#39;m guessing because it saves lots of laundry along <br/>
with keeping the child more comfortable.   Even with cloth diapers <br/>
the urine/feces is contained rather than running down the child&#39;s <br/>
leg, over furniture, carpet and everywhere else.  (Well, most of the <br/>
time anyway...)<br/>

If you were in an accident that somehow left you incontinent and <br/>
incapable of cleaning up after yourself but still of normal <br/>
intelligence, would you prefer to have something discreet under your <br/>
clothes like Depends?   Or would you just prefer to pee anywhere and <br/>

  Weeeellll...I have seen websites on something called infant elimination training by where you train a 3 or 4 month old to go on command. It&#39;s adapted from methods used by moms where they simply don&#39;t use diapers. It may have solved for me, the mystery of why I&#39;d see happy moms in tribal societies carrying around bare bummed babies.<br/>

Yes, I realize that.  I actually have a book on my shelf called <br/>
Diaper Free, but didn&#39;t read it until my youngst was older.<br/>
Sounds interesting but like a lot of work- difficult to do when you <br/>
have older kids and alot of other activity going on besides watching <br/>
your infant for about-to-pee clues.<br/>
And the few people that I&#39;ve spoken to who used the diaper free <br/>
method from day one still fall back on diapers occasionally- long <br/>
car trips for example- or any other occasion where it isn&#39;t <br/>
convenient or possible to read cues and then quickly remove the <br/>
baby&#39;s clothes and aim the pee.   Either way the idea is to prevent <br/>
the baby&#39;s clothes from getting peed on- the diaper free method <br/>
doesn&#39;t recommend skipping the diapers because washing peed on <br/>
clothing is just as easy and comfortable, which is what Glena seemed <br/>
to be saying.<br/>

<br/>
Marty didn&#39;t like pull-ups because the sides have no absorbent material, and <br/>
when he went at night he really went.<br/>
<br/>
When he got bigger and really was NOT going to sleep all night without <br/>
peeing, we figured a small adult-sized diaper (with removeable/reuseable side tapes) <br/>
was cheaper than doing a load of laundry every single day (sheets, mattress <br/>
pad, clothes, at least) and the eventual cost of a new mattress.   35 cents for <br/>
a diaper, and he could sleep all night comfortably.   We couldn&#39;t do a load <br/>
of wash-and-dry for 35 cents, not to mention wear and tear on the bedding, and <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
It was healthier for Marty NOT to sleep in a puddle of his own urine.<br/>
It was healthier for Marty to sleep eight hours instead of having us get up <br/>
and take him to the bathroom (which disturbed TWO people&#39;s sleep, and didn&#39;t <br/>
prevent the problem.<br/>
<br/>
It was healthier for Marty to go ahead and drink and eat before bedtime than <br/>
for us to deprive him of liquid in hopes he&#39;d sleep dry (and it didn&#39;t help <br/>
anyway).<br/>
<br/>
So for Marty&#39;s  health and benefit, we figured sleep, lack of urine-bed, and <br/>
lack of shame and pressure and criticism were HUGELY more important than our <br/>
being able to tell some older woman somewhere sometime that Marty was not <br/>
wetting the bed anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
And it turns out nothing we did or could have done would have caused him to <br/>
wake up and go to the bathroom, or for his various organs to be the size and <br/>
maturity it takes to hold urine for hours and hours.<br/>
<br/>
The convenience to me was not doing laundry and not getting up to futilely <br/>
try to guess at which moment he would need to pee.<br/>

Do I LIKE the person who&#39;s going to have to clean up after me?<br/>
As an act of hostility, perhaps.<br/>

remember what they were sold for--spit up pads, maybe? They had small ones <br/>
and full crib sized ones, which we used to let her have some air time after <br/>
tub.<br/>
<br/>
They have been wonderful to have as the kids are learning to go through the <br/>
night! They catch everything as long as the child is on them at the time, <br/>
and they are far easier to pull up and wash than an entire set of <br/>
bedding!  I like this method because the child wakes up when they wet, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My middle daughter didn&#39;t wake up if she was wet in pull-ups or <br/>
diapers--only when she drenched herself because nothing was absorbing it. <br/>
She did this, would go back to pull-ups, decide to try again, go back <br/>
again. This was always on her request, her lead. In retrospect, it seemed <br/>
like she needed to get her body used to waking her up, which she only did <br/>
after drenching herself a couple of times without the pull-ups. So, yeah, <br/>
it was the process her body went through to learn to wake up BEFORE instead <br/>
of after, and washing a pad was a whole lot easier than washing all the <br/>
bedding and a whole lot kinder than not letting her try or getting mad if <br/>
she didn&#39;t get to the potty.<br/>
<br/>
Just an option that I found particularly useful. Not the only one; not <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297151204">The bed pads that I used were similar to the disposable &quot;Underpads&quot; (like in<br/>
hospitals) available at pharmacies in the incontinence section. The washable<br/>
ones have a nicer cottony surface and were less sweat inducing than the<br/>
plastic ones. They were pretty large and the idea was to protect our super<br/>
expensive bed, rather than as a laundry reducer. I still put it under our<br/>
fitted sheet, unless Jayn was napping on sofa or on top of the bed - then I<br/>
would put one under her just in case. I think a boy (or a girl for that<br/>
matter) would have to pour out a gallon to soak over the whole pad, but he<br/>
would pretty much soak his pj&#39;s, and his top sheet at any rate. I would<br/>
recommend them highly for anyone concerned with preserving their mattress,<br/>
especially if you have (or wished you could have) a pillow top or feather<br/>
bed.  Dh is very sensitive to smells and would complain about a pee smell,<br/>
when I could smell absolutely nothing. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We are currently potty training.  My son runs around naked at home <br/>
all day.  When he goes to bed he wears a pull-up which is the same <br/>
as a diaper for him.  Why should his rest be disturbed and sheets <br/>
changes, etc?  He is not ready to go all night without having an <br/>
accident.  Also, when we go out he wears one.  He is not ready to be <br/>
out and about bare.  When we go to the park, I would rather he go as <br/>
he need than stop his play, dry him, change his clothes, who knows <br/>
how many times which would just frustrates him and takes away from <br/>
his play time.  Even fully potty trained children tend to have <br/>
accidents at play time, for my 2yo it would be a disaster! <br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Wouldn&#39;t the benefit be the same if <br/>

 Your comment seems to indicate that parents who use pull-ups just <br/>
aren&#39;t as commited to their children and are lazier.  Once he <br/>
is &quot;fully&quot; trained than there will be no diapers.  But diapers/pull-<br/>
ups are still helpful during the triaing time.  Personally, I think <br/>
it makes me more flexible.  We do what works on the day it works.  <br/>
If he decided he wanted to wear underwear to the park, we would.  <br/>
That in my eyes is what being an unschooling parent is also about.  <br/>
Not doing things just the way you think they should be done, but <br/>
also following what things have been working and are working for <br/>
your family or specific child.  <br/>

First off I&#39;d like to say that I didn&#39;t &quot;potty train&quot; my kids but had a potty and a stool to get on the toilette if/when they wanted.  Mostly they ran around naked or partially clothed and we did ask them if they need to go when we went they learned naturally.  Stopped using diapers at night when they said they were ready.  Mostly used cloth diapers, disposies sometimes when we we&#39;re going out, I was feeling lazy or was booked solid for a few days(maybe the same thing?).<br/>
<br/>
What I would like to say in response to the quote above...<br/>
When we are out or have a lot of company over My kids benefited from wearing pull-ups.  First from not having to go through cleaning up and changing when &#39;they&#39; had much more exciting things to do.  Secondly they have experienced no bad reactions from less sensitive people as they cleaned up after an accident.  (I&#39;m sure my Aunt would pass out if my almost three yearold had peed on her 200 yearold sofa, tee hee, luckily she had a pullup on) <br/>
<br/>
Now those might sound like they make life easier on the grownups and yup they do.  It&#39;s much easier to have a Wee&#39;un come to me and say &quot;Need new Inup&quot; during x-mas dinner at Aunties.  Then have to clean up and change them.  But it benefits the Kids too cause they don&#39;t have to stand there cold and wet getting cleaned up.  I also don&#39;t like having to keep many changes of clothes in a sack to truck around every where.  Also I live in Canada and It&#39;s bloody cold in my area today -20C(I&#39;m so glad I don&#39;t have to walk kids to school at 8 in the dark and be dressed and brushed with four kids bundled up. ug)  Although I don&#39;t like disposables due to environmental concerns, and the smell of linen fresh off the line in summer, I do use pull-ups.  Also My 6yo isn&#39;t reliably dry at night and so she has access to them as well.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I&#39;ve blathered on long enough.<br/>
