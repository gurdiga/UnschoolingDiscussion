&lt;&lt; Thanks, Ren!  I&#39;ve heard of him but haven&#39;t read any of his work.  Is <br/>
there <br/>
 any particular book you think I should read first? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve read &quot;Going Home, Jesus and Buddha as brothers&quot; and really enjoyed <br/>
it.<br/>
He&#39;s written several others, I saw some at the Unity bookstore and would like <br/>
to pick them up. So I&#39;m not the best advice giver on which to read first.<br/>
I just think his writing is very easily digestible and helps you understand <br/>
some of the principles of Buddhism quickly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485285432">I&#39;m not buddist, but read a lot of different things and stumbled recently <br/>
onto Thich Nhat Hanh&#39;s writing.  It&#39;s pretty unschool-y in many ways, <br/>
somehow and I really enjoy it.  I read one on Anger (which was fascinating) <br/>
and I&#39;m dabbling in his &#39;Peace is Every Step&#39; right now, which seemed <br/>
timely with our current war-mongering administration... although I started <br/>
it several months *before* bush decided he didn&#39;t like <br/>
Iraq.   (grin)   (I&#39;ve usually got 10 or 12 books going at once and this <br/>
one&#39;s been a read-and-think-for-a-while kind of a book.)<br/>
<br/>
 From the back jacket, &quot;...[he] shows us how to make positive use of the <br/>
very situations that usually pressure and antagonize us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I were you, I&#39;d head off to the library or bookstore, stand in front of <br/>
his books and see what calls to you.  That&#39;s probably what you should read <br/>
first.<br/>

Read in the bathroom.:) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good idea.  <br/>
The one I recommended is just little stories.  Best NOT to read more than one <br/>
at a time.  Read one, and then do whatever you&#39;re going to do.  <br/>
<br/>
If you have a boring drive with lots of redlights, you could take one in the <br/>
car and just read a paragraph at a light.  <br/>
<br/>
Read while you eat (if you ever get to eat alone), maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Those aren&#39;t focus-like-a-monk suggestions.  Those are <br/>
living-a-hyperactive-life suggestions.  If your outsides still have to be a <br/>
busy modern mom, once in a while your insides can have a Buddhist-peace <br/>
fantasy moment, and enough of those moments start to turn into real peace <br/>
that can help your busy modern mom life.<br/>

But reading in the bathroom won&#39;t work.  I haven&#39;t been in the bathroom alone <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m such a book hoarder it&#39;s sad, sad, sad.<br/>
<br/>
But I made a violin payment with a book I had bought years ago.  I bought a <br/>
duplicate and wrapped it in brown paper and filed it, figuring someday the <br/>
glue would be worn out on mine and it would never be available again.  A <br/>
Bronson book on tunes of English ballads.  Musicology.  $12 on sale.  <br/>
<br/>
Years passed and the neighbor who was selling us a violin on payments asked <br/>
if I had any idea where she could get a copy of the Bronson book on tunes of <br/>
English ballads, since it was so severely out of print.    <br/>
<br/>
Reluctantly, I gave her this pristine copy.  She was happy and we owned the <br/>
rest of the violin, $40 worth of remaining payments.  <br/>
<br/>
Seems like a happy ending and a good use for the book, but of course now I <br/>
don&#39;t have TWO copies of my own.  <br/>
<br/>
Sick, I know. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

books that they actually sell new.  They&#39;re doing a thing now of offering<br/>
the used books to anyone who is going to buy the new one.  I don&#39;t have a<br/>
problem with people buying and selling used books, but when those sales<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425172408">There is a book by Thich Nhat Hanh called &quot;Essential Writings&quot;, a good <br/>
introduction to his writing with short bits to read and digest.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what he says about dishwashing:<br/>
&quot;To my mind, the idea that doing dishes is unpleasant can occur only when <br/>
you aren&#39;t doing them. Once you are standing in front of the sink with your <br/>
sleeves rolled up and your hands in warm water, it really isn&#39;t so bad.&quot;<br/>

There&#39;ve been a lot of complaints about it on the childrens writing list.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have no problem with people buying used books or getting them from the<br/>
library.  I do it all the time.  I just think it stinks for Amazon, which<br/>
used to only sell new books,  to *encourage* buying used books over new<br/>
ones.  If people are going to sell used books online, I just personally<br/>
prefer that they do it somewhere that isn&#39;t also selling new books.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I listed about 20 books to sell last fall.  They were up for three months and <br/>
nothing sold.  So, I think most folks are buying new instead of used at <br/>
Amazon.  Or it could have been my collection no one was interested in!  eBay <br/>
is a more efficient way of weeding your collection.  Or donating them to the <br/>
library.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe now that people realize that they can buy used books at Amazon.  But<br/>
when they first started this it was people who had gone there to buy the new<br/>
book who were getting a pleasant surprise.  They would have been fully<br/>
prepared to buy the book new, but bought used because it was offered.  So<br/>
maybe it&#39;s not an issue now, but if I were selling used books, I&#39;d do it<br/>
somewhere that was dedicated to used.<br/>
