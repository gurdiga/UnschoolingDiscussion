<br/>
 </span></blockquote>       I used to worry about this, until I gradually realized that we do eat <br/>
together (or at least in close proximity) all the time, and it&#39;s great, though <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t call it formal. Or &quot;mealtime&quot; exactly. :)<br/>
<br/>
       I think the set family dinner may have sprung from the same schoolish <br/>
context context as tv limits. <br/>
<br/>
       In a schooling family, especially one with traditionally employed <br/>
parents, what other regular family time is even possible, much less likely? It <br/>
takes a major commitment by each family member, maybe sacrifice of other <br/>
enjoyable plans and choices, to manage formal dinnertime together regularly. <br/>
<br/>
       Imo this is similar to the schoolish idea of screen time as an <br/>
unacceptable interference with homework, or with the tiny remaining slivers of <br/>
afternoon into which schooled children must shoehorn all outdoor activity and <br/>
pursuit of individual interests.<br/>
<br/>
       But in our unschooling, we&#39;ve found such unnecessary contrivance <br/>
isn&#39;t, well, necessary! <br/>
<br/>
       All the worthwhile goals of formal mealtime -- togetherness, parental <br/>
modeling, companionable conversations and of course sufficient ingesting of <br/>
varied and nutritious foodstuffs &lt;g&gt; -- can be achieved by unschoolers *without* <br/>
the actual mealtime, just as we can achieve the goals of healthy outdoor <br/>
activity and plenty of time for pursuits of interest without limiting tv. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       I remain astonished (after a decade or more, depending on how I count <br/>
it) at what falls naturally into place, if a family can just break the <br/>
gravitational pull of &quot;school&quot; and chart its own path through time and space.    JJ<br/>
