<br/>
Math cannot be learned all at one time.<br/>
Math isn&#39;t learned in layers.<br/>
<br/>
Math is like a language, an intelligence, a way of seeing the patterns in the <br/>
world, not just of numbers, but of shapes, and sounds and the repeating <br/>
rhythms in birdsongs or woodpeckers.  <br/>
<br/>
School-style mathematics is a system of notation for all that, and some <br/>
tricks for doing calculations on paper.  Rarely do they help people figure <br/>
out how to decide what numbers need to be calculated in what way to determine <br/>
something, they just teach pre-set-up calculating.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think math comes in waves.  I think it comes in little bursts of <br/>
understanding, little tiny particles of questions and discovery and of <br/>
filling in one more little piece in a puzzle without edges, without the <br/>
flatness of being on one plane, and one-sided like regular jigsaw puzzles, <br/>
but some pieces in the past, and some in the future; some theoretical or <br/>
imagined and some you could weigh or measure at home; some funny and some <br/>
beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Each little dot of information can sit for a second or a year before a new <br/>
dot connects to it.  Some new dots of information might connect to two or <br/>
twenty existing pieces of The Big Puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s either a dog, or it&#39;s a hippopotamus.&quot;<br/>
Not good math. <br/>
Not good logic.<br/>
<br/>
The vast majority of things in the universe do not resemble a dog OR a hippo <br/>
in the least little way.<br/>
