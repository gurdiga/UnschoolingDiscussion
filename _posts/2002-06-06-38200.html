<div id="ygrps-yiv-903895878">Hi, I have 2 questions about the post below:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My daughter suffered an infection in her foot from a cut and I was advised<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to give her a tetanus shot. However, a naturopath and the doctor that I took<br/>
her too (I like to get two opinions from each field) more or less said the<br/>
same thing that tetanus was prevelant in the days that horses were used -<br/>
precar days - and since we don&#39;t use or are around horses then tetanus isn&#39;t<br/>
the problem anymore.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
First, do you remember what it was about horses?  This kind of surprised me. I thought it was grime and dirt in general.  I don&#39;t immunize my children but I DO live in an area with horses freely roaming the streets. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What I did instead was made up a paste with slippery elm powder, MSM <br/>
 </span></blockquote>powder (drawing agent to draw out the infection) add a couple of drops(10) of <br/>
tea tree oil (natural antiseptic) and a tea spoon of manuka honey (natural<br/>
healing agent in the manuka from New Zealand).&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Second, what is MSM.  I think I read that same thing in a post about fibromyalgia.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry I haven&#39;t been able to reply sooner, things have been full on <br/>
here at home with a teething daughter and sleepless nights. I <br/>
actually wrote to the AVN to find out more about the connection <br/>
between horses and tetnus and this is some of the replies received <br/>
but not to be taken as medical advice<br/>
<br/>
This is correct but the &quot;connection&quot; between horses and tetanus lies <br/>
in the <br/>
presence of clostridium tetani in the FECES of horses as well as <br/>
cows, etc. <br/>
Tetanus is in the soil....everywhere! And <br/>
it is in the soil because of horse/cow/etc, feces. The notion that <br/>
one is <br/>
more in danger due to contact with &quot;horses&quot; is a myth. It is the <br/>
soil which <br/>
contains the organism and the mechanism by which the soil &quot;enters&quot; <br/>
the body <br/>
is often through and by a sharp object....e.g. nail, rusty or not, <br/>
but even <br/>
a relatively deep &quot;scratch&quot; by a car fender can infect.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tetanus is an infection of the nervous system caused<br/>
by the germ Clostridium tetani. This organism forms<br/>
tough spores that are resistant to environmental<br/>
influences, and germinates in deep wounds with little<br/>
or no oxygen supply.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mary I hope your boy is doing well and that every thing has worked <br/>
out OK<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll look into this one later, I know that someone else had replied <br/>
so if I come up with something different I&#39;ll add more. I had <br/>
planned to catch up on emails tonight but so far it has taken me <br/>
45minutes to do this one as my daughter keeps waking up - restless <br/>
with teething once again so I think I might just go and stay with <br/>
her now. It amazes me how mothers can function day in and day out <br/>
with little sleep - probably explains why I found the cracker <br/>
biscuits in the fridge - maybe I am going crackers from lack of <br/>
sleep &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>

Thank you very much for your letter.  My son is doing great.  We did not get <br/>
the teta nus shot.  He is due to get his stiches out on Friday.  The doctor&#39;s <br/>
office is still trying to get me to let him have it.    I am more worried <br/>
about reactions to the shot then him getting tetanus right now.  He is taking <br/>
daily garlic pills and echinacea to build up his immune system and fight <br/>
bacteria.  He was sick when he was injured and it was not a good time to get <br/>
a shot with his immune system down.  I continue to pray that the decision was <br/>
right and truly appreciate everyone helping so much so quickly.  It was a <br/>
very difficult night for me last week and I spent over 8 hours researching it <br/>
through the night and talking with people on the phone the next day.  Thanks <br/>
again,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-896849734">When I was in premed (dropped out of med school to get<br/>
married--yes i am stupid)  we learned that tetnus is<br/>
an anaerobic bacteria  which means if the area gets<br/>
air or bleeds alot at first  tetnus is highly<br/>
unlikely.  The worst thing you could do is put<br/>
neosporin on a bad cut or any wound which was<br/>
punctured like by a nail or needle  because the<br/>
neosporin seals out air and would allow tetnus to<br/>
grow. You also shouldn&#39;t try to stop the bleeding<br/>
immediately  let it bleed while washing it with cold<br/>
running water.  I have never had a tetnus shot (cousin<br/>
had bad reaction to dpt and died from it so i was<br/>
medically exempt) and I have stepped on many pieces of<br/>
rusty metal  and had many animal scratches, spider<br/>
bites etc  and the couple of times I had to go to the<br/>
hospital they almost insisted I get a tetnus shot and<br/>
yet I have never had tetnus.   Actually I know many<br/>
many people who havent had tetnus shots since<br/>
childhood and none of them have ever gotten tetnus  so<br/>
I don&#39;t think it is that easily gotten.   All the<br/>
different doctors i have been to say that it is<br/>
mandatory for children who go to daycare or school to<br/>
have their shots up to date so my oldest has his shots<br/>
because he started with ps   but my youngest doesn&#39;t<br/>
even have a birth certificate yet  lol    Anyway  I am<br/>
certain you made the right decision  especially if his<br/>
immune system was down at the time.<br/>
