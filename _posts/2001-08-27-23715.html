 i&#39;d take a recipe swap! my son has milk and egg allergies and i think we&#39;re <br/>
 bordering on becoming vegan, but we&#39;ve been coming up with some great stuff. <br/>
 i just made some strawberry tofu popsicles the other day that were delicious!<br/>

    OOOOO pass along please?<br/>
<br/>
     Also since we are on the subject of food and such I have a question. If <br/>
a nursing mother drinks wine how much is passed to the child through breast <br/>
milk? Anyone know a percentage? We have a friend whose wife,I think and so <br/>
does dh,drinks an awful lot of wine. Her dd is 11 mos. and snacks at the <br/>
breast. I believe it is due to the taste?or quality of the milk. Plus the <br/>
fact that she is older and wanting solid foods which she does too but the <br/>
wine content I would think is rather high considering how much she drinks. <br/>
She drinks white wine only.<br/>

Nicki, I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &#39;snacks&#39; at the breast...  is <br/>
this a problem?  But on the question of alcohol, it&#39;s a really <br/>
individual thing, some people don&#39;t pass it through and some <br/>
people do, to greater or lesser extents.  Without actually taking <br/>

there could be &#39;half-life&#39; tables for it on the LLL site somewhere <br/>
though, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lalecheleague.org">http://www.lalecheleague.org</a>  which should say how long <br/>

I&#39;m sure there are more knowledgeable people on the <br/>
list than me ;-) but afair, a little wine (or whatever) <br/>
will help relax a mother who&#39;s stressing about nursing, <br/>
in the early days, and potentially open the milk-ducts <br/>
and nipple sphincters due to muscle-relaxant properties <br/>
(?)  sorry if this is TMI for some folk...  but a lot <br/>
will depress the whole milk-production process.  <br/>
(Though obviously different folk will have differing <br/>
ideas of what is &#39;a lot&#39; and what isn&#39;t...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716161821">It&#39;s the yeast in alcoholic drinks which can help with milk production, not <br/>
the alcohol.<br/>
<br/>
A small amount of alcohol does get through to breastmilk - the exact amount <br/>
varies depending on the individual, the baby&#39;s nursing pattern, the length <br/>
of time between drinking the alcohol & nursing & other factors - but a <br/>
glass or two of wine is not likely to cause a problem. More than this, <br/>
though, or drinking regularly, may. Remember that alcohol is a depressant - <br/>
not really something you&#39;d want your baby to have :-)<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;snacking&quot; is certainly not a problem. Remember that breastmilk is more <br/>
than just food - it&#39;s also comfort - & *fluid* - very important! If the <br/>
baby is having frequent, short nursing sessions, she&#39;s getting lots of <br/>
foremilk to assuage her thirst. I know that I spend most of the day taking <br/>
small drinks from a bottle of water - this is the baby&#39;s equivalent.<br/>
