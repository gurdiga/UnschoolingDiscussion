<div id="ygrps-yiv-776782250">&lt;&lt; It could also set the stage for a talk, if she asks, and or if you <br/>
<br/>
choose to bring up the subject by asking her if she has any <br/>
<br/>
questions about what she is seeing, surrounding the subject of sex.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When sexuality isn&#39;t hidden or shushed up, you never have to set a stage for <br/>
a talk.  It&#39;s just something they&#39;ve always known existed, vaguely, like maybe <br/>
mountains (if you you&#39;re in flatland) or the ocean (if you live in <br/>
Albuquerque or Minneapolis).  At first it&#39;s inconceivable, but you hear it&#39;s there, and <br/>
later you might want to ask questions or look at pictures, and someday there <br/>
you are, right in it.   <br/>
<br/>
Gradual awareness is much more in keeping with natural learning than setting <br/>
a stage and having a talk.  <br/>
<br/>
I know &quot;setting the stage&quot; is an idiomatic expression, but it&#39;s entirely too <br/>
dramatic for a discussion with one&#39;s own children who are home all the time.  <br/>
The world is a stage, and you and your children are probably talking off and <br/>
on all day.  You don&#39;t need scene changes and props very often.  What would set <br/>
the stage for a talk about Japan?  What would set the stage for suggesting <br/>
that they  might want to eat more protein?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just life.<br/>
<br/>
Or it CAN be just life if you immerse yourselves in life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sometimes we have to be <br/>
<br/>
willing to drop our fears and uncomfortablities, in order to provide <br/>
<br/>
our children with the knowledge they seek.-=-<br/>
<br/>
ALL the time.<br/>
Or you can just find another adult they can talk to.<br/>
<br/>
If the &quot;drop your fears&quot; part seems best, it&#39;s good to start BEFORE the day <br/>
of &quot;the talk.&quot;    I think it&#39;s just part of deschooling (which all unschooling <br/>
parents need to do with/on themselves to overcome their own school wounds and <br/>
prejudices) to try to see the world more clearly, without so many better/worse <br/>
labels on every little thing.<br/>
<br/>
I know some parents are uncomfortable with some topics, but the best way not <br/>
to pass that on to their children is to deal with their discomfort inside <br/>
themselves (and maybe outside, with a counsellor or by talking to other moms for <br/>
ideas, and sometimes lists like this  can help with that).<br/>
