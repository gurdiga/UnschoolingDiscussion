<div><font face="Arial" size="2">No cable here either....aren&#39;t going to spend hard 
earned money on a bunch of junk either......watch Pbs, mostly, when watching at 
all on our 12 inch old, black &amp; white......Dh.parents.thought they&#39;d do us a 
favor, and send us one of those huge like 27 inch color...Huge t.v.&#39;s.....his 
brother was so happy when we gave him a free new T.V....I just didn&#39;t want it 
taking up the whole living room, and being the center of attention.....I&#39;m 
surprised at the junk that&#39;s on the antanae stations at family time, without 
cable as it is...like we need a better selection of that, and pay more money for 
it........rent movies occasionally, but that&#39;s a whole family activity.&nbsp; 
Computer takes up alot of time though....son is inclined to computer, and just a 
got the new Pajama Sam game.........and in two days has solved all it&#39;s various 
ways of saving the Peace delegates......I like for him to take No computer 
days..though, when I see he is spending &quot;most &quot; of his time there...we tell him&quot; 
you better get off before you become a box-head&quot;&nbsp; I see the corners 
appearing now.....soon we&#39;ll be able to turn you on and off with a remote, or go 
surfing with his mouse hands......he gets a kick.......feels his forhead to make 
sure he&#39;s not turning into a computer, or 
television....hehe.......Michelle</font></div></html></div>
