<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;To all the rocks in your life:&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;A philosophy professor stood before his class and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>had<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;some items in front of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;him.  When class began, wordlessly, he picked up a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;large empty mayonnaise jar<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;and proceeded to fill it with rocks, rocks about 2&quot; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;diameter.  He then&gt; &gt; &gt;asked the students if the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>jar was full.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;They agreed that it was.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;So, the professor picked up a box of pebbles and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;poured them into the jar.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;He shook the jar lightly.  The pebbles, of course,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;rolled into the open areas<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;between the rocks. He then asked the students again <br/>
 </span></blockquote>if<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;the jar was full.&gt; &gt; &gt;They laughed and agreed that <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it was.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;The professor then picked up a box of sand and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>poured<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;it into the jar.   Of&gt; &gt; &gt;course, the sand filled <br/>
 </span></blockquote>up everything else.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Now,&quot; said the professor, &quot;I want you to recognize<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;that this is your life.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;The rocks are the important things:  your family, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>your<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;partner, your health,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;your children - anything that is so important to you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;that if it were lost,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;you would be nearly destroyed.  The pebbles are the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;other things that matter,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;like your job, your house, your car.  The sand is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;everything else.  The small stuff.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;room for the pebbles or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the rocks.  The same goes for your life.  If you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>spend<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;all your energy and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;time on the small stuff, you will never have room <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;the things that are&gt; &gt; &gt;important to you.  Pay <br/>
 </span></blockquote>attention to the things that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;are critical to your&gt; &gt; &gt;happiness.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Play with your children.  Take time to get medical&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;checkups.  Take your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;partner out dancing.  Make love often.  There will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;always be time to go to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;work, clean the house, attend a meeting, and fix the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;disposal.  Take care of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the rocks first -- the things that really matter.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Set<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;your priorities.  The&gt; &gt; &gt;rest is just sand.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;*****Love isn&#39;t what makes the world go <br/>
 </span></blockquote>&#39;round...*****<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;             It&#39;s what makes the ride worth while ! </span></blockquote></div>
