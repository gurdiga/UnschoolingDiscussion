<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s humbling to be on the receiving end of such caring attention.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And wonderful.  I am truly glad to know that people do make their own family<br/>
and do take care of each other.<br/>
<br/>
At the point that I posted my comments about family taking care of their own<br/>
not working, the topic was revolving around people stepping in when they see<br/>
abuse or problematic siutations.  The person to whom I replied thought that<br/>
family should do that, not anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
The army talks a good &quot;we&#39;re family&quot; line, but in reality, it rarely looks<br/>
anything like what you&#39;ve described.  Maybe having that kind of<br/>
supportiveness is related to living somewhere long enough to become part of<br/>
it.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just military people who go through that, either.<br/>
<br/>
How&#39;s the leg?  I hope both our broken leg-ed people are getting better!<br/>
