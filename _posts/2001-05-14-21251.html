&gt;Sometimes, unbeknownst to the good doc there is a<br/>
&gt;control issue or some sort going on. <br/>
&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, we had discussed this as the doctor had mentioned this to the mom.<br/>
Her best conclusion on this was his father and her were divorced but<br/>
still friends - dad was close and remained close to son ...<br/>
then dad became very ill with hepatitis .. was sentenced to death<br/>
this child had walked that scary road with dad as the mom let the<br/>
ex stay with her so she could care for him thru this ...<br/>
ended up thru some new experimental drug he is not cured but in<br/>
remission which was unbelievable as bad as he was but she feels<br/>
between the divorce and then his dads severe illness this may have<br/>
triggered it in the lil guy ...<br/>
<br/>
They also looked into the spinal issues etc and she took him for<br/>
alignment checks etc ... that seemed to check out okay ...<br/>
<br/>
Who knows exactly why etc ...  ?<br/>
