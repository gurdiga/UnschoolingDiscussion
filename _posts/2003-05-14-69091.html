<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;The Head Start program was created in 1965 to deliver comprehensive<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay.  Thanks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By the time I was seeing it in person in the  70&#39;s, I didn&#39;t see anything <br/>
&gt; but <br/>
&gt; kids going to head start classes, and parents ignoring them a year earlier <br/>
&gt; than they would have done otherwise.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, Julian&#39;s dad&#39;s first job after college was at a Head Start. One of <br/>
the main things about it was there was a LOT of parent involvement. Parents <br/>
were very involved in hiring committees for teachers, a lot of policy, etc. <br/>
This apparently was very typical of Head Start programs. This was in 1983-85.<br/>

&lt;&lt;SIGH.......I don&#39;t know if I mentioned it or not, but at the last visit <br/>
with the social worker, guess what the topic of focus was? Sarah not being in <br/>
school....and how I must certainly need a break from the kids...the phrase most <br/>
said was &quot;how do you do it?&quot; and comments like &quot;I&#39;d need a break from my kids <br/>
and I only have two!&quot; yadda yadda yadda I&#39;m sure you could fill in the rest of <br/>
the conversation...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My sister-in-law, who is expecting her first child, says that she could never <br/>
homeschool, because she couldn&#39;t stand staying home with her kids all day.  <br/>
She is an elementary teacher in an inner city school, lol!  I don&#39;t know how <br/>
she can stand spending all day with 30 kids who aren&#39;t hers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-725672332">I was walking into the house from our main street one day with my 2 year old<br/>
and was greeted by a woman walking down the street.  It&#39;s that kind of &quot;Say<br/>
Hi&quot; neighborhood.  She said she ran the local head start and figured she&#39;d<br/>
be seeing him there soon.<br/>
<br/>
Uhm, no sorry.  I very politely said, &quot;Well, considering we home school the<br/>
older one, probably not.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-sigh-  I know the neighborhood is depressed, but still.  Head Start was<br/>
meant for families with serious histories of, well, not knowing how to<br/>
parent and be families.  Not as a regular preschool.<br/>
<br/>
And certainly not for a parent together enough to homeschool------ARGH!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700871570">IN our area of BC I notice that  the &quot;Head Start&quot; program (whatever they call it here-mind blip) is receiving lots of press and is  slanting its promos to  &quot;all families&quot;. making  it sound like a &quot;must&quot; for all preschoolers to get them ready to do well in public school. I think there must be grant money out there to be had---&quot;pay per head?&quot;<br/>
When the girls tried grade two last year the sec. questioned me when I left the  &quot;are they native or part native&quot; area of the  application form blank.  (they are actually-about 1/4 but she is not aware of that )  I  asked her why-did the girls get to do  workshops on  Native Heritage? or something similar?  ( I &quot;knew&quot; what the answer was  so I kind of pressed the point-after a couple of hmms-she said well the school would  some funding if they were.<br/>
 Also after some investigation -actually when they were in Kindergarten before we took them out  to homeschool I enquired about a remedial reading workshop they were put in with another child. There was a conflct  of information  on their &quot;report card&quot; when their teacher said they actually were doing  just fine. When I went in to enquire I was referred to the remedial teacher-who was by the way a lovely and gentle  teacher- that they were included  to accompany the other girl-who they did not know-( so that wasnt the reason.) and that she thought they would &quot;make a nice little group&quot;-her words which I remember clearly as it all was striking me as so odd <br/>
. I actually believe that as the girls were not happy with going to school and would cry or make a fuss in the coat room or not come in  from the playground after recess on occasion -they had been labeled  as having &quot;problems&quot; so they  could justify  sending them  to the remedial teacher.   A few months later I mentioned it to  a friend  who was a teacher-she said  &quot;oh they get funded by the head  so they need to have the numbers to keep this teacher in her half time position.&quot;<br/>
I had no problem with the fact that the girls went to this teacher-they liked her, they liked the little group , being Kindergarten the other kids did not know about labelling them because  they left the room to go into the other group. <br/>
I did and do  have Big Issues with the way they  maneuver  kids and parents around just because they can.<br/>
I have seen lots of similar incidents with our own grown kids and some of my other grandkids.<br/>

     I&#39;d have to come up w/some stock replies for this junk. Maybe <br/>
  smthg like, &quot;I can see how you might feel that way, but I feel <br/>
  differently. I *like* being with my kids a lot.&quot;<br/>
