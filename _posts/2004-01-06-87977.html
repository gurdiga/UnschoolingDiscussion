No Time for Teaching: Spontaneous Learning at Home<br/>
Issue 113, July/August 2002<br/>
By Becky Jackson<br/>
<br/>
In the four years I spent pursuing an education degree, I learned a lot  <br/>
about what to teach and how to teach it. Then I spent four years as a  <br/>
full-time mother. I would have to say that I learned more from the  <br/>
latter. In fact, I&#39;ve discovered that the most effective way for young  <br/>
children to learn is not the Program for Effective Teaching model or  <br/>
the whole-language approach: it&#39;s the natural relationship between a  <br/>
mother and child.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a difficult lesson for those of us who are teachers by  <br/>
profession. When I first became a mother, I expected my children to  <br/>
excel because of my expertise. I was convinced that good parents should  <br/>
work continually to make their kids smarter, more capable students. But  <br/>
I didn&#39;t realize how much they would learn by my simply being their  <br/>
mom.<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest daughter was three, I thought it was time to start  <br/>
teaching her numbers and the alphabet. After all, most kids went to  <br/>
preschool. Since mine were at home, and I was a teacher myself, I felt  <br/>
compelled to emulate the school setting. I even bought some workbooks  <br/>
and wrote out plans for educational activities. I&#39;ve always been driven  <br/>
to give my children every possible head start. But after awhile, I had  <br/>
to ask myself what was really best for my daughter, a head start or  <br/>
permission to take it slow? In my race to help her climb to the top  <br/>
academically, I was losing sight of the value of play, leisure,  <br/>
flexibility, and freedom-the very hallmarks of childhood.<br/>
<br/>
There are only so many hours in a day and only a precious few years to  <br/>
be a child. In these days and years, children need time to play, time  <br/>
to leisurely observe and daydream, and time to choose what they want to  <br/>
do. The teacher in me might see such activities as unproductive, but  <br/>
they are very important in the development of a happy, healthy person.  <br/>
My short-lived curriculum was pushed aside in favor of more spontaneous  <br/>
interaction like talking to and having fun with my kids. I realized  <br/>
that my success as a mother was more dependent on the number of smiles  <br/>
and hugs I gave than on the amount of information I dispensed. Besides,  <br/>
the most teachable moments can&#39;t be planned for or regimented. They  <br/>
arise when my children spot a rainbow, ask where butterflies come from,  <br/>
or want to write a note to Grandma. It is in these moments that they  <br/>
are the most inquisitive and receptive to the knowledge I want to give  <br/>
them. Maternal guidance is a powerful teaching tool. Sometimes it&#39;s as  <br/>
purposeful as reading a book or counting crackers with my child. But  <br/>
most of the time it&#39;s incidental, as when we talk about the weather,  <br/>
the animals we see, and the color of our clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Even with the rave reviews I hear about preschool teachers and  <br/>
curricula, I can&#39;t help thinking that I have the best program around.  <br/>
My schedule provides access to all types of play, art, reading, and  <br/>
singing, whenever my kids and I are in the mood. My three year old can  <br/>
spend an hour coloring or finishing a puzzle. My four year old can ride  <br/>
her bike or put on her pink tutu and dance on a whim. There are no set  <br/>
routines or time limits, no methods or lessons-just a mom interacting  <br/>
and sharing the world with her children.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have flourished in the simplicity of home life and loving,  <br/>
responsive maternal care. They have become quite precocious in reciting  <br/>
nursery rhymes, recognizing shapes and letters, and other academic  <br/>
skills, not because they were expertly taught, but because they learned  <br/>
through countless one-on-one conversations and experiences with mom.<br/>
<br/>
I am, indeed, well qualified to help my children reach their  <br/>
potential-but not because of my teaching degree. My real qualifications  <br/>
are these: I&#39;m their mother, I love them, and I know them better than  <br/>
anyone. My kids and I are learning a lot while I&#39;m not teaching.<br/>
<br/>
