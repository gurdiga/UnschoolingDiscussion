<div id="ygrps-yiv-137398565">In the time since this list was active there are a few new  <br/>
resources.  One is the many blogs unschoolers are keeping.  I have  <br/>
links to many of them here (and a question about a roller coaster, so  <br/>
if people in your family are roller coaster fans, or geographers...)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Newly online is the audio of a talk Ren Allen and I did in St. Louis  <br/>
in 2005:<br/>

(at the bottom of that page)<br/>
<br/>
If someone reading this has been away from online unschooling things  <br/>
for a while, be sure to check Joyce&#39;s page.  She&#39;s always adding to  <br/>
it quietly.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
News of my own pages gets announced more &quot;loudly&quot; here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
There is a forum for unschoolers (with blogs and all kinds of stuff  <br/>
internal to that forum) here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://familyrun.ning.com/profile/SandraDodd">http://familyrun.ning.com/profile/SandraDodd</a><br/>
(Oh.  That will get you to my own page, but you can click &quot;main&quot; from  <br/>
there.)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling.info is still there too:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.info/forum/">http://www.unschooling.info/forum/</a><br/>
which is a better place for those who are just curious or want some  <br/>
answers or ideas without committing to &quot;a community&quot; (as the Family  <br/>
Radical Unschoolers Network above is set up to be)<br/>
<br/>
This time of year is often very quiet in discussions such as this, so  <br/>
don&#39;t worry that things aren&#39;t busy.  It doesn&#39;t mean this list won&#39;t  <br/>
spark back up later.   And it&#39;s here if you need it.<br/>
<br/>
Merry Christmas or other winter holiday of your choice,<br/>
<br/>
