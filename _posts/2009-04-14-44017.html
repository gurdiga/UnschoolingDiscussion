<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412374037">I had a question on the side, and my response has bounced twice, so it  <br/>
the one who wrote to me earlier on Monday could send an alternate e- <br/>
mail, maybe, I could send what I wrote.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t much, but perhaps others here can recommend a resource or  <br/>
perhaps volunteer to correspond.  Write to me on the side, if so,  <br/>
please.<br/>
<br/>
We had a chat on this topic last month and that wasn&#39;t saved, because  <br/>
of the sensitive nature of the topic, but this link was shared:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.uua.org/religiouseducation/curricula/ourwhole/">http://www.uua.org/religiouseducation/curricula/ourwhole/</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the Unitarian Universalists&#39; program on &quot;Lifespan Sexuality  <br/>
Education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not all abuse is sexual in nature, and I&#39;m not suggesting that.  I&#39;m  <br/>
only saying that it&#39;s the only thing I have saved from that chat.<br/>
<br/>
If this can be discussed here in very general terms--what can be done  <br/>
to help children feel safe and attached, within an unschooling  <br/>
context--that would be fine.  If there are outside resources that can  <br/>
be suggested, or books, that would be great too.<br/>
<br/>
Is there an adoption group/site where people are aware of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
