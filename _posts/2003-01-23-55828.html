<div id="ygrps-yiv-207719831">This is one of my favorite unschooling quotes because Laura lived into <br/>
the 1950&#39;s and there&#39;s no way her parents could have forecast accurately <br/>
what she would need to know in her adult life.<br/>
<br/>
Her Pa says:&quot; I wouldn&#39;t wonder if you&#39;ll live to see a time, Laura, <br/>
when pretty nearly everybody&#39;ll ride on railroads and there&#39;ll hardly be <br/>
a covered wagon left.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Imagine.<br/>
<br/>
