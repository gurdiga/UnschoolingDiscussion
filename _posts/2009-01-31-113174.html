<div id="ygrps-yiv-563324880">Well, I finally got the courage to tell my husband about unschooling<br/>
after last night online chat with Sandra and others.  We have been HS<br/>
for the last 5 yrs and finally decided to US.  Just got way to<br/>
frustrating and time consuming(and unhealthy) for me and my son to sit<br/>
in front of books for the 9-3 it would take him to do the little work<br/>
we had set to do.  I was very unhappy.  And like they say &quot;if mamma<br/>
ain&#39;t happy......&quot;<br/>
So I told my hubby about US and his reply was &quot;it sound like a bunch<br/>
of.....&quot;.  &quot;it sounds like we are giving up&quot;  That made me laugh<br/>
because i could never count on him to do any school work our son, even<br/>
if i had a Dr. appt. or something where it would have been nice for<br/>
him to help out.  So i really didn&#39;t get the WE part.  Anyhow, it&#39;s<br/>
going to be a struggle everyday.  I get the &quot;when are you going to do<br/>
school work?&quot; thing every morning which I dread!!!!!!  So much for<br/>
support. I am on my own with a husband that believes that school is<br/>
the only way.  I believe that &quot;schooling&quot;  probably made him as narrow<br/>
minded as he is!  Anyway, the positive is that we travel a bit and<br/>
spend months out of the country.  How can books teach you anything<br/>
about the world and diff. cultures better than living them!  Learn<br/>
thru life is my new motto!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-12973074"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; We have been HS<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If your husband doesn&#39;t agree, who&#39;s the &quot;we?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You could move from what you&#39;re doing gradually, by doing things  <br/>
differently.  Instead of your son reading a chapter and answering the  <br/>
questions, you could read the chapter aloud, stopping to talk if it  <br/>
was interesting, or zipping through if it wasn&#39;t.  Or you could go  <br/>
through the questions aloud yourself before reading it, and if he  <br/>
knows it all already, skip that chapter.<br/>
<br/>
It might be a way to satisfy your husband&#39;s concerns and not abruptly  <br/>
change your son&#39;s expectations or routine.  If he&#39;s comfortable with  <br/>
unschooling, that&#39;s fine, but I never talked to my kids much about  <br/>
unschooling at all--I just found cool things to do when they were  <br/>
babies and continued to do so until... well I still do that.<br/>
<br/>
You and your son could mine the school materials for good parts,  <br/>
maybe, and if you can&#39;t find any good parts that will give you both  <br/>
confidence.  If you DO find good parts, that can indicate what other  <br/>
kinds of things you might want to move toward.  If he likes grammar,  <br/>
there are LOTS of humorous books on the history of English--trivia  <br/>
books with short passages on words and phrases that will tie into  <br/>
history and geography and explorations.   Sometimes explorers brought  <br/>
back gold, but sometimes they brought back words and ideas--names for  <br/>
new things and conditions and objects and mountains and religious icons.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So i really didn&#39;t get the WE part. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I didn&#39;t either, up above, or here.  If he&#39;s not helping and is  <br/>
letting you make decisions about how your son learns, good.  But if  <br/>
he&#39;s going to bug you every morning, maybe say &quot;Don&#39;t ask this  <br/>
question for a year.&quot;  Put it on the calendar if you need to.  Tell  <br/>
him you want a year of non-interference and THEN the two of you can  <br/>
talk about it and consider what to do then.  But then you&#39;ll need to  <br/>
make that year a great, fun, sparkly one!  (as all unschoolers&#39; years  <br/>
should be)<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am on my own with a husband that believes that school is the only  <br/>
way. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Be careful that you don&#39;t end up on your own without a husband, and  <br/>
with a judge who decrees that school is the only way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-356889561">Hi Sandra.  Enjoyed the chat last night&gt;<br/>
Sorry I wasn;t clear on the &quot;we&quot; part.  When I said &quot;we&quot; I meant me and my son.  In regaurds to my DH not being on board, well that&#39;s a whole other topic in its self. <br/>
 We have gradually been doing less and less school work to ease into unschooling. Actually we have no routine, we do less days of school work than we do schoolwork.  But he is noticing since he&#39;s retired and home all day.  Which i would think it&#39;s a positive for our son to have bother parents to be with all day.  <br/>
We, my son and I,  read a lot and he is fluent and literate in 2 and almost 3 languages.  He did not get that from doing schoolwork. <br/>
As to divorce, I dare not since I would probably have to find a job, work all day and send my son to school.  That is not something I want for me or my son.   We will find our way into it and my hubby will, hopefully, start enjoying our son as well.  I am positive that it will work out once he sees that I am happier and so is my son.  It also will give us the freedom to do things since my hubby waits around for us to finish schoolwork to go out.<br/>
Thanks, your site has been very helpful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What ways can you draw your husband into being with his son? What  <br/>
does he like to do? What can they do together?<br/>
<br/>
 From how you worded it -- and maybe that&#39;s what you&#39;re feeling at  <br/>
the moment -- it&#39;s sounding like it&#39;s the two of you (son and mom) vs  <br/>
the dad. And that will just drive him further away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082023987">My guess is that you talked about what you&#39;re not going to do - no more <br/>
seatwork, no more worksheets, etc. Instead of talking about what you&#39;re <br/>
giving up doing, talk about what you ARE going to do, instead. Start <br/>
doing cool things with your kids instead of schoolwork. On a day you <br/>
would have done school work, go to a children&#39;s museum or the beach or <br/>
watch some cool shows on the Discovery Channel.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t just say, &quot;We are not going to do school.&quot; It is just too much to <br/>
expect that most people who aren&#39;t with the children all the time and <br/>
haven&#39;t been reading and talking and thinking unschooling, are going to <br/>
even comprehend what you&#39;re talking about if you spring it on them all <br/>
at once.<br/>
<br/>
I just did it. The first month we did a unit study and had a blast. The <br/>
second month we did  a unit study that wasn&#39;t quite so cool, although it <br/>
had some cool aspects and we certainly were FAR from miserable. After <br/>
that we unschooled, but I made no big announcement. We just got busy <br/>
with doing fun things together. That was their &quot;schooling&quot; as far as I <br/>
was concerned, even though it had no resemblance to conventional <br/>
schooling. I had no problem at all considering the real-life fun <br/>
individual-child-centered life we were living as a perfectly legitimate <br/>
way to homeschool.  We had no big discussion about it. I WAS still <br/>
homeschooling them in the way I knew was by far the most supportive of <br/>
them receiving an outstanding &quot;education&quot; tailored just for them <br/>
(largely BY them, how could it not be individualized? &lt;g&gt;). I kept a <br/>
notebook in which I jotted down what we were doing and I would sometimes <br/>
put those things into educationeze. When my husband wanted to talk about <br/>
what the children were doing for school, I&#39;d pull that out and talk <br/>
about what we&#39;d done. I wish I had those records -but we had a fire in <br/>
our house and that notebook was destroyed. I only did it for a few <br/>
months, but it was enough for my husband to slowly grasp that we weren&#39;t <br/>
doing &quot;reading lessons&quot; but we were very much supporting our kids&#39; <br/>
developing interest and competency in the skills that would lead to <br/>
reading. We weren&#39;t doing &quot;science&quot; but we were doing a HUGE amount of <br/>
science. This stuff is super easy when the kids are young - a walk <br/>
around the block provides social studies and science and math - all <br/>
right there for you to explore.<br/>
<br/>
When someone says unschooling sounds like giving up, it means they have <br/>
not come close to understanding how very very hands-on intensive <br/>
unschooling is.<br/>

park, etc. If they want to get knowledge through books, let them, if<br/>
they want to get knowledge in other ways, let the as long as they are<br/>
learning and don&#39;t get hurt. If your husband isn&#39;t helping out now<br/>
with schooling, then I wouldn&#39;t worry about him helping with<br/>
unschooling..According to my friend Pebs: unschooling is easier<br/>

<br/>
Pebs said that!~?<br/>
<br/>
I guess &quot;just let it happen&quot; was the intended message. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t just happen, though.   Water does flow, but it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t &quot;just flow.&quot;  Something has to cause it to be at the starting  <br/>
place, and gravity pulls it down hill.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can eventually feel very easy and effortless, but that  <br/>
only happens once the initial effort has been invested and maintained.<br/>
