<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728971383">Hi Linda, I know I&#39;m a bit behind on my email...<br/>
Jacli here :)<br/>
<br/>
Just had to say AMEN! I feel exactly as you do.  I hate<br/>
extreme cold, I hate prolonged periods of dark and grey   I<br/>
spent two miserable years in New Hampshire.<br/>
By the end I told hubby dearest I&#39;m gone.  I&#39;m done.  It<br/>
was New Years eve and it was 11 degrees below.<br/>
I told him we have to go.  We don&#39;t have to go back to<br/>
Monterey but we got to get the hell outta here!  I told him<br/>
stay if you like but I will not spend another winter locked<br/>
in doors, trapped in the dark and the cold. <br/>
<br/>
Now we live in Boca Raton, FL.  Still not exactly the<br/>
climate I had in mind but man alive what a difference!<br/>
<br/>
I can breathe again.  I really felt as if NH was slowly but<br/>
surely killing my soul.  I am so happy to make the change,<br/>
but I look at weather reports for the North East and the<br/>
frustration and anger all comes flooding back.  Until you<br/>
can make the change I&#39;m rooting for you.  <br/>
<br/>
Hang in There!  Jacli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055282584">---WOW!  I missed this email.  Sometimes it amazes me how one person <br/>
can be at one end of a scale and someone else can be at another.  <br/>
Quit funny actually.  I live in MIchigan and LOVE the winters.  Yeah, <br/>
our winters aren&#39;t THAT bad, but I love snow, cold, dressing in <br/>
layers of clothing, going outside to play and coming in to curl up on <br/>
the couch with a cup of hot coffee, white pine trees, ice hanging off <br/>
leafless trees, white yards, etc... <br/>
<br/>
I lived in Texas for one year and had to get out of there.  During <br/>
the summer I hated to leave the air conditioned house...I couldn&#39;t <br/>
breathe in the heat :-))  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I&#39;m rambling...just shows how different we all are!!<br/>

&gt; Just had to say AMEN! I feel exactly as you do.  I hate<br/>
&gt; extreme cold, I hate prolonged periods of dark and grey   I<br/>
&gt; spent two miserable years in New Hampshire.<br/>
&gt; By the end I told hubby dearest I&#39;m gone.  I&#39;m done.  It<br/>
&gt; was New Years eve and it was 11 degrees below.<br/>
&gt; I told him we have to go.  We don&#39;t have to go back to<br/>
&gt; Monterey but we got to get the hell outta here!  I told him<br/>
&gt; stay if you like but I will not spend another winter locked<br/>
&gt; in doors, trapped in the dark and the cold. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now we live in Boca Raton, FL.  Still not exactly the<br/>
&gt; climate I had in mind but man alive what a difference!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can breathe again.  I really felt as if NH was slowly but<br/>
&gt; surely killing my soul.  I am so happy to make the change,<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;    Funny. My dd wants a small breasted Barbie.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I remember Skipper, Barbie&#39;s sad little flat, flat cousin<br/>
&gt; (?) .  I always<br/>
&gt; &gt;was afraid poor skipper would grow up to be a serial<br/>
&gt; killer, having those<br/>
&gt; &gt;huge bosoms flaunted at her all the time.  And what kind<br/>
&gt; of name is that,<br/>
&gt; &gt;Skipper?  Poor thing. <br/>

&gt; &gt;We sent off 17 boxes of clothes.  This year we &quot;adopted&quot; 3<br/>
&gt; elders who we<br/>
&gt; &gt;made afghans for and are just finishing up scarves and<br/>
&gt; hats and will buy<br/>
&gt; &gt;slippers and gloves for.  And we are also collecting warm<br/>
&gt; clothing and<br/>
&gt; &gt;blankets.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The kidlets love doing it and it makes the mommy heart<br/>
&gt; feel good that they<br/>
&gt; &gt;think of giving before they think of getting.  Youngest<br/>
&gt; routinely clears<br/>
&gt; &gt;out<br/>
&gt; &gt;her toys and puts them in piles for donating.  It was<br/>
&gt; &quot;cute&quot; to hear her<br/>
&gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;last time in her room talking to herself about how she<br/>
&gt; needed to be a<br/>
&gt; &gt;little<br/>
&gt; &gt;gentler when she played so that when she no longer wanted<br/>
&gt; to play with<br/>
&gt; &gt;something it would be good enough to give to someone else<br/>
&gt; &quot;to love it all<br/>
&gt; &gt;over again.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;As to the folks expecting to live off this the rest of<br/>
&gt; their lives,<br/>
&gt; &gt;O&#39;Reilly<br/>
&gt; &gt;has had several on his show.  The owner of a company one<br/>
&gt; gal&#39;s husband<br/>
&gt; &gt;worked for said that he was going to give each family<br/>
&gt; $100,000 over 5 years<br/>
&gt; &gt;plus paid medical benefits for 10 years.  She commented<br/>
&gt; that she hadn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;seen<br/>
&gt; &gt;it yet, doesn&#39;t believe him AND &quot;what am I suppose to do<br/>
&gt; after that.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;All of them except one that he has had on his show have<br/>
&gt; complained because<br/>
&gt; &gt;they had to fill out forms and I know the Red X can be a<br/>
&gt; pain about<br/>
&gt; &gt;paperwork and I sympathise HOWEVER, if you want the money<br/>
&gt; then you play by<br/>
&gt; &gt;their rules.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;One complained that she had to go down to an office to<br/>
&gt; fill in paperwork,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;I<br/>
&gt; &gt;don&#39;t have time, I have other things to do with my time.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Then went on to<br/>
&gt; &gt;complain that she hadn&#39;t gotten any money.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t know, it just all seemed so greedy and<br/>
&gt; self-serving and little or<br/>
&gt; &gt;nothing was said about the folks that they lost.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;d like to see those scholarships that are suppose to be<br/>
&gt; set up go to<br/>
&gt; &gt;children of folks lost in any of the horrific<br/>
&gt; tragedies--Oklahoma City,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&#39;93,<br/>
&gt; &gt;Cole, etc.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; for children who lost parents on Sept. 11.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Helping is one thing but there are people out there<br/>

&gt; &gt;Yes, that&#39;s right, Finger Lakes region.  right between<br/>
&gt; Seneca and Cayuga<br/>
&gt; &gt;Lakes.  It has turned really cold today, since yesterday.<br/>
&gt; a 30 degree<br/>
&gt; &gt;drop and oh the wind!<br/>
&gt; &gt;A good day to stay in and bake muffins.  We usually have<br/>
&gt; Friday off from<br/>
&gt; &gt;school which kind of leaves the day open. Yay!  you and<br/>
&gt; your family have<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;10yo dd came in today and asked for math and spelling<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;She doesn&#39;t set the world on fire in either of these<br/>
&gt; areas admittedly, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;turns out she was subjected to a &quot;pop quiz&quot; by some of<br/>
&gt; the kids in her<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;gymnastics class and &quot;failed&quot; miserably.  Adriane was<br/>
&gt; mortified.  She<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;doesn&#39;t handle herself well in these situations and tends<br/>
&gt; to just stand<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;there and be embarrassed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Poor little!  My 10yo dd has had this happen too.  My<br/>
&gt; heart breaks because<br/>
&gt; &gt;we make so much progress with her self esteem and then it<br/>
&gt; is so easily<br/>
&gt; &gt;knocked down.  Not to mention the immediate feelings of<br/>
&gt; guilt I get for<br/>
&gt; &gt;not working more on her times tables.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I guess we need to give them more preparation for these<br/>
&gt; things.  What<br/>
&gt; &gt;would you say to those kids if you were in her shoes?<br/>
&gt; Give them a<br/>
&gt; &gt;confident reply.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;All those conversations about different learning styles,<br/>
&gt; what she knows<br/>
&gt; &gt;over them...those are lost at times like that.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It&#39;s a good learning experience for realizing the damage<br/>
&gt; you can do to<br/>
&gt; &gt;another person with your words.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I would go ahead and get her a math workbook.  You can get<br/>
&gt; those spectrum<br/>
&gt; &gt;ones that are by grade and tell her to work at her own<br/>
&gt; pace.  She may love<br/>
&gt; &gt;it, she may hate it.  It&#39;s cheaper than a curriculum and<br/>
&gt; will give her<br/>
&gt; &gt;what she is looking for.  I have one child that adores her<br/>
&gt; workbooks and<br/>
&gt; &gt;my 10 hates them...but that is what she pulls out when she<br/>
&gt; runs into<br/>
&gt; &gt;something like that. (I buy them for the 10 too, because<br/>
&gt; inevitably she<br/>
&gt; &gt;feels jilted if she doesn&#39;t get one) <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;They also use those workbooks when they &quot;play school&quot; with<br/>
&gt; their friends. <br/>
&gt; &gt;They enjoy checking each others work.  And the answers are<br/>
&gt; right in<br/>
&gt; &gt;back...mine use these to check their own work....not so<br/>
&gt; mortifying to<br/>
&gt; &gt;catch your own mistakes.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I think the media is convincing us that we, as Americans,<br/>
&gt; must do<br/>
&gt; &gt;something to help, somehting to show our patriotism.  And<br/>
&gt; I think the<br/>
&gt; &gt;media, and peer pressure are convincing many people that<br/>
&gt; NOT giving money<br/>
&gt; &gt;to the rc or whoever is pretty much unAmerican.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So, you want to do something...but what?  We are so stuck<br/>
&gt; on this<br/>
&gt; &gt;immediate gratification thing.  What I feel I need to do<br/>
&gt; is not going to<br/>
&gt; &gt;happen overnight.  I need to practice wha tthis tragedy<br/>
&gt; has taught me all<br/>
&gt; &gt;the days of my life.  Not just during this immediate<br/>
&gt; crisis.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I need to practice tolerance, I need to teach it to my<br/>
&gt; children.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I need to practice giving, I need to teach my dhildren to<br/>
&gt; give.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I need to sacrifice,  I need to teach my children to<br/>
&gt; sacrifice.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I need to pray, I need to teach my children to pray.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I need to be willing to do the small stuff in my own<br/>
&gt; neighborhood to<br/>
&gt; &gt;promote unitedness,  I need to be proud of being an<br/>
&gt; American---every day. <br/>
&gt; &gt;I need to sing God Bless America, I need to pledge<br/>
&gt; allegiance to the flag<br/>
&gt; &gt;from now until my death I need to do these things. <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It&#39;s so easy to act in times of crisis...the hard part<br/>
&gt; comes when the<br/>
&gt; &gt;crisis is over...What will you do then?<br/>

&gt; &gt;Well, this is probably not going to be a popular opinion,<br/>
&gt; but I think<br/>
&gt; &gt;enough<br/>
&gt; &gt;is enough!  WTC was a great tragedy but exactly how many<br/>
&gt; BILLIONS are they<br/>
&gt; &gt;going to collect?  Helping is one thing but there are<br/>
&gt; people out there that<br/>
&gt; &gt;think they should be supported for the rest of their<br/>
&gt; lives!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;And, exactly who is the money going to?  All I hear is<br/>
&gt; fire fighters and<br/>
&gt; &gt;WTC.  What about the folks in the Pentagon and on the<br/>
&gt; flight that went down<br/>
&gt; &gt;before it could do any damage?  Now, the folks on that<br/>
&gt; flight to me are<br/>
&gt; &gt;REAL<br/>
&gt; &gt;heros!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Or, as far as that goes, what about the folks from &#39;93 or<br/>
&gt; Oklahoma City or<br/>
&gt; &gt;the USS Cole or the embassies.  Did their families get<br/>
&gt; anything?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I think the public has become obsessed with collecting<br/>
&gt; money and I think<br/>
&gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;media is having hayday with it.  Politics as usual!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sheri responds:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I somewhat agree.... although almost 6,000 voices were<br/>
&gt; quited that day,<br/>
&gt; &gt;this<br/>
&gt; &gt;has never happened in our history and I pray never will<br/>
&gt; again. Most of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;funds are for all the victims, even when it is labeled for<br/>
&gt; a specific<br/>
&gt; &gt;group.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;AND the reason it there are so many fundraisers is because<br/>
&gt; it hit in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;backyard of the entertainment and news industries. It is<br/>
&gt; very real to them<br/>
&gt; &gt;and the have the power to raise the big funds.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Okay, enough said by me... hehehe<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919621853">I have to reply to this one even if it is old. We are just north of Seattle<br/>
and I LOVE SNOW! I love the darker days and long evenings. It is starting to<br/>
get dark at 4:30 now and this time of year really makes me warm. The<br/>
settling in of it all. I do wish we had more snow. At least regular snow,<br/>
that we can depend on being here every year, rather than hoping for a little<br/>
bit of the white stuff. We lived for a few years down in southern<br/>
California, and although there is a part of me that feels I could possibly<br/>
live right on the beach there, I really missed the seasons when we lived<br/>
down there. Shorts and a t-shirt in January was a real downer. I actually<br/>
found it to be depressing. There is a part of me that really comes alive in<br/>
the fall/winter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-639806118">That&#39;s funny, because I&#39;m feeling like that with the heat and opressive<br/>
sunshine here in Tucson. I&#39;ll last this winter here, but I&#39;m getting out<br/>
before summer. I get as much cabin fever here in the summer where you can&#39;t<br/>
go outside in the heat as I figure people in the snow get. When it starts to<br/>
cool down in November and we can open the windows, I feel like a new person,<br/>
and start to get a little energy.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, though, I don&#39;t want to go where there&#39;s a LOT of snow, either, just<br/>
someplace with four seasons.<br/>

&gt; Just had to say AMEN! I feel exactly as you do.  I hate<br/>
&gt; extreme cold, I hate prolonged periods of dark and grey   I<br/>
&gt; spent two miserable years in New Hampshire.<br/>
&gt; By the end I told hubby dearest I&#39;m gone.  I&#39;m done.  It<br/>
&gt; was New Years eve and it was 11 degrees below.<br/>
&gt; I told him we have to go.  We don&#39;t have to go back to<br/>
&gt; Monterey but we got to get the hell outta here!  I told him<br/>
&gt; stay if you like but I will not spend another winter locked<br/>
&gt; in doors, trapped in the dark and the cold.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now we live in Boca Raton, FL.  Still not exactly the<br/>
&gt; climate I had in mind but man alive what a difference!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can breathe again.  I really felt as if NH was slowly but<br/>
&gt; surely killing my soul.  I am so happy to make the change,<br/>
&gt; but I look at weather reports for the North East and the<br/>
&gt; frustration and anger all comes flooding back.  Until you<br/>
&gt; can make the change I&#39;m rooting for you.<br/>

&gt; Hang in There!  Jacli<br/>

&gt; &gt;No, I do not like snow, sleet, hail, etc..anything that<br/>
&gt; looks like snow.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Acutally I am feeling pretty down about it. I felt very<br/>
&gt; caged in yesterday.<br/>
&gt; &gt;And right now I can&#39;t even see myself tolerating the cold<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313952128">Bully for you! <br/>
<br/>
Yes, you hit the nail on the head. We are up in the 50&#39;s and its like a heat <br/>
wave.<br/>
The snow did melt and went away. I know its just lurking out there ready to<br/>
dump on us again when we least expect it!<br/>
Florida has a wonderful ring to it! I should like to bask in everything it <br/>
would have<br/>
to offer, except for the crime. See I know this as I watch wayyy to much TV,<br/>
which ha ha, scares me right into staying where I am at. <br/>
And like ND doesn&#39;t have the crime, but in the winter the kooks all seem to <br/>
leave!<br/>
<br/>
thinking again way to much! LOL<br/>

year it rained so hard when we left the motel in the morning and headed back<br/>
out to the stabling area we found horses up to their knees in water.  Anther<br/>
year we got a frantic phone call.  Seems the wind can get kinda strong and<br/>
it had literally blown the barns away (portable stalls).<br/>

I gave up on going somewhere to see some warmth and sunshine in the winter.<br/>

are held and that&#39;s where we use to haul every February.  It was bad enough<br/>
but the last two times we found them ankle deep in water and the last time<br/>
we went the portable stalls literally blow away leaving horses running<br/>

&gt; &gt; year it rained so hard when we left the motel in the morning and<br/>
&gt; headed back<br/>
&gt; &gt; out to the stabling area we found horses up to their knees in water.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Anther year we got a frantic phone call.  Seems the wind can get kinda<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; strong and it had literally blown the barns away (portable stalls).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No, no, no, that&#39;s not &quot;winter&quot;. That&#39;s the monsoon season - happens<br/>
&gt; every January-ish and every August-ish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My sister has done horses here in Arizona for over 10 years and I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; recall anything like that happening with her horses, though... was this<br/>
&gt; in 93? That was a year of big winter flooding...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And even though it&#39;s November we wear shorts every day and run the air<br/>
&gt; consitioning in the car... :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>February in the Phoenix area can offer a wide range of weather. It <br/>
can be sunny and 85 or rainy and 55.<br/>
There is a good way to predict the weather at that time, however. <br/>
Whenever there are outdoor events scheduled, be it horse shows or <br/>
golf tournaments, there is a good chance that it will be a rainy, <br/>
cold day. After living here for almost 15 yrs, I have taken note of <br/>
this strange pattern. When out-of-towners come here in winter <br/>
expecting nice, sunny & warm weather, they are usually dissapointed. <br/>
However, winter in Phoenix is what I live for! IMO, it&#39;s the best <br/>
time of the year.<br/>
