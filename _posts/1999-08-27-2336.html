<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143524265">Hi Susan!  You said:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve been lurking....things have been SO crazy here....but I just had to<br/>
ditto Jill&#39;s message.  People assume a big negative for me with HS is not<br/>
getting a break from the children.  I find I&#39;m worn out from the baby and<br/>
preschool age child....But I LOVE having my 7.5 year old around.  It&#39;s a joy<br/>
to have her be here and stay closely connected to her younger siblings<br/>
rather than being pulled into the &#39;world of school&#39;  while the little ones<br/>
are home.  And she and I have learned to give each other space and &#39;breaks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So true!<br/>
One of the reason my daughter - at 9th grade- decided to homeschool was<br/>
because she had seen the bond between her brothers (12yo & 1yo) grow and she<br/>
felt left out.  The baby really didn&#39;t know her!  The boys are still very<br/>
close (at 18 & 7) in spite of the age differance.  Although when Cole asked<br/>
last night if he had plans for 5:00, Cody replied &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;  I guess<br/>
he&#39;s learning that sometimes older brothers will offer activities that are<br/>
more work than fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343972750">My sister has asked me to put a question on the list.  She has two kids,<br/>
Drue who is four, and Declan who is two.   She is expecting another baby<br/>

<br/>
&quot;It is unheard of for a day to go by without her hitting, punching, kicking,<br/>
and yelling. She is soooooo mean to him. When we try to talk to her she says<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not listening to you at all&quot;. She gets mad at him for everything. If he<br/>

Pay more attention to the other one.<br/>
When the little one is asleep make it a priority to be with the older one.<br/>
When she can, take the older one somewhere JUST HER.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538963421">She must protect her 2 year old and set down limits.  Hurting people is <br/>
not acceptable.  I guess I would take a two fold approach.  I would <br/>
first make it so she could not be in the same room or within a few feet <br/>
of her brother without someone touching her, even if it is simply they <br/>
are holding her hand or holding her in their lap.  THere are times when <br/>
my two girls are constantly bickering (although they rarely hit, <br/>
sometimes they pinch or violate each other&#39;s physical space with their <br/>
feet, etc.) and I simply say it sounds like you both need some time away <br/>
from each other, so for a while you are not allowed in the same room.  <br/>
They are a bit older by my five year old understands this so I think <br/>
most four year olds would understand.  After a few hours of being told <br/>
they can&#39;t be in the same room they are begging to play with each other <br/>
again.   The two children just simply should not be in the same room <br/>
unless there is constant, immediate supervision, with mom or another <br/>
adult right there.  It sounds like the two share a room, and if possible <br/>
that should end.  If not, then the parents need to make sure both are <br/>
asleep before letting them share a room.  The 2 year old can go to sleep <br/>
in mom&#39;s room until the 4 year old is asleep. <br/>
<br/>
Second, there is something making this little girl very angry and the <br/>
parents need to figure it out.  If there is a good play therapist around <br/>
a few visits might not hurt, especially with a new baby on the way.  <br/>
Also mom (and dad)  needs to find time to spend with each child alone, <br/>
at least 30 minutes a day and a longer time on the weekend.  My parents <br/>
used to have Saturday be my day and Sunday be my sister&#39;s day.  This was <br/>
with my mom while the other kids were with my dad, but the next weekend <br/>
it would be dad&#39;s turn to take me out while my sister and brother stayed <br/>
with my mom.  My brother had a day too, I&#39;m sure.  (Just so you dont&#39; <br/>
think my parents ignored him).  But anyway, it really helped to have <br/>
that alone time.  During the week we&#39;d read, talk, etc.  At four some of <br/>
the best times I had with my daughter was when she was taking a bath and <br/>
right before bed.  Lots of one on one and talking without other things <br/>
to do or distractions. Letting the child pick the activity, but <br/>
encouraging activities (likes walks, book reading, etc.) that allow lots <br/>
of talking, holding hands, cuddling. <br/>
<br/>
There area  lot of good books about new siblings.  And books about angry <br/>
feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and if the parents spank, it&#39;s time to stop and never spank again. <br/>
<br/>
This little girl is very unhappy and stressed.  She&#39;s crying out for help. <br/>

**Hi Joylyn - Yes, she is.  My sister and her husband parent the way most of<br/>
us on this list do - they wouldn&#39;t think of spanking her.  I think staying<br/>
right next to her when she is with Declan is a good idea, and I do think<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-913262803">Siblings Without Rivalry is an interesting book.  As I first read it, I<br/>
thought the people were a bunch of over-sensitive whiners.  I grew up in a<br/>
family of 9 and don&#39;t remember any of those thoughts.  I always knew my<br/>
folks loved me...how could they not??  I&#39;m wonderful!!  But as I read more<br/>
in the book, I realized that lots of those thoughts and feelings might have<br/>
been experienced by my siblings.  I haven&#39;t asked them, but I&#39;d bet money<br/>
that some of it applied.  I took a few good things away from that<br/>
book....things that seemed at first to be ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell from the message, but was Drue &quot;coddled&quot; when Declan arrived?<br/>
Did Mom and Dad promise that they still loved her and they would still have<br/>
their time together?<br/>
<br/>
When my kids come along, we don&#39;t talk about that stuff.  We tell them that<br/>
there&#39;s a new baby coming and isn&#39;t that wonderful.  We talk about all the<br/>
things they&#39;ll be able to teach the baby and how much more love we&#39;ll have<br/>
in the family.  My kids know that love multiplies, it doesn&#39;t get divided.<br/>
They also know that *time* gets divided and shared and that that&#39;s just a<br/>
fact of life.<br/>
<br/>
The only time I hear something like, &quot;I hate him!  I wish he were never<br/>
born!!&quot; is when they are really mad or if a young&#39;un has just kicked over<br/>
the chinese checkers game (again).<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who has two kids and they have done the &quot;this new baby won&#39;t<br/>
replace you in my heart&quot; routine.  The girls do get along well, but there is<br/>
a constant jealous undertone.  Now there is another baby on the way and all<br/>
the concern is there again, making the problem bigger than it needs to be.<br/>
<br/>
This is just anecdotal evidence, but I think that if parents make a big deal<br/>
out of the negatives of a new family member, even by reiterating the<br/>
positive ways to counteract the negatives, the child will seize on the<br/>
negatives.<br/>
<br/>
Her parents are going to have to quit putting up with Drue&#39;s crap.  She can<br/>
have all the feelings that she wants, but when it comes to others in the<br/>
family, especially those younger and weaker than she is, she needs to shape<br/>
up.  I think that having her own room doesn&#39;t help matters much.  Drue<br/>
doesn&#39;t get a choice in the decision for another family member, so no one<br/>
should make like she does.  That&#39;s unfair to all concerned.  I don&#39;t know if<br/>
this child&#39;s behavior can be changed without some serious effort on the<br/>
parents&#39; part.<br/>

Lots of cuddling helps.  It&#39;s also anecdotal evidence, but I believe, as <br/>

pregnancy and birth, have them read to the baby while in utero, sing <br/>
songs to the baby, talk and pat and kiss and love the baby, and then if <br/>
possible have them there at the birth.  Have them hold the baby as <br/>
quickly as possible, help with the taking care of the baby.  My sister <br/>
had a baby when her oldest was a mear 17 months old but the older baby <br/>
could go get water for Julie (they would keep water bottles on the <br/>
bottom shelf of the fridge), diapers, snacks for Julie while she was <br/>
nursing, etc.  He also would be responsible for rubbing the baby&#39;s head <br/>
while nursing or diaper changes, and talking to the baby.  The older <br/>
child was not at all verbal (he barely spoke until 3 years but he had a <br/>
highly complex form of sign language that served him quite well) but he <br/>
could hum and say baby baby baby, etc. <br/>

&lt;&lt; This is just anecdotal evidence, but I think that if parents make a big <br/>
deal<br/>
<br/>
out of the negatives of a new family member, even by reiterating the<br/>
<br/>
positive ways to counteract the negatives, the child will seize on the<br/>
<br/>
negatives. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That could be true, but maybe greater than that is whether the child is <br/>
emotionally needy.  Even only children can be needy, and some humans are just <br/>
naturally more needy than others.  Punishing them for being themselves (even <br/>
punishment by being declared bad or a problem) is cold.  If the parents haven&#39;t <br/>
figured out a way to help the child feel right and whole, why should the child <br/>
suffer even more?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Her parents are going to have to quit putting up with Drue&#39;s crap.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s way too harsh for my sensibilities.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s four.  Her life got worse, and she was marginalized.  She&#39;s about to be <br/>
#3 on the priorities list, not the smaller (need- and attention-wise) of two, <br/>
but of three.  She might feel like she&#39;s about to disappear.   That&#39;s not <br/>
&quot;crap.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Drue doesn&#39;t get a choice in the decision for another family member, so no <br/>
one<br/>
<br/>
should make like she does. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like it&#39;s okay for decisions to be made for HER, though by everyone <br/>
else.<br/>
<br/>
She can get to help make whatever decisions her parents decide she can make.  <br/>
There are people who have had other children or not, based in part from input <br/>
of their existing children.  That&#39;s not crap either.  They are not &quot;making <br/>
like she does,&quot; they&#39;re honestly asking for input from members of their family.  <br/>
(Not this family, but the families I&#39;m thinking of.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That&#39;s unfair to all concerned.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s okay to be unfair to children and tell them to get over their crap, <br/>
but if a child expresses an opinion, they&#39;re being unfair to all concerned?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t know if<br/>
<br/>
this child&#39;s behavior can be changed without some serious effort on the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, it&#39;s harsh, but it&#39;s down right wrong to hit other people in my <br/>
mind.  Anyone hitting is wrong.  This child is doing it repeatedly and <br/>
according to what was said here, not wanting to hear that this behavior <br/>
is not acceptable.  Maybe I wouldn&#39;t have used the word crap but I think <br/>
what Drue is doing is beyond acceptable and it must stop. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She&#39;s four.  Her life got worse,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, she&#39;s only four, that&#39;s a baby.  At four mom (or dad as mom is pg) <br/>
can pick up Drue and take her to the other room physically.  When Drue <br/>
is hitting an adult can pick her up and hold her lovingly but firmly and <br/>
say &#39;we don&#39;t hit in this house, period.&quot; repeating that until Drue is <br/>
under control.  And when Drue is not hitting they can reinforce that <br/>
behavior as well, and spend lots of time with her, giving her time to <br/>
vent her emotions and concerns.  Play therapy could really help this <br/>
child get past this difficult time in her life. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and she was marginalized.  She&#39;s about to be<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, her feelings and needs are not crap.  However, her reaction to that <br/>
might be considered that.  Again, not the word I would use, but <br/>
regardless of the word, the behavior is not acceptable!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Drue doesn&#39;t get a choice in the decision for another family member, <br/>

&gt; She can get to help make whatever decisions her parents decide she can <br/>

&gt; their family. <br/>
&gt; (Not this family, but the families I&#39;m thinking of.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Regardless of how a decision was made to have another child or whether <br/>
Drue was part of it or not, is less important now than the fact that <br/>
Drue is in the situation and needs help dealing with it now.  Her <br/>
parents need help dealing with it.  The poor brother, who is the <br/>
punching bag, needs the hitting to stop, immediately.  And Drue needs <br/>
some help to recognize what she is feeling and for realizing that while <br/>
those feelings are OK, the hitting is Not. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669733773">I have a 6 yo and two 4yos (among others) so sibling rivalry comes up every<br/>
now and then.  Something that we have found useful is substituting, for lack<br/>
of a better word, one emotion for another.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  Sitting in a meeting with all the kids, I sense that Marsie is<br/>
getting restless, so rather than tense myself or speak to her about it.  I<br/>
smooth her hair, pull her lovingly to me, look smilingly into her eyes, give<br/>
her a quick kiss, hug her, whatever....But I do something that I know will<br/>
let her know that I love her and am thinking of her, that I am focused on<br/>
the goodness and wonder of her, not on what she is doing that is making me<br/>
nuts.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps just as your sister senses the tension start to mount between the<br/>
kids, she could try something like that with her dd.  My guess would be that<br/>
right now whenever the two kids are together mom is waiting for the next<br/>
shoe to fall and the kids feel the tension, reinforcing negative feelings<br/>
between them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461650020">Is it a new development or something that has been going on before the<br/>
mother shared that there was another baby on the way?<br/>
<br/>
I have four sons. Their current ages are 15, 13, 10 1/2 and 8. My 13 year<br/>
old used to be full of rage from about age 2 to four. Daily he would throw<br/>
things and nothing within 10 feet was safe! In his case, I think he was<br/>
mostly frustrated with his inability to express himself clearly or with his<br/>
body&#39;s inability to do what he wanted his body to do. He was developing<br/>
normally but his expectations were greater than his developmental level.<br/>
Anyway, everyone would have to run out of the room or risk getting hurt. I<br/>
would stay and grab all hard and breakables out of his reach. Grabbing him<br/>
and holding him lovingly did not work. It only made him angrier. My usual<br/>
strategy was just to wait it out as long as everyone was safe. After about a<br/>
year of this, I tried something different. I waited until he finished<br/>
throwing and then turned to him and said, &quot;I am angry and mad&quot;. I stamped on<br/>
the floor and acted slightly angry. His eyes were wide open with surprise<br/>
because &quot;mommy&quot; never behaved that way before. I turned to him at that point<br/>
and said, &quot;You know what I am going to do? When I am mad, I draw big black<br/>
lines&quot;. I grabbed paper and crayons and proceeded. He watched. This strategy<br/>
helped for a while to change how he expressed his anger because after that I<br/>
was able to grab a crayon and paper and give it to him when he had a<br/>
tantrum. I wanted to let him work through his anger in a way that our family<br/>
could handle. This helped for a while. When he was between 3 and 4, he still<br/>
had temper tantrums but stopped throwing objects. One day, I cried with him.<br/>
When I had his attention, I was straight with him. I told him that when he<br/>
was in emotional pain, I was too because I had no idea how to help him. I<br/>
asked him if he could tell me how to him when he are not happy? He actually<br/>
calmed himself down to answer me. That was the turning point for him (as<br/>
well as for me). I knew then he had reached the level of maturity to control<br/>
his anger. He did share strategies that he wanted me to use to comfort him.<br/>
Rarely did he have tantrums after that.<br/>
<br/>
I hope my approaches will give your sister ideas to consider that may work<br/>
with your niece. In my opinion, the first and important thing your daughter<br/>
needs to learn is a more appropriate way of dealing with her anger. She<br/>
needs to know that her feelings are ok but not the manner she is expressing<br/>
it. She needs to know that her mother wants to be there for her, love her,<br/>
and guide her. When children are angry, it scares them because they feel<br/>
this anger take control and that is scary. They sometimes need help and<br/>
guidance so that they learn how to manage those feelings so that they are<br/>
still in control of their mind and bodies.<br/>
<br/>
That is my two cents. Hope it generates ideas for your sister and their<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
FYI- I am new to this board but not new to unschooling. Been doing it since<br/>
my first child was born.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-474922543">Just chiming in on this post. I am currently going through some <br/>
sibling squabbles right now (my 1 yr old and 1 yr old)...not so <br/>
physical, but I do remember my mom trying out the boppy thing with <br/>
my brother. He had become so angry with my dad when my parents <br/>
separated and he was never even prone toward physical aggression; he <br/>
was told that if he was angry he could just hit his Chewbacca <br/>
stuffed toy. So he would lay into that thing and he would really <br/>
feel relief. I used to scream into a pillow myself. Maybe they could <br/>
give this 4 yr old an object to .... well &quot;release&quot; into. I also <br/>
think that this 4 yr old needs some quality time with each parent to <br/>
know her *worth* (for lack of better words). She must be getting ALL <br/>
kinds of attention through all of the corrections she receives. <br/>
Maybe some positive and delightful company with a parent who just <br/>
listens to her would be soothing to her soul?<br/>

Won&#39;t it be interesting for your 11 yr old to say, &quot;Hey, Mom...*you* do<br/>
this.  And this.  And this!!!  You&#39;re going to ruuuiiiiinnn us!!!!!&quot;  He/she<br/>
will either be joshin&#39; you or helping you to become a better mom.  Or maybe<br/>
s/he&#39;ll say, &quot;Gee, Mom...you&#39;re great.  You don&#39;t do any of that stuff to<br/>
us.  Thanks!&quot;  (followed by a big smooch, if you&#39;re lucky!<br/>
<br/>
And think of the ways this book can enlighten a child in his dealings with<br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s cool!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I may be way off base, but the older child may be blaming herself for some of <br/>
her mom&#39;s limitations and illness during pregnancy.  I broke my ankle last <br/>
year and even though my then four year old son was no where near me, he <br/>
convinced himself that he had pushed me down the stairs.  He had a LOT of anger about <br/>
it.  Lashed out at his sister, his friends, everyone.  It took me a week to <br/>
realize he was blaming himself and much longer than that to make him know he <br/>
hadn&#39;t done anything wrong.  We kept talking, kept telling the story of how it <br/>
happened and how he was watching Angelina Ballerina at the time and how he was <br/>
in no way to blame for it.  Last night, just to check, I asked him if he <br/>
remembered how I broke my ankle and he remembered it right.  Your sister&#39;s older <br/>
child may be blaming herself for her mom&#39;s condition.<br/>
