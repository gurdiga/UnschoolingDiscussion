In both and all directions on this &quot;extreme&quot; thread. Respect for how families <br/>
approach these deeply personal subjects, it seems to me, would be an <br/>
important part of unschooling. Acknowledging that not every family will do it like <br/>
yours. Some of us are not religious at all, some are, some have had good life <br/>
experiences, some deeply traumatic -- all of these things and more inform how we <br/>
unschool and live. But we probably all get that. :)<br/>
