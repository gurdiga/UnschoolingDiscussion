&lt;&lt; Drink more clean water and REST. Pain makes REST<br/>
 diffficult.<br/>
 Did you have steroids at the time of the pain meds,<br/>
 too? They can muck up you complexion (and other<br/>
 things, too). And can take a LONG time to get your<br/>
 system back in balance. <br/>
 <br/>
 Still, sleep is when your body repairs itself.<br/>

    I thought about more water yesterday actually. I have tired looking <br/>
eyes.NOw sleep is a problem for sure. Pain wise it is difficult most nights. <br/>
Also I am awoken by a child everynight and the cat and dog demands. I get so <br/>
sick of it. When we have an upstairs downstairs I&#39;d like to leave the pets <br/>
down for the night. Or I am up from worry. I worry alot(runs in the family it <br/>
seems),I have been like this since I can remember. Things always appear worse <br/>
in the dark. :o)  I also hear every noise. Once I heard a mouse scamper under <br/>
the bed. No lie, the trap got him the next few min.. Dh was amazed.<br/>
<br/>
    I saw an ad for a prescrip sleep aid last night and it looked appealing. <br/>
LOL Too bad I am totally against prescrip. drugs eh? LOL<br/>
<br/>
    I do believe more water and less mocha drinking will help.<br/>

&lt;&lt; That is a symptom of a heavy drinker. When you drink a lot frequently, you<br/>
 don&#39;t get as drunk, almost like building an immunity. The alcohol is still<br/>
 in your bloodstream, but the outward signs are not as noticeable. Kinda<br/>
 scary for that baby. If I have more than one glass I get tipsy.<br/>

much also b/c I watched it all my life. I had one glass of wine while they <br/>
were here for 6 days. I can&#39;t even think of having another yet. I am so <br/>
turned off I feel bad having a glass now. I know it doesn&#39;t make sense but I <br/>
do not understand adults drinking so much. Maybe it is my family full of <br/>
alcoholics coloring my feelings here.<br/>

Water really will help.  It takes a while to get into the habit of<br/>
drinking that much.  I have suffered from joint pain which is now almost<br/>
completely controlled when I drink enough water.  It also does wonders<br/>
for your skin.  I fill up water bottles, the required amount, and drink<br/>
them all day long.  <br/>
Adding a zinc supplement to your diet a few days a week helps your skin<br/>
too.  It&#39;s especially good for acne.  <br/>
I have used kava kava for sleeplessness with great success.  Check for<br/>
drug interactions if you&#39;re taking prescriptions.  <br/>
Have you tried ear plugs at night?  Some people can&#39;t stand them.  Might<br/>
not be an option if there is no one else to get up with baby,  or if baby<br/>
is too little still to come to you. <br/>
We used a noise machine when my husband needed to sleep during the<br/>
daytime.  It creates a fuzzy, soft kind of sound which muffles outside<br/>
noise.  It really worked.  <br/>
A fan would work too but sometimes it&#39;s too cold for a fan.<br/>
I also use St. John&#39;s wort.  I have heard some people can&#39;t take it, but<br/>
it really works for me.  I had trouble with worry while taking care of an<br/>
ill family member.  St. John&#39;s wort with kava kava has been a huge help. <br/>
<br/>
Calcium can sometimes help with pain, and aid in sleep.  If you wanted to<br/>
start simply you could try this.  ( with lots of water!)<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can find some relief.  Maybe you would consider a visit to a<br/>
naturopath?  There may also be acupuncture or acupressure treatments that<br/>
can help.  <br/>
Hang in there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I can relate to that! :-) But also at &#39;that time&#39; I am on the prowl for <br/>
chocolate, lol.<br/>
My best remedies have been eliminating dietary yucks and lots and lots of <br/>
water. I know lots of different people have views on acne, diet, stress, <br/>
condition, etc. I think for me it&#39;s different things at different times. <br/>
Stress also kicks it off.<br/>
<br/>
There was a time where I was breastfeeding, vegan, drinking tons of water, <br/>
doing yoga almost daily and getting massage once a week (I was in school for <br/>
it, it was free :-)). During that period I had no skin problems whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d share...good luck!<br/>
