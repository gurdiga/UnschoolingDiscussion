&lt;&lt; What I seem to have seen is that any disrespect of children, woman or <br/>
minorities<br/>
is more open for whatever reasons in the south compared to the north &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems that would mean they think it&#39;s acceptable to most people, wouldn&#39;t <br/>
it?<br/>
Where and in what circumstances are children most openly spanked?  In my <br/>
experience, sadly, church and at family gatherings of extended spanking families.<br/>
<br/>
When I was really little, in Texas, in the 50&#39;s, Rastus and Liza jokes were <br/>
common.  They were along the lines of two-character moron jokes.  The effect, <br/>
though, was to create prejudice and an image of African Americans as, well, <br/>
morons.   I moved to Northern New Mexico, a WHOLE different culture, and never <br/>
heard another one.  <br/>
<br/>
In the late 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s, anti-female jokes were common.  Nasty jokes <br/>
about rape and about stupidity.  Not like blonde jokes, but worse.   The <br/>
women&#39;s movement made people less likely to tell or laugh at those jokes.  It empo<br/>
wered women to say &quot;That&#39;s not funny,&quot; and &quot;That attitude is sexist and <br/>
ignorant.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The next wave to which people rarely object is anti-child humor.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that none of those jokes are funny.  One can&#39;t help laughing <br/>
sometimes at a surprising ending or a ridiculous situation, and the laughing <br/>
itself can be forgiven, but I do think if there is to be cultural change, it&#39;s <br/>
worth pointing out to our friends, our parents, our children, that humor that <br/>
undermines a class of people, and humor to which others are afraid to object <br/>
(or to which they never considered objecting) perpetuates problems we could <br/>
benefit from dumping.<br/>
<br/>
I was on someone&#39;s humor list, and once received a set of anti-child jokes <br/>
that really offended me.  I responded to the list and said something along the <br/>
lines of what&#39;s above (but very short version), and got three hateful e-mails <br/>
and lost my friendship.   I don&#39;t care.  The people on that list were almost <br/>
all teachers in the public schools, in Salt Lake City.   Some of them I know to <br/>
be childless.  My friend adopted three Russian sisters who were already <br/>
schoolage (and they&#39;re BIGTIME in school, in which she is fully invested).  I liked <br/>
that friendship a great deal at one time, but I like my children&#39;s future much <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
On a New Mexico list for homeschoolers I created and maintained for years, <br/>
someone put up a quote from e-Bay (? great source of quotes?) that said raising <br/>
a teenager was like nailing jello to a tree.   I objected to it, lightly, said <br/>
I wasn&#39;t having problems with my unschooled teens, and was hooted down by <br/>
some people insulting me and unschooling.   The upshot was I gave the list to <br/>
someone with thicker skin and newer energy, and I quit the whole list.  If on a <br/>
homeschooling list it&#39;s to be fine to insult those whole people to whom we have <br/>
supposedly dedicated our lives, there are problems with homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe it&#39;s just a problem with the image of children in this culture.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s like hazing.  Whatever psychology make fraternities, military <br/>
training facilities, high school football teams, etc., WANT to torment the new <br/>
recruits is what makes adults torment children.  They were tormented and their <br/>
solace was that someday they would be the tormentors.   How does it stop?  <br/>
People die.  Football players and fraternity members and recruits die.  And <br/>
children die when parents believe that they have the right to &quot;discipline&quot; them or <br/>
torment them, and when they think that other adults around them will not <br/>
object.<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. has not and will not ratify the United Nation&#39;s Right of the Child <br/>
resolution.<br/>
The first version of that (as far as I know) was 1924.<br/>
There was another in 1959.<br/>
The one that all member nations were asked to sign off on was 1989.  <br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t new stuff.<br/>
Here&#39;s something I found, and here&#39;s a quote from that.  Not the same, but <br/>
same principles, and the U.S. has not signed the binding treaty.  Last I knew, <br/>
two nations had not signed.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-This document is a non-binding resolution of the United Nations General <br/>
Assembly. It should not be confused with the International Convention on the <br/>
Rights of the Child which was adopted by the UN General Assembly on the thirtieth <br/>
anniversary of this document, 20 November 1989. That document is a binding <br/>
treaty to which 176 nations have become &quot;states parties&quot;.]<br/>

<br/>
You can probably guess which element of U.S. political culture I have <br/>
heard/read complain most bitterly about that resolution violating THEIR rights.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve added that to my just building page on not-funny humor, which will no <br/>
doubt grow and change.  I will add that set of jokes I was sent by the teachers&#39; <br/>
list when I find it. <br/>
