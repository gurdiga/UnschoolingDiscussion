&gt; HI I thought I might ask you all if you know of any good on line AP<br/>
support groups.  Years ago I was on Alterna Moms Unite but their forum seems<br/>
to be gone.  Mango Mamas gone too and I would like to find an online hangout<br/>
for myself somewhere to regroup so to speak.  That link to the edgy-catin<br/>
mamas looked promising for about four or five minutes till I read about how<br/>
pinning your kid down to brush there teeth was recommended.  Anyway thanks<br/>
for your time<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132783823">Many AMUers moved to YAAPS (www.yaaps.com).  The feeling at Yaaps, though, is definitely more accepting of a wider variety of parenting than AMU or MM was.   Another place with a lot of AMUers is www.motherspirit.net.  Motherspirit has several public forums, but more private ones - I don&#39;t post there so I&#39;m not sure what the overall tone is. <br/>

There&#39;s a Continuum Concept site/forum.  Maybe their list?<br/>
Maybe check the La Leche League site for their recommendations?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-66035572">Teresa, you might want to try www.amitymama.com They have a huge forum<br/>
about anything under the sun and all AP. Also another REALLY good list I<br/>
have been on for a while is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:healthyparenting@yahoogroups.com">healthyparenting@yahoogroups.com</a> - they are<br/>
very AP and very health oriented. I find it a great source of education<br/>
about everything. And the ladies are all very nice. <br/>

It was one thread and I could have clicked around more but I came to that and it was seconded by a moderator so I said poo poo and moved on.<br/>
