<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055644796">I live in Ontario, Canada (where we don&#39;t have to report to anyone) <br/>
and have a 13yos who is very bright and it seems every time I buy a <br/>
science book for him it is so boring. In the past 5 years we haven&#39;t <br/>
exactly unschooled totally, but for science he just explored his <br/>
interests. This year for grade 9 we bought Apologia Biology. He is <br/>
really having a struggle with it. He is an excellent reader, but is <br/>
having a hard time remembering what the definitions mean and what <br/>
things like an autotroph, etc. is.<br/>
<br/>
Can he explore his interests in high school as well as public school? <br/>
The only thing I am worried about for him is math and that he can <br/>
spell and write properly. I really don&#39;t care about the rest. Is this <br/>
the wrong attitude?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help you can give to me.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Mine struggled with it too. It IS boring for the ones not interested. <br/>
My oldest, now, just reads (rather, devours) Popular Science and <br/>
Discovery magazines every month. Amazingly, he knows a ton <br/>
about science that I have never thought he&#39;d retain.<br/>
<br/>
I had to let go of my feeling that he must learn science in a <br/>
traditional manner. The hardest part has been thinking through <br/>
college admissions. We have discussed this a lot. He decided <br/>
to study biology in a co-op class (to do the dissections) but isn&#39;t <br/>
interested at all in chemistry and is on pins and needles to study <br/>
physics once his math is up to par.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (13, almost 14) is at this same point in her <br/>
dilemma. She isn&#39;t interested in science at all. So does she have <br/>
to do it? We&#39;re exploring the possiblities/options and I&#39;ll follow <br/>
her lead. If she decides not to do any science in high school, <br/>
then she&#39;ll make that choice and face whatever she needs to for <br/>
college.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What About College?&quot; by Cafi Cohen helped me relax A LOT <br/>
about admissions requirements. You might want to pick that up.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My kids are doing a combo. They like the social aspects of public <br/>
school and some of the electives. But they aren&#39;t doing any &quot;core&quot; <br/>
classes there. So they have the option of going part time here in <br/>
Ohio. And they do pursue their interests at home in all the other <br/>
time they have. Works well for us.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; spell and write properly. I really don&#39;t care about the rest. Is this <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think we all worry and each one of us worries about different <br/>
things. I&#39;ve spent far too many precious hours of my life worrying <br/>
about math. I worried when I took math and now I worry for my <br/>
older kids. My dh said the other night, &quot;Give it up.&quot; He was so <br/>
right. I went to my son (16) and told him that I&#39;m done riding him <br/>
about math. He can take it or not, get any grade, he can have <br/>
tutoring that I&#39;ll pay for if he needs it, but I will no longer hover <br/>
over him. He was relieved. The truth is, he wants to go into <br/>
computer science. If this field really does appeal to him, the <br/>
pressure of success in that industry may depend on his math. <br/>
When he comes to that core conclusion, he&#39;ll get the math.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve let it go.<br/>
<br/>
Writing? I teach writing online to homeschooling families. The <br/>
main thing I can say is this. Kids whose mothers worry about <br/>
their kids writing tend to produce kids who either hate to write or <br/>
lifeless, stiff writers. Mothers who back off, spend tons of time <br/>
talking with their children, read lots of good literature and where <br/>
writing that is produced is enjoyed and read tend to produce <br/>
better writers.<br/>
<br/>
The keys for writing are simple: writing is about communicating <br/>
effectively in written language. That comes from relaxed, <br/>
non-pressured opportunities to write (email, IMing, sending <br/>
notes to friends, song lyrics, poems, short stories...) that kids <br/>
initiate. Kids who are comfortable expressing themselves in <br/>
written language (no matter how poor the quality of actual <br/>
writing) will be able to be taught writing forms at the time they <br/>
need them (high school or college). When they see that they are <br/>
ready to learn, teaching them is easy.<br/>
<br/>
here&#39;s a link to my website for some articles that may help you to <br/>
breathe and let go of that anxiety:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hope this has been helpful. I really understand how you feel. I&#39;ve <br/>
only converted to unschooling fully in the last eight months. It&#39;s a <br/>
big switch and it&#39;s easy to let other homeschooling families <br/>
undermine your confidence when you listen to them rattle off all <br/>
the requirements they think their kids need.<br/>
<br/>
Turn a deaf ear and look at your child. Who is he? What is he <br/>
learning? Celebrate that and college will sort itself out.<br/>
