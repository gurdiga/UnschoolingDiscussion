Friends of ours were cooking for 150 or so once, and they were making a cream <br/>
soup or something.  I wasn&#39;t the cook, I was in the kitchen early playing <br/>
music for them.  I needed to practice recorder anyway, and the people in the <br/>
dorms at the camp where we were for the weekend were all alseep.<br/>
<br/>
So I was there when they were opening half-pint after half-pint carton of <br/>
cream, and a couple had been poured in and someone else was still opening the <br/>
sixteen or twenty so little cartons they had there.  A friend of ours who had <br/>
done dinner the night before and was not on kitchen duty, but who happens to <br/>
be a trained-in-New-Orleans real live chef, passed through the kitchen on a <br/>
shortcut.  (It was an SCA event; he was partially in armor, so it was damned <br/>
picturesque. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?&quot; he said with as much control as he could muster.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation came, but he said &quot;Show me the recipe!&quot;  and the milk wasn&#39;t <br/>
the only thing he talked them into adjusting.  He was explaining the <br/>
processes and the purpose of the milk, and the differences in the distance <br/>
from the heat and the mass of the other ingredients and size and shape of <br/>
pan.  It mostly went right over my head (and theirs too), but I was impressed <br/>
with his knowledge, and the complexity of it, and that you can&#39;t just <br/>
multiply some recipes by ten or fifteen or whatever and have it work right!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763331415">Large quantity is indeed chemistry and frequently biology to the<br/>
discomfort of those poisoned, LOL.  Even more quantity cooking is<br/>
all about physics and BTU transfer.  When we cook for several<br/>
hundred, I get a chance to challenge understandings about radiant<br/>
heat, density and so forth.  And pectin is great stuff for making<br/>
fruit rollups, colloidal suspensions and examples of the magic<br/>
point of phase change, which is why you can&#39;t even double a jelly<br/>
recipe confidently.<br/>
<br/>
You are all set to enjoy &quot;How to Read a French Fry.&quot;<br/>
