<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241534007">&lt;&lt;and since we cook our granola it doesn&#39;t matter...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you make granola and not cook it?  Seems like it would leave a goopy<br/>
mess but perhaps not.<br/>
<br/>
I have found over the last couple of weeks that I feel much better with no<br/>
cooked foods.  (Right now,  I am eating baby carrots and raw trail mix).<br/>
Would love to be able to fit in granola.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I doubt you could not cook granola. But, it isn&#39;t like homemade granola is <br/>
hugely processed. Buy your honey from a local beekeeper and/or orchard, like <br/>
we do, buy your oats from a health-food store, get your eggs from someone who <br/>
has chickens... What does your trail mix have in it? Is there absolutely <br/>
nothing cooked? And I wonder are you more concerned with cooked foods, or <br/>
processed foods? <br/>
