We bought KONOS once many moons ago....it&#39;s exactly as Joyce said...a HUGE <br/>
amount of work for the parent, especially, trying to track down and buy things <br/>
for the unit studies.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907827421">Sonya,<br/>
 <br/>
Here is the link for the curriculum Konos  www.konos.com.   When we first started homeschooling a number of years ago I was persuaded to join a Konos co-op by some homeschooling friends. I didn&#39;t know any unschoolers or relaxed homeschoolers at the time in my area.  I probably have the books in a box in my storage shed some place.   <br/>
 <br/>
This is my personal experience with Konos---it is all about the parent&#39;s education.  The parents spend hours and hours going to the library looking up books (instead of kids looking up books or browsing for things they are interested in), collecting materials, planning lessons, and teaching lessons.  Whew.  Konos consumed MY life.<br/>
Sure, my kids had fun doing some of the activities. They will tell you that they have some nice memories, but would never do it again because it was all parent-driven and too conservative.  <br/>
 <br/>
Konos was too conservative for us...the curriculum tended emphasize a very conservative Christian viewpoint.  Thus, it attracts very conservative people.  I guess someone could use Konos and omit those parts, but that isn&#39;t how it played out in our co-op.<br/>
 <br/>
Our family doesn&#39;t fit into that conservative Christian mold, so I had to discussion some things as soon as we got in the car to go home...eg. the earth was created in 6 literal days and was no more than 10,000 years old.  The final straw for me was (this wasn&#39;t in the curriculum, but just the interpretation of the woman who led the WWII unit) when the mom taught the kids that the Holocaust really didn&#39;t happen...or if it did happen, then it was greatly exaggerated.  I was speechless. I had never met anyone personally who thought the concentration camps were a sham.  <br/>
 <br/>
I said something to the &quot;teacher&quot;...I just couldn&#39;t be quiet. But the woman just dismissed me as someone who was brainwashed by the public school system.  She said, &quot;And I suppose you think the Civil War was connected to slavery, too?&quot;  I could see there was no point in discussing this further with this woman. There was no room in our co-op for opposing viewpoints.  I later found out that she was in the Daughters of the Confederacy and a Christian white supremacist group.  <br/>
 <br/>
As soon as my kids and I were in our car, I immediately told them that I had a very strong difference of opinion on this one and that I didn&#39;t think we should continue with the co-op.  I said I wanted my kids to talk to some friends at Quaker meeting who did have first hand knowledge of WW II and Nazi Germany.  My kids were getting a little tired of the conservatism, lack of freedom for kids to express their opinion, etc. so they agreed that we should stop our involvement.  <br/>
 <br/>
I see the Konos moms every now and then, and they usually say something about how wonderful Konos is.  They believe Konos is the only way to homeschool.  The revisionist mom is very cool toward me. She probably still refers to me as the brainwashed mom. LOL.<br/>
 <br/>
I probably got burned out sooner than some because the moms in my co-op always wanted me to teach science units.  It was a lot of work just hauling microscopes and other science stuff from my lab to the car to my home back to the car to the coop back to my home and back to the lab. They brought Debbie cakes and Kool-Aid as their job. I might have lasted longer if that is all that I had to do. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Also, because it was parent-driven, I had to deal with kids who didn&#39;t really care at all about the science topics we were covering, even though we did some fun activities.  The kids always wanted to be entertained because that is what Konos was about in our coop.  The Moms were the entertainment.<br/>
 <br/>
I had planned what I thought was a really cool activity with marbles and ramps to teach physics.  My son was into physics at the time.  The kids didn&#39;t want to build ramps and didn&#39;t want to talk about physics.  The activity ended with kids of all ages throwing marbles around the room.  I think the kids had a lot of fun with those marbles, but I could have saved myself a lot of time and just brought a big bag of marbles! <br/>
 <br/>
There may be a way an unschooling kid could use Konos as an idea book, but we didn&#39;t find it useful. <br/>

I have it and will try to look for it and give you an address.  BUT!  this is <br/>
VERY &quot;school at home&quot; lots of work, very expensive.  you will spend hours, <br/>
weeks, days in preparation,  NOT unschooling AT ALL.  If you still are <br/>
interested, I will be happy to try to dig it up for you, but I promise,  this is what <br/>
we started with 7 years ago, and it is NOT Unschool<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300411890">Woah, Dee, what a terrible experience! I never had an opportunity to<br/>
get with other KONOS families, and just bought the first book and<br/>
picked and chose from it, whenever I needed an idea for something to<br/>
make my kids study.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
We did the medieval feast with a little homeschooler support group, in<br/>
our first year of homeschooling, and also used the ideas in the Five<br/>
Senses units...we actually disected pig eyeballs, which was MUCH more<br/>
nauseous than you can imagine! ewwww...blch...<br/>
<br/>
I still have that old KONOS book on my shelf of homeschool resources,<br/>
and haul it out once in awhile, because I consider it a<br/>
resource...booklists, music, other tie-ins. I never even tried to<br/>
follow it 100%,...NO WAY, not even when I was in my most schooly mode. <br/>
<br/>
If you follow it, it isn&#39;t unschooly, but if you pick and choose, or<br/>
if the kids find something in there that they want to do...it could be<br/>
part of an unschooly home library.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC <br/>

<br/>
This is my identical experience too. In fact, I was a part of a <br/>
KONOS group for five years. We thoroughly enjoyed the activites <br/>
and field trips etc. But my kids didn&#39;t retain almost any of the <br/>
details the way they do now that they are learning according to <br/>
*thier* interests and not a predetermined unit chosen by me.<br/>
<br/>

What does anyone have to gain believing the Holocaust didn&#39;t <br/>
happen? How does a conservative fall into that view more easily <br/>
than liberals?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling a bit nauseous considering it.<br/>
<br/>
This reminded me of a conversation i had with a mom who told <br/>
me &quot;I&#39;m not prejudiced or anything, I just don&#39;t want my children <br/>
making friends with other races because we don&#39;t believe in <br/>
inter-marriage.&quot; I had never heard anyone say this outloud before <br/>
and I was stunned into silence.<br/>

called &quot;Raising a Generation of Christian Statesmen&quot; (and, I would <br/>
take notes! Probably would be tempted by, but wouldn&#39;t buy, the books <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059308994">Konos was too conservative for us...the curriculum tended emphasize a very conservative Christian viewpoint.  Thus, it attracts very conservative people.  I guess someone could use Konos and omit those parts, but that isn&#39;t how it played out in our co-op.<br/>
<br/>
  Our family doesn&#39;t fit into that conservative Christian mold, so I had to discussion some things as soon as we got in the car to go home...eg. the earth was created in 6 literal days and was no more than 10,000 years old.  The final straw for me was (this wasn&#39;t in the curriculum, but just the interpretation of the woman who led the WWII unit) when the mom taught the kids that the Holocaust really didn&#39;t happen...or if it did happen, then it was greatly exaggerated.  I was speechless. I had never met anyone personally who thought the concentration camps were a sham.  <br/>
<br/>
  I said something to the &quot;teacher&quot;...I just couldn&#39;t be quiet. But the woman just dismissed me as someone who was brainwashed by the public school system.  She said, &quot;And I suppose you think the Civil War was connected to slavery, too?&quot;  I could see there was no point in discussing this further with this woman. There was no room in our co-op for opposing viewpoints.  I later found out that she was in the Daughters of the Confederacy and a Christian white supremacist group.  <br/>
<br/>
  As soon as my kids and I were in our car, I immediately told them that I had a very strong difference of opinion on this one and that I didn&#39;t think we should continue with the co-op.  I said I wanted my kids to talk to some friends at Quaker meeting who did have first hand knowledge of WW II and Nazi Germany.  My kids were getting a little tired of the conservatism, lack of freedom for kids to express their opinion, etc. so they agreed that we should stop our involvement.  <br/>

  I know I&#39;m chiming in late on this.  What a horrible experience you had!  I want to comment because I would describe myself as a conservative Christina - independent, fundamental.  I&#39;m sure that conjures up all sorts of things in your mind based upon your experiences with other conservative Christians.  My core faith has remained constant over the years, but I am very much an unschooler, too, with a respect for the child as an individual.  I find TCS, attachment parenting, and unschooling consistent with biblical teaching and God&#39;s grace and love - it is more biblical in my belief than the strict misinterpretations about child rearing that I observe in some fellow believers.  My children have noticed that they often receive less respectful treatment from both children and adults of similar faith.  We spend a lot of time de-briefing as well.  My children have a more relaxed, less competitive, less arugmentative time when playing with children in an eclectic group.  This saddens them and me (not that they have a good time, but that they don&#39;t have that same experience in a faith-based group :).)<br/>
<br/>
  While I have heard of people who do not believe in the holocost, I never imagined such an individual could be found in a homeschooling group teaching young children.  How disheartening!<br/>
<br/>
  I want to thank you and others on the list who consistently show grace and acceptance to those of different faith.  As you and others have observed, this is sadly not common in individuals of my faith.<br/>

<br/>
Labels count.  I&#39;m sure a wide variety of people on this list ended up<br/>
taking their kids out of school because of the way their kids were<br/>
labeled.  That can be a positive result of labelling--but I don&#39;t think<br/>
there&#39;s many positive results.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s not the benefit of considering ourselves radical unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
If I tell other homeschoolers early on that I&#39;m an unschooler, it spares me a <br/>
lot of wasted conversation and confusion.  They won&#39;t bother asking me <br/>
whether I use ABeka or Bob Jones, for one big thing.   And IF there is someone in <br/>
that conversation who has been wondering about unschooling and hears me say <br/>
that, she will come ask me for more information.  It has happened.<br/>

<br/>
Or haven&#39;t been able to talk to unschoolers because they&#39;re attending a Bob <br/>

<br/>
If unschoolers in disguise attend Christian conferences, then they&#39;re not <br/>
even nearly the people we&#39;re talking about.<br/>
