<div id="ygrps-yiv-624349848">I was wondering if anyone else had the problem of sending something on <br/>
the listserv here and not seeing it come around?<br/>
<br/>
I send 3 posts and only 2 show up.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if its how I&#39;ve configured my mail server or something to do <br/>
with Yahoo Groups. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Insight anyone?<br/>

Watch out though, in a day or so you&#39;ll get them all!   Sorry, I don&#39;t<br/>

twice.  Did you resend?  I&#39;ve had it explained to me why this stuff <br/>
happens, but it doesn&#39;t seem to stick in my head.  At any rate, it happens <br/>
on every list I&#39;ve been on.  People get answers before the <br/>
originals.  Stuff doesn&#39;t show up, sometimes for a long time, then suddenly <br/>
appears.  It&#39;s the way of the internet.<br/>

that resends posts in a certain amount of time if it doesn&#39;t show up. <br/>
Sorry for the repeats, it been working for me for years.<br/>

Thanks all</div>
