Actually I was thinking of putting him in school so i could do my <br/>
training (which has to be during the day).  If i worked nights i <br/>
wouldn&#39;t need him in school that is why i will be doing nights <br/>
because I still want to have him home.. It&#39;s the training period <br/>
thats the problem. I would not have to find someone for him if he <br/>
was in school I have to find someone for him if he doesn&#39;t go to <br/>
school. I explained to him we could do the school tempoarily and <br/>
then I could pull him out the following year ???? Has anyone had a <br/>
similar experience ???????<br/>

If you really need to do this training, and he&#39;s willing to go to school, it<br/>
could work, but I&#39;m wondering why would you wait to pull him out next year?<br/>
Couldn&#39;t he just go to school for 10 weeks?<br/>

I don&#39;t know what the regulations in Mass. are, but here in Ohio you can<br/>
notify of your intent to homeschool and take your child out of school at any<br/>
time.  When two of mine wanted to &quot;try&quot; school to see what it was like, my<br/>
plan was to enroll them, let them go for a week (the amount of time they<br/>
were interested in trying), then just re-notify and bring them home again.<br/>
(They lost interest before we actually got around to doing it.)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about what to say to the school system, what you do is really<br/>
none of their business!  If they ask you could just tell them that you are<br/>
using them for free daycare.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the private school.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The thing is, you have less of a choice in school than in choosing a <br/>
daycare provider. It hit me the other day, how much emphasis is put <br/>
on &quot;finding a quality daycare provider&quot; for people who choose that, <br/>
on running background checks, making sure the home is safe, making <br/>
sure the parenting beliefs mesh well with yours....and then we (that <br/>
is, the culture at large)go and put our kids in school at age five <br/>
without checking anything out. <br/>
<br/>
When my son was in a home daycare at age 3, since i was paying this <br/>
lady, i basically had the final say in how she treated my son (feed <br/>
him this, don&#39;t spank him, etcetc)...but when he was in kindergarten <br/>
and first grade the pressure was on to go with the flow. And i am one <br/>
to rebel against authority simply because it IS an authority. Little <br/>
things would bug the heck out of me, like how they wouldnt let me pay <br/>
in advance for his lunch, he had to carry 40 cents with him everyday, <br/>
and he would always lose it, then they would send notes home saying <br/>
we owed money for lunch. The personell always called me &quot;Mom&quot;(as in, <br/>
&quot;you know, *mom*, he&#39;s a big boy now and needs to learn to carry <br/>
money!&quot; grr)..i had to go out and buy him all new pants, with <br/>
pockets, so he could remember his money. And then he never had enough <br/>
time to eat anyway....<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure what the options are where you live, but you might also <br/>
look into a regular daycare center(usually go up to age five)to see <br/>
if they would accept your son for a limited time. But of course, <br/>
school would be free and thats a factor too.<br/>

it&#39;s best to see it as a resource to help people get to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds unfriendly but with a list this big and busy, the less stuff<br/>
that&#39;s counter to unschooling the better. Just as if it were a busy<br/>
vegetarian list the fewer questions from vegetarians on how to temporarily<br/>
incorporate some meat the better.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry your son might end up in school. But it doesn&#39;t help people let go<br/>
of a desire for reading programs to have information about reading programs<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
Questions like that might work better on the message boards at<br/>
Unschooling.com since people can more easily skip it if the topic doesn&#39;t<br/>
interest them.<br/>

<br/>
Right, and that&#39;s not an unschooling issue.<br/>
<br/>
Neither is which phonics curriculum to buy. <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers need to buy cars and sewing machines, and decide whether to use <br/>
hormone replacement therapy or not (some of them do; the guys don&#39;t &lt;g&gt;) and <br/>
about vaccinations for kids, but there are other lists and other sources, and <br/>
this can&#39;t be everything for everyone.  It can&#39;t even be all homeschooling <br/>
source for everyone.<br/>

Thanks for understanding (those who understand).<br/>
