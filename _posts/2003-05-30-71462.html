couple others by John Holt.  There is a lot by Mr. Farenga, but you can tell the <br/>
difference.  The original stuff is in bolder/different print, and at the <br/>
beginning of anything written by Mr. Farenga, there&#39;s a little curly-cue thing <br/>
marking it.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think his comments will be best for newbies...a lot of the <br/>
stuff Holt wrote was outdated (example: the political side of homeschooling across <br/>
the country being much more against homeschooling than it is now) and Farenga <br/>
just sort of brings it up to date.   I guess if someone didn&#39;t want to read <br/>
his slant on what Holt wrote, they could just skip anything he&#39;d written.  But <br/>
like I said, I believe his comments will &quot;put at ease&quot; people new to <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

 Sometimes I think Holt can be a little overwhelming for someone new to the <br/>

you thinking outside the box without seeming to be too pushy.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I read the new edition.  I liked it, because there&#39;s so much good John Holt<br/>
in there, and much of the editing that Pat Farenga did was helpful.  For<br/>
example, he basically re-wrote the chapter on legal issues, using as much as<br/>
he could from John Holt, but things have changed so much, and his new<br/>
chapter is more helpful than just John&#39;s old one would have been.  The books<br/>
does distinguish in lighter and darker print which person is writing at the<br/>
moment, which was important to me.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I still got a little bit of an uneasy feeling about his<br/>
comments on curriculum and getting started and all.  It&#39;s possible to read<br/>
into his comments that he and Day unschool.  It&#39;s possible to feel like they<br/>
use the word curriculum in the way the unschooling curriculum that Carol (?)<br/>
wrote (the one at Sandra&#39;s website) is used.  But it didn&#39;t feel quite right<br/>
to use it that way.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen publicity on the book, and I suspect it would just make me<br/>
angry if in fact he does refer to it as his book.  It&#39;s still very much<br/>
John&#39;s book, with some helpful additions and updating based on the<br/>
perspective of 20 years.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I saw that he referred to it as his book as well, I can&#39;t remember where.  But now that I have read the book, yes it feels very wrong that he does that.  It is John Holt&#39;s book with some practical updates from Farenga.  I thought the curriculum info. at the end was counter to what John Holt&#39;s books stress and wondered if Holt would have wanted that.  He seems to be trying to include all homeschooling communities.  I am going to lend it to my hschooling friends who are open to hearing about unschooling but I have also told them to come here for the real thing!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely!!  But I think there is still confusion out there on what unschooling is.<br/>
<br/>
I know someone who says she is unschooling now that they have completed the mom&#39;s annual goals.  They will &quot;unschool&quot; until fall.  Many others think unschooling except for math is really unschooling.  Or that kids are unschooling when they meet the parent&#39;s goals in the child&#39;s own learning style.<br/>
<br/>
Either the Farengas don&#39;t really understand unschooling, or....?<br/>

involved and unless you know farenga personally to know why she does what<br/>
she does - it&#39;s impossible to say that she is or isn&#39;t doing the right thing<br/>
for her family...... and yes unschooling means different things to different<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
I guess also feeling judged lately myself (and I&#39;m pregnant) which makes me<br/>
a little sensitive.  Last week at my neighbor hood pool, one of the ladies<br/>
asked why my 3.5 yr. old wasn&#39;t in pre-school.  I of course told her I was<br/>
going to home school and she responded in a loud voice saying - &quot;what, our<br/>
elementary school isn&#39;t good enough for you&quot; - wow!  the assumptions she<br/>
made with out knowing anything about me and my family.  Do these things<br/>
happen to everyone that home schools or do I just put myself in the wrong<br/>
social groups??<br/>
<br/>
Also..... 2 weeks ago, my neighbors child said to me &quot;my mom and dad say<br/>
your not very religious and it (god) isn&#39;t very important to you&quot; - seeing<br/>
as my neighbor is also my friend this was a yucky thing to hear.  I&#39;m a<br/>
Unitarian Univeralist and my neighbor is a Christian - for those who don&#39;t<br/>
know anything about UUism it&#39;s a religion for all we have Christians,<br/>
Jewish, etc.,etc. people in our congregation anyway.......<br/>

Or having your kids in school and only giving them as much freedom as the mom <br/>
is comfortable giving them is unschooling.<br/>

It seems that having one&#39;s husband do word processing for John Holt for a few <br/>

school and they are currently not unschooling the way they have/had in the past?<br/>
<br/>
Because someone no longer does something that made them an expert does that <br/>
mean then that they have nothing worth sharing?<br/>
<br/>
What about a magnificent doctor who had the best bedside manner and was very <br/>
skilled in saving lives, he stops tending to patients on a daily basis.  He <br/>
then gives talks about how OTHERS should do this.  Is his word not credible <br/>
since he is no longer being this wonderful doctor to patients everyday?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if he pretends at his &quot;talks&quot; that he is still treating patients daily <br/>
that could be taken as wrong. What if he&#39;s truthful and said this is HOW I <br/>
USED to do this and it worked wonderfully for me and others I&#39;ve shared this <br/>
information with in the past and it just might be helpful to you when you treat <br/>
patients today?<br/>
<br/>
I guess it&#39;s all in how your perceive the information for yourself.  Either <br/>
that he has useful information for you and your journey or he doesn&#39;t and leave <br/>
it at that.  Kinda like here I guess, take what you need/want and leave the <br/>
rest.<br/>

<br/>
Could be but chances are you would hear it from at least one person in your<br/>
journey. My MIL was very upset when she found out we were keeping our kids<br/>
home. She actually got mad because she couldn&#39;t understand how school was<br/>
good enough for everyone else in the family except our kids. No one had ever<br/>
mentioned school not being good enough. Those were her words. My SIL, who is<br/>
an office manager in the school system, when hearing us mention we wanted to<br/>
homeschool, first said how all the homeschooling kids she knew were very<br/>
sneaky. Then said it would probably be okay as long as we didn&#39;t keep them<br/>
in the house all the time!!!! I&#39;ve actually had nicer things said to me by<br/>
strangers than my in laws.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the religion thing goes, same with the family. They give us a much<br/>
harder time are definitely more judgemental than any strangers or friends.<br/>
We don&#39;t see them anymore. Just my MIL maybe once a week for about 20<br/>
minutes. The rest just aren&#39;t worth it for us or our kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-621829241">OK, I&#39;m a long-time lurker who&#39;s going to open my big mouth about <br/>
just this one thing, LOL! <br/>
<br/>
To those who are criticizing the Farengas because they are presenting <br/>
themselves as unschooling experts but not actually unschooling <br/>
themselves, would it also be fair then to say that John Holt himself <br/>
couldn&#39;t really be a true expert on children and/or unschooling, <br/>
since he never had any children of his own and thus never actually <br/>
unschooled any children of his own? Just as merely being around and <br/>
oberving Holt and publishing his GWS newletters and being the <br/>
president of Holt Associates etc. etc. isn&#39;t the same as actually <br/>
practicing unschooling yourself, couldn&#39;t it also be said that merely <br/>
being around and observing and teaching OTHER people&#39;s children isn&#39;t <br/>
the same as having and raising children of your OWN?<br/>
<br/>
[Let me right now emphasize the fact that I am a HUGE John Holt fan, <br/>
and my question should in no way be taken as a criticism of him or <br/>
his ideas...I&#39;m just trying to explore the line of logic that <br/>
dictates one must always have first-hand experience with something in <br/>
order to be considered credible on the subject.]<br/>
<br/>
I honestly don&#39;t know what exactly the Farengas are doing with their <br/>
own children except for the second-hand things that I&#39;ve heard on <br/>
this list--does somebody have some more specific details? Are you <br/>
guys saying that their kids are currently in public school and that <br/>
that it&#39;s NOT the kids&#39; choice to be there? If the charge being made <br/>
isn&#39;t merely that they Farengas don&#39;t have personal experience with <br/>
unschooling, but are deliberately doing things which blatantly go <br/>
against unschooling philosophy, then I suppose I WOULD be a little <br/>
skeptical about their credibility as true unschooling supporters...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  He represented himself as what he was - an educator. And, in fact, <br/>
there are, imo, big gaps in what John Holt wrote exactly because he <br/>
wrote as an educator and not a parent. It is what we fill in, on lists <br/>
like this, and what is filled in by us unschooling-parents who speak at <br/>
conferences. I wish John Holt had lived to see it - he started the <br/>
process with GWS which was entirely composed of parents&#39; descriptions <br/>
of their unschooling lives and by holding small meetings with parents <br/>
where he talked AND they talked. He knew that it was parents moving in <br/>
the directions he&#39;d pointed to who would really develop unschooling, <br/>
I&#39;m sure.  I think he&#39;d be thrilled at the organic nature of the <br/>
unschooling community and how individuals have stepped forward to offer <br/>
their ideas even beyond his and their experiences implementing his <br/>
ideas in their families. When I speak at conferences, I am aware of and <br/>
feel very much a part of a process that started with John Holt and GWS.<br/>
<br/>
John wrote about how kids learn math  but it was almost entirely <br/>
observation of kids in some kind of institutional learning situation. <br/>
He realized that that wasn&#39;t needed and talked about how kids could <br/>
just learn from their regular life activities and then tackle formal <br/>
math and learn it very quickly when they wanted to do so -- but he <br/>
really doesn&#39;t talk in enough detail about &quot;how&quot; that natural learning <br/>
happens or about what parents can do to support it or at all about what <br/>
parents who are, themselves, math phobic/anxious, can do to overcome <br/>
that. In other words - the practicalities of really BEING a <br/>
homeschooling parent were not what he wrote about.<br/>
<br/>
Pat&#39;s not an educator - he doesn&#39;t work with children other than his <br/>
own. He worked with John Holt and talked to him about his work a lot <br/>
and has read his work a lot and, I always thought, anyway - followed up <br/>
on that by unschooling his own children.<br/>
<br/>
If they aren&#39;t unschooling, I would be more interested in hearing about <br/>
why not than to hear him sort of speak in place of John Holt. He does, <br/>
imo, a darn GOOD job of speaking in place of John Holt, though. I think <br/>
Pat is a really enjoyable and inspiring speaker. I would feel a little <br/>
duped, though, to think he was part of talking me INTO unschooling but <br/>
wasn&#39;t convinced enough to unschool his own kids? Luckily, it couldn&#39;t <br/>
change my own mind about unschooling because the only thing that really <br/>
convinced me about unschooling was to do it and watch the kids and <br/>
promise myself never to interrupt what they were doing with &quot;imposed <br/>
lessons&quot; unless I was convinced that there was nothing at all of value <br/>
going on already. Well- there is ALWAYS something of value - and I saw <br/>
that more and more as I learned to recognize what was valuable.<br/>

it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; He is the current president of Holt Associates, as well as the literary<br/>
executive overseeing publications like the magazine Growing Without<br/>
Schooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Possibly the information about whether he is currently homeschooling is also<br/>
out of date.  I don&#39;t know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773814925">There is a huge difference between an educator with no children promoting unschooling and a parent claiming to unschool when perhaps he may not be.  <br/>
<br/>
John Holt did try some of his theories on actual children, even though they weren&#39;t his offspring.<br/>
<br/>
From the article linked below: &quot;Learning by doing is an effective method of teaching that many classrooms neglect,&quot; Farenga said. &quot;I knew a kid who couldn&#39;t do a simple math problem on the blackboard, but when he went bowling, he did much more difficult math while scoring games.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Funny, I seem to remember that story from one of Holt&#39;s books.  One of the students in a class he was teaching couldn&#39;t do the math.  Holt happened to go bowling and discovered that this kid kept score for a bowling league, before the days of automatic scorekeeping.  What a coincidence that Farenga also knew a child like that!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-851643442">What I&#39;m still not hearing is whether the children were put into <br/>
school against their will, or if they had a say in the matter and <br/>
went willingly. The way I understand it, if a child freely CHOOSES to <br/>
go to school, then that is still unschooling. I would go a degree <br/>
farther and also suggest that if parents and children have a family <br/>
meeting and mutually and respectfully arrive at the decision that <br/>
having the children enroll in school temporarily for whatever reason <br/>
(financial or otherwise) in a necessity, then that isn&#39;t something <br/>
which can so easily be criticized.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that in the absence of intimitate knowledge about the <br/>
Farengas&#39; private lives (specifically in regards to the central <br/>
question of how much input the children had in being sent to school), <br/>
the charges that the Farengas are somehow hypocrites and are not <br/>
practicing what they&#39;re preaching are just pure speculation on the <br/>
critics&#39; parts, based on anecdotal evidence and gossip. If I am wrong <br/>
about this and some of you are indeed basing your criticisms on <br/>
specific verifiable details and first-hand knowledge, I would again <br/>
be curious to hear that evidence. I certainly would be disappointed <br/>
to find out that they were indeed being hypocritical by supporting <br/>
unschooling publicly but blatantly going against it privately. As of <br/>
yet though, I haven&#39;t heard enough specifics to definitively come to <br/>
this conclusion. <br/>
<br/>
