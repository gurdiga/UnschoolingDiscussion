&lt;&lt; We had tooth decay on breastmilk. The biggest single factor for healthy<br/>
teeth is hereditary. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s been talk for over ten years now, following a study in Toronto, I <br/>
think, that it&#39;s a disease, bacterial, passed on from mother to child when <br/>
the children are very young.  So if a mother has had lots of cavities they <br/>
probably have that bacterial infection, and so they should not share food <br/>
with kids.  But mothers DO share food with kids, and kiss them, and breathe <br/>
in their faces.  And so you get genetics AND contagion.<br/>
<br/>
A family of my acquaintance has never even bought toothbrushes for their kids <br/>
because the parents didn&#39;t have cavities (the mom didn&#39;t anyway) and the kids <br/>
don&#39;t either.  They don&#39;t have bad breath, their teeth are like perfect, and <br/>
they don&#39;t brush.  <br/>
<br/>
And as for sugar and tooth decay, if you have that condition, Jolly Ranchers <br/>
don&#39;t help a bit.  But there&#39;s sugar in all carbohydrates and so avoidance of <br/>
candy is another parental fib.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little I was told these &quot;truths&quot; which I would probably have been <br/>
smacked for questioning aloud:<br/>
<br/>
french fries cause pimples<br/>
don&#39;t take a bath when you&#39;re on your period (and DO NOT swim)<br/>
coffee will stunt your growth<br/>
chocolate is bad for kids--limit it  (it&#39;s not bad for adults, they can have <br/>
all they want)<br/>
if you brush your teeth you won&#39;t have cavities (therefor if you get a cavity <br/>
it is plainly and simply because you didn&#39;t brush your teeth enough)<br/>
if you stick your tongue out your face might stick like that<br/>
if you cross your eyes they might stick like that<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s probably more that I&#39;ve gladly blocked out.<br/>
<br/>
OH!  My mom never served milk and fish at the same time because she said some <br/>
people are allergic to the combination and it would kill them and she wasn&#39;t <br/>
going to risk it. <br/>
<br/>
A year after having my favorite Tastee Freez meal at least weekly I realized <br/>
it was a milk shake and a fish sandwich, and realized I was not personally <br/>
myself going to die from fish and milk together.<br/>

<br/>
I remember my mother making two of my older sisters smoke a cigar after<br/>
catching them smoking to &#39;cure&#39; them. She, of course, smoked non filter<br/>
Winstons, of the non grammatical commercial fame, non-stop. They both<br/>
have struggled to quit smoking all their adult lives. Heredity or<br/>
backlash coercion?<br/>
