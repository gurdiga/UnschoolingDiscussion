I&#39;m new here - have just been reading for a couple of days - but can relate a bit to your situation.  Take things as they come, staying in the moment, when that is what you need to do/all you can do.  Look to the future, make plans, when you can.  Reach out, as you have done here, for support.  For me, that was one of the hardest things to do -- but it has had a great impact on my life.  Take care of your own health, you can&#39;t support your family as well if you are physically ailing.  Be nice to yourself, and let others be nice to you.  Indulge in what nourishes your spirit, that is what will sustain you.<br/>
<br/>
Please, feel free to write me off list if you wish - maybe we can hold each other&#39;s hands some.  I&#39;m recently back on chemo for recurrent ovarian cancer, and dh will be having heart surgery next month.  We have only one child still at home, dd10, other 3 grown & flown.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hi Everyone!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m posting because I&#39;m sad and lonely, and I want someone to hold my hand.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My dh is sick, and the docs tell me he may never get well enough to be able to work or take responsibility for the little guys while I&#39;m at work, although he will probably be able to live at home for a long time (severe chronic illness).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just as I was about to bite the bullet and face the fact that I&#39;m running out of money and I have to find child care and get to work, I think my son has whooping cough. So it sounds like it&#39;ll be several more weeks before I can put him with someone and work shifts (I&#39;m a nurse). All solutions I figure now sound like they&#39;ll evaporate in five months when my son reaches *mandatory school age* and child care becomes scarce.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve considered in-home care (a nanny) but realize that if my husband is able to return home, it may be difficult to keep a nanny around with a man in the house all day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d appreciate ideas, or just hand holding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for listening.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
