&lt;&lt; When I mentioned Keith holding him first, Kirby pulled off the breast with <br/>
 his mouth open and milk still unswallowed and looked at my face with big <br/>
 eyes.   He listened to some more of the story, and he reached over and got <br/>
my <br/>
 hand and kissed it.  <br/>
 <br/>
 He had never kissed my hand like that.  I lay with him and rubbed his head <br/>
 and he fell asleep.<br/>
 <br/>
 I went and called Keith at work and said, &quot;When you had Kirby in the <br/>
hospital <br/>
 room, when he was born, what were you doing before I came in?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 He said, &quot;Just talking to him.  And kissing his hands and his feet.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh my gosh...I&#39;m crying.<br/>
That was incredible Sandra. <br/>
Thank you for sharing it.<br/>
