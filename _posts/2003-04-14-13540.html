<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068925016">&lt;&lt;You could do a whole scientific study of her.  Map<br/>
sightings.  Note migrations.  Chart behaviors.   Very<br/>
educational!  Report it to her after you have a couple<br/>
of years of data, maybe!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
ROFL!  Thanks for this, Sandra!  I needed it just<br/>
know.  We picked up my parents in Phoenix yesterday &<br/>
I can hardly stand to be around my mom tonight.  It is<br/>
exhausting!  <br/>
<br/>
However, dh & I leave tomorrow for a few days in<br/>
Mexico.  yeah!<br/>
