<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547241957">have a few questions  .<br/>
first i want to say thank you. i have  spent the  3 hours  reading  <br/>
from one link to the next on unschooling. I may have just stumbled <br/>
on  what i have been looking for.<br/>
 We have a 12 (13 in two weeks))year old. That we have adopted last <br/>
year.(she has lived with us for 3  1/2 years)who had sever pts. and <br/>
adhd.she was  abused in every way and  under feed and  had been <br/>
dionosed with reactive attachment disorder at the age of  five (we <br/>
did not know this till she was almost 12). She has come a long long <br/>
way and had grown  a lot as now she gets feed (she was 55 lbs and  <br/>
wore a  6x in clouthing, when we got her and now wears a womans  6 <br/>
tall and weighs 120.(giggle she wore a size 4 in childrens shoes then <br/>
now a 10 in womans)she trys very very hard  and is  recently wanting <br/>
to   frow more. she loves to learn and is determined to get past the  <br/>
RAD (reactive attachment Disorder). her and I have both  desided we <br/>
need to work harder on the  bonding as the theropist thinks we need <br/>
to work  on the adhd part and  use more drug theropy.( we have tryed <br/>
this over and overusuly makes it worse) we have agreed to try  time <br/>
relised this may however   we have refused the if you want to give <br/>
another to counter the first routine we wont do it)and we are both  <br/>
asking why  is it more important to  do the  grade thing any way<br/>
i have spent 3 years fighting the school. and trying to make them <br/>
fallow the iep, They have  insisted that we fix the not turning in <br/>
homework problem and fix the behavior also. The behavior is usuly  <br/>
social problems and she is  the kid every one picks on the kids and <br/>
teacher tell me this. Lisa  has very very poor social skills.so my <br/>
question  this last year to them has beenyou belive i need to keep <br/>
her in here for social reasons and what i see her learning is how to <br/>
be a door mat and  you say she is eager to learn but you dont have <br/>
time to teach her because she ask so many questions and  in the <br/>
classes she has  only 3 other students  she does great even helps <br/>
explain to others once she  has had all her questions answered. and <br/>
she is still flunking because she dont turn in her homework and if <br/>
she dont do the homework it is usualy because  the teaches have <br/>
failed to expline it in small steps so she can understand. And i keep <br/>
her in  school why? then they point out my spelling and  math  <br/>
problem and math is one of her problems.We dont have a lot of money <br/>
and they know it, know i could not afford to hire a bunch of tutors <br/>
and they  said i would have to turn my home into a mini school  to <br/>
make it work and hire  people to do it and if i didnt have the  <br/>
money  no way i could do this. i have spent 6 mounths  looking. have <br/>
found  that maybe they are wrong. there are lots of  places i could <br/>
open enroll her and as close as  a 1/2 hour away there are  places <br/>
that have  home school resorese rooms. and as for spelling  her and i <br/>
decided together that it could be a game and we  write down words we <br/>
spell wrong and  we keep list short  and  play a game to teach both <br/>
of us.I stared  with telling her i think it might be a idea for us to <br/>
do home  school stuff this summer when   u get out of school end of <br/>
may and i expected the  school in summer thing. to my surprise she <br/>
had ideas and  is excited about the idea and even said this is a way <br/>
we can work on the bonding issue mom, but what about math i told her <br/>
of the other types of school she said gee then  not every one will <br/>
know me and maybe i could make friends?                        <br/>
  We make  biweekly trips to  junk stores usualy she hits the  <br/>
clouthing fast last 2 times she has went to learning  area and found <br/>
cd&#39;s  and books she would like to learn from.<br/>
  Her counsler  now says she will fall behind  and that there is not <br/>
enough social interreaction  for her  . Her and I belive that  this <br/>
can be handled and I think learning  low self esteem and flunking <br/>
even though ya know the  materal is silly. The teacher dont fallow <br/>
the iep at all  we once had it set up to sigh a paper if she had <br/>
turned in home work and for every day she   got full day of <br/>
signutures she got  computer time . if she didnt get them she  didnt <br/>
and then if she missed 3 in a day she got a 1/2 hour in her roomthey <br/>
all sighned  every day for months. then sent home a  your kid is <br/>
flunking because she didnt turn in homework . The poor girl went into <br/>
tears. they had told her she was doing fine and  this took us both  <br/>
by surprise. i marched in to the school  and getting nothing but run <br/>
around called a  iep meeting they told me they didnt have heart not <br/>
to sighn the paper and as time went on  they  felt she handt turned  <br/>
it in because they didnt have time to teach her in small steps and <br/>
she was  behind/ I stoped the sighing thing told them what i was <br/>
thinking about home school and they  told me i lacked the skills and <br/>
that i would be doing  her a &quot;grave dis service&quot; if i did that and <br/>
quoted both her poor social skills and  the time it would take to  do <br/>
it. I shook my head  social skills? she is made fun of (granted <br/>
sometimes she causes it) and has no friends (small small towns dont <br/>
forgive and have long memorys) and as for my skills well i pionted <br/>
out to them i took a kid they told me would neve bond and couldnt <br/>
feel and that would end up in  instatutions the rest of her life and <br/>
she not been in a single instution, and  now we are trying to get her <br/>
to stop crying in school when she is made fun of.I think i keep <br/>
hesatiting because  so many tell me i am wrong i cant do this one  <br/>
that she will be at 7th grade level forever, if i do. except in <br/>
reading  where she reads at level 12.I think they  dont know my kid <br/>
and my determation. I think  ok so we both hate math and  have what <br/>
they call a math disorder. so what  we are integelent and read well <br/>
and she has so many questions and willness to find the answers. (oh i <br/>
probley forgot to say this child is  related to me by blood and other <br/>
reason they said with RAd kids bio related not a good idea asked me <br/>
to give her to system after we found  out  after a year and a 1/2)<br/>
So my questions are any one know if  this is bad idea for a teen Rad? <br/>
and is it to late as she is  almost 13 to start ?if her and i choose  <br/>
what  she does  why is that wrong? I kept saying so what she learns <br/>
what she can or wants in  math and i dont turn my home into a mini <br/>
school. we will find things she does want to learn. and she does want <br/>
to learn . heck  she out and out flunking  sience and those are one <br/>
the areas she keep picking up at the stores she wasnts to  do it on <br/>
computer the  woman i  have do my taxes say in Iowa there is a tax <br/>
break  and fed she says  if i keep track  what i spend for learning I <br/>
can claim 25 hundred on taxes. I didnt know that. with that break why <br/>
cant i hire out what she wants to learn?save 2 grand from income tax <br/>
this year and use it and keep track?she wants to plant a flower bed <br/>
this year want to learn about how the roots  work and wants to  read <br/>
the books school wont  give her time to  she  reads there books and <br/>
dont like them  and  when she dont do there  book it usualy because <br/>
she been  reading her books.she is excited about summer school with <br/>
mom and older sister says she will help her in oreas  and lisa is so <br/>
excited . I however dont want a mini school setting have been looking <br/>
for alternitives . hands on  lets learn this together ways of <br/>
teaching.<br/>
I stumbled on this site  when looking in yahoo groups for attacment <br/>
disorders is there a reason it was listed here? are there others with <br/>
a Rad child? Can someone that  has poor  math and grammer and <br/>
spelling make this work?<br/>
I have decided not to do spell check just to let you know how poor <br/>
the spelling realy is. and  get advise from those that  live it. <br/>
Thank you in advance for your advice and  I am sorry for the lenght <br/>
of this post.<br/>
