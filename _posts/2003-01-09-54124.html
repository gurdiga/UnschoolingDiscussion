<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041565060">Peter Kowalke&#39;s website says that his documentary is the second one ever to<br/>
be made about homeschooling.  Can anyone tell me what the other one is?<br/>
<br/>
And, to anyone who&#39;s seen them -- how much of their content portrays or<br/>
addresses unschooling specifically?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe all those young unschooled filmmakers will immortalize unschooling<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; in that medium.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s already been done once. It&#39;s called Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And Peter Kowalke has just released his Documentary? of unchooled teens.<br/>
&gt; About $20. Order through his website.<br/>
