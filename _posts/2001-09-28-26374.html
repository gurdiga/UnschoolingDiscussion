<div id="ygrps-yiv-504227356">Just some trivia from our personal experience meant to encourage new <br/>
unschoolers who are wondering if they&#39;ll cover enough bases for their <br/>
children&#39;s success.  My daughter seems to have learned whether I <br/>
&quot;push&quot; something or even try to &quot;supress&quot; something.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I don&#39;t believe in unsupervised kids, so I subtly tried <br/>
to discourage my daughter from learning to ride a two wheeler as there <br/>
is no where for her to ride safely around here.  I was never <br/>
&quot;available&quot; to help her, dad took a long time revamping the rummage <br/>
sale bike and it was always stored in an inconvenient part of the <br/>
garage.  Well, she learned how to ride anyway BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO.  <br/>
Turned out to be okay as while she won&#39;t go for exercise walks with <br/>
me, she will ride her bike while I walk and waits for me at the corner <br/>
so we can cross streets together.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t believe in giving young children allowances.  If my <br/>
daughter wanted something, she asks and I buy it for her or it goes on <br/>
her gift list.  Now she &quot;earns&quot; her own money by turning her brother&#39;s <br/>
clean socks right side out and pushing the grocery cart for him while <br/>
I do his shopping (he pays her) and she quickly learned that 2.99 is <br/>
really $3 and you always need extra for sales tax and she shops very <br/>
carefully with her own money and doesn&#39;t beg for stuff from me, too. I <br/>
also don&#39;t find loose coins lying around her room anymore.<br/>
<br/>
From the time she was born (it seems) I was anxious for her to read, <br/>
but she wasn&#39;t interested.  Then along came Harry Potter when she was <br/>
8 and I read aloud for hours until I was hoarse.  It was then she <br/>
jumped in and read because I physically could not and we both wanted <br/>
to find out what happened next!  At nine she now reads as well as if <br/>
she HAD started as a new born!<br/>
<br/>
We love our brand of unschooling and have a great relationship.  Hope <br/>
this helps,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-637222972">Hi Terese<br/>
Your story isn&#39;t trivia, and it does help me.  You put<br/>
a smile in my day. <br/>
Thanks, Sharon<br/>
