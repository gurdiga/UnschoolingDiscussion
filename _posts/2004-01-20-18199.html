<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036658959">Ok I need some new ideas. In a couple months Justin my 6 year old <br/>
will be having surgery. This is a BIG surgery he will be in the <br/>
hospital for about 2 weeks. The last week will not be a big deal <br/>
because he will be able to go to the art room BUT the first week he <br/>
will be IN bed. Cheyenne at 4 yo had the same surgery it is awful.<br/>
They can not eat for at LEAST 7-10 days. <br/>
I REALLY REALLY, for my own sanity, need some fresh ideas to keep him <br/>
occupied. This is a child that snacks ALL day. HE is ALWAYS hungry <br/>
and he is going to get bored watching movies. <br/>
<br/>
Please keep in mind he may not be able to sit up or even hold a <br/>
pen/crayon. Cheyenne has had several surgeries but at 2-3 years old <br/>
she was content with movies.<br/>
We also must travel to Michigan and we are in St. louis. I LOVE LOVE <br/>
LOVE traveling with my kids it is SO much fun, but when it is for <br/>
surgery it is a little more stressfull for all. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
<br/>
