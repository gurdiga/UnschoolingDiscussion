<div id="ygrps-yiv-119628596">Hello,<br/>
If you have any personal recommendation for &quot;must sees&quot; within an hour or two of route 89 between Boston and Richmond VT and then back down 91 to 95,  let me know.  We are going to try to hit a few things after the conference.  Also if you know good places to spend the night on 89 that would be appreciated too.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Beth in MD<br/>
FYI the kids are 16.12 and almost 9<br/>
