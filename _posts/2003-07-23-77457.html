<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311480792">My 8 y.o., who used to be on the fence about unschooling last time I<br/>
asked (in May) has now decided he definitely wants to go back to school.<br/>
He is bored to death.  This schocked me, as he never told me he was<br/>
bored until I asked him yesterday if he would rather stay home or go to<br/>
school.  We have done lots of cool things this summer - bought new<br/>
games, gone swimming, to the fair, to the library, etc.  We haven&#39;t been<br/>
just housebound or something.  My oldest has been gone to grandma&#39;s most<br/>
of the summer with his cousin so that could be contributing to the<br/>
boredom since they get along well together.<br/>
This kid does very well in school and knows it, but is bothered with<br/>
ridiculous things there like handwriting grades and phonics (when he&#39;s<br/>
been reading fluently since he was 4).  He finishes his &quot;work&quot; and reads<br/>
the rest of the day.  He&#39;s not very social (like his mother), doesn&#39;t<br/>
care much for the other kids, doesn&#39;t really play with anybody unless<br/>
they approach him, doesn&#39;t play outside with the other kids much.<br/>
He asks me to find &quot;learning websites&quot; and to buy him workbooks.  Is<br/>
this just conditioning because he&#39;s been in school?  Does he expect to<br/>
be entertained more, or to have lots of busy work to do?  He spends most<br/>
of his time playing Diablo 2 or Everquest.<br/>
I don&#39;t know, I guess I&#39;m just frustrated because I&#39;m trying to find a<br/>
solution for my family that will work and I thought he was the flexible<br/>
one (the youngest now wants to stay home, the oldest has always wanted<br/>
to go to school).  I guess I&#39;m a little bored too, although I have way<br/>
too much to do.<br/>
Do kids who haven&#39;t been in school experience boredom, or do they<br/>
entertain themselves more automatically?  Does &quot;deschooling&quot; get rid of<br/>
this if it is a school phenomena?  How do you all deal with boredom?<br/>

<br/>
Hi, Sarah --<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can get some good suggestions from the list.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like workbooks and my kid (9) doesn&#39;t like workbooks, but some<br/>
kids do.  My mom likes crossword puzzles, maybe it&#39;s the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
I subscribe to a list called ClickSchooling that sends out an<br/>
educational website everyday.  (I rarely look at them, but I subscribe.)<br/>
 It&#39;s a fine source of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Also, our great California statewide homeschooling group has a<br/>
tremendous field trip list and educational website list.  (Poke around<br/>
on the website which is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hsc.org">http://www.hsc.org</a>      )<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think educational websites are harmful, if he wants to wander<br/>
through them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son has never been in school, and he occasionally gets bored.  He has a <br/>
book he likes, 1001 Thing To Do When You Have Nothing To Do.   It never lasts <br/>
very long, and a lot of times I tell him, go lay on the bed, and do nothing, and <br/>
see how long you can truly do nothing.  It takes him 5 minutes max to figure <br/>
out he would rather be doing something, anything!, else.  <br/>
<br/>
I find most of the time, it&#39;s just a mood, like any other mood, it will pass. <br/>
 Like you said, sometimes Mamas get in that mood too.  Isn&#39;t that why the <br/>
call them the &quot;dog days of summer&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How do you all deal with boredom?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just got a list of 200 things, today, in one of my emails.  One of the cute <br/>
ones- make a list of things you can/like to do when you&#39;re bored.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-102034855">Sarah,<br/>
You report that your son is bored to death but you didn&#39;t know it until you <br/>
asked him.  Have you asked him what he means by bored?  Boredom is actually a <br/>
precursor to creative explosions at my house.  But the state of boredom is <br/>
generally not very pleasant for any involved.  Sometimes my kids (age 10-19, 3 <br/>
boys and 3 girls) use the boredom thing to indicate that they need more friend <br/>
contact, or that they can&#39;t find anything to watch on TV or do on the computer.  <br/>
But sometimes &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; means I am a tired, I am sad, or I am having a down <br/>
day rather than that there are not exciting opportunities available.<br/>
<br/>
In the beginning when I first pulled my kids out of school they were bored a <br/>
lot.  They had certain expectations of being entertained.  After a while, for <br/>
the youngest it was about 3 weeks, for the older one it was months, they <br/>
really developed some wonderful skills to find an interest in many &quot;mundane&quot; things <br/>
and they learned to rely on each other for stimulation.  These skills were <br/>
manifest in a striking contrast when I had to take my kids to my sister&#39;s <br/>
funeral.  All of the cousins were at the visitation and funeral and, etc., and there <br/>
was much whining about boredom from many quarters but not from my kids.  The <br/>
other relatives remarked on it.( these are the same people who think I am <br/>
certifiable for homeschooling) and my kids shortly organized a bunch of pencil <br/>
paper quiet games for the visitation with the younger children.  Then back at the <br/>
house they organized creative ball games that all the kids could star in and <br/>
an interesting synchronized scooter and skateboard show for the tween set.  I <br/>
was proud of their abilities to not only occupy themselves and others but also <br/>
for their wonderful abilities to converse with all the adults as well <br/>
(something none of the other teenagers in their sullenness were interested in).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, your son may just need time to develop some more skills to <br/>
self-motivate and entertain.  He may also be really missing his brother and not know how <br/>
to say it exactly.  I would help him process his feelings and explore his <br/>
solutions rather than rushing to up the entertainment ante.  A lot of the <br/>
philosophy of unschooling as I understand it is about being &quot;real&quot; in your learning.  <br/>
In my house, at least, it is very &quot;real&quot; that life is not one series of <br/>
entertaining events after another, but it doesn&#39;t have to be boring either.  Listen <br/>
to him talk about how he feels and what he wants, share with him your desires <br/>
and thoughts as well.  Hopefully somewhere in there you will figure it out <br/>
together.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it is probably a big adjustment for kids to suddenly have whole<br/>
days to fill, and maybe sometimes when you can&#39;t think of anything you<br/>
want to do right away, you sort of panic and go towards the familiar,<br/>
which would be school. There are also all the societal messages about<br/>
school that your son has gotten, even if he&#39;s not consciously aware of<br/>
it, he&#39;s heard for years how School is Important and You Must Attend. I<br/>
think it can be scary to make that change, and sometimes when I&#39;m sort of<br/>
low-grade scared about things it manifests more as being sort of antsy<br/>
and bored. <br/>
<br/>
Rain only went to kindie, and she went to two different kindies, both odd<br/>
in their own ways, and we decided to unschool near the end of the school<br/>
year and she was like, *Yes!*&quot;, and she already had good friends who were<br/>
homeschooling... but it still was an adjustment. I don&#39;t remember her<br/>
saying she was bored, but she might have. I do remember her feeling like<br/>
she should be in school, somehow, and doing &quot;school stuff&quot;. She missed<br/>
the tire swing and the trinomial cube a lot. It lasted until maybe<br/>
October or November... a couple of times she said she thought she&#39;d like<br/>
to go back to school, and we talked specifically about what she was<br/>
missing and got our own trinomial cube and did some more structured stuff<br/>
through the regional parks, and by November it wasn&#39;t an issue anymore,<br/>
she&#39;d adjusted and wasn&#39;t at all conflicted any more... but she only went<br/>
to one year of school, a semester of teeny tiny Montessori (7 kids, I<br/>
think) and a semester of Reggio Emilia whole language anti-bias<br/>
curriculum charter school (think Berkeley, although technically the<br/>
school was a couple blocks into Oakland).<br/>

You report that your son is bored to death but you didn&#39;t know it until<br/>

actually a <br/>

contact, or that they can&#39;t find anything to watch on TV or do on the<br/>
computer.  <br/>
But sometimes &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; means I am a tired, I am sad, or I am having a<br/>
down <br/>
day rather than that there are not exciting opportunities available.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Today he is bent on getting a new game, thinking that will solve all<br/>
problems.  I keep trying to reason with him that the last 5 games I<br/>
bought this summer haven&#39;t solved anything yet, but... I may get one<br/>
anyway since I&#39;m trying to talk him into coming to a very boring hair<br/>
appointment with me (and I can&#39;t get ahold of any grandparents for some<br/>
reason).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
In the beginning when I first pulled my kids out of school they were<br/>
bored a <br/>
lot.  They had certain expectations of being entertained.  After a<br/>
while, for <br/>
the youngest it was about 3 weeks, for the older one it was months, they<br/>

but also <br/>
for their wonderful abilities to converse with all the adults as well <br/>
(something none of the other teenagers in their sullenness were<br/>
interested in).<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this input!  It&#39;s exactly what I suspected, but wasn&#39;t too<br/>
sure.  Since I was &quot;homeschooled&quot; and in the boonies with few friends I<br/>
also became good at self-entertainment.  But I may have been good at it<br/>
anyway, who knows.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

I agree, life shouldn&#39;t be all about trying to entertain all the time.<br/>
I&#39;m never sure how much of that to do - my youngest would like me to<br/>
play games with him *all day* and I get bored to death after awhile.<br/>

getting done :-)  That has been hard to teach my children, the balance between <br/>
keeping the family functioning and doing great projects or taking off for parts <br/>
unknown.  Not that I put much emphasis on the whole house stuff (as any visitor <br/>
can attest&lt;VBG&gt;), nonetheless there are essentials that must be accomplished <br/>
and those essentials sometimes conflict with the plans of various other <br/>
members of the household (myself included).  We have spent this summer working hard <br/>
on balance.  Going camping was a great educator for them, because without the <br/>
extras, like a refrigerator, the need to spend time on functionality was very <br/>
apparent and everyone chipped in to make the time together the most beneficial <br/>
to all.  <br/>
<br/>
I am sure you all will find some balance too, but it is something that needs <br/>
attention, it doesn&#39;t happen magically.<br/>

That might help some.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I guess I&#39;m a little bored too, although I have way<br/>
too much to do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Priorities are important with unschooling.  If the principle is that you&#39;re <br/>
creating a learning-nest for your child, that should take at least as much of <br/>
your energy as you would expend if he were going to school, and maybe as much <br/>
time as he will spend in school if he goes.  It shouldn&#39;t be an hour of your <br/>
attention a day, or less.  <br/>
<br/>
If you have too much to do to find things to do with him, then school is an <br/>
option, but is it really the best option?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling shouldn&#39;t take last place in a mom&#39;s life.  If what you &#39;have to <br/>
do&#39; is stuff like housework or cooking or washing the car, maybe he would want <br/>
to do those things with you, or maybe you could just plain do them <br/>
differently or less so that his learning opportunities (or entertainment, or <br/>
exploration, or however you want to think of it) is a higher priority.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
That one might help too.  And the checklists for unschoolers (linked at the <br/>
bottom of that) might help you shake things up so that home seems more <br/>
attractive to him than school.<br/>

they have an open house every three years or so.  Holly really wanted to see <br/>
where her dad worked.    Kirby was scheduled to work.  I asked if he could <br/>
arrange to take at least an hour off, but he said he remembered the last open <br/>
house and he already knew what the place looked like.   He was calm and polite <br/>
about it and it wasn&#39;t worth whining or pressing or guilting him to go.  He was <br/>
right.  He remembered two tours.<br/>
<br/>
So we went with Marty (14) and Holly (11) and had a really fun time.  But at <br/>
one point in the hallway we met a family with a VERY very sullen teenaged <br/>
girl.  She was a bundle of resistent pout.   We got past them and around the <br/>
corner and all looked at each other with big eyes and said little muttery things <br/>
like &quot;We left our sullen teenager at home!&quot;  We weren&#39;t being mean, just kind of <br/>
amused and sorry for her being so unwilling to be there.<br/>
<br/>
Had Kirby gone he wouldn&#39;t have been nearly THAT sullen, but he does seem to <br/>
be in a phase where what we do is just kinda dull and grey compared to the <br/>
sparkle of what other people do, and I think that&#39;s natural.  He also just spent <br/>
last weekend with the whole family but me, and had some good stories to tell <br/>
about his dad and siblings, so all isn&#39;t lost.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m often impressed with how resourceful unschoolers are compared to kids who <br/>
are used to direction and limitations.<br/>

I subscribe to a list called ClickSchooling that sends out an<br/>
educational website everyday. (I rarely look at them, but I subscribe.)<br/>
It&#39;s a fine source of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Also, our great California statewide homeschooling group has a<br/>
tremendous field trip list and educational website list. (Poke around<br/>
on the website which is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hsc.org">http://www.hsc.org</a> )<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think educational websites are harmful, if he wants to wander<br/>
through them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304311918"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; **He asks me to find &quot;learning websites&quot; and to buy him workbooks.  Is<br/>
&gt; this just conditioning because he&#39;s been in school? **<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I took my children out of school this past December.  My daughter, Anna, was <br/>
in the  7th grade and she loved school.  She was an excellent student, every <br/>
teacher&#39;s dream.  The first few months of being out of school ( we unschooled <br/>
from the start), she was very antsy, anxious, worried.  She also asked me to <br/>
get her workbooks, make her a schedule, give her assignments..etc.   She felt <br/>
totally lost and and like she was just &quot;wasting time&quot;.     I never prohibited <br/>
her from &quot;doing work&quot; I did make workbooks available to her.  I did make her out <br/>
a schedule and give her assignments. She didn&#39;t do any of them.. LOL.   She <br/>
said, what was the use in doing them if they were not &quot;required&quot;  Unschooling <br/>
was a big adjustment for her.   It was so different from school life.  And, in <br/>
her case, she enjoyed school and all of it&#39;s trappings.  OR, so she thought <br/>
:-)   <br/>
<br/>
Anna slowly but surely started to trust herself., to become self-motivated.   <br/>
She began to see that she had the freedom to learn about anything she wanted <br/>
to.. or not.   She began to explore her own personal interests and hobbies in <br/>
depth.   One of the biggest things she learned was that SHE was capable of <br/>
directing her own learning.    She now does not have to rely on someone else to <br/>
tell her what to do, what to learn.   <br/>
<br/>
  Of course, I had to guide and nurture that trust.  I didn&#39;t just say &quot;get <br/>
over it&quot;.   If she said she was bored, I would make suggestions.  Sometimes she <br/>
followed them, sometimes not.  I was (am) here to answer any questions she <br/>
has, provide any resources she wants/needs.  (books, transportation, passing <br/>
along info I recieve, etc) <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s ironic that just today, before I read the post I am replying to.. Anna <br/>
and I had this conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Me- &quot;How do you like unschooling?&quot; <br/>
Anna- &quot;I like it, I like it alot&quot;.<br/>
Me- &quot;Do you want to keep unschooling, or do you want to do more curriculum <br/>
type stuff?&quot; <br/>
Anna - . &quot;UNCHOOLING!, DEFINITELY!&quot; ( no hesitation)  lol...<br/>
 Me -  &quot;But at first, you didnt really like it&quot; <br/>
Anna -  &quot;I know, but, now I do, I think its alot better than school or school <br/>
at home&quot;<br/>
Me- &quot;Do you feel like you are learning all the time&quot;<br/>
Anna - .. &quot;Hmm, well, yeah, but I also think that now I know you don&#39;t really <br/>
have to know all the crap they teach in school to be a happy, successful <br/>
person&quot; <br/>
<br/>
  I laughed at that, and I said, &#39;well, yeah, thats true. but, we are really <br/>
always learning, all the time.. all of us.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Anna - &quot;Yeah, you are right.. because you just told me all about how these <br/>
drinks (Set-ups from a local grill) were really intended as alcohol mixers&quot;   <br/>
Me-    &quot;LOL, yeah, you&#39;re right.. see, we do learn something new every day&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, before you folks think I gave Anna a &quot;lesson&quot; on the origin of Set-ups.. <br/>
lol.. Let me clarify.   We stopped at the local grill to get Set-ups.. a <br/>
summer ( well, anytime) favorite.  Anna asked me what was in Set-ups, and I told <br/>
her.  Sundrop, Cherry soda, cherries and lemons.  She said, &quot;why are they c<br/>
alled &quot;Set-ups?&quot;   So, I told her what a REAL &quot;Set-up&quot; is.<br/>
<br/>
Anna has made the most radical changes in her thinking among my children.  <br/>
Ethan and JP hated school, so they always loved unschooling..  She wouldn&#39;t <br/>
DREAM of doing a workbook now.  At times I think.. OH NO, She is TOO independent.. <br/>
lol.  The other night, I was watching &quot;The Donner Party&quot; on PBS.  I  asked <br/>
her if she wanted to watch it with me.  She said.. &quot;uhh, no&quot;.  I said. &quot;come on, <br/>
its good, its a true story, very historical&quot;. She gave me a look and said, <br/>
&quot;Moma, that is so lame.  You think I am going to come watch it just because it <br/>
is &quot;historical?&quot;   What could I say?  point taken.. :-)<br/>

 &lt;&lt;Do kids who haven&#39;t been in school experience boredom, or do they<br/>
 entertain themselves more automatically?  Does &quot;deschooling&quot; get rid of<br/>
 this if it is a school phenomena?  How do you all deal with boredom?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I remember that Tara (the always schooled child) would mention boredom when<br/>
she was younger and even as long as a year ago. The younger 3 who have never<br/>
been to school have never mentioned that word. So not sure if they are still<br/>
too young yet or never schooled kids just don&#39;t understand boredom. Sorry I<br/>
can&#39;t help you with the rest. Interesting question though and I&#39;ll be<br/>
looking to see if other never schooled kids mention boredom.<br/>

My son, who was schooled through 6th grade, is always bored.  This isn&#39;t scientific fact, but I think that school and then homework took up so much of his time that he never really learned how to entertain himself.  On the other hand, my daughter was schooled through 5th grade and she&#39;s never bored, so maybe their personality has something to do with it, too.  <br/>

<br/>
I think in part school teaches kids that what they like is stupid and <br/>
inferior, but the kids KNOW that what the school wants them to do is stupid.  They <br/>
either decide they&#39;re right (and school is stupid) or they&#39;re wrong (and <br/>
they/the kids are stupid).  There&#39;s not room for many more options.<br/>
<br/>
So if their choice is doing a stupid school thing or a thing the school <br/>
taught them was stupid (playing, watching TV) they kinda can get stuck, because <br/>
they don&#39;t want to do anything &quot;stupid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cynicism, planted deeply.<br/>

My thought is that schooled kids get used to feeling stuck and just<br/>
staying in their circumstances, even when bored.  My son didn&#39;t used to<br/>

after 6th, whether he was ever bored.<br/>
<br/>
He said, &quot;That&#39;s deep, Mom.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>

He said that he doesn&#39;t feel that way at ALL now, but that he did when he was <br/>
just out of school. {I figure our deschooling took about 18 months or so.}  <br/>

do it that he really wasn&#39;t sure HOW to do anything himself. He mostly <br/>
watched TV and listened to music and IMed friends and SLEPT. He never told me he was <br/>

Now there aren&#39;t enough hours in the day to get done what he has on his <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008392651">I know my son is bored a bit lately, but that it is, as Sandra and others<br/>
have said, mostly that he wants MY time.  I try, but being pregnant and<br/>
tired and having a younger brother around who also needs care...I&#39;m not<br/>
doing as much as I could perhaps.  I am trying some things I&#39;ve heard here.<br/>
(Rock, paper, scisors is the latest &quot;borrow.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
But I do know that *I* am bored.  If I can manage to have a book going, then<br/>
I am ok for a while, but we are spending a lot of time watching the same<br/>
episodes of cartoons over and over and my mind is turning to mush.  Days<br/>
that my son puts his foot down and doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere, he also just<br/>
wants to watch these cartoons, but gets angry if I don&#39;t want to sit and<br/>
watch with him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very frustrated.  I know some of this will get better when the littler<br/>
kids get bigger, but until then, we are having troubles.  I think we are<br/>
both &quot;deschooling&quot; to a large extent.  Although he wasn&#39;t in &quot;school&quot; for<br/>
long, just K and a few weeks of 1st, he was in &quot;care&quot; for the whole rest of<br/>
his life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083381663">Kelly - I&#39;m thinking that you have to do little little things to jazz  <br/>
up your life and your son&#39;s. You&#39;re not in a position to make life  <br/>
overly exciting, but calm and sweet you could do by just doing a few  <br/>
little things once in a while.<br/>
<br/>
How about you get a bunch of pattern blocks and just leave them on the  <br/>
coffee table or somewhere, near the tv maybe? Just play with them - and  <br/>
if your son starts playing too, just do it together, quietly, while the  <br/>
cartoons are going or whatever. (Remember you can build with them, too,  <br/>
not just make flat patterns.) Or use some other kind of easy to work  <br/>
with open-ended kind of building thing - or art materials. Do things  <br/>
that ARE for younger kids, too, like playdough -- you can get him to  <br/>
help you make it and choose spices and flavorings to put in it. Or make  <br/>
goop or one of those other weird things. Or - just play with a few  <br/>
boxes of cornstarch and some water. (Probably not in front of the tv.)<br/>
<br/>
I mean - just do these things easily and simply - don&#39;t make a  <br/>
production out of them --<br/>
<br/>
Oh - here are two really fun things for kids of all ages ---<br/>
<br/>
Put milk in a plate - and put drops of food coloring all over the place  <br/>
on the milk. Then drop droplets of dishwashing detergent and watch what  <br/>
happens.<br/>
<br/>
Make a mold from gelatin - clear plain gelatin - use a lot of it so you  <br/>
get a really firm mold. Turn the mold out onto a plate. Now use eye  <br/>
droppers and tempera paint - suck up the paint into the eye dropper and  <br/>
then gently insert the eye dropper into the gelatin mold and slowly  <br/>
squirt the paint into it. Use different colors and just keep going -  <br/>
you&#39;ll probably do it until the whole thing falls apart into a big mess  <br/>
- but you&#39;ll have had fun.<br/>

&gt; Days<br/>
&gt; that my son puts his foot down and doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere, he  <br/>
&gt; also just<br/>
&gt; wants to watch these cartoons, but gets angry if I don&#39;t want to sit  <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; watch with him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m very frustrated.  I know some of this will get better when the  <br/>

&gt; are<br/>

&gt; for<br/>

&gt; nlimited time and unlimited money then what would he do.  He didn&#39;t know, except for <br/>
&gt; go shopping.  He already has the unlimited time. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Keep in mind that the nagging doesn&#39;t have to be VERBAL! It can be rolling <br/>
your eyes when he&#39;s doing something you might not approve of. Offering him too <br/>
much too early (I did that---bringing books home and NOT just leave them lying <br/>
around, but handing them to him.). Suggesting that he do something---anything. <br/>
 Not that you&#39;re doing any of these things. <br/>
<br/>
I want to be really clear on this---and I feel foggy. <br/>
<br/>
OK---When a child&#39;s in school and feels that his life is being lived FOR him <br/>
(the way Cameron felt), he NEEDS almost to have an *absence* of stimulation <br/>
for a while. <br/>
<br/>
Most of the regular posters here, whom I learned so much unschooling from, <br/>
never had kids in school---They knew about it early or they pulled them out <br/>
*very* early. They got it early enough to not have to deschool. I think <br/>
deschooling has GOT to be THE hardest thing for a parent to do. It&#39;s not &quot;natural&quot;. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had a child in private school (which comes with a WHOLE nother set of <br/>
problems than public school!!!). Not only was he in school, but the teachers CARED. <br/>
That sounds like a good thing &lt;g&gt;, but that meant they were involved in every <br/>
single aspect of his life! Every one! I can see now how that has GOT to be <br/>
intimidating---back then I thought it was a GOOD thing!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think that deschooling almost needs a HUGE vacuum.--or what are <br/>
those things called that are void of light, sound, movement? The child needs NOT <br/>
to do anything for a long while. We say to DO all of these really cool <br/>
things---go out to eat, buy great art supplies, rent movies and games, play, play, <br/>
play. And to an extent, that&#39;s right and good. But the schooled child may need <br/>
NOTHING for a while. This is really hard when you wnat SO much FOR him. When <br/>
you KNOW that unschooling can offer so much. What what he may really NEED is <br/>
NOTHING.<br/>
<br/>
He NEEDS to find out Who He Is, not who everyone wants or thinks him to be.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron had NONE of his current interests when he came out of school. They <br/>
all evolved out of ... of nothing! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I finally quit nagging (and it can be the SLIGHTEST thing---remember <br/>
tweens and teens are VERY sensitive!), Cameron started becoming himself. We went <br/>
through a horrible Goth period &lt;g&gt; when he first started becoming. We&#39;ve dyed <br/>
his hair several times. He&#39;s redone his room and plain made over his LIFE! HIS <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s such a cool person. I hate what I and the private school did to him. But <br/>
he has his own life now---and like I said there arent enough hours in the <br/>
day!<br/>
<br/>
Last year he hardly participated in the conference---my own son. He spent the <br/>
whole weekend in the hotel room! This year he&#39;s very excited about it and is <br/>
planning to help a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Give him time---lots of time. Unlimited time---it will limit itself. And the <br/>
freedom to do NOTHING. TELL him this! When he wakes from the school stupor, he <br/>
will have found himself and become Who He Is---and he&#39;ll be fascinating. It <br/>
just takes time----and no nagging! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

went to the zoo with them last month and he declared each exhibit &quot;B-o-r-r-ring!&quot; <br/>
He is unimpressed with most things and his mom talks about how she must <br/>

never said that they are bored or even asked me to give them ideas of something <br/>
to do. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Can you ask why that&#39;s a favorite episode, or comment on whatever you find <br/>
interesting?  Kirby and I used to discuss the methods and motivations of <br/>
Splinter, the Ninja Turtles&#39; teacher--why sometimes he would hang back and let them <br/>
make decisions, but sometimes he didn&#39;t.   Those conversations invariably <br/>
touched on things in our own relationship, or in other families he knew.   We also <br/>
talked about voicework (one of Kirby&#39;s earliest interests was voice acting for <br/>
cartoons and puppets--he figured out on his own really early that Mr. Rogers <br/>
was doing more than one voice, and that Kermit was Bert with a different tone <br/>
in the voice and so on, so I would research and supply him names and some <br/>
details and trivia, and he would tell me when one of the voice actors he was <br/>
familiar with did a bit on another show or on a commercial.  He was always right.  <br/>
Just something he has the ability to hear.  Animaniacs was WAY fun for him <br/>
because he could tell me who was doing what.<br/>
