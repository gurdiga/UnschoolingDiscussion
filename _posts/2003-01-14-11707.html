they won&#39;t mind coming out to hike and explore on our<br/>

the weekdays, so two alone moms could visit.  Or maybe<br/>
we could get together someplace (one of the countless<br/>
beaches?) between your place and mine.  I know some<br/>
kids really enjoy playing with younger children<br/>
sometimes and some don&#39;t.  Thomas is 6 and Alex is 4.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-542714851">Okay, I need a little reality check.  ...alright, I need a BIG reality check.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the situation.<br/>
I have two kids.  One is 16, Rachael, awesome (of course), who was in a <br/>
&#39;progressive&#39; private school (her decision) until 8th grade, then a charter <br/>
high for a few months, and is now unschooling her high school years.  The <br/>
second kid, Damian is 13, in seventh grade at the same &#39;progressive&#39; <br/>
private school in 7th grade (it goes to 8th), is dyslexic so he writes <br/>
extremely slowly but loves the school for its Acivities (he&#39;s making <br/>
chainmail at the moment) and his friends there.<br/>
<br/>
Damian was having a meltdown a few months back over homework he wasn&#39;t able <br/>
to get done in time - and he was exhausted, it was late, etc, etc.  I wrote <br/>
on his homework that I was not going to require him to do homework during <br/>
family time and at Damian&#39;s request, wrote another note saying that this <br/>
idea was mine, not Damians.  (He wanted the teacher to not get mad at <br/>
him.)  I later confirmed with the teacher that life was okay with this <br/>
decision and she made some murmurings about it being alright and that <br/>
they&#39;d find a way to get the work done in school or something.<br/>
<br/>
I just found out how she&#39;s been getting her work done.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s been keeping Damian in during lunch EVERY SINGLE DAY to get his &#39;LATE <br/>
WORK&#39; done.  He can&#39;t remember the last time he had a lunch free.  Every <br/>
single day his friends from 7th and 8th grade have been gathering on the <br/>
steps to chat, reconnect, plan after-school activities and eat their <br/>
lunches... and Damian&#39;s been kept inside.  I just had a <br/>
trying-to-be-nonchalant-but-not-very-effectively chat with the boy about it <br/>
and he seems to feel that he NEEDS to do the homework because otherwise <br/>
he&#39;s not going to learn anything and he wants to be successful with his life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m about to scream with rage and frustration, not at the boy, but at the <br/>
teacher and the stupid ficking society that says homework is more important <br/>
than family, friends, activities and that if it&#39;s not done, a kid will be <br/>
stupid and not have a good life.  Never MIND that it&#39;s costing an arm and a <br/>
leg to keep him in the stupid fricking school too!<br/>
<br/>
I want to pull him immediately, even though it&#39;s his choice to BE at that <br/>
school because that viewpoint is so whacked out I can hardly stand it.  I <br/>
want to un-brainwash him!   I want an intervention!!!<br/>
<br/>
I want to honor his wishes to stay with his friends at the school, but I <br/>
also don&#39;t know how much of that desire is prompted by the idea that if <br/>
he&#39;s not &#39;taught&#39;, he won&#39;t learn anything, so he needs a &#39;teacher&#39;, <br/>
complete with homework.<br/>
<br/>
Intending to bolster the argument about not needing homework and the joys <br/>
of unschooling, I asked Rachael to talk about how she&#39;s doing with the <br/>
unschooling thing and she said, &quot;I don&#39;t agree with having homework, but <br/>
I&#39;m learning jack-shit.&quot;  Blew me out of the water.  Here&#39;s a bright, <br/>
intelligent girl who can dye hair almost any color (usually a bright one), <br/>
can build webpages, work with digital images, handle more than 5 chat rooms <br/>
at a time, taught herself to knit, planned her own trip to Oregon on <br/>
Amtrak, including paying for it... and all she can say is that she doesn&#39;t <br/>
know geometry well enough.  I ask her why she thinks she&#39;ll need geometry <br/>
and can&#39;t she brush up on it when she really needs it and she just <br/>
shrugs.  Meanwhile her brother is sitting there just nodding his head, <br/>
saying, &quot;see what I mean?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I finally told them that they had <br/>
blown me out of the water and I needed a little while alone to write to you <br/>
guys and figure out what is going on (and maybe even get some suggestions <br/>
on how to handle it.)  I also wasn&#39;t the coolest because I just went inside <br/>
to find Rae with one of her unschooling buddies (my honorary second <br/>
daughter) and I blew up, asking the buddy to explain to Rae how bright and <br/>
intelligent she is and how few other kids would be able to manage to get <br/>
themselves up to Oregon and back again successfully on their own, yadda, <br/>
yadda, yadda.  I then proceeded to burst into tears.<br/>
<br/>
Way to stay cool, mom.<br/>
<br/>
So, any ideas?<br/>

The only two positives you listed were friends and chain mail.  I was <br/>
pointing out neither needed the school.  <br/>
<br/>
You could do it with or without the continuance of school.  If he&#39;s not <br/>
interested in doing chain mail at home or having his friends at home, then he <br/>
really DOES want the school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Cameron was also at a &quot;progressive&quot;, pricey private school. Same deal. I <br/>
figured that for THAT kind of money, we could GO to the Alamo, we could GO to <br/>
Alaska, we could GO to Spain. (None of that&#39;s happened yet, but for THAT <br/>
money, we *could*! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s glad he went because he has two GREAT friends from there---friends he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have met if he&#39;d not gone. And they are regulars. True friends. He <br/>
lost a few others (and they even now make fun of him, so we hear...), but <br/>
they weren&#39;t real friends to begin with. One of the neat things about leaving <br/>
a private school is that all the kids aren&#39;t neighbors (they&#39;re from all over <br/>
the city)---and the parents are used to driving all over creation already! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The other parents also realize that I&#39;m willing to bend over backwards so <br/>
that Cameron can spend time with their boys, so usually they&#39;re over here <br/>
(and out of their hair!). <br/>
<br/>
Both of the other boys have also left Heathwood. One is in a public high <br/>
school, and one just left a boarding school and is now back home with his mom <br/>
this semester (but she&#39;s moved 1.5 hours north of us. :-( ) and he&#39;s also now <br/>
in public school. The good thing is that they have less homework! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
These three are into skateboarding and filming and music (Cam got drums and <br/>
the other two got guitars for Christmas--another reason to be here--we have <br/>
the drums &lt;g&gt;). But who&#39;s the one with the time to write songs and <br/>
screenplays and make ramps and boards???? You betcha!! The other boys have NO <br/>
extra time for what THEY want to do. I bet your son would find the same thing <br/>
true! TIME!!!<br/>

<br/>
Advice I&#39;ve collected from you:<br/>
<br/>
Make home life even MORE interesting that school life. Make school &quot;optional&quot; <br/>
every morning. Plan your week: <br/>
<br/>
Beach on Monday. Take a picnic lunch. And some magnifying glasses. <br/>
<br/>
Go to the Japanese exhibit on Tuesday. Eat at the Japanese restaurant. At the <br/>
bar, so you can ask questions. Be sure to eat Sushi and seaweed salad!<br/>
<br/>
Look for and pick up Roadkill on Wednesday. Skin it and boil the meat off the <br/>
bones. Now you have a neat skull. Or two. If you have a microscope, even <br/>
better!<br/>
<br/>
Rent Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off on Thursday---and maybe three-four others. Pop <br/>
popcorn and stay in PJ&#39;s all day---OR go to movies all day---different movie <br/>
every two hours----schedule it, maybe at a &quot;Cine-10&quot; or something.<br/>
<br/>
On Friday, road-trip to a factory or a battle reinactment or art museum---in <br/>
another town/city. Go AWAY!<br/>
<br/>
Post what YOUR plans are for the week and DO it. Whether the kids come or <br/>
not. (Older daughter probably will.) Son would have to decide which would be <br/>
more fun, school or what YOU have planned. Tell him he could take a friend if <br/>
the parent OK&#39;s it (He&#39;d have to cut, too, but what you have planned might be <br/>
deemed &quot;educational enough&quot; by the other parent!).<br/>
<br/>
YOU and unschooling need to look ---to BE--- irresistable! ANd he won&#39;t be <br/>
able to resist!<br/>
<br/>
I learned all that from Sandra! <br/>
<br/>
No advice---;-PPPPPP<br/>

<br/>
Hi, Heidi --<br/>
<br/>
This is really tough.  I feel your pain!<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like this is partially a self-esteem issue for your daughter.  IF<br/>
she was in school and IF she was getting &quot;A&#39;s&quot; she could let that pump<br/>
up her ego.  (As a temporary high.  Blech.)<br/>
<br/>
I like the section in Frank Smith&#39;s book, The Book of Learning and<br/>
Forgetting that talks about how the idea of the &quot;learning curve&quot; was<br/>
invented and points out that there is also a &quot;forgetting curve&quot; that<br/>
goes with it.  &quot;Learning&quot; geometry now is no good way to be sure of<br/>
remembering it.<br/>
<br/>
I worked hard and got pretty good grades in college, but I forgot nearly<br/>
everything very promptly.  That really disillusioned me about the value<br/>
of &quot;studying&quot;.  I think the emperor is wearing no clothes.  But<br/>
education researchers are a little reluctant to say so.<br/>
<br/>
If you think your daughter *really wants* to spend time learning<br/>
geometry, I would recommend the Standard Deviants video (esp. if you can<br/>
get it from the library).  (It&#39;s just an overview, but should bolster<br/>
confidence.)  Or, she could use the Key to Geometry workbooks, which may<br/>
be purchasable in small sections.  Also, I know there&#39;s one copy of<br/>
Harold Jacobs&#39; geometry text available for just a dollar.  (It was hard<br/>
for me not to buy it, but I already have a copy.)  His approach to math<br/>
is very gentle and engaging.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026712097">Thanks Betsy!<br/>
I think you might be right on the self-esteem/bolstering part of the <br/>
equation.  It resonates in some way.  Taking geometry for example, she <br/>
actually already knows geometry (well, at least as well as your average <br/>
high schooler).  She was interested last September so I popped out and got <br/>
a &#39;High School Advantage&#39; set of CD&#39;s, one of which focused exclusively on <br/>
Geometry and non-chalantly put it in front of her.  She disappeared with it <br/>
for about 2 weeks and emerged saying that she finished it and it was really <br/>
a lot like Algebra.  I think maybe it&#39;s that she can&#39;t *see* that she&#39;s <br/>
learned it.  She didn&#39;t get an A/B/C/D or a gold star for what she did.  I <br/>
made appreciative comments, but I&#39;m &#39;just mom&#39; in many respects.  I had an <br/>
unschooling local friend ask me if maybe I shouldn&#39;t make up some <br/>
certificates of accomplishment every now and then when she does something <br/>
like this.  I&#39;m torn on the matter because of the whole &#39;punishing by <br/>
rewards&#39; mentality it re-inforces.  On the otherhand, if it makes her happy <br/>
or feel better about what she&#39;s doing...<br/>
<br/>
(grin) Maybe I should do a unit study on &quot;Learning and Forgetting&quot; with <br/>
her!  After all, didn&#39;t Sandra write something in support of Unit <br/>
Studies?  They must be good then! (little humor there) I&#39;ll go see if the <br/>
library has that book and start reading bits of it to her while she&#39;s doing <br/>
other things.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe you should ask her what type of reward she would like.  Maybe some <br/>
shopping or a movie or a little party.  Maybe she would like a certificate or <br/>
maybe a notebook where she can record her accomplishments.  Maybe a nice <br/>
adult day planner, I always like something kinda cool to get me started if I <br/>
have a goal in mind.  Writing down that I&#39;ve accomplished something helps me <br/>
feel, well, more accomplished.<br/>

In regards to misery, I sent in a formally-nasty-but-in-a-nice-way note <br/>
saying that under NO CIRCUMSTANCES is he to be kept in detention (my term) <br/>
to do her homework during any time when other students have free time...and <br/>
that if she has a problem with that, she can call me to discuss it.    (I <br/>
told Damian that he could walk out of the classroom during lunch NO MATTER <br/>
what anyone else said and to call me if anyone tried to keep him <br/>
in.)  Furthermore, if she has work she wishes done, she can send it home <br/>
with Damian and someone here will complete it for her.<br/>
<br/>
I also came up with homework for her and said I would meet with her when <br/>
she had read the book (which I provided) The End of Homework, so she could <br/>
better understand where we were coming from.  That got sent in today as well.<br/>
<br/>
As an interesting note, no fewer than three adult neighbors (two are <br/>
unschoolers) have offered to do his homework for him.  I told Damian this <br/>
and he grinned from ear to ear and started laughing.  I told him that I&#39;d <br/>
look at the homework and if I thought he&#39;d learn anything by doing it, I&#39;d <br/>
let him decide whether he wanted to do it or not, but if I thought it was <br/>
busywork or he already knew it I&#39;d do it for him or get someone else <br/>
to.   Of course, this means that I&#39;ll be doing ALL of the stupid homework...<br/>

Hi, Heidi --<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have teens yet, but I remember *being* a teen, even though it<br/>
was 30 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
My poor mother used to try to convince me that it was okay to be curvy<br/>
and not to be stick thin.  Her intentions were good, but my reaction was<br/>
always of the &quot;what the hell do you know&quot; variety.  I just figured she<br/>
was strange, clueless, biased, and out of touch with reality.<br/>
<br/>
Even if your teens don&#39;t dismiss *your* opinions all of those ways, they<br/>
still know that you ARE intensely BIASED because of your love for them. <br/>
And that makes your opinions almost as suspect as those of a<br/>
high-pressure salesman.<br/>
<br/>
(Am I making you feel better?  Mebbe not.)<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  I think I recognize you from the HSC list.</div>

<br/>
The current issue of People magazine has an article on homework.  Some <br/>
parents at a district in Utah got together to try to get them to make a <br/>
policy limiting the amount of homework.  The comments of people they <br/>
interviewed went back and forth about the value.  One educator said it was <br/>
proven that homework was a factor in future success or some such.  <br/>
Correlation, correlation.  Drives me crazy.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, someone who would rather stay home and study than do other things will <br/>
probably rather stay in a dorm room and study.<br/>
<br/>
They aren&#39;t testing people who did well in college despite partying wildly, <br/>
some of whom were there after partying through high school.  Why do THEY get <br/>
good grades?  Natural talent?  They can&#39;t correlate it with homework, so they <br/>
aren&#39;t part of those statistics.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Of course, this means that I&#39;ll be doing ALL of the stupid homework...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
WHY?  Just to shush the teacher?  Just to help him get his grades?<br/>

You know what might actually not stink?<br/>
The neighbors and you come over, and make a kind of board game out of his <br/>
homework.  Laugh and have fun with all of it.  Speak the answers.  Let him do <br/>
all the writing though.  Then all the discussion and thought and &quot;answers&quot; <br/>
will flow through him and he will actually, truly learn some things that the <br/>
school would have liked for him to learn.  And he&#39;ll learn all the extra <br/>
things the unschooling adults there can add as it&#39;s discussed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>(laughing) I considered requiring a report, but I actually wanted her to <br/>
READ the book, not circular-file it.  This is what I said (and I was really <br/>
pissed when I wrote it, but calmer by the 8th revision.)<br/>
********************************<br/>
It is my hope that the book, The End of Homework, will help explain my <br/>
beliefs on the importance of homework in a childs education and may help <br/>
you clarify and substantiate your beliefs for me so I can understand <br/>
them.  You will notice that I began the book by highlighting passages that <br/>
resonated for me, but in the end, decided that you might reach more benefit <br/>
by reading it unaided more like a real homework assignment <br/>
perhaps.  When you have finished the book, please let us know and we will <br/>
arrange a time to meet to discuss our mutual situation.<br/>
<br/>
I should expect that with good motivation, it will take only a night to get <br/>
through the 102 pages (not including footnotes), two or three nights if you <br/>
wish to lessen the impact on your home or family life.  Please feel free to <br/>
mark up the book, and keep if it you wish.  We all know the intrusion of <br/>
homework can be disruptive to a persons home life and free time, and I was <br/>
concerned that you might likewise find it onerous.  However, as we all hope <br/>
to move swiftly to reach a consensual decision, it is my hope that you <br/>
would welcome the momentary impact on your own home life that you ask <br/>
Damian to undergo weekly.  (I do not suggest however, that you call your <br/>
mother over to read this fairly long book to you, nor have to wait until <br/>
she is available, nor stop what you are doing when she becomes available as <br/>
happens in our home in order to meet external deadlines.)<br/>
****************************<br/>
I&#39;m especially proud of the &#39;good motivation&#39;, &#39;onerous&#39; and her doing once <br/>
what Damian must do weekly bits.  (and the reading part is because Damian <br/>
is &#39;dyslexic&#39; and hates to read so extra paperwork is a real frustration <br/>
for him.  If it&#39;s long and word-dense, he asks me to read it to him.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;good grades?  Natural talent?  They can&#39;t correlate it with homework, so they<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t part of those statistics.<br/>
<br/>

ineffective&#39; websites?  (I&#39;ll google, so don&#39;t bother with that, just if <br/>
you have some you&#39;re fond of already, I&#39;d like to hear of them.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They don&#39;t give grades, so it&#39;s just to shush the teacher - and make her <br/>
think about what she&#39;s really asking for.  She&#39;s asking ME to do the work <br/>
SHE thinks needs doing.  I&#39;m hoping she re-evaluates the validity of the <br/>
work she&#39;s asking for, as well as the amount.  I&#39;ve seen some of it.  It&#39;s <br/>
mostly worksheets and &#39;find the answer in the paragraph&#39; things.  Blech.<br/>
<br/>
Keep the ideas and comments coming!  You&#39;re all really making me think!<br/>

Well, I enjoy your posts tremendously.  But being (at least as a child)<br/>
timid and over-sensitive myself, I have a lot of sympathy for the poor<br/>
newbies, pulling away from the school system and not quite having<br/>
unravelled the whole mental trip that was played on them.<br/>

&gt; YOU and unschooling need to look ---to BE--- irresistable! ANd he won&#39;t be <br/>

 </span></blockquote>these are great ideas but there is also a big drive for kids to branch out<br/>
and have friends and activities that don&#39;t include mom and family. And this<br/>
drive is really important and needs to be accomodated. So making<br/>
irresistable activities might only go so far. Perhaps in addition to these<br/>
ideas it might help to get him involved in activities with other kids<br/>
outside of school. that way he can get all the interaction he desires and<br/>
still do all the good unschooling stuff as well.<br/>
<br/>
If he just gets to busy with band/sports/games/working as a volunteer ???<br/>
whatever his interests are, then he will have to give up the unimportant<br/>
things in life (like the school:)  Plus as someone mentioned you could talk<br/>
about money issues and let him know what kinds of classes or activities he<br/>
could be doing with some of the money instead of paying school fees.<br/>
