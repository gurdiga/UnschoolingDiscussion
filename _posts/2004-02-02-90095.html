-=-Sandra, I remember reading a post of yours a year or so ago where you <br/>
described how you handled it when your kids were fighting. Seems like it was <br/>
mostly Marty and Kirby you were talking about. You had a way of helping the <br/>
underdog not feel so much the underdog and a way to help the big dog not feel <br/>
outnumbered either. A good friend of mine is really bothered by how much her kids <br/>
fight and I wanted to send her the post but can&#39;t find it. -=-<br/>

saved since it makes so much sense when yoy say it and it&#39;s alien territory<br/>

If this isn&#39;t it, I can keep looking.<br/>

 -=-I can&#39;t just let it go because there seems to be no natural consequence<br/>
for hitting. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told kids from time to time when it was fast and severe that if they do<br/>
NOT learn to control their tempers they could end up in prison or dead.<br/>
Because just in brief, the natural consequences of being a violent adult are<br/>
often retaliatory violence or conviction of a crime.<br/>
<br/>
For little kids at home, I separate them.  A trick I learned as a Jr. High<br/>
teacher has served well.  To break up a fight, grab the loser and remove<br/>
him.   He WANTS to be saved.  If you grab the winning participant, you<br/>
might get  hurt.  If you remove the underdog, they both save face.  He can<br/>
think he  wouldn&#39;t have necessarily lost.  The winner still thinks he won.<br/>
<br/>
I talk to the apparent victim first.  Sometimes it turns out he wasn&#39;t such<br/>
a  victim.  But In our case at home, with my boys, that has usually been<br/>
Marty,  who&#39;s younger by two and a half years.  At the moment they&#39;re 16 and<br/>
14 and  physical problems might be over.  Kirby&#39;s learned enough karate that<br/>
he&#39;s  developed the self control that ideally comes with being able to<br/>
seriously  hurt someone.  And they&#39;re both verbal, so physical isn&#39;t their<br/>
first  thought.  So what I&#39;m going to tell is a summary of various things<br/>
over the  years when they were younger, in various stages.<br/>
<br/>
What has worked best is taking the one away and letting him tell me what<br/>
happened.  While he&#39;s calming down and stating his case, I&#39;m asking him what<br/>
he did to try to make things better.  &quot;Did you think of doing this?&quot;  &quot;No,&quot;<br/>
or &quot;Yes, but it didn&#39;t work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So partly it&#39;s a session in possibilities.   Then that kid&#39;s calmer.  But I<br/>
remind them that I&#39;m responsible for seeing that BOTH of them are safe in<br/>
their own homes, and happy.<br/>
<br/>
Then I go to the other kid (usually Kirby) who&#39;s calm by then too, and ask<br/>
for his side.  He tells me the whole thing, and I ask him at the end (since<br/>
I&#39;m wanting his whole story to compare to the other whole version) whether<br/>
he  doesn&#39;t think he could have prevented it by this or that.<br/>
<br/>
Then I say &quot;Marty says you said/did this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately in many of the scenarios, Marty had sneaked up close enough to<br/>
hear and jumped in with &quot;I DID NOT!&quot; so I have to go and deposit Marty<br/>
elsewhere and say later &quot;That really didn&#39;t help me convince him, y&#39;know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So Kirby tells me his version of the evils Marty contributed to the<br/>
argument.   <br/>
<br/>
I remind Kirby he&#39;s older and has a responsibility to show some maturity and<br/>
set an example (as appropriate, if appropriate).  And I tell him yada yada,<br/>
Marty needs to be safe in his own home, and not feel like his life is ruined<br/>
because he has an older brother who&#39;s bullying him (if appropriate...)<br/>
<br/>
Finally I&#39;d go back to Marty and say &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me this part?&quot;<br/>
or  &quot;Kirby says you threw this/said this...&quot;  And I go through it again with<br/>
Marty.  <br/>
<br/>
I know lots of people say to let kids work out their own stuff but I think<br/>
it&#39;s lazy at best and sadistic at worst.  My parents raised two cousins of<br/>
mine and one was mean and violent and frustrated and hurt both me and my<br/>
sister.  There should have been more active supervision and peace making and<br/>
advisement.  <br/>
<br/>
I know some people believe each soul chose their family and they need to<br/>
learn to work out their own interactions.  I think it&#39;s random, personally.<br/>
I don&#39;t think any one of my kids needs to be the material on which another<br/>
kid works out his karma unchecked anyway.<br/>
<br/>
So in the interest of helping them develop a set of alternative responses<br/>
and  social skills, and keeping them safe, I let each tell his story in<br/>
private  instead of in front of the other.  It cuts out arguments instead of<br/>
turning a  little argument into a big one (Jerry Springer show style, in<br/>
worst cases).   And it lets each kid vent to me about his frustrations about<br/>
the other one.   They NEED to express that.  Better to me than to friends<br/>
outside the family,  I think.  Because in this case they have a lot of<br/>
mutual friends.  It&#39;s to  the benefit of lots of people for them to be<br/>
sociably at peace.  And it lets  me commiserate with them about the flaws of<br/>
the sibling and to tell them how  hard it is to be a parent and to love both<br/>
kids but to see when one is being  hurt without me saying in front of one<br/>
&quot;Yeah, I know it can be a drag&quot; in  front of the other one.<br/>
<br/>
That might not be clear.  It&#39;s not that I&#39;ll say to Marty &quot;Yeah, Kirby<br/>
sucks,  doesn&#39;t he?&quot;  It&#39;s more like &quot;Marty, I really did want to have you.<br/>
I LOVE  you.  And things would be different if you were the oldest.  I&#39;m<br/>
sorry it  frustrates you.  But I was an oldest and there are disadvantages<br/>
to that  too.&quot;   It helps the relationship between me and each child for me<br/>
to be able  to discuss the emotions and reactions in some depth with them.<br/>
<br/>
On verbal abuse, one thing that has worked here is to remind them that it&#39;s<br/>
their own reputation and self/soul that they&#39;re hurting when they&#39;re mean.<br/>
If someone is cruel, it makes him a cruel person.  It might hurt the other<br/>
kid too, but it immediately hurts the one who was mean for meanness sake.<br/>
And it disturbs the peace of the others around them.  If two kids are<br/>
fighting, the other kid isn&#39;t having peace either.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  I wish you could get back to San Diego and to the situation you<br/>
had before.  I hope things get better for you soon.<br/>
