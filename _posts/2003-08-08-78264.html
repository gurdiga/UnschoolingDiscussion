&gt; I do know, though, that the boys love computer stuff.  Saw a program called<br/>
&gt; &quot;Phonics Tutor&quot; that is pretty pricy (90.00) but says it&#39;s a simple program<br/>
&gt; designed especially for kids who have had a lot of reading difficulties in the<br/>
&gt; past.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They all say that. As my 8 year old sapiently observed, &quot;Commercials lie.&quot;<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Read with them, play games like Silly Sentences (and you can make your own<br/>
of that type of game -- you basically have pronouns, nouns (subjects and<br/>
objects), adjectives, verbs, adverbs and spread them out randomly into<br/>
sentences that end up reading things like, &quot;A crocodile sat in a frog shoe.&quot;<br/>
Okay, so our family is easily amused. ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We play Hangman fairly often (on pieces of paper) and the kids like to <br/>
make up stories verbally where one person does each line and it gets <br/>
sillier and sillier. I write it down and then they will re-read it.<br/>
Computer games are great. The first thing Rhodri ever learned to spell <br/>
was &#39;pepperoni pizza&#39; as its a cheat code for Age of Empires ;-). This <br/>
Runescape game has been great for spelling and sentences. Dungeons and <br/>
Dragons could be recommended too. Not only is it fun, they write down <br/>
their characters attributes, get interested in the books and learn basic <br/>
arithmatic and percentages with the dice rolls.<br/>
