<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655908045">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list here and I found myself becoming a member during a <br/>
very spirited time!<br/>
<br/>
What a great group of strongly opinionated familys... of course with the <br/>
normal amount of misunderstandings when people with different belief <br/>
systems come together.<br/>
<br/>
Although I did already jump right in and respond to something, I&#39;d like <br/>
to take the time here to respond to a few issues - in one post.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, that was yesturday that I read the hoards of posts and my <br/>
memory for detail left me YEARS ago... heregoes...<br/>

**Spare the rod, spoil the child: this amazes me... a book that has been <br/>
translated from ancient tongues, that is full of meanings that are NOT to <br/>
be taken literally.. I find it interesting how people will find sources <br/>
to back up their beleifs. I do it to when it comes to my beleifs in <br/>
attachment parenting, family beds, extended nursing etc.<br/>
<br/>
I do remember reading an interpretation of this quote, and can&#39;t remember <br/>
the source. I&#39;ll make it a point to try and find it soon. The writer felt <br/>
that this too wasn&#39;t literal and explained what the word &#39;rod&#39; meant <br/>
(knowledge). Of course I don&#39;t beleive everything I read, but it was an <br/>
interesting outlook on something _I_ feel is brutal.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I do read the bible once a year, so I am familiar with it.<br/>

**Quantum Physics, snake oil, paradigms and truths: People get very <br/>
defensive when their beleif system is questioned, even when presented <br/>
with facts (such as thirmisol in vaccinations, pesticides in foods, etc).<br/>
<br/>
This is going to be a no-win conversation since each person needs to <br/>
decide for themself which truth works best for them or their family.<br/>
<br/>
I have a sister in quantumn healing (the WHO and the CDC still consult <br/>
her monthly) and a niece that oversees research for one of the biggest <br/>
drug companys. You can imagine how our holidays go! But we all walk away <br/>
with respect for eachother&#39;s beliefs. And the ones that are undecided, <br/>
get to hear both sides and decide for themselves.<br/>
<br/>

**Someone mentioned (again, I read a lot of posts!) something about a <br/>
&#39;newcomer&#39; to the list speaking their opinion.<br/>
<br/>
_I_ feel this is an unfortunate attitude to have about listservs.<br/>
<br/>
I have been using the internet since the mid 80s. Before the world wide <br/>
web and it was only command line interface back then. There was no GUI <br/>
and no help boxes and one had to know what they were doing to have a <br/>
discussion group. We used proggies like Hermes and ARPAnet for access. <br/>
Sometimes, it was dialup across the country just to learn something new <br/>
from the people writing the code. It was 99.9% men and there was still <br/>
mutual respect for the opinions of others.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I&#39;m concerned, most the world is &#39;new&#39; to listservs... and its <br/>
great that now we have even more people to communicate and share ideas <br/>
with. Isn&#39;t technology wonderful?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
**Children, chores and unparenting: I can see myself in so many of the <br/>
posts. And I can see where a lot of the differences lie.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, children will help as part of the household (here&#39;s the trick) when <br/>
BOTH the parents have a respect for the house.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a SUPPORTIVE partner, then unschooling will work no matter <br/>
what.<br/>
<br/>
If your partner isn&#39;t supportive, then you will be a frustrated person <br/>
and unschooling might be constant unwinding from the atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
Its very hard when someone who has a supportive partner to understand why <br/>
some people resond with anger and with frustration. They might not know, <br/>
or it was too long ago for them to remembe, how hard it is to feel so <br/>
isolated in your beleifs when everyone, I mean EVERYONE is pulling on <br/>
their life force telling them that they&#39;re wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Its also hard for someone without any kind of support network (just one <br/>
f2f erson at least!) to see how life flows easily when the support IS <br/>
there. This is a difficult mindset to be in, I hope we all have some sort <br/>
of patience for the pain involved here.<br/>
<br/>
