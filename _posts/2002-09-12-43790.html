Better to get the info. straight from the source.<br/>
It&#39;s inspirational for those of us just broaching the teen years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028982097">Ren.. Hello!!  Oh wow.. I don&#39;t even know if Laurie&#39;s old page is <br/>
still up. It was through the college. She has a new site and we have <br/>
a new one for the book. They&#39;re linked to each other. Our old <br/>
interview is still there under Media. There&#39;s a place at the bottom <br/>
where you can sign up to get updates on the book and our publishing <br/>
company, Unbounded Publications. Nothing on it yet, but I&#39;ll be <br/>
putting a message on there this week.<br/>
