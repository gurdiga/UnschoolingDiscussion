<div id="ygrps-yiv-926496499">Thanks, Amy for writing this. I was an only and I have an only (not<br/>
necessarily by choice). It is not so easy as most people think, yet I do<br/>
understand the challenges of having more than one (sibling fights, time for<br/>
everyone, etc.). The days I so wish we had more children are field trip<br/>
days and family vacations (my son loves to go places with other kids), days<br/>
when I need to clean house (he spends a lot of time alone those days), and<br/>
days when other kids are just not available to play (harder when<br/>
homeschooling because I have to actively search for potential playmates and<br/>
arrange playdates around the schedules of others). I have found that,<br/>
because I have only one, people assume that I will be able to arrange<br/>
events and make accommodations because I &quot;have so much free time&quot; (not<br/>
necessarily true!). Although I have spent a lot of time being his main<br/>
playmate in the past, as he has gotten older, I am not as much fun for him<br/>
as kids his age it seems. Now he really asks for other kids to play with<br/>
and this is a challenge for me to find them. On the other hand, with one<br/>
who is older (now 7), the packing for trips is a lot easier, we are more<br/>
mobile, and we are free to do things like bicycling and play tennis without<br/>
having to supervise younger siblings. <br/>
<br/>
I guess it is important to remember that all sizes of families have their<br/>
challenges and rewards.<br/>

&gt;I was an only and I have friends that have onlys and it&#39;s far more demanding<br/>
&gt;than you think. You are the main source of entertainment for the child. I<br/>
&gt;remember when my second became old enough to interact with my first. I felt<br/>
&gt;like a new person. They we&#39;re playing with each other and I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;constantly have to be entertaining her. I know moms of onlys that spend all<br/>
&gt;their time on the phone planning their kid&#39;s days. At least those of us with<br/>
&gt;more than one know that they&#39;ll always have someone to play with.<br/>
