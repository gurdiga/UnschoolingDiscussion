<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858053030">There has been some snarkiness lately intended to discourage or intimidate <br/>
some of the more confident people on this list.  I would like to ask that <br/>
those who are willing to write and share their families&#39; lives NOT be <br/>
intimidated into backing away from the invaluable help you&#39;re giving those <br/>
who come here asking for and wanting such help.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t come naturally to most people.<br/>
<br/>
There are people come here desperately hoping to find those whose lives are <br/>
better than theirs are, whose children are learning more happily and more <br/>
easily than their children are, who have a better handle on how unschooling <br/>
works.<br/>
<br/>
If, out of some odd sense of &quot;fairness&quot; or field-levelling we all begin to <br/>
say &quot;Gosh, my life is no better than yours,&quot; or  &quot;Gee, I don&#39;t know any more <br/>
than you do,&quot; or &quot;Golly, my ideas are no more valid than yours are&quot; then WHY <br/>
on earth would this list continue?  Are there REALLy people who will invest <br/>
time and money for strangers on the internet to validate and affirm their <br/>
total fear and confusion?<br/>
<br/>
If people go to a Christian site they&#39;ll read about Jesus.  If they look up <br/>
&quot;Tupperware&quot; they&#39;ll read about miracle plastics guaranteed for life.  If <br/>
they look for La Leche League they&#39;ll find a world of people who DO probably <br/>
know LOTS more than they know about breastfeeding (if those looking aren&#39;t <br/>
lactation consultants who have nursed seven babies already, at least two of <br/>
which had textbook-level problems).<br/>
<br/>
I hope for a long, long time people are able to come here and find people who <br/>
know more than they do about unschooling.  And I hope those who have the <br/>
experience and the confidence continue to be willing to share, and aren&#39;t <br/>
shamed into silence by snide put-downs.<br/>

hopefully giving and receiving support. I definitely don&#39;t think my life is <br/>
better than anyone&#39;s. . . simply not for me to make that judgement, nor are <br/>
my ideas more or less valid. I make plenty of mistakes as a parent, an <br/>
unschooler, a human being. There have been times in my life where I have <br/>
parented very differntly from where I am at now. . . .I am not better now, I <br/>
am simply different, I am choosing differently, which to me, is what life is <br/>
about, the ability to choose differently in any moment, and become more of <br/>
Who I Am. If I felt that others were giving me advice or support based on <br/>
what I call &quot;the betterness myth&quot;, then they would lose me. I hope (and know <br/>
I sometimes fail miserable) that I will not give advice in that manner. If I <br/>
do, I welcome being reminded of my words and beliefs. And it&#39;s fine for <br/>
others to disagree, in fact on this list, I would expect nothing less, but I <br/>
want to be clear about Who I Am in relation to this list and what I want to <br/>
be getting/giving in relation to it.<br/>

gone to school.  You&#39;re basing a large chunk of your life on it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There have been times in my life where I have <br/>
parented very differntly from where I am at now. . . .I am not better now, I <br/>
am simply different, I am choosing differently&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you didn&#39;t think it was better, why would you have changed?<br/>
<br/>
I think not spanking is better than spanking.  There are spankers who believe <br/>
that if they don&#39;t spank their children will pick the paddle up and whack <br/>
them!  That someone has to be in charge, and &quot;in charge&quot; involves physical <br/>
danger to one party or another.  I had a friend tell me once in front of <br/>
others that someday Kirby (who was four? five?) was going to grow up to hit <br/>
me.  She said that because I wasn&#39;t a spanking mom and he wasn&#39;t a <br/>
sit-in-the-corner-silently kid.  Now that both of us have teenagers, Kirby is <br/>
TOTALLY peaceable, and her child has struck her, I have heard from reliable <br/>
witnesses.  Are we both equally right?  <br/>
<br/>
If one family has a child crying every night and being sick every morning <br/>
over some stress, and another family has ideas to help them prevent that, I <br/>
hope they won&#39;t say, &quot;Well, who am I to say that crying is any worse than the <br/>
cheerful evenings at my house, and I&#39;m sure what you&#39;re doing is as good as <br/>
what I&#39;m doing, but...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand where the &quot;all choices are equal&quot; rhetoric has come from <br/>
in the past ten years or so, and why people would be proud to say they are <br/>
making no progress (and basically, by that belief, that progress cannot be <br/>
made).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m so glad you wrote that! I&#39;ve been sitting on this one a lot. I&#39;ve really <br/>
gotten into a lot of the debates on this list. And I&#39;ve really pointed a <br/>
finger at people telling them what I think about their stuff. And I&#39;ve really <br/>
been thinking about why I get on here and what I want to give to/get out of <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I want to connect with unschoolers too.  I&#39;m starting to think that pushing <br/>
truth is not as valuable as providing personal experience and truth and <br/>
allowing it to be taken or discarded.<br/>
<br/>
I am coming to trust my own process and growth. I make changes because I <br/>
believe, #1 they are an improvement and #2 I am ready to make the change. <br/>
There are many things that I would like to do differently in my own life, but <br/>
although I have all the information of why it&#39;s better, I have to allow <br/>
myself the time to adjust and change.  And when someone is telling me that <br/>
I&#39;m doing it wrong, and I need to change it, that process usually takes <br/>
longer. I tend to watch/read/learn about other people&#39;s stories and beliefs <br/>
and then say, hmmmm, they may have something. I want to know more about it.  <br/>
Yet sometimes, I think that I&#39;m different/better/special and not everyone can <br/>
do that, duh! <br/>
<br/>
I believe that sharing knowlege, sharing lives is just that.  This is really <br/>
a hypocritical post considering some of my previous posts, but hey, I&#39;m <br/>
learning and growing all the time, and this is where I&#39;m at now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t mean I think I am better because of that choice. It means I have <br/>
looked at all the options, listened to my instincts, and made this choice. <br/>
The choices I have made for myself and with those I love and call my family <br/>
could be disasterous for another. . . I am pretty sure they would be for my <br/>
SIL, however, I would never consider my family better than hers or anything <br/>
resembling that. I feel sadness sometimes for her kids because I see the <br/>
sadness in their eyes, but I am getting off track of what we are talking <br/>
about really. I don&#39;t consider where I am today better than where I was 5 <br/>
years ago. .. just different.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you didn&#39;t think it was better, why would you have changed?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

said, I don&#39;t think of it as better, just another choice. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t understand where the &quot;all choices are equal&quot; rhetoric has come <br/>

<br/>
It certainly isn&#39;t rhetoric for me in any fashion. .. it comes from the <br/>
belief system I have. I understand that we don&#39;t share the same belief system <br/>
and that is okay. We don&#39;t really need to debate the merits of what I and <br/>
others believe or don&#39;t believe. . . my/our/yours beliefs simply Are. They <br/>
could change tomorrow or they could stay the same for many years. I will <br/>
probably hold onto this one for quite a while, just like I will unschooling. <br/>
My instincts tell me so. And those I have learned to listen to, because they <br/>
don&#39;t fail me.<br/>

out/admit I was wrong, but when I get there on my own, it&#39;s very validating <br/>
and boosting to my confidence in my self and my process. I feel more relaxed <br/>
to live the way I see fit when I see that I will become aware of problems <br/>
if/when I need to be. Again, I want to allow that for others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750152052">LOL   ( snarkiness ?? )<br/>
I DO think my life is better than most people I know.  I DO think I have<br/>
found a better way to be a parent.  I DO think I have made better choices<br/>
for myself and my son.  <br/>
I realize I&#39;m lucky to be free to consider other possibilities and to<br/>
make different choices.  I know not everyone has this luxury.  I hope I<br/>
always see where I&#39;m making mistakes and I hope I&#39;m always brave enough<br/>
to fix them.  And I think THAT&#39;S  better than not seeing and not fixing. <br/>
I DO want to be a better mom, better wife, better person, better<br/>
gardener, better daughter.  I hope my son is a better person.  I hope he<br/>
contributes to a better world.  I hope we all find a way to be better<br/>
human beings.  <br/>
Better is better.   Unschooling is better.  Chocolate is better. <br/>

I don&#39;t get this frame of thought.  What&#39;s wrong with feeling some of <br/>
your choices are better than others?  For me, there are times I am <br/>
not sure if my choices are the best I could make.  Sometimes I KNOW I <br/>
could have made better choices, and then with things like unschooling <br/>
or breastfeeding, or staying at home with my kids, I KNOW  I have <br/>
made the right choice.  The best choice.  And I DO think these <br/>
choices would be best for ALL kids, though I don&#39;t believe all <br/>
parents are capable or wanting, so it wouldn&#39;t be their best choice.  <br/>
I respect all of my friends who send their kids to school and work, <br/>
or do school at home with them.  I don&#39;t think our choices are equal <br/>
though.<br/>
I think I have chosen better for my family.  If I didn&#39;t, why would I <br/>
do it? <br/>
And, I can feel all of this, without being a snob or rubbing it in <br/>
their faces.  But, if someone asks me my opinion about schooling, or <br/>
children, I will tell them what &quot;I&quot; think is best.<br/>

I certainly cannot make that distinction for someone else. The myth about <br/>
betterness promotes separation in our society. . . it puts us in and &quot;us <br/>
versus them&quot; mentality. It puts us at war with each other. It puts us in a <br/>
heiarchy. I personally choose to not live like that anymore. I don&#39;t want to <br/>
be or feel separateness from others because I feel I am better/above/more <br/>
evolved than someone. I also don&#39;t want to judge what I have done in the past <br/>
by saying what I do now is better. Because what I did in the past got me to <br/>
this point. . . the process is all as it should be. . . I needed those <br/>
experiences to get to this point and beyond. <br/>
<br/>
There is a wonderful passage from the book &quot;Conversations wtih God&quot; about the <br/>
betterness myth, and how it contributes to the way our society is and the <br/>
problems we face as a society. I will try and find it to post. <br/>
<br/>
One last point is that I have no desire to change anyone&#39;s beliefs about <br/>
this. . . what I do enjoy however, is explaining what I do believe and fine <br/>
tuning that. Thanks for all those giving me that opportunity. <br/>

<br/>
Some of those are better than others, in your judgment, must be.<br/>
<br/>
People share in their own tone of voice (ideally), and soem people like to <br/>
say &quot;You think you&#39;re superior&quot; as a way of saying &quot;I&#39;m not even going to <br/>
consider advice that&#39;s outside my comfort zone.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not horrible.  It just is.  <br/>
<br/>
What is harsh for some isn&#39;t for others.  What is &#39;gentle&#39; for some is <br/>
irritatingly sweet and worthless to others. <br/>
<br/>
So we can just read and like what we like and not like what we don&#39;t like.  I <br/>
understand the concepts of &quot;isness&quot; and being and non-duality.  It has its <br/>
uses for certain! But the monks who live there full time don&#39;t think that <br/>
eating pork is as good as eating rice, or that raping the neighbors is as <br/>
good as celibacy.<br/>
<br/>
I think the concept is taken too far and used as a shield from information or <br/>
analysis sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Just because there is more than one truth doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no such thing <br/>
as bullshit.  (I&#39;ve said that before and I stand by it because I know people <br/>
who are HORRIBLE with their kids and there ARE better ways to be.  And some <br/>
of them are NOT doing the best they can do, they have a veneer-thin overlay <br/>
of justification for child abuse, or they themselves are so hard-hearted and <br/>
cold that they don&#39;t see that their children are being harmed to the point <br/>
that they, those children, could become a danger to all of OUR children in <br/>
their frustration.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really fond of the agenda of this list being to support and encourage <br/>
unschooling and the clear thought and courageous self-analysis that I have <br/>
seen (in others&#39; lives as well as my own) that contribute to that much better <br/>
than a muddy flowing along without examination.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any beliefs or practices I&#39;m not willing to debate with others.  <br/>
If it won&#39;t survive light and air and inspection, I&#39;m MORE than willing to <br/>
dump it for a better practice or belief.<br/>
<br/>
I hope sharing strong opinions isn&#39;t to be judged worse than sharing any <br/>
other kinds of opinions.  And what kind of opinion would be &quot;not strong&quot;?  An <br/>
opinion someone would base child-rearing on?  Often people say &quot;I don&#39;t know <br/>
why I sent her to first grade.&quot;  They didn&#39;t have a strong opinion, they just <br/>
went with the flow, and when they come here and find enough ideas and support <br/>
to be brave enough to step out of the flow they feel better.  They think <br/>
their children *are* &quot;better&quot;--better than they were before, not  necessarily <br/>
better than everyone else&#39;s children in the whole wide world.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There is a wonderful passage from the book &quot;Conversations wtih God&quot; about <br/>
the <br/>
betterness myth, and how it contributes to the way our society is and the <br/>
problems we face as a society. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So that book is better than some other books you&#39;ve read?<br/>
His ideas are better than some of the people&#39;s here in the forum?<br/>
<br/>
I think John Holt&#39;s ideas are DAMNED good ones.  I think he&#39;s a better <br/>
resource than James Dobson or Gary Ezzo.  I think his ideas are better <br/>
because they honor children, and I think honoring children is better than <br/>
treating them as bundles of punishable sin.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the question and answer of the day from the author of Conversations <br/>
with God.  It&#39;s clear he thinks his stuff is better than some other (named) <br/>
stuff, and that it&#39;s good to promote what one believes is &quot;a good message.&quot;  <br/>
And the people writing here about unschooling have the dubious honor of doing <br/>
their promoting for free--donating their time to helping other moms.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dear Neale.....<br/>
I am one of those readers who recently discovered CWG by its falling off the <br/>
shelf onto my head--&quot;thank God!&quot; Actually, I have been on &quot;the path&quot; for a <br/>
number of years (lifetimes) and I have read many books from all angles, but I <br/>
must tell you that this book was (and continues to be) a real knockout. I <br/>
gobbled down the book over the Christmas holidays and have not been able to <br/>
read anything else since (very unlike my personal habit...). Anyway, I got to <br/>
thinking about this change in my behavior and began to wonder if others were <br/>
affected in the same manner. My question: Is this turning into a &quot;cult <br/>
thing&quot;??? The book really moved me in a profound way and it makes me happy <br/>
that sooo many people are &quot;searching&quot;, but it&#39;s beginning to look a little <br/>
&quot;slick&quot; with its having a Web Site, study groups, intensive workshops, etc. <br/>
I, like all the people out there who are getting involved, may be too <br/>
vulnerable and susceptible to its gravitational pull. Can you address these <br/>
questioning &quot;feelings&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
Tom S., <br/>
Blacksburg, VA. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dear Tom.....<br/>
I’m going to admit here to being a bit sensitive to your kind of question. I <br/>
notice I often get my &quot;hackles up&quot; when someone says something like this. Not <br/>
for long. Just for an instant. Still, my mother would say, &quot;Are you sure <br/>
that’s not because there’s a bit of truth to it?&quot; Somehow I don’t think so. <br/>
I think it’s because I just haven’t yet gotten over the reaction I have to <br/>
certain negative, unhealed thoughts which roam the universe. For instance, <br/>
the thought that to do something -- anything -- which gets the word out to a <br/>
larger audience about God’s magical, magnificent love is somehow besmirching <br/>
the message or despoiling the process. <br/>
<br/>
What I notice is that today even churches have web sites. It’s what’s <br/>
happening. A web site today is rapidly becoming like the telephone of <br/>
yesterday -- a simple, fast, expedient form of communication; an absolutely <br/>
essential apparatus; a means of getting and staying in touch. What’s &quot;wrong&quot; <br/>
with that? Why does having a web site suddenly render us &quot;slick&quot;? I think it <br/>
renders us smart. Does &quot;smart&quot; mean &quot;slick&quot;? If, in fact, our intention is to <br/>
help as many other people as possible hear more about, and benefit from, the <br/>
extraordinary message in Conversations with God, are we being too &quot;slick&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
We could, of course, simply surrender the mass media and the Internet to the <br/>
people who really are being slick; to the purveyors of silliness and <br/>
pornography; to the sellers of trinkets and the hawkers and gawkers...but <br/>
somehow it seems that it should be okay for people who have a good message to <br/>
send out, to also use these avenues of communication. What do you think? <br/>
<br/>
Now, about those Study Groups. We have had nothing to do with their <br/>
formation. They have been forming spontaneously all over the country and <br/>
around the world without any input or any request from us. Some of the groups <br/>
have written to us telling us of their existence, and asking us to let others <br/>
in their area know of their existence through our newsletter. We thought of <br/>
demanding that these groups disband at once because they would be seen as &quot;a <br/>
cult thing,&quot; but we dropped that idea as too reactionary... <br/>
<br/>
Finally, our workshops, seminars and 5-day intensives. Well, now, there you <br/>
have us, Tom. You’ve caught us red handed. Surely any organization or <br/>
movement based in fundamental truth and motivated by a sincere and pure <br/>
desire to simply share that truth in a way which it hoped would bring help to <br/>
others, would never hold a class or a retreat or a workshop. It is shameful. <br/>
It does have a high sleaze factor. It is &quot;slick,&quot; there’s no question about <br/>
it. Imagine, holding an actual 5-day retreat to help people get more closely <br/>
in touch with the powerful message in this extraordinary book. We should have <br/>
known better than to try to get away with something like this. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, Tom, Tom...I guess I should stop with the humor already (I suppose some <br/>
would call it sarcasm) and just address your question head on. Tom, Tom...the <br/>
whole point of Conversations with God is that we are each responsible for <br/>
ourselves. You talk about you and all the other people out there who are <br/>
&quot;getting involved&quot; in CWG being &quot;too vulnerable and susceptible&quot; for its <br/>
&quot;gravitational pull.&quot; Do you seriously advance this as a reason for us to <br/>
stay off the web, prohibit study groups, and never give another workshop? <br/>
Shall we make ourselves responsible for you, Tom, and make sure we don’t do <br/>
anything that might &quot;pull you into our clutches&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a better way for us to proceed, Tom, is to put together a program and <br/>
make information available which teaches people how to stop being so <br/>
&quot;vulnerable and susceptible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As my teenager would say...&quot;Now there’s a concept!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be. <br/>

more time. . . this is my belief system and how I try to live my life. You <br/>
can try and persuade me or show me ways this is &quot;not correct&quot; for days. It <br/>
won&#39;t change my thinking or belief. The only person who can do that is me. <br/>
And since my instincts or what I like to call my godself has led me to these <br/>

you would very clearly know this is not at all what he believes. You can <br/>
always find a way to take things out of context and take a snippet of <br/>
something to prove yourself right. We all can. It doesn&#39;t change anything <br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;No it is not clear at all. .  . if you took the time to read the whole <br/>
book, <br/>
you would very clearly know this is not at all what he believes. You can <br/>
always find a way to take things out of context and take a snippet of <br/>
something to prove yourself right. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First, WHICH book?  He wrote lots of them.<br/>
<br/>
And that wasn&#39;t out of context--it was the entirity of a web page marked <br/>
&quot;today&quot; (and there are other daily and weekly things there).    I didn&#39;t pull <br/>
a single line or paragraph, I sent the whole thing AND the link.  It&#39;s not <br/>
out of context at all.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s changed his mind since he wrote that book.  Or maybe his ideas are <br/>
broader than the one quote which was to be put here to defend the idea that <br/>
there are not better or worse things.<br/>
<br/>
Neale Walsch clearly thinks his stuff if worthy of publication, purchase, a <br/>
website, and of being regarded as possible truth.  Why is it virtue for him <br/>
and sin for people here?<br/>

&gt;Here&#39;s the question and answer of the day from the author of Conversations<br/>
&gt;with God.  It&#39;s clear he thinks his stuff is better than some other (named)<br/>

good for some families.  I know I wouldn&#39;t do it, but I can&#39;t really say <br/>
it&#39;s because my way is better, just better for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589558891">Congrats, Lovemary!  It is so hard for some folks to let go of being<br/>
judgemental and I don&#39;t mean simply of others but of their own lives as well<br/>
and to stop equating change, growth, and different with better.<br/>
<br/>
To look at everything as a journey, the past as the foundation of your<br/>
future, changes as growth and those changes as a step in that journey, not<br/>
necessarily as &quot;better&quot; but as &quot;different&quot; because of where you are in your<br/>
journey is hard for some.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is all about the individual, trusting the individual to know<br/>
themselves, their wants, their needs and that individuality should be<br/>
celebrated and shared.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read too many books with &quot;God&quot; in their title as that is not part<br/>
of our spirituality.  However, I am getting a different take on this book<br/>
after reading your thoughts about it.  Guess I&#39;ll give it a glance or two.<br/>
<br/>
I think you did a great job of explaining!<br/>
<br/>
Lynda<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>
&gt; For me personally, I am on the list to interact with other unschoolers,<br/>
&gt; hopefully giving and receiving support. I definitely don&#39;t think my life<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; better than anyone&#39;s. . . simply not for me to make that judgement,<br/>
&gt; nor are my ideas more or less valid. I make plenty of mistakes as a<br/>
parent,  an unschooler, a human being. There have been times in my life<br/>
where I<br/>
&gt; have parented very differntly from where I am at now. . . .I am not<br/>
better<br/>
&gt; now, I am simply different, I am choosing differently, which to me, is<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; life is about, the ability to choose differently in any moment, and become<br/>
&gt; more of  Who I Am. If I felt that others were giving me advice or support<br/>
based on  what I call &quot;the betterness myth&quot;, then they would lose me. I hope<br/>
&gt; (and know I sometimes fail miserable) that I will not give advice in that<br/>
&gt; manner. If I do, I welcome being reminded of my words and beliefs. And<br/>
it&#39;s fine  for others to disagree, in fact on this list, I would expect<br/>
nothing  less,<br/>
&gt; but I want to be clear about Who I Am in relation to this list and what I<br/>
&gt; want to be getting/giving in relation to it.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; lovemary<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Because for me they simply are not &quot;better&quot;. They are the choices I make<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; I certainly cannot make that distinction for someone else. The myth about<br/>
&gt; betterness promotes separation in our society. . . it puts us in and &quot;us<br/>
&gt; versus them&quot; mentality. It puts us at war with each other. It puts us in a<br/>
&gt; heiarchy. I personally choose to not live like that anymore. I don&#39;t want<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; be or feel separateness from others because I feel I am better/above/more<br/>
&gt; evolved than someone. I also don&#39;t want to judge what I have done in the<br/>
past<br/>
&gt; by saying what I do now is better. Because what I did in the past got me<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; this point. . . the process is all as it should be. . . I needed those<br/>
&gt; experiences to get to this point and beyond.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is a wonderful passage from the book &quot;Conversations wtih God&quot; about<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; betterness myth, and how it contributes to the way our society is and the<br/>
&gt; problems we face as a society. I will try and find it to post.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One last point is that I have no desire to change anyone&#39;s beliefs about<br/>
&gt; this. . . what I do enjoy however, is explaining what I do believe and<br/>
fine<br/>
&gt; tuning that. Thanks for all those giving me that opportunity.<br/>

How would I enforce it?  ALL I can do is offer information and clarify what <br/>
I&#39;ve said.<br/>
But I know more than what I personally have discovered along the way with my <br/>
own kids.  I&#39;ve discovered lots of other families along the way, too.  And <br/>
not just successful families, but families in which they *kind of* <br/>
half-heartedly tried and then gave up.  I think that information is sometimes <br/>
more valuable than the successful families.<br/>
