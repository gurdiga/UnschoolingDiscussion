&lt;&lt; The question was around the<br/>
 fear that the mother had that if she didn&#39;t have some requirements for<br/>
 her child with his education he would one day grow up and still be<br/>
 waiting for an interest in something to speak, and meanwhile, be laying<br/>
 on the couch drinking beer and playing video games. I can understand<br/>
 that fear. What would you have said to this woman? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would have asked her why SHE didn&#39;t sit around all day drinking beer and <br/>
watching video games....after all, she has free choice about what to do with <br/>
her life.<br/>
That isn&#39;t a very appealing option to most people. The people that live that <br/>
way are probably trying to escape some misery in life.<br/>
All I have to do is look at a toddler and know that humans are born with an <br/>
intense desire to learn, to figure out the world around them.<br/>
The only things that can halt that process, is meanness, forced learning or <br/>
some kind of brain damage. Humans are wired this way.<br/>
I would say she needs to trust her children more, trust their innate desire <br/>
to learn and look at her own life and ask why she (and other adults) don&#39;t <br/>
just sit around all day with no purpose.<br/>

But she somehow seems to think it&#39;s because she went to school! <br/>

taking guns to heaven and shooting God. Which was WAY naughty for someone <br/>

<br/>
Only those raised that way COULD have such daydreams, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Although I had three bad dreams last week, which hadn&#39;t happened for a long <br/>
time (they were vague SCA situations of people not being reliable, not <br/>
nightmares), two nights ago I had a really good little dream that I was <br/>
watching a tiny Eagles concert, kind of a house concert, or like at a coffee <br/>
shop.  Something happened, one of them was sick or late or something after a <br/>
break, and so they put on Jackson Browne to tide us over until the Eagles <br/>
came back on.  <br/>
<br/>
THAT is the kind of dream I would like to have all the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118906671">Just wanted to share...<br/>
Our day started out with clearing off the deck so the kids could ride their bikes and play.  Kiele (4)  grabbed a rake and started to rake the leaves off of the deck, Nicholas(4) and Michael (2) ( the 2 boys I watch) were just dropped off, Michael played cars with 11 month old crew, while Nicholas grabbed a broom and swept the dirt, bird seed and leaves off.  They did this on their own, they wanted to be a part of making the deck look nice so they could play on it.  After we were done, the kids played on the swingset while I hosed the deck off.  I nursed Crew to sleep then started to fix the driveway ( it was all rutted with mud and tire marks so I tore it up and filled it in and tamped it down)  whoo, now where was I?  Oh and more mud the 3 kids enjoyed playing in the gloopy gloppy mud and squishy ishy mud puddle!  Before long they had taken off there boots and were squishing around in it in their bare feet.  They had a blast throwing rocks into the puddle to see them sink, Kiele found a plastic toy and was surprised to see that it floated, and told me so!  Nicholas was curious to see if there were bugs in the mud and examined it  for some...after the mud incident kiele, Nicholas, and Michael all jumped in the tub with bathing suits on and of course lots of bubbles to wash and scrub all that mud!  we just had the best day enjoying the  sunshine and mud today!<br/>

Who happens to find that mud can be fun!<br/>
