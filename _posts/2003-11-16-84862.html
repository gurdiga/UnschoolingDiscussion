<br/>
By *we* I meant the unschooling community as a whole.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;re out <br/>
there.  I know of two offhand, and if I know of two I&#39;m assuming there must be <br/>
lots.  Perhaps a flawed assumption.  (Wouldn&#39;t be my first.)<br/>
<br/>
So, Moon, what is it?  Do you want a teen unschoolers&#39; list?  Shall we try to <br/>
track one down for you?<br/>
