<br/>
The thread may be old to you.  I was responding to post that came through my<br/>
digest since the last time I checked all my digests which was yesterday.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know how you receive your mails.<br/>
<br/>
I was not talking about Bridget.  I was making a generalization.  It is my<br/>
understanding that several people have talked quite recently on this list<br/>
about perceiving their children having difficulty controlling their behavior<br/>
in regards to television, computer games, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know all about Bridget.  I have been on this list since before she<br/>
showed up.  Again, I was not talking about any one person on this list, but<br/>
about behaviors in general.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-886691569">&lt;&lt;Do you wake them up in the morning at a certain time&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Only on Sundays when we go to church at 8:00am.<br/>
<br/>
The oldest sets her alarm for about 8 because her goats get very loud<br/>
wanting to be fed.  All the other kids wake up naturally between 6:30 and<br/>
8:00.<br/>
