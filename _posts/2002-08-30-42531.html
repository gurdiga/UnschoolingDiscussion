when he was in college. Near my house, Pete Tavita Solomona, 47, was arrested <br/>
on Oct. 18, for the fatal shooting of Brandon Ketsdever, a 17-year-old. <br/>
Brandon and some friends had, as a prank, swiped a plastic Halloween <br/>
decoration from Solomona&#39;s front yard. Solomona&#39;s defense was that he was <br/>
just threatening the boys when he held the gun up to Brandon&#39;s head and that <br/>
he didn&#39;t mean to pull the trigger of his 357 magnum. <br/>

<br/>
Have you ever held a real gun?  There is no way NOT to register the<br/>
difference between a toy and the real thing.  No one is advocating leaving<br/>
weapons lying around, but there is no way a child can think that a toy gun<br/>
and a real gun are the same.  Doesn&#39;t mean a child might not play with a<br/>
real gun if he/she came across it...but they wouldn&#39;t confuse it with their<br/>
toy.<br/>
