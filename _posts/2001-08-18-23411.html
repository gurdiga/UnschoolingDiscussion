&lt;&lt; My daughter, for months, experienced severe burning after using the potty. <br/>
We <br/>
 had several cultures done, yeast tests, etc., and NOTHING showed up. It was <br/>
 horrid.<br/>
 Finally we were referred to Children&#39;s Hospital in Philly. She&#39;s fine today, <br/>
 because of the advice they gave us. They said that her labia tended to stick <br/>
 together, and the pH of the urine was burning her skin. The remedy? Face the <br/>
 toilet and go to the bathroom. Can you believe it? All those tests, and <br/>
 needing to go to CHOPs to see a specialist, and they say turn around and <br/>
face <br/>
 the toilet the other way...<br/>

    Does your dd sound words out also? I feel this is important and I want to <br/>
pass it along to my dd.<br/>

anything that I know of.  He just sees it.  Daughter sounds out a lot things <br/>
-- and then we have to have the discussion about how silly and wasteful it is <br/>
to have these &quot;silent&quot; letters -- she feels this is a waste of ink!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Children will (and will need to) learn phonics<br/>
eventully, but what I have read suggests that it would<br/>
be wrong to attempt to teach phonics before the age of<br/>
about 8.  Most children just don&#39;t have the capacity<br/>
much before that time. I&#39;ve taken a few graduate<br/>
school courses on early reading development, and even<br/>
though they were meant for pubic school teachers, they<br/>
taught that there was great danger in introducing<br/>
phonics as early as most pubic schools do.  They say<br/>
children will loose their natural desire to read if<br/>
phonics is introduced before the child is ready. <br/>
Think of it this way: when you read do you sound out<br/>
the words or are you mostly a sight reader? <br/>
