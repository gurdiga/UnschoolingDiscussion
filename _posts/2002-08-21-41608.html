&gt;floral dept. of craft stores. (Sometimes people put them in the botton of <br/>
&gt;vases to hold up artificial flowers.)  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Damage counters.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, these are bigger than damage counters. They&#39;re about an inch and a <br/>
quarter across.<br/>

Speaking of gaming kids though, Conor has been participating in his first <br/>
D&D games these past few weekends. He&#39;s playing with several of our adult <br/>
friends and I&#39;m in unschooling mom heaven. :o) The amount of thinking, <br/>
imagining, creativity, math, writing, and who knows what else is amazing. Oh <br/>
yeah, he&#39;s liking it too. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Our friends told us that they are all going to chip in to get Conor an <br/>
&quot;apprentice geek&quot; t-shirt.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
