First of all, I have to clarify something....I&#39;ve written posts to you in the last month or so thinking you were a different Heidi!! So if I posted something that didn&#39;t make sense, forgive me, I thought you were the Heidi I met at the conference. duh.<br/>
<br/>
About the Don/tv issue. I am the same way! I get very, very absorbed into anything I&#39;m interested in and it&#39;s very difficult to get my attention. If I&#39;m watching a movie, I get very irritated when someone tries to talk to me or needs me to move my focus, it&#39;s just how I am. I&#39;ve learned to pause for the kids, but it still takes them a while to get me to be aware that anyone is even in the room. Same with books, same with writing, same with art, same with anything I&#39;m really enjoying at the moment.<br/>
And walking into a store and watching for five whole minutes? Sorry, I just didn&#39;t think that sounded very addictive at all. I find tv very interesting. If a person was in school, they were not unlimited in their tv viewing. Nor does it sound like his folks offered the rich environment or interest in him that we, as unschoolers are advocating.<br/>
Two nights ago dh and I were having some alone time to talk about some things. He had the tv muted and I kept getting distracted and watching it, even without sound!! We finally had to turn it off so I could talk without getting distracted.<br/>
This behavior does not harm my life or anyone else in my life. It&#39;s just a tendency some people have. I think it&#39;s a good attribute in many ways, I can focus on a project intensely when I need to get something done. It&#39;s kinda nice to be neurotic sometimes. :)<br/>

My friend Cathyn gets drawn in by TV sports.  We used to eat out together <br/>
once a week, and he would have to sit where he couldn&#39;t see a TV so we could <br/>
talk, but he was glad to do it, just had to remember.<br/>
<br/>
Yet Cathyn can work on an engine or car breaks for hours. <br/>
He does computer hardware installations.  He&#39;s able to REALLY CARE about <br/>
wires and grounds and outlets and all that for hours on end.<br/>
<br/>
He can cook a long complicated meal and not want to just quit halfway through <br/>
and do something altogether different.  I can&#39;t.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287621330">Hi Ren<br/>
<br/>
yeah, I think you mentioned meeting Heidi at the conference...wadn&#39;t <br/>
me. Unfortunately. there is a Heidi D/W who posts here and at the <br/>
other yahoo unschool list...<br/>
<br/>
As I was writing about Don, I did put in a little side note &quot;spare <br/>
time&quot; I recognize that a man who didn&#39;t HAVE much spare time, didn&#39;t <br/>
REALLY get all the TV he wanted, as a kid...See, I talked myself into <br/>
a different position altogether, as I wrote that post! LOL<br/>
<br/>
I get focused, too, but not that badly in tv. But let me encounter a <br/>
new idea and you can forget it. Everything else goes by the wayside, <br/>
for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
Could be, I&#39;m just getting impatient. Wanting to see the passions <br/>
arise. (I know, I KNOW...computer games can be a passion...I know all <br/>
the answers...just got to get them incorporated...argh...<br/>
<br/>
Must Shift Paradigm  Must Shift Paradigm<br/>
<br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your insights!<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>
<br/>
oh, one thing: <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And walking into a store and watching for five whole minutes? <br/>
&gt;Sorry, I just didn&#39;t think that sounded very addictive at all. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>walking into a store while out on a date, with an interesting and <br/>
engaging woman ;)...seriously, we were heading into that grocery <br/>
store to get finger foods, to go up in the woods for a picnic date. I <br/>
mean, we had an objective in mind; we were busy chatting, talking <br/>
about something. We entered the store, I turned toward the produce <br/>
section, and Don wasn&#39;t there! He had stopped at the entrance where <br/>
the TV was sitting, and was standing there gazing at it! <br/>
<br/>
THAT sounds a little strange, maybe not addictive, but...???...to me.<br/>
<br/>

You&#39;re doing ok Heidi...:)<br/>
If it makes you feel any better, the tv/video game thing was one of the most difficult shifts for me to make. I would do alright for a bit, then something would trigger the resentment and fears and I&#39;d have to come post a bit and hear from Sandra, Joyce, Anne, Pam, Kelly etc...to get back on track.<br/>
One of the best bits of advice they gave was to get INVOLVED in what my kids were fascinated with. That ended up being a fabulous tool for both getting connected and also seeing the learning that was taking place constantly.<br/>
I don&#39;t worry anymore. I do get annoyed with constant noise and when this happens I just ask them to either turn it really low or ask if there is something else we can do for a while.<br/>
Usually they&#39;re very open to &quot;quiet times&quot; because they aren&#39;t limited anymore. <br/>
