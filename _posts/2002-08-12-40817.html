<div id="ygrps-yiv-461172864"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;And Mary, I love your tagline.  I need reminders (see Joyce&#39;s question <br/>
&gt;&gt;about changing subjects!).  Yours is a good reminder.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks. I added that line after two of my brother&#39;s died. They gave me so <br/>
much in life. Their early death was a reminder to me to enjoy the good life <br/>
I have. :o) It also helps me to remember not to be snarky online. It&#39;s hard <br/>
to be really rude and then sign off life is good.It just doesns&#39;t flow for <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
