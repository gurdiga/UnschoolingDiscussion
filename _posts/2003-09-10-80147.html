<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960737658">John Taylor Gatto, from The Underground History of American Education:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Full literacy wasn&#39;t unusual in the colonies or early republic; many<br/>
schools wouldn&#39;t admit students who didn&#39;t know reading and counting<br/>
because few schoolmasters were willing to waste time teaching what was<br/>
so easy to learn. It was deemed a mark of depraved character if<br/>
literacy hadn&#39;t been attained by the matriculating student. Even the<br/>
many charity schools operated by churches, towns, and philanthropic<br/>
associations for the poor would have been flabbergasted at the great<br/>
hue and cry raised today about difficulties teaching literacy.<br/>
American experience proved the contrary.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In New England and the Middle Atlantic Colonies, where reading was<br/>
especially valued, literacy was universal. The printed word was also<br/>
valued in the South, where literacy was common, if not universal. In<br/>
fact, it was general literacy among all classes that spurred the<br/>
explosive growth of colleges in nineteenth-century America, where even<br/>
ordinary folks hungered for advanced forms of learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more. You can read the chapter here:<br/>

LOL! Been there, done that. Sorry, I don&#39;t have the info you seek, but just wanted to say &#39;good for you&#39; for sticking to your guns. I do it all the time and although the results aren&#39;t always pleasant, I know I&#39;d feel worse if I just said &quot;okay, let&#39;s leave it at that&quot;. Hope you find your info!<br/>

Have you ever stopped to think that, for some people, for a myriad of<br/>
reasons, it is actually better that they go to school than stay at home? For<br/>
some adults, having children at home all day and everyday, takes more<br/>
patience and love and understanding than they have to give. I know of two<br/>
mothers who, whilst they love their kids and would defend them to the hilt,<br/>
would be in the looney bin by the end of the week and their kids in care if<br/>
they weren&#39;t in school. And what about the people who have to go out to<br/>
work? Public schools aren&#39;t all great, some have some very good bits, some<br/>
have some very bad bits: a lot just muddle along okay - a bit like the rest<br/>
of us.<br/>

 So, are you saying it&#39;s better for the kids or the parents? <br/>
I am one of those parents who is much more at peace, I guess you could say, when I am on my own. I doubt many parents could *honestly* say they find having a kazillion kids around all day to be restful or relaxing. It&#39;s our job and our responsibility to find within ourselves the patience and understanding to be with our kids all day. Isn&#39;t it funny, when they&#39;re babies, we can&#39;t stand the thought of leaving them, and then they get older and we can&#39;t wait to ship &#39;em off to school!<br/>

I&#39;ve actually thought that a few women in our hs group should just send their <br/>
kids to school, to avoid being *the bad guy* all the time.  If it hurts this <br/>
much to have them home, then send them away.  ME, I&#39;d rather figure out a way <br/>

patience and love and understanding than they have to give. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t going to work for everyone, but who will it help if that&#39;s <br/>
our starting point?<br/>
<br/>
There are people who DO have patience and understanding (of a sort) who DO <br/>
want to unschool who can&#39;t get it to work well for some reason(s), and so we <br/>
have lists like this to try to help them get it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I know of two<br/>
<br/>
mothers who, whilst they love their kids and would defend them to the hilt,<br/>
<br/>
would be in the looney bin by the end of the week and their kids in care if<br/>
<br/>
they weren&#39;t in school. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know MY mom was way more interested in using school for a babysitter so she <br/>
could have some kid-free time to smoke and drink and mess around in the yard <br/>
and visit her friends.  There is a full range of reasons why some moms would <br/>
&quot;be in the looney bin&quot; if their kids were home, and much of that range is <br/>
selfishness and acceptance of the cultural messages that school is GREAT for moms <br/>
who would have no peace or sanity if it weren&#39;t for the big yellow bus coming <br/>
to save them.<br/>
<br/>
What about the pain of the kids IN the bus, the schoolyard, the schoolroom, <br/>
the cafeteria, the P.E. field, etc.?   <br/>
<br/>
I know there are kids for whom school is safer and better than home, but <br/>
that&#39;s nothing to brag up and encourage!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And what about the people who have to go out to work?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I had to go to work and couldn&#39;t afford a better plan, I might use school <br/>
as a babysitter, but I would NOT invest my heart&#39;s hopes and plans in school <br/>
teaching my kids morals and compassion, or keeping them safe and happy.  I <br/>
would see it as a state-run babysitting service replete with abuse and shaming for <br/>
anyone who&#39;s not immune.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Public schools aren&#39;t all great, some have some very good bits, some<br/>
<br/>
have some very bad bits: a lot just muddle along okay - a bit like the rest<br/>
<br/>
of us.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some of the rest of us dedicate our energy and thought and lives to doing the <br/>
very best we can do, treating our children like real people, not inferior <br/>
grubs who are preparing for the real world.   Not too many schools would even <br/>
consider THINKING of putting kids first.<br/>

&lt;&lt; That&#39;s why (although I DID hesitate {at Sandra&#39;s request}) I printed the <br/>
bumper sticker that says, &quot;If you DON&#39;T WANT to read this, thank a teacher!&quot;  <br/>
Later on after the conference weekend, Sandra DID let it slip that it was <br/>
growing <br/>
on her! &lt;BWG&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Two things:<br/>
<br/>
I think my obnoxious suggestion was &quot;...blame a teacher.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The gaming store where Kirby works has the original &quot;real&quot; bumpersticker IN <br/>
THE WINDOW, with the other really horrible-but-funny <br/>
gamer/SCA/StarTrek/pagan/geek humorous bumper stickers, FIVE RACKS of them, but there it is, the stupid <br/>
&quot;If you can read this, thank a teacher.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
YUCK!<br/>
<br/>
I asked Kirby whether it didn&#39;t bother him, since he learned to read without <br/>
a teacher.  Two other bumper stickers have been withdrawn because employees <br/>
(one Kirby, one a female occasional employee) objected to the message.  Kirby&#39;s <br/>
objected to one about bombing Paris instead of Baghdad.  He wouldn&#39;t even set <br/>
it out, and an employee meeting discussed and upheld his decision.  The other, <br/>
I don&#39;t remember.  I&#39;m sorry to see they have the &quot;thank a teacher&quot; thing, <br/>
but Kirby said he didn&#39;t care that much one way or the other, and I don&#39;t work <br/>
there, so fine.<br/>
<br/>
Holly put one (the new one Kelly printed) on the door to her room, so I see <br/>
it every day now.  SCARY!<br/>

We went by the Harris County Dept. of Ed. (which doesn&#39;t have any <br/>
schools BTW) and it had one of the big signs that said &quot;If you can <br/>
read this, thank a teacher&quot;.  We all looked at each other and <br/>
laughed.  Of the six people in the car only one learned to read from <br/>
a teacher!<br/>

I asked my cousin to print me a shirt that reads:<br/>
<br/>
       I am not ADHD, you just aren&#39;t interesting enough to pay attention to!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say ADHD is non-existant, but at the rate todays kids are being <br/>
labeled, I have no doubt I would be one if I were in school today!<br/>

<br/>
No kidding.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid it was &quot;hyperactive&quot; (or in the absence of &quot;hyper,&quot; just <br/>
&quot;doesn&#39;t pay attention in class/disturbs others&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
The difference between A students who were hyperactive and D/F students who <br/>
were hyperactive (and I didn&#39;t see many B/C students who had that &quot;problem&quot;) <br/>
was that the good students got sympathy because the poor things were bored, and <br/>
the bad students got punishment and badmouthing, which never helped.<br/>
