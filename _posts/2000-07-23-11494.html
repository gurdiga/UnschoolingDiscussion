<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I don&#39;t remember how it happened but somehow today 
we started talking about the planets. An idea occurred to me to make a model of 
the solar system and hang it from the ceiling. The idea was to use balloons and 
paper mache to make the solar system and then paint them and hang them from the 
ceiling in our learning room. Has anyone done this and if so do you have any 
suggestions as to the best way to go about this. Oh, of course we will talk 
about each of the planets as we are making them, and the sun too. Also, if 
anyone knows of any good sites on the solar system with activies geered toward 3 
and 5 year olds I would also appreciate that info. I have looked on the net but 
so far I can only find things for older children.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,
