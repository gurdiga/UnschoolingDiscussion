Well there you go. <br/>
<br/>
When my son was born my midwives had delivered over 500 babies without<br/>
any complications to the mothers or infants.    That&#39;s astounding and no<br/>
doctor could say the same thing.<br/>
The reason my midwives could is because they only took clients who were<br/>
in perfect health, and if complications developed during pregnancy they<br/>
referred their moms to doctors who could deal with those complications.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Statistics for medical procedures are like that.    Almost no general<br/>
practitioners loose a patient during brain surgery, but dang it, brain<br/>
surgeons do at a much higher rate.   How &#39;bout that?  <br/>

Well, I just voted, what can I say, and I&#39;m now struggling to get that<br/>
stupid &quot;my vote counted&quot; sticker out of my hair!!!      <br/>

Deb L, who knows for certain 47.2 percent of all statistics are made up<br/>
on the spot.</div>
