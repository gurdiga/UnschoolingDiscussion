<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714202160">This swimming discussion made a lightbulb go off in my head - Being new at unschooling... I still sometimes feel that I am not doing my job! - we won&#39;t get into that - preconcieved notions and all that baggae...<br/>
<br/>
In any case, my daughter who is 8 swims great - I would never have dreamed of giving my kids swimming lessons. Why? Becuase I learned by swimming all summer in my pool with my dad - who was a teacher and off for the summer. It was just natural - It was hot and swimming was fun... I just learned as I went. It is the same thing that has happened with my kids. Now my younger two - obviously are not at that point - but they are now starting to want to try without their swimmies - and swimming underwater seems to come first for them.  - My sil put her baby in those swimming lessons thinking if she then fell into the pool she would swim - she is still afraid of the water! <br/>
<br/>
My whole point of this is - I didn&#39;t DO anything - teach the swimming; she just did it. I feel the same about her reading - however- every September I start to feel a little nervous about the fact that everyone is getting ready for school - even the other homeschoolers all ask - &quot;so what curriculm are you doing?&quot;  and I start to consider - well maybe I&#39;ll have some sort of plan.... The problem is life gets so busy! I am so afraid I will neglect some educational moment! I am taking college classes myself and my kids go to their grandma&#39;s two afternoons a week - They are plastered to the television because they have &quot;the dish&quot; and we don&#39;t ;) I get a little worried that I am neglecting my role in the process... they are not watching ther history channel or A&E or anything - but Spongebob - and Playhouse Disney etc.  - I know I&#39;ve read the virtues of these discussed on the list ;) <br/>
<br/>
In any case, the swimming made me go ahhhh - so this may be working after all! Thanks!<br/>

  &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m often asked where Casey took swimming lessons. Parents seem to have a hard time blieving that she learned to swim by going with me to the pool and being in the water. It&#39;s odd how things have turned around so. My parents <br/>
  would never have thought to put me in swim lessons. That was what my older brothers were there for, to show me how to swim. ;-)&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m thinking 9 is a good age for swimming lessons :-) Rain already knew how to dog paddle around, and float, and have tea parties on the bottom of the pool, and stuff like that, just from being in the water all the time... but she wanted to learn to swim actual strokes, and I wasn&#39;t doing very well at showing her (maybe because I&#39;m not very good at it). So she&#39;s been having private lessons with an 18 yr old former hser and current college sophomore, and it&#39;s been wonderful. They talk about what she wants to learn, he knows swimming inside and out and can break every skill down into the tiniest parts, if need be. He knows all sorts of little tricks to help her refine the techniques. She enjoys it a lot, and he&#39;s talked about how much faster she learns than the 5 yr olds he teaches - probably mostly because she&#39;s not 5. <br/>
<br/>
  I also think she would have been fine paddling around the rest  of her life, she didn&#39;t *need* to know the freestyle and the backstroke and the breastroke. But she wanted to, and I didn&#39;t know them all.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m thinking of signing her up for singing lessons for the same reason- she wants to know stuff that I don&#39;t know (she told me I sing alto, which was news to me) and learning something like that from an actual person sounds much easier than trying to do it from a book.<br/>

and if she felt like swimming, she try, and if she couldn&#39;t do it, she <br/>
could simply put her feet down and be safe.<br/>

That makes sense - we take gymnastics becuase the facilities are there as well as those who have the know - how...<br/>
