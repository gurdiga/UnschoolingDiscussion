<div id="ygrps-yiv-853300847">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have been remembering what my mother told me about what happened<br/>
when she was growing up and she and/or her brothers and sisters<br/>
got into fights....  (You will laugh at this, but it works!!)<br/>
<br/>
Whatever two kids (or more) were in the midst of a fight or<br/>
disagreement,<br/>
their mom would give them some rags and soapy water and set them to<br/>
washing the windows  - one on the outside and the other on the <br/>
inside.  This was supposed to be punishiment - and perhaps in a way<br/>
it was,....but before long, they would be making faces at each other<br/>
and laughing together - their fight all forgotten!!  I think my<br/>
grandmother was one smart lady!!!  I know she was.....I loved her<br/>
very much and miss her more than words can say!  My mom, too!<br/>
