<div id="ygrps-yiv-701229573">&lt;&lt; If you&#39;re really looking at yurts, we liked Pacific Yurts and Nesting Bird <br/>
<br/>
Yurts the best.  I&#39;ve heard Pacific yurts are pretty nice tho. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they are. We just received Pacific Yurts information packet in the mail. <br/>
They are quite nice. I&#39;m leaning more towards that but DH has been stuck for <br/>
years on cord wood. We couldn&#39;t do the stained glass effect on the cabin as <br/>
you can&#39;t cut into the logs but for the cord wood you can cut into it and take <br/>
two colored glass bottles end to end, wrap them in aluminum sheeting like a <br/>
cylinder and cement them in like log. It&#39;s pretty neat and economical and looks <br/>
like a stained glass window and not glass end bottles!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;d love to see a pic of your log cabin!  That&#39;s a lot of work!  Did you <br/>
<br/>
really log and notch all the logs yourself?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t have any pictures of it yet. We only took a video. With all 3 of us <br/>
working on it, nobody even thought of the camera. Once I get a picture, I&#39;ll <br/>
pass it on to you. It is a lot of work but well worth it! All the logs were cut <br/>
down, dried and notched by us. Notching was done mostly by an ax and chain <br/>
saw. I&#39;d say taking all the bark off the logs was the worse! We did have a tree <br/>
service company come in and take one tree down as it was about 70 feet tall up <br/>
against our power lines, wasn&#39;t having DH climb that one! We made boards out <br/>
of that tree with an Alaskan Saw Mill that took forever. DH purchased building <br/>
plans for a larger saw mill that you build yourself and he is almost complete <br/>
with that. That will be used for the 6 other 60 feet trees that are down and <br/>
drying now. So, yes it is a lot of work which is one of the reasons I like the <br/>
Yurt. I know that is a lot off work also but it takes way less time and less <br/>
of a mess to clean up. The cabin and garage has taken us 5 years so far, not to <br/>
mention the 5 years it took to clean up the woods, put in a driveway, etc. I <br/>
think things will go a lot faster now that we&#39;ll be there full time. That is <br/>
if DH will go with a Yurt instead of cord wood. I hope!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah!  It can be really pretty.  Our yurt is on a sloping hill and I&#39;m <br/>
about to build the deck to surround it (a big circle around the yurt, of <br/>
course) and then a bathhouse support (coming off the deck on the downhill <br/>
side).  This means we&#39;ll have maybe 5 feet or so of open space under the <br/>
deck on the downhill side at least.  So, I&#39;m going to cordwood and <br/>
native-clay-mud-cement under the deck and bathhouse to make an enclosure, <br/>
create a sturdy door with hinges on the inside (for security - backwoods <br/>
vandals are more common than one would hope for) and store stuff inside, <br/>
under the deck.   I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m brave enough to go cutting glass bottles <br/>
out there to make picture windows, as pretty as it would be.  Do you have <br/>
an easy way to cut glass bottles?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there&#39;s a way you could have your yurt and he could have his <br/>
cordwood!  Yurt up top, cordwood enclosure below.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m vascillating on whether the bathhouse walls should be strawbale or <br/>
cordwood.  Cordwood&#39;s cheaper (we have lots of winter deadfall and a brand <br/>
new chainsaw!) and would leave slightly more interior space but is also <br/>
more work.  Strawbale would be warmer/cooler in winter/summer and it&#39;s less <br/>
work, but we&#39;d have to buy the straw and it&#39;d make for a slightly smaller <br/>
interior space...   That said, the next two or three years will be spent <br/>
planning and then building a strawbale house, so maybe I should get some <br/>
practice in now.  I&#39;d love your opinions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was down at Bailey&#39;s the other day (tree-chopping-industry catalog <br/>
company) and they had this gizmo that had a set of small chains on a rotary <br/>
center, kind of like a small rolling pin with rows of 4 inch chains that <br/>
attaches to some sort of powersource (chainsaw?  power drill?) and whacks <br/>
the bark off of downed trees, supposedly quickly.  How did you remove the <br/>
bark?  (&#39;cause I&#39;m going to have to remove a lot of bark when I do the <br/>
cordwood enclosure.)  A hatchet?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, honey, a yurt&#39;s NOTHING like the work involved in felling, ripping and <br/>
drying wood for a wood cabin!  With good weather, we could have gone front <br/>
to end, build the base, attached the SIP panels, install the flooring and <br/>
tile and erect the yurt in 5 constant, but relaxed days.   5 days for yurt <br/>
or 5 years for wood?  (of course, your cabin is likely to have a longer <br/>
half-life, so there&#39;s that to evaluate.  I figure every 10 years I&#39;m going <br/>
to have to write off for a new roof at least.)  Plus, it&#39;s kind of hard to <br/>
split off the interior of the yurt for &#39;alone space&#39;.  I&#39;m probably going <br/>
to have to make a &#39;hermit hut&#39; for myself in a few months or so, just to <br/>
have alone space for a little while now and then.<br/>
<br/>
Have you (or anyone) used a one-man auger?  I hurt my back (doing something <br/>
stupid!) and ds wants to auger the holes for the deck, so we were thinking <br/>
he could use a one-man auger, but dh said he heard they were more <br/>
frustrating than anything else and we&#39;d not get anything done.  Any thoughts?<br/>
