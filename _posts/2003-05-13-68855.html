&lt;&lt; On a last note, one mom that was going to meet us there today cancelled. <br/>
She<br/>
<br/>
wrote me late Sunday night that her 10 year old son did something and she<br/>
<br/>
grounded him for today. I can guarantee you that whatever he did had nothing<br/>
<br/>
to do with the impending day at the water park. And his mother also lamented<br/>
<br/>
how his grounding punished her as she really wanted to join us. I mean<br/>
<br/>
really, what&#39;s the point and what did he learn?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bugs the heck out of me.  LITTLE kids being &quot;grounded.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In a babysitting co-op/playgroup years ago one girl&#39;s family was late and she <br/>
was made to sit at a table by herself for part of the time.  Crime?  She <br/>
hadn&#39;t finished her math.  She was homeschooled.  That was a factor in my <br/>
deciding structured school at home was for the not-so-bright.   That meeting <br/>
was once a week, it served an important socio-political-logical purpose <br/>
(which kids were getting along how? what behavior needs to be watched when <br/>
kids are staying here and there during the week?), AND, the other kids <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have been affected by or witness to this mom&#39;s derision and <br/>
belittlement of her daughter.  <br/>
<br/>
Last week Holly had a free day which was usually scheduled, but she couldn&#39;t <br/>
play with her friend, because her friend was grounded.  Why?  Homeschooled <br/>
kid, hadn&#39;t done enough reading.  (And had missed doing some chores.)   So <br/>
she couldn&#39;t talk on the phone and couldn&#39;t play with Holly.<br/>
<br/>
First, playing with Holly would have been better for her intellectually and <br/>
emotionally than doing chores and &quot;reading chapters.&quot;  (It&#39;s quite a slide <br/>
back downhill when kids &quot;read chapters&quot; instead of reading a book or a story!)<br/>
<br/>
Second, Holly&#39;s reaction was to buy the same book and start reading it for <br/>
fun, to see how hard it would be to keep the pace the other mom had been <br/>
requiring.  She&#39;s caught up, only Holly&#39;s doing it for fun and out of <br/>
curiosity.  <br/>
<br/>
It did seem to me that Holly was punished because someone else had <br/>
unreasonable expectations and not much awareness of what&#39;s important in life. <br/>
 Looking at the moment instead of looking at the years of growth seems like a <br/>
driver looking intently at a crack in the pavement instead of forty feet <br/>
ahead.  <br/>
<br/>
What the other girl is learning is that reading is a chore and her mother <br/>
cares more about arbitrarily made-up rules than about the girl&#39;s feelings and <br/>
freedom, and what Holly&#39;s learning is how NOT to be when she&#39;s a mom.<br/>

<br/>
That was my very first reaction to reading the e-mail about the child not<br/>
coming. Joseph was indeed being punished too. He was looking forward to<br/>
meeting this boy. He was really looking forward to play with someone a bit<br/>
older and different. He gets along with older kids better and he was the<br/>
oldest of the group that day. I felt bad for him and also the other boy. It<br/>
was hard for Joseph to understand the whys of it all. He was slightly aware<br/>
of how some parents parent but this was the first time it ever really<br/>
affected him. He didn&#39;t get it and honestly, neither did I.<br/>

Yes you did.<br/>
Yes he did.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are mean and spiteful.<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if parents saw that being punitive and arbitrary costs them <br/>
trust and love, straight across, point for point.<br/>

Sounds like this family is intimidated by your family.  Might possibly <br/>
disagree with Unschooling and they are punishing their daughter to get the <br/>
point across to you. Sounds like a similar situation I had a couple years <br/>
ago.<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong,<br/>

Maybe in part.  I wouldn&#39;t have known about it except Holly had a free <br/>
afternoon and called over there hoping the girl could play with her, as they <br/>
often do, but both have had really heavily scheduled months lately and both <br/>
have been freed up of some obligations about the same time.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a bummer.  <br/>
