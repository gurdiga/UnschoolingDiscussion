**Kirby needed an audience, a co-human, always, every moment.**<br/>
<br/>
I remember feeling this way,  I think it went into my twenties.<br/>
<br/>
For me,  it was feeling OK with myself.   A certain calmness, an acceptance<br/>
of who I am.   I hope in raising my kids the way I am,  they&#39;ll have that<br/>
alot earlier.    Like what Sandra talked about yesterday with Holly and her<br/>
world.   I want that for my kids.   So they don&#39;t have to struggle with it<br/>
as an adult.<br/>
<br/>
Stephanie,  I think you&#39;re right in that he&#39;ll outgrow it.  He&#39;ll grow up,<br/>
all too soon.   I have to keep reminding myself how young my children still<br/>
are,  10, 8 and almost 6.<br/>
<br/>
I still think there are introverts and extraverts.  I am an introvert, but<br/>
when I wasn&#39;t comfortable in my own skin I wanted someone with me.  Not lots<br/>
of people,  just someone else,  to maybe take my mind off me.<br/>
<br/>
I still know alot of grown people who are this way.<br/>
