<br/>
now what the heck am i supposed to say here?!? :)<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m 25 years old, live in NW illinois in a cute little house that we&#39;re<br/>
rented after spending the entire summer out of work and living in a tent<br/>
(albeit a large one) on our friends land playing *community* with my<br/>
husband of nearly 7 years and our three nutty lovely wee ones (eve-6 1/2,<br/>
sebastian-4, lila moon-2.)  we&#39;ve never sent any of our kids to school<br/>
and we have no intention of ever doing so and are currently suffering a<br/>
lot of heat about this decision now that my kids are no longer safe under<br/>
the radar (read: my oldest *should* be in 1st grade this year.)  i found<br/>
this discussion group from a newsletter of a homeschooling group that we<br/>
belong to that seems to have some unschoolers with older kids that i<br/>
haven&#39;t really associated with much due to that roadblock.  i&#39;m looking<br/>
for a neighborhood (a virtual one, if need be!) of folks living similarly<br/>
to myself and my family to bounce my thoughts off of and hopefully even<br/>
help others out when they&#39;re looking for the same.  <br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m interested in gardening, birth, music, sewing, felting, spinning,<br/>
knitting, crocheting, pottery, cooking, snuggling, loving, talking,<br/>
eating delicious foods (like chocolate), rolling around in mud, building<br/>
things, and destroying the infernal grumpy-monster among other things. :)<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m not interested in grouchy people who bring out the grimace i&#39;ve been<br/>
working so hard to make go away or particularly smelly things...oh, and i<br/>
hate stepping on crumbs in my barefeet!<br/>
<br/>
one more idea for dealing with messes and people who don&#39;t want to clean<br/>
them up...downsize!  i know this isn&#39;t practical or even desirable for<br/>
most people, but it really feels good here at our house.  i am much more<br/>
efficient about my use of space and organization is no longer a problem. <br/>
i have whittled down to what isn&#39;t a waste of space to me and have made a<br/>
home for each and every thing.  this includes the clothes and shoes and<br/>
dishes.  when it comes time to sweep the floors or wash the dishes or<br/>
clean the clothes, even if they&#39;re all dirty, it takes so much less time<br/>
and i&#39;m cheerful just thinking about that!  we&#39;ve had such<br/>
disorganization and resentment and laziness in our past that this is<br/>
clearly better.  not perfect, but i don&#39;t expect it to be.  <br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve enjoyed the simple, yet effective suggestion of living each moment<br/>
and choosing joy.  i&#39;m working hard on incorporating this concept into my<br/>
life and i even tried smiling really big in the mirror today.  i laughed,<br/>
and it felt good. :)  also, the squashing of arbitrary *no&#39;s* has forced<br/>
me to be conscious of just how much i&#39;m operating on autopilot sometimes,<br/>
listening to the whispering ghosts of my parents&#39; rules and expectations<br/>
and relaying them into *rules* that my own children must abide by.  now<br/>
my kids are up to watching more tv than i&#39;d approve of (but i&#39;m shutting<br/>
up about it and becoming amazed at the wonderful things my kids are<br/>
picking up from seemingly dreadful child programming) and my daughter ate<br/>
an entire bowl of flan for breakfast (which i secretly freaked out about<br/>
thinking she was going to perish from malnutrition- INSIDE, mind you!-<br/>
until she suggested we have a picnic in the yard for lunch with raw<br/>
broccoli and pbj tortillas decorated with apples raisins and chocolate<br/>
chips!  and the other kids loved it too!)  i&#39;m becoming more and more<br/>
delighted with every moment that passes and i can&#39;t thank you all enough<br/>
for your wonderful discussions.  i can only hope that i can contribute<br/>
back and lift you all up sometimes in kind!<br/>
<br/>
ok...so i&#39;m overly chatty and terrible at organizing my thoughts any<br/>
further than the free flow that pours out of my head.  will this suffice<br/>
as an intro? ;)<br/>
