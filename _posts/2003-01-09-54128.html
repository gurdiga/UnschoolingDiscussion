<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491122445">Dear Anyone Who Has Experience With the Above Subject,<br/>
<br/>
My 21 year old soon to be college grad (who never went to school till college) is seriously thinking about applying to teach English in Japan to Jr. High and High Schoolers.  He is teaching himself Japaneese right now and also plans on taking a class on it.  He will apply next August, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Someone on this really vast list, I think, mentioned that they did this in the past.  If any of you have I&#39;d appreciate any helpful info you could pass on about any aspect of the experience.  <br/>
<br/>
When my son was a teen he stayed home most of the time.  I always felt somehow, he&#39;d be traveling far beyond his home.<br/>
<br/>
My second question would be for people with both grown kids that live far from home and younger sibs at home missing them.  How have your younger children dealt with missing their older sibs?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much,<br/>

This is a bit late,  as I was gone this weekend,  but I have a friend that went to Japan after college.<br/>
 <br/>
He was a computer/communications major,  and went over to teach English.    That was about 10 years ago now and he still lives there.      He has really enjoyed it,   loves his life there.        He seems to have really come into his own over there.      He also does alot of photography work and has enjoyed that there also.    <br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s my experience with it!<br/>

Thanks for sharing how your friend has taught English in Japan. I&#39;m glad to hear the experience was so positive for him.  Thanks.  The more I hear and read about it the more I can see why my son wants to be there so much.  It is a place that I feel very good about him living and with his disarming, kind personality I think the Japanese people will really like him.  The trouble is all of us at home will be missing him like crazy!!   I&#39;m almost wanting to move there myself now, but then MY mom would be crying her eyes out!   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks much,<br/>
Suzanne<br/>
