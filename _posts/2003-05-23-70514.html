<div id="ygrps-yiv-19964415">Hi. :-)  My name is Lara ... I discovered unschooling oh, about 15 minutes <br/>
ago (well, really about a week) after homeschooling with workbooks etc (my mom <br/>
sent me a copy of HEM she had picked up at a used bookstore).  Anyway, it <br/>
excites and thrills me, and my husband, and I immediately let my children began to <br/>
lead their own learning processes. It seems to right.<br/>
<br/>
But I have some questions - my kids are 5 (Corwin) and 3 (Peregrine). And are <br/>
wonderful, enthusiastic, questioning kids. I have no doubts that they will <br/>
learn what they need when they need it.<br/>
<br/>
But I do have questions about general discipline issues - some things I <br/>
(think) I have to insist on - like safety issues (they are after all 5 and 3 and <br/>
can&#39;t go popping cookies in the oven or slicing tomatoes), and some general &quot;how <br/>
you treat other people&quot; issues - what to do when Corwin pushes his sister or <br/>
yells at her (doesn&#39;t happen often, but it does happen) or when they play <br/>
games with the dog the dog is unwilling to play? ...<br/>
<br/>
And after setting rules, since I don&#39;t &quot;punish&quot; or &quot;threaten&quot; them, if I ask <br/>
them to stop something and they don&#39;t, I find I have no actual recourse but to <br/>
explain to them why I wish they wouldn&#39;t do those things ... is that enough? <br/>
I mean, usually they understand and agree, ... I don&#39;t know, as I type this I <br/>
realize that when I do what I know is right, sit down with them and talk with <br/>
them about things it generally works out fine.  So perhaps this question isn&#39;t <br/>
necessary, but how do you all deal with these things? <br/>
<br/>
And finally, my son especially is so full of wonderful questions, and I love <br/>
to go through things with him and answer questions, but how far do I take <br/>
answering each question, as he can&#39;t read yet and usually the process of getting <br/>
the answers that he wants bores his sister, and he&#39;d ask questions all day if <br/>
I&#39;d answer them all. I mean, it is wonderful, but is there a time when I can <br/>
say to him &quot;ok, now I&#39;m going to take some quiet time, ...&quot;?  I mean, of course <br/>
I have to determine what is ok for me to say, but how do you all deal with <br/>
this? Do you even find it a difficulty? <br/>
<br/>
Any other incredibly profound words of wisdom to offer? I would love to hear <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
(Also, did I do this right? Just send out an e-mail to the unschooling-dotcom <br/>
address? I&#39;ve never been in an e-mail group before ... is there a way to only <br/>
follow certain threads .... my e-mail is getting overwhelmed and I don&#39;t <br/>
spend much time on the computer every day ...)?<br/>
<br/>
Well, thanks for everything, and mostly for being out there and for opening <br/>
my eyes to this truth, so brilliant and obvious once seen, but something I know <br/>
I would never have even realized had I continued in the mold in which I grew <br/>
up ...<br/>
<br/>
Bye! Lara :-)</div>

-=-(Also, did I do this right? Just send out an e-mail to the <br/>

<br/>
Yes!<br/>
If you have a mailing program that will sort things out (that would be on <br/>
your computer, not on yahoo) you probably could sort by threads, but some days <br/>
aren&#39;t so busy here.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want so much e-mail, though, you could read all of <br/>
www.unschooling.com<br/>
and if you&#39;re not too tired of reading, sandradodd.com/unschooling or <br/>
sandradodd.com/life<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But I do have questions about general discipline issues - some things I <br/>
(think) I have to insist on - like safety issues (they are after all 5 and 3 <br/>
and <br/>
can&#39;t go popping cookies in the oven or slicing tomatoes), and some general <br/>

yells at her (doesn&#39;t happen often, but it does happen) or when they play <br/>
games with the dog the dog is unwilling to play? ... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Knives and 400 degree ovens aren&#39;t changed by unschooling.<br/>
Maybe a kid&#39;s need for access to them does, but in VERY direct proportion, so <br/>
does his constant adult supervision!<br/>
<br/>
Why would you think unschoolers&#39; kids push or yell more than others?<br/>
(Clue:  I think it&#39;s less, because they&#39;re not as frustrated.)<br/>
<br/>
Get into it as you go.  It&#39;s like riding a bicycle.  Just get on and go!  <br/>
You&#39;ll figure out the nuances.<br/>
<br/>
-=-since I don&#39;t &quot;punish&quot; or &quot;threaten&quot; them, if I ask <br/>
them to stop something and they don&#39;t, I find I have no actual recourse but <br/>
to <br/>
explain to them why I wish they wouldn&#39;t do those things ... is that enough? <br/>
. . . . but how do you all deal with these things? -=-<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of things to do besides explaining.  You can pick them up and <br/>
hug and rock them, give them popsicles, take them for a stroller ride or car <br/>
ride, put on happy music, pop in a funny video, ask one to go on a really fun <br/>
little errand and ask the other one to give you a hug while he&#39;s gone.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;he&#39;d ask questions all day if <br/>
I&#39;d answer them all&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You SHOULD answer them all, and he will NOT ask questions all day.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He would do X all day&quot; is a kind of phrase lots of suspicious and resistent <br/>
parents say.<br/>
Here, especially, we hear<br/>
He would play Nintendo all day if I&#39;d let him.<br/>
He would watch TV all day if I let him.<br/>
He would sleep all day if I let him.<br/>
<br/>
None of those has ever, ever once been proven true.<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;re the first one I&#39;ve heard claim your kid would ask questions all <br/>
day if you&#39;d answer them! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As to how much answer, just a little.  If he wants more he&#39;ll ask more.  If <br/>
that was enough he&#39;ll think about it a while and THEN ask more, later, next <br/>
week, next year.  &quot;Where do babies come from?&quot; is a very easy answer.  It differs <br/>
depending what the kid already knows, but first pass is &quot;They grow inside <br/>
their moms.&quot;   You don&#39;t need to say more the first time if they don&#39;t ask.  More <br/>
would be too much, probably, the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Same with the history of Liberia, or castles, or kangaroos, or anything.<br/>

&gt; no actual recourse but to <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think when kids are really young, they need firm<br/>
guidance.  They need to know &quot;this is ok&quot;, &quot;this isn&#39;t<br/>
ok&quot;. <br/>
 &quot;It isn&#39;t ok to pull the cat&#39;s tail--that hurts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think they need or want a lot of involved<br/>
explanation.  They are trying to figure out the world,<br/>
make sense of things, and we are there to help them to<br/>
do that and to keep them safe.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
unschooling means leaving kids (esp at this age)<br/>
totally to their own devices.  I realize you&#39;re not<br/>
saying this, but it seems like you&#39;re looking for<br/>
permission to give your kids limits.  <br/>
<br/>
  Set your env&#39;t up to be safe and kid-friendly so<br/>
they can explore and play and mess around freely. <br/>
Thinking back, (way before unschooling was even in my<br/>
vocabulary) I remember using the word &quot;No&quot; very very<br/>
rarely with my dtr.  I would point out things that<br/>
might be dangerous to her (outlets, fireplace etc) and<br/>
she understood very quickly.  I didn&#39;t have to explain<br/>
why things might be dangerous--she just took my word<br/>
for it.<br/>
<br/>
Not to say she always agreed with me on other things! <br/>
Now that she&#39;s 11, life is much easier. :)<br/>

<br/>
Once when Kirby was three or four, we were at an SCA event and he tripped and <br/>
fell flat down and was scared and crying.<br/>
<br/>
I picked him up and checked him and then showed him what he had tripped over. <br/>
 There was a low string-and-stake marker that the older, taller humans were <br/>
just stepping over without thinking about it, but Kirby was new to this world.  <br/>
It helped him to know WHY he had fallen, not just that he was going to be <br/>
okay.  And after that, that day, he knew where the stakes and strings were.<br/>
<br/>
An unmarried male friend of mine witnessed all that and made a mushy speech <br/>
about me being a good mom.  That was nice, but what I didn&#39;t expect was that <br/>
later that day he opened up to me about having fathered a daughter whose mother <br/>
wanted nothing to do with him, and he was not in touch with the daughter at <br/>
all, and so he always watched parents with their children wistfully.  I offered <br/>
to help him find her whenever he was ready.  He said she was about fifteen at <br/>
that time.<br/>
<br/>
One thing leads to another.<br/>

complete, &#39;let&#39;s research this and do all sorts of stuff to explain it&#39; <br/>
answer, which is why I think it seems to hard to do other things, like laundry and <br/>
eat and sleep, when I am busy answering questions. :-)  but if I just give an <br/>
simple answer and then give more if he asks, I think I&#39;ll have less pressure.  <br/>
<br/>
And no, he wouldn&#39;t really ask questions ALL day, just most of it. :-) He is <br/>
a wonderfully curious kid.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m not at all resistant about the idea - I LOVE it, and am so thrilled I <br/>
found it. I just don&#39;t know what is best for him, to answer and answer and <br/>
answer, which seems like giving a 5 year old too much information, or to let him <br/>
discover things himself without me answering it all.  I guess simple answers <br/>
sort of takes care of that dilemma. thanks. :-)</div>

<br/>
I have gotten some good advice so far on how to approach things with the <br/>
kids, neither disciplining nor allowing, and I love the statement that they are <br/>
just trying to figure out their world.  I think in the end, that is what all of <br/>
their actions boil down to, and it is important for me to remember that.<br/>

 I&#39;m sorta new to posting!  Actually, I think it&#39;s<br/>
very related in that the way we interact with our kids<br/>
every day is what it&#39;s all about.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, am working on changing my world view and it<br/>
isn&#39;t always cut and dry, is it?  This list has made<br/>
me question a lot of my ideas and that&#39;s been a good<br/>
and really exciting thing.  And it has made my<br/>
relationship with my kids so much more joyful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246939589">Hi Lara. I&#39;m here too. ::waving:: :o)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I have no doubts that they will learn what they need when they <br/>
 </span></blockquote>need it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hold that thought. It&#39;s key.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;But I do have questions about general discipline issues - some <br/>
 </span></blockquote>things I (think) I have to insist on - like safety issues (they are <br/>
after all 5 and 3 and can&#39;t go popping cookies in the oven or slicing <br/>
tomatoes)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure? Have you ever tried letting them hold a knife or wear a <br/>
potholder? They wouldn&#39;t be flying solo, you&#39;d be there to supervise. <br/>
Remember what you said..&quot;I have no doubts that they will learn what <br/>
they need when they need it.&quot; Couldn&#39;t they learn these skills as the <br/>
need arises with you right there to guide them?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;and some general &quot;how you treat other people&quot; issues - what to do <br/>
 </span></blockquote>when Corwin pushes his sister or yells at her (doesn&#39;t happen often, <br/>
but it does happen) or when they play games with the dog the dog is <br/>
unwilling to play?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I answered a similar question in an offlist discussion with Lara. <br/>
Since you&#39;re asking it here too, Lara, I&#39;m going to share this piece <br/>
of what I wrote for the benefit of others who may have similar <br/>
questions. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;what if they are harassing the dog?&gt;&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d stop them. It&#39;s not fair to the dog and he&#39;s a living thing as <br/>
well as they are. I wouldn&#39;t shame them or punish. I&#39;d just get in <br/>
between them and the dog and explain why it&#39;s not okay to hurt or <br/>
distress another living being if we can help it. At your kids&#39; ages I <br/>
would redirect or distract  them and then get the dog to a safe <br/>
place. Remember, they don&#39;t want to hurt the dog. They want to <br/>
understand how to behave appropriately in this world and they want to <br/>
please you. If they mess up they just need help to get out of the <br/>
situation, information about how to handle themselves better (age <br/>
appropriate) and a shame-free chance to try again. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If Corwin is harassing his sister?&gt;&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same principle. It&#39;s not okay and he needs to find a better way to <br/>
express what he&#39;s feeling.  But don&#39;t be surprised if it doesn&#39;t work <br/>
perfectly the first time you tell him. I still have to remind my kids <br/>
to treat each other with respect and they&#39;re 9 and 14! They go <br/>
through  cycles. They remember, they forget. It&#39;s all part of <br/>
learning to get along in this society. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And after setting rules, since I don&#39;t &quot;punish&quot; or &quot;threaten&quot; them, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>if I ask them to stop something and they don&#39;t, I find I have no <br/>
actual recourse but to explain to them why I wish they wouldn&#39;t do <br/>
those things ... is that enough?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Instead of rules, try using principles as a guiding force. Situations <br/>
change, rules are rigid. If the kids understand the priciples your <br/>
family believes are important...kindness, honesty, etc...you can help <br/>
them get back to those principles when they stray a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

&gt;Hold that thought. It&#39;s key.<br/>
&gt;Are you sure? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure about very  little as regards discipline and such - I&#39;d like to have <br/>
none, but either conditioning or some other internal thing won&#39;t let me get <br/>
away with that - for safety issues, and for probably what narrows down to <br/>
personal time issues, and then I wonder if I am being a good mom if I have personal <br/>
time issues, or if I&#39;m being a good mom if I don&#39;t ... anyway, I spend a lot <br/>
of time thinking about my parenting, and trying to improve it, because I know <br/>
it is never as good as they deserve, but right now i think I am doing it more <br/>
than  usual, as I said because there are so many exciting new things happening <br/>
to my outlook and I am trying to process it all while still having my usual <br/>
daily things to contemplate ... and I am but a bear of little brain ...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Have you ever tried letting them hold a knife or wear a <br/>
&gt;potholder? They wouldn&#39;t be flying solo, you&#39;d be there to supervise. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a very good point. For instance, today my 3 year old asked if she <br/>
could make her own cinnamon toast - and my first response was, hey, I&#39;ll get it <br/>
for you, then I thought, sure you can, and I talked her through it and she did <br/>
just fine, of course. I just need to bear in mind those things that I need to <br/>
show them instead of doing it myself because it is more efficient, as being <br/>
efficient isn&#39;t the point, and those things that I can let them do but I have to <br/>
watch very carefully to make sure safety isn&#39;t a concern.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;At your kids&#39; ages I  would redirect or distract  them and then get the dog <br/>

&gt;appropriate) and a shame-free chance to try again. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s such a good point. I think I&#39;ll hang that on my computer. Though even <br/>
though the ages 3 and 5 seem  young, they don&#39;t seem young to me, in a way, <br/>
especially my son ... I feel as though I can explain all the stuff to him, the <br/>
whys etc, and probably I end up sounding like charlie brown&#39;s adult world &quot;wonk <br/>
wonk wonk wonk, wonk wonk wonk wonk wonk wonk wonk ..&quot;. In fact at bedtime <br/>
tonight, as we were reading, i talked with him about the very point you make <br/>
later - not having rules so much as family values, and did he agree that our <br/>
values were to be kind and loving to all creatures and people. and he said he did, <br/>
and it seemed very simple and clear.<br/>
<br/>
And I have another totally off topic question, about the etiquette of this <br/>
conversation by e-mail thing (I notice someone else was mentioning how hard it <br/>
is to keep up with these, esp since I am used to being online for one letter a <br/>
day, to my husband, and maybe during a break or two to read up on a topic that <br/>
interests me ... notwithstanding the together computer times, when Corwin <br/>
wants to see the Hindenburg pictures AGAIN :-) or wants to do madlibs ...) - that <br/>
is, if I start a post/thread/???, is it somehow proper etiquette to respond <br/>
back to everyone who responds to me? I sort of feel I should, but it is so hard <br/>
... but otherwise it feels like starting a conversation then drifting off and <br/>
 not being polite as others get involved and try to talk to me ... like I <br/>
wanted to say to Joanne I didn&#39;t feel she was saying I had gotten off the topic, <br/>
I just realized on rereading what I had written that it sounded like I was <br/>
being off the topic ... can anyone guide me on this? Thanks. :-)<br/>

<br/>
No, you don&#39;t need to.    It&#39;s worse to post a bunch of short answers that <br/>
basically say &quot;I agree&quot; or &quot;thanks&quot; because each one&#39;s a whole e-mail.   If <br/>
you&#39;re sending something nice, you can use &quot;reply to all&quot; (maybe) and then delete <br/>
the lists&#39;s e-mail and the sender&#39;s e-mail will remain and you can thank them <br/>
personally without the whole list knowing.   (OR not... people don&#39;t expect <br/>
it, and if they NEED it they have a personal problem.)<br/>
<br/>
Theoretically, we&#39;re discussion only issues and not people.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;like I <br/>

topic.  When it&#39;s TOTALLY a different topic, it&#39;s polite to change the subject <br/>
line, which you can do by selecting it and then typing over, OR you can keep the <br/>
original as a sort of subtitle, like this:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567055114">Our 3 yr. old does her own toast.  We had a spell where she would put the <br/>
toast in herself without letting me know and she would turn the dial on the <br/>
toaster oven and well it was burnt. We explained to her that there could be a fire <br/>
and now when she wants toast she comes and gets me and I help her.  She makes <br/>
her own chocolate milk and we do have messes but they are easily cleaned up. <br/>
She insists on putting her own clothes away and folding the wash cloths. Fine <br/>
with me.<br/>
She is an independent player.  She loves to write and draw pictures.  <br/>
There is a big difference between she and the oldest who did attend school <br/>
for a few years.<br/>
 <br/>
My son is the opposite of all that she is and does. He seems to be struggling <br/>
with independence this month. He has found some neighborhood kids that do <br/>
attend school and his attitude and independent play has changed.<br/>
Seems this month everything has to be done a certain way and his way.  <br/>

My kids are 3 and 5, and I have NO safety rules regarding the oven or <br/>
tomatoes/knives. They know knives are sharp, and they know which knives <br/>
are &quot;kid knives&quot; and why.<br/>
<br/>
They can FEEL the heat of the oven as they approach, so there&#39;s no need <br/>
for me to insist on it when the activity is focused on the oven, only <br/>
when they&#39;re running around when someone *else* might be opening it.<br/>
<br/>
Kids aren&#39;t stupid, and they don&#39;t want to get hurt. They need <br/>
information they don&#39;t have, and support to do what they can do. They <br/>
can&#39;t cut tomatoes with their knives, but they can cut cheese and a lot <br/>
of other things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Making their own breakfast. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve always been a <br/>
reader, and once immersed in a book, it takes a lot to bring me to <br/>
the surface, or if not reading a book, doing something online, but my <br/>
kids have been making breakfast for themselves for quite some time. <br/>
Simply because they&#39;d get hungry and go in the kitchen and start, and <br/>
me not notice. Mind you, if they came to me and said they were <br/>
hungry, I&#39;d definitely put the book down, but...heh heh...with my <br/>
kids, it was &quot;Hungry, let&#39;s get some food&quot; and I&#39;d be in la-la land <br/>
and they&#39;d be making food in the other room! L Probably starting when <br/>
Katie was about 4ish, they&#39;ve done a lot of kitchen stuff their own <br/>
selves. Sometimes it means a bit of a mess, and then we clean up <br/>
together. But mostly it means that, now that they are 8 and 10, they <br/>
can make their own Ramen noodles, peanut butter toast, scrambled <br/>
eggs, sandwiches, etc. They can peel veggies, and cut things like <br/>
potatoes. Not up to carrot sticks yet. They can bake a potato in the <br/>
microwave, and heat up a can of chili. Grate cheese, though they <br/>
usually ask for help with that. etc. <br/>
<br/>
A bit different from my 8 year old state, who couldn&#39;t have peeled a <br/>
carrot to save her life:Mom handled it all.<br/>

but if someone says &quot;thanks&quot; to me, I don&#39;t usually say &quot;You&#39;re <br/>
