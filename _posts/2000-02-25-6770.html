Thanks a LOT Buzz!  my LOOK, took 2 hours, and I had to stop cause I was <br/>
going blind! LOL.  Seriously, this is a great site, and leads to so much <br/>
more.  My oldest is into computer stuff, knows way more then me.  We just <br/>
found a person who recycles old printers and puters, rebuilds them and such, <br/>
he is going to teach the boys how to build a computer.  They are very <br/>
excited, the oldest for sure, the youngest is just doing whatever his brother <br/>
does!  Right now I am trying to find sites that would teach how to use spread <br/>
sheets and make graphs.  There is a project on the site you sent, where they <br/>
have to do that, and I don&#39;t know how, so need some tech sites that teach <br/>
this, anyone know of any such thing?<br/>
