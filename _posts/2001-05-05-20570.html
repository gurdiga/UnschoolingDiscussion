<div id="ygrps-yiv-690252737">Good morning!  I promise to introduce myself properly later  but, right now<br/>
I need some help.  I have been asked to give the commencement address at a<br/>
local homeschooler&#39;s graduation.  I just found out 6 days ago and 3 1/2 of<br/>
those days I have been without water at home, ( with a husband offshore for<br/>
the next two weeks), trying to play plumber and have simply not had time to<br/>
write an address.  We live out in the country and have had well problems<br/>
but...that is a whole other story.  Now the graduation is tomorrow afternoon<br/>
and I want to do a good job.  The mom has had ZERO support from church and<br/>
family.  In fact her words to me were &quot;I have had 12 years of hell over this<br/>
and this is the culmination of it all (this graduation) - I know you will<br/>
speak your mind, show homeschooling in a positive way and I need you to do<br/>
this for me.&quot;  Well, what could I say?   I have 6 children, 3 of whom have<br/>
&quot;graduated&quot;...our sons who are 22 and 19 are very accomplished in what they<br/>
do.  The oldest was my &quot;scholarly&quot; child...and was a department head for his<br/>
company at 21.  The second son at 18 was the youngest store manager in the<br/>
history of the same company and they have family working for them - that he<br/>
is now over.  My oldest daughter just married and has started what is<br/>
apparently going to be a very successful catering business.  So, no,  my<br/>
children have not gone on to be doctors and lawyers but, I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
been any more please with their successes if they had.<br/>
<br/>
Now...I really need to know where to find FACTS about homeschooling...what<br/>
kind of company this child is in now that she is among those going on to the<br/>
next stage of her life -hopefully still learning, who have been schooled at<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
I do so appreciate anything you can say - any web site you can point me<br/>
to...honest I am not being lazy...I am so pressed for time and I really want<br/>
to set a few records straight.<br/>
Thanks so much...<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

Would you like my term paper about unschooling?  You can change <br/>
anything you want to in it for the purpose of this graduation. The <br/>
term paper will be in the book, but this is an emergency!!!<br/>
