<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788371798">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
This is off the topic today, but I am excited and have something to<br/>
share. Our son was turned off of learning by the time we pulled him out<br/>
of school. Reading was the last thing he ever wanted to do again. At the<br/>
advice of  a Mom who has had a lot of home school experience, we backed<br/>
off of him about this. Well, at least in his eyes we did..We still read<br/>
to him, show him things, include him in recipe reading and that sort of<br/>
thing. In the past couple of weeks he has made up and written ( on the<br/>
computer ) a couple of recipes. He is also reading cereal boxes, street<br/>
signs, and even movie titles in WalMart.  It is just really cool,<br/>
because he is getting interested in doing activities that involve<br/>
reading. I had to restrain myself from bouncing up and  down for joy the<br/>
night he sat on the computer after 10pm editing a recipe.<br/>
Yesterday we made Chocolate Mousse following a recipe he made up. Later<br/>
today or tomorrow  we will revise it and make it again. He wants to make<br/>
a notebook with his own recipes in it. We will work on this as soon as<br/>
we get that far in the next few days. Yeah, I know they are little<br/>
steps, but they are steps. Our unusual ways of teaching are working.<br/>

<br>It doesn&#39;t sound off topic at all -- it sounds wonderful!
<br>
<br>And I am willing to take care of any extra Chocolate Mousse you may have 
<br>(although, who ever heard of &quot;extra&quot; chocolate mousse!!).
<br>
<br>Great news!
