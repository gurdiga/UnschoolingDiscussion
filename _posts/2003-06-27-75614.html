<div id="ygrps-yiv-174296357">I am a relatively new member here.  I started reading about two months ago.  If there had been an &quot;Unschoolers who believe in food restrictions&quot; option, or an &quot;Unschoolers who use positive discipline&quot; or  &quot;Theatre people who unschool&quot;  option, or &quot;Unschoolers from Atlanta&quot; option I would have never come here!!  And I may never have felt myself actually changing the way in which I view my responsibilities as a parent.   I came here for support in unschooling and found out I hadn&#39;t even understood how much more this could encompass than just education.  I, too,  feel the categories of life (as I had perceived them) shifting daily as I watch my kids living and learning.<br/>
 <br/>
As easy and comforting as it can be to sit around and chat with utterly like-minded, like-categoried folk, it is the people in any community who challenge me and keep me honest who keep me in the community.   Who knew that a community of people in cyberspace could have more inpact on my parenting than my immediate family community?  I am letting go of so many supposed convictions, ... well, at least realizing that they are beliefs and that they can be held upside down for a while to lose some dust.<br/>
 <br/>
If one&#39;s beliefs and convictions aren&#39;t challenged then how does one know if they are real?  I am afraid that a kinder and gentler or other option would mean that someone else who is new to this and looking for real answers wouldn&#39;t stay on the challenging list long enough to &quot;get it&quot; if there were too many other options.  I have to say that if I hadn&#39;t been instructed to just lurk here for a few weeks, and had another easy option next door I don&#39;t think I would have come close to getting it.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Madeline, I liked your post about this list, and just couldn&#39;t think of <br/>
anything good (worthy) to say.  But I wanted to pass on that some time back an <br/>
old-time homeschooler who has also done years of online helping was joking with me <br/>
about what some people seem to want, and we came up with an <br/>
automatic-response list idea!  A person could go to a webpage (or it could be a list) and write <br/>
as much or as little as they want about their concerns about homeschooling, <br/>
and they would get a response.  Randomized maybe, or geared to key phrases they <br/>
 might have used.  And the responses could be things like<br/>
<br/>
* Your kids are *so* lucky to have you as a mother!<br/>
<br/>
* You know your kids better than anyone; just do what you think is right!<br/>
<br/>
* Homeschooling&#39;s never the same for any two families, so don&#39;t worry about <br/>
whether yours is &quot;normal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
* Whatever works for your family is good.  (that one was just added to my <br/>
list this week)<br/>
<br/>
* What you do isn&#39;t important, it&#39;s that you love your children and want the <br/>
best for them.<br/>
<br/>
* Children are very forgiving.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll understand when they&#39;re <br/>
grown why you had to do what you did.<br/>
<br/>
While there&#39;s truth in all those statements in some situations (and maybe <br/>
most) and while a full range of all kinds of parenting is justifiable within <br/>
various frameworks, I still don&#39;t think automated feedback is really what people <br/>
need to get them from a lifetime of conditioning about the importance of books <br/>
and courses and scores to Just LIVING and learning.<br/>
<br/>
And just living in the midst of the continuuing belief that each child NEEDS <br/>
eventually to be able to outline a chapter from a history textbook and to <br/>
balance equations before he&#39;s fourteen isn&#39;t the kind of living that experienced <br/>
unschoolers have been talking about since before I came along.  They&#39;ve been <br/>
talking about things to do, places to go, interesting people and hobbies and <br/>
fascinations.<br/>
<br/>
It can&#39;t be described easily and simply.  It can&#39;t be understood without a <br/>
family trying it and tweaking it.  But as with many things, the understanding <br/>
often comes almost suddenly at some point, when people GET it, really, at a gut <br/>
level, and begin to trust it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad two LLL leaders named Lori and Carol were willing to let me hang out <br/>
in their houses and they answered my questions and told me stories and made <br/>
suggestions I could use about how to have a warmer relationship with my own <br/>
kids.  Not everyone is lucky enough to have two big unschooling families so near. <br/>
  But this list can be even better than that, for people who want the ideas.<br/>

<br/>
When I first started exploring homeschooling, I wanted Calvert. The idea of<br/>
everything you need to know arriving in one box appealed to the engineer in<br/>
me ;-). The unschoolers sounded too lacksadaisical but I stuck with reading<br/>
what they (and everyone else) wrote. Eventually it sank in that the<br/>
unschoolers were having fun while everyone else was dealing with how to make<br/>
kids work or finding better products the kids would want to do.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the problems with this list is that since it&#39;s the one and<br/>
only list that Unschooling.com provides, it gives the impression it provides<br/>
everything to everyone. And I think the list often gets dragged down into<br/>
rancourousness because people want something from the list that it isn&#39;t<br/>
providing and so they get angry, trying to get the list to provide what they<br/>
need.<br/>
<br/>
But I think if people can get their unschooling support and conversation and<br/>
whatever else needs met elsewhere, then this list won&#39;t get dragged down by<br/>
people fighting for what they want the list to be. The discussion will be<br/>
able to stick to discussion. And I think, as I did with unschooling<br/>
information when I wanted formal schooling information, people will be able<br/>
to tune in out of curiosity. And if something sounds goofy to them, they&#39;ll<br/>
be able to read without feeling they need to fight against it to get what<br/>
they need the list to be. And that will give time for the new ideas to<br/>
slowly seep in. As they did with me who thought she wanted formal schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Forcing information on people doesn&#39;t work well in school and it&#39;s caused<br/>
problems on the list too. But if there are more lists to choose from, people<br/>
won&#39;t be so dependent on this list and they&#39;ll allow it to be what it is.<br/>
<br/>
I hope people will use the conversational list so it can provide the<br/>
connetion with other unschoolers that many people need. (I suspect all the<br/>
lists will be slow to begin with since even this list has slowed way down,<br/>
perhaps with people off on vacation or just out enjoying the nice weather.<br/>
:-) <br/>
<br/>
Well it sounds good in theory, anyway! ;-)<br/>

That was very clear and makes a lot of sense to me.  <br/>
