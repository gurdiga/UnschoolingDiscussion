<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541854693">Hi, I am looking forward to being apart of this loop. I have four children <br/>
ages 16, 14, 12, 10. We have always homeschooled. We started out quite <br/>
structured and have been loosing up more and more each year. I first heard of <br/>
unschooling when we went online a few years ago. Now I consider us to be <br/>
apart of this wonderful lifestyle. The kids do use Math-u-See math books but <br/>
it is their choice and I do not require it. Matter of fact my 10 year old <br/>
said he does not want to do it for a while and that is ok. We also read aloud <br/>
together almost daily and enjoy it very much. Right now we all have an <br/>
interest in ancient history, so that is what we have been reading. Boy I have <br/>
learned a lot. It is so interesting. (But we did take a break to read the <br/>
newest Harry Potter book recently!) The kids came to me yesterday telling me <br/>
somethings they would like to check out. The oldest saw the book Blueprints <br/>
for Geometry in a catalog and wants to try it. The 14 yr. old wants to learn <br/>
Japanese, an interest that stems from the Japanese terms they use in karate. <br/>
All the sudden this summer all the kids have gotten excited about playing the <br/>
sax and clarinet we have here. The boys found art and science books they want <br/>
to try.  And this is pretty much how it goes. We live in the country on a few <br/>
acres. We live pretty simply except for this pc which has become a necessity. <br/>
We do love the internet! :)<br/>
    My husband works a lot of hours in the summer for a construction company <br/>
but winter is coming. The kids and I earn money selling items on ebay. And <br/>
the kids clean a house for a neighbor to pay for karate classes. The kids <br/>
also race BMX. Seems like we are seldom bored.<br/>
    I look forward to meeting you all<br/>

<br/>
She could write an article for a newspaper about soemthing she feels<br/>
strongly about and something she feels others would like to know more about.<br/>
(Even if it doesn&#39;t get published.)<br/>
<br/>
She could write book or movie or toy reviews at Amazon. Anyone is allowed to<br/>
do that :-) If she reads through some of the reviews posted there on<br/>
something she&#39;s been thinking about buying that will help her get a sense of<br/>
what information people gave that she found valuable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like she wants to see if she can do what her PS friend can do.  Maybe<br/>
she could talk more with the friend about what they have to do to write it.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, she needs to think about why she&#39;s writing it.  All writing has a<br/>
purpose (which is what&#39;s wrong with the way they teach it in school) and the<br/>
purpose is not simply to show off what you know.  Does she want to write a<br/>
report because there&#39;s something she&#39;d like to learn about?  Will actually<br/>
writing it up help her learn?  Or is it the research?  Maybe she has younger<br/>
sibs who would like to read (or hear read) what she&#39;s discovered about a<br/>
subject.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not really hard to research and write about a subject, though the<br/>
schools want to make it seem so.  If you don&#39;t know much about the subject<br/>
to begin with, start by reading a very basic book, even an encyclopedia<br/>
entry.  Find something specific about the general subject you&#39;d like to know<br/>
more about.  Write down some questions you&#39;d like the answers to and start<br/>
looking for the answers in other books, magazines, encyclopedias.  Write<br/>
down the answers in your own words as you find them.  Keep track of your<br/>
sources if you&#39;re going to do any kind of bibliography.  When you&#39;ve got<br/>
lots of information written down, spread it all out.  (We used to do it on<br/>
index cards, but it&#39;s easier to do it in a word processor.)  Play around<br/>
with the facts, see how they naturally want to fit together, how they flow.<br/>
Once you&#39;ve got them in order, all you really need to write are transitions.<br/>

<br/>
Holly wrote a book report a couple of years ago.  I laminated it and took it <br/>
to a homeschooling conference and showed it around, mostly for the invented <br/>
spellings.  <br/>
<br/>
The other day, in December, she asked me what a book report is really like.  <br/>
I told her, and she kinda nodded and shrugged and went away.   Then last week <br/>
we had rented a South Park DVD and one of the shows (Chicken Lover) had book <br/>
reports!!  AND they were on books she had read, which made it a scream.  <br/>
<br/>
Chicken Lover involves the police chief being discovered to be illiterate.  <br/>
The young hippie bookmobile driver is trying to get him to read (it&#39;s a <br/>
typical South Park story, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend anyone reading it just <br/>
about book reports!).  He ends up going to third grade and being in the boys&#39; <br/>
class.  Cartman is going to report on The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, <br/>
so when the teachers says he hasn&#39;t read it, Cartman makes up some cool <br/>
nonsense which really amused Holly because she knows the books.   Then the <br/>
police guy reported on Go Dog, Go and went into deep meanings, and read a <br/>
passage.  <br/>
<br/>
The next night we were at Walmart, and Go Dog, Go was offered as a freebie if <br/>
you bought two books (or some such thing), so Holly picked it up and said &quot;Is <br/>
this the book?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then the punchline of that new literacy and reading is the bookmobile guy <br/>
gives the police guy a copy of Atlas Shrugged as a gift for his having <br/>
learned to read.  So at a ceremony at which he&#39;s reinstated in his job and <br/>
honored for learning to read, he says he read Atlas Shrugged and it was <br/>
terrible so he&#39;s never going to read a book ever again.<br/>
<br/>
I would tell your daughter that every book or movie review is a report, but a <br/>
REAL report, for other people to read.  Every summary in Newsweek that has a <br/>
graph or a chart is a report, but not a pretend report, like kids write in <br/>
school, that are read by one person and thrown away.  A REAL report.<br/>
<br/>
Show her real writing, not school writing.<br/>

Tia,<br/>
gawd, that was like watching someone eat boogers!!!<br/>
<br/>
And I LOVED English, and I used to teach English.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think we should be encouraging unschooling moms to do that to their <br/>
poor children.<br/>
<br/>
To whichever mom asked---maybe you could consider oral reports for starters.  <br/>
And that&#39;s basically storytelling.  If your child goes to a movie you could <br/>
ask &quot;What was it about?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
That will be a report.<br/>
<br/>
If you need some information about something, you could ask your child to <br/>
look it up in a cookbook or a dictionary or on a website, and tell you what <br/>
the reference book said.  <br/>
<br/>
That would be a report.<br/>
<br/>
And if they go to three different sources and fold together what they found <br/>
as they tell you, that&#39;s a research report!<br/>
