<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680778332">Has anyone in Florida registered as a private school (for their family only), and have you had any problems?  <br/>
According to the link below, it looks fairly easy and cost is about $50 a year.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have thought briefly about it, but figure if I am going to not <br/>
register with the county, I am most likely going to enroll with <br/>
Florida Unschoolers.  It is basically an organization (or more <br/>
accurately, a person, I think) who had the same idea as you, formed a <br/>
private school, and allows others to &quot;enroll&quot; for free, and all you <br/>
do is send monthly attendance sheets to total 180 days per calendar <br/>
year.  That is the only requirement by the state of Florida for <br/>
private-school students.  Florida Unschoolers is VERY minimal, they <br/>
don&#39;t care about curriculum or grades.  I just emailed the address <br/>
that came up when I did a google search and she sent me the info.<br/>
<br/>
What you are thinking of doing is fine, but I decided I didn&#39;t want <br/>
to spend money to reinvent the wheel.<br/>
<br/>
My biggest question about going this route is that your child is not <br/>
considered a homeschooler.  I haven&#39;t really figured out if that <br/>
makes a difference.  Part of me wants to contribute to the statistic <br/>
of homeschooled kids, in case that helps with legislative purposes.  <br/>
I haven&#39;t really researched it enough to have formed an opinion.  I <br/>
guess I have a few more months to figure it out.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your choice!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-83023856">Thank you, Tory.  I will check this out immediately. The places I&#39;ve checked<br/>
into want monthly work samples and about $400.  Too much work and too much<br/>
money!<br/>

It won&#39;t even really cost you $50.00. You just have to pay to get<br/>
fingerprinted and checked out. I think it&#39;s like 20 bucks or so. It is easy<br/>
but I do know they don&#39;t want people only doing it for their own children. I<br/>
also know people who do and haven&#39;t gotten &quot;caught&quot; yet. Generally just one<br/>
other kid along with yours is enough to not have any problems. Just do the<br/>
paperwork and send it in every year. Make sure you keep the paper work on<br/>
hand that you should have. A record of days of attendence and vaccination<br/>
records or a letter stating why you don&#39;t have them. And of course each<br/>
childs name and addy and such. It is pretty easy.&#92;<br/>
