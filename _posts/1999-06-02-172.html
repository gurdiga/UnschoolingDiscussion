<div id="ygrps-yiv-800203052">Is there anyone in the Meridian Mississippi area?  My parents are moving <br/>
there this month, and Mom is thinking about possibly hsing my sisters - <br/>
ages 13 and 9.  She is very anti-homeschooling - she doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
deprive them of all the wonderful opportunities that public school <br/>
brings (like what?  Rape?  Drugs?  Violence?  Prejudice?  Or perhaps <br/>
&quot;self-esteem&quot;?), but is wondering if the public schools there are really <br/>
bad, then if there are enough homeschoolers their ages, then she might <br/>
give it a try...  So, if there are any homeschoolers on this list in <br/>
that area (they haven&#39;t found a house there yet, and will probably live <br/>
farther away if they can find a nicer more country type place), please <br/>
contact me privately.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Melanie, does your mom have a computer and internet access? Turn her on to<br/>
this list! I can&#39;t believe anyone reading these posts could possibly think<br/>
otherwise. YOU can&#39;t tell her, but she might listen to OTHER PEOPLE. That&#39;s<br/>
always the way it is. I have friends who are that way, and while I don&#39;t<br/>
try to tell them stuff, I sneak-email things from the list to them. They<br/>
may read them, and they may not. But I know I&#39;m doing my part!<br/>
