Robert Krampf&#39;s Experiment of the  Week<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This  Week&#39;s Experiment - #393 - Frozen Bowl<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from my home at the  beach.   My surgery went wonderfully, and I am <br/>
quickly  recovering.   Even with no medication, I am not having any acid  <br/>
reflux.   I am taking walks on the beach to regain my strength,  and eating <br/>
lots of <br/>
very small, soft meals as I wait for my stomach to  recover.   <br/>
<br/>
This week&#39;s experiment is a result of those small  meals.   Searching for <br/>
variety and taste, I dug out the snow cone  machine.   To prepare for my <br/>
recovery <br/>
time, I bought some paper  bowls to eat from; in case I did not feel well <br/>
enough <br/>
to wash  dishes.   I grated the ice into a paper bowl and poured on some of  <br/>
the sweet flavored syrup.   The phone rang, so I placed the bowl  on the <br/>
counter. <br/>
When I finished with the call, the bowl was frozen to  the counter top.   <br/>
Why?   To find out, you will  need:<br/>
<br/>
2 or more paper bowls<br/>
crushed ice<br/>
salt<br/>
<br/>
The paper bowl  has a flat bottom, so it is directly in contact with the <br/>
table  <br/>
top.   It is also thin, which lets heat pass through fairly  quickly, and the <br/>
paper lets a tiny bit of water soak through as  well.   Put   crushed ice <br/>
into <br/>
two bowls.    Place one on the table.   Add about 4 spoons of salt to the <br/>
other  <br/>
and give it a quick stir.   Place it on the table beside the  first.   If you <br/>
are not using paper bowls, put a drop or two of  water on the table <br/>
underneath <br/>
each bowl.<br/>
<br/>
Now wait for two or three  minutes.   Then try to move each bowl.   The bowl <br/>
which  only contains ice will move easily, but the bowl with ice and salt <br/>
should <br/>
be  frozen to the table.   Why?<br/>
<br/>
The salt lowers the freezing point  of the ice.   The part of the ice that is <br/>
in contact with the salt  will change from solid ice into liquid water.   The <br/>
salt is not  melting the ice by adding heat.   You are just changing the <br/>
point  <br/>
where it will remain a solid.   <br/>
<br/>
To make the change from  solid to liquid, the water needs energy.   As the <br/>
ice <br/>
melts, it  pulls heat energy from its surroundings, making the liquid water <br/>
even  colder.   You now have liquid water which is colder than water&#39;s  <br/>
normal <br/>
freezing point.   It pulls heat energy from the air, from  the bowl, from the <br/>
table, and from any water that is between the bowl and  the table.   That <br/>
water <br/>
does not contain salt, so it will freeze  at the normal freezing point, <br/>
freezing <br/>
the bowl to the table.<br/>
<br/>
That is  why you add salt to the ice in a home ice cream freezer.   The salt  <br/>
gives you water cooled beyond its normal freezing point.   The  cools the ice <br/>
cream mixture enough to cause it to freeze.<br/>
<br/>
But  wait!   I did not add any salt to my snow cone.   I added  sugar syrup.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sugar will also lower the freezing point of ice,  but not as much as salt.   <br/>
That is why we used salt for our  experiment.   You can try it again with <br/>
sugar <br/>
or sugar  syrup.   You will probably not get results that are as dramatic, <br/>
but  <br/>
they will taste much better.   I am particularly fond of the lime  flavored <br/>
syrup, but the grape is good too.<br/>
<br/>
Have a wonder filled  week.   <br/>

My boys love to mix things together and see what happens also, and <br/>
like you, we do the baking soda and vinegar all the time.  This <br/>
little book has some neat little experiments in it. Things you can <br/>
mix together.  One thing we did from the book recently was took a <br/>
purple cabbage and chopped it up and pour boiling water over it and <br/>
let it sit for 1/2 hour.  You end up with purple water but can use <br/>
this purple water to test things as acid or base.  My boys just loved <br/>
pouring different things into little cups of the purple water and <br/>
watching what happened.  If it turns pink it is an acid, blue or <br/>
green and it is base.  That was cool watching the colors change as <br/>
you add lemon juice, or baking soda.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659594539">Lydia doesn&#39;t eat  non-food items (at nearly 7) -- while I think of all of these things as safe, I wouldn&#39;t give rubbing alcohol to someone who might taste it.  This is all stuff that she likes to mix together just to see what happens.  She was enormously pleased with herself, for example, the day that she discovered that oil and colored water in her test tube would make something sort of like a wave bottle, or a lava lamp.  <br/>
<br/>
She has a large supply of plastic test tubes and plastic pipettes and test tube stands and some recycled glass and plastic jars to mix and play in.  <br/>
<br/>
In Lydia&#39;s science &quot;kit&quot; she has little baby food jars filled with things from the house and kitchen: sand, cornmeal, flour, cornstarch, baking soda, baking powder (fizzes in water, since it has a dry acid already in it), vinegar, antacids (she is past the stage of eating things like this), vitamin C, fruit fresh (a combination of dry acids), cocoa, sugar, salt, rock salt, oil in different colors (i.e. xvirgin olive oil is greenish, canola more yellow, etc.), rubbing alcohol, coarse glitter, fine glitter, borax solution, glue, tub tints (little dry pellets of color sold for use in playing in the bathtub), liquid watercolors, and probably some other things I&#39;m not thinking of.  Oh, yeah, some packets of dry cool-aid in different colors.  I&#39;m thinking of getting different colors of lamp oil, but haven&#39;t yet. <br/>
<br/>
She has little baby food jars filled with other things purchased from a kid&#39;s science supply house: fake snow (superabsorbent polymer), the kind of superabsorbant powder that they put into baby diapers,  a kind of superabsorbant powder that turns into little gelly &quot;crystals,&quot;  glow - in - the dark powder, magic sand (stays dry in water).   <br/>
<br/>
She also has kid-sized plastic eye protectors that she wears for the dress-up pretend factor of being a chemist when she plays with her stuff.  I am planning to make her a kid-sized lab coat with her name on the pocket, but haven&#39;t done it yet. <br/>
<br/>
As I said, she just likes to play around and see what happens -- but here are a few combinations that definitely &quot;do&quot; something:  slime (borax solution and glue), fizzy bath bombs (oil, baking soda, and Kool-aid mixed together and formed into a small ball - fizzes and releases oil and sent when dropped into a bath); cornstarch and water turns into a weird substance that seems liquid until you push on it and then it seems solid.  If you put plain whole milk in a shallow saucer and drop little bits of watercolor or foodcolor in, the colors will mostly stay in place -- touch the center with a toothpick dipped in dishwashing liquid and the colors will instantly begin to mix and swirl.  <br/>
<br/>
I second someone&#39;s suggestion of the Kampf experiment of the week -- it&#39;s great. <br/>
<br/>
We get some of our stuff from www.stevesspanglerscience.com.  Lydia sometimes likes to keep her concotions in test tubes, rather than rinsing them out to start over, so we get them in bulk - they&#39;re about 40cents each, when you buy them 120 at at time. <br/>
<br/>
Hope some of this is helpful.  <br/>

cafeteria most of the time (as a university employee I got a free <br/>
meal plan and DH&#39;s was half price). He and his cohorts had a great <br/>
time using exactly this principle to stick a bunch of ice cubes to <br/>
the cafeteria trays before putting them on the conveyor to go to the <br/>
dishwashers. And they were college kids! (except DH who wasn&#39;t a kid <br/>
chronologically at that point - he was about 27 when he started <br/>
college as a freshman - but is always a kid at heart).</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-395697299">A couple of other fun things we have done with cabbage indicator and acids and bases:  if you soak paper in the purple juice and let it dry, you can paint on it with different acids and bases, using q-tips.  If you write on a piece of paper with bakingsoda mixed with water -- it dries to a (mostly) invisible secret message, that you can reveal by spraying lightly with cabbage juice water in a spray bottle. <br/>

sewn together, between trees and next to a wall, and she had a metal cabinet, <br/>
a wicker bathroom cabinet found near a dumpster, and a little table.  We got <br/>
little bottles and corks and droppers and pill bottles, and she soaked yard <br/>
stuff in various combinations of stuff.   She played there a little a year ago, <br/>

and money sinks, American Science & Surplus (http://www.sciplus.com). <br/>
They have all sorts of odds & ends, and they cheerfully admit that<br/>
much of it is of low quality -- but then, the prices are pretty darned<br/>
low, too.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, they also have some good quality stuff, too, particularly<br/>
in the labware department.  If you&#39;re looking for Pyrex-equivalent lab<br/>

stands, scales, alcohol burners, and the like.<br/>

Most of this is stuff that will mainly appeal to the older unschooler<br/>

tons of stuff that you may also find piques someone&#39;s interest...<br/>
