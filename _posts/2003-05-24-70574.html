<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The deceased sister?<br/>
&gt; Didn&#39;t &quot;Abby&quot; Pass away? I could be wrong but didn&#39;t her sister take the Dear<br/>
&gt; Abby column?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dear Abby is wrriten by her niece.  Abby is still alive from what I<br/>
understand, just no longer able to write the column daily.<br/>
<br/>
Ann Landers died recently, and her column is being written by two ladies who<br/>
were her long-time editors.<br/>
<br/>
I did have a thought about the Dear Abby school column, though.  The reply<br/>
may disgust us, because we see that GPA isn&#39;t a big deal at all.  However,<br/>
most parents do completely buy into that idea, and as well respected as Dear<br/>
Abby is by many people, I don&#39;t know that she can get away with *not*<br/>
supporting the status quo in this case.<br/>

Abby was Pauline Phillips.  Her daughter Jeanne started co-writing <br/>
with her a while ago.  Now she is on her own because her mother has <br/>
Alzheimer&#39;s.<br/>
I read Dear Abby every morning on line.<br/>
