<div id="ygrps-yiv-775560306">&lt;&lt;Having a knife thrust in your chest is on the same continuum as a papercut<br/>
but it is a similarly long continuum&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree. But the basic cause of both points of that continuum is a foreign<br/>
object entering the body.  So we could make a fictitious diagnosis of mild<br/>
foreign object penetration (paper cut) and severe foreign object penetration<br/>
(knife in chest).<br/>
<br/>
I am not attempting to say that hysteria and DID are the same only that<br/>
perhaps the basic cause is the same, with one being much more severe than<br/>
the other.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess you could say the underlying cause was trauma, for both... I<br/>
agree with that. But I still think we need different diagnoses for each<br/>
problem, just like we need different dignoses for paper cuts and knife<br/>
wounds..<br/>
