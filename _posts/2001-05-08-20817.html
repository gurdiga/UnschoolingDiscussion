<div id="ygrps-yiv-124769539">Its been a while since I posted anything, but I have been reading all <br/>
the wonderful postings. I have not begun homeschooling yet but <br/>
yesterday I was able to attend a hs meeting closeby for the first <br/>
time. I found out a lot of information and realize that this is what <br/>
I really want to do. My 2 dd&#39;s will surely enjoy this as well (ages 6 <br/>
& 3). I know that I will get a lot of support from this group (and I <br/>
will need it). My goal will be to start hs part time for the summer <br/>
as my oldest dd really wants to finish kindergarten with her friends <br/>
(and there is only 5 including her in her class) and continue thru <br/>
the summer with this same group for day camp. Since I really want to <br/>
knock out as much debt as possible before quitting my current job, <br/>
this will work to my advantage, as long as she remains happy. And <br/>
before any of you ask, no I cannot continue this current job part <br/>
time or on any other hours than 8:30-5 mon-fri, nor can I work from <br/>
home with this company. I would still like to hear from the rest of <br/>
you as to any part-time (preferrably from home) jobs everyone has <br/>
that has found to be helpful. I&#39;m in Illinois (homeschoolers <br/>
paradise, from what I&#39;ve been told). Thanks for everything! <br/>
Everyone&#39;s advise has been very helpful.</div>
