I have really gotten no farther than that email. :) BUT, I&#39;m going to leave the kids with my DH sometime in the next few days and go down to the local coffee shop and write it all out. It&#39;s been in my head since I had the revelation and I need to exorcise it already! I&#39;m glad it helped.<br/>
