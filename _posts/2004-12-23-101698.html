<div id="ygrps-yiv-928881679">We haven&#39;t ventured out much since moving to Staten<br/>
Island, figuring we had alot of time, and just wanting<br/>
to get settled. We expected to be here for three<br/>
years, so there&#39;d be plenty of time. <br/>
<br/>
Well, we have the opportunity to move home to NC soon.<br/>
We are just waiting for approval and to be given a<br/>
reporting date. <br/>
<br/>
Sarah and I were planning to go to the Museum of<br/>
Modern Art soon, but Paul mentioned wanting to go to<br/>
the Natural History Musuem. I looked, and for the six<br/>
of us at the &quot;suggested donation&quot; for admission we&#39;d<br/>
be spending just short of $50. Membership for a six<br/>
membered family would be $100. That would leave us<br/>
only needing to pay for parking at the ferry at $6 for<br/>
the day. <br/>
<br/>
We could be here for another six weeks, maybe 12 if<br/>
the transfer is approved. Three years if it isn&#39;t. I<br/>
know there is ALOT to see there, and we&#39;d like to take<br/>
our time and enjoy exhibits. I can see at least Sarah,<br/>
Logan and I going weekly if not all of us together. <br/>
<br/>
The problem with planning for all of us to go together<br/>
is that Megan, our three year old, might get there and<br/>
decide she wants to go home NOW. She&#39;s very sensitive,<br/>
and right now she&#39;s not very predictable as to when<br/>
she might freak. That&#39;s why I&#39;m saying it might only<br/>
end up being the three of us with Daddy staying home<br/>
with Megan and Gracie after the first visit that he<br/>
wants to make. <br/>
<br/>
So would you invest in a membership you might only use<br/>
enough to pay for, just in case you stay the year and<br/>
use it well...or would you wait to know if you&#39;re<br/>
going to be staying? <br/>
<br/>
Paul has said to do what I want to, and like I said I<br/>
can see Sarah, Logan and I using it weekly until we<br/>
leave even if the others don&#39;t join us. <br/>
<br/>
Would you consider that a worthy investment of money?<br/>
Thanks for your opinions.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is a good reason to have a membership to places, especially if it is<br/>
&quot;paid for&quot; in only a couple of visits. Any residual pressure to &quot;do it all&quot;<br/>
in one visit is removed. We have annual passes to Disneyland for that very<br/>
reason, and what we do to ensure that we get our value for money, is sit<br/>
down with the calendar and plan a monthly (or six weekly) visit during the<br/>
non-blackout times. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing to investigate is whether your membership includes reciprocal<br/>
visitations at other museums around the country. Many places do. We are a<br/>
member of a nature museum in Redding (where we do not live) which we visited<br/>
once, but allows us in to cool places all over the nation, not just<br/>
California.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Museum of Natural History stands on city property and has to<br/>
accept whatever donation a museum-goer is prepared to offer.  That&#39;s<br/>
why they &quot;suggest&quot; a contribution.  The Metropolitan Museum of Art<br/>
also will take any donation offered.  They used to call it &quot;pay what<br/>
you wish but you must pay something&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
You must pay whatever fees there are for special exhibits like the<br/>
Butterfly or Frog exhibits currently on view but there is plenty to<br/>
see for almost free.<br/>
<br/>
I would wait until after the New Year to go because the Museum is<br/>
packed during the holidays.  Two o&#39;clock in the afternoon is a great<br/>
time to go because all the school kids have to be on the bus by then...<br/>

Do I recall that the original poster was afraid that her little one <br/>
would want to leave early?  In that case, one might put in a smaller <br/>
donation up front and then add more money when departing, based on how <br/>
long one stayed.  (If you are able to stay 3 or 4 hours and have a great <br/>
time then that justifies paying the full amount, but it the little one <br/>
has a fit in the first hour, paying one half or one quarter of the <br/>
standard amount sounds reasonable to me.  But I&#39;m not always very &quot;couth&quot;.)<br/>

Yes, that&#39;s one of my concerns with going as our<br/>
