&lt;&lt;  The question of <br/>
rank is not something that we really deal with on a day in day out basis.  We <br/>
live in and among our families and friends and peers and co-workers, and for <br/>
the most part, we are all  the same rank, we are people who care for and love <br/>
and respect each other with no regard for who is &quot;above&quot; whom..   But, on <br/>
occasion, rank does come to into play, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depending how subtly people view things, it can be day to day.<br/>
<br/>
When expertise is important, those who are newer or less experienced should <br/>
defer to people with more experience.  Our friend Mark rides horses.  Once a <br/>
week he helps others do the same.  When he&#39;s doing that, he ranks.  They really <br/>
need to take his advice and follow his rules, as he&#39;s the one who contracted <br/>
with the stables for people to be there that day.<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;re playing music, Mark ranks none at all.  His wife plays sometimes <br/>
(used to) and he might show up to carry her stuff in.  But if we were playing <br/>
and Mark interrupted, it would be really rude.  He&#39;s not a musician.  And he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t dream of interrupting!<br/>
<br/>
If Mark&#39;s over, and Keith, and Cathyn, working on armor, I&#39;m nobody.  I can <br/>
bring them drinks and offer them food, and bring them a phone if someone calls, <br/>
but I&#39;m not an armorer, and what they are doing is none of my business.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Stop hammering those rivets, I&#39;m trying to watch TV.&quot;   If they&#39;ve <br/>
arranged to make armor, that&#39;s what&#39;s happening that day.<br/>
<br/>
Mark used to be a long haired college kid who was my husband&#39;s squire&#39;s <br/>
squire (the middle-man having been knighted).  <br/>
Cathyn used to be a long haired drop-out drug dealing brat.  That was a long <br/>
time ago.<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;re cooking as a group, for a feast or project, Cathyn is IT.  He <br/>
knows lots.  We defer to him and take his advice.  If Mark Schander (a different <br/>
Mark) shows up, or Marie Heuser, Cathyn will step back and defer to them.  As <br/>
cooks, they rank him.  He LOVES to watch them cook, and he learns a lot from <br/>
them.  So this &quot;rank&quot; I&#39;m talking about isn&#39;t given after a test, doesn&#39;t <br/>
involve a certificate, it&#39;s not claimed king-of-the-mountain style.  It&#39;s deference <br/>
to people who know more, who have more reason to be in charge, or who are for <br/>
that moment in a position of knowledge or authority, and others who are <br/>
interested in the horses, armor, music, cooking, whatever, defer.<br/>
<br/>
Cathyn can also do electricity.  When he works on our fixtures, Keith will <br/>
stand by and hand him tools, because Keith doesn&#39;t do electricity.<br/>
<br/>
Mark (of the horses and armor) is a police officer now.  When the subject was <br/>
a young man of our acquaintance who had gotten crazy and threatened a female <br/>
friend, we asked Mark what we should do, and we shut up and we listened to him <br/>
about what was legal, and what was likely to make things worse.  <br/>
<br/>
Mark rarely outranks me in social situations (and we&#39;ve intersected half a <br/>
dozen ways over the years).  When he does, I don&#39;t hesitate to defer to him, <br/>
make sure he has whatever tools (space, light, phone, food, chair, table, pen) he <br/>
needs to do what he needs to do.  He has done the same for me, when roles <br/>
were reversed in other situations.  We&#39;ve been in situations where we were flatly <br/>
equal.  It&#39;s nice.  They&#39;re all nice.  They can change by the moment.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in my 20&#39;s, my favorite professor, whom I&#39;d known since I was 18, <br/>
got me to join the SCA.  We had done folk music together (equals) I&#39;d taken <br/>
classes with him (NOT equal), I had visited him in England when he was there on <br/>
sabbatical (I was a guest in HIS house, so I got special tourist attention, <br/>
but had to follow his house rules and schedule), and he convinced me to join the <br/>
SCA, where I outranked him within two years.  He was always gracious about <br/>
that, and I knew when we were back in academia I was little to his big.   No <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
Kids can learn to ride that adeptly if parents help them  instead of hinder <br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
If a child&#39;s being taught to do introductions, those things DO matter.<br/>
