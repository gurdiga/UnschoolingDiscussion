Seattle. It does look like it might clear up a bit, and it&#39;s not raining, so<br/>
we might go play in the garden beds later!<br/>

Here in the metro detroit area, it is 10f and windy.  My next door neighbor<br/>
and I decided as soon as we could, we would drive to his father&#39;s farm about<br/>
45min north of us and pick up some 15yo composted cow manure.  I told him we<br/>
should package and sell it!!!  We could make beaucoup bucks on that stuff!!<br/>
<br/>
Since we live in the city, I have a compost bin in a 35g trash can, I cannot<br/>
wait until my pride thaws out so that I can put the contents on my flower<br/>
bed.<br/>
<br/>
At night, when I can&#39;t fall asleep, I lie there and visualize how I will<br/>
re-do my garden this year.  I never would have imagined the joy I have<br/>
received from my flower beds, rose bushes, herbs and container tomatoes.  I<br/>
cannot wait for spring.  As soon as my crocus pop....look out garden<br/>
centers, here I come!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-433866956">WE HAVE BULBS UP! I can&#39;t remember which ones they are, I&#39;m going to have to<br/>
look at my order form, or the package, but they are up! Was sitting out on<br/>
the front steps and just happened to glance over at the flower/herb bed, and<br/>
sure as anything, right next to the Hypericum, were some beautiful little<br/>
green bulb sprouts. OH, what a joyous day!<br/>
<br/>
Your urban garden sounds great! I read a wonderful article in an Organic<br/>
Gardening mag about 3-4 years ago about some people that lived in a very<br/>
urban area and turned their whole yard into a garden. Squash and flowers out<br/>
front, and just a huge garden out back. One thing I remember from that<br/>
ariticle, was that they had some pole beans growing up an old leaf rake that<br/>
they&#39;d stuck in the ground.  :-) We are in a suburban type area, small<br/>
house, but large lot, so we&#39;re able to have a big plot for a garden. We put<br/>
in 10 fruit trees when we got here, which was in April of last year, cherry,<br/>
apple, pear, plum, and peach. We are hoping to put in a couple of fig trees<br/>
this spring.  Ahhhhh, I just LOVE hearing/talking about growing....<br/>

Serendipity.  IMO, there is no better reminder of rebirth and renewed<br/>
spirit,  than seeing those green fingers of flowers peeking up, pushing<br/>
their way through the dirt and in spite of snow.<br/>

I have tried and tried and tried to convince my dh that we should turn the<br/>
back part of our (narrow, not very deep) backyard into MY GARDEN FANTASY,<br/>
lol.  His argument for not doing it is because that part of the lawn is a<br/>
little lower, and traps all the water and is the only really healthy spot of<br/>
grass we have, LOL.  Actually, the alternative is to use part of my front<br/>
lawn where it would get the am/early afternoon sun.  Although my yard is<br/>
small, it is VERY shady from some beautiful old trees that I will not part<br/>
with, helps keep the house cool.  So, to combat that issue, on the north<br/>
side of the house, I put an old picnic bench on the far side of the<br/>
drive(just about full sun) and grew my tomatoes in recycled buckets, or<br/>
whatever looked big enough to me.  Last year was the first year I tried it,<br/>
and it was heaven to look out my kitchen window and see my babies thriving.<br/>
<br/>
This past fall, I bought loads of tulip bulbs and added them to my existing<br/>
bulb collection.  I didn&#39;t dig up the old ones, but with the new ones, I<br/>
threw them in groupings and planted them where they lay.  I can&#39;t wait to<br/>
see how it turns out.<br/>
<br/>
Wondering what that groundhog will say!<br/>
