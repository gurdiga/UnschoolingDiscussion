<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401044783">Holly, Steiner says in The Education of the Child<br/>
(p.21):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Excitable children should be surrounded by and<br/>
dressed in red or reddish-yellow colors, while<br/>
lethagic children should be surrounded by blue or<br/>
bluish-green shades of color.  **The important thing<br/>
is the complementary color that is created within the<br/>
child.**  In the case of red it is green, and in the<br/>
case of blue, orange-yellow.  **This can be seen very<br/>
easily by looking for awhile at a red or blue surface<br/>
and then quickly looking at a white surface.  The<br/>
physical organs of the child create this contrary or<br/>
complementary color,** and this is what causes the<br/>
corresponding organic structures that the child<br/>
needs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**Astricks are mine**<br/>
<br/>
In response to:<br/>
&quot;Steiner&#39;s theory was not that there were<br/>
complimentary colors but how <br/>
color affected individuals. <br/>

<br/>
I quoted more from this excerpt in my original post<br/>
regarding &#39;the color thing&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Vijay, in turn responded that she thought this was<br/>
Goethe&#39;s theory, not Steiner&#39;s  which I was suspicious<br/>
of since I knew he spent years studying Goethe&#39;s<br/>
scientific theories.<br/>
<br/>
And, thank you Vijay for quoting Eric Carle&#39;s intro. <br/>
That&#39;s very informative and obviously right where it<br/>
comes from.  Interesting that that&#39;s one of the Carle<br/>
books we haven&#39;t read!<br/>
