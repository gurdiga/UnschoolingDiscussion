I&#39;m pagan and so are my two children...as my oldest proudly informed me the<br/>
other day...although she claimed that the youngest is pagan and<br/>
catholic...although the little one is only 2 :) This is because my spouse<br/>
was raised catholic and has not declared himself pagan...although his ideas<br/>
are decidely pagan :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29406716">Hi all<br/>
I have added a group to yahoo for unschoolers who celebrate earth <br/>
based religions and beliefs. Just a place to share the rhythms of the <br/>
earth and the seasons of our childrens lives. Maybe share links and <br/>
ideas for upcoming festivals such as candlemas (imbolc)<br/>
You can find it at pagan_unschoolers<br/>
have a beautiful day!</div>
