<div id="ygrps-yiv-471593692">**The naturally clutter-free don&#39;t seem to have these internal conversations <br/>
to the same<br/>
degree. So when they write manuals they assume that the difficulty is how to <br/>
declutter, as<br/>
in logistical considerations. But the real obstacle lies at this deeper <br/>
level.**<br/>
<br/>
Don Aslett wrote several books about decluttering that are exactly about this <br/>
stuff. About how to hang onto the memories of stuff (like sorority silver <br/>
bowls) without having to hang onto the stuff itself. About how the stuff eats up <br/>
your energy just thinking about it and moving it around. <br/>
