I&#39;ve mentioned it on this list before, but I think it&#39;s important enough to<br/>
repeat. I seriously suggest looking into NAET treatments, both for allergies<br/>
and FMS. You can read about it at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.naet.com">http://www.naet.com</a> . But keep an open<br/>
mind. When I first heard about it, and indeed when I first took my son in to<br/>
be treated, it just seemed totally hokey and impossible to me. But it<br/>
really, really works! When I took my son in for his first NAET treatment, he<br/>
had endured 4 months of hives due to food allergies that we couldn&#39;t pin<br/>
down. He had been to pediatricians and allergists, poked with needles for<br/>
allergy tests that were inconclusive and told us nothing. The best that the<br/>
doctors and allergists could come up with was a prescription for long-term<br/>
Claritin use and an Epipen just in case he went in to anaphylactic shock.<br/>
That and a diet that avoided just about everything edible on earth. We<br/>
existed on Millet bread and rice cheese for months before I found NAET. When<br/>
I took him in for his first treatment, I didn&#39;t give him any antihistamines<br/>
that morning, because I thought it might interfere. By the time his<br/>
appointment rolled around, he was covered in huge welty hives from head to<br/>
toe, and his face and hands were swelling up. Within literally minutes of<br/>
the start of the NAET treatment, the hives started disappearing before my<br/>
very eyes. They came back for about 5 hours after his 2nd NAET treatment and<br/>
have not been back since! So far we have had him &quot;cleared&quot; of 5 of his food<br/>
allergies and are eating all kinds of things we hadn&#39;t eaten in months. I<br/>
can&#39;t describe how happy I am not to see my little guy swollen up, itching,<br/>
and covered in hives. Not to mention eating Quinoa pasta (blech!).<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine&#39;s mother had fibromalgyia and Crohn&#39;s disease, and was<br/>
basically debilitated by pain. The doctors kept giving her different kinds<br/>
of medications, but nothing worked. She was taking dozens of ibuprofen a<br/>
day. Her remission after NAET treatments has left her able to totally enjoy<br/>
life. She&#39;s not completely free of all of her symptoms, but enough that she<br/>
feels she has &quot;a completely different body&quot;. I can&#39;t say enough about this<br/>
amazing treatment. Best of all, for kids, it is completely painless.<br/>
Mackenzie actually looks forward to going to see &quot;Doctor Deborah&quot;, the<br/>
naturopath who has been doing our NAET treatments. Often chiropractors,<br/>
acupuncturists, or naturopaths become NAET specialists, so you might try<br/>
looking in the phone book under these professions to see if you can find<br/>
someone who does it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this info is helpful. I know I might sound like I&#39;m proselytizing about<br/>
it, but if I can help one family avoid the horrible allergy problems we had,<br/>
and the lack of useful treatment from allopathic physicians, the elimination<br/>
diets and the medications, it is worth it!!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, NAET is also used to treat Sensory Integration problems, Autism, and<br/>
many other allergy-related illnesses. The woman who created NAET, Dr.<br/>
Nambudriped has written a couple of books &quot;Say Goodbye to Illness&quot; and &quot;Say<br/>
Goodbye to Allergy-Related Autism&quot; that might be worth checking out for<br/>
anyone interested in how it works.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-248714553">Hi Nancy - I have fibromyalgia, and I would say the main symptoms are pain<br/>
and insomnia.  There&#39;s also migraines, dropping things, poor memory and word<br/>
recall, irritable bowel syndrome, flu-like achiness,  missing your mouth<br/>
when you try to drink, swelling in hands, and difficulty shaking a virus.<br/>
My favorite book on the subject is &quot;Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain<br/>
Syndrome&quot; by Devin Starlanyl and Mary Ellen Copeland.  I know they have a<br/>
website too.    There is a LOT of misinformation out there, and I really<br/>
think it&#39;s just a word used to describe something that doctors haven&#39;t<br/>
figured out yet.  They do know that I have candida (too much yeast in the<br/>
intestines) and some minor food allergies, but that doesn&#39;t really explain<br/>
most of the symptoms.   I was diagnosed in 1991, and every doctor I&#39;ve been<br/>
to in the past ten years has heard of it, but not every one has taken it<br/>
seriously or known a lot about it.  Unfortunately, I have not found much<br/>
relief, and have tried many medications and therapies.  I would recommend<br/>
seeing an osteopath, as they seem to be able to feel where your pain is and<br/>
provide some massage therapy.   I would also go to as many doctors as it<br/>
takes until you are listened too.   My life is profoundly affected, as you<br/>
said, but you do learn to deal with it.   If you have any specific questions<br/>
about it I&#39;ll be happy to answer them.  I hope you don&#39;t have it! - Rue<br/>
