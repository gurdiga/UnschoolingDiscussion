<br/>
hi,<br/>
<br/>
so true, there is so much pressure to &#39;share&#39; in the belief that $ is the end<br/>
all and the primary motivation for nearly all we choose to undertake.  this is<br/>
one of the conflicting interests of our ps system.  there&#39;s a interesting<br/>
article in the &quot;path of learning&quot; mag (www.great-ideas.org/paths.htm)  entitled<br/>
&quot;public education, alternative schools, and democracy&quot;.   the article states<br/>
that there are three major purposes underlying the different agendas people<br/>
have for ps.   the three purposes are:<br/>
<br/>
&#39;(1) we want our schools to promote democracy (and &#39; a major reason for th(e)<br/>
failure (of this) is that the public school is also expected to serve a second<br/>
purpose&#39;)<br/>
(2) we also want them to support a competitive economic system  (&#39; the<br/>
promotion of economic growth in a fundamentally competitive and hierarchical<br/>
system of production&#39;), while<br/>
(3) we also want them to inculcate moral values and civic virtues.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
ron miller, the author, goes on to say:<br/>
&#39;in more organic societies, such as premodern or indigenous cultures, these<br/>
realms of politics, economics, and morality are in substantial harmony, and a<br/>
coherent education emerges quite naturally in daily life of a community (as<br/>
native american educator gregory cajete has nicely described).   but in modern<br/>
industrial/scientific cultures, particularly the restless and rootless culture<br/>
of the united states, there are deep seated tensions between these spheres, and<br/>
to the extent that an educational approach embraces one of them, the others are<br/>
diminished.   people with different educational ideals struggle to establish<br/>
one or another purpose above the others.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
miller also says that, in terms of the economic agenda (2), &#39;there is no<br/>
denying that fierce competition inevitably produces big winners (enormously<br/>
wealthy families and exclusive communities, robber barons and cooperate<br/>
raiders) and demoralized losers (a disempowered working class and an<br/>
impoverished underclass),  and to a large extent the winners enjoy as much<br/>
control over social policy as did the aristocracy in jefferson&#39;s day.   when we<br/>
ask schools,  as bill clinton explicitly did a few years back, to serve &quot;one<br/>
high standard:  are our children learning what they need to know to compete and<br/>
win in the global economy?&quot;,  we are asking them to sabotage the goal of<br/>
democratic education, because for every child who competes and wins, there are<br/>
others who will compete and lose.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
this society places so much emphasis on one&#39;s bank account,  what one wears,<br/>
where one lives,  that we (as a whole) have becomes slaves to our image, and  i<br/>
believe at the expense of our purpose, our sense of self and happiness, as well<br/>
as our relationship to others and our community.   last night on some tv show<br/>
like 20/20 they interviewed &#39;arguably the most intelligent man in america&#39; who<br/>
tested so high on the iq test they gave him that he could not be measured but<br/>
his lasted measurable score was 195.   he lives on $6000/year, lives in a very<br/>
small house, is writing a book about mathematically proving the existence of<br/>
the spirit, and is presently working as a bounced at a bar.  the interviewer<br/>
was very surprised that he never finished college, was not focused on getting<br/>
rich, was perfectly happy living on a small amount of $ and was pursuing a goal<br/>
that would most likely never bring him $ or solve the problem of world hunger<br/>
(i think the assumption is:  if you don&#39;t want $ then you must be a complete<br/>
altruist, a &#39;mother theresa&#39; type).<br/>
<br/>
it seem to be hard for many many people to understand that $ is not the focus<br/>
of everyone&#39;s life and is not the standard by which those people measure their<br/>
happiness.   for our family $ buys time and has no other real significance.  it<br/>
holds no power or prestige just another tool we find along the way.   that&#39;s<br/>
not to say we wouldn&#39;t mind winning the lottery (though we would have to start<br/>
playing for that to be likely to happen) it&#39;s just not an important issue.<br/>
both my husband and myself are artists, sculptor and painter respectively,  and<br/>
our son seems to be leaning toward the world of science and mathematics (just<br/>
to keep it all in balance:) and the power $ can bring is of no consequence but<br/>
happiness, creativity and an open and curious mind are paramount.<br/>

<h4>John O. Andersen</h4>
<p><small><time>10 Dec 1999, at  6:48am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-522777995">Some time ago I read a bit about the Dutch Masters (Rembrandt, Vermeer,<br/>
etc.).  Almost to a man, even with their profound talents as painters, they<br/>
couldn&#39;t support themselves through the sale of their paintings alone.  Of<br/>
necessity, many of them had  side businesses.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose Rembrandt had owned and operated a small &quot;bed and breakfast&quot;<br/>
business in order to pay the bills.  Further suppose that he gave into<br/>
pressure to &quot;make it big&quot; in the B&B business so that he could fit in with<br/>
the other &quot;successful&quot; people around him, or purchase a dream home, or<br/>
afford to send his kids to soccer camp, or pay to have them get all sorts of<br/>
musical lessons.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly Rembrandt would be spending much of his time dealing with a load of<br/>
new concerns: purchasing and maintaining equipment, finding, hiring, and<br/>
retaining employees, developing management systems, refurbishing, upgrading,<br/>
purchasing and selling his real estate holdings, dealing with accountants,<br/>
lawyers, advertising people, racking his brains for ways to attract new<br/>
customers, meet payroll, deal with the IRS, etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a possibility that all of these new demands on Rembrandt&#39;s time<br/>
could have detracted from the time, energy, passion and focus which are so<br/>
necessary to creating great art?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve studied the lives of great artists and creators, you may conclude,<br/>
as I have, that in many cases, such a diversion would severely squelch a<br/>
person&#39;s creativity.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not all supermen or women.  We have limited time, energy and<br/>
resources.  Thus, the importance of finding what we love to do and focusing<br/>
our energy in those specific areas.<br/>
<br/>
For some people, the &quot;earning money&quot; part of life is ancillary to their main<br/>
life&#39;s mission.  For other people, it&#39;s the central purpose of their waking<br/>
hours.<br/>
<br/>
In our materialistic culture, it&#39;s truly liberating when we have the courage<br/>
to &quot;break the rules&quot; by putting money-making and status-seeking on a lower<br/>
pedestal; much lower than that of our creative and artistic interests.<br/>
<br/>
Believe it or not, such a choice is available to most of us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541457748">I really enjoyed hearing John and Kathy&#39;s letters.... I guess it&#39;s hard<br/>
to break out of the mold we were raised in. I think I rationalize that<br/>
&quot;something could happen&quot; in life, and thus, we need to be prepared for<br/>
that possibility. I like the extension John mentioned...&quot;Believe it or<br/>
not, such a choice is available to most of us.&quot;  in regards to focusing<br/>
on our natural talents and creativity. I became a nurse as we have four<br/>
children, and I wanted to be able to support us if anything ever happened<br/>
to my husband... but what I would really like to do is write! I am on my<br/>
second round of attempts to get a children&#39;s book published... (six<br/>
sendouts so far). I encourage my children to follow their strengths. I<br/>
think 10 years ago, I would have said &quot;Go where the Money is!&quot; Now I<br/>
realize how important &quot;being happy and content&quot; in what you do in life<br/>
is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399088893">When Martha Graham died (Martha is THE god mother of modern dance), she<br/>
had not even a checking account to call her own.  She owned nothing except<br/>
the rights to 150 of her dances.  Her dance company which she founded in<br/>
1929 supported her but on very little money (because they couldn&#39;t afford<br/>
it) and she never cared about anything except dance.  She put her entire<br/>
soul into her work and accomplished great but unmaterialistic things.  <br/>
(Many others that are as revolutionary and influential in their<br/>
professions like, Stravinsky or Picasso, made a lot more money eventually.  <br/>
But dance probably because it is a &quot;female&quot; art form --that&#39;s for another<br/>
discussion-- never &quot;pays&quot; very well).  Truly inspirational, for me. <br/>
