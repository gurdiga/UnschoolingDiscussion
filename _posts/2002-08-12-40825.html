 </span></blockquote>Well Ned, you are probably right. It wasn&#39;t so much a question about <br/>
unschooling in general, but a question posed to those here who are more <br/>
experienced in this matter than I, about how this could affect my <br/>
unschooling. It amazes me how nasty people can get, you attack me for my dumb <br/>
little question from the suburbs, (actually we live in an older section of <br/>
town, bordering on ghettoish. Our street is quiet, and there is a nice <br/>
community center down the road. Our home is two stories, 6 rooms plus a <br/>
bathroom, hardly suburban life.) you attack others for questions about Hooked <br/>
on Phonics, and Powerglide. Why do I even bother replying to your post? How <br/>
will people learn about the things they want to learn about if they can&#39;t ask <br/>
a question?  If people fear recrimination or attack, they won&#39;t ask <br/>
questions, if they don&#39;t ask questions, how will they unschool? I came here <br/>
to learn, to ask questions, to bounce my ideas off of people like Tia, <br/>
Sandra, Mary, Pam, Joyce, Brenda and everyone else. I guess, I have used up <br/>
my time here since my questions are too suburban. Bye to all.<br/>
Bye to the nastiness<br/>

I hope Nancy&#39;s just going to take a break and not really leave the list.  <br/>
I&#39;ve enjoyed her posts, and she&#39;s actually unschooling!  Ned just has a <br/>
graduated living-elsewhere son to brag about.   Ned&#39;s forgotten that parents <br/>
often have young children.  <br/>
<br/>
Sandra, who had THREE young children when the unschooling started:  five, <br/>
two, and one in the hopper, not to appear until November of that first year <br/>
of homeschooling.  I DO know that concerns of how to handle babies and <br/>
toddlers while homeschooling are more immediate and real than the history of <br/>
schools in Connecticut.<br/>

It is not fair to everyone here that people who have been here for a while,<br/>
contributing in positive ways to our discussions are leaving due to the<br/>
nastiness of one person. If everyone who cares deeply about this list leaves<br/>
because Ned can&#39;t keep his obnoxious barbs to himself, there will be<br/>
nothing.<br/>
No one to answer questions, no one to help people look at their life in an<br/>
unschooling context, no one who cares.<br/>
It&#39;s time for Ned to go.<br/>
