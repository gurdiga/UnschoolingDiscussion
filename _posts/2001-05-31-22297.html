Pack of 6 kids and dogs hold off cops<br/>
Wednesday, May 30, 2001<br/>
<br/>
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS<br/>
<br/>
SANDPOINT, Idaho -- Six children, believed to be hungry and armed, <br/>
refused to leave their rural home and instead released their pack of <br/>
vicious dogs on sheriff&#39;s deputies who had earlier arrested their <br/>
mother, the Bonner County sheriff said.<br/>
<br/>
Deputies retreated from the rural house Tuesday evening and were <br/>
pondering their next move Wednesday morning.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I told them, `We&#39;re just going to defuse it, we&#39;re leaving,&#39;&quot; <br/>
Sheriff Phil Jarvis said Tuesday night. &quot;I&#39;m not going to get into a <br/>
Randy Weaver  thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In 1992 at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, the wife and son of white separatist <br/>
Randy Weaver were killed during a standoff with federal agents.<br/>
<br/>
The children, ranging in ages from 8 to 16, would not respond to <br/>
calls from social workers or law enforcement officers during a <br/>
two-hour standoff Tuesday.<br/>
<br/>
The incident was triggered by the arrest Tuesday of the children&#39;s <br/>
mother, Joann McGuckin, on a warrant charging felony injury to a <br/>
child. Authorities believe McGuckin, 46, is mentally ill. Her husband <br/>
died more than a week ago, Jarvis said.<br/>
<br/>
Further information on the warrant was not immediately available.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We know there are six children in there and guns in the house. The <br/>
kids are trained to use the guns,&quot; Jarvis said. &quot;We&#39;ve been working <br/>
for four or five days trying to figure out how to get the mom off the <br/>
property and get her in a mental hold.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
McGuckin owns 27 dogs, which have been running free and hunting as a <br/>
pack in the area, Jarvis said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They hunt. They pack like wild animals,&quot; Jarvis said. &quot;They took <br/>
down a moose a little while ago.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On May 21, the dogs attacked a woman who was walking near the house, <br/>
Jarvis said. Stephanie Almy suffered bites requiring 17 stitches, and <br/>
a deputy who rescued her was also bitten.<br/>
<br/>
McGuckin retreated into the house and agreed to put all the dogs in <br/>
the basement, except two. She refused to come out of the house <br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
The home lacks power, water and heat. The children are in the care of <br/>
their 16-year-old sister, Jarvis said.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve been home-schooled, he said.<br/>
<br/>
A 19-year-old sister who left home some time ago has been assisting <br/>
the sheriff&#39;s department.<br/>
<br/>
The family is &quot;absolutely stone broke,&quot; Jarvis said. Deputies <br/>
developed a plan to bring McGuckin some money, thinking she might <br/>
leave the house to get groceries.<br/>
<br/>
A deputy delivered the money Tuesday and McGuckin agreed to go with <br/>
him to Garfield Bay to make the call. At about 4 p.m. Tuesday, <br/>
McGuckin was taken into custody at Garfield Bay.<br/>
<br/>
Deputies returned to the home to get the children and put them in the <br/>
custody of state Department of Health and Welfare.<br/>
<br/>
As a deputy was explaining the situation to the 15-year-old boy, he <br/>
&quot;runs back to the house and yells, `Get the guns,&#39;&quot; Jarvis said. <br/>
&quot;They let all the dogs out of the basement. The dogs were attacking <br/>
again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After warding off the dogs with gunshots, officers used a loudspeaker <br/>
to try to talk the kids out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We were trying to convince them that we weren&#39;t there to hurt them, <br/>
and that we were there to assist them, to get them housing and food,&quot; <br/>
Jarvis said.<br/>
<br/>
At about 7 p.m., the officers left.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The children are no worse than they were night before last,&quot; Jarvis <br/>
said. &quot;They&#39;re in the care of their 16-year-old sister.&quot;<br/>
