&gt;&gt;&gt; www.Borntoexplore.org/unschool<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The webmaster generously alloted a page to Luz and me to include a few of<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; our articles. Please send your comments to this group.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ned and Luz, I LOVED your entire website. I&#39;m even thinking about printing<br/>
&gt; out a couple of your articles to keep in my wallet to hand to people when<br/>
&gt; they ask why or how we homeschool.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Mary!<br/>
Yes, please feel free to pass on any of our articles.<br/>
