 </span></blockquote>Interesting twist to this...We are in the process of adopting from foster<br/>
care and are dealing with issues of adopting cross racially.  One problem<br/>
adoptive parents of these kids often find, is that when members of the<br/>
child&#39;s race see the family out in public, they often feel justified in<br/>
offering unwanted advice, interfering with parenting and in other ways<br/>
stick their noses in.  There is some sort of &quot;racial belonging&quot; that makes<br/>
them think they have more of a claim to the child than the other-race<br/>
adoptive parents.  I have heard numerous stories from adoptive parents<br/>
about being chided or downright upbrarided for some percieved inadequancy<br/>
in parenting these children.  Adoptive parents of different race children<br/>
also feel somehow obliged to humor these intrusions and do their best to<br/>
please the entire community of their child&#39;s race (an impossible task.)  It<br/>
is as if the attitude: &quot;This child is not yours.  You are just borrowing<br/>
this child from us, and you really should not have them.&quot;  is infectious,<br/>
and leaves the adoptive parents feeling like maybe they don&#39;t have as much<br/>
claim to raise this child as they see fit, just as they would a birth<br/>
child, but maybe they must seek advice from every stranger on the street.<br/>
<br/>
This thinking, and attitude, is just as wrong-headed to me as thinking of<br/>
children as the property of parents.  They are their own people, and<br/>
entitled to feel out and decide about their own connections to their racial<br/>
heritage.  It&#39;s our responsiblity to see that they have the tools necessary<br/>
to develop a healthy self image and cultural identity.  But they are every<br/>
bit as much a part of the family&#39;s culture as they are any birth culture,<br/>
and we should take our cues from them about it.<br/>
