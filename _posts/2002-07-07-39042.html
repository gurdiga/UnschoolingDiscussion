&lt;&lt; intransitive senses<br/>

<br/>
How would one &quot;act as a teacher&quot; and prove having taught in the absence of <br/>
any learning?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People get paid to teach even when nobody learns!  But I think it&#39;s very <br/>
strange to refer to &quot;I teach&quot; as intransitive, as being a verb which requires <br/>
no object/learner/student.<br/>
<br/>
If a teacher lectures in the forest and nobody hears it...<br/>
If a teacher lectures in a classroom and nobody&#39;s actually listening...<br/>
If a teacher presents a lesson and everyone there already knows the <br/>
material...<br/>
<br/>
There is no teaching happening.<br/>
