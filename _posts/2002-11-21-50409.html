<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507255215">I would just like to say I&#39;m quite happy. I also felt uncomfortable with the <br/>
post about not allowing IM etc to be sent unless they had the spelling <br/>
checked.<br/>
It appears this person is very angry quite simply because they do not &#39;get&#39; <br/>
the philosophy of unschooling and are on the defensive. It doesn&#39;t seem much <br/>
different from the confrontations between those who school and those who <br/>
don&#39;t.<br/>
I would agree that maybe they are looking a for a different type of <br/>
homeschooling and not unschooling at all. It does appear as if they are <br/>
trying to redefine unschooling to fit in with their idea of homeschooling.<br/>
I think this debate is on a hiding to nowhere as the person isn&#39;t even <br/>
listening to the posts about how easy it is to misunderstand what people are <br/>
saying. I find their posts extremely aggressive at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
