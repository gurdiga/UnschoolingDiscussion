(wo)man is &quot;God&quot;.  That belief leds me to the conclusion that children do<br/>
choose their parents.  I don&#39;t say this to justify abuse.  I had an abusive<br/>
parent.  The lessons I&#39;ve learned and the person I am is in large part because<br/>
of that abusive parent.  I don&#39;t believe I&#39;d try half as hard to be a better<br/>
parent if I didn&#39;t have the parents I had.  That&#39;s not to say that the abuse<br/>
was needed or contributed anything positive to my life.  It didn&#39;t.  But the<br/>
negative experiences I had because of that abuse do make me more aware of the<br/>
impact I have on my son&#39;s life.  And it makes me try harder to be a better<br/>
parent.  Life is a constant series of lessons learned through experiences,<br/>
good and bad.  And I also believe in reincarnation, so who knows what I was<br/>
about in a prior life?<br/>

any idea what kind of crap people do to their kids out there? Is it okay<br/>
for parents to make their kids drink piss because they forgot to flush<br/>
the toilet? How about beating them bloody for not brushing their hair<br/>
right and then locking them in a hot, stuffy attic room for 3 days with<br/>
no bathroom and no food? Is that really all okay with God? If he<br/>
intentionally places kids with those parents then he&#39;s one sick bastard.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-89820627">I don&#39;t explain or justify it.  Abuse is never justified.  The way I see it<br/>
that parent will pay for not honoring that child and for not guiding that<br/>
child in a responsible and loving way.  Where and how they will pay I don&#39;t<br/>
know?  But it will happen.  I believe this from my own experiences with an<br/>
abusive parent.    <br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t clear enough.  I believe man creates by thought, by deed and by<br/>
words.  I don&#39;t believe everyone&#39;s world is the same as mine.  I should more<br/>
correctly have said that I chose MY parents and I believe MY child chose his. <br/>
If a person believes that Jesus or Jehovah or some other God created them than<br/>
I accept that in THEIR world that is reality, but in my world it isn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
I just read the stories of a couple of posters that touched really close to<br/>
home for me.  Our  parents&#39; actions were wrong, by how do we deny that out of<br/>
these situations came people determined to be more loving to their own<br/>
children?  It would be ideal if evil was not a part of life but it is and it<br/>
is for a reason.   <br/>

all of us are, innocent. He was severely mistreated as a child and<br/>
created evil from that pain and maiming. I believe that he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have been as successful in his compulsion to spread his pain as he<br/>
was if he hadn&#39;t also been supported and surrounded by others who<br/>
had also been severely mistreated as children. <br/>

The fascination and the horror of Hitler, and his followers, isn&#39;t<br/>

the same. The Prussian model of child rearing and education<br/>
permeates our entire society. Stalin killed millions, as did Mao,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653738462">I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t make it more clear that I don&#39;t believe the child<br/>
(spirit)is choosing an abusive parent.  I believe the parent makes the choice<br/>
to be abusive.  The parent has the capacity to choose to be loving.  When the<br/>
parent decides to choose the wrong route they place a burden on the child<br/>
instead of empowering the child.  The child must know seek the loving path.  I<br/>
believe in responsibility for actions.  I made a conscious choice before my<br/>
son was born to be a non-spanking, loving parent (I only know 1 other black<br/>
mother who doesn&#39;t spank, my sister).  I have other issues I&#39;m working on<br/>
freeing myself of, but I am aware of them.  I think conscious (right) choice<br/>
is the key to being a loving parent.  I feel fortunate that I&#39;ve met a few in<br/>
real-life and plenty on this list.<br/>
<br/>
I think evil is a part of this world because there are still people who choose<br/>
to practice it and who choose not to learn from the evil that was practiced on<br/>
them.  Hitler could not exist without other evil people to facilitate him.<br/>

How about mental illness?   Parents that didn&#39;t have any outlets, people that were raised with alot of abuse and only know that way of dealing with frustration.<br/>
