&gt; &lt;&lt; My sister is still angry at her 2nd grade teacher who denied her the<br/>
&gt; right to use the bathroom.  Second day at a new school and she pees all<br/>
&gt; over her seat because the teacher was just &quot;too busy&quot; teaching to let a<br/>
&gt; little girl go use the toilet.  Nice. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I bet if we just collected a book-length set of the tales of kids who have<br/>
&gt; been made to urinate or defecate out of fear of the teacher we&#39;d fill a<br/>
book<br/>
&gt; without ever getting to the &quot;I asked to go and she said no&quot; and never<br/>
NEVER get<br/>
&gt; to &quot;I finally got to go to recess and didn&#39;t want to miss a minute of<br/>
playing<br/>
&gt; to go pee so I went on the swing/slide accidentally.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Would anyone ever send their children to school again?   Would teachers<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; showed up in the tellings more than once need to have court-ordered<br/>
parenting<br/>
&gt; classes or fine/jail time for child abuse?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s horrible when these stories get rolling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yet from the teachers&#39; point of view, I think all teachers know of kids<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; said they needed to go but really wanted to go visiting, or to smoke, or<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; vandalize some enemy&#39;s locker, or worse than any of that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So the answer is:   Keep your kids home if you can!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tadaa!    My kids can spend all the time in the bathroom they want now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that is one of the things that FINALLY allowed my husband to agree to <br/>
keep our youngest home.  She had a female emergency and asked to go to the <br/>
bathroom.  The teacher said no, repeatedly said NO.  She even told him the <br/>
reason why she had to go, humiliated as he made her say it outloud to the class.  <br/>
She was young, in middle school, kids were hooting and carrying on.  The <br/>
teacher, a very young first year male teacher, seemed to make a game of it.  Cait <br/>
was a quiet student and would never have asked to go at all if it weren&#39;t an <br/>
emergency.  He knew she wasn&#39;t a loud student who would be demanding and just <br/>
walk out.  He was a bully on a power trip and enjoying it.  He made a point of <br/>
letting two other flirty type girls go to the bathroom when they asked once, <br/>
after Cait repeatedly asked.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily it was the last class of the day, and she came home, devastated and <br/>
in tears.  She certainly would not be returning to that mess.  As it happened <br/>
her dad was home when she came in and he finally saw the devastation that <br/>
school was causing.  He went immediately to the school and met with principals and <br/>
everyone he could find (and probably a good thing he couldn&#39;t find the <br/>
teacher) and explained the situation and how if this teacher EVER embarrassed a child <br/>
like that again he would promptly find a way to embarrass the teacher equally <br/>
in front of his peers.<br/>
<br/>
I got phone calls from parents of students who were in the room that <br/>
afternoon, asking if it was true and saying they were sorry and their children felt <br/>
badly they hadn&#39;t in some way tried to defend or stop the ugliness.<br/>
<br/>
The teacher still teaches, they just moved him to the high school and now let <br/>
him coach there too.  Guess they figured as a first year teacher he had a lot <br/>
to learn about dealing with children and they would somehow help him.<br/>
<br/>
Teachers are all across the spectrum of society, just like with everything <br/>
else.  There can be mean bully types and kind loving dedicated types and <br/>
everything in between.  I can&#39;t see taking the chance with a child of mine to go <br/>
through anything like that again.  As a parent you really have no control other <br/>
than taking the child out of school to stop things or defend things like that.  <br/>
The school almost always tends to &quot;follow the party line&quot; and defend the <br/>
teacher (best in case of lawsuits) and make the child and parents feel less than.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe some children wouldn&#39;t be so deeply affected by an incident like this. <br/>
I wish I had pushed my DH sooner to keep my children home, she would have <br/>
never had to experience it.<br/>
