<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718770378">The way I see it, dogs had this big meeting, oh, maybe 20,000 years ago. A <br/>
huge meeting - an international convention with delegates from everywhere. <br/>
And that&#39;s when they decided that humans were the up-and-coming species <br/>
and dogs were going to throw their lot in with them. The decision was <br/>
obviously not unanimous. The wolves and dingoes walked out in protest. <br/>
 <br/>
Cats had an even more negative reaction. When they heard the news, they <br/>
called their own meeting - in Paris, of course - to denounce canine <br/>
subservience to the human hyperpower. (Their manifesto - La Condition <br/>
Feline - can still be found in provincial bookstores.) <br/>
 <br/>
Cats, it must be said, have not done badly. Using guile and seduction, <br/>
they managed to get humans to feed them, thus preserving their <br/>
superciliousness without going hungry. A neat trick. Dogs, being <br/>
guileless, signed and delivered. It was the beginning of a beautiful <br/>
friendship. <br/>
<br/>
I must admit that I&#39;ve been slow to warm to dogs. I grew up in a <br/>
non-pet-friendly home. Dogs do not figure prominently in Jewish-immigrant <br/>
households. My father was not very high on pets. He wasn&#39;t hostile. He <br/>
just saw them as superfluous, an encumbrance. When the Cossacks are <br/>
chasing you around Europe, you need to travel light. (This, by the way, is <br/>
why Europe produced far more Jewish violinists than pianists. Try packing <br/>
a piano.) <br/>
<br/>
My parents did allow a hint of zoological indulgence. I had a pet turtle. <br/>
My brother had a parakeet. Both came to unfortunate ends. My turtle fell <br/>
behind a radiator and was not discovered until too late. And the parakeet, <br/>
God bless him, flew out a window once, never to be seen again. After such <br/>
displays of stewardship, we dared not ask for a dog. <br/>
 <br/>
My introduction to the wonder of dogs came from my wife Robyn. She&#39;s <br/>
Australian. And Australia, as lovingly recounted in Bill Bryson&#39;s In a <br/>
Sunburned Country, has the craziest, wildest, deadliest, meanest animals <br/>
on the planet. In a place where every spider and squid can take you down <br/>
faster than a sucker-punched boxer, you cherish niceness in the animal <br/>
kingdom. And they don&#39;t come nicer than dogs. <br/>
 <br/>
Robyn started us off slowly. She got us a border collie, Hugo, when our <br/>
son was about 6. She knew that would appeal to me because the border <br/>
collie is the smartest species on the planet. Hugo could 1) play outfield <br/>
in our backyard baseball games, 2) do flawless front-door sentry duty, and  <br/>
3) play psychic weatherman, announcing with a wail every coming <br/>
thunderstorm. <br/>
 <br/>
When our son Daniel turned 10, he wanted a dog of his own. I was against <br/>
it, using arguments borrowed from seminars on nuclear nonproliferation. It <br/>
was hopeless. One giant &quot;Please, Dad,&quot; and I caved completely. Robyn went <br/>
out to Winchester, Va., found a litter of black Labs and brought home <br/>
Chester. <br/>
 <br/>
Chester is what psychiatrists mean when they talk about unconditional <br/>
love. Unbridled is more like it. Come into our house, and he was so happy <br/>
to see you, he would knock you over. (Deliverymen learned to leave things <br/>
at the front door.)<br/>
 <br/>
In some respects - Ph.D. potential, for example - I don&#39;t make any great <br/>
claims for Chester. When I would arrive home, I fully expected to find <br/>
Hugo reading the newspaper. Not Chester. Chester would try to make his way <br/>
through a narrow sliding door, find himself stuck halfway and then look at <br/>
me with total and quite genuine puzzlement. I don&#39;t think he ever got to <br/>
understand that the rear part of him was actually attached to the front. <br/>
 <br/>
But it was Chester, who dispensed affection as unreflectively as he <br/>
breathed, who got me thinking about this long-ago pact between humans and <br/>
dogs. Cat lovers and the pet averse will just roll their eyes at such <br/>
dogophilia. I can&#39;t help it. Chester was always at your foot or your hand, <br/>
waiting to be petted and stroked, played with and talked to. His beautiful <br/>
blocky head, his wonderful overgrown puppy&#39;s body, his baritone bark <br/>
filled every corner of house and heart. <br/>
 <br/>
Then last month, at the tender age of 8, he died quite suddenly. The long, <br/>
slobbering, slothful decline we had been looking forward to was not to be. <br/>
When told the news, a young friend who was a regular victim of Chester&#39;s <br/>
lunging love-bombs said mournfully, &quot;He was the sweetest creature I ever <br/>
saw. He&#39;s the only dog I ever saw kiss a cat.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Some will protest that in a world with so much human suffering, it is <br/>
something between eccentric and obscene to mourn a dog. I think not. After <br/>
all, it is perfectly normal, indeed, deeply human to be moved when nature <br/>
presents us with a vision of great beauty. Should we not be moved when it <br/>
produces a vision - a creature - of the purest sweetness? <br/>

  Yes, thanks for posting this.  My animals are very much my other children.  I know people who object to that, but I don&#39;t care.  They have the sweetest and purest spirits and are totally dependent on us, not just for a few years, but for their entire lives.  *Everything* about their &#39;quality&#39; of life depends on how we treat them.<br/>
<br/>
  My dog really is one of my best friends, and she knows it.  She loves me and asks nothing in return.  That is the sweetest kind of love there is.<br/>
