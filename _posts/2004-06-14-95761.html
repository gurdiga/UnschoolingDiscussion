<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100528413">I can remember when I was a kid and I would be reading something I <br/>
would go ask my mom what such-and-such a word meant.  She would <br/>
never just tell me what it meant she would always say &quot;go look it up <br/>
in the dictionary&quot;.  Of course, now I know what she was trying to <br/>
do, but do you think I EVER looked up ONE word?  Heck no!  <br/>
<br/>
Now, as far as multiplication tricks go, I have a larger question at <br/>
hand.  My kids (ages 10 and 8) have had a very brief stint with a <br/>
mathematics curriculum, but we never got as far as multiplication.  <br/>
In fact, we never even got as far as adding two digit numbers.  So I <br/>
am seriously wondering, will they learn things like 7X8=56 without <br/>
any formal instruction?  And does it matter?  I mean, we do need to <br/>
understand some math in order to function in this society.  But do <br/>
we necessarily need someone to &quot;teach&quot; it to us?  (hey, <br/>
someone &quot;taught&quot; me and I still am quite foggy about a lot of <br/>
concepts)<br/>
Anyone have some words of wisdom and experience on this one?</div>

Now that you know what she was trying to do, does that make it a good thing <br/>
to have tried to do? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I wrote years ago. It&#39;s short, but shaming.   People should <br/>
just answer their kids&#39; questions, I think, and not be mean or hypocritical in <br/>
the name of &quot;education.&quot;<br/>

&quot;How Not to use Reference Materials , which is actually in favor of using <br/>
reference materials, just not in favor of abusing kids with them.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
The majority of people WITH formal intruction don&#39;t memorize that.  The <br/>
trauma and mystery overwhelm the &quot;simple fact,&quot; and multiplication shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
&quot;simple facts&quot; anyway, it should be the ability to KNOW how to re-construct that <br/>
number every time the situation arises in the real world, which 1) is not very <br/>
often and 2) makes it possible for the person to figure out ANY other &quot;fact.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some info on  how my kids and some other unschoolers deal/dealt with <br/>
multiplication:<br/>
