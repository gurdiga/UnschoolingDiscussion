<br/>
Thanks for responding to my post.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; we pulled isaac out after 2nd grade adn he needed 3 mo to deschool. it was<br/>
 hard but i gave him the time he needed and kept the lines of communication<br/>
 open.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Did you limit his TV or did you just let him have free time?<br/>
 <br/>
Regarding Math &lt;&lt;if he gets it right and enjoys it does it matter if he does <br/>
it the way the school does.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My concern is that it might be confusing for him as he approaches the higher <br/>
levels of math.  I suppose however my concern might be based on my math <br/>
anxiety rather than his ability.  Hmmmmmmm, I&#39;ll have to look at this one <br/>
again.<br/>

You wrote:  &lt;&lt;I&#39;d suggest since<br/>
 it&#39;s the end of the year anyway that you are starting. Take the summer to<br/>
 heal as a family. Let the children suggest activities that they&#39;d missed<br/>
 doing (if you are up to it) if it helps carry a notepad to jot down the<br/>
 things that you&#39;ve discussed/done that would fit into the &quot;subject areas&quot;<br/>
 if you were keeping track or had to for your district. That way you may<br/>
 feel more comfortable with unschooling while at the same time you will all<br/>
 be together learning about each other.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That sounds like a wonderful idea.  More than anything I think the notebook <br/>
will help me keep on track so I stay calm.  I know Wes and I could really use <br/>
some bonding time.  He has already talked about wanting to learn cartooning <br/>
and some other things that he can&#39;t learn in a traditional school setting.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Wow, mine was 10 and because of a horrible experience being labeled ADD and<br/>
 being told he&#39;d never make it in the real world he had no self esteem.. It<br/>
 took him the entire first year home and then a couple more months. But once<br/>
 he found that he wasn&#39;t stupid he perked right up and has been so happy.<br/>
 Hopefully it won&#39;t take that long for you.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This kind of thing tears me up because I went through a very similar <br/>
experience as a child.  Because I was only 4 years old when I entered <br/>
Kindergarten I was labeled immature and by 3rd grade I couldn&#39;t get the math. <br/>
 It didn&#39;t matter to the school that I was reading a middle school level, the <br/>
fact was that I didn&#39;t fit into their box and so I was labeled with poor math <br/>
skills.  Thereby affecting my entire life for more than 20 years and even now <br/>
I still suffer from that experience.<br/>
<br/>
Good for you for taking him out and giving him the time he needed to know <br/>
that he is an intelligent and capable human being.  Most kids labeled with <br/>
ADD are very intelligent!<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; &gt; What are your experiences and how have you coped with having a toddler <br/>
in <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">      &gt;the house?<br/>
 </span></blockquote> When mine were small, (and before school) they spent a lot of time outside.<br/>
 The younger one would play hours of basketball on the court so I&#39;d find a<br/>
 seat and let him play. During that time my oldest could ride his bike<br/>
 around where I could see or could have my attention. We read a lot while<br/>
 the younger one, supposedly playing basketball, actually listened.  I<br/>
 realized how much he was listening when last year I asked him if he wanted<br/>
 me to read him Tom Sawyer as it was one of his brothers favorites. He told<br/>
 me he remembered me reading it while he played basketball.  I didn&#39;t really<br/>
 believe he remembered the story, but just to prove the point he told me the<br/>
 story mostly in order letting me know all his favorite parts. BTW his<br/>
 favorite part was how Tom convinced the others to whitewash the fence. He<br/>
 did ask what whitewash was, but he knew the story.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wow this is great!  I have started reading the Lion the Witch and the <br/>
Wardrobe series to my kids.  Wesley loves it and I am hoping to get him to a <br/>
point where he wants to read it by himself (or any book for that matter).  <br/>
But Mara my 2 yo also sits and listens for as long as her two year old <br/>
attention span will allow her to.<br/>
<br/>
I heard something recently that says that performing movement at the same <br/>
time one is learning something new actually helps the learner retain the <br/>
information better because when we move we use our &quot;lower brain&quot; and anything <br/>
we learn with our bodies or moving while learning is stored for more long <br/>
term retention.  Please don&#39;t quote me on this I only heard it once and I was <br/>
not performing any activity to help me retain the information better!  But if <br/>
what I heard is true it is entirely possible that your younger was &quot;helped&quot; <br/>
by playing basketball while he was listening!<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt;It&#39;s different at each stage. I&#39;m a single mother so I&#39;ve never had time<br/>
 away. When they were little, they had bedtimes so that was my time, when<br/>
 they came home from school they were older so they didn&#39;t want a bedtime,<br/>
 now my time is when they go out to play as they don&#39;t need me to follow<br/>
 them around.   You&#39;ll find your time, even if it&#39;s getting up a little<br/>
 earlier for that one cup of tea before everyone wakes.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Please forgive my nosiness but how do you homeschool and support your family <br/>
at the same time?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; I currently find it very challenging finding time just to pay the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;bills let alone make time for myself without taking my daughter to someone <br/>
 &gt;else&#39;s house.<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote> Your son could probably help pay the bills, my son loves putting together<br/>
 the budget. He is a great help to me with that, and he never forgets any of<br/>
 the little things that I tend to forget.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What an awesome idea!!  I could really use some help!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Naticia<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759859591">Lois,<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt;  Math and PE got whole pies because he really likes those subjects.  Art <br/>
got <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;only 1/8 of a pie. <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote> Did you keep the pie charts?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I did.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  These could be really helpful to you in<br/>
 realizing just what he would like to do each day. My son also liked PE the<br/>
 most in school. So we made sure to have lots of physical things spread out<br/>
 through the week.  With art getting so little a section, maybe he just<br/>
 needs to see real art.  My children hated art at school.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The reason Wes hates art is because he was forced to paint flowers in <br/>
watercolors.  Last fall he told me he wanted to take a class in cartooning so <br/>
I&#39;m going to find him one this fall.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Each year they<br/>
 made ceramics. they hated ceramics by the time they left. I have so many<br/>
 bowls I don&#39;t know what to do with them. That&#39;s all they made, bowls.  But<br/>
 they saw me crocheting and asked me to show them how, they both did well<br/>
 and enjoyed it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that art is something that should be explored not forced.  I <br/>
too would dislike anything that someone told me I had to do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; &gt;I called another elementary school that 2 moms had recommended to see if <br/>
we <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;could come visit.  The receptionist said that we could but that it would be <br/>
 &gt;better to wait until June because things would be more settled then.  <br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> My first sign that that wouldn&#39;t be the place for us. I don&#39;t like anyplace<br/>
 that wants me to wait until things settle down more.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I actually called two other schools the next week.  One of them, our <br/>
neighborhood school, said that they didn&#39;t allow children to observe because <br/>
it was too disruptive to the class.  And the next school closest to us warned <br/>
me that the were expecting their fourth grade classes to have about 36 kids <br/>
in each class and that they couldn&#39;t get funding to hire anything more than a <br/>
teacher&#39;s aid.  Jeff and I decided that we didn&#39;t need to waste our time <br/>
visiting.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; For me I didn&#39;t know I could hs my children. Then I listened to<br/>
 family/friends who reminded me that while I had my degree, I wasn&#39;t all<br/>
 that good at math and wouldn&#39;t be able to teach them. I wish I would have<br/>
 done it sooner, but then I think about the way this happened for us and<br/>
 realized that while I can&#39;t change the past at least I listened to my<br/>
 children and let them make the decision. Now at least I won&#39;t have to worry<br/>
 about them coming back asking why I never let them go to school.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As parents we do the best we can at any given moment.  The important thing is <br/>
that you listened to your kids and acted on it.  This is what good parenting <br/>
is all about.  If kids came with instruction manuals at birth it would be <br/>
easier to know what type of education would be best for each child but since <br/>
they don&#39;t you just head in a direction until you discover you need to change.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;You&#39;ll do great. You&#39;re already looking at your options but most<br/>
 importantly you are listening to your son.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the vote of confidence!<br/>

&lt;&lt; If you&#39;ve made it this far, thank you for listening.  I am open to <br/>

Naticia,<br/>
 I have read your whole story and I just want to welcome you and let you know <br/>
that you have chosen a really great journey, and this is a great place to get <br/>
support.  When I started, I was so afraid that I wouldn&#39;t do the right thing, <br/>
that I bought one of the more structured curriculum, because it was detailed <br/>
and told me what to do day to day, after 3 weeks I threw that away and went <br/>
for my own stuff.  After, 5 years, I am between styles, and you know what? I <br/>
just don&#39;t even have a style!  I just do what works for my family and don&#39;t <br/>
give a rats behind what anyone thinks is THE way or not.  You choose what <br/>
works for you, if it is more structured to begin with, that is no great sin, <br/>
sometimes people have to gain confidence as they go.  The ultimate goal is to <br/>
make learning a lifelong, enjoyable trip and it is based on trial and error.  <br/>
Don&#39;t let anyone discourage you from whatever style you decide to use, you <br/>
will evolve to your ultimate teaching/learning style in good time. The <br/>
important thing is that you love and value your kids and want to do the best <br/>
you can for them.<br/>

gets worse from there. But the year before I&#39;d already read the entire<br/>
Little woman novel on my own so the Dick and Jane books bored me to tears.<br/>
They brought me 8th grade readers (the highest grade in the school) but<br/>
those were too easy and still boring. From then on the teachers pretty much<br/>
ignored me. <br/>

they just can&#39;t sit still for long as they get bored and the mind will<br/>
wander, but if their hands are busy they can concentrate better.  All I<br/>
know is that my youngest still gets more out of being read to, and boy does<br/>

writes:&lt;&lt;  Is he having trouble with the multiplication, or are you <br/>
anticipating? Our<br/>
 conventions for adding, etc., are just that--conventions. I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
 interfere if he&#39;s not having trouble. He sounds like he understands how the<br/>
 numbers really work, what really happens with carrying, for instance, which<br/>
 puts him well ahead of an awful lot of people who add conventionally but<br/>
 don&#39;t really understand what they&#39;re doing and why it works.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it is my own math anxiety creeping in.  Hmmmmmmm, I think I&#39;m gonna <br/>
have to work on this one.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; As long as you&#39;re not trying to replicate school at home, it&#39;s no harder to<br/>
 homeschool with a toddler than it is to live with one, which may or may not<br/>
 be reassuring!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that is the root of the challenge.  We are going to have to find a <br/>
way to live with her till she gets through this &quot;my&quot; stage.  Right now <br/>
everything is hers and although Wes is very patient he does get sick of it <br/>
all.  She is VERY attached and very possessive of me.  She will even go so <br/>
far as to scream at the top of her lungs if she sees anyone so much as touch <br/>
me without her permission!  No matter how many times I tell her that I gave <br/>
them permission to hug me or whatever she still gets very upset.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I have a 2 yo right now, and was homeschooling when the now-6<br/>
 yo was 2. He&#39;s into stuff, which means we have to be careful where we leave<br/>
 important or easily wrecked projects. He likes to do what the big kids are<br/>
 doing, so I try to include him in whatever we&#39;re doing, only at his level.<br/>
 And we take advantage of the fact that dh is around in the evening to corral<br/>
 him while I&#39;m reading to the older kids, if he&#39;s disruptive.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Hmmmmmmm, I think my DH and Mara are going to be spending more time <br/>
together in the future.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;m one of those people who really craves alone time.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too which is one of my current fears about Hs.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I have three kids at<br/>
 home, ages 10, 6, and 2. Frankly, having the older ones home makes life<br/>
 easier for me, because a certain amount of the day the littlest is<br/>
 entertained by the older ones. He also still naps, which is good down time<br/>
 for me, unless the older are wanting to do something special with me then.<br/>
 I just grab the time I can--first thing in the a.m., many days; in the<br/>
 afternoon during the littlest&#39;s nap time; whenever they&#39;re off playing<br/>
 together. I don&#39;t spend the whole day intensely involved with my kids. They<br/>
 spend a lot of every day at play--sometimes together, sometimes separately.<br/>
 So I&#39;ve not found getting my time alone to be all that hard. Also, dh is<br/>
 always willing if I need an evening out or a Saturday morning out or<br/>
 whatever.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like it&#39;s just a matter of balancing.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; Your daughter won&#39;t always be 2--it won&#39;t always be this way, promise.&gt;&gt;<br/>
Yes, time fixes all.<br/>

&lt;&lt; It takes at least a year sometimes several years.  This is what I&#39;ve read <br/>
and <br/>
 experienced.  My two oldest children (I have five) were in school until they <br/>
 were 7 and 10.  We, like you, had them in a &quot;good&quot; private school.  We were <br/>
 having problems with the school in various ways and my oldest (10 at the <br/>
 time) wanted to be homeschooled.  We definitely unschool.  My children have <br/>
 been out of school for three years and I think I&#39;ve had them back for 1 <br/>
maybe <br/>
 1 1/2 years.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kimme,<br/>
It&#39;s good to know that it may take longer than 6 months.  I am willing to <br/>
hang in there for as long as it takes.<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt;  I have an 18 month old but she is just part of things.  The kids work <br/>
 together on most things they do.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is one of those situations, I imagine, where having a lot of kids is <br/>
easier than having one or two.  I think once we get past Mara&#39;s &quot;my mommy&quot; <br/>
stage life will become easier.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; &lt; She encouraged me to read Dumbing Us Down, The Unschooling Handbook and  <br/>
&quot;anything by Holt&quot;.  &gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 These are great suggestions.  I would also recommend subscribing to Growing <br/>
 Without Schooling and Home Education Magazine.  If there is a support group <br/>
 in your area, find them.  You are doing the right thing.  You will not <br/>
regret <br/>
 this.  Good Luck!  Kimme&gt;&gt;<br/>

How do I can I get a subscription with either of those publications?<br/>

Thanks for your kind words.  Of all the things I have heard and read so far, <br/>
the two pieces of advice that stand out the most is that I don&#39;t need to <br/>
spend a lot of money on curriculum and I don&#39;t need to recreate school at <br/>
home.  Honestly, I don&#39;t know if I could have school at home even if I really <br/>
wanted to (or spend a lot of money for that matter).<br/>
<br/>
The message I read in your post is to follow my instinct and do what feels <br/>
right.  I think I will do just that.  I really need to connect with Wesley so <br/>
I&#39;m going to focus my efforts on making him feel special and important.  He <br/>
deserves that at the very least.  Then I&#39;ll let him tell me what he wants to <br/>
learn next and go for it.<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Naticia<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have read your whole story and I just want to welcome you and let you <br/>
know <br/>
 that you have chosen a really great journey, and this is a great place to <br/>
get <br/>
 support.  When I started, I was so afraid that I wouldn&#39;t do the right <br/>
thing, <br/>
 that I bought one of the more structured curriculum, because it was detailed <br/>
 and told me what to do day to day, after 3 weeks I threw that away and went <br/>
 for my own stuff.  After, 5 years, I am between styles, and you know what? I <br/>
 just don&#39;t even have a style!  I just do what works for my family and don&#39;t <br/>
 give a rats behind what anyone thinks is THE way or not.  You choose what <br/>
 works for you, if it is more structured to begin with, that is no great sin, <br/>
 sometimes people have to gain confidence as they go.  The ultimate goal is <br/>
to <br/>
 make learning a lifelong, enjoyable trip and it is based on trial and error. <br/>
 <br/>
 Don&#39;t let anyone discourage you from whatever style you decide to use, you <br/>
 will evolve to your ultimate teaching/learning style in good time. The <br/>
 important thing is that you love and value your kids and want to do the best <br/>
 you can for them.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My situation was similar, I was tested before entering school and<br/>
 immediately was sent a grade higher. So at 5 I was sent to first grade, it<br/>
 gets worse from there. But the year before I&#39;d already read the entire<br/>
 Little woman novel on my own so the Dick and Jane books bored me to tears.<br/>
 They brought me 8th grade readers (the highest grade in the school) but<br/>
 those were too easy and still boring. From then on the teachers pretty much<br/>
 ignored me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too bad hs wasn&#39;t an option in those days.  It sounds like you would <br/>
have thrived in a hs situation.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; He may. I think the first thing my non reader read cover to cover was a<br/>
 book on the titanic because it gave him all the information he needed to<br/>
 work through a simulation game on the Titanic&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is the key!  Get them interested in something so much that they <br/>
will do ANYTHING to get the information including read!<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt; I&#39;ve heard similar things. The theory I heard is that for some children<br/>
 they just can&#39;t sit still for long as they get bored and the mind will<br/>
 wander, but if their hands are busy they can concentrate better.  All I<br/>
 know is that my youngest still gets more out of being read to, and boy does<br/>
 he, and he is usually doing something else at the same time.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This makes me feel better about my toddler daughter wiggling about the room <br/>
as I&#39;m trying to read a story.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;No problem. I am disabled so I recieve disability payments which allow me<br/>
 to stay home. I used to  work out of the house, I also for a while worked<br/>
 from home. But now I&#39;m just concentrating on the boys. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry to hear about your situation, but what a wonderful oppurtunity to <br/>
put your energy to something really important.<br/>

I am glad you got the message!  I know everything will turn out great if you <br/>
just keep remembering that it is your family and your life and if it feels <br/>
right ......do it!<br/>

&gt; Thank you for the positive reassurance.  I&#39;d really like to know the<br/>

I&#39;ve just completed a book &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me:  Adventures<br/>
in Homeschooling and Community-Based Education&quot; which is being published<br/>
by Holt Associates/New Society Publishers this fall.  It has a chapter<br/>
(&quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot;) on what we found to work in mathematics with two<br/>
very different kids.  I don&#39;t want to clutter up the list with<br/>
attachments, etc.  But if you want, I&#39;ll be happy to e-mail you the<br/>
chapter separately (let me know if you can accept Word attachments, or<br/>
needs to come the old-fashioned e-mail way.)  Only charge is you have to<br/>
tell me whether it resonates with your experience.<br/>
