<div id="ygrps-yiv-192790191">Hi all,<br/>
I am a voracious reader with a serious hang up.  I hate to read books that do not have a happy ending.  I may be a wimp. I am sure that I am missing out on some great literature. I just can&#39;t justify asking for sadness. I enjoy many kids books.  I read many animal/horse books when I was younger.  But even they are not &quot;safe&quot;.  Just look what they did to &#39;Old Yeller&quot;!  I like reading romance novels cause they always have a happy ending.  Anyone else with this issue?  Want to share your favorite reads ??<br/>

historical ones.<br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth Peter&#39;s Amelia Peabody series<br/>
Lillian Jackson Braun&#39;s The Cat Who series<br/>
Dorothy Gilman&#39;s Mrs. Polifax<br/>
Stephanie Barron&#39;s Jane Austen series<br/>
both of Anne Perry&#39;s series<br/>

 </span></blockquote>First kid&#39;s book I thought of after reading this was &quot;The Boxcar Children&quot; <br/>
(original book.)  I loved that book as a kid...such an adventure, kids living <br/>
by themselves in an old boxcar!  And I also loved &quot;My Father&#39;s Dragon.&quot;  I <br/>
had forgotten about that one until I saw it at a thrift store and a million <br/>
memories came flooding back into my head...There were 3 books in the <br/>
series...nice pictures too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-158234415">Speaking of longtime childhood favorites....my absolute favorite was Mandy.  <br/>
It was about an orphan girl who found a small house in the woods behind the <br/>
great brick wall of the orphanage.  She planted a garden, decorated and had <br/>
her own secret hide-away.  I had a very troubled childhood and that book was <br/>
my escape.  I still have my original copy.  Pages are torn, a few missing <br/>
and I only have the front cover, which is barely attached by the thread <br/>
binding.  I purchased a new copy for my children but alas, they don&#39;t find <br/>
comfort in that book as I once did.  I suppose that&#39;s a good thing! &lt;bg&gt;  I <br/>
still read it though.  Despite my reasons for loving it then, I still find <br/>
such joy in that book.  I&#39;m still a day-dreamer, dreaming of what I will do <br/>
to my house and yard, and find a lot of inspiration in that little gem of a <br/>
book. :)<br/>
<br/>
OH and it has a happy ending!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234871264">&lt;&lt;Oh, I loved that book so much!!!  My grandmother bought it for me and my<br/>
sister, and it was so wonderful. It&#39;s also by Julie Andrews, which is cool.<br/>
Kathryn&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m such a DOOFUS!  This thread inspired me to look up the authors name and <br/>
do a search to see what else she had written.<br/>
<br/>
DUH!  I always knew the author&#39;s name, but never in my life knew it was THE <br/>
Julie Andrews!  I guess it was the Edwards that threw me off.  Sheesh, I <br/>
feel like a big ooffus magoofus now. &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

favorites and now that you mention it, I think I will find it and read it <br/>
again!<br/>
I think it was by Julie Andrews wasn&#39;t it?<br/>
