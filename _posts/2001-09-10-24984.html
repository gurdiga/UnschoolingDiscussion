&gt; &gt; They choose what and when.   Bridget<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been reading these posts and there are some things I&#39;ve noticed.<br/>
<br/>
1.  It seems really important to Bridget that she be called a mother that <br/>
unschools her children.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Unschooling (as I understand it, please correct me if I&#39;m wrong) is <br/>
defined as letting kids choose to do what they want when they want, with us <br/>
offering resources, things for them to do (to which they can say yes or not), <br/>
giving them the common courtesies we would use with our hubbies or friends.<br/>
<br/>
3.  If my child (and I can only use my family as an example) Zak said to me <br/>
&quot;I really want you to assign me some kind of writing task each week.  I&#39;ll <br/>
(Zak) choose how much and what I write but I want you (Dawn) to hold me <br/>
accountable for the amount that I do&quot;.... I would want to have a conversation <br/>
with him about why he felt the need to have someone else direct and dictate <br/>
his life rather than himself.  <br/>
<br/>
Another example.  If my best friend Debra called and said &quot;I need you to <br/>
write an article for my local newspaper this week, you can write it on <br/>
anything you want and it can be as long as you want, but it has to be done in <br/>
the next 7 days&quot;.... I then have the choice to say yes or no to that <br/>
assignment.<br/>
<br/>
I think for me it&#39;s the idea that a child would willingly come to me and say <br/>
&quot;I want you to tell me to do something&quot; seems odd.  Maybe it&#39;s because my <br/>
child has not been to school long enough (only to 1 week in Kindgergarten, <br/>
Waldorf Style which is more like preschool) that he&#39;s not interested in me <br/>
assigning him anything.  It&#39;s hard enough to get his attention most of the <br/>
time to offer things he does like, let alone get him to want me to dictate to <br/>
him what he does!!!!  (Sorry that was a long sentence).<br/>
<br/>
I would be concerned about Zak&#39;s self esteem and what had happened to him to <br/>
make him rely on me &quot;making him accountable&quot; for writing or math, especially <br/>
as I&#39;m working towards being as radical an unschooler as possible (nothing <br/>
like going whole hog).<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I already explained the reasoning behind it.  It has to do with wanting<br/>
to go to college.  And please see my recent post about the jobs list.  I<br/>
realized during this conversation that the way it is written, they could<br/>
do NO schoolwork if they wanted to.  <br/>
