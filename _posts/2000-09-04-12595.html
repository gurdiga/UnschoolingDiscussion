Oh, it&#39;s probably everywhere.   We have the FCAT here in Florida.  According <br/>
to the paper yesterday, the first &quot;in-service&quot; training that new teachers are <br/>
getting this year is on the FCAT -- how to teach to it and how to give it.<br/>
<br/>
What can you say??<br/>
<br/>
My kids are over on the living room floor designing things with this set of <br/>
pattern blocks my mom go them.  Daughter:  &quot;I really like your idea, brother, <br/>
but I&#39;ve got an idea -- let me add a piece here.&quot;  Etc.<br/>
<br/>
My reality just doesn&#39;t have room for TAAS or FCAT or any of that right now.<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  And has anyone but me noticed how all the comics are about kids hating <br/>
having to go back to school this time of year?  Then again, perhaps my view <br/>
of the world shouldn&#39;t be ENTIRELY based on the comic strips!  :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797616863">Another thing that I thought was totally defeatest was that they are PAID<br/>
to get right answers, MONEY!  I mean, I always thought (and that&#39;s how we<br/>
work it) that education should be from the love of learning.  Geez, just<br/>
one more way to make good little greedy capitalists &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or the one that I saw on tv not too long ago (I think it was this same<br/>
group) that taught adding and subtracting with M & M&#39;s, Good & Plenties and<br/>
other candies and they only got to eat them if they got the answer right. <br/>
I mean, I would just love to see how this teacher explained to a child that<br/>
was hypoglycemic or had diabetes that they couldn&#39;t participate in math. <br/>
I&#39;d also like to see just how many walls these kids bounced off of.  Wanna<br/>
bet she complained of discipline problems, like DUH!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Or maybe comic strips are a little closer to reality and we should all pay <br/>
attention more often...?  <br/>
<br/>
This begs the question:  Is a comic strip author/artist thinking outside the <br/>
box or inside the box?  Or do they get to draw the box to the size needed for <br/>
a correct fit?  (I must need sleep or something, since it really did BEG the <br/>
question in my twisted mind!)<br/>

My personal favorite from last year was the Staples commercial with the<br/>
neighborhood parents dancing in the street as the school bus pulled away,<br/>
with the kids staring out the back of the bus in disbelief. There are days<br/>
when that commercial really &quot;speaks&quot; to me. But so far, reality speaks<br/>
louder. The commercial WAS funny though!!</div>
