<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041653510">Alrighty.  This post has not been edited, nor are all the links or<br/>
references complete but since I am being accused (hmmmm, flamed, maybe would<br/>
be more accurate) of ignoring DEMANDS by the below poster, here is the<br/>
answer to the DEMANDS.  If anyone wants the complete answer with all the<br/>
references *complete,* then it will take a little longer to put together.  I<br/>
don&#39;t have all the congressional records sitting in front of me nor do I<br/>
have all the little &quot;pieces.&quot;  I was putting it together but I guess I will<br/>
flunk the test if I don&#39;t turn in my DEMANDED report promptly.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda, who, believe it or not is smiling while she sends this as she really<br/>
doesn&#39;t treat this stuff as a matter of life and death.  ~~sigh~~  guess<br/>
some folks do.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  I sign quite a few posts with the initials CAM which means Clear As<br/>
Mud because sometimes it is hard to convey what one is trying to say when<br/>
one can&#39;t use body language or stop and edit verbally as one talks nor can<br/>
the person you are talking to stop you and ask for explanations as you talk.<br/>
MOST folks understand that and then ask one to further explain instead of<br/>
jumping in and attacking.<br/>
<br/>
That said, here is the reply to the post that Sandra is flaming about in<br/>
another post:<br/>
<br/>
O.K., this little game of creative editing and sniping really needs to stop.<br/>
Why, I just might have to stop giggling and LAYNWY!<br/>

&gt; I didn&#39;t think it was an American Indian quote.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***Duh!  It doesn&#39;t say it is an American Indian quote.  I said it is the<br/>
basis or, if one prefers, the philosophy of the American Indian as regarded<br/>
learning prior to the murderous white thieves coming to this continent.<br/>
They believed that a child learned from the whole tribe and family, that<br/>
they learned by doing, that they learned by listening to the elders.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;This was used to remove all Indian children from<br/>
&gt; their homes and ship them off to boarding schools where the worst of the<br/>
&gt; worse parts of the Prussian model were practiced. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is not so.  &quot;It takes a village&quot; was not ANY justification for taking<br/>
&gt; kids to boarding schools.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***Creative editing again! ~~sigh~~ It IS getting soooo boring!  (Using my<br/>
best imitation of a valley girl &lt;g&gt;)  I said the laws that were passed that<br/>
declared the American Indian not to be human was why they were sent to<br/>
boarding schools.  Ya know, &quot;barbarians,&quot; and &quot;animals&quot; were two of their<br/>
favorite adjectives.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In the difference of language to-day lies two-thirds of our trouble. . . .<br/>
Schools should be established, which children should be required to attend;<br/>
their barbarous dialect should be blotted out and the English language<br/>
substituted. (Report of the Indian Peace Commissioners, 1868, pp. 16-17)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;how easy it would be to assimilate Indians into the general population by<br/>
giving them a white man&#39;s education for a few years in a boarding school<br/>
(Hoxie, 1984).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;if there were a sufficient number of reservation boarding-school-buildings<br/>
to accommodate all the Indian children of school age, and these building<br/>
could be filled and kept filled with Indian pupils, the Indian problem would<br/>
be solved within the school age of the Indian child now six years old.<br/>
(Oberly, 1885, cxiii)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;English language only must be taught the Indian youth placed there for<br/>
educational and industrial training at the expense of the Government. If<br/>
Dakota or any other language is taught such children, they will be taken<br/>
away. (Atkins, 1887, p. xxi)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Every nation is jealous of its own language, and no nation ought to be more<br/>
so than ours, which approaches nearer than any other nationality to the<br/>
perfect protection of its people. True Americans all feel that the<br/>
Constitution, laws, and institutions of the United States, in their<br/>
adaptation to the wants and requirements of man, are superior to those of<br/>
any other country; and they should understand that by the spread of the<br/>
English language will these laws and institutions be more firmly established<br/>
a nd widely disseminated. Nothing so surely and perfectly stamps upon an<br/>
individual a national characteristic as language. . . . [As the Indians] are<br/>
in an English-speaking country, they must be taught the language which they<br/>
must use in transacting business with the people of this country. Atkins,<br/>
1887, pp. xxi-xxiii)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All instruction shall be in the English language. Pupils shall be required<br/>
to converse with employees and each other in English. All school employees<br/>
must be able to speak English fluently. (Rules for Indian Schools, 1898, p.<br/>
25)&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;They were all given<br/>
&gt; Buster Brown haircuts (boys and girls) and dressed in white uniforms. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps in one school you know of.  To make a claim like all Indian<br/>
 </span></blockquote>boarding schools wore white uniforms is simply to supply misinformation.<br/>
And to<br/>
claim that they cut the hair of all the girls is false.  Boys, most likely.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I live where there were still Indian schools very lately (still might be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>St.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Katherines&#39; in Santa Fe, but if so, haircutting even for boys is long,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>long gone), and what you&#39;ve written is not applicable.<br/>
<br/>
***One of the most racist states in the union!  And, yes it was applicable<br/>
to your state!  The children were removed from the reservation or sent to<br/>
missionary schools on the reservation.  They were forced to learn English<br/>
and were punished for not doing so.  Physically punished!  You do realise<br/>
that NM is part of Four Corners, don&#39;t you or will you claim that the<br/>
following<br/>
quote can&#39;t possibly apply to NM.  I mean, one of the worst was in your<br/>
hometown.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kluckhohn and Leighton reported that 95% of Navajo children &quot;went home<br/>
rather than to white communities, after leaving school, only to find<br/>
themselves handicapped for taking part in Navajo life because they did not<br/>
know the techniques and customs of their own people&quot; (1962, p. 141).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In an introductory heading to a 1923 Current History article on &quot;America&#39;s<br/>
Treatment of Her Indians,&quot; Collier (1923) declared that &quot;the administration<br/>
of Indian affairs [is] a national disgrace -- A policy designed to rob<br/>
Indians of their property, destroy their culture and eventually exterminate<br/>
them&quot; (p. 771, emphasis in original).&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; They were denied their language and religion and punished for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>practicing<br/>
either.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; That is true, but that&#39;s was also true in public schools of children<br/>
 </span></blockquote>speaking LOTS of languages even until lately, and probably even today in<br/>
some<br/>
places.<br/>
<br/>
***Get a grip.  Failing grades do not even vaguely compare to being<br/>
physically punished, denied parental visits, being denied meals or any of<br/>
the various other punishments inflicted on these children!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Those children that were not shipped off to boarding schools were forced<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to attend church run schools on the reservations.  Same haircuts and<br/>
uniforms<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; were required.  The treatment was brutal because it was &quot;o.k.&quot; to beat and<br/>
&gt; torture Indian children because they weren&#39;t &quot;human.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Where are you getting this information?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***Congress, first person reports, first hand information, relatives,<br/>
working for Title III, Title V, Title IX and JOM!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Regardless of the school system they are in, Navajo students find<br/>
themselves in an environment controlled and dominated by non-Indians. Most<br/>
of the teachers and administrators in reservation schools are Anglo [white].<br/>
Public school boards of education are dominated by non-Indians and those few<br/>
Indians who do serve wield little authority. Parent advisory boards are the<br/>
BIA school equivalent of a board of education; while these are all Indian,<br/>
their function is only advisory and they are essentially powerless.<br/>
<br/>
Navajos, in fact, have been excluded from the decision-making process in<br/>
these school systems. The result has been a variety of education policies<br/>
unrelated to the Navajo community. The Navajo language and culture have been<br/>
largely ignored in the curriculum offered to Navajo students. (United<br/>
States, 1975, pp. 126-127)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Enforcement of the English-only regulations was usually strict. Lawrence<br/>
Horn, a Blackfeet, who attended the government school at Heart Butte,<br/>
recalled students getting a stroke of a leather strap with holes in it every<br/>
time they spoke Indian (Parsons, 1980). &quot;<br/>

the general acceptance of Prussian type education.  However, I have given<br/>
you a long list of references and have included, in this post, many, many<br/>
quotes and sources.  Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m not questioning the evils of Indian schools.  I&#39;m questioning your<br/>
&gt; assertion of details as thought there was one overall model of boarding<br/>
&gt; school, or one overall group of Indians.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***Yes indeedy,  you are AGAIN questioning me or any assertion that I may<br/>
make.  Everyone on the list has noticed it, btw.<br/>
<br/>
Further, there was one over all model and it was the Carlisle school and<br/>
government regulation.  Again you speak as an authority about something you<br/>
know absolutely nothing about!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The model for what became an entire system was the Carlisle Indian School,<br/>
established in Pennsylvania in 1875 by Captain Richard Henry Pratt, a man<br/>
whose main qualification for the task seems to have been that he&#39;d earlier<br/>
served as warden of a military prison at Fort Marion, Florida. Following<br/>
Pratt&#39;s stated objective of &quot;killing the Indian&quot; in each student, Carlisle<br/>
and other such facilities-Chilocco, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Haskell,<br/>
Riverside; by 1902, there were two-dozen of thern-systematically<br/>
&quot;deculturated&quot; their pupils. Children brought to the schools as young as age<br/>
six were denied most or all direct contact with their families and societies<br/>
for years on end. They were shorn of their hair and required to dress in the<br/>
manner of Euro-America, forbidden to speak their languages or practice their<br/>
religions, prevented from learning their own histories or being in any other<br/>
way socialized among their own people.<br/>
<br/>
Individual native families and, often, whole societies resisted the process.<br/>
In 1891, and again in 1893, Congress authorized the use of police, troops<br/>
and other forcible means to compel the transfer of children from reservation<br/>
to boarding school, and to keep them there once they&#39;d arrived. Hence,<br/>
despite the best efforts of their elders, and not infrequently of the<br/>
students themselves, a total of 21,568 indigenous children--about a third of<br/>
the targeted age group-were confined in the schools in 1900. As of the late<br/>
1920s, the system had been diversified and expanded to the point that<br/>
upwards of eighty percent of each successive generation of native youth was<br/>
being comprehensively &quot;acculturated&quot; in a more-or-less uniform fashion.&quot;<br/>

Punishment:<br/>
<br/>
Two of our girls ran away...but they got caught. They tied their legs up,<br/>
tied their hands behind their backs, put them in the middle of the hallway<br/>
so that if they fell, fell asleep or something, the matron would hear them<br/>
and she&#39;d get out there and whip them and make them stand up again. (Helma<br/>
Ward, Makah, interview with Carolyn Marr)<br/>

&quot;The placement of North American Indian youngsters in residential boarding<br/>
schools - and the abusive treatment they received there - is a part of our<br/>
history that is seldom talked about.&quot;<br/>

&quot;Its effects, they say, were more devastating than the sexual assaults and<br/>
beatings that occurred in at least some of the 125 Indian Residential<br/>
Schools from the mid-19th century until the 1970s.&quot;<br/>

Through the Eyes of a Basketweaver<br/>

Documentary. While she weaves her baskets according to traditional<br/>
techniques of the Hupa, Yurok and Karuk nations, Vivien Hailstone re-weaves<br/>
the historical and cultural background of these Northern California peoples.<br/>
She tells of the near disappearance of this art when, as a young girl in a<br/>
boarding school, she was forbidden to express her heritage, either through<br/>
her language or the practice of a craft passed on by her grandmother.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Also, beginning in the 1880s, boarding schools were established, resulting<br/>
in the forced separation of children from their families.  Language Loss and<br/>
Revitalization in California , By Leanne Hinton, Department of Linguistics,<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Boarding Schools or Concentration Camps? The end of the Gold Rush era<br/>
signaled a change in U.S. policy towards Native people. Instead of directly<br/>
killing California indigenous people, reservations were created and<br/>
indigenous people were re-located to them. The children were taken, often by<br/>
force, away from their parents and to far-away re-education centers.<br/>
Children as young as four attended these re-education centers. They were<br/>
forced to cut their hair and give up their clothing upon arrival.<br/>
<br/>
Children could not have visitors, including their parents, while they stayed<br/>
at the centers. Some children stayed for years at a time. Indian children<br/>
were often farmed out as free labor to white settlers in boarding school<br/>
communities, and sometimes sold outright at auctions held by boarding school<br/>
teachers.&quot;  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.originalvoices.org/USGovtRolesSix.htm">http://www.originalvoices.org/USGovtRolesSix.htm</a><br/>

&quot;You know how I was raised? In a boarding school, being slapped across the<br/>
face, beaten for being an Indian, feeling ashamed of the color of my skin.&quot;<br/>
Sweet Tears and Bitter Pills, Mariana Kawall Leal Ferreira.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The model for what became an entire system was the Carlisle Indian School,<br/>
established in Pennsylvania in 1875 by Captain Richard Henry Pratt, a man<br/>
whose main qualification for the task seems to have been that he&#39;d earlier<br/>
served as warden of a military prison at Fort Marion, Florida. Following<br/>
Pratt&#39;s stated objective of &quot;killing the Indian&quot; in each student, Carlisle<br/>
and other such facilities-Chilocco, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Haskell,<br/>
Riverside; by 1902, there were two-dozen of thern-systematically<br/>
&quot;deculturated&quot; their pupils. Children brought to the schools as young as age<br/>
six were denied most or all direct contact with their families and societies<br/>
for years on end. They were shorn of their hair and required to dress in the<br/>
manner of Euro-America, forbidden to speak their languages or practice their<br/>
religions, prevented from learning their own histories or being in any other<br/>
way socialized among their own people.<br/>
<br/>
Individual native families and, often, whole societies resisted the process.<br/>
In 1891, and again in 1893, Congress authorized the use of police, troops<br/>
and other forcible means to compel the transfer of children from reservation<br/>
to boarding school, and to keep them there once they&#39;d arrived. Hence,<br/>
despite the best efforts of their elders, and not infrequently of the<br/>
students themselves, a total of 21,568 indigenous children--about a third of<br/>
the targeted age group-were confined in the schools in 1900. As of the late<br/>
1920s, the system had been diversified and expanded to the point that<br/>
upwards of eighty percent of each successive generation of native youth was<br/>
being comprehensively &quot;acculturated&quot; in a more-or-less uniform fashion.&quot;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.zmag.org/ZMag/articles/jan98ward.htm">http://www.zmag.org/ZMag/articles/jan98ward.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;According to many observers, the regimen of the schools usually included<br/>
getting Indians to dress, speak, and act like white people (see for example,<br/>
Whiteman, 1986).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At that time Indians were not U.S. citizens, and they lacked the right to<br/>
control their own lives and the education of their children (Eder & Reyhner,<br/>
1988; Whiteman, 1986).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
://www.zmag.org/ZMag/articles/jan98ward.htm<br/>
&quot;Indian Commissioner Thomas J. Morgan wrote in 1889 that &quot;the Indians must<br/>
conform &#39;to the white man&#39;s ways,&#39; peaceably if they will, forcibly if they<br/>
must.&quot; Many Indians began their education at this time in boarding schools,<br/>
often far from home, where they had their hair cut, where their native<br/>
clothes were replaced, and where they were often punished for speaking their<br/>
own languages (Whiteman, 1986).&quot;<br/>

<br/>
While some Indian resistance was crushed by dramatic massacres, for the most<br/>
part it was subdued by a combination of disease, alcohol, food rationing,<br/>
the cooperation of Indian collaborators, and the theft of children for<br/>
boarding schools - a situation not radically unlike today.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-15228466">Dear Lynda<br/>
<br/>
That was an impressive bibliography! please email me<br/>
off list and tell me how you did it.  I have a  few<br/>
clues, but my way of researching is so old fashioned,<br/>
I&#39;m a card catalogue vintage hunter!!<br/>
<br/>
And I am an Indian (yes, lots of us use that word)<br/>
with a roll number. Does that make me authentic? Ha! <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read all the 98 other posts in my inbox yet,<br/>
but I bet your is the only annotated OPINION! Most of<br/>
my opinions are entirely subjective.  I would have to<br/>
put myself at the bottom of the page. <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately I got to miss all of that horror. My own<br/>
experiences, there, are vicarious.  And you, Lynda,<br/>
what is your personal connection?  Besides proving<br/>
your validity.  If my question is not too intrusive,<br/>
you may answer me off list.....or on.  If I am too<br/>
personal in my query please forgive me.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Sharon    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-325381188">Dear Lynda<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid I skimmed most of your post, however that<br/>
bibliography is really impressive!  How did you do it<br/>
so fast?  I&#39;m such an old fashioned sort of<br/>
researcher.  More the card-catalogue vintage type of<br/>
hunter.  Would you please email me, off list, with how<br/>
to do a search like that?  That would be a VERY useful<br/>
thing to know how to do.<br/>
<br/>
My own opinions are entirely subjective, dunno how I<br/>
would footnote myself. Ha! And even though I, like so<br/>
many others, have a mixed ancestry, I am an Indian<br/>
with a roll number......does that make me authentic? <br/>
No, a number doesn&#39;t do anything but mark a spot. <br/>
<br/>
You made a reference, somewhere, to fake Indian sites.<br/>
Perhaps you should be careful what you search for.<br/>
Perhaps we each find what we are looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Wannabees are not the worst sort of person.  At<br/>
least they are trying! So many don&#39;t make an effort at<br/>
all. Collectors are a different sort, they aren&#39;t<br/>
really Wannabees, even.  More a Wasichu (spelling?)<br/>
type. Ya know.......  still even that is a<br/>
generalization.  Who knows, there might be an<br/>
enlightened artifact collector somewhere. Ha!<br/>
<br/>
And Lynda, if it isn&#39;t too personal, what is your<br/>
Indian connection? If you want to answer you can email<br/>
me off list, or on. But is is off topic.  If my<br/>
questions are too intrusive, please forgive me.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for pointing out things from an outlook that is<br/>
different from most.  Like a hawk, you see acutely,<br/>
but you vision is narrow. It is not the usual way to<br/>
view the world. It is good for me to be aware of the<br/>
view from where you are.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing your thoughts<br/>
