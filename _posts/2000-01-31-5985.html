<div id="ygrps-yiv-551067895">Has anyone read the book by the guy who is supposedly the human<br/>
calculator?  I&#39;m wondering if his ideas would work for young children?<br/>
I can&#39;t even remember his name.  I saw him on 20/20 a long time ago, and<br/>
he was quite amazing.  They showed him teaching kids his method, and it<br/>
was quite impressive.  Most of all the kids seemed like they were having<br/>
alot of fun.  That&#39;s always important to me.  Especially As I suspect I<br/>
had a learning disability in math that was never discovered.  I&#39;m still<br/>
really slow with anything numbers, but I usually eventually get it.  :)<br/>
