with young kids we dont have the strike option open to us, too bad!  i was <br/>
interested in your note about being melancholy-- knowing that about yourself <br/>
is probably helpful!  i tend to get irritable/down when things have gone <br/>
downhill for too many days.  yet, its hard to &quot;whip the troops into shape&quot; <br/>
when they are so young.  my older ones help lots too bc it is their job!  <br/>
(nine and seven) but in this stage of our lives it is just part of it!  (the <br/>
littles are 3 and 1) my kids loooove to play in a just-cleaned room!!  all <br/>
the new space to be creative in!!!  i am the same way, tho so they come by it <br/>
naturally-- eg. i most love to get creative or ambitious in the kitchen after <br/>
it has been cleaned spotless!  (either that or i want us all to go eat out so <br/>
that it stays clean for a minute, haha!!)<br/>

Me, too!  I&#39;d probably spend way, way more time cooking if I had a kitchen <br/>
that cleaned itself.<br/>
<br/>
Wonder if that incentive would inspire my husband?<br/>

&gt; I have never heard of this book but I must say, the temperament you just<br/>
&gt; described sounds pretty familiar. I grew up in a home where you couldn&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; the stove top for the months of dinner slopped on to it. I can not function<br/>
&gt; like that. The moment I got out on my own I developed a fixation with clean<br/>
&gt; counters and I have had to actually relax a bit on that one. I do keep them<br/>
&gt; wiped off though and my kitchen must be clean for me to function at my best.<br/>
&gt; I cook really horrid meals when I work in a messy kitchen. If it isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; ordered my thoughts aren&#39;t. Maybe I should look into that book &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am not even going to comment on the whole strike thing except to say, you<br/>
&gt; set the tone for your home life.<br/>

I know what you mean about the kitchen.  I refuse to cook in a messy kitchen.<br/>
I&#39;m almost allergic to it.  I feel confused and totally agitated.  I like<br/>
spotless counters and sinks.  But that is another trait of a melancholy person:<br/>
perfectionism. :-)  Thank God I am not a total perfectionist.  I, personally,<br/>
would probably scar my children for life!  (No offense if someone reading this<br/>
is!!!)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny but I am part melancholy and part sanguine, which is an unlikely<br/>
combo.  I am an outgoing, emotional perfectionist.  :-0  And my son is the same.<br/>
Only he is opposite!  He&#39;s a sanguine-melancholy.  With me the emotional,<br/>
introverted, perfectionist is stronger than the outgoing, happy-go-lucky,<br/>
draw-attention-to-herself, fun girl.  My son is just the opposite.   If you have<br/>
no idea what I am talking about, go get the book &#39;Spirit-Controlled Temperment&#39;<br/>
by Tim LaHaye.   It&#39;s a great book that explains it all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286659207">A Jewish friend of mine who has always celebrated Christmas said once that Christmas is not about religion but about the human spirit. <br/>
I would rather say, Christmas ought to be about human sprit.<br/>
