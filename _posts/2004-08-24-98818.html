&lt;&lt; When they were younger and just getting there, I bought them deoderant, and<br/>
put deoderant soup in their showers..... &gt;&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;My oldest is a pretty picky eater and I don&#39;t think deodorant soup would go<br/>
over well....Plus, wouldn&#39;t it be hard to eat in the shower? &lt;BWG&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Deoderant soup...<br/>
<br/>
But if there WERE a food that would keep teenaged boys smelling like manly <br/>
roses...  one thing teenaged boys WILL do is eat!!<br/>
<br/>
Mine will eat AND shower. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Not at the same time, though, you&#39;re right. <br/>
<br/>
Typos are fun and scary.   Once before I left for the weekend I sent a post <br/>
to a little homeschooling list I was that had eight or nine women and one man.  <br/>
I referred to him as &quot;our lone male member&quot; and left for three days.<br/>
<br/>
I got back to a REALLY full mailbox of monkey-hooting and one-liners, because <br/>
I had accidentally called him &quot;our long male member.&quot;<br/>
