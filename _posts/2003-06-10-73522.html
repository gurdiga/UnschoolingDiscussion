<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637846059">I&#39;ve had a frustrating experience the last couple of days with my <br/>
four year old, and I need to talk about it... I hope nobody minds.<br/>
My son wanted to sign up for a week of swim camp this week because <br/>
his friend was doing it (as well as several cousins), so we visited <br/>
and checked it out, and he wanted to give it a try.<br/>
This is a very popular local swim school that almost everyone&#39;s kids <br/>
go to at some point to learn how to swim (or learn how to hate it, <br/>
but that&#39;s a different topic).  My ten year old went when he was <br/>
younger and thoroughly enjoyed it, my eight year old tried it for <br/>
one day when he was four, hated it, and never went back.  My now <br/>
four year old (my youngest) actually already knows how to swim since <br/>
we have regular access to a pool, but he really wanted to try this <br/>
camp anyway, just for fun, and just for one week.  (Three hours of <br/>
alternating swimming &quot;lessons&quot; and play in a large, attractive, well-<br/>
stocked sandbox).  The first day he did fine, but the second day he <br/>
didn&#39;t want to go back.  Apparently he had an okay time but didn&#39;t <br/>
realize how much he&#39;d hate being left there &quot;alone&quot; (parents aren&#39;t <br/>
allowed to stay).  I tried to take him the second day to see if <br/>
they&#39;d let me hang around for at least a little while he acclimated, <br/>
but they wouldn&#39;t let me stay, and he attached himself to me like <br/>
glue, refusing to stay without me.<br/>
  <br/>
Meanwhile, there are some very young children (like just turned <br/>
three it looked like) *totally hysterical* because the camp <br/>
counsellors had peeled them off their moms while their moms jumped <br/>
in their cars ignoring their crying, so my son was told &quot;it wouldn&#39;t <br/>
be fair for your mom to stay because then all the other little boys <br/>
and girls will want *their* moms.&quot;  When I made it clear that I&#39;d <br/>
made a mistake and my son was leaving with me and wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
returning I was told what a &quot;shame&quot; it was that I wouldn&#39;t let him <br/>
adjust and &quot;have fun at camp.&quot;  They told me that I should at least <br/>
make him stay for three days before I &quot;give in.&quot;  I went through the <br/>
same shaming attempts from the director when I spoke to him about <br/>
getting a refund.<br/>
<br/>
I just feel really shitty... almost like I have an emotional hang-<br/>
over from all the toxic input.  My son was the only one out of a <br/>
very large group of kids who was actually listened to and taken <br/>
seriously, and I was criticized and shamed for it.  I&#39;m not feeling <br/>
very good about our society right now.<br/>
I also know that if I hadn&#39;t already had 10 years of attachment <br/>
parenting and 5 years of unschooling under my belt I probably would <br/>
have caved to the pressure.  I feel so bad for all those firstborn <br/>
three year olds whose mothers mean well but will be shamed out of <br/>
following their instincts at that camp this summer.<br/>
The other sad thing is that my son would have had a good experience <br/>
if only they let mothers stay as long as the children need them to.<br/>
Am I the only one who feels like I&#39;m from another planet sometimes?<br/>

<br/>
Not at all!  You are from the planet Mother.  Better than being from the <br/>
planet Robot! :)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve faced these type of situations a million times.  Ugh.  Honestly, he <br/>
very well may have enjoyed his time there...eventually.  But is that worth <br/>
three days of possible misery, heartbreak and fear?  I don&#39;t think so.  I <br/>
think you made the right decision.  I promise your son thinks so.  He needed <br/>
you to go against the grain and stand up for him.  He needs to know you will <br/>
be there, support him and love him enough to let him opt out whe the going <br/>
gets rough.  Good heavens, he&#39;s just a baby!  Well, 4 to me is still a baby. <br/>
&lt;bg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kudos!  I admire you for taking your son&#39;s side.  I see so many parents take <br/>
the &#39;popular&#39; side at the expense of their children.  Nice to see you aren&#39;t <br/>
one of those!<br/>

<br/>
They don&#39;t know how else to be.  Their livelihood depends on being the way <br/>
they&#39;re being.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t personal.  It was routine.  I know that makes it worse in a way, <br/>
but it wasn&#39;t about you as an individual.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I&#39;m not feeling very good about our society right now. &gt;&gt;<br/>

We&#39;re doing the best we can here to give people a hand up and out of that, <br/>

People tell me all the time that I need to &quot;let Tim go&quot; more, or he&#39;ll<br/>
always be attached to my apron strings.  Tim is six, and people constantly<br/>
think he&#39;s older.  Yes, he&#39;s tall, but he&#39;s also well spoken, reasonably<br/>
responsible and trustworthy for six, and quite independent when he feels<br/>
like being independent.<br/>

I fail to see the problem with my son, but I&#39;m becomming more articulate<br/>
about the problems in societal norms on child-rearing!<br/>

problem, you are *totally right* to want to be with your boy if he needs<br/>
you there. They are toxic, dont judge yourself in their stupid light!!!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (3 ½)  goes to dance class and for the first two months I<br/>
had to sit on the stairs where she could see me and come and get a kissy<br/>
and hug if she needed it. Now I have graduated to waiting in the living<br/>
room  her decision. This is a series breach of the lovely dance<br/>
teachers usual rules about having no waiting room and no observers<br/>
except for creeping in like a little mouse for a peek, but she makes<br/>
exceptions when the child *needs* it to be happy.<br/>

like I must somehow justify or defend myself to others - in the way I<br/>
parent and/or the way we are unschooling. . . <br/>
<br/>
I am the subject of talk in the community - especially now that my children<br/>
are all teens and are not following the &#39;accepted&#39; path. Imagine this,<br/>
though - I do have three teens who actually want to spend time with me. . .<br/>

looked askance at me when I was nursing three year olds.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel strong about it - other times it gets to me. . . depends<br/>
on what kind of day I&#39;ve been having, I guess. The oddest part is that I am<br/>
now also defending myself to an ex-husband, who used to the the staunchest<br/>
supporter of this &#39;style&#39; when they were all little, but who now thinks all<br/>
three kids are headed nowhere.<br/>

No you are not alone. I would have felt terrible for all those other little<br/>
kids. I&#39;m glad you were there for your son and he knows that no matter what<br/>
others say, you are behind him 100%. It&#39;s a shame that maybe he missed out<br/>
on something he might have enjoyed just because they wouldn&#39;t let you there.<br/>
You did what was right for your son and you shouldn&#39;t feel bad about that.<br/>
Maybe you feel bad about not saying enough to the director or whatever? I<br/>
sometimes regret not saying anything and at my age, I still do that. I<br/>
understand completely.<br/>

We had been discussing something else and how it was nobody else&#39;s business what this poor girl decided to do in her personal life.  I had mentioned that I get it too because I&#39;m countercultural.<br/>
<br/>
A third nurse just laughed in a friendly way, and said she heard my kids are up till 3am and couldn&#39;t for the life of her figure out why.<br/>
<br/>
When I explained it, she laughed again (good naturedly) and just said, &quot;well we&#39;ve all just decided you march to a different drummer&quot; and she added that I remind her of the &quot;flower children&quot; LOLOLOL.<br/>

I always stayed with Dylan.  I stayed for half  hour piano classes and I<br/>
stayed for swimming classes and I even got into the pool the first few<br/>
times until he was ok with just the instructor.  I would just say, very<br/>
seriously  &quot;I&#39;m staying&quot; and maybe they were all afraid of the crazy<br/>
woman because I didn&#39;t have any trouble.<br/>
I stay at martial arts classes too and it&#39;s only been this year that<br/>
Dylan said it&#39;d be ok with him if I didn&#39;t want to stay.  He&#39;s eleven.  <br/>

Is parenting for us or for our children?   If it&#39;s for our children then<br/>
it seems we should parent they way they need us to.   If a kid can&#39;t rely<br/>

whole time I am watching the clock or waiting for my church beeper to <br/>
buzz? They act like I am taking away an opportunity from them. No <br/>
thanks. I treat church just like unschooling, it&#39;s their choice. I <br/>
signed up my 3yo for a wednesday night AWANA club last fall. She went <br/>
twice and hated it. I did not make her continue, even though I <br/>
invested in the vest and bag and book, and even though it would mean <br/>
I couldn&#39;t go to my own weds. night activity. She wanted to try again <br/>
later in the year, and she hated it again. When I picked her up, the <br/>
leader kept saying things to me about how she didn&#39;t do well. I <br/>
finally turned to him and shut him up. <br/>
<br/>
My oldest megan was never like that. We did dance school and <br/>
preschool as soon as she was old enough, she never cried because I <br/>
was leaving, she always hated to go home with me. <br/>
<br/>
Of course I get accused of &quot;creating this monster&quot; (actual words <br/>
used) because I had a very clingy baby the second time and we <br/>
attachment parented with her for the first time. <br/>
<br/>
I know better now, because my third is a combo of the first two. He <br/>
benefitted from attachment parenting, but is much bolder after he <br/>
gets used to a situation. He didn&#39;t need to be in the sling ALL THE <br/>
TIME like my second, colicky daughter. But he still likes me to be <br/>
near and doesn&#39;t like me leaving him with strangers. <br/>

It&#39;s always the same thing, kids can&#39;t possibly be sincere or be taken<br/>
seriously when they express fear at being separated.<br/>
<br/>
This has been one of the best by-products of unschooling, I&#39;m MUCH better at<br/>
detecting bullsh*t when it&#39;s being spread.<br/>
<br/>

Lanora hated AWANA too, people looked at me like I had allowed her to play<br/>
with matches when I said she didn&#39;t like it so we weren&#39;t going anymore.<br/>

Well, it hasn&#39;t been that long since homosexuality and autism were blamed on<br/>
&quot;overprotective&quot; mothers.  Tis my happy mantra, &quot;Bullsh*t, bullsh*t,<br/>
bullsh*t&quot;.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Is parenting for us or for our children?   If it&#39;s for our children then<br/>
it seems we should parent they way they need us to.   If a kid can&#39;t rely<br/>
on a parent who are they supposed to rely on? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Excellently put.<br/>
<br/>
Memorial Day weekend, my kids all stayed at a big medieval campout from <br/>
Thursday to Monday.  I was up most days for an hour or so and didn&#39;t always see <br/>
them all.  Their dad was there, but he didn&#39;t always see them all either! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Saturday and Sunday a longtime friend who has one child, older than ours, who <br/>
led the most structured life I&#39;ve ever personally observed (in AND out of <br/>
school) was there and cooked.  (Other days were mostly food I had pre-prepared <br/>
and sent up in coolers, and snacky stuff.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the feedback she sent me on my kids who are 16, 14, and 11 and are the <br/>
least structured kids she has ever personally observed.  The first &quot;kids&quot; <br/>
includes three or more additional kids.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Please thank all the kids for their helpfulness around camp.  They were all <br/>
great, and I really enjoyed camping with them. Kirby and Marty, especially, <br/>
were always taking care of camp chores, usually without being asked.  They are <br/>
really great kids.  Holly, too, of course, she seemed to be having lots of fun, <br/>
and was very self-sufficient.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Each kid had his or her own tent.  Kirby ended up sharing his with his 18 <br/>
year old cousin Gina and her best friend (female), so having two girls like that <br/>
in his tent kept him from having any other kinds of girls in there.  That was <br/>
okay. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But the kids aren&#39;t clingy or scared, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yes they are.  Marty and I are sharing a banjo lesson tonight, or rather I <br/>
will have a banjo lesson while Marty watches, because he was too afraid of going <br/>
to a banjo lesson.<br/>
<br/>
Marty did the Junior Police Academy, but I had to go with him and hand over <br/>
the application at first, and sit with him at the orientation and walk him in <br/>
(first day only, then he wanted to do it on his own).<br/>
<br/>
When he was comfortable, I stepped back.<br/>
<br/>
I would rather be able to say that than &quot;I stepped back, he was scared and <br/>
cried a while, but eventually he got comfortable.&quot;   That comes at the cost of <br/>
trust and love, straight out, and I want to maintain as much trust and love as <br/>
I can.<br/>

This is it exactly. And I have learned from Jayn, that she *will* say<br/>
&quot;OK you can go now&quot; when she is ready. I can trust her to free me to go<br/>
to the other room or visit with the other mothers or whatever. I do not<br/>
have to fear that I would be tied to her forever if I stay until she is<br/>
comfortable - although that would be ok too!<br/>
