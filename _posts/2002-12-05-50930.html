<div id="ygrps-yiv-724535612">I am just wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to help ds (5 yrs) to learn more about war in general without it being to graphic. He seems intriqued about other countries and why he saw a picture of a child learning to use a rocket launcher! We have a book that tells alittle about each period in History, but I am looking for more. Any ideas greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Amie<br/>
