<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661618530">My 13 year old is interested in the case for/against evolution. He has <br/>
found Christian sites that say that human footprints were found in the <br/>
same layer of rock as dinosaur footprints at Paluxy River in Texas. He <br/>
can find no reference to this in scientific journals , or news <br/>
articles or anything. He is suspecting that the claim is false because <br/>
of it.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone come across this? I&#39;ve looked in my library databases, and <br/>
all I can find is one news article from the New York Times but it <br/>
doesn&#39;t give me the full text, only the citation. The headline seemed <br/>
to the impression that it wasn&#39;t truly human footprints. <br/>

Can anyone point us in the right direction on where to find this info?<br/>
Preferably a scientific source, rather than Christian based. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-494189348">Erin, it just so happens that I am in the middle of reading a book  <br/>
called &quot;Tower of Babel: The Evidence Against the New Creationism&quot; by  <br/>
Robert Pennock. And it has a whole long section on the Paluxy  <br/>
&quot;footprints.&quot; He cites many articles, but one sounds relevant if it  <br/>
could be found: &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Paluxy Man-tracks&quot; in  <br/>
_Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith_ Vol 40 #3 1998 p. 151.  <br/>
This is a Christian-based source that apparently argues that  <br/>
creationists need to stop using these footprints as &quot;evidence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The National Center for Science Education (http:// <br/>
www.natcenscied.org/) has a good summary of the situation here:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/oo947">http://tinyurl.com/oo947</a> Scroll down to the heading, &quot;Creationist  <br/>
Fraud?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another article at the same website, called &quot;Man-tracks? The  <br/>
Fossils say No.&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/rp3wd">http://tinyurl.com/rp3wd</a><br/>
<br/>
Chapter 5 of Tower of Babel goes into great detail about the Paluxy  <br/>
man-prints, including a lot of detail about the science of how they  <br/>
know they&#39;re dinosaur tracks (or in some cases, &quot;prints&quot; that were  <br/>
carved by people). The whole book is a detailed examination of  <br/>
creationists&#39; various arguments; it&#39;s a bit dry in places (and I  <br/>
admit to skimming after awhile) but I&#39;ve learned a lot from it. It  <br/>
might not be beyond a motivated and smart 13-year-old; the language  <br/>
is formal but not jargony. Pennock is a philosopher of science who  <br/>
recently testified in the Kitzmiller v. Dover case. (He&#39;s also a  <br/>
member of my Quaker meeting, and his wife just had a baby last  <br/>
week...but that&#39;s beside the point.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-24633805">There was something on either the discovery channel or the history channel maybe a year or so ago about the foot prints. I&#39;m not sure about the date but I recall something about it. They were found by a river and were thought to be very old.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075120043">For more info about the Paluxy footprints, go to www.talkorigins.org and go to the index.  The link to the Paluxy info is under &quot;footprints,&quot;  and it will take you to a collection of articles.   This site is pretty excellent in general for a good scientific overview of evolution, and specifically addresses the common questions/concerns/ misconceptions about evolution through natural selection.  <br/>
  Have fun<br/>
