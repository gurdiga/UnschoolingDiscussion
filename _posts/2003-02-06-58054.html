I have kept a journal for years. It&#39;s wonderful.<br/>
My son keeps a journal.<br/>
Brianna keeps a journal.<br/>
<br/>
I am very thankful for my journal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WORTH REMEMBERING: &quot;People can keep a journal to record their life, their<br/>
thoughts, their happiness, the events of their families, etc. They can also<br/>
keep a journal of creative observations, their hopes, their ideas and<br/>
dreams, as Leonardo da Vinci did. He always had a notebook hanging from his<br/>
belt to record his observations. I have one constantly in my pocket and on<br/>
my night table. We must be the source of good ideas and dreams for a better<br/>
world. We are part of evolution.&quot; -- ROBERT MULLER<br/>
