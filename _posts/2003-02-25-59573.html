<div id="ygrps-yiv-729986704">We had the same experience with ds, now 12, when he was 7 and 8 in plays.  I<br/>
would read the part to him and he would memorize all of his lines.  At about<br/>
8 1/2 he started reading some, by 9 1/2  he read The Hobbit (with good<br/>
comprehension, according to dh, because ds talked about it every day with<br/>
him).  Next ds, now almost 11, started reading at about 8 1/2, then last<br/>
year read a lot of Boxcar Children and has gotten through the 4 Harry Potter<br/>
books<br/>
since last summer.  Youngest ds, almost 9, still reads only a few words and<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem too concerned, except when in a forced reading situation.  He<br/>
quit cub scouts last month because the new den leader never lets them play<br/>
running around games, on the playground or in the gym, but gives them word<br/>
games like hangman.  Ds 8 said it&#39;s Boring!  He was in two plays recently,<br/>
in Dec. and in Jan., and had memorized his parts in about 3 days (Ollie in<br/>
Best Xmas Pageant and 3 small roles in Wind in the Willows).  He didn&#39;t<br/>
write down his blocking, but he never forgot a direction.  Ds 12 is this way<br/>
too, even tho he reads fine now.  I think maybe because they relied on<br/>
listening and following directions they have stronger skills in that area.<br/>
Plus I think they&#39;re just blessed with good memories.  That helps!<br/>
