<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156619313">Thanks to everybody with their advice.  Mook&#39;s eye infection seemed<br/>
to <br/>
go away by itself.  The eyedrops didn&#39;t make it into his eyes, and we <br/>
just gave up.  Figured if it got worse, we&#39;d take him back.  But it <br/>
just cleared up on its own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-340992749">I&#39;d like to heartily thank Cindy F and Betsy H for recommending the <br/>
Miles Vorkosigan Adventures by Lois Bujold.  I devoured them up and <br/>
now that I&#39;ve run out of them, I miss Miles terribly!  Good Stuff!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848697645">Just wanted to thank everyone who has responded to me in any way or has <br/>
ignited my brain and forced it to go where it has never gone before. So that <br/>
pretty much encompasses everyone on the list. Thanks for all comments <br/>
whether I liked them or not. They all helped in some way to encourage my <br/>
thinking even further or reinforce what I feel already. Sorry if I got a <br/>
little hot headed with anyone, I&#39;ve been dealing on no more than 4 hours of <br/>
sleep a night and I will use that as an excuse. There were times when my <br/>
husband wondered why I bothered posting or was as nice as I was with my <br/>
words at times. I knew it was for a good reason.<br/>
Been on lists before and I know if you can weather the storm, sunny days are <br/>
ahead. So thanks everyone for my sunny days!<br/>
