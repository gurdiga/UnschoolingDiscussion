&lt;&lt;&lt; A quick intro: I&#39;m Carol from New Zealand, and am in the middle of<br/>
 moving house after 21 years. There&#39;s only 3 chairs left in this house -<br/>
 dh has one, the cat (very stressed) has the second, so I just have to<br/>
 sit on the computer  We are<br/>
 planning to buy a little land in the country and build, but in the<br/>
 meantime are renting a house 1/2 an hour from town to see how we like<br/>
 it!I have always liked the ideas of unschooling, but am not always as<br/>
 trusting as I could be - kids with some learning difficulties in &#39;basic&#39;<br/>
 areas such as reading and writing test one&#39;s philosophical outlook<br/>
 somewhat. Still, I think I&#39;m far too lazy to spend too much time being<br/>
 structured and organised and trying to manipulate unwilling people so we<br/>
 do tend to be pretty much unschoolers, in spite of my internal battles!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     Hi!  I am new to this loop and was so struck by the similarities, that I <br/>
decided to go on and introduce myself.  I am also in the middle of a move, <br/>
well at the tail end actually.  However, it hasn&#39;t been very long since my <br/>
house was bare of furniture and with a very confused cat and dog!  We also <br/>
moved to the country, although we didn&#39;t build a house.<br/>
However, in between our move from one home to the other, we rented a very <br/>
small 2 bedroom cabin with no phone or computer.  That was really fun!  It <br/>
was like being on vacation, as there were no other people renting at the <br/>
time, and we were right on a lake.  It was like expenencing the country <br/>
before we got our home and we loved it!<br/>
     Anyway, my name if Tami and I am from Indiana.  I am married to David <br/>
and we are unschooling our four kids: 17 yob, 13 yob, 10 yob, and a 7 yog.  <br/>
We have homeschooled for 3 1/2 years.  We tend to unschool with periods of <br/>
guilt ridden  &quot;let&#39;s hit the books&quot;, until we go crazy with boredom and go <br/>
back to unschooling.<br/>
     I tend to be very unsctructured so unschooling is right up my alley.  <br/>
However, my parents both just retired from the public school system and they <br/>
are very into the public school way of doing school----that is where my guilt <br/>
comes from.<br/>
     I am looking forward to reading what other unschoolers go through.  This <br/>
will be fun reading about others that unschool as the area I live in are very <br/>
&quot;school-at-home&quot; homeschoolers.  Glad to meet everyone!</div>

     I live in a little hic town called Boonville!  No, really it is small, <br/>
but I think it is cute and quaint.  My mailing address is Boonville, but I <br/>
actually live in the country between Boonville and Newburgh.  I live about 25 <br/>
minutes away from Evansville.  I have been to Terre Haute a few times, but I <br/>
have never been to Muncie.  What in the world are you doing in New Hampshire?<br/>
