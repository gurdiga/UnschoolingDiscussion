<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433270619">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
In response to Helen, I think that unschooling would work especially well<br/>
for you. Your children will have the opportunity to see first hand what you<br/>
do, and they may begin to have their own work that they want to do.  I work<br/>
many hours throughout the day at home, and even though I don&#39;t get any cash<br/>
rewards, I have goals and work that I want to accomplish. I like that my<br/>
children, 5 and 8 create their own goals and work. I try to stay current on<br/>
their latest interests and keep pertinent things around. I have to watch<br/>
scheduling things with them, because they are so busy at home. My first year<br/>
of homeschooling, I felt the need to make sure they were being social and<br/>
had things to do, and I enrolled them in too many things. What I found was<br/>
they  were more interested in staying home developing their own learning<br/>
strategies. We don&#39;t have a set schedule, but one of my children is a night<br/>
owl, so I spend an hour or so with her usually at night reading, listening,<br/>
singing whatever, and the same thing happens with my other daughter in the<br/>
morning while the night owl sleeps. Sometimes we are all on the same<br/>
schedule and that works out too. Just about every activity throughout the<br/>
day can be considered &quot;school&quot; time, because the learning never ceases. They<br/>
learn without my interference and despite my interfere. I treasure and guard<br/>
the days we can stay home, because we all piddle around doing our own thing,<br/>
but we are also together, and these are the days we all seem to be the most<br/>
contented. Also, we usually end up doing something&#39;s in common, eating,<br/>
singing, dancing, writing, drawing, cooking, brick laying, whatever.<br/>
Finally,to answer your question &quot;Do I need to plan some specific time to be<br/>
available or is it just all day long as needed?&quot;<br/>
You will have to try things to see what works best for your situation. You<br/>
may find, like me that you do both, because we do like to join others to go<br/>
on field trips, share projects, play games, a class here and there, so this<br/>
is time that has to be more scheduled.<br/>

  I&#39;m still weighing whether unschooling will work for me because I work<br/>
full-time from home for an internet research publisher. I have a couple<br/>
questions - hope this is the right forum:<br/>
<br/>
--How much time does the parent spend getting the kids set up each day if<br/>
any? Mine are 6 and 7 and so would be first & third grade in the fall. Do I<br/>
need to plan some specific time to be available or is it just all day long<br/>
as needed?</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yes.  And I think you have to realize that you will change your methods over <br/>
time and as new interests and needs arise.  Trying to fit the kids and <br/>
yourself into some pre-designed system isn&#39;t any good.  Set up something (and <br/>
change it!) that works for you and yours.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
