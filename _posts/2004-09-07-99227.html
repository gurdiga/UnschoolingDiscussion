<div id="ygrps-yiv-624896805">I haven&#39;t responded to any of the posts about cleaning and clutter and all<br/>
that....but I have been reading and enjoying and thinking.<br/>
So here are some of my thoughts I&#39;ll share....<br/>
I&#39;m not a great housekeeper...never have been. And I was raised doing all<br/>
kinds of chores...I was raised by a single mom so my sister and I were<br/>
expected to help out, I learned to cook and clean...I love to cook, I hate<br/>
to clean.  After we had kids, I tried things like assigned chores and chore<br/>
charts and schedules....and it never worked because I could never follow<br/>
them. I couldn&#39;t justify asking my kids to do what I couldn&#39;t do. So we have<br/>
evolved into helping out as needed. When my kids were little, the oldest was<br/>
always messy and cluttered, the younger girl was neat and organized...by<br/>
nature, not my doing!....Now as 18 and 15 year olds...there rooms are mostly<br/>
spotless, organized and they do their own laundry.  I never &#39;made&#39; them<br/>
clean their rooms, I only helped when they asked, they haven&#39;t had<br/>
consistent structure with chores and certainly not a very good example, and<br/>
yet their rooms look just the way they want them (and usually cleaner than<br/>
my room!).  My boys share a room and it&#39;s less neat than the girls, but is<br/>
the way they like it for now. They clean it when they feel it needs it.  My<br/>
15 year old hates a messy kitchen, so she is often the one that cleans it. I<br/>
try to keep it under control out of respect for her needs....but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
take much for it to get out of hand....my oldest usually keeps the bathroom<br/>
clean, the boys help out as asked, they rarely mind and they can almost<br/>
always say no.....my house isn&#39;t spotless and I have been blessed (or<br/>
cursed, depending on who you ask) with the ability to not see a lot of<br/>
clutter and mess most of the time.  My poor dh was raised by a neat-nic,<br/>
white couch, no toys in the living room kind of mom....he&#39;s adjusted pretty<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
But here are some of my thoughts on all this...I lost a parent and<br/>
grandparent to cancer as a young child. I have lived with knowing how short<br/>
life is....and how sudden things can change....I had other losses I won&#39;t go<br/>
into here....but I decided a long time ago that life is short and who cares<br/>
what my house is like now.....when the kids were little, we had toys in the<br/>
living room. A lot of toys, most of their toys, because I wanted to be with<br/>
my kids, not send them to their rooms to play. A very strange concept to my<br/>
dh. He liked the idea...mostly....but would sometimes complain after<br/>
tripping over something or seeing yet again, piles of legos and blocks....I<br/>
assured him that one day, the kids would be older and we wouldn&#39;t have toys<br/>
in the living room....and you know what? That day is here. Not a single toy<br/>
is in our living room.  Now we have kids here all the time...and they will<br/>
always be welcome because this time will pass as well. We drive the kids and<br/>
their friends a lot.....and sometimes it&#39;s a pain and inconvenient, but this<br/>
time will pass. My husband is an artist in his spare time and uses found<br/>
objects for his art...he is always bringing home &#39;treasures&#39; and they often<br/>
sit in the living room until there is time to put them in his studio....and<br/>
I rarely complain, because...someday he could be gone....stuff is so trivial<br/>
compared to that.  I guess perspective and priorities.....mine are usually<br/>
different than most of the worlds....and I used to think I was the one that<br/>
was wrong.  And none of this means that there aren&#39;t days when I wish the<br/>
house was clean, really clean or that we had nicer things (less kid<br/>
friendly) or whatever. But when the kids were little, I used to have days<br/>
where I wished for a bit more personal space, or a full night&#39;s sleep or<br/>
whatever and the day has come, as I knew it would.   <br/>
<br/>
On the lighter side, my husband does occasionally comment that the day will<br/>
come when we are empty nesters (which we are not in a hurry for, but it will<br/>
come) and then the house will be clean and picked up on a consistent<br/>
basis....Poor man is in for such a shock...I just don&#39;t think I have that in<br/>
me....kids or no kids! ;)<br/>

LOL!  But even if you do it once in a while, it&#39;ll stay that way longer.   I<br/>
enjoyed reading what you wrote.  Lots of good points were made.<br/>

That is so sweet and true.<br/>

Keith snored loudly for a few years, and lately he has stopped.  Sometimes it <br/>
scares me if I wake up and realize I haven&#39;t heard him, and I listen very <br/>
closely for the breathing.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s getting older and doesn&#39;t come home as soon as he used to when he <br/>
goes somewhere.  I could be grumpy about that, but I always know where he is (or <br/>
know who will know), and he always DOES come home.  So I&#39;m being philosophical <br/>
and grateful, because the day will soon come when I won&#39;t know where he is <br/>
all the time, because it&#39;s none of my business, and the day will come when I&#39;ll <br/>
be lucky if he comes home once in a month or six.<br/>

Thanks for the reality check.  It&#39;s so easy to find myself in a pool <br/>
of pity and sorrow, feeling sorry for myself as I pick up the same <br/>
toy for the thousandth time (who&#39;s the fool here?!)...but what a <br/>
joy, what a blessing to have that child that brings out that toy, a <br/>
gift from them to me!  It will all be over so quickly, so, again, <br/>
thanks for the reminder to enjoy it!<br/>
