Maybe you need the above medicine you are prescribing, and with a statement<br/>
such as that (and many others)<br/>
how can you call someone else sophomoric?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428546158">&lt;&lt;I think our forefathers would roll in their graves&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lord, I hope so.  Because what our forefathers envisioned is not what our<br/>
country has become.  We put a spin on just about any other country so we can<br/>
make a dollar on the labor of others.  We commit social and financial<br/>
terrorism to make countries do what we want.  If you caught the interview<br/>
with Eagleburger (sp?) today, he alluded to this same fact.<br/>
<br/>
Lets talk Cuba.  Our government backed Castro&#39;s predecessor because he let<br/>
the rich get richer and poor get poorer.  The United Fruit Company bought up<br/>
the land and paid the local workers a pittance to send fancy fruit to<br/>
America.  (Very similar to what is happening with the oil companies in<br/>
Chiapas, Mexico which also encited an armed uprising.)  Kids were working in<br/>
a state of malnutrition so we could eat delicacies.  As many people were<br/>
jailed and killed during this regime as the current one, only difference is<br/>
the previous government was a puppet to ours.  Our government initially was<br/>
interested in backing Castor because they thought he would win anyway, but<br/>
as soon as they found out he wouldn&#39;t play ball with them, our government<br/>
portrayed him as the devil.  Cuba currently has better medical care and a<br/>
better literacy rate than us and Castor&#39;s approval rating is higher than<br/>
either Bush&#39;s or Clifton&#39;s.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518344865">Sorry about that last post.  Hope it was readable.  About half-way through<br/>
spell check, I realized I was hitting &quot;change&quot; rather than &quot;ignore.&quot;  So<br/>
anything that makes no sense, try to think of a word that sounds the same<br/>
and substitute  :)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Please don&#39;t tear apart my post, I am sure I worded much of it poorly. I am<br/>
 feeling a bit sensitive and not sure I want to deal with harsh words right<br/>
 now. I need some unschooling encouragment and words of guidance. Thanks .<br/>

to get rid of my baggage for my child&#39;s sake. It is such a tough road and <br/>
those of us who are conscience of it beat ourselves up so. I too have been <br/>
snappy for 2 days and hope I will do better today. So far I do not know <br/>
anyone involved personally and it has had such an affect on me. I cannot <br/>
imagine how you and others directly involved feel. My thoughts are w/ you and <br/>
go easy on yourself in your daily parenting. have you tried the PD board on <br/>
moms online? Lots of support.<br/>
