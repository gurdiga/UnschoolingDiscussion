<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018252097">I was wondering if anyone could toss some ideas my way.<br/>
<br/>
We have our very first back yard, mostly concrete with a grassy area <br/>
around one side to the back of the concrete (kinda like an upside <br/>
down L) chain link fence on both sides, and leading to the driveway a <br/>
high wooden fence on the back. A basketball hoop came with the yard <br/>
and we have a small trampoline(one of the single person deals)<br/>
<br/>
We are broke, and the backyard-in the words of Jaiden(5) sucks!- I <br/>
really need some cheap fun ideas on ways to make it more fun for <br/>
them, but I&#39;ve never had a yard before, and I&#39;m feeling clueless.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in Michigan, so it rains a lot, so what ever we do has to be <br/>
able to stand up to the elements. Any ideas? Jason is really handy <br/>
and can build just about anything I ask him to. <br/>
<br/>
Thanx so much....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980962512">Do you have friendly neighbors, or empty lots or sides<br/>
of roads where &quot;weeds&quot; grow?  I would ask neighbors<br/>
for cuttings and plants they are thining out, and go<br/>
to places that have wild plants growing.<br/>
<br/>
  I have &quot;harvested&quot; day lilies from the side of the<br/>
rail road tracks near my house, that grew like weeds,<br/>
and I have asked for plants from a nearby neighbor<br/>
with a major green thumb, she actually grows<br/>
strawberries on her roof!) and always plants too many<br/>
seeds to use in her own garden and yard.  <br/>
<br/>
Seeds are great, cheap too, just water once or twice a<br/>
day.  <br/>

Yes, but don&#39;t plant pumpkins if your yard is small already because they will <br/>
hog the whole place.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947467163">I&#39;m not sure of what area you live in Michigan, but here are two <br/>
links that may help you.  The first one is a Freecycle Group.  It&#39;s a <br/>
great place to get rid of stuff for FREE and aquire stuff for FREE.  <br/>
The second link is to the same type of FREE site that has to do <br/>
solely with gardening.  They&#39;re both great.  If the area&#39;s don&#39;t work <br/>
for you I know that there are other groups specific to other areas, <br/>
so look around.<br/>

I hope this helps - Tina<br/>

them, ***<br/>
<br/>
If you ask at a local tire store you might be able to get old tires cheap<br/>
or free.   Don&#39;t get the steel belted kind (do they still make those?)<br/>
because when they weather and the rubber splits you get those painfully<br/>
pokey ends of the steel belting stabbing out.   <br/>
<br/>
You can bury the tires partly in the ground, so that they make a kind of<br/>
archway to crawl through or drive radio controlled cars through.  Big<br/>
tires are better.  If you put several in a row it&#39;s more interesting<br/>
because then they form a tunnel.   <br/>
<br/>
We got sand for a sand box free by asking the city for a small pick up<br/>
truck load.   We made the sandbox from four 2X12&#39;s that my husband got<br/>
from the reject pile at the lumber mill.  They were boards that would<br/>
have gone into the burner and he got them cheaply.  Try that if you have<br/>
a lumber mill near you.  Sometimes you can get a good deal on slightly<br/>
damaged landscape timbers at nurseries or home improvement centers.<br/>
They&#39;re great for making a sandbox if you stack them two or three high<br/>
and bolt them together.   <br/>
<br/>
We got two bales of straw at the feed store and stacked one on the other<br/>
for a target range for the compound bow.   We can stick the dart board up<br/>
there too when we want to play darts.  <br/>
<br/>
You could make a horseshoe pit, if your kids like to play horseshoes.  <br/>
Maybe you&#39;d have to back fill with sand if it&#39;s really rainy or you&#39;d<br/>
just have a mud pit.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, make a mud pit!&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
You could plant a pole in a hole in the ground, fill the hole with cement<br/>
and make a tether ball thingy.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you have enough room for a Badminton net?  Those are fairly<br/>
inexpensive.<br/>
Bocce ball sets at K-Mart were cheap last fall but I haven&#39;t checked this<br/>
year.<br/>
Croquette sets aren&#39;t too expensive.    <br/>
<br/>
Do you have a tent?  A tent in the back yard is instant fun.  Especially<br/>
if you can run power to it for TV or radio, for late night adventure. <br/>
<br/>
Or, if you can run some clothes line wire between to high, stable points<br/>
(house and tree, tree and tree, house and tall fence) you can make a tent<br/>
out of a tarp over the wire.  <br/>
<br/>
If you can get or find some long poles you could build teepee type<br/>
structures and grow pole beans up them.  The beans vine all over and form<br/>
a canopy over the poles for little, one person hideaway&#39;s.    <br/>
<br/>
If you have room for a little garden they can be fun.  They bring birds<br/>
and insects and toads and bunnies into your yard and those things are<br/>
always interesting. <br/>
<br/>
You could grow big sunflowers.  They grow fast, look like alien visitors<br/>
and feed the birds in the fall. <br/>
If you have a patch where you could plant alot of them, (the tall ones)<br/>
then pull up enough to form a pathway, you&#39;d have a small maze.  <br/>
<br/>
David built a bean bag toss game.  I don&#39;t know if he just made it or<br/>
found the plans on-line somewhere.  It&#39;s a rectangular plywood frame<br/>
about 3&#39;X4&#39;.  It has a sloping surface with target holes cut in it. <br/>
Players stand back and toss bean bags at the target holes for points.  If<br/>
you cover it in marine varnish it would hold up in the rain. ( If you<br/>
want plans, e me off list and I&#39;ll ask David where they are. &lt;g&gt;) <br/>

Another fun thing to do with Sunflowers is to plant them in a circle <br/>
or other fun shape with the center open.  Plant Morning Glories right <br/>
beside the shape of Sunflowers.  As the Sunflowers grow the morning <br/>
glories will climb the sunflowers creating a fun hideaway.  This can <br/>
be done very cheaply with seeds.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040114025">Have you considered a sandbox, with a canopy or lid for protection both<br/>
against rain and visiting cats? I know there are places online that have<br/>
construction diagrams.<br/>
<br/>
Concrete could be screaming out to be drawn on with chalk or painted on. <br/>
<br/>
What about getting on one of those home makeover shows like &quot;Outer Spaces&quot;?<br/>
I kinda like Susie Coehlo (sp?)<br/>
<br/>
http://www.michigangardening.com/  has discussion boards.<br/>
<br/>
Bird houses, a bird bath and a dust bath for them?<br/>
<br/>
When I was little the thing I loved about my grandparents&#39; gardens were the<br/>
secret seeming or enclosed spaces, like behind a small hedge, or bushes. The<br/>
garden was divided by greenery and I could crawl between the hydrangeas to<br/>
make little cubbies. My neighbor had an upturned boat on a trailer that also<br/>
made a good hidden clubhouse. We played lots of fantasy games all around<br/>
both gardens including pirates, space travel, Josie and the Pussycats. The<br/>
side fence was about 3 feet high and was a great balance beam. <br/>
<br/>
I can hardly wait to have my own garden, so I envy you. Jayn loves just<br/>
digging in dirt and &quot;cooking&quot; mud pies. We used to do a lot of that with a<br/>
couple of our pot plants - until the landlord insisted we get rid of our<br/>
potted garden.<br/>

            Excellent idea, but I would add the caveat that you need to<br/>
make sure you are not using pressure-treated, aka &quot;treated&quot; lumber.  Any<br/>
treated lumber that was sold up until Jan 1 of this year probably<br/>
contains arsenic, and although stores are not allowed to sell the<br/>
arsenic stuff any more they still do (I know this from experience in<br/>
building my house).  The arsenic comes off on kids&#39; hands and then they<br/>
ingest it.  Old railroad ties are no good either because they are soaked<br/>
in creosote.<br/>

  Chalk! Cheap and colourful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986783572">At our old house we had a VERY good sand box.  It was railroad ties, two on <br/>
the side, one on each end, and the cinderblock wall for the back (where it <br/>
would get shade, but we also had rigged a sheet up over it for more shade, and we <br/>
would spray water on the sheet to help it not be as hot in there).<br/>
<br/>
We dug down a ways, and then bought two tons of sand, I think.  Not really <br/>
all that expensive for what you get.<br/>
<br/>
We had to move it back there with the wheelbarrow from the front, but maybe <br/>
you have back yard access.<br/>
<br/>
The most fun thing was burying the end of the hose before turning it on, then <br/>
building a mound on top of it, and guessing where the water would come out <br/>
when you turned it on kinda slow.  Then we would cover that place up and it <br/>
would come out somewhere else, and we&#39;d keep stopping it, wherever it came out.  <br/>
<br/>
That was just as much fun every time.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-243753573">If you can get or find some long poles you could build teepee type<br/>
structures and grow pole beans up them.  The beans vine all over and form<br/>
a canopy over the poles for little, one person hideaway&#39;s.    <br/>
<br/>
I built a teepee last weekend out of 10 pvc pipes, a painters tarp, and some rope.  I found the instructions online.  It was really quite easy and is just right for a small yard.<br/>

sunflower seeds in it and they grew into big beautiful sunflower plants <br/>

<br/>
That is SO totally adorable. What a cool idea.<br/>
<br/>
I can attest to the magic of sunflowers. My Mom had the most incredible garden every year, which my neice and nephews had day after day of magic moments in...my own children only once a year.<br/>
One of my fondest memories is my Mom, almost bald from chemotherapy, walking the garden with Sierra one night in Alaska. The sun was lower in the sky, but still shining beautifully (it was about 10 or 11 at night), and they wandered the garden picking peonies, smelling roses, tasting strawberries and skipping down the stepping stones into the sunflower house. <br/>
I followed them with the camera...it was one of those rare, perfect moments, when the whole world seems to come to a halt and every color, scent and sound is permanently etched into your mind. <br/>

other assorted sites. <br/>

I&#39;m still trying to ascertain whether they are homeschoolers by perusing the<br/>
