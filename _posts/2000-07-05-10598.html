&gt; &lt;&lt;  Before anyone asks<br/>
&gt;  about the relevance to an unschooling list, think of it<br/>
&gt;  as exploring cultural differences, : &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is crucial, even critical unschooling issue.  Recently, attacks<br/>
on homeschooling, especially on unschooling, have begun to move from<br/>
&quot;socialization&quot; to &quot;lack of exposure to diversity&quot;.  The fact that public<br/>
schools are now more segregated than they have been at any time in the past<br/>
30 years is easily ignored.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that as part of my responsibilities as a parent is to expose my<br/>
children to diverse peoples, religions, and cultures with whom they are<br/>
likely to come in contact as adults, and to provide opportunities for them to<br/>
increase their understanding about others who may be different than<br/>
themselves.  If anything, I think this is much more important in a modern<br/>
society than reading.<br/>

I will touring the East Coast September 1-19, giving homeschooling talks and<br/>
workshops related to &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me&quot;. For dates, and<br/>
locations, check out my website at www.skylarksings.com or send an e-mail to<br/>
