<div id="ygrps-yiv-674287713">I probably just need to lay off.  I feel like with him on the PS2 so much that maybe he would like to watch a movie with me or the rest of the family.  But that might not be what he likes.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;d probably rather play games with us,    so I&#39;ll leave it up to him.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Because my kids are getting older, I don&#39;t so often pick movies for the kids&#39; <br/>
sake as I used to.  Now they  have their own other avenues for finding <br/>
movies, or recommendations from friends.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve watched movies with all of them variously about things I never would <br/>
have watched on my own, and had lots of fun.  One was about snowboarders and <br/>
the resort&#39;s being taken over by an evil Texan (or some such).   Teenage boy <br/>
humor, mostly, but some great stunts and funny gags.<br/>
<br/>
Holly asked me to look on Netflix for a movie she had seen called <br/>
&quot;babysitting in the city&quot; or something, she said.  I just searched for <br/>
babysitting and told her her choices.  It was &quot;Adventures in Babysitting.&quot;  <br/>
It was FUN!   I started watching it with Keith last night, after we watched <br/>
Patriot Games (too violent for my tastes).  My foot&#39;s sore, and Keith was <br/>
soaking an ingrown toenail.  So we two aging parents were watching videos <br/>
together.  And so we put that one in.  Holly came home from a trip to the <br/>
mall with a teenaged friend of hers and I went to bed, while Holly watched <br/>
the rest of the kid-adventure movie.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of those movies were art films.  They weren&#39;t about historical <br/>
periods (well, the 1980&#39;s as a historical period, in the latter maybe).  <br/>
There was good music in both.<br/>
<br/>
But the best part was that the adults were participating with and paying <br/>
close attention to things the kids had liked or wanted to see.  And our going <br/>
into their world and communicating and communing was more important than <br/>
which movie it was.<br/>
<br/>
Another movie Holly brought home after seeing it elsewhere was the one about <br/>
the young pregnant woman who is abandoned at a WalMart--Where the Heart Is, I <br/>
think.  It did NOT sound interesting when she told me about it, but because <br/>
Holly was so enthusiastic, I watched it to see what had so sparked her <br/>
interest.  I COULD have said I didn&#39;t want to see it, because in many <br/>
rational and logical ways I didn&#39;t want to.  But I pressed myself to watch it <br/>
because I really love Holly.  And she was right, and I was wrong.  It was a <br/>
good movie, and we had great conversations because of it.<br/>
