<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096857338">&lt;&lt;&lt; School was just someplace where he spent time with his friends.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
Me to!  No one even figured it out until I was in the 11th grade, my<br/>
accounting teacher finally figured out what was wrong.  I would get the<br/>
right answers but how I go to it would be all wrong, he finally figured out<br/>
I inverted almost all of my numbers.  I don&#39;t really have many problems with<br/>
numbers anymore tho, once it was pointed out to me, I never really realized<br/>
what I was doing until then.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;It takes him 10 to 15 minutes to read one type written page.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is really to bad, because it doesn&#39;t have to be this way. I do read<br/>
slower then most people, and if im tired I have to read things a few times<br/>
to get what it says.  No matter how hard the PS tried they never shot down<br/>
my self esteem, and I never give up.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Chaelene actually sees the letters moving and changing positions while<br/>
she is looking at them.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actaully this isn&#39;t as bad as it sounds.  Since she can see it happening,<br/>
she should know, or will learn, that she should look at it again.  Makes you<br/>
slower, but you don&#39;t make as many mistakes, and with time you get faster.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I hate to say it but sometimes it is hard to be patient and I feel like I<br/>
am going to scream.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can understand how fusterating it must get for you.  Our society is based<br/>
off the PS, and there set standards.  Kids are supposed to be at a certian<br/>
place at a certian time.  Well, you&#39;ll have to through that out the window,<br/>
she isn&#39;t going to be able to do it overnight.  The &quot;programs&quot; that &quot;drill&quot;<br/>
dyslexics often do more harm then good, although I hear they are getting<br/>
better.  No longer is it thought that dyslexics just see things wrong, we<br/>
actually think differently, more abstract I think is a good word.  Also she<br/>
might enjoy activites that are geared more towards kinetic learners, I&#39;m a<br/>
huge kinectic learner and I&#39;ve talked to other dyslexics that are also.<br/>
