Welcome to TMM&#39;s annual paleontology showcase! The Texas Memorial Museum<br/>
has millions of fossils in its collections. Spanning hundreds of<br/>
millions of years, our fossils tell the story of the natural history of<br/>
Texas. At any given time, however, only a fraction of TMM&#39;s fossils are<br/>
on display in exhibits. The rest are in our research labs, on loan to<br/>
other museums around the world, or stored in our collection areas.<br/>
<br/>
This exhibit allows us to show off some of TMM&#39;s finest fossils. Some,<br/>
like the saber-toothed cat and the exquisite starfish from South Austin,<br/>
are old favorites that haven&#39;t been on display in<br/>
years. Others, like Chasmosaurus and the plesiosaur, are newer<br/>
acquisitions that have never been seen in public. In addition to our own<br/>
specimens, we are fortunate enough to have a few rare pieces on loan for<br/>
this exhibit. Two specimens are on loan from other museums:<br/>
Confuciusornis from the Beijing Museum of Natural History, and<br/>
Thrinaxodon from The University of California at Berkeley. In addition,<br/>
Diplocaulus is on loan from a private collector. We are grateful to<br/>
these lenders for allowing us the chance to display their specimens.<br/>
