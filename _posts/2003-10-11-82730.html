<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245334564">&lt;&lt;I&#39;m a high strung, happiness sucker outerer&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But anyone who can come up with this phrase has tremendous potential!!!<br/>
<br/>
Breathe easy and relax.  I&#39;ve been exactly where you are and I know how<br/>
crummy you feel.  I have 5 kids and a tremendous number of animals.  I have<br/>
a husband who used to want to control everything and seemed angry at us all<br/>
the time because somebody left the bikes out in the rain AGAIN, somebody<br/>
colored on the wall AGAIN, somebody broke a plate AGAIN, the dog pooped in<br/>
the garage AGAIN.  I felt like I had this standard that we needed to live up<br/>
to and I kept trying to make the kids live up to it.  I wanted the Cleavers<br/>
and I kept ending up with the Ozbournes.  We were all unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
So I decided to make some changes.....<br/>
<br/>
I told dh to get over it.  We have 5 kids, the house will not STAY clean,<br/>
things start to break down as soon as they are built because it is how the<br/>
world works, don&#39;t be mad at us because we are just being who we are. Get<br/>
over it.<br/>
<br/>
Then I went back to a lesson from Gandhi that is the most amazing, yet<br/>
simple thing.......He said to be the change you want to see in the world.<br/>
<br/>
If I want my home to be calmer, then I must be calmer.  If I take my &quot;angst&quot;<br/>
out of our home, it is calmer.<br/>
<br/>
If I want people in my family to be nicer to each other then I have to be<br/>
nicer.  If I take my meanness out of our home, then the family is being<br/>
nicer than they were with my meanness.<br/>
<br/>
And the amazing thing is the ripple effect.  The kids are calmer, nicer.  Dh<br/>
has been amazing.  I think it was a wakeup call for him as well.<br/>
<br/>
Things aren&#39;t perfect here.  But they are much, much calmer and nicer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153734621">Thanks Julie,<br/>
<br/>
it helps to see that someone has been where I am now and changed themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m slowly getting my head together - coming to this list helps heaps.<br/>
