<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744711847">Dear listmates-<br/>
If you had to recommend to a very reluctant ex-spouse one book, one<br/>
article, one magazine or one website in order to help him see the worth of<br/>
unschooling . . . which one would it be? My ex-husband is really working my<br/>
children and me on their education (or lack of it, as he sees it). The ex<br/>
isn&#39;t not much of a reader, so I&#39;m looking for the quintessential book to<br/>
suggest to him. I have never been happier with my children and their paths,<br/>
so this comes at a horrible time for me. . . just when I am finally<br/>
relaxing into this and truly seeing the worth. Thanks for your help.<br/>
In aloha, Lee<br/>

I also would second David Gutterson&#39;s book,   it was the first homeschooling book I read and my husband seemed to really relate to it.         Its not entirely unschooling but it has lots of great points.      <br/>

<br/>
Right. <br/>
Guys like it.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The Homeschooling Book of Answers is better for women, in my opinion.<br/>
Men don&#39;t seem to like lots of answers by moms.  They want answers by men.<br/>
