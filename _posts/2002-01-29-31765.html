With the written word<br/>
facing him at every turn, trying to let go of your expectations would be the<br/>
best thing for him. The more worried you are, the more you try to help, the <br/>
more<br/>
tense he&#39;ll feel and will remain stagnant. Trust that he&#39;ll figure it out <br/>
and<br/>
just sit back and watch.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I agree with this -- I would totally back off pushing reading on <br/>
him. But do offer to read to him, no matter how old he is, and do allow him <br/>
to see that YOU enjoy reading. If you do, of course. I have noticed that if <br/>
kids have a good vocabulary, they catch on to reading faster. So anything <br/>
that  builds vocabulary is going to help in the long run: plays, songs, <br/>
jokes, poems... heck, talking.<br/>
<br/>
But this brings me to another point. There are people on this list who <br/>
apparently know 16yos who can&#39;t or don&#39;t read. I think that would really <br/>
bother me. To those of you who are sure that if we just surround our kids <br/>
with books, etc., and then sit back and watch the magic happen: What if it <br/>
doesn&#39;t? Is it acceptable to become an adult in our society who just doesn&#39;t <br/>
read? Would you want to allow your kid to go out into the world so <br/>
unprepared? Aren&#39;t you worried they&#39;ll be taken advantage of, or be unable <br/>
to negotiate contracts/instructions/newspapers?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-217109804">Hi Annette!<br/>
<br/>
  you said:<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;But this brings me to another point. There are people on this list who <br/>
  apparently know 16yos who can&#39;t or don&#39;t read. I think that would really <br/>
  bother me. To those of you who are sure that if we just surround our kids <br/>
  with books, etc., and then sit back and watch the magic happen: What if it <br/>
  doesn&#39;t? Is it acceptable to become an adult in our society who just doesn&#39;t <br/>
  read? Would you want to allow your kid to go out into the world so <br/>
  unprepared? Aren&#39;t you worried they&#39;ll be taken advantage of, or be unable to negotiate contracts/instructions/newspapers?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m up late, my baby is asleep on my lap, and I am amazed to have a little time (but I would really like to be making some &quot;bad&quot; food to eat- ugh).  <br/>
<br/>
  This unschooling thing- oftentimes understanding it is not really like &quot;seeing that point&quot;, or seeing the flowers or the trees in a forest..<br/>
   <br/>
  it is more like jumping out into space and looking down on the whole world instead of just the forest..it is a paradigm shift.  Your whole framework is different-.<br/>
<br/>
   the old framework is full of ideas we have because we are such good students of our culture, we know it so well, it is not even a &quot;knowing&quot; anymore, more like our bones have it written on them. we dont question our premises.<br/>
<br/>
  So I think, when I read your question, I am not &quot;doing unschooling&quot; because of a result I am going for (i.e. magical reading).  It is not a &quot;method&quot; that I chose to &quot;educate&quot; my kids.  Because the focus is not my kids- it is me- it is me getting rid of my idea that I have the right, authority, responsibility, to force my ideas and adgendas onto another person&#39;s life.  I dont &quot;educate&quot; anyone (faulty premise)- people &quot;educate&quot; themselves. People can&#39;t eat for one another, and they can&#39;t learn for one another either.  <br/>
<br/>
  It is me getting rid of my idea that I have to &quot;worry&quot; about something that doesnt bother my child, that I have to give them help, ideas or things they didnt ask for. <br/>
<br/>
  And it is also realizing that when they do really need help, they *will* make it evident.  <br/>
<br/>
  It is unlearning the idea that kids are not capable of leading their own life, being their own person- it is learning that kids REALLY ARE REAL PEOPLE- just like me.  <br/>
<br/>
  It is learning that when we give up the idea that we have to live our life AND our children&#39;s life, we experience true freedom ourselves.  <br/>
<br/>
  Our codependant, dysfunctional society has few examples of real trust- so we cant really fit it in our brains.  BUT when we experience it first hand (not just read it in an e-mail :-), but really feel it, and our kids feel our trust, THEN lord have mercy!  we are looking at the world from heaven!  <br/>
<br/>
  Anyway,  Im thinking a paradigm shift is in order :-)<br/>
<br/>
  Love to you,<br/>
  Bronwen<br/>

16. I think reading is a basic skill for survival in this society. My kid<br/>
is almost six and he is just starting to read. We do phonics stuff and sound<br/>
games every day *at his request*. But even if he weren&#39;t into it, I&#39;d<br/>
start &quot;making him&quot; at a later age. Not at the age he is now, but certainly<br/>
by 10 or so. Yup, you betcha I would! It is the one thing I feel strongly<br/>
that he has to learn. Years ago, it was illegal for my ancestors to learn<br/>
how to read (we are African American) in this country. I feel it would be<br/>
a slap in the face for all their struggles for me to neglect this one<br/>
aspect of his upbringing.<br/>

read.  And damaged our relationship to boot.  I honestly think he would <br/>
have read sooner and better if I&#39;d left him alone about it.<br/>
<br/>
I also believe that there have always been and always will be some people <br/>
who just aren&#39;t academically inclined, people who will always learn in <br/>
other ways than reading.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to push these kids into <br/>
an academic mold when they could well be the person who invents something <br/>
really useful to our society or something.  Edison eventually learned to <br/>
read.  If he&#39;d been made to stay in school and learn academics, we would <br/>
probably have missed out on a lot of useful inventions.<br/>
<br/>
My son is able to read what he *has* to, though slowly.  I think his <br/>
reading will still improve by the time he&#39;s ready to leave home, but if it <br/>
doesn&#39;t, he&#39;s still going to be ok.<br/>

incorporated into our general read-aloud snuggle times and it&#39;s been a<br/>
good experience for us. Of course, the kid has always been a book hog so I<br/>
guess that has something to do w/it. We can literally spend the entire<br/>
day reading aloud and he never tires of it; he&#39;s just always had a<br/>

approach since it seems to be working for him. Obviously, kids are<br/>
individuals and have their own learning styles -- just like we do.<br/>

wanted to do them.  He loved being read to but didn&#39;t want to read for <br/>
himself yet.  If your son asked for phonics and reading games, great.  It&#39;s <br/>
just that you said (I think it was you, could be wrong) there was an age <br/>
beyond which you *would* force the issue.  That age for me was 12.  And it <br/>
really was a mistake.  (Never mind that it wasn&#39;t unschooling.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I *do* understand what you&#39;re saying, Lynn.<br/>
<br/>
This is really more of a message to others with the same fears, rather than<br/>
directed at you, Lynn. More a discussion of the *idea* of delayed reading<br/>
being equated with illiteracy.<br/>
<br/>
*If* someone wanted to get past the fear that their child wouldn&#39;t read if<br/>
they waited too long, there are *plenty* of stories, particularly at<br/>
Unschooling.com, that can assure people that if the printed word is a fun,<br/>
useful part of their lives that they will read when they&#39;re developmentally<br/>
ready. We get filled up with too many scary stories of kids hitting 16 and<br/>
being illiterate, and the *cause* that&#39;s pointed to is because the school<br/>
failed them, because it didn&#39;t have the proper programs at the proper time.<br/>
But it just isn&#39;t true. It&#39;s because of the pressure to read by a certain<br/>
age (4th grade), the stigma of being singled out because you can&#39;t do what<br/>
&quot;everyone&quot; else can, the tedium of being forced to do something you don&#39;t<br/>
want to do yet and have no interest in. When that environment is removed,<br/>
kids *do* (honestly! :-) learn to read when they are developmentally ready<br/>
and they feel reading is worthwhile to *them*.<br/>
<br/>
School and society fill us with so many certainties about how children learn<br/>
but that really just aren&#39;t true outside the setting of school.<br/>

that affect one&#39;s ability to function as an adult in society? This is not<br/>
a perfect world. Sometimes, my feeling is, ya gotta have some survival<br/>
skills.<br/>
<br/>
WRT learning things when one is ready, I offer myself as an example. I had<br/>
guitar lessons as a kid and kind of burnt out on them. Recently, I&#39;ve<br/>
picked it up again and am having a great time playing and learning. Which<br/>
is great. I don&#39;t see guitar playing as an essential skill for surviving<br/>
in this society. (It is good for my soul, however!) I don&#39;t need to know<br/>
guitar to maintain a bank account, sign a contract, have a business, get<br/>
a job. For most of these things, however, it&#39;s pretty necessary, for the<br/>
most part, that one knows how to read. Unless one wants to constantly rely<br/>
on the help of others. Shouldn&#39;t we help our children get along w/out<br/>
us? Also, I posit that it&#39;s easier to learn some things when one is young.<br/>
Like riding a bicycle.<br/>

restrictive and/or exclusive environment (which, I think, is contrary to <br/>
unschooling), I think it would highly unlikely that anyone would not <br/>
find the desire to learn how to read by their late teens or early 20&#39;s.  <br/>
Learning how to function in society on one&#39;s own terms - that&#39;s a big <br/>
part of unschooling to me.  IMHO, unschooling allows the person to <br/>
determine what the survival skills are and learn those skills on his/her <br/>
own terms.  It&#39;s all about respecting the individual and allowing that <br/>
individual to determine what is important and what is not important.<br/>
