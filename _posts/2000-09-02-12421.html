<br/>
I&#39;m not going to get into the spanking debate (yet...only one cup of coffee)<br/>
but I have noticed with myself, my husband, our family and friends, and yes<br/>
here on these lists.....that when people are stressed, they tend to become<br/>
controlling. If your husband is working all the time, he must be tired and<br/>
stressed. This (along with his own upbringing) may cause him to feel he<br/>
needs to &quot;keep the kids in line&quot;.  I know when I&#39;m having a good day, I<br/>
pretty much let things go as far as the kids spilling things or forgetting<br/>
something, etc. But when I&#39;m having a stressful day, these things somehow<br/>
become important and I over-react.  If it&#39;s a real &quot;issue&quot; (like one hitting<br/>
the other) then my reaction is the same, but the volume of my voice is<br/>
greater under stress, I know. I don&#39;t know if this helps, but I was hoping<br/>
if you could understand _why_ your husband felt this way, you could better<br/>
handle it.<br/>
<br/>
My recommended reading is &quot;Dare to Discipline&quot; by James Dobson....discipline<br/>
meaning to correct and lead, not thrash.<br/>

I bet you&#39;re making a lot of friends in Tennesee and W. Virginia<br/>
now....Where in the world are you that you would make such a remark? Some<br/>
place of great enlightenment I imagine. I have always lived in the land of<br/>
lattes...the Pacific North West, a rather eclectic place where you will find<br/>
all kinds of people. Even people who do choose not to spank. And I don&#39;t<br/>
insult them.<br/>
