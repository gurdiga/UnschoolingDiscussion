 Your CD has been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with <br/>
 sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow. <br/>
 <br/>
 A team of 50 employees inspected your CD and polished it to make sure <br/>
 it was in the best possible condition before mailing. <br/>
 <br/>
 Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over <br/>
 the crowd as he put your CD into the finest gold-lined box that money <br/>
 can buy. <br/>
 <br/>
 We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party <br/>
 marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of <br/>
 Portland waved &#39;Bon Voyage!&#39; to your package, on its way to you, in <br/>
 our private CD Baby jet on this day, Sunday, October 8th. <br/>
 <br/>
  I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby. We sure did. Your <br/>
picture is on our wall as &#39;Customer of the Year&#39;. We&#39;re all <br/>
 exhausted but can&#39;t wait for you to come back to CDBABY.COM!! <br/>
 <br/>
 Thank you once again, <br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-67534219">I ordered a couple of CDs from them too and was floored when I got the note.  Loved it too.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was the same note.  :)   Made me want to buy more ;)<br/>
