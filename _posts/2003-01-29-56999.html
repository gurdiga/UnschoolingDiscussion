 </span></blockquote>Herein lies a cold fact, people who are of that 40 something generation COULD <br/>
do that much more easily than a 20 something can now.  MANY more people are <br/>
college graduate, with advanced degrees even.  MOST companies when they <br/>
advertise for jobs almost always indicate that a degree is necessary, even if <br/>
we KNOW people who are doing that job wonderfully without one right now.<br/>
<br/>
Look in the Washington Post and see all the numerous jobs that want so much <br/>
experience AND a degree.  Sometimes you wouldn&#39;t have had to to get that <br/>
degree AND have all that experience they want unless you were forty something <br/>
I think!  (and many of them are at entry level pay)<br/>
<br/>
I agree that there are many ways to get into a field you are interested in <br/>
but in todays market a college degree is way more important than it was <br/>
twenty years ago.  Some how it seems to get you in the door to show them what <br/>
you can do or what you know.<br/>

<br/>
That is true, however if you know someone...that can work very well too.<br/>
<br/>
And I think the trend toward requiring degrees is going to swing the other direction soon.  I think businesses are going to start looking for those who are willing to LEARN, even if its on the job.<br/>
<br/>
And I think Homeschoolers and Unschoolers are going to be the ones setting the pace.  We are just now becoming known for how we perform (geography bees, spelling bees, etc).  Colleges are beginning to take notice of that.  Business owners won&#39;t be far behind.<br/>
<br/>
This may be a few years off, but we are no longer in the age of information.  We are in the age of networking.  I&#39;d guess that in about 10 more years, a college degree isn&#39;t going to mean nearly as much as it does now to business owners.<br/>

The number of people being homeschooled is growing too so this will have a huge impact on the work population.   And the different industries will see the benefits of hiring these homeschoolers! <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re thinking of computer engineering, probably so.<br/>
<br/>
But if you think of jobs which don&#39;t really quite EXIST yet, no college in <br/>
the country can prepare anyone for them, and they WILL go to the kids who are <br/>
doing that thing, whatever it is, which has hardly been named.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how the 60&#39;s computer guys who are systems analysists now got their <br/>
jobs without degrees.  There WERE no computer science degrees then.   The <br/>
guys who cared about computers as hobbies regardless of whether they could <br/>
make money at it or not were in the position to end up making money.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;MANY more people are <br/>
college graduate, with advanced degrees even. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.  But there are many more people, and the degrees are pretty widely <br/>
considered to be worth less than they used to be, in terms of respect <br/>
(despite what they cost in interest on stuent loans).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I agree that there are many ways to get into a field you are interested in <br/>
but in todays market a college degree is way more important than it was <br/>
twenty years ago.  Some how it seems to get you in the door to show them what <br/>

<br/>
Not in any field I can think of except engineering and computers.<br/>

&gt; many of us have actually used that piece of paper... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Used&quot; the degree?<br/>
I taught school which I couldn&#39;t have done without the degree. <br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t like the question.   If it is JUST &quot;used that piece of paper,&quot; <br/>
someone used a piece of paper on me the other day to try to win an argument <br/>
in an online forum.  (It didn&#39;t work, but they &quot;used&quot; it, or at least the <br/>
report of having the piece of paper.)<br/>
<br/>
Do I use what I learned in college?<br/>
<br/>
Every single day.  <br/>
<br/>
Last week I got a call from someone I met in college.  A month ago I got a <br/>
long chatty e-mail with an important question from someone I met in college.  <br/>
Does that count?<br/>
<br/>
I studied anthropology.  I had NO idea what it was before I went to college.  <br/>
 I loved it.  All my thoughts about culture and mothering and the role of <br/>
children as children or as &quot;humans&quot; (members of the society) come through <br/>
that filter of what I learned in cultural anthropology.<br/>
<br/>
What I learned in Shakespeare classes (I eventually took four of those) is <br/>
that even the greatest professors are sometimes guessing.  And sometimes <br/>
guesses are later proven to have been lame or plainly wrong.   (That message <br/>
was reinforced as I learned more about dictionaries and the history of words <br/>
and about religion and the source materials involved with that, but it was in <br/>
a Shakespeare class that the light came on and examples flooded in from <br/>
everywhere.)<br/>
<br/>
Monday I was playing Renaissance music with three friends.  I had a music <br/>
teacher teach me recorder (I could play recorder, but he taught me to play it <br/>
as it was played in the baroque, as a serious solo instrument) and he treated <br/>
me like I had just as much potential to do that as anyone ever had.<br/>
<br/>
I was assigned to read John Holt there.<br/>
<br/>
In applied psychology classes I learned lots of things about how learning <br/>
works.  And in volunteering to be the subject in lots of psychology <br/>
experiments about learning and patterns and such, I learned about how those <br/>
tests work and what&#39;s valid about them and what&#39;s totally goofy about them <br/>
sometimes.  How flawed a correspondence type of &quot;proof&quot; can really be.  &quot;We <br/>
have a correlation.&quot;  Not always an impressive claim.<br/>
<br/>
I can throw pottery.  Haven&#39;t for a long time, but liked it lots when I was.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of those things I might have come to anyway.  Had I not been there, I <br/>
might have found the things elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve worked some jobs that needed no college degree, after I had one.  <br/>
Employers always seemed nervous, like I would bolt on them any second for <br/>
being &quot;over qualified.&quot;  But what I had learned in college wasn&#39;t helping me <br/>
do what they were paying me to do.  I learned that stuff where I was.  <br/>
<br/>
College, if a kid wants to go there, provides lots more than the degree.  If <br/>
we believe in learning over paper, we should be the first in line to say <br/>
happy, voluntary college attendance can change a life even if the kid &quot;fails&quot; <br/>
at completion of a degree.<br/>
<br/>
If we say &quot;You want to take a class?  Great!  have fun!&quot;<br/>
or... &quot;Do you want to go there full time for a while?  Go for it!&quot; <br/>
we can help enable winners.<br/>
<br/>
If we do the same traditional mean stuff and say that FIRST they need to know <br/>
what degree they want and THEN they need to buckle down and not socialize, <br/>
and not take fun artsy classes, and THEN press them to finish quickly...   <br/>
and tell them and all our relatives for decades that they screwed up and <br/>
didn&#39;t finish, if they don&#39;t have a degree, then what will we have learned <br/>
from unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Dabbling is a glory.  Should someone want to commit to eat a whole bowl of <br/>
frosting or whipped cream just to stick a finger onto the edge of the bowl <br/>
and taste it?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Point well taken. I also feel like I got a lot out of college, from <br/>
friends I met in the dorms to that cool English lit teacher who <br/>
sparked an interest in poetry, to my awesome swimming coach who <br/>
changed my whole life. <br/>
<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t change my hypothesis that having the piece of paper <br/>
is no guarantee of a job in the specific field that the piece of <br/>
paper says you&#39;re qualified in. I think lots people are often hung <br/>
up on the idea of acquiring that paper (or having their kids acquire <br/>
it), not based on the idea that you can learn lots of really cool <br/>
stuff in college, but based on the idea that the paper saying you&#39;re <br/>
qualified in Field X is necessary to get a job in Field X. For me, <br/>
while I loved college and would whole-heartedly recommend it to <br/>
anyone, my kids included, just for the experiences you gain there, I <br/>
also don&#39;t see the pursuit of that piece of paper as absolutely <br/>
necessary for gainful employment in the field of one&#39;s passion. Many <br/>
folks I know were never actually employed in the field that they <br/>
chose to get a degree in (myself included). Many people with a <br/>
passion in a particular field would be better served learning that <br/>
field in another way, whether or not they also go to college (myself <br/>
probably included). Many people find their life&#39;s passion many years <br/>
after acquiring the piece of paper. That doesn&#39;t mean college isn&#39;t <br/>
cool, fun, or a great place to learn about a variety of things, or <br/>
even necessary for some pursuits.<br/>

I feel greatly for people who ALMOST get a degree.  Just a class or test or <br/>
essay (that story about the spelling was scary) or dissertation away after <br/>
all that time and money.<br/>
