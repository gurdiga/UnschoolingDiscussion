My kids like most of the junk mail. They sort it out between all of themselves. Some of them have the plastic  fake &quot;credit cards&quot; and they take turns about who will get the next one. My middle daughter likes the envelopes and draws pictures and writes letters to whoever and stuffs them in the envelope. They cut out pictures and on and on so here it&#39;s not that big of a deal.<br/>
