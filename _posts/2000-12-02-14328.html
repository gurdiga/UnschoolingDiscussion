Hi Sandra,<br/>
We used to belong to HSLD and received their Court Report<br/>
magazine..(hmmm...I never thought about it in this way before tho, but I<br/>
think you are probably right)<br/>
We decided to end our support of HSLD after reading the article in Home<br/>
Education magazine about the court mess with Cheryl S and we also did not<br/>
like Mr. Farris&#39; attitude.<br/>
We are Christian, but do not fit in with our local (mostly conservative) hs<br/>
group because of our unschooling ways.  There has been some local trouble,<br/>
with a couple homeschool families being &#39;hot-lined&#39;.. mostly because of<br/>
neighbors that simply do not understand the nature of homeschooling, but its<br/>
never went beyond an interview with the families.<br/>
I still struggle with &#39;record keeping&#39; too, and worry about how things will<br/>
look if we ever do have to prove anything. I wish all of this weren&#39;t<br/>
necessary, I wish my girls and I could just forget all of the proper<br/>
paperwork thing and just enjoy our life and learning together.<br/>
BYW- I really appreciate your words of wisdom, and this list.. I think I&#39;ve<br/>
finally found my &#39;support group&#39;..<br/>
