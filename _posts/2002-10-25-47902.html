Another thing that really helped me were tapes.  Her peaceful parenting tape<br/>
is great.  Also Anne O has some great parenting tapes that helped me to get<br/>
to a place where I could understand, feel comfortable  and *live*<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think all of these resources can help a person get to that happy<br/>
unschooling place.   Discussion lists, message boards,  tapes,  books,  and<br/>
of course meeting these people, in person, at conferences.  :)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the segue, Kelli! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The tapes are in from the 2003 conference. Please go to the SOS website and <br/>
check out the Resource page. I&#39;m ready to get them out of my dining room!<br/>

We also have a few t-shirts left, but e-mail me first to see whether we have <br/>
your size in stock before you send $$ for it.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for the tardiness in getting them out. Personal problems----and <br/>
all my fault. But they&#39;re available now! So order away!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll need to post this everywhere, but y&#39;all are the first to know!<br/>
