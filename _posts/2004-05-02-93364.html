I think the problem isn&#39;t with your daughter or with swimming.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s with the definition of &quot;learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If she tagged all the requirements of the course and got her certificate or <br/>
patch or whatever, it means she passed a course.  It doesn&#39;t mean she became a <br/>
proficient swimmer.<br/>
<br/>
With school, there is an ancient tradition of kids denying that they remember <br/>
what they learned last year, even when they most absolutely DO remember.  It <br/>
buys them more easy grades and days of being able to doodle and daydream if <br/>
they look blankly at the teacher when she says, &quot;So you all learned what nouns <br/>
were last year, right?&quot;  If they said &quot;Lady, we&#39;ve known for four years, and <br/>
they just keep telling us,&quot; they might be in for something new and more <br/>
difficult, so they squinch their eyebrows, and look at the ceiling and shake their <br/>
heads slowly and shrug.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been the kid and I&#39;ve been the teacher.  Repeatedly, both parts of that <br/>
traditional play.<br/>
<br/>
And part of that forms the basis for all serial learning.  You review what <br/>
they were supposed to have learned the last time.  You preview what they will <br/>
learn in the next level.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s course-taking, it&#39;s not often real learning.<br/>
<br/>
Someone could conceivably &quot;take a course&quot; in unschooling and pass it by <br/>
parroting back what the teacher wanted to hear (if there were such a course, and <br/>
there was some talk years back of HEM sponsoring one in an online school, but it <br/>
was decided against).   The student could demonstrate that she knew the <br/>
difference between John Holt and John Dewey, between Maslow and mazel tov and get a <br/>
certificate.<br/>
<br/>
Would it mean that she was an unschooler?  That she would or could <br/>
confidently spend years with her child and not pull out the Saxon math books or phonics <br/>
flash cards just because the kid turned six and it seemed like time?   <br/>
<br/>
Some things are only learned by doing.  <br/>
<br/>
Some courses are only passed by parroting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>More important than whether or not this is normal is does this bother <br/>
her? If not, then it&#39;s not really a problem. If it bothers her and <br/>
she wants to maintain continuity, find out how often she needs to go <br/>
to maintain her level and make it a point to get to a pool that <br/>
often. Both of our kids love to swim, so we plan at least one family <br/>
swimming night a week, though we try to do more (especially in the <br/>
summer!). It&#39;s entirely possible that if they went long enough <br/>
without swimming, they might forget part or all of how to do it. I <br/>
was amazed that a 10 day vacation was enough to wipe my daughter&#39;s <br/>
memory of most of the violin music she plays by memory. She forgot <br/>
all the way down to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Because she doesn&#39;t <br/>
have as much musical knowledge - hand/finger connections, ear/finger <br/>
connections, years of listening to and playing music as I (a grown-<br/>
up) does, it fled her memory faster than it did mine. However, I was <br/>
considerably more rusty when we returned home as well. I think that&#39;s <br/>
natural.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766714362">&lt;&lt;Is this normal?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely.  We have a pool in the backyard and the beginning of each summer<br/>
is a refresher for everyone under about 8.<br/>

<br/>
I think I just wrote this in another post.<br/>
<br/>
When my boys learned to swim, they learned to swim.<br/>
<br/>
My mother had my brother and me take swim lessons every year without fail <br/>
because &quot;people forget how to swim from year to year.&quot; No, we don&#39;t. We forget <br/>
when we haven&#39;t really learned!<br/>
<br/>
Frnak Smith&#39;s _Book of Learning and Forgetting_ shows how well this ties in <br/>
with LAL learning.<br/>
