<div id="ygrps-yiv-221478857">Hi,<br/>
  I wanted to write about a good friend of mine and her  kids. The kids are 3 <br/>
girls age 7, 12 and 16 and all attend public school. The older girls get <br/>
near-to-failing grades and their parents ground them, etc...because of the grades. <br/>
These girls seem to be very creative and have many interests and don&#39;t care <br/>
about school. The youngest is very popular, good grades and fits into the <br/>
school life very well. I have heard my friend mention to others that school <br/>
requires kids to fit into a certain mold and her oldest two just don&#39;t fit into it <br/>
well. Yes, my friend knows we homeschool and she has no interst in trying it.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, the middle daughter came up to me at a recent picnic and began <br/>
telling me about how much she loves to write stories and poetry. She showed me a <br/>
poem she wrote that had been published in her school&#39;s journal and spoke very <br/>
passionately about her writing. I mentioned magazines that are made up of kids&#39; <br/>
submissions and she was so excited. I just feel so bad for her because I just <br/>
picture how she could flourish as a homeschooler. I got her a kid&#39;s book on <br/>
writing poetry and I&#39;m giving her a few back issues of Stone Soup and Creative <br/>
Kids magazines to help encourage her. (My friend is fine with it.)<br/>
<br/>
  Not really looking for any advice here, but I&#39;ve been thinking about her a <br/>
lot.<br/>

That&#39;s cool, Amy.<br/>
<br/>
Would a copy of the Teenage Liberation Handbook only make her unhappy?  Maybe <br/>
you could channel little bits of those ideas to her gradually.  She can learn <br/>
in spite of school.   <br/>
<br/>
I had lots of adults interested in me when I was a kid, and so when I say I <br/>
had fun in school, some of it must be in some large part because I had <br/>
off-sides friendships with a lot of teachers and with other kids&#39; parents.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even better might be her Guerilla Learning book. From what I hear it&#39;s<br/>
unschooling for kids who are stuck in school.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe both. The Lib book for what&#39;s ideal and the Guerilla book for<br/>
compromise.<br/>
