<div id="ygrps-yiv-853197057">I do agree wholeheartedly that one should  read postings on this loop for <br/>
about two weeks, or accomplish knowledge of the group by (argh! pop-ups) <br/>
going through past postings.  Why?  so to be able to learn what&#39;s going on in <br/>
all the many threads and not repeat questions recently exhausted!<br/>
<br/>
Having said that I (sheepishly) admit I&#39;ve only been on one day....<br/>
<br/>
Enjoying what I&#39;ve read so far--jumping in later though!<br/>
