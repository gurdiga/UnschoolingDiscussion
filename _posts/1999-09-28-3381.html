<div id="ygrps-yiv-492919693">I haven&#39;t tried this myself yet, but I understand that one can use these<br/>
plastic soda bottles in the mail! I&#39;ve heard of moms sending their<br/>
college age kids letters and tiny little goodies in a soda bottle! I<br/>
think the plan was to cut an opening near the bottom of the bottle, then<br/>
tape it shut with a good quality tape. Of course, you could fill it with<br/>
shredded paper, etc. to keep everything from bouncing around.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Does anyone have any recycle/craft ideas for plastic soda bottles, 20<br/>
oz and 1 liter?  My kids have quite a collection now.&gt;<br/>

actually send entire whole *food* through the US Mail, like a pumpkin!<br/>
Just write the address on it and send it off! Anyone have any<br/>
experiences with this? <br/>
