<div id="ygrps-yiv-157985096">Hello to all.. I have been looking for quite a while now trying to <br/>
gather as much information as I can on unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I have a 13 y/o DS, who has struggled for a long time in public <br/>
school and decided during Christmas break to pull him out and <br/>
start &quot;homeschooling&quot; him. Spent hundreds of dollars on books and <br/>
supplies.. not to mention $3000.00 for new computer, software, desk.. <br/>
whole, shall we say kitandkaboodle. Needless to say, the books have <br/>
hardly been used, computer used for internet and gaming mostly, oh <br/>
and don&#39;t forget cd burning. Anyway, I had this ideal picture of <br/>
what &quot;homeschooling&quot; was going to be and that is not what has <br/>
happened.<br/>
<br/>
I had been &quot;fighting&quot; with him to do &quot;work&quot;. He is totally not <br/>
interested in written work and I have recently backed off. He gets up <br/>
when he wakes up, which some days isn&#39;t until noon, he plays video <br/>
games or whatever he chooses.. but I have given up the &quot;fight&quot;. I <br/>
have been spending alot of time on the new computer (someone here <br/>
should put it to good use.. lol) researching and learning more about <br/>
unschooling. Seems what we might need to try. <br/>
<br/>
We live in NC and have to subject our children to what they call EOG <br/>
(End of Grade) testing. I have recently learned that my ds doesn&#39;t <br/>
know how to do long division and has great difficulty with his <br/>
multiplication tables and I am very stressed out over the tests. <br/>
Probably, more so than he is. There is no way around these tests and <br/>
I was just wondering if anyone had any advice on how we should handle <br/>
them. Stressed out or with a grain of salt?<br/>
<br/>
I would like to apologize a hundred times for being so long-winded.. <br/>
I have a problem with that sometimes. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for all the great advice that I am sure will come <br/>
my way!<br/>
Cindy<br/>
<br/>
PS.. anyone else here from NC??</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Welcome to unschooling!  <br/>
<br/>
I am also from NC.   You DO NOT have to give &quot;EOG&quot; tests.   You DO have to <br/>
give a standardized test once a year. But, it can be the test of your choice, <br/>
the &quot;grade level&quot; of your choice.   You can give your son a first grade test <br/>
if you want.  And, you do not have to send the results to the state, just <br/>
keep them on file &quot;in case&quot; they want to see them for one year.    Many folks <br/>
are misinformed about requirements of NC for homeschooling.  There are lots <br/>
of &quot;recommendations&quot; that the state lists, but they are NOT required.   <br/>
<br/>
  As far as the yearly testing, per the suggestion another NC unschooler ( <br/>
HEY PAM!) I give my children a test from a  CD-ROM called &quot;Children&#39;s Skills <br/>
Test&quot;  You can find them for sale on Ebay all the time, very reasonably <br/>
priced.  Don&#39;t sweat it.  Actually, NC is a very easy state to homeschool in. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Relax, the testing isn&#39;t that bad.  There is no &quot;grade level&quot; you have to <br/>
test at, no threshold to meet, no reward/punishment.  Just take whatever test <br/>
he wants to take and keep the results on hand for one year.  That is all.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t say &quot;End of Grade&quot; test.  There is no mention of grade on the <br/>
requirements.  I let my boys pick which &quot;grade&quot; they want to test at.  That <br/>
gives them more control.  Just relax.  The web site is  ncdnpe.org<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598087322">Hi Cindy!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to unschooling (Natural Learning, as I like to say ;) but a <br/>
veteran homeschooler, for the past eight years. It was only at the <br/>
beginning of this year that I ever even thought about Natural <br/>
Learning. Anyway. Even if I hadn&#39;t come to the conclusion that <br/>
unschooling is the way to go, and you were to come to me, a veteran <br/>
homeschooler with subjects and paperwork and all, asking for advice, <br/>
I would say &quot;Take one full year off of academics altogether. Don&#39;t do <br/>
anything even remotely resembling schoolwork. Instead, build the <br/>
relationship. Do things with your son, and let him decompress. <br/>
Getting the relationship right is absolutely the best thing you can <br/>
do.&quot; I&#39;ve told moms that, who have asked me in the past, even when <br/>
I&#39;ve been in my most militant &quot;Math first, then a page of writing, <br/>
and an hour of reading, and then lunch, and after that, some natural <br/>
science&quot; scheduled mode. The first year of homeschooling, whether it <br/>
be unschooling or more structured, should be one of building the <br/>
friendship with your kids. And don&#39;t fret the academics. <br/>
<br/>
peace, blessings, HeidiC<br/>
<br/>
p.s. read John Holt; read John Taylor Gatto (well, they&#39;re who helped <br/>
bring me around) and read the links Sandra has recommended<br/>

Hi,  Heidi --<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something in your phrasing that makes it sound like academics<br/>
might pop back up in the second year.  Is that really what you expect,<br/>
or is it just a comforting idea for curriculum users who might be very<br/>
uncomfortable plunging into unschooling without a net?<br/>

I&#39;ll reiterate what I said on the message boards:<br/>
<br/>
You have an unschooling conference just around the corner and in your back <br/>
yard.<br/>
The School&#39;s Out Support Live & Learn Unschooling Conference August 22-24 in <br/>
Columbia, South Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
The some of the biggest names in unschooling will be there presenting. The <br/>
others&#39;ll just be hanging around! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll won&#39;t want to miss the opportunity. And your son will be able to meet <br/>
other unschoolers. There&#39;ll be tons of fun stuff for both of you to do and <br/>
learn!<br/>

<br/>
I think when you&#39;re easing away from something it&#39;s not too horrible to say <br/>
that to a doubting dad or to a mom who just now almost is about to put down <br/>
the curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
If people REALLY stay away from structure for a whole year and they honestly <br/>
put some effort into unschooling, few go back.<br/>
<br/>
In AA when they say they&#39;re not going to drink today, it KIND of implies they <br/>
might not drink tomorrow.  But they consider it a success if they get through <br/>
a day.  And if they go a month or a year it makes it easier to go another day.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is WAY better than structure and fighting and crying.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone is able to say &quot;I can do this for a year and see&quot; but would never <br/>
be able to say &quot;I will do this forever,&quot; then the year is a good plan.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015170665">Hey Cindy,<br/>
I&#39;m from NC, too--Asheville--where are you?  <br/>
My kids take the Childrens Skills Test--I think<br/>
someone else mentioned that, too--you can take it at<br/>
home and you don&#39;t have to turn the scores into<br/>
anyone--just have them on hand.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like having to do testing at all since it<br/>
bothers my oldest dtr (age 11)--if she doesn&#39;t do<br/>
really well on something she takes that to mean she&#39;s<br/>
&quot;bad&quot; at it.  I&#39;m not always sure how to handle this. <br/>
At one point she threw herself on the couch and<br/>
refused to finish the test because she didn&#39;t know how<br/>
to multiply fractions and do long division.  I told<br/>
her there would be no reason for her to know this<br/>
since she&#39;s never done it.  She wasn&#39;t satisfied<br/>
w/that answer, so I finally got exasperated and told<br/>
her she either needed to accept that she didn&#39;t know<br/>
long division or, if it bothered her that much, that<br/>
she could learn how to do it.  <br/>
The next day she went back to it and asked me:  so you<br/>
really don&#39;t care how I do on this?  I told her no,<br/>
not at all--it&#39;s just a hoop we have to jump<br/>
through--so she finished it and seemed to feel ok with<br/>
the results.<br/>
<br/>
How do other people handle this kind of thing?  I<br/>
think she does wonder if she isn&#39;t bad at math--she<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to learn the drill math and I don&#39;t think<br/>
it&#39;s important for her to learn it other than to show<br/>
her that she could do it if she wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565294458">Hi Betsy<br/>
<br/>
I probably do sound kind of iffy...maybe because I&#39;m in MAJOR <br/>
deschooling/nervous/what-to-do mode right now.<br/>
<br/>
the point I was trying to make was, even if I weren&#39;t strongly <br/>
leaning towards and beginning to practice unschooling, I&#39;d recommend <br/>
a year of zero academics. I am leaning to unschooling, big time, but <br/>
even in my most &quot;school at home&quot;ish, I made that recommendation to <br/>
anyone who asked me about it. &quot;Take a full year off academics, <br/>
because building the relationship is by far the most important thing. <br/>
If they fall behind (I used to say) in academics, they can always <br/>
catch up. IF the relationship falls behind, it&#39;s much more difficult <br/>
to make any of it work.&quot; that&#39;s what I was trying to say.<br/>

Hi, Heidi --<br/>

Yeah.  I just get kind of nit-picky sometimes.  I may even be being<br/>
overzealous about unschooling to cover up my own wobbly doubts.  IRL I&#39;m<br/>
surrounded by eclectic types and my competitive feelings DO get stirred<br/>
up.  I have those &quot;Gosh, their kids might be learning more than mine is&quot;<br/>
freakouts.  And I&#39;m not really satisified in how I&#39;m dealing with those<br/>
nagging worries.<br/>

I had a twinge of that lately, being the end of the year with graduations and <br/>
such.  I got back to the idea of how absolutely ridiculous it is that we <br/>
require and expect schools to  &quot;teach them everything they *might* ever need to <br/>
know&quot; and then society blames the school for not making it happen, failing to <br/>
understand that not only is that a useless expectation, but impossible as well.  <br/>
<br/>
But in an unschooling context &quot;everything *they* need to know&quot; does indeed <br/>
happen.  Remember that, and maybe you&#39;ll feel better?  <br/>
