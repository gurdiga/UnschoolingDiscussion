independently.  We also have very different interests.  I found my <br/>
day whittled away with mundane tasks and chores.  Finally,  I woke <br/>
up and realized that I too deserved to follow my interests.  In doing <br/>
so,  I think that I&#39;m doing the best I can for my teenagers.  I model <br/>
unschooling on a daily basis,  showing, not telling them, that <br/>
learning is forever.  My 13 year old helps with some chores and <br/>
understands that it gives both of us time to pursue our interests.<br/>
Actually,  the hardest thing for me, after all those years focusing <br/>
on my kids, was to figure out what my interests were.  Hard, but fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-621743487">I&#39;m new to this list and kind of new to unschooling although it seems I am<br/>
just returning to my roots.:) My decision to homeschool began with reading<br/>
John Holt, GWS, Home Ed Magazine and on and on. Four years ago, when my<br/>
older daughter was 5, I had to register as a homeschooler with a local<br/>
school as required. I chose a Waldorf school. Well, that started me down a<br/>
road of homeschooling with a Waldorf influence. WE has both incredible<br/>
child-led freedom and a very strict school dogma... which has been a major<br/>
challenge for me. The dogma side became too much and I have now turned to<br/>
unschooling with a Waldorf approach &lt;bwg&gt;. It has not been difficult to<br/>
drop the &quot;lessons&quot; and trust that my daughters are learning all the time.<br/>
What I do have trouble with is what to do all day!!<br/>
<br/>
I know, I know- you probable all hate that question!! But I need to know. I<br/>
am not worried about the children- they have plenty to do. But it hardly<br/>
ever involves me! If I start on my own project, then it seems like we don&#39;t<br/>
see each other all day. I know that I am always there for them and they do<br/>
sometimes come for help with changing drillbits, threading a needle,<br/>
spelling a word, answering a question, calming a battle... but the schooled<br/>
side of me says &quot;This is not enough! I should be teaching them something!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So please, what do you grownups do? I read of a mother who tells her<br/>
children the hours she is available (undisturbed by housework, cooking,<br/>
dishes) to help them with their projects and reminds them when it is their<br/>
time to be with her. Would that be enough?! I like to think I&#39;m always<br/>
available, but there are things that need to be done and the girls don&#39;t<br/>
necessarily always want to be involved. Helen- what did you do when the<br/>
boys were at the fishing hole for hours on end?!<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your sharing your wisdom and your lives on this list and on<br/>
the message boards.<br/>
Forever grateful,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That sounds kind of businesslike to me. Regular hours and all? I suppose if<br/>
the mother is one of those types who can&#39;t walk and chew gum at the same<br/>
time she might need to sort out her time into slots and advise her children<br/>
which slots are theirs, but that approach really just leaves me cold. Part<br/>
of being a mom is learning to juggle lots of needs, demands, ideas,<br/>
approaches... I guess some people are better at it than others though.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL! Would you believe they&#39;re out at the fishing hole right now? :-) One<br/>
of the older, married sons (Jim, the industrial electrician I mentioned a<br/>
day or so ago) is here visiting (with his wife and daughter), and the whole<br/>
crew took off to catch enough trout for dinner this evening!<br/>
<br/>
So what am I doing? Working. Tracking developments on the AHA-Networking<br/>
list (it&#39;s getting a little hair-raising, for those of you who aren&#39;t over<br/>
there), paying bills, shuffling laundry through the washer and dryer,<br/>
working on some articles and columns for the next issue with our two<br/>
editors, watching a peach upsidedown cake in the oven for this evening, and<br/>
just generally keeping myself busy. Being a working (at home) mom gives me<br/>
plenty to do every day, but if I weren&#39;t doing this I&#39;d probably find other<br/>
things to keep me busy, like gardening, painting, playing piano, writing,<br/>
reading, working with our horses or a million other things I can think of<br/>
to do. I&#39;ve never been one to be bored for long - as the old saying goes,<br/>
&quot;The world is so full of a number of things, I&#39;m sure we should all be as<br/>
happy as kings.&quot; I kinda suspect not many kings have it as well as I do<br/>
though. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
&gt; So please, what do you grownups do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on the day.<br/>
<br/>
Today I washed the dishes, played in the sudden rain, talked to a friend<br/>
about gardening, helped a friend by downloading a large file for him (he<br/>
has a very slow modem and I have a cable modem), talked to my husband on<br/>
the phone (he&#39;s away on business), coded some web pages, relayed a message<br/>
to my newsletter editor, played cards with my daughter, played cards alone,<br/>
discussed a book with one of my sons, mediated a dispute between kids,<br/>
played with the cats, read and wrote some e-mail, looked up some<br/>
information for my other son so he could write something about it, had a<br/>
discussion about puberty, discussed marketing, discussed business law,<br/>
thought about a wide variety of things, listened to a CD (and talked about<br/>
it), and fixed food.<br/>
<br/>
This has been a rather slow relaxing day, actually.  I&#39;ve mostly been<br/>
waiting for an important phone call that hasn&#39;t come yet.<br/>
<br/>
I generally do a fair amount of volunteer work for a number of<br/>
organizations I&#39;m interested in, I run a business, I read and write a lot,<br/>
I occasionally clean house.  The kids are interwoven throughout my days,<br/>
coming in and out with whatever is on their minds.  Most days, one or more<br/>
of us leaves the house and goes to do something, but today we&#39;ve all stayed<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, we watched the Wizard of Oz, and for the very first time, I *finally*<br/>
realized why it is that when I used to watch it as a kid, I never noticed<br/>
that it&#39;s in B&W at the beginning, and turns to color in Oz.  It&#39;s because<br/>
when I was a kid, we had a B&W TV!  It *didn&#39;t* turn to color!  LOL!<br/>
