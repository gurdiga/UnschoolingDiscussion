Today she said she is concerned about how her son will &quot;get&quot; Biology next <br/>
year ( he is 15).  All the dissecting frogs and stuff.   Folks gave several <br/>
suggestions for online stuff and local classes.  I was thinking.. &quot;can&#39;t he <br/>
just catch a frog and cut it up if he wants to?&quot;  LOL.. but I didn&#39;t say that.    <br/>
 We are going to be meeting her and her daughter again soon, she and Anna <br/>
might hit it off.  Anna said today that she was very nice and she would like to <br/>
do something with them again. &gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Never pushed them but my kids wouldn&#39;t have ever cut up a frog {thogh they may would in the future if it&#39;s what they NEED to do to follow their dreams- like be a Vet.} <br/>
But they did enjoy  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.froguts.com/">http://www.froguts.com/</a>  hee hee<br/>
