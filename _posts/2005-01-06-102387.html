<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340369627">For younger kids playing with older people, we all like the aMazing <br/>
Labrinth.  (Okay, I spelled that wrong, hmmm)<br/>
<br/>
Chess for Three (a very interesting twist on playing chess)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not exactly board games, we really like:<br/>
<br/>
Carcasonne (with expansions)<br/>
<br/>
Mad Dash (boy, if you don&#39;t know about this one - it is SO much fun - <br/>
you connect the states in 2 minutes, the one who gets the most points <br/>
wins - coast to coast gets a bonus.  Would be a schoolish item, but it <br/>
is too much fun!)<br/>
<br/>
Fluxx<br/>
<br/>
Quarto (a very fun four in a row game where your opponent selects the <br/>
piece you will place, making it very interesting)</div>

<br/>
It can be a pretty mean game when played with just adults, too &lt;g&gt;<br/>
