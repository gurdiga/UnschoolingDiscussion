<div id="ygrps-yiv-146382133">It&#39;s a funny thing about what one gets accustom to.<br/>
<br/>
My folks also wore pj&#39;s all the time. Winter jammies and summer jammies and <br/>
I of course did also. When I came down to FL for school, I still did <br/>
although I think I modernized myself a bit and maybe changed to big <br/>
t-shirts. Once I got out of school. the pj&#39;s went out the window. I&#39;ve slept <br/>
naked ever since. Tara does now too. She has pj&#39;s but those are for out of <br/>
the shower and before bed!<br/>
<br/>
The kids know Joe and I sleep in the buff but have always worn shirts to <br/>
bed. The baby wears onesies. Sierra had like one or two nightgowns that she <br/>
would wear whenever they came up in the drawer. Well the baby got a <br/>
nightgown for Christmas and just fell in love with it. Wanted to wear it <br/>
every night and had a fit when I needed to wash it. Sierra would wear the <br/>
ones she had along with Alyssa so they could be twins! Needless to say that <br/>
I had to go and buy both of them more nightgowns and also Joseph a pair of <br/>
pj&#39;s as he was feeling like maybe he should have some too!! He wore his once <br/>
and switched back to his t-shirts. The girls did their nightgown thing for <br/>
about 2 weeks. One night, a rather hot night, Alyssa had to more nightgowns <br/>
that were clean and refused to wear anything but her diaper. Fine with me. <br/>
Sierra liked that idea and took off her shirt for bed that night too. They <br/>
both did that for about 5 days and now they are back to shirts, onesies and <br/>
nightgowns again. Like a regualr circus around here!!!!!<br/>
