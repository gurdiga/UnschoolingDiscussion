<div id="ygrps-yiv-298288240">**Homeschooling is school at home. . .taking what they do in school and <br/>
bringing it home.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I tried to do at first and it was very painful.  Then it slowly <br/>
dawned on me that &quot;school at home&quot; was just what I  was trying to get away <br/>
from by pulling her from the ps.  I&#39;ve met some other h/s that have a <br/>
schedule and replicate the school format and it is a struggle for them. I <br/>
know others that, like myself, are letting the child do most of the schooling <br/>
while I provide the materials, excitement, guidance and facilities for her.  <br/>
I direct, I won&#39;t deny that, but I don&#39;t control. When I try to control the <br/>
school and subject specific learning too much, then I&#39;m right back in &quot;doing <br/>
school at home.&quot;  For me that was very frustrating and even more so for my <br/>
girl.<br/>
I am gaining a  lot of helpful information here and I am glad for this <br/>
resource. I absolutely think that there is room for all of us, no matter <br/>
where on the spectrum of unschooling we fall.  I&#39;m sad to see Kate go, I tend <br/>
to be in the same blending as she is.  I use math materials to teach my girl <br/>
subjects. I use other materials to lead us in activities (her Girl Scout <br/>
badge book is a great resource for stuff and she loves earning badges.)<br/>
I hope that there is room for all of us in the spectrum of teaching at home =)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interesting that you see unschooling as a spectrum.  I&#39;ve always seen <br/>
homeschooling as a spectrum, from school-at-home to unschooling.  I don&#39;t <br/>
see unschooling as a spectrum, though, but I guess I&#39;d say that there&#39;s a <br/>
spectrum of &quot;moving toward unschooling&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I do believe there is a place here for anyone who wants to learn more about <br/>
unschooling.  I also think that when someone shows by their posts that they <br/>
don&#39;t quite &quot;get&quot; how important giving up control is, that they will be <br/>
questioned.  (I hope not criticized.)  I know how hard it can be to give up <br/>
control, but I don&#39;t think people can really &quot;get&quot; unschooling until they <br/>
do.  (It took me quite a while, and I started out as what I thought was a <br/>
diehard unschooler!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s definitely room for everyone who teaches at home in the spectrum of <br/>
teaching at home.  But the phrase &quot;teaching at home&quot; tends to ring alarm <br/>
bells in the unschooler.  It&#39;s not that we never teach.  I&#39;ll teach my son <br/>
how to use a dictionary or how to look stuff up in the phone book . . . . . <br/>
. . . if he asks or indicates in some way that he hasn&#39;t been able to <br/>
figure it out.  But the word teaching tends to bring up images of a <br/>
schoolteacher who decides what, when, how, and why to learn.  That&#39;s what <br/>
we&#39;re trying to avoid for our kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it is important to remember again, that not everyone uses <br/>
words the same way.  I don&#39;t think of ps exclusively when you say <br/>
teacher for a few reasons.  My mom is a teacher.  Some of my best <br/>
teachers were not part of the school system but they taught me many <br/>
valuable things.  I had to really concentrate on figuring out which <br/>
words were hot buttons here because I don&#39;t use them with the same <br/>
conntations and the flip side of that is that many of the things I&#39;ve <br/>
heard here come across to me in a way quite different from the authors <br/>
intentions (I believe) and it took me a bit of time to get the true <br/>
meanings.<br/>
