<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253564546">Well, I have a two month old and I am 37 years old. I used a midwife <br/>
and told her that I would not abort a baby if it was a Downs baby <br/>
anyways, so what was the use of the amnio? She agreed. In conjunction <br/>
with that, why have those other blood tests (I can&#39;t remember the name <br/>
of them)? I opted out of those, too. She said that 50% of those come <br/>
back as a false postiive. And, because of my age, the lab would <br/>
automatically recommend that I have an amnio. Why go through that <br/>
stress?<br/>
<br/>
Amnio was not worth the risk to me. Risk of a miscarriage from an <br/>
amnio and the risk of a Downs baby, for my age, is about equal. Risk <br/>
of a miscarriage from an amnio, I CAN control, by not having it done. <br/>
I can&#39;t control whether or not I will have a Downs Syndrome baby. <br/>
That&#39;s in God&#39;s hands. <br/>
<br/>
I plan on having another child and I will opt out of the tests again. <br/>
Less stress all around!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-82377412">I opted out of the tests too, when I was 39 and pregnant with a planned<br/>
baby I decided that if I couldn&#39;t accept the risk of having a Downs baby,<br/>
then I shouldn&#39;t be even thinking of having a child.   She was 100% perfect<br/>
and I was so pleased that I hadn&#39;t risked her life to the amnio.   When I<br/>
found myself pregnant at 40 with a self-planned baby I still couldn&#39;t have<br/>
the test, and again I was lucky and had a &quot;normal&quot; baby.    In both cases I<br/>
was prepared to love my baby even if she/he was not perfect.<br/>
