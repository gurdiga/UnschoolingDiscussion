<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hi All<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a problem that I need some input on by parents who won&#39;t just tell <br/>
&gt; me that my children just need to learn who is boss!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When anyone visits, often my 11 year old son, James, likes to listen to the <br/>
&gt; conversation. While this is okay by me most of the time, sometimes its not. <br/>
&gt; He doesn&#39;t like to let anything go past without understanding it. So he <br/>
&gt; keeps interrupting the conversation with &quot;What did she say?&quot;, &quot;What did she <br/>
&gt; mean when she said...&quot;, &quot;What did you mean when you said that...&quot; &quot;How...&quot; <br/>
&gt; and so on. Whilst in principal I see no reason why he shouldn&#39;t be there or <br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t take part in the conversation, his need for constant explanations <br/>
&gt; kills the conversation. The person I am trying to talk to becomes <br/>
&gt; frustrated, I become frustrated, we forget what we were talking about and <br/>
&gt; often run out of time. On one occasion, a friend was trying to introduce me <br/>
&gt; to someone, but James was so demanding that she ended up turning to the <br/>
&gt; lady, throwing up her hands and saying &quot;It&#39;s impossible to talk to Sue.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I get to a stage where I ask him to let me have a talk on my own to <br/>
&gt; whoever, he is hurt and feels ostracized (He suffered a lot with bullying <br/>
&gt; when in school) and just genuinely doesn&#39;t understand why I would need to <br/>
&gt; talk to someone without him there. I then have to try and explain that we <br/>
&gt; are not talking about him, not talking about anything top secret but that <br/>
&gt; we do want to talk and are having trouble having a conversation with his <br/>
&gt; over involvement. I try to explain that a conversation involves listening <br/>
&gt; and talking but that with his constant questions he is monopolizing the <br/>
&gt; conversation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes too there are conversations which are beyond his experience and <br/>
&gt; whilst I don&#39;t want to give the impression that they are top secret, the <br/>
&gt; conversation can&#39;t go beyond his understanding while he insists on a <br/>
&gt; dictionary definition of every word. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do find the situation is a lot less stressful around people who have a <br/>
&gt; more accepting view of children - unschoolers in particular but it still <br/>
&gt; happens at a lower level. With people who expect to be able to talk <br/>
&gt; exclusively to me and that the children will just go and play quietly <br/>
&gt; somewhere, his needs seem to quadruple and I end up feeling overwhelmed by <br/>
&gt; the struggle of trying to have a conversation. Then I hesitate to ask him <br/>
&gt; to go away, because I know they will expect me to tell him to go away and <br/>
&gt; punish him if he doesn&#39;t. I don&#39;t want to do that. When I ask him to go <br/>
&gt; away he doesn&#39;t understand ends up crying and still doesn&#39;t go away. End of <br/>
&gt; conversation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have come so far in the time since we left school and began unschooling <br/>
&gt; (two and a half years ago), but the emotional school scars are still there <br/>
&gt; and I find it frustrating that visitors usually don&#39;t get to see us as we <br/>
&gt; now are - far more relaxed and comfortable with each other - because of <br/>
&gt; this conversation stress.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I want to respect James&#39; need for explanations, but also be able to meet my <br/>
&gt; need to talk to people.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone got any advice?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

If you are ok with it let it be. He is your son, your responsibility. I would <br/>
not tell him to go away for the sake of anyone else.<br/>
My Father In Law says my son knows too much. I ask him what is it that you <br/>
dont think he should know? He cant answer that. Some people are just in the <br/>
children should been seen and not heard mode. <br/>
If it does bother you enough to want to speak to him or ask him to leave, <br/>
Maybe sit down with him and explain....... What.....Why though ... explain <br/>
what? I was going to give a suggestion but then I wonder why cant he ask, why <br/>
cant he know what something means?<br/>
<br/>
Our son is very sociable, he can talk to anyone about anything. He holds a <br/>
conversation better than I can and he is only 11.<br/>
<br/>
If you have to tell people he is doing a study on human interactions. Why an <br/>
excuse I dont know, I wouldn&#39;t but it may help your situation.<br/>
<br/>
As for the private needed conversations ... I am blank tonight. The only <br/>
ideas I can think of is a movie, video game, do it over the phone or go out <br/>
side where he may get interested in something else.<br/>
