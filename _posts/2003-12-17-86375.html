<div id="ygrps-yiv-385425187">Hi All,<br/>
We just recently inherited some coins and need advice on how to care for them.  There are tons of books and supply catalogs etc out there.  Does anyone on the list have any personal recommendations?<br/>
Also on a related note, we have some coins and paper money from other countries that we would like to investigate (Who or what is on the coin, other denominations etc? ) store/display.  Is there such a thing as a foreign coin book or do you have to investigate them individually.  When the weather clears I will hit the library.  Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I bet you could find this all using google.com without waiting for weather to <br/>
clear!<br/>
