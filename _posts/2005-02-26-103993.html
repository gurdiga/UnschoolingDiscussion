<div id="ygrps-yiv-641110249">Eric Idle and Mike Nichols have made a Broadway musical of MP/The <br/>
Holy Grail. I saw Eric Idle on CNN last night and an article on <br/>
MSNBC today. One of the comments was about the number of audience <br/>
members who are already *off book* with the lines. I only hope it <br/>
ocmes out here to the arid desert.<br/>
