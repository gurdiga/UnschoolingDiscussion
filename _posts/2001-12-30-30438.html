<div id="ygrps-yiv-510046809">A little off topic but yes, there are people who call themselves vegetarians who eat fish.<br/>
They are called pesco-vegetarians.<br/>
My sister has recently started eating this way after being vegetarian for 15 years, and I am considering it also having been a vegetarian for many years.<br/>
We have been questioning surmounting reports on the dangers of eating soy products.<br/>

speaking of keeping score, seems to come up frequently as a concern in<br/>
*your* posts, so perhaps the only person doing so is you.<br/>
