<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819699321">&lt;&lt; I&#39;m curious what the people whose kids <br/>
play these games think, especially since Lars is both a new learning driver <br/>
and thinking of buying a new game system. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I&#39;ve played all the racing games we have had or rented.  I&#39;ve played the ones <br/>
with real steering wheels in the arcades.  They are really hard to play.  <br/>
They&#39;re nothing like actual driving.  Whole different sensation.  Being good at <br/>
the games could lead to a cockiness that should quickly dissipate in a new <br/>
driver.  I&#39;ve seen that cockiness on the go-kart track among 14 yo&#39;s who have <br/>
never driven.  My own 14 yo&#39;s quickly realized the difference when they were <br/>
behind the real wheel.<br/>
