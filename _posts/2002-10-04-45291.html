<br/>
Let&#39;s not cast ourselves in roles either -- good parent, bad parent,<br/>
permissive parent, authoritarian parent.  Let&#39;s start thinking of<br/>
ourselves as human beings first, with great potential for growth and<br/>
change.  The process of living or working with children is demanding<br/>
and exhausting. It requires heart, intelligence, and stamina.  When<br/>
we don&#39;t live up to our own expectations -- and we won&#39;t always --<br/>
let&#39;s be as kind to ourselves as we are to our youngsters.  If our<br/>
children deserve a thousand chances, and then one more, let&#39;s give<br/>
ourselves a thousand chances -- and then two more.&quot; ~~ from &quot;How to<br/>

UNSCHOOLING IS MY JOB<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/195/sounschool.html">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/195/sounschool.html</a><br/>
<br/>
What makes unschooling so hard for me is its very nature. Incredible<br/>
things happen, but I don&#39;t know when they are going to happen and<br/>
sometimes the timing is disconcerting. Occasionally I hunger for a<br/>
schedule that is written in stone. I want us all to get up at the<br/>
same time in the morning and do our chores and start on our<br/>
activities together at the same time. I want us all to eat at the<br/>
same time. I want the kids to want to read when I want to read and I<br/>
want them to need my help when I have scheduled it into the day.<br/>
There are moments when I&#39;ve had enough of spontaneity.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to think that unschooling is not a &quot;thing,&quot; it is just life.<br/>
And perhaps if we were homesteading and training our kids to take<br/>
their places beside ours in the struggle for survival, it would be an<br/>
organic part of life. But we&#39;re not. The reality is that this home is<br/>
a temporary way station for my kids to live before they go off on<br/>
their own. And on subtle and not-so-subtle levels they feel the<br/>
difference. They love us, and especially as they get older, they do<br/>
seem to feel a genuine desire to help us out, but they don&#39;t have a<br/>
real stake in our present community because they know they will be<br/>
leaving it.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing this has made my job as family manager all the more complex.<br/>
It has been my repeated hope that when the kids are adults they will<br/>
want to come visit us because of what we share, and not out of some<br/>
form of guilt. In the families of the past, I believe that<br/>
spirituality and hard work bound people together. If you didn&#39;t pull<br/>
your weight in the garden or on the hunt, everyone went hungry. For<br/>
this family, at this time, that is not the case. Since we are not<br/>
struggling for survival, the question comes up, &quot;What are we doing<br/>
here at all?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, always on my mind is the hope that our daily living will provide<br/>
us with interests that hold us together when everyone is grown, and<br/>
it seems to be happening. This past week Sara gave me a cookbook that<br/>
I have used every day. She recommended two books on nutrition that I<br/>
am buying for our library. She and April are working on piano duets<br/>
that they play when they get together. Sara is out of the house but<br/>
her relationship with all of us continues to grow. It is the same<br/>
with Jake.<br/>
<br/>
How do I quantify the kind of hours of work that went into creating a<br/>
home where this is the outcome? It is a thrilling outcome, but it is<br/>
not always so easy to see when I am bogged down in the daily routine<br/>
of getting someone - anyone - to just clean the bathroom and be quiet<br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
Being a mother is the first job to which I ever felt completely,<br/>
totally committed. If I were to analyze it, I would say that I looked<br/>
at the work that needed to be done and wrote my own job description.<br/>
I had to take into account the century in which we live and the<br/>
geographical location in which we find ourselves as well as our means<br/>
of monetary support. I also had to define what my purpose is in<br/>
raising children.<br/>
<br/>
I will not win the Nobel Prize for this job, nor will I earn any<br/>
money for it. Whether I homeschool or unschool, the reality is that I<br/>
will not be able to follow up on all the great writing ideas that<br/>
come into my head. Nevertheless I will try, because part of my job<br/>
description is to have my own interests and eventually phase myself<br/>
out of my job.<br/>

<br/>
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This may seem silly, but the thing I most enjoyed about my own<br/>
school years were the little awards, the teacher&#39;s compliments on my<br/>
report card and other tangible signs that I was smart and valuable.<br/>
What on earth can homeschoolers do to provide a shoebox full of<br/>
memories for our children?&quot; ~~ newly homeschooling in Wisconsin ~~<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am a very concerned educator in Indiana who has a relative in<br/>
Colorado. I am very concerned about this relative who is SUPPOSEDLY<br/>
homeschooling two young boys.  One boy should be in 8th grade and the<br/>
other 3rd or 4th grade.  They have not gone to a public or private<br/>
school at least 3 years.  I feel that the mother, who would be the<br/>
homeschool educator, is not planning, educating, evaluating, keeping<br/>
permanent records or putting forth the time or effort to educate<br/>
these boys.  I feel that in the future I might regret keeping not<br/>
alerting the proper authorities of what I might know. Here&#39;s the<br/>
question:  Is there a way to have these boys checked on to see if<br/>
this supposed homeschooling is being done?  I feel that these boys<br/>
will fall through the cracks of the homeschool system!&quot;  ~~ Concerned<br/>
relative ~~<br/>

I think people have inherent interests that will find an outlet in<br/>
whatever way they can, like water seeping through cracks. Sure the<br/>
limitations will be there, as they are in whatever situation one is<br/>
in; limitations help shape us for our destiny. It is my hope that I<br/>
can assist my children to encounter people or mediums that have the<br/>
sort of information that they find fascinating and compelling, as I<br/>
certainly can&#39;t provide everything that they need. I have faith that<br/>
life in its divine, rich Wholeness can though. ~~ Neri, on the<br/>

CALLING ALL COLLEGE APPLICANTS<br/>
<br/>
My name is Joanna; I am a production assistant for The Merrow Report, PBS&#39;s<br/>
premiere series on youth and learning. We are currently in<br/>
pre-production for a piece on applying to college from homeschool.<br/>
Although the angle is undecided, we are leaning toward the journey of<br/>
homeschooled seniors applying to major national universities.<br/>
<br/>
If you or anyone you know is graduating or has recently graduated and fits this<br/>
description, you could be a focus for our documentary and I would<br/>
love to hear from you. Also, any current issues in the world of<br/>
homeschooling that may be interesting to cover are welcome ideas.<br/>
Thanks, and my email is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jgc221@...">jgc221@...</a> . Hope to hear from you.<br/>

Did you know you can buy homeschool books at the Home Education<br/>
Magazine website? We&#39;ve narrowed the selection down to a few we think<br/>
are best. You&#39;ll find some of your favorite HEM columnists there,<br/>
along with other popular homeschool writers.<br/>

<br/>
Jan McCormick writes of her science projects site: &quot;The science<br/>
projects on this site were written by a musician and philosopher; not<br/>
a scientist.&quot; That may be true, but you&#39;ll still find a lot of good<br/>
science on this site and the projects are accessible and fun. If your<br/>
homeschool group does a science fair or cooperative classes, or if<br/>
you just like science projects, you&#39;ll find plenty of ideas to keep<br/>
kids interested with projects like &quot;Mr. Icky,&quot; &quot;Light Bulb vs. the<br/>
Sun,&quot; &quot;Territorial Battles of Air and Liquid&quot; and &quot;Is There a Genie<br/>
in the Bottle?&quot;<br/>

HOMESCHOOLERS HELPING HOMESCHOOLERS<br/>
by Pam Sorooshian and Sue Patterson<br/>
<br/>
This year, record numbers of families are choosing home education.<br/>
They are often confused, scared and apprehensive. Support from<br/>
experienced homeschoolers can sometimes provide just what they need<br/>
to help them gain confidence in themselves. The National Home<br/>
Education Network&#39;s website offers information, networking, and<br/>
support for new homeschoolers at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/newhser/default.asp?id=227.">http://www.nhen.org/newhser/default.asp?id=227.</a> Here is a sampling of<br/>
words of advice offered there by long-time homeschoolers from all<br/>
over the country.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m fond of telling folks that the what and how will come if they do<br/>
one simple thing: Observe the children as they play and learn, get a<br/>
&#39;feel&#39; for the best way to go about this to &#39;fit&#39; the individual<br/>
child. The children themselves give us remarkable clues, if we as<br/>
parents have but the wisdom and patience to interpret them.&quot;<br/>
~ Linda Dobson, New York ~<br/>
<br/>
Start with the child, not the resource<br/>
2. Ask for your child&#39;s input, regardless of their age. I have always<br/>
been surprised at how well my kids know what they need and how they<br/>
want to go about getting it.<br/>
3. Don&#39;t buy anything expensive the first year.<br/>
4. Kids don&#39;t have to finish everything they start - sometimes they<br/>
come back to it (even years later) and sometimes they don&#39;t.<br/>
5. The child is in charge of the learning -- always, regardless of<br/>
what resource, method, or philosophy you employ or hold.<br/>
6. Homeschooling is a long-term adventure. There are few things that<br/>
have to be accomplished by a particular age.<br/>
7. School schedules and school resources were developed for ease of<br/>
teaching not for ease of learning. Big difference. ~ Christine Webb,<br/>
Oregon ~<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Children need the opportunity to experience the world personally,<br/>
using hands, bodies, and all the senses, as well as the mind. These<br/>
experiences could include water, sand, mud, plants, animals, cooking,<br/>
repair, all aspects of family life, social relation -ships, privacy,<br/>
books, art, construction, crafts, dance, model building, sports,<br/>
drama, math, communication, machinery (including anything from<br/>
crowbars to computers), music, science, spiritual belief systems,<br/>
literature, history, travel, and more. Paper and pencil<br/>
representations of reality (i.e. packaged curriculums or dependence<br/>
on workbooks) are occasionally a valuable tool. Used excessively,<br/>
such materials are a flavorless substitute for the real thing.&quot; ~ Ann<br/>
Lahrson-Fisher, Oregon ~<br/>
<br/>
(You can read the rest of this article at the NHEN web address found<br/>
in the body of this excerpt.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
DISGUSTOSCOPE<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eskimo.com/~billb/amateur/dscope.html">http://www.eskimo.com/~billb/amateur/dscope.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a variation on the beautiful, infinitely changing<br/>
kaleidoscope-a disgustoscope. Inventor William J. Beaty calls it,<br/>
&quot;Beautiful radial symmetry and pristine mathematics, perverted into a<br/>
revolting, horrible, yet highly amusing little optical toy.&quot;<br/>
Personally, I&#39;m going to ask my husband to take this one.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
HEART MAN<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://members.aol.com/cjsteer">http://members.aol.com/cjsteer</a><br/>
<br/>
What have you got to lose? It&#39;s free and it&#39;s a video about the<br/>
heart, the effects of alcohol and nicotine on the heart and it stars<br/>
a man who lives with both a donated heart and a kidney. He shows his<br/>
old diseased heart, just in case anybody doesn&#39;t believe he knows<br/>
what he&#39;s talking about. I haven&#39;t received mine yet, so I can&#39;t tell<br/>
you any more than what&#39;s on the website, but it sounds interesting.<br/>
For kids age 13 and up.<br/>
