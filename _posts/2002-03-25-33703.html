original post...I&#39;m on digest and am not sure how to reply to an individual <br/>
poster, but yet to the list - for the benefit of everyone who may be <br/>
interested, so I&#39;m approaching this from the way I do know...anyway...<br/>

Do you have any suggestions on what helps writing...develop? I have<br/>
also read that sometimes motor skills develop at different levels - I notice <br/>
she really presses hard with her pens/pencils - she says her hand hurts - <br/>
maybe she just isn&#39;t ready? ...<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts??<br/>

Hi, Heather,<br/>
<br/>
If your 7 yo is ready to write, but finds the process painful and <br/>
frustrating, you may want to look into the following website:<br/>
<br/>
Handwriting Without Tears, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hwtears.com">http://www.hwtears.com</a><br/>
<br/>
There is a section &quot;Just for Parents&quot;  with Fun Ideas you can do at home to <br/>
enourage handwriting practice, such as having child draw letters on the wall <br/>
of the tub in shaving cream or soap paint, finger painting letters, using <br/>
chalk on the sidealk, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Also a section on &quot;Readiness,&quot;  help with extra practice with developing <br/>
fine motor skills with playful activities (using scissors, playing with <br/>
clay, picking up small buttons, beads, etc., up from floor using tweezers, <br/>
squirting water bottle outdoors on sidewalk).<br/>
<br/>
Of particular interest to you may be &quot;Common Handwriting Problems and <br/>
Solutions&quot;  where they discuss pencil grasp, awkward letter formations, <br/>
posture, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I do not presently see in my material, but I AM SURE I SAW <br/>
ORDERING INFORMATION AT THIS WEBSITE FOR &quot;PENCIL-GRIPPING SUPPORTS&quot;  to take <br/>
the strain off little fingers.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this provides helpful information for you or someone dipping into the <br/>
archives.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
<br/>
