<div id="ygrps-yiv-58711581">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if my first attempt went thru but here i go again....<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this site. I have been homeschooling for the past ten <br/>
months.  I am considering an unschooling approach.  I live in <br/>
Florida, but how do those of you that live in states with stricter <br/>
guidelines manage to unschool and still satisfy state requirements?  <br/>
I understand unschooling is a philosophy and not just an <br/>
instructional method.  But how do you remain unstructured and still <br/>
comply with the states that require soem homeschoolers to keep pace <br/>
with the public schools or other such policies.  Very interested in <br/>
knowing how you&#39;ve managed.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333061197">Tanya, I don&#39;t know if Maryland is considered &quot;stricter&quot; or not. Certainly, <br/>
it&#39;s not as strict as PA, but I thought it was pretty darn strict when I <br/>
moved here from New Mexico!<br/>
<br/>
My state guidelines require me to undergo a portfolio review no more than 3 <br/>
times per year. In my county, this means that I meet with a certified <br/>
teacher twice a year, once at the end of each semester. They have a form <br/>
that I fill out regarding the curriculum I offer for each subject <br/>
area.  This has been pretty easy, but my kids are still young--my oldest is <br/>
1st grade this year.  There&#39;s not a whole lot of space under each heading, <br/>
so I usually list whatever books we have, topics we&#39;ve talked about, movies <br/>
we&#39;ve seen, trips we&#39;ve taken that apply to whatever subject heading. <br/>
Sometimes I list the same thing for more than one subject if it applies in <br/>
school terms. I also take in a list of books we&#39;ve taken out of the <br/>
library, bought and read. Many schools offer online versions of their <br/>
curriculum (mine do), so it&#39;s pretty easy to just parrot that back at them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s annoying to have to meet with someone twice a year, but all in all the <br/>
portfolio system isn&#39;t too bad. It occurs after the fact, which makes it <br/>
pretty easy to say what we&#39;ve done. It presents examples of work done <br/>
rather than a total of work done, so I don&#39;t have to show that we do <br/>
anything every day (or even on a regular basis, for that matter).  My <br/>
reviews also take place face to face, which allows me to explain and expand <br/>
on lots of our activities, so my reviewer knows that we do stuff even if I <br/>
don&#39;t have worksheets to prove it. No testing is key, I have to say. I&#39;m <br/>
usually able to just ignore the whole review issue until about a week <br/>
before it actually happens; then, I just begin translating all the stuff <br/>
we&#39;ve done into terms the schools would be comfortable with, you know?  For <br/>
example, &quot;mama built (greatly expanded a dinky little one that was here <br/>
when we moved in) a really cool pond in the backyard with neat fish, frogs <br/>
and turtles&quot; will become &quot;Designed, constructed and maintained an aquatic <br/>
ecosystem capable of supporting the life cycles of numerous species, <br/>
including fish, frogs and dragon flies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have a really great reviewer, which can make all the difference. I&#39;m <br/>
probably going to continue reviewing with the county until they begin to <br/>
give me grief. Then, I have the option of joining an umbrella organization, <br/>
which still requires reviews but can have different and more relaxed <br/>
agendas, depending upon who they are. If they weren&#39;t so expensive, I might <br/>
join one sooner rather than later just to avoid the whole county review <br/>
process and the stress that goes along with it.  Although I don&#39;t stress <br/>
too much over the whole thing, I do find myself thinking in more <br/>
traditional terms whenever the thoughts of review enter my head--something <br/>
I&#39;d like to do away with entirely.<br/>

I live in NY and always considered it a &quot;strict&quot; state, but I&#39;m glad that I <br/>
don&#39;t have to meet with anyone.<br/>
<br/>
The hard part in NY is that you have to submit a plan (IHIP) before the <br/>
school year starts.  One way to do this while unschooling is to be rather vague and <br/>
state that you will be using library books.  You can also say later in your <br/>
follow up reports that you decided to do something else if your child&#39;s <br/>
interests have changed.  I do this all the time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s why I&#39;m glad about the portfolio, if one can be glad about any nasty <br/>
requirement. I&#39;d much rather do a retrospective than a proposal--ever so <br/>
much easier in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t Carol Narrigan have something like this plan online? I know I&#39;ve <br/>
read about it and seen it a couple of times.<br/>
<br/>
I will be doing my review on January 5th this year. I&#39;ll let everyone know <br/>
how it goes.<br/>

It&#39;s one of Carol Narigon&#39;s particular ones (a real one she used one year, I <br/>
mean) but it&#39;s a good model!<br/>
