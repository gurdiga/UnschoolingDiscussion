<div id="ygrps-yiv-323537038"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; BUT WHAT IS THE CORRECT TERM?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like &quot;self-directed learning.&quot; It overcomes the obstacle that <br/>
&quot;child-directed learning&quot; has, in that it sounds like permissive parenting to <br/>
many. Besides, it&#39;s not only the children that are learning!<br/>
<br/>
It sounds responsible and adequately educationese to come *closer* &lt;grin&gt; to <br/>
pleasing the in-laws. It&#39;s *for* something and not *anti* something.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, I throw my vote to &quot;self-directed learning&quot; unless I change my <br/>
mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-168426494">I like it. I still use unschooling for myself,<br/>
boyfriend, kids, etc...but when I say I&#39;m<br/>
homeschooling they ask &quot;what&quot; we are &quot;doing&quot; and then<br/>
I (I have a problem with leaving things unsaid..I<br/>
can&#39;t do it)..have to go into &quot;unschooling&quot; and trying<br/>
to explain what I mean after the look on their face<br/>
with the mention of that word. As though I&#39;m a<br/>
terrorist or something. So for those people I will now<br/>
say &quot;self-directed learning&quot;...cuz I&#39;ve run into that<br/>
problem of people automatically thinking my kids must<br/>
be spoiled brats cuz we practice &quot;child-led&quot; anything.<br/>
thanks. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738063558">One of the easiest, truest and quickest answers to &quot;outsiders&quot; is<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t go to school.<br/>
<br/>
To other homeschoolers:<br/>
<br/>
We homeschool too.<br/>
<br/>
If they ask more, THEN say unschooling.  But no sense throwing the term <br/>
around among the uninitiated.<br/>

WHO SAYS SO????
<br>Or.... Standardized tests?&nbsp; Who says that they should know this

Aren&#39;t we all individuals?&nbsp; Why as kids are we all expected to be
