<div id="ygrps-yiv-517452261">Robin, that description of why kids would smoke and why you did was brilliant <br/>
and perfect.  I&#39;m keeping it forever and showing anyone who starts to tell me <br/>
why they don&#39;t let their kids do this  or that.<br/>
<br/>
Without kids at school to tell a kid who wishes she were somewhere better <br/>
that if she smokes they&#39;ll like her better, I wonder how many smokers there <br/>
would be in the western world these days, really?<br/>
