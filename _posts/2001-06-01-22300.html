<div id="ygrps-yiv-562501963">I have considered joining the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA)<br/>
to afford myself of the legal protection should some misinformed individual<br/>
choose to involve Social Services, the School Superintendent, or some other<br/>
branch of the government with allegations against me.  This is a particular<br/>
concern of mine since I am an unschooler.  I tried to join HSLDA on-line,<br/>

that &quot;By signing the application, we agree:<br/>
1.  To exercise diligence in teaching our children in a responsible way.<br/>
2. To use an organized curriculum and a clearly recognizable program of<br/>
education to instruct our children.<br/>

Have any of you joined HSLDA?  If so, how do you in good conscience both<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-967191068">HSLDA has a long and checkered past within the homeschooling community. You<br/>
will want to read a great deal before you sign anything.  I know of one<br/>
unschooler they refused outright, and returned her application fee.  She&#39;s<br/>
on this list, but I&#39;m not sure if she&#39;s reading carefully just now.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link you should start with <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.expage.com/page/folchslda">http://www.expage.com/page/folchslda</a><br/>
<br/>
Those new to unschooling usually feel they need to be &quot;protected&quot; from the<br/>
school board and social services, and I do understand the worries. I have an<br/>
ex husband that kept me in court for 18 months. But given this experience,<br/>
along with unschooling for 12 years, I believe paid protection is not in our<br/>
best interest.  Empowerment,  working to stand our own ground serves us much<br/>
better.  Knowing your state law and making conscious decisions on how to<br/>
comply or not usually is all you truly need.  While there are a few pockets<br/>
of tension and a few states with really onerous laws, for the most part<br/>
homeschooling is now mainstream, with no one giving it a second glance.<br/>
<br/>
Have you had specific problems where you are?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963046661">In essence, it means to use one of their approved curriculums (Bob Jones, <br/>
Abeka, Sonlight, etc.), keep daily records and attendance, test often and <br/>
keep the same schedules as your local schools as far as holidays and time <br/>
spent in class.  It is not worth it, imo.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t -- but that&#39;s me.  Where do you live that you are afraid of the <br/>
authorities checking on you like this?<br/>
I think it means just what it says -- which sure isn&#39;t my version of hsing.<br/>
<br/>
I have read all sorts of things about HSLDA -- some hsers support them and <br/>
some hsers hate them.  And much emotion gets brought into the discussion <br/>
which clouds, imo, any ability for a new hser to decide if this sort of thing <br/>
would be a benefit or not in their own personal situation.<br/>
<br/>
I think you have to do a lot of research about your state, the laws/regs, how <br/>
they are actually enforced, talk to hsing support groups and other individual <br/>
hsers in your area, read about HSLDA practices, take everything related to <br/>
this topic with a huge grain of salt, and decide for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  I know many people struggle with this question.<br/>

Some people have unschooled and signed.  I guess they don&#39;t have a good <br/>
conscience.<br/>
They mean a storebought school-style curriculum which you lead your kids <br/>
through school-style.  <br/>

education since that is what you are professing to be doing.  If you are<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, this motive is up for debate.  If you take a look at their<br/>
personal and coporate record you&#39;ll find a great deal that belies this<br/>
assumption.<br/>
<br/>
If you do not have the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Weeeeellllllllll, you know a very long time ago, all of say 20 years ago,<br/>
there weren&#39;t any homeschooling laws to comply with.  If it weren&#39;t for the<br/>
foks who agreed to break the law in the first place, you wouldn&#39;t have a<br/>
homeschooling movement.  For us to now say that the only real way to do this<br/>
is to make sure you please the master......welllll, it&#39;s a bit short sighted<br/>
if you ask me.<br/>
<br/>
Besides that, in my state I don&#39;t show the state __anything__.  I don&#39;t<br/>
prove myself in any way to any one else.  And if my law weren&#39;t written that<br/>
way,  I&#39;d be a lawbreaker.  ;)  I don&#39;t owe Ceaser my children, nor their<br/>
minds.<br/>
<br/>
HSLDA could have been a great proponent of grass roots activism and<br/>
responsibility. Unfortuately it&#39;s become a puppet of the government it says<br/>
it will protect us from.<br/>

Not that I have an opinion or anything. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

regard to unschooling.  Mike Farris has made no secret of his belief that<br/>
unschoolers can be neglectful and that it would be hard to prove anything in<br/>
court.   HSLDA has returned the application fee of one person that we know<br/>
of when they used the word unschooler on their application.<br/>
<br/>
In Feb of this year they redesigned their website and removed a great many<br/>
of the statements that could be contsrued to not support unschooling.  It&#39;s<br/>
a guess that with the new book out called Christian Unschooling and the<br/>
growth of Christian unschooling websites, their blatant and vocal diresion<br/>
in regard to us has been toned down.<br/>
<br/>
Please read all the information out there though, because their stance on<br/>
unschooling is really the least of the problems I have with the<br/>
organization.<br/>
<br/>
  I guess HSLDA doesn&#39;t want to get stuck<br/>

realize they probably weren&#39;t talking about me.  You know, the HSLDA just <br/>
isn&#39;t pounding my door down to join.  Guess they have enough atheist <br/>

I think that&#39;s why they clarified that, so they couldn&#39;t be accused of taking <br/>
someone&#39;s money and not then providing the services.  The application didn&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
They&#39;re proving that homeschooling is legal.  That&#39;s easy.<br/>
<br/>
The amount of record keeping that goes on in public schools is very VERY <br/>
light.  If asked, they would show the textbook, without showing which parts <br/>
they skipped or never got to.  Or they would show the teacher&#39;s lesson plan <br/>
book; ditto.  Mine used to go blank for weeks, and I was never in trouble.  <br/>
When I quit they were asking me to be head of the department the following <br/>
year.  I was 26.  <br/>
<br/>
A slow-seeming, confused family with a curriculum (just as a lost-seeming <br/>
teacher with a great lesson plan book) can be seen as more suspect than a <br/>
quick, zippy, active, smiling family without a written record in the world.<br/>
<br/>
-=-As a parent you are legally bound by your state laws to provide proof<br/>

<br/>
This depends on the state.  <br/>
<br/>
I do agree we should be careful not to antagonize the neighbors or to appear <br/>
nutso.  But frightening other homeschoolers to believe that any minute the <br/>
government will swoop in is unnecessary, and it is the kind of tactic HSLDA <br/>
depends on.<br/>

<br/>
First, I&#39;m not sure what &quot;proof of education&quot; means in this context. In any <br/>
case, state laws vary extremely. In both states we&#39;ve homeschooled in we are <br/>
considered to be private schools. In neither was a private school required to <br/>
provide &quot;proof of education&quot; for their students. One required us to keep <br/>
attendance records, instructor qualifications, and brief overview of courses <br/>
of study offered. The other requires a private school to keep immunization <br/>
records and proof of required physicals. These aren&#39;t the only examples. <br/>
