About posting to the group:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningPOSTS">http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningPOSTS</a><br/>
<br/>
This group has been operating since late 2001, and I want to keep it solid and good.  That requires, readable posts, carefully composed.<br/>
<br/>
I edited two to remove the long (very long) original post.  <br/>
I edited one because the three-paragraph quote wasn’t sufficiently marked as different from the new comments.<br/>
“Pointy brackets,” the less-than/greater-than marks, sometimes don’t go through, as some mail reader somewhere will think they’re html code, so use something like ***that*** or -=-this-=- because it will stick.<br/>
<br/>
Put spaces between paragraphs, please.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t “be supportive.”  Don’t tell people they’re great moms or that they’re doing the best they can.  You don’t know that, and I don’t want to provide a forum for people to soothe those who should be doing better.  <br/>
How bad can that be?  Pretty bad.<br/>
<br/>
Only read 2/3 of this page if you’re in a sensitive mood—and note all those bad examples (which seemed sweet and supportive).<br/>
