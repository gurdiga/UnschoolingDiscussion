&gt; trying to get over my fear of letting them do whatever they want! You&#39;re<br/>
&gt; right about the worst stuff being on at night ( and I hate to say I got<br/>
&gt; addicted to American Idol), I guess the point is to get them out of the<br/>
&gt; house and into the world, doing &quot;stuff&quot;, playing etc. etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t feel bad, we&#39;ve been watching American Idol since the first episode!<br/>
Well! Survivor wasn&#39;t on so we needed *something* to help us through this<br/>
summer. ;-)<br/>
BTW, we all picked Kelly Clarkson to win and we were all glad she did.<br/>
There&#39;s worse things to watch on TV than a singing competition - I thought<br/>
the show was okay.<br/>
