<div id="ygrps-yiv-986843981">Earlier today my husband asked me to PLEASE take care of the books in the &quot;homeschool corner&quot; of the dining room. We have only a small bookshelf, so there were many other books and &quot;school stuff&quot; piled on top, and I&#39;ll admit it was a rather precarious mess. <br/>
 <br/>
As I was sorting through trying to decide what to keep, what to toss, what to take to the Treasure Chest (at the local dump, a place to put things in decent condition rather than just trash them, all things are free-first come, first served) it hit me...why am I holding on to half the books we have? Some of them were purchased as part of the Sonlight curriculum, and they are good books. Some were purchased because they are classic children&#39;s stories, but most were second-hand. And they pretty much just sit on the shelf. There are a few favorites the Littles like to hear over and over and some that Sarah can read on her own. Most of what she can read on her own are kept in her room. <br/>
 <br/>
My husband wants me to limit the amount of books we keep because of moving every so often and being restricted in weight to what the military will pay to move. One of his sort spots are these books. He&#39;s not a reader, by the way. He&#39;d love the books to be more neatly confined, but keeps saying we don&#39;t have space for another bookcase whenever I bring up purchasing one..even another small one that this one could rest on top of or something. Oh, and there are other books crammed onto the shelf of Sarah&#39;s room as well. Mostly books for when the kids are older...classic literature mostly like Tom Sawyer, Jane Eyre.<br/>
 <br/>
Most of these books I&#39;m sure can be found at the library. A couple do have very sentimental value as they were mine when I was a child, but other than the cost of the books from Sonlight...do I really need to hold on to them? Especially when we often go to the library? <br/>
 <br/>
I have these books because I think maybe the children will want to read them sometime...but there is the possibility they may never have much interest in them. Sarah struggles with reading right now and has never really been all that interested in being read to. Logan has a few books that he likes, but like Sarah has other things to do. Megan however does really love to be read to, and often brings me books to read to her. <br/>
 <br/>
Would you keep so many of these books or would you pass them on in favor of letting the children just keep using the library for their OWN tastes? I suppose I hope that by having the books available they will be read...<br/>
 <br/>
Paul constantly says there will be plenty of time for a family library when he retires from the Coast Guard (another 10 years) and we have our own house and won&#39;t be moving so much. I can truly see and understand his point. Should I just hold on to the most special books? <br/>

<br/>
I like to buy books from half.com.  A few months after you buy a book <br/>
from them, they send you an email.  &quot;Want 5.00?  Re-sell this book&quot; <br/>
and they give you the title of a book you bought from them.  So if <br/>
you wanted to have a book to read for longer than you could keep it <br/>
out at the library (or if you can&#39;t find a book at the library which <br/>
is sometimes the case), you could just buy used and then re-sell <br/>
used.  <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a book you have because someonen LOVES it, then I&#39;d keep it.  <br/>
But if it&#39;s a book you have that is there just because you have guilt <br/>
somewhere that it&#39;s something that you &quot;should&quot; have, then I&#39;d get <br/>
rid of it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-31378319">Normally I wouldn&#39;t suggest for people to get rid of books just because<br/>
there isn&#39;t any interest in them now. Later on there could be interest and<br/>
then again maybe not. But they are there just in case. In your case, it<br/>
sounds like there are other circumstances involved. I can understand the<br/>
whole idea of moving and weight and all. Plus if a lot of the books are from<br/>
past &quot;home schooling&quot; it doesn&#39;t sound like there were picked with the kids<br/>
interest in mind. So I wouldn&#39;t feel bad about keeping them. If guilt gets<br/>
you, myabe put them on E bay and make some extra money. If it&#39;s no big deal,<br/>
donate them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe when you go through all those books you will find you have more to<br/>
give away then you thought. In that case, maybe you could add some new ones<br/>
that still wouldn&#39;t take up as much room. Ones the kids can go and pick out<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else mentioned half.com and about reselling books. Sounds like a<br/>
great deal for someone in your situation. And there&#39;s always the library no<br/>
matter where you are. Tons of interesting and new stuff always there!!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t sweat it, dump the schooly stuff and let the kids enjoy the ones they<br/>
like, no matter what books they are. My kids still really enjoy the small<br/>
little kid books as well as older books. I haven&#39;t gotten rid of any baby<br/>
books no matter how silly them seem. My kids love them all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-572377268">Thanks! I think I will go through the Sonlight books and look into <br/>
reselling them. We haven&#39;t touched many of them, and I doubt we will. <br/>
Even I&#39;M not interested in reading them to the kids...not that they <br/>
aren&#39;t probably WONDERFUL books...I&#39;m sure they are. It&#39;s just that <br/>
well, we&#39;re busy with other things really.<br/>
<br/>
That would certainly open up room for other books that I know we <br/>
really DO want (like a collection of Magic Schoolbus that Sarah has <br/>
started, and Curious George for Megan). <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the thoughts on this! <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
       Is this from the same person whose husband is pushing for more <br/>
academics?<br/>
<br/>
       Then he&#39;s handed you an opportunity here. Don&#39;t tell him about <br/>
unschooling; show him what it means to &quot;own&quot; books. It&#39;s not what sits on the shelf. <br/>
Show him how those Sonlight schoolbooks never belonged to your children, and <br/>
how they keep finding real books they do love, for their own reasons, and &quot;own&quot; <br/>
them for life whether you &quot;buy&quot; them or not. <br/>
<br/>
       Show him in concrete terms how much precious space the schoolbooks <br/>
take up on your single bookshelf and in your lives -- what they cost to buy and <br/>
how much they cost to keep in terms of weight limit, without actually <br/>
benefiting anyone in your family (including him.) <br/>
<br/>
       Could you get him to see this bookshelf as a metaphor for his child&#39;s <br/>
mind and spirit?  Being limited to only one bookshelf is like a forced-choice <br/>
standardized test where any answer you choose forces all the others out. The <br/>
lost-opportunity cost is easy to see -- you can pile on pseudo-academic texts <br/>
and workbooks from various stranger-experts until the child&#39;s shelf is groaning <br/>
under the burden, but doing this  crowds out her own discoveries and <br/>
delights. <br/>
<br/>
       Which makes it LESS likely she&#39;ll ever become a true academic, btw.<br/>
<br/>
       Then you might ask him to notice all the shelf space at public <br/>
libraries. With thousands of shelves, how much space do the professionals dedicate to <br/>
textbook-type material? (Next to none, if your library is anything like mine) <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
       So whether you have just one shelf or a million, textbooks are <br/>
inferior product. Real academics read real books. Because they want to.<br/>
<br/>
       Unschoolers get well attuned to sniffing out that &quot;teachable moment&quot; <br/>
when it presents itself, and this could be one for you. I wonder if you might <br/>
not have a chance here to convert your husband into a zealous unschooler. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

<br/>
There is a big, very popular used book store here which has a sign right on <br/>
the door: &quot;We do not accept textbooks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That dad/husband should be asked, too, how many of his textbooks he has saved.<br/>
My husband has a boxful.<br/>
Then ask him (if he has any) how many he has used in the past year or two or <br/>
five.<br/>
<br/>
I still have my Chaucer and Shakespeare books from college, and a few others. <br/>
 They&#39;re &quot;complete works of&quot; books, though, so besides the intro material and <br/>
notations, they&#39;re not &quot;textbooks.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-224978075">JJ, <br/>
<br/>
Actually I did just have another talk with Paul (and yes, I&#39;m the one whose husband was just pushing for more academics). Told him how much &quot;academic&quot; stuff was done today through play. He liked that idea. Told him also that I was going to get rid of the books, try to recover at least part of the cost of the Sonlight books because all things considered I&#39;d rather keep just the books that are special and will actually be read, and he agreed. <br/>
<br/>
We had another talk about unschooling, while I didn&#39;t call it that, and again he agrees with it. He just wants to be sure that she&#39;s learning what she needs to. So he wants me to keep him apprised of her &quot;academic progress&quot; because &quot;she still needs to learn.&quot; I said &quot;Well, learn exactly what?&quot; &quot;Whatever she needs to.&quot; I laughed and said, ok, then we&#39;re in agreement. She&#39;ll learn what she needs to learn. He definitely agrees that her learning things should not be what it&#39;s been, with fights and hurt feelings and bad attitudes; but rather what it&#39;s been lately, fun and exciting and easy for her.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your thoughts!<br/>

&gt; said, ok, then we&#39;re in agreement. She&#39;ll learn what she needs to learn.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>       That&#39;s good to hear!<br/>
<br/>
       Btw, my DH uses this exact same phrasing. He will often start a <br/>
conversation with me about one of the children by saying, &quot;He needs to ...&quot; or &quot;she <br/>
needs to ...&quot;  followed by whatever  he thinks is ahead next in their <br/>
development. <br/>
<br/>
       Though it still jars me to hear, I&#39;ve gradually realized he doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean it as criticism or an assignment, for either them or me. It&#39;s more like his <br/>
way of showing he&#39;s paying attention and checking to see if he&#39;s noticing the <br/>
right things. <br/>
<br/>
       It&#39;s almost as if he trusts me enough to listen to him talking out <br/>
loud to himself and to be the voice in his head that he can count on to answer <br/>
reassuringly. Something like that.   JJ<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-842266771">By the way, I meant to say that what you wrote was a great analogy of <br/>
the situation, and I think it would work if I had needed to use it! <br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;ll relax again a little more once DSS is out of our lives. <br/>
It&#39;s so hard for both of us right now with that hanging over our <br/>
heads. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad though that his parents, while they don&#39;t necessarily <br/>
agree with our decision to homeschool, let alone unschool; they are <br/>
at least supportive of our endeavour.<br/>
