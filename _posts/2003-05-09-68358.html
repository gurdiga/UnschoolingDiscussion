 </span></blockquote>I have a 15 year old girl, one of the best people I know: strong, <br/>
confident, not afraid to speak her mind. And...someone mentioned <br/>
holding hands in public. We have that. Arms around each others&#39; <br/>
shoulders or holding hands. Goofing off like girlfriends at the <br/>
store, or wherever. And Abbie isn&#39;t afraid to tell me, when she <br/>
thinks I need to do differently. I greatly admire her forthrightness <br/>
and ability to speak up, being a bit of a weinie my own self, in <br/>
those areas. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve homeschooled her since right around her 7th b-day, &quot;relaxed <br/>
homeschooling&quot; for the whole time, going more towards unschooling <br/>
now, having watched her follow her own path into some very cool <br/>
things. I must say, academically we&#39;ve been relaxed, but we have a <br/>
pretty firm set of family rules that we enforce consistently...and <br/>
Abbie hasn&#39;t shown any rebellion. Neither have my other kids, <br/>
younger. <br/>
<br/>
It was Jason, my oldest and from a first marriage, and my hubby <br/>
wanted to step in and put rules on him the day after the wedding. <br/>
Jason rebelled big time, but I think it was the fact that the <br/>
relationship was damaged and not given healing time before Da Rules <br/>
came down. He also was never homeschooled.<br/>

Once again, I think it has to do with building relationship.</div>

<br/>
It&#39;s possible-to-likely that people whose kids have been in school a long <br/>
time will never have the calm and clarity that always-unschooled kids can <br/>
have.  But there are other factors, certainly.  Genetics, parental patience <br/>
(and calm and clarity), step situations, trauma, grief...<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea that someone would discount me for my kids being too old (if <br/>
that&#39;s what it was; might not have been).  The first two years I was online, <br/>
people would occasionally say &quot;Pay no attention to her, her oldest kid is <br/>
only seven&quot; (or however old he was at the moment, when someone wanted to <br/>
discount what I was saying, and it was probably the same person or two saying <br/>
it in different situations, but I wasn&#39;t paying attention to that).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I wonder about those things as well. My youngest is so very <br/>
different from his teen sister, and it will be interesteing to see <br/>
how it goes when he is a teen. But I do believe that always being <br/>
unschooled will have a huge impact on him as it has his sister. <br/>
Interestingly, she has chosen to go to a free school this year for <br/>
three days a week. At first, she was really interested in the classes <br/>
but has now pretty much chosen to go there to hang out mostly, and <br/>
play music. . .her guitar teacher is there a couple of those days and <br/>
they have performance workshops. She comes and goes as she wishes, <br/>
attends classes or not depending on what she wants to do. I guess we <br/>
are really fortunate to have this place . . . it was started by a <br/>
group of homeschoolers over 25 years ago and has evolved into a <br/>
school, albeit a free choice one. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I know that there can be a lot of factors in the teenage <br/>
thing, but I believe that unschooling gives us a real solid <br/>
foundation to stand on.<br/>
<br/>
