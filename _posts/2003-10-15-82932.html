I am deeply offended by the biased and bigoted piece CBS Eye on America <br/>
ran on Tuesday implying that homeschooling parents are likely to abuse <br/>
their children and should be supervised.  (Homescholing Nightmares) <br/>
Stirring up fear and suspicion of people who are different is an easy <br/>
way to rouse a mob.  That&#39;s a power the media should use cautiously. <br/>
Stigmatizing and distrusting an entire group based on a few sensational <br/>
acts is cheap and unfair.  I expected better from CBS.<br/>
<br/>
You may be surprised at the outcry from homeschoolers, but if you had <br/>
run such a piece about any ethnic group or about the crimes of <br/>
left-handed redheads, the redheaded anti-defamation league would be all <br/>
over you, and rightly so.  Be responsible journalists and use meaningful <br/>
statistics; don&#39;t make up trends from blips.<br/>
<br/>
The notion that putting children in classrooms could eliminate abuse is <br/>
simplistic and wrong.  If you sincerely wish to save children from abuse <br/>
then devote more air time to the serious issues of mental illness, <br/>
poverty and substance abuse.  These are the strongest factors leading to <br/>
child abuse and neglect in this country.  Let&#39;s put our efforts into <br/>

<br/>
Government supervision is expensive, intrusive and not very effective. <br/>
Do you think television journalism would be improved if journalists were <br/>
required to register with the government and subjected to periodic <br/>
government inspection?  I don&#39;t.  But I do think your editorial policies <br/>
are too weak and should be improved.  Your pieces on &quot;The Dark Side of <br/>
Homeschooling&quot; have been shoddy, sensationaistic, and shallow.  I can&#39;t <br/>

worthless garbage.  I will avoid all of your news shows in the future.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324059643">hi there - <br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m relatively new to this list - trying to observe the two week <br/>
observe guideline, and i think i&#39;m close!<br/>
<br/>
first of all, i wanted to say i really like your letter betsy. <br/>
<br/>
secondly, just a brief intro - i am very new to this whole concept, <br/>
exploring it as an option for my ds who is 3. i had bad personal <br/>
experiences with public school and personally find the freedom of <br/>
unschooling very appealing. neither dh nor i have any experience <br/>
with homeschoolers or unschoolers at all so i feel like i&#39;m treading <br/>
new waters. <br/>
<br/>
finally, i would like to ask how many of you are feeling after the <br/>
cbs story - not so much about the story, but are you concerned that <br/>
there might be a movement to increase state oversight / intrusion <br/>
into homschooling? do you worry about having to appear more normal <br/>
than other families, i.e., keeping any and all dirty laundry <br/>
completely out of the public eye, in order to protect yourselves? am <br/>
i completely nuts? i don&#39;t even know if these are rational concerns, <br/>
i just know that every time people say to me, &#39;oh, is your son in <br/>
preschool?&#39; and clearly expect me to answer with the name of the <br/>
school and i respond with &#39;no, actually, we&#39;re contemplating <br/>
homeschool,&#39; i get one of a limited number of responses. <br/>
usually, &#39;you&#39;r crazy!&#39; &#39;why? we have such great schools here!&#39; <br/>
or &#39;oh&#39; with a look that says, how do i end my conversation with <br/>
this freak of nature? <br/>
<br/>
anyway, feeling like i&#39;m treading uncharted waters and interested in <br/>
how the water feels after these stories.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
I have been thinking about this, and I am a little worried, I guess.  We live <br/>
in a tiny, very PRO public school town, we&#39;re not from around here <br/>
originally, and we moved to WV from California!!  To top the whole thing off, we have <br/>
adopted a boy we are now homeschooling, and just took him out of school this <br/>
year.  Plus, right when this story &quot;breaks&quot; Michael has a big black eye/bruise, a <br/>
result of being kneed while playing football with all the kids (well, not <br/>
kneed....he grabbed a bigger kid around the knees and held on and got a knee in <br/>
his face as a result.  It was truly an accident!)....argh!!  Lets see...what <br/>
else can I do to throw up MORE red flags????...<br/>
<br/>
So what do we do now?  Stop allowing wrestling, football, bike jumps/ramps, <br/>
tree climbing, horseplay?  With 5 boys in the house now that&#39;s like trying to <br/>
hold the ocean back with a broom.  How sad we may have to think like this now.<br/>
<br/>
We are NOT isolated, however.  We DO live out in the boonies, but 3 of the <br/>
kids (foster) are in school still, we are involved in 4H, we go to town a lot <br/>
(including Michael) and we are not religious zealots.  We probably look more <br/>
like hippy zealots or hillbilly zealots :o)<br/>
<br/>
I guess we&#39;ll see...it&#39;s kind of early to see if there will be a backlash at <br/>
homeschoolers because of this show.  I guess it depends on who watched it.  We <br/>
are in the middle of Travis and Justin&#39;s adoption as I write this, so I&#39;m <br/>
probably the most worried it will affect that.  (Then again, we have caseworkers <br/>
at our house at LEAST monthly for our foster care agency, and they are welcome <br/>
to come over anytime, so if they didn&#39;t like something they saw it probably <br/>
would have been a long time ago.)<br/>
<br/>
.......sigh.......don&#39;t really need this crap right now.........<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m feeling a bit better about this whole thing, today. It was very <br/>
very depressing to me because I&#39;ve worked extremely hard for the <br/>
National Home Education Network for the past five years - hours upon <br/>
hours day after day - and a huge part of our work has been to promote a <br/>
positive accurate understanding of homeschooling to the general public. <br/>
We&#39;d been congratulating ourselves because we felt we&#39;d been successful <br/>
beyond what we&#39;d even hoped - 5 years ago every news article about <br/>
homeschooling was a near-carbon copy of every other article. They all <br/>
had pictures of mom and kids at a kitchen table - they always talked as <br/>
if all homeschoolers were fundamentalist Christians - doing school at <br/>
home, etc. We got that changed in a big way - to the point that most <br/>
articles out there these days talk about homeschoolers as wide-ranging <br/>
diverse families - doing all kinds of interesting things in all kinds <br/>
of family structures and from all walks of life, individualizing their <br/>
kids&#39; education, NOT taking traditional school methods into the home, <br/>
etc. News reporters no longer feel the obligation to have a requisite <br/>
NEA comment or some Harvard so-called expert to say he worries about <br/>
homeschoolers socialization - up until a few years ago EVERY media <br/>
mention of homeschooling involved those.<br/>
<br/>
So - we&#39;ve been patting ourselves on our backs - until this week, when <br/>
we were crushed and felt like all our work for the past years was <br/>
wasted effort - that CBS news had just undone it all - in 5 minutes <br/>
worth of unbelievably bad journalism.<br/>
<br/>
But - last night I went to a big meeting - 4H club people. Of the group <br/>
- probably 6 kids are homeschoolers and maybe 35 are not.  I thought <br/>
about how most people know some homeschoolers, these days. Plus, our <br/>
national PR efforts HAVE helped to create a baseline of understanding <br/>
and appreciation of homeschooling in the public&#39;s eyes and we may be <br/>
underestimating people&#39;s ability to recognize bunk for what it is. So, <br/>
it occurred to me that the smear tactics used by CBS may  be more <br/>
damaging to CBS&#39;s credibility than to homeschooling.<br/>

Yes!!  I was thinking the same thing and asking folks in our church and neighborhood, not necessarily home/unschoolers to write and call also. Parents in general so they are hearing from more folks than homeschoolers.<br/>

I hear you.  And I see a good news / bad news situation.  I think NHEN <br/>
has been very successful in convincing the media and the world at large <br/>
that homeschooled kids aren&#39;t wacky and aren&#39;t being warped by their <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-175217745">&lt;&lt;The notion that putting children in classrooms could eliminate abuse<br/>
is <br/>
simplistic and wrong.  If you sincerely wish to save children from abuse<br/>
<br/>
then devote more air time to the serious issues of mental illness, <br/>
poverty and substance abuse.  These are the strongest factors leading to<br/>
<br/>
child abuse and neglect in this country.  Let&#39;s put our efforts into <br/>
fixing what we know is broken.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I particularly like this paragraph because it presents an alternative<br/>
course of action that takes the point away from homeschooling, rather<br/>
than only defending homeschooling. <br/>
<br/>
The people at CBS aren&#39;t listening to defenses of homeschooling.<br/>
Evidently the CBS researchers had already received plenty of information<br/>
about homeschooling, including deciding not to interview on camera a<br/>
speaker from HSLDA. As little as I like much of their policies, it would<br/>
seem that they are a group that is known by the public. Having an<br/>
opposing view (in the news item) presented by one of them would have<br/>
given it much more authority, which is clearly why they were not<br/>
invited. As it is I don&#39;t know who Hal Young is, and he is presented as<br/>
a &quot;Homeschooling Advocate&quot; of no particular affiliation. It is easier<br/>
for members of the viewing public to dismiss him as some kind of<br/>
individualistic crackpot without the authority of any kind of<br/>
organization behind him. <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that it is not going to matter outside of a courtroom, except<br/>
to us, that these abusers were not &quot;technically&quot; or &quot;legally&quot;<br/>
homeschooling, or that some of the kids were below school age. These are<br/>
distinctions that we make to ourselves, that could sound to those<br/>
outside of homeschooling like back-pedaling excuse-making. Pointing out<br/>
that these people will look for ways to stay outside the law and be as<br/>
invisible as possible might be a good strategy for fighting state<br/>
regulations. However I&#39;m not sure that it is a good argument to enhance<br/>
the public perception of homeschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m starting to think that best way to do that is to continue to be out<br/>
in the community, a goal not always compatible with the climate of<br/>
disapproval and suspicion (eg daytime curfews) that this news item is<br/>
likely to promote. On the other hand, I feel like *my* neighbors, who<br/>
know Jayn and see her around and talk to her, are pretty unlikely to<br/>
suspect abuse in our family just because we are homeschooling. Being<br/>
part of a group and regular activities is self-defense. I guess the only<br/>
way we can really counter this kind of scare-mongering is to be visible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I know that being visible is no guarantee that abuse<br/>
is not happening. There was mention of visible bruising or marks being a<br/>
reason for absenteeism from school, but a determined abuser can find<br/>
ways to do so without outward signs. The most disturbing part to me of<br/>
that news item was about the Spelling Bee competitor and her horrible<br/>
father. <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the timing of the items has anything to do with the pending<br/>
Federal Bill about Non-Discrimination against Homeschoolers. I don&#39;t<br/>
know.<br/>

Outside of homeschooling circles, I have not heard a single mention of the report.  Either the people I know didn&#39;t watch it, or they didn&#39;t find it worth comment, at least not to me.  There hasn&#39;t been anything in my local newspaper about it, even though they are doing a series on domestic violence.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-352478970">Somebody on another list asked about what an unschooling day was like, <br/>
especially with high school age kids. Wanted to know what unschooling <br/>
kids do to &quot;learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I thought I&#39;d send my responses here, too. We have a lot of new <br/>
listmembers in the last few weeks - many might be lurking and trying to <br/>
understand unschooling. Hope this helps. Some of it is from this list&#39;s <br/>
description, by the way.<br/>
<br/>
*************************<br/>
It is nearly impossible to give you a typical day. Every family/kid/day<br/>
is different. Unschoolers have to be defined mostly by what they don&#39;t<br/>
do - and that is why it is so hard to &quot;get it.&quot; We don&#39;t make lesson<br/>
plans for our kids. We don&#39;t test or grade them. They don&#39;t have<br/>
assignments and we are not their teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not really a homeschool teaching method. It refers to a<br/>
philosophy of natural learning as well as the lifestyle that results<br/>
from living according to the principles of that philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
   The most basic principle of unschooling is that children are born with<br/>
an intrinsic urge to explore -- for a moment or a lifetime -- what<br/>
intrigues them, as they seek to join the adult world in a personally<br/>
satisfying way. Because of that urge, an unschooling child is free to<br/>
choose the what, when, where and how of his/her own learning from mud<br/>
puddles to video games and SpongeBob Squarepants to Shakespeare! And an<br/>
unschooling parent sees his/her role, not as a teacher, but as a<br/>
facilitator and companion in a child&#39;s exploration of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Teenage unschoolers often have developed some serious passions and they<br/>
pursue them with great energy. They may be anything from website design<br/>
to ballet to breeding dogs to political action to anything else you can<br/>
imagine.  Others, however, don&#39;t have one overriding interest, but<br/>
spend their time sampling all kinds of things - moving from one to<br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
What do the parents do? Transportation, help finding resources,<br/>
transportation, listening, buying supplies, transportation, listening,<br/>
make some phone calls to help find resources, discuss, listen,<br/>
transport.<br/>
<br/>
The kids pursue their interests and the learning comes about naturally<br/>
as part of them living their lives. Everything is connected. Subjects<br/>
are not learned as separate topics but in the context of what the kids<br/>
choose to do with their time. Its amazing - but it works, because<br/>
everything really IS connected and, in a rich and stimulating learning<br/>
environment kids&#39; natural urge to absorb information and skills is<br/>
never limited or pushed down and they keep that same eager voracious<br/>
desire to learn that all kids have before they go to school.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd has collected people&#39;s descriptions of their &quot;unschooling<br/>
days&quot; on her website at &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a>&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-159398544">That person also was worried about kids wanting to spend the whole day <br/>
online or playing video games instead of something more constructive.<br/>
<br/>
************<br/>
<br/>
My kids have spent whole days playing video games or online. Sometimes<br/>
for a week at a time when a game is new. Friends come over and play<br/>
too. They trade video games around with friends. They read the cheats<br/>
online or order books (I cannot even count how many kids I know who<br/>
have learned to read this way).<br/>
<br/>
Okay - I MYSELF have spend days playing video games or online.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the problem again? &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I saw a problem - if there was depression involved and it was being<br/>
used as an escape, for example, I&#39;d think about that and not about the<br/>
symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, I&#39;d simply get us out of the house a bit by finding things<br/>
to do that would interest my kid. We&#39;d go to a science museum or the<br/>
beach or the bookstore or library or go to the toy store and buy a new<br/>
game or the art supply or craft store or hobby shop and buy a model to<br/>
work on or I might find a workshop of some kind offered by the city<br/>
recreation department or a dance class or go to Home Depot on a<br/>
Saturday when they do their free workshops or to Joanne&#39;s Fabrics for a<br/>
free knitting class or on and on...<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;d also wonder whether you might be overstating things - or<br/>
worrying in advance about something hypothetical. Kids can put a lot of<br/>
time into video games and still have a lot of time left for other<br/>
things. If you&#39;re interested in the positives of video games - see<br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s pages that started based on a presentation at the HSC<br/>
conference a couple of years ago:<br/>
   &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/games/page">http://sandradodd.com/games/page</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Things my kids have done online have been overwhelmingly positive. For<br/>
example, they play games on Neopets - these games are great - lots and<br/>
lots of visual development spatial games, lots of<br/>
word/vocabulary/spelling games, and especially lots of math concept<br/>
games. Neopets involves earning money and even calculating interest and<br/>
so on. Its great. They also play MUDS and MUSHES - these are online<br/>
role-playing games and can be very very elaborate. Roxana has been<br/>
involved with Pern Mush for years - this is &quot;serious play.&quot;  I cannot<br/>
imagine anything being better for developing writing skills than online<br/>
roleplaying games. She also writes fan fiction - and lots of other<br/>
stuff - including poetry. She puts it up on various fan fiction and<br/>
poetry sites where others read and critique it. She creates websites<br/>
and participates in &quot;site wars&quot; where people score each other&#39;s sites<br/>
on content quality, organization and design elements.<br/>
<br/>
The kids have spent many many hours playing SIMS. This is the source of<br/>
all kinds of reflections on behavior and economics and life - for my<br/>
kids it has branched out into interest in interior design and in<br/>
architecture as well as a lot of discussion about people&#39;s behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
They subscribe to interesting email lists - where they get a &quot;word a<br/>
day&quot; for example - some kind of interesting vocabulary. Roxana studied<br/>
Norwegian for about a year - receiving a short email lesson each day.<br/>
<br/>
Lately Roxana&#39;s role-playing passions (online and in theater) have<br/>
meshed with a college course in costume design. She specializes,<br/>
online, in writing &quot;descs&quot; (descriptions of characters). She writes and<br/>
sells her descs to other players - who give her role playing items in<br/>
return. To improve her &quot;descs&quot; she started looking at costume design<br/>
sites and museum sites to find paintings of people from different<br/>
places and times. She has learned an AMAZING amount of history and<br/>
geography through this interest.<br/>
<br/>
This is just one direction that the online playing has led. But it<br/>
gives you the idea that if you support the kids interests and are<br/>
patient - don&#39;t see their current interests as a waste of time, see<br/>
them as the launching pad for the future that will go in ways you<br/>
probably can&#39;t foresee - that if they have support and parents that<br/>
won&#39;t pooh-pooh their interests - they&#39;ll move on to bigger and better<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
In a contest, for example, between a kid who&#39;d studied ancient history<br/>
through text books versus my daughter, who learned it through costume,<br/>
literature, drama, etc., I&#39;d place my money on my daughter to know more<br/>
and have a more complete picture. AND, what&#39;s more, she loves it -<br/>
finds it endlessly fascinating. She just told me the other day that she<br/>
thinks she&#39;d like to major in history in college. She&#39;s just turned 16,<br/>
by the way. She started out at the community college taking computer<br/>
programming classes in order to be able to jazz up her websites. She<br/>
branched out to music and theater classes - took a &quot;History of Opera&quot;<br/>
course (again - she loves putting the operas into the context of their<br/>
time and place - learned a LOT of history in that class that went far<br/>
beyond opera).<br/>
<br/>
Your child probably isn&#39;t interested in opera, so you&#39;re thinking mine<br/>
is &quot;different&quot; and that this doesn&#39;t answer your questions - doesn&#39;t<br/>
ease your mind when you see your child on the computer for hour after<br/>
hour. But I could write similar things about many other teenagers I<br/>
know - but their paths would all go off in vastly different directions.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is that unschooling is sort of &quot;messy&quot; in that there<br/>
isn&#39;t a &quot;plan&quot; and kids can often go in one direction for a while and<br/>
then seem to come to a dead end and turn around and go off in another<br/>
direction. It isn&#39;t like a kid who studies certain high school subjects<br/>
- a couple of years of science, four years of English, a year of<br/>
American History, and so on --- and then goes on to sort of do that<br/>
same thing in college - follow a predetermined path. Unschooled kids<br/>
often &quot;meander&quot; in their lives. They proceed in fits and starts. They<br/>
detour. But - those side trips can turn into their main life&#39;s journey<br/>
when you least expect it &lt;G&gt;. And they all add up to make the child<br/>
into the person they are becoming. Parents who want a conventional<br/>
product - a child finishes high school, goes to college, gets a degree,<br/>
gets a job,etc. - may or may not end up satisfied with what unschooling<br/>
brings about - since it is, by definition, quirky and unconventional.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>      There&#39;s another theory (about what is broken) in a new book by <br/>
the former president of Oberlin College,Robert W. Fuller, about <br/>
Somebodies and Nobodies. <br/>
<br/>
       His argument is that most social ills (including child abuse) <br/>
stem from &quot;rankism&quot; in which individuals abuse the power and <br/>
authority of their position, or rank. And that individual dignity for <br/>
all, regardless of rank, is the answer. In other words, to stop abuse <br/>
of all kinds, the answer is to stop abusing power and authority (not <br/>
a very good argument for increasing State power and authority, a la <br/>
CSB, to my mind!&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
       Bsically, then, racism is abuse by those of a higher rank due <br/>
to skin color; sexism is abuse by those of a higher rank due to their <br/>
sex; youth bullying is abuse by those who derive higher rank from <br/>
their parents&#39; rank, or their own physical or financial prowess, or <br/>
their greater numbers (gangs), et cetera. <br/>
<br/>
       The worst school bullies imo are not in the schoolyards, but <br/>
the classrooms and boardrooms and bargaining rooms. I also think <br/>
there are corporate bullies, political bullies, and media bullies.<br/>
 <br/>
       And parent bullies too. Children generally are &quot;of low rank&quot; <br/>
to almost everyone else (whether they are are school or not.) In this <br/>
context, there is no human environment, including the family, free <br/>
from rank, so it&#39;s unlikely that anyplace can guarantee safety <br/>
from &quot;rankism.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
    In this context, Fuller says the way to minimize abuse between <br/>
parents and children is for all of us as individuals to foster a <br/>
society based on the same respect for individual dignity and <br/>
achievement that civil rights and feminism and religious freedom and <br/>
true education are all about. (Again, this would be the OPPOSITE of <br/>
government and the public imposing authority over individuals as CBS <br/>
seemed to call for.)<br/>
<br/>
            <br/>
Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank <br/>

&quot;. . .Low rank -- signifying weakness, vulnerability, and the absence <br/>
of power -- marks you for abuse in much the same way that race, <br/>
religion, gender and sexual orientation have long done. <br/>
<br/>
The book introduces new language and concepts that illuminate the <br/>
subtle, often dysfunctional workings of power in our social <br/>
interactions. It presents rankism as the last hurdle on the long road <br/>
from aristocracy to a true meritocracy, brings into focus a <br/>
dignitarian revolution that is already taking shape and offers a <br/>
preview of post-rankist society. . .&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Doesn&#39;t this sound like the respectful approach to our own family <br/>
members we as unschoolers are applying on so many issues?) JJ<br/>

There&#39;s a parallel between them making a point like -- these children<br/>

children were killed because their mom was mentally ill.  (The Andrea<br/>
Yates case.)  (Although, to me, her mental state seems more relevant.<br/>
 I know lots of people are killed in this country, but I really can&#39;t<br/>
imagine any mother killing all of her children while fully rational. <br/>
I just can&#39;t.)<br/>

it aimed at me, and I don&#39;t want to be guilty of treating other people<br/>

<br/>
I do think it&#39;s a good idea if within the homeschooling community we<br/>
look out for each other and each other&#39;s children, particularly when<br/>
families are under intense stress.  (And I&#39;m sure most of you do it<br/>
already.)  I don&#39;t want to just shrug about violence done to children<br/>
by parents.  So I&#39;m interested in people&#39;s stories or their<br/>
suggestions about personal (or political) action to help parents who<br/>
are having trouble meeting their children&#39;s needs.  (Due to mental<br/>
illness, physical illness or other causes.)<br/>
<br/>
This is on my mind since the CBS report, and I don&#39;t know where to<br/>
start. With my homeschooling friends I know to listen to their<br/>
troubles and comfort and help them as best I can.  It is a stretch for<br/>
me to offer this same kindness to strangers.  (I guess I&#39;m still<br/>
afraid of &quot;strangers&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
How much can we do within the homeschooling community to eliminate<br/>
child abuse?<br/>

others in the story were falling through the social serives cracks, she <br/>
was falling through the cracks in the mental health system. <br/>

safeguards even if their family member is receiving good care.<br/>
