 </span></blockquote>I am with you Kathryn.  And I also think that a belief system that cannot <br/>
stand up to scrutiny is not a very secure one.  Jesus didnt mind people <br/>
asking Him questions and He was very patient and answered them. Sometimes, he <br/>
answered their questions with a question to get them to think critically and <br/>
see the answer themselves.........hey, maybe he was the first unschooler! LOL <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am a Christian and I share that worry. I also read the article and was<br/>
disgusted by it. It is not our job (meaning the christian community as a<br/>
whole) to judge others&#39; relationship with the Lord. If they are not true,<br/>
life has it&#39;s way of revealing this. I don&#39;t believe the bible tells us to<br/>
be so suspicious  and judgemental. The woman you speak of is leaving no room<br/>
for the grace of God. There is no way she has obeyed everything in the bible<br/>
either and to terrify her children like that is scary.<br/>
