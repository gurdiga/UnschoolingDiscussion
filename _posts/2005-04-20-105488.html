<div id="ygrps-yiv-326379494">Does anyone know of an internet site that helps you search your area for <br/>
convicts?<br/>
<br/>
Once, many years ago, our local paper made a huge list for our surrounding <br/>
areas and at that time we had one on our street for several things:  rape, sex <br/>
with a minor under 14, abuse.  I am curious if he is still listed here.<br/>
<br/>
It never occured to me to look on the internet.  But now that my kids are <br/>
getting older and may soon want to be getting out on their own, I am curious.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-634523100">You can Google for your state&#39;s sex offender registry, but be <br/>
forewarned -- the guy who got Jessica down the road from our town <br/>
was &quot;visiting&quot; his sister at the mobile home park.  He also worked <br/>
at the elementary school for a while, as I understand it, but the <br/>
media played that one down for some reason.  I had heard that <br/>
Florida had no policy on screening its teachers or school workers <br/>
years and years ago.  Looks like they still have no qualms about <br/>
who&#39;s supervising the children in the system.  <br/>
<br/>
The other guy had dated the teen&#39;s mom, but he could&#39;ve met up with <br/>
her anywhere.  The predators are out and about, whether they are on <br/>
our street or the next one over.  We roamed the neighborhood when we <br/>
were kids, but most of the moms were still home in the sixties and <br/>
everyone knew everyone else.  Someone&#39;s preteen knocked on my door <br/>
the other day, dressed in full camo-gun, grenade, and all, and <br/>
introduced himself as the new kid on the block (heard we were a <br/>
homeschooling family and came to find out if we were &quot;normal.&quot;)  <br/>
<br/>
This was just after the Jessica mystery was solved and I wondered <br/>
how his parents could feel comfortable sending him off into <br/>
strangers homes without coming to meet us first.  Ours wasn&#39;t the <br/>
first and I doubt it will be the last.  I&#39;m sure my reputation as a <br/>
mom of eight kids preceded me, but still -- they don&#39;t know us from <br/>
Adam or Eve.  I wouldn&#39;t send my kids over to make a cold call, but <br/>
maybe I&#39;m just old-fashioned.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, see if your registry doesn&#39;t turn up on Google.  It&#39;s a bit <br/>
eery to look through all those names and faces and know they&#39;re <br/>
hanging out around town while our kids are running errands and <br/>
such.  Hopefully, they&#39;ve got enough common sense and know-how to <br/>
keep themselves safe by now (at least as is humanly possible.)  I <br/>
have a few adult friends and family who have landed themselves in <br/>
some terrible spots, but I can&#39;t live in fear (or keep up with all <br/>
the transient felons riding into town) and don&#39;t want my kids to <br/>
live that way, either.  <br/>

employees in daycares, preschools, schools but they DO NOT contain any info. on <br/>
child related incidences.<br/>
<br/>
I had worked at a preschool many years ago when a complaint had come up about <br/>
a co-worker and a whole lot of stink came up about her history of neglect and <br/>
abuse and that it was not in her criminal records check.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d think that if one is trying to work with children in any field that <br/>
that would be the first thing available upon hiring.  Strange.<br/>

Does  anyone know of an internet site that helps you search your area for  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
===========================<br/>
 <br/>
Generally the term &#39;convict&#39; is only used during the term of  imprisonment.<br/>
If someone is convicted to ten years in jail and serves that time, I object  <br/>
on principle to his being called &quot;a convict&quot; forever thereafter.<br/>
 <br/>
Our neighborhoods might be filled with once-convicted car thieves and  <br/>
burglars and mail-box-pilferers, but do we bar the doors and no longer use  <br/>
mailboxes and...   <br/>
 <br/>
I know there are problems with repeat offenses, but that&#39;s not limited to  <br/>
sex offenders.  I think it&#39;s pretty horrible, the way Americans in general  are <br/>
treating one class of past-punishment criminals.  No one before was  convicted <br/>
to being a parriah for life, having to register and maybe be subjected  to <br/>
personal interviews with neighbors and other unreasonable life-long  punishment.<br/>
 <br/>
Even if every neighbor goes and asks a guy what he did, he might not be  <br/>
honest, or it might have been a one-shot deal (statuatory rape is still a crime  <br/>
even if the younger person lies like a sonofabitch about her or his age).  <br/>

 <br/>
Sometimes when I&#39;m driving my car around town, I think of what the other  <br/>
drivers might be thinking, or knowing.  Some are grieving a recent or  impending <br/>
death, and that&#39; can&#39;t be good for their concentration.    Some just became <br/>
engaged or just got a great job, and I don&#39;t worry about  their driving as much. <br/>
 And then I think that some have been hit and run  drivers, never caught.  <br/>
Some have murdered someone and not been  caught.<br/>
 <br/>
Every now-registered sex offender was once an unregistered innocent guy  who <br/>
hadn&#39;t commited a crime.  To only worry about registered,  <br/>
punished-and-released guys is to pretend they&#39;re not making &#39;em like that  anymore.  It&#39;s a way <br/>
to make the world seem magically safer.  It  doesn&#39;t.  Much of rape happens in <br/>
homes of people the girl knows, either  by her relatives or a boyfriend&#39;s <br/>
relatives or a female friend&#39;s  relatives.  Stranger-snatching-crazy-movie rapes <br/>
are not the norm.<br/>

It is absolutely illegal to USE the information you get off the <br/>

Girl Scout troop I was leader of - he&#39;d been along on some of our <br/>

daughter. That&#39;s all I know and I have no contact with them, anymore. <br/>
But - it seems worth having a quick look, to me, to see if there is <br/>
someone IN your life right now, someone who might sometimes be in your <br/>

Good.<br/>

There have been a couple of really awful incidents in New Mexico where  <br/>
neighbors band together to run a guy off.  They&#39;ve tormented some people  here.  <br/>
That&#39;s not how the justice system is intended to work.  And I  don&#39;t guess it <br/>
even occurs to them that other neighbors might have served time  for violent <br/>
crimes or theft, and they&#39;re not freaking out about that.<br/>
 <br/>
As to illegality or rights, it probably isn&#39;t a federal law, is it?   State <br/>
by state? Mabye not even statewide everywhere?<br/>

<br/>
There was a story on NPR last week or so about a neighborhood that <br/>
collectively bought the house of a guy who was recently released from <br/>
prison for sex crimes. It must have been a rather exclusive <br/>
neighborhood. They raised several hundred thousand dollars to buy the <br/>
house as well as an extra $5000 to help the guy move away from their <br/>
neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
The concern was that this guy would simply find another neighborhood <br/>
where the residents couldn&#39;t afford such a plan.<br/>

Right.  I&#39;d want to KNOW the guy.  To KNOW him by name.  Not  harass him or <br/>
threaten him.  Get to know him.  It&#39;s the best chance I  can give him to have <br/>
an honest shot at living in my neighborhood.  I don&#39;t  consider a person a <br/>
threat just because they&#39;ve been to prison.  I&#39;m more  concerned with the ones we <br/>
DON&#39;T know about.  Sometimes they&#39;re in our  families.<br/>

and you had to agree NOT to act out against the people<br/>
before they would give you information--but I was<br/>
AMAZED at just how much information they did give. <br/>
Ages and descriptions of the sex acts, and who he was<br/>
most likely to be a threat to by sex and age. <br/>
Apparently there are two living together around the<br/>
corner from us, who will rape anyone from birth to 14<br/>
(according to the website), and &quot;are not participating<br/>
in treatment programs&quot;....<br/>
<br/>
But I was heartened--we just moved from Montana, and I<br/>
looked it up there to find page after page after<br/>
page....literally hundreds of &quot;sex offenders&quot;--I think<br/>
they put in the peeing in the park ones, and the 18<br/>
yos with 17 yo girlfriends, but they didn&#39;t explain<br/>
that.  This list was only about 20 names long, but<br/>
were actually people that the county thought might<br/>
offend again.<br/>

~~~<br/>
It&#39;s really not about me knowing him, but about him knowing me.   Sandra <br/>
mentioned the secrecy that surrounds molestation in families.   That&#39;s why it can <br/>
go on.  Secrecy is a key element in almost any  crime.  If my friend is <br/>
gossiping about me behind my back, I&#39;m going to let  them know I know about it, <br/>
which removes their cover of secrecy, and is the best  way to prevent further <br/>
gossip.<br/>
 <br/>
If a sexual predator moves into my neighborhood, I&#39;m going to let them know  <br/>
that I know about them, and remove their cover of secrecy, especially if it  <br/>
could possibly involve my own kids. I did say that I  &quot;might&quot; ask him about why <br/>
he&#39;s on the registry (could be a woman,  I know).  But likely not.  He&#39;s <br/>
probably suspicious about folks  already, just from having to be registered.  If <br/>
he&#39;s not remorseful, he  might be playing an angle with me so he can strike <br/>
again.  Interaction  would be limited to the conversation we had.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
force it out of  him.  I&#39;d be neighborly.  Meeting a neighbor across the street <br/>
is  innocent enough, the same way I know the wife-beater who actually does live <br/>
 across from me.  I know he hits his wife when he&#39;s drunk, because she told  <br/>
me he does.  I see the police there.  If I can do something to remove  his <br/>
cover of secrecy, and help my family or someone else (her), I will.  So  far, I <br/>
haven&#39;t had the opportunity.  He knows me from when I offered  jalapenos out of <br/>
my garden.  Nicest guy in the world.  If he got drunk  and tried to hit *me* <br/>
when I brought over the extra cucumbers, well, isn&#39;t it  better that I already <br/>
*know* he&#39;s a wife-beater?<br/>
 <br/>
I do happen to be the kind of person that is aware of people in the  <br/>
neighborhood and who lives where and what their dog&#39;s name is, etc.  I&#39;m  that way for <br/>
two reasons.  A) I&#39;m naturally curious about my environment,  and B) I&#39;m <br/>
naturally helpful, which means I will pick up the neighbor&#39;s trash  can when it <br/>
blows into the street because I know that she&#39;s been out of town for  a few <br/>
days, even though she didn&#39;t tell me.  When I said I would drive by a  registered <br/>
sex offender&#39;s house, I didn&#39;t mean I&#39;d go out of my way to do  it.  I&#39;d drive <br/>
by if it was convenient, the same way I would if there were  a particular <br/>
house I like to look at, or street I prefer to drive on because  it&#39;s beautiful, <br/>
or safer or quicker.  <br/>
 <br/>
Back to the subject, I don&#39;t know about the first-time molesters or the  ones <br/>
who haven&#39;t been caught.  But again, they&#39;re more likely to be someone  the <br/>
victim knows already  I can lift the veil of secrecy with the ones I  know <br/>
about.  And they should know that I know.  At least assume that  *some* of their <br/>
neighbors are checking such things.  What else is the  registry for?<br/>

<br/>
Actually, sometimes there are falsely accused within our families.  <br/>
CPS trumped up some charges of sexual molestation against the step-<br/>
grandfather of my (preschool age) grandniece after he offered to <br/>
emergency babysit one day, and he spent nearly a year in jail before <br/>
he was exonerated of the charges for lack of evidence.  This man had <br/>
already raised four kids, one of his own and three of my brother&#39;s, <br/>
including two daughters -- all now in their mid-late thirties.  If <br/>
he had been that kind of person, he would have had plenty of <br/>
opportunity to play that dirty little game when they were growing <br/>
up. Still, CPS had her mom and grandmother convinced by the time <br/>
they were finished unprofessionally interrogating this little girl <br/>
until she finally agreed to their assessment of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
My ex-SIL threatened to divorce him after 30+ years of marriage, his <br/>
reputation was ruined, he lost his livelihood, and for what?  <br/>
Despite it all, he hung in there and his family is actually back <br/>
together for the most part (although another marriage of nearly 15 <br/>
years broke up after all the turmoil,) but the neighborly <br/>
speculation surely goes on and the scars will remain for a <br/>
lifetime.  You can rest assured that he&#39;s not the first, nor will he <br/>
be the last innocent person to be burned at the stake (and I can <br/>
imagine that includes more than a few Catholic priests, &quot;recovered <br/>
memories&quot; and all) by a so-called child-protective system.  <br/>
<br/>
Our list has &quot;predator&quot; in red, but doesn&#39;t explain the <br/>
designation.  I looked it up yesterday and promptly forgot the exact <br/>
definition, but I think it was for those who prey on minors and are <br/>
believed to be &quot;at risk&quot; for repeat offense.  As for leaving my <br/>
babies at the bus stop or sending them off to walk down a busy <br/>
street to school or the park all alone -- you&#39;ve got to be kidding.  <br/>
People seem to be living in some kind of dream world if they don&#39;t <br/>
see problems with that.  How many times do you think Jessica walked <br/>
past her killer&#39;s abode headed to and from school, where he also <br/>
happened to be employed?  <br/>
<br/>
This guy didn&#39;t have to take a chance by walking in her house and <br/>
stealing her away in the middle of the night (must have been pretty <br/>
high that time) -- he had every opportunity to snatch her without <br/>
anyone ever being the wiser.  They may never have found her if he <br/>
had just gone back to his registered place of residence and played <br/>
innocent.  The family had never even seen him hanging around or knew <br/>
his sister was one of their neighbors, according to the news. <br/>
<br/>
People tell their kids never to swim without a capable and skilled <br/>
buddy, but encourage them to navigate the waters of society on their <br/>
own from the earliest ages.  I was glad to hear that Keith gave <br/>
Kirby some straight talk about the pizza delivery, although I really <br/>
thought the odds of being robbed weren&#39;t really that high (guess it <br/>
depends on the area.)  <br/>
<br/>
Nike was considering the postal service (very short-handed here) and <br/>
there are an awful lot of social security checks being delivered in <br/>
our retirement community, but I was more concerned about dogs (she <br/>
wasn&#39;t) myself :oP Now the thought of being in close contact with <br/>
sexual offenders and crackheads is crossing my mind as well.  She&#39;s <br/>
not any more keen on college than Kirby after a life of learning in <br/>
freedom, so they are both at a crossroad in their lives.  <br/>
<br/>
Nike applied at a few stores to earn some money for her trip to <br/>
Toronto, but nobody ever called back.  The information she provided <br/>
was pretty generic.  Does Kirby really have to take the GED to get a <br/>
_bona fide_ job after all those years of working in the gaming <br/>
field?  I thought that stating their homeschool grad status <br/>
adequately filled in the blank, but maybe I&#39;m wrong.</div>
