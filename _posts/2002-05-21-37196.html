Liam to hear about Kirby.  Liam really needs to know that he is not the<br/>

Hi, Marji --<br/>
<br/>
You are really not alone on this.  I&#39;m walking in at least one of your<br/>
shoes.  My 8yob James has never been to school.  He reads, but feels<br/>
really unable to write yet.  (And I mean single words or very short<br/>
sentences that he wishes to write.)  I&#39;ve heard him say things that<br/>
indicate that he really believes that he can&#39;t do this.  And it IS<br/>
heartbreaking.<br/>
