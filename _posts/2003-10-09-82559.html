<div id="ygrps-yiv-59547029">One woman walked out, saw Lexie and Janene and said &quot;Oh, I&#39;m glad I <br/>
wasn&#39;t the only one to bring my child.&quot;  The only difference I saw, <br/>
which was significant, was that her child was outside climbing a tree <br/>
while she was inside voting.  My child was climbing the same tree while <br/>
we were in line but when the line went inside they went in with me and I <br/>
read to them out of our current read aloud.  And the both went into the <br/>
little voting box with me, with Lexie actually participating in the <br/>
process. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this woman brought her child with her to vote.  She <br/>
brought him with her to the church where she voted and he climbed a <br/>
tree.  Not that tree climbing is not important, but both were possible.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I do realize I sound a bit ostentatious. <br/>
