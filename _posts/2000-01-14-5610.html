<div id="ygrps-yiv-801573114">My two daughters (17 and 20), our houseguest (oldest daughter&#39;s &quot;boyfriend&quot;--quotes because for some reason I&#39;ve never liked that word!) and I are leaviang for the NYC area in a couple of days and will be there for a week or a little more.  We&#39;re staying with my daughter&#39;s friend&#39;s father for a couple of nights in Philadelphia, then we&#39;ll be heading toward NYC.  This trip came up REALLY suddenly and we&#39;re without lodging at this point.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone on this list live in the NYC area and could recommend a hotel/motel, B&B, etc., where we could stay without spending a fortune (I can hear the laughter)?  My daughter and her friend will probably be staying at his sister&#39;s apartment in NJ, but that&#39;s small and already has two occupants.  Do visitors ever say in less expensive places outside the city and just travel in by train or whatever?  I feel ridiculously uneducated about this, but don&#39;t have the time to research a lot.  My dh went to Barnes and Noble yesterday and got a lot of information, but I thought asking a real person (you are real people, right? :) ) might be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125951410">Hi there.<br/>
<br/>
About 14 years ago I stayed in NYC at the Sloan House YMCA which also can be <br/>
used as a hotel of sorts.  It was a very simple place to stay - on 34th and <br/>
8th and just a block from the A line.  The bathroom is down the hall...but it <br/>
was certainly sufficient.  There are greasy spoons (restaurants) nearby.  It <br/>
is not a superlative lodging experience, but if you are only looking for a <br/>
place to sleep at night it might be sufficient.  14 years ago it was really <br/>
cheap ($30 a night) which I am sure has gone up - but it might still be <br/>
within the reasonable range.<br/>
<br/>
Have a lot of fun!<br/>

Hi,<br/>
I wish I had a specific suggestion for you.  I will tell you that it works <br/>
WONDERFULLY to stay in an outlying area and take the train in.  I took my two <br/>
young sons on a &quot;field trip&quot; to NYC last spring.  We stayed with my sister in <br/>
NJ and rode the train back and forth with the commuters.  We had a great <br/>
time.  Hope you do too!<br/>
pax et bonum,<br/>

The darn trouble with cleaning the house is it gets dirty the next day<br/>
anyway,<br/>
so skip a week if you have to.  The children are the most important<br/>
thing.<br/>
