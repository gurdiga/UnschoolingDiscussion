<br/>

&quot;Look out, kids. Mom has found the...<br/>
<br/>
WHEEL OF DREADED CONSEQUENES!<br/>
<br/>
An upbeat, fun, and totally unique behavior modification tool for parents <br/>
wishing to modify their childrens&#39; behavior.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I get such intense pleasure from handing down dreaded punishment to my <br/>
kids!  What a crock of shit!<br/>
