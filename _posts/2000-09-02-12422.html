&lt;&lt; So my question is does anyone have any <br/>
 suggestions as to how to handle situations that arrise when DH is <br/>
 dealing with the children in a manner that I totally disagree with <br/>
 and the children aren&#39;t used to, simply because they are use to the <br/>
 way I handle things since I am the one who is home all day and night <br/>
 and DH works all day and all night?  Corallyn<br/>

don&#39;t discuss our disagreement about the kids in front of them.  We disagree <br/>
about other things so they can see how to resolve disagreements, but not when <br/>
it concerns them as they can see it as divide and conquer.<br/>
