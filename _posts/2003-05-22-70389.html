<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751028568">&lt;&lt; And one benefit you can tell him is that the bugs<br/>
<br/>
find you less attractive also.  They would always attack the one that<br/>
<br/>
smelled<br/>
<br/>
like soap, deodorant or perfume.  LOL &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Well no wonder my kids and me getting eaten alive from the mosquitoes<br/>
<br/>
here!!!!! Actually Joseph and my husband don&#39;t get bit, just me and the<br/>
<br/>
girls. Seems like they are partial to females because Joseph and Joe shower<br/>
<br/>
every day too. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think mosquitos bite because of the kind of blood one has. A particular <br/>
thing that&#39;s in it (or maybe that&#39;s *not* in it). Not the cleanliness of the <br/>
skin. I never (never have) get bitten, my dh gets attacked. (We both shower a few <br/>
times a week, usually together &lt;g&gt;.)   Lara.......</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266369208">I looked up a few sites on Mosquitos.<br/>
<br/>
From what I understood only female&#39;s bite.  They bite to aid in increasing <br/>
their egg production.  One site said that they are attracted by CO2 and can <br/>
sense your breath as far as 100 feet away.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure most know but if you try to eliminate all the standing water in <br/>
your yard that may help cut down on the numbers of them.<br/>
