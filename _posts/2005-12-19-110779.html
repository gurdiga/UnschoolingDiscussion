<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827647126">Here is a gift idea for/from relatives who don&#39;t live nearby but do use the computer.<br/>
<br/>
My mom and I both got webcams and have been using them to have video conversations.  We can see each other while we talk, using MSN instant messenger.  There are other free programs, such as Yahoo messenger.  AOL probably has something.<br/>
<br/>
It is really a great way to keep in touch.  Not only can she &quot;see&quot; her grandkids, but they can hold things up to the camera to show her - artwork or a new toy, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
Prices vary greatly.  We happened to get ours on a buy one, get one free deal.  We got a fairly low end, but it works well enough.<br/>
<br/>
I know lots of people have these already, but thought I&#39;d mention it for those who haven&#39;t considered the idea.<br/>
