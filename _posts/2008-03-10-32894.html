<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144694109">I feel like I&#39;m mad with so many people right now so I&#39;m wondering if maybe it&#39;s just me. But then again maybe it&#39;s just one of those weeks where when it rains it pours (buckets of stupidity). I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
One of the biggies: My brother-in-law (BIL) recently made some comments about homeschooling that really pissed me off. He said homeschooling any child over the age of 7 is a detriment to society, he refered to kids being deliquents and said there is no hope for any homeschooled kids to get along in society or succeed in life. This wouldn&#39;t have offended me if it weren&#39;t coming from a family member and didn&#39;t feel as if it were directed toward my child.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m not only ticked off at him but I&#39;m really ticked off at my husband&#39;s apparent disregard toward it. He just kinda brushed it off like it meant nothing. He does this a lot with his family; endures verbal abuse or allows insults. I don&#39;t get it but I stay out of it for the most part. But now that it&#39;s in regards to my child, I&#39;d really like him to stand up for us. I&#39;ve been putting up with comments from my MIL and now my BIL and feel like I&#39;m up against the world with no support. <br/>
<br/>
I know my emotions are escalated right now because I&#39;ve been fighting some local homeschooling battles and having to deal with really rude, judgemental people. But this issue with my BIL and husband started before all that started. It&#39;s just that now I can&#39;t see to get past my anger. Am I wrong to be mad? <br/>

I would put out the idea that you aren&#39;t asking the right question.  If you are mad, then <br/>
you are mad--right or wrong, good or bad.  You have to start with where you are and <br/>
honor it for a moment.  Then breathe, then breathe again.<br/>
<br/>
This statement right here is the biggie:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So I&#39;m not only ticked off at him but I&#39;m really ticked off at my husband&#39;s apparent <br/>
disregard toward it. He just kinda brushed it off like it meant nothing. He does this a lot <br/>
with his family; endures verbal abuse or allows insults.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds as though your husband&#39;s family communicates with a pattern of verbal <br/>
rudeness.  I grew up in a family where my mother had a head injury when I was about 3 or <br/>
4 (she can&#39;t even remember), and many things just came out of her mouth--much of it ill <br/>
considered, so I grew up in an environment of verbal abuse that the whole family <br/>
participated in.  It took me until my late 20s to realize that I wasn&#39;t going to change them-<br/>
-and it took being a part of my husband&#39;s very polite family to realize that not all families <br/>
are like that.<br/>
<br/>
The first step might be to realize (if appropriate) that some of the attacks may be family <br/>
communication patterns rather than personal.  If they are used to speaking rudely to <br/>
eachvother there might be something else going on besides communication--<br/>
competition, trying to get attention, trying to get a reaction, etc.  If you charge in and try <br/>
to answer him (even in your mind) without understanding the reason he&#39;s saying these <br/>
things, it might not be very effective.  Ask yourself, &quot;Do you even think he really believes <br/>
what he is saying?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And your husband might be intentionally sloughing them off because he might be wiser to <br/>
their ways than you are.  <br/>
<br/>
Those are my first thoughts...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt; Tara<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not necessarily wrong to be mad, just very unproductive.  Your BIL <br/>
obviously doesn&#39;t know anything about homeschooling, he is parroting <br/>
ignorant beliefs.  I&#39;ve found that its a waste of energy to feel anger <br/>
towards ignorant people.  Yes, they bother me, but I really can&#39;t make <br/>
someone be more informed that chooses ignorance and chooses to make <br/>
arguments based in ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
If, as humans, we could insert knowledge into those without, schools <br/>
wouldn&#39;t need to exist, and teaching would be easy.<br/>
<br/>
Next time the conversation comes up with your BIL, ask him for <br/>
empirical data proving his theory that homeschoolers won&#39;t &quot;make it&quot; in <br/>
society.</div>

house where kids were to be seen and not heard; my MIL talks all the <br/>
time about how proud she was that her boys were quiet and docile when <br/>
she told them to be. They were always criticizing his choices, making <br/>
him eat on the kitchen floor if he cut his hair a way his dad didn&#39;t <br/>
like or shaming him if he made a bad choice. He learned early on you <br/>
don&#39;t stand up to people, and you don&#39;t speak your mind. It&#39;s just so <br/>
crazy. I was shown you can respect another person while still <br/>
speaking your mind and having self-respect. I was shown adults don&#39;t <br/>
have the right to be rude just cuz they are adults. But he endured a <br/>
lot of emotional neglect and verbal abuse. So yeah I guess maybe he;s <br/>
just used to it. <br/>

people I&#39;ve been dealing with. It&#39;s just the fact they are family and <br/>
I&#39;m up against them on my own that is getting to me. But I do think <br/>
you&#39;re right. I need to just start ignoring them like he does. <br/>
<br/>
I think I just realized a ugly fact: that my husband has been taking <br/>
crap from them for so long and my feeling mad at him or trying to get <br/>
him involved or get him to handle it is the equivalent to the <br/>
criticism he grew up with. Ewww, I&#39;m acting like my mother-in-law! I <br/>
think I&#39;m going to go cry!<br/>
<br/>
I so don&#39;t want to treat him like they do, pressuring him to get what <br/>
I need. But I don&#39;t want to feel like I&#39;m the only one to handle this <br/>
stuff either. How do I support him but get the support I need from <br/>
him? <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a hubby whose family sounds very similar. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In our case I had to realize my husbands support was/IS there it just<br/>
may not have been how I initially envisioned it. Most of our issues<br/>
are w/ my MIL, I wanted him to stand up to her, to say something, to<br/>
let her know that WE didn&#39;t agree with her! Those were unrealistic<br/>
expectations I had placed on him.  It wasn&#39;t going to happen.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s given up on changing his mother a long time a go.  He wasn&#39;t<br/>
listening to her or letting her bother him.  I was listening to her<br/>
and letting her bother ME!  It was for ME to let go and stop listening<br/>
to her.  Realizing that I wasn&#39;t going to change them.  So, now we<br/>
often go home and joke and laugh about things that were said.  &quot; Can<br/>
you believe so and so said this??&quot;  type stuff!!  Sure she still<br/>
bothers me (I&#39;ve asked for help here before) but I don&#39;t let it become<br/>
a problem for dh and I.  He deals with her the way he is comfortable<br/>
and I deal with her the way I am.  I have written her letters and set<br/>
boundaries twice.  Usaully I take his road...ignore it!:)   <br/>
<br/>
Imagine going home, your BIL didn&#39;t bug you because you don&#39;t care<br/>
what he thinks.  And you and dh having a little laugh over his ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
So, perhaps, if your perspective changed you might find that the<br/>
support is already there????????<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-590230100">I have a couple of photos of my husband when he was little, like 3 at the <br/>
most. In particular there is one where he has big eyes full of tears and <br/>
looks so sad. He describes that as &quot;his life&quot;. It is made more poignant when <br/>
you know that these aren&#39;t family snapshots - they didn&#39;t take snapshots; <br/>
they had professional photographers come to family events, like a day at the <br/>
beach, and take photos the best of which they they blew up to 14x17 (as this <br/>
photo is) or sent to the press.<br/>
<br/>
This photo of their little son weeping is one they thought &quot;cute&quot; enough to <br/>
enlarge.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I look at that sad little boy I just want to run and put my arms <br/>
around my dh and cuddle him and make it up to him. (And run and cuddle my <br/>
little girl too.)<br/>
<br/>
His parents didn&#39;t even know what a cool, creative, vibrant, wonderful kid <br/>
they had living in the same house with them.<br/>
<br/>
Evidently nor did Tara&#39;s husband&#39;s folks.<br/>

Maybe instead of thinking you know what you need from him, though,  <br/>
you should ask him why it doesn&#39;t upset him.  He might be able to  <br/>

she replied &quot;please forget the letter I sent you.&quot;  I don&#39;t know what<br/>
that means but I didn&#39;t bring it up again, but I also didn&#39;t &quot;forget&quot;<br/>
it.  So, basically nothing changed.<br/>
<br/>
I should also say that your advice helped immensely a few weeks ago. <br/>
Grandma had made ds (graham) feel really bad about himself by quizzing<br/>
him and pointing out his reading pace being slower than school kids. <br/>
You told me to explain to Graham why Grandma did that (she doesn&#39;t<br/>
understand our learning philosophy, it&#39;s cause she cares and worries<br/>
about him).  Wow, what a difference that made in Grahams feelings about<br/>
the situation.  That advice really helped and he just said &quot;tell her not<br/>
to do it again&quot;, which is why I sent the 2nd letter.<br/>
<br/>
So, hence the 2nd letter,  I took the time ONLY because my son asked me<br/>
to tell Grandma not to quiz him anymore.   She replied very defensively<br/>
(she didn&#39;t want to&quot; insult my teaching methods&quot;...barf) but said she<br/>
would not do it again.   We haven&#39;t seen her since so I&#39;m not sure how<br/>
it really went.  I&#39;m not expecting it to change her manipulative<br/>
personality but I did draw a line in the sand where Graham was<br/>
concerned.  Not that she&#39;ll have the pleasure to be alone with him again<br/>
for a long while.<br/>
<br/>
That was one thing I had to learn.  I wasn&#39;t changing her.  If I was<br/>
sending my kids to their house, I should have known that Grandma is the<br/>
way she is  and do things that I may not approve of (like cut my sons<br/>
hair, quiz him, tell my daughter she needs to go to church,school,<br/>
etc.).  So, I look at it as my bad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a riot...hysterical in fact!  I just read it to hubby and he too<br/>
found it hysterical !! I&#39;m usually pretty good w/ one liners (I<br/>
bartended for years  [:-?] ) but I really just bite my tongue around<br/>
her.  You once gave me the best advice for her, which I keep in my<br/>
artillery... just in case.  You said something to the effect of, we&#39;re<br/>
hoping for a better relationship with our kids than you have with yours.<br/>
<br/>
Usually I trust try to talk about superficial stuff, recipes, sports,<br/>
vacation ideas, etc.   I was really hoping my kids would have one of<br/>
those storybook relationships with their grandparents.  It was fairly<br/>
good when they were  really little but as my kids have gotten older, not<br/>
so much!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the advice and the laugh!<br/>

<br/>
Good.  Thanks for the feedback and update.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I was really hoping my kids would have one of those storybook  <br/>

were really little but as my kids have gotten older, not so much!-=-<br/>
<br/>
With mine it was that way, only even when they were babies there were  <br/>
some problems (not that the kids knew about).  Keith&#39;s mom didn&#39;t  <br/>
know why we wanted the kids to sleep with us.  Even when the kids  <br/>
were bigger, sometimes I&#39;d take the bedroom with Holly and Keith  <br/>
would be in the den with the boys.  Last time we went, Holly and I  <br/>
slept on the queen bed in our van.  It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like to be  <br/>
with Keith, but we were not ABOUT to have sex on a fold-out couch in  <br/>
the room next to his parents, and our kids were VERY likely to be  <br/>
more comfortable if they could hear, smell and touch someone familiar  <br/>
in an unfamiliar house.<br/>
<br/>
But when the kids got older, teens, things got really good with the  <br/>
grandparents.  The kids had real stories to tell, and were interested  <br/>
in stories of the grandparents&#39; lives, and so the fact that our kids  <br/>
will talk to adults was impressive to them.  They had other  <br/>
grandkids, surly schoolkids who had to be dragged to visit, and then  <br/>
would look away, pouty and hateful the whole time.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m saying is that I hope your kids have cousins who are  <br/>
worse.<br/>
<br/>
No, that&#39;s not it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think teen unschoolers aren&#39;t as disturbing as eight and ten year  <br/>
old unschoolers are.<br/>

to cut his hair and he said  &quot;it&#39;s ok mom, grandma thought I would look<br/>
better.&quot;  It just really irked me cause he loved his long &quot;jedi&quot; hair!! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>So, there is still hope.  Hubby (Mark) and I have had discussions about<br/>
leaving them there for visits and overnights.  He thinks as they get<br/>
older they will be more comfortable standing up for themselves and<br/>
realizing they don&#39;t have to do things just cause grandma wants them to.<br/>
Mark pictures our kids as these strong independent people (which I know<br/>
they are growing into) who can handle grandma.  I just don&#39;t know if<br/>
they&#39;re ready for that or if they&#39;re comfortable setting  boundaries<br/>
with her.  They like to make grandma and grandpa happy...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to &quot;prep&quot; the kids before we&#39;ve dropped them off   ( you can<br/>
call me whenever you want, use your restaurant manners,  don&#39;t use any<br/>
swear words, don&#39;t watch family guy,  remember to help pick up, etc.)<br/>
but grandma tends to blind side me!  I didn&#39;t preface to the kids, &quot;you<br/>
don&#39;t have to let grandma cut your hair cause grandma thinks it&#39;ll look<br/>
better or you don&#39;t have to write your abc&#39;s  cause grandma says&quot;<br/>
because I never even thought of her doing these things. [:-/]<br/>
<br/>
I see Mark and your point and do think that it could be a better time<br/>
for them as they get older.  In all honesty, the kids don&#39;t see grandma<br/>
as the manipulator that I do and I really don&#39;t want them to see her<br/>
like that.  They usually really enjoy their grandparents and I really<br/>
don&#39;t want their grandma to blow it with her maniputlation!!<br/>
<br/>
And, yes  we do have cousins (schooled kids) and I don&#39;t think they&#39;re<br/>
as genuinely sweet and kind as my sweeties (I may be biased  [;)]  ).  <br/>
But those cousins do go to her church and they go to<br/>
school and have parents who have them babysit all the time so perhaps<br/>
they feel closer to them then they do to my kids.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your advice, it&#39;s  nice to hear how other people deal with<br/>
family who aren&#39;t on the same page.<br/>
<br/>
Now send some of that New Mexico heat up north here!!<br/>

<br/>
Think again about what &quot;blow it&quot; would mean in this context.<br/>
<br/>
What you hope (I think) is that your kids will see the nicest  <br/>
possible aspects of their grandmother and have good memories.  But as  <br/>
with any dynamic interaction, now it&#39;s her move.  Her thoughts and  <br/>
actions and words are her &quot;moves&quot; in this game.  *IF* she plays out  <br/>
her side in such a way that the kids see her as manipulative, that&#39;s  <br/>
her choice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, back at *your* house:  If each time they&#39;re with grandma  <br/>
they only appreciate you more, that&#39;s a bonus!<br/>
<br/>
Your stock can go up when others behave badly.<br/>
