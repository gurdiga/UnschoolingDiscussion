&gt;My kids have to be tested this year<br/>
&gt;I am so NONtest that I am not even sure of the name of the tests<br/>
&gt;In PA you have to be tested in certain grades<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know that PA is a tough state to homeschool in (you have my deepest<br/>
sympathies! We&#39;re so spoiled in California) but just in case, make sure you<br/>
know:<br/>
<br/>
1) If you don&#39;t test, what happens?<br/>
2) If the kids are sick and you miss the test, what happens?<br/>
3) If you miss the make-up test, what happens?<br/>
4) Must the test be administered by another person and/or in another<br/>
location, or can you give it to the kids at home?<br/>
5) If they test poorly, what happens?<br/>
<br/>
When you know the answers to those questions (which you may already) then<br/>
you know what you must work around. Assuming the &quot;worst-case scenario&quot; (the<br/>
children MUST take the test in a foreign location without you around and if<br/>
they don&#39;t do well, they have to be enrolled in school), I&#39;d pull out some<br/>
stops and get some practice tests (this is not cheating. This is what<br/>
schools do all the time -- practice the kids on tests that look just like<br/>
the ones they&#39;ll be taking until they&#39;re good at it). It&#39;s annoying, but<br/>
better to &quot;practice the test for a few weeks and take the darn thing and<br/>
then get on with your life than to have them trying to drag your kids off to<br/>
school. Of course, you could always move across the state line, too. :) <br/>
<br/>
From what I know of PA, you may not have a &quot;just don&#39;t test&quot; loophole like<br/>
there are in many so-called mandatory test states. In some &quot;mandatory&quot;<br/>
states you can take the tests at home with no one else there (I&#39;d feel free<br/>
to say at that point the test becomes an open-book game that the whole<br/>
family can play &lt;g&gt;. I don&#39;t feel any ethical dilemma at refusing to have my<br/>
children perform like trick ponies at the whim of the state) or if the kids<br/>
get a 3% it just gets filed in a drawer and there are no &quot;now you have to<br/>
send them to SCHOOL!&quot; repercussions (which is the stoopidest thing<br/>
imaginable anyway -- what do they do with the kids who flunk tests at<br/>
school? Make them homeschool?)<br/>
<br/>
If you will give me permission by private e-mail, I can connect you with a<br/>
very experienced PA unschooler who should be able to give you all the info<br/>
you&#39;re requesting.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
