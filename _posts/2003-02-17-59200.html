<div id="ygrps-yiv-566143071">my dh was on board when we first started hs. he said that nobody is better <br/>
to &quot;teach&quot; her than you, your her mother. as she got older her would worry <br/>
about what she was doing. i explained it to him (sometimes over and over <br/>
again). when something amazing would happen i would gently remind him that <br/>
it is indeed working. when she would do something that was upsetting to him <br/>
(like refuse to comply with a demand) he would say things like you need to <br/>
punish her. we would work through these things as i would gently point out <br/>
that he wouldn&#39;t like it if i demanded something of him that he didn&#39;t want <br/>
for himself and then punish him for not doing what i want.<br/>
my dd is now 11. he said to me about a year ago that this &quot;letting children <br/>
do whatever they want&quot; (yes this is how he sees unschooling) really seems to <br/>
work. he is impressed with her for who she is and how much she has learned <br/>
all on her own. we still back slide (both of us) but we work through it with <br/>
the faith that we had at the beginning of the experiment (this was an <br/>
experiment to us because i had never known anyone at the time that had done <br/>
this) and now with the experience we have gained through the years.<br/>
btw i think it was easier for me to reject the mainstream ideas because i <br/>
totally reject the way i was raised. he had a harder time feeling this way <br/>
because he felt loved by his parents even though they punished. i think he <br/>
had a hard time realizing that you can reject a persons actions but still <br/>
love the person (his parents).<br/>
