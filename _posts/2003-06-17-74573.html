<div id="ygrps-yiv-683254168">I&#39;m looking for some opinions on thumb sucking.  My son will be six <br/>
next month and still sucks his thumb.  He also has a favorite stuffed <br/>
animal (Curious George!) that he needs to have in order to fall <br/>
asleep.  Today he lost George and had an incredibly hard time falling <br/>
asleep.  We searched high and low for George and didn&#39;t find him.  He <br/>
loses George fairly often, although we&#39;re usually able to find him <br/>
before bed.  I&#39;ve suggested that he might like to keep George on his <br/>
bed in order to keep him safe, but he said he would miss him too much.<br/>
<br/>
Should I do anything about it?  I broke my daughter of thumb sucking <br/>
by using hot sauce, but my parenting style has so drastically changed <br/>
since then.  I couldn&#39;t bring myself to do that to him!    <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard stories about kids still sucking thumbs when they&#39;re <br/>
teens.  That just doesn&#39;t seem ok to me.  At what point do you do <br/>
something about it?  <br/>

My thumb-sucking magically disappeared in fourth grade when I <br/>
had my first retainer. Very hard to cram all that stuff into your <br/>
mouth at once. :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, I slept with a &quot;blankie&quot; for years (until fifth grade).<br/>
<br/>
I did not have a troubled home and I ended up with a ton of <br/>
orthodontia. :)<br/>
