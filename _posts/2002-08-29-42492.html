<div id="ygrps-yiv-799021883">Hi,<br/>
  I worked in a preschool for 15 years.  Parents would say all the time that <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t have the patience to work there.  And they meant it.  And I <br/>
think the people who say they wouldn&#39;t have the patience to homeschool really <br/>
mean it, too.  Some people really are happy and relieved to see their kid get <br/>
on the bus in September.  And some people are really glad they don&#39;t have <br/>
kids at all.<br/>
  Personally, I loved being surrounded by children all day.  And now I love <br/>
spending all day with my own child.  And both situations do take patience, <br/>
but I&#39;m a very patient person.<br/>
  And I&#39;m mighty glad I got the internet when I did, because I learned about <br/>
homeschooling, and later unschooling, just in time.  That kindergartener&#39;s <br/>
mom could&#39;ve been me.  Homeschooling was for disruptive kids, a last resort <br/>
before juvenile detention (or so I thought).  What I learned astounded me.  <br/>
And I did have to make some changes, like quit a long standing, fun, decent <br/>
paying job.  But staying home with my son is one of the best things I ever <br/>
did. <br/>
  And, at least around here, homeschooling seems to be a secret that nobody <br/>
talks about.  So maybe if we talk about how good it&#39;s going, and other kids <br/>
want to be home (or un)schooled, they can pester their parents.  Maybe some <br/>
of those parents  can check their options, search their souls, and take the <br/>
leap.  Maybe some more children can benefit from a superior (IMO) form of <br/>
education/life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is something I&#39;ve been thinking about for a while. There are a lot of people who have kids who really don&#39;t have any clue about being parents, and aren&#39;t prepared or willing to make parenting a full-time job. There&#39;s a lot of &quot;expertitis&quot; going around, telling these already uncertain folks that they aren&#39;t up to the job, and should leave it to &quot;the professionals&quot; -- schools, mainly.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So why do they have kids? One of the strongest reason, I think, is that society pushes the &quot;fulfillment&quot; bit, as if all women have to be mommys, and all men have to be daddys. Some of these folks don&#39;t like kids. But they have them, because, well, that&#39;s what people do.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I used to sneer at parents who seemed totally inept and proud of it. Now I tend to wonder if maybe they wouldn&#39;t have been happier if society had said, &quot;Go do something else with your life.&quot;<br/>
