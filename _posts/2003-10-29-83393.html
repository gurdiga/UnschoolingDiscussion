<div id="ygrps-yiv-341669390">This is an older post but reminds me of a discussion we are having on a local <br/>
list. I wrote something in reference to some trad HSers being forceful, <br/>
punishing for work not done, spanking and that there was another way. (I wasn&#39;t <br/>
thinking about relaxed HS at all or anyone on our list that had spoken about it) <br/>
Since that post two Moms have come back VERY defensively about their &quot;relaxed&quot; <br/>
way of HSing. Makes me really want to comment and point out what I said in my <br/>
post as it seems that they are responding to my post but not coming out and <br/>
saying they do this but dancing around it..<br/>
<br/>
 One Mom actually said (no joke) that she let her 9 or 10 yr. old child play <br/>
video games for one day and he pooped and peed himself and sat in it all day <br/>
then she dragged him out of the room kicking and screaming.. I am still beside <br/>
my self on that one. How is this possible one and two how could anyone be <br/>
comfortable writing it as an anti-video game defense? <br/>
<br/>
There are maybe 2 or 3 of us on this list of 200 that Unschool what does one <br/>
say to this as a minority on a list? <br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;My question is why are homeschooler more outraged over the conclusion CBS<br/>
came to after real cases of abuse, than they are at the kind of<br/>
homeschoolers who beat and &quot;discipline&quot; and punish their kids?<br/>
On a lot of lists if you were to speak out against hitting kids you&#39;d get<br/>
that &quot;judgmental&quot; word thrown at you and the &quot;everyone knows what&#39;s best<br/>
for their own families&quot; bull pucky routine.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe everyone should get involved in making spanking and time out and<br/>
go-to-bed-without-your-dinner illegal.<br/>

Holly has a friend who still poops and pees himself.<br/>
I think it&#39;s because any second of his life his mom can blast screaming onto <br/>
the scene without a &quot;Hi, how&#39;s it going, it&#39;s just his name, HIGH PITCHED and <br/>
he knows he&#39;s in trouble.   His brother poops his pants. He&#39;s five or six.  It <br/>
could just be a genetic problem.<br/>
<br/>
But ALL DAY?  How could a mother not pay more attention to her child?  A <br/>
child or adult who is in the care of another and is in pee or poop &quot;all day&quot; is an <br/>
indicator of neglect, and that was a stupid example to bring out in public.  <br/>
Either she&#39;s a liar or a bad mom.  (Wait.  Could be both.)<br/>
<br/>
But if I had a bad mom (wait; I did, most of the time) and I was FINALLY <br/>
given an opportunity I had never had and thought I might never have again, I might <br/>
not waste one minute of that unusual freedom going to the bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
I have three kids who can play video games all they want.  They KNOW they can <br/>
play some more if they stop to pee or eat, so they eat when they&#39;re hungry <br/>
and none of them as had a waking urinary mishap since they were two or three.   <br/>
(Marty, nighttime, but sleeping, not while playing video games.)<br/>
<br/>
Because they know the rules won&#39;t change on them just because they went to <br/>
sleep and woke up again, they LIKE going to bed.  They like their own beds, and <br/>
they like sleeping when they want to.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m preaching to the choir, I know, but sometimes it just feels good to let a <br/>
stream of thought out.<br/>
