&lt;&lt;  There&#39;s no such thing as an eternal condition of &quot;being a spanking <br/>
parent&quot;.  Spanking is an action that can stop at any time when you realize <br/>
that there are more effective ways to discipline your child and model for <br/>
them the dynamics you want them to learn to live regarding respect for other <br/>
people and other people&#39;s bodies. &gt;&gt;<br/>
    <br/>
     I have to agree with this based upon personal experience.  When my <br/>
oldest, now 15, was 4 and 5, I used spanking with him sometimes.   When my <br/>
next sons (twins) were 3 or 4, I used it still sometimes, usually with the <br/>
one who was more aggressive and tended to hit his brother.  I now shudder at <br/>
the thought.  I realized that I was doing exactly what I told him not to do <br/>
and I even witnessed him hitting his brother a few times in a way that seemed <br/>
very similar to his being spanked, as if he were &quot;disciplining&quot; his brother.  <br/>
I am so glad that I stopped this completely and made a decision that my kids <br/>
would never be spanked again.<br/>
     I now feel like it is a violent thing and it bothers me when I see <br/>
friends hit their children.  It seems like there are always more effective <br/>
ways of handling problems.  I have noticed that children who are not hit seem <br/>
to be less aggressive and so I believe that parents may be inadvertently <br/>
aggravating the problems they wish to solve when they spank.  I hope this <br/>
does not alienate those who feel differently.<br/>

<br/>
I have seen both parents who don&#39;t spank with aggressive kids and parents who <br/>
spank with non-aggressive kids. There are so many extenuating circumstances.<br/>
I think this is an over generalization.  <br/>
   Both my sister and a friend once told me that they thought that their kids <br/>
were<br/>
good because they were such affective parents. ( I have had several difficult <br/>
children)<br/>
Then they each had a difficult child and realized it wasn&#39;t their parenting <br/>
as much as it was the fact that they had more compliant children. Well, <br/>
that&#39;s my 2 cents worth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827854194">While this may be new territory for some people there is an absolutely<br/>
overwhelming body of evidence that corporal punishment has destructive<br/>
consequences.  There is broad epidemiological evidence that corporal punishment<br/>
is a significant contributing factor to offending behaviours of all sorts.  In<br/>
addition there is significant evidence that striking children on the buttocks<br/>
leads to a variety of sexual paraphilias in some of them.  The buttocks are an<br/>
erogenous zone so this is not a mystery.<br/>
<br/>
For me this topic is much like circumcision.  The weight of the evidence is so<br/>
detailed and thorough that I have come to the conclusion that internal psychic<br/>
barriers, e.g. the need to defend one&#39;s own parents etc.play a significant part<br/>
of people&#39;s inability to see the evidence, understand it and change their<br/>
behaviour.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Often, when I am at playgroup or other social groups involving children the<br/>
ages of mine, I count my blessings that I have two &quot;easy&quot; kids.  My eldest<br/>
is VERY active and enthusiastic and runs on rocket fuel.  But he is gentle<br/>
and affectionate, and usually responds to discipline (time outs, revoking<br/>
of priveledges, etc) very well.  <br/>
<br/>
His younger brother (19 months) is even easier, being shy and sensative.  I<br/>
don&#39;t even have to use a cross tone with him, as he is so sensative that he<br/>
will cry if i do.  I say, &quot;Alex, no-no, don&#39;t do that..&quot; or whatever the<br/>
situation calls for, and he stops and says &quot;Ooooohhh  Kay!&quot; most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
And here I thought, what with Murphy&#39;s Law and all, that my second child<br/>
would be a &quot;difficult&quot; one because my first was relatively easy (except for<br/>
his allergies and medical conditions that is.)<br/>
