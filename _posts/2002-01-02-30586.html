<br/>
      Several years ago, the American Homeschool Association&#39;s free <br/>
online newsletter was one of the first online publications to take <br/>
advantage of the power of the emailed word. Since the mid-1990&#39;s, <br/>
free online newsletters have proliferated like topsy (what is that <br/>
stuff, anyway?), so we were hesitant to recreate this one, wondering <br/>
if people really wanted still more reading material to keep them at <br/>
their little glowing screens. However, our goal as a service <br/>
organization is to provide information and resources about <br/>
homeschooling, and so, to that end, this newsletter provides access <br/>
some of the best.<br/>
<br/>
      William Shakespeare wrote &quot;Brevity is the soul of wit,&quot; and we <br/>
do want to be witty, at least some of the time, so we&#39;ll keep this <br/>
introductory piece brief. This time, anyway. Enjoy!<br/>

Free Agent Nation: How America&#39;s New Independent<br/>
Workers Are Transforming the Way We Live<br/>
by Daniel H. Pink<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freeagentnation.com/2book.html">http://www.freeagentnation.com/2book.html</a><br/>
<br/>
      This new book by a contributing editor of the business magazine <br/>
Fast Company includes some of the most interesting writing about <br/>
education we&#39;ve read in many years. For example: &quot;Compulsory mass <br/>
schooling is an aberration in both history and modern society. Yet it <br/>
was the ideal preparation for the Organization Man economy, a highly <br/>
structured world dominated by large, bureaucratic corporations that <br/>
routinized the workplace. Compulsory mass schooling equipped <br/>
generations of future factory workers and middle managers with the <br/>
basic skills and knowledge they needed on the job. The broader <br/>
lessons it conveyed were equally crucial. Kids learned how to obey <br/>
rules, follow orders, and respect authority -- and the penalties that <br/>
came with refusal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
      Now remember that these words are not written by a rabblerousing <br/>
unschooler, but by a respected writer from a mainstream business <br/>
magazine. He continues: &quot;We don&#39;t teach little kids how to talk or <br/>
walk or understand the world. We simply put them in nurturing <br/>
situations and let them learn on their own. Sure, we impose certain <br/>
restrictions. (&quot;Don&#39;t walk in the middle of the street.&quot;) But we <br/>
don&#39;t go crazy. (&quot;Please practice talking for 45 minutes until a bell <br/>
rings.&quot;) It&#39;s the same for home-schoolers. Kids can become agents of <br/>
their own education rather than merely recipients of someone else&#39;s <br/>
noble intentions.&quot;<br/>

The Kingdom That Never Was: Inaccuracies in a Sociological Study of <br/>
Homeschooling<br/>
Taking Charge column, by Larry and Susan Kaseman<br/>
Home Education Magazine January/February, 2002<br/>
<br/>
      A recently published sociological study of homeschooling <br/>
contains serious misinformation that we homeschoolers need to <br/>
understand and be able to counter. We may not be able to prevent this <br/>
book from contributing to the mainstream media&#39;s and the academic <br/>
world&#39;s misunderstanding of homeschooling. But if we don&#39;t at least <br/>
respond to these ideas, misunderstanding of homeschooling will <br/>
increase. It&#39;s our responsibility as homeschoolers to correct <br/>
accounts like this because we are the ones who know the most and <br/>
because we will be most strongly affected by the inaccuracies and <br/>
misunderstandings. It is especially important that we work to prevent <br/>
the book from distorting the understanding that we and other <br/>
homeschoolers have of the history of homeschooling. If we don&#39;t <br/>
understand how we have regained and maintained our freedoms so far, <br/>
we are unlikely to understand how to continue to maintain them.<br/>

John Holt&#39;s Growing Without Schooling is Gone<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holtgws.com/gws.htm#STATUS">http://www.holtgws.com/gws.htm#STATUS</a><br/>
<br/>
      A page of homeschooling history has turned. An icon, an <br/>
institution, one of the founding documents of a movement, Growing <br/>
Without Schooling, known to thousands as simply GWS, ceased <br/>
publication in October. Citing insurmountable financial difficulties, <br/>
the staff wrote in their farewell message, &quot;As we know you can <br/>
imagine, this was a very hard decision to make. On the one hand, we <br/>
look back at the 16 years since John Holt&#39;s death and realize how <br/>
significant it is that the magazine did keep publishing all that <br/>
time. On the other hand, we feel deep regret that it cannot continue <br/>
beyond this point.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
      A fascinating interview with GWS publisher Patrick Farenga was <br/>
published in the July/August 1997 issue of Home Education Magazine. <br/>
Patrick talks about John Holt, describing what he was like and why he <br/>
founded Growing Without Schooling in 1977: &quot;What John wrote surprised <br/>
and rang true for many people and made him a celebrity, but it didn&#39;t <br/>
really change schools since he never had a &#39;good reputation&#39; within <br/>
the schools. John was always an outsider, even when speaking to <br/>
schools. One of the reasons John could see how homeschooling could <br/>
work and embraced it so soon was that he was sick of talking about <br/>
changing schools when all that meant was creating &#39;better curricula&#39; <br/>
and &#39;tougher standards.&#39;&quot;<br/>

National Home Education Network<br/>
NHEN-Legislative email discussion list<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NHEN-Legislative/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NHEN-Legislative/</a><br/>
<br/>
      The National Home Education Network&#39;s NHEN-Legislative email <br/>
discussion list is &quot;for all homeschoolers interested in keeping up <br/>
with legal and legislative issues across the country.&quot; As such, many <br/>
issues of importance to homeschoolers are discussed, top news stories <br/>
affecting homeschooling are posted and analyzed, legal and <br/>
legislative affairs are tracked, and much, much more. The ongoing <br/>
exchange of opinions and commentary from the list&#39;s members offer <br/>
some of the most thoughtful and thought-provoking reading available <br/>
to homeschoolers. The last week of December, 2001 offered these posts <br/>
(grateful appreciation to those who granted permission to reprint <br/>
excerpts here):<br/>
<br/>
      Each of us can grow with every book we read and every discussion <br/>
we have. We develop understanding and perspective throughout our <br/>
lives -- that&#39;s what real education is all about! (This list is very <br/>
educational most of the time &lt;g&gt;) And as we grow and change, thank <br/>
goodness, our democratic republic lets us exercise freedom as we <br/>
choose at any given point in time, while allowing us to say any silly <br/>
thing we please but still protects us from each other&#39;s tyranny in <br/>
the process. Most importantly, it allows each of us to make our own <br/>
private decisions for ourselves and our families with some confidence <br/>
in the rule of law, and plenty of ways to redress grievances.<br/>

<br/>
      ...There are lawyers out there that want to convey to the <br/>
general public that their minds are so much greater, and that the <br/>
average person is so stupid, they couldn&#39;t possibly understand plain <br/>
English.  Perhaps the real motivation for this attitude is to make <br/>
un-Constitutional laws with as few as possible people squawking. <br/>
After all, if they are successful with convincing the general public <br/>
that it&#39;s too hard for them to understand so don&#39;t bother, look what <br/>
unscrupulous, power seeking, individuals can accomplish.  My hope <br/>
still is for the general public to be more aware of what the <br/>
Constitution actually states, not what some justice wanted to twist <br/>
it into to fit their political leaning. The Constitution is the <br/>
foundation block for this country and it is straight forward and <br/>
clear.<br/>

AHA FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions about the American Homeschool Association<br/>
<br/>
Who&#39;s behind the American Homeschool Association?<br/>
      The publishers of Home Education Magazine founded the AHA in <br/>
1995, and have maintained it since that time as a free services <br/>
organization for homeschoolers, working online to provide <br/>
information, resources, networking opportunities and more.<br/>
<br/>
How can we join your program?<br/>
      The American Homeschool Association does not offer a program of <br/>
study, only free information and networking with homeschoolers <br/>
online. The name of the organization is similar to a well-known <br/>
correspondence program, The American School, but there is no <br/>
connection between the two.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you offer any publications or materials in print?<br/>
      For the first few years of the AHA&#39;s existence we did provide a <br/>
published (print) newsletter, informational brochures, etc., but now <br/>
the Internet provides a much faster, more convenient, and totally <br/>
free way to do the work we want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Does the American Homeschool Association hold a conference?<br/>
      Over the years we have considered the idea of a national <br/>
conference from time to time, but with the formation of the National <br/>
Home Education Network in 1999 we tabled the idea indefinitely. If <br/>
enough interest is shown we might again consider the idea of hosting <br/>
a national get-together for homeschooling families. The best place <br/>
for exploring the possibilities if anyone is truly interested is on <br/>
the AHA-Discussion email list:<br/>

<br/>
Other Homeschooling FAQ&#39;s and Q&A&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
      The AHA website offers a collection of FAQ&#39;s (Frequently Asked <br/>
Questions) and Q&A&#39;s (Questions and Answers) from some of the best <br/>
homeschooling sites on the web, including the sites for Home <br/>
Education Magazine, the National Home Education Network, <br/>
Unschooling.com, Ann Zeise&#39;s A to Z Home&#39;s Cool, and Holt Associates. <br/>
