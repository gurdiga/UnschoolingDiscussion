I think I understand, but to make sure, would someone please briefly clarify<br/>
the difference between so-called  &#39;eclectic homeschooling&#39; and<br/>
unschooling...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is trusting that the paths children choose for themselves will<br/>
lead them where they need to go. They will learn what they need for<br/>
themselves. Parents are there to facilitate.<br/>
<br/>
(That&#39;s oversimplified of course. Parental attitude towards life and<br/>
learning is a big part of unschooling. We can&#39;t expect kids to get excited<br/>
about learning if we never are. We can&#39;t expect kids to follow interests<br/>
that have never run through their lives in an interesting way.)<br/>
<br/>
Eclectic homeschooling is parents having an idea where the children need to<br/>
go and then letting the children have a big say in what method of travel<br/>
they use to get there. Science might be videos or experiments or classes or<br/>
whatever appeals to the child. There will be a focus on specific subjects<br/>
and skills. <br/>
