I am currently trying to set up a &quot;resource day&quot; for unschoolers. A chance to <br/>
meet up at a community center maybe once a week and play around with sports <br/>
equipment, maybe an art table, a corner with pillows and books or something..<br/>
I know some of you have done activities like this before and would love input.<br/>
Ideas for materials to make available, of course it largely depends on what <br/>
the children want, but I&#39;d love to have ideas to throw out to them.<br/>
This is for unschoolers (and anyone willing to go along with our relaxed <br/>
methods) and mainly give them time to do things that may not be available at <br/>
home.<br/>
There will be all ages, from 18 months to teen.<br/>
My thought is to have different areas set up and the kids can dabble with and <br/>
move around to whatever interests them.<br/>
If some of the parents want to offer mentorship in basketball, art or <br/>
woodworking, we could advertise it ahead of time and the interested kids <br/>
could participate.<br/>
I&#39;d like to hear from those more experienced at this since it would be the <br/>
most planning I&#39;ve done since going to radical unschooling. Mainly our <br/>
&quot;group&quot; consists of two unschooling families (another family recently moved) <br/>
and one or two other families that are wanting a secular group to hang with.<br/>
Input?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811440130">Oh, Ren, that sounds AWESOME!!  Remind me what state you&#39;re in again -- I wish I could go.  Where will you hold it -- in someone&#39;s house?  Rent a community hall?  What other prep are you doing?   Will there be snacks?  What are the liability issues?  I am one of the presidential group for our homeschooling association (100+ families running the full gamut from school-at-home to radical unschooling) this year, and this is some of the stuff I&#39;m looking at.  Any input is greatly appreciated!   Debi<br/>

darn radical to me?!)<br/>
