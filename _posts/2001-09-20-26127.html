 </span></blockquote>Intrumental music is taught en masse. An adept<br/>
intructor(ess) or two play and the kids play all at<br/>
the same time.  Gradually everyone plays the same<br/>
thing.  The instructor shows everyone such things as<br/>
how to hold, tune, care for the instrument, where the<br/>
different sounds (notes) are and then they play away!!<br/>
It is my understanding that proper position, etc.,<br/>
really is not the point of the insruction. The energy<br/>
of the group carries any stragglers.  I didn&#39;t get to<br/>
do this myself , but I did have private violin lessons<br/>
for a few months and I did play with a symphony for a<br/>
little while.  I learned so much MORE being a part of<br/>
the symphony.  The energy of the group, and the music<br/>
itself,  carried me beyond myself!  My own boys are<br/>
all musicians, but did not have Suzuki either as it<br/>
wasn&#39;t available, but I did see several other<br/>
NON-musical family&#39;s small children playing, by ear,<br/>
on rented violins in just a few weeks of<br/>
&quot;instruction&quot;. The children and their parents insisted<br/>
that they looked forward to &quot;classes&quot; becuase it was<br/>
just plain fun. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-641211141">Wow, that sounds awesome! That&#39;s the way my sons&#39; dance class is, and I was <br/>
sort hoping they&#39;d all be like that. That&#39;s really unschooling, isn&#39;t it? <br/>
Fits in great with children learning by doing and being a part of. Thanks for <br/>
sharing.<br/>

cello a couple of years ago (at age 50) and soon joined a string <br/>
orchestra.  It was fun, but I couldn&#39;t really hear myself play, and the <br/>
other cellos carried me along.  What really got me improving fast was <br/>
joining a string quartet made up of people with similar ability to <br/>
mine.  We don&#39;t play things up to tempo, but we have a lot of fun and <br/>
sometimes even make music.  &lt;g&gt;  In a small group like a quartet, you <br/>
really have to carry your part and play in tune.<br/>

have more trouble with sight-reading.  One of the principles of Suzuki is <br/>
learning first to play by ear.  This is a good thing in my opinion.  The <br/>
rationale is that you don&#39;t learn to read before learning to talk, so why <br/>
learn to read music before you can play it.  The problem is that some <br/>
teachers don&#39;t emphasize reading music enough later on, and it&#39;s a <br/>
necessary skill for an orchestral or chamber musician.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-609843576">Thanks for clarification, Tia.  I &quot;got my ideas&quot; from<br/>
word of mouth from students of classes in Tallahassee,<br/>
Fl. about 15 years ago.  At that time, there, there<br/>
were only groups available, that I was aware of. I<br/>
lived in a different community. Sounded wonderful to<br/>
me and I wished my boys could go.  Guess I should have<br/>
done a search....sorry if I misled anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, like all other &quot;lessons&quot; it depend on the<br/>
individual instructor?<br/>

I&#39;ve always known of group Suzuki lessons too.  The description given earlier <br/>
was what I had learned when I first looked into it for Kirby (and when he <br/>
decided not to do it after all)...<br/>
<br/>
But I bet there are websites.<br/>
www.suzuki-music.com/<br/>
