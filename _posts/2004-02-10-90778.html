&gt; I think probably everyone strews a little differently.  I don&#39;t rearrange<br/>
&gt; things in my house.....with 5 kids that happens naturally enough.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is an interesting thread.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think we all may strew slightly differently, depending on the child, <br/>
the circumstances, the family situation, our own personalities.<br/>
<br/>
I strew by listening very closely to what Liam has to say, and picking up on <br/>
his cues as to what he&#39;s interested in.  Then I keep my eyes open for <br/>
activities that will meet his curiosities.<br/>
<br/>
He is interested in marine science -- his sister called him (disparagingly) <br/>
*Discovery Boy* for years because he just wouldn&#39;t SHUT UP about sharks.<br/>
<br/>
An area university offers daytrips out on a research vessel to school and <br/>
youth groups so that the kids can experience the richness of the coastal <br/>
environment up close and personal.  We went with a homeschool group.  He was so <br/>
excited when we got off the boat that I encouraged him to go over and strike up a <br/>
conversation with the boat&#39;s captain.  He ended up asking if there was any way <br/>
he could work on the boat, and was referred to the head guy...who signed him <br/>
up.  He began volunteering there two times a month just about this time last <br/>
year, and is now teaching other kids about the things that fascinate him.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t do much.  <br/>
<br/>
I knew that he was enamoured of the sea, so I noticed when this field trip <br/>
was being formed and asked him if he wanted to go.<br/>
<br/>
I drove him there.<br/>
<br/>
I listened to` his excitement and encouraged him to do the rest.<br/>
<br/>
He OWNS this process.<br/>
<br/>
I just watch, listen carefully, pay attention, look for opportunities, and <br/>
strew.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
While that&#39;s a cool thing to do, I don&#39;t want to lose the direct meaning of <br/>
strewing, which is to scatter things physically about.<br/>
<br/>
I follow my kids&#39; interests too and keep them informed of opportunities, but <br/>
I do that for my adult friends and my husband too.  I think that&#39;s helping <br/>
them find good opportunities. &lt;g&gt;  Keeping them from missing cool stuff they <br/>
would not otherwise have heard about.  Facilitating their interests.<br/>
<br/>
The feeling inside me at this moment is a love of language, and it&#39;s not <br/>
about natural learning.   It makes me cringe when people have taken a word and <br/>
twisted it around too far, so since I really do want to keep advising people to <br/>
strew things in their children&#39;s paths, and while it KIND of can involve <br/>
follow-up activities, I want to ask people not to take the word and torture it.<br/>
<br/>
One currently over-used misuse of a word is &quot;convicted.&quot;  All the Christians <br/>
who are writing online seem to be convicted.  But they haven&#39;t been convicted <br/>
OF anything, they&#39;re convicted TO DO something, and the word doesn&#39;t really <br/>
bend that way.  God is convicting them right and left.   If they said &quot;God has <br/>
inspired me to buy Pampers&quot; or &quot;God has convinced me that cable TV is good to <br/>
have&quot; I wouldn&#39;t cringe, but God convicts them to go and do and be.  Because <br/>
after God&#39;s done they have a conviction.   Meanwhile, I&#39;m trying not to have a <br/>
conniption.  <br/>
<br/>
In word-court they could be convicted.<br/>
<br/>
Strewing often leads to follow-up activities, but follow-up activities aren&#39;t <br/>
the strewing that was originally intended.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bwah! I loved what you wrote.<br/>
<br/>
While my brain is quite sore from all the thinking I&#39;ve been doing lately, <br/>
I am really enjoying this list. So much food for thought!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s rather trivial to post to the whole list... but the last few weeks <br/>
have been quite liberating, as I&#39;ve loosened my reins even more with the <br/>
girls. I was a &quot;gentle -guider,&quot; i.e., &quot;Why don&#39;t you turn off the TV and <br/>
go do XYZ [which will be more educational and make you think more]?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No more! I had to laugh the day my nearly four year old asked every half <br/>
hour... &quot;Such-and-so show is off now. May I watch XYZ show?&quot; &quot;Sure, go <br/>
ahead, if you&#39;d like,&quot; I replied. She watched for about 4-5 hours, I think? <br/>
Looked thrilled every time I said she could still watch if she wanted to do <br/>
so, as I usually tried to keep their viewing to less than an hour or two a <br/>
day... hard to do when four girls keep taking turns turning the TV on!<br/>
<br/>
To my surprise (not sure why I&#39;d be surprised, but I was, pleasantly)... <br/>
they&#39;ve watched more TV on some days, and less on others. But when they&#39;re <br/>
not watching, they&#39;re so much more engaged in whatever they&#39;re doing. <br/>
They&#39;re nicer to each other - doing things together. Sometimes asking each <br/>
other to leave the TV (or computer, or book, or toys, or whatever) and come <br/>
doing something together. They&#39;re discovering what it means to have a <br/>
little more control of themselves, and they&#39;re choosing to use that control <br/>
to learn more about the world around them.<br/>
<br/>
So I strew a bit, read with them, talk about things, get into doing <br/>
whatever they&#39;re doing, and we&#39;ve had a blast! And really, gotten more <br/>
&quot;done&quot; (i.e., given me a sense of fulfillment) on our path of learning <br/>
together than we ever would have the old way, except on those rare days <br/>
when things seemed to go well, and I could go to bed knowing they &quot;learned&quot; <br/>
something that day. Now, we have &quot;right and good&quot; days, to quote Sandra :-)<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, they turned the living room into a &quot;museum,&quot; with areas of <br/>
displays about the rainforest, owl pellets (they&#39;ve been dissecting), <br/>
potato growing, books they&#39;ve been reading, etc. We had some friends stop <br/>
by to visit our museum, having received free tickets at their front door <br/>
earlier in the day.<br/>
<br/>
Their kids are in school, and were completely thrilled that this was the <br/>
kind of stuff my girls get to do all day long. The dad was impressed, <br/>
having not been a big fan of HS. And my girls got a new perspective on how <br/>
lucky they are to be able to live like this.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is long and wordy, but I wanted to thank you all for your <br/>
inspiration and provocative thoughts. It&#39;s working :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I strewed for my two year old last night (or at least I think this counts). I sat down with some big beads and began stringing them (he looked bored and I wanted a break anyway). Sure enough he joined in. I went on to clean a little while later and found a big egg cartoon (a 3 dozen flat) and dropped it over by my son. He started putting the beads in the different cups. If he never joined I would have had fun with the beads. If the egg carton never got a second look I would have picked it up my next go-round. Of course later I tackled him, threw him over my shoulder and gave him &#39;horsey&#39; rides on my back for a good half hour. That was not strewing. :)<br/>

================================================================<br/>
<br/>
This is definitely the mindset of the folks in my local unschooling group, and although no one used the clipping example, that&#39;s exactly what popped into my mind, too. Strewing&#39;s not like leaving a newspaper article on the breakfast table for the kids to read and report on later in however an informal way. At least not how I take it.<br/>
<br/>
Several posts today caused me to clarify my own thinking about strewing:<br/>
<br/>
Sandra: &quot;Some families would never take their kids to a play or a musical or <br/>
a concert or a dance recital.   So in those cases, if their kids go on some <br/>
field trips they&#39;ve seen more than they might have otherwise.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra: &quot;My downfall is nature.  I don&#39;t much care.  So my kids aren&#39;t out in the <br/>
woods and mountains and desert as much as they should have been in their lives for <br/>
things to be the balanced ideal (the mental image I have of the perfect <br/>
unschooling life).&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Pam: &quot;I do worry about unschooled kids and math - ONLY because so many of <br/>
their parents are so math phobic that they don&#39;t &quot;naturally&quot; support <br/>
the math learning that would otherwise ordinarily happen in an <br/>
unschooling family. I think unschooling parents have an obligation to <br/>
their children to find a way to get past their own math anxieties and <br/>
phobias.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Strewing--bringing items into my home--becomes a way not only to facilitate my kids&#39; interests but also a way of compensating for my own deficiencies, a way of exposing my kids to things that they may not encounter in a more *natural* and less conscious way. On the one hand it is a gift, like a couple people have mentioned. On the other hand, it can also be a way of potentially sparking an interest in them that they&#39;re not going to encounter by my modeling. Yes, they may &quot;bump&quot; into that interest in some other unexpected and unpredictable kind of way, but I try to have as full and rich an environment as I can possibly have to facilitate learning and interests without waiting for them to bump into things. I guess this is what I mean by a proactive approach to unschooling--that and the fact that I believe in being very involved with my kids and not just letting them do things on their own. But they&#39;re young, they may need and want my involvement less as they get older. (And as my posting demonstrates, they do a *lot* of playing on their own already.) <br/>
<br/>
The kinds of things my kids might be exposed to in my house are going to look quite different from my friends&#39; kids, for example, who are growing up in a very musical house. Some things like music, math or art, none of which are my own natural fortes, present themselves as gaps in my home that I try to fill in as many different ways as possible. I don&#39;t sit my kids down and say, &quot;okay, time to learn about math or music because otherwise you might not get it.&quot; Instead, I buy math games, strategy games, computer software that focuses on math or music, new CD&#39;s, books on ballet, videos of the Nutcracker and Swan Lake, books on artists--things I often enjoy just as much as my kids. All of this is in addition to museum trips, classes, clubs, etc. I certainly would never force these things, I don&#39;t even really suggest them unless I personally want to play/ watch/ read them, but I think leaving a gap is just as detrimental as force feeding.  What if my kids decide they *love* math? What if they missed out on knowing this for years because I didn&#39;t really try to have anything math oriented in the house because I&#39;m not a math person? Precisely because I *hate* it and shut down in pretty much the same way Sandra described, I feel a certain obligation to offer them as many fun, relaxed encounters with math as possible in case they do love it. I really hope that they never learn to hate it like I did. I use strewing in this sense to make up for my own biases and deficiencies, I guess. <br/>
<br/>
I think, absolutely, that the key to strewing is not having a vested interest in the outcome, not valuing one choice over any other choice. If I&#39;m having a party, I&#39;m definitely going to put out food that I love, but I&#39;d probably offer lots of other dishes as well to appeal to a variety of palates and people. I&#39;m not going to walk around judging the success of my party or my guests based on their food choices. Instead, I&#39;m going to walk around, talking to as many people as I can about any number of things and judge my party on how much people enjoyed themselves. Strewing, to me, is very much like having a party and offering as varied a buffet as possible from which my children freely choose and hopefully really enjoy themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for all the interesting conversations!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Strewing&#39;s not like leaving a newspaper article on the breakfast table for <br/>
the kids to read and report on later in however an informal way.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I leave articles out and nobody has to report ever.<br/>
Sometimes nobody sees them.  Sometimes someone reads the good parts aloud. <br/>
Sometimes Marty (usually it&#39;s Marty) will ask me a question about what he read, <br/>
or Holly will ask about the picture.  If nobody cares, I don&#39;t care.  If <br/>
someone cares, that&#39;s cool.<br/>
<br/>
I brought home the current New Mexico Magazine because of articles on ghosts <br/>
and ghost towns.  Holly had asked about ghost stories lately; Marty&#39;s caring <br/>
about old towns.   I read them a couple of really short things (not from the <br/>
articles, but one guy is building a FridgeHenge, a Stonehenge formation of old <br/>
refrigerators) and then I left it.  If it ends up being cut up for collages or <br/>
given away, that&#39;s fine with me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The kinds of things my kids might be exposed to in my house are going to <br/>
look quite different from my friends&#39; kids, for example, who are growing up in <br/>
a very musical house. Some things like music, math or art, none of which are <br/>
my own natural fortes, present themselves as gaps in my home that I try to fill <br/>
in as many different ways as possible. I don&#39;t sit my kids down and say, <br/>
&quot;okay, time to learn about math or music because otherwise you might not get it.&quot; <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids get music tons.<br/>
<br/>
I bought a prism.  I knew I wasn&#39;t going to do a lesson in the refraction of <br/>
light.  So I washed the window in the kitchen.  Got it really clean on both <br/>
sides. &lt;g&gt;  I set the prism in the windowsill and left it there.  <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t as exciting as it might have been if we didn&#39;t already have a <br/>
multi-faceted crystal (the round ball kinds of &quot;bavarian crystal) putting rainbows <br/>
all over the same room from time to time, but if nothing else when kids picked <br/>
it up and said &quot;cool, what&#39;s this?&quot; I&#39;d say &quot;It&#39;s a prism.  It can make <br/>
rainbows if you get light through it at the right angle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was it.  A vocabulary moment.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes that&#39;s out, sometime&#39;s it&#39;s not.  But the kids know its name.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Strewing, to me, is very much like having a party and offering as varied a <br/>
buffet as possible from which my children freely choose and hopefully really <br/>
enjoy themselves.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Great analogy!  And if you had the same party food out every single day, day <br/>
after day, people would stop eating it.  You have to have new foods to get <br/>
their interest, or at least something they haven&#39;t had for a while.  And <br/>
sometimes something they&#39;ve never ever heard of!<br/>

Can&#39;t breathe . . . laughing too hard.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Strewing often leads to follow-up activities, but follow-up <br/>
activities aren&#39;t<br/>
the strewing that was originally intended.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of an essay in one of the Sudbury Valley books, in <br/>
which the staff member (Daniel something -- I lent it out so I can&#39;t <br/>
look it up) talks about 3 kinds of learning he observes.  Everyone <br/>
goes through all three kinds.  <br/>
<br/>
1.  Curious probing -- a child picks up an interesting rock and looks <br/>
at it.  That may be all she wants to do, or she may have a few <br/>
questions or ideas about it.  (In many of the alternative schools, a <br/>
teacher would come over and say, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re interested in rocks.  <br/>
Here are some books and let&#39;s do this project and blah blah blah.&quot;  <br/>
The writer jokes that the child in the alternative school learns to <br/>
hide his interests at all costs, because they get followed-up to <br/>
death.)<br/>
<br/>
2.  Entertainment -- a perfectly respectable way to learn, but the <br/>
learning is secondary to being entertained -- and this is the form <br/>
that schools are forced to use (he says).<br/>
<br/>
3.  Following a passion -- the child doesn&#39;t want to sleep, eat, <br/>
bathe, or do anything but find out more about x, or do more x.<br/>
<br/>
Strewing seems to lend itself to curious probing.  Listening <br/>
carefully to your child about interests lends itself to encouraging <br/>
his or her passions.  Both are good, but they are different.<br/>
<br/>

This is how I fell about it.  I bring things out that I think my DD <br/>
would like to play with or look at.  Most of the time, it&#39;s &quot;stuff&quot; <br/>
that she has forgotten about because she hasn&#39;t seen it in a while.  <br/>
If she dosen&#39;t play with what I&#39;ve brought out, no big deal.  <br/>
However, most of the time, she DOES get excited and play with it.  <br/>
If a few days goes by and she hasn&#39;t touched something, I get the <br/>
hint, put it away, and bring something else out.  <br/>
<br/>
My DH and I just subscribed to National Geographic kids and the <br/>
regular one because my DD loves the pictures of the animals.  We got <br/>
the first issue the other day and she has been flipping through it <br/>
off and on for days.  I have a magazine rack with her books and <br/>
magazines on it and she pulls out what she wants to look at or <br/>
read.  But, if I just put these things away (where she couldn&#39;t see <br/>
them) how would she remember that she has them and could look at <br/>
them whenever she wanted?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see if as artifical at all.  I really look at as simply <br/>
reminding her what she has to play with.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Dagny (who&#39;s 11) was reading the message<br/>
boards the other day and read about strewing.  She thought it could be<br/>
&quot;sneaky&quot; and wanted to know if I do it.  We&#39;ve had some cool<br/>
conversations about it this week. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m never sneaky about it, I guess.  I mean outside the fact that the kids <br/>
are used to me or Keith or other friends of ours bringing something interesting <br/>
into the house.  But it&#39;s been kinda constant throughout my life anyway.   My <br/>
dad would bring cool rocks in from work, or would have something new in the <br/>
yard that he was working on.   He didn&#39;t put it there for us to find, but when <br/>
there was something new, I sure took notice.   <br/>
<br/>
Teachers would bring something to school and set it out.   Some never did <br/>
anything cooler than changing bulletin boards, but even that is something new to <br/>
see and think about.<br/>
<br/>
Holly changes her rat cage around all the time, and sure enough the rats go <br/>
and check out every little thing.<br/>
<br/>
When I taught I&#39;d very often take something to school and stick it on the <br/>
shelf without comment.   Someone would ask.  Then I&#39;d hear that person telling <br/>
someone else.  I never cared whether everyone or anyone saw it.  It was an <br/>
opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
Was it &quot;sneaky&quot;?  I think it was hugely honest and direct.   An honest and <br/>
direct rearrangement of things on earth.  For sneaky purpose?  I had no purpose <br/>
other than giving other people something new to think about.   And me too.  I <br/>
liked to see what people would do when they came upon the new thing.<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t think my kids have ever thought &quot;sneaky&quot; about finding something <br/>
new to play with appear somewhere, or something old reappear.<br/>
<br/>
We have Netflix, and I rented the 1968 Romeo & Juliet.   We have the more <br/>
recent one.   I didn&#39;t know if anyone would want to watch it with me.  Turns out, <br/>
not really.  Marty wanted a peek to see what it looked like.  Too Italian on <br/>
the costumes he said, but said the sets didn&#39;t look like Italy to him.  I said <br/>
they seemed find to me, but look at the furniture!  Look at the props!<br/>
<br/>
I wound through stopping here and there and when it got to the party scene, I <br/>
saw Michael York.  I had forgotten he&#39;s in it!  That was great.  When we <br/>
watched Logan&#39;s Run, Marty and Holly both yelled &quot;It&#39;s Basil!&quot;   So I backed up to <br/>
where he was dancing with Juliet and said &quot;Look, it&#39;s the guy from Austin <br/>
Powers&quot; and Holly said &quot;And Logan&#39;s run!&quot;  So I let the movie run.  It&#39;s a <br/>
beautiful scene, and the music&#39;s nice, and after Holly had been watching for four or <br/>
five minutes, she said &quot;HEY, was this a trick!?&quot;   I laughed.  It hadn&#39;t been <br/>
a trick, but it was working like one.  Then the phone rang and she went to <br/>
get it and the accidental trick was over.  She never did watch the rest, but she <br/>
saw enough to recognize it if she sees part of it in the future.  And she&#39;ll <br/>
know it exists in case she ever wants to watch a period-costume version.<br/>

&lt;&lt; So would strewing be the airbrush, the balloons and balloon sculpture <br/>
videos? <br/>
The kids are free to use them or not. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I think so.  I&#39;ve never used an airbrush, but if someone brought one to <br/>
my house, left it lying around and said I could play with it, I would.   <br/>
<br/>
We went to a restaurant one night and there was a clown doing balloon stuff.  <br/>
Hats.  Swords.  Holly was fascinated.  She said someday she wanted to do <br/>
that.  So I got her a handpump and some balloons and a booklet.  She did it every <br/>
day for a while, and made things for her friends and it was cool.   She has <br/>
said she might like to do it again sometime at the playgroup she goes to.  Her <br/>
pump broke and she&#39;s out of balloons.  They dry up quickly here in the dry <br/>
heat.   I should put that on my list of things to do when I&#39;m out and about. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think any of that was strewing, it was following up her stated <br/>
interest.<br/>
<br/>
But if I left a balloon pump, balloons and a book at someone&#39;s house where <br/>
nobody had expressed interest in that before, that would be, I think, strewing.<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday we watched some of the extra features from Monty Python and <br/>
the Holy Grail, and they have the giant rabbit scene in Japanese.    They build <br/>
a rabbit (Trojan horse style) and leave it outside the gate.  The French come <br/>
out and wheel it in.<br/>

That was strewing. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

**I understand what you&#39;re saying.  <br/>
 <br/>
In our house things move around a lot and new things are always coming<br/>
in and living on the dining room table (or in the bathroom or wherever)<br/>
for a while, and old things coming back out from wherever they&#39;ve been.<br/>
It happens naturally, and we all do it, not just me.   It&#39;s a priority<br/>
to us to keep life interesting and fresh and look at it with our eyes<br/>
wide open.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t consciously leave things in the kids&#39; paths to expose them to<br/>
potential interest.   I&#39;ve never thought &#39;we&#39;re lacking in mathy things&#39;<br/>
and made a point of buying &quot;math games, strategy games, computer<br/>
software that focuses on math&quot;, as Danielle said.  I don&#39;t really think<br/>
in those terms, so I guess what&#39;s natural for some people would just be<br/>
contrived for me.<br/>
 <br/>
Sandra said yesterday: <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If their lives are rich enough, then they are! <br/>
 </span></blockquote>But as a way to suggest to new unschoolers that they CAN enrich their<br/>
lives, <br/>
it&#39;s a trick or tool to help them see what will happen if they leave<br/>
something <br/>
new in the environment.<br/>
 <br/>
**This makes sense to me. I feel confident that our lives are rich and<br/>
full enough that we&#39;re all exposed to a happy variety.  ~Rue <br/>

Frost free refrigerator in the desert?  Things dry up.  Lettuce dehydrates.   <br/>

You probably get mold if things stay too long.  We get dehydrated cheese, <br/>

Frost free refrigerator in the desert?  Things dry up.  Lettuce dehydrates.   <br/>
<br/>
You probably get mold if things stay too long.  We get dehydrated cheese, <br/>
former lettuce, tortillas that have turned to chips if the plastic wasn&#39;t <br/>
sealed <br/>
well.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

<br/>
Strange place, that desert of yours!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in a bowl/bag of water in the &#39;frig&#39;?<br/>
