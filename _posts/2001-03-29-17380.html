<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938475686">Hi, I don&#39;t post a whole lot, but I had to respond to this.<br/>
<br/>
Please keep in mind that this is my experience only, others may have other<br/>
stories to tell.<br/>
<br/>
All the research I&#39;ve read all points to the same thing: tv-watching,<br/>
especially in the younger children, DOES affect the way their brain<br/>
develops.  In short, it makes them receptors and passive in-takers of<br/>
information, rather than active, analytical, etc.<br/>
<br/>
At least that&#39;s my take on what I&#39;ve read lately and admittedly, it&#39;s a<br/>
simplistic view of a very complex issue.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, with my own almost-3yo daughter, when we started limiting her<br/>
tv-watching to one hour per day or less, within 1 week (really, I&#39;m not<br/>
exagerating here), we had a calmer child, one who wasn&#39;t bouncing off the<br/>
walls all of the time.  We also watched her imagination take flight, because<br/>
if the tv wasn&#39;t on, she had to entertain herself, and all of a sudden, her<br/>
animals had lives and personalities, and she started doing all of the things<br/>
the early childhood development books say is normal childhood activities for<br/>
almost-3yolds.<br/>
<br/>
I will also say that part of this, I believe, is not because we turned off<br/>
the tv, but because of where she is developmentally, but I think turning off<br/>
the tv, and putting a limit on it for Ripley was one of the best things we<br/>
could have done as a family.<br/>
<br/>
I will also say that before we did this, I made sure my art supplies and<br/>
everything else were all present and accounted for, so that when Ripley<br/>
asked for the tv, I could present her with other activities.<br/>
<br/>
I like the tv.  I like movies.  I like being able to watch stuff both for<br/>
learning and for non.  I do not like tv for noise, for companionship, for<br/>
filler.  There&#39;s so much to do with other activities and other people!<br/>
<br/>
Again, I say this is all my own personal experience and opinions, so please<br/>
keep that in your mind.<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer, in Fort Worth, it looks like the rain&#39;s stopped again!</div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I think there is something to the idea that 
everyone reacts differently to TV.&nbsp; My stepson is a child that should not 
watch TV.&nbsp; He cannot distinguish reality and he is consumed by the 
programming.&nbsp; He also watches things (not in my house) that are 
damaging/violent and acts&nbsp;out that type of behavior.&nbsp; Whereas my son 
would rather the tv not be on and if he does&nbsp;choose to watch 
something,&nbsp;he prefers an &quot;educational&quot; type program or something where the 
conflict isn&#39;t so harsh.&nbsp; But these children also come&nbsp;from two very 
different households.&nbsp; His&nbsp;&quot;real&quot; mother is prone to violent 
outbursts.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I wonder if&nbsp;at a younger age a child will more 
likely watch a show that in someway reflects their real life situation.&nbsp;

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372480590"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Based on the fact that I know many highly intelligent people who were raised <br/>
&gt; on television I don&#39;t buy the popular research, not completely.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to say this describes me perfectly.  When I was growing up, <br/>
my mom was divorced, working two jobs to support us, and I <br/>
watched as much tv as I wanted.  I don&#39;t ever remember being told I <br/>
couldn&#39;t watch a particular program or that I had been sitting in front <br/>
of the tv too long.  My favorite programs were The Waltons, Eight is <br/>
Enough, Marcus Welby M.D. (I&#39;m showing my age now), Love <br/>
Boat, The Brady Bunch ( I know, I know), but I didn&#39;t have a father <br/>
or any brothers and sisters, didn&#39;t have a clue what a &quot;normal&quot; <br/>
family was supposed to be like, and was starving for love and <br/>
attention.  TV filled the void for me, I got from it what I needed.  <br/>
I also watched lots of gorry murder mysteries.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s the key.  If children are not emotionally needy, they <br/>
aren&#39;t going to cling to it.  Perhaps when they are little, they might <br/>
watch lots of it because they are just fascinated, but as they get <br/>
older, they find that it doesn&#39;t fill them, because they are already <br/>
filled.  And calm down, I&#39;m not saying that if your kids cling to the <br/>
TV that you are a bad mom, and not meeting your kids emotional <br/>
needs.  Sometimes they have needs that aren&#39;t readily apparent, <br/>
that we don&#39;t know about.  Observing what they watch may show <br/>
you a pattern as to WHY they are watching, what they are trying to <br/>
get from it.  It could be a useful diagnostic tool.<br/>
<br/>
And even though I watched television constantly as a child (my <br/>
grandfather insisted the television HAD to be on all the time, if we <br/>
turned it off he threw a royal fit) I am very intelligent, went to <br/>
college, got two degrees, and even though I still love tv, it is turned <br/>
off a large percentage of the time in our home, and it has not <br/>
stunted my intellectual or emotional growth.  I have a very inquiring <br/>
mind, read books constantly, and did not become a serial killer <br/>
because I watched violence on tv.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me put in my two cents.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The book I read Jane Healy&#39;s Endangered Minds that<br/>
mirrors what you said above...But even she says TV is<br/>
only PART of the problem. The other part is families<br/>
not being an active part of facilitating their<br/>
children&#39;s learning/being and active part of their<br/>
children&#39;s lives. The other part I don&#39;t think she<br/>
takes into account is compulsory learning IMO is<br/>
really no different in brain development process than<br/>
TV.<br/>
<br/>
But and unschooled child chooses to watch, read, do<br/>
what ever they are doing. So they are in charge of the<br/>
learning what they are processing from the TV. And in<br/>
an unschooled familiy kids are doing more than just<br/>
watching TV even the ones who watch a lot. They help<br/>
mom and dad cook dinner, they do projects, they read,<br/>
play computer games, go outside and collect bugs<br/>
etc...they are a real part of the life of their<br/>
families household. At least that the experience in my<br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
Samantha<br/>
who does think most of whats on TV is crap, has a<br/>
defacto limit on TV in that we don&#39;t get cable because<br/>
of financial limits and don&#39;t care for most of the<br/>
programming. But if we could just get Discovery and<br/>
few favored programs we would love to ..but kids can<br/>
do a marathon magic school bus video day and PBS line<br/>
up day and the next day spend time outside.. <br/>

want REASONS to say no, and there are lots of traditional shared-around lies <br/>
which parents use to say &quot;NO&quot; with, and some of the current ones are those <br/>
psuedo scientific anti-TV books.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid chocolate would give you exzema (sp?) and French fries would <br/>
make your face break out and caffein would stunt your growth.<br/>
<br/>
I work consciously not to tell my kids such boogie-man stories.<br/>

  <div><br></div><tt><br><br><br>&gt; Based on the fact that I know many highly 
  intelligent people who were raised <br>&gt; on television I don&#39;t buy the 
  popular research, not completely.<br><br>I have to say this describes me 
  perfectly.&nbsp; When I was growing up, <br>my mom was divorced, working two 
  jobs to support us, and I <br>watched as much tv as I wanted.&nbsp; I don&#39;t 
  ever remember being told I <br>couldn&#39;t watch a particular program or that I 
  had been sitting in front <br>of the tv too long.&nbsp; My favorite programs 
  were The Waltons, Eight is <br>Enough, Marcus Welby M.D. (I&#39;m showing my age 
  now), Love <br>Boat, The Brady Bunch ( I know, I know), but I didn&#39;t have a 
  father <br>or any brothers and sisters, didn&#39;t have a clue what a &quot;normal&quot; 
  <br>family was supposed to be like, and was starving for love and 
  <br>attention.&nbsp; TV filled the void for me, I got from it what I 
  needed.&nbsp; <br>I also watched lots of gorry murder mysteries.<br><br>I 
  think that&#39;s the key.&nbsp; If children are not emotionally needy, they 
  <br>aren&#39;t going to cling to it.&nbsp; Perhaps when they are little, they 
  might <br>watch lots of it because they are just fascinated, but as they get 
  <br>older, they find that it doesn&#39;t fill them, because they are already 
  <br>filled.&nbsp; And calm down, I&#39;m not saying that if your kids cling to the 
  <br>TV that you are a bad mom, and not meeting your kids emotional 
  <br>needs.&nbsp; Sometimes they have needs that aren&#39;t readily apparent, 
  <br>that we don&#39;t know about.&nbsp; Observing what they watch may show <br>you 
  a pattern as to WHY they are watching, what they are trying to <br>get from 
  it.&nbsp; It could be a useful diagnostic tool.<br><br>And even though I 
  watched television constantly as a child (my <br>grandfather insisted the 
  television HAD to be on all the time, if we <br>turned it off he threw a royal 
  fit) I am very intelligent, went to <br>college, got two degrees, and even 
  though I still love tv, it is turned <br>off a large percentage of the time in 
  our home, and it has not <br>stunted my intellectual or emotional 
  growth.&nbsp; I have a very inquiring <br>mind, read books constantly, and did 
  not become a serial killer <br>because I watched violence on tv.<br><br>Thanks 
  for letting me put in my two cents.<br><br><br><br><br>Judie <br></tt><br><br><tt>Message

it such power over my kids, myself and my family.  We do tv.  We do more<br/>
or less depending on circumstances.  WE have been tv free, too.  But I<br/>
have learned that it is not only WRONG it is damaging to put my personal<br/>
hangups and preferences on the shoulders of my kids.  Plus, I rather<br/>
appreciate that my kids *aren&#39;t* the ones glued to tv, insipid tv at that,<br/>
when we are out because they know they will get to see it at other times.  <br/>
I&#39;m happy that my kids have the chance to develop discerning tastes of<br/>
their own.<br/>
