<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243422910">Thank you to everybody who sent me soap info.  It was all very <br/>
helpful.  Unfortunately, lye is illegal here...  ...  ...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have time to join a soap list - I don*t even have time to<br/>
read <br/>
all the messages on this list.  I just read what looks interesting on <br/>
the web.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, does anyone know why I have ads attached to the messages I send <br/>
out?  Does onelist automatically do that?  Or hotmail?  Or do I have<br/>
a <br/>
computer virus???<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
