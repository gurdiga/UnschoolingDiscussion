<div id="ygrps-yiv-874338262">I&#39;m Sue and I live in Winona MN, here on the farm we are trying to <br/>
get a place for unschoolers to be able to visit and enjoy each <br/>
others company while getting a farm experience.  We have only <br/>
had 15 family groups and 3 single visitors and it would really good <br/>
to have more unschoolers visit.   We only charge a very moderate <br/>
fee for people to stay.   <br/>
<br/>
It can be very difficult to meet other unschoolers and for some <br/>
trying to figure out if unschooling works it may be good to meet a <br/>
family living unschooling.    It is also a great place for city kids to <br/>
get a chance to roam freely and get in touch with nature.<br/>
<br/>
My partner Dick Gallien bought the farm in 1956, he was a <br/>
teacher in many experimental programes in the 60s and concluded <br/>
that the system just can&#39;t work.  My children Nathan[15], <br/>
Rhianon[11], Madeleine[6] and Stephanie[4]  and I came here from <br/>
Australia two years ago and now call Winona &quot;Home&quot;.    Here they <br/>
are free to explore from the top of the hills right down to the trout <br/>
streams and beaver pond and all the interesting places in between. <br/>
They spend endless hours doing the things that generations of <br/>
children enjoyed, until school imprisoned their minds and bodies for <br/>
twelve years or more.  They look, listen and touch, then think about <br/>
their experiences and ask many questions about the things <br/>
unfamiliar to them.  They learn without being taught, without <br/>
coercion, threats or bribes and they enjoy it.  <br/>
<br/>
The farm is open to visitors all year round.   There is a self <br/>
contained apartment in the house,  for that we charge $2.50 a night <br/>
for adults & $1 a night for children.  We have lots of space for <br/>
camping, at a charge of $1 a night for adults & 50c for children. We <br/>
have two cabins, for home/unschoolers on Sunday through <br/>
Thursday nights [except public holidays] we charge $10 a night for <br/>
adults & $5 a night for children [these cabins rent out to tourists for <br/>
between $75 to $300 per night which is why we need to keep them <br/>
open on weekends].    The small amount of money we  make from <br/>
charging unschoolers goes into improving the accommodations and <br/>
providing amenities for campers.  <br/>
Most visitors like to assist with tasks and their help is very <br/>
welcome.<br/>
<br/>
The farm is 175 acres of diverse land, from the trout streams at the <br/>
lowest point in the valley to 600&#39; hills.   Only 55 acres is tillable <br/>
land, the rest is returning to a natural state and is a haven for a <br/>
variety of wildlife.<br/>
<br/>
We have an assortment of animals, four beef cows, and their <br/>
calves, two of which are heifers that should be having their first <br/>
calves soon, 12 holstein steers ranging in age from 6 weeks to two <br/>
years... these are bottle reared by Nathan [15], 2 of the biggest <br/>
sows in the world and 1 not so big boar [we hope for piglets <br/>
eventually if Ms Pig and Miss Piggy aren&#39;t too overweight to carry <br/>
babies], 24 sheep and 26 lambs, 9 saanen goats and their 7 kids, <br/>
3 angora goats, & one little alpine buck who we bought to improve <br/>
the milking potential of the future generations, 3 jersey wooly <br/>
rabbits, 1 just plain rabbit, 1 cat and her 3 kittens.   My girls milk <br/>
only one of the goats, but plan on milking more next year, they use <br/>
the milk to bottle feed three kids.  We also have 5 Canada geese <br/>
with 4 goslings so far but more due to hatch any day, 6 domestic <br/>
geese, 3 turkeys and 4 turkey poults, 6 ducks and 15 ducklings, <br/>
and too many chickens and chicks to count. <br/>
<br/>
We are also the local compost site and visiting locals feed their <br/>
grass clippings right to the cattle, and their brush to the sheep and <br/>
goats.   We also collect food waste from the local hospital and <br/>
university and a better class of food waste from a supermarket in <br/>
town.   The food waste from the hospital and university is at <br/>
present composted with ground up brush, grass clippings and <br/>
cattle manure, however we are working on a way of cooking it at <br/>
212 for 30 minutes so that it can be legally fed to animals.  The <br/>
outdated produce, baked, frozen & dairy goods from the <br/>
supermarket are fed to the animals, we rear the calves on out <br/>
dated milk and only buy chicken feed to get the chicks started.<br/>
<br/>
We have three incubators that hold 288 eggs and a hatcher, so <br/>
every six days we fill an incubator, and every six days we start a <br/>
new hatch.  We have incubated ducks, geese, turkeys and <br/>
thousands of chicks.   We sell eggs here on the farm and at the <br/>
local co-op and sell chickens to the Hmongs.<br/>
<br/>
Our third compost pile is percolating now, it is about 60&#39;X20&#39;X10&#39; <br/>
not as big as the last two which are now mainly spread on the <br/>
fields, with a little in the yard awaiting my vegetable garden.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-656401694">It is so good to hear of other homeschoolers doing these things. We (dh and me,<br/>
plus 4 sons aged 19, 16, 13 & 10) have just mooved to a 16 acre block of land,<br/>
which is about 12 - 13 acres native bush (forest? woodlands? - these don&#39;t<br/>
really describe it properly) with a stream running through the middle of it. We<br/>
are living in the garage plus room that we built before we moved, and are now<br/>
trying to build the house, but the weather has been rain, rain, rain. (It is<br/>
winter here in New Zealand) The only animals we have so far are the 2 rabbits<br/>
and cat we brought with us, and a delightful puppy ds #3 got for his 13th<br/>
birthday 2 weeks ago. As vegetarians, we aren&#39;t planning on animals beyond<br/>
poultry for eggs, and a few goats to keep the gorse down. As Karen says, we<br/>
don&#39;t have much in the way of wild animals here in NZ but we are priveleged to<br/>
have a pair of keruru or native pigeon, living in our bush. These are very<br/>
large and lovely birds, which are protected now, but are still poached by<br/>
people who find them good eating.<br/>
<br/>
We are about to start planting trees and are looking forward to getting our<br/>
gardens started come spring.<br/>

&gt; all sides, including Amish across the road.  We, too, hope to keep it from<br/>
&gt; being developed, but are putting off doing it until our son gets older and<br/>
&gt; we have more time.  I am gradually introducing native wildflowers to the<br/>
&gt; meadow, and eventually hope to do the same in the woods.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have 3 Scottish Black Face Sheep, 6 chikens, 2 dogs, 6 cats.  A pair of<br/>
&gt; Canada Geese nest on the pond every year, and a Great Blue Heron fishes<br/>
&gt; there regularly.  Something eats the goslings, though, which makes me very<br/>
&gt; sad.  Could be a fox, which we have, or a snapping turtle, which we may or<br/>
&gt; may not have.  Also, a possum frequents the barn and decimated our flock of<br/>
&gt; banty hens.  We  now have them in a hen house, but, I think the banties<br/>
&gt; aren ot happy being cooped up, even though they have a run.  Do you know<br/>
&gt; anything about banties?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488478365">Hey Karen - ring me on 825 7980 if you&#39;d like to come and visit - on a fine day,<br/>
because it&#39;s a bit cramped in our shed on a wet day! We&#39;re only 1/2 an hour from<br/>
Dinsdale, at Te Mata, on the way to Raglan. Did you used to live in<br/>
Morrinsville? If so I think you rang me once quite a while ago.<br/>
