This sounds like a great job!  Where does he travel to?  I love riding trains <br/>
and wish they hadn&#39;t stopped the Desert Wind and that one what went to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781366309">Hi Valerie<br/>
<br/>
Thought the post was about sneezes...but that is Ah<br/>
Choos....<br/>
<br/>
Schedule is the pits. It changes constantly. He goes<br/>
to work at 3pm or 2am or 6am or whenever is gone for<br/>
24 hours (at least) or a week, but usually about 3<br/>
days(and nights). Off time is 24 consecutive hours<br/>
supposedly once per week. If the 24 hours starts at<br/>
noon it is over at noon the next day, so that there is<br/>
not a complete daylight off day. At the moment (for<br/>
last month) his schedule allows 2 complete daylight<br/>
daysand one night in between every other week.  <br/>
<br/>
Met another RR wife who suggested a support group.  I<br/>
told her that would be fun, except we could never<br/>
schedule any meetings. DH and I have been married 9<br/>
years and I still haven&#39;t adapted.......<br/>
<br/>
He runs trains in the SE from Jacksonville, FL.  Today<br/>
he is in Pensacola, FL.  He left day before yesterday,<br/>
dunno when he&#39;ll be back, exactly. <br/>
<br/>
His back was broken 4 years ago when the locomotive he<br/>
was running became airborne when it hit a truck that<br/>
was stuck on the track in Savannah, GA. He did have<br/>
about a year off then, when he was unable to work (or<br/>
anything else).  Then he had 6 months off two years<br/>
ago for the cancer surgery and the recuperation from<br/>
that. <br/>
<br/>
He is saddened that he is not able to do more in a<br/>
patriotic sense. <br/>
<br/>
He does like running large noisy machines so it is a<br/>
good job for him....I wouldn&#39;t like it....I don&#39;t like<br/>
large noisy machines. And I wouldn&#39;t enjoy being<br/>
unavialable to the children that I feel need me. Still<br/>
trains do have a romantic aura and the coaches aren&#39;t<br/>
in close proximity to the engines...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry the answer to your question is so long, but<br/>
actually, the schedule question is dificult (in more<br/>
ways than one) and the reference to &quot;Great job&quot; is a<br/>
from point of view.....depends on what you compare it<br/>
to.......<br/>
