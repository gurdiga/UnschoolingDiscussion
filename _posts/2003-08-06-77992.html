<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044004989">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t be more excited!  I just heard from Kaycee (her prepaid cell phone is <br/>
one of the only cell phone&#39;s working PERIOD!  The only other one is Don <br/>
Whittrock&#39;s --  the person in charge of the Junior Volunteer Program at Cin. Mus. <br/>
Center & his is a contract phone).  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s have a GREAT TIME!  Today, they got to go to the TOP of a mountain <br/>
where they &quot;played&quot; in the snow, & found an ice cave.  Then, they went back down <br/>
to the desert (one girl got sick from the heat, but is OK now).  She said &quot;she <br/>
can&#39;t wait for us to see the video she took&quot; (I let her take my camcorder; <br/>
it&#39;s old, hasn&#39;t been used in years, so I do hope it works still) and I said, <br/>
&quot;Oh, so you are ready to come home.&quot;  Her response:  &quot;no, I&#39;ll just ship the tape <br/>
to you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The dig is going very well.  They have bones that were just found, and must <br/>
be plastered first before being dug from the ground.  Very long, tedious, work, <br/>
apparently.<br/>
<br/>
She said the weather out there has been great!  No thunderstorms or rain, <br/>
which they&#39;ve been having lots of lately!  And, of course, she just couldn&#39;t say <br/>
enough about how beautiful Montana, the Big Horn Mountain Range--where the Dig <br/>
site is, and everything else in general is!  Can&#39;t wait to see the video <br/>
(hoping we can have it transferred onto VCR, then DVD) and pictures.  Maybe by the <br/>
time she gets home & we get the film developed, I&#39;ll be able to have the <br/>
scanner back up and running and I can post some of them!<br/>
<br/>
It sounds as if all is going well for her.  I&#39;m so glad she thinks enough of <br/>
me to call.  It&#39;s nice when your kids do that!<br/>
<br/>
Will keep you all updated!<br/>
<br/>

PS:  If you got doubles of this e-mail, I apologize.  AOL is really messed up <br/>
right now, & has been adding addresses (some there already, some not) to my <br/>
address book w/out me knowing.  I wanted to make sure I sent the update to all <br/>
who knew what is going on w/Kaycee!  I&#39;ll try to get this mess cleaned out in <br/>
the next couple of days!  <br/>
