<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504382751">Kids wanting to return to school...<br/>
<br/>
This is something we all might face, and not without anguish. The responses<br/>
from this list will reveal both our deepest concerns about public school and<br/>
our deepest desires for our particular alternative of<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling. I hope this list can help.<br/>
<br/>
Your relationship with your daughter is the most important consideration.<br/>
She needs to know, above all else, that you are on her side, that you trust<br/>
her judgment, and want only her happiness. If she feels that she can get<br/>
those things from attending the school, your position becomes one of<br/>
supporting her decision. (not supporting her, or worse, arguing about it,<br/>
can be the beginning of a life-long rift between you and her. You are at a<br/>
crossroad now)<br/>
<br/>
However, her decision needs to be based on a clear evaluation of her<br/>
expectations. It will help you to know why she wants to return. She needs to<br/>
be open to telling you what those reasons are, if only to help you to accept<br/>
her choice. That should not be too much to ask of her. It is just possible<br/>
that her needs are not being met by the home experience. In that case, you<br/>
might find that she could, after all, meet those needs with a different<br/>
&quot;arrangement&quot; in her life at home.<br/>
<br/>
(she might feel that going to school offers a new type of &quot;freedom&quot; when in<br/>
fact it is still prison. If she needs freedom, then you can probably help<br/>
her gain more of it, without going to the school.<br/>
<br/>
Then, if she does stick to her decision of going, and those reasons are not<br/>
satisfied by her attendance, then you can have another talk about staying or<br/>
leaving, later. It will probably help her to know that if things do not go<br/>
as she now hopes, she will always be free to change plans again, because the<br/>
idea is not to finish something just because it was started, but to find the<br/>
best way to get where you want to go.<br/>
