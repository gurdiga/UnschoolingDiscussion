&lt;&lt; Hi Sheila, I am in Washington state. Why? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because every state has different laws. We can&#39;t give you advice about <br/>
documentation if we don&#39;t know your laws.<br/>
It varies a lot from state to state. In some, you don&#39;t have to do anything.<br/>

spoon;<br/>
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>
