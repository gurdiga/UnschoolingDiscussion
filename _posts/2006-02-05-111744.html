You might want to check out AlwaysUnschooled, also a Yahoo group.  <br/>
It&#39;s for parents of young children...most are not as young as yours,  <br/>
but you wouldn&#39;t be the only one there thinking ahead. At the  <br/>
AlwaysUnschooled Yahoo site there are links and a book list.<br/>
<br/>
On AlwaysUnschooled, we talk a lot about unschooling&#39;s relationship  <br/>
to parenting, and address topics that come up more regularly for  <br/>
those of us with really little ones (I think it&#39;s been awhile since  <br/>
there&#39;s been a thread here on UnschoolingDiscussion about dealing  <br/>
with kids grabbing toys away from each other, or not wanting to poop  <br/>
in the potty). And we do a monthly book chat you might like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733747115">Unschooling your infant and toddler is the best part of unschooling. Don&#39;t<br/>
buy flash cards, don&#39;t buy language tapes, don&#39;t buy anything!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Okay, buy some stuff, buy different sizes of balls, a couple books but when<br/>
it comes down to it you are the best toy your child will ever have at this<br/>
age. When it came to unschooling - I got it until it came to kindergarten.<br/>
Do what comes naturally. sing, talk and play.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Let your child lead you - as long as she isn&#39;t in danger let her crawl,<br/>
laugh, play.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My children one boy who is now five and a half was quite and absorbed life<br/>
as an infant. He walked at a little over 13 months and was amazed at our<br/>
happy response. I talked to him a lot every where we went even if people<br/>
thought I was crazy. I never used baby talk. My point of view is why make<br/>
children work harder then they need to? Teach one word and stick with it. My<br/>
mom still calls medicine - meems. I don&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, he still usually takes much in stride. I am never sure what he gets<br/>
from any activity we participate in, anything he watches or conversations we<br/>
have. He always looks like he is paying attention to something only he can<br/>
hear. Then days, weeks and sometimes months later he will ask me some<br/>
question or tell me something that makes me think to myself, &quot;WOW! He got<br/>
it!&quot; It just occurred to me why he doesn&#39;t play with the spelling stuff he<br/>
has - some how he just gets it and he doesn&#39;t need the stuff he has - he<br/>
needs something at a higher level. (Okay that was that a really schooly<br/>
statement? Anyone want to give me better verbage?)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In short my son is a thinker - then comes his sister who is almost 14<br/>
months. She is my doer. She doesn&#39;t stop moving even when she is sleeping.<br/>
She is surrounded by her brother, and three cousins 6, 7, and 9 and sees all<br/>
they are doing and she can&#39;t wait to join in. She lifted her head early, sat<br/>
up and walked just before a year.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She loves finger songs and books and is amazingly gentle even with paper<br/>
books. She loves emptying any container and amazing to me anyway she is<br/>
getting the concept that you don&#39;t put everything in your mouth. She gets<br/>
that crayons put color on paper though I see some wall battles as a<br/>
possibility.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Well, sorry to babble on for so long. you sound a lot like me. I was<br/>
pregnant and knew I was going to unschool until my son told me he wanted to<br/>
go to school. I figure he will probably make that mistake a couple times but<br/>
only a couple weeks this time around and we were back to unschooling. If you<br/>
have any direct questions or even want someone to talk to - let me know<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:dragteine@...">dragteine@...</a>). I am full of ideas and I can be your bouncing board<br/>
so you don&#39;t make the same mistakes I have made - like buying things that<br/>
you find out your children will never use or that you really don&#39;t need.<br/>

==================<br/>
<br/>
One day when Kirby was a toddler, his dad said carefully and clearly,  <br/>
&quot;Kirby, close the cabinet.&quot; Kirby gazed back with no understanding.  <br/>
Keith tried again sweetly: &quot;Close the cabinet!&quot; Nothing. I saw the  <br/>
impasse, and said quickly, &quot;Kirby, shut the door.&quot; He lit up with  <br/>
recognition and SLAM, it was done.<br/>
<br/>
That day, I decided to try to use more than one word when I  <br/>
communicated with my kids. I knew that in England, after the Norman  <br/>
conquest, simple legal matters had been be stated in English and  <br/>
French both, and some of those phrases still exist, like &quot;will and  <br/>
testament,&quot; &quot;aid and abet,&quot; &quot;give and bequeath,&quot; and &quot;null and void.&quot;  <br/>
So for the sake of my children understanding both my child-of-Texans  <br/>
self AND my child-of-Bostonians husband (Boston and Michigan and  <br/>
Canada, but NOT Texas), I began to paraphrase. &quot;Kirby, can you hand  <br/>
me that blue cup? The plastic mug that&#39;s on the counter?&quot; Or &quot;Let&#39;s  <br/>
go to the park, okay? We&#39;ll walk down to the swings and picnic tables.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize how much I was doing it, and how naturally, until I  <br/>
started doing it in adult conversations. So I backed off, because by  <br/>
then my youngest was five anyway.<br/>
<br/>
=================<br/>
<br/>
I love English and I love natural learning, so I couldn&#39;t let &quot;Teach  <br/>
one word&quot; sit on the table here without picking it up and turning it  <br/>
over.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771023606">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a mostly-lurker here, mom to 9mo Dmitri and active over on the Always<br/>
Unschooled board.<br/>
<br/>
Shannon wrote:<br/>
&lt;&lt;Don&#39;t buy flash cards, don&#39;t buy language tapes, don&#39;t buy anything!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why not?  Pre-Dmitri, I couldn&#39;t stand the &quot;teachy&quot; agenda of flashcards and<br/>
videos like the Baby Einstein series.  Post-Dmitri, and in large part thanks<br/>
to the folks over at Always Unschooled, I realize that my reaction is my<br/>
problem.  Dmitri actually likes the set of flashcards that I got for him<br/>
because they have textures and colors and are occasionally fun to chew.  I<br/>
don&#39;t sit and try to teach him, but I do try to keep a more open mind about<br/>
what might be interesting and stimulating for him.  We tried a Baby Einstein<br/>
video from Netflix--he didn&#39;t like it, but I no longer harbor fears that I<br/>
have to shield him from such things.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Okay, buy some stuff, buy different sizes of balls, a couple books but<br/>
when it comes down to it you are the best toy your child will ever have at<br/>
this age.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I find this to be true up to a point.  Before Dmitri arrived, dh and I<br/>
didn&#39;t think he would need a lot of material objects.  We envisioned a few<br/>
&quot;natural&quot; wood and fabric toys, organic cotton teething dolls, you get the<br/>
picture.  Now each room in our home has a colorful jumble of things to play<br/>
with.  I agree that dh and I are the best playmates for Dmitri right now,<br/>
but it&#39;s a lot of fun for us to have a variety of objects (found, donated,<br/>
bought, scavenged) to play with together.  I think strewing is just as<br/>
important for babies as it is for older kids.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Julie B<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the &quot;why&quot; behind the strewing is important. If you have <br/>
flashcards in with the puzzles and the blocks and the books and the <br/>
cars, with no expectation that one is better than the other, or that <br/>
flashcards will &quot;teach&quot; the child something, then they become just <br/>
another plaything (or &quot;manipulative&quot;)in the house. <br/>
<br/>
The &quot;danger&quot; in strewing schooly things comes when the parent isnt <br/>
really all that convinced about unschooling, and when they place a <br/>
higher priority on learning that &quot;looks educational&quot; than learning <br/>
that is simply fun. If the workbook is right next to the comic book, <br/>
and the parent is truly ok with either being chosen, thats great. But <br/>
if the parent isnt quite there yet, it might be better to not have the <br/>
workbook around, esp if the child really isnt hot for workbooks anyway.<br/>
<br/>
With babies, if there is a limited amount of money in which to buy <br/>
toys, i can think of many better choices than flashcards <br/>
or &quot;educational&quot; items geared toward &quot;teaching language development&quot; <br/>
or &quot;making your baby smarter&quot;..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460667799">I agree with you, Julie!<br/>
<br/>
Kids learn from picking things up and turning them over, feeling  <br/>
them, seeing what noise they make, being surprised at how heavy or  <br/>
light they are.   That&#39;s just as true of teens as of babies though  <br/>
teens are WAY less likely to taste the objects. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
(I have another note below the quote.)<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;Okay, buy some stuff, buy different sizes of balls, a couple  <br/>
&gt; books but<br/>
&gt; when it comes down to it you are the best toy your child will ever  <br/>
&gt; have at<br/>
&gt; this age.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I find this to be true up to a point.  Before Dmitri arrived, dh and I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t think he would need a lot of material objects.  We  <br/>
&gt; envisioned a few<br/>
&gt; &quot;natural&quot; wood and fabric toys, organic cotton teething dolls, you  <br/>
&gt; get the<br/>
&gt; picture.  Now each room in our home has a colorful jumble of things  <br/>
&gt; to play<br/>
&gt; with.  I agree that dh and I are the best playmates for Dmitri  <br/>
&gt; right now,<br/>
&gt; but it&#39;s a lot of fun for us to have a variety of objects (found,  <br/>
&gt; donated,<br/>
&gt; bought, scavenged) to play with together.  I think strewing is just as<br/>
&gt; important for babies as it is for older kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An article recently about simplicity had a couple of items at which I  <br/>
balked strongly, due to changes in my thinking over these parenting  <br/>
and unschooling years.  One was this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t let any material thing into your home unless you absolutely  <br/>
love it and want to keep it until it is beyond repair.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Okay... #1, would that include magazines (in which the advice was  <br/>
published)?<br/>
<br/>
#2,  If one&#39;s goal is to have the most spartan home of all her  <br/>
friends, that might be great advice.  I&#39;m not living by myself,  <br/>
though, and my own goal is to have a learning nest.<br/>
<br/>
#3, what if you love and intend to keep it and it will never be  <br/>
beyond repair in the foreseeable future?  We have some great rocks,  <br/>
and a few wooden toys so sturdy that nothing but fire would be likely  <br/>
to harm them.<br/>
<br/>
#4, what if you get something, keep it for a few months, and pass it  <br/>
on to someone else, or give it to a thrift store?  I&#39;m thinking of  <br/>
magazines I&#39;ve bought for a quarter to read an article in, and passed  <br/>
back to the charity collection, or of costumes Holly has gotten, worn  <br/>
once, known she would have grown out of it by the time she might wear  <br/>
it again, so we basically rented it from the thrift shop; no  <br/>
problem!   What about buying something like a tin with a lid that you  <br/>
know you will NOT keep, but that you&#39;ll use a while and then give  <br/>
away, full of cookies?<br/>
<br/>
I just thought it was bad advice in light of the way our own lives  <br/>
are lived.<br/>
<br/>
That was the first item in a list of ten.<br/>
The last item was &quot;Practice saying no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OH HUH!  Most parents don&#39;t need to practice that!  But the point the  <br/>
author was making was to say no to things outside the family (job  <br/>
promotions or social activities) in favor of being more attentive to  <br/>
your family.  So it redeemed itself. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I find a little fellow who&#39;s cute and yellow and chub-by<br/>
Rub-a-dub-dubby<br/>
<br/>
Rubber Duckie means something, and it uses &quot;tubby.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Teletubbies uses &quot;tubby&quot; and means something completely different.<br/>
<br/>
My kids had no trouble learning all that, and I bet none of yours  <br/>
will either.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We still teach children language by the language we model. -=-<br/>

If you insist on defending ideas about &quot;teaching,&quot; that means you see  <br/>
yourself as a teacher.<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t &quot;have my children&quot; learn anything.  I helped keep their  <br/>
world active and swirly, they heard me speak, heard songs, played  <br/>
with other children, talked with other adults, watched videos, TV  <br/>
shows, movies, played rhyming games, and they have NO problems with  <br/>
vocabulary whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
Limiting to &quot;only real words&quot; is more limiting than I think you  <br/>
intend to be.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking to children in real, respectful ways and sharing information  <br/>
with them as you would with a friend is a fantastic idea.   <br/>
Withholding baby words out of a sense of efficiency, or of not  <br/>
cluttering them up with too many words, is a step away from  <br/>
connections, rather than toward.<br/>

&lt;&lt;With babies, if there is a limited amount of money in which to buy<br/>
toys, i can think of many better choices than flashcards<br/>
or &quot;educational&quot; items geared toward &quot;teaching language development&quot;<br/>
or &quot;making your baby smarter&quot;..&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been working at prejudices from both ends.  On one hand, I&#39;m now open<br/>
to TV, electronics, plastic toys--things I thought would be harmful before.<br/>
We have all of these things in our home now that we know Dmitri and have a<br/>
continually evolving sense of what he likes.<br/>
<br/>
On the other, I noticed that I was immediately overlooking things that I<br/>
thought of as &quot;toys with an agenda&quot;--Baby Einstein videos, flashcards, and<br/>
the like.  Now I realize that some of these toys and materials are genuinely<br/>
fun things (at least from Dmitri&#39;s point of view) wrapped up in edu-speak to<br/>
appeal to parents.  <br/>
<br/>
I noticed this the day I picked up a set of colorful blocks in a toy store,<br/>
spotted the Baby Einstein label, and had an immediate negative reaction.  We<br/>
bought them, and Dmitri has taught me that they&#39;re fun even if they&#39;re<br/>
supposed to be good for him.  I&#39;m learning to look past words like<br/>
&quot;flashcards.&quot;  Yes, I initially balked at buying them because of the<br/>
negative association, but they&#39;re really just colorful pieces of cardboard<br/>
with neat pictures and textures, kind of like individual board book pages<br/>
that Dmitri can easily wave about.<br/>

Sandra<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention the shared intimacy of &quot;family words&quot; -- hambagurger; <br/>
taterpillar, miffins.<br/>
<br/>
When we use these words safely within the context of our family, and not <br/>
in a &quot;put down&quot; kind of way, it celebrates the beautiful babies that <br/>
they were and how far they have come.  Even my gallumphing great 13 year <br/>
old likes to hear words he used as a tiny child.<br/>
<br/>
By using these words in quiet times, it helps bring us even closer.  <br/>
Don&#39;t &quot;miffins&quot; sound much cozier and more comfortable than &quot;mittens&quot;?  <br/>
I would certainly never ask my son if he wanted mashed &quot;taboes&quot; in front <br/>
of his friends, but when I do it in private, he knows I am remembering <br/>
the adorable lad he was and missing that toddler a little, as much as I <br/>
appreciate the fine young man he is.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, listening to them wonder aloud why they thought &quot;geeleeup&quot; <br/>
was a good word for car, or &quot;go gos&quot; meant their little plastic Fisher <br/>
Price people, we look at each other and smile.  It usually starts a <br/>
spate of &quot;Remember .... remember...&quot; and I get to see their perceptions <br/>
of our early days together.<br/>
<br/>
I have always used proper terms and no &quot;baby talk&quot; around my children, <br/>
and I never corrected my children&#39;s pronounciation unless they asked -- <br/>
I knew that too soon they would leave behind their lisps and other <br/>
childish ways.  And they have.  I did honor their attempts by using some <br/>
of &quot;their&quot; words, though -- it was only fair; they were trying to use <br/>
mine. <br/>
<br/>
I taught English as a Second Language for years, and it never failed to <br/>
bring a smile to the lips of a struggling student when I could use a <br/>
word or two of their language.  It showed them I respected the language <br/>
and culture they already had.  How could I do less for my own children?<br/>
<br/>
My &quot;baby&quot; turned six on Monday -- every day her vocabulary becomes a <br/>
little more &quot;adult&quot;.  Already miffins and taterpillars are a thing of <br/>
the past as we explore whether Shakespeare&#39;s fairy queen is <br/>
&quot;Tie-TAY-nee-ah&quot; or Tih-TAW-nee-ya&quot; (does anybody know for sure?).  <br/>
Maybe I am just feeling a touch sentimental today.  All I know is, when <br/>
I use a &quot;family&quot; word, it becomes an allusion to their childhood, a <br/>
shorthand for &quot;I love you and all you are and all you were and all you <br/>
are yet to be&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
I disagree strongly. That&#39;s a myth I&#39;ve heard bandied about by<br/>
some...but it hasn&#39;t held up in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like it when people talk down to children in silly voices. But<br/>
we&#39;ve used all sorts of not-real-except-in-our-family words and it<br/>
hasn&#39;t seemed to hinder my children&#39;s natural desire to learn lots of<br/>
words and new ones every year of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
We love our silly words that mean things to us....in fact, I think<br/>
those made-up words can be a very real way to validate a child that<br/>
can&#39;t say the &quot;correct&quot; name anyway. None of my children have limited<br/>
vocabularies...and one of them didn&#39;t talk until 3 years old.<br/>
He just turned five and tells me that &quot;we breathe in oxygen and plants<br/>
breath out oxygen&quot;....pretty good vocabulary for only talking the last<br/>
two years.:) He called nursing &quot;na-na&#39;s&quot; and still has some funny<br/>
words for stuff that we use right along with him.<br/>

  I&#39;m not a fan of baby words either and didn&#39;t use them but can&#39;t for the life of me see the harm in them if they work for a child.<br/>

You COULD make him stay after school until he is trained to say <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Something I&#39;ve picked up from listening to unschooling parents from <br/>
very different backgrounds is that it isn&#39;t so much the *methods* of <br/>
school that are the problem, but the *implementation*. If you look <br/>
at things like Multiple Intelligences and Myers-Briggs personality <br/>
types (in a general sense), they say what unschoolers all say - not <br/>
everyone works, thinks, or learns the same.<br/>
<br/>
Even in an environment from birth with total freedom, lack of <br/>
prejudice, access to info of all types... there will still be a <br/>
percentage of children who learn best by listening to an &quot;expert&quot; <br/>
explain a topic, then being allowed to &quot;quiz&quot; themselves on the <br/>
knowledge they have gained. The key is really comprehending what are <br/>
the strengths and weaknesses of a child, adressing them, and giving <br/>
them freedom to adapt the best they can. Some kids may actually <br/>
learn best in a school environment, and to truly unschool is to give <br/>
the child that freedom to explore that possibility. To shield them <br/>
from a certain type of learning, because we see it as &quot;traditional&quot; <br/>
or &quot;forced&quot; might be just as harmful as forcing a child into it (if <br/>
the parents take care to explain to them what they see as <br/>
detrimental aspects of school, and that the child has no obligation <br/>
to stay there if they no longer feel it is for them).<br/>
<br/>
Katherine mentioned this:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The &quot;danger&quot; in strewing schooly things comes when the parent isnt <br/>
&gt;really all that convinced about unschooling, and when they place a <br/>
&gt;higher priority on learning that &quot;looks educational&quot; than learning <br/>
&gt;that is simply fun. If the workbook is right next to the comic <br/>
 </span></blockquote>book, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and the parent is truly ok with either being chosen, thats great. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>But <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;if the parent isnt quite there yet, it might be better to not have <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;workbook around, esp if the child really isnt hot for workbooks <br/>
 </span></blockquote>anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is an equal danger in the alternative - in our hope to <br/>
expose kids to fun activities and avoid &quot;schooly&quot;-type elements, we <br/>
may hold back kids whose natural tendencies are to focus on <br/>
structured, logical resources.<br/>
<br/>
Being attentive to our childrens&#39; interests and personalities is <br/>
more important than what they have to play with. If unschooling is <br/>
to be believed, it will be impossible for an attentive parent not to <br/>
notice a child gravitating towards their interests, be it calculus <br/>
or coloring books.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion. :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some of those sweet made-up words are part of our family&#39;s vocabulary  <br/>
forever, though. My kids are smart enough to know which words are  <br/>
going to be understood outside the family and which aren&#39;t. Linguists  <br/>
write about vocabulary circles or communities. There are words that  <br/>
we can&#39;t use with other English speaking people who live in different  <br/>
states. There are words that we older people (I&#39;m 54 this month)  <br/>
can&#39;t use with 25 year olds. Yesterday at our park day someone told  <br/>
about a bumper sticker she&#39;d seen that said, &quot;Where are we going and  <br/>
how did we get into this handbasket.&quot; I was surprised how many people  <br/>
didn&#39;t get it and, turned out, had never heard the expression, &quot;Going  <br/>
to hell in a handbasket.&quot; We have the interesting situation, too, of  <br/>
my kids knowing a lot of &quot;baby words&quot; in Farsi, not English. They  <br/>
call their father &quot;Baba&quot; - with the accent more on the second &#39;ba.&quot;  <br/>
They know Farsi words for many of the things that are usually babies&#39;  <br/>
&quot;first words&quot; - like for milk they know &quot;shir&quot; and for water they  <br/>
know &#39;ab&#39; and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Those are real words in another language. But some of the words they  <br/>
&quot;know&quot; were combinations of English and Farsi and those are very  <br/>
precious to us - my oldest used to have a &quot;khirs-bear&quot; - khirs is  <br/>
bear in Farsi, so that&#39;s really saying &quot;bear bear.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-214256961">&quot;Stand by what you write.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yes, what I am talking about is when children are babies, infants, toddlers,<br/>
preschooler age 0 to about five whichever terminology makes you comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
They do not need two or three labels for an object thrown at them. It is<br/>
difficult enough for a child under the age of five to learn (learn also<br/>
means to discover something for one&#39;s self and that is what everyone on this<br/>
list does or is here to learn about and I don&#39;t think of myself as a<br/>
teacher. I think of myself as a fellow learner and guide as does my son<br/>
because when he discovers something that I don&#39;t know he loves to share his<br/>
discovery with me.)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Children (under the age of five) are like scientists from an alien world.<br/>
Not only have they never seen, touched or experienced anything in our world<br/>
- they also have no way of communicating thoughts, feelings or desires with<br/>
anything more then frustrated cries, screams and babbling. You can called<br/>
the Bath a &quot;tubby&quot; if you like but you still use that word over and over<br/>
until they get the idea of that tubby means getting in the tub and taking a<br/>
bath.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
While I did mention that I don&#39;t use baby words, my point was that while I<br/>
don&#39;t see the use for baby words, I still think you should use one word when<br/>
trying to communicate with our little scientists.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That is not to say that once children have a foundation of language they<br/>
will discover new words for old objects.<br/>
<br/>

No, I think it sped up my son&#39;s communication skills. Now at five being that<br/>
he is into Dr. Seuss and creates his own stories with made up creatures. I<br/>
don&#39;t think I limited him at all. We have wobbwhos and trodilles and other<br/>
that are too long to type here. He also has other words he makes up and some<br/>
days we spend all day speaking gibberish.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Limiting to &quot;only real words&quot; is more limiting than I think you  <br/>
intend to be.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Speaking to children in real, respectful ways and sharing information  <br/>
with them as you would with a friend is a fantastic idea.   <br/>
Withholding baby words out of a sense of efficiency, or of not  <br/>
cluttering them up with too many words, is a step away from  <br/>
connections, rather than toward.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention the shared intimacy of &quot;family words&quot; -- hambagurger; <br/>
taterpillar, miffins.<br/>
<br/>
When we use these words safely within the context of our family, and not <br/>
in a &quot;put down&quot; kind of way, it celebrates the beautiful babies that <br/>
they were and how far they have come.  Even my gallumphing great 13 year <br/>
old likes to hear words he used as a tiny child.<br/>
<br/>
By using these words in quiet times, it helps bring us even closer.  <br/>
Don&#39;t &quot;miffins&quot; sound much cozier and more comfortable than &quot;mittens&quot;?  <br/>
I would certainly never ask my son if he wanted mashed &quot;taboes&quot; in front <br/>
of his friends, but when I do it in private, he knows I am remembering <br/>
the adorable lad he was and missing that toddler a little, as much as I <br/>
appreciate the fine young man he is.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, listening to them wonder aloud why they thought &quot;geeleeup&quot; <br/>
was a good word for car, or &quot;go gos&quot; meant their little plastic Fisher <br/>
Price people, we look at each other and smile.  It usually starts a <br/>
spate of &quot;Remember .... remember...&quot; and I get to see their perceptions <br/>
of our early days together.<br/>
<br/>
I have always used proper terms and no &quot;baby talk&quot; around my children, <br/>
and I never corrected my children&#39;s pronounciation unless they asked -- <br/>
I knew that too soon they would leave behind their lisps and other <br/>
childish ways.  And they have.  I did honor their attempts by using some <br/>
of &quot;their&quot; words, though -- it was only fair; they were trying to use <br/>
mine. <br/>
<br/>
I taught English as a Second Language for years, and it never failed to <br/>
bring a smile to the lips of a struggling student when I could use a <br/>
word or two of their language.  It showed them I respected the language <br/>
and culture they already had.  How could I do less for my own children?<br/>
<br/>
My &quot;baby&quot; turned six on Monday -- every day her vocabulary becomes a <br/>
little more &quot;adult&quot;.  Already miffins and taterpillars are a thing of <br/>
the past as we explore whether Shakespeare&#39;s fairy queen is <br/>
&quot;Tie-TAY-nee-ah&quot; or Tih-TAW-nee-ya&quot; (does anybody know for sure?).  <br/>
Maybe I am just feeling a touch sentimental today.  All I know is, when <br/>
I use a &quot;family&quot; word, it becomes an allusion to their childhood, a <br/>
shorthand for &quot;I love you and all you are and all you were and all you <br/>
are yet to be&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177777006">If there is ever anyone who can put into perspective it is Ren. Yes, I guess<br/>
I see your point. I still do get some baby words like meems for medicine or<br/>
how tubby is easier then tub or bath. We do use some family words like<br/>
ninnies for breastfeeding. I have always called what you do on the toilet<br/>
going potty even before my son was born but I guess that is a baby word.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My aunt&#39;s oldest son couldn&#39;t say tantrum and so we still call it a<br/>
tol-drum. while I don&#39;t see the need for some baby words that are often<br/>
longer then the word it is supposed to mean. You have broken my biggest<br/>
concern with is that of their vocabulary.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Pronunciation errors are cute. my son used to call a cookie - tookie and I<br/>
will always remember that. The ones I am glad he got over was his<br/>
pronunciation sounded of peach sounded like bitch at about the same time as<br/>
his favorite movie was James and the Giant Peach.<br/>

Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] problems with &quot;teach one word&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;If we teach them<br/>
baby words like tubby instead of bath it lowers their vocabulary. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I disagree strongly. That&#39;s a myth I&#39;ve heard bandied about by<br/>
some...but it hasn&#39;t held up in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like it when people talk down to children in silly voices. But<br/>
we&#39;ve used all sorts of not-real-except-in-our-family words and it<br/>
hasn&#39;t seemed to hinder my children&#39;s natural desire to learn lots of<br/>
words and new ones every year of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
We love our silly words that mean things to us....in fact, I think<br/>
those made-up words can be a very real way to validate a child that<br/>
can&#39;t say the &quot;correct&quot; name anyway. None of my children have limited<br/>
vocabularies...and one of them didn&#39;t talk until 3 years old.<br/>
He just turned five and tells me that &quot;we breathe in oxygen and plants<br/>
breath out oxygen&quot;....pretty good vocabulary for only talking the last<br/>
two years.:) He called nursing &quot;na-na&#39;s&quot; and still has some funny<br/>
words for stuff that we use right along with him.<br/>

five to learn, and in fact those in fully bilingual situations pick  <br/>
up two different languages, including more than one word for objects  <br/>
in both languages, and they sort out the grammar and all, naturally.<br/>

No, they are natural parts of their OWN world.<br/>

our world<br/>

<br/>
There is touch.  There is gaze.  Have you never just looked into the  <br/>
eyes of your child, communicating?  Have you not touched them  <br/>
soothingly, and felt them touch you back sometimes?    They can tell  <br/>
the difference between an angry look and a gentle look.<br/>
<br/>
-=-While I did mention that I don&#39;t use baby words, my point was that  <br/>
while I<br/>

trying to communicate with our little scientists.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Right.  Then you said you hadn&#39;t said that.<br/>
But English has MANY words for things.  A sandwich can be a sandwich,  <br/>
a snack, dinner, a tuna sandwich or a grilled cheese.    A dog can be  <br/>
a puppy or a guard dog or a pet or a beagle or a poodle.   A flower  <br/>
might be a tulip or a gift.  A gift might be a present, or a birthday  <br/>
present.<br/>
<br/>
-=-That is not to say that once children have a foundation of  <br/>
language they<br/>
will discover new words for old objects.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
When will you decide that they have a foundation of language?   <br/>
Because honestly, they have a foundation before they ever utter a  <br/>
word.  They are starting to understand speech they hear before they  <br/>
use it intelligibly.<br/>

will stall out.  Seeing learning as swirling all directions, as  <br/>
children figure out what they need without the overlay of a linear  <br/>
model, helps one get nearer to trusting natural learning.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They are starting to understand speech they hear before they<br/>
&gt; use it intelligibly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup. I remember carrying Kathryn around when she a week shy of 1  <br/>
nattering on about what I was doing. As I was looking all over for  <br/>
her hat I said &quot;Where&#39;s you&#39;re hat?&quot; not really expecting her to  <br/>
understand what I was saying but she not only understood but had  <br/>
watched someone put it up on the mantle at some point during the day  <br/>
and she pointed right at it.<br/>
<br/>
Shannon:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They do not need two or three labels for an object thrown at them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that sounds totally sensible. If an adult were learning a  <br/>
foreign language they&#39;d be irritated to have several names thrown at  <br/>
them for things they were trying to learn.<br/>
<br/>
And yet it just doesn&#39;t hold up against reality for babies. They  <br/>
aren&#39;t consciously thinking about making a connection between a sound  <br/>
(word) they hear and an object the way adults try to when learning a  <br/>
language. They just absorb it all and connections get made in the  <br/>
background as the brain does whatever it does.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t make sense that multiple words for a single thing wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
confuse them, but the brain seems to take it in stride as though  <br/>
that&#39;s a given. We don&#39;t really understand how the brain manages to  <br/>
organize the input it gets so perhaps the brain *is* set up  <br/>
specifically to accept multiple names for things because we need to  <br/>
categorize things.<br/>
<br/>
Even without baby talk a cat isn&#39;t just a cat it&#39;s an animal, pet,  <br/>
cat, kitty, Allie, warm, fuzzy, nice .... and so on. The brain  <br/>
manages to sort out -- because we *do* use multiple names for things  <br/>
-- that each word is a set that includes 1 or more objects. It&#39;s the  <br/>
key to our ability to categorize things. For Kathryn, the word Allie  <br/>
was a set of 1. The word kitty may have been a set of 2 until she  <br/>
realized it applied to all creatures that had a resemblance to Allie  <br/>
and Zoomer. She may have thought pets also meant only Allie and  <br/>
Zoomer but as she encountered more uses of the word, she expanded and  <br/>
refined her meaning. (Interestingly it took a while for Kathryn to  <br/>
figure out how to say Zoomer so she called both cats Allie and yet if  <br/>
asked &quot;Where&#39;s Allie?&quot; she&#39;d never point at Zoomer and she would  <br/>
point at Zoomer when asked &quot;Where&#39;s Zoomer?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Related to the categorizing thought, some kids go through a stage of  <br/>
thinking Daddy means man so all men are called Daddy. But through use  <br/>
and context they shortly get it sorted it out.<br/>
<br/>
So adding another baby talk word on top of all the words kids hear  <br/>
for a single object really isn&#39;t a problem at all for them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924343186"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt; Yesterday at our park day someone told<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  about a bumper sticker she&#39;d seen that said, &quot;Where are we going and<br/>
  how did we get into this handbasket.&quot; I was surprised how many people<br/>
  didn&#39;t get it and, turned out, had never heard the expression, &quot;Going<br/>
  to hell in a handbasket.&quot;  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  Dang!  All of a sudden-- or maybe I just missed it-- I&#39;ve gone from being<br/>
one of the hip, young kids in a group to one of those &quot;older folks&quot;  who<br/>
knows what the h*** a handbasket is!  How did that happen?!?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">    &gt;&gt;&gt;We have the interesting situation, too, of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  my kids knowing a lot of &quot;baby words&quot; in Farsi, not English. They<br/>
  call their father &quot;Baba&quot; - with the accent more on the second &#39;ba.&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  We have &quot;Baba&quot; too-- because my daughter babbled &quot;baba&quot; instead of<br/>
&quot;dada&quot;-- and when she could see her dad, the &quot;baba&quot; got so much louder and<br/>
happier, that he just became &quot;Baba&quot; and it stuck.  It&#39;s great in a<br/>
crowd...all the other kids are yelling &quot;Daddy&quot; or &quot;Mama&quot;-- we can always<br/>
hear &quot;Baba&quot;!  (I think it&#39;s &quot;Baba&quot; in Mandarin Chinsese as well-- at least<br/>
it is on &quot;Sagwa&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
  We also have some odd combinations of english and japanese, which native<br/>
speakers of either language don&#39;t get.  We can&#39;t help it...our japanese<br/>
pronunciation is just bad, but we try, and our linguistic constructs work<br/>
for us!<br/>
