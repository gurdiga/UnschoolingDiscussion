<div id="ygrps-yiv-63626226">I found this all interesting. As  a mom to a 3 1/2 year old girl who has <br/>
already broken her arm twice (one wrist at age 13 months, one break just <br/>
above the elbow this past summer), I can testify that accidents happen when <br/>
you least expect it - and even if you&#39;re there. Kalie broke her wrist when <br/>
she was learning to walk - she let go of the couch she was teetering along, <br/>
and landed &quot;wrong&quot; on her wrist. The second break this past summer, she was <br/>
very tired and sort of slid off the end of her bed at nighttime -- she wasn&#39;t <br/>
even fooling around, just tired, and must have put her arm straight out to <br/>
break her fall, and broke it near the elbow. We were so concerned that she <br/>
had some sort of bone weakness or something frightening, but, as our doctor <br/>
puts it, she &quot;just earned herself two good breaks&quot;. (&quot;Devastated&quot; just barely <br/>
covers how we felt!) <br/>
<br/>
When I compare these two accidents to the number of times she&#39;s fallen, <br/>
tripped, run into things, etc. without damage, it calms me somewhat, but I <br/>
admit to being a little bit stifling &quot;in the name of safety&quot; myself. However, <br/>
what I&#39;m attempting now is to give her MORE freedom to run and jump and play <br/>
and climb (OK, I&#39;m always nearby, but I try to stifle my own gasps when she <br/>
does fall). My reasoning is that the more skills and strength she develops, <br/>
the less likely she is to be hurt. We&#39;re both enjoying this approach a lot <br/>
more!<br/>

I will also say that most of the breaks in children (that I saw) were from <br/>
typical every day goofin&#39; off or those all too common accidents that happen <br/>
to all.    Climbing trees, trampoline falls, fingers shut in the car door, <br/>
and sports injuries.  The few times a toddler was brought in with a broken <br/>
bone, the parents were just devastated because they felt so bad about not <br/>
&#39;being there&#39; to prevent the fall/injury.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;People stifle toddlers too much in the name of safety.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was guilty of that myself with my first.  Much more relaxed with my second. <br/>
 Actually, it was not too common for toddlers to come in with broken bones.  <br/>
They are very resilient.  Most of the little ones just had a bump on the <br/>
head....it seems like mine always had a bump/bruise from falling off of <br/>
something so I guess I wasn&#39;t too stifling.  :) <br/>

I think Kirby was about a year and a half old when Keith was holding his hand <br/>
and he was walking along on the little concrete parking bumpers in a parking <br/>
lot.  Keith would &quot;fly him&quot; to the next one with two hands, and then hold one <br/>
hand while he balanced along there.  Those are what, six inches high?  three <br/>
inches wide on the top maybe?<br/>
<br/>
A grandmotherly woman walked by, looked, and said to Keith:  &quot;He&#39;s too young <br/>
to do that.&quot;<br/>
Keith said he just looked at her, but should have said &quot;But he IS doing that.&quot;<br/>
