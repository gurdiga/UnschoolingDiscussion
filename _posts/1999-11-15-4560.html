&lt;&lt; Are these workbooks that you write in or what???<br/>
<br/>
Magazine style?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
we first got their publication puzzlemania, now this is a takeoff on that.  <br/>
my dd says rather than a workbook or magazine, it is an activity book.  it <br/>
could be totally consumable like a workbook (tho its all in color) but i have <br/>
her do the ones she can on scratch paper since she is the oldest of (at <br/>
least) four children.  some, however are set up like a maze or a color by <br/>
number and i let her at &#39;em.  i am not sure how you would figure out a yearly <br/>
rate since it is not a subscription per se, but i am sure if you just call <br/>
that cust. serv.# theyd be more than happy to answer...  oh, also, some of <br/>
the problems are quite easy enough for the seven yo dd to do already so be <br/>
aware i am not saying what &quot;grade level&quot; they correspond with.  you may want <br/>
to ask that too.  i have found that even if it is easier stuff than i know my <br/>
10yo can do, it only boosts her confidence and makes her LIKE math more when <br/>
it is very do-able, so i am not particular about that at this point.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204089272">my 7 yo loves mathmania and it is well worth the cost.  He does about one<br/>
a month or so, although he needs  help with a few of each out of each<br/>
book.  He is getting a tad tired of the repetition, though, and complains<br/>
that many are now too easy for him or too obvious.  I think we will get<br/>
two more books and then cancel our subscription.  He had the smae problem<br/>
with the Highlights Top Secret series, but he still likes to do them, even<br/>
t hough the challenge is in doing the writing, not the thinking.  He<br/>
really prefers the magazines about games and puzzless that are sold at<br/>
newsstands, although the reading in those is a little too hard.  He s pent<br/>
a few days working ont he puzzles in this month&#39;s Esquire (the issue about<br/>
IQ).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92028448">Our kids get Top Secret (world geography) and our son gets Mathmania. They<br/>
*love* these publications. In order to save money, I called Highlights and<br/>
asked to have them send them every other month rather than every month, with<br/>
each publication alternating so that they&#39;ll receive, for example, Top<br/>
Secret this month and Mathmania next month. Scholastic will do this for you<br/>
to (our kids have been in various clubs over the years).<br/>
