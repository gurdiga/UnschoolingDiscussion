<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257492757">Hi all,<br/>
Has anyone read the Amelia Peabody mysteries by Elizabeth Peters?  I&#39;m just <br/>
starting the most recent one.  I&#39;ve read all of them several times.  Ramses <br/>
(Peabody&#39;s son) is a great example of a true unschooler!  Give them try <br/>
sometime - you can learn lots about Egyptian history as well as having fun <br/>
with them.  <br/>

Well, they are adult books, but I would say any proficient reader of about 12 <br/>
or so would enjoy them.  There&#39;s nothing profane that would require them to <br/>
be solely for adults.  <br/>
