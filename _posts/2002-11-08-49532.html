&lt;&lt; Well see...it&#39;s all those &quot;thee&#39;s&quot; and &quot;thou&#39;s&quot; that seem stuffy to me. <br/>
The <br/>
whole way of talking at that time.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well here&#39;s something that most people nowadays probably don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of European languages (Romance/Latin-based)  have both formal and <br/>
familiar second-person pronouns (like usted and tu for Spanish, the first <br/>
used in instances when you are outranked by the person to whom you&#39;re <br/>
speaking--you use that for bosses, teachers, the president, your grandmother, <br/>
and the other for your buddies, your kids, your dog), <br/>
<br/>
In English we don&#39;t.  We say &quot;you&quot; to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
But until just lately, 300 years or less, English DID have two different <br/>
forms of address.<br/>
<br/>
For bosses, teachers, the president, they  used &quot;you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For your buddies, your kids, your dog, and GOD, you used &quot;thee.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In Spanish, French, Italian, etc., God is addressed in the familiar.  And <br/>
that would be one thing that makes it easier, probably for Catholics to feel G<br/>
od is close and right there, because they&#39;re addressing him as a friend.<br/>
<br/>
And for whatever combination of reasons (ignorance being a big one), people <br/>
here think &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; sound BIG AND SCARY becaus we call God that.<br/>
<br/>
And so there&#39;s a danger for Americans who haven&#39;t studied any history of <br/>
English to be writing little plays or scripts and have someone address a <br/>
higher personage as &quot;thee,&quot; thinking it&#39;s respectful, when it REALLY truly <br/>
isn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
Verbs weren&#39;t so much harder:<br/>
<br/>
I shall<br/>
you will/thou wilt<br/>
he/she/it will...<br/>
<br/>
I am<br/>
you are / thou art<br/>
he/she/it is<br/>
<br/>
The possessives are not so hard either.  &quot;Thy&quot; and &quot;thine&quot; work like &quot;your&quot; <br/>
and &quot;yours&quot; do.<br/>
<br/>
Is this your dog?  That dog is yours.  He&#39;s yours.  <br/>
Is this thy dog? That dog is thine!  He&#39;s thine.<br/>
<br/>
Only... like  a dog and an elephant, when it&#39;s before the noun you might need <br/>
the &quot;n&quot; so<br/>
thy dog and thine elephant are both thine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My father is from Yorkshire, in the North of England.  He was raised speaking <br/>
this way, full of thees and thous, hither and yon.  Oh, maybe someone can <br/>
remember better than me but it&#39;s something like there is here (or another <br/>
word), meaning right in front of you or near you, hither meaning more like <br/>
across the street and then yon which is the rest of the world.  He&#39;s very <br/>
funny about his rememberences of the language sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
My mother, on the other hand, was raised in London and never spoke that way.  <br/>
She had real trouble with the dialect and generally turned her nose up at it. <br/>
 She was also raised middle class whereas my father&#39;s parents were working <br/>
class - his mother was in service and his father was a mechanic.  They are <br/>
both 75.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, Thee for God.  A very familiar sort of thing.  My parents were both <br/>
raised in the Church of England but after the war my mother&#39;s mother turned <br/>
to Pentacostal.  My father, the unreligious physicist, says the major <br/>
difference was that her family no longer had any comfortable furniture except <br/>
in their bomb shelter.  He and his father in law would retreat back there to <br/>
smoke pipes....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for bringing up the linguistic memories.<br/>

hates to wear hearing aids and the conversation would have been more like one <br/>
of those cellular commercials...<br/>
<br/>
This conversation reminds me that I really need to write some of his stories <br/>
down before it&#39;s too late.  <br/>
