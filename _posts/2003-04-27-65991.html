Maybe someone should do a conference in Ohio in Spring 2004.  That would be <br/>
really  nice.  (We are planning to drive out there anyway!)<br/>

large homeschool community...some of which are bound to be unschoolers. <br/>
Uh...I wasn&#39;t really volunteering to organize one but would love to attend. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066459845">Yeah!!!  I completed my goal of seven days of Leslie tapes in a row.  I<br/>
am very thankful to this list for giving me someone(s) to be accountable<br/>
to.  I did the two mile tape, 50 sit ups, and some yoga stretches today.<br/>
My legs were somewhat fatigued, but my hips are still feeling pretty<br/>
good.  (not perfect, but definately better!)<br/>
 <br/>
My new goal is to complete a total of 21 days of Leslie Tapes, so that<br/>
means two weeks in my next goal.  I read that it takes about that long<br/>
to form an exercise habit and that if you do it in the morning, you are<br/>
more likely to be successful.  Unfortunately dh and I are on opposite<br/>
schedules these days.  He stays up late and sleeps in and I get up early<br/>
and go to bed early.  (Hey, maybe that&#39;s a good thing, being we are home<br/>
with each other 24/7 when he isn&#39;t out of town.)<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, thanks to all of you for joining me in supporting each other in<br/>
our fitness goals.<br/>
