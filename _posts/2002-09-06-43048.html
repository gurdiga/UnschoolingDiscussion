 </span></blockquote>I even am tired of saying this. I put so many things off until <br/>
Christmas/birthday that it ends up making the expectations of those days too <br/>
great. <br/>
Last week Eric mentioned that he&#39;d like a portable CD player. He, knowing <br/>
that it&#39;s a bigger ticket item, deferred gratification until Christmas. I <br/>
took some of the postings to heart. When we were out doing errands a few days <br/>
later, I had so much fun driving into the Circuit City parking lot. The <br/>
expression on his face was priceless (sounds like a credit card commercial). <br/>
I told him that he shouldn&#39;t have to wait for everything especially if I can <br/>
do it now. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks all,<br/>
The paradigm is shifting,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think at least one time with our children we&#39;ve all delayed something with <br/>
the best of intentions and haven&#39;t followed through. It&#39;s when we do it more <br/>
and more without realizing what it does to the chld that it becomes a <br/>
problem. I&#39;m not sure if it has to do with how we were raised or what. I <br/>
know my husband had a habit of promising or saying later tot he kids with <br/>
all the best intentions, but something would come up to make it not so. I <br/>
pointed it out to him and even still have to remind him sometimes. He wasn&#39;t <br/>
even realizing what was going on. He would also have a habit of saying if <br/>
you do this than this will happen and not follow through. The kids got wise <br/>
to that quick and he learned his own lesson on that one!!!<br/>
<br/>
He had a crappy childhood with no one really caring so maybe that had <br/>
something to do with it. Now he&#39;s so aware of just what words can do.<br/>

surprised that I remembered---my husband and friends as well! <br/>
