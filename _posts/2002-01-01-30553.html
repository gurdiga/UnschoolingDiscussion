<div id="ygrps-yiv-510565365">Lynn,  I see your viewpoint on why you don&#39;t like TV.  In relation to<br/>
unschooling, however,  I believe the challenge is in allowing your children<br/>
to explore and understand limits *intrinsically*.  What I find most<br/>
challenging about unschooling is that it is up to me to provide<br/>
alternatives.  I find this difficult because my oldest would love for me to<br/>
play more games with her....younger sibs don&#39;t understand how to play at her<br/>
level.  BUT,  because of the younger sibs,  my ability to do this is very<br/>
limited.  The three yr old *wants* to play,  the toddler *wants* to throw<br/>
pieces everywhere.<br/>
The 6 yr old  doesn&#39;t like games and rules...she like to play making up her<br/>
own rules as she sees fit.  Outings can be difficult with my children&#39;s age<br/>
range, too.  The oldest 2 aren&#39;t able to play in many &quot;kiddielands&quot;...and<br/>
the youngest 2 can&#39;t sit through theater productions,  are a major<br/>
distraction in museums, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My point boils down to...the extrinsic &#39;rules&#39; often circumvent a person&#39;s<br/>
ability to listen to and trust their own gut feelings.<br/>

&gt; rules, so he doesn&#39;t ask for it on the other days bc he is busy doing<br/>
&gt; other things, seeing friends, reading, playing and what-have-you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think TV is harmful bc it takes away from time kids can be spent doing<br/>
&gt; other, more productive and imaginative things, like watching clouds float<br/>
&gt; thru the sky. The images of women and people of color bother me. Its<br/>
&gt; materialistic emphasis bothers me. Mostly, though, I hate the sound of it,<br/>
&gt; that ever-present din in the background. I find my own life is richer<br/>
&gt; w/out it. But that is my own baggage. My brother, on the other hand,<br/>
&gt; watches tons of TV. He also happens to be a serious and very successful<br/>
&gt; novelist who lacks nothing in the imagination or hardworking dept. So who<br/>
&gt; can really say? I guess it just comes down to one&#39;s own comfort level.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey Susan,<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your thoughtful response. And I do agree, to a point.<br/>
However, looking back on my own experiences growing up, I am thankful that<br/>
I had limits placed on me during certain times of my life when I really<br/>
don&#39;t think I would have been able to handle the freedom of making my own<br/>
choices. For instance, in junior high school, a bunch of my friends<br/>
started staying out late, experimenting w/drugs, sex etc. I was not<br/>
allowed to do these things and would have gotten in big trouble if I&#39;d<br/>
tried them and gotten caught. Looking back on these times, I think that if<br/>
I had been allowed to engage in such behaviors the results would have been<br/>
disastrous -- pregnancy, overdose, etc. By the time I got to college, and<br/>
I did start experimenting w/smoking pot, having boyfriends and such, I was<br/>
much better able to handle it. Sure I went overboard a few times, but I<br/>
was much more mature at 19 than I was at 13.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for all of you who don&#39;t place limits on TV-watching:<br/>
Will you also allow your children to find their own limits with respect to<br/>
things like drinking, having sex etc?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be antagonistic; I&#39;m really curious.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>wow. <br/>
ok. <br/>
DD does not have limits about drugs, sex and rock and roll. &lt;g&gt; She <br/>
*chooses* not to do drugs or become sexually active... I do not have <br/>
to tell her not to; it&#39;s all in her value system and what she has <br/>
learned from us, her parents. She&#39;s been informed of what happens <br/>
when you do either of those things and SHE&#39;s made the decision not to <br/>
go that route. Think about it... who, in their right mind would <br/>
*choose* to do either of these things if they are given the facts of <br/>
the consequences?!  OTOH, some of her friends who *do* have parents <br/>
restricting their kids&#39; activities (you have to be in by 10, you will <br/>
be severely grounded if we catch you doing &#39;x&#39;, etc) ARE doing all <br/>
these things and more!... sneaking at every chance the get. <br/>
imo It all comes back to the issue of respecting your child... <br/>
respecting them to have the sense to *make* the right decisions. That <br/>
begins when they are little, not later in life.  I doubt my kid will <br/>
experiment with drugs when she goes to college.. a time when, as you <br/>
put it she&#39;ll be &quot;better able to handle it&quot;. I think she&#39;s learned <br/>
long before college age that drugs and irresponsible sex are <br/>
dangerous endeavors to pursue.  <br/>
When I talk to her and we&#39;re discussing what some of her friends are <br/>
doing, she refers to their behavior as &quot;dumb&quot;. We openly talk about <br/>
it; she tells me that so-and-so snuck out of her house last night and <br/>
met this guy, etc.  Doing that, though, is not *necessary* or even <br/>
attractive as an option for her be*cause* we, her parents, don&#39;t set <br/>
limits that prohibit her seeing a guy. <br/>
True experience: dd met this guy and started dating him (not <br/>
car-dating.. neither has their license). I knew that this guy was <br/>
coming from a less-than desirable lifestyle(imo) which included <br/>
neglectful parents, hanging out at the mall *all* the time, smoking, <br/>
smoking pot and being sexually active.  I knew if I prevented her <br/>
from seeing him, I&#39;d forever have to be monitoring who she was with <br/>
at the movies, who she was meeting at the mall. So, instead, I <br/>
welcomed him into our household (fed him, too... remember i mentioned <br/>
that before?&lt;g&gt;) I *told* dd what concerned me about him but I didn&#39;t <br/>
let those concerns dictate what she could do.  It only took a few <br/>
weeks for dd to see that my concerns were warranted and she didn&#39;t <br/>
want to have any part of his &#39;problems&#39; and she broke off the <br/>
relationship. (yeah!!!!)  It all worked out this way because of <br/>
respect. DD respects herself & knows we respect and trust her to make <br/>
good choices.<br/>
Do I ever have weak moments or feel myself waivering in my <br/>
convictions? yes!!! And usually when that happens, I come to my lists <br/>
and talk it out with other unschoolers and friends and I am reminded <br/>
of our past successes and I am told to chill. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974620139">I already have with my oldest two.  They are 16 (almost 17) and 14.  <br/>
Rache has had her driver&#39;s license for nearly a year now.  She has <br/>
been allowed to drink for longer.  On New Year&#39;s Eve she had a half <br/>
glass of wine but she is not really interested in drinking.  Oddley, <br/>
she wants to be a bartender.  Odd choice for someone who really <br/>
shouldn&#39;t drink (prozac) and doesn&#39;t really like to anyway.  She and <br/>
Jenni both like to taste our wines and beers when dh and I drink but <br/>
they really dont seem much interested in it.<br/>
<br/>
As for sex, I&#39;m begging!  I want grandkids and they don&#39;t even want <br/>
to date!  So yeah, that decision is theirs too.<br/>
<br/>
If I noticed a problem with one of them, I might talk about it.  If <br/>
drugs were involved I would say absolutely not in my house or any of <br/>
our cars.<br/>
<br/>
And then there is Wyndham . . . I hope and pray that by the time he <br/>
is 16 he will  have a better understanding of himself so that I don&#39;t <br/>
have to impose limits.  Until then, he needs a lot more aid and <br/>
supervision than his sisters ever did.  Recently (in the past year) <br/>
he has started showing some good signs.  He is becoming more self-<br/>
aware and self-controlling.  It&#39;s a slow process but it seems to be <br/>
working.<br/>
<br/>
I think as a parent, the hardest part of my job was knowing the <br/>
difference between my children needing my help and not needing it.  <br/>
Had I raised Rachel or Jenni the way I am Wyndham, they would be a <br/>
pregnant run-aways about now.  The difference is in the personality <br/>
and problems of the individual children.  <br/>
<br/>
And here is something that needs said more clearly here . . . just <br/>
because I have to impose more limits on my son does not mean that I <br/>
respect him and his wishes less than I do the girl&#39;s.  I do listen to <br/>
what he wants to do and what he thinks is best.  We talk and discuss <br/>
the why&#39;s and when&#39;s of his limits and they change frequently as he <br/>
learns to cope with himself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-700293321">+ I have a question for all of you who don&#39;t place limits on TV-watching:<br/>
+ Will you also allow your children to find their own limits with respect to<br/>
+ things like drinking, having sex etc?<br/>
<br/>
I see several &quot;sides&quot; to this answer....<br/>
<br/>
First, I think there is a basic difference in how people feel about TV.  You<br/>
are placing it in the same category as the dangers of drinking and having<br/>
sex.  There are other people who don&#39;t believe TV is harmful at all and<br/>
others who see some harm, but not as dire as the comparison you&#39;ve tried to<br/>
provide.  Some see the dangers of show content; some of commercials; some of<br/>
inactivity; some of the activities that TV is replacing.  So....what I&#39;m<br/>
saying is that the issue of TV isn&#39;t as black and white as &quot;TV good&quot; vs. &quot;TV<br/>
bad&quot;.  Personal values regarding TV will vary.<br/>
<br/>
Second, there will certainly be people that disagree with you that<br/>
&quot;drinking&quot; and &quot;having sex&quot; are bad.  Heck--I do both from time to time and<br/>
seem to handle them just fine.  :-)  I would guess that, since you have<br/>
children, that you&#39;ve done at least one of them at some time.  :-)  So what<br/>
you may be asking is about *responsible* drinking and *responsible* sex.<br/>
Would it follow for you that there is such a thing as *responsible* TV<br/>
viewing?<br/>
<br/>
Third, if you read my version of &quot;no TV limits&quot; you&#39;ll see that I don&#39;t just<br/>
leave my kids to their own devices w.r.t. TV, but I give them tools to make<br/>
*responsible* and *conscious* choices.  I think that almost all<br/>
conscientious parents here are trying to do the same thing--just in<br/>
different ways.  I expect to be able to do the same w.r.t. drinking, sex,<br/>
and drugs.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is just 15 so I haven&#39;t lived THROUGH the teen years yet, but<br/>
we&#39;re well on our way.  I think that issues like drinking and sex are issues<br/>
that we can also discuss rationally and that I can help to give my children<br/>
tools to make *responsible* decisions regarding these issues.  I don&#39;t yet<br/>
know how I&#39;ll fare--ask me in about 5-10 years....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having trouble wording this next part....bear with me if I don&#39;t make it<br/>
clear the first time.  There is an assumption by people who haven&#39;t had much<br/>
experience with children who haven&#39;t been molded by peer influence.  There<br/>
is an expectation by many that rebellion is &quot;normal&quot; and that teens, given a<br/>
choice will choose the WRONG choice automatically.  Or that the wrong choice<br/>
will be the easiest or &quot;most fun&quot; choice for them.  I disagree.<br/>
<br/>
Kids whose parents or teachers have tightly controlled their lives don&#39;t<br/>
have experience making hard choices.  There is a basic mistrust of the<br/>
teen&#39;s ability to make responsible choices.  Kids react to this mistrust in<br/>
a logical way.....if you&#39;re going to mistrust them and punish them before<br/>
they make poor choices then they have nothing to lose by making poor<br/>
choices.<br/>
<br/>
You said in your post, &quot;a bunch of my friends started staying out late,<br/>
experimenting w/drugs, sex etc. I was not allowed to do these things and<br/>
would have gotten in big trouble if I&#39;d tried them and gotten caught&quot;.  Do<br/>
you really think your friends were &quot;allowed&quot; to experiment with drugs, sex,<br/>
etc?  Or you do you think that their parents would not have approved, but<br/>
they did them anyway?  Do you think that their parents just didn&#39;t have the<br/>
control that they thought they did?  It is my guess that if you had *wanted*<br/>
to do those things, you could have found a way.  I know I wasn&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot;<br/>
to do those things, either.  But I did do some of them....and chose not to<br/>
do others.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t really, at it&#39;s core, a set of choices of things we<br/>
&quot;allow&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t allow&quot; our children to do.  It is, at the foundation, a<br/>
RELATIONSHIP we have with our children.  We trust our children to make good<br/>
choices and we give them tools to make those choices for themselves.  We<br/>
acknowledge the things we have control over and the things we delude<br/>
ourselves into THINKING we have control over.<br/>
<br/>
When your teen goes out on a date, unless you accompany him/her, you have NO<br/>
CONTROL over whether they have sex or not.  You can set all sorts of rules,<br/>
but if they want to have sex, they can easily find a way.  Wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>
better to help them make good choices and lay the burden of responsibility<br/>
on them?<br/>

&gt; &gt;I did start experimenting w/smoking pot, having boyfriends and<br/>
&gt; &gt;such, I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;much better able to handle it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; wow.<br/>
&gt; ok.<br/>
&gt; DD does not have limits about drugs, sex and rock and roll. &lt;g&gt; She<br/>
&gt; *chooses* not to do drugs or become sexually active... I do not have<br/>
&gt; to tell her not to; it&#39;s all in her value system and what she has<br/>
&gt; learned from us, her parents. She&#39;s been informed of what happens<br/>
&gt; when you do either of those things and SHE&#39;s made the decision not to<br/>
&gt; go that route. Think about it... who, in their right mind would<br/>
&gt; *choose* to do either of these things if they are given the facts of<br/>
&gt; the consequences?!  OTOH, some of her friends who *do* have parents<br/>
&gt; restricting their kids&#39; activities (you have to be in by 10, you will<br/>
&gt; be severely grounded if we catch you doing &#39;x&#39;, etc) ARE doing all<br/>
&gt; these things and more!... sneaking at every chance the get.<br/>
&gt; imo It all comes back to the issue of respecting your child...<br/>
&gt; respecting them to have the sense to *make* the right decisions. That<br/>
&gt; begins when they are little, not later in life.  I doubt my kid will<br/>
&gt; experiment with drugs when she goes to college.. a time when, as you<br/>
&gt; put it she&#39;ll be &quot;better able to handle it&quot;. I think she&#39;s learned<br/>
&gt; long before college age that drugs and irresponsible sex are<br/>
&gt; dangerous endeavors to pursue.<br/>
&gt; When I talk to her and we&#39;re discussing what some of her friends are<br/>
&gt; doing, she refers to their behavior as &quot;dumb&quot;. We openly talk about<br/>
&gt; it; she tells me that so-and-so snuck out of her house last night and<br/>
&gt; met this guy, etc.  Doing that, though, is not *necessary* or even<br/>
&gt; attractive as an option for her be*cause* we, her parents, don&#39;t set<br/>
&gt; limits that prohibit her seeing a guy.<br/>
&gt; True experience: dd met this guy and started dating him (not<br/>
&gt; car-dating.. neither has their license). I knew that this guy was<br/>
&gt; coming from a less-than desirable lifestyle(imo) which included<br/>
&gt; neglectful parents, hanging out at the mall *all* the time, smoking,<br/>
&gt; smoking pot and being sexually active.  I knew if I prevented her<br/>
&gt; from seeing him, I&#39;d forever have to be monitoring who she was with<br/>
&gt; at the movies, who she was meeting at the mall. So, instead, I<br/>
&gt; welcomed him into our household (fed him, too... remember i mentioned<br/>
&gt; that before?&lt;g&gt;) I *told* dd what concerned me about him but I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; let those concerns dictate what she could do.  It only took a few<br/>
&gt; weeks for dd to see that my concerns were warranted and she didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to have any part of his &#39;problems&#39; and she broke off the<br/>
&gt; relationship. (yeah!!!!)  It all worked out this way because of<br/>
&gt; respect. DD respects herself & knows we respect and trust her to make<br/>
&gt; good choices.<br/>
&gt; Do I ever have weak moments or feel myself waivering in my<br/>
&gt; convictions? yes!!! And usually when that happens, I come to my lists<br/>
&gt; and talk it out with other unschoolers and friends and I am reminded<br/>
&gt; of our past successes and I am told to chill. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729466989">About limits and teens, I remember them very well myself. My parents, especially my dad, were extremely controlling. I remember being 14-17 and my parents didn&#39;t let me do ANYTHING. My dad always told me he &quot;knew&quot; if he let me go out and do things, I would get pregnant or get in trouble or do something to embarras him. I was already untrustworthy and guilty before I even had a chance prove myself otherwise. I was (and still am) very resentful of this treatment.<br/>
<br/>
In my mind, I knew my own standards of behavior, my own morals and ethics. I knew I didn&#39;t want to get pregnant or take drugs. I just wanted freedom. My parent&#39;s treatment of me made me feel very sad and angry. I had to resort to sneaking around. I am still very sneaky, learned it way back then. I remember my dad even opened, read and confiscated some of my private letters I was writing to a friend (who was a boy). I couldn&#39;t even get phone calls. This probably all sounds extreme, and it was, to me. I know you all probably don&#39;t go this far with social limits on your kids, but I have some of the worst memories of that time in my life.<br/>
<br/>
When I finally was given *some* freedom, it was when I was a senior in high school and beyond. I had a small group of friends. I was exposed to sex, drugs, drinking, but because my own beliefs were so strong, I chose to follow a pretty straight and narrow path and not mess myself up. But it wasn&#39;t because of my parents limits when I was a younger teen. That really just made things worse in my mind. I was okay all along, really I was. I felt slighted by my parents because they didn&#39;t trust me. I probably would have appreciated a more open line of communication with them instead of &quot;you&#39;ll do as I say because I said so&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not quite sure yet how I will handle things with my boys (who are 8 & 10) when the time comes, but like everything else I&#39;ve learned, I will try to make their experience with friends, dating, and my trust in them more positive than mine was when I was growing up. <br/>

Third, if you read my version of &quot;no TV limits&quot; you&#39;ll see that I don&#39;t just<br/>

system. You&#39;re obviously doing something right. Growing up, I also <br/>
learned values from my parents in terms<br/>
of how to live and I&#39;m very thankful for the lessons, for they still guide<br/>
me to this day. I think that at some point, most kids do want to stretch<br/>
their wings and try new things. It&#39;s normal. Some kids will do this in a<br/>
responisble way, some won&#39;t and some kids&#39; behavior will fall somewhere in<br/>
between. My point is, though, that I don&#39;t think one can always make<br/>
blanket statements such as &quot;kids who grow up w/limits placed on them will<br/>
go wild first chance they get and make bad choices&quot; or &quot;kids who grow up<br/>
guided by thoughtful parents who trust them to make good decisions for<br/>
themselves will grow up accordingly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I grew up w/some kids who had very strict parents who went wild when they<br/>
got out from under their parents&#39; thumbs. I also knew kids who had strict<br/>
parents and these kids continued to walk the straight and narrow into<br/>
adulthood. I had friends who grew up w/more unschooling type parents and<br/>
these kids never learned to set limits for themselves and ended up in bad<br/>
situations w/drugs. I also had one friend w/very progressive parents who<br/>
gave him a lot of freedom growing up and he was one of the most studious,<br/>
responsible guys I knew. So there&#39;s no magic formula. We just all do our<br/>
best and hope for the best when it comes to our kids.<br/>

person one would ever call a prude! I don&#39;t think drinking and having sex<br/>
and drinking are bad. I do think that kids junior high school age are too<br/>
young to be having sex and getting wasted. I spent time in France as a<br/>
teenager and was very impressed that the teens I met there were allowed to<br/>
drink wine w/their parents at dinner. It seemed a good way for kids to<br/>
learn responsible drinking. I was told by my french hosts that french<br/>
teens don&#39;t binge on alchol the way american kids do bc of this. However,<br/>
when I was older, in college and studying in Paris, I met french students<br/>
there who were responsible drinkers and some who weren&#39;t, so clearly,<br/>
other factors come into play.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that there is such a thing as responsible TV viewing. And when<br/>
my son is older (he is five now), he will able to learn what that is as he<br/>
gets more freedom in that regard. As for now, I&#39;m hoping that growing up<br/>
in our TV-restricted household will teach him how to amuse himself in<br/>
other, more healthy ways. <br/>
