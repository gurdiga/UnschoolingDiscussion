<div id="ygrps-yiv-280409066">**As far as the first aid kit, just made sure to replace all the basics we had<br/>
used up.  Bandages, antibiotic cream, pain killer, etc..**<br/>
<br/>
I keep a first aid kit in my car, to cover things that might happen while <br/>
we&#39;re out and about. I try to remember to check it over every four months or <br/>
so, and to rotate the stock. If a bandage has been in the kit for a year I <br/>
put a fresh one in and move the old one to the house stockpile where it will <br/>
almost certainly be used within six months. And so on. The car kit hasn&#39;t <br/>
been used very much in the five years I&#39;ve kept it, but we were very very <br/>
grateful to have it those few times we needed it.<br/>
