TAAS.  This is not a particularly demanding test, and all the focus seems to <br/>

So we are going to spend lots and lots of hours aiming at the lower half of <br/>

Oh goodie.<br/>

Now, where was that web page about the Independent Party.  They may lose but <br/>
at least I don&#39;t have to hear this particular brand of hogwash.  <br/>

There is a group getting together to push the other parties forward for the<br/>
next election as it is obvious that a vote for them this year would only<br/>
assist Dubya in his goal of becoming all powerful dictator.  If a power<br/>
base is started now instead of waiting for the next election then we, the<br/>
independent thinks will have a chance of actually winning an election. <br/>
Unfortunately these parties (Libertarian, Green, etc.) always wait until<br/>
the last moment!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-451019883">From what I&#39;ve seen on the Bush net page he is not in favor of <br/>
putting any restrictions on the homeschooler.  I think KIPP is an <br/>
idea he&#39;s considering for ps.  You have to admit there&#39;s a lot of <br/>
room for improvement in ps for those who can not or do not wish to <br/>
homeschool.  In fact in Tampa, FL area his campaign has a homeschool <br/>
mom who acts as a coordinator contact for homeschool.</div>

to be Libertarians as they are only party that believes in <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling letting parents take care of their kids <br/>
education without intervention from the goverment.<br/>

Hope this hasn&#39;t started another flame war on politics because if it <br/>
