I don&#39;t think this is off topic. I don&#39;t understand how we can have a <br/>
constitution that plainly states that we have freedom of religion, the right to <br/>
pursue happiness, and that all men are created equal and not allow someone to <br/>
marry, not allow someone equal protection. We also have sexual discrimination laws <br/>
yet here we are, no better than before. Heterosexual people don&#39;t get married <br/>
all the time and they have more *couple* rights! I had friends who actually <br/>
had to get a divorce, even though they never married, she never used his name <br/>
... the law said they were married but you can&#39;t. Talk about backwards, asinine, <br/>
oxymoronic crap to me! And that makes me sad too.<br/>

<br/>
I agree that the language we use is powerful.  To me married means <br/>
that you are legally bound together, but there is a huge amount of <br/>
difference in the amount that a married couple works together.  If <br/>
someone is your Partner then the connotation is that they are working <br/>
together with you toward a certain goal.  That is not always the case <br/>
in a marriage.  Sometimes people are just married to their husband or <br/>
wife and they are each working separately toward their own goals.  Ya <br/>
know?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-830210180">IMHO...The word Partner is first to elicit the meaning of <br/>
commoraderie. It implies cooperation too. Marriage in my mind <br/>
implies a combining of, a joining of (for lack of better words). <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is the way most or anyone thinks or even if the <br/>
dictionary proves my idea wrong. It is too bad that the strong <br/>
public connotation of the words has led to SUCH differing beliefs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-811761328">I had a friend when I was about junior high age.  (early 70s)  She had a slumber party every year for her birthday.  Her parents were divorced.  Her aunt lived in the house, and I knew that her mother and aunt shared a bed.  It wasn&#39;t until years later that I learned they were gay, not sisters.  My mom knew all along, but never said anything about it to me at the time and let me go to their house whenever I was invited.  When we finally talked about it years later, my mom was very matter of fact and accepting.  I&#39;m sure it must have affected my feelings about gay couples, that my mom didn&#39;t make an issue of it.  So, that is one thing I learned from my mom - that some couples are the same sex and that&#39;s normal.<br/>

 - not knowing that your friend&#39;s mom was gay for many years after middle school -rather, believing some incorrect assumption...helped you to &#39;normalize&#39; it?<br/>
Please forgive what may come accross as...offensive, I am new here and even if I wasn&#39;t (new) I assure you, attacking is not my line, promise.<br/>
but something isnt sitting right here, with me anyways, <br/>
and its not about gay, good/bad/normal or anything controversial, <br/>
its about being open and honest with my kids...about MY feelings...and allowing my kids to have feelings of their own about the subject, objectively, and to do that, they would have to KNOW what the subject is...<br/>
Avoiding entirely the issue of normalcy, and other potential controversies I would suggest an example;<br/>
every time you have ever seen a bowl of fruit it contained apples and bananas, you have seen green, yellow and red apples, and bananas in many fruit bowls, all of your friends have them on their tables, in their dining rooms, apples and bananas.<br/>
Your best friend had a green looking roundish object in her bowl, with her banana, her mother always referred to the bowl as the bowl, and your mother never said anything, never brought attention to it, you knew she had seen it,and it was sitting in front of everyone- on the dining table. You assumed it was an apple, <br/>
Later you found out it was an avacado, and your mom was very matter of fact and accepting. This helped you to understand that avacados are normal.<br/>
ummm<br/>
ok,<br/>
please do not hesitate to share with me if I am wayyy out of place.<br/>
thanks,mary<br/>

  I had a friend when I was about junior high age.  (early 70s)  She had a slumber party every year for her birthday.  Her parents were divorced.  Her aunt lived in the house, and I knew that her mother and aunt shared a bed.  It wasn&#39;t until years later that I learned they were gay, not sisters.  My mom knew all along, but never said anything about it to me at the time and let me go to their house whenever I was invited.  When we finally talked about it years later, my mom was very matter of fact and accepting.  I&#39;m sure it must have affected my feelings about gay couples, that my mom didn&#39;t make an issue of it.  So, that is one thing I learned from my mom - that some couples are the same sex and that&#39;s normal.<br/>

<br/>
  IMHO...The word Partner is first to elicit the meaning of <br/>
  commoraderie. It implies cooperation too. Marriage in my mind <br/>
  implies a combining of, a joining of (for lack of better words). <br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t know if this is the way most or anyone thinks or even if the <br/>
  dictionary proves my idea wrong. It is too bad that the strong <br/>
  public connotation of the words has led to SUCH differing beliefs.<br/>

<br/>
If two people live together, they do.<br/>
There&#39;s no reason to discuss another couple&#39;s sex lives with our children.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You assumed it was an apple, <br/>
Later you found out it was an avacado, and your mom was very matter of fact <br/>
and accepting. This helped you to understand that avacados are normal.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you find out years later that housemates you knew who were both female or <br/>
both male were in a committed relationship which might or might not have <br/>
included sex, meaning that the relationship was more important than the location of <br/>
the house (if they moved they would have BOTH moved, which can also happen <br/>
with non-coupled housemates, but still...), that does NOT say an apple was an <br/>
avocado.<br/>
<br/>
It says not all apples are &quot;red delicious.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When my kids have known of a heterosexual couple I haven&#39;t said &quot;AND they <br/>
have sex.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They know enough that they know they&#39;re sharing a house and a car.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t need to know more.<br/>
<br/>
In a family in which heterosexual friends are uncommented upon but a gay <br/>
couple either doesn&#39;t exist in that life (parents shun/avoid/have no connection <br/>
with &quot;those people), OR if the parents make a big deal (they&#39;re gay), that&#39;s not <br/>
going to produce the same calm awareness that being matter-of-fact and casual <br/>
does.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine I&#39;ve known since she was nine is now grown, 30&#39;s, in a <br/>
longterm committed relationship with another woman.<br/>
<br/>
When she was younger and discovering she was lesbian, after a heterosexual <br/>
relationship I knew about before, during and after, she came and talked to me <br/>
for a long time, VERY afraid of telling her parents (people I&#39;d known before I <br/>
knew her, and still hung out with, and still do now).  I mentioned by name an <br/>
older (now retired) couple they also socialized with, who were another <br/>
committed lesbian couple and said beause of that I didn&#39;t think it would entirely <br/>
shock them, and maybe she could talk to those women (good friends of hers).<br/>
<br/>
It was interesting to see the light of realization come over her.  She&#39;d <br/>
never considered that they were &quot;a couple,&quot; they were just them!  People she liked <br/>
and knew.<br/>
<br/>
The first wedding my kids ever went to was a lesbian wedding.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be a big deal.  You don&#39;t have to &quot;be honest&quot; to the point <br/>
of making more of something than it is, in a child&#39;s eyes.  And &quot;what it is&quot; <br/>
is a special bond between two people.<br/>

<br/>
It wasn&#39;t completely hidden, if my mom knew about it.  My mom worked in the same hospital as the aunt.  I remember my friend showing me their bedroom that had one large bed in it.  I have no idea what my friend knew about the relationship at that time, but she didn&#39;t feel she had to hide their bedroom from her friends.  Maybe my friend knew, but didn&#39;t know how to talk about it.  Maybe she hoped that I would ask questions about the one bed.  Didn&#39;t occur to me at the time, although it is a tidbit that has stuck in my memory.<br/>
<br/>
However, I agree that it would be great if nobody had to hide their love from anyone, ever.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wednesday, July 30, 2003<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You live next door to a clean-cut, quiet guy. He never plays loud music or <br/>
&gt;throws raucous parties. He doesn&#39;t gossip over the fence, just smiles <br/>
&gt;politely and offers you some tomatoes. His lawn is cared-for, his house is <br/>
&gt;neat as a pin and you get the feeling he doesn&#39;t always lock his front <br/>
&gt;door. He wears Dockers. You hardly know he&#39;s there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And then one day you discover that he has pot in his basement, spends his <br/>
&gt;weekends at peace marches and that guy you&#39;ve seen mowing the yard is his <br/>
&gt;spouse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Allow me to introduce Canada.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Canadians are so quiet that you may have forgotten they&#39;re up there, <br/>
&gt;but they&#39;ve been busy doing some surprising things. It&#39;s like discovering <br/>
&gt;that the mice you are dimly aware of in your attic have been building an <br/>
&gt;espresso machine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Did you realize, for example, that our reliable little tag-along brother <br/>
&gt;never joined the Coalition of the Willing? Canada wasn&#39;t willing, as it <br/>
&gt;turns out, to join the fun in Iraq. I can only assume American diner menus <br/>
&gt;weren&#39;t angrily changed to include &quot;freedom bacon,&quot; because nobody here <br/>
&gt;eats the stuff anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And then there&#39;s the wild drug situation: Canadian doctors are authorized <br/>
&gt;to dispense medical marijuana. Parliament is considering legislation that <br/>
&gt;would not exactly legalize marijuana possession, as you may have heard, <br/>
&gt;but would reduce the penalty for possession of under 15 grams to a fine, <br/>
&gt;like a speeding ticket. This is to allow law enforcement to concentrate <br/>
&gt;resources on traffickers; if your garden is full of wasps, it&#39;s smarter to <br/>
&gt;go for the nest rather than trying to swat every individual bug. Or, in <br/>
&gt;the United States, bong.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, here&#39;s the part that I, as an American, can&#39;t understand. These poor <br/>
&gt;benighted pinkos are doing everything wrong. They have a drug problem: <br/>
&gt;Marijuana offenses have doubled since 1991. And Canada has strict gun <br/>
&gt;control laws, which means that the criminals must all be heavily armed, <br/>
&gt;the law-abiding civilians helpless and the government on the verge of a <br/>
&gt;massive confiscation campaign. (The laws have been in place since the <br/>
&gt;&#39;70s, but I&#39;m sure the government will get around to the confiscation <br/>
&gt;eventually.) They don&#39;t even have a death penalty!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And yet ... nationally, overall crime in Canada has been declining since <br/>
&gt;1991. Violent crimes fell 13 percent in 2002. Of course, there are still <br/>
&gt;crimes committed with guns -- brought in from the United States, which has <br/>
&gt;become the major illegal weapons supplier for all of North America -- but <br/>
&gt;my theory is that the surge in pot-smoking has rendered most criminals too <br/>
&gt;relaxed to commit violent crimes. They&#39;re probably more focused on <br/>
&gt;shoplifting boxes of Ho-Hos from convenience stores.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And then there&#39;s the most reckless move of all: Just last month, Canada <br/>
&gt;decided to allow and recognize same-sex marriages. Merciful moose, what <br/>
&gt;can they be thinking? Will there be married Mounties (they always get <br/>
&gt;their man!)? Dudley Do-Right was sweet on Nell, not Mel! We must be the <br/>
&gt;only ones who really care about families. Not enough to make sure they all <br/>
&gt;have health insurance, of course, but more than those libertines up north.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This sort of behavior is a clear and present danger to all our stereotypes <br/>
&gt;about Canada. It&#39;s supposed to be a cold, wholesome country of polite, <br/>
&gt;beer-drinking hockey players, not founded by freedom-fighters in a bloody <br/>
&gt;revolution but quietly assembled by loyalists and royalists more <br/>
&gt;interested in order and good government than liberty and independence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But if we are the rugged individualists, why do we spend so much of our <br/>
&gt;time trying to get everyone to march in lockstep? And if Canadians are so <br/>
&gt;reserved and moderate, why are they so progressive about letting people do <br/>
&gt;what they want to?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Canadians are, as a nation, less religious than we are, according to <br/>
&gt;polls. As a result, Canada&#39;s government isn&#39;t influenced by large, <br/>
&gt;well-organized religious groups and thus has more in common with those of <br/>
&gt;Scandinavia than those of the United States, or, say, Iran.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Canada signed the Kyoto global warming treaty, lets 19-year-olds drink, <br/>
&gt;has more of its population living in urban areas and accepts more <br/>
&gt;immigrants per capita than the United States.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;These are all things we&#39;ve been told will wreck our society. But I guess <br/>
&gt;Canadians are different, because theirs seems oddly sound.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Like teenagers, we fiercely idolize individual freedom but really demand <br/>
&gt;that everyone be the same. But the Canadians seem more adult -- more <br/>
&gt;secure. They aren&#39;t afraid of foreigners. They aren&#39;t afraid of <br/>
&gt;homosexuality. Most of all, they&#39;re not afraid of each other.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wonder if America will ever be that cool. </span></blockquote></div>

  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] OT? HSDLA and Gay Marriage<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  This may be off-topic...in a lot of ways, it SHOULD be off-topic, except that <br/>
  HSDLA has endorsed it, and it&#39;s not off-topic for MY homeschooling family&#39;s <br/>
  life...so I want to share.<br/>
<br/>
  Beginning tomorrow, October 12th, the anniversary of Matthew Shephard&#39;s <br/>
  death, National Marriage Protection Week, signed by President Bush, begins. One <br/>
  person described this as &quot;National Discriminate Against Committed Gay Couples <br/>
  Week.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t even know what to say...I am just overcome with sadness and anger....<br/>
<br/>
  Kathryn, partner to Beth for thirteen years<br/>
