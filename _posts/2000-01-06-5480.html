&gt; Our children&#39;s museum did a &quot;dig&quot; for preschoolers.  They crumbled cork<br/>
&gt; (I don&#39;t know how, but we live in a wine country so there is plenty of<br/>
&gt; used cork around), could also use sandbox, I think.  Then they buried<br/>
&gt; stuff in it, some tile, I can&#39;t remember what else.  How about some<br/>
&gt; boiled and dried bones from the butcher?  Just make sure no sharp edges<br/>
&gt; that would cut their hands.  Then they supplied paint brushes for the<br/>
&gt; kids to brush off their finds.<br/>
&gt; For older kids, I&#39;d think you&#39;d want to dig a hole somewhere and really<br/>
&gt; bury stuff.  Or check with your local museums and see if there are any<br/>
&gt; real digs in your area for them to observe or participate.<br/>
&gt; Related activity - my friend bought one of those covered plastic storage<br/>
&gt; bins and filled it with rolled oats.  Her son spend hours playing in it<br/>
&gt; with his construction vehicles, and the oats vacuum up easily.  Just put<br/>
&gt; the lid on when not in use.<br/>
&gt; Mary Ellen<br/>
&gt; The darn trouble with cleaning the house is it gets dirty the next day<br/>
&gt; anyway,<br/>
&gt; so skip a week if you have to.  The children are the most important<br/>
&gt; thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195788522">I didn&#39;t see the original post, but we&#39;ve done our own archeology fund stuff <br/>
around here.  I had the kids try to &quot;dig&quot; chocolate chips out of cookies, <br/>
using little picks and paintbrushes.  Then I had them break a cookie in half <br/>
and put it back together (easy); and then quarters, and then to make it <br/>
harder, I had them break 2 cookies into 4 pieces each and have them put those <br/>
together.  I was trying to show them how difficult it is for archeologists to <br/>
dig up stuff without damaging it, and then have to try and put the pieces <br/>
together in a way that works.<br/>
<br/>
They liked that lesson.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521706296">Columbia Valley and Yakima Valley in Southeastern Washington.  We enjoy<br/>
wine touring as a family.  The kids are learning a lot too, even though<br/>
they don&#39;t like wine.<br/>
Watch out Southern CA!<br/>

Oh, please, feel free to use it.  I can&#39;t remember where I got the idea from, <br/>
but it wasn&#39;t originally mine, so I can&#39;t take the credit for it.  <br/>

 We did this experiment, too. I think it was from Robert Krampf&#39;s Experiment<br/>
of the Week<br/>
  We also did stuff on observations--we have soem acreage and woods. My dh<br/>
and i walked into the woods and put stuff all over that didn&#39;t<br/>
belong(potholder, clothes pin, toy, hair tie, etc) then we went into the<br/>
wood with a bunch of kids and they tried to find the stuff that wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
there naturally.<br/>
We also made sound maps--you sit quietly outside with a paper and pencil.<br/>
Indicate on the paper some land mark ie: a tree, the house and/or the road.<br/>
Listening carefully, map out the sound that you hear and where they are.  My<br/>
kids heard birds, cars, trucks, the dogs&#39; tags rattling, the wind, an<br/>
airplane among other things<br/>
