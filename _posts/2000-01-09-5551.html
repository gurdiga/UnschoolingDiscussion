&lt;&lt; I would guess that the direction of the letters would <br/>
<br/>
become more important when the child begins to write in cursive &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
but then wouldnt it be easier to correct or start them out printing in the <br/>
common direction, so they wouldnt have to relearn it?  or at least later if <br/>
they have to adjust, it would be good rational to let them know why they <br/>
might want to make it another way.  i love when there is a practical reason <br/>
to do something.<br/>
<br/>
btw, i just meant &quot;no-caps erin&quot; referring to the way i type-- not that you <br/>
couldnt capitalize my name or anything.  it doesnt matter much either way to <br/>
me, i just type this way bc for me it is faster.  it only struck me on your <br/>
response when i saw the rest of your post &quot;properly capitalized&quot; and my name <br/>
all small.  i asked for it, though*g* --so i thought now i would clarify!  :) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids learned D&#39;Nealian handwriting in public school.  Basically, it <br/>
teaches printing in a slanted fashion to make it easier to move into cursive. <br/>
 They have a website with printable guides and you can get workbooks at <br/>
teacher stores.<br/>
<br/>
With my 11 year old, I don&#39;t do any handwriting, because she writes in <br/>
cursive much more legibly than I.  My 6 year old didn&#39;t like to write much at <br/>
the beginning of this year, but is doing a lot more now in order to express <br/>
her thoughts.  She has the D&#39;Nealian first grade workbook in her box and <br/>
occasionally pulls out pages to work on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Lisa,<br/>
I am a nurse at a fairly large hospital, and one of our biggest problems<br/>
is legibility of handwriting... by Dr.s. My dh prints everything in<br/>
capital letters, precisely and neatly. I would much rather see a neat<br/>
print than illegible scrawled cursive. This certainly goes to prove that<br/>
# of years in school has no bearing whatsoever on ones handwriting.<br/>
