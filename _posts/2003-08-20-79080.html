<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And who says that I&#39;m trying to dispense advice for how &quot;everyone&quot;<br/>
&gt; should unschool? That&#39;s not my goal at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You need to reread your early posts.  They came across that way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ROFLMAO!!! I might not join in the discussions very often here, but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been a lurker long enough to have witnessed many, many, MANY<br/>
&gt; instances of various members of this group judging various other<br/>
&gt; members of this group, on a quite regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But that&#39;s not what we&#39;re here for, remember?  Read the description....<br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s talk about unschooling!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Going on vacation to Baltimore tomorrow, won&#39;t be around to be judged<br/>
&gt; for the next few days at least...LOL<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have a nice trip.  Watch out for preconceived notions in the road.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Um, Sandra, didn&#39;t you notice that I put a winky at the end of my<br/>
&gt; rant to her<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and later<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I guess I my sarcastic comment was misinterpreted as me saying that....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Winkys&quot; usually work fine to designate humor.  Unfortunately, I some of<br/>
your comments haven&#39;t come across as humor.  More like biting sarcasm that<br/>
the &quot;ha ha&quot; at the end of it doesn&#39;t lighten.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-567870752">**I guess I my sarcastic comment was misinterpreted as me saying that.... **<br/>
<br/>
FYI, sarcasm in a flat, typed forum has to be very broad in order to be <br/>
perceived by the casual reader.<br/>
<br/>
**I guess I my sarcastic comment was misinterpreted as me saying that....**<br/>
<br/>
Stuff can easily be read as less friendly than it really is, or as more <br/>
friendly than it really is.<br/>
<br/>
(Even the single word &quot;thanks&quot; can be flipped someone&#39;s mind from <br/>
sincere to sarcastic and from sarcastic to sincere.  Sometimes context <br/>
clues make it pretty clear which is meant, but not all the time.)<br/>
