<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865317546">Yes, this is a very good article--a major surprise for something this<br/>
insightful to come out of USA Today.  Maybe they&#39;ve improved while I wasn&#39;t<br/>
looking???<br/>
<br/>
I liked this bit the best:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;In the 18th and 19th centuries Americans thought progress meant more<br/>
 </span></blockquote>leisure, Hunnicutt said, but today progress means more goods and services<br/>
and an ever rising quality of life, materialistically speaking.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, he said, Americans have embraced work as a &quot;modern<br/>
religion.&quot;  Work and consumerism and finding things to keep us occupied also<br/>
prevent us from confronting ticklish questions about the purpose and meaning<br/>
of life - and that&#39;s just fine with most of us, Hunnicutt said.&lt;&lt;<br/>
