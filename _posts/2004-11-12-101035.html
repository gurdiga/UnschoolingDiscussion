  &gt; One situation would be :my daughter and him would be playing great and then<br/>
  &gt; the next minute he is hitting or yelling (usually because she does not want to<br/>
  &gt; do things the same way he does). He does not communicate his feelings very<br/>
  &gt; well yet.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;d second the book recommendations and the NoMoreSpanking list.<br/>
<br/>
  In the meantime, I think it will help you look at his behavior differently<br/>
  if you see that he&#39;s reacting out of supreme frustration. It&#39;s not that he<br/>
  doesn&#39;t know better but that when he&#39;s in a situation where he wants things<br/>
  to happen differently he doesn&#39;t know how to make that happen. He only knows<br/>
  he&#39;s not supposed to hit. So he gets frustrated and he hits.<br/>
<br/>
  But understanding why isn&#39;t the same as condoning, of course. You need to<br/>
  stop him each time he&#39;s hitting and yelling at your daughter. (Even keep him<br/>
  occupied by your side if it&#39;s happening too often and getting her stresed<br/>
  out.) She needs to feel safe in her own home and needs to feel that someone<br/>
  will come running if there&#39;s someone trying to hurt her.<br/>
<br/>
  But treat him hitting her separate from helping him learn better ways. He<br/>
  can&#39;t stop being frustrated (and therefore hitting) unitl he has and can use<br/>
  in high emotional times better tools to deal with the sitaution.<br/>
<br/>
  Stopping your daughter from being hurt is one issue. Tell him that&#39;s not an<br/>
  acceptable way to let people know his feelings. You may have to do that a<br/>
  fair number of times.<br/>
<br/>
  But then as a separate issue, help him figure out better ways.<br/>
<br/>
  Sandra had a three step process for kids to go through. (I was going to try<br/>
  to paraphrase but I found a quote :-)<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; When they were little the I&#39;d tell them they couldn&#39;t hit unless they had<br/>
  &gt; first tried to talk about it, THEN get an adult to help them solve their<br/>
  &gt; problem, and if that didn&#39;t help then they could hit.<br/>
