<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224990771">Hello Ang,<br/>
    I remember you quite well!! Hope you and your family are doing <br/>
good. I&#39;ll look over your web pages soon.<br/>
     My daughter had told me awhile back that she had emailed your <br/>
daughter but she must no longer have same email address as it was <br/>
returned.If she&#39;s still interested in writing I&#39;ll have Dominique <br/>
send through your email address if it&#39;s ok w/you?? I know my daughter <br/>
got a little out of the writing mode for a bit (alot like her mother <br/>
LOL!!!)<br/>
    Well, anyway thanks for saying hi. It&#39;s nice to hear from you!!!<br/>
