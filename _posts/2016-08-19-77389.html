 As “Back to School” time approaches around the country, and around the 
world, I’d like to take this opportunity to introduce you to a 
beautiful&nbsp; and inspiring film called<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.etreetdevenir.com/EED.en.html#Accueil">&nbsp;“<span>Being and Becoming</span>”</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">I
 am lucky enough, as US Distribution Coordinator, to have been able to 
watch this film several times, and I am so happy to be able to share it 
with all of you now.​</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Being and Becoming&quot; follows the 
filmmaker’s journey in discovering that other possibilities exist. We 
learn along with her, about unschooling, self-directed learning, 
experiential learning, and that there are many different names for very 
similar philosophies. She meets and interviews families who all have 
amazing and interesting stories.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">Rather than just following the current paradigm, she set off to figure out what would work best for her son and her family.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">And she made an incredible and enlightening film as she learned, and that is what makes it so, so beautiful.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><b>Please read the synopsis here: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br></b></p><p dir="ltr"><b><br></b></p><p dir="ltr"><b><i>Being
 and Becoming explores the theme of trusting children and their 
development, and invites us to question our learning paradigms and 
options.</i></b></p><p dir="ltr"><i><b>The filmmaker takes us on a 
journey of discovery through the US, France, the UK and Germany (where 
it&#39;s illegal not to go to school.) We meet parents who have made the 
choice of not schooling their children, neither at school nor at home, 
but of letting them learn freely what they are truly passionate about.</b></i></p><p dir="ltr"><i><b>It
 is a quest for truth about the innate desire to learn. It belongs to a 
wider theme than education, connected to a change in our belief system 
and to our society&#39;s evolution, as well as to the importance of 
reclaiming one&#39;s life and self-confidence.</b></i></p><p dir="ltr"><i>(99 minutes)</i></p><p dir="ltr"><i><br></i></p><p dir="ltr">Click<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/91040919">&nbsp;here</a>&nbsp;to view the trailer.
