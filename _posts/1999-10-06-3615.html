&lt;&lt; I&#39;m curious?--are you involved with LLL now as a mother? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
hi suzy,<br/>
<br/>
when i first moved into this new town and was a new mom of 3month old i made <br/>
a beeline for the nearest LLL mtg.  i subsequently met some of my dearest <br/>
playgroup mom friends who we now still occasionally gather though our <br/>
children are now 10!!  so, i did attend series meetings and then toddler mtgs <br/>
with my first and second.  but with my 3rd and 4th i have not.  i keep up on <br/>
the local group as i have leader friends, and send anyone i can their way!  <br/>
congratulations on volunteering as a leader, it is much needed and <br/>
appreciated work!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why are parents so afraid of meeting the needs of their babies/children?&gt;&gt;<br/>
i feel as if we have been given a gift of ease and confidence in our <br/>
parenting.  everything is not easy, but it helps so much to be able to meet <br/>
our babies needs so that they are positive people themselves.  it is hard to <br/>
see friends struggle with getting up nights, facing allergy and chronic ear <br/>
problems, etc.  it is rewarding to see children&#39;s trust grow and strengthen <br/>
as they are responded to from day one.  it is such a natural way of parenting <br/>
and definitely influenced our choice to homeschool-- and then unschool.  the <br/>
trust built in the beginning carries onward thru the years...<br/>
