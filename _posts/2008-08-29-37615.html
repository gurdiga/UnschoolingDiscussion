<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329876539">The e-mail below included a post I don&#39;t remember rejecting.  Perhaps  <br/>
another moderator rejected it.  And maybe it was accidentally  <br/>
rejected.  It&#39;s not really important.  What IS important is that if  <br/>
the author could write to several members of this list (or even to a  <br/>
few), why not just send the rejected or lost post directly to the  <br/>
person who requested the help?   Why not write to me as listowner and  <br/>
ask what happened to the post?  Why not just try to repost it if it  <br/>
was a &quot;seems to have been rejected&quot; situation?<br/>
<br/>
When I do reject a post (and it is rare), I write and explain why.<br/>
<br/>
I have more comments below this:<br/>

Date: August 28, 2008 6:33:05 PM MDT<br/>
To: (another list member)<br/>
Subject: New Yahoo Group: RawAlwaysLearning<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As you know, this group is actively moderated, such that many posts<br/>
are rejected by the moderator, and the group never sees them.  This is<br/>
the moderator&#39;s right, as she is the list owner.  I believe that these<br/>
posts would be of interest/value to many in the AlwaysLearningGroup.<br/>
Therefore, I have created a group<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RawAlwaysLearning/)">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RawAlwaysLearning/)</a> where<br/>
AlwaysLearning members may post and discuss posts/topics which have<br/>
been rejected by this list.  Join us!<br/>
<br/>
Here is the first post to the RawAlwaysLearning group, which seems to<br/>
have been rejected by the moderator of the AlwaysLearningGroup:<br/>
<br/>
************************************************************************ <br/>
************<br/>
<br/>
That list was started today and has four members.<br/>
<br/>
Several things about this are irritating, but chief among them is  <br/>
naming the list to match the name of this list.  It&#39;s like stalking.   <br/>
If you want to create a list, do it!  But to create a list based on  <br/>
this one is not healthy, good or right.   A few years back someone  <br/>
who was angry at the moderators of UnschoolingDiscussion created a  <br/>
list called UnschoolingDiscussions, and solicited members from that  <br/>
list (and certainly hoped to catch accidental traffic).  The list  <br/>
lasted a while on badmouthing me and others specifically.  What kind  <br/>
of basis is that for a list?  It&#39;s discourteous at best.  (And  <br/>
they&#39;ve had two posts in all of 2008 so far, so their thought they  <br/>
could do better seems not to have been true.)<br/>
<br/>
This is quite overstated:<br/>
&quot;As you know, this group is actively moderated, such that many posts<br/>
are rejected by the moderator, and the group never sees them. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are not many posts rejected and there are several moderators.   <br/>
Most of the posts rejected lately were purely nasty spam, and  <br/>
phishing sales sites.  You WANT moderation; seriously.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I believe that these posts would be of interest/value to many in  <br/>
the AlwaysLearningGroup. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;These posts&quot;?  There are not &quot;many&quot; of them.   So far, that list is  <br/>
discussing ONE post, which I don&#39;t think I rejected.<br/>
<br/>
And so I would like to ask that anyone who is unhappy with the list  <br/>
either complain to me or just go happily to another list.  Don&#39;t send  <br/>
side e-mails to list members stating untruths and inviting them away  <br/>
from the list.  What a rude, tacky waste of time and energy.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever topics ANYone wants to discuss, there are countless places  <br/>
on the web to discuss them.  This list is not and isn&#39;t trying to be  <br/>
anyone&#39;s be-all and end-all. Be on as many different lists as you  <br/>
want to be on to discuss all the things you want, but I do NOT  <br/>
appreciate someone creating a counter-list, a critical list, a list  <br/>
about my list.<br/>
<br/>
With this, I am asking that the creator of RawAlwaysLearning delete  <br/>
that list from yahoogroups and stop contacting the members of this  <br/>
list.  Don&#39;t even whine or apologize.  Just stop.  People have gotten  <br/>
enough unsolicited mail about it already.  If you want to have  <br/>
another list, don&#39;t name it anything like &quot;AlwaysLearning&quot; and if you  <br/>
want to solicit members from this list do it in a post to the list,  <br/>
not with side mail.   (And I do know the address of the listowner,  <br/>
but as a courtesy I didn&#39;t include it above.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374506562">Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I want to apologize up front for any misunderstanding created by my emails.<br/>
I value this list.  It is a wonderful resource for its members.  Therefore,<br/>
I am not interested at all in inviting people *away* from it.  The<br/>
RawAlwaysLearning group was planned as a *supplement* to it, not to replace<br/>
its valuable content.  That would be duplicative.  <br/>
<br/>
Regarding the number of posts which may have been rejected for reasons other<br/>
than SPAM etc., &quot;many&quot; is a relative term, of course, so what may seem like<br/>
many to me (and the few who have told me about their rejected posts) may not<br/>
seem like many to someone else.  To be more specific, the &quot;many&quot; includes<br/>
posts rejected on unschooling lists in general and not just this one.<br/>
Certainly, no dishonesty is involved--&quot;many&quot; is my honest opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that using a list to criticize others would be an unproductive,<br/>
negative endeavor.  Rather, the supplemental group is intended to give<br/>
unschooling families a place where they might be able (1) use labels more<br/>
freely when they feel that such use is valuable; (2) speak more freely about<br/>
resources beyond &quot;unschooling only&quot; to help children with special needs,<br/>
learning &quot;differences&quot;, or behavioral issues; and (3) speak more freely<br/>
about whether some &quot;personality differences&quot; and &quot;learning differences&quot;<br/>
relate to a diagnosis or biochemical condition.  Members of some unschooling<br/>
lists have expressed to me their intimidation about so speaking.<br/>
<br/>
My purpose in the name of the new group was to describe it as a supplemental<br/>
group.  I can understand how it might feel like &quot;stalking&quot; if one is<br/>
expecting the list to be used to criticize another list.  And I think that<br/>
you raise a good point that it is not necessary for me to include the name<br/>
of this list in the new one, so I plan to set up a replacement name/list.  I<br/>
appreciate your offer to post such an announcement on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Karen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-634075">-=-The RawAlwaysLearning group was planned as a *supplement* to it,  <br/>

<br/>
A secret supplement I wasn&#39;t to know about, though.  A &quot;supplement&quot;  <br/>
about which I wasn&#39;t consulted or informed.  No matter how I squint,  <br/>
it looks very critical.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
But if I rejected half of them, so what?  I hardly ever reject any,  <br/>
but going to individuals and saying that many are rejected when you  <br/>
have no way to know that wasn&#39;t productive.<br/>
<br/>
-=-To be more specific, the &quot;many&quot; includes posts rejected on  <br/>
unschooling lists in general and not just this one.  Certainly, no  <br/>
dishonesty is involved--&quot;many&quot; is my honest opinion.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The statement sent to many people (a countable many, but I don&#39;t want  <br/>
the count) was &quot;As you know...&quot; not &quot;in my opinion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Rather, the supplemental group is intended to give unschooling  <br/>

<br/>
Then I think you should keep it absolutely separate from existing  <br/>
lists and not in reference to them.   If you have a better vision of  <br/>
unschooling, start your own unschooling list, but be honest.  If it&#39;s  <br/>
unschooling with food limits, say so.  If it&#39;s unschooling with  <br/>
labels, say so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-974026045">On the other hand, other list regulars had lighter opinions:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Whenever I hear of an new (alternative or mainstream) treatment  <br/>
for any medical concern in my life, the first thing I do is go over  <br/>
to www.quackwatch.org and do a search on the treatment or the person  <br/>
promulgating it. Sometimes it&#39;s fine, at others I discover  <br/>
questionable practices or that the person is being charged with  <br/>
fraud. I&#39;m always interested in reading the science, including the  <br/>
abstracts of studies available, behind medical breakthroughs and  <br/>
dietary advice. The latter seems to change constantly.-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-They&#39;re going to have a list made up entirely of talking about  <br/>
posts that you rejected? The &quot;Rejected by Sandra&quot; list? I can&#39;t  <br/>
imagine it going anywhere. There is a REASON why those posts are  <br/>
rejected - they&#39;re bad posts of various kinds. So they are going to  <br/>
try to have a list that is nothing but bad posts? I&#39;m laughing pretty  <br/>
hard and trying to tell [someone] about it. She heard the word &quot;raw&quot;  <br/>
in their list name and said, &quot;Ah - the list for &quot;half-baked&quot; ideas?&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=- really it&#39;s not much more than spam. I am mildly curious as to  <br/>
why she would think I would be interested in a list with that  <br/>
description, but I&#39;m not going to open up the conversation with  <br/>
questions.-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t know where else this person would have gotten this e-mail  <br/>
address, because I don&#39;t believe I have *ever* posted under this  <br/>
screenname. Well, it does specifically mention Always Learning, but I  <br/>
was thinking she was talking about a thread I had participated in,  <br/>
but I haven&#39;t that I recall, and I definitely haven&#39;t under [that  <br/>
name]. So, I thought I&#39;d let you know, just in case. It doesn&#39;t  <br/>
bother me a bit-easily deleted.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I&#39;m still pretty unhappy about it.<br/>
I think it&#39;s probably a violation of Yahoo&#39;s terms of service to  <br/>
contact people that way--to have gone through a list to invite people  <br/>
to another list.  I don&#39;t want to turn anyone in about it, I just  <br/>
really don&#39;t want it to happen anymore.<br/>
<br/>
People didn&#39;t join this list to get uninvited e-mails, but only to  <br/>
get posts from the list.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Karen,<br/>
<br/>
As a mom of a child diagnosed with Aspergers, please let me share my <br/>
opinion of this topic that can seem to be really sensitive to some <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
When I was going through this conversation with these same people <br/>
about my son&#39;s label, they helped me learn I was focusing too much on <br/>
the label and not enough on my son directly.  Yes, I found the label <br/>
immensely helpful because it gave me a focus for research to learn <br/>
more about how my son might think differently than my other two <br/>
children.  But I rarely use that label anymore because I can describe <br/>
Jeffrey in other ways.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s say I&#39;m participating in a conversation about kids and video <br/>
games.  Using the label as a description, I might say that Jeffrey <br/>
can spend hours in front of the video game because his Aspergers <br/>
makes him an introvert and gives him a very narrow focus.  Without <br/>
the label, I would say that Jeffrey has a passion for playing his <br/>
video games that brings him great joy.  He gets into his games so <br/>
much that he likes to be alone when playing so he can give them all <br/>
his focus and energy.  The label tends to give a negative slant <br/>
toward the child, whether intended or not.  It&#39;s like saying, &#39;Oh I <br/>
know this isn&#39;t normal and good but my child has XYZ so we can&#39;t help <br/>
it.&#39;  <br/>
<br/>
As for resources, I don&#39;t see why those couldn&#39;t be discussed here, <br/>
unless it&#39;s a disguised way of saying that special needs kids need <br/>
particular curriculum.  I do understand that some people need <br/>
different ways of learning things but I still believe that should be <br/>
looked at in an individual way.  Perhaps someone is thinking their <br/>
child is frustrated because they are expressing a desire to learn to <br/>
read but it&#39;s not coming as natural as they had hoped.  Maybe the <br/>
parent could post that their child wants to learn to read without <br/>
following a phonics method, or without following a whole word method, <br/>
or whatever.  Posed to the list in that specific way, people might <br/>
have some suggestions to help.  <br/>
<br/>
And lastly, personality differences will be and should be noticed in <br/>
every individual.  My son&#39;s personality does not need to be described <br/>
or categorized by a label.  My daughters&#39; personalities aren&#39;t <br/>
defined that way.  They just are who they are, and my son is no <br/>
different in that respect.<br/>
<br/>
I hope some of what I&#39;ve said helps someone.  This topic can usually <br/>
be blown out of proportion fairly quickly.  Someone might jump in and <br/>
say that people affected by specific medical conditions must take <br/>
medication or have specific therapy or require special needs.  I <br/>
don&#39;t believe anyone on this list denies that fact.  But I think the <br/>
important thing is to look at each child&#39;s needs and wants <br/>
individually, as a person, and not as a group under a label umbrella.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
EXACTLY!<br/>
<br/>
I think anyone starting a list about &quot;unschoolers ok with labels&quot; is<br/>
under some delusion that this kind of viewpoing isn&#39;t EASY to find out<br/>
there. Just about EVERY list or discussion about kids dealing with any<br/>
label, are really INTO those labels, finding labels for kids and<br/>
trying to &quot;fix&quot; the child rather than adapt the parenting style and<br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to even bring this up, because I&#39;m honestly tired of seeing<br/>
people through labels of any &quot;disability&quot; or &quot;disorder&quot;. I think what<br/>
we as a society consider &quot;normal&quot; is what&#39;s screwed up. BUT, my<br/>
youngest child would have definitely been labeled &quot;on the spectrum&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
How would I know this? We chose to do some Neuro-feedback (like<br/>
biofeedback but a lot more therapeutic) about a year ago. It was done<br/>
by a close friend who supports our parenting style 100% and is very<br/>
patient and gentle with my son when he&#39;s melting down or being intense<br/>
in some manner.<br/>
<br/>
The intake form she did was VERY thorough. It took me about two hours<br/>
to go through it with her (without my child there). The psychologist<br/>
mentoring her during this process confirmed my suspicions that he<br/>
would have been labeled &quot;Aspergers&quot; or something &quot;on the spectrum&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I never sought that opinion. Mary knew I had done research and needed<br/>
to understand my child to better support his needs. I had taken my<br/>
personal research to her as a friend who understood how I NEVER, EVER<br/>
wanted to seek out a &quot;fix&quot; or label him in any way. So in the end, I<br/>
did get a professional opinion that he would be diagnosed with exactly<br/>
what I suspected.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason the research even happened was in an effort for ME to<br/>
learn and grow and understand how to support my child. It was so<br/>
important at one phase in our journey. <br/>
<br/>
Rather than trying to make him fit the environment, we try to create<br/>
environments in which he can fully blossom. As he gets older, his<br/>
intensities lessen, he finds more coping tools and things get better<br/>
for him. Just like all of us. I have a feeling that most of what would<br/>
have gotten labeled in him, will have disappeared by the time he&#39;s an<br/>
adult. All that therapy and crap that gets shoved on these kids can do<br/>
a lot of damage to their sense of self....which is HUGE.<br/>
<br/>
The Neurofeedback lasted a few sessions, he decided he was done with<br/>
it and we didn&#39;t pursue it again. He now asks Mary if he can play the<br/>
&quot;brain games&quot; when he&#39;s at her house sometimes. They helped him feel<br/>
really calm and soothed. I did it with him and I loved how soothing it<br/>
was. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the entire point of this is so that in a discussion like this<br/>
people can&#39;t say &quot;oh, you just don&#39;t understand&quot;. I DO understand. I<br/>
understand that there are very FEW places in the entire WORLD that<br/>
will help you see your child as PERFECT exactly as they are and try to<br/>
give you tools for being a more effective parent without trying to<br/>
alter your child.<br/>
<br/>
There are very FEW places that will encourage you to drop labels and<br/>
grow more as a human being. This is one such place. Why on earth<br/>
create yet ANOTHER place that is &quot;ok with labels&quot;???<br/>
<br/>
The world has enough of that readily available EVERYWHERE you turn.<br/>

Yes.  it&#39;s a way that people bat our information away, by saying &quot;Oh,  <br/>

<br/>
When Kirby was nine and I was participating on AOL discussions,  <br/>
someone wrote that my oldest was nine, so others could disregard me  <br/>
(ignore me, I forget the exact term used in the put-down).  When  <br/>
Kirby was nine, I&#39;d been practicing attachment parenting for nine  <br/>
years, he&#39;d been going to bed when he was tired, and I wasn&#39;t trying  <br/>
to &quot;put him down for a nap&quot; or any such thing.  He could eat when and  <br/>
what he wanted.  He could watch videos or tv, and he could play  <br/>
outside naked in the rain.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was nine, I had been unschooling for part or most of five  <br/>
years,  had read everything I could find on the topic and  <br/>
participated in usergroups and message boards as soon as I could find  <br/>
any on *Prodigy and then AOL.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier for people to find ways to ignore this list than it is  <br/>
for people to go to the effort to examine their own behaviors and  <br/>
beliefs in ways that could make their children&#39;s lives easier.<br/>

Ren, that&#39;s so much work.  You *could* have just relaxed and said  <br/>
&quot;He&#39;s Asperger&#39;s, so his behavior can&#39;t be helped,&quot; and sat back  <br/>
drinking in the shade with other moms while the kids all worked it  <br/>
out themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894705476">Yes.  I can&#39;t tell that Ren has worked hard because it looks to me like her<br/>
child can take the credit for what a wonderful kid he is.  Things I didn&#39;t<br/>
expect: smiling at people he doesn&#39;t know very well; confidence; busy about<br/>
his own thing and inclusive of others.<br/>
<br/>
What a nice guy.  I can&#39;t tell his mother has &quot;worked&quot; on him at all.  I<br/>
made the comment the other day that nothing of him has been chipped away.<br/>
He is just so much more himSelf than ever.  Ren doesn&#39;t talk about any of<br/>
this stuff in real life.  He looks thrilled about life.  I *know* Ren is<br/>
thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes labels are about garnering parental credit, and garnering credit<br/>
for professionals (after all it is their bread and butter).  Labels make it<br/>
convenient to point to the child and give him &quot;credit&quot; for the problem and<br/>
then turn around and try to take credit themselves for solutions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not always that way, but it&#39;s too typically that way and hurts<br/>
children&#39;s happiness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144205171">-=-There are very FEW places that will encourage you to drop labels and<br/>
grow more as a human being. This is one such place. Why on earth<br/>
create yet ANOTHER place that is &quot;ok with labels&quot;???-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know a reason NOT to create a place that encourages the use of labels.<br/>
<br/>
Every time a child is labelled he is harmed.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent starts out treating the child as an individual and  <br/>
respecting and accepting and helping and guiding and coaching, a  <br/>
whole child gets bigger and better.   IF (if if if) for some reason  <br/>
it becomes necessary or advisable later for that child to learn some  <br/>
ways that he is like other problematical children, he can handle  <br/>
learning that when he&#39;s twelve or fifteen better than if he has grown  <br/>
up feeling and believing there was something wrong with him.<br/>
<br/>
You want an example that&#39;s just a little off sides of it?   A family  <br/>
we knew with two biological children adopted three more.  They named  <br/>
them and everything, but they called them &quot;our little Russian girl&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;our Korean boy&quot; and &quot;our Russian boy.&quot;  Right in front of them.   <br/>
For years.  And they were Americans, having been adopted by  <br/>
Americans, but somehow they weren&#39;t.  And they were children of those  <br/>
parents, having been adopted, but clearly they weren&#39;t quite as much  <br/>
as those who were called by their names.<br/>
<br/>
We were in a playgroup and the kids visited back and forth when they  <br/>
were little, and we lost contact, but in the past few years &quot;the  <br/>
little Russian girl&quot; (we use her name but I won&#39;t here) resurfaced in  <br/>
my boys&#39; lives.  She was working in one of the places Kirby worked.    <br/>
She still felt floatily displaced, and like a foster child ore than  <br/>
an adoptee.  Or maybe it was that she figured as soon as she could be  <br/>
out of that house she&#39;d be gone.  And she wasn&#39;t making the best  <br/>
decisions, when she was newly out.  She&#39;d been told what to do and  <br/>
how all those years AND reminded several times a day that she was  <br/>
adopted.  She was constantly referred to and treated as a Russian  <br/>
child adopted by a noble American family.  Labelled like a monkey at  <br/>
the zoo.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby would have been labelled, if he had gone to school at five.  He  <br/>
just wasn&#39;t ready for school yet, but there are names for that, so  <br/>
they can get funding for that, and so the teachers can say &quot;I would  <br/>
have taught him to read but he&#39;s XYZ,&quot; or &quot;We told him to sit down  <br/>
and be quiet, but he&#39;s ABC.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty would have been labelled if he had gone to school.   He&#39;s left- <br/>
handed, that&#39;s obvious.  But there are attributes often associated  <br/>
with left-handedness in boys, and rather than just assume that  <br/>
lefties might have those other traits, they name the other traits and  <br/>
treat them as a &quot;condition.&quot;  Well his &quot;condition&quot; is that he&#39;s just  <br/>
like hundreds of thousands of other lefty-boys his age.  Math will be  <br/>
easier than reading for all of them.  Big deal.  It doesn&#39;t need &quot;the  <br/>
D word.&quot;  (Duh.)  But schools are NOT set up to treat children as  <br/>
individuals, and increasingly they&#39;re set up to treat children as  <br/>
aberrations, as diseases, as pathologies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works the same way for every child.  To sort your  <br/>
children out into gifted and challenged and ADHD or ADD (carefully  <br/>
noting the differences) and dyslexic and intense and explosive and  <br/>
sensitive and  introverted and spectrum, or if you want to lean  <br/>
toward indigo, old-soul, psychic or changeling... it&#39;s all counter- <br/>
productive to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to think about your child&#39;s learning preferences and  <br/>
talents look here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/intelligences">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences</a><br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t use it to label them.   Use it to gain your own understanding  <br/>
that every human has strengths and weaknesses and we shouldn&#39;t expect  <br/>
anyone to learn the same way another person learns.   When children  <br/>
are already being nurtured in individual ways, bringing in outside  <br/>
labels will hurt; it won&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When there are unschooling lists helping people deal with their  <br/>
children in ways that will work for any and every child, an  <br/>
unschooling list that tells people to ignore the advice against  <br/>
sorting and labeling will hurt; it won&#39;t help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree here- my youngest would also be &quot;somewhere&quot; on the spectrum and<br/>
it is she who led me to search out &quot;other&quot; parenting styles because I<br/>
know that with conventional parenting she would be the &quot;always be in<br/>
trouble&quot; kid - in fact she has a cousin born 3 days before her and they<br/>
have had almost identical personalities since birth and to see the<br/>
difference in them NOW is like night and day<br/>
<br/>
I would never never trade my little girl and unschooling- her cousin and<br/>
her are now almost 4 and he is going to attend preschool and I can<br/>
already see that he will already be the kid that &quot;does not listen or<br/>
focus&quot; and I bet that before too many years pass he will be ADD labelled<br/>
or something eles<br/>
<br/>
In contrast my little girl is still intense but with unschooling has<br/>
mellowed So much. My husband is home for two weeks from overseas and we<br/>
are waiting for a baby to be born and she has been reverting to some<br/>
pre-unschooling behaviors which make me realize just how far she has<br/>
come and I am so thankful for NOT giving her a label just to justify her<br/>
behaviors<br/>
<br/>
labels do not help - they may be slightly comforting but in the end you<br/>
have to see your child and NOT the label- until you can see past the<br/>
label you are only seeing the label<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly! There&#39;s a higher level of mental and physical energy that time and <br/>
time again Unschoolers are willing to expend. It&#39;s inspiring.<br/>
<br/>
And I have come to just assume that all parents will do whatever it takes. <br/>
It takes a thumping great reminder that most won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
The short story is that Jayn and one of her friends had an altercation at <br/>
her house, and it turned out that the mom was taking a nap in the other room <br/>
so Jayn and two siblings had been left unsupervised. All the kids had pretty <br/>
different stories about what happened. The little girl is going through some <br/>
emotional development stuff right now including a lot of big &quot;overreaction&quot; <br/>
screaming to other kids, running to &quot;tell&quot; even when no-one has hurt her, <br/>
which all look like crying out for even more attention than the mom gives <br/>
(who is by no means inattentive!).<br/>
<br/>
We did some email back and forth, and I suggested that the kids really <br/>
needed an adult presence when they play to be more proactive in snuffing out <br/>
conflicts before they became huge, and so that someone observing would know <br/>
what was really happened and be able to sort out the conflicting accounts. I <br/>
expressed my willingness to continue to be present in the room when they <br/>
play here, and always to watch them outside, even with how inconvenient that <br/>
could be for me.<br/>
<br/>
The other mother flat refused to change anything that she was doing, and <br/>
told me she intended to continue to wait to be called if they needed <br/>
mediation - which to give credit where it is due, she is very good at. It <br/>
was up to me to set limits for Jayn at their house. Well the last is <br/>
certainly true, but difficult. In the past I have been guilty of using <br/>
Jayn&#39;s playtime with these kids as a bit of a break for me, when I could get <br/>
some writing or other work done. I suspect the other mom has the same <br/>
feeling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to understand her point of view. It seems to me that she values <br/>
independence and self-sufficiency and wants to give her kids the <br/>
&quot;opportunity&quot; to work stuff out. I guess from an Unschooling pov she is <br/>
pushing them to self-sufficiency. I&#39;m seeing the disparity of age/maturity <br/>
between the three kids as a factor that works against her goals, as well as <br/>
recalling the history of dishonesty that has permeated so many of the <br/>
interactions between them. They need a witness to keep them honest! They <br/>
need even more of our energy. Well I&#39;m willing to give it.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t the first time Ren has inspired me!<br/>

understand!<br/>
<br/>
I agree with *much* of your comments regarding the use of labels.  I would<br/>
really welcome suggestions for more suitable names for the group.  The group<br/>
description includes the following: &quot;...place where they may (1) use labels<br/>
more freely *when they feel that such use is valuable*&quot; [emphasis added].<br/>
In addition, the group is *not* intended to shield members from discussion<br/>
of unproductive uses of labels.  The description further states, &quot;This list<br/>
is about unschooling in general and is not intended to focus on debate about<br/>
labels, etc., although such debate is allowed. This list is simply intended<br/>
to be a bit more inclusive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I recognize that current lists may have been inclusive enough that the<br/>
flavor of posts on the new list will end up being no different.  I am<br/>
offering up the group anyway in case it is helpful to some.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233861975"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hate to even bring this up, because I&#39;m honestly tired of seeing<br/>
&gt; people through labels of any &quot;disability&quot; or &quot;disorder&quot;. I think what<br/>
&gt; we as a society consider &quot;normal&quot; is what&#39;s screwed up. BUT, my<br/>
&gt; youngest child would have definitely been labeled &quot;on the spectrum&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How would I know this? We chose to do some Neuro-feedback (like<br/>
&gt; biofeedback but a lot more therapeutic) about a year ago. It was done<br/>
&gt; by a close friend who supports our parenting style 100% and is very<br/>
&gt; patient and gentle with my son when he&#39;s melting down or being intense<br/>
&gt; in some manner.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The intake form she did was VERY thorough. It took me about two hours<br/>
&gt; to go through it with her (without my child there). The psychologist<br/>
&gt; mentoring her during this process confirmed my suspicions that he<br/>
&gt; would have been labeled &quot;Aspergers&quot; or something &quot;on the spectrum&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I never sought that opinion. Mary knew I had done research and needed<br/>
&gt; to understand my child to better support his needs. I had taken my<br/>
&gt; personal research to her as a friend who understood how I NEVER, EVER<br/>
&gt; wanted to seek out a &quot;fix&quot; or label him in any way. So in the end, I<br/>
&gt; did get a professional opinion that he would be diagnosed with exactly<br/>
&gt; what I suspected.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only reason the research even happened was in an effort for ME to<br/>
&gt; learn and grow and understand how to support my child. It was so<br/>
&gt; important at one phase in our journey. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rather than trying to make him fit the environment, we try to create<br/>
&gt; environments in which he can fully blossom. As he gets older, his<br/>
&gt; intensities lessen, he finds more coping tools and things get better<br/>
&gt; for him. Just like all of us. I have a feeling that most of what would<br/>
&gt; have gotten labeled in him, will have disappeared by the time he&#39;s an<br/>
&gt; adult. All that therapy and crap that gets shoved on these kids can do<br/>
&gt; a lot of damage to their sense of self....which is HUGE.<br/>

&gt; The Neurofeedback lasted a few sessions, he decided he was done with<br/>
&gt; it and we didn&#39;t pursue it again. He now asks Mary if he can play the<br/>
&gt; &quot;brain games&quot; when he&#39;s at her house sometimes. They helped him feel<br/>

&gt; understand that there are very FEW places in the entire WORLD that<br/>
&gt; will help you see your child as PERFECT exactly as they are and try to<br/>
&gt; give you tools for being a more effective parent without trying to<br/>
&gt; alter your child.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are very FEW places that will encourage you to drop labels and<br/>
&gt; grow more as a human being. This is one such place. Why on earth<br/>
&gt; create yet ANOTHER place that is &quot;ok with labels&quot;???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The world has enough of that readily available EVERYWHERE you turn.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think this helps point out what I see as the difference between a<br/>
label and a diagnosis.  No, I do not want to label my child, but we<br/>
did need to better understand him.  We sought out a medical diagnosis.<br/>
 At the time that is what helped *us* help our child.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that he has left public school and we have moved into unschooling,<br/>
the diagnosis is hardly needed.  I say hardly not never.... He enjoys<br/>
a camp with other Tourette Syndrome children in the summer and could<br/>
not continue to attend without his diagnosis.  <br/>
<br/>
What I have found with unschoolers is that I need to do a lot less<br/>
explaining about why he does certain things.  We do not have to<br/>
introduce our child and a list of labels, diagnoses, or personality<br/>
traits - he just IS.  We, as a family, feel more authentic.  He has<br/>
not been cured of Tourette Syndrome or OCD but has found more peace in<br/>
not focusing on it.  If it helps another child or family to know that<br/>
my child has TS or OCD, we will share.  When he goes to TS camp and<br/>
the other kids are bringing in bags and bottles of medications to make<br/>
their behaviour more socially acceptable, maybe he and unschooling can<br/>
be a bit of a testament to alternatives as he has been able to remain<br/>
med free.  Aidan does not mind in the least that people know he has TS<br/>
or OCD and he LOVES unschooling.  Maybe by sharing a diagnosis, we can<br/>
help others who come looking for help for their own children.  I<br/>
understand that each family is different, but in our home, I do not<br/>
think that a child can be made to think less of themselves because of<br/>
a *diagnosis*.  A *label* can be damaging.  If I were to say this is<br/>
my goth daughter Jane, here is my Touretter Aidan, my jock Noel, and<br/>
the baby Gareth - yeah, that would be a problem.  But if for example,<br/>
somebody comes to an unschooling list saying will unschooling work for<br/>
my child with Tourette Syndrome who has accommodations x, y, and z at<br/>
school??  Yep, yes it will AND you can throw away the IEP AND you will<br/>
never have to go to another case conference meeting.<br/>
<br/>
I think sometimes it easier for an always unschooling family to live<br/>
without a diagnosis and a trust in unschooling.  Those of us who got<br/>
there later, may need more concrete examples of how it works.  If it<br/>
helps others, we will share.  <br/>
<br/>
Donna <br/>
<br/>
As a funny coincidence - I checked my mail while composing and editing<br/>
this email.  We just received an invite to a TS family camp weekend in<br/>
May of 2009.  It is extremely unlikely that I would go camping with a<br/>
bunch of public school families when the only thing we may have in<br/>
common is a child with Tourette Syndrome.  On the other hand, we are<br/>
very excited and counting down to our unschooling campout next weekend.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962270317">Further explanation:<br/>
<br/>
The title is intended to get the attention of someone who is seeking an<br/>
unschooling group that *may* not be as reactionary when labels are<br/>
used--those<br/>
who want to spend more discussion time (which may include labels) to help<br/>
their families and less time fielding posts which may feel like<br/>
second-guesses as to whether their use of labels in their own personal<br/>
situations is appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
I recognize that posts challenging the use of labels can be and often are<br/>
extremely useful in helping parents to be more conscious of the impact of<br/>
their use.  As such posts are well represented on other unschooling lists,<br/>
the new list is intended to be a place with a little less &quot;noise&quot; on this<br/>
issue, so that the list may be used more efficiently by those who &quot;get it&quot;<br/>
about labels and want to receive the benefit of the doubt about their<br/>
particular use of labels.  This way they can move on to what they really<br/>
wanted to discuss.  <br/>
<br/>
I really welcome suggestions for approaches to accomplish this goal.  I<br/>
would also be happy if someone wanted to take over this group/project.  I am<br/>
too busy to be tackling this, but I wanted to get it started, because my<br/>
heart goes out to families with special needs.  As such needs are likely<br/>
more common among homeschooling families, I see such a group as that much<br/>
more important within the context of homeschooling.<br/>

<br/>
They SHOULD be second guessing whether their use of labels in their  <br/>
own personal situations is appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
You want to create a group where they&#39;ll be encouraged and comforted  <br/>
about something that is harmful to unschooling.  Why would you want  <br/>
to do that, unless you have something to sell or you yourself like to  <br/>
ignore the fact that labels harm children.  Unless you yourself don&#39;t  <br/>
like the central idea that unschooling involves a change in parental  <br/>
attitude and behavior.<br/>
<br/>
-=-As such posts are well represented on other unschooling lists, the  <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Noise&quot;?  Is that what you call things you were ignoring, maybe?   <br/>
Like &quot;blah blah blah behavior blah blah acceptance&quot; instead of &quot;it&#39;s  <br/>
all about diet and allergies, and the moms don&#39;t need to change  <br/>
anything except to control their children&#39;s diets&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-...so that the list may be used more efficiently by those who &quot;get  <br/>

<br/>
What if there is no doubt.  I think you want to CREATE doubt, and I&#39;m  <br/>
very suspicious of the reasons, increasingly so since the description  <br/>
of your list is changing constantly now.  I guess it won&#39;t be about  <br/>
rejected posts.  And you won&#39;t run it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am too busy to be tackling this, but I wanted to get it started,-=-<br/>
<br/>
Too busy doing what?  If you&#39;re too busy to run that list, you&#39;re  <br/>
probably way too busy to even read this one, so it&#39;s easy for you to  <br/>
state that I&#39;m this way or that about your favorite topics, without  <br/>
really knowing.   It think a search for ADHD or allergies or labels  <br/>
in the archives of this list alone would give you more reading than  <br/>
you could do in a week, yet you think another list is useful.<br/>

I even joined a support group for one of the labels.  I wanted to <br/>

quit after a day or two...all it really made me do was wallow, and <br/>

I made the comment the other day that nothing of him has been chipped<br/>

about any of this stuff in real life. He looks thrilled about life. I<br/>

OMG. You have no idea how nice it was to read this. I am tearing up.<br/>
All that work was about ME and how to BE the best Mom for him. I often<br/>

and I know I&#39;m a great Mom for this child. I&#39;ve learned so much<br/>
because of him.<br/>
<br/>
This paragraph coming from Katherine means so much. Many list members<br/>
don&#39;t know this but she stayed at our house for a week or so and<br/>
Jalen&#39;s intensities were so much that they couldn&#39;t stay any longer. I<br/>
felt so badly, but it was too much for Jalen to handle anyone in his<br/>
home and it was awfully hard on Katherine&#39;s little guy because of that.<br/>

For anyone that didn&#39;t know him a couple years ago, they might think<br/>
I&#39;m making some of the stuff up. So it means a lot to hear from<br/>
someone who has seen changes.<br/>

He IS being fully himself, exactly as every child can be if the<br/>
parents give them trust and room to develop rather than seeing them as<br/>

I think this helps point out what I see as the difference between a<br/>
label and a diagnosis. No, I do not want to label my child, but we<br/>
did need to better understand him. We sought out a medical diagnosis.<br/>
At the time that is what helped *us* help our child.~~<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it can help a child understand themselves better too. But I<br/>
think that the desire for that should be within the individual.<br/>
Sometimes I LIKE the fact that I&#39;ve read and understand the ADD label<br/>
for myself.:) But I chose that, nobody put it on me. And I don&#39;t see<br/>
myself as &quot;an ADD person&quot; but a person that has a lot of &quot;ADD traits&quot;.<br/>
My choice. It would have been very harmful for someone to attach that<br/>
to me. I don&#39;t see it as a disorder either.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the need to have a label for other people too. I have had<br/>
family members or friends look at me strange when he&#39;s cussing or<br/>
otherwise &quot;freaking out&quot; (what it looks like to them) and it&#39;s been<br/>
helpful on occasion to explain it by saying &quot;he has some sensory<br/>
issues&quot; or &quot;he&#39;s highly sensitive&quot;. Both could be harmful, but by<br/>
using it with more mainstream people they could give him space and be<br/>
more forgiving.<br/>
<br/>
We mostly are around VERY respectful and understanding people though,<br/>
so it really hasn&#39;t been an issue for us. The friends we surround<br/>
ourselves with are quite capable of assisting him in respectful ways.<br/>
In fact, he had his very first outing without myself or dh present<br/>
last week. He&#39;s 7.5 and it was a BIG deal to go to a party without us.<br/>
His sister is very good at arbitrating for him and being extremely<br/>
patient (she&#39;s uber amazing that way).<br/>
<br/>
He ran up when I got their exlaiming &quot;I did GREAT Mom...I didn&#39;t get<br/>
scared without you and Dad here the whole time!!&quot;. Then Sierra comes<br/>
up and says &quot;Mom, Jalen did GREAT&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Two different perspectives on what &quot;great&quot; meant.;) Huge milestone for<br/>
him and for all of us. Two years ago I had doubts that we&#39;d ever have<br/>
casual social interactions that didn&#39;t take TONS of energy and<br/>
presence on my part. It&#39;s getting downright EASY these days. <br/>

looking at personalities with a microscope and picking every little darn thing apart.  Ewww!<br/>
<br/>
This topic just came up on a local list--this issue about &quot;gifted vs. challenged.&quot;  My <br/>
contribution was to point out that since unschooling is all about focusing on strengths and <br/>
interests, everyone is gifted, because when a person is operating in their element, they <br/>
shine.  Plain and simple.  And everyone has an element.  I don&#39;t get the insistence on <br/>
making more of it than that.  <br/>
<br/>
All the talk about specialists and resources can certainly cloud the issue, and since it&#39;s not <br/>
a world I&#39;ve ever been in it can seem official and important and like something someone <br/>
might need, although my gut has told me that unschooling can be way better than any of <br/>
it.  I appreciate hearing from everyone who has had direct or indirect experience with it <br/>
that it does seem to be a lot of smoke and mirrors.<br/>

Yes.<br/>
The problem in my mind, is with society&#39;s very narrow view of what is<br/>
&quot;normal&quot;. There are so many AMAZING and talented and beautiful people<br/>
that have some pretty bizarre quirks. If we could just learn how to<br/>
truly embrace every individual as the unique work of art they ARE,<br/>

serious interest and focused attention on his part.<br/>
<br/>
After the first gathering I didn&#39;t see this child for six months. He<br/>

You drive a silver Toyota Sienna.&quot;  After I scooped my jaw off the<br/>
floor I was able to answer him!<br/>

He&#39;s a quirky, intelligent, amazing, beautiful human being. He&#39;s not<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would really love to hear from someone else who has experienced<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this first hand.<br/>
<br/>
My DD had severe ADHD.  Her symptoms included severe hyperactivity<br/>
dangerously combined with impulsivity (such as no thought or care<br/>
before running into a busy street), inability to focus and related<br/>
frustration with herself, very oppositional behavior, poor eye<br/>
contact, difficulty listening, emotional hypersensitivity, social<br/>
anxiety, overwhelmed by clean-up projects.  She would say very<br/>
negative things about herself and had chronic headaches.  Her ADHD<br/>
counterpart of autistic &quot;flapping&quot; was endless somersaulting on our<br/>
ottoman just to keep herself in motion.  Sometimes she would launch<br/>
herself into belly-flops onto the ottoman or a bed just to keep<br/>
herself in motion.  Another repetitive type of behavior would be<br/>
continuous rewinding to listen to a tiny segment of music or a DVD<br/>
over and over again.  It is with untold gratitude to posts on ADHD<br/>
support lists and other research under &quot;ADHD&quot; that these symptoms are<br/>
a thing of the past for her--a nightmare for the whole family that has<br/>
finally ended.<br/>
<br/>
The long, tedious journey through research eventually prompted me to<br/>
try the Feingold Diet and gluten-free casein free, as well as dietary<br/>
supplements.  These all helped tremendously.  Then finally, through<br/>
one of the ADHD lists, I discovered NAET (www.naet.org).  You sure<br/>
won&#39;t hear this in the mainstream, but it turns out that she, like<br/>
most with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, Tourette Syndrome, etc., had many<br/>
types of hidden/internal allergies to various foods and chemicals.<br/>
These allergies result in central-nervous-system blockages as well as<br/>
lack of proper absorption of nutrients from food.  The part of the<br/>
brain involved in ADHD was malnourished/starving.  (There are even<br/>
books about this dietary aspect such as &quot;Children With Starving<br/>
Brains&quot;, &quot;Is This Your Child?&quot;, &quot;The Gut-Brain Connection&quot;, &quot;Healing<br/>
The New Childhood Epidemics: Autism, ADHD, Asthma, and Allergies&quot;, and<br/>
&quot;Say Good-bye To ADD and ADHD&quot;.)  Behavioral allergies to otherwise<br/>
healthy foods are often involved as well.  My DD had behavioral<br/>
reactions to oranges that would last for a good two or three days.<br/>
She also reacted to perfumes, pesticides, food additives.  She was<br/>
found to be allergic to her own dopamine and neurotransmitters.  NAET<br/>
is non-invasive energy medicine that works extremely well (in the<br/>
hands of a quality, experienced practitioner) to eliminate all kinds<br/>
of allergies (which in DD&#39;s case, manifested as behavioral reactions).<br/>
<br/>
The many factors in acquiring such allergies include our Western diets<br/>
and food additives.  As DD is able to understand, I will be teaching<br/>
her about the importance of a healthy diet (which is not the food<br/>
pyramid and not low fat--www.westonaprice.org, www.mercola.com) to<br/>
help prevent her from re-developing allergies, to be vigilant to the<br/>
signs of ADHD that could signal that she has redeveloped allergies, to<br/>
the dangers of allowing any ADHD relapse to go untreated.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, DD&#39;s ADHD was accompanied by the gifts of a fairly<br/>
photographic memory and exceptional creativity...both of which she<br/>
still has!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141719081">~~-a nightmare for the whole family that has<br/>
finally ended.~~<br/>
<br/>
Wow. I missed this one. I am SO sad that a child&#39;s behavior traits<br/>
would be looked at as a &quot;nightmare&quot;. My Scott/Jalen has displayed all<br/>
of the traits that were listed. I don&#39;t see them as a &quot;nightmare&quot; but<br/>
as a part of who-he-is. I just so saddened by this pov.<br/>
<br/>
I also question the &quot;finally ended&quot; because we&#39;ve found that the<br/>
behavior tends to cycle. We had an entire month of absolutely blissful<br/>
interactions followed by a difficult four months. This is a very<br/>
NORMAL part of his development...something I&#39;ve witnessed all along.<br/>
The &quot;easy&quot; cycles get longer and longer, the &quot;difficult&quot; cycles get<br/>
less and less intense.<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;finally ended&quot;?? Really? How long has this been? I don&#39;t believe<br/>
it and I don&#39;t believe that anyone &quot;on the spectrum&quot; can be cured or<br/>
needs to be cured...because it isn&#39;t a disease.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also the address is wrong, but if people want the right one they can  <br/>
find it pretty easily.<br/>
<br/>
When mothers LOVE the idea that limiting a child&#39;s diet can cure a  <br/>
disease/condition  like &quot;ADHD&quot; they&#39;re moving away from unschooling  <br/>
and not toward it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If a child is limited and told what his food is doing to him (or  <br/>
doing to the mom, more like, or to the mom&#39;s idea of peace and  <br/>
perfection) the child is NOT closer to discovering for herself what  <br/>
foods she wants, likes and needs.  Each of my kids has foods they  <br/>
know don&#39;t agree with them one way or another.  They know because  <br/>
since they were little they&#39;ve never been forced to eat any foods,  <br/>
nor had foods forbidden.  They don&#39;t fear food, nor crave particular  <br/>
foods.  They&#39;re open and matter-of-fact with foods, unlike VERY many  <br/>
people around us who put more value on foods for odd, snobby,  <br/>
superstitious or reactionary reasons.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My DD had behavioral reactions to oranges that would last for a  <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Behavioral reactions&quot; will happen for all kinds of reasons, but the  <br/>
backlash from parental limits and shame will cause some BIG  <br/>
behavioral reactions, later if not sooner.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

importance of a healthy diet-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not helping her learn?  Teaching?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-...to be vigilant to the signs of ADHD that could signal that she  <br/>
has redeveloped allergies, to the dangers of allowing any ADHD  <br/>
relapse to go untreated.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The dangers&quot; of ADHD &quot;relapse&quot; sounds like alarmist nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
On the other list it was mentioned (by the same author) that ADHD can  <br/>
be life-threatening.  That&#39;s a HUGE over-reaction.  Parental  <br/>
overcontrol can be life-threatening too.   Drinking water, walking on  <br/>
ice and snow, swimming in the ocean, riding bicycles, eating fish-- <br/>
all life-threatening.<br/>
<br/>
A positive life with allergies seems preferable to a fearful,  <br/>
alarmist negative life with a mom who wants to focus on food instead  <br/>
of people.<br/>
