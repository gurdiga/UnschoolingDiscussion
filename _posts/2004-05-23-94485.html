he got older, but they haven&#39;t.  He&#39;s almost 12 and is struggling socially<br/>

emotionally (all the frustration he feels from trying so hard and not seeing<br/>
the results he hopes for causes him to explode or lash out at times) and<br/>
academically (this one isn&#39;t as bad as the others because we unschool and he<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Three of my four sons were late readers.   I have never had them <br/>
assessed, as I don&#39;t like assessment unless there is something that can <br/>
be done (e.g.. is this arm broken or dislocated).  My #3 son definitely <br/>
had visual problems (e.g.. couldn&#39;t put his finger on a red word written <br/>
on white paper), and other signs that some degree of &#39;dyslexia&#39; was <br/>
involved.<br/>
<br/>
Over the summer when he was 12 1/2yo he learned to read. I don&#39;t know <br/>
exactly when, haven&#39;t a clue how, but his main reading was National <br/>
Geographic.  This is significant for two reasons.  First, I had always <br/>
assumed he would read fiction like the rest of us. He doesn&#39;t. He is 17 <br/>
now and has never read a whole fiction book. Secondly, Lots of bits in <br/>
Nat. Geo. are written over coloured pictures.  As he began to use the <br/>
computer more, he would show me things he had written in Word. I would <br/>
have to change the colours before I could read - he used colour schemes <br/>
like navy blue writing on dark brown background.  His spelling was <br/>
awful. It wasn&#39;t even phonetic, it was pretty damn random, and where <br/>
words were recognisable they were full of reversals etc.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, he&#39;s 17 now, and can read anything HE wants to.  He can write <br/>
in black and white. His spelling has improved hugely - largely through <br/>
chatting on-line using MSM and message boards.<br/>
<br/>
He is a socially oriented kid.  He&#39;s articulate and funny and nice.<br/>
<br/>
He has nearly finished (just 4 weeks to go) a computer course about 2 <br/>
years &#39;ahead&#39; of where he would be if he was in school - and helped the <br/>
tutor with some of the teaching in areas the tutor wasn&#39;t confident in.  <br/>
<br/>
He is a great artist.  <br/>
<br/>
He has never been overly physically confident, and was too scared to go <br/>
on a ferris wheel when he was 14 - but in January of this year bungy <br/>
jumped off The Ledge in Queenstown.  (if you don&#39;t know what bungy <br/>
jumping is, check out <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ajhackett.com">http://www.ajhackett.com</a> )<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 17.  In many ways he&#39;s not the same person as he was when he was <br/>
12, but looking back I can see that, in fact, it was all there waiting <br/>
to develop.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been driving me crazy lately - the combination of a sleep-deprived, <br/>
hot-flushing menopausal country living mother and a 17yo socially active <br/>
teenage boy is not always easy.  Thank you for reminding me what a great <br/>
kid he is - and how wonderfully he has grown since he was a quiet <br/>
non-reading, non-writing, physically nervous12yo kid.<br/>
<br/>
Breathe and remember, &#39;older&#39; is just a point of view.  I have 4 boys <br/>
aged 23, 20, 17 and 14.  Twelve is just a babe to me!  And I can assure <br/>
you that there is a lot of growing, developing, and learning done while <br/>
living between 12 and 23 - and beyond.<br/>

==================<br/>
<br/>
Amen.<br/>
(though I don&#39;t live in the country, quite; the suburbs of the big city of <br/>
Albuquerque)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If people&#39;s kids have real problems and they can find professionals who will <br/>
do more than just say &quot;put him in school,&quot; wonderful.  For every family that <br/>
does that, there will be dozens who are convinced to go to experts when there <br/>
weren&#39;t problems.<br/>
<br/>
For people whose older kids are not doing well socially or with handwriting <br/>
or reading, before being too cranky at the ideas of unschoolers&#39; free advice, <br/>
please consider whether the kids would have been better off had they gone to <br/>
school.   If so, they could&#39;ve gone; might still can.  Schools are full of <br/>
remedial classes and special ed experts.  If not, what were your best options? <br/>

<br/>
Eleven isn&#39;t nearly a teenager.  It&#39;s as close to nine as thirteen.<br/>
<br/>
-=-With my son I tried all of the things suggested by<br/>
her and others on the list; not stressing out, letting him develop at his<br/>
own pace, not pushing things he couldn&#39;t do well and helping him pursue<br/>
things he&#39;s interested in.  I thought things would just fall into place as<br/>
he got older, but they haven&#39;t.  He&#39;s almost 12 and is struggling socially<br/>
(can&#39;t seem to read and interpret non-verbal cues),  physically (won&#39;t even<br/>
attempt most physically challenging activities because he fears failure),<br/>
emotionally (all the frustration he feels from trying so hard and not seeing<br/>
the results he hopes for causes him to explode or lash out at times) and<br/>
academically (this one isn&#39;t as bad as the others because we unschool and he<br/>
doesn&#39;t HAVE to do things he doesn&#39;t want to, but it still frustrates him<br/>
because he can barely write).-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-He&#39;s almost 12 and is struggling socially<br/>
(can&#39;t seem to read and interpret non-verbal cues), -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think half the world is that way.  School wouldn&#39;t have helped.  There is <br/>
no &quot;schooling&quot; (in the school-at-home way) for that.   There&#39;s only talking <br/>
with him, advising him on how to get along better in particular situations, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s so far as something like Aspergers syndrome you could find websites <br/>
or discussion lists of families involved with that and see if they have good, <br/>
useful tools.  If it&#39;s not that serious, helping him gain tools he can use in <br/>
social situations is something people on this list could help with.  Even kids <br/>
with social facility need help and suggestions when situations get tricky.  <br/>
I&#39;ve advised Kirby to tone down his social ease sometimes to give others a <br/>
chance to shine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-letting him develop at his own pace-=-<br/>
<br/>
How is that bad advice?<br/>
Can anyone make someone develop at another pace?<br/>
They can try, but it often results in shut-down or side damage.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What do you do when he&#39;s nearly a teenager, still struggling with these<br/>
things, and embarrassed when he&#39;s with friends and you can&#39;t help him?-=-<br/>
<br/>
What are our options? Advising school?  Live-in mental therapy?  <br/>
Some families use punishments.  I doubt that&#39;s the advice you want.<br/>
<br/>
-=Again, what if he&#39;s still not ready?  My son is really excited about going<br/>
to Camp Invention, but worried about the small amount of writing required<br/>
during the projects.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When Holly was in a summer dance program, I told the teacher she couldn&#39;t <br/>
read so please not to ask her to read aloud in front of other kids.  I asked her <br/>
to tell us what book they were going to use (they were making a stage <br/>
presentation of a book) so we could get a copy and Holly could learn it.  We did that. <br/>
 When the presentation came at the end of the week, Holly knew all the parts <br/>
and some kids didn&#39;t even know their own four-line verse.<br/>
<br/>
You could tell the counsellors he&#39;s having a hard time with writing and ask <br/>
them to help him, not to embarrass him.   <br/>
<br/>
Kirby stalled off taking driver&#39;s ed for a few months in part because he was <br/>
afraid he wouldn&#39;t be able to take notes well enough.  He got a 98 in the <br/>
class when he finally took it.  Those who COULD write fast had no idea what was <br/>
important to write down, or writing it down didn&#39;t help them, or they just <br/>
didn&#39;t bother or something.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My son&#39;s sibling know this, I just can&#39;t seem to get the message across to<br/>
the rest of the world!  And what if you are patient, but they still aren&#39;t<br/>
&quot;able to do it too&quot;?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re patient and you&#39;re being encouraging and being as helpful as you <br/>
can be and that&#39;s not helping and you&#39;re not willing to wait anymore, is school <br/>
one of your options?  School will always take kids.  I&#39;m not recommending it.  <br/>
I&#39;m trying to poke to see what you want in the way of feedback.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  He&#39;s on his own track.  You just need to maintain that track, and give <br/>
him<br/>
lots of things to see, hear, taste, think about...<br/>
****************************************************************************<br/>
***********************<br/>
What if that track involves a lot of pain that could be lessened by<br/>
understanding and helping?-=-<br/>
---------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Where did &quot;maintain that track&quot; ever not include understanding and helping?<br/>
When and where have people on this list ever advised NOT understanding and <br/>
helping (and stayed on the list?  I do remember one saying that suggesting <br/>
things for your kids to do was interfering, but she didn&#39;t stay) ?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-You think he&#39;s got some serious lacks and flaws.  You&#39;re taking him to a<br/>
professional to confirm your concerns.<br/>
****************************************************************************<br/>
*************************<br/>
You can look at that another way. Maybe she&#39;s not seeing lacks and flaws,<br/>
maybe it&#39;s roadblocks that could be removed with the proper help.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a possibility, but it&#39;s not a probability.<br/>
If we treat people&#39;s concerns with panic and advice to run away from unsc<br/>
hooling because it&#39;s a huge dangerous risk and the thing to do is to run your kid <br/>
by and through half a dozen tests and measures to see if he&#39;s going to stay on <br/>
track, or whatever, then why would this discussion even exist?   If <br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t worth examining or doing, we can all put our kids in school.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t going to &quot;work&quot; well or the same for everyone, but that <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean nobody can or should pursue it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know one mom whose son has been DX&#39;d with Aspergers who sits down <br/>
and watches soap operas with her son, with the sound low or off. <br/>
Because soap operas have very exaggerated facial and physical <br/>
emotional reactions, the mom and son discuss what each person in the <br/>
soap opera might be feeling based on their non-verbal clues. This <br/>
struck me as a pretty ingenious and fun way to work on this issue <br/>
together, and help her son through something that comes more <br/>
naturally to most people.<br/>
<br/>
Also, some parents I know have given Stanley Greenspan&#39;s book &quot;The <br/>
Child With Special Needs: Encouraging Intellectual and Emotional <br/>
Growth&quot; really good reviews. Greenspan has gone against a large <br/>
portion of the medical and therapeutical establishment in maintaining <br/>
that parents can provide a huge role in helping kids. As far as I can <br/>
tell (i haven&#39;t read this book), he emphasizes getting down with your <br/>
kids, following their lead, and building on their own interests. He <br/>
calls this method &quot;Floortime&quot; and it is the subject of huge debate in <br/>
the medical/psychological establishment. I have no idea how <br/>
schoolish/not schoolish his ideas are in general, but his book might <br/>
provide some helpful things that a parent could try with their child <br/>
who wants to change their social interactions.<br/>

that unschooling is the best thing for my son, I have NO plans to consider<br/>
putting him in school.  I&#39;m not saying &quot;There&#39;s a problem, so I better put<br/>
him in school&quot;!  What I was saying is that although I am letting him develop<br/>
at his own pace and trying to help him with things he finds difficult, I<br/>
think sometimes it&#39;s helpful to get outside help. I want to understand<br/>
what&#39;s going on so that I can help him, not to label him for school.<br/>
<br/>
One thing Sandra said was:  If it&#39;s so far as something like Aspersers<br/>
syndrome you could find websites or discussion lists of families involved<br/>
with that and see if they have good, useful tools.  That&#39;s what I suggested<br/>
to the original poster, some websites to check out to see if they would be<br/>
helpful.  But many people just said &quot;Wait, and he&#39;ll be fine&quot;. That may or<br/>
may not be.  But what if you see problems, but aren&#39;t really sure exactly<br/>
what they are?  That&#39;s where I think an expert opinion could be useful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-You think he&#39;s got some serious lacks and flaws.  You&#39;re taking him to a<br/>
professional to confirm your concerns.<br/>
****************************************************************************<br/>
*************************<br/>
You can look at that another way. Maybe she&#39;s not seeing lacks and flaws,<br/>
maybe it&#39;s roadblocks that could be removed with the proper help.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a possibility, but it&#39;s not a probability.<br/>
If we treat people&#39;s concerns with panic and advice to run away from<br/>
unschooling because it&#39;s a huge dangerous risk and the thing to do is to run<br/>
your kid by and through half a dozen tests and measures to see if he&#39;s going<br/>
to stay on <br/>
track, or whatever, then why would this discussion even exist?   If <br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t worth examining or doing, we can all put our kids in<br/>
school.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one has said ANYTHING about panicking, or running away from unschooling.<br/>
I said that testing or evaluations COULD help to identify the roadblocks<br/>
that the child and parent could, together, work on removing.<br/>

&lt;&lt; What do you do when he&#39;s nearly a teenager, still struggling with these<br/>
things, and embarrassed when he&#39;s with friends and you can&#39;t help him? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Eleven isn&#39;t nearly a teenager.  It&#39;s as close to nine as thirteen.<br/>
<br/>
-=-With my son I tried all of the things suggested by her and others on the<br/>
list; not stressing out, letting him develop at his own pace, not pushing<br/>
things he couldn&#39;t do well and helping him pursue things he&#39;s interested in.<br/>
I thought things would just fall into place as he got older, but they<br/>
haven&#39;t.  He&#39;s almost 12 and is struggling socially (can&#39;t seem to read and<br/>
interpret non-verbal cues),  physically (won&#39;t even attempt most physically<br/>
challenging activities because he fears failure), emotionally (all the<br/>
frustration he feels from trying so hard and not seeing the results he hopes<br/>
for causes him to explode or lash out at times) and academically (this one<br/>
isn&#39;t as bad as the others because we unschool and he doesn&#39;t HAVE to do<br/>
things he doesn&#39;t want to, but it still frustrates him because he can barely<br/>
write).-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-He&#39;s almost 12 and is struggling socially (can&#39;t seem to read and<br/>
interpret non-verbal cues), -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think half the world is that way.  School wouldn&#39;t have helped.  There is <br/>
no &quot;schooling&quot; (in the school-at-home way) for that.   There&#39;s only talking <br/>
with him, advising him on how to get along better in particular situations,<br/>
etc.  <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s so far as something like Aspergers syndrome you could find websites<br/>
or discussion lists of families involved with that and see if they have<br/>
good, useful tools.  If it&#39;s not that serious, helping him gain tools he can<br/>
use in social situations is something people on this list could help with.<br/>
Even kids with social facility need help and suggestions when situations get<br/>
tricky.  <br/>
I&#39;ve advised Kirby to tone down his social ease sometimes to give others a<br/>
chance to shine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-letting him develop at his own pace-=-<br/>
<br/>
How is that bad advice?<br/>
Can anyone make someone develop at another pace?<br/>
They can try, but it often results in shut-down or side damage.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What do you do when he&#39;s nearly a teenager, still struggling with these<br/>
things, and embarrassed when he&#39;s with friends and you can&#39;t help him?-=-<br/>
<br/>
What are our options? Advising school?  Live-in mental therapy?  <br/>
Some families use punishments.  I doubt that&#39;s the advice you want.<br/>
<br/>
-=Again, what if he&#39;s still not ready?  My son is really excited about going<br/>
to Camp Invention, but worried about the small amount of writing required<br/>
during the projects.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When Holly was in a summer dance program, I told the teacher she couldn&#39;t<br/>
read so please not to ask her to read aloud in front of other kids.  I asked<br/>
her to tell us what book they were going to use (they were making a stage<br/>
presentation of a book) so we could get a copy and Holly could learn it.  We<br/>
did that. <br/>
 When the presentation came at the end of the week, Holly knew all the parts<br/>
and some kids didn&#39;t even know their own four-line verse.<br/>
<br/>
You could tell the counsellors he&#39;s having a hard time with writing and ask <br/>
them to help him, not to embarrass him.   <br/>
<br/>
Kirby stalled off taking driver&#39;s ed for a few months in part because he was<br/>
afraid he wouldn&#39;t be able to take notes well enough.  He got a 98 in the<br/>
class when he finally took it.  Those who COULD write fast had no idea what<br/>
was important to write down, or writing it down didn&#39;t help them, or they<br/>
just didn&#39;t bother or something.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My son&#39;s sibling know this, I just can&#39;t seem to get the message across<br/>
to the rest of the world!  And what if you are patient, but they still<br/>
aren&#39;t &quot;able to do it too&quot;?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re patient and you&#39;re being encouraging and being as helpful as you<br/>
can be and that&#39;s not helping and you&#39;re not willing to wait anymore, is<br/>
school one of your options?  School will always take kids.  I&#39;m not<br/>
recommending it.  <br/>
I&#39;m trying to poke to see what you want in the way of feedback.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  He&#39;s on his own track.  You just need to maintain that track, and give<br/>
him lots of things to see, hear, taste, think about...<br/>
****************************************************************************<br/>
***********************<br/>
What if that track involves a lot of pain that could be lessened by<br/>
understanding and helping?-=-<br/>
---------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Where did &quot;maintain that track&quot; ever not include understanding and helping?<br/>
When and where have people on this list ever advised NOT understanding and<br/>
helping (and stayed on the list?  I do remember one saying that suggesting<br/>
things for your kids to do was interfering, but she didn&#39;t stay) ?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-You think he&#39;s got some serious lacks and flaws.  You&#39;re taking him to a<br/>

hooling because it&#39;s a huge dangerous risk and the thing to do is to run<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t going to &quot;work&quot; well or the same for everyone, but that<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean nobody can or should pursue it.<br/>

counteract the characteristics of Asperger&#39;s and other syndromes. I <br/>
certainly think it&#39;s more unschooler-friendly than many of the more <br/>

as far as I know was the advice to cancel an appointment to a vision <br/>
specialist for a child that had blurry and doubled vision and <br/>
headaches from using his eyes. I haven&#39;t seen anyone say not to get <br/>
down and work with your kid on whatever issues they have. Assuming <br/>
that the original poster does end up going to the vision specialist, <br/>
she&#39;ll get a lot of these exercises to do at home with her kid as <br/>
well, along with some specialized equipment to use in doing so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-705716285">There&#39;s a really interesting book out called The Boy who Loved Windows(I<br/>
think) about a mom who worked with Greenspan to help her autistic son.  If I<br/>
remember it right she spent about 8 hours a day doing &quot;floortime&quot; with him<br/>
as an infant to stimulate him to &quot;overcome&quot; autism.  It&#39;s a very interesting<br/>
book.<br/>
<br/>
Marjorie<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, some parents I know have given Stanley Greenspan&#39;s book &quot;The Child<br/>
With Special Needs: Encouraging Intellectual and Emotional Growth&quot; really<br/>
good reviews. Greenspan has gone against a large portion of the medical and<br/>
therapeutical establishment in maintaining that parents can provide a huge<br/>
role in helping kids. As far as I can tell (i haven&#39;t read this book), he<br/>
emphasizes getting down with your kids, following their lead, and building<br/>
on their own interests. He calls this method &quot;Floortime&quot; and it is the<br/>
subject of huge debate in the medical/psychological establishment. I have no<br/>
idea how schoolish/not schoolish his ideas are in general, but his book<br/>
might provide some helpful things that a parent could try with their child<br/>
who wants to change their social interactions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431239334">A good book on dyslexia is &quot;Overcoming Dyslexia&quot; by Sally Shaywitz, M.D.  Mostly common sense stuff, but somethings that might not occur to you.  Some examples:  large print books, increasing text size on computer monitors, audio books, movies (&quot;Troy&quot; instead of reading &quot;The Illiad&quot;), etc.  Ignore the school bent and take what fits.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, somewhere in there are stories about authors (and others) who still struggle and yet are successful in their chosen field.  Stephen J. Cannell is one who still struggles and yet has written for several TV shows and has also written many novels.   <br/>
 <br/>
Lots of time emailing, chats, im, online gaming, etc. can make vast improvements both in spelling and reading.  Typing can compensate for handwriting difficulties and the word processor will correct some spelling and grammar errors.<br/>
