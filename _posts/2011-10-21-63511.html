<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211319438">Im thinking about unschooling.  We are enrolled in K12 right now.  The<br/>
literature is soo boring.<br/>
<br/>
My question is:  Right now he is very into Minecraft and should I be<br/>
concerned if he wants to play that game almost the entire day?  I dont know<br/>
why Im so worried that he will never find anything he would enjoy as a<br/>
career but it is always in the back of my mind.  I keep thinking he should<br/>
be looking for something he could study on his own so he will be happy as an<br/>
adult making money in something he enjoys.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Brandi, you just joined and Sandra asks that members read for a couple  <br/>
of weeks before posting. This list is different from what people are  <br/>
used to and it saves a lot of hurt feelings if people read for a while  <br/>
before posting.<br/>
<br/>
You should have received an email about this. If you can&#39;t find it,  <br/>
the information is on the front page including links.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
While you&#39;re there, if you go to the Messages page and search on  <br/>
Minecraft there have been several recent discussion that you can read  <br/>
through. (If you&#39;re not familiar with Yahoo, they&#39;ve put 3 different  <br/>
search boxes on that page just to confuse people ;-) It&#39;s the one  <br/>
right above the messages.)<br/>
<br/>
But I allowed this through because this hasn&#39;t come up as a topic  <br/>
recently:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I dont know<br/>

&gt; career but it is always in the back of my mind.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a good worry to take out and examine. Where did it come from?  <br/>
Who gave you the idea he needs to spend his childhood preparing to be  <br/>
an adult? Why is being a child not seen as acceptable by society?  <br/>
Because kids outgrow it? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And why isn&#39;t video games a potential career? The people who designed  <br/>
Minecraft undoubtedly spent their childhoods playing video games! :-)<br/>
<br/>
The learning that comes from video games isn&#39;t just applicable to more  <br/>
video games. Video games tap into real world skills. A lot of the  <br/>
problem solving in video games mimics real life. Read here:<br/>

<br/>
In fact the first link is about Minecraft.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me someone brought a link here recently to an article about  <br/>
how video gamers solved a science problem that had been baffling  <br/>
scientists for years. You may want to keep an eye out for that as you  <br/>
read back through the archives.<br/>
<br/>
Do you play with him? Do you have your own account? The more you know  <br/>
about what your child is interested in, the more connected you are and  <br/>
the more you can help him explore what interests him and connect him  <br/>
with other things that might interest him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I keep thinking he should<br/>

&gt; happy as an<br/>
&gt; adult making money in something he enjoys.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why is being happy right now not a good goal? Really think about that!<br/>
<br/>
Is it reasonable to expect someone to find what they&#39;ll love in the  <br/>
future by doing things they don&#39;t love right now?<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t it make more sense that people will discover all sorts of  <br/>
things they love by exploring what intrigues them? In a rich  <br/>
environment where they&#39;re supported in what they love and have  <br/>
swirling around them other things they could pick up and explore to  <br/>
find potential new loves?<br/>
<br/>
Is he happy choosing Minecraft? But you want him to give up that  <br/>
happiness to do things that would sooth your worries so that he can  <br/>
(you believe) be a happy adult? Where&#39;s the guarantee that will happen?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I keep thinking he should<br/>
&gt; be looking for something he could study<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For one thing, he *is* studying Minecraft right now! He sees the value  <br/>
in it. If you can&#39;t, is it because you&#39;re more knowledgeable about it  <br/>
or because he is?<br/>
<br/>
For another thing: Unschooling is not *not* NOT kids exploring  <br/>
schoolish looking activities on their own! (This is a fairly common  <br/>
misconception.) Unschooling looks exactly like what you&#39;re worried  <br/>
that he&#39;s doing right now: Playing!<br/>
<br/>
We humans play for a reason: It&#39;s how we explore and discover and  <br/>
learn. We learn by exploring what intrigues us and playing &quot;What  <br/>
if...?&quot; &quot;What if I do this? What happens? Why did that happen? Let&#39;s  <br/>
do more and see what happens.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We learn very very poorly by people telling us the answers to  <br/>
questions we haven&#39;t asked yet. IT&#39;s why it takes school so long to do  <br/>
what they do. You may get something out of:<br/>
