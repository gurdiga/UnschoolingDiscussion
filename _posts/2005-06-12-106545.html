If you are right,(and if you didn&#39;t already know this! :-) there is such a <br/>
thing, where the neurons connecting the brain centers of speech to the <br/>
muscles of speech, aren&#39;t strong. A person with this weak neuronal <br/>
connection might also have trouble whistling, puckering up, blowing bubble <br/>
gum bubbles, sipping through a straw, etc. and their speech will be <br/>
difficult to understand. My husband has it, and so does my 10 year old. It <br/>
is called Speech Apraxia, and my belief (after several years of speech <br/>
therapy) is that, with time, the physiological connections will come. I <br/>
think my daughter&#39;s years of speech therapy were...I hate to say wasted, <br/>
but...wasted time and money, which also put her through a bit of sadness <br/>
about herself, as young as four years of age, thinking she must be stupid to <br/>
need lessons to talk. If I could do it again, I would not put her through <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Her speech did get clearer, and her grammar cleared up, too. All around the <br/>
same time, after two years of twice weekly therapy sessions...and the <br/>
grammar cleared up AFTER we quit therapy, without one single &quot;grammar <br/>
lesson.&quot; Of course, I can&#39;t know this for sure, but I know that her grammar <br/>
corrected itself without anyone teaching her, and I wonder (and I think I&#39;m <br/>
right) if her speech wouldn&#39;t have come around eventually without the <br/>
therapy, if I hadn&#39;t got into a panic about it, when she was three. My mil <br/>
told me, she had my hubby in speech therapy when he was a kid, but they <br/>
pulled him out and it corrected itself. Except...he is still sometimes hard <br/>
to understand. My little girl has some speech habits that are &quot;different&quot; <br/>
which have actually gotten comments from people wanting to know what accent <br/>
she has. But she is understandable.<br/>
<br/>
And, she&#39;s 10 and her reading is coming quite slowly, but it IS coming <br/>
along. My hubby was a late reader, too. Your daughter being six is nothing, <br/>
believe me. Expect her to read when her neurons have connected and she&#39;s <br/>
ready, not when the schools say she should be.<br/>

&gt;don&#39;t jive. Because when she concentrates she can say the difficult<br/>
&gt;sounds. It takes practice though, and she gets better<br/>
&gt;with &quot;exercising&quot; the mouth with that sound.<br/>

You see Heidi,...this is why I came *here* to discuss these things. <br/>
THANK YOU. You write what my gut tells me every single day. I don&#39;t <br/>
know if there are different degrees of Apraxia...I need to do some <br/>
research on it - perhaps that is all that it is. <br/>
<br/>
I have felt all along that sending her to speech therapy would be <br/>
inappropriate for her personality. I know this child and I know that <br/>
she would feel horribly isolated going to a school or office, to a <br/>
special room, to learn to talk &quot;properly&quot;. I have suggested it to her <br/>
a couple times and really wish that I could take it back. At first she <br/>
thought it meant going to school (which she was all-for BTW...she is <br/>
one child that thinks she&#39;s missing out on &quot;something&quot; not going to <br/>
school...) until I explained that there would not be playmates there. <br/>
Of course she changed her mind. But I think that even that suggestion <br/>
(once or twice) may have impacted her to some degree.<br/>
<br/>
One time, when she was 3 1/2 I took her to the YMCA and let her stay <br/>
in the babysitting room while I went swimming. When I picked her up <br/>
she was irritable and bothered (much like she was after I would pick <br/>
her up after preschool those 6 weeks that she attended). I aksed her <br/>
what was wrong and she said that the kids kept asking her what her <br/>
name was, &quot;they wouldn&#39;t hear me!&quot; she kept saying. I felt so bad <br/>
because I knew it was that they couldn&#39;t understand her name <br/>
(&quot;Jocelyn&quot; isn&#39;t entirely common anyway). So we talked about it and I <br/>
told her that she should just say that &quot;people call me Joc&quot; since it <br/>
was easier to say. After that I became very aware of the whole, *whats <br/>
your name* moments and she&#39;d look to me for back up. I tried to always <br/>
only respond if she wanted me to.<br/>
<br/>
We just watched home videos from that time period yesterday. In 2.5 <br/>
years she&#39;s come a very, very long way. So it will only get better.</div>
