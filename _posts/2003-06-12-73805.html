<div id="ygrps-yiv-597560540">I just wanted to share my story why I joined an unschooling list.  <br/>
<br/>
 I recently received my license as Kindermusik educator and so I was taking an education course for the first time in my life this spring.  Kindermusik is music for children from 0-7 years old which meets once a week for 45 minutes.  I have a daughter who is just over two and the joy of my life who dislikes groups, likes shopping, and has her own agenda. <br/>
<br/>
I had already purchased some books on home schooling.  I had discovered Usborne books, Mary Pride, Rebecca Rupp, and Practical Homeschooling magazine.  It&#39;s become clear to me that my daughter loves math so I was looking for some math manipulatives.  I found FUN books on the web and ordered some manipulatives and got their catalog.   I was increasingly frustrated with my Kindermusik class and especially my instructor.  The book and videotapes for the class were OK.  They stressed that all responses are acceptable, that the children express themselves, and just to step in if the children were at risk.  The parents are supposed to stay with the under three groups and may leave or stay while the older ones are in class. The age guidelines for each class are suggestions and I can feel free to ignore if necessary.   There are wonderful home materials so that the parents and children can learn and do music together.  Sounded good to me.  But then I had online chats on classroom management.  The instructor said the I MUST follow the age guidelines, the parents must leave the three year olds after the first class or so, and two year olds must learn to take turns.  I criticized the instructor for being late to the online chats and for failing to keep up with grading our assignments.  So then I was in big trouble.  <br/>
<br/>
Then my sister called and said &quot;What was she going to do with Gwen?&quot;  &quot;How was she going to do in kindergarten?&quot;   Gwen is five and is scheduled to start kindergarten this fall.  My niece is reading at a second-grade level and doing math at a third-grade level.  In most other respects, she is at kindergarten level or so.  I had been a volunteer at a church-sponsored preschool/kindergarten.  I knew in my heart that she would get very little from being in a traditional kindergarten setting.  Her only hope would be to have an exceptional teacher which would be unlikely.  So I ordered and read Dumbing Us Down by John Taylor Gatto and Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling Unselves by Allison McKee searching for what to say to my sister.  Dumbing Us Down was wonderful, it explained my Kindermusik instructor so well.  She is a 18 year veteran of the public school system.  Allison McKee&#39;s book was more thought provoking.  So I already believe that the public schools are broken but what to put in their place?   Do children know what they need best?  What did I learn in school anyway?  <br/>
<br/>
I had an exceptional third-grade teacher who let me work at my own pace through math textbook.  I typically did two lessons per day instead of the one the class was assigned.  My teacher was available if I had questions and occasionally (once a week or so) checked my work.  I loved it.  Another one let me read two assignments per day instead of the one which was assigned.  But I was bored so much of the time.  I read a lot, whenever there was a chance.  I was a &#39;good&#39; student with good grades and no behavior problems.  But I needed more.  I did do a lot of self-study outside of school.  I think I learned more outside school than in.  I know I learned algebra from my dad.  My second grade teacher taught me to read after school by tutoring me one on one.  And I still fondly remember my passions - archaeology, geology, ancient history, medieval history, Shakespeare, and the Revolutionary War.  I read everything on those subjects I could and tried to do field experiments for archaeology and geology.  <br/>
<br/>
My life is a work in progress so I did finish and pass the Kindermusik class.  Gwen is still signed up for kindergarten this fall.  I sent some books on painting (from the home schooling references) to them for summer fun.  I&#39;m thinking and trying out unschooling ideas with my daughter.   I think it takes a lot of courage to unschool.  <br/>

Congratulations, Linda. Fly the friendly skies! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Mary Pride and Practical Homeschooling are way to the other edge of <br/>
homeschooling from this group (though I did come across a kind of fan letter from Mary <br/>
Pride the other day &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

Linda, this last line struck a nerve for a few of us. But it&#39;s your &quot;my <br/>
life is a work in progress&quot; that grabbed me.  It&#39;s true of your niece <br/>
and daughter too.<br/>
<br/>
Hold onto the joy of being a witness to that work in progress as <br/>
long as you can. That&#39;s what unschooling is all about.<br/>

After seeing how school affected our older three, it would have taken more<br/>
courage to put my youngest in school.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
