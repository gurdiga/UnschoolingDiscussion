<br/>
Traits don&#39;t necessarily follow a straight line. They can skip generation <br/>
after generation only to resurface many generations later.  Some traits are <br/>
sex-linked, some are recessive, some are mutations. There are MANY explanations for <br/>
why your brother is how he is. <br/>
<br/>
There are NO blondes or green-hazel eyes in my OR my husbad&#39;s <br/>
families---going back &quot;forever&quot;. SO why was our first born almost tow-headed? ( He&#39;s <br/>
brunette, now---go figure!) When the midwife said, &quot;A Blondie!&quot;. My first reaction <br/>
was: he must not be MINE! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can get better and extremely in-depth explanations on some dog and horse <br/>
and cattle and rat breeding lists about genetics. But things don&#39;t always <br/>
appear as they really are: Phenotype vs genotype.<br/>

<br/>
My mom was that way to ten years old.<br/>
Marty was that way. <br/>
<br/>
VERY light hair.<br/>

But Marty also has a blond dad.  So though his head hair is going dark, the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am no expert on this topic, nor do I know if what I am about to say is the<br/>
slightest bit true (though I would be interested to know the facts if there<br/>
are any).  Anyway, when I was pregnant with my oldest, I read about a<br/>
thousand scientific studies and hundreds of books on labor and delivery.  In<br/>
one of the things that I read, it stated that they had found that the<br/>
mothers that had pain killers of some sort during their labor and delivery<br/>
were more likely to have children that grew up to be drug addicts.  They<br/>
were saying that the drug entered into the baby&#39;s blood and created some<br/>
sort of &quot;need&quot; for more.  I found this scary and interesting and I started<br/>
quizzing every drug addict that I personally knew (not many, actually) about<br/>
their births.  My antidotal evidence found that all were born with some sort<br/>
of drug involved and most of their mothers had actually been knocked out<br/>
with the &quot;twilight sleep&quot; stuff that they used to do in the 50s.  That<br/>
helped comfirm my desire to go as drugless as possible during my pregnancies<br/>
and childbirth.  I&#39;ve wondered how much of it was that the mother was<br/>
genetically predisposed to want drugs during labor (for whatever reason) and<br/>
therefore her children would have a higher tendency to want drugs for<br/>
control over pains, too.  I definitely believe that there is something<br/>
genetically involved, but I&#39;m not an expert on what it is precisely.  I<br/>
don&#39;t believe that anyone alive today is.<br/>

growing up. And drank soda. And went to McDonalds. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d taken the same poll of nondrug addicts of the same age, you&#39;d have<br/>
found drugs were just as common in their births too. Just like the births of<br/>
most of the members on this list.<br/>

Wow, that&#39;s interesting. I never heard of that before. If the drug addicts<br/>
you spoke with, even though not many, had moms who had meds, would you<br/>
assume that as coincidence if you knew a whole lot more moms who had meds<br/>
with kids that didn&#39;t do drugs? I can&#39;t honestly say anyone I knew addicted<br/>
to drugs but one had a mom who had meds. The others may, I just never asked.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of my own family. Everyone I knew in my family and my in laws<br/>
family, (women that came after grandma&#39;s) except one women during one birth<br/>
had meds. No one in the family has ever been addicted to drugs but one guy,<br/>
and he&#39;s been clean now for years. I was a 50&#39;s baby and my mom had the<br/>
twilight sleep. Never even knew I was born. I never had a drug problem. I<br/>
did them for fun, and stopped with no problem. Nothing heavy or for long. I<br/>
had meds with all 4 of my kids. So far so good!!!! I&#39;ll let you know how<br/>
they turn out! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Very sadly true!  Like I said before, I really don&#39;t know whether or not<br/>
this study was accurate or not, and it seems to have many flaws that I can<br/>
see in my nonpregnant state.  I wish that I could find it again.  There was<br/>
something about exactly when the mother had drugs that made the difference,<br/>
some critical and crucial point.  And, evironmental factors were not being<br/>
taken into account at all.  They were correlating the babies from the 50s<br/>
with all the drug users of the 70s, without taking into account things like<br/>
the Vietnam war and the style in which that generation was generally<br/>
parented.  My personal point being that there are a lot of factors that<br/>
determine one&#39;s propensity towards addictions.  It would be nice if we could<br/>
determine the causes and flip a switch to turn it off (and that would only<br/>
work if it was 100% genetics).  However, then that person wouldn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily fully be themselves anymore, who knows what other personality<br/>
traits would be turned off at the same time.  Difficult dilemma.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would think that long term drug use by the mothers DURING the pregnancy <br/>
would probably be more influential than what was used during labor.  Remember <br/>
that even into the 60s, doctors had no idea that most drugs could cross the <br/>
placenta.  Tranquilizers were commonly prescribed, and some pregnant women were <br/>
actually TOLD by their doctors to drink brandy before bed.  A fetus exposed to <br/>
that for his or her first several months of life could very well be predisposed <br/>
to addiction, especially if the right genes are also present.<br/>

in recovery for 2 1/2 years.  We bring our girls (both 12 1/2) to our<br/>
meetings...because they WANT to be there.  We discuss our addiction openly<br/>
with them and answer whatever questions they may have.  We realize that our<br/>
children are at a higher risk for addiction because of our addiction, but we<br/>
just trust that if they ever develop an addiction they will remember that AA<br/>
and NA are there for them.  Most of our friends are from AA and the girls<br/>
know their stories and can ask questions.  We don&#39;t keep anything back when<br/>
they ask about our days using alcohol and drugs.  Some days I think about<br/>
the possibility of them developing an addiction and the only thing that<br/>
keeps me sane is that they know where to go if that happens.  They have been<br/>
involved with Ala-Teen (off shoot of AA for children of alcoholics) and that<br/>
helps, too.<br/>
