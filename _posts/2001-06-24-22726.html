<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245798442">Hi! I was wondering if anyone knew about a game a friend of mine told me she <br/>
had heard about. She thinks someone made it up (as in not available in <br/>
stores) and that it sounded real interesting. Does anyone know about this <br/>
*game*? Does anyone know how to make one up? Thanks! :o) ~Nancy<br/>

It&#39;s sort of a game, sort of a tool to awaken awareness of the connections <br/>
between things so people can unschool, I made it up, it&#39;s not available in <br/>
stores, and it&#39;s described at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://expage.com/ThinkingSticks">http://expage.com/ThinkingSticks</a><br/>
<br/>
They were first made for a workshop I did on thinking, at the Mindfull <br/>
conference a few years back.  I&#39;ll have some with me at the HSC <br/>
Home=Education conference in Sacramento in August (<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeedconference.org/)">http://www.homeedconference.org/)</a> but you can order them by mail.  The box is <br/>
cute.  The instructions are the best part.  There are a couple of other <br/>
little surprise bits.  The sticks are themselves pretty (all colors).<br/>
<br/>
Please look!<br/>
