<div id="ygrps-yiv-127160334">Hi everyone.  I&#39;ve decided to delurk after about a week or so.  My<br/>
question is regarding use of computers.  My husband thinks that our<br/>
children (age 4 and 2) should not ever use the computer.  I think that<br/>
the computer could be an invaluable tool.  I have offered to buy them<br/>
their own keyboard, so they won&#39;t gum ours up or anything (although if<br/>
you make rules, that shouldn&#39;t happen anyway!).  He says I&#39;d have to buy<br/>
them their own computer because he doesn&#39;t want them getting into the<br/>
wrong files and messing our stuff up.  He won&#39;t even let them use it with<br/>
me sitting right beside them.<br/>
What does everyone else feel about kids and the use of computers?<br/>

   Right now, my 5 yr old isn&#39;t really interested in computers but.... I am <br/>
constantly trying to get him involved.  Computers are a huge part of <br/>
everyone&#39;s lives now (banks, utilities, communication etc.) and it will only <br/>
get bigger.  Imo, children should be exposed to computers and be allowed to <br/>
explore as early as they are interested in it.  Your children are at the age <br/>
where they would definitely have to have someone sit right there with them, <br/>
but if you are there they can&#39;t get into any files that they shouldn&#39;t right? <br/>
 Are your children interested in the computer yet?<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck =)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629907985">My kids are 7, 5 and 3.  I let them do a few software programs, but I limit it<br/>
quite a bit.  I do the same for TV.  They only watch a bit.  We only own 2<br/>
videos.  If they are using the computer, I am right there with them.  I think<br/>
they have plenty of years to learn about the computer.  Besides it changes so<br/>
rapidly.  I really feel like they are young and should be playing and using<br/>
their imaginations instead of sitting in front of a screen (TV or computer)<br/>

together.<br/>

&gt; question is regarding use of computers.  My husband thinks that our<br/>
&gt; children (age 4 and 2) should not ever use the computer.<br/>

&gt; wrong files and messing our stuff up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is this his primary reason, or is it something else?<br/>
<br/>
If you have a Mac, you can lock files so they can&#39;t get into them by<br/>
accident.  (You may be able to do this on a PC as well, but I don&#39;t know.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He won&#39;t even let them use it with<br/>
&gt; me sitting right beside them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow.  I can&#39;t imagine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What does everyone else feel about kids and the use of computers?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our kids have used computers practically since birth.  They each have their<br/>
own now, not because of concern about them &quot;messing our stuff up&quot; but<br/>
simply because that way we don&#39;t have to argue over turns or time or<br/>
storage space.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When the kids were very young, they liked to type and type and type.  Then<br/>
they learned to use the paint programs.  Now they are better at graphics<br/>
than I am.  They use their computers for many things- from writing to<br/>
programming, graphics to web surfing and web page design, talking to<br/>
friends, writing to grandparents, playing games and creating their own.<br/>
<br/>
To really be able to have a discussion about your husband&#39;s concerns, I&#39;d<br/>
have to know more about what they are.<br/>

sitting in front of a screen, and not using one&#39;s imagination.<br/>
<br/>
Some of what our kids do with a computer *is* &quot;playing and using their<br/>
imaginations&quot;.  They do incredibly creative things.  They aren&#39;t just doing<br/>
e-mail or their taxes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844583852">Hi Jessica,<br/>
<br/>
We have 4 kids at home from 5 - 13 and they all love to use the computer, like their parents!  We have 2 computers and they use both, but mainly stick to the one that has all their software installed.  The kids know how to put in their own CD roms etc.  I know it&#39;s not economically feasible for most families to have two computers, we happen to have a newly blended family and we both had computers when we got married.  The kids know how to put in their own CD roms etc.  The 13 yo probably knows more about computers than I do.  You might mention to your husband that it is possible to set up separate desktops with passwords, so they can&#39;t access your desktop.  You could make either of the desktops the default desktop.  I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible for them to get into your stuff, but they would have to know how to right click and explore the different drives - possible, but not likely.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the children&#39;s section in our library has computers for them to use - maybe yours does too.  Let them learn how to use the computer properly there and maybe your husband will be so impressed he will let them use the home computer.<br/>
<br/>
Hope I Helped!  Good Luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764874962">My youngest could use a mouse by 18 months!!  We have a business at home, and are also gaming addicts to a degree, so while the kids&#39; &#39;puter&#39;s perfectly acceptable for work use (except the screen size) we upgraded when we could afford for the gaming capability, and seeing as they are surpassed so quickly, the second-hand value did not warrant the effort of selling it.  The computer is just another part of our lives.  I use it.  Dh uses it.  Why shouldn&#39;t they use it?  They use the taps for the water, they use the tv, they use the table, the toaster, why should they not use another tool, the computer?  Someone mentioned that children tend to go in spates of things (adults too, if we can) and that a child had done so much Nintendo that he was sick of the sight of it!  I believe that given free access to it, there isn&#39;t the novelty value and it has less of a hold over them.  And I have heard from some on this list who were concerned at the amount of time spent reading, yes, real books, to the detriment of other more active pursuits.  It&#39;s handy for when one wants some quiet time on their own.<br/>
<br/>
We have a couple of different art packages, Art Attack, a cheapo kids&#39; art cd, creativity workshop, and they really do create on it.  We have strategy-type stuff, Rollercoaster Tycoon being an example, which they&#39;re learning cause-and-effect from, ie, people don&#39;t turn green and throw up unless they can get on and off the rides, so you need to build paths which connect up.  They can&#39;t read yet, but it doesn&#39;t stop them from making the most of what&#39;s there, and we do have some &#39;teaching&#39; software (btw, I&#39;m not keen on Dorling Kindersley&#39;s style, a little too judgemental for my taste.  Pingu&#39;s much more up my street :-) )<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I&#39;ve waffled enough!  Perhaps your dh has some specific concerns, lack of physical activity for example, in which case I&#39;d put him in charge of taking them for walks when he can, or something suitable (this is wishful thinking in this house atm, it&#39;s rugby season &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m sure the nz-ers will appreciate!)<br/>

Computers are a direct link to our future. I know that there is no way that<br/>
we can move forward without having to deal with one sooner or later. My<br/>
husband is much like yours. We do have a computer for the children (a 286<br/>
stepped up to a 386), but he does not want them on the Internet. If you want<br/>
backing on your decision to have the children learn computer skills, start<br/>
researching your decision so when you approach your husband, you are well<br/>
informed and show him that you are seriously interested in your children&#39;s<br/>
future. Even fast food stores are moving to computer based systems. Almost<br/>
all factories (I live in Michigan) are computerized. To earn any money, you<br/>
must have computer skills. Krogers is computerized. I would learn all I<br/>
could and then re approach him. Lots of luck-<br/>

&lt;&lt; What does everyone else feel about kids and the use of computers? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s he got on the the computer that kids would possibly be interested in?? <br/>
:):)  I run my word processing software and my husband&#39;s accounting files on <br/>
the same PC the kids use and they have never shown the least interest in <br/>
&quot;exploring&quot; in those files.   Except for the time my son was helping me make <br/>
entries to the checkbook on the computer -- he thought it looked cool but <br/>
quickly became bored with it.  As did I!<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, my kids use the PC all the time -- for Spanish and Math and <br/>
Grammar and Science (latest is Animals and Geography) and Writing and, yes, <br/>
some games.  <br/>
<br/>
And I think it really is the future.  Maybe a good thing, maybe not.  But a <br/>
reality.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, my kids were probably 2 and 4 when they started using the PC.  They now <br/>
know way more than Dad (who is super proud that he can use the Jeopardy CD we <br/>
got him for Christmas!).<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have spills, accidents, at the computer.  Now that you mention it <br/>
this sort of thing happens everywhere else but not at the PC.  I think they <br/>
&quot;get it.&quot;  They&#39;ve been told, etc. -- but I think, for their own selfish <br/>
reasons, they understand how cool the PC is and wouldn&#39;t want to ruin it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it will only become more and more enticing if it is &quot;banned.&quot;  IMO<br/>
<br/>
There are tons of good software programs out there for kids of all ages and <br/>
interests.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s my 2 cents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153664839">Just to add to this discussion.....my 13yo son&#39;s best friend is only allowed one hour of what his parents deem &quot;screen time&quot;.  In other words, one hour of either computer, nintendo, TV, or gameboy per day.  My son has free access to all of these things.  My son&#39;s friend NEVER wants to be at home....always wants to come over here....and he marvels at how much &quot;fun&quot; we all seem to have together. <br/>
<br/>
 His dad wants him to be a doctor.....his dad IS a doctor (so is my husband), though we have always led both of our boys to think about finding their passion and then try to find work that fits it.  Anyway, my son&#39;s friend called up yesterday to ask my son to ask his older brother how much money a computer programmer makes.  Seems that his friend is trying to convince his dad that being a computer programmer can bring in as much money as being a doctor!!  This had my whole family in a discussion of how so many kids are being led to believe that the way to be happy is to make six figures!!  Forget about what brings you joy, just look at the money.  How sad is this? <br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is......this kid has been kept from doing the one thing that he enjoys most.....playing with technology.  It&#39;s become the forbidden fruit, and is now causing a 13yo boy to have to petition his dad to &quot;let&quot; him take on a certain profession one day.  It&#39;s all he dreaming of......being allowed at a keyboard as much as he wants.  How will he ever know what it is he really wants with that kind of control over him?  <br/>
<br/>
My kids&#39; generation will be surrounded by technology, and computers will be running the show, whether we like it or not.  To not allow kids to become computer savvy, to me, will be putting them at an extreme disadvantage in the world.  Just my two cents.<br/>

And I have heard from some on this list who were concerned at the amount of time spent reading, yes, real books, to the detriment of other more active pursuits.  It&#39;s handy for when one wants some quiet time on their own.<br/>
   <br/>
  We have a couple of different art packages, Art Attack, a cheapo kids&#39; art cd, creativity workshop, and they really do create on it.  We have strategy-type stuff, Rollercoaster Tycoon being an example, which they&#39;re learning cause-and-effect from, ie, people don&#39;t turn green and throw up unless they can get on and off the rides, so you need to build paths which connect up.  They can&#39;t read yet, but it doesn&#39;t stop them from making the most of what&#39;s there, and we do have some &#39;teaching&#39; software (btw, I&#39;m not keen on Dorling Kindersley&#39;s style, a little too judgemental for my taste.  Pingu&#39;s much more up my street :-) )<br/>
<br/>
  Anyhow, I&#39;ve waffled enough!  Perhaps your dh has some specific concerns, lack of physical activity for example, in which case I&#39;d put him in charge of taking them for walks when he can, or something suitable (this is wishful thinking in this house atm, it&#39;s rugby season &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m sure the nz-ers will appreciate!)<br/>

    Hi Jessica,<br/>
<br/>
    We have 4 kids at home from 5 - 13 and they all love to use the computer, like their parents!  We have 2 computers and they use both, but mainly stick to the one that has all their software installed.  The kids know how to put in their own CD roms etc.  I know it&#39;s not economically feasible for most families to have two computers, we happen to have a newly blended family and we both had computers when we got married.  The kids know how to put in their own CD roms etc.  The 13 yo probably knows more about computers than I do.  You might mention to your husband that it is possible to set up separate desktops with passwords, so they can&#39;t access your desktop.  You could make either of the desktops the default desktop.  I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible for them to get into your stuff, but they would have to know how to right click and explore the different drives - possible, but not likely.<br/>
<br/>
    Also, the children&#39;s section in our library has computers for them to use - maybe yours does too.  Let them learn how to use the computer properly there and maybe your husband will be so impressed he will let them use the home computer.<br/>
<br/>
    Hope I Helped!  Good Luck<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m not sure.  The only thing I can think of is when you send to the list maybe<br/>
you shouldn&#39;t send in html.  There should be a setting in your preferences in<br/>
your browser for this.  THen, at onelist, My Onelist, member profile, there is<br/>
setting for receiving html or plain text.  I have put mine on plain text to see<br/>
if that helps any.<br/>
Other than that, I don&#39;t know.  I did notice that the ones that don&#39;t come all<br/>
the way in seem to have a different text than all the others.  Anyone know more<br/>
about this?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-493870334">hi,<br/>
<br/>
we bought our son a computer, an imac, when he was 3 1/2.  we found that his<br/>
interest in it comes and goes.  we refrain from overdoing it on control and<br/>
simply tell him what we experience to be true but basically let him make his<br/>
own decisions within the perimeters of safety.  we try not to stand in<br/>
judgment of  anything ( though i must admit we still wrestle with video<br/>
games:), leaving us open to all kinds of possibilities.  personally i believe<br/>
that unschooling is about fostering independence and respect and believe that<br/>
what is paramount is to have lots of info in the form of libraries, both<br/>
books and cd-roms will proof to be invaluable, as well as direct exposure to<br/>
first hand experiences.  also because rene&#39;, who is now 4 1/2,  has so much<br/>
experience and is so independent on the computer (as well as all areas) he<br/>
has been asked to test products - new cd-rom - at his dad&#39;s work (he works<br/>
for a software co.).<br/>
<br/>
i truly think to unschool you must trust that your kids will ultimately<br/>
choose wisely.  that is not to say &#39;sit back and watch&#39;,  you should be<br/>
actively involved, make suggestions, but if your kids really want to sit in<br/>
front of the tv or the computer or run outside or whatever,  you should help<br/>
them make it happen (i.e. lots of toy stories have computer available to use<br/>
and try out software) and see where it takes them - learning is a great<br/>
adventure and it&#39;s most exciting when you have no idea where you&#39;ll end up.<br/>
like watching tv you learn a lot about manipulation of facts and emotions and<br/>
can learn to not believe everything you see, read or hear (an unfortunate<br/>
reality but an extremely important skill to develop) - i nearly always watch<br/>
with my son or am within ear shot so we can talk about about it afterwards.<br/>
also it&#39;s fun to just kick back and enjoy something without worrying about<br/>
&#39;gaining knowledge&#39; -  i think it&#39;s important to remember life&#39;s to be<br/>
enjoyed as well as &#39;mastered&#39; and learning to have fun is equally important<br/>
as skill mastery.<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone.  I&#39;ve decided to delurk after about a week or so.  My<br/>
&gt; question is regarding use of computers.  My husband thinks that our<br/>
&gt; children (age 4 and 2) should not ever use the computer.  I think that<br/>
&gt; the computer could be an invaluable tool.  I have offered to buy them<br/>
&gt; their own keyboard, so they won&#39;t gum ours up or anything (although if<br/>
&gt; you make rules, that shouldn&#39;t happen anyway!).  He says I&#39;d have to buy<br/>
&gt; them their own computer because he doesn&#39;t want them getting into the<br/>
&gt; wrong files and messing our stuff up.  He won&#39;t even let them use it with<br/>
&gt; me sitting right beside them.<br/>
&gt; What does everyone else feel about kids and the use of computers?<br/>

&gt;  Just to add to this discussion.....my 13yo son&#39;s best friend is only<br/>
&gt; allowed one hour of what his parents deem &quot;screen time&quot;.  In other<br/>
&gt; words, one hour of either computer, nintendo, TV, or gameboy per day.<br/>
&gt; My son has free access to all of these things.  My son&#39;s friend NEVER<br/>
&gt; wants to be at home....always wants to come over here....and he<br/>
&gt; marvels at how much &quot;fun&quot; we all seem to have together.<br/>

we find that if you give free access, be it to tv, sugar, whatever it no<br/>
longer rules their life and they tend to make better decisions.  just a<br/>
thought<br/>
