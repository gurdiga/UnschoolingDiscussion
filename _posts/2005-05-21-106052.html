<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076333254">Kirby has t-shirts folded on shelves, socks and underwear in baskets on  <br/>
shelves.<br/>
My closet is that way too, which is where I got the idea. I didn&#39;t want to  <br/>
take the shelves out of my closet, so my few hanging clothes are in my <br/>
husband&#39;s  closet and mine is all shelves.   It works well in stores.<br/>
 <br/>
Holly has some in drawers and some on shelves and a little bit  hanging.  <br/>
 <br/>
Marty has drawers and a few hangers.  He turned his closet into a  &quot;computer <br/>
office.&quot;  He and his dad built a desk and shelves in there.   It was a wide <br/>
shallow closet that lost its cheap folding doors long  ago.<br/>
 <br/>
I fold the clothes and put them in a laundry basket in the room, and then  <br/>
say I need the basket back when I do.  Sometimes they&#39;ll live out of the  clean <br/>
clothes basket for a day or two.  Or I&#39;ll put Marty&#39;s folded stuff on  the end <br/>
of the couch he has right inside his room, and sometimes they stay there  <br/>
until he uses them if he doesn&#39;t feel like putting them away.  Same with  Holly, <br/>
I might put hers in a basket, or on the chest right inside her  room.  Holly <br/>
always puts hers away.  Marty usually.  Kirby... I&#39;m  more likely to put them <br/>
away than he is.<br/>
 <br/>
We have a laundry chute under the bathroom sink upstairs that falls right  <br/>
on/near the washing machine.  It&#39;s not convenient for Kirby, so his dirty  <br/>
clothes get piled in the corner of his bathroom until he brings them down.   He&#39;s <br/>
starting to do his own laundry more.<br/>
 <br/>
Marty and Holly shower in there, so they&#39;re most likely to drop clothes  <br/>
down.  And Marty&#39;s room is right near the laundry room, so he throws dirty  stuff <br/>
out the door and around the corner, which is close.  <br/>

bookshelf, rather than drawers.  Then we put big wire<br/>
baskets on the shelves.  Everthing can be easily<br/>
plopped in without taking out the basket or moving<br/>
anything.  Totally easy, and the clothes get put away<br/>
as I carry them in, because it&#39;s easy to just put them<br/>
down there....<br/>
