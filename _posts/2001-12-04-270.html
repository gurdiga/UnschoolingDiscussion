&gt; consider this group to be a kind of party.  Parties are temporary, and when <br/>
&gt; this one&#39;s not fun anymore we can &quot;go home,&quot; or to other lists or whatever. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad to be here, and am frankly relieved not to swim through lots of <br/>
nasty stuff to find something good to read.<br/>
<br/>
Things I&#39;m bringing to the party: My fabulous family: Wonderous Partner Beth, <br/>
who is a Professional Girl Scout (runs a regional GS Council office), <br/>
passionate musician (plays many instruments, and is now learning violin), <br/>
funny, smart, and the kindest person I know. My twelve year old son Julian, <br/>
as I&#39;ve mentioned before, is a great singer (and loves to sing in public, so <br/>
I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll take requests!), guitar player, loves D&D (maybe we can start <br/>
a game in the corner). Have to warn you--he is apt to quote Monty Python at <br/>
length even if you DON&#39;T request it.<br/>
<br/>
We make great cheesecake, so we&#39;ll share that. I&#39;ll also bring my own Diet <br/>
Coke (I&#39;m a bit of an addict.)<br/>
