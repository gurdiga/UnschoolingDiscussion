     I also have the game.  I noticed that you got a few replies, so I will <br/>
see if you get the instructions from someone else first.  If for some reason <br/>
you don&#39;t get them (if their house is anything like mine :), they may not be <br/>
able to locate it), just let me know.  Hey, I was wondering, do you have a <br/>
printer?  I have a scanner, so I could scan the instructions and e-mail them <br/>
to you, so you could print them up.  It would be alot faster than snail mail. <br/>
 If you want me to do that, just e-mail me privately at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:FreeSchool@...">FreeSchool@...</a>.  <br/>
