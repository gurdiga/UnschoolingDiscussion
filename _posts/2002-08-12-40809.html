<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062991123">&quot;If you think those of us who ask questions about Powerglide, etc. <br/>
are wussy <br/>
about unschooling, you&#39;ve never seen me on my soapbox when someone <br/>
questions <br/>
homeschooling in general and unschooling specifically.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There was nothing wussy about asking for information on Power Glide <br/>
Ginny. Just another bashing from Ned that seems to be common as of <br/>
late......<br/>
I LOVE the Power Glide Spanish. Bought the adult one for myself. <br/>
Which is how I use a lot of things I&#39;d like to expose the kids to, by <br/>
teaching myself.<br/>
I want to learn Spanish, so I do. The overflow of that is the kids <br/>
hear me listening to the tapes and often sit down and want to know <br/>
what is being said. We rewind a lot, I answer questions etc...<br/>
And another great side effect is that by knowing some Spanish, I can <br/>
use it at appropriate times when speaking with them.<br/>
Not much, but a little.<br/>
And even if they never learn Spanish as another language, I think the <br/>
exposure to the idea of teaching oneself a language and hearing the <br/>
foreign sounds is a wonderful benefit.<br/>

Great idea. It&#39;s about time I tried to really learn a language. Any Spanish <br/>
that I&#39;ve picked up when I worked outside the home -- in my former life I was <br/>
an ER nurse/NP, has been minimal and spoken with a quasi-Italian accent -- I <br/>
was an army brat who lived in Verona. Most of the people just laugh. I must <br/>
get some words correct because they usually respond appropriately. <br/>
Thanks for the feedback,<br/>
Ginny, who&#39;s been exposed to multiple languages without learning any of them<br/>
