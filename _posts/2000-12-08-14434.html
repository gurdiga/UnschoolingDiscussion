<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381363801">&lt;&lt;My husband&#39;s a math guy. I told him I only ever liked and understood the word<br/>
problems, but most of my friends hated the word problems. He said the word<br/>
problems are the ONLY problems in math books.  The &quot;number problems&quot; are the<br/>
solutions to unstated problems, without the computations done.&gt;&gt;<br/>
