<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307141860"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have to remind myself that I&#39;m not unschooling to prove anything to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>anyone, but because I believe it&#39;s right for my kids.<br/>
<br/>
This is precisely where I am.  I am constantly vascilating between feeling<br/>
absolutely confident in my choice to being petrified that I am somehow<br/>
failing my children.  The closer we get to high school (both turning 13 this<br/>
year), the more I panic.  I have to bolster myself and remind myself that I<br/>
made an educated decision to unschool because I believe in my heart that<br/>
this is the best choice for my children.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
