<div id="ygrps-yiv-61399163">**But wouldn&#39;t you say that number crunching (learning how to <br/>
<br/>
manipulate the numbers) would provide a framework within which a <br/>
<br/>
person could grasp math? I&#39;m certainly not advocating sitting a kid <br/>
<br/>
down and making him do it...been there done that hated it...but I&#39;m <br/>
<br/>
thinking, an ability to grasp the concepts depends upon the knowledge <br/>
<br/>
of the numbers. Not the numbers on paper NECESSARILY, but the numbers.**<br/>
AND<br/>
**Yea..... Don&#39;t you need to know **how** to do the math with a calculator so <br/>
you can push  the right buttons? Memorizing numbers is not the same as <br/>
***how*** to do it.  <br/>
Lara.........  who still does NOT know her times-tables (and loves her <br/>
calculator), but knows **what** multiplication is!! (Hey!!! I went to pub <br/>
school for <br/>
12 years and graduated  with high honors, AND had a dad who stood over me a <br/>
hit me on the head when I said the wrong answer to the times-table flash <br/>
cards <br/>
he was holding; shouldn&#39;t I know all of them then? hehehe)**<br/>
<br/>
At least one of my children learned an incredible amount about arithmetic and <br/>
the symbols used for the operations by playing around with a calculator. She <br/>
asked for a calculator of her own when she was five or thereabouts, so I gave <br/>
her one. She would sit and mess around with it for long stretches of time, <br/>
over a period of many months. Eventually she started showing me stuff. One of the <br/>
things she had discovered was the concept of multiplication. She showed me <br/>
how if she pushed the * button in between two numbers, she got the same result <br/>
as if she had added the first number to itself as many times as her second <br/>
number. (I wish I had written down the words she used to explain this to me, <br/>
they&#39;ve flown the coop I&#39;m afraid). She had discovered patterns from repeated <br/>
adding of numbers. (for instance, that multiples of 5 always end in 5 or 0.) She <br/>
had figured out division. She had discovered negative numbers. She had <br/>
recognized relationships between odd and even numbers, and discovered the power of zero.<br/>
