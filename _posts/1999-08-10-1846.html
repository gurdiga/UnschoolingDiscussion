<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061375118">I have to admit, first of all, that I haven&#39;t been keeping up with the<br/>
ADD thread, so if someone has already asked/answered this question,<br/>
would someone kindly point me to an archive?<br/>
<br/>
I pulled my 16-year old daughter out of ps in May; she was experiencing<br/>
some mild depression, had experimented with marijuana, and was generally<br/>
withdrawing into another world. I think when we actually pulled out of<br/>
school, it relieved a lot of pressure for her. She went to a few<br/>
counseling sessions (happened to be with our neighbor/friend, who is an<br/>
adolescent therapist) and since May, during this deschooling period, has<br/>
really started, note I use the word &#39;started,&#39; to get her act together.<br/>
<br/>
She was &quot;diagnosed&quot; with ADHD but of the hypo variety, not hyper. She&#39;s<br/>
always had trouble focusing on anything for more than a few minutes, and<br/>
she sleeps A LOT. A complete physical exam showed no physiological<br/>
reasons for this, i.e., good blood count, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The doc has prescribed Ritalin or Aderal (sp?) (we haven&#39;t started<br/>
anything yet) and my daughter seems to really *want* to take it. She<br/>
gets frustrated at things like being at a movie, for example, and not<br/>
even being able to follow along for more than ten minutes. She said her<br/>
mind &quot;wanders.&quot; My instinct tells me that once we are into our<br/>
unschooling/homeschooling, her symptoms may disappear; however, if she<br/>
feels that strongly about needing something, maybe I need to go ahead<br/>
and just do it. My question is this: Is Ritalin/Aderal easy to<br/>
&quot;discontinue&quot; once someone has been on it? What do I need to know about<br/>
all of this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

I don&#39;t know much about Ritalin except as a registered nurse I have to sign<br/>
it out from the narcotic cupboard because it is a controlled substance (in<br/>
Canada).  It is used to treat some adult depression which is the context in<br/>
which I administer it.  I know it is wildly over prescribed for children and<br/>
I would hope you would lobby your daughter to have a trial period of say 3<br/>
months, in which she would get a lot of attention from her family, no school<br/>
and perhaps read the Teenage Liberation Handbook by Grace Llewelyn.  Then if<br/>
she is still completely miserable consider medication.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Denise, I have been on Ritalin, and am waiting to get back on it, I did very<br/>
well, I also slept alot mostly during the day, and am add but not hyper, I<br/>
have been  off the ritalin, and had no trouble in doing so, I did not crave<br/>
it, withdrawl from it or anything of that sort, I just know that it helps me<br/>
to focus and stay awake so I am anxious to get back on it again,<br/>
I hope this helped you, sorry it was so delayed, I have been gone from my<br/>
computer for about 2 weeks or more and have 800 messages to wade thru!!!!<br/>
