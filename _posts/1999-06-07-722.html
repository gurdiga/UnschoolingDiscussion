&lt;&lt; Got the <br/>
 tadpoles (2) , they started turning into frogs (actually came out of the <br/>
 water) then they died. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good grief!  We haven&#39;t gone the old tadpole route yet, guess we will have to <br/>
get some and see if we can NOT kill them!  I bought the guys an ant farm, <br/>
about 3 years ago, never got around to sending for the ants.  Probably a <br/>
lucky thing for the ants!  Oh well guess we will keep on trying!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827767132">Well I&#39;m going out tomorrow with the kids and I wanted to pick up either<br/>
a butterfly habitat or frog habitat for them. Now after the stories I&#39;m<br/>
not so sure I should get either one!  I&#39;m not good with plants at all<br/>
but humans and animals I can grow. We do have a venus flytrap that is<br/>
thriving which I thought for sure I&#39;d kill. Yesterday my husband brought<br/>
home a gardening kit for tomatoes for the two little ones. It has a<br/>
little greenhouse. My son and daughter each got 3 pots and each one<br/>
planted a different type of tomato seed. I&#39;m trying to stay away from<br/>
them!<br/>
I think maybe tomorrow I&#39;ll go with the butterfly kit. My oldest<br/>
daughter did one in 1st or 2nd grade and loved it.<br/>
Wish me luck!<br/>

Oh wow!  I forgot about those plants!  We did those tomato plants last year.  <br/>
They did so great!  We had lovely tomatoes, but not many cause we started to <br/>
late.  The guys loved it.  They wanted to do a big garden but we plan to move <br/>
soon, so I don&#39;t want to get it started and then have to leave it.  But, I <br/>
didn&#39;t have problems with the plants, they are out there just growing away.  <br/>
Although I did think I would loose them when we had the bad dry spell.  It <br/>
was the poor pillars I killed!  Lord help any critters I run across, and I <br/>
was soooooooo  careful!!  <br/>
Good luck to you!<br/>

I didn&#39;t use a kit, so I don&#39;t know.  I went to a nursery and got the plants, <br/>
we made a butterfly garden and went from there.  The boys got a kick out of <br/>
picking the place and digging the garden.  I am sure some of the others can <br/>
tell you about the kit. But this is how we did it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466457793">It&#39;s called the Butterfly Garden.  It comes with a coupon to send away for the caterpillars which come with their own food source.  You just have to transfer them to the butterfly house when they are ready.  We found ours at the local independent toy store, but I&#39;ve also seen them in lots of catalogs.  One resource that is really great and packed with science/nature stuff is called Acorn Naturalists.  Acorn Naturalists also has a print catalog.  You can find them at www.acornnaturalists.com. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The thing with these kits is that you get frogs that are generally foreign to <br/>
your area.  One kit sends EITHER a frog that stays underwater forever <br/>
(African Albino) OR another kind of African that actually is a land frog.  <br/>
Most likely, these will not survive if let loose in the wild, as it is not <br/>
their natural habitat...<br/>

&lt;&lt; Whew, I thought I was the only murderer...  =:~0 &gt;&gt;<br/>
ROFLMAO!!! no, it seems we have a pretty good membership in this particular <br/>
club!  Man, it makes me wonder what is wrong with me.  I read all these sites <br/>
and moms talk about how neat this is and how easy and what a great <br/>
experience, how wonderfully their kids write journals, books, voluntarily go <br/>
to their rooms and read for hours on end.  Geesh, I must be a dud, I kill <br/>
pillars and the only thing my guys volunteer for is playstation, gameboy or <br/>
(thank God) to practice their instruments, sometimes!!  <br/>

&lt;&lt; The thing with these kits is that you get frogs that are generally foreign <br/>
to <br/>
 your area.  One kit sends EITHER a frog that stays underwater forever <br/>
 (African Albino) OR another kind of African that actually is a land frog.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

How neat, I didn&#39;t know that, do the kits tell you what you are getting and <br/>
the background?  I was just planning to go out back and let the guys catch <br/>
the tadpoles, but this sounds neat.  I know you already said where to get the <br/>
kit, but I didn&#39;t get it.  Could you please send it again?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&lt;&lt; got the bush, got the rocks, what the heck is a butterfly house?  LoL. I <br/>
 never heard of that, clue me in, please! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, you can buy them commercially.  Little things that you can attach to <br/>
trees.  I&#39;ve seen build your own type plans too.   I actually have a lot that <br/>
I could build one on.  It&#39;s five foot logs and they lay criss crossing each <br/>
other before the final layer of logs was put on I put heavy plastic over the <br/>
bottom logs.  Butterflies go into the crevices and roost at night.  When the <br/>
sun comes up and the dew dries up they head out of there.  It is across the <br/>
yard from the flowers they like so we have butterflies flitting past the <br/>
windows in the day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The kits tell you that when you send for the frogs, you will get either A) or <br/>
B) and what variety.  It depends upon where you live, shipping regulations, <br/>
etc...  When the actuall tadpoles come, the complete care instructions are <br/>
there...<br/>
<br/>
We have found these in Specialty Toy Stores, once in a while - TOYS R US will <br/>
have them...  and almost any homeschool catalogue...<br/>
