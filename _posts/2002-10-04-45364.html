<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009834427">I know, I&#39;m not ready for Christmas yet, either.  But I&#39;m trying to find the<br/>
words to a carol, and I can&#39;t get google to help me on this one.  Does<br/>
anybody know the rest of this song?  Please send me the words or a website<br/>
to track them down if you do.  My son wants to sing it in the theatre&#39;s<br/>
Christmas show but he needs to know all the words for the audition.<br/>
<br/>
Sing Noel, noel, ye good people gathered here.<br/>
<br/>
the tune goes d-a-b-g-a--f--g-g,a,f-e-d.<br/>
<br/>
The same tune goes with the Easter hymn &quot;When the green blade riseth&quot; if<br/>
that helps anyone....<br/>
<br/>
thanks!  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know either one of them which makes me thing maybe they&#39;re recent <br/>
compositions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d call a music director at a church where you know they use the one Easter <br/>
thing and then ask about the other text.<br/>
