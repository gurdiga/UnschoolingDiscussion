<div id="ygrps-yiv-198383153">According to a concensus of the participants in the alt.home.repair<br/>
newsgroup, the bird is being territorial with its reflection during the<br/>
mating season. Hang a bedsheet or something in front of the door.<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Batty bird<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our homeschool theater group is right in the middle of six performances of<br/>
The Wizard of Oz, so I barely have time to breath right now. I allow myself<br/>
a few minutes to check e-mail in the morning and I&#39;ve notice a thread re.<br/>
wild animals. <br/>
<br/>
The last couple of days we&#39;ve have a crazy robin trying to get into the<br/>
house. I know that birds will sometimes see trees or sky reflected in glass<br/>
and try to fly into it, but this bird is relentless in it&#39;s quest: it<br/>
perches on a chair and flies right at the window, falls to the deck, gets<br/>
back onto the chair and does it again...and again...and again. We tried<br/>
putting a drawing of a ferocious face on the window, then we put strips of<br/>
newspaper that flutter in the breeze, but still this kamakazee bird keeps<br/>
on. Our three cats sit inside, mesmerized, in full view. The bird also did<br/>
the same thing a couple of days ago next door.<br/>
<br/>
Any wildlife experts have any ideas?<br/>
