<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892257576">we were in Fort Worth, TX for a stock show.  We were unloading stuff into<br/>
the barn and the kids were settling the animals into pens.  I noticed an<br/>
elderly couple watching the kids.  (Lots and lots of people stop to talk and<br/>
ask questions at stock shows so I didn&#39;t think anything about it.)  I went<br/>
out for another load and when I came back in, these people were praying over<br/>
my kids!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Adriane and Zach are fairly polite kids so they didn&#39;t say anything, just<br/>
kind of stood there.  When I walked up, this little old lady says to me &quot;The<br/>
kids just made a decision for Jesus.&quot;  I about puked.  I informed her the<br/>
kids had been baptized for many years and sent her on her way.  The kids<br/>
thought it was silly and I was furious.<br/>
<br/>
It did give us a chance to talk about how we see God and none of us thought<br/>
he could be sold door to door like a vacuum.<br/>
