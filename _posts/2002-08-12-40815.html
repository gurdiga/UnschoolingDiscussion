&gt;Headline:  Firms make room for maternal act<br/>
&gt;Byline:  Kathryn Tyler Special to The Christian Science Monitor<br/>
&gt;Date: 08/05/2002<br/>
<br/>
&gt;This month, Emily Resa will return from maternity leave to her job as a<br/>
&gt;product engineer for DaimlerChrysler in Detroit. She is among the 2.2<br/>
&gt;million women with infants under age 1 now in the US labor force - a<br/>
&gt;record high.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But unlike many mothers who work outside the home, she won&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt;give up breast-feeding her new daughter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;DaimlerChrysler is one of the growing number of employers who have<br/>
&gt;workplace lactation policies and nursing-mothers&#39; rooms.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;It&#39;s great that they have a room,&quot; says Ms. Resa. Otherwise, &quot;where<br/>
&gt;would you pump? I wouldn&#39;t like pumping in the bathroom.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In fact, that&#39;s where many working mothers go to express their baby&#39;s<br/>
&gt;milk, a move that can be unsanitary, as well as uncomfortable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;A lot of women don&#39;t have their own offices. Many have cubicles and<br/>
&gt;there&#39;s not a lot of privacy. Most women wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable<br/>
&gt;pumping in a cubicle,&quot; says Kim Cavaliero, spokeswoman for La Leche<br/>
&gt;League International, a nonprofit breast-feeding support group based in<br/>
&gt;Schaumburg, Ill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Perhaps that explains why 68 percent of women breast-feed their infants<br/>
&gt;after birth, but only 31 percent breast-feed after six months, despite<br/>
&gt;the American Academy of Pediatrics&#39; recommendation that infants be<br/>
&gt;breast-fed for at least a year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Woman face social ostracism, people not understanding that<br/>
&gt;breast-feeding is a health choice,&quot; says Elizabeth Baldwin, an attorney<br/>
&gt;who specializes in breast-feeding and the law, in North Miami Beach,<br/>
&gt;Fla. &quot;Sometimes they find themselves having to choose their job over<br/>
&gt;breast-feeding.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Finding a private place to pump is only one of the many challenges that<br/>
&gt;new mothers face when they return to work. They also may be forced to<br/>
&gt;confront misinformed co-workers whose reactions vary from indifference<br/>
&gt;to harassment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Our society sexualizes women&#39;s breasts,&quot; says Ms. Cavaliero, so it<br/>
&gt;makes some people uncomfortable, even when the woman isn&#39;t pumping in<br/>
&gt;front of them. &quot;Most women breast-feed in a very discreet manner.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If a co-worker makes a derogatory comment about pumping, Cavaliero<br/>
&gt;suggests, &quot;Say &#39;I&#39;m pumping for my child&#39;s nutrition.&#39; Try to educate<br/>
&gt;the person. If the person is going to be ignorant and rude, and<br/>
&gt;education doesn&#39;t work, talk to the supervisor.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Corner-office concerns<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For some women, it is the supervisor who is not supportive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Part of that disapproval may stem from concerns about how long it will<br/>
&gt;take for an employee to pump. Representatives at companies with<br/>
&gt;lactation programs say some supervisors worry that the employee will be<br/>
&gt;gone for an hour at a time. But, experts say, that&#39;s inaccurate. &quot;Most<br/>
&gt;women take two 15-minute breaks plus lunch to pump,&quot; says Baldwin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Even so, it is sometimes difficult to find time away from the job to<br/>
&gt;pump. Factory workers find it next to impossible to take unscheduled<br/>
&gt;breaks, while white-collar workers struggle with other time conflicts,<br/>
&gt;such as meetings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If a meeting is scheduled during the time an employee would normally be<br/>
&gt;expressing milk, she faces a dilemma: miss the meeting or disrupt her<br/>
&gt;baby&#39;s milk supply. If a woman doesn&#39;t express milk regularly, her milk<br/>
&gt;supply decreases and, eventually, dries up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In June, Sharon Cebulski, a fifth-grade teacher at Glengary Elementary<br/>
&gt;School in Commerce Township, Mich., gave birth to her second child. She<br/>
&gt;is worried about how she will continue to breast-feed once the school<br/>
&gt;year begins again in September.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;With my first baby, when I went back to work, he got formula in the<br/>
&gt;daytime [because it was difficult to pump breast milk at work]. But I<br/>
&gt;was still able to breast-feed him when I came home from work and at<br/>
&gt;night,&quot; says Ms. Cebulski. &quot;But with this baby, I don&#39;t know. In<br/>
&gt;October, I am supposed to go to an overnight camp with my students for<br/>
&gt;a week. I don&#39;t know how I am going to continue breast-feeding.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Making &#39;reasonable efforts&#39;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Legislation in six states, including Minnesota and California, already<br/>
&gt;require employers to make reasonable efforts to provide unpaid break<br/>
&gt;time and a room where employees can express milk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D) of New York has introduced a bill which would<br/>
&gt;clarify the Pregnancy Act of 1978 to protect a woman&#39;s right to<br/>
&gt;breast-feed or express milk during the workday, but it is still being<br/>
&gt;reviewed in a House subcommittee.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Still, only 16 percent of employers provide &quot;lactation rooms,&quot;<br/>
&gt;according to a 2001 benefits survey by the Society for Human Resource<br/>
&gt;Management.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Breast-feeding advocates say businesses cannot afford not to offer help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;What some companies don&#39;t realize is that setting up a lactation room<br/>
&gt;is really good for business,&quot; says Cavaliero. &quot;Mothers and babies are<br/>
&gt;healthier, that saves on insurance and [means] fewer absent days for<br/>
&gt;the mom. More mothers return to work after having their baby, so the<br/>
&gt;company doesn&#39;t have to recruit and train new employees.&quot;<br/>
