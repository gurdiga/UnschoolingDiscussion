&lt;&lt;   For example, they know they can draw color to their hearts <br/>
 content but don&#39;t waste paper.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But what you consider a waste of paper might be creativity at it&#39;s finest!!  <br/>
I&#39;m not berating you in the least, I am also downright coercive if it comes <br/>
to permanent messes or damaging property. But my kids are reasonable people <br/>
for the most part and understand when I explain why I don&#39;t want ______ <br/>
broken or stained.<br/>
But paper?<br/>
I buy reams of it and I don&#39;t say anything about how much they use. I have <br/>
some very artistic kids and I think it&#39;s due to giving them access to <br/>
materials and not hording any of it.<br/>
I buy typing paper in large bundles, it&#39;s cheap and they can draw to their <br/>
hearts content.<br/>
I keep the expensive artist quality paper put away and they ask me for a <br/>
piece of that, but I never, ever suggest it&#39;s wasted if they throw a drawing <br/>
away.<br/>
I just give them another piece. They&#39;re aware that it costs more and try to <br/>
be careful. But I wouldn&#39;t want to limit art supplies. That&#39;s just me though, <br/>
and I do care about the environment....really.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791027517">I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong in this type of situation with telling<br/>
your kids that (1) you&#39;re angry about the mess and the wasted food, (2)<br/>
you&#39;re disappointed that because of their actions, no one will have<br/>
blueberries to eat, and (3) you expected better of them while you were out<br/>
of the room.  A 3 year old may be young to make the right decision here, but<br/>
surely an 8 year old could help.  I can&#39;t imagine that you were in the<br/>
shower for THAT long!)<br/>
<br/>
Messes at my house are generally cleaned by the mess maker.  To me, that&#39;s a<br/>
fair consequence.  It discourages mess for the sake of making mess.  We all<br/>
pitch in and help after big projects or accidents, though.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; has some sort of moldy, rotting food in a bag - stuffed under her bed or<br/>
&gt; somewhere out of sight - until we can smell it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hate to discourage creativity, but maybe limiting food consumption to<br/>
certain rooms would be worthwhile.  I&#39;d worry about bugs and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My husband thinks I am not &quot;structured&quot; and they are<br/>
&gt; learning by my example not to be neat<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s two issues here, as you describe it.  One is neatness.  And if<br/>
you&#39;re not neat, don&#39;t expect your kids to be, either.  The other is<br/>
disrespect of property.  Breaking toys, coloring on walls, mashing food.<br/>
There is a difference, but you may have to teach it to your kids.<br/>
<br/>
If it helps to know that other people yell, I&#39;m human, and sometimes I lose<br/>
it.  I do try hard to express my feelings politely.  I think it&#39;s hard to<br/>
ignore someone who looks you in the eyes and says, &quot;I&#39;m angry and<br/>
disappointed&quot;.  I trust my child to learn, but he does need guidance to<br/>
become the kind of person I (and others) can respect and enjoy.<br/>

<br/>
Eight year olds should not be expected to control three year olds.<br/>
Moms can&#39;t always do it.<br/>
Eight year olds did not decide to have children.  And it&#39;s too much <br/>
responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
My mom  used to leave me watching my sister who was only three and a half <br/>
years younger.  That was wrong.  My sister got badly hurt once because I <br/>
didn&#39;t know enough to say &quot;no&quot; about something dangerous.  And I felt like it <br/>
was my fault, and that was a really heavy burden for me to bear until I got <br/>
old enough to realize it was entirely my mom&#39;s fault (it was an accident, <br/>
but...)  and so my mom had allowed both me AND my sister harm (mine <br/>
psychological through heavy guilt for years).<br/>
<br/>
Blaming the eight year old for the blueberry stain is no good either.<br/>
<br/>
And being angry is too much.  Anger at a child whose age can still be counted <br/>
in MONTHS??<br/>
<br/>
The mom should find a way to clean the stain and serve blueberries in a bowl <br/>
with a spoon from now on, with homemade whipped cream, and sit and eat them <br/>
with the kids and say sweet things to them.   <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my best advice on this one.<br/>
