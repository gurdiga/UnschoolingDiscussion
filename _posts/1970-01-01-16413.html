<div><font face="HoratioDMed" color="#000080">Well I hope this isn&#39;t tacky but I 
joined another unschooling list and spent a lot of time on my intro so I thought 
I would paste it here.&nbsp; It seems that list isn&#39;t quite as busy as this one 
so I&#39;m hoping to find some support here as well.......</font></div>
<div>UNSCHOOLING EXPERIENCES: My first &quot;intro&quot; to homeschooling was when <br>my 
oldest was 18months old and I was pregnant with my twins.&nbsp; My Le <br>Leche 
League leader had great &quot;meetings&quot; and I noticed that most <br>everyone there 
had their school aged kids with them.&nbsp; So began my <br>education on 
education!&nbsp; The first book I read about homeschooling <br>was Homeschooling 
for Excellence by the Colfax family...boy was I <br>hooked.&nbsp; I then 
proceeded to pick brains and read anything I could <br>get my hands on.&nbsp; 
All the while I loved the idea of unschooling and <br>being free of &quot;other 
peoples&quot; ideas of the way things should be.&nbsp; <br>Well time went by and I 
did nothing structured through 1st grade with <br>my oldest.&nbsp; Then 2nd 
grade hit and I started hitting the panic <br>button.....what if they don&#39;t 
learn it all? What if I miss something? <br>What if he just watches tv all day, 
every day?? And so I started with <br>the curriculum.......first this one, then 
that one......and over the <br>past 2 years I&#39;ve gone through just about every 
popular curriculum <br>you&#39;ve heard of.......all to be abandoned because I 
&quot;realize the <br>error of my ways&quot; only to get panicky again and start all 
over.&nbsp; My <br>children have been quite forgiving and don&#39;t seem to notice 
my <br>psychotic episodes much anymore except for the sudden influx of 
<br>worksheets and &quot;sit down&quot; time at the table..... ANYWAY, here I am <br>with 
my newest curriculum catch and I am once again questioning why I <br>keep 
thinking that someone else has all the answers for us....I keep <br>getting 
frustrated at doing what someone else tells me to do and I&#39;m <br>so tired of 
ignoring my kids real interests because we have to stay <br>on &quot;schedule&quot; to 
finish 3rd grade.&nbsp; I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m very <br>successful at unschooling 
but I know deep in my heart that it is my <br>greatest desire for our 
home.&nbsp; I just haven&#39;t figured out yet how to <br>stop being lazy, looking 
to experts for the answers, and how to stop <br>the panic attacks....so that is 
why I&#39;m here</div>
<div>UNSCHOOLING STRUGGLES OR OBSTACLES:&nbsp; I explained this up 
<br>above.....mostly its the doubts that in the end he won&#39;t fit in or <br>that 
I will have somehow damaged him in some way<br>UNSCHOOLING JOYS:&nbsp; I love 
that light bulb that goes on when they just <br>have time to do their own 
thing.......that interest that sparks and <br>you can see in their eyes that 
they are truly learning and not only <br>that but enjoying it!<br>WHAT YOU WANT 
OR EXPECT FROM THIS LIST:&nbsp; Support, hopefully other <br>people out there to 
say I know just what you mean.....I feel the same <br>way.....its normal....I&#39;d 
love some ideas to stay motivated and <br>unwavering.&nbsp; Ideas to make myself 
more intuned to my kids and their <br>interests....to know where to go with 
their newest schemes and how <br>far to take things and when to reel them 
back.&nbsp; In general I guess <br>I&#39;m just looking for all the answers! 
LOL!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Thanks for being 
<br>here...<br>Rachel<br><br></div></html></div>

who have been at this a long time. I know that I enjoy the list, I pick up <br/>
ideas and opinions that widen my own thoughts. Sometimes I wonder who is <br/>
learning more in this unschooling adventure, my kids or me! Talking to others <br/>
on this list is my only way to speak to other unschoolers.When the list is <br/>
quiet I miss it. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-874410543">Now that I&#39;ve jumped in and commented, I thought I&#39;d introduce myself.<br/>
We&#39;ve been homeschooling for 4 years now. I&#39;m usually lurking over on unschooling.com. But I thought I&#39;d stop in and see how things are going over here.  <br/>
I have a 16 yo son and a 13 yo daughter. We&#39;re more of eclectic homeschoolers than radical unschoolers. Mainly because we have added structure to our school schedule.  <br/>
While talking to my kids one day certain goals started emerging. My son wants to learn and work on computers. I pointed out what he probably would need to learn before heading to college or tech school. So he set himself to learn those subjects. Only he failed to complete what he wanted in his time schedule. He was feeling like a failure. Now this part may not be too unschooling, but I stepped in and told him how I could help. I would remind him to sit and do work if he came up with a schedule he wants.  <br/>
My daughter is more of an unschooler. She has also set a schedule for herself but she will push herself to keep to it.<br/>
So even though I don&#39;t concider myself an unschooler I still hang out here to learn and gather tips.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If your son *wanted* this help with organization, then he&#39;s still <br/>
unschooling if you provide it.  If he failed to complete his goals and you <br/>
stepped in and told him he had to, and this is how he had to go about it, <br/>
then he&#39;s not unschooling anymore.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Funny, there are people posting about being unschoolers that I would say <br/>
are not unschoolers.  And here you say you aren&#39;t, but what you describe <br/>
sounds like it to me.  Unschooling isn&#39;t about the absence of schedules and <br/>
structure and curriculums.  It&#39;s about choice, as someone else said.  It&#39;s <br/>
all about *who* makes the learning decisions.  It sounds like in your <br/>
family, it&#39;s the kids who make the decisions, and you&#39;re the one who helps <br/>
them carry them out.  That&#39;s what John Holt called unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
(And least everyone think I&#39;m holding myself up as the queen of the <br/>
unschoolers, I&#39;m not.  I *have* insisted that my son do various learning <br/>
activities over the years.  And every time I&#39;ve done that, I&#39;ve realized <br/>
later that it was not a good idea, that there were repercussions in his <br/>
learning and our relationship.)<br/>

<br/>
Yes and no. Michael has a quirk about him that doesn&#39;t translate well. I understand when someone says their kid needs structure, because Michael definately does better in a more structured environment. Unfortunately for him, his mom is highly disorganised :o)<br/>
It did seem that his giving me permission to remind him and help him keep on schedule was a pass to push him on all kinds of other things. From what time to get up to taking out the trash. Last year I even assigned him work in Language Arts. Acckkk!  Not one of the chosen subjects. ( only for about a month before I wisened up) And the guilt because I might have jumped in too soon to help and not let him continue to work out his schedule. But Michael might not have made that jump on his own.  <br/>
Kenna asked when we were going back to school last week. I replied &quot;When do you want?&quot; She chose to start back when the middle schooler&#39;s start back. See that&#39;s why I think we don&#39;t really qualify as unschoolers because I didn&#39;t suggest that we don&#39;t go back to school. They get to decide which books to use and if they don&#39;t like one we quit using it, but this year if they said &#39;NO&#39; would I let them go back to no schedule?  <br/>
Michael and are headed to TVI (jr college) to sign up for a few computer classes on Tuesday. Will I be able to let him drop out if he doesn&#39;t like it? Hmmm, if he wants to drop out because he can&#39;t handle it because of his disability, then probably I would. But if he wants to drop out because it&#39;s too hard, or requires more time in homework that takes time away from playing on the computer, I&#39;m not sure. Inability or laziness.<br/>
This summer has been great. My relaxation level is higher than ever. Kenna made up her own written language, in code. She&#39;s done several music videos with her friends and coreagraphed (sp) most of the steps. Michael has spent hours watching the History channel and conversing with friends online. I shooed him off the computer at 6 am this morning.  <br/>
Mainly I&#39;m comfortable with where we are.  I fully believe in unschooling.  <br/>
Most days I feel I&#39;m deschooling myself, unschooling Kenna and homeschooling Michael.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314299479">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Ellen and have been unschooling for 6.5 years now since we took our son <br/>
out of school in the middle of first grade.  Well, we did try school-at-home <br/>
for about 6 weeks or so... It was miserable! I read some unschooling books <br/>
(by Holt) and magazines (GWS) and talked to unschoolers and it began to sink <br/>
in little by little. <br/>
<br/>
My kids are boys ages 13 and 10 and a dd age 4.5 yrs.  We just moved to TX <br/>
but are from MA (me) and ME (dh).  So TX is very different and hot!   But a <br/>
good place to homeschool - no reporting!  We are Christians which is <br/>
interesting as most Christian hsers I know just don&#39;t get unschooling &lt;g&gt;.  <br/>
Sometimes I just avoid the &quot;u&quot; word and say we are &#39;really relaxed&#39;.  <br/>
<br/>
(Joyce, I wish we had met in MA!  I was in the Homeschooling To<br/>
gether/Arlington and MVHL/Billerica groups.  I think you were further west.  <br/>
I&#39;ve always enjoyed reading your articles online and in HEM.)   <br/>
<br/>
Great list!  I&#39;m always encouraged and stretched reading here!<br/>

<br/>
No, I was in the Billerica group! We lived in Billerica until 1998. Though<br/>
we didn&#39;t attend events much that last year because Kathryn didn&#39;t really<br/>
click with any of the kids. You probably had the opportunity to see me. I<br/>
was the reeeeal quiet one in the corner no one noticed. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The name Ellen sounds familiar but I&#39;m not getting a clear impression and<br/>
she may have been a different Ellen entirely. What are your boys names?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to remember some events we attended ... Kathryn was a winged<br/>
unicorn one year and the Magic School Bus another at the Halloween parties.<br/>
I had a Christmas gift or Mother&#39;s Day gift station set up with little disks<br/>
of plaster the kids scratched/carved with a needle and hung on a string as a<br/>
necklace. And we were at a cool math event. I had something that was really<br/>
popular but I can&#39;t remember what it was! (Maybe it was gum drops and<br/>
toothpicks? But whatever it was I can&#39;t take credit for it since I just set<br/>
up what the woman who put the even together gave me to do.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574003107">Hello -- I&#39;m excited to find a great group...I&#39;m a SAHM soon to be a WAHM to <br/>
a 28 month old dynamo who seems to be teaching himself way too much to be for <br/>
real :) and a sweet 9 month old.<br/>
<br/>
Andrew taught himself his letters at 15 months -- I read to the boys ALL the <br/>
time and I used to read him lots of alphabet books...evidently he learned to <br/>
recognize them and shocked me one day when he started calling out letters in <br/>
things.  Since then he&#39;s also learned his colors, shapes (including polygon, <br/>
octogan and others) and numbers.  I&#39;m not sure how this happens -- whether <br/>
its shows like Sesame Street or all the reading we do..but somehow he&#39;s <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
The short reason why I&#39;m joining this list now even before he&#39;s preschool <br/>
age:  my inlaws are putting lots of pressure on getting him on a waiting list <br/>
for the &quot;right&#39; kind of preschool.  We told them when he was born we were <br/>
going to homeschool him (we hadn&#39;t learned about unschooling then -- and I <br/>
don&#39;t think they need to know about that for a long time.)  But they seem to <br/>
think the whole reason for homeschool is because we can&#39;t afford private <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading the Unschooling Handbook and I love it.  It has revitalized <br/>
what I used to do with Andrew before Eli was born.  I&#39;ve always given Andrew <br/>
info about the world if he was interested...for example, when we go grocery <br/>
shopping we talk about the different veggies...even when he was a baby I&#39;d <br/>
talk about them.  But when I had the baby I kind of got sidetracked into day <br/>
to day things without really involving them in whatever we were doing.  So I <br/>
think the Unschooling Handbook is handy even from infancy.  Its helped remind <br/>
me that my children don&#39;t start learning magically at age 5 and don&#39;t need to <br/>
learn certain things in a certain order.  We can find things we are <br/>
interested in and learn as much or as little about them as we want.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I&#39;m kind of unschooling myself...I was a kitchen/bath designer <br/>
before kids and I&#39;ve wanted to do interior design with the kitchen/bath <br/>
designing as a home based business.  I&#39;ve toyed with the idea of going back <br/>
to school and getting an interior design degree. But as I will be certified <br/>
in kitchen/bath design next year I decided to develop my own college level <br/>
home course.  I&#39;ve printed up the course description of what our local <br/>
college requires for their 3 and 4 yr degrees in design and I&#39;m learning <br/>
about that subject.  For example, a 3 credit class is &quot;The History of <br/>
Fabric.&quot;  So I can go to the library; check out books on that subject and <br/>
read to my heart&#39;s content.<br/>
<br/>
Do you all think that sounds like a crazy idea????<br/>
