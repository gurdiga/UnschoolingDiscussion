<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054581017">Hi All.  My name is Linda and I&#39;ve only posted once so far.  I have an issue I could use some feed back on.  My oldest, Logan, is eight right now,we pulled him out of public school at the beginning of last year.  He had already been labeled  &quot;learning disabled with possible attention issues&quot;.  I had tried the &quot;school at home&quot; and we were both miserable.  That&#39;s when I found John Holt&#39;s books.  Absolutely amazing man, wish I could have met him!  So now we try to follow the unschooling philosophy ,although I&#39;m still new and probably screw up a lot!  Anyway here&#39;s the thing, Logan is still having tons of trouble with writing and small motor skills are really tough for him(like cutting, spreading peanut butter, etc...)  He reverses all the letters, often having them facing different directions on the same page and writing is very hard for him.  His writing is also very hard to read,even for him.  He&#39;s a good reader (reads young adult books) but, avoids books with small print like the<br/>
 plague.  I DO NOT make a big deal out out of this, I don&#39;t even mention it, but he does.  It does frustrate him that these things seem to come so easy to his six year old brother and he has to struggle so hard.  We did find out that his eyes don&#39;t track well together and he has some vision problems.   His vision is 20/20,it&#39;s more the way his eyes work together with his brain, I guess. We have another appt. next week so I should learn more then.  I found a great website on this HTTP://www.pavevision.org .  He also is very impulsive or&quot;clumsy&quot; as he calls it.  The other day he flung a door open on our truck right into another car so we&#39;ll be paying for that.(I know this was just an accident but this is just a good example of the type of things he does.  He saw the car and then just flung the door open without considering the distance at all)  Walks on things, into things, you get the idea. He ask me the other day why he was so &quot;clumsy&quot; (we don&#39;t tell him this, I don&#39;t know  where he<br/>
 got it).  We just try to tell him to pay more attention to what he&#39;s doing.  It&#39;s kind of like he has no spacial perception, which is one of the things they had said at the school too.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, he is a great kid.  He is very smart, gets very involved in whatever his interest at the time may be.  The school he was at also suggested that he was also gifted(another label!)  in science and social studies, he had scored way above grade level.  He&#39;s extremely lovable,still loves to cuddle!  In some ways, when you talk to him, he comes across older then he is.  He likes older kids to hang out with usually, although thankfully with home schooling this isn&#39;t a big deal anymore.  But impulse control can be really hard for him and sometimes this leads to problems with other kids.  We just let him be himself and focus on the things he does well.

 </span></blockquote>  As someone who got told this all the time I&#39;ll just let you know it&#39;s no help at all, extremely frustrating because I simply didn&#39;t know how. What did the people telling me this mean? Look harder at what I was supposed to be paying attention to? Just move slower? <br/>
  There&#39;s no moment between the thought and the action to stop and pay attention. It&#39;s like telling a kid who&#39;s walking from one pasture to the next to mind the fence, meanwhile the child can&#39;t see the fence and doesn&#39;t even know it&#39;s there. I&#39;m not sure what to do about it but I&#39;d suggest you maybe do some reading on ADHD and such, NOT because your son might have it but simply because some books have some good advice for helping a person with impulse control problems.  I know I&#39;ve managed to work out a lot of issues regarding impulse control but for a very long time it meant a LOT of work to stop when impulse struck, a constant internal dialogue that I would not do whatever I was about to do (lots of focus needed there, a distraction would mean all that dialogue was forgotten). Most importantly and probably hardest was learning to recognize those impulses in the first place. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652065540">Hi<br/>
You can talk to an optomitrist (sp) not just the guy you get your <br/>
glasses from, but an eye doctor. They can give him exercises to help <br/>
with the muscles in his eyes if it is needed. If he does have eye <br/>
problems, it could effect his perception.<br/>
<br/>
Or it may just be part of his personality.<br/>
My mom use to say I was like a bull in a china shop. lOl I still am <br/>
and so im dd12. We  laugh about it. If someone (usually me) walks <br/>
into a wall, stop sign, or...mmm...a TREE, someone will make a smarty <br/>
pants comment (it is how we joke here)  She did almost hit a car <br/>
once. A brand new JAG!!! Her dad about had a heart attack. LOL We <br/>
simply asked her not to open the door without someone there and <br/>
explained why. She agreed.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about the writing, cutting and such he will pick it up <br/>
when  it is right for him. If he is getting upset, reassure him. Have <br/>
a &quot;crafty box available you can get those cool scissors that cut <br/>
shaps (zig-zags, waves ect.), they are inexpensive. If he wants to <br/>
read books with little print, you can get him a magnifying glass. <br/>
They have a  big one you wear around your neck. It has a base that <br/>
you prop in your chest so all you have to do is look down. We got one <br/>
for my grandma because she can&#39;t see as well anymore. <br/>
Just wondering, is he a lefty or a righty? If he is a lefty and you <br/>
are not, it can be very difficult for him to pick up on things with <br/>
you showin him.<br/>

<br/>
You may want to check out some websites on Non-Verbal Leaning Disorders.  A<br/>
few of the main &quot;symptoms&quot; are poor spatial relations, difficulty tracking<br/>
when reading or doing worksheets, etc, impulsivity and poor muscle control,<br/>
both large and small (clumsiness and difficulty writing).  To have him<br/>
evaluated and labeled (or not) is your choice, but reading about it may help<br/>
you understand his particular learning style.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read any of Mel Levine&#39;s books?  Warning--They are not<br/>
unschool-friendly!  He talks mostly about how to help kids perform well in<br/>
school, but he also talks a great deal about how people learn and how kids<br/>
with learning differences can be helped to make learning easier.  I would<br/>
suggest &quot;A Mind at a Time&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This may not go over well on an unschooling list, but for those of us who<br/>
struggle right along with a struggling child it&#39;s helpful to try to<br/>
understand what&#39;s going on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>

 My son, at 8, had all of the same things going on with him.  He couldn&#39;t<br/>
read at all, his writing was huge letters that looked like he had been in<br/>
pain writing, he was extremely impulsive.<br/>
<br/>
At 10, he reads fairly well but isn&#39;t interested in books much, his writing<br/>
is much, much, much more comfortable for him, he occassionally slows down to<br/>
think before making a decision. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

Find him things to do that don&#39;t require that right now.  Make his sandwiches <br/>
for him.  Let him pick a new pair of scissors if maybe the ones he has are <br/>
too big, or too cheap, or something.   Maybe he&#39;d like lefty scissors.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He reverses all the letters, often having them facing different directions <br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t ask him to write.  He&#39;s not ready.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It does frustrate him that these things seem to come so easy to his six <br/>
year old brother and he has to struggle so hard. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Remind him (in private) of things he does well that his brother doesn&#39;t. <br/>
Remind his brother in private NOT to razz him or brag, but to just be patient <br/>
and his older brother will be able to do it too.<br/>
<br/>
-=- We did find out that his eyes don&#39;t track well together and he has some <br/>
vision problems.   His vision is 20/20,it&#39;s more the way his eyes work together <br/>
with his brain, I guess. We have another appt. next week so I should learn <br/>
more then.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
I woudn&#39;t go.  I&#39;d cancel it.  Honestly.  However his eyes work with his <br/>
brain, he&#39;ll figure things out if you stop trying to &quot;keep him on track&quot; with <br/>
other people.  He&#39;s on his own track.  You just need to maintain that track, and <br/>
give him lots of things to see, hear, taste, think about...<br/>
<br/>

&quot;Disposable Checklists for Unschoolers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would cancel that appointment.  You&#39;ll be paying money for someone to scare <br/>
you and tell him he&#39;s not okay.  He IS okay, for him.  Let him start being <br/>
his own whole self instead of being a person who is defined by what he is not.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He also is very impulsive or&quot;clumsy&quot; as he calls it.  The other day he <br/>
flung a door open on our truck right into another car so we&#39;ll be paying for <br/>
that.-=-<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s eight years old.  Who parked so close to another car?  I&#39;d blame the <br/>
driver not the kid.  You could have opened the door for him if you knew it was <br/>
too close.  I think everyone has flung a door open and hit another car in a <br/>
parking lot.  Haven&#39;t you?  <br/>
<br/>
-=-  We just try to tell him to pay more attention to what he&#39;s doing. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I would stop doing that too.  Every time you say &quot;pay attention&quot; you&#39;re <br/>
telling him there&#39;s something wrong with him, and he will stop listening to you.  <br/>
Anything you say over 50 times becomes part of the wallpaper.  You become the <br/>
mom who cried wolf.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Don&#39;t get me wrong, he is a great kid. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not getting you wrong.  I&#39;m reading every word.  And that&#39;s even without <br/>
sighing and tone of voice.  Your son isn&#39;t getting you wrong either.  You <br/>
think he&#39;s got some serious lacks and flaws.  You&#39;re taking him to a professional <br/>
to confirm your concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, he is a great kid. You can step away from that path if <br/>
you want to.  It will help your son immensely if you do.  And when he is calmer, <br/>
you&#39;ll be happier.   The longer you wait the harder it will be.  If you wait <br/>
too long, it will be too far gone to fix.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The school he was at also suggested that he was also gifted(another <br/>
label!)  in science and social studies, he had scored way above grade level. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Pack those things into one corner of your mind and close it off.  You&#39;re <br/>
wasting too much thinking in bad directions.   You see him through the lens of <br/>
what others have said and what others have feared and warned and hinted.   Get <br/>
all that noise and label-clutter out of your line of thought and sight.  Learn <br/>
to see him directly without ANY filter.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s simple, but not easy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We just let him be himself and focus on the things he does well.  This has <br/>
helped his self-esteem enormously but sometimes I wonder if I should be doing <br/>
more!  -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think you should be doing less, and I think your first statement there is <br/>
belied by most of the rest of your post.  You are NOT &quot;just letting him be <br/>
himself.&quot;  Not in peace.  Not without concerns and negative judgment.<br/>
<br/>
-=-From what I&#39;ve read it seems like it can but if this is dyslexia or <br/>
dysgraphia should we be getting him more help? -=-<br/>
<br/>
No.  That help is part and parcel of the assembly-line that is public <br/>
education.<br/>
<br/>
Step away from the assembly line, and its technicians and consultants and <br/>
managers and advisor and theoreticians.  Turn your back and walk away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922930952">I suspect my 8yod would have been diagnosed dyslexic if she went to school.<br/>
Thankfully, she doesn&#39;t go to school.  I don&#39;t doubt that she &#39;sees&#39; things<br/>
differently than I do.<br/>
<br/>
She has a way with drawings and sculpture that is very appealing.  When I<br/>
read aloud to her, she either looks at the pictures or busies herself<br/>
playing while listening.  In the past week, she has begun to read some new<br/>
words on signs and other places.  I&#39;ve tried very hard to assure her that<br/>
reading will come easily to her when she is ready and that those who<br/>
pressure her about reading are brainwashed by the idea that everyone should<br/>
know how to read by age 6.  I tell her about unschooling kids I&#39;ve read<br/>
about who don&#39;t learn to read until 10 or 12 or later, and how once a person<br/>
knows how to read, it doesn&#39;t matter how old they were when they learned.<br/>
Although she sometimes get frustrated that she can&#39;t yet read, she is<br/>
usually too busy doing other things to worry about it.  Author/Illustrator<br/>
Patricia Pollacio didn&#39;t read until she was 10.  One of her books tells her<br/>
story.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.patriciapolacco.com/">http://www.patriciapolacco.com/</a>  &quot;Thank You, Mr. Falker&quot;<br/>

from another education professional if you want, but probably what makes it <br/>
useful is that I&#39;m mom to an unschooled eight-year-old boy who your description <br/>
fits  --<br/>
<br/>
       A brain that runs ahead of his body, loves to read, and compose <br/>
stories, yet struggles with mechanically forming the letters on paper. Even at 8, he <br/>
isn&#39;t interested in riding a bicycle or rollerblading, it seems because he&#39;s <br/>
not comfortable relying on his balance and sense of himself in physical space. <br/>
He&#39;s recently decided &quot;to be a dancer&quot; and is taking classes; it&#39;s clear to <br/>
see that he moves with less control (but more enthusiasm!) than the younger, <br/>
smaller, mainly female dancers in his beginning group.<br/>
<br/>
       The difference is this: it honestly never occurred to me that he has a <br/>
learning problem or disability. He is a wonderful learner and often seems to <br/>
be developing in ten directions at once. His dance teacher did suggest he <br/>
should spend more time at the playground, swinging on bars and such, because she <br/>
thought he might be too cerebral and inclined to stay indoors. I smiled and <br/>
said he we&#39;d go whenever he wanted, which is exactly how long the dance classes <br/>
would continue, no more and no less. :)  JJ<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-39715790">A book I found helpful was The Out of Sync Child, Carol Stock Kranowitz.  Not so much to find a label for your child, but it gave me some insight to how differently some of us are wired, and some ideas for how to accommodate those differences so the missing aspects can be caught up.<br/>
<br/>
Andy is great at riding a bike but still bumps into things, has trouble pouring without spilling, and sometimes has no concept of personal physical space.  He&#39;s the kind of kid who will tackle you for a hug, but can&#39;t tolerate being kissed.  I was the most uncoordinated child I knew, and it kept me from doing all kinds of things I would have loved to try.  I wish someone had recognized that I wasn&#39;t wired like my very agile younger brother & sister.  It&#39;s not about being wrong or deficient in some way, just figuring out what your child needs and making it available to him so he can grow in his own way.<br/>

 There&#39;s no moment between the thought and the action to stop and pay attention. It&#39;s like telling a kid who&#39;s walking from one pasture to the next to mind the fence, meanwhile the child can&#39;t see the fence and doesn&#39;t even know it&#39;s there. I&#39;m not sure what to do about it but I&#39;d suggest you maybe do some reading on ADHD and such,<br/>

      &gt;20/20,it&#39;s more the way his eyes work together with his brain, I guess. We have<br/>
      &gt;another appt. next week so I should learn more then. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>      Hi Linda, and welcome to the list. My son will be 8 this summer and we&#39;ve always unschooled. He sounds remarkably similar to your son, and actually is in the middle of vision therapy right now. I have to say that I *strongly* disagree with the advice to cancel the appointment with the vision therapist. If something physical on a child doesn&#39;t work the way it&#39;s supposed to (let&#39;s say, for instance, that your child&#39;s legs wouldn&#39;t coordinate so that he couldn&#39;t walk), I can&#39;t imagine thinking that it would be a good idea to just cancel any appointments with specialists and tell him it&#39;s just fine to drag himself around on his arms until things come together in his brain so that his legs work together the way they&#39;re supposed to. If a child&#39;s eyes don&#39;t work in tandem, more than just reading is at stake. Their whole visual perception of the world can be skewed. They have no depth perception, they run into walls, doors, they stub and break toes, they crash bicycles and scooters (or give up in frustration before they can&#39;t ride them). IMHO, there&#39;s no reason to let a child hobble on in a world that feels difficult and frustrating to them when something as painless and simple as vision therapy can make everything work well and easily. Vision therapists are masters at making therapy fun for the kids. Ours sends my son home with Pokemon-themed exercises and &quot;Where&#39;s Waldo&quot; books. They change his exercises up every week and he is amazed and happy at how much easier not only reading, but *all of life* is for him now that he&#39;s been doing therapy for a couple of months. Just this week, he has discovered that he can now make his hand and eye do what his brain imagines and he can draw Pokemon characters. He was actually shouting out loud &quot;Mom, I can draw a straight line! Mom, a straight line!!!&quot; Please note, I&#39;ve never asked him to draw a straight line in his life, but he really wants to draw Pokemon characters and before the vision therapy, he couldn&#39;t make his hand and eyes work together to draw what he was seeing in his head.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">       &gt;&quot;He also is very impulsive or&quot;clumsy&quot; as he<br/>
      &gt;calls it. The other day he flung a door open on our truck right into another<br/>
      &gt;car so we&#39;ll be paying for that.(I know this was just an accident but this is<br/>
      &gt;just a good example of the type of things he does. He saw the car and then just<br/>
      &gt;flung the door open without considering the distance at all) Walks on things,<br/>
      &gt;into things, you get the idea. He ask me the other day why he was so &quot;clumsy&quot;<br/>
      &gt;(we don&#39;t tell him this, I don&#39;t know where he<br/>
      &gt;got it).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>      He knows. I knew it as a kid too. I sure wish I knew then that there was a relatively easy solution for it. I&#39;ve broken so many toes and banged my head into things so many times I can&#39;t count. My parents were baffled at why I was so clumsy. It&#39;s wonderful to watch my son&#39;s body come together as the brain-vision-body connection is strengthened through therapy. He can actually run in a straight line now (he used to go semi-sideways, one reason he always ran into things or into other people), he can skip and hop (and no, for those who might be wondering, we never asked him to do those either, but he knew that other kids can do things that he can&#39;t, and he&#39;s ecstatic now that he can join in riding scooters or jumping rope).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">       &gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong, he is a great kid. He is very<br/>
      &gt;smart, gets very involved in whatever his interest at the time may be. The<br/>
      &gt;school he was at also suggested that he was also gifted(another label!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>      Well, that&#39;s the great thing about unschooling, you just don&#39;t have to worry about all those labels. It&#39;s very freeing. But still, a child can face problems, with or without a label. And helping them through challenges that confront them is part of being an unschooling parent, to me. Whether it&#39;s getting them to the library and helping them find a book or video about a subject that they&#39;re interested in, or helping them find a way to make their eyes work in a coordinated pair, I guess I just don&#39;t see it as all that different. With unschooling, they can just be who and what they are, and we can help them with what they might need help with, and not have to bother about the label that someone might come up with that might or might not fit all or part of who they are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">        &gt; He likes older kids to hang out with usually, although<br/>
      &gt;thankfully with home schooling this isn&#39;t a big deal anymore. But impulse<br/>
      &gt;control can be really hard for him and sometimes this leads to problems with<br/>
      &gt;other kids. We just let him be himself and focus on the things he does well.<br/>
      &gt;This has helped his self-esteem enormously but sometimes I wonder if I should be<br/>
      &gt;doing more! Has anyone heard of vision training helping<br/>
      &gt;these kind of things? From what I&#39;ve read it seems like it can but if this is<br/>
      &gt;dyslexia or dysgraphia should we be getting him more help? What&#39;s the<br/>
      &gt;unschooling perspective on these things? Thanks for reading.<br/>
      &gt;Linda<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>      I think every unschooler will probably have a different perspective on this. The important thing, IMHO is to find what works, really works, for you and your child. It&#39;s more important than a label, more important even than the label of &quot;unschooler&quot;. To me, to my son, to our family, vision therapy has worked well within an unschooling perspective. It&#39;s something that my son noticed, something that he asked for help with, and thankfully something that we found a great resource that was able to give him that help. Our vision therapist is actually a neighbor, a wonderful woman that our son was already comfortable with. The therapists go out of their way to find fun and engaging activities for him to do, both at the office visits and at home. We&#39;re only 10 weeks into a 30-week course of therapy, but we had a midway checkup yesterday and his vision is so vastly improved, it&#39;s amazing. Things that were blurry to him before are now clear. Things that he wanted his body to do before, he can now do. Every day almost there is something new that he discovers that he can do, and he&#39;s so excited about it, it&#39;s almost like when he was 2 years old again. Not having been in school, he didn&#39;t have to go through any comparison with his age peers, but all the same he had started noticing that there were things *he* wanted to do that he couldn&#39;t, and it wasn&#39;t getting any better. Just this week, he discovered he could read the tiny print on Pokemon cards, could draw straight lines, could ride a scooter without tipping sideways. Just leaps and bounds here.<br/>
<br/>
      I actually just finished writing an article about our experiences with deciding to pursue vision therapy and how we thought about that interacting with our family&#39;s unschooling lifestyle. Making the decision was a journey that required a lot of thought on our part - about what the implications could be, both positive and negative. So far, for our son, the decision seems to have been unilaterally positive. Since making this decision, I&#39;ve met several adults who struggled with vision issues until they got therapy as an adult. All of them said without a doubt that they&#39;d wished that they&#39;d had it available to them as children, since they&#39;ve gone through decades of seeing double, running into walls, not being able to read well, being turned down for pilot&#39;s licenses, and other issues where their vision held them back from the things that they wanted to do in life. <br/>
<br/>
      If you feel like discussing our experiences personally, feel free to email me: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:tri_mom@...">tri_mom@...</a> . It has really been such a positive thing in our son&#39;s life to have done this, and it has interfered not at all with his usual unschooling enthusiasm for life.<br/>

okay or scared him in any way. They tested his eyes, which obviously <br/>
didn&#39;t work well enough to focus or to track an object or text. He <br/>
already knew that, that&#39;s why he asked me for help. He knew things <br/>
were blurry, he knew he couldn&#39;t keep focused on things, he knew his <br/>
body was off-balance. The opthamologist just confirmed it with the <br/>
tests. In a way, it was very much a relief for our son to know he <br/>
wasn&#39;t just imagining this stuff, that his eyes really were working <br/>
quite differently. He&#39;s more than happy that they&#39;re working better <br/>
now.  When you can see the world and it doesn&#39;t look blurry or <br/>
doubled, when you can run towards your mom and not crash into her <br/>
because you thought she was 5 feet further away, when you don&#39;t <br/>
repeatedly run into the doorways in your house, that&#39;s not a <br/>
frightening thing, that&#39;s a wonderful thing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He IS okay, for him. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to wonder if you would say this to the parent of a child who <br/>
could not walk. What if there was a very simple therapy that would <br/>
let that child walk within a few months?? Would it be a good idea to <br/>
tell that child that they were just fine the way they were? <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t the child know, without anyone telling them, that there were <br/>
things that they could not do that other kids could do, that other <br/>
kids were running and jumping while they were sitting in a <br/>
wheelchair? Would that be just okay, for that child? Somehow, I don&#39;t <br/>
think so. And I think the situation is directly analagous. My son <br/>
knew that things weren&#39;t working right for him, that there were <br/>
things *he* wanted to do that he could not. Who am I to tell him that <br/>
he is just okay, for him?? That he should just live with something <br/>
that was bothering him on a daily basis that could be easily changed? <br/>
<br/>
So many of your posts Sandra are wonderful and thought-inspiring. I <br/>
do (respectfully) think though that your advice here is completely <br/>
wrong. Just my opinion, but I feel strongly about this. Having eyes <br/>
that don&#39;t work together is not the same as being a late reader or <br/>
having different interests, or something like that. It&#39;s like being <br/>
crippled in your own body, and I can&#39;t see any reason why a child <br/>
should be crippled if they can (metaphorically) walk and run. <br/>

If a child can&#39;t walk that&#39;s pretty clear.  People don&#39;t take kids to <br/>
physical therapy because they&#39;re not as good at ballet as others their age.<br/>
<br/>
In a school situation where there is special ed money to be claimed, a child <br/>
who reads late has a disability.  Maybe, if the school&#39;s lucky, they can <br/>
identify two or three!  And experts in the world are geared toward identifying <br/>
disabilities that schools want.  And experts tend toward suggesting that <br/>
homeschooling isn&#39;t good for children with special needs.<br/>
<br/>
Not reading at eight isn&#39;t cause for consultation with experts.  <br/>
Being physically uncoordinated isn&#39;t cause for consultation with experts.<br/>
Opening a car door and hitting another car in a parking lot is absolutely and <br/>
certainly not cause for consultaton with experts.  It used to be cause for a <br/>
line of chrome down the middle of every car&#39;s door.  Now with insurance <br/>
companies running things, the line of chrome is out, the claims for Much Bodywork <br/>
are in.  <br/>
<br/>
It might be a serious vision problem.<br/>
What are the odds?<br/>
Dyslexia is not &quot;a serious vision problem.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It might be cheaper and better for the parents to spend an hour researching <br/>
what Howard Gardner and his proponents have written about spatial and <br/>
kinesthetic intelligences and get some ideas there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106226079">-Hi All,<br/>
   I have listened to all the advice here and really put some <br/>
thought into everything and I still have to agree with Robin.  Logan <br/>
originally asked me to take him to the &quot;eye docter&quot;(his words) <br/>
because things were &quot;blurry.&quot;  I thought that he might need glasses <br/>
so of course I took him in.  The optomitrist told me about this, I <br/>
had no idea that some of the things he struggled with could be <br/>
caused by vision!  His eyes don&#39;t work together correctly, which is <br/>
a physical problem.  No one has &quot;made&quot; Logan write or read since we <br/>
started unschooling, he enjoys these things.  It&#39;s just hard for him <br/>
because if he reads too long he gets a head ache or dizzy.  I don&#39;t <br/>
mind reading to him but this frustrated him quite a bit. Also it <br/>
bugs him when the thoughts in his head don&#39;t come out right on paper.<br/>
 Maybe I <br/>
didn&#39;t express myself well enough on my post.  Of course bumping <br/>
that car doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s a problem!  It was just an accident, <br/>
we knew that.  I was just trying to explain that he often doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to be aware of where he is in relation to other things.  I&#39;m <br/>
new at this, dyslexia is the school term for this kind of thing but <br/>
it&#39;s one people understand.  I was trying to give a good discription <br/>
to people who don&#39;t know him.  I pulled him out of school when they <br/>
started the label game.  I was just wondering if other parents had <br/>
been through this or knew more about it.  Thanks again to everyone <br/>
for their advice, the comments about not telling him to pay <br/>
attention <br/>
anymore really hit home.  That definately doesn&#39;t help him and I&#39;m <br/>
glad to be called on it.    <br/>

schools aren&#39;t all that experienced with vision therapy, and the <br/>
therapists often have to fight like heck to get kids the help they <br/>
need with their vision. Schools mainly label kids with vision <br/>
problems as having &quot;attention deficits&quot; and try to go the medication <br/>
route, which does no good. Lots of the literature out there on vision <br/>
therapy talks about the struggles that vision therapists have in <br/>
trying to help kids in school situations. My experience has been that <br/>
the vision therapists we&#39;ve met have made a career out of helping <br/>
kids and adults see better, and that&#39;s what makes these people tick. <br/>
They&#39;ve all been super sweet.<br/>

problems who have been bulldozed by the school system and whose self-<br/>
esteem is poor as a result. They have had nothing but positive <br/>
comments about the fact that our son is homeschooled. Just yesterday <br/>
at his appointment, our therapist pulled my husband aside and told <br/>
him what a joy it is to work with our son, and what a wonderful kid <br/>
he is. Our other therapist lives 3 doors down from us. Her husband <br/>
teaches higher math to homeschooled kids who want it. He says he <br/>
loves homeschoolers because they come to him eager to learn and know, <br/>
and it&#39;s a mile different than teaching kids who don&#39;t care. All of <br/>
our therapists read the front-page article on unschooling that <br/>

know that we unschool. They had nothing but good things to say about <br/>
the article.<br/>

Yes, that&#39;s true. Not reading at eight because you don&#39;t want to is <br/>
certainly not a cause for consultation with experts. Being a little <br/>
uncoordinated isn&#39;t either. But wanting to read at eight and not <br/>
being able to because you see double and the words are blurry *is*, <br/>
IMHO. And walking into things because you don&#39;t see that they are <br/>
there *is*. I can&#39;t imagine sentencing my kid to a life of blurry <br/>
vision because I didn&#39;t want him to see an expert. Likewise, although <br/>
he hasn&#39;t been to an allopathic doctor in years, if he breaks his arm <br/>
we&#39;ll be going to the doctor&#39;s office to set it. There are times and <br/>
places for everything, and when something doesn&#39;t work right on a <br/>

with it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-298013994">And experts tend toward suggesting that homeschooling isn&#39;t good for children with special needs.<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
I can see where this would be true because they are dedicated folks who want to see kids get the help they need.  So often, it seems, folks think the best way to get any kind of special help is thru the public schools, because after all it&#39;s free and the &#39;experts&#39; have been chosen by the school.  For people who think school is a good place and that the education folks have a child&#39;s best interest at heart don&#39;t seem to understand why anyone would decline a free service offered by the local free schools.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember when Will was in public school and I agreed to have him tested for learning disabilities.  When it was determined he was &#39;normal&#39; I actually had teachers encourage me to challenge the findings and insist on more testing until they could find his problems.  These people genuinely believed the only way to help my son was to keep fighting for more services.  Sure, some of that may have been to make their own jobs easier (since it would have gotten him out of their classroom for a part of each day) but a few were sincerely convinced it would help Will.  They were just baffled when I was happy with the finding that he had no disabilities and chose not to fight for services.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a mindset among some specialists and therapists that more intervention is better -- always.  And that the only reason parents would declind more intervention is to save money, or because they can&#39;t afford the best for their child.  They see the public school programs as a way to meet that child&#39;s need, and don&#39;t understand a parent who doesn&#39;t want the state&#39;s involvement.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree that vision problems are about more than one&#39;s ability to read, and when they&#39;re causing a child problems (even if it&#39;s just that he wants to read but can&#39;t) treatment should be sought.  I&#39;m also not surprised when I hear that a therapist or expert strongly pushed public school and discouraged homeschool.  There seems to be a perception that parents who don&#39;t avail themselves of every program are either negligent or in denial about their child&#39;s challenges.  That, and it devalues everything they&#39;ve worked for to have a parent tell them aren&#39;t needed after all.<br/>

I didn&#39;t do that.<br/>
From the post that was sent, the mother seemed to be generalizing all the <br/>

how to deal with their own perceptions.  Unschoolers don&#39;t need that label.  <br/>
And from the description of the problem in that one first post, it neither <br/>
seemed like dyslexia NOR like a problem that needed professional help.<br/>
<br/>
When new/prospective unschoolers come along and say &quot;after this last IEP <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Wanting&quot; to read at eight with or without clear vision isn&#39;t going to be <br/>
what causes reading to kick in.   For little kids, most tiny print is blurry.  <br/>
All the letters look the same to kids at some point.  When that changes is <br/>
different from child to child.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids didn&#39;t learn to read with large-print beginner books.  They learned <br/>
from regular small print, and even TINY print (Holly, Harry Potter cards were <br/>
her first real reading).<br/>
<br/>
-=-And walking into things because you don&#39;t see that they are <br/>

<br/>
Quite dramatically overstated.<br/>
<br/>
I run into things I don&#39;t see becuase I don&#39;t look sometimes.  I&#39;ve closed my <br/>
left hand in a drawer with my right hand half a dozen times in my life.  It <br/>
hurts.  It had nothing to do with vision; I wasn&#39;t even looking.  I know where <br/>
my hands are. Sort of.  Still, I sometimes turn around and whap something with <br/>
my hand.  Something that&#39;s always been there.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s running into things lately and banging her elbow and her head.  <br/>
That&#39;s because she&#39;s getting tall fast, and she forgets where the new ends of <br/>
herself are.  That is absolutely normal.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-There are times and <br/>

<br/>
with it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Based on the original account and the experiences of lots and lots of <br/>
unschooling families, I don&#39;t think my simple suggestion for them to stall on getting <br/>
professional help was worth you getting this worked up about.<br/>
<br/>
You countered the advice with a story of your own.  That&#39;s fine!  No problem.<br/>
But to try to hound me to the ground and try to make me feel guilty is <br/>
irritating and not too helpful (except in that I got to explain why I wrote what I <br/>
wrote).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe part of our different ways of seeing this scenario is just <br/>
living in different parts of the country. Our area has many <br/>
alternative schools and plenty of homeschoolers. It&#39;s considered more <br/>
or less normal here for a child not to be in the regular ol&#39; public <br/>
school. Of the 25 kids in our immediate neighborhood, less than 10 go <br/>
to the public school that is in our area. I&#39;m sure that colors not <br/>
only the perceptions of parents, but of experts that these parents <br/>
might or might not choose to go to. People her are pretty used to <br/>
differing educational choices.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, perhaps not. Though I&#39;m not convinced that your generality is <br/>
accurate either. I know more than a few homeschoolers who have used <br/>
therapists of one stripe or another - OTs (occupational therapists), <br/>
vision therapists, language therapists, etc. and none of them have <br/>
encountered the attitude that you paint here. I think most therapists <br/>
are in the game to help kids, and I think more than a few of them <br/>
recognize that homeschooling families are going out of their way to <br/>
provide the best possible environment for these kids. Most of them <br/>
are also pretty familiar with what kids who are &quot;different&quot; encounter <br/>
in the school system - from teasing and bullying to labeling and <br/>
being considered &quot;behind&quot; in the system. They can see first-hand the <br/>
advantages of homeschooling.<br/>

think that it&#39;s just not good to give this kind of absolutist advice <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;shrug&gt; I didn&#39;t get that out of her post. She listed specific vision <br/>
areas that he was having trouble with and discussed seeing an <br/>
optemetrist and a vision therapist. The title of the post was a bit <br/>
misleading, but other than that, I didn&#39;t see this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;For one thing, dyslexic kids can and DO figure out <br/>
&gt; how to deal with their own perceptions. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That may or may not be true. Some do, some that I&#39;ve known never do. <br/>
Regardless, vision problems are not the same as dyslexia. A vision <br/>
therapist is not the same thing as a reading therapist.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Unschoolers don&#39;t need that label.  <br/>

<br/>
Again, I have to disagree. When someone says &quot;his eyes don&#39;t track <br/>
well together and he has some vision problems&quot;, that sounds like a <br/>
problem that might just need professional help, to me at least.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree. I know plenty of unschoolers who were just uninterested, <br/>
and had their parents read to them until they *were* interested. Just <br/>
like some kids aren&#39;t interested in riding bicycles, painting <br/>
pictures, or doing other things at that age. It&#39;s not a big deal <br/>
until someone makes it a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kids who don&#39;t read early aren&#39;t ready to do it.  <br/>

My son loves to read, wants to read, and can read anything if the <br/>
text is big enough. What frustrates him is that he *wants* to read <br/>
books like Harry Potter (and yes, I&#39;ve read them to him and continue <br/>
to do so, but he wants to read them himself) but he can&#39;t because the <br/>
text is small, his eyes don&#39;t track, he gets blurred and doubled <br/>
vision and his head hurts after 3 or 4 minutes. Heck, if my head hurt <br/>
after 3 minutes of reading I&#39;d be mightily upset as I love to read.<br/>

to read closely spaced or smaller print words is a far cry from what <br/>
you&#39;re talking about (not being ready to read or not being interested <br/>
in reading). If a child&#39;s brain is totally ready to read and *can* <br/>
read words that are far spaced and big, they&#39;re reading but just <br/>
unable to process a book. I see that as a totally different thing.<br/>
<br/>

harder to fix at age 35 or 40, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My kids didn&#39;t learn to read with large-print beginner books.  They <br/>
 </span></blockquote>learned <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; from regular small print, and even TINY print (Holly, Harry Potter <br/>
 </span></blockquote>cards were <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; her first real reading).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bully for your kids. I&#39;m glad that their eyes work well enough to do <br/>
so. My son could read Harry Potter books if the print was big enough <br/>
to take up the living room wall, but he can&#39;t read them if the print <br/>
is tiny. He&#39;s more than ecstatic that after some therapy, his eyes <br/>
are working well enough to let him see smaller and smaller print.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I run into things I don&#39;t see becuase I don&#39;t look sometimes.  I&#39;ve <br/>
 </span></blockquote>closed my <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; left hand in a drawer with my right hand half a dozen times in my <br/>
 </span></blockquote>life.  It <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hurts.  It had nothing to do with vision; I wasn&#39;t even looking.  I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>know where <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my hands are. Sort of.  Still, I sometimes turn around and whap <br/>
 </span></blockquote>something with <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my hand.  Something that&#39;s always been there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I&#39;m glad to hear that your vision works well enough for this <br/>
not to be an hourly or daily problem for you, but a half-a-dozen-<br/>
times-in-a-life problem. For someone with vision problems, this stuff <br/>
happens on a minute-by-minute basis. Again, I&#39;m glad that my son <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to live with that forever. <br/>
<br/>
I guess this seems to me like saying to a person in a <br/>
wheelchair &quot;Well, a few times in my life, my legs have gone to sleep <br/>
and when I tried to stand up, they didn&#39;t work. But hey, *I* don&#39;t <br/>
need a wheelchair to get around.&quot; It&#39;s apples and oranges. Your eyes <br/>
work well, you have very occasional problems where you run into <br/>
things because you aren&#39;t paying attention. My son&#39;s eyes don&#39;t work <br/>
well, he frequently does things like run into doorways, walls, car <br/>
doors, etc.  This winter, he ran into a doorway hard enough to knock <br/>
himself out. I don&#39;t see any reason why he needs to live with poor <br/>
vision just because other people might have these kinds of problems <br/>
occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Holly&#39;s running into things lately and banging her elbow and her <br/>
 </span></blockquote>head.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s because she&#39;s getting tall fast, and she forgets where the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>new ends of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; herself are.  That is absolutely normal.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right. Apples and oranges. It&#39;s normal for her. I have one normal kid <br/>
too. Her eyes work fine, she gets the occasional bumps and bruises. <br/>
Perhaps if all my kids were like her, I wouldn&#39;t understand vision <br/>
issues either. But my son is another case entirely, he&#39;s not like <br/>
her, his eyes don&#39;t work like hers, and I&#39;m glad that there&#39;s a way <br/>
to help his eyes change so that they work together. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Based on the original account and the experiences of lots and lots <br/>
 </span></blockquote>of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; unschooling families, I don&#39;t think my simple suggestion for them <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to stall on getting <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; professional help was worth you getting this worked up about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I understand that you feel that way. I hold a different <br/>
opinion. I think to tell a family that their child is perfectly fine <br/>
and doesn&#39;t need help based on one email is at best irresponsible. <br/>
I&#39;m &quot;worked up about it&quot; as you say, because I can see the difference <br/>
that vision therapy has made in my kid&#39;s life. It&#39;s very near and <br/>
dear to my heart right now. I get equally &quot;worked up&quot; about <br/>
unschooling, as do many people on this list, because we can see how <br/>
big a difference it makes in children&#39;s lives. And when people slag <br/>
unschooling, especially people who don&#39;t know anything about it, it&#39;s <br/>
worth getting &quot;worked up&quot; about to let people know. I feel the same <br/>
way about the vision therapy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You countered the advice with a story of your own.  That&#39;s fine!  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>No problem.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But to try to hound me to the ground and try to make me feel guilty <br/>
 </span></blockquote>is <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; irritating and not too helpful (except in that I got to explain why <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wrote what I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wrote).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you explained it. I still disagree, but I see a bit where <br/>
you&#39;re coming from. I&#39;m not trying to hound you or make you feel <br/>
guilty, but I do feel that your advice was wrong, and I think it&#39;s <br/>
important enough to counter it (as you do so many times with people&#39;s <br/>
unschooling advice, for largely the same reasons).  I hope this list <br/>
will always be a place where people get to see more than one side of <br/>
unschooling, more than one family&#39;s vision. My family are <br/>
unschoolers, we love everything about it. My son takes vision <br/>
therapy, I don&#39;t see it as running counter to unschooling at all, any <br/>
more than I would having an unschooling kid in a wheelchair who gets <br/>
physical therapy. I think this is an important issue, and I&#39;m glad it <br/>
came up on the list.<br/>

Unschoolers who for one reason or another have had to make the <br/>
decision to investigate and/or pursue therapy for some issue that <br/>
their child is facing. I know for our family, we are neither seekers <br/>
nor avoiders of specialized training and experience. It was a hard <br/>
decision to make and we had to evaluate both the potential for good <br/>
and the potential for harm in getting the &quot;experts&quot; involved in our <br/>
child&#39;s life. Sharing the process and the outcome of our decision <br/>
with other unschoolers who might have to face it seems like a helpful <br/>
thing to me. I think it&#39;s very on-topic in discussions of unschooling <br/>
as not just an educational decision, but a lifestyle.<br/>

<br/>
The experts don&#39;t know about different kinds of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
They won&#39;t be discriminating between unschoolers and structured <br/>
homeschoolers.  Most of them have no idea about homeschooling.  Many of them, because they <br/>
are heavily schooled themselves and invested in schools and schooling, have <br/>
school-leaning opinions.<br/>

&gt; ======================<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>FWIW...<br/>
<br/>
When I was about 6 or 7, my mom took me to a vision therapist and I was<br/>
diagnosed with a convergence problem, which sounds like what&#39;s  being<br/>
discussed here though no one&#39;s called it that. Basically, the muscles in my<br/>
eyes didn&#39;t work together although my vision is 20/20. The words didn&#39;t get<br/>
&quot;blurry&quot; really, they would just start to &quot;swim&quot; around on the page. They<br/>
would start to split in two--two words, two lines, two paragraphs--all at<br/>
once. The doctor was amazed that I read at all, never mind avidly. He<br/>
prescribed these really annoying eye exercised designed to strengthen the<br/>
muscles and give them practice working together.<br/>
<br/>
I *hated* those exercises and pretty much refused to do them. Despite my<br/>
parents best efforts, the exercises just never happened. They were boring,<br/>
made my eyes hurt, gave me a headache, and there were lots of other things<br/>
that I would rather have been doing.<br/>
<br/>
I continued to read. I went to grad school for English literature, got my<br/>
PhD--all without the eye exercises and by working through the problem on my<br/>
own. I&#39;m sure all the reading I did must have helped strengthen the muscles<br/>
some. In grad school, I wore slightly magnified reading glasses a lot<br/>
because they took some of the strain off my eyes. It was worst when I was<br/>
doing lots of archival work and reading 17th and 18th century texts and<br/>
newspapers on microfiche. Not the best quality facsimiles.<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, maybe this is why I seemed clumsy to some people--maybe<br/>
why my mom always called me things like Calamity Jane and Mrs. Magoo. Who<br/>
knows. Point is, I got the diagnosis, but I don&#39;t think it really made a bit<br/>
of difference in how I lived or progressed with my reading. It did, however,<br/>
create tension and animosity between myself and my parents, but maybe that<br/>
would have been there no matter what...<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d share my experience.<br/>

Sounds like your eyes had trouble converging. That&#39;s one of the <br/>

vision).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a bummer. I&#39;m glad that the therapies have come a long way <br/>
since then. I remember my cousin having to do something similar, and <br/>
similarly hating it. My son gets to do exercises with Yu-Gi-Oh cards, <br/>
Where&#39;s Waldo books, Pokemon characters, and other stuff. They change <br/>
every week. He usually asks me to do them with him, and we have a <br/>
good time. I think (as with so many things), there&#39;s a huge <br/>
difference in a child voluntarily doing something, and being forced <br/>
to do something. <br/>

decision about something like this - not knowing how it will turn out <br/>
for any one kid. On one hand, wonderful success stories like yours. <br/>
On the other hand, stories from people I&#39;ve met whose issues never <br/>
resolved and who ended up being very hampered by an increasingly <br/>
disparate gap between their innate abilities and the ability of their <br/>
eyes to function. And many of them very bitter that their parents <br/>
didn&#39;t pursue a solution when it was possible. In the end, I&#39;m glad <br/>
that my son can have a different experience, a much more pleasurable <br/>
journey with his therapists than what people have described from a <br/>
couple decades ago!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah, I also forgot the physical aspects of exercises they&#39;re <br/>
doing with him as well. My son never lost the Moro reflex (where <br/>
babies fling their arms out when startled). As a big kid, this means <br/>
he sometimes knocks into things abruptly with his arms if he is <br/>
surprised. Also, it means that his body doesn&#39;t uncurl very easily. <br/>
He can&#39;t sit upright in a chair, for instance. This makes it hard to <br/>
play games on our computer, because he can&#39;t put his feet up on the <br/>
desk and simultaneously reach the keyboard. He has to kneel on the <br/>
chair or somehow get his body into a position that works. Eating is <br/>
hard too, and food gets dropped on the floor frequently (good thing <br/>
we have a dog!) because he can&#39;t sit up straight over his plate (good <br/>
thing he didn&#39;t grow up in my house, LOL).<br/>
<br/>
Also, he he had problems with the left-right aspects of his body. His <br/>
hands have trouble crossing the center line of his body (he used to <br/>
draw and write on the left side of the page with his left hand, and <br/>
the right side with his right). This makes things like getting <br/>
dressed tough, because you have to be able to hold your left sleeve <br/>
with your right hand and that is incredibly hard for him. It also <br/>
makes it hard for him to play some video games - he&#39;s told me that he <br/>
has a tough time on games where he has to use his right hand to hit <br/>
keys on the left side of the keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, these are all things that are being addressed in vision <br/>
therapy, so that basic life skills like eating and getting dressed, <br/>
as well as stuff like video games, drawing, and writing, are all <br/>
getting easier. Much less frustrating for him.<br/>
<br/>
Thought I&#39;d throw that out in case anyone else has encountered this. <br/>
I never would&#39;ve thought that all these things are connected, or that <br/>
they could be helped with visual and body-patterning exercises.<br/>

ended up breaking. It&#39;s a cool idea though. I&#39;d like to get one <br/>
again, just for myself.<br/>

sort of lean back?  Like this:<br/>

<br/>
Your sort of kneeling on it, but with your legs wrapped.  The first link<br/>
shows someone sitting in one.<br/>
