&gt;When <br/>
&gt;our first child was born, I questioned him on school exemption letters, <br/>
&gt;because I thought at the time that only some religions were allowed to <br/>
&gt;object <br/>
&gt;across the board.  He told me that basically all religions have some <br/>
&gt;guidelines such as &quot;Don&#39;t harm your children&quot;, therefore, as long as you <br/>
&gt;believe that by following your faith means not vaccinating, you can <br/>
&gt;religiously object.<br/>

choice when looking for books about vaccinations.<br/>
<br/>
Its very important you get the rule for your state on this issue to make <br/>
sure that you are covered by any legalities.<br/>
<br/>
Some states are more lenient than others as to recognizing all religions. <br/>
Some states require only certain religions.<br/>
