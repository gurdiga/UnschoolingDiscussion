<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659533782"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; We live in &quot;the hub of western Iowa&quot; (that&#39;s what the<br/>
&gt; sign says anyway!)--Carroll, pop. ~10,000. I can see a<br/>
&gt; cornfield from my home office window.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to tell you that 10,000 is NOT a small town!  We are a &quot;big&quot; town for<br/>
this area, an we are under 1,000!  There are two towns (okay, villages)<br/>
within 15 miles of us who have populations of under 50.<br/>
<br/>
If you are in a city of 10,000 you have *lots* of opportunities!<br/>
