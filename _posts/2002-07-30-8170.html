 </span></blockquote>Well - once we talk about earlier and later ANYTHING, some people take that <br/>
as exactly what you said - or even worse - like it is somehow bad to be late <br/>
and good to be early. THAT is the notion I&#39;d rather do away with.<br/>
<br/>
It is just a fact - some kids learn to walk really young and some when they <br/>
are older -- that is, earlier and later than the average.<br/>
<br/>
Well - I&#39;m a statistician and lower and higher than average don&#39;t feel like <br/>
value judgements to me, just descriptions - but I do get your point, Dar.<br/>
<br/>
I just told somebody in person (hi Roseanna &lt;G&gt;) that my two kids who were <br/>
really early readers were really late in developing the physical ability to <br/>
write (handwriting, I mean, not composition) comfortably. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t really think of a more descriptive way to say it. I didn&#39;t mean that <br/>
it was good they read early or bad they wrote later - it just was.<br/>
<br/>
I could say they were really &quot;young&quot; when they read and &quot;old&quot; when they wrote <br/>
-- but that isn&#39;t really different.<br/>
<br/>
I think we just have to take the variation in human development for granted <br/>
and not attach any judgement to whether they are early or later at anything. <br/>
It describes a kid&#39;s development - it is interesting for that reason only.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226987258">In Raymond Moore&#39;s latest book, &quot;Homeschooling without Stress&quot;  (I think<br/>
this is the title), he talks at length about this.  I was a late reader,<br/>
not until 11, and I was in Public school.  They labeled me with a lot of<br/>
disabilities but really I have none just a different way of learning.<br/>
My son, Nate, is a late reader.  He had to read in school but he did it<br/>
with lots of discomfort.  I noticed the boys, mainly, are later.  In<br/>
this town, kids have to read beginning in first grade, and if they are<br/>
behind they need to go to special jump start reading.  The school<br/>
district takes it so seriously, they just implemented full day<br/>
kindergarten so that all 5 - 6 year old know how to read.  The school<br/>
thing got to be so stressful that we just will not let Nate go, even if<br/>
he wanted to.  Lisa <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570139064">I&#39;m reading the discussion on what to label the site where Sandra&#39;s posted my <br/>
story, and I&#39;ve gotta tell you, I&#39;m laughing my head off. :)  <br/>
<br/>
There wasn&#39;t anything NATURAL about how my daughter learned to read. Please <br/>
please don&#39;t label the story Natural Reading or some such blather.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s important about my story and Carol&#39;s is that they&#39;re about kids who <br/>
were trying to learn to read and not succeeding. Struggling with it. <br/>
Agonizing over it sometimes, and finally all the pieces fell into place. It&#39;s <br/>
a different story from those of kids who read later because they weren&#39;t <br/>
interested until later, for whom learning to read was fairly simple once they <br/>
decided to do it.<br/>
<br/>
People have a problem with the word &quot;late&quot; in this context, fine. Don&#39;t use <br/>
it. I don&#39;t think she was particularly late, anyway. But I have a BIG problem <br/>
with the word natural in this context. There is nothing natural about <br/>
learning to read. Course, I realize a whole bunch of folks are not going to <br/>
like it if I say call it &quot;When reading DOESN&#39;T come naturally&quot; - althought <br/>
frankly that&#39;s how I think of it in comparison to my other kids who just <br/>
seemed to learn to read like they learned to breathe.<br/>
<br/>
So....   When reading doesn&#39;t come easily. That&#39;s what I&#39;d like it posted <br/>
under, thank you.<br/>

how good he was at it.  But he couldn&#39;t write neatly to save his life <br/>
(still can&#39;t at 24)  When I took him out of school in grade 2, I had him <br/>
tested at the neuropsych lab at the local university.  They had never come <br/>
across a kid who could read so well but had such lousy fine motor control.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I think I like &quot;later&quot; and &quot;earlier&quot; better than &quot;late&quot; and &quot;early&quot;. They<br/>
sound more like comparisons to a mean than value judgements.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Late&quot; is just a sin in this culture.<br/>
<br/>
If I say to Holly, &quot;Wendy will be here later,&quot; that&#39;s okay.  That&#39;s something <br/>
to look forward to.<br/>
<br/>
If I say &quot;Wendy will be late,&quot; Wendy is a bad person who didn&#39;t care Holly <br/>
was waiting for her.<br/>
<br/>
(This happened last night. &lt;g&gt;  Holly was waiting to go bike riding between <br/>
7:00 and 7:30, and Wendy showed up at 7:33.  *LATE* and so Holly was miffed.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I read somewhere that if boys&#39; reading abilities were compared only to<br/>
other boys, rather than to average reading levels of X-aged kids as a<br/>
whole, something like 70% of kids formerly labeled learning disabled<br/>
because of reading (reading level 2 yrs or more below average) would no<br/>
longer qualify.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Boys fail first grade; girls don&#39;t.  And so many researchers and <br/>
theorists have known for years and years that first grade is too soon for <br/>
boys, but they do it anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
Part of the mythology of the U.S., if not all the English speaking world, is <br/>
that all men are created equal.  So &quot;Fairness&quot; means you treat people the <br/>
same, and give them the same opportunities.  But kindergarten and first grade <br/>
are NOT fair and are NOT the same opportunity, because roughly half the kids <br/>
are &quot;behind&quot; the day they show up.<br/>
<br/>
Then later, because of just-as-natural growth patterns, the boys reach a <br/>
point where they become competent and analytical and the girls get their own <br/>
pubescent realities, and THAT is when they choose to teach algebra, when the <br/>
boys just perked up and got sharp and the girls just got soggy and crampy.<br/>
<br/>
And just even to SAY that is to open me to criticism of sexism and stupidity, <br/>
but there it is; I said it.<br/>

Well true -- but usually they can handle a few nights away without sobbing<br/>
uncontrollably:)<br/>
Interesting here because at the hospitals all have large family rooms as<br/>
family members and &quot;sitters&quot; stay around the clock with people who are<br/>
hospitalized. Apparantly most of the middle and older aged people cannot<br/>
handle sleeping with no one else in the room as alll their life they have<br/>
had people around them at all time. <br/>
