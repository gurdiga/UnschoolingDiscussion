(I was going to send this offlist but it wouldn&#39;t go)<br/>
<br/>
I am having a bit of &quot;conference envy&quot; with all the reviews and<br/>
excitement at unschoolingdiscussion.com.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have a vague memory of you mentioning being in the Cincinnati or Ohio<br/>
area in Spring of 2004.  Is that something that may still happen?  If<br/>
so, I would be happy to be part of planning and working out a day<br/>
program,  or speaking time or anything.  There seems to be a growing<br/>
interest in our area lately.  Or maybe I just notice it more since I<br/>
have &quot;come out of the closet&quot; about my unschooling family life.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I could be mistaken about this...my list time has been sporadic in<br/>
recent months..too much life to live with four children :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Susan<br/>
