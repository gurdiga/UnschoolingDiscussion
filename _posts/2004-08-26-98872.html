A new, statewide email list has been created on yahoo for Louisiana <br/>
Unschoolers!  If you live in or around Louisiana and are an unschooler, or are <br/>
interested in learning more about unschooling, please check out our list.  <br/>
There are already lots of links for book recommendations, essays and <br/>
articles, resources and much more...not to mention some very cute photos of Louisiana <br/>
Unschooler kids  : )  After joining, please feel free to add your own favorite <br/>
links and photos.<br/>
Our newest member, Valerie Fitzenreiter from Lake Charles, authored the book, <br/>
The Unprocessed Child.  Valerie radically unschooled her daughter, Laurie, <br/>
from birth (Laurie is presently up in Baton Rouge getting her Ph.D.).  They will <br/>
both be coming to New Orleans to speak to Louisiana Unschoolers in December <br/>
at a mini-conference we are in the process of organizing!  <br/>
<br/>
The list is for unschoolers in the state of Louisiana and interested <br/>
Mississippians to make connections and find support with like-minded people; plan and <br/>
attend field trips around the state and share resources.  Come join us!<br/>
