<div id="ygrps-yiv-109917355">Research Associate in the field of Child Development and Human RelationsA friend sent this to me. This is long, but gave me a chuckle<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago, when I was picking up the children<br/>
at school, another mother I knew well rushed up to<br/>
me. Emily was fuming with indignation. &quot;Do you<br/>
know what you and I are?&quot; she demanded. Before I<br/>
could answer and I didn&#39;t really have one handy -<br/>
she blurted out the reason for her question.<br/>
It seemed she had just returned from renewing her<br/>
driver&#39;s license at The County Clerk&#39;s office.<br/>
Asked by the woman recorder to state her occupation,<br/>
Emily had hesitated, uncertain how to classify<br/>
herself. What I mean is,&quot; explained the recorder,<br/>
&quot;do you have a job, or are you just a .....?&quot; &quot;Of<br/>
course I have a job,&quot; snapped Emily. &quot;I&#39;m a mother.&quot;<br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t list &#39;mother&#39; as an<br/>
occupation...&#39;housewife&#39; covers it,&quot;said the<br/>
recorder emphatically.<br/>
<br/>
I forgot all about her story until one day I found<br/>
myself in the same situation, this time at our own<br/>
Town Hall. The Clerk was obviously a career woman,<br/>
poised, efficient, and possessed of a high-sounding<br/>
title like &quot;Official Interrogator&quot; or &quot;Town<br/>
Registrar.&quot; &quot;And what is your occupation?&quot; she<br/>
probed. What made me say it, I do not know. The<br/>
words simply popped out. &quot;I&#39;m a Research Associate<br/>
in the field of Child Development and Human<br/>
Relations.&quot; The clerk paused, ball-point pen frozen<br/>
in midair, and looked up as though she had not heard<br/>
right. I repeated the title slowly, emphasizing<br/>
the most significant words. Then I stared with<br/>
wonder as my pompous pronouncement was written in<br/>
bold,black ink on the<br/>
official questionnaire. &quot;Might I ask,&quot; said the<br/>
clerk with new<br/>
interest,&quot;just what you do in your field?&quot; Coolly,<br/>
without any trace of fluster in my voice, I heard<br/>
myself reply, &quot;I have a continuing program of<br/>
research (what mother doesn&#39;t) in the<br/>
laboratory and in the field (normally I would have<br/>
said indoors and out). I&#39;m working for my Masters<br/>
(the whole darned family) and already have four<br/>
credits (all daughters). &quot;Of course, the job is one<br/>
of the most demanding in the humanities (any mother<br/>
care to disagree?) and I often work 14 hours a day<br/>
(24 is more like it). But the job is more<br/>
challenging than most<br/>
run-of-the-mill careers and the rewards are in<br/>
satisfaction rather than just money.&quot; There was an<br/>
increasing note of respect in the clerk&#39;s voice as<br/>
she completed the form, stood up, and personally<br/>
ushered me to the door.<br/>
<br/>
As I drove into our driveway, buoyed up by my<br/>
glamorous new career, I was greeted by my lab<br/>
assistants - ages 13, 7, and 3. Upstairs I could<br/>
hear our new experimental model (6 months) in the<br/>
child-development program, testing out a new vocal<br/>
pattern. I felt triumphant! I had scored a beat on<br/>
bureaucracy! And I had gone on the official records<br/>
as someone more distinguished and indispensable to<br/>
mankind than &quot;just another mother.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Motherhood...what a glorious career. Especially when<br/>
there&#39;s a title on the door.<br/>
<br/>
Whether a<br/>
stay at home Mom or a career Mom, we should all<br/>
carry this title.<br/>
The Images of Mother:<br/>
4 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mommy can do anything!<br/>
8 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mom knows a lot! A whole lot!<br/>
12 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mother doesn&#39;t really know<br/>
quite everything.<br/>
14 YEARS OF AGE ~ Naturally, Mother doesn&#39;t know<br/>
that, either.<br/>
16 YEARS OF AGE ~ Mother? She&#39;s hopelessly<br/>
old-fashioned.<br/>
18 YEARS OF AGE ~ That old woman? She&#39;s way out of<br/>
date!<br/>
25 YEARS OF AGE ~ Well, she might know a little bit<br/>
about it.<br/>
35 YEARS OF AGE ~ Before we decide, let&#39;s get Mom&#39;s<br/>
opinion.<br/>
45 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought<br/>
about it?<br/>
65 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wish I could talk it over with<br/>
Mom.<br/>
