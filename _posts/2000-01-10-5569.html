<div id="ygrps-yiv-657075709">Hi there...<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is also asking for more structure in math.  It must be<br/>
partially age related because she is about to turn 11.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has enjoyed (yes...enjoyed!) the math books by Janice<br/>
VanCleave...there is one called Geometry for Every Kid  and one called Math<br/>
for every Kid. There may be others that are math related but I haven&#39;t seen<br/>
them. The publisher is John Wiley from New York.  She works independently<br/>
on this and really likes that.<br/>
<br/>
The other books that I would highly recommend are the series published by<br/>
Kids Can Press out of Toronto.<br/>
There is one on Squares (ISBN 1-55074-273-6), one on Circles (ISBN<br/>
1-55074-064-4) and one on Triangles(ISBN 1-55074-064-4). They are<br/>
well-organized books in that they have a little bit of geog/history thrown<br/>
in for interest...and they  include making manipulatives. They are<br/>
well-written and are kid-friendly yet do not &#39;talk down&#39; to the reader.<br/>
Check them out too. Very original work, I thought.<br/>
<br/>
All the best, <br/>
Brooke in B.C. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760816055">There have been some great suggestions! I&#39;ll add a couple my 11 year old son<br/>
has enjoyed...     <br/>
<br/>
The Key To workbooks published by Key Curriculum Press... there are<br/>
decimals, fractions, measurement, metric, percents, geometry and algebra.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen them in different catalogs and education supply stores, or you can<br/>
order them directly from the publisher: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.keypress.com/">http://www.keypress.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
A book we recently purchased is &quot;Problem Solving in Mathematics&quot;  (Lane<br/>
County Mathematics Project) published by Dale Seymour. My 11 year old loves<br/>
these kinds of math problems... the emphasis is on thinking and problem<br/>
solving, not rote memorization and drill. These books are $20 each, and<br/>
there&#39;s one each from 4th through 9th grade, I think. They are in the Dale<br/>
Seymour catalog and you can also get them from bn.com or amazon.com.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I am really enjoying reading &quot;About Teaching Mathematics&quot; by<br/>
Marilyn Burns. This book is geared towards classroom teachers but I&#39;ve found<br/>
much in here that I can use. She also emphasizes problem solving and<br/>
exploration.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Something about those pre-adolescent girls.  We love the two books you <br/>
mentioned.  And the software Math for the Real World; Emily can usually be <br/>
found at the computer before breakfast doing that, sometimes with her two <br/>
year old sister dancing to the music with her.<br/>

Please elucidate regarding the software...<br/>
is it games or word problems ???<br/>
who makes it???Bronderbund???<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s made by Davidson and is recommended for ages 10 and up. It has a lot of <br/>
real life scenarios in which you have to use different mathematical concepts <br/>
and operations.  Examples:  figuring how much food you can get at a <br/>
restaurant with the money you have, calculating mileage on a trip, building <br/>
roads, word problems with pie graphs, ordering from heaviest to lightest.<br/>
<br/>
Emily says to tell you it&#39;s awesome!<br/>
<br/>
My kids also like Math Blaster (also by Davidson), but it is not nearly as <br/>
exciting to them as Math for the Real World.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Marcie, <br/>
Did you notice if &quot;Math for the Real World&quot; has any reference to metric?<br/>
Everything we study pertaining to math  is metric-based  here in<br/>
Canada...we dabble in lbs. for weight but that is about it.<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering, <br/>
Brooke<br/>

<br/>
No, I don&#39;t it deals with the metric system.<br/>
<br/>
Where do you live in Canada?  We&#39;re in S.E. Michigan and go to Ontario <br/>
frequently.  I was a French teacher in my former life (!!) and we want to <br/>
take the girls to Quebec some time this year to have them experience a <br/>
different dialect of French.  <br/>
