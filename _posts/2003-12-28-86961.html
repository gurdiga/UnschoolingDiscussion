 </span></blockquote>We just try to play lots of games (6 dd, 5dd, 3 ds). I have phonics cubes, <br/>
letter dice (boggle cubes work, too), magnetic letters on the fridge, etc. <br/>
that we&#39;ll play games with. Sometimes we&#39;ll throw them up in the air and <br/>
make as many real words as we can. Sometimes the kids like to put them <br/>
together and make me say the words they make--they always have great fun <br/>
with that one.  Sometimes they like to just play around in the <br/>
word-processing program on the computer. We also play lots of verbal word <br/>
games--end rhymes, alliteration, and word association. Dh is notorious for <br/>
beginning limericks that are so ridiculous, he couldn&#39;t possibly find the <br/>
rhymes to finish them. That&#39;s always fun for the whole family!<br/>
<br/>
I think that my kids are learning a lot about language without anything <br/>
&quot;formal.&quot; Dh tried to talk my oldest into practicing her reading every day <br/>
because &quot;that was how she would get better&quot;--he made a &quot;deal&quot; with her and <br/>
then left me to carry it out. For maybe three weeks, we sat down once a day <br/>
or so when she felt like it (though she never really felt like it). There <br/>
were good days, and there were bad days. I dropped it pretty quickly, and <br/>
apologized to her for the whole ordeal. We talked about what might make <br/>
reading fun and what kinds of things make it NOT fun. I suspect that if a <br/>
child really wants to learn to read by sounding things out, she will do <br/>
that and ask for help AS she needs it--when she&#39;s truly trying to read <br/>
something that&#39;s important to her. Systematic lessons of any sort are not <br/>
likely to be successful unless the child undertakes them on her own, in my <br/>
opinion and limited experience anyway. I guess you could always brainstorm <br/>
different ideas with your son, try them out and evaluate them as you go, <br/>
being sure to listen if he says that they&#39;re not what he&#39;s wanting to do. I <br/>
think respect and following your child&#39;s lead is crucial, even if he <br/>
decides he wants to stop altogether.<br/>

I think an important thing to remember is that when he wants to and is<br/>
ready, he will learn....<br/>
<br/>
Some words you can sound out and some you just kind of have to remember what<br/>
they look like...so what you are telling your son sounds on target to me.<br/>
<br/>
We play lots of games that have words in them, sometimes just a word or two<br/>
like &quot;Uncle Wiggly&quot;.  Or when we are reading a story and we come to a word I<br/>
know Marsie knows, I might point to the word and let her read that one (she<br/>
takes great delight in knowing how to read words in &quot;big&quot; books).  Zach&#39;s<br/>
reading took off when he discovered Yu-Gi-Oh because reading made the game<br/>
so much easier for him.  We also might do treasure hunts where I would write<br/>
the name of the next place to look on a post-it note and have them posted<br/>
all over the house. And if one of the kids asks me to read to them, I do,<br/>
period.<br/>
<br/>
But I think the most important thing you can do is to take learning to read<br/>
as just another stepping stone, like learning to talk or walk. Make sure he<br/>
has lots of opportunities, happily help him when he needs it, don&#39;t try to<br/>
&quot;make&quot; him learn or force the issue in any way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-448450233">My two youngest are girls aged 7 and 9, and all the help that I give then is reading to them and telling them what a word is when they ask me.  I don&#39;t bother with helping them sound out words, I just tell them the word, since as you have found sounding out isn&#39;t always helpful.  When they are writing they sometimes come and ask me to spell a word for them and I ask them what they think the first letter is, they tell me than and then often keep going spelling the word out together.  They are getting quite good at sounding out words since they have become more interested in spelling.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In Spanish it works to sound out letters because they are &#39;pure&#39; <br/>
sounds, even the vowels. In English though you&#39;d have to divide words <br/>
by sounds. So:<br/>
<br/>
ight<br/>
ould<br/>
ood<br/>
eam<br/>
ing<br/>
ent<br/>
L<br/>
kn<br/>
n<br/>
<br/>
are all single sounds.<br/>
<br/>
It helps Evan to see words like that. So when I read to him I sometimes <br/>
cover the beginning or ending sound he does not know. Then he feels his <br/>
way to the word. I also made word domino cards. We play with them just <br/>
like with dominoes but by matching sounds to make a word. This has led <br/>
us to the use of a dictionary. He made a match with BR and EAM. I had <br/>
no idea it was a word. He found it immensely satisfying that there were <br/>
things that (1) I did not know and (2) you could find in this big fat <br/>
book. The mystery of the big fat book was revealed to him. He sometimes <br/>
just flips through the dictionary, fanning the pages, just for the heck <br/>
of it. It&#39;s very interesting to see the different kinds of sensory <br/>
relationships he has while their learning.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve announced this before but Evan is starting to <br/>
read. He can actually take a Level 1 or 2 book, like from the &quot;I can <br/>
read&quot; series or an Eric Carl book, and sit down and work his way <br/>
through it. It&#39;s cool to hear him swirling the sounds in his mouth. <br/>
Sometimes he makes up the pronunciation or the word. It&#39;s such an <br/>
awesome moment, when he works through the hurdle of a word. Just a few <br/>
months ago he would get frustrated and stop. Now, he just tries <br/>
different things. He&#39;s getting less and less discouraged by not knowing <br/>
how to do something.<br/>
<br/>
Now Aidan will sometimes bring him a book or a Yugi-Oh card so his big <br/>
bro will read it to him. They&#39;ll spend a good 20-30 minutes there <br/>
&#39;reading&#39; sans adult. It&#39;s just too cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048637550">&quot;kazooz wrote...about reading...<br/>
<br/>
I have found that just telling them the word  and going on  has worked best for our 8 yr  olds. Sometimes-(Rarely)  I can say&quot; it is spelled and you say it the same as&quot;....<br/>
Stephanie will take that in more often than Kara. Neither of them remember all  (or even most)  of the time. If I say anything more so it sounds like a bit of &quot;reading instruction&quot; Kara usually either  &quot;goes ballistic&quot; or  quits whatever she is reading Immediately<br/>
We  did the phonics  book ....&quot;Hundred Lessons&quot; when they were 5/6  and tried &quot;homeschooling&quot; before we moved to unschooling in  April  03.<br/>
Kara has  a lot of difficulty  but  at this  point absolutely refuses  to &quot;sound things out and screams that she is never going to :-) I have dropped  saying that (almost)  entirely with her.Their reading gets better all the time but  they do no  required reading outloud or reading lessons of any kind.  Their reading/writing now is all done in the context of an e-mail they wish to send-signs-notes they write for their games-instructions  for their video games etc..<br/>
We are truly amazed at how well they read doing it this way. They used to always like to be read to daily but now usually say no thanks. They get tons of books home from the library weekly still.We read some to them if they like-they look at some-   Stephanie  reads some of them and I dont even know  she  did until I ask if this should go back to the library and  she  says oh sure  I read it it tells about how....<br/>
Neither are  &quot;readers&quot;-boo hoo-  Kara  has dyslexic tendencies  and has problems taking in  auditory information.<br/>
She is the computer-video game whiz. Can totally concentrate on solving them  for hours.<br/>
And how do I deal with all this?   I really try.. usually it is great..  sometimes I brood about  what if I am totally screwing up...sometimes like Kara I &quot; go ballistic&quot;  unfortunately that  tendency has been the bane of my life.<br/>
<br/>
grace<br/>
 Where  the girls  friend just phoned and now they want to be 15 miles from here &quot;right away&quot; but   have pulled out some toys on the table...so better go and see what the agenda is. <br/>

&lt;&lt; Any thoughts on how to help him learn how to <br/>
<br/>
read? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Get him to dictate a little story to you and type it out, put it in a large <br/>
font, and print it for him.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe take the words from the story and list them separate from the story, or <br/>
put them on 3x5 cards so he can sort those he can read from those that don&#39;t <br/>
look like words to him yet.  That way he has a flashcard set of words he <br/>
chose.  And if some of them are really hard words (&quot;through&quot; or whatever) just tell <br/>
him some words are weird (like &quot;weird&quot;) and not to worry, because eventually <br/>
he will know them all.<br/>
<br/>
Making lists of words that only change in one element can be fun.  We have <br/>
some pull-strip things we made where you make slots to pull one strip of paper <br/>
through.  But reader rabbit and some other kinds of computer games do something <br/>
like that.  You can make home-stuff, though, or just sets of cards or lists <br/>
of words, like<br/>
<br/>
pat<br/>
pet<br/>
pit<br/>
pot<br/>
put<br/>
<br/>
or <br/>
<br/>
how<br/>
pow<br/>
now<br/>
cow<br/>
tower<br/>
power<br/>
cower<br/>
<br/>
because if you make your own lists you can stop the second he seems <br/>
frustrated or uninterested, or you can keep going.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can just add &quot;s&quot; to things and that&#39;s a cheap thrill (and a fair scrabble <br/>
move too &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Not all the words can take an &quot;s&quot; and that will help him know that there are <br/>
combinations of letters which can be sounded out but aren&#39;t words.<br/>
<br/>
how<br/>
pow<br/>
now<br/>
cows <br/>
towers<br/>
powers<br/>
cowers<br/>
<br/>
hows pows and nows wouldn&#39;t be words, really, but in the phrases &quot;how&#39;s about <br/>
that?&quot; and &quot;now&#39;s a good time&quot; it sounds like it would.  I would slough over <br/>
contractions and possessives with little kids learning to read unless they <br/>
really needed to have one for something.   I save all tricky stuff, and usually <br/>
they figure it out on their own.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll come and ask.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever you do, just do it as a game, not as a lesson.    And don&#39;t press to <br/>
do it.  Wait until he presses, because if he&#39;s not really ready to get it, he <br/>
might feel slow if he tries and it&#39;s not happening.   So play with words and <br/>
sounds, but try to turn off all your teacher/measurer/testing brain parts so <br/>
that you don&#39;t care whether he gets it now, you only care that he&#39;s having a <br/>
good time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594187005">l  believe that all of  of the info re:  demonstrating  blends-sounds- like  &quot;ight&quot; - &quot;ing&quot; etc are great and  certainly part of teaching reading if you are homeschooling. <br/>
With   unschooling, when the child shows an interest in having you  play word games or having you  show them ways of  recognizing and  working out how to sound out words there are so many neat ways to play with sounds and words as previous posters mentioned.<br/>
However if the child only wants you to  &quot;answer the question&quot; ...What is this word? then I find with my girls that just telling them works best . <br/>
Kara in particular  but Steph  also often  wants no more information than  what they ask for. Right now they  will have no part of Scrabble Jr. Boggle etc. although they are on the shelf and  we  have  started games with them.    They like  &quot;hangman&quot;, though   and will play it sometimes.<br/>
They are more likely to want to play new games   with Grandpa as he has no past history of doing compulsory reading  etc. as I unfortunately have.<br/>
That said- they  often  have  me  type out and then print off their stories and they like  to read them over to us.<br/>
Sometimes they spend hours writing e-mails by asking me how to spell  words. The computer is in my bedroom so this usually happens when I am lying down  with my arithritic knees.<br/>
Right now  for them it is all about  them being able to control their own time and most of the time I am able to accomadate that with no problem.<br/>

<br/>
The elk are still  standing around the pony&#39;s hayfeeder.They feed right beside her, she seems to enjoy their company. I, on the other hand  am not happy about feeding   4$  hay bales to elk that are perfectly capable of rustling their own feed  ;-)  We have quit feeding  late in the evening so there   are just  small amounts to be  pawed out of the new snow.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m the same way. If my kids ask me anything I will answer them if I know<br/>
right away. If not, I&#39;ll look it up and not ask them to. Most times they are<br/>
right there beside me wanting to know too. A lot of times if I don&#39;t know,<br/>
they will say it&#39;s okay that they will find out on their own. (sigh)<br/>
<br/>
I know when they started to ask about spelling things or even reading, Joe<br/>
would do the whole &quot;well let&#39;s sound it out or how do you think it&#39;s<br/>
spelled?&quot; So I talked to him about that. I think he never really thought<br/>
about it, just said that because that&#39;s what was always said to him. So he<br/>
tried what I suggested and quickly found out that the kids didn&#39;t always ask<br/>
the same thing, after one or 2 times, they remembered it on their own. He<br/>
was impressed. &lt;beg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If someone always made me try to figure things out like that everytime I<br/>
asked, I think I would probably just stop asking and muddle my way through<br/>
it on my own.<br/>

<br/>
We really do  deeply appreciate seeing the elk come in..We dont see them all of the time-the snow is very deep this year compared to the last few years..<br/>
I always feel  a sense  of  amazement and excitement when they come in close like this. The wildlife in our area is of constant  interest to us-not something we take for granted. The elk however have caused some of our neighbours huge costs in feed. Most farmers leave any  rain ruined hay in the field for them.  The little  hay  they get from around  our pony is very minor now that we have adjusted our feeding schedule. She is a little 32 year old welsh mare and they  are three times her size. They are actually very welcome, I just feel a little uneasy because of her size and age.<br/>
Years ago they were  much wilder as they were hunted quite heavily in our area and their were huge tracts of heavy timber all around us. 35 years ago my husband and I tried to follow  the trail of some  through heavy fir timber right next to oour fence on horseback and I had to basically kneel on the saddle  as they were able to thread their horse size bodies and huge racks  thru amazingly heavy going.They are not in any sense tame but are quite capable of assessing danger and as long as you follow your regular paths and routine they only move off slowly-if you stare directly at them for any length of time they  move off quickly.  It is very exciting to walk on old logging  roads  and suddenly see  a group of them cross in front of you. They move so quietly you really dont see anything.<br/>
 The girls take them for granted in a way,  but are always thrilled if  they see the young deer  up close on the driveway or front field  when they go picking wild strawberries. <br/>
We have a number of bird feeders  by the house but the squirrels seldom come up to them-they are usually &quot;hibernating&quot; <br/>
(they dont really) they  just  burrow in and  &quot;sleep&quot; in this weather and come out when it warms up and raid their cone caches which  are out in the field or bush a bit. They are fun to watch but the cats can be hard on them so they are smart to stay away. Luckily for us,  the squirrels and the  Canada geese  are not  nuisances  around here  like they are in some  areas.<br/>

My 7-year old son<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is interested in learning how to read (and wants my help), <br/>
 </span></blockquote>FWIW -- when my DD asked for a structured way to learn to read, she and I <br/>
went online and selected the &quot;100 Easy Lessons&quot; book. We did about the middle <br/>
third of it -- the beginning was stuff she already knew and by the time we did <br/>
the middle, she was on to books. Now, at 9, she reads up a storm. I think she <br/>
was 6 when this &quot;I need to learn how to read NOW&quot; period took place. OTOH, DS <br/>
was born reading I think :) -- which is why it never occurred to me to &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
DD much in the way of &quot;how to read&quot; -- until she figured out she needed more. <br/>
Probably best all around. :)<br/>

Now that all my kids can read, they ask me for spellings.  If someone yells <br/>
out &quot;How do you spell &#39;straighten&#39;?&quot; I&#39;m just going to spell it.<br/>

Which happens a lot in some of the computer games the kids play -- NeoPets is <br/>
one  -- they both seem to be learning and having fun -- and they have lots of <br/>
NeoPoints! :)<br/>
