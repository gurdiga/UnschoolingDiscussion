<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892020975">**The book we picked out was recommended by  a professor.  I don&#39;t remember<br/>
what the name of it was but it is about misconceptions of what psychology is<br/>
all about and what terms actually mean vs. what the general public thinks<br/>
they mean.  Kind of a psychology &quot;un&quot; labeling book.  Does that make sense?**<br/>
<br/>
Lynda, I know that I (and probably a lot of other folks here) would be very <br/>
interested in reading the book you&#39;ve described here. I&#39;d be enormously <br/>
grateful if you could post the name and author.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
