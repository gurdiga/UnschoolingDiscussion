EEEK!<br/>
<br/>
A homeschooling family here (not unschoolers, and I lost contact after a few <br/>
years of them hanging out with my kids) had two &quot;little Russians&quot; and their <br/>
&quot;little Korean.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
YUCK!  Horrible.  Like a Barbie collection.  &quot;My Malibu Barbie.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
But with Barbies, y&#39;know, they&#39;re all named &quot;Barbie.&quot;   And humans tend to <br/>
have individual real names and I think parents should use them.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I call Marty &quot;my mid kid&quot; but that&#39;s just because it&#39;s poetic and <br/>
when I do that I&#39;m about to talk about middle children&#39;s situations.    <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know.  Maybe I&#39;m not qualified to comment because I have three <br/>
bio-kids and none adopted, but I just wish adoptive parents wouldn&#39;t do that.   <br/>
There&#39;s another family lately similar and I don&#39;t want to say more because I hope <br/>
she&#39;ll come join this list.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, though, I had a kind of opposite situation where a new-to-homeschooling <br/>
mom did NOT mention that her son was adopted and so she had not a speck of <br/>
genetic similarity and when I met him I could see clearly (as anyone else could <br/>
see clearly from 100 paces) that he was adopted, and he wasn&#39;t too thrilled <br/>
about it either.  Fifteen year old, dressing and acting like a gang member, had <br/>
NO discernable social or emotional connection with his mom, and she hadn&#39;t <br/>
thought to mention that when she wasted an hour and a half of my phone and e-mail <br/>
time batting away every suggestion I made.<br/>
<br/>
Not that she should have said &quot;my orphaned hispanic kid&quot; but in her case it <br/>
made a difference.   She was uptight yankee intellectual and he is quite <br/>
different and could not&#39;ve been poured into her mold in any way.   <br/>
<br/>
Sociology professor, and none of that had seemed to occur to her?<br/>
He&#39;s 15, though, and practically a man.   Too late for her to create a <br/>
relationship with him.  His relationship is with the other special ed kids at <br/>
school, and those who prey on them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he was treated as a human other than the one he is.  I don&#39;t know.  <br/>
It&#39;s sad.  It&#39;s hard.<br/>
<br/>
I bought Parent/Teen Breakthrough: The Relationship Approach, which Pam <br/>
Sorooshian has recommended before.  I haven&#39;t read all of it, but what I have read <br/>
is a lot like things people say here about BEING with your kid and treating <br/>
them as you would treat another adult.   The advantage is it&#39;s really published, <br/>
not by unschoolers, and not just on a webpage.  One of the authors has a PhD, <br/>
so maybe it will help some families accept it.<br/>
<br/>
Treating kids &quot;like kids&quot; in the traditional way seems damaging all by <br/>
itself.  If they&#39;re discounted and shunted aside and told to hush and told to wait, <br/>
it builds up and can&#39;t be undone. And I can&#39;t help but think &quot;my biracial <br/>
adopted child&quot; and &quot;my little Russian&quot; might feel a degree of lack of acceptance <br/>
as a person after being designated in that separated way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-661625985">As a mom (via adoption) I feel the need to chime in on this one....   <br/>
I don&#39;t generally refer to my kids as my  &quot;adopted kid(s)&quot; - Although in some arenas it is the norm in order to discuss challenges/issues brought on by abuses during the pregnancy or after birth - and not be accused of these atrocities.  You&#39;d be surprised at what people will say to you when they recognize yr child as having a challenge that is caused by say - alcohol abuse during pregnancy!<br/>
<br/>
I have encountered in public places - (oddly seems bathrooms at the zoo and mall are a fav spot for people to do this) - people saying to me of my girls - &quot;Oh - they&#39;re adopted aren&#39;t they?&quot; Not always in a nice tone!  Once in a blue moon it is followed up by a positive comment - like &quot;Oh you&#39;re so blessed.&quot; or  questions as to the infertility issues or the  &quot;how&#39;s&quot;  of adoption.  The latter of which all 4 of my kids are more than happy to tell them about {G}.  I think that we personally draw particular attention since my dd&#39;s are identical triplets - but that&#39;s different can of worms.<br/>
<br/>
When used as a regular identifier of a child (esp. in front of the child)- perhaps in place of their name - it is a sure sign of a maladjusted or troubled parent/grandparent (which is a definite negative for the child).  I do find it to be more common (in public) in people who have kids with significant behavior issues or some type of physical challenge - as if to say - &quot;this isn&#39;t my fault&quot; -  unfairly foisting the &quot;problem&quot; on the child.  <br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

do that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had that feeling too, while listening to her.  My kids are all <br/>
biological.  Maybe this is normal practice among adopters???<br/>
I told my cousins wife a few weeks later about it.  She said that <br/>
was really weird/disturbing.  They adopted their first child after <br/>
years of infertility.  Of coarse, a couple of months after the <br/>
adoption, she got pregnant with their son. <br/>
She never makes a distinction and said she rarely evens thinks about <br/>
it.  Her dd knows she&#39;s adopted, but it&#39;s not in her intro.<br/>
She laughed about the biracial part.  She said, &quot;didn&#39;t you know <br/>
Sage is our biracial adopted daughter?&quot;  I looked at her perplexed.  <br/>
This child looks as white as it gets.  They had specifically asked <br/>
for a biracial child when looking to adopt.   The  birth mother told <br/>
them the father was black.  They were there for the birth and when <br/>
she came out, they were a little confused but thought she would <br/>
develope more features of her father as she got older.<br/>
At her first ped. appointment she mentioned her biracialness to the <br/>
dr.  She said he laughed, and told her he really doubted this child <br/>
was biracial.  It doesn&#39;t make any real difference, but it was funny <br/>
how the stories connected.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; I couldn&#39;t help myself but to laugh outloud.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely.  It&#39;s funny!  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;As for the children who speak out, they&#39;re only repeating stuff <br/>
they hear at home.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not necessarily.<br/>
My son Jack always notices differences.  When he was younger (2-4) <br/>
it was color, or size of people, mostly.  He would come up and ask <br/>
them questions or ask me questions.  He talks to anyone he can to <br/>
find out whatever &quot;why&quot; he has in his head.  He&#39;s 7 now.<br/>
Color and size no longer intrigue him.  If he sees a handicapped <br/>
person or someone doing something he hasn&#39;t seen before, he asks <br/>
lots of questions usually to the person, if they aren&#39;t available, <br/>
I&#39;m his second source. <br/>
We have never had a negative experience with his curiosity.  <br/>
I find kids to be refreshing.  When my son Sam died, adults were at <br/>
a loss for words, uncomfortable around us.  Kids said things to me <br/>
that adults would never say.<br/>
One little girls asked all kinds of questions about what we were <br/>
going to do with his stuff and his room.  Another boy, who had <br/>
played with Sam at a family camp we go to said he wanted to come to <br/>
our house.  I said &quot;sure, next time you come to our town.&quot;  He <br/>
said, &quot;I wish I could have come when Sam was there&quot;.  I said, &quot;me <br/>
too&quot;.  Another mom, who was standing there, thought I was going to <br/>
be upset.  I wasn&#39;t at all. <br/>
I find kids to be so honest that I feel more honest with my feeling <br/>
around them.<br/>
The other day, we were  at an indoor pool with some other families. <br/>
One of the boys, as I was walking by him, said, &quot;So how&#39;s Sam doing?&quot;<br/>
I looked at him with suprise, then when I saw the honest interest on <br/>
his face and remembered he had just been to his grave a few days <br/>
before (I found a picture he had drawn for him there) I said, &quot; I<br/>
think he&#39;s doing pretty well.&quot;  His poor mother looked mortified.<br/>
Anyway, my point is, kids are just honest.   They are curious.  They <br/>
see beyond the proper way to do things and get their information <br/>
without fear.  <br/>
It&#39;s a good trait.<br/>

Yes, it&#39;s tactless to ask at the time, but they&#39;re kids. Should they not <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I got the impression the original poster didnt mean so much what the <br/>
kids were learning at home, but rather what they were NOT learning. <br/>
If a child lives in a really integrated area, and/or is familiar with <br/>
families of &quot;nontraditional&quot; makeup, they would probably be less <br/>
likely to wonder how a black kid and a white kid could both come from <br/>
the same mother. Just like a kid who has regular contact with, say, <br/>
gay people, would be less likely to say &quot;mom, why are those two men <br/>
holding hands??&quot; Or a kid who has lots of homeschooled friends might <br/>
be less likely to say &quot;whaddya mean you don&#39;t go to school?? How do <br/>
you LEARN??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My 9 yo niece was shocked when my son told her everyone in his <br/>
(former)class was black, except for him. She asked &quot;EVEN the <br/>
teacher?? But i mean, your teacher was white right?&quot; Nope. She didnt <br/>
think having a black teacher was bad or wrong, she just couldnt wrap <br/>
her mind around it. <br/>
<br/>
My son has had tons of contact/interaction with people who have <br/>
varying degrees of disability, both mental and physical, due to my <br/>
former job.  Now that he is 7yo, he wouldnt dream of asking a <br/>
question about a wheelchair, or &quot;why does that person talk funny&quot;, <br/>
because he knows the answer. I&#39;ve always been really upfront and <br/>
honest about what mental retardation is, the different causes, what <br/>
traumatic brain injury is, what schizophrenia is. A child that had <br/>
never met or really got to know a person who is disabled would <br/>
obviously have alot more questions/curiosity about it. <br/>
<br/>
I think most people would be happy to answer a child&#39;s honest <br/>
question about *whatever* (adoption, disability, etc)...the problem i <br/>
think occurs when the other parent tries to &quot;shush&quot; the child, or <br/>
drags the child away, as if the thing the child is curious about is <br/>
something shameful. My child had made a comment about something once, <br/>
i think it might have been a hook or something, some kind of prothesis<br/>
(sp??)that he&#39;d never seen IRL before, and i just matter of factly <br/>
said in a normal tone of voice what it was for. <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t adopted but its been a lifelong plan of mine...i really <br/>
hope to adopt a boy between 5-10 sometime in the next couple of <br/>
years. Anyhow, i wonder if part of the comments parents make about <br/>
their &quot;Korean&quot; child or &quot;biracial&quot; child isnt a misguided attempt to <br/>
&quot;recognize their child&#39;s heritage&quot; and not just pretend the child is <br/>
white like everyone else in the family. Years ago there used to be <br/>
this belief that &quot;color doesnt matter&quot; or that &quot;love is color blind&quot; <br/>
and that there were no additional issues when a child of color is <br/>
added to a family of another race. Now the emphasis is on really <br/>
recognizing and celebrating that difference.Thats not saying its good <br/>
to define a child by their ethnicity, or adoption status. And the <br/>
homestudy/adoption process is supposed to teach parents how to handle <br/>
these situations. But unfortunately there are probably some adoptive <br/>
parents out there who pride themselves in taking in a &quot;poor <br/>
biracial child&quot; or &quot;poor third world orphan.&quot; I think there are <br/>
appropriately places to identify adopted children, country of origin <br/>
etc (such as in adoption forums)but in most settings its probably <br/>
irrelevant. Kind of like how if you are posting on a special needs <br/>
forum you might say &quot;mom of 5 year old autistic son&quot; but wouldnt <br/>
introduce him to the bank teller by saying &quot;this is my autistic son.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;I don&#39;t know. Maybe I&#39;m not qualified to comment because I have<br/>
&gt; three<br/>
&gt; bio-kids and none adopted, but I just wish adoptive parents wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; do that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had that feeling too, while listening to her.  My kids are all<br/>
&gt; biological.  Maybe this is normal practice among adopters???<br/>
&gt; I told my cousins wife a few weeks later about it.  She said that<br/>
&gt; was really weird/disturbing.  They adopted their first child after<br/>
&gt; years of infertility.  Of coarse, a couple of months after the<br/>
&gt; adoption, she got pregnant with their son.<br/>
&gt; She never makes a distinction and said she rarely evens thinks about<br/>
&gt; it.  Her dd knows she&#39;s adopted, but it&#39;s not in her intro.<br/>
&gt; She laughed about the biracial part.  She said, &quot;didn&#39;t you know<br/>
&gt; Sage is our biracial adopted daughter?&quot;  I looked at her perplexed.<br/>
&gt; This child looks as white as it gets.  They had specifically asked<br/>
&gt; for a biracial child when looking to adopt.   The  birth mother told<br/>
&gt; them the father was black.  They were there for the birth and when<br/>
&gt; she came out, they were a little confused but thought she would<br/>
&gt; develope more features of her father as she got older.<br/>
&gt; At her first ped. appointment she mentioned her biracialness to the<br/>
&gt; dr.  She said he laughed, and told her he really doubted this child<br/>
&gt; was biracial.  It doesn&#39;t make any real difference, but it was funny<br/>
&gt; how the stories connected.<br/>

&gt;   You&#39;d be surprised at what people will say to you when they recognize yr<br/>
child as having a challenge that is caused by say - alcohol abuse during<br/>
pregnancy!<br/>
&gt; . . . yeh, I&#39;ve been there, too!  Many folks speak before thinking . . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have encountered in public places - (oddly seems bathrooms at the zoo<br/>
and mall are a fav spot for people to do this) - people saying to me of my<br/>
girls - &quot;Oh - they&#39;re adopted aren&#39;t they?&quot; Not always in a nice tone!<br/>
&gt;  . . .  you&#39;re right about bathrooms; when my two children were smaller,<br/>
frequently, in the bathroom of some public place or fast food restauraunt, I<br/>
would hear a little voice from outside of the stall-- &#39;Mommy, why does that<br/>
lady have two different color children?&#39;  And even in grocery store, and<br/>
elderly women (pushed in a wheel chair by daughter) &#39;why--they&#39;re different<br/>
colors!&#39; (the mothers usually hush them and leave quickly, and the daughter<br/>
pushing the wheelchair said, &quot;WHY YES MOTHER! THOSE PLUMS ARE ALL DIFFERENT<br/>
COLORS!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I couldn&#39;t help myself but to laugh outloud.  As for the children who<br/>
speak out, they&#39;re only repeating stuff they hear at home.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I dont intro. my kids as &#39;my adopted children.&#39;  Once on TV I heard Connie<br/>
Chung talking about her &#39;adopted child&#39; and was interviewing a man who was<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I understand not wanting to put your children&#39;s lives out in public.....but<br/>
adopted is different than biological.  You are dealing with very different<br/>
genetics, with a child&#39;s feelings for a parent that didn&#39;t choose to raise<br/>
them or for a parent that treated them so poorly the state took them away.<br/>
You have to be ready to deal with the moment when your child is angry and<br/>
says they wished they lived with their birthparents.  Adoption comes with a<br/>
lot of baggage.....good baggage and difficult baggage but sometimes a heavy<br/>
load for a little kid nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
I might tell a reporter that ALL my kids came to me in different<br/>
ways....vaginal, cesaerean, adoption, etc...  But I wouldn&#39;t want to say<br/>
that how each of them came to me wasn&#39;t special and something to be<br/>
remembered.  My kids love to talk about the day I met them and things they<br/>
do that are just like their birthparents.<br/>

Just my thoughts.<br/>

frequently, in the bathroom of some public place or fast food restauraunt, I<br/>
would hear a little voice from outside of the stall-- &#39;Mommy, why does that<br/>
lady have two different color children?&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; . . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;As for the children who speak out, they&#39;re only repeating stuff they hear<br/>
at home.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too.  I don&#39;t think so though.  I asked her to watch Jack while I <br/>
took Jamie to the bathroom.  Jamie finished and ran back to the pool <br/>
before I was finished.  I assumed they would see her and also <br/>
assumed she couldn&#39;t get over the 1/2 wall around the pool. (she <br/>
couldn&#39;t when she had her water wings on) But, I had a nagging <br/>
feeling to hurry up  back to the pool.  I got there and asked where <br/>
Jamie was and looked at the pool at the same time.<br/>
There she was, just under the water near the steps with a panic in <br/>
her eyes.  I jumped the wall and jumped into the pool and got her.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know how long she was there.  She was fine though.  She had <br/>
had water wings on before the bathroom and that classic thing <br/>
happened.  She forgot she didn&#39;t have them on and went right in and <br/>
off the steps.  There were about 8 kids in the pool and seeing one <br/>
under wouldn&#39;t stand out right away unless you knew they were in <br/>
there and were keeping an eye on them.  She had walked right by this <br/>
mom and she didn&#39;t notice her.  I couldn&#39;t do anything but hold her, <br/>
standing in the pool, fully dressed for quite a while, then I got <br/>
out and sat there hugging her for even longer.  The other moms I was <br/>
with were waiting for me to freak out.  Other than shaking a lot I <br/>
was fine.  I know this mom felt horrible.  She wasn&#39;t responsible <br/>
for Jamie, but since she was suppose to be watching Jack (and her <br/>
own kids) you think she would have noticed.<br/>
So, she probably harangued herself ;-)<br/>

  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with kids commenting on different skin colors, it&#39;s nothing to do with prejudice, just childhood curiosity... many years ago I had a child ask me why my kids had different colored hair, my daughter had straight` hair  so blonde that it was almost white while her big brother had dark ringlets.    Why would it be any worse for a child to comment on different skin colors than different hair colors?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I agree. I think it&#39;s definately prefferable to stares or such. My daughter used to love wheelchairs and always had a comment about them when she saw someone in one. No one was ever offended. <br/>
    One funny encounter though...An encounter no two adults could have had...We were walking through a dollar store and a girl about my daughter&#39;s age saw Catherine and the eye patch she wears and as she walked by she asked, &quot;Why are you wearing that patch?&quot; Catherine just shrugged and said, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s so my eye will heal.&quot; And that was it. They were both satisfied, neither was offended and they both went on their way. Can you imagine how awkward two adults would have felt?<br/>
