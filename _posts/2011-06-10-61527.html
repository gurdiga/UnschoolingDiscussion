<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517789607">This is item #3 of 13, of a list Pam Sorooshian wrote.  It seems to answer some of the recent questions here.  <br/>
<br/>
*********<br/>
Bring the world to your children and your children to the world. Revel in what brings you together as a family. Watch tv and movies and listen to music and the radio. Laugh together, cry together, be shocked together. Analyze and critique and think together about what you experience. Notice what your child loves and offer more of it, not less. What IS it about particular shows that engage your child�build on that. Don&#39;t operate out of fear. Think for yourself and about your own real child. Don&#39;t be swayed by pseudostudies done on school children.<br/>

<br/>
The rest of the list is great, too: <br/>
