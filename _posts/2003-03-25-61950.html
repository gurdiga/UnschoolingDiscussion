<br/>
What is your job that is made harder by having tv in your home?  &quot;Little zombies&quot; is a pretty disrespectful term.  I think what you mean is they are interested and absorbed.  I don&#39;t watch much tv, but I do spend a fair amount of time on the computer, and if the conversation is good I might appear totally absorbed in the screen.  I&#39;d be highly offended if my husband got rid of my computer and then announced that he had to do it because it turned his wife into a &quot;little zombie.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Would you feel the same way if you had a child who loved to read and got so absorbed in his/her book that you couldn&#39;t get his/her attention easily?  Would you feel that you had to get rid of all reading material so their attention was always easily gotten?  <br/>

<br/>
Yesterday my children had some friends over and they were playing Manhunt outside.  My three year old wanted to join them, which meant that I needed to go out also to monitor him near the street.  After dinner they wanted to go right back out and I actually *pleaded* with them to please watch tv or a movie or play one of the video games that I had just rented for them at blockbuster.  <br/>
Nope.  They wanted to play outside.<br/>

If tv and video games were hoarded and doled out sparingly or otherwise treated like a big deal- or if they were absent and forbidden altogether- they&#39;d have much more power over my kids than they do right now.<br/>

I am in was asking about TV.  I had said that I don&#39;t restrict it.  The usual <br/>
comment: &quot;my children would sit all day and do nothing but watch TV&quot;.  I try <br/>
to explain that at first they might, if it has been restricted.  But if they <br/>
have total freedom and no threat that it will be taken away they will move <br/>
away from it and it will be another tool in your house.  <br/>
<br/>
They so don&#39;t get it.  The come back is always &quot;but I know my children and <br/>
they would not move away from it.&quot;  There seems to be no way to help them to <br/>
see things a little different.  But maybe they really weren&#39;t interested in <br/>
the topic to begin with.  Some people are so sure they are right.  And how do <br/>
you counter when they say &quot;I know my children.&quot;  They are right there.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know their children.  I can say I have seen mother&#39;s that have said the <br/>
same thing until they tried it.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess some people don&#39;t get it and I am not the kind of person to preach <br/>

<br/>
Oh, I&#39;ve had that happen too!!!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t bribe them with the offer of the rental of anything they want <br/>
sometimes.  They want me to take them somewhere, or they want to walk up to <br/>
the park with their friends.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t bribe them with food or candy, either, since they&#39;ve always had it <br/>
when they wanted it and so it&#39;s nothing valuable.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried and failed on numerous occasions to talk a kid into wanting to <br/>
eat out with me, when we were out shopping and *I* wanted to go to a <br/>
restaurant.  Both Marty and Holly tend to say &quot;That&#39;s too expensive.  Let&#39;s <br/>
just go home and eat.&quot;<br/>

I never knew those would be the side effects of freedom, that they would <br/>

<br/>
  Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. There are times when the kids are watching tv and I call them from right there, and there is no response. They aren&#39;t tuning me out, they are just really tuned into what they are watching. And it could be Pokemon, The Wiggles, or something on Animal Planet. Does that mean it&#39;s worthless because they are intested in it? Sometimes they do the exact same thing when they are reading a book, drawing, playing a game or just having a conversation with each other. I don&#39;t see where they are zombies just because they are interested and don&#39;t respond right away when I call them or ask a question. Maybe that&#39;s the real problem. Not responding to a parent when a parent &quot;thinks&quot; the child should be.<br/>

Yep. I have seen the transformation first hand here.<br/>
Nowadays, my kids get frustrated with their ps friend that ONLY wants to play <br/>
video games when he comes over. They beg him to go outside or play legos, but <br/>
he refuses. <br/>
Poor kid knows I&#39;m not going to stop him and he&#39;s very limited at home due to <br/>
school, homework etc....<br/>
It&#39;s so sad to see the obsessive way he guards his time on it. My kids <br/>
complain that &quot;Trey never wants to do ANYTHING but video games when he comes <br/>
over Mom&quot;<br/>
:)<br/>
Today will be a video game marathon though. They just got three new games, so <br/>
I won&#39;t hear much about wanting to go outside today I think!<br/>

It makes me think of watching someone do a jigsaw puzzle and most of it is fitting together beautifully, but the last piece is turned upside down.

My sister (long ago, when she was not thinking very  much) said she would not <br/>
ever buy her kids a video game because everytime they went where there was <br/>
one the kids fought over who got to play.<br/>
<br/>
I listened to see if there was anything more profound coming (it was by <br/>

Trevor knew exactly what time our local store would have his reserved copy <br/>
in. <br/>
At 10:30 he started bugging me to get ready! We traded in three games and <br/>
they gave him an extra $10 credit, which we used towards a game for his <br/>
brother.<br/>
If you look at the budgeting, consumer, math skills used just on the <br/>
purchasing aspect of video games, it&#39;s pretty amazing.<br/>
And Trevor let Jared use the rest of the credit to buy a game, something he <br/>
might not be so generous about if I wasn&#39;t being generous to him.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote> I SO know what you mean about people not getting it.<br/>
Even the few unschoolers I personally know live a grand unschooling life<br/>
*except* for the whole tv issue. That and playing unrestricted games on<br/>
computers or game systems. And it doesn&#39;t matter when I explain &quot;NO, my kids<br/>
really DON&#39;T watch TV *all day* if it&#39;s unrestricted (or play games). They<br/>
are still so sure that their kids would do just that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only when I listened to the advice at unschooling.com and completely<br/>
let go of restrictions that I found out for myself how kids do regulate<br/>
themselves when tv is unrestricted. It&#39;s simply amazing that it works so<br/>
well! If only more unschoolers were open to getting a crash course in<br/>
de-tv-viewing either here or at unschooling.com!<br/>
<br/>
I think most people have been so brainwashed about tv viewing habits. It&#39;s<br/>
all you hear every day about how tv is so evil and bad. They don&#39;t realize<br/>
that they&#39;re just as brainwashed as their kids supposedly are from watching<br/>
tv! And that restricting viewing or playing to *certain* hours per day or<br/>
week just glorifies the restricted item. It&#39;s funny how that backfires on<br/>
people that way!<br/>
<br/>

back down. They don&#39;t like to admit that *you* may know how to parent<br/>
*their* kids better than they do.<br/>
<br/>
When the conversation gets like that, I just back down and don&#39;t talk about<br/>
it anymore. I think that I got my point across and even though they won&#39;t<br/>
admit it, they probably do think about it further later on and maybe it does<br/>
impress some people to give unrestricted tv viewing a try. At least you<br/>
planted a seed - it may or may not grow.<br/>

<br/>
We have no time limit, so whe someone&#39;s on they can stay on as long as they <br/>

e-mail, and let the person back on who&#39;s playing a long game (Marty) or <br/>
reading unschooling.com (me).<br/>
<br/>
With TV, what I would do is have kids declare their favorite or most <br/>
important shows, and unless there&#39;s a conflict, make sure those get watched <br/>
or recorded.  If you have a VCR, maybe you can record one and watch another.  <br/>
That&#39;s what we used to do when kids were little and we only had one TV.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had three TVs given to us over the years since we had kids, and have <br/>
bought two.  Three, because Keith bought one when he was working in <br/>
Minneapolis.  At the moment we have five working TVs, and the Mac plays DVDs. <br/>
  But we didn&#39;t buy five TVs.  And our biggish main TV was bought used form <br/>
someone Keith worked with here who was moving.  <br/>
<br/>
If two kids choose the same show I wouldn&#39;t &quot;count&quot; that one as either <br/>
person&#39;s &quot;pick,&quot; if it gets so tight there that you&#39;re having to say no to <br/>
someone and they&#39;re counting the times.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  On the one hand, we as parents DO know our<br/>
<br/>
children better than anyone else.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know some parents who hardly know their children at all, whatsoever.  They <br/>
don&#39;t know their friends&#39; names.  They don&#39;t know anything personal about <br/>
them.  They tell them to do their homework and go to bed.  They tell them <br/>
&quot;Get up and eat and get in the car.&quot;  Conversations otherwise are minimal.   <br/>
The kids are at school, at babysitters&#39;, at summer programs sponsored by the <br/>
city, eating free lunch in the park in the summer...<br/>
<br/>
It sounds good when people say &quot;I know my children better than anyone&quot; but <br/>
it&#39;s not always true.<br/>
<br/>
My fourth grade teacher knew things about me my mother couldn&#39;t have <br/>
comprehended.  She gave me books for Christmas.  The Christmas draw was <br/>
fixed, no doubt, so she could give me two science books with pictures for <br/>
Christmas.  My mom gave me a stuffed monkey holding a banana and a diary.  I <br/>
would have rather had books, but my mom didn&#39;t know and didn&#39;t much care.  <br/>
She gave the same stuffed monkey to my sister and my two cousins.  Four <br/>
matching monkeys.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269954470">----- snip----- &gt; It&#39;s so funny to watch my grown friends who don&#39;t have<br/>
TV&#39;s not be able to deal with the fact that we have it on at home.  My one<br/>
just gets mesmerized.  Now, is that TV&#39;s fault, I think not.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marie Winn insists that TV itself is addictive.  But later in her book she<br/>
says that mothers have to entice their young children to watch TV.<br/>
Apparently, very young children somehow sense that TV is not real, so they<br/>
have to be taught how to watch it.  Once the kids are hooked, though, mother<br/>
will not be able to tear their little eyes away from its power.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that comes out in the later chapters is the author&#39;s attitude<br/>
about children.  Basically, they are manipulative little creatures who only<br/>
want to do what is easy and fun.  Modern parents have lost their natural<br/>
authority over children, so we have to resort to bribery to get them to do<br/>
what we want.  Parents in the good old days didn&#39;t have the problems we have<br/>
today, because they (the parents) insisted on regular naptimes.  As children<br/>
grew, this forced naptime became quiet time, because the children had become<br/>
accustomed to staying alone in their rooms whether they wanted to or not.<br/>
They knew that when mother said quiet time, she meant it!  Mothers who<br/>
devoted their children&#39;s preschool years to teaching their children how to<br/>
use scissors and paste (messy, but worth it in the long run!) would have<br/>
children who could make collages while mother had time to get her important<br/>
things done.  Therefore, the children knew how to entertain themselves.<br/>
They didn&#39;t need TV!  Modern parents do not have to work at parenting,<br/>
because we rely on TV to keep our children busy and out of our way.<br/>
<br/>
I am not kidding!  I have summarized, but the tone is the same as the<br/>
book&#39;s.  It just keeps getting more and more absurd and disgusting.<br/>

Apparently, very young children somehow sense that TV is not real, so they<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s very strange.<br/>
Especially if she thinks it&#39;s addictive, why would a mother &quot;entice&quot; them any <br/>
more than she would get them training-cocaine or blow cigarette smoke into <br/>
their noses?  <br/>
<br/>
But the idea that children wouldn&#39;t look at moving pictures with music and <br/>
funny voices makes me think maybe the woman is from another planet, or very <br/>
old.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I watched a DVD of old Howdy Doody shows.  The production level was <br/>
really low.  The most interesting parts were the commercials for those new <br/>
products, Twinkies and Hostess Snowballs.  Because they were black and white <br/>
and didn&#39;t look very appetizing, the verbal descriptions were really <br/>
detailed.  At the end of one episode they talked about telling your parents <br/>
you want to go to Sunday School and church, or the place of worship of your <br/>
choice.  And at the end of another one they said kids should take a paper bag <br/>
in the &quot;automobile&quot; so that instead of throwing trash out the windows, people <br/>
could put it in the bag!!<br/>
<br/>
Holly loved that part. <br/>
<br/>
I have told the kids people used to just throw trash out of cars, and they <br/>
kinda believed me, but couldn&#39;t really grasp it as common.  Maybe they <br/>
thought I just had a trashy family.<br/>
<br/>
So when Howdy Doody was the best thing for kids and there were only three <br/>
channels (if that) and some of today&#39;s childhood development people were in <br/>
college, TV was probably not worth defending.   <br/>
<br/>
The context now is altogether different.  Videos and DVDs change everything.<br/>

  &lt;&lt;With TV, what I would do is have kids declare their favorite or most <br/>
  important shows, and unless there&#39;s a conflict, make sure those get watched <br/>
  or recorded.  If you have a VCR, maybe you can record one and watch another.  <br/>
  That&#39;s what we used to do when kids were little and we only had one TV.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I agree with Sandra. If the kids each have favorites, try to find a way, hopefully that they both can watch them. We have 4 tv&#39;s here and still the kids occasionally have a squabble over the tv. Mostly because they all like to watch in the playroom. With me though, I just try and send one somewhere else to watch. Once in awhile, one child will go into the playroom to watch tv and one other one will follow just because. Then that 2nd person wants control over the remote. I make sure that the first person to go in to specifically watch tv is the one that gets the remote. Seems only fair because it was their idea first. We don&#39;t have time limits either as no one child here really has a favorite show that they can&#39;t miss. Generally if Joseph has had enough of Animal Planet, he&#39;ll get up and go play. If we only had one tv and Sierra had been watching for an hour or so, I would try to make a compromise so the other one who isn&#39;t interested can have some time with something different.<br/>
  With the computer, we have 2 hear. One in the library/computer room and one in Joseph&#39;s room. Joseph doesn&#39;t have internet access yet as he hasn&#39;t cleaned his room from all the stuff so Joe can get in there to hook it up!!! Whoever gets on or asks for the computer first has it until they want off. My kids are good as they usually watch the other one and more times than not, the first one on will ask the other if they want a turn to play. The less fuss you make about it, and be matter of fact and show concern for both, the quicker the kids will work out something on their own too.<br/>

it is watched?  I really can&#39;t follow exactly what you are suggesting here.  <br/>
Btw, our VCR can&#39;t record while we watch something else.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, Kelson (3) is constantly being overruled by the other two.  He _never_ <br/>

will let him pick something, but then Alec complains about the &quot;baby&quot; shows.<br/>

to constant whining (Freya) and yelling (Alec) and crying (Kelson).  We just <br/>
got a satellite dish four weeks ago and this has been a problem ever since.  <br/>
We got it in order to have the variety for the kids &quot;schooling&quot; (and I admit, <br/>
to watch the war coverage), but I&#39;m tempted to cancel it!  When we had only <br/>
an arial (sp?) there was nothing on they wanted to watch between 12 and 4!  <br/>
Sigh!  I hope the novelty will wear off soon.<br/>

When they were littler we had just strict rotation.  It&#39;s Kirby&#39;s turn until <br/>
he&#39;s done, whether half an hour or three hours.  Then Marty (or whoever).  <br/>
Then  Holly, who never played more than fifteen or twenty minutes when she <br/>
was little (still, not long).  But whoever had it played until stopping <br/>
voluntarily.<br/>
<br/>
We still do it, it&#39;s just more open to negotiation now than it was then (when <br/>
they didn&#39;t like each other so much).<br/>
<br/>
Holly was on while I was watching 24, but got off on her own.  I&#39;m on for a <br/>
while and Marty&#39;s next.  When he gets on it will probably be until 3:00 a.m.<br/>
<br/>
When I get up I&#39;ll get on uninterrupted for a while in the morning.<br/>

or family who are going to upgrade and could give you their old one? maybe put the word<br/>
out that you are in the market for a good deal...you never know what might show up!<br/>
<br/>
Dh also just got us a second computer for the kids and me (he has his own consulting <br/>
company and got one they were getting rid of).<br/>

Before all this though we would alternate tv shows (whoever was watching got to finish <br/>
what they were watching and then it was the others turn). As far as computer time, we<br/>
pretty much let whoever was on the computer play until he was done (how can you really<br/>
know how much time is fair?). I would just make a conscious effort to do something with<br/>
the one who was waiting. I would also help them negotiate with each other to come up<br/>
with something that worked. One nice thing that happened was that they quickly realized<br/>
that if they were good about letting the other have a turn, the other would return the favor.<br/>

computer is in there!  How sturdy are those wall-mounted shelves?  Have to <br/>
run it by dh (who _hates_ having the television on longer than for a certain <br/>
program).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, will consider it, for my sanity!<br/>

&lt;&lt; &quot;Mom, my neck is killing me and I&#39;m getting a headache.&quot;  (he gets <br/>
migranes)  <br/>
So I tell him that he needs to get off the computer and let his neck and eyes <br/>
rest.  He just turns around and continues to play another three hours until <br/>
dinner time, gets a migrane, and is miserable all evening!!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Does he need glasses?  <br/>
Or is he at the growing-pains stage, adolescent and having different parts of <br/>
him growing at different rates?   And is it truly migraine or could it <br/>
possibly be protein deprivation?  Can he get a protein snack at the computer <br/>
three hours before dinner?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Of course this <br/>
is the same kid that will refuse to make his own sandwich no matter how <br/>
hungry he is!  I don&#39;t know how he got so (what&#39;s a nice word for stubborn?). <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe it&#39;s not stubborn.  Maybe it&#39;s &quot;engrossed in something he&#39;s learning a <br/>
ton from.&quot;  Maybe he&#39;s doing two things at once, as I always have and still <br/>
do.  I&#39;ll put on a pattern game and be thinking LOTS and hard about something <br/>
in my life.  Yesterday it was the possibility of getting Marty into the <br/>
Junior Police Academy.  I thought it from lots of angles, but needed to be <br/>
doing something else while I was doing it.   I would not have stopped to eat <br/>
until was through processing.  I got two calls from police officers during <br/>
that time.  That was all more important than food to me at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Take him food!  If what he&#39;s doing weren&#39;t important to him, he wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
doing it.<br/>
<br/>
I had a lot of headaches when I was 12 and 13.  In retrospect, I think I <br/>
needed more protein, but I remember my whole body just being wrong, <br/>
uncomfortable, awkward, and foreign.  Joints hurt.  Head and neck hurt, hands <br/>
hurt when I played piano sometimes.  I didn&#39;t need glasses, but sometimes it <br/>
seemed like it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; As far as computer time, we<br/>
<br/>
pretty much let whoever was on the computer play until he was done (how can <br/>
you really<br/>
<br/>
know how much time is fair?). I would just make a conscious effort to do <br/>
something with<br/>
<br/>
the one who was waiting. I would also help them negotiate with each other to <br/>
come up<br/>
<br/>
with something that worked. One nice thing that happened was that they <br/>
quickly realized<br/>
<br/>
that if they were good about letting the other have a turn, the other would <br/>
return the favor.<br/>
<br/>
My boys are 6 and 3... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All true here too.  I forgot to mention the appeasement of the one whose turn <br/>
it wasn&#39;t. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;ve had that tradition of turns since the kids were that young.  If <br/>
they&#39;re not being rushed, there&#39;s no desperation, and no incentive to play <br/>
longer than they really want to.<br/>
