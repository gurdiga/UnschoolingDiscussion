<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810908258">My sons are growing and we are in need of some more cloth diapers!  I&#39;m <br/>
looking preferably for organic, but unbleached or naturally dyed 100% cotton <br/>
or hemp will work as well.  The boys are 35-40 pounds...one skinny the other <br/>
chunky.  I&#39;d like pinnable or snaps, but will consider aplix closures if <br/>
it&#39;s a great diaper.  Chinese prefolds would be great, too! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you have any wool covers, especially Aristocrats, to fit the boys <br/>
or Chloe (16 pounds), I&#39;d love to get my hands on a few of those as well.<br/>
<br/>
Please email me offlist if you have anything in good+ condition...light <br/>
stains are ok but no rips, holes, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
