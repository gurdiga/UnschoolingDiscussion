<div id="ygrps-yiv-73539470">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
An article here about the current proposal before the Japanese government <br/>
on compulsory community service in Japanese schools. This was written by <br/>
a staff writer of the Asahi Shimbun newspaper and translated into English <br/>
for today&#39;s edition of the Asahi Evening News.<br/>
<br/>
All too rare these days are the news articles that ask young people <br/>
themselves what they think about forced volunteering and other issues <br/>
that directly affect them. This story helps to bridge that gap in its own <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>

WILL COMPULSION ENHANCE STUDENTS&#39; COMMUNITY SPIRIT?<br/>
<br/>
The official proposal to put &#39;service activities&#39; on the school <br/>
curriculum is lauded by some -- but decried by many.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By KYOKO FUJIU<br/>
<br/>
The National Commission on Educational Reform, an advisory body to the <br/>
prime minister, has proposed making &quot;service activities&quot; compulsory for <br/>
school students, and the government has indicated its intention to <br/>
introduce a bill in the Diet next year containing a provision for <br/>
compulsory community service.<br/>
<br/>
However, opposition to the idea remains strong, and revolves around two <br/>
main questions. The first is whether there is anything wrong with <br/>
including an element of compulsion in activities that have generally been <br/>
the preserve of volunteers, and where the spontaneity of willing <br/>
involvement is highly valued. The second is whether it is necessary to <br/>
instill a sense of community spirit in everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Asahi Shimbun asked a number of young volunteer workers around Tokyo for <br/>
their views, and the response was overwhelmingly -- but not exclusively <br/>
-- that compulsion would take the true meaning out of community service.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly all the 10 Tokyo high school students interviewed, who were <br/>
currently engaged in volunteer work, objected strongly to the way adults <br/>
talk about &quot;service activities.&quot; Their responses included: &quot;Stuffy and <br/>
old-fashioned&quot; and &quot;Weird -- it would be like homework.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kanako Inoue of the municipal Oyama High School hadn&#39;t been working as a <br/>
volunteer for very long. A fashionable young woman wearing a silver chain <br/>
around her neck, she was adamant that true service requires commitment.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I do it because I&#39;m interested. I continue because I enjoy it,&quot; she said.<br/>
<br/>
But she has had some surprises, too. One day when she was collecting <br/>
donations, for example, she said a young man with bleached, golden-brown <br/>
hair told her, &quot;Keep up the good work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Modestly, though, Inoue said, &quot;It&#39;s nothing special, nothing particularly <br/>
worthy. I&#39;m just doing what I can. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something you can <br/>
make obligatory.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mariko Suzuki, who attends the private Tokyo Jogakkan High School, is <br/>
also against compulsion. She has been volunteering at a retirement home <br/>
since she was in junior high school. She keeps the elderly residents <br/>
company and helps with the preparation of meals. Some of the residents <br/>
receive no visits from their families, and some are bedridden. Helping <br/>
out at the home has made Mariko think about things she would never have <br/>
dreamed of in the ordinary course of life.<br/>
<br/>
Something to give<br/>
<br/>
In particular, she said she will never forget the time she spent with one <br/>
elderly lady who always said, &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You become a volunteer because you have something to give to others. If <br/>
they make (community service) compulsory, that side of it will be <br/>
weakened,&quot; she said, adding, &quot;That&#39;s the last thing we need.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ryoji Takano, from the municipal Minami Tama High School, expressed <br/>
irritation at the suggestion by some adults that making young people do <br/>
community service would be some kind of solution to youth crime and other <br/>
problems affecting Japanese youth.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Our generation don&#39;t exactly stand up for ourselves, do we? If we&#39;re <br/>
going to be graded on it for internal assessments, everyone will <br/>
volunteer, especially those goody-two-shoes, hypocritical, A-grade <br/>
students who are always worried what the people in charge are thinking of <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If it&#39;s made compulsory, I&#39;m afraid the tendency will only get <br/>
stronger,&quot; he warned.<br/>
<br/>
However, a small minority of the students interviewed thought it wasn&#39;t <br/>
such a bad idea to make community service compulsory.<br/>
<br/>
Nobuyuki Ome, an 18-year-old Oyama High School student, described how one <br/>
of his friends who was habitually lethargic suddenly came alive when <br/>
playing with the children in a nursery school. After seeing how grateful <br/>
the residents were, he said he too had felt the value of visiting a <br/>
retirement home, even though it was not exactly what he would have chosen <br/>
to do. &quot;Some of them were on the point of tears,&quot; he said.<br/>
<br/>
If it gives young people an awareness of the importance of human contact <br/>
that they wouldn&#39;t otherwise have, it&#39;s not such a bad thing, he concluded.<br/>
<br/>
Nami Matsuura, aged 16, from Minami Tama High School, worked as a <br/>
volunteer at a nursery school during the summer vacation. &quot;Even if you&#39;re <br/>
made to do it, it opens up opportunities,&quot; she said.<br/>
<br/>
As an only child, Matsuura was grateful for the chance to get to know a <br/>
wider variety of people. But she confessed she had to tread carefully <br/>
with people she didn&#39;t much like.<br/>
<br/>
A third group also agreed with the idea of compulsory service under <br/>
certain conditions.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How about building in a trial period?&quot; asked18-year-old Oyama High <br/>
School student Yoko Mita. &quot;If people try it and don&#39;t like it, let them <br/>
quit. And they could be allowed to choose what they prefer from a range <br/>
of activities. I&#39;d agree as long as we&#39;re guaranteed that level of <br/>
freedom,&quot; she said.<br/>
<br/>
Noboru Hayase, head of the Japan NPO Center, has heard it all before, <br/>
since calls for compulsory community service have been around since the <br/>
1970s. However, one recent development is that would-be teachers are now <br/>
obliged to spend time working in a care facility, or something similar, <br/>
in order to obtain a teaching license. Unfortunately, though, many of the <br/>
institutions they&#39;re supposed to be helping are rather unhappy with the <br/>
arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Volunteer activities are a kind of love affair,&quot; Hayase said. &quot;People do <br/>
them because they like to, and that is the source of true community <br/>
spirit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He believes the arguments of those who call for compulsory service <br/>
schemes are based on thinking that puts the whole before the individual. <br/>
They&#39;re taking things too far, he said.<br/>
<br/>
Akira Kurihara, a Rikkyo University professor speaking for the Japan <br/>
Association for Volunteer Activities, estimated that the National <br/>
Commission on Educational Reform was more than 20 years behind the times <br/>
with its confrontational concept of community service; of people who <br/>
serve and people who are served; and with its thinking that community <br/>
service would take place mainly in agriculture and in caring for the <br/>
sick, the elderly and the disabled. In his view, it&#39;s not much different <br/>
from a group of middle-aged people sitting in a bar, drinking beer and <br/>
grumbling about the &quot;young people today.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Against the tide<br/>
<br/>
According to Kurihara, the commission is clearly going against the tide <br/>
in an age when ordinary citizens are networking spontaneously in ways <br/>
quite different from the old-style community groups and opposition <br/>
movements. Its goal, he said, is obviously a revision of the Fundamentals <br/>
of Education Act.<br/>
<br/>
Ryoichi Kawakami chairs the group Professional Teachers and is a member <br/>
of the National Commission on Educational Reform. As someone who knows <br/>
well how the situation stands in the country&#39;s schools, he supports <br/>
compulsion. Education Ministry policy has, he explained, concentrated <br/>
mainly on lesson content, with less and less in the way of formal <br/>
activities. The result is, he said, that children are receiving less <br/>
experience in doing things together in groups.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, even younger teachers are incapable of leading group <br/>
activities, he complained. And if things go on as they are, there will be <br/>
more and more people inept at anything that involves working together <br/>
with others.<br/>
<br/>
Youngsters will learn something from the experience, even if they are <br/>
forced into it, Kawakami said. Instead of always pouncing on others&#39; <br/>
weaknesses, they should be given a chance to learn at first hand the <br/>
importance of doing something for other people.<br/>
