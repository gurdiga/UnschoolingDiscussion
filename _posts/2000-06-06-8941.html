<div>We have just returned from the Clonlara conference, which was held in Ann 
Arbor this past weekend. To be in a place where the whole world homeschools was 
wonderful!!!&nbsp; We have a friend who graduated, so we attended some of the 
graduation ( we had to leave early to drive home since we had a wedding on 
Sunday--we got home at 1 AM). My oldest dd--almost 12--thought the graduation 
was so cool. Family members &amp;/or</div>
<div>others the child graduating asks, come to the podium with the graduate and 
everyone has the opportunity to speak. There were tables where kids could 
display a project of their choosing--education in action!&nbsp; My oldest did a 
project on body language and horses (her passion) and my youngest did one on 
Russia.</div>
<div>&nbsp;My dh attended an intense session with Joseph Chilton Pearce--more on 
that later after he&#39;s digested it and after I read some of his books.</div>
<div>&nbsp; I am more and more convinced that this path we have chosen for the 
past 7 yrs is so right.</div>
<div>&nbsp;By the way, on Sunday, my almost 12 dd asked what algebra is. Then 
she told us she wants to learn it.&nbsp; My younger dd(8) wants to learn the 
history of our house (it is very old!) and to learn what has happened in the 
world since it has been built. She is intrigued by Harriet Tubman and the 
Undrsground RR and wonders if our house could have been a stop... When&nbsp;I 
called the library to see what kind of resources they have, the librarian asked 
me how old my child is--when I told her that Hannah is 8, she said&quot;Isn&#39;t that a 
little young?...&quot;</div>
