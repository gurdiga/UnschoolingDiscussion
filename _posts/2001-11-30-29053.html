<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609721579">Okay, this may be taking the easy way out...my kids wanted to <br/>
do a gingerbread house as well. Grandma brought over a gingerbread <br/>
house kit she got at Target.  It had all the pieces inside the box <br/>
ready to be put together and the frosting mix with coloring dyes as <br/>
well as candy.  The kids had a BLAST. They set all the pieces to make <br/>
the house and put frosting all over the darn thing. Then of course <br/>
they added way more candy then what was contained in the box! I think <br/>
it turned out great and the kids were so pleased with their creation <br/>
they all wanted their picture taken next to it.  It was easy and so <br/>
much fun.    Older children may prefer doing the whole baking of the <br/>
gingerbread but my kids aged 9 and under were well pleased. <br/>
     By the way, it tasted pretty good as well.  ;)<br/>
