<div id="ygrps-yiv-685874302">&lt;&lt;was always told I had so much &quot;potential&quot;.  It felt like a burden instead of being liberating.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Being good at many things is so different than knowing what one wants to do, what one likes to do.  The beauty of unschooling is really having the opportunity from day one to explore all options.  Not waiting until after school is over - high school or college.<br/>
<br/>
There is so much I want to do.  It&#39;s taken a while but I am convinced (if I take care of my body) I can do eveything - just not all at once.  And that makes it easier to decide what to do now.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I want my sons to feel that freedom. To be who they are without pressure of turning every single talent into a moneymaker because you&#39;re &quot;supposed to&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely.  Whenever anyone says to my girls - oh you could be that when you grow up...i reply by saying they are already doing that - they don&#39;t need to be older to do anything (an artist, a dancer, gymnast, a teacher)  <br/>
<br/>
My mom is still waiting for me to become a doctor &lt;lol&gt;<br/>

GOOD POINT!<br/>
<br/>
Marty wants to be a policeman.  Recently he said &quot;If I become a policeman and <br/>
decide after a while I don&#39;t want to do it anymore, maybe I could go into <br/>
law.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s healthy.  He neither feels he has to rush headlong toward law school <br/>
right now, nor that he has to decide now whether he wants to be a policeman <br/>
until he retires.<br/>
<br/>
Good for Marty.<br/>

Oh the beauty of public service - like policeman and fireman - is that if they start young after 20 years they have a nice pension and at the age of 40 - their whole life ahead of them to pursue whatever.  I know a few fellows (and lady) who have had further education and training paid for by these jobs and the luxury of gracefully moving into overlapping second careers with the financial support of pensions.<br/>
<br/>
Not a bad way to go.<br/>
