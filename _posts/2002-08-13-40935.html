<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442659637">This was mailed to me after my negative post on HSLDA.  I thought <br/>
some of you might have a message for this person.....I did respond <br/>
and would be happy to pass her email only to those interested in <br/>
letting her know the truth about HSLDA. All I can think is GAG!!!!<br/>

Dear Gruvystarchild, Greetings, I read your letter and when my <br/>
children were younger I was greatful to have someone out there <br/>
watching out for my interest re: home schooling, because like you I <br/>
could not put the time forward. Now my children are much older and I <br/>
still feel blessed to have HSLDA watching my back along with every <br/>
other homeschool family, yet now I am able to also help advocate <br/>
along side them and other groups who believe in our rights to home <br/>
school.Here in the US states HSLDA fights hard to preserve our right <br/>
to homeschool. I know personally families that they helped when being <br/>
harrassed by school officials. Without them one of these families <br/>
would have complied and sent thier son back to public school.  HSLDA <br/>
is in Washington DC fighting to preserve our rights as home schoolers <br/>
and continually monitoring the laws that affect home schoolers. With <br/>
all due respect, I am an advocate for HSLDA because without them many <br/>
people would just sit back and let the goverment, state and city <br/>
officials tell us what we can and cannot do when it come to educating <br/>
our children at home.  A perfect example is prayer taken out of <br/>
school, no one stood up and wham, it was accomplished and the same <br/>
with the Pledge Allegiance, thank God though we have people fighting <br/>
for this one. Take care and God bless, Mary W.</div>
