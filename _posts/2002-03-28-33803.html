<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Attention Lurkers and Digest Readers<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hello, I am brand new, only two days here, and I would qualify as both a <br/>
lurker and digest reader. I&#39;m a yahoo list participator and only get digests <br/>
and a few individual - I have them set as my preferences.  I&#39;m not sure about <br/>
what you&#39;re asking, but personally I wouldn&#39;t pay $20 for access to something <br/>
that is free.  Perhaps that is a rude thing to say because this groups is <br/>
trying to do something with that $20 and it would be a helpful thing.  Since <br/>
I&#39;m uninformed at this time, that&#39;s about all I can say =/<br/>
<br/>
I would like to add that I LOVE what I have read so far on this list.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t realize I was an Unschooler until recently, near the end of our first <br/>
year of homeschooling our 10 year old girl.  The whole idea we pulled her out <br/>
was because she isn&#39;t the square peg that needs to fit in the school&#39;s square <br/>
hole. She is creative, whimsical, a dreamer, energetic, loving, <br/>
demonstrative, feeling, caring, soft, tender and wonderful.  All of these <br/>
things were being chipped at in the school.  MY child isn&#39;t the school <br/>
district&#39;s child, she is mine.  Fortunately I live in AZ, a state that is <br/>
very free with its homeschooling rights.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for this list and I hope it isn&#39;t falling apart (I wonder...reading <br/>
some of the posts?)  I&#39;m glad to have found it and hope that it continues <br/>
because I&#39;ve enjoyed each and every post over the past couple of days and <br/>
felt a REAL connection with the attitudes of the people joined here.<br/>
<br/>
Trust me, I won&#39;t lurk much because I have a lot to learn and am quite <br/>
looking forward to knowing more unschoolers.  It seems as though education <br/>
and the whole &quot;it takes a village&quot; mentality is corrupting our elementary <br/>
school age kids...it isn&#39;t in high school anymore. It starts in 2nd, 3rd and <br/>
4th grade and my child, as yours are too, is much too precious to lose her to <br/>
a system of THE SCHOOL KNOWS BEST.<br/>
Greetings,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590277611">Welcome Kristine!<br/>
<br/>
Glad you&#39;re enjoying this list so far. I hope it isn&#39;t falling apart either. LOL!<br/>
I think we need to start talking about unschooling again, and so it&#39;s good to hear from a newcomer that wants to do that!<br/>
<br/>
Where are you in AZ? I live in Phoenix.<br/>
I have 2 boys (9 & almost 11) and we homeschooled for 5 years and have been unschooling since September.<br/>
We still belong to our old homeschooling group and so far they&#39;re cool with us being unschoolers. But it&#39;s always nice to meet other unschoolers, whenever possible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you came out of lurkdom. Hope to hear more from you!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I just love when a parent can describe her child using only wonderful words <br/>
like this. :o) It&#39;s great that ps didn&#39;t convince you she was damaged-goods <br/>
in some way.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll be visiting in Phoenix in April. If you&#39;re anywhere nearby, maybe we <br/>
could get together for a real life chat. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
