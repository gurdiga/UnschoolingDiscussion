&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t think people should be offended if they are<br/>
told that what they are doing is not unschooling, if unschooling is what<br/>
they *want* to be doing.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For some reason lots of people want to say they&#39;re unschooling, or better yet <br/>
have other people say they&#39;re unschooling, without really doing it.  It&#39;s <br/>
like some kind of badge of honor.  I don&#39;t understand it but I&#39;ve seen it <br/>
dozens of times.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly introduced herself at a little graduation ceremony and said <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m Holly Dodd, I&#39;m eleven years old, and I&#39;m unschooled.&quot;    I cringed.  I <br/>
need to ask her to say &quot;I&#39;m homeschooled.&quot;  Because &quot;unschooling&quot; is <br/>
gibberish to people who barely know what homeschooling is.  It&#39;s jargon from <br/>
within the homeschooling world.  It&#39;s nothing anyone outside who thinks kids <br/>
should all be in school need to hear anything about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Here is what I think some are saying about unschooling - that we need to<br/>
trust our children in everything, not trust them in everything but math, or<br/>
everything but feeding themselves, for instance.  It doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
children are left totally to their own devices either.  Parents provide an<br/>
environment that includes math/food/etc., and are available to guide and<br/>
assist their children in using math/food/etc., and trust that children will<br/>
use math/food/etc., as they need to without the parent requiring it of them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like that and I understand it, but I think it goes too far.  <br/>
I&#39;m not sure what to say about the full-treatment of kid trust, but I think <br/>
the food and the TV and chores stuff, while proving a HUGE big point, is <br/>
beyond unschooling in a way.  But I have no idea what to call it.  And I <br/>
think that sometimes those families who DO go beyond &quot;just unschooling&quot; find <br/>
unschooling to be easy.  Maybe it&#39;s just a mark you have to overshoot.  Or <br/>
maybe when someone sees that learning can work so well, they just know that <br/>
trusting their children with other things will work the same simple, <br/>
wonderful way.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe it&#39;s that if a child is expected to be a person early, not a kid <br/>
til 18, not &quot;preparing for the future,&quot; maybe part of that rich, early <br/>
acknowledgement of their powerful selfhood involves trusting them with their <br/>
own lives, while still being entrusted ourselves with shepherding the <br/>
peaceful, safe unfolding of it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a big damned unnamed deal.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to call it.  It&#39;s swirling around me, and once in a while a <br/>
phrase jumps out, and it&#39;s not about &quot;school&quot; or education, it&#39;s about <br/>
empowerment at a deeper level.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Going beyond that, arithmetic and food are things that we use to accomplish<br/>
our goals in life, but they are not the end goals by themselves.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  But what?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Mary Ellen.   The water&#39;s still muddy, but you&#39;re stirring it in a <br/>
good place.<br/>
