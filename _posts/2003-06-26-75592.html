<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859349981">I have an 11 year old with hypothyroidism. He is probably 40 lbs overweight. Since he began thyroid treatment about two months ago he has of course increased energy and activity level.He still struggles with energy levels on some days. We are discovering that he has signs of beginning diabetes, hypoglycaemia. As well he has always suffered from food allergies and asthma. <br/>
<br/>
My dilemma is defooding and still helping him learn how to honour his health needs. At this time he reacts to milk, any simple sugars, and wheat and corn products. Milk makes him sick enough that he needs no reminding. The others set up a craving feeling, headaches and sugar issues in his body. He also wants to lose weight as he wants to run more during his soccer games and at this point is physically finding this challenging.<br/>
<br/>
I am really concerned about the emotional damage this whole weight stuff and food restriction thing can cause yet I struggle with my own issues of his weight and energy issues. It is hard for me to not get caught up in other peoples judgements(spoken and unspoken). <br/>
<br/>
We see a naturopath who is aware of our struggle and is helping to find a way to help his body regulate insulin levels better but she thinks that all simple carbs and sugars are not being used by his body but are being stored immediately as fat and that the only way he will be able to loose weight is to cut out the simple carbs.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason he wants to lose weight is to play soccer better as he passionately loves this game and we are supporting that passion even though we are not so enamoured with it.<br/>
