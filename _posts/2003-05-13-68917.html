<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486544234">Okay, I&#39;ve been up for almost 5 days now, Avery is really sick and <br/>
he&#39;s not sleeping for more than a few hours at a streach, my butt is <br/>
stuck in the computer chair, his fave place to nurce. I&#39;ve been <br/>
reading all my mail and searching through yahoo groups and decided <br/>
today that I wanted to start a few new groups and thought I&#39;d let <br/>
ya&#39;ll know about them first. <br/>
<br/>
The first group is for California Unschoolers. I&#39;ve noticed that <br/>
there are quite a few folks from Cali o nthis list and there wasn&#39;t a <br/>
Cali unschooling list so, here ya go<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/CaliUnschooling">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/CaliUnschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The other group is for Pagan Unschoolers, again a group that I <br/>
could&#39;t find, lots that cover all methods but none strictly <br/>
unschooling, so in my sleep deprived mind I took it upon myself to <br/>
start on. :-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So, there they are I hope that some of ya drop on by. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m gonna try to remove myself from this chair and attempt to lay <br/>
Avery down in bed, crossed fingers and toes.<br/>
