<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686577628">Hi,<br/>
   we&#39;re trying to identify a bird that may be an Anerican species. It has a <br/>
white breast, red wings and a blue or possibly black head. It may be of the <br/>
crow or blackbird families.<br/>
We bought one of those kits which you make a polystyrene flying bird from, <br/>
all the birds are real ones...but this one is listed as being the great-bird <br/>
  but that name comes up with a big nothing on the net. Could be a <br/>
mis-spelling as perigrine is listed as being a Pergrine. Hope someone can <br/>
help us.<br/>
<br/>

                         Best Wishes, Elaine<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811814964">I have some ideas and questions but no answer, yet.  <br/>
Do the other birds in the collection look like the bird they are claiming<br/>
to be?   Does the Peregrine really look like a Peregrine?   Are the<br/>
colors right for the birds that are identified?    If so, then  what is<br/>
the beak and tail shape like and the leg color of the bird you haven&#39;t<br/>
identified?<br/>
Harris&#39;s Hawk has red wings, but the white breast is wrong, they are<br/>
dark.  They have a white rump and white band at their tail.   Juveniles<br/>
have a lighter streaked breast.<br/>
Lastly, if the other birds look somewhat like the bird they are claiming<br/>
to be, check the country in which your kit was made and do an Internet<br/>
search for common birds in that country.   American guides list very few<br/>
vagrants from other countries. <br/>
Good luck!   Let us know if you find it!    It&#39;s possible it&#39;s just a<br/>
made up bird... <br/>
Where did you get your kit?    Can you call the company and ask?   Not<br/>
that they would know...<br/>
