<div id="ygrps-yiv-203406824">Hello again,<br/>
<br/>
As I ponder what may work for me as I shed my controls over my children&#39;s food choices, these ideas have come to mind.  <br/>
<br/>
-printed out inspiring e-mails and articles and put them in a binder in the kitchen so I can reach for it in a weak moment <br/>
<br/>
-created 2 affirmations for myself<br/>
  1.  I trust our innate desire to learn.<br/>
  2.  I trust our innate ability to nourish our bodies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can remember their &quot;letting go of the control of food choices of their children&quot; phase enough to remember what tips helped them reach the other side and would like to share them here, I would be so grateful to read more of these, and perhaps print them out for my binder!<br/>

============<br/>
 <br/>
Mine was with babies, but it helped me to remember my friend &quot;Snail&quot;(Lisa)  <br/>
who lived on mostly donuts and cheap breakfast pastries for three years or so  <br/>
after she moved out of her (crazy) parents&#39; house, and I never remember her  <br/>
being sick or lacking energy in all that time.  I never saw her eat fruit,  <br/>
vegetables or meat.  Bread and cheese a time or two, and  cake.    She was in the <br/>
SCA, and we&#39;d go camping for days or a  week, and she would turn down offers <br/>
of fresh-cooked food or cooler sandwich  food in favor of the coffee cake or <br/>
sweetrolls she had brought (because they  seemed more medieval to her than <br/>
donuts).<br/>
 <br/>
She married a physicist (which made her physics-geek parents happy) who was  <br/>
also a cook, and she started eating WILD stuff, like fire-roasted goat, and  <br/>
artichokes and mushrooms and chicken and broccoli.  <br/>
 <br/>
I remembered seeing parents try to force babies to eat baby food, and I saw  <br/>
too many other moms harranguing kids one way or another, and see that neither  <br/>
the food nor the family nor the child was benefitting at all.<br/>
 <br/>
Meanwhile, my kids were calm and happy, not hungry (or if they were they  <br/>
would reach for food or ask to nurse or get food) and not afraid of food, or  <br/>
avoiding it, or sneaking it nor being ecstatic at seeing it.  There wasn&#39;t  a lot <br/>
of emotion tied up in food.  It was as available as air or water, and  so it <br/>
came to be like air or water, and they didn&#39;t abuse or reject or long for  or <br/>
hoard it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031096307">Hi all,  This is my first post to the group but I have lurked for a long time,  the food control issue is what brings me out.  I was raised in a family where I had to sit at the table with a timer if I had not finished diner with the family.  When the timer rang and I was still not done I was punished, and they wondered why I had and eating problem.  My kids eat pretty much what they want when they want.  And to top it off 3 of my 4 kids have turned vegan so I am learning the wonders of cooking vegan.  I usually make 2 versions of meals, one with meat (for husband and youngest) and one without (I can go either way).  All snacks and deserts are made vegan.  I refuse to get upset by my kids food choices, I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s important enough.  They usually make good choices and when they don&#39;t it&#39;s temporary.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the interesting views,<br/>
