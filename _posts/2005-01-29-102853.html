<div id="ygrps-yiv-865800293">The thing is if your kids are in  a public school in Tennessee, the <br/>
school has the legal authority to physically discipline your child <br/>
unless you sign a statement that you do not allow it. Some school <br/>
systems really don&#39;t enforce it but the county I live in does. I was so <br/>
grateful to not have to deal with them anymore.<br/>

By high  school<br/>
there was no threats of corporal punishment for me but my dh, one  year<br/>
older than myself, having moved to Florida near Pensacola  (Fort<br/>
Walton-near an AF base) from overseas suddenly had the threats of  &quot;the<br/>
paddle&quot; if he didn&#39;t stay inline.  Once high school was over for  him,<br/>
he knew people who had been paddled in  school.<br/>

 <br/>
My first introduction to public school in Arkansas was a paddling, for  <br/>
chewing gum and then not spitting it out when I was told.  First day.   The <br/>
principal called me in from the playground because he saw me from his  window.  <br/>
 <br/>
I wasn&#39;t a stranger to spanking, although I hadn&#39;t been spanked since I was  <br/>
really, really little.  I WAS a stranger to having it done to me BY a  <br/>
stranger, and at SCHOOL.  There was no corporal punishment in my school  outside of <br/>
Chicago.  But my daddy was from Arkansas, and he grew up with  the principal of <br/>
the school, and it was just kind of agreed that this was how it  was done <br/>
down here.<br/>
 <br/>
Thankfully, I was able to opt my own kids out of &quot;licks&quot; when they went to  <br/>
school.<br/>
