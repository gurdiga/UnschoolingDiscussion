Awww Julie, big hugs coming your way from a new-to-list lurker.  <br/>
We&#39;re in Texas where there are NO laws regarding hsing and I had a <br/>
truant officer from the county knock on the door one afternoon last <br/>
August.  He asked if I had any paperwork to &quot;prove&quot; we were <br/>
homeschooling and I told him there was none required.  We stood and <br/>
talked about who notified him(the school district) and a homeschooler <br/>
in his own neighborhood.  Even though it was a positive visit I was <br/>
VERY shaken and took days to get calm.  You can read about our <br/>
experiences with public school, CPS(from withdrawing our son from a <br/>
ps pre-k) and the local school district here... <br/>

<br/>
Hang in there, hopefully it will all blow over soon and you can get <br/>
back to normal.  After my little run-in I made a BIG &quot;Proud <br/>
Homeschooling Family&quot; sign on posterboard and put it in my son&#39;s <br/>
window for all to see.  It made me feel better to display it.<br/>

<br/>
Oh, gosh.  Some states have dropped or set a low priority on <br/>
&quot;educational neglect&quot; cases, but maybe MO is not one of them.<br/>
<br/>
Are you in touch with a homeschooling list or group in your state where <br/>
you can post your situation and get info about what else has been going <br/>
on locally?<br/>
<br/>

PS   I&#39;ve been reading a new biography of Ben Franklin, and for someone <br/>
who&#39;s education was essentially &quot;neglected&quot; as a kid, he grew up to be a <br/>

Julie...did they say who turned you in? Got any PO&#39;ed family or <br/>
neighbors? Now that you&#39;ve had time to review, what did they focus <br/>
on? A certain child? I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t let them in.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be sending the good vibes your way....just remember ,use <br/>
different color ink on attendence and put in a week of sick <br/>
days....everyone had a bout of real bad summer head colds, did you <br/>
not? Download some crappy schooly looking work sheets if you get <br/>
time and do some coloring....write spelling words ten times and make <br/>
up sentences.....drag out any text looking reference and hang a <br/>
battered notebook in it. Borrow test scores from other MO <br/>
homeschooler, whiteout the names and re-copy.<br/>

<br/>
A few things I learned from a friend who had child protective <br/>
services called on her.  They can get a search warrant to come into <br/>
your home.  Make sure kids&#39; bedrooms, kitchen, main living area is <br/>
cleaned up. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing you could do is take them to a doctor now, and have him <br/>
write on paper that they are healthy and not abused in anyway.  I <br/>
know they are just saying &quot;educational neglect&quot; now, but it wouldn&#39;t <br/>
hurt to have that done. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434970643">AFAIK, in every state there is a provision in which parents must be <br/>
legally informed of a violation in the homeschooling law by written <br/>
notice from the school district (NOT the social workers) and you <br/>
have at least two weeks to comply.  There are umbrella groups for <br/>
unschoolers everywhere -- they range from token fees to pricey, but <br/>
they are legal and will show you how to meet the legal requirements <br/>
easily.  Look for specific info at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeedmag.com/">http://www.homeedmag.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Best advice for dealing with DFS/CPS -- Make sure you have WITNESSES <br/>
before you speak to them again -- good friends, family, neighbors -- <br/>
find at least one unbiased person (preferable two or more) you can <br/>
summon on short notice and have with you.  NEVER talk to them alone -<br/>
- be friendly, be polite, be firm, and don&#39;t let them intimidate <br/>
you.  Just say that you would LOVE to speak with them, but your <br/>
lawyer has advised you against speaking about this sort of thing <br/>
without him present (make him the scapegoat and stand your ground as <br/>
long as there is no threat being made.*)  If you don&#39;t seem to have <br/>
a choice, a videocamera may tick them off, but it&#39;s better than <br/>
nothing.  Check out the info at <br/>

AFRA also has a link to the controversial HSLDA on their HELP ME NOW <br/>
page:<br/>
*The Social Worker At Your Door: 10 Helpful Hints<br/>

<br/>
Take this seriously, but don&#39;t let fear get the best of you.  Just <br/>
understand the people you&#39;re dealing with -- they are not friendly, <br/>
that is an act.  They _will_ lie to you and about you -- they _will_ <br/>
try to be your &quot;friend&quot; and get you to be upfront and honest (after <br/>
all, we have nothing to hide) and they _will_ use everything they <br/>
have against you -- twisted to suit their agenda.  Make sure they <br/>
have a piece of paper to back up every statement they make -- do NOT <br/>
take their word for it (my first mistake.)<br/>
<br/>
If that sounds positively negative, it&#39;s because we were one of the <br/>
ones who escaped child protective (so-called) services with our <br/>
family intact.  Since then, we have learned that this system is <br/>
corrupt (and has been for many, many years) in every single state <br/>
AFAIK, and those of us who have had a close encounter with CPS are <br/>
just now getting the courage to speak out!  If you haven&#39;t heard the <br/>
horror stories on the news, then you have been underground for <br/>
awhile.  Take care and let us know if we can help in any way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466131407">Having been there myself, I would second being very<br/>
cautious about what you say and how it is said. Remind<br/>
them that any reporting you must do by your state laws<br/>
is to the local school district superintendent and not<br/>
to them. As long as the local school district is<br/>
satisfied with your children&#39;s educational progress<br/>
they don&#39;t have a leg to stand on. In my case, there<br/>
were many lies on the part of the school district and<br/>
I am only now that we are out of the area able to<br/>
prove it, although our case was dropped due to the<br/>
move. I did file complaints however and that has<br/>
resulted in some of the personnel I was dealing with<br/>
in the school system who are no longer either working<br/>
for the school or no longer working in the same<br/>
capacity. Sadly there is little recourse against DSS.<br/>
<br/>
It is still very frustrating and I wish I&#39;d been<br/>
stronger against both the school and DSS at the time<br/>
things were happening. I understand your fears. <br/>
<br/>
I will keep your family in my prayers that this is<br/>
resolved easily! <br/>

&gt; Karen<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whoops!  Forgot about Arkansas -- home of one of the most <br/>
ridiculously restrictive homeschooling laws in the country, founded <br/>
under the NEA-charged Clinton regime and nurtured to extremity by <br/>
HSLDA.  Guess things haven&#39;t improved since we were advised to go <br/>
underground there by the state Christian homeschool group in the <br/>
early 90&#39;s.  They instructed us unschooling types who objected to <br/>
mandatory teach-to-the-testing to take advantage of the &quot;private <br/>
school&quot; loophole which existed at the time.  &quot;Private school&quot; had <br/>
thus far been defined as to what it is NOT (single homeschooling <br/>
family,) but not yet what it IS as long as the next WANNABE case had <br/>
not been brought up for review by the courts.  This brilliant <br/>
strategy also worked to keep all the dissenters out of touch with <br/>
each other when HSLDA swooped in to &quot;help&quot; the lay people out with <br/>
all that complicated legal stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
We found out a year or so later that the local affiliated group had <br/>
a little discussion about our family, and the general consensus was <br/>
that their role should be one of &quot;support&quot; rather than throwing <br/>
their fellow homeschoolers to the wolves.  I informed the thoughtful <br/>
person that warned me about this potential threat that I was <br/>
following the advice of their own state leaders in continuing to <br/>
follow the program we had established under Mississippi law <br/>
(modified Moore Associate program) before relocation.  <br/>
<br/>
At the time of the move, I naively thought that all homeschooling <br/>
laws were as free and open as ours were in MS -- live and learn a <br/>
little too late...  CPS didn&#39;t come aknockin&#39; at the door (or <br/>
rather, campus) till years later -- ironically, during a summer <br/>
vacation trip while touring my dad&#39;s alma mater in northern MS.  <br/>
Another word to the wise, don&#39;t go camping with a large family away <br/>
from home(!)  Strangers might get the idea that you&#39;re homeless and <br/>
unemployed, and question your homeschooling plan even when school&#39;s <br/>
out!  <br/>
<br/>
Whether it&#39;s Arkansas or any other state, where there&#39;s a sincere <br/>
will to unschool freely, there&#39;s always a way!  Find a homeschool-<br/>
friendly private school and enroll as a homebound student, if need <br/>
be.  I don&#39;t remember all the specifics of the law in Arkansas, but <br/>
I was sure that even they had a written notification provision to <br/>
allow parents time to comply before siccing the dogs on them.  I&#39;m <br/>
not the least surprised to hear there is none, as the last time I <br/>
heard, the one inclusive support group that had formed to defend <br/>
what was left of our right to direct our kids&#39; education (before <br/>
HSLDA managed to remove them permanently) was losing the battle <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Another tip on dealing with (in)Human Services:  Always answer the <br/>
door and telephone immediately if you can, even if it&#39;s to make more <br/>
another apology for not being able to discuss legal matters without <br/>
your attorney (even if you haven&#39;t one, yet) per his explicit <br/>
instructions.  That made all the difference in the world with the <br/>
social worker who took up the case when it was transferred back <br/>
home.  <br/>
<br/>
This fella got upset when he got the answering machine the first <br/>
couple of times, and told me he suspected I was trying to avoid him <br/>
or screening my calls (which I was,) even when I called him right <br/>
back.  I politely explained that I took my homeschooling <br/>
responsibilities seriously (and I really do-just not in the <br/>
conventional sense,) and had always discouraged people from dropping <br/>
in on us unannounced, as well as relying on the answering machine to <br/>
avoid unwelcome interruptions to our day (solicitors and social <br/>
workers being the main culprits for the time being.)  <br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, I made sure he never felt rejected or neglected <br/>
again.  The last time he popped in for a random visit, I was in a <br/>
merry mood as we were in the midst of party preparations for DH&#39;s <br/>
fortieth birthday.  It was a messy scene (which prompted a <br/>
halfhearted reprimand) with craft projects abounding, but he <br/>
couldn&#39;t help but catch our enthusiasm.  Even used our family in the <br/>
final interview as an example of one who never belonged on their <br/>
casebooks when introducing us to a new trainee.<br/>
<br/>
A word on obtaining legal advice, the guy who runs MASS Outrage<br/>
(.com) has some excellent information on selecting the right one -- <br/>
and thankfully, his website is up&running again.  Our attorney was <br/>
an integral part of the good ole boy network, having married into a <br/>
well-established family firm, and the social worker was in the <br/>
minority and out of her league (even with her own counsel.)  Greg <br/>
Hession says to make sure you get someone who knows and despises CPS <br/>
for the corrupt agency it is.  <br/>
<br/>
Greg adamantly advises against signing any kind of &quot;case plan,&quot; <br/>
stating that it is a trap which, thankfully, was never suggested to <br/>
us!  The bottom line is don&#39;t fall for their bluffs and baldfaced <br/>
lies or let &#39;em tell you what you can and cannot do -- get a second <br/>
(third and fourth) opinion from a friendly, knowledgeable party as <br/>
long as you aren&#39;t backed into a corner (and don&#39;t get caught alone <br/>
at home or lured into their office, if you can help it.  Again, they <br/>
really don&#39;t want any WITNESSES hanging around to mess up their <br/>
plans.)  <br/>
<br/>
You do have a right to legal counsel, even though they will do <br/>
everything but deny that fact to get you to open up and spill your <br/>
heart & soul to them.  I can&#39;t find National Outrage online anymore, <br/>
but their best advice is to SHUT UP!  Short, simple, and straight to <br/>
the heart of the matter.  Name, rank, and serial number (and I&#39;d <br/>
keep the latter to myself) is all that&#39;s required even when you&#39;re <br/>
guilty until proven innocent.<br/>
<br/>
Godspeed ~ we&#39;re keeping the faith that you and your family will <br/>
prevail!</div>

Whoops!  Forgot about Arkansas -- home of one of the most  <br/>
ridiculously restrictive homeschooling laws in the country, founded  <br/>
under the NEA-charged Clinton regime and nurtured to extremity by  <br/>
HSLDA.  Guess things haven&#39;t improved since we were advised to go  <br/>
underground there by the state Christian homeschool group in the <br/>
early  90&#39;s. <br/>

Things are not as bad as they were then.  The testing no longer holds  any <br/>
strings (although that could change with the recent Judicial Audit Committee  <br/>
review of the homeschool law).  We do have to test yearly, now, from grades  <br/>
3-9, but the testing is not as lengthy and only in reading and math.   Parents <br/>
are no longer required to have a high school diploma.  There&#39;s now  what I call <br/>
a &quot;pound of flesh&quot; provision, which prevents a parent from pulling  their kid <br/>
out of school if they&#39;re under disciplinary action.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s still very easy to be undergound.<br/>
 <br/>
Umbrella schools are still not a legal option, although out of state  <br/>
boarding schools are.  (I&#39;m imagining an actual out of state boarding  school acting <br/>
as a &quot;covering&quot; for those students who can afford to visit it once  in a <br/>
while.)  I can&#39;t imagine a private school taking a &quot;homebound&quot; student  who wasn&#39;t <br/>
actually homebound.  What good would that do for  socialization?  ;)<br/>
