&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ~Kelly, NOT a Hemingway fan!&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

&lt;&lt;I thought I was the only one!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Gags me.<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of the &quot;famous&quot; authors of the late 19th and early 20th century <br/>
are famous just because it was hard to get published and not so many people <br/>
bothered to try.  I could certainly be wrong, but a lot of &quot;modern <br/>
literature&quot; seems thin and sloppy to me.<br/>
<br/>
There are probably more really great writings rejected every month these days <br/>
than were published in the 19th century altogether.<br/>
<br/>
Looking back at the 20th century from this perspective (2003, ha!) I would <br/>
enshrine Kahlil Gibran and Kurt Vonnegut.  Hermann Hesse, maybe.  Proves <br/>
nothing except I&#39;m some kind of hippie.   But if I were teaching a literature <br/>
class, it would also be north America, Europe and the Middle East.   Ah.  I <br/>
feel virtue just oozing up around me.  Oh wait.  Let&#39;s call it English, <br/>
German and Arabic.  That will make more parts of the world feel represented.  <br/>
They&#39;re all Christian, so that spoils my virtue some, but ethnocentricity is <br/>
just one of those things we&#39;ll write off to &quot;that&#39;s the way the 20th century <br/>
was, before the current enlightenment.&quot;<br/>
