<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350585295">I got pregnant while taking the pill.  It didn&#39;t stop me from<br/>
conceiving very good.  ;)  The pill is also designed to change the<br/>
lining of the uterus so that if conception should occur, the baby<br/>
couldn&#39;t implant on the uterus a week later like it was supposed<br/>
to and would just starve as the yolk sac was used up.  That aspect<br/>
of the pill failed for me too thankfully and I have a child to<br/>
show for it.  :)<br/>
Had I known that my uterus lining was chemically changed to not<br/>
allow a pregnancy to implant if the first job of the pill failed,<br/>
I would never have taken the pills.  It would go against my<br/>
personal beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
