<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269443971">I thought I&#39;d share, an unschooling moment...<br/>
<br/>
My kids just discovered the song &#39;Wipe out&#39; and  we are JAMMIN!  Abbi, 7 is playing the air guitar, Kyra, 5, is playing her bottom lip.  And Mom is surfing!!  <br/>
<br/>
Just think if the kids were in school I&#39;d be hurrying them to bed but what are we doing?  gotta love it!<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
wahoo!!<br/>
