Diana sent me the link with this note:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Hayden and I were interviewed while Hannah was on her own unschooling <br/>
adventure... for the local paper, they did a good job :)-=-<br/>
<br/>
The article is pretty good, and the paper is called the Sioux Falls Argus <br/>
Leader.   There&#39;s a photo of Diana and Hayden.   <br/>
