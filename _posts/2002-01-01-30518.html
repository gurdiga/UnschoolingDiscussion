<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963730699"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;So Karen, have you been to the Rethinking Education conference then?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Going<br/>
this year?  I&#39;ve been to the last 3 (or 4?) and will be there this fall at<br/>
the cooperative conference.  Perhaps we&#39;ve met?  Anyone else here going to<br/>
that?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
No, at the time we weren&#39;t unschooling :(, although talking about that with<br/>
my good friend Deanna Philbin started me on the way. She and her family<br/>
attended one year. Best of luck with the co-op conference; the concept<br/>
sounds great and I hope it goes well.<br/>
