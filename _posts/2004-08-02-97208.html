  I did use Daily Affirmation type books designed <br/>
for adult children of alchoholics (last year).  <br/>
---------------<br/>
<br/>
That &quot;Daily Affirmations&quot; book is one of the best books I ever had.  I&#39;ve <br/>
bought and given away half a dozen.  It&#39;s cheap at most AA offices and at bigger <br/>
or recovery bookstores.  Probably used at Amazon and all that too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=For me to let it go, I <br/>
have to talk through the issues and spit it all out through my mouth.  <br/>
(Even little stuff, like people cutting me off in traffic. &lt;g&gt;)-=-<br/>
<br/>
The bad thing about that is that if the other driver can&#39;t hear you but the <br/>
people inside your car can, you&#39;re infusing your space (and theirs) with mean <br/>
negativity for no good purpose.  The frustration already happened, no sense <br/>
passing it on. <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking just earlier today of the mean little-kid (school?) thing that <br/>
I knew from my childhood that my children don&#39;t know, which was to punch or <br/>
thump someone and say &quot;Pass it on.&quot;   I think passing it on isn&#39;t a great idea. <br/>
 And passing it back&#39;s not so great either.<br/>
<br/>
-=-There&#39;s going to come an age when your kids will want to complain about <br/>
you.  (Maybe just about something you did by accident.) -=-<br/>
<br/>
Holly started that when she was four or five, and hasn&#39;t stopped.  She has an <br/>
irritatingly clear memory, and likes to inventory.   *sigh*<br/>

&lt;&lt;How do I explain to my kids that what I am doing is different without<br/>
dredging up a past that my mom and I have both left behind?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I understand why it&#39;s important to do so.<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  If the relationship is workable, let it be what it is.<br/>
<br/>
When there&#39;s estrangement or continuing irritation I think it&#39;s okay to <br/>
explain it to kids at a level they&#39;ll understand, though.<br/>

Yes, that I agree with totally. When there are problems because of that past<br/>
relationship, that would also influence the children and yes there needs to<br/>
be some conversation as to why things are as they are.<br/>
