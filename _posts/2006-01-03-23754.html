<div id="ygrps-yiv-880842404">Yea, that is along the lines I was thinking.  I like the byproduct term you<br/>
used.  I think many people I know consider their kids &quot;byproducts&quot; of them.<br/>
Now that too could move on to a whole new discussion of kids behavior and<br/>
how parents treat their children because they feel their byproducts.<br/>

&gt; &gt; -=-I think the parent saying, &quot;I graduated 2 of them&quot; puts the<br/>
&gt; &gt; work, talents,<br/>
&gt; &gt; life experience, etc.,  in their (the parents) palms and not the<br/>
&gt; &gt; true person<br/>
&gt; &gt; who accomplished the tasks.  Does graduating really have anything<br/>
&gt; &gt; to do with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the parent?  Yea, that&#39;s my question for pondering.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ah.<br/>
&gt; So a parent who &quot;graduated six kids&quot; did a big job, and the kids were<br/>
&gt; byproduct maybe?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s like all the work of teaching, when a homeschooling parent (more<br/>
&gt; than unschoolers) sighs about how much work it is to teach all those<br/>
&gt; kids.  The kids are apparently not doing anything (except<br/>
&gt; occasionally making the parent&#39;s hard job even harder).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (Maybe I&#39;m missing your point to, but some of these phrases point in<br/>
&gt; all kinds of directions.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
