<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430092278">I know the subject has come up before about Neopets, but I don&#39;t recall it being much other than some people&#39;s children do go to that website...<br/>
 <br/>
Could someone enlighten me a bit about it? My husband has said he doesn&#39;t want Sarah going there...he says from what he sees it&#39;s a waste of her time because all it is is playing games for points to &quot;feed&quot; and &quot;care for&quot; a virtual pet that is just a picture on the screen. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d like to hear others&#39; impressions/thoughts on this...I&#39;m about to go to the website and look into it myself, but I want to hear what other people think about it as well. <br/>

Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047702323">It an imaginary game no different that playing dolls.  Just &#39;cause it&#39;s on<br/>
the computer doesn&#39;t make it any less a game of &quot;make believe.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention it isn&#39;t up to him to decide that it&#39;s a waste of time, it&#39;s<br/>
up to HER!  She may be getting something from it she either can&#39;t or doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to express.  Those games, just like the Yugioh my son plays, are about<br/>
making connections with the characters and staying with them long enough to<br/>
learn about them.  It&#39;s dolls, and cops and robbers, and cowboys and indians<br/>
and Spaceman Spiff.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like great fun to me.<br/>

Well, I guess you could see it that way.  As Mary mentioned, it&#39;s better to look at it as her choice.  My kids have been on and off it over the past year or so (the nice thing is your neopets never die so you can go back even 6 months later).  If she does want to pursue it, you could use it as an opportunity to show your husband how some cool learning can happen &quot;even&quot; playing Neopets.  I&#39;ll try put some of what I saw in &quot;schooly&quot; terms:<br/>
<br/>
Once my daughter spent a night creating pets, trying to find unique names for them ... really interesting considering how many millions of pets there are.  Even the most obscure names we could come up with were mostly already taken.  Cool and neat conversation about the &quot;size&quot; of the internet.  My youngest son (he&#39;s 6), spent almost a week playing every day a few months ago.  There are tons of games/puzzles: logic (tetris-like etc), skill (hangman/spelling etc) and luck. Even figuring out which is which is learning.  He loves figuring out high numbers and would play games to rack up his points and they post on the page how many plays the game has had that day (usually always in the thousands).  Then came the strategy of deciding which scores to keep and when to pass and try again (you can always play but you can only take 3 scores a day per game).  Not to mention purchasing food etc for your pet.  You don&#39;t just buy something, you haggle for it. Very fun way to play with numbers ... narrowing in on a final agreed upon price with the shopkeeper.  If you can get it before someone else does!  Tons of logic and math there.  And I could go on ....<br/>
<br/>
And of course, just seeing the interesting graphics and games and realizing what can be accomplished on the web with some computer programming ... that&#39;s interesting in and of itself!<br/>
<br/>
Just a bit of food for thought if your daughter does decide to try it out. :)<br/>

  Do you know that my kids are learning about the stock market from that site.  :)  Throw that one at your husband.  &lt;g&gt;  Math- statistics, percentages.  Vocabulary, reading.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve been amazed at the variety of things that they&#39;ve been doing on that site.  Both my dd(9) and ds(10) have spent lots of time there.   They really enjoy the games and the challenge from the games.<br/>
<br/>
  Lots of problem solving skills there.  Even when there is a game that is too hard for one of them they figure out a way to accomplish what they need to do.  Its pretty cool.  My 6 yr old also dabbles there a bit too, and she&#39;s not reading yet.<br/>
<br/>
  Another cool thing that has happened with them is that they have really been working together on raising their pets.  They sit on the computer together,  working together.  Pulling ideas from their past times in Neopia.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  So,  they&#39;ve enjoyed it. :)  Lots of fun.<br/>

Kirby forgot his password years ago.  Holly signed on but wasn&#39;t too <br/>
interested.  Marty was all over it, trading with friends, learning every game, and he <br/>
made me get my own account when I started WHINING that he wouldn&#39;t let me play <br/>
his Destruct-O-Match.  I just wanted to play the games that had any <br/>
similarity to Dr. Mario and Kirby&#39;s Avalanche, the two video games I&#39;ve ever really <br/>
been any good at.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673432024">&lt;&lt;I&#39;d like to hear others&#39; impressions/thoughts on<br/>
this...I&#39;m about to go <br/>
to the website and look into it myself, but I want to<br/>
hear what other <br/>
people think about it as well. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My son says, they have card games, spelling and math<br/>
games, a potato game where you have to count them as<br/>
they go by very quickly, a stock market that you can<br/>
play.  <br/>
<br/>
Think of it as a virtual world, not just a place to<br/>
have a virtual pet.  My son is on a mailing list and<br/>
meets people to chat with on IM thru Neopets.  His<br/>
friend is into it now too, and they battle in the<br/>
Battle Dome, buying items to improve their pets skills<br/>
and strength.    <br/>
<br/>
He says there&#39;s also in depth plots that you have to<br/>
figure out....<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s advertising to make it free, but it&#39;s really <br/>
easy to avoid.  You can buy items like Juicy Fruit to<br/>
feed your pet, but he says that&#39;s as bad as it gets. <br/>
<br/>
There are certain times to get certain items, he loves<br/>
that.  He&#39;ll jump up and say it&#39;s such and such time,<br/>
time to visit the Snowagger....lol. <br/>
<br/>
 He just corrected my spelling and called me a newbie,<br/>
lol, guess I don&#39;t play enough.  That&#39;s right, I have<br/>
an account, too! <br/>
<br/>
He also has his own webpage, or homepage, and had<br/>
quite a bit of fun writing it.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tired, and I just wrote what he told me, lol.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, he forgot, there are guilds too, and she can join<br/>
his, he says he&#39;s always looking for new members.  <br/>
<br/>
Alex (my son, 9) says if she wants to play he&#39;ll be<br/>
her NeoFriend.  Let me know offlist.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-132923652">Hey Mamabeth!  I answered your question last nite from<br/>
my son&#39;s perspective, now I can answer from a<br/>
parent&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
 Sandra says: <br/>
&lt;&lt;The Neopets games involve various things.  Words,<br/>
odds, patterns. And <br/>
she can <br/>
do what&#39;s fun and forget the rest.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s what I love about it, personally.  I go on<br/>
to only play games, with the added bonus of getting<br/>
NeoPoints to spend on my pets. Alex, on the other<br/>
hand, pays attention to much more.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, he kept track of Neopia Standard Time for<br/>
a while to figure out the time difference and even<br/>
switched his clock in his room to that time! lol <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s going to have a different experience than anyone<br/>
else based on what she likes to do there. They even<br/>
have outlets for some creativity, like the homepages<br/>
and the guilds and the shops, where part of world of<br/>
Neopia is their own, which I personally think is very<br/>
cool! <br/>
<br/>
Even if it&#39;s just something she does to have fun for a<br/>
few minutes, playing games, I would say it still holds<br/>
it&#39;s value (free!).  <br/>
<br/>
And if she gets into it and really enjoys it, there&#39;s<br/>
no way you or I could guess what educational value it<br/>
will have for her, because you might not notice it<br/>
until later, like any other activity unschooled kids<br/>
get involved in! ( Like when I found Alex at 1 in the<br/>
AM looking thru HTML books to help write his homepage<br/>
there.  He wanted scrolling text, and in the process<br/>
picked up a few more cool things he added to his<br/>
page.)   <br/>
