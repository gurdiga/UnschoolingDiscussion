<div id="ygrps-yiv-672296511">Hello, this is Katie from Homeschool.com. Can you post the following message <br/>
on your e-list, message boards, chat groups, etc? We really want to support <br/>
the success of one of our own and show him that his fellow homeschoolers are his <br/>
biggest fans. :)<br/>

Special Announcement: <br/>

<br/>
LIVE Interview with Eragon Author<br/>
<br/>
This Wednesday, May 19th!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For the first time ever, Homeschool.com will be doing a LIVE interview.  This <br/>
Wednesday, May 19th, Homeschool.com will be interviewing Christopher Paolini, <br/>
author of Eragon.  Although he is only in his early twenties, his book is #1 <br/>
on the New York Times bestseller list, he has made guest appearances on both <br/>
the David Letterman and Jay Leno shows, and he has sold the movie rights to his <br/>
book. Christopher attributes his success to the fact that he was <br/>
homeschooled. You can read more about Christopher in Homeschool.com&#39;s April newsletter at <br/>
Homeschool.com.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Christopher is an inspiration to homeschooled teens everywhere and we invite <br/>
both you and your older children to listen in as we interview Christopher and <br/>
find out: <br/>
<br/>
  a.. What type of homeschooling did Christopher do? Unschooling? <br/>
School-at-Home? <br/>
<br/>
  b.. Did he follow a particular curriculum? <br/>
<br/>
  c.. Is his household TV-free? <br/>
<br/>
  d.. How did his parents encourage him? What can we learn from that? <br/>
<br/>
  e.. What advice does he have for other aspiring writers? <br/>
<br/>
  f.. Can he give us a sneak preview on what will happen in Part Two? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Want to listen in on the interview? Maybe even ask your own question? <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how it works:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) This Wednesday, May 19th<br/>
<br/>
    12:00 (Pacific time)<br/>
<br/>
      1:00 (Mountain Time)<br/>
<br/>
      2:00 (Central Time)<br/>
<br/>
      3:00 (Eastern Time)<br/>
<br/>
2) Dial (507) 726-3270 and then enter the passcode: 55095#<br/>
<br/>
3) You will automatically be patched into a giant conference call (Lots of <br/>
energy and very exciting).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you happen to miss the live interview, you can still listen to the <br/>
recorded interview at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschool.com/articles/Camp2004">http://www.homeschool.com/articles/Camp2004</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. If you have not yet read Eragon, it is available from Amazon.com for <br/>
$13.26.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for letting your members know about this exciting event. We <br/>
sure appreciate working with you and I hope that you will let me know if we <br/>
can ever return the favor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
