   I never went to college and have my own &quot;gifts&quot;. I really dislike that<br/>
term because we are _all_ gifted in one way or another. I am an average Mom.<br/>
Nothing special other than I just try really hard to do the best for my boys<br/>
and the unschooling lifestyle is it.<br/>

   Wendy you aren&#39;t limiting your son you are giving him the world as his<br/>
classroom. I can&#39;t see anything better than that. Following his interests<br/>
and talents. Celebrating who _he_ is now. The future is there for him to<br/>
grasp. How could that possibly limit him?<br/>
<br/>
   We all go through times of doubt. I&#39;ve been there but as they say &quot;this<br/>
to shall pass&quot;. These women want you to be just like them. One upmanship and<br/>
all that. A follower of the herd. Brake out from that corral and be that<br/>
wild mare/stallion. Stand by your convictions and lead the way!<br/>

&quot;The function of the child is to live his own life - not the life that his<br/>
anxious parents think he should live, nor the life according to the purpose<br/>
of the educator who thinks he knows what is best. All of this interference<br/>
and guidance on the part of adults only produces a generation of robots.&quot;<br/>

one of them told me that only people with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; higher education should unschool, and that you must be a very smart person<br/>
&gt; to unschool. Do all of you have higher education and are you &quot;Gifted&quot;. One<br/>
&gt; girl told me that I was limited and that I shouldnt homeschool/unschool<br/>
&gt; cause Im holding my son back.<br/>
&gt; Im so hurt by these women. We have all been together since we got pg, last<br/>
&gt; dec!<br/>

**********************************************************************<br/>
I am just a high school graduate, and my husband dropped out (later earned a <br/>
diploma in the military).  But there are so many things I CAN do that many, <br/>
MANY average mom&#39;s were never taught (sewing, altering, knitting, spinning, <br/>
carding, (learning) weaving, gardening, butchering and skinning, building, masonry <br/>
work) that I just learned from living the way we do.  We are not <br/>
survivalists, but if a great depression swept across the country I have no doubt my kids <br/>
and their kids could easily survive.  <br/>
<br/>
The house we live in was built entirely from the first boards nailed, by my <br/>
son (10 yo when we started, 15 now) and my husband, with the girls and I doing <br/>
a good deal of work too.  I have no doubt my son could build his own house.  <br/>
<br/>
All of my kids are artistic, creative, and talented.  They all dance and fool <br/>
around with musical instruments.  Other than dance lessons, we&#39;ve just given <br/>
them the TOOLS to be artistic, creative and talented with, and they&#39;ve done <br/>
the rest.   <br/>
<br/>
But I seriously consider the kind of person they turn out to be the most <br/>
important, high above academics.  They&#39;re all easy to get along with, kind to <br/>
others, crazy funny, independent, and strong in their convictions.  I want them to <br/>
know, above anything, that THEY can make their lives happy if they choose to <br/>
be happy in whatever they do.  <br/>
