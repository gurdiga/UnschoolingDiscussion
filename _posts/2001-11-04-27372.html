dh has done with the boys playing Barbies with their sister, last Christmas<br/>
they even got their own Ken & Tommy dolls (they didn&#39;t want girl dolls).  And<br/>
when their sister gave up Barbie for American Girl dolls I was rather sad as<br/>
the boys wouldn&#39;t play without her.  So finally they asked me for a boy<br/>
&quot;american&quot; doll and I found them ones at Target.  They are so happy to be<br/>
playing with their sister again.  So as I am telling people I am also adding<br/>
in yes he is such a boy climbing trees, climbing on the roof, riding his<br/>
motorcycle etc (he is almost 7 and the other 4 1/2).  I am guilty as charged!<br/>
On the otherhand, my very macho dh HAS come a long way.  He was <br/>
raised a certain way (as I am sure most of us were) and never really said <br/>
much about the boys playing dolls (probably taking solace in the fact that<br/>
they did other boy/manly things!)  Baby steps, baby steps....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216655869">Kirby&#39;s favorite color was pink for years.  <br/>
<br/>
When he was three or four he asked for a &quot;Daddy Barbie at the beach.&quot;  I <br/>
asked for a translation from some slightly-older girls.  Malibu Ken.  We got <br/>
him one.<br/>
<br/>
I was preparing for the possibility... we had a very VERY pink neighbor boy <br/>
whose mom was hostile and resistent about her son&#39;s proclivities.  The <br/>
only-child neighbor used to come over and play the princess in the <br/>
make-believe with my three kids.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve grown up.  The neighbor is living with his dad and what seems could <br/>
be his dad&#39;s boyfriend, instead of the with the mom.  I don&#39;t know how it <br/>
fell out with him sexually; he&#39;s still a teen, going to public school, and we <br/>
moved away.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is very popular with girls, often older than he is.  He doesn&#39;t seem at <br/>
all feminine, except in his awareness and sensitivity (which all three kids <br/>
have, so it&#39;s not fair to call it feminine, except that so much of our <br/>
culture has traditionally tries to squish it in boys).  I&#39;m not going to <br/>
worry either way, although sometimes I think it&#39;s a shame for the kids if a <br/>
non-gender-traditional kid grows up in a homophobic family while a liberal <br/>
family that could have handled it has all hetero kids.  Life doesn&#39;t shake <br/>
out fairly or evenly, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-375231682">This is a great thread. My son, now 11 years old, has decided that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t really wear pink much anymore, but you should see the looks we get<br/>
when he and his sister, 6 yo, carry their stuffed animals into the store on<br/>
their shoulders. Nicholas loves &quot;Pookie&quot; and Emily has her &quot;Lily&quot; and they<br/>
are darn proud of it!<br/>
<br/>
I remember about two years ago, the kids and I were in the fabric store<br/>
picking out some flannel for pajamas for the winter. They both agreed on a<br/>
Peter Rabbit flannel, with gorgeous pics of Peter on it and the background<br/>
color? Pink, of course! When we got to the cutting counter, the cutter said<br/>
&quot;what are you going to make?&quot; (as they always seem to do) and I told her<br/>
PJ&#39;s for the kids. I was getting over five yards so she assumed I had<br/>
another daughter. She said &quot;oh, for these two? Are these your only<br/>
children?&quot; and I said yes and she said &quot;I think that&#39;s great that your son<br/>
will wear pink, some men wear it and it looks great on them!&quot; obviously<br/>
trying to mend what she thought may have been an awkward moment. My son<br/>
looked at her and said &quot;I like pink, I don&#39;t believe in gender<br/>
discrimination with clothing colors.&quot;. You should have seen her face. She<br/>
was shocked, then she smiled so big.<br/>
<br/>
It is always such a shocker to hear people use terms like &quot;fairy&quot;, it<br/>
saddens me though, as it is a tap on the shoulder reminding me that terms<br/>
like that are still commonly used by many people. This also makes me wonder<br/>
why people have to make excuses as to why their sons may do things that<br/>
aren&#39;t considered &quot;boy things&quot;.  I have known many gay teens/men growing up<br/>
and in my adulthood and it was quite common that many of them felt pressure<br/>
to be &quot;all boy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care what my children are or become as long as they are not being<br/>
hurt, hurting others or the earth. As long as they are happy, I could desire<br/>
nothing more...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My sister worked at the Spirit Halloween store this year, and she had<br/>
lots of great stories to tell. One was about a little boy, maybe 4 or 5,<br/>
who came in looking for a costume as one of the 7 dwarves. The store<br/>
either didn&#39;t have that one or was out of it, so he said, &quot;Okay, then I<br/>
want to be Snow White.&quot; There followed a long discussion between my<br/>
sister, the mother, and this little boy (an a good bit of it seemed<br/>
focused on what the kids at school would say, which was kind of sad, but<br/>
true). He left with a pair of wings and some plans to create a fairy<br/>
costume...<br/>
<br/>
She also had to deal with men wanting skin-tight rubber suits  that were<br/>
designed for women, and having to explain that there really was no room<br/>
for their ... genitalia in the suits... and then of course there were the<br/>
adults wanting brownie and catholic school girl outfits... it was quite<br/>
an education. Cacie throught it was a really cool job..<br/>

<br/>
I went to the store tonight with my mother so she could buy 3yo ds the winter <br/>
garb.  We&#39;d already found some, may I say, really cool mittens with a pocket <br/>
in the back and all....and then he found the fuzzy purple gloves with a star <br/>
of sequins and sparkly letters that spelled &#39;Princess&#39;. He was in love. Even <br/>
on the car ride home, after switching bags from grandma&#39;s car to ours he <br/>
said, &quot;Did we get that coat and stuff? Do we have those Princess gloves?&quot; :-)<br/>
