<div id="ygrps-yiv-421453377">We moved into this 3 bedroom house about 6 years ago.  One bedroom became<br/>
the girls&#39; room, while the other became the guest room.  Over time, the<br/>
guest room became a sort of playroom.  So the &quot;bedroom&quot; has both girl&#39;s<br/>
clothes and the &quot;playroom&quot; has toys.  Both rooms have books, dolls, and<br/>
other &quot;stuff&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Lisa (10) and Jackie (7)  continue to want to sleep together, but both have<br/>
expressed interest in having their own room for their things and as a<br/>
private space to be able to go.  However, Jackie does NOT want to move a<br/>
dresser with her clothes into her room.  This is a problem, because Jackie<br/>
strews clothes all over the room and the clothes happen to be in Lisa&#39;s<br/>
room.  I do pick up the clothes, but sometimes it is a few days until I can<br/>
get to it.<br/>
<br/>
Jackie says she would like to have her own stuff in her own room, and Lisa&#39;s<br/>
stuff out of her room, but insists on leaving her clothes in Lisa&#39;s room.<br/>
How can I encourage her to have her clothes in her own room?<br/>

younger than yours, don&#39;t want the responsibilities of having to deal<br/>
with clothing, so their clothes are with mine.  We just have one closet<br/>
(and it isn&#39;t that big, but extremely organized) with all the clothes of<br/>
everyone in the whole house (2 parents and 2 children).  It makes it<br/>
easier on us all.  Perhaps you could find room in your room for her<br/>
clothes?  She might not want them to get lonely.  :)<br/>

all their clothes.  Then again, they have a big laundry room.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

dresser in your room.  That way Lisa wouldn&#39;t have to put up with Jackie&#39;s <br/>
clothes?<br/>

clothes are in the office because I get up before the others who share <br/>
my room on work days. Could she have her clothes in the laundry room?<br/>
