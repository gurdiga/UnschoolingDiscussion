My concern would be in a few years when the kids are on their own. Their own <br/>
homes, their own lives. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;ll be like my friend, Elizabeth. She <br/>
went WILD---although she and her siblings were &quot;perfect&quot; all growing up. The <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me too, Kelly. My friend&#39;s oldest girl is married and expecting first <br/>
baby. Just got her Mary Kay car. Hubby making good money as computer <br/>
expert. She&#39;s been on her own for five years and nothing too out of <br/>
control,unless it is in the consumerism she and her husband display.<br/>
<br/>
Her son is going to college. He&#39;d be the one I most expect to see go <br/>
nuts, because he&#39;s gotten the most amazing accomplishments: youth <br/>
leadership, receiving awards from state senators, meeting the <br/>
gov...etc...  but so far he&#39;s just moving into the more intense <br/>
studies of the University (on a full ride scholarship)(which these <br/>
days to me, means he pretty much knows how to jump through the hoops <br/>
well enough to impress the Higher Ups, but still) Chose to stay home <br/>
and commute to class rather than dorm life. See...even as an 18 year <br/>
old, he prefers to be home. He had the choice of dorm or home...and <br/>
chose to stay home.<br/>
<br/>
The younger daughter is in sixth grade and so far, so good. Busy <br/>
right along with her mom. Not long ago, while my friend and I were <br/>
talking on the phone, the girl was cleaning out the fridge. Just got <br/>
up from her school work and started doing it after the phone <br/>
conversation got a little long. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see. Maybe there&#39;ll be some angst or some delayed self-<br/>
searching as they enter adulthood. So far, though, nothing like it.<br/>
