<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171805344">From time to time I&#39;ve thought of creating a big timeline for our house<br/>
because we have a variety of interests that come from times past (who<br/>
doesn&#39;t: ) and it would be nice to see them represented in that way.<br/>
Examples: Shakespeare (particularly a Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream), Colonial<br/>
America, The Sixties (hippies, music, culture), Henry David Thoreau<br/>
(Inspired by the beautiful book &quot;Henry Hikes to Fitchburg&quot;),<br/>
Impresssionism, Ice Harvesting.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine a very colorful, pictoral, layered thing....<br/>
<br/>
I guess it seems to me like a good idea (as always: ) to start with the<br/>
areas that hold a fascination for you and yours... don&#39;t be limited by<br/>
country etc.  Rrough it in with your passions and the details and<br/>
connections will follow!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reminding me of this -- I think I&#39;ll go begin hunting down the<br/>
big paper and the tape.<br/>
<br/>
a glorious day to everyone,<br/>
another Amy<br/>
<br/>
p.s. -- would the plural of taxi be taxis or taxies?  my husband and I<br/>
played scrabble last night and as dd read the board this morning it occured<br/>
to me that maybe I should have WON!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;It seems that there is always an answer out there for every question<br/>
&gt;so I thought I&#39;de try.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wanted to introducing American History to the kids and I have two<br/>
&gt;questions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    1.  Does anyone know of a good place to find an American History<br/>
&gt;timeline.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    2.  In your opinion, where is the best place in history to<br/>
&gt;start.  I&#39;ve read that history dosen&#39;t have to be taught in<br/>
&gt;chronological order, and then I&#39;ve read that it should so they know<br/>
&gt;what happened first or what caused the next thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for the help.<br/>

Thank you for your post.  The plural of taxi is taxis according to Funk & <br/>
Wagnalls Standard Desk Dictionary.  Must admit I had to look that one up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812842468">Thanks for all who got their dictionaries out for the Taxi question<br/>
<br/>
(I can&#39;t find ours)!  but I just talked to my dh on the phone and he looked<br/>
it up at work and his dictionary says that both are correct.-- taxis and<br/>
taxies -- perhaps the &quot;taxies&quot; is what an airplane does on the runway?...<br/>
anyway he did win.  I am happy to have developed a tolerance for this game<br/>
that he enjoys so much (we both broke 300!) -- yet another benefit of our<br/>
having recently disconnected our cable tv service. Our children do not<br/>
watch tv but dh and I had a night time habit that I am delighted to be free<br/>
of of.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307819155">Like any unschooling thing, I suppose the way I&#39;d go would be to <br/>
follow their interest.  If you wish to stimulate their interest in a <br/>
certain subject, or subgroup of a subject, then I&#39;d choose whatever I <br/>
was most interested in, so I could be enthusiastic about it &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Apart from that, I&#39;m English, so don&#39;t ask me about American <br/>
History &lt;g&gt;<br/>
