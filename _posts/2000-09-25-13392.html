<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232053892">Gee! al this talk about christmas is making me *homesick* for a REAL <br/>
christmas!<br/>
We put up a tree, but dont bother with decorations - though a lot of <br/>
people in New zealand are starting to put the lights up around the <br/>
outside of the house at christmas time - which i believe is an <br/>
American thing (?)<br/>
The school here are closed for 6-7 weeks summer holidays.  A large <br/>
number of families leave on boxing day (day after christmas)for their <br/>
yearly holiday - and this seems to take away the excitment <br/>
of &quot;christmas&quot;<br/>
Thanks again for all the fed back<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206593047">I tend to belive that the real meaning of christmas flew out of the <br/>
window a long time ago. It has become very commercial - and little <br/>
johnny  wants to make sure he got more presents than little fred next <br/>
door.<br/>
A lot of children dont even know what Christmas is all about, except <br/>
that it is a time to get presents...... <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this isnt the same in America, as I find most Americans seem <br/>
to be Christian and talk about the Lord a lot....could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
My birthday is on 22nd december. and it did seem to get lost in the <br/>
christmas rush - I will be 21yrs old AGAIN this year if any one is <br/>
interested!!!! <br/>
