<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932286490">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Our 6 3/4 year old son sleeps with us.  He does have his own room with<br/>
his own bed.   We spent our first night away from him this last<br/>
weekend.  He slept with his cousins, which he practiced a couple of<br/>
weeks ago on New Years weekend<br/>
when we were there also.  People kept saying that it will be easier for<br/>
him to not sleep with you if he starts sleeping on his own at home.<br/>
This issue wasn&#39;t him not sleeping with us, the issue was for him to be<br/>
able to sleep with others such as cousins or friends when they come over<br/>
to spend the night.  He had an okay night, cried a bit and worried that<br/>
we wouldn&#39;t be back.  His uncle listened and talked to him, said he<br/>
bored him to sleep.  Our son said he&#39;s willing to do it again.  His next<br/>
chance will be five days with grandparents and two other cousins on a<br/>
trip this summer.  We&#39;ll celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary then.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Sherry</div>
