Hi Bridget,<br/>
<br/>
I think it is great that you are exploring this issue rather than getting<br/>
mad and taking off.  If you read closely what you posted from<br/>
unschooling.com, it says the child may choose structure, the child may want<br/>
a time line, etc..  It doesn&#39;t say the mom decided the child needed to do<br/>
writing each day or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t about what the child does, it is about who chooses it.  I don&#39;t<br/>
even mean to imply that a child has to come up with the idea, most certainly<br/>
unschooling moms come up with great ideas to interest their kids (today we<br/>
learned how to shear goats at my suggestion!!).  The difference is in<br/>
whether the activity is required.  I might suggest making cookies or going<br/>
shopping or to the zoo, the kids are free to agree or decline.  That is the<br/>
difference.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Once again, I did not say they had to do this stuff daily.  We sat down<br/>
and hashed out TOGETHER some basic guideline for AMOUNTS of stuff that<br/>
should be done weekly.  Nothing is set in stone.  The guidelines also<br/>
include chores.  They were a direct response to statements of &#39;we aren&#39;t<br/>
sure what we should be doing.&#39;<br/>
