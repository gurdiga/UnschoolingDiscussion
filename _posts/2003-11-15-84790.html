<br/>
That is so great to hear about your son Jared reading :)It&#39;s an <br/>
exciting thing for a mom to witness - it&#39;s such a joy !!<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that my son has just started to try to read.<br/>
<br/>
My son Joey is 7 and has recently been asking what does this say <br/>
mom?? and that ?? What page are you reading now mom ?? This is <br/>
coming from a boy who in school didn&#39;t recognize letters. <br/>
Spontaneously he came to me the other day and said mom I know what H <br/>
& I spells it spells hi - he was watching the show called hi-five <br/>
LOL............Then the next day he was looking at a book that I <br/>
read to him the night before (a batman book).  He was flipping the <br/>
pages and he got to a page where they say Ha Ha Ha Ha !!! So he read <br/>
(correctly) that part for me to hear.  Then the other night we were <br/>
watching a show and this girl had a bikini bathing suite on with the <br/>
word RED SOX (one word on each breast)and for kicks and giggles I <br/>
asked him do you know what that says ??? And he answered RED <br/>
SOX !!!!!!!! I was shocked !!! I told my huband and my friend he&#39;s <br/>
starting to learn to read yeah !!!<br/>
My friend said that he recognized it because it was written in the <br/>
special letters that they always write RED SOX and he probably just <br/>
recognized it the way it was written and that he wasn&#39;t reading :(<br/>
My husband said I always watched the red sox with him that is why he <br/>
read it.  They bursted my bubble !!!! <br/>
<br/>
I asked my son how did you know that and said the same thing he <br/>
always does &quot;I guessed it &quot;<br/>
He tells me that for everything even when I know he figured a math <br/>
problem inside his head and gave me an answer. I think that is what <br/>
he says for when he figures something out. <br/>
<br/>
 Do you guys think that I am getting to excitied about him starting <br/>
to learn how to read ????<br/>

<br/>
And why is this NOT considered reading?  Just because it may or may <br/>
not have figured it out phontically, does not mean he didn&#39;t use <br/>
reading skills we all use.  What about sight words, those words that <br/>
can&#39;t be figured out with basic phonics?  Reading is as much looking <br/>
at and remembering words as it is sounding them out.  I hope this re-<br/>
inflates your bubble.<br/>
<br/>
This is how my 7 yods learned how to read as well: by reading the <br/>
satellite titles for TV shows, the scores on ESPN, signs we passed <br/>
while in the car, baseball cards...things that mattered to HIM.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It all counts!! Learning to read is not just phonics and sounding out <br/>
words. It&#39;s also sight words, patterns of letters, memorizing <br/>
favorite poems or stories and whatever works for your child. <br/>
<br/>
He amazed you at this new step he has taken. Go ahead and be excited, <br/>
just don&#39;t make too big a deal of it in front of him. Sounds like <br/>
he&#39;s on his way to becoming a reader. It WILL happen. Let him take <br/>
whatever time he needs to get all the way there.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<br/>
Kirby took about seven years to learn to read, if we count from the time he <br/>
could identify letters to the time I could leave him a note saying &quot;I went to <br/>
the store and will be back at 10:00.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some people do it really quickly when they finally do (Holly) and some drag <br/>
it out gradually while they do other things that are more important to them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914556193">Thanks for all your positive feedback to all of you<br/>
(Valerie, Mary and Sandra). Life is good ! I am excited and I should <br/>
be.  I think part of it was because I was witnessing the whole <br/>
unschooling thing and that is exciting also. I think I was saying <br/>
pinch me is this real ?? Thanks Sandra for sharing your experience I <br/>
will be excitied because I know everything will be okay.  I am <br/>
excitied to see things click for him on his on time table and not <br/>
the schools.  I am so happy that I&#39;m relaxed this year and decided <br/>
to try unschooling my eyes are open to so much more than I was a few <br/>
years ago - it&#39;s amazing how our perception can change.<br/>

Wow, I never really thought about it, but that is precisely what Bay&#39;s<br/>
process was like! At just 13 his only now actually coming into any kind of<br/>
real comfort with reading confidently and thoroughly. He was just too busy<br/>
mastering other things far more important to him - mostly in the physical<br/>
realm! Now, when he wanted to become certified in scuba diving, he picked<br/>
up the text and started in, including the chapter review questions -<br/>
multiple choice and short explanations. And, never took a test before,<br/>
either. And being the master of reminding me that education must be<br/>
relevant, he also never was much for math, either, until he wanted to bill<br/>
his clients on his landscape maintanence business or figure out the ration<br/>
of gas:oil for the mix on his dirtbike!<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve rambled, but that was another Sandra gem I just had to comment<br/>
and babble on!<br/>
<br/>
Love, Lee<br/>

book and passed first try. A lot of his schooled friends had to take it <br/>
more than once. It was the first test he ever took.  He had to get 80% to <br/>
pass and got 83%.  He said he would have done better but it read the <br/>
questions to him (they take it on a computer) and he found himself reading <br/>
them as well. That got him confused on a couple of them until he got used <br/>
to it.<br/>

<br/>
The first &quot;hard&quot; reading I saw Kirby do was a chapter with no illustrations <br/>
whatsoever in what is basicaly the textbook of the karate school he goes to.  <br/>
It was translated from Japanese, NOT written fluidly, and he needed to take a <br/>
test (same deal as Bay&#39;s need) which would have questions about the founder of <br/>
the school.<br/>
<br/>
Before that he had read game guides and Nintendo Power magazine, some little <br/>
choose your own adventure Mario books, but nothing specifically written for <br/>
adults which wasn&#39;t really colorful and flashy.<br/>
<br/>
I was driving him to karate, he was ten, and he was sitting reading that <br/>
chapter in the car.  I thought he would ask me a word or two, but he didn&#39;t.  <br/>
After he was in class and I was alone in the car with the book, I read it and <br/>
though it wasn&#39;t easy reading, he had read it because he had an actual need to.<br/>
<br/>
VERY interesting, and not something that people outside unschooling would <br/>
even want to hear or think about.  The prevailing belief would probably say that <br/>
Kirby couldn&#39;t read that because he hadn&#39;t already proven to someone else in <br/>
advance that he could, and be certified with grades somehow to read it.   <br/>
Stupid, I know, but just because millions of people believe something doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
it&#39;s not stupid.   They&#39;ve kinda taken &quot;motheecause I didn&#39;t think I was <br/>
qualified to understand something.  No physics without chemistry first.   No <br/>
reading William Blake because when I studied English I didn&#39;t choose to study that <br/>
and so I don&#39;t have approved access and a proper introduction.<br/>
<br/>
Someday I will be deschooled. &lt;g&gt;   At least I&#39;ve moved up to the college <br/>
level now to work on deconstructing the calcification formed then.<br/>
