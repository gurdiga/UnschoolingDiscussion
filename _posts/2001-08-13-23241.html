<br/>
I haven&#39;t chimed in on this discussion because others have been <br/>
saying, quite well, what I would if I did.  But I feel I must respond <br/>
to this.<br/>
<br/>
Certain African pastoralists knock out their children&#39;s incisors as <br/>
soon as they&#39;re fully grown in, to make their teeth look more like <br/>
their cows&#39;. . .it&#39;s a ritual of belonging (much like a bris), an <br/>
outward sign of their inward identity as a part of the tribe and a <br/>
very spiritually significant practice.  The same goes for those <br/>
tribes which cut their adolescents&#39; faces in interesting geometric <br/>
patterns and rub foreign matter into the cuts to keep them from <br/>
healing smoothly, leaving cicatrices (big, lumpy scars).  And for <br/>
those Polynesian groups that still use sharp shards of wood or bamboo <br/>
to imbed ashes mixed with a variety of other materials into their <br/>
young people&#39;s skins, creating colored patterns (tatoos).  And for <br/>
those that start putting rings aroung young girls&#39; necks when they&#39;re <br/>
very small, in such a way that they stretch them, adding more rings <br/>
as the girls age so that by maturity their necks are both <br/>
significantly longer and considerably thinner than any human neck <br/>
grows otherwise.  And for those in which a series of cylinders of <br/>
bone or horn of increasing diameter are inserted into the lower lip <br/>
and/or earlobes until they stretch into long, loose loops of skin. <br/>
Ritual body modification for the purpose of distinguishing members of <br/>
one group is a far from isolated practice.<br/>
<br/>
Still, the fact that any given modification is accepted and widely <br/>
practiced among the members of a particular ethnic group or sect, and <br/>
considered by adult members of that group to be acceptable or even <br/>
necessary for socio-religious reasons, does not change its nature. <br/>
If your next-door neighbor invited you over to watch and cheer while <br/>
he used a rock to knock a couple of teeth out of his adolescent son&#39;s <br/>
head, would you?  What if he said, &quot;We really don&#39;t have any choice. <br/>
It&#39;s a Masai ritual (I don&#39;t consider it mutilation),&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Does he have a right to do it?  Well, that&#39;s a complicated question. <br/>
Is it, however well-intentioned, still mutilation?  That&#39;s a simpler <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
If your kid fell down and knocked out a couple of teeth on the <br/>
sidewalk, it&#39;d be an injury.  If you did it, it still would be.  If <br/>
your kid had a freak accident with power shears and snipped of the <br/>
end of his penis, it&#39;d be a terrible, painful, bloody, disfiguring <br/>
wound.  And if you have a religious official do it with a sharp rock <br/>
or scalpel, IT STILL IS.  If you&#39;re cutting off, scarring, burning, <br/>
or torturously reshaping a chunk of your kid&#39;s body, you&#39;re <br/>
mutilating it, just as much as would be any other force which did the <br/>
same thing.  Even if you have a &quot;good reason&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a personal attack against you, and certainly not one <br/>
against Judaism.  The &quot;I don&#39;t have a choice&quot; argument has been used <br/>
as a justification for any number of actions by people who claim they <br/>
would otherwise not have taken them, and it REALLY bugs me.  Social <br/>
or religious pressure is not an excuse for not fully considering all <br/>
the ramifications of any choice you make, and certainly not a license <br/>
to deny responsibility for them.<br/>

Well as I would have to say that your points are far fetched and much much more &quot;tribal&quot; than cirrcummsision.  I am Jewish (very reformed)  When my son was born, it was no question, although my sis-in-law was shocked and disgusted.  I didn&#39;t know anyone that wasn&#39;t circumsized and thought about not doing it, then thought, why not?  3000 years of history and all the men  managed to do just fine with out that foreskin.  I really didn&#39;t want my son standing in the locker room wishing that he looked like the rest of the  guys.  Or like his dad for that matter(who is not jewish).  What about his girl friends and wife?  I don&#39;t know if I would have touched one that wasn&#39;t &quot;cut&quot;.  As far as all of those rituals that you mentioned, especially that statement about the kid cutting off the tip of his penis, you must not have paid any attention to the previous post.  About the loving and gentle ritual.  no body tied down a kid and snipped off the tip of his penis, there is little bleeding!<br/>
 and not much pain.  Less I think than those vacc&#39;s we give them in their thigh.  It is still a tough choise...what would your son do if he weere able to choose?  Oh...what if he wants it done latter in life?  That is much more painful!  I cried at the sound of my son whimpper, but then he stopped and knd of giggled at the face of his grandfather and all was over.   It is a matter of choise and all should be respected for their choise...I am sure that whatever someone chose, it was in what they believed to be in the best intrest of THEIR  child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-338632643">I didn&#39;t chime in on this one because we&#39;ve been down this road before and<br/>
don&#39;t want to get into religion but one comment you made is rather<br/>
hypocritical!  &quot;tribal&quot;  That tribal culture and beliefs is just as old as<br/>
yours, if not older.  What makes your &quot;tribal&quot; rituals more acceptable and<br/>
less open to contempt?<br/>
<br/>
We have 9000 years of history and our men have done quite nicely with their<br/>
foreskins, but then our &quot;god/diety&quot; has never asked for any form of<br/>
mutilation.<br/>
<br/>
The whole locker room argument is a non-argument.  Men don&#39;t go around<br/>
staring at each other to see if they are or aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
And the point about *you* not wanting to touch someone who isn&#39;t<br/>
circumcised, well, that would appear to be a personal hang up and certainly<br/>
not any justification for someone else to be multilated!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-142714542">There are cultural groups that circumcise their girls.<br/>
<br/>
This is illegal in the USA and people have been charged for it, or given<br/>
political asylum in the US because of its being done in other countries (I<br/>
think that is the correct wording I am looking for - I am on little sleep<br/>
right now  - baby is teething!).<br/>
<br/>
It is just a very touchy thing here - some cultural/religious things are OK<br/>
here, others are viewed as &quot;primal&quot; or hideous.  Where is the line drawn?<br/>
Why is it not OK to circumcise a female, but it is Ok to circumcise a male?<br/>
<br/>
And its not OK to bind feet.<br/>
But it is OK to pierce a baby&#39;s ears, that is, if it is a girl.  Though they<br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t bring you up on charges if you pierced your son&#39;s ear(s),<br/>
they very well may if you pierced his tongue.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all very confusing to me.<br/>
As far as if a child looks like the others, circumcision is not as common<br/>
anymore as one would think.  I think it is around 45% of boys are not<br/>
circumcised.  Out of the 20 some little boys I know from my mom&#39;s group or<br/>
are related to, only 2 are circumcised.  Granted it may be the region I&#39;m<br/>
in.<br/>
Circumcision reduces the amount of sensation in the penis for the man<br/>
(something I&#39;m sure some women would argue is a good thing LOL), and from my<br/>
personal experience, uncircumcised men feel a lot better to the woman :)  I<br/>
find it odd that someone would think an uncircumcised man would be a<br/>
turn-off.  Erect it looks almost identical.  But it does feel better in all<br/>
the right places.<br/>
The extra &quot;bulk&quot; I guess from the foreskin being pulled back happens to be a<br/>
benefit in stimulating the G-Spot... I wonder if why so many women have<br/>
trouble orgasming during intercourse could be due to whether or not their<br/>
mate is circumcised? Don&#39;t know, but I do know it was in my case.  It would<br/>
be interesting to find out though.<br/>
<br/>
Probably more than you wanted to know, but had to comment on that.<br/>

My first long-term sexual partner was uncircumcised.  He was Indian, and <br/>
Hindu, and they just don&#39;t, and never have.   <br/>
<br/>
The head of an uncircumcised penis is soft and tender, and in a mucus <br/>
membrane state pretty much.  The head of an uncircumcised penis is more like <br/>
the skin on the palm of your hand.  They need more stimulation to get the <br/>
same effect that gentle touch gives to the uncircumcised.  This can very <br/>
likely be creditted with some of the roughness and pornography in America <br/>
today.   A physical change was made in a culture with no commentary, no <br/>
cultural change, just &quot;it&#39;s better&quot; &quot;it&#39;s cleaner&quot; (NOT true) &quot;You have no <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-309337438">There are many forms of female circumcision, one form is the removal of only<br/>
the prepuce.<br/>
Another is to also remove the glans, but there is still the rest of the<br/>
clitoris there.  (these are both the &#39;sunna&#39; circumcision)<br/>
Other forms of female mutilation is to cut out the clitoris and scrape the<br/>
area, and to close up the area so only a tiny hole for urine and blood to<br/>
escape remain.<br/>
<br/>
The case I was remembering they only removed the prepuce.<br/>
<br/>
clitorectomies were done in the US up to the early 1900s to cure<br/>
&quot;nymphomania&quot; (any interest in sex) and was a respected medical procedure.<br/>
There was even a doctor in the 70s offering female circumcision (I believe<br/>
he was actually cutting the glans) in Ohio to increase sexual satisfaction<br/>
for the woman... it never caught on, obviously, so it [robably didn&#39;t work<br/>
as he advertised .<br/>

nicking the hood of the clitoris through to scraping the genital area<br/>
smooth and suturing the remaining hole closed.<br/>

grandmothers, because girls have been circumcised for thousands of years in<br/>
their communities.<br/>
<br/>
I know a pair of sisters from Kenya, both of whom are circumcised.  Their<br/>
parents are a dentist and a social worker, not &quot;backbush&quot; or &quot;ignorant.&quot;<br/>
