  I have actually seen the opposite (from what the first poster said) in my childrens&#39; behavior.<br/>
<br/>
  Since we&#39;ve started unschooling and allowing our children to choose what they want, they&#39;ve been more relaxed and less violent.  I think they are feeling more content in themselves, less resentful toward me or their father.  They like alot of the anime stuff, Inuyasha, DragonballZ, Kenshin. But they also like alot of other stuff too, which includes not watching TV. <br/>
<br/>
  Their lives are much happier, fuller.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993512904">To put it simply, we&#39;re a Christian family. Mostly it&#39;d been Sabrina the Teenage Witch that we were concerned about that is explicitly witchcraft, as well as more mature shows like Buffy and Charmed. Then there are shows like Pokemon, Sailor Moon, Yu-Gi-Oh and others that deal with monsters, powers, and such.<br/>
 <br/>
Now though...we talk about it all more in context with our beliefs and keeping in mind that it IS fantasy and there is nothing wrong with the fantasy parts of it all...it&#39;s in losing a grip on what is fantasy and what is real and then seeking out the real parts described within the fantasy, which will lead to harm. <br/>
 <br/>
So they&#39;re welcome to watch...albeit still reluctantly on my part as I had a stronger conviction about things like that than my husband...<br/>

<br/>
Kirby and Marty have played out some cartoons and shows, but not violently.  <br/>
They&#39;ve played out the running around and hiding and character relationships <br/>
lots, when they were little.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has a very physical friend. Not one of my favorite people.  He&#39;s small <br/>
and has something to prove, always working out, always challenging the other <br/>
boys.  That&#39;s not from TV, that&#39;s from his personal insecurities and need for <br/>
attention and respect.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have lots of security, attention and respect, and I think that&#39;s why <br/>
they find no benefit from hurting other people.<br/>
<br/>
Because of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Kirby has been involved with a <br/>
karate school for many years.  Last year he was teaching a beginning class and a <br/>
very young boy (whose brother is Kirby&#39;s age) kinda muttered to himself &quot;Just <br/>
like Donatello!&quot; at some point and Kirby heard him.  He asked him if he liked <br/>
Donatello and Ninja turtles and the boy said yes, and Kirby said &quot;That&#39;s why I <br/>
started learning karate!&quot;   &quot;ME TOO!&quot; so now they&#39;re special friends.<br/>

Spiritual warfare is very real. I have  experienced it first hand within myself, and I have watched both my immediate and extended families go through it. <br/>

Acknowledging that these things exist is not a denial of Christ or His Deity. <br/>
 <br/>
Being a Christian isn&#39;t about following a particular denomination&#39;s doctrine. That is being a Pharisee, and something Jesus was totally against. So if a Catholic is upset over a Baptist&#39;s prayer for them, one prayed to God in Christ&#39;s name, then they do have something to be embarassed about. <br/>
 <br/>
In that same vein, keeping a child from being &quot;fanciful&quot; out of a belief that it is a &quot;have to&quot; of Christianity, without examining it then yes, there is a problem there. It&#39;s also being a legalistic Pharisee. It&#39;s also likely to push them towards the very thing you might be trying to avoid. But discussing it, keeping it in perspective, examining it for the truth and the lies within it...that&#39;s a whole different ball game. <br/>

<br/>
My oldest was 6 when he discovered Dragon tales.<br/>
<br/>
It really got to be &#39;too&#39; much fantasy play when EVERYTHING he did or said<br/>
was based on the show.  He was bringing the play into his &#39;real&#39; life.<br/>
<br/>
The show was banned for a short while. Now he can watch it and enjoy it<br/>
without it &#39;taking over&#39; his daily life.  It wasn&#39;t a good thing to watch if<br/>
he couldn&#39;t determine what was real and what was not.<br/>
<br/>
I also do not allow &#39;witchcraft&#39; play.  There is a difference between play<br/>

Well then you have beliefs and situations others here might not (probably few <br/>
do) and so the discussion can&#39;t really be neutral or objective.<br/>
<br/>
Satan could use this list as a vehicle, and so if your priority is protecting <br/>
your children from a very-real Satan, how will you know who and what to fear?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, it&#39;s the other way around. I am a Christian who &quot;got saved&quot; <br/>
almost 20 years ago at(how perfect is this) a Billy Graham Crusade. I <br/>
was a practicing and devout protestant (although very different with <br/>
my unschooling, nurse your kid til he&#39;s 5 type views) up until a year <br/>
and half ago when I started to unschool myself right into the <br/>
Catholic church. Cardinal John Henry Newman once said, &quot;To be deep in <br/>
history is to cease to be protestant&quot;.  He was a protestant <br/>
convert to the Catholic church. Anyway, I digress, as a protestant, <br/>
in many churches, I was taught that the Catholic church was <br/>
the &quot;whore <br/>
of Babylon&quot;.  Even the famous Left Behind Series has the anti-Christs <br/>
best pal some former Papal dude.  Anyway, there is WAY WAY more <br/>
prejudice from the Baptists (and other protestant groups) AGAINST the <br/>
Catholics than the other way around.  At Mass we pray for ALL <br/>
Christians whether or not they are Catholic, that we may someday be <br/>
unified as Christ wanted us to &quot;be one as my Father and I are one&quot;.<br/>
I lived that prejudice of which I speak. Worrying about my Catholic <br/>
friends when I was <br/>
protestant.  I have been a Catholic for a while now, and I am not <br/>
coming up against &quot;Baptists (protestants) are the vehicles of Satan&quot; <br/>
at church at ALL.  However, evangelical and fundamentalist friends <br/>
think I have joined the greatest cult of them all and have been duped <br/>
by Satan. Oh well. But protestants are taught not to ever investigate <br/>
Catholicism. If they did, many would be surprised.  I used to think <br/>
that people left the Catholic church for protestant churches or <br/>
nothing at all. Imagine my surprise when almost everyone I have met <br/>
has been an adult convert, from protestantism to catholicism.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh heh -- this reminds of the time when I was a kid, I visited a <br/>
Baptist church with friends.  My family was Catholic but seriously <br/>
lapsed.  And the minister put a bar graph up on an overhead <br/>
projector, showing the percentage of the U.S. population who were <br/>
Catholic, Episcopalian, etc.  He pointed to the (much smaller) bar of <br/>
Baptists and said &quot;These are the only ones going to heaven.  The rest <br/>
of these people (indicating other bars) are going to hell, unless we <br/>
reach them in time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I laugh about it now, but as a kid it caused me to spend a lot of <br/>
nights crying myself to sleep, worried over my parents&#39; salvation.  <br/>
So if Catholics don&#39;t think that Baptists are vehicles of Satan, <br/>
maybe they should reconsider their policy.  (Kidding -- really <br/>
kidding.  No, I&#39;m not bitter. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I joke about it because I don&#39;t fear it any more.  I have the same <br/>
lack of fear re: witchcraft play; I have a friend who is Wiccan, and <br/>
came to it from a Christian background.  Like any religion, there are <br/>
some Wiccan nuts out there, trying to cast harmful spells, but the <br/>
way that she approaches it is very balanced.  She&#39;s not out to cast <br/>
any spells, but to have rituals that help her honor nature and her <br/>
body (she&#39;s been chronically ill for 10 years and is finally getting <br/>
better, so honoring her body is a big thing).<br/>
<br/>
If Fisher is interested in something, I try to treat it the same way <br/>

that thing is compelling to him?  Lately he&#39;s been an Air Pirate who <br/>
can use simple spells (a la Skies of Arcadia, the Sega Dreamcast <br/>
game), and the whole fantasy is just gorgeous -- pirate ships with <br/>
full sails and jaunty blue flags, cruising through white fluffy <br/>
clouds and blue sky, swords glinting in the sun, and pretty blue <br/>
crystals that hold healing spells in them for when we need them.  I <br/>
can&#39;t blame him a bit for being enthralled with it all.<br/>

Well then you have beliefs and situations others here might not (probably few <br/>
do) and so the discussion can&#39;t really be neutral or objective.<br/>
<br/>
Satan could use this list as a vehicle, and so if your priority is protecting <br/>
your children from a very-real Satan, how will you know who and what to fear?<br/>
<br/>

So says your particular doctrine.<br/>

-=- So if a Catholic is upset over a Baptist&#39;s prayer for them, one prayed to <br/>
God in Christ&#39;s name, then they do have something to be embarassed about. <br/>

our churches&quot; is allowed in our churches. so they would shun Baptists <br/>
and any brand of &#39;protestantism&#39; that sung, danced, spoke in tongues <br/>
and basically kept people alive in the church. And yes, they did look <br/>
upon all of it as vehicles to Satan,  SO MUCH SO that the Archdiocese <br/>
had a fit when one new priest, a good ol&#39; Irish boy from Boston taught <br/>
my class how to sing &quot;Oh when the Saints Come Marching In&quot; because it <br/>
was considered a Baptist spiritual.<br/>

In one definition, yes Christianity could be said to use &quot;spirits&quot; and &quot;potions&quot; but an indwelling of the Holy Spirit and an indwelling of Satan or a demon.

 </span></blockquote>Actually, it&#39;s the other way around. I am a Christian who &quot;got saved&quot; <br/>
almost 20 years ago at(how perfect is this) a Billy Graham Crusade. I <br/>
was a practicing and devout protestant (although very different with <br/>
my unschooling, nurse your kid til he&#39;s 5 type views) up until a year <br/>
and half ago when I started to unschool myself right into the <br/>
Catholic church. Cardinal John Henry Newman once said, &quot;To be deep in <br/>
history is to cease to be protestant&quot;.  He was a protestant <br/>
convert to the Catholic church. Anyway, I digress, as a protestant, <br/>
in many churches, I was taught that the Catholic church was <br/>
the &quot;whore <br/>
of Babylon&quot;.  Even the famous Left Behind Series has the anti-Christs <br/>
best pal some former Papal dude.  Anyway, there is WAY WAY more <br/>
prejudice from the Baptists (and other protestant groups) AGAINST the <br/>
Catholics than the other way around.  At Mass we pray for ALL <br/>
Christians whether or not they are Catholic, that we may someday be <br/>
unified as Christ wanted us to &quot;be one as my Father and I are one&quot;.<br/>
I lived that prejudice of which I speak. Worrying about my Catholic <br/>
friends when I was <br/>
protestant.  I have been a Catholic for a while now, and I am not <br/>
coming up against &quot;Baptists (protestants) are the vehicles of Satan&quot; <br/>
at church at ALL.  However, evangelical and fundamentalist friends <br/>
think I have joined the greatest cult of them all and have been duped <br/>
by Satan. Oh well. But protestants are taught not to ever investigate <br/>
Catholicism. If they did, many would be surprised.  I used to think <br/>
that people left the Catholic church for protestant churches or <br/>
nothing at all. Imagine my surprise when almost everyone I have met <br/>
has been an adult convert, from protestantism to catholicism.<br/>

I&#39;m seeing fundamentalist Christian beliefs in Satan as fact being treated<br/>
as though it were a silly notion to be talked out of.<br/>

It&#39;s akin to asking a Christian how they can possibly believe in Jesus.<br/>

I&#39;m seeing Christian beliefs presented as fact.<br/>

That&#39;s akin to a Buddhist presenting reincarnation as a fact and that&#39;s why<br/>
we need to run our lives such and such a way and make such and such<br/>
decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Presenting religions beliefs like that isn&#39;t going to go any place helpful<br/>
either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613992000">Shyrley, yippee � how are you? All safe back home? Good to see your name<br/>
again! I agree with your point also. Pagans are extremely diverse.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Witchcraft and Satanism are not the same thing. Both witches and <br/>
Satanists get tired of explaining this one. Satanists worship Satan <br/>
who is a Christian creation/pantheon, witches worship the Horned God <br/>
and the Goddess.<br/>
Different things.<br/>

**Not having a distinct line between fantasy and reality is an integral<br/>
part of childhood.  It&#39;s important (and fun, which is also important).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247811193"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I also do not allow &#39;witchcraft&#39; play.  There is a difference between play<br/>
&gt;magic, super heroes,etc...  and witch craft where spirits and potions are<br/>
&gt;used.<br/>
&gt;Rose<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But if the play is different from the real thing, why not allow the play?<br/>
That&#39;s the part I don&#39;t get.<br/>
<br/>
TV witches are not real witchcraft.  Trust a real witch.  So why would play<br/>
based on that fantasy not be ok?<br/>
