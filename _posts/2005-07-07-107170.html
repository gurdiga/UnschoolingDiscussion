<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806610602">This is long and not very important.   If you don&#39;t read it that&#39;s fine.   If <br/>
you respond, PLEASE don&#39;t quote the whole thing.   I would wait and tell you <br/>
later, but I&#39;d surely forget, because it&#39;s not pressing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In todays word-a-day e-mail one of their sponsors had a little poem as <br/>
advertisement, and I liked it.   Kind of an advertising jingle by e-mail:<br/>
<br/>
Brains, brains, go away--unless we learn a bit each day. <br/>
Timely knowledge? We deliver. <br/>
Try it now! Your brain&#39;ll quiver: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://knowledgenews.net/s?s=aw070705">http://knowledgenews.net/s?s=aw070705</a><br/>
<br/>
So I looked it up.   You can get a one-month free e-mail sampler, but if you <br/>
join you have access to their archives and other stuff that actually looks <br/>
pretty interesting.   I&#39;ve spent more for worse, and this stuff wouldn&#39;t clutter <br/>
up the house.    So depending on your interests or your children&#39;s, and maybe <br/>
if you have grandparents itchin&#39; to buy you something educational for your <br/>
homeschooling, you might want to look at it.   It&#39;s $35.95 for &quot;life&quot; but you can <br/>
buy $10 gift memberships for friends, so if several people go together and <br/>
split the total it can be considerably less.   It doesn&#39;t show on the form but <br/>
when I copied and printed, it had a whole string of $10 extras, so I guess <br/>
they&#39;ll ask you again if you put one in.    <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not information that&#39;s not available otherwise, it&#39;s just organized and <br/>
spoon fed (and sometimes I don&#39;t mind spoon feeding if I get to pick the meal, <br/>
as it were, and e-mail&#39;s easy to ignore or delete if you get tired of it).   <br/>
Down below is the text you see if you sign on for the sampler.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s cheaper than Newsweek or Time, but with those you get the arts, popular <br/>
culture and sports, and you can read them in bed.     This you don&#39;t have to <br/>
renew.   They can throw you out of your membership if you don&#39;t keep the <br/>
e-mails to yourself (and your family, I&#39;m guessing, but didn&#39;t read all the fine <br/>
print).<br/>
