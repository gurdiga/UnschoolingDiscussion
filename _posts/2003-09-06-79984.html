<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065519252">This information might be late in the game for you but I have two relatives<br/>
who recently had this done.  My uncle had the stomach reduction and lost<br/>
about 200lbs and has had few and minor complications which he says were<br/>
nothing compared with his improved health.<br/>
<br/>
My brother went a different route and had a less drasic Lap-band installed<br/>
which is an inflatable band around the stomach that can be inflated or<br/>
deflated after the surgery with a simple office visit.  Because they don&#39;t<br/>
actuslly remove any tissue, the risks and discomfort of this option are<br/>
suposed to be less than with the reduction surgery.  If you want, you can<br/>
write me off list and I&#39;ll put you in touch with my brother.  He has lots of<br/>
info and would be happy to share it. I am praying for you.<br/>
