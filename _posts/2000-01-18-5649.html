<br/>

homeschooling, we have done lots of different things because I have found that,<br/>
once again, it is a matter of listening to yourself and your children and working<br/>
on what is best for you all at any particular time. There are no rules! There<br/>
have been times when we have been really busy with outside classes, times when we<br/>
have gone out the door as little as possible. There have been times when 1 child<br/>
has been busy, another not wanting any outside activities.<br/>
<br/>
There have been times when I felt the kids &#39;should&#39; be doing something. I don&#39;t<br/>
think it&#39;s too bad to explain to the kid why you want him (as a mother of 4 sons,<br/>
all children are &#39;him&#39; to me!) to do something, and come to some sort of<br/>
agreement. But if you then go ahead with the activity, be sure you listen and<br/>
watch and evaluate it. After a while you find that many, if not most, outside<br/>
activities don&#39;t really live up to your standards! Don&#39;t try to &#39;get the feeling<br/>
under control&#39; - just look at the activities available with a careful<br/>
scrutinising eye. Let yourself feel the feelings, but examine the reality, and<br/>
you will probably find the feelings will then change. If they don&#39;t, then you<br/>
must live in a place of fantastic opportunity, so clean out your spare room - we<br/>
all want to come and stay!<br/>

I agree with Carol. I find that we are constantly reinventing<br/>
ourselves--that there are times (like now) that we are extremely busy with<br/>
outside activities--this works for my 11 1/2 yo dd right now, but my 8 yo dd<br/>
loves to stay home and play play play! In our 6 yrs of homeschooling, there<br/>
have been times when we stayed home much of the time, and there have been<br/>
times when we are on the go daily.  It depends on interests, time and<br/>
energy...<br/>

This is one of the best perspectives I&#39;ve ever seen articulated.  It&#39;s so <br/>
difficult to make hard and fast rules, because that&#39;s just when you miss out <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have nothing against outside classes in general.  I do feel bad for<br/>
kids who spend 7 or 8 hours in school, then have two or three classes a<br/>
week.  When do they have time to just hang out?  I think well chosen<br/>
classes can be great for homeschoolers, but I don&#39;t see them as<br/>
essential.<br/>
<br/>
My philosophy of activities outside the home stems from laziness and<br/>
velcro kids.  I just don&#39;t seem to cope well when I&#39;m rushing all over<br/>
town.  I prefer a slower pace.  I do agree with some of the other posts<br/>
that there is a time for eveything.  My children are young and I expect<br/>
classes will be more important in the future.  (Maybe?)  Since reading<br/>
David Albert&#39;s &quot;And the Skylark Sings With Me&quot; I am trying to be more<br/>
alert to THEIR interests and offer those opportunities.  (Rather than<br/>
putting them in an activity because it is popular or bc I like the idea)<br/>
<br/>
However, I have come to the conclusion that many of those wonderful<br/>
classes do not give anything for our time and money that I can&#39;t do just<br/>
as well at home, especially with my younger children (7&4).  Like driving<br/>
to the library to listen to stories in a crowded group of noisy kids?  We<br/>
prefer checking out a big pile of books and cuddling up on the couch at<br/>
home.  We recently tried a music class where she spent a lot of time<br/>
waiting for her turn and got stage fright so bad on performance day that<br/>
she was in tears.  Meanwhile at home, she will listen and sing along to<br/>
favorite songs over and over and over.  Maybe I am too picky, but<br/>
everything we have tried so far is just too, well, &quot;schoolish&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The Velcro aspect: With #1, I did regular mom & kid activities at the<br/>
YMCA, etc, on up through a co-op preschool (which was actually great -<br/>
but that is for another post).  When she got to the age where most<br/>
classes are designed as &quot;drop off the kid&quot;, I would have to literally<br/>
peel her off my leg and drag her crying to the class.  (Even if the<br/>
viewing area was just a few feet away)  It didn&#39;t take me long to figure<br/>
I did NOT want to be doing that.  So periodically we would try again --<br/>
because there ARE a lot of appealing classes out there.  Or my learning<br/>
curve is really slow!<br/>
<br/>
We just started a gymnastics class for homeschoolers.  They have all ages<br/>
at the same time, start with a group warm-up, then divide into three<br/>
groups of 10.  The class is an hour, but seems to dominate an entire<br/>
afternoon by the time we get ready to go and include the 40 minute round<br/>
trip drive.  We are going to give it a couple of months before we decide<br/>
whether or not to continue.  (Since I have paid through February, :) )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-63739873">Hi Everyone,<br/>
    We just got back from our Minnesota trip and so I am catching up on mail <br/>
here.  (It was a wonderful trip!)  This thread caught my interest because I <br/>
also am not big on a lot of outside classes.  If my kids have a strong desire <br/>
to try something, I&#39;ll do what I can to help.  But they don&#39;t like to have <br/>
their days or weeks very scheduled.  <br/>
    I believe people, including kids, benefit from long expanses of time <br/>
which they have to figure out what do with.  Some of the things we do with <br/>
this time are: getting into long, leisurely discussions about all kinds of <br/>
things, talking out differences, reading for hours at a time, writing, <br/>
walking, listening to music, playing games, visiting family and friends, <br/>
throwing a football back and forth, riding bikes, using the computer, <br/>
drawing, painting, etc.  Our activities don&#39;t sound particularly impressive <br/>
but we enjoy our days and feel that they are our own.  <br/>
     We have occasionally taken classes and I am not against them but for us, <br/>
they have to be limited so as not to leave us without enough free time.  I <br/>
dislike activities when I feel that we are there to have fun and yet we&#39;re <br/>
not having fun.  What&#39;s the point?  I related so much to what Mary Ellen said <br/>
about how it was much more satisfying to check out library books and then <br/>
come home and read them rather than sit at the library for story time.  But I <br/>
know that everyone is different and some people really enjoy being on the go <br/>
a lot.  Every family has to find its own way and even then, each family <br/>
member has to have his/her nature respected.<br/>
