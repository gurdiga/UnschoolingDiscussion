<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117003063">Thought I&#39;d post this as I&#39;ve gotten a few emails asking about the allergy<br/>
stuff. I&#39;ll be barely on email for the next few weeks, and probably deleting<br/>
90% of digests, so if there&#39;s something you want me to see, please send it<br/>
to me personally and don&#39;t feel offended if I don&#39;t respond for a few days,<br/>
I&#39;ll be popping in and out of town for the next few weeks.<br/>
I&#39;m off today to go to my mom&#39;s house and throw her a fabulous 60th birthday<br/>
party (with a 50&#39;s &quot;Rock around the clock&quot; theme). Should be lots of work<br/>
and fun (hopefully). Then I&#39;ll be back for a few days, will probably hardly<br/>
get caught up with mail and I&#39;ll be off North for my DH&#39;s grandpa&#39;s 90th<br/>
birthday celebration. After a few days of visiting, I&#39;ll be back for a<br/>
couple of weeks, then off to the Portland area to do my first triathlon<br/>
since 1998. I&#39;m hoping to find some time between now and then to train for<br/>
this, LOL :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll most likely be back full-time in mid-June. Until then, I hope everyone<br/>
has a wonderful few weeks of spring!<br/>
