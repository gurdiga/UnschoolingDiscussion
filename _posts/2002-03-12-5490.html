<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750135875">This is going around...<br/>
<br/>
So prepare for two days of quiet.  If you find yourself pining for contact, <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;After the rumors that we then thought turned out to be &quot;only&quot; UK, I hunted<br/>
&gt;and found a yahoogroups for list owners and subscribed.  Well, tonight they<br/>
&gt;sent out word that YahooGroups in the USA will also be down, from Friday<br/>
&gt;night thru Sunday morning (so at least it&#39;s supposed to be less time than<br/>
&gt;UK).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you want to see the official message, go to the home page of yahoo<br/>
&gt;(http://www.groups.yahoo.com) it&#39;s a service announcement on the right hand<br/>
&gt;side.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I followed the link, clicked on another link &quot;for more information,&quot; <br/>
and found this notice:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Dear Yahoo! Groups Members,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Yahoo! Groups service will be down Friday March 15 9:00 PM PST <br/>
&gt;(GMT-8) as we move our servers to a new facility. We expect the <br/>
&gt;service to be back up the morning of Sunday March 17.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;During this time the web site will be unavailable and email will not <br/>
&gt;be delivered. (Some users may experience email non-delivery notices, <br/>
&gt;but all email should be delivered once service has resumed.) Please <br/>
&gt;note: once the service is back up, there will be email delays due to <br/>
&gt;backlog. We expect these delays to last no longer than 1 day. Please <br/>
&gt;do not re-send email to your group as it will only add to delays.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Yahoo! Groups Team </span></blockquote></div>
