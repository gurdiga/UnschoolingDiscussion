I usually cook an entire package of chicken or steak and put anything I<br/>
don&#39;t use today in the the fridge for future meals.  It probably wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
very hard to cook an extra piece of meat every day, chop it up and put it in<br/>
the fridge for the next days snacks.  Also, if you take the 2 minutes to cut<br/>
up the meat, it cooks in a fry pan in about 3 minutes.  Or buy a bag of<br/>
chicken nuggets and microwave a couple when you need them.  That&#39;s fast.<br/>

I have to say, I don&#39;t blame her for not eating those! :) I go through phases where I can&#39;t stand peanut butter.<br/>
Why don&#39;t you check at a health food store for some almond butter? It has less sugars than peanut butter, and it tastes a LOT better (my opinion of course).<br/>

My kids actually don&#39;t care for the blocks of tofu, but love dip made with<br/>
silken tofu.  I usually sprinkle a little salt into a carton of tofu, stir<br/>
it in well and put it in a coffee filter for about half an hour to let some<br/>
of the liquid drain off.  Then add some salsa and spicy black bean dip and<br/>
mix with a hand blender.  Serve with tortilla chips.  It&#39;s really good.<br/>
I&#39;ve also heard of making a peanut butter/tofu dip, but haven&#39;t tried it<br/>
yet.  I sometimes put tofu in smoothies on the sly, and have also added it<br/>
to banana muffins.  It makes them really moist and delicious!  Another good<br/>
protein-rich recipe we make regularly is natural peanut butter, soy sauce<br/>
and a little water.  Wisk it up and serve over pasta.  Tastes a lot like<br/>
sesame noodles.<br/>

By Fluff do you mean marshmallow cream?  We make fluffernutters sometimes.<br/>
Peanut butter and marshmallow cream sandwiches.  I don&#39;t care for them, but<br/>

and they stated they believed that healthy eating/living will <br/>
eventually heal the genetic damage and future generation will likely be <br/>

BBQ Pork is very sweet also. If you like meat that almost tastes like candy,<br/>
Honey Turkey Jerky is very sweet. Places like www.MahoganySmokedMeats.com<br/>
have a great mail order catalogue. The difference between jerkey from a<br/>
specialty company and jerky from the supermarket is phenomenal. One of the<br/>
things that dh and I love about our road trips is stopping at the different<br/>
little jerky places we pass along the highways. Jayn really likes various<br/>
jerkies also - especially when we are traveling in the car.<br/>

drained and cut into cubes! Of course, he&#39;s been eating this since he&#39;s been on <br/>
solids, so it might be an aquired taste, but I don&#39;t know. He also loves tofu <br/>
hot dogs-and I don&#39;t have to worry about him getting sick if he eats them raw! <br/>

favorites seem to be hand-shelled ones like pistachios and peanuts.<br/>

I have this recipe, I&#39;m making them today, for Cowboy Cookies. My kids eat them up! <br/>
<br/>
They have peanut butter(you can use any nut butter if she likes one a little more than the other), oatmeal, dried fruit, coconut, and chocolate chips. And you make them BIG, use a 2oz ice cream scoop. They are a meal in a cookie.<br/>
