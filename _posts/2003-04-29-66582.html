<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695129004">dunno what happened. I wrote a post, thought I posted it. It isn&#39;t <br/>
there, but my post about emailing Mrs. O&#39;Malley is. hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
I have a plan to help me get over my fear of Robby playing non-stop <br/>
computer games: ask him about it. We had &quot;Stay Up Alone Night&quot; last <br/>
night and the night before. Katie, last night; Robby night before. He <br/>
was up until 4:00 a.m. playing online video games. And yesterday, <br/>
spent a goodly amount of time playing online video games. And you <br/>
know what I did? Not only did I bite my tongue about how he was <br/>
spending his time, I went over and watched him play for awhile. He <br/>
explained the game (Some Ed, Edd, and Eddy thing) and asked if I&#39;d <br/>
like to try.<br/>
<br/>
It felt SO good, not to be uptight about what he was doing, and he <br/>
was clearly pleased that I expressed interest in it. <br/>
<br/>
Hubby and I talked last night, him wanting to know if this &quot;up alone&quot; <br/>
time was going to become a trend. I pointed out to him that the <br/>
last &quot;up alone night&quot; was in January or February. They love it; they <br/>
are satisfied for a long time (at least a few months between such <br/>
events); and we learn to trust them. <br/>
<br/>
One thing I did have to emphasize with my husband: this is going to <br/>
mean us being much more involved. No more telling them to siddown and <br/>
get their (fill in the academic blank) done, but inviting them to <br/>
come help with the wood fire, helping them knead the bread dough, <br/>
playing cribbage when they ask us to, being willing for the bathroom <br/>
to get trashed so they can make home-made &quot;treasure rocks.&quot; IOW, <br/>
chilling and doing things WITH them.<br/>
<br/>
Including, conversations about Tolkien with our 15 year old. Why do <br/>
I, whose favorite author IS Tolkien, just do this &quot;uh-huh&quot; half-<br/>
listening, not attending, rude thing, when she wants to talk about <br/>
LOTR? Just because it&#39;s all she talks about right now, doesn&#39;t mean I <br/>
shouldn&#39;t encourage it by participating. &quot;What a cool picture of a <br/>
balrog. Where did you get it?&quot;  &quot;Yes, let&#39;s get the latest Elijah <br/>
Wood movie and watch it.&quot;   Or, ask her, because she knows MUCH more <br/>
about Middle Earth than I do. Well, I do some of that. She laughs at <br/>
me, because I don&#39;t know the names of the different elvish races. L<br/>
<br/>
anyways. Feeling like I&#39;m getting a handle on this (unnerving, <br/>
exciting) way of living.<br/>
