<div id="ygrps-yiv-152340761">For those interested in donating, there is a place called Locks of Love. They give free wigs to kids who have suffered hair loss due to illness or chemotherapy. Their minimum length requirement is a 10&quot; ponytail or braid. <br/>
   Just a suggestion, if you don&#39;t have &quot;hair to spare&quot;, is to remind any haircutting friends to keep an eye out. Most people are more than happy to donate!<br/>
   Mail hair to:<br/>
Locks of Love<br/>
1640 South Congress Ave<br/>
Suite 104<br/>
Palm Springs,FL 33461<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s an idea.  Why not make up a flier with the name of the organization,<br/>
purpose and requirements for donation.  Then take it to your local<br/>
Barber/Beauty Shop and ask the stylists for thier assistance in securing<br/>
donations from their clients.  You could leave you phone number and ask<br/>
them to call when they have a donation for you to pick up and mail.  What<br/>
do you think?<br/>
