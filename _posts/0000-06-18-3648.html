<h4>The White&#39;s</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41856585">Faith,<br/>
I used a sling a lot with both of my children, more with the second because<br/>
I needed my hands free to do things with the older.  It is actually easier<br/>
on your back than carrying the baby because your body is in a more natural<br/>
posture.  Much like the &quot;papooses&quot; where you carry a child on your back for<br/>
hiking or lots of walking.  Seems it would hurt your back but it does not.<br/>
(I used a papoose a lot too, walking for exercise & even at the mall, one on<br/>
my back, one in the stroller).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if anyone has suggested it or not, but I would highly recommend<br/>
you read Dr. William Sears Baby Book....I called it my baby bible when my<br/>
first was born.  It has SO MUCH good info, about virtually anything from how<br/>
to wear a sling to how much tylenol to give.  I think Dr. Sears must be the<br/>
&quot;father of attachment parenting&quot;  as he seems to be the foremost authority.<br/>
He has lots of other books too, but the Baby Book might be one you invest in<br/>
to keep at home.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with it all....sometimes it is overwhelming but you&#39;ll be<br/>
surprised how well you handle it IF YOU FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087397628">For my first baby we just held him, not only did we have the unused cot we<br/>
had the unused pushchair too&lt;g&gt;, then with baby 2 we learnt the joys of<br/>
having a sling, thank Kerry, i was able to actually do things and hold a<br/>
baby at the same time WOW!!!!  onto baby 3 we do a mixture of both because<br/>
now i like to use the excuse of not doing anything because i am holding the<br/>
baby, lol!!!!!!!<br/>

the long white cloud) it is a &quot;the origanal baby sling&quot;.</div>
