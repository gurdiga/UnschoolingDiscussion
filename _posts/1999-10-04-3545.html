<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677907795">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just *have* to come out of lurkdom to say more about GKGW and Ezzo in<br/>
general.  I haven&#39;t intro&#39;d myself yet but I will in a subsequent post.<br/>
<br/>
Erin is positively diplomatic about her understated reply, but I&#39;ll go<br/>
further and say PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don&#39;t fall for &quot;GKGW&quot;.  It&#39;s a huge<br/>
wrongheaded, uninformed, insidious, criminal (yes, really--in the UK they&#39;re<br/>
considering investigating the Ezzos for child abuse if they try to spread<br/>
the dogma over there) dangerous movement that skates right on the edge of<br/>
child abuse and seems to have sprouted and grown and taken over parents&#39;<br/>
natural instincts.<br/>
<br/>
Following the Ezzos&#39; program has landed many many babies in NICU for<br/>
dehydration, failure-to-thrive, etc. and given children longterm trust and<br/>
food psychological problems.  The AAP, and even Dobson and Ferber, if you<br/>
can believe it, have come out against Ezzo, Babywise, and its more extreme<br/>
counterpart, GKGW.<br/>
<br/>
I can give you websites on or offlist if you want, and real cites, to<br/>
journal articles, etc. that document and take apart the multitude of<br/>
problems with Ezzo.  Please, Faith or anyone else who&#39;s thinking of<br/>
&quot;following&quot; Ezzo, contact me and just hear many pediatricians&#39;,<br/>
psychologists&#39;, and other relevant professionals&#39; thinking on how unwise<br/>
&quot;Babywise&quot; is.<br/>
<br/>
Am I identifying myself too much here? :)<br/>
<br/>
O.K., I&#39;ll do the official intro now.<br/>
In all seriousness about the Ezzo issue,<br/>
Carolyn<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I agree with this statement 100%.  I&#39;ve been doing some research on this <br/>
movement and it&#39;s very scary.  Many of these people behave very cultish.  I&#39;m <br/>
doing what I can to disuade people I encounter from getting caught up in <br/>
these teachings.  The folks I&#39;ve met want so desperately to do the best for <br/>
their children.  Ezzo claims that it&#39;s &quot;God&#39;s way&quot; and it can be hard for <br/>
parents to say no.<br/>
<br/>
There are several websites which deal with the scriptural inaccuracies and <br/>
medical dangers of their program.  As has been stated, several well known <br/>
church leaders and the Ezzo&#39;s own church have denounced them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-313982622">I would like to thank you for the advice and the articles.  I have read them<br/>
fully and feel deeply sorry for those poor parents.  I myself had never heard<br/>
any controvery on this issue other than from child-centered parents, which I am<br/>
not, nor do I want to become.  I definately will be looking into the sites you<br/>
recommended.  This has definately sparked my curiousity.<br/>
<br/>
But, my husband and I believe firmly in the teachings we learned in GKGW.  We<br/>
have only taken that class.  A friend of mine loaned me her book &#39;Preperation<br/>
for Parenting&#39;.  I have read only bits and peices out of it.  I have tried some<br/>
of the feeding methods on my 2-1/2 month old and she is thriving fine.  But it&#39;s<br/>
probably due to the fact that she was a chunk to begin with and remains over the<br/>
95 percentile in all: height/weight/head circ.  She has started sleeping at<br/>
night for longer periods of time, but not all the way till 8am.  I am not strict<br/>
at all with what I have read in that book.  Although I certainly do not<br/>
feed-on-demand, I also know the sound of an &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; cry, and I will not<br/>
hesitate to feed her even if it hasn&#39;t been the full amount of time.<br/>
<br/>
I think, as with everything in life, one needs to take into context each<br/>
individual situation and go from there.  The Ezzo&#39;s repeat this continuously<br/>
throughout the course.  There is only one thing that I follow religiously (I<br/>
hate that word) and that is my relationship with Jesus Christ.  Period.  Other<br/>
than that I take things as they come and use advice from here and there.  But I<br/>
always compare it to what Scripture has to say.<br/>
<br/>
I DO NOT beat my kids, and I know no one was accusing me of this, but the Ezzo&#39;s<br/>
also do not tell anyone to do this.  There is a severe difference between<br/>
beating and spanking.  And, they teach spanking as a last resort punishment for<br/>
wrong behavior.  The articles I read made it sound that at the slightest thing<br/>
your children do wrong you take out your club and beat them.  That is not what<br/>
they teach!    My husband and I learned a variety of ways to teach and train<br/>
your children to obey, yes, first time obedience.  For the non-christians out<br/>
there this will not mean anything to you, but for those of you who are the<br/>
child-parent relationship is the training ground on how obedient we are going to<br/>
be to God.  If we can&#39;t obey our parents the first time they speak, why would we<br/>
obey a God we can&#39;t even see the first time He speaks.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the things said about the Ezzo&#39;s in the articles were about the<br/>
discipline part of everything but they also have a lot of neat ideas on how to<br/>
make it easier for your children to obey.  Like the 5 minute warning.  It&#39;s used<br/>
for things like dinner.  Give your kids a 5 min. warning just to let them know<br/>
dinner&#39;s in 5 min. pick up toys in 5min. and it&#39;s easier for them to wind down<br/>
what they are doing and more likely they will obey when you say &quot;ok, time to<br/>
pick up/time for dinner&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think that before anyone is to slam something they need to read it first and<br/>
then judge for themselves.  That is what I am going to do.  Since I have already<br/>
read through the Ezzo&#39;s material I have the right to judge for myself and<br/>
research on these issues and say good or bad what I think.  Again, thank you for<br/>
the insight that there was more to this than what I had heard.<br/>

In your post you said something about Dobson not agreeing with the Ezzo&#39;s.<br/>
Could you please let me know where you found that info.  I very much respect Dr.<br/>
Dobson and I would like to read what he thinks about GKGW.  Thank You. :-)<br/>
