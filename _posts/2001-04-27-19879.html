&lt;&lt; I was bitten by a huge shiny black spider years ago. We were living in a<br/>
woodsy area here in WA state where&#39;s there&#39;s both recluses and widows. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If it was black and shiny, it wasn&#39;t a brown recluse.  <br/>
They&#39;re smaller and dull looking.  When they walk they put most of their legs <br/>
in front and pull themselves along weird-like.<br/>
<br/>
The scariest are wolf spiders.  We saw a HUGE one one day a few years ago, <br/>
crossing a dirt road (near Placitas, for the New Mexico readers, at the north <br/>
end of the Sandias).  It was like something from a monster movie, or a <br/>
scary-spider cartoon.  It was like my hand and the legs bigger than my <br/>
fingers (and more OF them)---black and orange and brown.  It was a glorious <br/>
piece of biology.  I think we could have safely picked it up but we safely <br/>
just watched it walk away!!!<br/>
