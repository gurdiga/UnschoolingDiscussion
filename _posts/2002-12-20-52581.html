<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228279909">I just told my husband last night that I plan on invalidating the tests this year.  He didn&#39;t have any protests. (phew)<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing though, twice now he has shared with me what he tells his friends about me in situations involving school and healthcare...LOL.  He tells them things like &quot;If that had been MY wife, she would have told *them* the where and the what for&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
LOLOLOLOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
I guess he&#39;s accepted being married to a non-conformist.  Wonder when *that* happened LOL.<br/>

<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

 But these tests are given all the time to students.  Teachers tell them how <br/>
 they are &quot;special&quot; and they WANT to take them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I think tests are a CROCK.<br/>
It serves to compare a person to other people, which I see NO point in for <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
None of my kids have ever taken any kind of written test. They never will <br/>
until they want/need it for something. This really appalls people when I say <br/>
they&#39;ve never been tested. &quot;How do you know where they are?&quot; is the common <br/>
question.<br/>
Let&#39;s see:<br/>
Trevor just learned &quot;Closing time&quot; on his guitar, he is starting to learn <br/>
recorder (his request this week) plays Yugioh and Mage Knight incredibly <br/>
well. THAT&#39;S where he is.<br/>
Jared draws with abandon, plays Phantasy Star online better than anyone else <br/>
we know and is passionate about his Rat. That&#39;s where HE is.<br/>
Sierra reads beginner books to me, she loves Barbies, making mud, singing and <br/>
dancing. That&#39;s where SHE is.<br/>
Jalen follows Sierra everywhere, is starting to talk, loves digging for <br/>
potato bugs and helping in the garden. That&#39;s where he is.<br/>
Where else should they be?<br/>
And that&#39;s just the tip of the iceburg. I&#39;d hate for them to be compared to <br/>
other people and think there is something wrong with them for not being <br/>
interested in the topics that a test says you should be good at.<br/>
There&#39;s just nothing like individuality that feeds the soul.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
