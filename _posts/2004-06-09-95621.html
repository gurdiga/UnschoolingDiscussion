When I spell checked - horrible speller, thank goodness for that feature- I<br/>
wrote &quot;unschooling&quot; as &quot;uncoiling&quot;  It comes out weird - but perhaps more<br/>
accurate in the sense of unwinding and unspiriling.<br/>
<br/>
OK I&#39;ll stop, my daughter wants to learn about Australian Bilbies on the<br/>
computer.<br/>

&quot;You could support her in her decision to let<br/>
<br/>
her learn how she wants, while letting her know that<br/>
<br/>
she can come home any time she wants -- for a day, a<br/>
<br/>
week or forever -- and you will be thrilled to have<br/>
<br/>
her. Keep home a really interesting, safe, loving<br/>
<br/>
place. Take her side in any conflicts she has with the<br/>
<br/>
school, while keeping in mind that she may have<br/>
<br/>
important relationships with adults there that she<br/>
<br/>
doesn&#39;t want damaged. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That is such a loving, sweet take on public or private school.<br/>
Unfortunately, I feel it is a bit idyllic.  A child cannot go home whenever<br/>
he or she wants. Even when my nephew was having asthama and wanted the<br/>
school to call his mom, the school &#39;assessed the situation and decided the<br/>
call was unwarranted.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When your children are in public school (2 of my kids have been), the parent<br/>
looses the ability to parent the child while the child is on the school<br/>
premises.  Sometimes depending on the teacher there is collaboration, but<br/>
most often the rules, attendance requirements (a tardy officer from the<br/>
state may visit your home), discipline (you missed the work while you were<br/>
out yesterday, so no recess for you) are in motion whether you as a parent<br/>
are aware of it or not.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My view is that if you are uncoiling, then do it.  That encompasses a<br/>
certain &quot;lifestyle&quot; in which you support your children in perusing their<br/>
goals.   If your children are in public school, as a parent you must do the<br/>
same; make sure they are there on time, have money or a sack lunch ready,<br/>
help them have a place for homework (20 min. per grade, excluding spelling<br/>
practice and extra projects) and give them the support to finish projects on<br/>
time, etc...  The child will suffer at public school if the parent is not<br/>
involved.  For unschooling families, the involvement may be too intrusive.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My kids do NOT want to go back to public school.  They experienced it.  I do<br/>
agree with you that for children who want to experience school, the parent<br/>
should support the child&#39;s decision.  But be aware: the decision has &#39;rules&#39;<br/>
attached to it that may affect the parent&#39;s role.<br/>
