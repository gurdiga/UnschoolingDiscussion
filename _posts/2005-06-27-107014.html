<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love online dictionaries--in Word or using google, but now I have a new Mac <br/>
with a dictionary in its &quot;dashboard,&quot; and I&#39;m dictionary rich.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Holly   has discovered and is loving real paper dictionaries and <br/>
has had a lot of fun with my American Heritage, the one with &quot;the f- word.&quot;   I <br/>
think all kids who play with dictionaries at all have looked up &quot;the bad <br/>
words,&quot; and that dictionary has &#39;em all.     <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a movie recently on DVD called Orgazmo (with a &quot;z&quot; which doesn&#39;t help <br/>
with the spelling pattern).   It&#39;s by Trey Parker, who does so many of the <br/>
voices on South Park.   It&#39;s ridiculously silly, but for families who don&#39;t mind <br/>
humor of a sexual and religious and social nature, it&#39;s entertaining.   <br/>
Probably not for younger kids.    Most people would hate it for being a bad movie <br/>
and being &quot;about something nasty&quot; I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
Trey plays the lead.   He&#39;s a Mormon missionary whose mission is nearly <br/>
finished, and he wants to have money to marry his girlfriend back in SLC, and is <br/>
offered a job in a film.   Turns out it&#39;s a porn film with a superhero named <br/>
&quot;Orgasmo.&quot;   The movie (both the larger movie and the film-within-a-film) has Ron <br/>
Jeremy.   I had known nothing about Ron Jeremy before, but Kirby told me he <br/>
was some actual porn guy who&#39;d been in more movies than anyone including <br/>
Christopher Lee.   Also at Netflix was a documentary about Ron Jeremy, so we got <br/>
that and Keith watched it, and I watched it, and Kirby watched it (none of us at <br/>
the same time, which might have made it easier to bear).   I&#39;m not <br/>
recommending it as something anyone needs to or should see, just showing another example <br/>
of how one thing led to another.<br/>
