<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192084488">Hi, Nanci.   Ah, the secret handshake - &lt;smile&gt;   Okay here ya go,  dd is dear<br/>
or darling daughter, ds dear/darling son and dh is for hubby.  :-)   Their are<br/>
some other more exotic ones for mother in law, sister in law, etc.  I forget<br/>
what the ones for mother and father are?<br/>
    Someone mentioned they were the only CA person here?  I am also from CA, a<br/>
native, but did spend 4 years in WA, when I was real young.  But mostly grew up<br/>
in So CA, 1 mile from D-land and moved to Nor CA in high school.   Of course,<br/>
you wouldn&#39;t know it was still CA, our weather has been so cold and windy and<br/>
rainy the past 2 years.  Today is is cold, cloudy and windy, with a little<br/>
sun.  Just waiting for summer,  a CA beach girl here, Shannon<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-782748811">Hi Shannon,<br/>
	That was me who thought I was the only one from CA, but as I said, <br/>
I&#39;ve been flying through all of the bios here.  Glad to see someone else from <br/>
the Golden State.  What part of No. CA are you in?  And, do I know you from <br/>
the CAHomeschool list?  I&#39;m in the Santa Cruz Mountains myself.<br/>
