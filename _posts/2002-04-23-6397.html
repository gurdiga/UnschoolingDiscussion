&lt;&lt; If a person wants to take a class, he or she will set an alarm and get <br/>
there. <br/>
  The more they want to take it, the more likely they&#39;ll arrange their lives <br/>
 around it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have found this to be true over and over again!!  My 12yo ds got a radio/CD <br/>
player for Christmas with a built in alarm.  I never even showed him how to <br/>
use it, but it gets used quite often because he is a late night person and <br/>
wants to get up in the morning for various reasons.<br/>
A few years ago he borrowed an alarm to help him get to a neighbors house on <br/>
time because she was paying him to help out around her yard.  I never <br/>
reminded him what time he&#39;d have to be there, or how dissapointed she might <br/>
be if he weren&#39;t on time.<br/>
The whole idea to get the job had been his, he worked out the payment <br/>
arrangement with her and the motivation to get there was strong.<br/>
She hired him several times over that year before we moved into town, because <br/>
he was entirely dependable and worked hard.<br/>
It is totally natural for humans to desire wages and access to the world <br/>
through work.<br/>
Assisting my kids in finding something they love to do is not a worry for me <br/>
at all.<br/>
I know that all my work experiences had NOTHING to do with my years in HS. <br/>
Not one class I took, not one test, not one iota of anything I did there <br/>
affected a single job I&#39;ve had since then.<br/>
That isn&#39;t true for everyone. But it does make a person question the sanity <br/>
of &quot;preparing&quot; a 16 y.o. for a vocation.<br/>
I had no clue what I wanted to do with my life then.<br/>
I still change my mind quite a bit.<br/>
Motivation/desire is the only way to true success in my opinion.<br/>

This is a link to a webpage about an unschooler that learned her <br/>
multiplication tables for the purpose of making the college entrance exam <br/>
easier on herself.<br/>
She took higher level math and excelled at college....she has graduated now <br/>
and with almost a 4.0 grade average.<br/>
I only put this here to encourage anyone with questions about &quot;preparing&quot; <br/>
children to see another side of this.<br/>
I think it is shortsighted to think we can help impart a body of knowledge <br/>
that they will use for life.<br/>
Desire will help them seek any knowledge they need....and our job then, as it <br/>
is now, is to be an avenue to the information they need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205204566">I thought I&#39;d add a little something to the discussion of parental <br/>
pressure.<br/>
<br/>
There is a danger when applying parental pressure.  Perfectionists <br/>
are people who have been molded by parental pressure. These people <br/>
have learned to perform to standards other people have set.  They <br/>
have a very difficult time feeling satisfaction with their lives <br/>
because they are striving to reach someone elses goals.<br/>
<br/>
*I* had a difficult day today.  I run a sign language club where we <br/>
play games to learn sign language.  More people showed up for the <br/>
meeting than I had planned for so the games had to be modified.  It <br/>
was not perfect. <br/>
<br/>
What could have been a very enjoyable afternoon with other <br/>
homeschoolers was very stressful for no reason other than my <br/>
perfectionism. I decided to do some research and see if I could get <br/>
some pointers on how to reduce my stress.<br/>
<br/>
What I found after doing a search on Google was helpful and very <br/>
interesting.  Most of the sights on the first page of the search were <br/>
from Universities.  The information was for their students struggling <br/>
with perfectionism.  It appears perfectionism is a problem for <br/>
college students.  I wonder why? (rhetorical question)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone struggling with perfectionist tendencies or questioning <br/>
whether children *need* parental pressure might enjoy reading a <br/>
commencement speech by Anna Quindlen at the following address:<br/>

<br/>
Are we as parents willing to risk turning our children into <br/>
perfectionists in order to give them some future advantage that they <br/>
themselves have not decided they want?<br/>
<br/>
I think all children need is parental *insight* and support. I hope I <br/>
can offer this to my children without them feeling any pressure.  <br/>
<br/>
This is difficult for me because as a perfectionist I worry about <br/>
what other people will think I should be doing.  I also have a <br/>
tendency to want everyone to achieve to my overly high standards.<br/>
