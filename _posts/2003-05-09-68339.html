<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292435664">&lt;&lt;I wanted to be mad at him for telling Sam to take that approach, but<br/>
everyone was laughing so hard that I just started laughing too.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOL!  I know the feeling!  Sometimes, a break from all the seriousness <br/>
really helps.  I think *my* husband does it a little too much but he manages <br/>
to lighten up the mood every time.  Thankfully, not always quiet so, how <br/>
shall I say, vulgarly?  Hmmm, is that a word?? lol<br/>
