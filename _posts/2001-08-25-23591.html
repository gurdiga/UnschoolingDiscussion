<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410996441">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
Dawn here back from the beautiful Coronado Island in California.  We thought <br/>
we were in heaven.  Our first family vacation in 7 years and the kids loved <br/>
it.  I couldn&#39;t help noticing how many people we met kept on saying to Zak <br/>
&quot;so your going to be 6 this month, you must be going into Kindergarten or 1st <br/>
Grade this year&quot;  I would say &quot;actually we are thinking about homeschooling <br/>
him&quot;.... after about the 10th person had said this to Zak he said &quot;actually <br/>
mummy and daddy are thinking about me having school at home&quot;.... Steve and I <br/>
just smiled....<br/>
<br/>
Not happy to be back in the heat of Arizona but happy to be home in order to <br/>
put our house on the market and move to either Washington State, Oregon or <br/>
California.  Knowing that there is support for our lifestyle choices wherever <br/>
we go.<br/>
