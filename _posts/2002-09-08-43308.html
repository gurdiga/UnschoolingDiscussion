My gosh!  &quot;No need for guidance&quot;?<br/>
That was just rude (again) and snarky. I think it&#39;s fairly obvious that the <br/>
people here are giving a LOT of guidance and spending WAY more time <br/>
interacting with their children than the majority of parents.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I would never advocate &#39;freaking out&#39;, for Pete&#39;s sake.  I am <br/>
 advocating keeping tabs on things that could be potentially <br/>
 detrimental, so that you can discuss it before it sinks in too deep.  <br/>
 My question was, &quot;Do you monitor this at all?&quot;  The answer was, <br/>
 &quot;Nope.&quot;  This tells me that you are not paying attention.  If you <br/>
 WERE paying attention, the answer would have been &quot;Yes.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wait a minute here. Where in the Hell did you read that I (or anyone) said <br/>
&quot;nope, we leave our kids alone, no guidance, no discussion, we don&#39;t care <br/>
what they do&quot;?<br/>
That is ridiculous and proves you aren&#39;t interested in a real conversation in <br/>
which you could actually learn how other people do things.<br/>
You asked if I MONITORED it, which indicates control.<br/>
No, I let him choose is what I actually  answered. I never once said I don&#39;t <br/>
take a serious interest in what he&#39;s watching, what he&#39;s interested in.<br/>
I never indicated I don&#39;t dialogue with my son about sex, bodies, porn, shows <br/>
on tv, ads etc.... we do all the time.<br/>
We&#39;re friends, my son and I. We talk about a lot of things many parents <br/>
wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable with. He trusts that I will answer him honestly.<br/>
He sees nudity, he has access to sex books and parents that are totally up <br/>
front about sex and intimacy.<br/>
He has never been sent messages that sex is shameful or unnatural, so I doubt <br/>
he is going to feel a strong desire for porn, ever. <br/>
It&#39;s openly discussed, the reasons people are attracted to it, the ways it <br/>
hurts people, the ways it does not show true intimacy.<br/>
But not often discussed, because he isn&#39;t fascinated by it in the least. <br/>
Human bodies are beautiful in our home, we have artwork depicting nudity, I <br/>
take them to art shows that have a lot of nudity.<br/>
It&#39;s beautiful and sometimes embarrasses him. But it&#39;s never been forbidden <br/>
or shameful.<br/>
Please quit insulting long time members of this list by assuming they aren&#39;t <br/>
there with their kids, dialoguing, bonding and very interested in the health <br/>
and safety of their children.<br/>

time I saw porn was after having been married happily for several <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well I went to school all my life but I was raised by very loving and <br/>
supportive parents. I was an only child and rather spoiled in my day <br/>
compared to some but nothing like some of the kids I know now. My parents <br/>
really gave me free reign on most things that I can remember. They trusted <br/>
me. You know what, they probably shouldn&#39;t have done so that much. I never <br/>
got into trouble that they knew of, but I was a little hell cat. Sex <br/>
fascinated me and whenever the topic came up, I would never talk more than I <br/>
thought was necessary to appease my mom about it. I told her just enough to <br/>
be friends but no moe than that. Didn&#39;t think it was any ofher business. <br/>
When I left home, things got so much worse. I went nuts and I&#39;m thrilled to <br/>
death to be alive and happy now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are all kinds of things you can come up with that may have <br/>
prompted my behavior that my parents did wrong. I can see a few but nothing <br/>
real drastic. Is it possible that some kids just go that way to find out on <br/>
their own in spite of what they have learned and how they&#39;ve been raised? I <br/>
must also say, I NEVER EVER went along with the crowd. If anything, I was <br/>
the weird one who didn&#39;t do what everyone else was doing. I just did what I <br/>
wanted.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have 3 teenagers and 2 younger kids.  I have to say that my household and<br/>
the way it runs sounds very much like Sandra&#39;s.  I know that my 13 year old<br/>
sometimes accidentally surfs to a porn site when he is looking for<br/>
something else and that sometimes he gets porno spam when he downloads his<br/>
e-mail.  He simply deletes the e-mails and moves on from the website.  He<br/>
is not really very interested in girls yet and simply isn&#39;t interested in<br/>
viewing anything that he finds too &quot;gross&quot; or scarey.  The other day he was<br/>
reading the cartoon history of the universe and he asked me what a hemoroid<br/>
was:)<br/>
I do not worry about where he goes on the web.  I know that when he is<br/>
surfing he is looking for sites specific to a computer game or something<br/>
else.  He doesn&#39;t just randomly surf.  My 10 year old doesn&#39;t surf the net<br/>
on his own, he isn&#39;t interested.  Very ocasionally he looks at things like<br/>
playmobil that is for auction on e-bay but that is it.  He plays everquest<br/>
online, I don&#39;t worry that some predator is out there waiting for him.  He<br/>
knows not to give out personal information (I heard him lecturing the 5<br/>
year old about it the other day) and our computer is right there on the<br/>
main floor so that he can ask me if he is unsure or uncomfortable about<br/>
anything, he is also a beginning reader and often needs help spelling a<br/>
word.<br/>
Our life is not perfect, we have had some issues with behaviour and trust<br/>
with one of our teenagers but we are working through them and unschooling<br/>
still works best for him and us.<br/>
I do not like pornography but really don&#39;t think that I am being deluded<br/>
when I say that my 3 teenagers are simply not interested in it.<br/>

<br/>
well, how about a real life example?<br/>
My dh was about that age, maybe a little older (14 ish) when he was at a <br/>
friends house and they snuck an X rated movie from the Dad&#39;s closet.<br/>
He was so totally grossed out and upset by it that he won&#39;t watch porn to <br/>
this day.<br/>
He said it&#39;s like when you throw up after eating something and you never want <br/>
to eat that thing again.<br/>
That&#39;s from a man that was not unschooled. so apparently porn isn&#39;t this <br/>
hugely wonderfully fascinating thing for all humans regardless of their <br/>
beliefs or the way they were raised.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018268625">I am coming in this midstream as my yahoo groups for<br/>
some reason was not functioning. The discussion was<br/>
about pornography.  This has been an issue in my home<br/>
for about 4 years, since we have gotten the internet. <br/>
It has made me question whether or not on several<br/>
occasions to have or not to have the internet or cable<br/>
tv.<br/>
<br/>
I am very much an unschooler, and believe in allowing<br/>
children as much control as possible.  But as a parent<br/>
I believe that part of my job is providing a safe<br/>
environment for them.  Pornography in my mind is not<br/>
safe.  Are children going to have an interest in the<br/>
human body and in sex itself, absolutely.  But it is<br/>
our place to explain the beauty of it. To me having<br/>
pornography in the home in whatever form is providing<br/>
an unsafe enviornment for a child and even an adult. <br/>
My son has told us that he does not want the password<br/>
to the internet for fear of getting in a pornographic<br/>
website even accidently.  He has gotten into it as a<br/>
curiosity.  This is an area we have discussed and I am<br/>
very open with my son about sex and the act of love<br/>
making.<br/>
<br/>
If my children wanted to see a pornographic movie I<br/>
would say absolutely not.  I would definitely explain<br/>
why I would not watch it.  Some people may feel that<br/>
is control but to me it is providing a safe<br/>
environment.  I came from an unsafe environment as a<br/>
child, I would not allow that into my home.<br/>
<br/>
I will not say that is the way it should be for others<br/>
but for me that is the way it is.<br/>

&lt;&lt; So where is the embarassment coming from? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is this fairly natural development of a thing called  modesty. Yes, <br/>
it&#39;s natural for a 12 y.o. to blush a little when things get a little too <br/>
intimate on the tv.<br/>
Or to laugh in a little bit embarrassed way when Mom talks about things <br/>
openly....like when he asked what our Kama Sutra game was.<br/>
Do you have older kids? I&#39;ve met a lot that have paren&#39;t who are very open <br/>
and honest and still get a little embarassed.  It&#39;s part of coming into your <br/>
sexuality and puberty and ideas centered around adult life and relationships.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What???? I DID ask if you monitored this, and you both said NO!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well here&#39;s why, if you&#39;re truly interested in understanding.<br/>
MY definition (and my dictionaries) is this:<br/>
<br/>
1. One that admonishes, cautions, or reminds. 3.a. Any device used to record, <br/>
check or CONTROL a process. 6. To keep watch over, supervise.<br/>
<br/>
This is not how I would describe the process at all in our home.<br/>
I am interested in what my son is interested in. I like talking to him. I <br/>
like understanding what does fascinate him. This is not, nor ever will be, <br/>
monitoring the situation.<br/>
If we can&#39;t get on the same page with definitions, that will be a huge <br/>
problem with further dialogue.<br/>
Suffice it to say, that most people I know, would consider &quot;monitor&quot; to mean <br/>
some level of control. It was taken that way by more than just myself here.<br/>
&#39;nuff said about that......<br/>
Try to understand that I have had to go through major paradigm shifts, <br/>
struggle to relearn old behaviors and major soul searching to come to the <br/>
point that I&#39;m at and it bothers me to have people screaming &quot;you aren&#39;t <br/>
paying attention to your child&quot; just because a question was posed about a <br/>
thought process they had regarding giving children freedom.<br/>
I don&#39;t mind if we can&#39;t agree, that is common in life.<br/>
I just wish that when questions are posed here they wouldn&#39;t get taken as a <br/>
slam on your parenting.<br/>
People are just sharing what has worked, and worked with excellent results.<br/>

<br/>
Exactly.  And it is ithe sam ereason that a 12-year-old boy might <br/>
not know quite how to address an issue like porn with his mom.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know you, and I don&#39;t know your son,so I was asking.  This <br/>
was taken, however, as an attack on child freedom and respect, <br/>
which it most certainly was not.<br/>

&lt;&lt; There WAS no twelve year old. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For the other person there wasn&#39;t. But it all started over my (very real) <br/>
12y.o. that stays up until 2 or 3 am.<br/>
It was implied that &quot;wasn&#39;t I concerned about what he could see at that <br/>
time?&quot; and I said no, I wasn&#39;t concerned, didn&#39;t monitor but was very <br/>
involved and aware of his viewing habits. I also said we didn&#39;t even GET <br/>
porn.....and so that never worried me ever.<br/>
But then it was mentioned that there were things on at that time that he <br/>
could &quot;stumble&quot; upon and could traumatize him and it was put to me point <br/>
blank that I &quot;was not even paying attention&quot; to my child.<br/>
Because I said I wasn&#39;t &quot;monitoring&quot;.<br/>
That&#39;s when it spun just a bit sidesays and a little too many theoreticals <br/>
that don&#39;t exist were introduced.<br/>
