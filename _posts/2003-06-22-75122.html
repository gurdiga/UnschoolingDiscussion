 </span></blockquote>As a girl, I remember the reactions of my parents to my boyfriends&#39; calls. <br/>
Some would just say, &quot;Is Kelly home?&quot; And then there was GEORGE:<br/>
<br/>
Hello. <br/>
Hello! (Obvious smile at the other end) Mrs. Dunlap? This is George Walker. <br/>
How are you?<br/>
Fine, George. You?<br/>
Doing Fine, Mrs. Dunlap. Keeping busy with school and the horses.   If <br/>
Kelly&#39;s not busy, may I speak with her, please?<br/>
Sure. Just a minute.<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Parents LIKED hearing that George was calling. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cameron had a friend that *sounded* like this. But he wasn&#39;t honest or <br/>
sincere. We (Ben and I ) called him Eddie Haskell. <br/>
Hello, Mrs. Lovejoy. Beautiful day, isn&#39;t it? Lovely dress you&#39;re <br/>
wearing---and your HAIR!<br/>
<br/>
Only to turn around when he thought we weren&#39;t listening and be an ass. <br/>
NOTHING sincere about that boy!<br/>
<br/>
I still adore George---and I think of him almost every time I hear my boys on <br/>
the phone. The sincerity was what makes the difference. George&#39;s mom is like <br/>
that---incredibly honest and sincere---and KIND.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s real, it&#39;s wonderful. If it&#39;s not, it&#39;s crap.<br/>
