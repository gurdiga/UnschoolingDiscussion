<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077289296">What can happen in a span of time: CNN reported that over 150,000 <br/>

the US and of those, over 150,000 are unschoolers. <br/>

I didnt realize the numbers were so high. I guess i always assume that <br/>
we *know* all the unschoolers from this list!;o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually 1.1 million homeschoolers is a really OLD number - <br/>
something like 1995 or 1998 or whatever - it&#39;s actually grown a lot <br/>
since then. And too that&#39;s a fairly inaccurate number because of the <br/>
number of states that don&#39;t require registering or anything so they <br/>
have to just approximate based on census numbers of about how many <br/>
kids there are, about how many are of school age (which varies by <br/>
state also), and how many are registered in public schools (private <br/>
schools often don&#39;t have to report to anyone either which further <br/>
skews the data).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When people are posting, though, they need to back up their  <br/>
statements with sources and state clearly what they meant to say.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Natural learners&quot; is  a term used, but not then defined for this  <br/>
list.  Does it mean just not buying a curriculum?  Lots of unit- <br/>
studies families don&#39;t buy a curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
I was just asking for a clearer statement, and maybe a link to a source.<br/>
