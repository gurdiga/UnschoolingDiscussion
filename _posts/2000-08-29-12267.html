&#39;informed&#39; me that you can add numbers in any order.  That&#39;s an algebra <br/>
concept.  He went on to let me know that you could not do the same for <br/>
subtraction.  We then discussed multiplication and division order.  I pointed <br/>
out to him that he had demonstrated an algebra concept and he went on his <br/>
merry way.<br/>

Just keep doing what you&#39;re doing.  Great story.  It helps us all when we can <br/>
see the ways the &#39;proper&#39; subjects get covered in day to day living!  Thanks <br/>
for sharing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I see what you mean.  By the time we get to high school algebra, we&#39;ve been <br/>
exposed to lots of algebraic concepts.  I just remember those involved <br/>
problems that we had to show every step of in homework assignments.  See, <br/>
that&#39;s just another way &quot;school&quot; screws up learning.<br/>
