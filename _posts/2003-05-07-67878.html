<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637564998">I totally understand!  My sister in law is a special education<br/>
teacher and very into her career!<br/>
<br/>
My cousin is a special ed teacher.  Fifteen years ago, when I was<br/>
homeschooling my older son, she was very much against it.  Now, she says she<br/>
wishes she had homeschooled her kids.  In fact she was the one that more or<br/>
less convinced my son not to try school a couple of years ago.  We were<br/>
having dinner with her, and she kept going on and on about this kid or that<br/>
kid she wanted to help but couldn&#39;t because of bureaucracy or power-tripping<br/>
teachers or principals.  At the end of the meal, she said to Lars, &quot;I can&#39;t<br/>
remember what your mother told me.  Are you going to school this year?&quot;  He<br/>
hesitated for only a second and then said no.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
