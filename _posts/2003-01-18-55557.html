       I&#39;ll second this. Did you know that you attended the unschooling group <br/>
at Shyrley&#39;s last week; so did Joyce? We were so glad you were there. Since <br/>
I&#39;ve been part of this email group, I have benefited from your <br/>
stories/advice. I know everyone attending the ungroup feels the same. <br/>
