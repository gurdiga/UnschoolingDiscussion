<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632872341"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My son is 18 years old, and looking for a full time job.  We have filled out so many job applications, and have not gotten a single call-back.  I am wondering what you all had your children put on their job applications.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When it says &quot;high school&quot; I started out just putting &quot;homeschool&quot; but wondered if I would be better off making up a name for our school &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I doubt putting *homeschool* is the reason he is not finding a job.  There are numerous reasons one applicant is hired over another.  <br/>
 <br/>
It sounds to me like you or he are picking up the applications and then you are filling them out and one of you returns the application.  If the positions require reading or the ability to write neatly and they suspect he did not fill out the application, that may be the reason why.  It would be better for him to go in *dressed for an interview* and fill out the application while there.  He may or may not get an interview at that time, but should dress as if he would.<br/>
 <br/>
He needs to look at the way he is dressing:  hair (cut and color), facial / tongue piercings, cleanliness, and neatness of clothing.  In the past we have not hired people for reasons based on those things.  <br/>
 <br/>
Call your local Oklahoma Employment Security Commission office www.oesc.state.ok.us.  They have a one day class that shows you how to put together a resume (should be customized for each different application), how to interview (dress and attitude), how to look for jobs, how to make your past experiences relevant to possible opportunities, etc.  Some of the offices may also have a longer class that goes into more depth.  This is all free and they really can be helpful while he is looking.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope he finds what he is looking for soon!<br/>

<br/>
Well my oldest isn&#39;t homeschooled but she did find a job on her own at 16<br/>
with only short previous experience. She always filled out the app right<br/>
there and then. Gives the employer a chance to see the person, make sure<br/>
they know what they are doing and also to observe them if they are<br/>
interested at all. My daughter made sure she was always appropriately<br/>
dressed and polite and cheerful. She would ask questions about the job<br/>
instead of just handing the app in. Like when will someone review it or get<br/>
back to her. Making it so they knew she really wanted the job and wanted to<br/>
hear from them. She let them know right up front when she was available and<br/>
what she would like to do. Even if there was no interview. A lot of times<br/>
even people taking the application and not interviewing are in a postion to<br/>
make suggestions to the manager. She also always followed up on those apps<br/>
she turned in. Wanting to know if they made a decision or not and to keep<br/>
her in mind if they would be hiring more people later. The first time she<br/>
went looking was in late Sept. early Oct. A slow time around here. She<br/>
followed up again with new stores and also the ones from before in late Oct.<br/>
early Nov. when hiring for the holidays is needed. She got a great job at<br/>
Old Navy and did so well they kept her and she&#39;s head cashier now. So if the<br/>
person seems like they really want the job and are eager and willing to<br/>
work, sometimes the timing is off. Tell your son to keep trying and not give<br/>
up. Sometimes one can assume they won&#39;t get hired and well the attitude kind<br/>
 of follows you around. Tell him good luck.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ds (also 18) prints out an information sheet for his own use when he <br/>
goes to fill out applications.  It has all the dates, places, <br/>
telephone numbers, etc. he&#39;ll need.  It&#39;s so much easier that way <br/>
than to have to try to think of everything everytime.  It also helps <br/>
him with the spelling. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s not enough for an information sheet, start thinking about <br/>
some type of volunteering that can be used for not only experience <br/>
but references.  He can also put skills and training on there.  If <br/>
there&#39;s nothing he can think of, he may need to start working on that <br/>
too.  It doesn&#39;t have to be formally learn skills; if he can learn <br/>
how to make web pages at home, that&#39;ll work.  Even if it&#39;s not a <br/>
skill they&#39;re looking for, it shows he&#39;s motivated and capable.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a tough market out there and he needs to set himself apart <br/>
somehow and just keep going.<br/>

You can get real creative with different experiences. Besides, you don&#39;t have <br/>
to wait to be asked to submit a resume. He can also list his objectives on a <br/>
resume. Things like what he wants and expects in a position, what he feels he <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
A resume will set him apart, if it is neatly done and pertinent.  Everyone has something to put on a resume.  A &quot;functional&quot; resume emphasizes skills rather than employment.  Instead of date/job title/skills and responsibilties, it has skills/description of how learned.  He can get a sample at the employment office.  It could have different types of experience such as unpaid/volunteer work or other activities.  This is the best type for someone with no previous employment.  <br/>
 <br/>
A resume and application basically have the exact same information on them.  Even with a resume, he would still need to completely fill out an application.  So, a *master application* might be best for him.  It is just a generic appliation with the blanks filled in.  Applications all ask the same basic questions.  This way when he goes to get an application, he has all the info right there with him.  (This shows preparation.)<br/>
 <br/>
When we had a family business, I did much of the interviewing.  Generally, we hired entry level (delivery/warehouse), and then promoted them if they were willing and able to stick it out.  If they filled out the application while there, they received an interview (provided they were neatly dressed, no piercings showing, hair a natural looking color, etc.).  ***If they took the application and returned it later, we accepted it, quickly glanced at it, and let them know we would call them later for an interview.  We did NOT call very many back over the years.***<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes when people go in to look for a job, they ask the wrong kinds of questions.  How much does it pay?  How long is the lunch break?  How much time off for vacation?  IF he&#39;s asking questions when he goes in initially, it should be about the company where he&#39;s applying.  <br/>
 <br/>
Even if he is applying for a job where jeans would be appropriate to wear to work, he should probably wear slacks for the application and interview. <br/>
 <br/>
If the employment ad came out on a Sunday, he should be going to apply on Monday or Tuesday at the latest.  Later in the week and it is sometimes assumed they aren&#39;t really interested in the job.   <br/>
 <br/>
Is he letting everyone know he is looking for a job?  Networking with friends is often a great way to get a foot in the door.  Even if there&#39;s not an opening where they work, they might know of an opening somewhere else.  It&#39;s also not as cold of an experience when they go in for an interview.  <br/>
 <br/>
Good luck with the hunt.  Finding a job IS a job!<br/>

<br/>
Yes, the next door neighbor of a friend works at the local meat <br/>
packing plant.  He told Josh to fill out the application and give it <br/>
to him to turn it, and that if he endorsed it, there was a 95% chance <br/>
he&#39;d get the job.  Well, they called one day while we were out, and <br/>
we tried to call them back, but the woman who was supposed to do the <br/>
interview was &quot;gone on vacation&quot;.  He asked them to call back, but <br/>
they never did.  This is one of the better paying jobs here in town, <br/>
so it was a bummer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-175868585">Should be.  The local employment offices are run by the state, but federally funded.  Guess who makes the rules!  I would assume that it would be about the same in any state.  Here (Oklahoma) they will give you resume hints, provide computer training modules, interviewing tips, how to job hunt, any kind of help you could need.  The one thing I would not recommend is to just register with them and wait for them to find you a job.  (It&#39;s not likely to happen.)  <br/>
 <br/>
For an adult (or teen with some experience) I would recommend Harvey Mackay&#39;s book, Dig Your Well Before You&#39;re Thirsty: The Only Networking Book You&#39;ll Ever Need.  I strongly believe that networking is the best way, sometimes the only way, to find a job.  One tip:  Have some nice but inexpensive (black print on white cardstock) business cards printed up with contact information (name, address, phone, cell phone, email, fax) on one side, on the other side a minature description of the type of work he&#39;s looking for and/or skill sets that he has.  He can give these out when talking to friends.  Then they&#39;re more likely to remember he&#39;s actively looking and recommend him when they hear of something.  <br/>

Have some nice but inexpensive (black print on white cardstock) <br/>
business cards printed up with contact information (name, address, <br/>
phone, cell phone, email, fax) on one side, on the other side a <br/>
minature description of the type of work he&#39;s looking for and/or <br/>
skill sets that he has.  He can give these out when talking to <br/>
friends.  Then they&#39;re more likely to remember he&#39;s actively looking <br/>
and recommend him when they hear of something.  <br/>

&lt;&lt;  Well, they called one day while we were out, and <br/>

they never did.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He should have asked when HE could call back.  Once they had contacted him, <br/>
he should have kept returning the call until he talked to the woman who had <br/>
called him.   People really DO go on vacations.<br/>
<br/>
And not all phone messages get delivered.<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;call me back&quot; isn&#39;t the best way for a prospective employee to get <br/>
noticed!  If I pick up the phone to call someone back (which isn&#39;t even all that <br/>
likely if he&#39;s been called once already) and it rings while my hand&#39;s on it, and <br/>
it&#39;s someone calling back for the second time...  bingo!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511428150">If he&#39;s out applying and is going to be gone for the day, he needs to be checking messages.  It&#39;s best to return the call the same day, or early the next morning at the latest.  You cannot expect the interviewer to call when they get back from vacation.  I&#39;m sure her desk was piled high with messages and things that did not get done because she was gone.  He needs to ask when she&#39;ll be back from vacation and then call back at that time.  Maybe the neighbor who originally turned in the application could turn in another one, remind the lady about your son, or give your son some idea of what to do.  All companies are different.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-152087876">Judie, for years, I managed 60 young people and did all the hiring <br/>
and firing. When I couldn&#39;t talk to the perspective employee because <br/>
of missed calls it didn&#39;t bother me. I expected a kid to show up on <br/>
my doorstep if he wanted a chance. The best advice I have is this: <br/>
find out from a secretary, receptionist, or any other employee what <br/>
time the hiring manager is in and able to see people, what the best <br/>
time to talk to him is...and go there. Personnel managers like to see <br/>
people in person, also, in some job situations these people are so <br/>
busy with other tasks, they don&#39;t follow up on applications, they <br/>
wait until someone walks in the door.<br/>
<br/>
Selling oneself is quite embarrassing, I almost lost my first job <br/>
because I was so nervous and hardly spoke a word. At the end of the <br/>
interview I managed to blurt out:<br/>
&quot; I really want to work, I&#39;ll work hard&quot; and the guy hired me.<br/>
<br/>
So rehearse some lines with your son about why he&#39;ll be right for a <br/>
job at their place. He may pull against this but he must get some <br/>
concrete ideas from you or some other person he looks up too. Is <br/>
there anyone you know that he can talk too?<br/>
<br/>
People&#39;s comments on volunteering are right on. I just got a great <br/>
part-time job because of volunteering. If he wants to get a job with <br/>
the county, he could try using any 4H contacts you have. Also, as far <br/>
as what to put on a job application when he hasn&#39;t worked....I had my <br/>
son list Boy Scouts and 4H activities. He did yard work for an <br/>
elderly man and worked very infrequently in some chicken houses when <br/>
he was 14. Is there anything in your son&#39;s past like this?</div>

<br/>
This is coming late. That&#39;s because I have not posted in a while. Here <br/>
in NYC everybody is recommended to have a resume in hand, even kids who <br/>
have never had a job. It&#39;s that &quot;look professional&quot; thing.<br/>
<br/>
Still, just because he has never had a job it does not mean he lacks <br/>
skills. There is a book that I just found absolutely necessary to have <br/>
: The Damn Good Resume Book by Yanna Parker. She shows people, <br/>
especially those with unconventional backgrounds, how to put together a <br/>
resume that highlights a person&#39;s abilities and talents ---especially <br/>
if they have never had a &quot;paying&quot; job.<br/>
<br/>
You and your son will really find it helps.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
