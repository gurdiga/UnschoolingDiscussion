<div id="ygrps-yiv-846338090">&quot;Always act that the immediate motive of thy will may become a universal<br/>
rule for all intelligent human beings.&quot;<br/>
--Immanuel Kant, 18th Century German Philosopher<br/>
<br/>
A categorical imperative is an absolute, or unqualified obligation of all<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
My interpretation of Kant&#39;s quote:<br/>
<br/>
We must ensure our immediate or primary motive for action is one that all<br/>
mankind would do well to emulate. Is our motive to impress others?  If so,<br/>
then perhaps we shouldn&#39;t act.  Is our motive to make someone else look bad?<br/>
If so, then we shouldn&#39;t act.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if building up another is our immediate motive, then we<br/>
should act.<br/>
<br/>
People who follow the Categorial Imperative do good for the right reasons;<br/>
not because of a promised reward, or fear of punishment, but rather because<br/>
doing good is it&#39;s own reward.  Admittedly, sometimes to reach that state of<br/>
consciousness, we school ourselves with systems of reward and punishment.<br/>
However, we mustn&#39;t forget that in human development, such systems are only<br/>
scaffolding.  At some point, we must remove the scaffolding in order to<br/>
reveal the true edifice: a mature human being whose actions stem from<br/>
rational and pure motives.<br/>
