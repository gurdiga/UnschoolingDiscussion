<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709356570">I had put in a mesage about this &quot;arranged marriage/courtship&quot; issue but <br/>
can&#39;t seem to find it....forgive me if I&#39;m being repetative but....<br/>
The &quot;I kissed Dating goodbye&quot; is by Josh Harris. I lived right up the road <br/>
from his family, attended workshops by his Dad and am well aware of what the <br/>
&quot;courtship&quot; ritual is all about.<br/>
It is like an arranged marriage in my view. But most of the parents promoting <br/>
this will not agree with my view. The family I knew very well that did this, <br/>
had a dd at the age of 16 that expressed an interest in a young man (also 16) <br/>
that she&#39;d known her entire life. Suddenly he seemed very attractive to <br/>
her...at this point the parents make sure it is understood that if you will <br/>
be spending time with this person you&#39;d best know that they will be a <br/>
lifelong mate. Of course they go to the same church....<br/>
When both kids agree that this person is someone they&#39;d consider entering <br/>
into a &quot;courtship&quot; with, they then spend time together under the watchful <br/>
eyes of the parents. Both parents enter into an agreement with the kids to <br/>
help keep them &quot;pure&quot;.<br/>
I saw this method become VERY invasive as factions on both sides of this <br/>
arrangement made sure these kids were never, ever alone together.<br/>
Apparently humans have zero self control when with the opposite sex.<br/>
They just got married in August after four years of courtship. Personally, I <br/>
thought that the length of engagement and the parental control were <br/>
ridiculous.<br/>
Was this an arranged marriage?<br/>
Everyone involved will say no.<br/>
I say yes.<br/>
