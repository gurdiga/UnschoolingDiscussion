<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769837803">My daughter is extremely interested in the human body and all its functions. <br/>
She has a couple of different models and the little books that come with <br/>
them, but really wants something with more substance. Although she is only 8 <br/>
she is an extraordinary reader and has very good reading comprehension, so I <br/>
doubt there would be anything she couldn&#39;t read and understand well. (with <br/>
the exception of some unpronounceable words which I can do for her.) We are <br/>
searching for a very comprehensive human anatomy book. I have thought of <br/>
driving over to Kansas University Medical and searching their book store, but <br/>
I am afraid all I will find is text books separated into one or two functions <br/>
per book and will have too much in the way of educationeze. We want something <br/>
that has all the different body parts and systems with lots of pictures and <br/>
good anatomical drawings. Please and thank you for any suggestions! :o) <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s the Anatomy Coloring Book<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805350861/qid=1022493373/sr=8-1/ref=">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805350861/qid=1022493373/sr=8-1/ref=</a><br/>
sr_8_1/102-8232832-2509703<br/>
<br/>
Which from the cover does look like human anatomy. I&#39;ve some in this series<br/>
and they are intended for college students studying the courses. There&#39;s a<br/>
page of detailed information and the detailed drawing to color opposite.<br/>
They&#39;re very good.<br/>
<br/>
and The Human Anatomy Coloring Book (Dover)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486241386/ref=pd_sim_books/102-82328">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486241386/ref=pd_sim_books/102-82328</a><br/>

<br/>
Being Dover this one would be more child oriented, but it&#39;s only $3.95.<br/>
<br/>
And Gray&#39;s Anatomy Coloring Book<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0762409444/ref=pd_sim_books/102-82328">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0762409444/ref=pd_sim_books/102-82328</a><br/>

<br/>
Like the Anatomy Coloring Book, this is college student oriented and in the<br/>
same format.<br/>
<br/>
(There are some used ones at Amazon. Which doesn&#39;t necessarily mean used<br/>
used as in colored in. The sellers should describe the condition. (Try<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.half.com">http://www.half.com</a> too.)<br/>
<br/>
And the CD-ROM below reminds me of the ADAM: The Inside Story software which<br/>
maybe isn&#39;t being made any more (it doesn&#39;t show up at Amazon) but there&#39;s a<br/>
couple of used ones for $7 (which includes shipping and handling) at<br/>
Half.com<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://half.ebay.com/cat/buy/prod.cgi?cpid=1065104123&domain_id=1848&meta_id">http://half.ebay.com/cat/buy/prod.cgi?cpid=1065104123&domain_id=1848&meta_id</a><br/>
=5<br/>
<br/>
And the Dorling Kindersley American College of Physicians Complete Home<br/>
Medical Guide (but aren&#39;t they a British company? This one has lots of color<br/>
pictures and a CD-ROM)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789444127/ref=pd_sim_books/102-82328">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789444127/ref=pd_sim_books/102-82328</a><br/>
32-2509703<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The American College of Physicians Complete Home Medical Guide may be the<br/>
&gt; biggest health book you&#39;ve ever lifted--page count: 1100; page size: 10 by 7.5<br/>
&gt; inches. The emphasis here is on disease. More than 600 pages are devoted to<br/>
&gt; more than 700 different diseases and disorders. Each article discusses the<br/>
&gt; causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis of the<br/>
&gt; condition. Two thousand full-color illustrations let you see disease symptoms<br/>
&gt; up close, understand the anatomy, and view treatments. Online resources are<br/>
&gt; also given for additional and updated information--though the light-blue type<br/>
&gt; of the URLs can make them difficult to read and type.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Besides disease information, you&#39;ll appreciate the 70 symptom charts--find<br/>
&gt; your symptom (lump, wheezing, impaired vision, abdominal pain, for example)<br/>
&gt; and follow the flow chart, which pins down specifics and makes suggestions.<br/>
&gt; You can also learn first aid and read about drugs, surgery, and<br/>
&gt; rehabilitation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also included is a CD-ROM that lets you explore various body systems and read<br/>
&gt; interesting topics about how the body works, many with cool animations.<br/>
&gt; (QuickTime Movie Player is included for you if you don&#39;t have it.) You can<br/>
&gt; also connect to DK&#39;s Body Online Web site, an online health magazine. But one<br/>
&gt; drawback to this otherwise wonderful resource is that it isn&#39;t obvious what<br/>
&gt; features the CD-ROM has or how to navigate through it until you click the<br/>
&gt; question mark at the upper right, which presents a guide to and explanation of<br/>
&gt; the contents. (It would have been helpful if the editors included this<br/>
&gt; information in a prominent, easily located introduction.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you go to Amazon and type in &quot;anatomy coloring book&quot; Amazon is now<br/>
indexing catalogs from various companies so you can see which ones have the<br/>
&quot;anatomy coloring book&quot; listed and perhaps search them for similar books.<br/>
(As in on beyond the coloring books into the cool ones with the overlays and<br/>
such.)<br/>
<br/>
Also if you click on &quot;See all 12 results in Books&quot; on that page down the<br/>
right side are lists made by customers that include that book, so they<br/>
should list similar books.<br/>
<br/>
And on each of the pages is a list of similar items.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632157575">In the first 2 years of med school, the texts are pretty<br/>
manageable.  Netter&#39;s Anatomy is the current, most commonly used<br/>
anatomy test; it was last revised in 1998.  I assume Amazon or<br/>
Barnes and Noble will have it online - or any bookstore could<br/>
order it.  That and a Stedman&#39;s Medical Dictionary will take you<br/>
a long way.  I know that by age 8 I was routinely accessing my<br/>
father&#39;s med school texts for understandable explanations of &quot;The<br/>
Way We Work.&quot;  Some of it is elaborated more than she will care<br/>
about - but it is all there for her to go back and double check.<br/>
A big plus IMHO - as a veteran of visible man models and the<br/>
like - is that there is no effort to mix a moral message into a<br/>
mechanical fact.<br/>

This isn&#39;t a book but a kit and well-done as Dorling Kindersley work <br/>
usually is : &quot;My Amazing Human Body&quot; by DK Multimedia for ages 6 - 10 <br/>
consists of a CD rom. Amongst the activities available is a quiz, a <br/>
section where you can click on a human body part and be told about <br/>
it, a section where the child can look up information, a section <br/>
where the child can build a body and a favourite section for my <br/>
children where they need to get Seemore Skinless through a day safely.<br/>
