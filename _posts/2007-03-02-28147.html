Someone hacked into my cox email account and used it to send out those &quot;I am<br/>
from blah, blah blah and represent so-and-so and if you send me $$$ I will<br/>
send you $$$$$$$&quot; emails.  They also set my account to forward to a<br/>
non-existent yahoo account.  It was only my email via the web, not my<br/>
computer....thanks goodness because that means everyone&#39;s email addresses<br/>
were safe!  The main thing it did to me was prevent me from getting emails<br/>
from people.  The groups I am on, I can check the archives but individuals,<br/>
I have no idea who sent what.  I will be sending out individual emails to my<br/>
friends for 2 reasons, 1 to warn them of this happening and 2 to see if they<br/>
will re-send any emails they sent to me today.<br/>
 <br/>
What is hard for me to understand is that no amount of spam/spyware/firewall<br/>
protection could have prevented this since it wasn&#39;t my computer that was<br/>
hacked.  It simply comes down to password encryption!  I can not caution you<br/>
all enough to pick really hard passwords for all your online accounts.  If<br/>
you encrypt them with symbols and numbers, it will make it harder for this<br/>
to happen to you.  I *knew* better but had a very easy password.  Now it is<br/>
hard for me to even remember, let alone someone else to figure out.  I will<br/>
be changing it every 3-6 months as well.  I will have to spend the next<br/>
several days tending to my forums and sites that I have visited just to be<br/>
sure someone doesn&#39;t use my accounts and ruin my reputation.  The likelihood<br/>
of that happening is slim but right now I don&#39;t want to take any chances.<br/>
 <br/>
I am so thankful for my computer geek husband because if not for him, I<br/>
would not have figured out what happened.  We have notified Cox of this<br/>
issue but there is little they could do about it anyway.  I will be emailing<br/>
a word of caution to all my yahoo groups because I do not want this to<br/>
happen to anyone else, EVER!  Please learn from my mistake...<br/>
 <br/>
With Gratitude,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-708175573">A good idea is to use a line from a song or poem to create passwords  <br/>
- &quot;I Like To Eat Eat Eat Apples and Bananas&quot; gives a password of:<br/>
&lt;IL2EEEAAB&gt;. Nobody can guess these. Try to find one that has numbers  <br/>
and letters and if it has the word &quot;to&quot; or &quot;one&quot; or &quot;for&quot; in it, use  <br/>
the numbers in place of the words.<br/>
