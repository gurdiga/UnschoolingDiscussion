<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827987396">My kids want to stay home because they were always on the go when school or lots of activities were in the picture.   My kids are 10, 8 and 5.   Although my little one who has never been in school loves to go.<br/>
<br/>
Also,  have you read Sandra&#39;s piece on boredom?   Right at her website,  I think.   It really hit a chord with me.   I remember when I was little, I remember being bored.   My mom telling me to go clean my room or that she&#39;d find something for me.   I wish she would have done something with me instead.   Never played with me.     Just another way to look at it.<br/>

  It starts at the ages your boys are at. With mine it did.<br/>
  My son would plan the night before where we would be<br/>
  going the next day.<br/>
  I had to put and end to it really fast, and the pouting<br/>
  about being bored.<br/>
  It wasn&#39;t easy on me putting my foot down.<br/>
  My reponse to I&#39;m bored, is you better find something to<br/>
  do, or I will find you something to do.<br/>
  You may want to promt them at bed time, and let them<br/>
  know that you are staying home tomorrow so they are<br/>
  forewarned.<br/>
  The go, go, go is very addicting to kids, and I think kids need<br/>
  to learn to entertain themselves when they are at home.<br/>

my kids playing games, baking, reading together, or whatever else <br/>

fill in the little bits of time we aren&#39;t running out the door- they <br/>
don&#39;t want to spend a whole day at home doing them.<br/>
<br/>
My children have never been to school (only a little preschool for <br/>
the oldest) so they have had years and years of time spent at home <br/>
leisurely relaxing and doing what they want.  At this point they <br/>
just want to be out in the world doing fun and exciting things with <br/>
their friends.  I&#39;m just finding it difficult keeping up with their <br/>
need for fast pace and excitement and GOING, and my need to not do <br/>
that every minute.<br/>

<br/>
I hope you know I didn&#39;t mean that you don&#39;t play with your kids or anything like that. I was just wanting to relate it to how I felt.   And when my mom would suggest work, it didn&#39;t help me at all.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t like to be on the go all the time,  my youngest who has also never been to school loves to be going all the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-338208920">I can really relate to this issue. Both of my kids are extremely social and<br/>
extremely active. They love to be going, doing, inviting friends over,<br/>
riding bikes, going swimming, doing homeschool group activities, non-stop!<br/>
This is no surprise as both DH and I are extremely social and extremely<br/>
active and have always been that way.<br/>
I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s anything wrong with someone who likes to be<br/>
moving, doing something, going somewhere and isn&#39;t too fond of staying in<br/>
the same place. To me, it&#39;s largely a temperament issue, and while other<br/>
kids might be very happy to hang out at home and do something familiar, my<br/>
kids aren&#39;t. Accepting that is part of being a parent to my kids. On the<br/>
other hand, I know how exhausting it can be to be the parent to such a<br/>
person, even if I can totally empathize with their needs.<br/>
I&#39;ve more or less resigned myself to the fact that our lives will be very,<br/>
very busy for the next few years. And that our house will be &quot;the house&quot;<br/>
where kids are always congregating. And very rare are the days when we just<br/>
stay at home the whole day. But then, my life wasn&#39;t like that before having<br/>
kids. If I had a day all to myself, I&#39;d figure out someplace to go,<br/>
something to do, some new thing I wanted to try. So why expect my kids to be<br/>
any different? The best thing I can do is to facilitate, as  best as I can,<br/>
their needs for motion, companionship, and new and exciting things to do,<br/>
see, learn. If it&#39;s not possible to meet those needs out of the house, I try<br/>
to figure out what&#39;s in the house that can help. If it&#39;s a rainy day, I<br/>
might pull the car out of the garage and they can ride bikes or skate or<br/>
draw with chalk on the garage floor. Something like that.<br/>
