<div id="ygrps-yiv-75787827">Hi everyone. I am relatively new to the ideas of unschooling but have been trying to practice for half a year now and am enjoying. My question today is about my almost 11 yr olds interest in modeling. She gets people telling her that she shoudl be a model all the time becuase she is so tall (5&#39;2&quot;) and she is very pretty. However, I am so scared of the idea of somebody telling her that she is not pretty or she needs to lose weight, ect. I also know NOTHING about this industry aside from what I read in articles and stuff like that. So after much discussion my dh and I decided that this is something that she clearly has expressed interest in and we should support her. I don&#39;t even know where to begin finding a modeling class (do they offer classes or is it all pageants?) I don&#39;t know anything about this and to make matters worse whenever I search on google it comes up with pornography! and then, I feel even worse, like what am I getting my little dd in to? I want to support her in<br/>
 whatever interests her so I am OPEN to any ideas... anyone been there with experience here? Thanks, Kelli<br/>

<br/>
Holly went to John Robert Powers for a year.  It was expensive, and she <br/>
enjoyed it most of the time and when the year was over she was glad it was done.   <br/>
She took four or six different classes, depending how you count it.  She could <br/>
repeat a class within that year and when a teacher changed it was like a <br/>
whole different class.  <br/>
<br/>
Part of what the school is after is getting the kids to want and need <br/>
headshots and modelling cards because they&#39;ll get a cut of what the photographer and <br/>
printers charge.  We just did our own and they didn&#39;t like it but oh well.  <br/>
Holly to several acting auditions, no modelling auditions, but there were <br/>
opportunities she took and some she skipped, to model a little.<br/>
<br/>
Now she knows lots more than she knew before.   <br/>
 <br/>
Some parents who go there are happier with the situation than others.  We <br/>
went in fairly skeptical.  We liked a couple of the teachers there a lot, and <br/>
some were doofi.  Holly enjoyed some of the kids, and others were iffy.  She was <br/>
fascinated by how school-based the examples and dialogs and examples and <br/>
questions were.  <br/>
<br/>
A large part of what their Image class is about is overcoming the negative <br/>
effects of school!  REbuilding a positive self image.  Holly never lost hers.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-46533447">that is so funny that you mention these school based analogies, I notice them more and more on tv and in the media now. Like, everytime Sadie turns on a preschool show she is always asking me when she will be able to go to school... I tell her we are learning everyday just being here together... but Elmo and all those guys make it sound so great, mommy! Oh well... food for thought. Molly and I talked alot about this again last night and after much research on the web she decided she wants to really try acting, which I  think she will love so we are going to start that in the fall. Ugh, another muggy day in the east coast, I miss that dry weather in NM Sandra, I feel like we live in a jungle! Kelli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333048857">It&#39;s a great idea, thanks. I am actually going to be taking some of the $ that we will be saving next year (we had intended to send Sadie to a preschool until several months ago when we decided to unschool) and get her in to swimming lessons and continue the dance she had started this year. So that should help her a little. Kelli<br/>

<br/>
True!  <br/>
<br/>
We have a storybook about them being in school and doing a show and tell.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve talked, here about how many of the PBS kids&#39; shows are about emotions <br/>
and decision making and often in the context of preparing for school <br/>
specifically.  Dragontales is quite that direction.  Barney BIGtime.  Arthur.   I used <br/>
to tell Marty those things, but Holly tells me.  She&#39;ll say, &quot;Hey!  They just <br/>
had this part because they want kids not to be afraid of school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yep.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s not too evil a thing in a culture (or a family) which sees school <br/>
as inevitable.  <br/>
