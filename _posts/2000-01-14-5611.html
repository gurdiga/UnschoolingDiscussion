 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.britannica.com/bcom/original/article/0,5744,2856,00.html">http://www.britannica.com/bcom/original/article/0,5744,2856,00.html</a><br/>

My personal response:<br/>
<br/>
If this nation&#39;s children are to become bright stars in the global economy<br/>
of tomorrow, and the United States is to maintain it&#39;s position at the top<br/>
of the world heap, our kiddies need lots of homework everyday.<br/>
<br/>
We are fully aware that our nation&#39;s best and brightest workers almost<br/>
uniformly demonstrate that to succeed in today&#39;s economy, a career has<br/>
pretty much got to be your life.  Frills such as hobbies or reading for<br/>
pleasure must be kept within strict bounds and mostly reserved for<br/>
retirement years.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, there will be limited time for things like relationships and<br/>
maintaining the home.  But the bulk of energy and attention needs to be<br/>
focused where it matters most:  on making money for our economy.<br/>
<br/>
So, our children can&#39;t start early enough learning how to be the best cog<br/>
they possibly can be in the all-important economic machinery.  They&#39;ve got<br/>
to get used to the idea that &quot;living it up&quot; means running from one organized<br/>
event to the next each and every day of their lives.  From school to<br/>
afterschool lessons to soccer practice to fast food pitstop for dinner to an<br/>
evening of homework assignments:  this is the ideal way a child should be<br/>
raised; particularly one for whom the parents have &quot;high hopes.&quot;  If<br/>
followed consistently up through adolescence, this plan will invariably<br/>
produce young adults who are eminently qualified to step right into the hot<br/>
careers of tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Children need their lives scripted to the greatest extent possible.<br/>
Experience has shown that where parents fail to do this, their children are<br/>
far more likely to develop non-traditional views about the meaning of<br/>
success or uneconomic ideas of how a life should be lived.  Conscientious<br/>
parents who truly care about their childrens&#39; future will spare no expense<br/>
or effort to ensure this doesn&#39;t occur.<br/>
