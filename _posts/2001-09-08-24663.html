<div id="ygrps-yiv-659043114">Ok, I just read the transcripts and he really didn&#39;t comment too much on it. <br/>
Except that they (Christianity and unschooling) don&#39;t mix. Hmmmm, All I can <br/>
really say is that they do mix. We do mix... are mixing, going to continue to <br/>
mix no matter what Mike Farris says or does. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076927130">That&#39;s great Ang.  I understand where you are coming from.  There are<br/>
however, many different kinds of Christian churches out there. Some<br/>
churches keep their attendance high through fear and they tell you every<br/>
week about all the things there are out there to fear. (There might be a<br/>
witch living right next to you!)  Some churches also say that children<br/>
are sinful by nature and would naturally choose what is bad for them if<br/>
their parents didn&#39;t keep them on the right path, so they parent through<br/>
fear.  Sometimes, I don&#39;t even think they realize what they are doing.<br/>
If you are parenting from a fear perspective, then you can&#39;t trust your<br/>
children to educate themselves or to make moral choices because you are<br/>
too afraid they will make the wrong choices. ( and that might reflect on<br/>
you.)<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling, imo, takes a great deal of trust in the nature of humans.<br/>
We are naturally curious unless we have spent years being forced to<br/>
learn about things that don&#39;t interest us while having our interests<br/>
brushed aside and our questions left unanswered.<br/>
 <br/>
If more people would get on with the business of living their lives and<br/>
their morals, their children would naturally pick up on it and do the<br/>
same thing.  Just as we don&#39;t need to sit and teach them language arts,<br/>
we also don&#39;t need to sit them down for a lesson in morals.  Just live<br/>
your life, talk with your children about why you make certain decisions,<br/>
let them see you live your morals and they will learn them.  If you<br/>
don&#39;t live what you teach them, they will learn to be a hypocrite, just<br/>
like you. (not you personally, Ang, just in general.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-356528049">I reckon you&#39;re part of a very small subset of homeschoolers<br/>
  (Christian unschoolers, I mean).  Do you find you get much flack from<br/>
  your faith community?<br/>
  Alex&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
  ****Do you mean Church? They know I homeschool , I&#39;m the only one  nobody asks questions. It is hard to find Christian unschoolers, I have met a few on line, I am on a yahoo group and I know a few in my homeschool group who lean towards it but in others eyes I&#39;m radical&lt;g&gt;  I never thought of myself that way but I do grow and change more and more each day. I love reading unschooling discussions and I talk to the two moms that I know understand where I&#39;m coming from. It&#39;s definitely a small community, I pray a lot and I believe I&#39;m doing what is right for my kids. I only talk to others in depth that are truly interested and can handle it. As a matter of fact I don&#39;t post often here &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961434792">Nobody&#39;s said to you, &quot;Unschooling?  But isn&#39;t that .....Pagan?&quot;  Ha.  I got<br/>
the same sort of inquiry when I talked about attachment parenting and not<br/>
vaccinating and all of the other things we do.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really discuss unschooling among fellow Christians anymore.  I just<br/>
say we homeschool and leave it at that.  Now when they ask about curriculum<br/>
it&#39;s a different story but not many ask about curriculum.<br/>
