<div id="ygrps-yiv-999077135">My kids expressed an interest in computer programming.  They love <br/>
Jimmy Neutron, Robots, and many of the cool computer animated <br/>
shows.  Is anyone aware of a fun program that could help in this <br/>
area, preferbly kid friendly?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I found that connecting the dd is easy as she is pleased to do <br/>
darn near everything.  With Zak though, it is harder.  Do any of you <br/>
have any stories to share of how you brought more happiness to your <br/>
unschooling sons?  I&#39;ve decided to take some building workshops or <br/>
something because he wants to build with wood, but he doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to take &quot;classes&quot;.  That&#39;s cool though b/c I am totally excited <br/>
about this opportunity to learn. He is totally excited to do <br/>
projects with me!  YAY  :-)  We are going to build a crumb catcher <br/>
within the next couple of days, hopefully, I&#39;ll have fingers left in <br/>
order to be able to type!<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps with this interest in computer programming and/or building, <br/>
he&#39;ll find his niche&#39;.  Also, he loves video games, he is wonderful <br/>
at figuring them out.  Are there any sites to help encourage <br/>
actually making video games?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually what you&#39;re looking for is computer animation.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the easiest way to start is with animated GIFs. They aren&#39;t  <br/>
Jimmy Neutron ;-) but they can be relatively complex. Or really  <br/>
really simple, just swapping two images repeatedly that gives the  <br/>
illusion of movement.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an overview here and some links to software:<br/>

<br/>
And a list here:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/gifanimationsoftware/">http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/gifanimationsoftware/</a><br/>
<br/>
If you have a Mac there&#39;s VSE Animation Maker for $10<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://vse-online.com/animation-maker/index.html">http://vse-online.com/animation-maker/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I know there&#39;s at least one free one for PCs. One of the more popular  <br/>
ones is GIF Construction Set:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mindworkshop.com/alchemy/gifcon.html">http://www.mindworkshop.com/alchemy/gifcon.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how easy the program is for kids to understand but you  <br/>
can download a demo there.<br/>
<br/>
Kids Domain has some good downloads for both Macs and PCs in a  <br/>
variety of areas. Some are free. Some are demos.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kidsdomain.com/down/index.html">http://www.kidsdomain.com/down/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see an animation program there but I&#39;m sure there must be one.<br/>
<br/>
(A friend of my daughter&#39;s is going to a technical school and they  <br/>
use Microsoft GIF Animator. It&#39;s free. You&#39;ll need a separate art  <br/>
program to draw the pictures in though.)<br/>
<br/>
If he really gets into it and pushes the GIFs as far as they can go  <br/>
you might want to look into Toon Boom Studio Express:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.toonboom.com/products/toonBoomStudioExpress/">http://www.toonboom.com/products/toonBoomStudioExpress/</a><br/>
<br/>
There are also some kids programs that let you animate other people&#39;s  <br/>
cartoon characters (there&#39;s one for the Simpsons) but I don&#39;t think  <br/>
you can add your own.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, he loves video games, he is wonderful<br/>
&gt; at figuring them out.  Are there any sites to help encourage<br/>
&gt; actually making video games?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s something I posted a while ago. Sorry for the goofy formating.  <br/>
I copied it from Unschooling.info message boards.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; [url=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stagecast.com/&quot;]">http://www.stagecast.com/&quot;]</a>Stagecast Creator[/url] is a good  <br/>
&gt; place to start. He can start making games immediately by just  <br/>
&gt; moving objects around the screen and the program writes the code  <br/>
&gt; for him. But the code is editable so he can start tinkering with it  <br/>
&gt; at any time. They have some really great tutorials that will get  <br/>
&gt; him started quickly. There&#39;s a demo version that limits you to just  <br/>
&gt; a few objects. And, no, he won&#39;t need to know math to program [;)]  <br/>
&gt; But he&#39;ll pick it up as he goes along! [:D]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And something I just found out is that you can write games in  <br/>
&gt; Flash. The great thing about Flash is that he can put his games up  <br/>
&gt; on the internet and let his friends play [:)] (Flash also does  <br/>
&gt; animation among other things.) Macromedia offers a [i]generous[/i]  <br/>
&gt; discount for educators (including homeschoolers). (It&#39;s $99 at the  <br/>
&gt; [url=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/store/index.cfm?store=OLS-">http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/store/index.cfm?store=OLS-</a> <br/>
&gt; EDU&quot;]Education Store[/url]) (It says homeschoolers qualify at their  <br/>
&gt; discretion. If they turn you down I found this list of academic  <br/>
&gt; discounters at Adobe that sell their software (among other things):  <br/>
&gt; [url=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.academic-collegiate.com/products.htm&quot;]">https://www.academic-collegiate.com/products.htm&quot;]</a>Academic &  <br/>
&gt; Collegiate Software[/url]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW, if he thinks he might be interested in doing webpages, you  <br/>
&gt; might give serious consideration to the suite of programs (Studio  <br/>
&gt; MX 2004 for $100 more) that includes Dreamweaver (for creating  <br/>
&gt; webpages), Flash and 2 art programs. (We&#39;ve both used Fireworks a  <br/>
&gt; lot for drawing.) (Without the educator&#39;s discount it&#39;s like $600 [: <br/>
&gt; 0]) Most of the big internet service providers (AOL, Earthlink and  <br/>
&gt; such) have walkthroughs to put up simple webpages so Dreamweaver  <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t necessary but it is nice if he has the urge for less generic  <br/>
&gt; [:)]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are [i]loads[/i] of tutorials about Flash on the internet. A  <br/>
&gt; good beginning might be the Quicktime videos at [url=&quot;http:// <br/>
&gt; www.cartoonsmart.com/&quot;]Cartoon Smart[/url]. Scroll down to the  <br/>
&gt; bottom and there&#39;s one for Video Games. The freebies we  <br/>
&gt; downloaded ... well he didn&#39;t edit out his &quot;Oops, didn&#39;t mean to do  <br/>
&gt; that&quot;s [;)] but they were very easy to use. You just run Flash and  <br/>
&gt; Quicktime at the same time and follow along with what he does. You  <br/>
&gt; can pause and back up just like with a video.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve also heard good things about [url=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/">http://www.ambrosiasw.com/</a> <br/>
&gt; games/coldstone/&quot;]Coldstone Game Engine[/url] for developing RPGs.  <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a demo version at the website to download. I don&#39;t have any  <br/>
&gt; personal experience with it though. If you type Coldstone and  <br/>
&gt; review into Google, that should turn some information up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (For non-Macophiles, as far as I know the above are all available  <br/>
&gt; for Windoze too. There&#39;s also Dark Basic that I&#39;ve heard really  <br/>
&gt; good things about and for which there&#39;s a ton of support and  <br/>
&gt; tutorials. And my daughter took a 2 week full day course at  <br/>
&gt; [url=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://video-game.internaldrive.com/&quot;]">http://video-game.internaldrive.com/&quot;]</a>ID Tech Camps[/url]  <br/>
&gt; where they used [url=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clickteam.com/English/">http://www.clickteam.com/English/</a> <br/>
&gt; multimedia_fusion.htm&quot;]Multimedia Fusion[/url] which she really  <br/>
&gt; liked. (The camp used the standard version at the time. There are  <br/>
&gt; free trials at the website.) She also liked the camp but they were  <br/>
&gt; a bit pricey.)<br/>

Thank you so much for that wealth of information!  It is greatly <br/>
appreciated.  Learning these things with Zak, if he really wants to <br/>
learn them is going to be so much fun.<br/>
