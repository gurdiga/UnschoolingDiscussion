I do agree with you regarding *talking in the car*.<br/>
My dh is not a great talker.  Occasionally dh will take dd to work <br/>
with him.  He is a courier. Every time she goes, he always comes home <br/>
and says what a wonderful time they had and how they chatted all day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-51272357">Car talks are great.  In fact we bought a car without a radio to foster that<br/>
very thing.  The older kids were just becoming teenagers & keeping more to<br/>
themselves.  Plus we were trying to save money.</div>
