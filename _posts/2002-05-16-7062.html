<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040585347">Julie (snort, snort, wiping tears from cheeks from so much laughter)  that <br/>
was just about the best thing I have ever heard!!  Thanks for making my day!  <br/>
<br/>
I can add to that list (although, my 2.5 yo dd also sing &quot;i&#39;m not stupid&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why are your mom&#39;s boob&#39;s so big?&quot;  (3yo friend says to Mira my nearly 5yo <br/>
dd)<br/>
&quot; She probably has a lot of milk in them?&quot; (Mira)<br/>
&quot;Nope, I&#39;m just wearing a padded, push-up bra.&quot; (me, 30 yo barely A cup, <br/>
certainly not lactating for over a year)<br/>
<br/>
I have always thought big boobs are worth discussing, but when you&#39;ve got to <br/>
wear a contraption to just SEEM like a B, I don&#39;t think they qualify as <br/>
&quot;big&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the goats!<br/>

day.  She asked him to show her where her boobies were.  Of course he <br/>
pointed right away.  Then she asked him if he had boobies.  He nodded <br/>
yes.  She asked where they were.  He pointed right away . . . to hers!<br/>

under her arm or somewhere else. &lt;g&gt;  Maybe because she has little or no <br/>
actual milk right now, being 6 months pregnant.<br/>
