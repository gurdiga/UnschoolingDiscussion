<div id="ygrps-yiv-750762970">I asked Marty about WWII ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
A game called Battlefield 1942, he says, has history lessons at the beginning <br/>
of each round/scenario.  Like the Battle of Iwo Jima.  Then you play.  So you <br/>
might need to read those parts to him, but otherwise he could play without <br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
Axis and Allies, a board game, might be of interest.  They have a European <br/>
and then a Pacific.  There are four games of it altogether.  The original is old <br/>
(70&#39;s) but some are by the same company but newer.<br/>
<br/>
He says there are alternative reality games involving WWII, but they might <br/>
involve reading.  (Now that he reads well he&#39;s not so aware of whether there was <br/>
reading or not.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a movie called All the Queen&#39;s Men.  I thought it would be a comedy, <br/>
but it&#39;s not.  There&#39;s a child as a minor character which might interest a <br/>
child.  But if the parents are offended by innuendo (it would go over a kid&#39;s <br/>
head entirely) and cross-dressing, it might not be fun.    But visually, it has <br/>
quite a bit of 1940&#39;s interest.  Kids wouldn&#39;t follow the plot, probably, but <br/>
as a jumping off place for parents to discuss alliances, tanks, code machines, <br/>
POW camps, air raids. . .<br/>
<br/>
It has Matt LeBlanc and Eddie Izzard.  It&#39;s not &quot;a great movie&quot; (in the &quot;ooh, <br/>
what a Great MOVIE!&quot; way), but it&#39;s also not a bloodfest like battlefield <br/>
movies, so they get SOME of the fear and grit without full-on Normandy <br/>
bayonette-and-granade ballet.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids are visual and want a context.  There&#39;s music in it too, which <br/>
would give a historical context for kids who categorize their historical periods <br/>
by which music was popular/new.  (That would be me.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489038686">There is also a computer version of Axis and Allies (my husband and I<br/>
still play it every now and then) and I&#39;m pretty sure it is put out by<br/>
Avalon Hill (make some really cool board games and pc games) there is<br/>
also Panzer General and Panzer General 2 for pc <br/>
I haven&#39;t played them but my husband can&#39;t get enough of them and the<br/>
boys (4,3) love to sit and watch him play it<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782462034">A couple of my favorite WWII movies are &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; and &quot;Hope and <br/>
Glory.&quot;  Both show the war as seen from the British side...one in England and one <br/>
in occupied China (if I remember that correctly.)  And both are from the <br/>
viewpoint of a young boy...maybe 10 to 12 years old.  <br/>
<br/>
Empire of the Sun can be a little scary in parts, but the history in it is <br/>
GREAT.  Hope and Glory has a couple of racy scenes, but I don&#39;t believe any <br/>
nudity.<br/>
