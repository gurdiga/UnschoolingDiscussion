<div id="ygrps-yiv-490815027">Maybe you could practice a couple of responses before going out?  Say to him something like: people who see young children with long hair, especially those who have poor eyesight, may conclude you are a girl.  It isn&#39;t that you look girlish in any other way; but an elderly person, for instance, seeing your long hair, but unable to distinguish your features, may call you a girl, or refer to you as a girl, because your hair is the most significant feature.<br/>
<br/>
Long hair held in a ponytail (and very little hair any where else) and fairly big ones on the chest, but my manner,  I guess, often made me appear, to others, especially the elderly, like a boy.  What can I do?  I am me, and your son is himself.  Let him know that what someone else sees him as is not who he is.  <br/>
<br/>
Presentation is important sometimes, but does anyone remember that story of the gorgeous cake that turned out to be a pasteboard display in a shop?  If you are interested in it, I will try and find the name of the story and perhaps you could read it to him.   Point being what I said above.  He shouldn&#39;t feel upset or angered by the judgement of others....<br/>
<br/>
That is more important, imho, than the string of foul words that come out, but a symptom of his feeling judged....<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

My kids all have brown eyes, but Holly&#39;s blonde.  It might not last to <br/>
adulthood.  Marty started off tow-headed, but now keeps it shaved so we don&#39;t <br/>
know how it would grow out.  Keith was blond but it&#39;s almost all white and <br/>
grey now.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I got this with my kids a lot too until I permed my hair.  My children have <br/>
very curly hair, like their father.  Mine was straight.  I think people just <br/>
say the first thing that comes through their brains when they see cute kids.  <br/>
what I really dislike is all the tossling of their hair.  Sometimes my <br/>
children don&#39;t like it either.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>My story might be interesting to you. I never knew my biological <br/>
father (I&#39;ll call him &quot;bf&quot;). My mom married my stepdad when I was an <br/>
infant. My parentage was not a secret but it was not a hot topic <br/>
either. People often say I look just like my mom, only blonde haired <br/>
and blue eyed (from bf), but the truth is the similarity is due more <br/>
to voice, mannerisms and personality. However, I&#39;m am also definitely <br/>
my father&#39;s (stepdad) daughter. I share his out-spoken nature (some <br/>
say tactless; consider yourself forewarned &lt;beg&gt;), his perfectionism <br/>
and, strangely enough, his poor eyesight.<br/>
<br/>
My stepdads family has never treated my as anything other than his <br/>
true daughter. So much so that many of my relatives have forgotten <br/>
that I was not his biological child. And to complicate matters even <br/>
more, I actually DO share his (my stepdads) genetics in a sort of <br/>
round about way through my cousins. My mom&#39;s brother married my <br/>
stepdads sister, so my aunt and uncle and their children are related <br/>
to me on both sides of my family. People often say my cousins and I <br/>
are more like sisters; we look and act very much alike even though <br/>
they really bear a resemblance to my STEPDADS side of the family.<br/>
<br/>
After I had children I became suddenly interested in knowing more <br/>
about my ancestry (anyone else experience this?) and I recently <br/>
decided to see if I could locate my bf, just for curiosity&#39;s sake. I <br/>
had one picture of my bf and thought my ds, who doesn&#39;t really look <br/>
like anyone else in the family, bore a resemblance to him. <br/>
<br/>
I ended up in contact with an aunt and a half-brother I didn&#39;t know I <br/>
had. Here&#39;s another interesting piece of the story. A few months ago <br/>
I got to speak with my newly found half-brother (we&#39;re both 40yo btw, <br/>
another interesting tidbit) and we share many PERSONALITY traits! And <br/>
he says our bf also shares some of those traits (turns out that my bf <br/>
also did the same thing to my half brother&#39;s mom, married her then <br/>
skipped town leaving her with an infant to raise).<br/>
<br/>
So, where does nature end and nurture begin? If anyone suggested to <br/>
my stepdads family that I wasn&#39;t really his daughter because I didn&#39;t <br/>
share his genes they would call that person nuts! It&#39;s so obvious to <br/>
anyone who knows us that I am his daughter because we seem to share <br/>
so much, both personality-wise and physically. And yet if I ever <br/>
actually meet my bf I&#39;m sure it will be apparent that I&#39;m also HIS <br/>
daughter, too.<br/>
<br/>
Something to think about.<br/>

that my beloved daddy was not my &quot;real&quot; dad. It was not traumatic AT <br/>
ALL. More interesting than anything else.)</div>

adoptees that do.<br/>
I have an automatic sense of belonging to my mother&#39;s side of the family, but <br/>
not to my father&#39;s. I would expect that many of my cousins feel that way <br/>
about his side also.<br/>
 The experience of learning that one is adopted seems to<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would think so if a parent or parents never told the child until they were <br/>
older.! What a shock! Our culture has continually perpetuated the myth that <br/>
adopted children are different than biological, that the stereotype of child <br/>
doesn&#39;t know and surprise! When they are ten they figure it out and ask the <br/>
parents then run away because tehy feel so betrayed.<br/>
I never &quot;learned&quot; I was adopted, I have always known it. Everyone I know that <br/>
was adopted has always known. My feeling of belonging to my Mom doesn&#39;t feel <br/>
any different to me than my feeling that my children belong to me.<br/>
At least I always knew I was wanted, sought after and chosen. What a <br/>
blessing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868612691">the other side to this is that my daughters, who would pass for twins if <br/>
they weren&#39;t four years apart, would prefer if they didn&#39;t look so much <br/>
alike, and have developed very different styles of dressing and hair. We <br/>
talk about genetics and ancestry but more from an interest point of <br/>
view.  We one time had a discussion of ethnic history. One dd doesn&#39;t <br/>
like that the ethnic heritage that she has the least interest in is the <br/>
one that is the largest % of her genetic makeup. We discussed how that <br/>
didn&#39;t matter - adopt the heritage or country you are most interested in <br/>
and learn about that, be part of that if you want. Choose one that isn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;you&quot; if you want. However, while hubby is of only one ethnic <br/>
background, a friend once joked that my family tree looked like the UN. <br/>
&lt;lol&gt; - so it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to find things. Other dd is <br/>
interested in all things Jewish, and is very drawn to Jewish culture and <br/>
holidays. It turns out that I have a Jewish great-aunt, (not a &quot;blood&quot; <br/>
relative) who lived in Brooklyn. Good enough.  The other part is, we <br/>
have three children who are biological, the two step-children are both <br/>
adopted. It doesn&#39;t seem to affect how the kids see family or <br/>
themselves, other than the curiosity that adopted kids often have about <br/>
their biological parents.<br/>

sorry.. kind of a rambling, disconnected post.<br/>
