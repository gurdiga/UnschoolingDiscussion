<br/>
Hubby and I watched this movie last night, Into the wild:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.intothewild.com/">http://www.intothewild.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
(fyi, we loved it).  Usually watching a movie I imagine myself as the<br/>
main character but in watching this movie I was imagining the main<br/>
character as one of my kids, watching it from a parent perspective.  I&#39;m<br/>
recommending it here because the movie is about the true life journey<br/>
for this young man, one I think started as a journey to escape his<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
DH and I both have strained relationships with our parents (he more than<br/>
I, much more), I&#39;ll just sum it up as we both tended to do just the<br/>
opposite of what any one of them would say.  And we both took journeys<br/>
to escape.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t arrive at unschooling through any certain path (attachment<br/>
parenting, la leche league, and some of the other paths that seem fairly<br/>
logical).  It happened for us through trial and error. I&#39;ve made my<br/>
share of mistakes, unfortunately, and unfortunately still do, but I&#39;m<br/>
determined to be a better parent so my kids can just be (be themselves,<br/>
be happy, be independent).  Unschooling came into our lives because it<br/>
is a perfect fit.    I don&#39;t know how else you can raise independent,<br/>
happy kids w/out them being able to make informed choices about their<br/>
own lives.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking back I may have started homeschooling for educational purposes,<br/>
thinking my kids would get the best education at home. Then I thought<br/>
the best way to educate them was by unschooling them and giving them<br/>
more freedom.  Now, it&#39;s no longer about their education (per say), it&#39;s<br/>
about their happiness and how they feel about themselves and  how they<br/>
see themselves.   Learning w/ meaning for them, not necessarily meaning<br/>
for me (acceptance on my part).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I wanted to recommend that movie here.  It touched me and made<br/>
me want to be a better parent.  Life is short, too short for some.  Our<br/>
time being our children&#39;s parents is short, we don&#39;t have time for<br/>
mistakes.   Unschooling  has been one of the best choices I&#39;ve made for<br/>
my kids and learning about unschooling and becoming an unschooler has<br/>
been a great journey for me and my self improvement.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and personally, running is my mental savior.  Running outside...and<br/>
it&#39;s been a loooong winter here in Iowa.  I am ready for spring and<br/>
ready to run outside!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the recommendation - actually the reminder, I&#39;ve seen<br/>
previews of this and wanted to see it.  (I&#39;ll actually watch anything<br/>
Sean Penn touches.)  The movie website and it&#39;s accompanying music<br/>
alone put me in an emotional/reflective state.  <br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to comment that I think almost all movies can be used<br/>
along the lines of self-improvement.  I personally get very wrapped up<br/>
in the emotions of just about any movie and find myself reflecting on<br/>
my own thoughts and feelings that surface from almost every single one<br/>
I watch.  It&#39;s cathartic for the mind and soul, especially the ones<br/>
that bring tears.  <br/>
<br/>
I read somewhere along my own self-improvement journey that we don&#39;t<br/>
have to necessarily re-live our past painful experiences to move past<br/>
them; we simply need to experience the attached emotion and move<br/>
through it.  Getting caught up in the emotions of a movie is one way I<br/>
have found that helps to easily access those emotions (especially the<br/>
emotions we stifle) without getting caught up in all the details of<br/>
our hurts, experience these emotions, and then let them go.  <br/>
<br/>
I have many examples, but the 2 that stick out in my mind the most<br/>
were when I got divorced in my 20s and after my grandfather passed<br/>
away.  I am the stiff-upper lip kind of person, always put on a front<br/>
of strength in front of others, so perhaps that&#39;s why movies are my<br/>
best form of therapy - I can express emotion and move on without<br/>
really having to go into the painful details that caused the emotion.  <br/>
<br/>
Following my separation from my ex-husband, I watched a movie (can&#39;t<br/>
remember the name) that wasn&#39;t overwhelmingly sad, but my emotions<br/>
were just under the surface and easily accessible.  I was home alone<br/>
in my empty house, the movie brought the emotions up, and I bawled my<br/>
eyes out for I don&#39;t know how long.  Then I was done, and I was able<br/>
to move forward with my life with hardly a tear afterwards.  <br/>
<br/>
Second, when my grandfather passed away a few years ago, I went back<br/>
to my hometown and spent the week catering to my mother (her father),<br/>
again being &quot;the strong one&quot;.  Upon returning to my own home, I<br/>
watched Ladder 49 (without realizing the potential implications). <br/>
Well, that&#39;s a really sad movie to begin with, and again I bawled. <br/>
And, once again, my grief moved through me, and I was done.  <br/>
<br/>
As for self-improvement with regards to healing our past childhood<br/>
hurts, I think I&#39;ve had the same experiences with movies though I<br/>
can&#39;t remember specifics, probably because I didn&#39;t realize it at the<br/>
time, but I know there are mother/daughter movies that have brought me<br/>
tears.  Through self-improvement, I have healed a lot of old hurts<br/>
that I&#39;ve held from issues with my mom, and I think movies have helped<br/>
in this regard.  Makes me want to go find some more, and I&#39;ll<br/>
definitely be watching &quot;Into the Wild&quot; now.  <br/>

a moving song before you see the movie, wait til after!!  :)<br/>
<br/>
I saw the movie Sunday and if I thought about it Monday, I still cried! <br/>

<br/>
There are therapists using movies specifically.  And there&#39;s a great  <br/>
book about the philosophy in movies by one of my favorite  <br/>
&quot;connections&quot; authors ever, Dean Sluyter.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Totally, and for me it&#39;s not only movies: books (novels) and listening<br/>
to/reading other people&#39;s stories also does it.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in my mid-20&#39;s and just coming out of a very long<br/>
depression that started in my teens, I read _She&#39;s come undone_ by<br/>
Wally Lamb, and that was like a mini therapy all by itself.  (his<br/>
other novel, _I know this much is true_ is also very therapeutic)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny, I&#39;m at the beginning of my parenting journey, and<br/>
technically not unschooling since my (for now) only child is only 2.5<br/>
years old, but unschooling is soooo appealing to me, and I sooo get<br/>
it, and I just can&#39;t stop reading on all the unschooling lists, and<br/>
Sandra&#39;s website, and Joyce&#39;s website, and all the others... and this<br/>
week end I downloaded the complete audio of the 2005 and 2006 Live and<br/>
Learn conferences and listened to practically all of it.  And it<br/>
finally dawned on me today as I was crying for the nth time as I was<br/>
listening to one of the talks, that the reason I get it, and the<br/>
reason I want to listen to and read about stories of these joyful<br/>
childhoods (and especially about teens), is because it&#39;s very<br/>
therapeutic for me. I can sort of re-live my own adolescence picturing<br/>
how it would have been if I had been unschooled, and if I had had<br/>
supportive parents.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same for Terry (my SO).  His grandpa passed away a year ago in<br/>
January.  This entire past year he has listened to everything Johnny<br/>
Cash and other favorite artists/songs of his grandpa&#39;s.  He has also<br/>
watched the movie Walk the Line enough times that you&#39;d think it was<br/>
his favorite.  He knew he was listening to his grandpa&#39;s music, but<br/>
didn&#39;t make the connection that it was actually his way of grieving<br/>
until we talked about it.  <br/>
<br/>
After Terry broke up with his last fiance before we met, he listened<br/>
to A LOT of music.  When he shared some of it with me, I thought it<br/>
was the most depressing collection I&#39;d ever heard, but it was HIS<br/>
process.  <br/>
<br/>
After I finished high school and subsequently college, I listened to a<br/>
lot of my favorite music from each era respectively, I think as a way<br/>
to grieve the end of those times.  <br/>
<br/>
So, yeah, music is definitely therapeutic too.  Books certainly would<br/>
be included as well.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you seen the movie, &quot;High Fidelity&quot;?  In one scene, the main  <br/>
character rearranges his copious record collection by breakups.  Great  <br/>
movie for lots of reasons :-)<br/>
