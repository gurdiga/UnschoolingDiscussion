&#39;peeling&#39;? It sounds to my like you are removing the bark??<br/>

<br/>
Oh.  Playing with the bark from cedar.  It&#39;s easy to split, and the bark has <br/>
about 30 layers, sometimes that can be stripped into really thin, curly bits. <br/>
 It&#39;s a mindless sort of thing to do while I watch videos, but tonight I was <br/>
too weak and brainless to find a video so I watched TV.   And filled up a box <br/>
with easy-to-start tiny kindling.   I was creating excelsior, but am not <br/>
going to pack anything in it.<br/>
<br/>
Also it&#39;s a good excuse to sit right at the hearth and play with the fire.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt Americans guessed any better than you did, Carol.  Sorry.  (My <br/>
friends and relatives would have known.  I give the stuff away to friends <br/>
with fireplaces, so they have something artsy to use instead of newspaper to <br/>
start fires.  And I give it to them in ratty baskets I get from garage sales. <br/>
 When the baskets get old they&#39;re kindling too.)<br/>
