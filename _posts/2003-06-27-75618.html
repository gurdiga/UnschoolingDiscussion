OK.  I only itch when I walk really fast.  I can walk moderately for an hour <br/>
and I&#39;m fine.  I can walk really fast for five minutes and I want to tear my <br/>
thighs off.  I&#39;m really scrawny, so it&#39;s not a friction thing from rubbed <br/>
together thighs.  Benadryl makes it better.  Any ideas what&#39;s going on?<br/>
