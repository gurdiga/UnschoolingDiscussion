<div id="ygrps-yiv-354692509">Hi Lorrie and welcome,<br/>
I wanted to share some thoughts about reading.  First of all, I really<br/>
believe in delayed academics and following a child&#39;s own schedule with<br/>
regard to learning things.  That&#39;s what unschooling is to me, child-led.<br/>
Just like letting the child learn to potty or wean or ride a bike or climb a<br/>
tree, if you wait until the child is ready it&#39;s a lot easier.<br/>
<br/>
But mostly I wanted to say that although I like your idea about a treasure<br/>
hunt as a way to get you son to read, I don&#39;t think that external rewards<br/>
are the right way to encourage him.  I have always felt that if you start<br/>
&quot;paying&quot; a child to do anything then it becomes a quest for the reward only.<br/>
I have never given my child gold stars or other external rewards.  We don&#39;t<br/>
sign up for Book-It or the summer reading program at the library because I<br/>
don&#39;t want him reading a certain number of books just to get his prize.  I<br/>
want him to read just because it&#39;s fun.<br/>
<br/>
So I agree with what others have posted, let your son pick things he would<br/>
like to read.  Let him check out books just to look at.  Read to him every<br/>
day.  Read things to him that are above his reading level....I have a 7 year<br/>
old son.  We&#39;ve read the Harry Potter Books, The Hobbit and are now reading<br/>
Redwall.  He loves these books.  He also listens to a lot of books on tape,<br/>
especially in the car, like Johnny Tremain, Ella Enchanted, Jeremy Thatcher<br/>
Dragon Hatcher.  He&#39;s actually started reading some of Bruce Coville&#39;s stuff<br/>
this year.<br/>
<br/>
Once your son sees what kind of fun stuff is in books, he&#39;ll want to read.<br/>
Don&#39;t stick to things &quot;on his reading level&quot;.   And try not to reward him<br/>
externally, let the reward of enjoying a book be all there is.  He&#39;ll learn<br/>
to love it without the pressure.  Public schools operate on external rewards<br/>
only, hence grades and gold stars and &quot;free time&quot; if you finish something<br/>
early, etc.  Try not to let your home become like schools.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t read it yet, I would recommend Mary Griffith&#39;s The<br/>
Unschoolers Handbook.  It&#39;s a practical guide to letting your child learn<br/>
from everyday life.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and try not to stress over it.  Take this spring and summer to<br/>
deschool & learn even more about homeschooling.<br/>
