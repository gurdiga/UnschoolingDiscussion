<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480842798">I really can&#39;t think of any stress I have with<br/>
unschooling.  The &quot;getting it&quot; part would have to be<br/>
the last time I was stressing about it.  But once you<br/>
have that...truly have it...then it really can be<br/>
smooth sailing.<br/>
<br/>
Recently on a local general homeschooling list I am<br/>
on, a mother asked for pros and cons about<br/>
homeschooling.  Everything one went on and on about<br/>
both.  Cons were stuff like &quot;not enough time for<br/>
myself&quot;, &quot;money spent on curriculums&quot;, &quot;messy house&quot;. <br/>
I bothered a few people because I said that I really<br/>
don&#39;t have any &quot;cons&quot;.  Their cons were not things<br/>
that exist in our world, and if they could exist, I<br/>
don&#39;t consider them to be a &quot;con&quot;.  One mom responded<br/>
to me that &quot;homeschooling has pros and cons just like<br/>
parenting does&quot;.   Well, maybe to her, but it is all<br/>
in how you look at things.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, unschooling has to be the most stress-free<br/>
way to homeschool.  Everytime someone posts on another<br/>
list about being stressed, I think about how NOT<br/>
stressed we are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323932225">How appropriate!!  I have been away from my lurker status on this list<br/>
for most of the last year, and have returned because I&#39;m beginning to<br/>
feel stressed!!  <br/>
<br/>
Here at the start of the conventional &quot;new school year&quot; I find myself<br/>
once again wondering if I&#39;m doing the right thing, are the kids<br/>
learning anything, should I be doing more (=working harder)?  And my<br/>
very first day back on digest for this loop, I get such wonderful<br/>
encouragement!  <br/>
<br/>
I have few local unschooling friends.  The majority of my homeschool<br/>
contacts locally are pretty structured and I see them barricade<br/>
themselves into their &quot;school rooms&quot; every August and get so busy! It<br/>
makes me wonder why anyone would go to all that trouble if they didn&#39;t<br/>
have to, as well as, maybe I&#39;m not doing enough because we don&#39;t do<br/>
that every August (or May, either, when they are so intent on<br/>
&quot;finishing&quot; their expensive curriculum).  <br/>
<br/>
BUT--my 8 year old has learned to read, especially since I decided<br/>
last year to be &quot;serious&quot; about unschooling, or as I told her--no more<br/>
pushing!   Having them learn to read was always a big one for me,<br/>
since from there they can learn anything, and now that the first one<br/>
is doing it and enjoying it, I&#39;m not worried about her almost 5yo<br/>
brother.  <br/>
<br/>
I marvel daily at how imaginative they are and that, while TV is fun,<br/>
they choose to turn it off and go create huge worlds of fun playing in<br/>
their rooms.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m grateful that we were able, while most of their friends were<br/>
&quot;starting school&quot;, to take a family trip to Washington, DC, where they<br/>
 learned so much about living and getting around in a big city, the<br/>
history of our country, and what completely thrills Mom and Dad<br/>
(history/gov&#39;t/seeing all that cool stuff we&#39;d heard about all our<br/>
lives, etc).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also grateful for this list and the chance to hear from other<br/>
families who are not stressed and still learning (what a concept!). <br/>
Maybe I should stick around more often!<br/>

*************************************<br/>
Ah, sacrifice....<br/>
 <br/>
I always thought that sacrificing oneself (metaphorically, not in some  &quot;I&#39;ll <br/>
throw myself in front of the lion so it won&#39;t eat my child&quot; thing) for  one&#39;s <br/>
children is one of the worst things a parent can do to their kid. <br/>
 <br/>
The kid didn&#39;t ask for it, and it&#39;ll just lead to resentment on the  parent&#39;s <br/>
part (or martyrdom, maybe even worse) and guilt and resentment on the  <br/>
child&#39;s part. Not happy and healthy.<br/>
 <br/>
My ex-in-laws did that to their kids, and it&#39;s a disaster. No one can just  <br/>
be happy for one another or celebrate success and joy. <br/>
 <br/>
But to do things with and for your child with joy? To also do the things  YOU <br/>
want to do, and find gradually that your child is your biggest supporter?  <br/>
How wonderful is that?<br/>
 <br/>
Throughout the planning of the Peabody Live and Learn conference,  Julian <br/>
helped so much, and he was happy and proud of me when it was such a  success. <br/>
 <br/>
I think forgetting the sacrifice and embracing the relationship would be  the <br/>
way to go.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I disagree.   That&#39;s not to say I think it is the idea., but there needs to <br/>
be a balance.<br/>
Some parents make no sacrifices at all.   They (parents) resent any <br/>
inconvenience their children cause them.   <br/>
<br/>
If the only two options were zero sacrifice and total sacrifice, total <br/>
sacrifice would be better for the children.      Those are not at all the only two <br/>
options.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, but not if it&#39;s *rejecting* any sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
What if Julian had really, truly not wanted you to do that conference and <br/>
every moment of work or discussion on it wounded him and your relationship?   <br/>

websites and magazines and newspapers for the rest of their lives.   They will <br/>
also learn from hearing others discuss, seeing others do, watching videos.<br/>

how much our attitude toward books has changed and should change.   They&#39;re <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116661209">And that&#39;s another thing!!  This list can really make a person think!<br/>
 I have never even thought that there might be those that think that<br/>
books are  &quot;given way too much glory&quot;.  This is definitely one part of<br/>
homeschooling that I truly value--being able to learn new things, too.<br/>
 And it almost proves your point, I suppose, about books, that I<br/>
learned of your thoughts on them from something other than a book.<br/>
Honestly, I&#39;m not very inclined to read a book that is anti-book<br/>
(yeah, sounds a little farfetched) because I&#39;m less likely to devote<br/>
the time to something that is so very far outside of my realm of<br/>
thought.  But, in the context of an email loop, there it is!  (That<br/>
point being that books may not be the best source, or even a source at<br/>
all, for certain information that doesn&#39;t already interest or intrigue<br/>
the reader.  Maybe books don&#39;t expand ALL our horizons!  This is<br/>
something I&#39;ve never considered.)<br/>
<br/>
True confession:  I have happily described myself for years as a &quot;book<br/>
addict&quot;.  We go to the library at least once a week and I usually have<br/>
2 or 3 books I&#39;m reading at any given time.  It thrills me to no end<br/>
when I see my kids looking through books.  Maybe I&#39;m not the computer<br/>
literate that some are, but we do use the internet for looking up<br/>
things.  We also learn from TV, other people, travel, experience, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If there is something I want to learn about in depth, some issue that<br/>
has arisen which I need info/advice/thoughts on, I almost always hear<br/>
myself say, &quot;I&#39;ll see if I can find a book about that.&quot;  For in depth<br/>
 learning, this is generally my first choice.  I read a book once (!)<br/>
about birth-order that said that the tendency to always turn to books<br/>
for learning is a trait of the first-born or only child.  So, of<br/>
course, Sandra, I&#39;m curious as to where you fall in the birth order of<br/>
your family.  NOT that I am in any way trying to down grade your<br/>
thoughts and attribute them to birth order!!  I&#39;m quite intrigued by<br/>
this and will try to spend some more time today to read your<br/>
previously written thoughts on this at your website (skimmed some<br/>
already this a.m.).    <br/>
<br/>
If anything, I will think carefully about whether I&#39;m stressing the<br/>
importance of books too much to my children.  Our &quot;no pushing&quot; policy<br/>
may need some shoring up in that area.  So thank you for making me<br/>
think!!!!<br/>

planned for years, and one of the many things that made it easy to stall was my <br/>
growing belief that people&#39;s book worship is a problem in lots of ways.   I like <br/>
and am making good use of the fact that people will listen to me (and even <br/>
sometimes invite me to speak) even without a book.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met authors of books that were chucked together lamely, or drawn out to <br/>
amke a single bad point.   Books aren&#39;t necessarily knowledge.   Books won&#39;t <br/>
necessarily make a person think.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Honestly, I&#39;m not very inclined to read a book that is anti-book<br/>
(yeah, sounds a little farfetched)-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there are any, are there?<br/>
I own   some very very pro-book books, and it&#39;s a religious-experience-like <br/>
comfort to read them.   My fantasy life and second focus has always been the <br/>
Middle Ages.   Then, books were something to worship.   And our culture grew <br/>
straight out of that.   The development of the printing press didn&#39;t make book <br/>
creating easier, just enabled them to make dozens of copies of a book (and <br/>
eventually hundreds) rather than just one at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Now (this week and recently) I can get as many copies of a book as I want <br/>
without anyone else (editor, publisher) saying &quot;Okay, that&#39;s good enough for us; <br/>
we want to print this.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
Whatever barriers there were between creation of a manuscript and production <br/>
of books is gone now.   Even when there WERE barriers, lots of books were <br/>
crap.   The ratio of crap to carefully considered and approved by groups books <br/>
will never be the same.   I have a couple of freaky books from some decades back <br/>
that probably only exist because the author or his buddy owned a printing <br/>
press.   I should get rid of my mainstream books and only collect freakish books <br/>
not worth the paper they&#39;re on.   (If any of you find such a collection in <br/>
existence maybe I&#39;ll just send my books along there.   Not mine that I wrote, but <br/>
mine that I have saved as oddities.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-If there is something I want to learn about in depth, some issue that<br/>
has arisen which I need info/advice/thoughts on, I almost always hear<br/>
myself say, &quot;I&#39;ll see if I can find a book about that.&quot;  For in depth<br/>
learning, this is generally my first choice. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Used to be mine.<br/>
Now I&#39;m frustrated that the book might be outdated.   <br/>
I really don&#39;t like seeing website addresses in books.   THAT seems crazy.   <br/>
Every day that passes, more andmore of that book becomes obsolete.   A few <br/>
books have published my name and phone number and address.   One asked, years <br/>
ago.   I objected on principle, but agreed.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I read a book once (!)<br/>
about birth-order that said that the tendency to always turn to books<br/>
for learning is a trait of the first-born or only child.  So, of<br/>
course, Sandra, I&#39;m curious as to where you fall in the birth order. . .-=-<br/>
<br/>
Firstborn.<br/>
Owner of a few thousand books, can name MANY I&#39;ve given away or sold that I <br/>
wish I had back again.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wanted to underscore this idea.<br/>
<br/>
Three of my five kids are late readers. My youngest still isn&#39;t a<br/>
fluent reader at 9. She can sound words out painstakingly but often<br/>
misses them.<br/>
<br/>
However, she is an amazingly observant person (because she doesn&#39;t<br/>
read). Just yesterday we were working our way through an Arthur book<br/>
that she wanted to try. She got tired and asked me to read it to her<br/>
so I did. The first page said that the kids in school should line up<br/>
alphabetically. I was reading the words, oblivious to the pictures. In<br/>
fact, I almost never look at pictures when reading kids&#39; books because<br/>
the &quot;real&quot; meaning is in words, isn&#39;t it? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She stops me to say: Mom the artist didn&#39;t put the kids in<br/>
alphabetical order. See? She started listing their names and sure<br/>
enough, they were nowhere near alphabetical. She has handwritten the<br/>
alphabet so often that she knows the order inside out. I got such a<br/>
kick out of her making that correlation.<br/>
<br/>
She figures stuff out all the time without knowing how to read based<br/>
on visual cues that I routinely miss.<br/>
<br/>
Also, she loves to write. She has notebooks filled with scrawl, then<br/>
letters and now her own invented spelling. She writes! But can&#39;t read.<br/>
<br/>
And another ironic bit. She has learned the entire Greek alphabet<br/>
-both upper and lower case. Because she is not bound by English in the<br/>
way fluent readers are, she is at ease with the Greek alphabet and<br/>
writes all her friends&#39; names in Greek phonetics.<br/>
<br/>
The whole process of letting her learn to read without a program and<br/>
without my worry or fear has been fascinating! She&#39;s a very aware,<br/>
self-educated little missie and she hasn&#39;t read an entire book yet.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, she also plays games on websites and figures out how to login,<br/>
play the games and beat them without reading. I have NO idea how she<br/>
manages. But I have a hunch her skill set will be much more diverse<br/>
when she finally does read because of these years of patient<br/>
observation and detective work.<br/>

Well, the technology was new, that must have made it seem snazzy.<br/>
<br/>
In Connections (the DVDs on my TV, not the book) the underlying theme <br/>
seems to be about knowledge moving from place to place and colliding <br/>
with new knowledge.  Making &quot;communications&quot; faster and cheaper had to <br/>
be a big driving force here in enabling connections to be made that led <br/>
to change.<br/>
<br/>
All I learned in school about Guttenberg was &quot;movable type&quot;, &quot;first <br/>
printing press&quot; and &quot;Guttenberg bible&quot;.  (If pressed, I could have <br/>
probably stated he was German.)  In the Connections show it showed me <br/>
that it wasn&#39;t just that he started using movable type, but that he came <br/>
up with *an effecient way to cast type in identical interchangeable <br/>
sizes*.  Seeing this demonstrated was really cool, and not something <br/>
that a book could have showed well.<br/>

they can grow into.<br/>
Her first game was Barbie Ocean Discovery. It was great to introduce her to <br/>
the gameboy, because it&#39;s pretty simple.<br/>
She even enjoys a few of the old arcade games which are available for <br/>

Along the same lines, kids and parents both stressing when peers of the  <br/>
teens start applying to colleges, taking SAT&#39;s, getting scholarships.  <br/>
 <br/>
Since our move, we have been around family with the main topic of  <br/>
conversation has been the other cousins &quot;academic&quot; accomplishments,  scholarships, etc.  <br/>
We haven&#39;t been around this before and I can see that  it is causing some <br/>
stress.<br/>

<br/>
My personal biggest stressors are things that I would have even if merely<br/>
Home Schooling - tiredness from our unusual sleep schedule, not enough time<br/>
with dh, objectionable neighbor kids, our apartment too small for our stuff.<br/>
<br/>
However there is a lady on the AU list who is feeling a lot of anguish over<br/>
her eldest dd&#39;s desire to be in school (Kindergarten). I would think that<br/>
fear would be a stressor. <br/>
<br/>
But by comparison....much less stress and worry.<br/>

<br/>
Finances.  Sometimes I feel that I should get a job in order to accomodate the lifestyle we would love to have.  But I don&#39;t want to put my kids in school or daycare so that I can earn more money.  I&#39;ve been attempting to earn more from home, which brings in a few nickels and dimes only, so far.  Tuition for activities.  Equipment for activities.  Trying to figure out how to say yes to the kids when dh and I are saying no to ourselves because of our finances.  Trying not to think of the price of gas when I have made my 6th trip into town in two days driving children to and from activities.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t think of anything else.  But those two above do stress me.<br/>

his teacher - DS simply said I&#39;m my own teacher and didn&#39;t back <br/>
down - the adult just moved on after the second or third time he <br/>
said it, not taking her &#39;cues&#39; as to the &quot;right answer.&quot; When she <br/>
came to tell me this &#39;humorous story&#39;, I grinned at her and <br/>
said &quot;He&#39;s right&quot;. Confused her a bit.<br/>
<br/>
More recently, someone new to homeschooling asked if DS could read. <br/>
We said yes. Next question was &quot;How did you teach him to read?&quot; DH <br/>
and I simultaneously said &quot;We didn&#39;t&quot; then glanced at each other and <br/>
grinned for saying the same thing simultaneously like that. I&#39;ve <br/>
often said if I could figure out exactly how DS learned to read, I <br/>
could box it up and do an infomercial and get rich. But that&#39;s <br/>
pretty impossible since it was a unique, organic thing - what he did <br/>
is unique to him and how someone else would learn is unique to that <br/>
person.<br/>

biggest concern is what would happen to the kids if I&#39;m not here to stay <br/>
home with them. Dh and I have talked about how he might be able to swing <br/>
unschooling as a single parent, but I&#39;m not convinced he&#39;d remain <br/>
committed once the reality set in--it&#39;s really my thing. If we both <br/>
went, I don&#39;t know what would happen, quite frankly. Not something I <br/>
walk around stressing about--more like an inthebackofmymind kind of thing.<br/>

<br/>
This is why I started reading this list again.  My eldest is on a sleep all <br/>
day, play WoW all night, never see him, am worried his brain is atrophying.....<br/>
<br/>
I trust that a child living a rich and varied life will learn everything he <br/>
needs to.  I&#39;ve gotten over that hurdle.  But I&#39;m worried now that my kids <br/>
aren&#39;t getting that life.  I have some things going on that I really do <br/>
*HAVE* to handle (CYS interference) which is taking up kid time, but I <br/>
realize that I&#39;m just not in the habit of spending real kid time them.<br/>
<br/>
The little ones spend more time with me because they have to--they have to <br/>
come to the store with me, etc, because they are little.  But the big one <br/>
is old enough to stay home and he does.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve started DVR&#39;ing TV shows I know he likes or ones I think we could <br/>
watch together.  (I recommend Truth or Scare, hosted by Michelle <br/>
Tractenburg, btw, for the tween set.)  I invited him last night and we hung <br/>
out for hours watching tv, talking.  It was GREAT!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, rambling over, unschoolers can stress that they aren&#39;t providing a <br/>
rich enough environment for their kids and how to do that outside of the <br/>
familiar (ie, schooly stuff.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
