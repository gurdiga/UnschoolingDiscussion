<div id="ygrps-yiv-316519760">BTW - that quote is a rather well known one<br/>

Something I&#39;ve never heard, nor had my circle once I brought it up.  I wonder <br/>

We don&#39;t get Fox 5 here, I&#39;m not sure what that is, but we do get Fox News.  <br/>
Five examples in a slew of networks, newspapers, magazines, etc. still leaves <br/>
me wondering.  However, I do agree with whoever said it all depends on where <br/>
you are coming from what your point of view is on this.  Sean Hannity of Fox <br/>
News is presented in a fair and balanced way, though, because he is up against <br/>
his opposite, Alan Colmes, so I&#39;m certainly not buying that as right-wing <br/>
domination.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heather has taken an interest in how the news is presented so we watched <br/>
Hannity and Colmes. Colmes is presented as his &#39;opposite&#39; but even my 11 <br/>
yo noticed that the man spent most of his time agreeing with hannity&#39;s <br/>
rants.<br/>
These things stick out like sore thumbs to us but then Europe has a much <br/>
freer press which does tend to question the Govt and be more liberal.<br/>
We used to listen to Bill O&#39;Reilly and Good Ol&#39; Rush for the sheer jaw <br/>
dropping amazement. Heather wanted to know why those two hated just <br/>
about everyone who wasn&#39;t white male and Christian. Hard to explain the <br/>
why&#39;s n wherefore&#39;s to an 11 yo.<br/>
Fortunately for me Heather is now interested in something else but she <br/>
did make an observation based on her previous fascination with <br/>
advertising, that if you say something enough then poeple will believe <br/>
it depiste evidence to the contrary. &quot;The media is liberal&quot; &quot;Iraq was <br/>
involved in 9/11&quot; (50% of Americans still belive that one) &quot;Bowflex will <br/>
you you the perfect body in 6 weeks&quot; ahem, Yeah sure.<br/>
Anyway, I should get packing.<br/>
