<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760857618">I have no idea whether you&#39;ve already tried this or whether it will work but here is a left/right trick that someone taught my kids that worked really well.  If you hold up your hands in front of you<br/>

<br/>
My daughter, who is 10 and still not really reading, has always mixed up the b and the d.  My son who is 7 and is reading does it too though.  I think it&#39;s pretty common.  My daughter also mirror wrote<br/>
for a long time.  I never corrected it and she eventually straightened it out.  I think it&#39;s just how the brain is wired and that it will move on to the standard way when it is good and ready.  Your son<br/>
may see lots of things from a different angle than most of us.  Who knows, this might be a real gift that he will be able to use later if people don&#39;t mess it up by trying to make him see things the way<br/>
they do.  He may be using connections that the rest of us have lost or never had!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056010863">Throw away that word.<br/>
<br/>
My son reads and still mixes up b and d sometimes when he&#39;s reading out<br/>
loud and when he&#39;s tired.   He doesn&#39;t mix it up when he&#39;s reading<br/>
silently.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan used that trick where you make two fists and press your knuckles<br/>
together and hold up you thumbs.<br/>
Your fists become b and d  -bd-   and it looks like a &quot;bed&quot;. (the shape,<br/>
easy to remember)   You can turn it upside down and make pq.<br/>
<br/>
Your son is really, really young and he might not read well for five more<br/>
years.   He&#39;ll get it.    <br/>
It&#39;s normal.<br/>

ready to. It&#39;s just hard because it frustrates *him* so much. He <br/>
writes all the time, with great invented spelling and letters <br/>
pointing every which way, sometimes completely mirror writing. He <br/>
loves to write and really wants to be able to read what others have <br/>
written. I&#39;ll see him pick up a book and read for a little ways and <br/>
then he&#39;ll give up when he gets to a point he can&#39;t figure out a <br/>
word, and it&#39;s always a &quot;b&quot; or &quot;d&quot; word and I can see how frustrated <br/>
he is about it. I just wanted to be able to help him out. Thanks for <br/>
the tip!<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a good one, thanks. I&#39;m not sure if it will help him as he <br/>
often writes letters (including L) facing the opposite direction, but <br/>
maybe eventually...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m really hoping that will happen with him in time, though I do know <br/>
adults who say they still get left/right and letters confused. Were <br/>
your kids frustrated with this while it was going on? That&#39;s the <br/>
hardest thing for me is that he wants to do it more than he is able <br/>
to, KWIM? But his basic personality is very driven to do things, and <br/>
when he wants to be able to do something, he wants to do it now. I <br/>
have told him that this will most likely get easier for him over <br/>
time, but that&#39;s no consolation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Your son<br/>
&gt; may see lots of things from a different angle than most of us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is definitely really true for him.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s really true. He&#39;s very ambidextrous as well (as is his <br/>
father), but writes left-handed. For a long time, he wrote or drew <br/>
left-handed on the left half of the paper and then switched to his <br/>
right hand for the right half of the paper. Somehow his hand couldn&#39;t <br/>
cross the midline of his body. <br/>
<br/>
His dad was forced in school to try to write right-handed (as a <br/>
result, he can&#39;t really write legibly with either hand, thank god for <br/>
computer keyboards!). I&#39;m just glad he (our son) can learn in his own <br/>
way and his own time, but trying to find ways to help him when he is <br/>
asking for help on this particular thing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

that I really got the hang of it. It didn&#39;t howver, affect my reading cos the word context gave me a clue. It was only in writing. The teacher told me I was backwards and stupid. Maybe now they would say it<br/>
was dyslexia but I don&#39;t think that is true eitehr. I&#39;m still a bd speller though :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747550631">***I just wanted to be able to help him out.***<br/>
<br/>
With Dylan it was the stories.<br/>
We always read great stories to him, The Hobbit,  Lord of the Rings, and<br/>
when he wanted to read on his own he just wanted to read something good. <br/>
  All the early reader books were so lame, he couldn&#39;t believe it.   My<br/>
mom gave him Bob books, which I thought were so cute, and he slammed the<br/>
first one down and said &quot;Nobody talks like this!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He was ruined by all that great literature!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He liked scary stories though and discovered Goosebumps were pretty easy<br/>
to read.   He got tired of those, too, (they&#39;re not written well) and<br/>
moved on to Stephen King.   Stephen King books turned out to be his<br/>
favorite early readers. &lt;g&gt;    Interesting characters, scary plots, easy<br/>
words. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just read to him a lot.   Remind him you&#39;ll read anything he<br/>
starts and can&#39;t finish.   <br/>
Dylan always wanted to read something that was way beyond his ability to<br/>
figure out the words.  It&#39;s just because they appreciate a good story so<br/>
much. <br/>

&gt; hand, but as he still gets his hands mixed up, I&#39;m afraid that wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; terribly useful. His sister, who is 3 years younger, has a solid<br/>
&gt; feeling for left and right, and he&#39;s always struggled with this so I<br/>
&gt; think it goes farther than just reading in his brain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, any thoughts on how to help a kid who is struggling with left-<br/>
&gt; right in reading and wants to get past it?<br/>

<br/>
Maybe remind him to look at a word he DOES recognize and use that as a <br/>
reference point?  <br/>
An alphabet strip as a bookmark (and a left to right guide?), or a ruler <br/>
(numbers left to right)?<br/>
<br/>
Time and experience are my best recommendations.  If he&#39;s in a hurry, draw <br/>
some pictures of beds (let him decorate them maybe?) with bed (bigger, <br/>
fancier, but looking like beds).<br/>
<br/>
Problem with &quot;bed&quot; is you can get the difference between b and d, but it <br/>
doesn&#39;t help a bit with left to right.<br/>
<br/>
Some things just can&#39;t be rushed, though, and he will eventually get it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s a large part of it here as well. We&#39;re in the middle <br/>
of Lord of the Rings right now, and we always read adult non-fiction <br/>
books and have a chapter book we&#39;re in the middle of. It *is* hard to <br/>
go from there to something like the Bob books. I did buy Mackenzie <br/>
some Dorling Kindersly early readers themed on Lego characters, and <br/>
he *loves* those, but he&#39;s still not quite to the point of being able <br/>
to read them himself and that&#39;s one of the things he&#39;s frustrated <br/>
about. I have to say that I don&#39;t think they&#39;re all that &quot;easy&quot;, even <br/>
the &quot;Level 1&quot; book has some three-syllable words. It&#39;s not on the <br/>
same level as, say &quot;Hop On Pop&quot;, but of course he doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
read &quot;Hop on Pop&quot; anymore!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for the ideas. I explained the &quot;bed&quot; one to him <br/>
today and he really liked that. I think it&#39;s the visual that will <br/>
help him, something he can hold in front of him. I thought maybe I&#39;d <br/>
also write out a card he can keep that has &quot;B = b&quot; and &quot;D = d&quot; on it, <br/>
because the capitals are easier to distinguish than the lower case.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-379103743">True dyslexia is a reading disorder, not a matter of confusing 2 or 3 <br/>
letters. All kids get confused and the length of time they stay <br/>
confused varies, too. <br/>
<br/>
One trick dyslexia specialists use is cursive writing. Have the child <br/>
learn what the letter looks like written in cursive, show them <br/>
trouble words written in cursive. If it&#39;s a simple matter of <br/>
memorizing, they will memorize how it is spelled and be able to &quot;see&quot; <br/>
it when it is printed. This may be more helpful to an older reader.<br/>
<br/>
Confusing &#39;p&#39; and &#39;q&#39;...there are few words that a child will see in <br/>
books at age 6 that start with &#39;pu&#39; so teach him that &#39;q&#39; is always <br/>
followed by &#39;u&#39;.  When he&#39;s older, when he begins to notice more &#39;pu&#39; <br/>
words (&quot;hey I thought it was puppy, not quppy!&quot;) you will know that <br/>
he has made the distiction. (Those of you with 6 yr olds reading long <br/>
chapter books -- keep it to yourself).<br/>
<br/>
The &#39;d&#39; and &#39;b&#39; is more problematic. Writing the word &#39;double&#39; in <br/>
lower case letters on a card helped. If my son could refer to the <br/>
card when ever the need arose, he could see the difference. While he <br/>
did confuse the letters for awhile, dyslexia showed up in a different <br/>
way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107939026">John Holt compared b,d,p,q, to the way a child looks at a picture.  The<br/>
child knows a picture of a dog is a dog, whether its tail is going forward,<br/>
back, up or down.  It is normal for think to think this of those letters as<br/>
well.<br/>
