&gt; Would some one like to tell me what an American Christmas is like?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure even in America Christmas is different for everyone, but I&#39;d be<br/>
happy to share what it&#39;s like for me. First of all, as you can tell, it<br/>
starts really early in my house. We begin with subtle things like listening<br/>
to carols, watching videos, and reading books. As the season progresses we<br/>
do things like put up decorations, do some wrapping of gifts and start<br/>
planning meals and visits. By the time Thanksgiving has passed we&#39;re in full<br/>
swing. Trees, wreathes. lights, fires, cocoa and carols every night.<br/>
Christmas Eve is even more special to me than Christmas Day. It&#39;s usually a<br/>
family day spent doing a lot of last minute bustling. Then it&#39;s off to<br/>
church for a candle light service that after 22 years in the same church<br/>
still brings tears to my eays. The kids sing and at the end everyone has a<br/>
lit candle and when those lights go out and Silent Night is sung it knocks<br/>
your socks off. Then it&#39;s home to celebrate with friends and try to get<br/>
little ones to bed (yeah right ). Christmas morning we open gifts. Then<br/>
we&#39;re off to my mom&#39;s for more gifts and breakfast. Then it&#39;s off to my in<br/>
laws for yet more gifts, dinner, and enough dessert to last all year. Then<br/>
we crash!<br/>

Hi Marianne.  I have an e-pal in NZ who tells me they barbeque outdoors<br/>
every Christmas, since it&#39;s the beginning of summer. That&#39;s just tooooo<br/>
different for me.<br/>
We don&#39;t usually have snow, but it&#39;s at least cold here. In our immediate<br/>
family, we put up our tree on St Lucia Day (Dec 13th)   and take it down<br/>
(with much ceremony) on Epiphany (Jan 6th).  That way we feel like we have a<br/>
real beginning and ending to our holiday. Lots of music, baking, gift-giving<br/>
the whole time.<br/>
In my family, Christmas was Dec24th (Scandinavian). My husband&#39;s family<br/>
celebrated only on the 25th. So that really worked out when we got married.<br/>
It&#39;s non-stop Christmas from the afternoon of the 24th till all the kids<br/>
fall asleep on the 25th.<br/>
Our church also celebrates Advent, St Lucia&#39;s Day, Christmas Eve, and<br/>
Epiphany, so there&#39;s lots of celebrations going on.<br/>
What is it like there?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Almost every year the weekend after our Thanksgiving holiday (which is the <br/>
4th Thursday in November), our family heads out to a Christmas tree farm to <br/>
cut tree.  By the following weekend, the tree is decorated, and it&#39;s <br/>
officially the holiday season in our house!  <br/>
<br/>
After my neices and nephews were born, we decided as an extended family that <br/>
adult siblings would no longer exchange presents.  [I can&#39;t tell you how much <br/>
stress that relieved!]  We all give to our nieces and nephews and to our <br/>
parents and children.  We make a lot of our presents.  I usually crochet <br/>
something for my mother-in-law and mother.  We usually buy for the nieces and <br/>
nephews, but each year our kids make gifts to give their relatives.  One year <br/>
we tie-dyed socks for everybody.  Last year we made &quot;hand&quot; soap using a tiny <br/>
Wilton cake pan in the shape of a hand.  I crocheted simple bath puppets to <br/>
put the &quot;hand&quot; soap in.  This year we&#39;re thinking about decorating picture <br/>
frames.  For the last several years, I have also either crocheted or <br/>
cross-stitched an angel ornament for each family&#39;s tree.  <br/>
<br/>
We usually get together with my husband&#39;s family on Christmas Eve.  Then on <br/>
Xmas Day we would open Santa presents, then we&#39;d go to Gary&#39;s aunt&#39;s house <br/>
for lunch with all the family.  Last year for several reasons the aunt <br/>
decided not to have everyone for lunch.  Although it was the end of a <br/>
tradition that my husband expected would last forever, it was really nice not <br/>
to have to leave the house.  <br/>
<br/>
Then sometime around Jan. 1, the tree -- by that time more than a month cut <br/>
-- is beginning to show its age, so we lovingly dismantle it and it goes on <br/>
to its new life as recycled wood.  <br/>
<br/>
The temperature will hit 53 here in Dallas tonight.  It&#39;s beginning to feel a <br/>
lot like Christmas. . . . . . . .<br/>
