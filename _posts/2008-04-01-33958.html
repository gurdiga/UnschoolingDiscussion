<h4>ENSEMBLE S-WAYNFORTH</h4>
<time> 1 Apr 2008, at  6:33am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-311717501">I like to read some non-fiction. It depends on the subject, the style, the author, my interest, the time I have to devote to the book. I don&#39;t read much these days. I don&#39;t have the kind of time I like to give to a book. I have snatches of time, moments and minutes when I&#39;m not needed, not an hour at a go. I sleep in a room filled with bodies, and the ds is a smaller light than the reading lamp. I don&#39;t mind not reading, but when I do pick up a book I need it  to be something that I can get into and out of quickly. Which isn&#39;t usually non-fiction. <br/>
<br/>
I think chasing non-fiction as though it were inherently valuable is a very schooly thing. As is classing all non-fiction in a lump. We have lots of different non-fiction books scattered in our bookcases. Dictionaries and animal identification books and Encyclopedias from the 1940&#39;s that read almost like fiction given the changing face of knowledge (I love when people say that history is a static thing), books on dinosaurs and cats, a few self-help books, biographies, natural history books, text books, statistics, books on innumeracy, biology, anthropology, ethnology, botany, geology, books on tracking animals, cookbooks, and on and on and on. Some of them are things you don&#39;t really read at a go. Some are books that you start with good intentions, and then you flag and find a year later sitting at the bottom of the stack of books next to your bed along with a kleenex. <br/>
<br/>
Why do you want to read non-fiction? Why is that a goal?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that you want to learn more about a specific topic? You don&#39;t *have* to read non-fiction. I love to read, but most non-fiction is too dry for me. Instead, I get information I want from TV shows, documentaries, movies based on real events, historical fiction, museums, zoos and aquariums, discussions, message boards, and a whole host of other sources. If I forced myself to learn in just one specific way, one that I don&#39;t enjoy, I would kill the enthusiasm I had for learning whatever it was I wanted to learn about. Look back at things you enjoyed learning about. Did you learn about them by reading non-fiction, or some other way? <br/>

What that says to me, is that someone forced you somewhere along the<br/>
line to read something. The grouping &quot;nonfiction&quot; is HUGE, and to say<br/>
that a whole subset of books is boring... well, you&#39;d have had to do a<br/>
lot more reading of it to ensure adequate sample size, yeah?<br/>
So it&#39;s probably your definitions. =)<br/>
<br/>
Right now on my bookshelf is a copy of Thich Nhat Hanh&#39;s &quot;Peace is<br/>
Every Step.&quot; Not sure if that&#39;s fiction or non-fiction, since it&#39;s<br/>
mostly him talking about interacting with people, but there are<br/>
illustrative stories thrown in.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a copy of Mary Pipher&#39;s Writing To Change The World, which is<br/>
one of the most inspirational things. Makes me cry, in places, the<br/>
idea that with a pen you can do such good.<br/>
<br/>
Ooh! I&#39;m working through &quot;The Barefoot Navigator&quot;, which talks about<br/>
native navigation methods, and how what the Polynesians use is totally<br/>
different from what the northern Europeans used, etc etc etc, across<br/>
all seafaring cultures, because every ocean&#39;s soul is different<br/>
(fiction? Or non? I dunno, but most mariners believe the sea is alive<br/>
and has personality, no matter how modern they themselves act), so if<br/>
you want to use ethnic navigation, you need to talk to the natives,<br/>
rather than simply copying their methods.<br/>
<br/>
I just landed a copy of &quot;In Their Own Way&quot;, which is about children&#39;s<br/>
learning styles, and fascinating to pick out bits of how pretty much<br/>
everyone I know thinks. It&#39;s a particular hobbyhorse of mine, because<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten grief over the years for &quot;marrying beneath me&quot;, since<br/>
Jason is &quot;only&quot; a contractor. Nevermind that he can build a house from<br/>
the ground up, he&#39;s somehow less than a pencilpusher. Sigh. So having<br/>
my personal opinions on this validated, is spiffy-cool, and nice for<br/>
Jason too, because you know he got slapped with the stupid brush all<br/>
the way through school.<br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s my point? It&#39;s all nonfiction, but it&#39;s all connected to<br/>
something I&#39;m doing, using, being. The thing I&#39;m participating in is<br/>
fascinating, the reading is merely providing my activity more support,<br/>
more color, more texture.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s funny is that when I was making the list above, I almost<br/>
included the Heinlein I have up there.  Because I&#39;m using it for a<br/>
research project for a storywriting contest I promised a friend I&#39;d<br/>
enter. So the Heinlein, clearly, fiction, is the only &quot;work&quot; reading<br/>
I&#39;m doing right now! (Other than the stuff for my day job, where I&#39;m<br/>
an editor). It&#39;s not really inspiring me much, though, so reading it<br/>
is far more like effort than I&#39;m happy with, and I keep blowing it<br/>
off.<br/>
<br/>
As an editor, I find the line between fiction and nonfiction to be<br/>
terribly blurry. Visioneers write about things that become reality<br/>
later. Early Asimov, William Gibson, oh heck, I make jokes about the<br/>
Matrix all the time (I know, I just hopped from books to film, it&#39;s<br/>
the thought that counts), because they apply to the world I&#39;m in now,<br/>
but they didn&#39;t when they were created. So what does that make them?<br/>
At work, engineers write about technologies that don&#39;t exist yet, but<br/>
will soon. So right now it&#39;s fiction. In five years, it&#39;ll be some<br/>
ubiquitous thing we&#39;ve all seen one of. That&#39;s the coolest reading I<br/>
do. Fiction? Maybe. Maybe the line between fiction and non-fiction is<br/>
simply funding.<br/>
<br/>
How blurry is that? Did I help? Or did I make it worse?<br/>
<br/>

Why are you trying to read something you don&#39;t like that&#39;s giving you  <br/>
trouble?<br/>
What kinds of things are you trying to read?  People here might have  <br/>
lots of good ideas.  Please tell us a little more.<br/>
<br/>
Some information can be obtained by listening to mp3/CD audio books.<br/>
Some can be had by video (online how-to&#39;s at YouTube and other places).<br/>
<br/>
What kind of non fiction?<br/>
<br/>
Why are you needing to process some specific information?<br/>
<br/>
Is this by any chance you wanting to do it because you want your kids  <br/>
to do it?<br/>
<br/>

Hey!  We were talking about this just a couple of weeks ago, about a  <br/>
kind of map they had that was like a net with knots and such, showing  <br/>
currents or something.  I&#39;ll find that book and I hope it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
cost a fortune.  My husband knows a lot about stars and directions.<br/>
<br/>
Humor is often non-fiction.  I&#39;m thinking Eddie Izzard and George  <br/>
Carlin.   Commentary.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are such interesting writers that I&#39;m swept away.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t read many Stephen King novels, because I don&#39;t like the  <br/>
scariness, but he has a column in Entertainment Weekly every three  <br/>
weeks or so, and that&#39;s not fiction.<br/>
<br/>
This list is non-fiction.  These are non-fiction:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080525830">On my MySpace profile I wrote this (a year ago?):<br/>
<br/>
I like non-fiction, reference stuff. It doesn&#39;t seem fun to most  <br/>
people, but I love things like the Oxford English Dictionary, The  <br/>
Voice of the Middle Ages in Letters, Eyewitness to History, and  <br/>
Brewer&#39;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a video of the books in our library here, and it&#39;s mostly non- <br/>
fiction, but GOOD STUFF!  Fun stuff.  Useful stuff.<br/>

For my own personally reading though I don&#39;t like fiction. I love to read auto and biographies. I guess I&#39;m very nosey and like to know what other people are doing in their lives;). Parenting, gardening, property and whatever other topics are relevant to me at the time are the books I mostly read (apart from the bios etc).<br/>
<br/>
The last fictional book I read was the Da Vinci Code when it first came out (a fair while ago now!). I liked it  but I&#39;m not drawn to choosing fiction when left to do the choosing for myself. It has to be really strongly recommended for me to actually read fiction.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235141952">My favorite is historical fiction--the kind where the author has really researched the <br/>
subject and has fleshed out the characters based on what is actually known about them, <br/>
and then has them acting out history--can&#39;t get enough of that!  The problem is finding <br/>
really well researched stuff, and then also knowing where the author took liberties and so <br/>
forth.  I&#39;ve always thought that the author should include an essay at the back of the book <br/>
that details some of this stuff out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy to let someone else go through all the source documents and tell me a good <br/>
story!<br/>

What and why are you trying to read?<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What? My post applies to just about everything that is non fiction that I<br/>
try to read. Even if I am interested in the topic. When I first started<br/>
homeschooling I would pick up those books and not read them. I have tried to<br/>
read several John Holt books. Financial books (getting your finances in<br/>
order), but maybe that is a bad example. Photography books (which I *love*).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
How blurry is that? Did I help? Or did I make it worse?<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, I think that make some sense and it might help as my brain digests it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
Why are you needing to process some specific information?<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
To get better at things. Like taking pictures and working in photoshop. But<br/>
have you seen the manuals to Photoshop? I was looking in the library today<br/>
and I picked a couple, but they were the thinnest books on the shelf.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to actually take a photography class and a photoshop class at the<br/>
local community college, but I have to have the camera for the photography<br/>
class (duh!) and all I have is a digital or I have to take Art classes where<br/>
I am actually drawing things and that really isn&#39;t my thing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
Humor is often non-fiction. I&#39;m thinking Eddie Izzard and George<br/>
Carlin. Commentary.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I can listen to those things (but often don&#39;t think they are funny even<br/>
though I *do* relate to the comedian, much to the disappointment of DH) and<br/>
watch them, but definitely *not* read them<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
Is it possible what was meant was &quot;textbooks&quot;?<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and no. I can read *some* of your website and Joyce&#39;s. I have to read<br/>
it in bits. Many times I have to print it out and read it not at the<br/>
computer.<br/>
I *love* Stephen King, though, lol!<br/>
<br/>
Most of all, thank you, everyone for the different thoughts and discussion<br/>
on the topic. It has changed my perspective a little and that is probably<br/>
mostly what I needed. Thanks for the historical fiction recommendations too.<br/>
I have thought about picking up some of those over the past year or so, but<br/>
I keep going back to Harry Potter (currently reading DH for the 4th time!)<br/>
