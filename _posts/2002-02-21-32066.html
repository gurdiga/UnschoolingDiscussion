<br/>
Many women are afraid of their first mammogram, but there is no need to<br/>
worry. By taking a few minutes each day for a week preceding the exam and<br/>
doing the<br/>
following exercises, you will be totally prepared for the test and best of<br/>
all, you can do these simple exercises right in  your home.<br/>
<br/>
EXERCISE ONE:<br/>
Open your refrigerator door and insert one breast in door. Shut as hard as<br/>
possible and lean on the door for good measure. Hold that position for five<br/>
seconds.  Repeat again in case the first time wasn&#39;t effective enough.<br/>
<br/>
EXERCISE TWO:<br/>
Visit your garage at 3AM when the temperature of the cement floor is just<br/>
perfect. Take off all your clothes and lie comfortably on the floor with one<br/>
breast<br/>
wedged under the rear tire of the car. Ask a friend to slowly back the car<br/>
up until your breast is sufficiently flattened and chilled.  Turn over and<br/>
repeat with the other breast.<br/>
<br/>
EXERCISE THREE:<br/>
Freeze two metal bookends over night. Strip to the waist. Invite a  stranger<br/>
into the room. Press the bookends against one of your breasts.   Smash the<br/>
bookends together as hard as you can. Set up an appointment  with the<br/>
stranger to meet next year and do it again.<br/>
<br/>
YOU ARE NOW TOTALLY PREPARED!<br/>
<br/>
AND, just a thought for all the women out there.........<br/>
MENtal illness, MENstrual cramps, MENtal breakdown, MENopause..<br/>
Ever notice how all of women&#39;s problems start with men?....and when we have<br/>
real trouble, it&#39;s HYSterectomy!!!<br/>
<br/>
Send this to all the women you know and brighten their day!!!<br/>
AND, don&#39;t  forget to have a mammogram</div>

That&#39;s just what it feels like.  And I have to do it every year (history of<br/>
breast cancer in the family).  There are times I think I&#39;d rather just have<br/>
a double mastectomy and get it over with!<br/>
<br/>
You forgot to mention - if you wiggle just a little (I know it&#39;s hard to do,<br/>
but it IS possible) - you get to do the whole thing over again!<br/>
<br/>
psam  &quot;who is dreading next week&#39;s visit to the mammography clinic, and<br/>
needed this comic relief&quot;<br/>
