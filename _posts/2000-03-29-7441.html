<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667384636">Just a quick question--  Has anyone been asked to homeschool other people&#39;s <br/>
children?  I have been asked, and I declined.  I tried to explain how what I <br/>
&quot;do&quot; is not duplicating what is found in school, and how it is more of a <br/>
lifestyle for our family.  Anyway, I  have my hands full with my own right <br/>
now!  But, I was just wondering if this has happened to others, and how you <br/>
handled it.                                                                     <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-367665659">I know of a homeschooling co-op that is great. Five families send their kids<br/>
to five homes, a different one each day of the week. It is child led, and<br/>
parent facilitated for the most part. Some kids stay home some days of the<br/>
week. I like the model for parents who want to/have to work. I am wondering<br/>
whether I want to create the same thing in my neighborhood. Yet in my work<br/>
with having a playgroup, with a couple kids, I realize that I can&#39;t read a<br/>
book as long as I could with my child only. I have the concern that<br/>
teaching/learnoning would be more superficial the more kids there. It does<br/>
seem freer than regular school, and these kids live in a neighborhood of<br/>
Boston, so public schools are not so great. The kids vary in age from4-8,<br/>
and this is the second year they have done hs together. They know how to<br/>
write (little ones)and read(older kids) with very little instruction in that<br/>
area.<br/>
