Different ways to think about it I guess... <br/>

My kids have been to school, and it was damaging for each of them in many <br/>
different ways. I use the term &quot;unschooling&quot; with pride and not a little bit <br/>
of anger at the system. I wonder if, as my anger diminishes (will it?), the <br/>
term &quot;unschooling&quot; will have a different meaning for me?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374342573">I have come to the point where I don&#39;t use the term unschooling unless talking to other unschoolers.  Too many of the school-at-homers that I know (and those are the only homeschoolers I have regular contact with) seem to think that unschooling = unparenting and I just don&#39;t have the time/energy to debate or discuss that issue.  Also, since my kids have never been to &quot;school,&quot; maybe it isn&#39;t the best term for us anyhow.  I tend to tell people we are relaxed or eclectic homeschoolers, learning from life as we go.<br/>
