<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753348905">I think college classes are different in many respects to public school classes. The major difference being if  you really don&#39;t want to attend you don&#39;t have to. Now, of course there are some classes that may be boring but required for a certain major - but again you still have a choice - I can either drop out or just get through it to move on to the more interesting things. I really thought high school a waste of time for me - but I am still taking college classes and loving them. I have had ones that I didn&#39;t like as much as others, but I figured I would get out of it what I put in. The key is choice and desire. <br/>
<br/>
I am enjoying your posts on Kirby. I think its good to see that truly whatever it is that our kids want to do - they can do it!  <br/>
