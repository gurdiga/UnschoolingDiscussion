<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664323505">Hi again<br/>
I certainly am not trying to imply that some of you are liers! Just that we<br/>
sometimes forget the journey we made to get to where we are! I was made<br/>
freshly aware of this recently, talking to a good friend who is thinking of<br/>
homeschooling...<br/>
Thanks for all your patient responses to my many questions - I am really<br/>
excited because they confirm what I was thinking anyway; I&#39;m on the right<br/>
track YAHOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.<br/>
Regards<br/>
Cathy<br/>
