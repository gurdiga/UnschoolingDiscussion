then that is your choice.  When you stop choosing to be bored, you will no <br/>

Thats pretty funny about your son&#39;s reading!! Also I&#39;m interested about your <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; list, it seems I hear those yucky words often. How is that <br/>
possible? I have no idea, as she has me exausted most of the time. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>

LOL! I could slap my self , I just had a V-8 moment!! I didn&#39;t scroll down <br/>
from your ending and completely missed the nice list you took time to put <br/>
there. Sorry. Disregard that last e-mail.  But I did enjoy your son&#39;s story.<br/>
