<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410472148">APOLOGY to tzuziet, my bad, not new to list<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
You were on the list of people who were off and back on, and NOT new to the <br/>
list last week..<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, that was my error, not yours.<br/>
<br/>
So without regard to  how long you were on the list, please don&#39;t address a <br/>
post to one particular person nor tell them what they were supposing or <br/>
assuming if you can possibly help it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra</div>
