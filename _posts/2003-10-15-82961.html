<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;This is how to test Lipstick for &quot;Lead&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Lead is a chemical which causes cancer. Recently a<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;brand called, &quot;Red Earth&quot; decreased their prices<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;dramatically, why? It contained lead.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;The Brands which contain Lead are:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;1. Christian Dior<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;2. LANCOME<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;3. CLINIQUE<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;4. Y.S.L<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;5. ESTEE LAUDER<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;6. SHISEIDO<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;7. RED EARTH (Lip Gloss)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;8. CHANEL (Lip Conditioner)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;9. Market America-Motives lipstick<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;The higher the lead content, the greater the chance of causing Cancer.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;After doing a test on lipsticks, it was found that the Y.S.L.lipstick<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;contained the most amount of lead. Watch out for those lipsticks which<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;are supposed to stay longer. If your Lipstick stays longer, it is<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;because of the higher content of lead.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Here is the test you can do yourself:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;1. Put some lipstick on your hand,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;2. Use a Gold ring to scratch on the lipstick.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;3. If the lipstick colour changes to black then you<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;know the lipstick contains lead.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Please send this information to all your girls..........<br/>

Mr. Rogers was NOT a sniper, and he was NOT a Navy SEAL (for example, <br/>
something else I received lately from a homeschooling mom).<br/>
<br/>
There are websites that have the truth about these irritating chain-letter <br/>
e-mail rumors.   Go to GOOGLE and type in some main words and check it out, or <br/>
if you don&#39;t want to bother to do that, just don&#39;t send the thing on to <br/>
anybody.  I&#39;m always especially disappointed when nonsense is passed on by <br/>
homeschooling parents, because it makes me wonder how careful they&#39;re being about what <br/>
they tell their kids.<br/>
<br/>
Looking for conspiracies and dangers is fun for some people, but it&#39;s not the <br/>
purpose of this list unless the conspiracies and dangers directly affect <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
