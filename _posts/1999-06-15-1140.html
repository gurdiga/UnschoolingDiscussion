<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974232258">Yes a newie to your listserve. I&#39;m Gregg Thorn - fther of 4 kids under 8,<br/>
and husband of the lovely Suzie - and just turned 48 on the 8th. that&#39;s<br/>
rigth a late bloomer or late starter. I&#39;m also the editor for the &quot;learning<br/>
matters&quot; - the official newsletter fot he Home-based Learning Network here<br/>
in perth, Australia.<br/>
And I&#39;m ionterested in discussing topics with you all -you  unseen<br/>
homeschoolers out there.<br/>
Usually in our mag/newsletter we ask our subscribers to respond in &#39;Just a<br/>
few lines...&#39; to an advertised editorial topic - so maybe I can start the<br/>
ball rolling here from this side of the world with othe lastest topical<br/>
question:<br/>
&#39;If school system educators were really interested in nurturting the<br/>
learning potential of our children so they were best equipped to face the<br/>
world of adult life and adult work they would............&#39;<br/>
or another way of putting might be...&quot;What changes restructuring would it<br/>
take in your local educational system before you would even consider sending<br/>
your kids to their school?&quot;<br/>
No offense meant here - just looking for input and also looking for other<br/>
input on the different strategies, different fronts on which a group could<br/>
neutralise the effects of a control-freak bureaucracy that wants to<br/>
eliminate home schooling in the name of civilised custodial care.<br/>
see ya<br/>
<br/>
be kind - this my first time in your neck of the woods<br/>
