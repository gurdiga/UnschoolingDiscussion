    My name is Patricia Reszetylo, and I live with my husband and our 6-mo son in northern Minnesota.  I joined this list last night.  I had mentioned to a friend that I was planning on homeschooling and he suggested I look into unschooling.. so here I am.<br/>
<br/>
    I guess we are already &quot;unschooling&quot; baby E., given the thread on sex that I read this morning.  Both hubby and I think that our culture is way too repressive when it comes to sex, and since we aren&#39;t embarrassed about our functioning, and baby finds it interesting, we don&#39;t necessarily reserve it for times that he is asleep or at Gramma&#39;s.  In many (other) cultures, parents do directly teach their children about sex, and watching is the first step.<br/>
<br/>
    I haven&#39;t told my friends, because they would think I am perverted.  <br/>
<br/>
    Anyway, I am very interested in the &quot;unschooling&quot; idea, it seems to fit in with MY mindset, so I will be reading and watching and learning how to allow my little guy to learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-344593741">Hi Chris! I can&#39;t answer all of your questions but here goes.....<br/>
  What is your typical day is like? <br/>
  ** Well, we usually get up and fix breakfast then clean the kitchen. Then Brett (my 7yos) usually finds something to do on his own - crafts, reading, outside play, games... whatever he&#39;s in the mood for. He&#39;s happy alone til lunchtime. Tyler (my 5yos) likes to watch tv and play with the baby after breakfast. Then we all fix lunch (often different meals for everyone). After lunch, Brett usually wants to play on the computer or watch tv, sometimes he&#39;ll head on outside to play. Tyler usually heads to his room to play with his toys and games. DH comes home around 5 or 6, and they come back to the living room when he gets home, and we all do something together for an hour or so, then we all cook supper together. After supper, we set the timer for 15 minutes and each start in our own rooms and clean! After our rooms are straight, we do the bathrooms and living room. DH cleans the kitchen 2 evenings a week, and I do it the rest of the time, after everyone&#39;s in bed for the night. After our cleaning time, we usually read or play games til bedtime. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  If you use any curriculum, what do you use?<br/>
<br/>
  ** Brett requested a curriculum last year, so I bought him the ACE one for first grade. It is set up so that he can do it completely on his own, and he had a lot of fun with it. He was done in about 3 mths, and is just now asking me for more &quot;homework&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
  Are there groups or co-ops in the Twin City area for unschoolers?<br/>
  How do unschoolers score on the mandatory standardized tests?<br/>
<br/>
  ** My children have never had a test, and they will never take one unless it is their choice. <br/>
  HTH!<br/>

This is a really particular-to-your state question.  <br/>
<br/>
Most unschoolers don&#39;t take tests.  When you find unschoolers in Minnesota <br/>
(if those are the twin cities you&#39;re talking about) they&#39;ll know more.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something to consider about tests, though:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tests">http://sandradodd.com/tests</a><br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers don&#39;t use a curriculum.  If you&#39;re faced with having to try to <br/>
show one, here is something  Carol Narigon used, in Ohio:<br/>

Hi, Chris!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t use any curriculum, BUT I have an intense book-buying habit that<br/>
sometimes causes me to acquire very cheap textbooks.<br/>
<br/>
When I have too many books of all sorts, I take some to park day and<br/>
give them away.  Nobody will actually take the textbooks, and most of<br/>
the members of my support group aren&#39;t unschoolers, they are eclectic<br/>
and do use curriculum.  That&#39;s my 2 cents worth of data.<br/>
<br/>
The books recommended in the book The Well Trained Mind are very popular<br/>
in my group this year.  However, I haven&#39;t bought and used them.<br/>
<br/>
But tell me your kids ages and interests and I can think of some books<br/>
that they might like that you can get from the library.<br/>
<br/>
