<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928865320">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering. I&#39;ve seen the term &quot;cover school&quot; mentioned in <br/>
passing twice in the past week. I can&#39;t remember where, or I&#39;d ask <br/>
the source.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone tell me what a &quot;cover school&quot; is? Just curious ...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Shelly</div>

 </span></blockquote>Well I&#39;m sure other&#39;s replies will be better since we don&#39;t have them where<br/>
I live, but in some states one of the homeschooling options is to operate<br/>
under a &quot;cover school&quot;. It&#39;s sort of like a private school that you don&#39;t<br/>
have to attend. The cover school abides by whatever regulations there are<br/>
for private schools (or cover schools) in that state and offers its services<br/>
to the homeschooling parents. Some offer (or require) oversight. Some offer<br/>
services. Some just offer their name for the state forms.<br/>
