&gt; <br/>
&gt; Until they can see all kinds of moving, flowing parts, it won&#39;t be something <br/>
&gt; they can really think about and learn about.  As long as they&#39;re asking brick <br/>
&gt; questions about what it is and what it isn&#39;t, and won&#39;t it break a window and <br/>
&gt; what will we do with the brick when the child is 18, <br/>
&gt; there&#39;s not much <br/>
