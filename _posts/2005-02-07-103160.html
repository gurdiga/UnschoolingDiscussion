<div id="ygrps-yiv-293453110">&lt;&lt; I just  had a thought of starting a homeschooling program to where we<br/>
could bring  in a student from the country we&#39;re learning about that<br/>
year and really get  submerged in to the language.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But you don&#39;t get submerged in another language by having one speaker visit <br/>
you in an English speaking place.   <br/>
<br/>
If you want to really learn about France by submersion, you have to pretty <br/>
much go to France.  Bringing one French-speaking student to your house doesn&#39;t <br/>
do it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve visited other places but no one I visited learned all about New Mexico, <br/>
nor all about the U.S.<br/>
