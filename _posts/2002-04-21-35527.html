Fresh Egg Tests<br/>
Unless your hens are caged, you will occasionally find an egg or a cache of<br/>
eggs whose age may be in question. Here are four methods you can use to<br/>
estimate an egg&#39;s age.<br/>
<br/>
1. Air-cell size increases as an egg ages. A freshly laid egg has no air<br/>
cell. As the egg cools, its contents shrink, forming a cell or pocket at the<br/>
large end of the egg. As moisture evaporates from the egg, its contents<br/>
continue to shrink and the air cell grows. Candling an egg to measure the<br/>
air cell will give you an idea of the egg&#39;s age. The cell of a freshly laid,<br/>
cool egg will be no more than 1/8-inch deep.<br/>
<br/>
2. Floating an egg in plain water lets you gauge its air-cell size without<br/>
candling. A fresh egg will settle to the bottom of the container and rest<br/>
horizontally. The larger air cell of a 1-week-old egg will cause the big end<br/>
of the egg to rise slightly from the container bottom. An egg that&#39;s 2 to 3<br/>
weeks old will settle to the bottom of the container vertically, big end<br/>
upward.<br/>
<br/>
(Someone else adds: if the egg floats on the surface, it it should be<br/>
discarded.)<br/>
<br/>
3. Smell is the quickest way to detect the age of a very old egg. A rotting<br/>
egg emits foul-smelling hydrogen sulfide, otherwise known as rotten-egg gas.<br/>
<br/>
4. Breaking an egg and examining its contents is another way to estimate the<br/>
egg&#39;s age. A fresh egg has cloudy, firm albumen that holds the yolk up high;<br/>
a stale egg has clear, watery albumen that spreads out thinly around the<br/>
yolk. The older the egg is, the greater the likelihood that its yolk will<br/>
break. However, this test isn&#39;t foolproof, as even the freshest egg<br/>
occasionally has a watery white or an easily broken yolk.</div>
