<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625313432">Hi Unschooling friends. I noticed from those that respond to this list that<br/>
most of you seem to have young children. My oldest, Avi is almost 12 and he<br/>
is the one like many of your children - that is very active and fits all 14<br/>
on the ADD list. I also have three other younger kids down to age 3. There<br/>
is a clear difference between my oldest and the others. It was more subtle<br/>
when they were younger but as they all grow I can tell the differences. From<br/>
the time he was born until he was around 9, Avi was constantly on the go. He<br/>
slept very little compared to other babies and children. He demanded my<br/>
attention non-stop. He was always getting into things due to his high level<br/>
of curiosity and impulsiveness. He also got hurt a lot because he would act<br/>
first and think second. Now those characteristics are still basically a part<br/>
of him but he has ways of calming himself. He reads first thing in the<br/>
morning and  right before he goes to sleep. He also reads during the day<br/>
when he wants to calm down. In between he is active. He often involves<br/>
himself in building projects with all sorts of materials. At the moment he<br/>
is building a fort in our yard using saws, hammers, measuring tools, etc. He<br/>
does a lot of physical play with his brothers and he bike rides. In short he<br/>
is growing up to be a wonderful person who now is able to direct his energy<br/>
to create new things. He is also able to amuse himself and take care of his<br/>
basic needs. I can&#39;t say on the basis of one child that this is the<br/>
direction all ADD children head but there is hope down the road for all of<br/>
you. My husband also exhibited those behaviors as a child and now also has<br/>
short attention span and is easily distracted but as an adult he is very<br/>
successful professional and is a wonderful father and husband and is highly<br/>
creative like our son Avi so I think mothering these type of children is<br/>
very very hard when they are young but the rewards later are pay off.</div>
