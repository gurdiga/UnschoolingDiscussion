<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478423690">Hi !<br/>
 I haven&#39;t posted in a very long time but I know I could get good suggestions <br/>
from all of you.<br/>
<br/>
  We are at the point in our new house that my two youngest ( ds 91/2, dd <br/>
almost 8) can have their own rooms. They are small rooms ...more like cozy nests <br/>
&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
 For the last year it has been &quot;musical rooms&quot; where sometimes they would be <br/>
in the same room, sometimes dd would be in with us. The mattress has been <br/>
moved everywhere and quite often!<br/>
<br/>
 I KNOW once they have separate rooms though they will still want to sleep in <br/>
the SAME room at night. <br/>
<br/>
 This is what I am struggling with... would it be better to have a small <br/>
shared bedroom and then a small den/playroom for them...OR each have their own <br/>
room and then get an inflatable mattress or cot so they CAN take turns sleeping <br/>
together if they choose ?<br/>
<br/>
 Even with separate rooms I would let them sleep together but I want them <br/>
sleeping on something comfortable not a hard wooden floor! Plus there will come a <br/>
time when they will not want to be together as much!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 BUT...they all have their own &quot;stuff&quot; that they want out too , which alot is <br/>
still in boxes and which are very different since they are boy and girl and <br/>
have different personalities) . The rooms are small and they are together 24/7 <br/>
so on the other hand it seems better that they have their OWN space (everyone <br/>
should have a space they call their own)..but then they are little for so long <br/>
and it&#39;s cool to share too.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just need comments and any experiences you would share with me!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-179544553">I would give them each their own space with room for 2 kids to sleep<br/>
in each. A double bed/bunk beds/good inflatable mattresses/trundle<br/>
beds. I am sure they might want to have sleep overs at one point and<br/>
this way you can accommodate that - plus they can choose where to<br/>
sleep each night with out giving up a private space of their own.<br/>
<br/>
We co-sleep with our kids in our room, but each have their own room<br/>
with a regular bed. That way they can relax in their if they want, an<br/>
adult could sleep in there if they needed to and we have room for<br/>
company. It is all about choices and flexibility for us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682351550">I haven&#39;t been posting for a long while but i thought I would tell you<br/>
what has happened so far in our house.  <br/>
<br/>
The two middle children Dd9 and Ds6 were each given their own bedrooms<br/>
when we moved into our new house.  They had previously shared a room <br/>
Dd9 on top bunk Ds6 on bottom.  Dd9 was given the bunk bed in the new<br/>
house as we assumed that Dd4 would want to start sleeping in her own<br/>
bed soon (year and a half latter she&#39;s still in ours).  <br/>
<br/>
It stayed that way for six moths, each in thier own bed.  Then they<br/>
started the mucical bed thing with everyone,  somtimes our bed<br/>
sometimes Big brothers somtimes eachothers.  this lasted for two to<br/>
three months.  Then Dd9 and Ds6 decided to share her top bunk and have<br/>
been there ever since (mostly anyway).  Ds6&#39;s room stayed basicly<br/>
vacant except to change clothes.  <br/>
<br/>
After a few months and some discussion his room is now the TV room. <br/>
His bed is set up with lots of pillows -like a day bed- so we can be<br/>
cozy, but he still has a place to sleep if he chooses to sleep alone.<br/>
 If and when he wants his room to himself we can just move his dresser<br/>
back in and put the TV back down stairs.  No big deal less waste of<br/>
space.  The larger then neccesary area we priviously had the TV in<br/>
down stairs has most of their toys it right now and I&#39;m guessing that<br/>
by the time he wants to sleep in his own room there will be less space<br/>
needed for toys anyway.  The bedrooms aren&#39;t large either aprox. 9feet<br/>
by 10 feet.<br/>
<br/>
They both have some different areas for different toys throughout the<br/>
house.  Dd is not the most organised child so Ds keeps his toys he<br/>
wants organised -like bionicles- in his big brothers room.  The rest<br/>
just end up in one of the many storgage container in the play area in<br/>
the basement.<br/>
<br/>
My sugestion.  Do some brainstorming with them.  What kinds of ideas<br/>
do they have?  Does one of them really want to decorate or have a<br/>
theamed room?  Do they have similar sleep habits?  One of the reasons<br/>
sharing separate rooms didn&#39;t work so well for our two was that one<br/>
was a late riser the other get&#39;s up between six and seven every day. <br/>
He couldn&#39;t play quietly with his toys while the rest of the house<br/>
slept with out waking her.  His brother gets up early too so having<br/>
his quiet play toys in his room wasnt as disruptive.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if it&#39;s helpfull.  It is what has worked for us.  So Far.<br/>
Good Luck Teresa<br/>
