<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347119792">I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a good idea to be aware of the specific<br/>
preferences of a school you are interested in for your<br/>
son.  In general, though, colleges and universities<br/>
I&#39;ve heard of over the years are accepting things like<br/>
ACT, SAT, letters from the parent and student<br/>
explaining the homeschool experience, and are not<br/>
requiring records such as a grade point average.  My<br/>
first daughter took her GED at 18, then her ACT, then<br/>
placement tests at the local community college (which<br/>
often are required of a student from any background). <br/>
We submitted her FAFSA, too.  Her tuition was paid for<br/>
and she worked part-time to help with other expenses. <br/>
The GED teacher at our local high school gave her the<br/>
pre-tests and information of the ACT, etc..  My<br/>
daughter was encouraged to take the GED cold, without<br/>
any classes, and she passed just fine the first time,<br/>
even though she&#39;d never been in a classroom setting or<br/>
had any kind of testing.  She had no problem with the<br/>
ACT, either, and enjoyed attending college classes. <br/>
She preferred to work full-time after two years,<br/>
instead of transferring to the university.  <br/>

What did your daughter decide to do (work wise)? Did anything in her previous unschooling life have anything to do with that career? <br/>
I&#39;m glad she&#39;s doing so well. I always want to know more about these unschooled &#39;graduates&#39; and what they are doing now!<br/>
