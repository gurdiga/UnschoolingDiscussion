<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556491582">Danielle&#39;s post reminded me of something called the &quot;Six Thinking <br/>
Hats.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
       This is meant to help people be aware of different ways to consider an <br/>
idea or problem, and that we can switch between different thinking modes just <br/>
like changing hats, instead of having to stick with just one all the time, or <br/>
repeatedly clashing with someone wearing a different color:<br/>
<br/>
White hat -- neutral and objective, concerned with facts & figures<br/>
Red hat -- the emotional view<br/>
Black hat -- careful & cautious, the devil&#39;s advocate<br/>
Yellow hat -- sunny & positive<br/>
Green hat -- associated with fertile growth, creativity & new ideas<br/>
Blue hat -- cool, the color of the sky, above everything else, the organizing <br/>
hat.<br/>
<br/>
       Quote from the international consultant who developed this (don&#39;t <br/>
trust him unless it makes sense for you personally, of course! &lt;g&gt;) :<br/>
       &quot;The six thinking hats allow us to conduct our thinking as a conductor <br/>
might lead an orchestra. . .with the Six Hats method, the emphasis in on <br/>
&#39;what can be&#39; rather than just on &#39;what is,&#39; and on how we design a way forward -- <br/>
not on who is right and who is wrong.&#39; &quot; <br/>

<br/>
       We&#39;ve just naturally used all these different types of thinking and <br/>
interacting in our unschooling, much as danielle described. But for some people, <br/>
the hats construct might help open up some new thinking. And maybe it might <br/>
be useful with in-laws or husbands who needing you to lay out some sanctioned <br/>
&quot;method&quot; behind what looks like chaos to them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Shouldn&#39;t there be a rakish purple hat of mirth and satire?  It&#39;s too <br/>
cold for me to be running around hatless.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

and wrote me this week that he&#39;d lost his sense of humor. I wrote back that I <br/>
found everything funny these days and asked whether he thought that was a sign <br/>
of perspective, or hysteria. <br/>
       His answer made me suspect that he really HAS lost his sense of humor! <br/>
