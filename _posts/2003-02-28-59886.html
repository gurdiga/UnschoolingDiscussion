Thanks for letting us know Kirby!!  I was thinking about her yesterday and <br/>
had a really good feeling, like she was going to have a great trip. It&#39;s nice <br/>
to know it wasn&#39;t just wishful thinking. :)<br/>

growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
