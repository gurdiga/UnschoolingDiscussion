<div id="ygrps-yiv-970532429">&lt;&lt;It seems to me that art is something that should be explored not forced.  I <br/>
too would dislike anything that someone told me I had to do.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told my kids they have to watch TV. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve forbidden them to go to their rooms and made them watch just whatever&#39;s <br/>
on TV until the end of a half hour sometimes if they were particularly out of <br/>
hand or too angry for human company.  Not lately, because they&#39;re all for <br/>
some unknown reason being sweet and reasonable all at the same time.   Kirby <br/>
was in an adolescent funk, but for the past two weeks he can touch his sister <br/>
nicely and say polite things to my friends and all KINDS of weird stuff. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
It will probably pass as another wave of body-changing hormones wash through, <br/>
but it&#39;s a nice break.<br/>
