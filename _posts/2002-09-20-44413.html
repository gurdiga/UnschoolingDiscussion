<div id="ygrps-yiv-985254705">Thanks all.  Many good ideas.  I just have such resistance to being taught.  <br/>
It feels like it would be hard to find a teacher who wouldn&#39;t teach!  Right <br/>
now what I do when I have time is choose songs I like or want to know and <br/>
play the right hand because I can&#39;t read bass clef.  (Actually the whole <br/>
notion of reading two lines of music in different clefs at the same time <br/>
totally overwhelms me!)  I&#39;ve been feeling like I&#39;m not following school <br/>
rules by doing this, but I&#39;ve noticed I&#39;m getting better at it.<br/>
<br/>
Re whether someone is self taught if they take lessons, etc.:  I think this <br/>
is a mostly semantic distinction that would only be taken seriously by this <br/>
list!  But it&#39;s a distinction that matters to me as a point of pride.  I <br/>
think if you follow lessons,from a teacher or a book, it&#39;s not self teaching. <br/>
 I think if you use a book as reference or a human being as a sort of <br/>
consultant, that&#39;s different (and probably very hard to do without).  I think <br/>
if somebody or something is telling you what to do, how well you did it, and <br/>
when you&#39;re ready to go on to the next step, you aren&#39;t self taught.<br/>
<br/>
Kelli - thanks for the summary of the essay.  I love the point about thinking <br/>
about playing, not practicing.  Yesterday, I sat down at the piano and asked <br/>
Sam to join me and said, &quot;Let&#39;s see if you can find two notes and I can find <br/>
two notes that sound good together when we play them.&quot;  (I did this mostly to <br/>
distract him enough so he wouldn&#39;t say stop playing, which is what both my <br/>
kids do!  With recorded music too.  I occasionally get away with singing.)  <br/>
We banged around for awhile and then he picked up some pencils and used them <br/>
laying down horizontally to press many keys down at once and then got us all <br/>
to try his new piano playing invention, because for Sam, inventing things is <br/>
way more important than music!  John Cage would be proud.  (I&#39;m proud.)<br/>
<br/>
Brenda, thanks for your list.  What wind instrument?  This week, it&#39;s <br/>
ocarina.  (That counts doesn&#39;t it?)  I found someone who sells songbooks with <br/>
fingering charted.  The bit I tried seemed like a great shortcut to making <br/>
music.  Last spring I went out and got recorders for the whole family and a <br/>
couple of lesson books, but was too rebellious to follow the lessons, so the <br/>
recorders are in the piano bench.  I&#39;m open to sugestions on that instrument. <br/>
 Sandra?<br/>
<br/>
I just realized that what&#39;s been inspiring me about playing music is the <br/>
homeschoolers&#39; round singing group I&#39;m in.  We meet monthly at a park.  The <br/>
kids almost always just play while we moms sing.  The person who started the <br/>
group provides most of the music and &quot;teaches&quot; us most of the songs but the <br/>
rest of us have provided a fair share.  The kids pick up the songs from about <br/>
30 feet away while they&#39;re playing.  That&#39;s self taught!  But I feel like I&#39;m <br/>
unschooling music with this group.  I can sight read better than two years <br/>
ago, my voice is stronger.  Rounds don&#39;t overwhelm me anymore - I can listen <br/>
and sing at the same time.  And I&#39;ll sing anybody our favorite songs (wish <br/>
you could hear me and I know there&#39;s some way to put this on the web but I <br/>
don&#39;t wanna!)<br/>
<br/>
Oh the dishes, the dirty dishes, when will we ever be through with all the <br/>

Oh, it&#39;s wash and dry and it&#39;s moan and cry every single day the whole year <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836091525">Pam, I loved reading your post, it sounds like life around my house.  We all love music, but it has to be on our own terms(each individuals). If I want my son to listen to something it isn&#39;t cool enough,  he has to find it himself.  Maybe with time he&#39;ll give me a chance. <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think so. <br/>
<br/>
I think it involves not only language, but ethics and psychology.  Lots of <br/>
people could pick it apart in their own idiom! &lt;g&gt;</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Recorder is a precursor to all those woodwinds with all the keys that cover <br/>
up little bitty holes way away, and some keys that cover up two or three <br/>
holes down below.<br/>
<br/>
So with recorder, you have to cover up (or squeak a bit of air through) those <br/>
other holes yourself!<br/>
<br/>
Cross-fingerings, it&#39;s called.  Which doesn&#39;t mean you cross your fingers.  <br/>
(At least THAT&#39;S a relief.)<br/>
<br/>
I recommend the old standard, the Trapp Family books.  They&#39;re cheap and <br/>
clear.  And if they&#39;re not clear enough without a teacher, get the Usborne <br/>
first recorder book, which has more cartoons and illustrations.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll probably be doing wrong, though: <br/>
<br/>
Blowing too hard (just kind of breathe into it, more than blow)<br/>
<br/>
tonguing too hard (use a soft &quot;duh&quot; rather than the &quot;TOO&quot; of most woodwinds, <br/>
because that will make it just squeak and chuff)<br/>
<br/>
Not covering up the holes fully (Especially middle finger on the left hand, <br/>
ring finger on the right)<br/>
<br/>
Opening too much of the thumb hole (when they say &quot;half-hole&quot; they mean <br/>
&quot;90%&quot;--leave some little bit of the hole open, but not half)<br/>
<br/>
