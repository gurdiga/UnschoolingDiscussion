<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961657525">I think apologies are important, but ther eis a sort of forced apology which <br/>
is worse than worthless--it&#39;s a bigger insult than what went before, and many <br/>
parents accept it as &quot;well he apologized&quot; because they demanded an action and <br/>
the requirement was (sufficiently) fulfilled.  Those apologies so often heard <br/>
in school counselors&#39; offices:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you made me mad.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you got mad.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t wait until later. <br/>
     [implication:  I wish I had waited until nobody was looking to hit you]<br/>
I&#39;m sorry we got in a fight.<br/>
<br/>
When the kid is clearly in the wrong, those above are insulting to the victim.<br/>
<br/>
And even REAL apologies of a decent sort can be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Consider these:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I hit you.<br/>
I should have thought of a better thing to do or say.<br/>
I shouldn&#39;t have called for help, I should have figured out how to handle it <br/>
on my own.<br/>
<br/>
When the kid is NOT so clearly in the wrong (or was clearly justified in his <br/>
anger) then it&#39;s humiliting for the kid who is made to apologize.  He&#39;s being <br/>
blamed for an incident he didn&#39;t initiate, and blamed for his <br/>
best-at-the-moment response.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It takes two&quot; is usually said by the parent of the offender.  It&#39;s lame <br/>
defense of lack of social skills, or of bullying.<br/>
<br/>
Forcing things like these would be kinda like forcing someone who had just <br/>
prevented her own date rape to apologize to the boy/man for having slapped <br/>
him, or screamed, or messing up his car on the way out.  <br/>
<br/>
There are some kids who are Eddie Haskell kids (good reference for those old <br/>
enough for Leave it to Beaver, and I don&#39;t have an example for those <br/>
younger).  To the appearance from the parental angle, they are great.  When <br/>
no parent is looking they are quietly horrible to younger kids.  When the <br/>
adults show up, they&#39;re the best kid in the room--personable, cooperative...  <br/>
 and they know from experience that if one of the little kids screams or <br/>
retaliates that the parents will be horrified that their child was rude to so <br/>
polite a guest.<br/>
<br/>
So each situation is different.  Coaching your own kid is great.  Setting a <br/>
boundary for other people&#39;s kids that you don&#39;t want them to cross is okay <br/>
too, though.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly just left without saying goodbye when she was visiting the <br/>
neighbors.  The little girl&#39;s uncle (her primary caregiver) was becoming <br/>
frustrated and irritable, and verbally abusive, and bullying, and <br/>
insensitive.  Not bad, maybe, for a childless younger man who really does put <br/>
a LOT of time toward his more-irresponsible brother&#39;s child (mother is <br/>
somewhere else entirely; perhaps incarcerated?  because it&#39;s not discussed at <br/>
all).  But Holly&#39;s not used to it and didn&#39;t want to be part of it or even <br/>
witness his behavior toward the other little girl.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the third time over the years that Holly has had a bad incident at <br/>
that house.  Not physically abusive, but stuff that to her seems insane.   <br/>
(To me, having grown up in the old traditional American way, it&#39;s just par <br/>
for the average course.)<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t dream of making her apologize for turning and going home.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about it a lot.  I told her it would have been totally fine for her <br/>
to say &quot;She doesn&#39;t understand.  Say it a different way.&quot;  Or &quot;She has <br/>
sunscreen in her eye, so she really needs a towel right now.&quot;  or &quot;You <br/>
shouldn&#39;t talk to her that way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I told her she didn&#39;t HAVE to stand up to adults she thought were being <br/>
awful, but if she did it might help, and if they got angry that her dad and I <br/>
would totally defend her.<br/>
<br/>
The neighbor will eventually be over to apologize.  I expect his apology will <br/>
be something like &quot;I&#39;m sorry Holly got scared the other day&quot; instead of &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
sorry I was hung over and abusive.&quot;  Or he&#39;ll say &quot;I&#39;m sorry Briann did <br/>
something the other day to make Holly leave.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
And then it will be my turn to speak.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra, I just read this post above, and the one about the neighbor <br/>
across the fence whom you told to be nice to your children, and <br/>
thought about some other things that you&#39;ve posted, and every time I <br/>
read one of your posts like this, I think that you and my husband <br/>
would make a great team. <br/>
<br/>
He considers it his personal crusade to right the wrongs, and curses <br/>
those who don&#39;t have the courage or desire to speak up and do the <br/>
same. He flags down cars driving too fast down our residential street <br/>
and explains to them that we have children who are entitled to be <br/>
safe on their own street without people endangering their lives <br/>
careening down the street (mind you, he&#39;s 5&#39;5&quot; and often flags down <br/>
men twice his size ... while the neighbor across the street, who is <br/>
huge, runs in his house for cover), and he stops older children who <br/>
are walking down the street cursing and talks to them about how <br/>
littler children shouldn&#39;t have to hear such angry talk, and he <br/>
breaks up fights on the street and sticks up for the picked-upon when <br/>
the high school (just two blocks from our house) lets out in the <br/>
afternoon. So far no one&#39;s clobbered him, and I&#39;m proud of him for <br/>
standing up for what&#39;s right.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you do the same in your neighborhood. <br/>

I told her to be nice to HER children! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And, btw, last night there were two police cars in front of their house, and <br/>
one of the little kids talking to a policemen.  EEEP! I can&#39;t see the street <br/>
in front of their house from here at all, we&#39;re backed up to one another, but <br/>
someone who drove to my house told me about it.<br/>
<br/>
Your husband DOES sound like me, Shelly!   I was driving one day far from my <br/>
house and two boys shoved another one into the street, just to bully and <br/>
scare him.  I pulled up, rolled down my window and said &quot;STOP IT.&quot;   &quot;Shut <br/>
up,&quot; said the bully.  &quot;GO HOME&quot; I said, and I would have followed him home <br/>
myself if he had said any more.<br/>
<br/>
Someday I might get shot for it, but I&#39;d rather be shot for defending someone <br/>
innocent than to hide in my house while HE gets shot.<br/>

someone like that, my heart just pounds. I&#39;m not as brave as he, <br/>
although I still do jump in when I see something happening. The <br/>
difference is, my heart pounds and my hands shake. I must appear <br/>
somewhat less formidable as a result, eh?!<br/>

Dear Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I wish there were 10 million more people with the bravery to speak up when <br/>
they see something bad going on. Imagine the impact that would have on the <br/>
world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451531269">your husband sounds alot like me!!! i can&#39;t stand to see someone being taken <br/>
advantage. we have a woman in our neighborhood who has done nothing but try <br/>
to cause everyone trouble. her father happenes to be a police offer. after <br/>
many untrue statements had been made and dss called on a family across the <br/>
street i had a conversation with this officer and told him that we all had <br/>
rights and he and his daughter were slandering everyone she didn&#39;t like. <br/>
nobody else would do it and i felt that someone had to tell these people to <br/>
talk to the  peole rather than make calls to  officals. note i am only 4;10 <br/>
and this man was at least 6&#39;. i am now our neighborhood spoksperson,<br/>
