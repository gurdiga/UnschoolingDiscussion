is it still restricting if i can only allow them a thing or<br/>
two beyond our normal meals? <br/>

What people are trying to say is to try to move away from arbitrary rules.  <br/>
The direction is what&#39;s important.<br/>
<br/>
When a family is really getting unschooling in a 3-D, whole-life way, things <br/>
start to become easier, I think.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>oh goody!  i look forward to the day when all of this worrying seems<br/>
ridiculous and everything else is second nature. :)  <br/>
<br/>
here&#39;s another interesting one...just after i spewed all of my worries<br/>
here at length about letting go of food restrictions, we got a paper in<br/>
the mail stating that our food stamp allowance has gone up tremendously<br/>
since my husband&#39;s pay went down and he&#39;s going back to school (guess<br/>
we&#39;re being rewarded for that?)  anyhow, it&#39;s finally at a livable level<br/>
for our family.  yippee!  this is just what i needed to have happen! <br/>
after dh came home, i drove straightaway to the store and bought up a<br/>
whole load of happy yummy goodies.  knowing i can always have some more<br/>
of *whatever* makes me much more at ease about saying *yes*.  i was<br/>
always so worried about not being able to provide completely for my<br/>
kids...now this is a non-issue and i must say, i feel so much lighter for<br/>
it. :)<br/>
<br/>
funny how things happen like that sometimes...i&#39;m smiling again!<br/>

I hope so. It can be a really hard thing to actually really get. I&#39;ve <br/>
<br/>
always leaned towards unschooling, as far as education. It&#39;s the <br/>
<br/>
other stuff that seems harder for me to really wrap my head around. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The education is the real unschooling part.<br/>
<br/>
The other is something some people find helpful.  If it doesn&#39;t appeal to you <br/>
or it doesn&#39;t make sense to you, let it go and do what you&#39;re doing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not necessary for unschooling though. It&#39;s for parents who get the<br/>
trusting their kids to learn what they need part of unschooling and then<br/>
start questioning why they&#39;re telling their kids they need to be in bed by 9<br/>
or to turn off the TV after an hour or you have to brush your teeth.<br/>
<br/>
Wanting to treat kids with respect is the first step. Then your focus shifts<br/>
from the object to helping them get what they want. Kids don&#39;t want to be<br/>
unhappy or grumpy! If they&#39;re getting grumpy from watching TV for 8 hours<br/>
straight then the goal becomes helping them figure out ways not to be grumpy<br/>
rather than figuring out ways to impose a &quot;no more than 2 hours of TV&quot;<br/>
solution. If that makes sense.<br/>
