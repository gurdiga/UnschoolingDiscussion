<br/>
By Jennifer Sterba<br/>
ARIZONA DAILY STAR [PICTURE]<br/>
<br/>
The number of home-schooled children in Pima County has grown more than <br/>
500 percent in the past decade.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s faster than Marana - Arizona&#39;s fastest-growing city.<br/>
<br/>
Proponents of the expanding effort to keep the classroom at home praise <br/>
Arizona&#39;s shedding of regulations in the mid-1990s that resulted in <br/>
giving parents more choice in deciding how, and what, their children <br/>
learn. They say Arizona is one of the best states in which to <br/>
home-school children.<br/>
<br/>
However, critics say parent-teachers should be held to the same <br/>
standards that apply to public schools, especially when it comes to <br/>
student achievement testing.<br/>
<br/>
Until the mid-1990s, Arizona required standardized testing of its <br/>
home-schooled students. Legislators did away with that under pressure <br/>
from organized home-school parents.<br/>
<br/>
Pima County&#39;s numbers reflect that change.<br/>
<br/>
In 1992, Pima County counted 450 home-schooled children. By 1995, 1,401 <br/>
students were home-schooled in Pima County.<br/>
<br/>
That number has ballooned again this year to 2,906, more than 545 <br/>
percent in the last 10 years.<br/>
<br/>
By comparison, the number of home-schooled children in Pima County grew <br/>
faster in the last decade than Marana&#39;s 520 percent growth rate, <br/>
according to 2000 census data.<br/>
<br/>
There are more home-schooled children today in Pima County than students <br/>
enrolled in the Tanque Verde School District this fall - 1,920. Tanque <br/>
Verde consists of two elementary schools and one junior high school.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Arizona&#39;s one of the best states in the country for this because it <br/>
trusts parents to educate their children properly,&quot; said Debbie <br/>
Gubernick, who maintains a Web site for the Sonoran Desert <br/>
Homeschoolers, a local support group.<br/>
<br/>
Arizona ranks with New Mexico, California and Nevada as having the least <br/>
regulation, according to the Home School Legal Defense Association. The <br/>
national, nonprofit advocacy organization defends and advances the <br/>
constitutional right of parents to direct the education of their children.<br/>
<br/>
It ranks New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island among the most heavily <br/>
regulated home-school states. Their laws include requiring parental <br/>
notification of intent to home-school, state-approved curriculum and <br/>
achievement test scores.<br/>
<br/>
Arizona requires only that parents who want to home-school their <br/>
children age 6 or older notify their county schools superintendent.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We appreciate the fact our curriculum isn&#39;t shoved down our throats,&quot; <br/>
said Shannon Federoff, a former teacher who home-schools three of her <br/>
six children. The other three aren&#39;t old enough. &quot;I have a vision of <br/>
where I want the kids to go, and I don&#39;t want to be told how to get there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Five Pima County home-school support groups offer parents guidance in <br/>
establishing a curriculum, seeking legal advice and offering <br/>
home-schooled children an avenue for interaction with other <br/>
home-schooled students. Those support groups, and about 80 others across <br/>
the state, have successfully made themselves heard in the Arizona <br/>
Legislature.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Parents who make this choice are a very strong contingent in the <br/>
Legislature,&quot; said Lorrane McPherson, an assistant superintendent for <br/>
the Tucson Unified School District. With more than 62,000 students, TUSD <br/>
is Tucson&#39;s largest school district. &quot;There is no regulation&quot; of home <br/>
schooling today, she said. &quot;There&#39;s no way to know how these kids are <br/>
progressing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While McPherson said she respects the rights of parents to choose how to <br/>
educate their children, she questions whether the state should hold <br/>
parents to the same level of accountability as it does public schools.<br/>
<br/>
A public school in Arizona that earns a second consecutive <br/>
underperforming label risks state intervention on an administrative <br/>
level. Since Arizona bases a large part of its labeling system on <br/>
results of the statewide AIMS achievement test and on whether students <br/>
show one year&#39;s academic growth, home-schooled families don&#39;t face the <br/>
same pressures and risks that public schools do.<br/>
<br/>
But decreasing regulation increases the number of education options <br/>
available to parents, proponents say.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The lawmakers in Arizona have come to the conclusion that the more <br/>
choices the parents have, the better it&#39;s going to be,&quot; said Jerry <br/>
Mintz, director of the New York-based Alternative Education Resource <br/>
Organization. Mintz founded the nonprofit organization in 1989 to <br/>
further non-traditional educational approaches.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The way the public education system has gotten into trouble is <br/>
overregulation,&quot; Mintz said. &quot;Basically people can&#39;t teach anymore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Teachers are focusing classroom efforts on what&#39;s necessary for students <br/>
to pass standardized tests. Yet across the country, home-schoolers <br/>
continue to score in the 85th percentile on standardized tests, Mintz said.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, Pima County fifth-grade students had an average math score in <br/>
the 56th percentile and an average reading score in the 36th percentile <br/>
on the Stanford 9 - a national standardized test taken by Arizona <br/>
students. Those percentiles mean that 44 percent of students nationwide <br/>
scored higher in math and 64 percent did better in reading. <br/>
Home-schooled children in Arizona are not required to take that <br/>
standardized test or any other, disallowing a comparison.<br/>
<br/>
As public schools continue to fall short of national standards, <br/>
alternative means of education such as charter schools and home <br/>
schooling appear to be more viable solutions, Mintz said.<br/>
<br/>
The effects of the growing home-school movement are also hitting the <br/>
wallets of Arizona schools, which receive state money based on the <br/>
average daily student attendance.<br/>
<br/>
Schools are losing roughly $5,000 to $7,000 for each student not sitting <br/>
in a public classroom. For Pima County, that amounts to between $14.5 <br/>
million and $20.3 million each year.<br/>
<br/>
Federoff belongs to the Holy Family Home Educators - Diocese of Tucson. <br/>
The home-school organization for Catholic families meets one Friday a <br/>
month at Hoffman Park, near Niven Avenue and East Broadway.<br/>
<br/>
That is one of the many groups relied upon by home-schoolers for student <br/>
interaction, including play dates, field trips and classroom discussions.<br/>
<br/>
Kaitlyn Torgerson, 12, one of more than 200 children from about 50 <br/>
families participating in Holy Family Educators, said she enjoys the <br/>
weekly get-togethers and learning at home.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You don&#39;t have to go to school as long and you get to be with your <br/>
friends every Friday,&quot; said Kaitlyn, a home-schooled seventh-grader. <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s an easier load, but you still learn the same amount.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Right now, Kaitlyn, who wants to be a paramedic and a mother, is <br/>
studying life science - about pollution and mammals in particular.<br/>
<br/>
Children in the Holy Family Home Educators group recently visited the <br/>
state Capitol - one of the group&#39;s members is a former senator. The <br/>
group also has &quot;Mom&#39;s Night Out,&quot; when one parent volunteers to baby-sit <br/>
while the moms get together for some downtime.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;d like to see more families get involved in support groups,&quot; Federoff <br/>
said. &quot;It makes the difference between successful home schooling and <br/>
parents throwing up their hands in despair.&quot;<br/>
