&lt;&lt; Besides which, a lot of the people we might like to convince are totally <br/>
 turned off by school-bashing.  I know my husband was.  His school <br/>
 experiences were mostly positive, so he didn&#39;t want to hear how bad schools <br/>
 are.  What he wanted to hear were the positives about <br/>
 homeschooling/unschooling.  That&#39;s what he got from me, and now he&#39;s <br/>
 totally in support.<br/>

had a good school experience and feels that it&#39;s fine for some people.<br/>
He supports homeschooling, but still disagrees with unschooling and yet does <br/>
not want to thwart us in any way. Bashing schools won&#39;t help him become more <br/>
supportive of unschooling in any way.<br/>
