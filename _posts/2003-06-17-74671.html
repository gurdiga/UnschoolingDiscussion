<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272953553">I have 4 kids 15,13, 11, and 7. We have trouble making ends meet without me working as the kids have allergies and health issues that require a fair amount of funds.<br/>

My dilemma is that I worry about not being there enough for my kids. So far I am working 20-30 hours per week and looking after my 3 year old nephew during the days. I have been working in the evenings every night and 6 hours on Sundays, occasionally Sat.<br/>
<br/>
I hate the feeling I have when I am away from my kids.

It really looks like working has to be part of our reality at this point and I hate that so I struggle with the idea that maybe I am doing them a disservice by them having a mom that isn&#39;t home enough.Sometimes I wonder if they would be better off at school although as I write this I realise how silly this is because their questions, needs, etc.. wouldn&#39;t be met anymore there.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are big homebodies. They are all highly sensitive and do not socialise with the neighbours at all. They have a small group of friends and I think this bothers me more than them. I am having trouble shaking this feeling of maybe I am not doing enough. Anybody have any experience with situations similar to this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549258933">Hi Maureen,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have 4 kids 15,13, 11, and 7. We have trouble making ends meet without me working as the kids &gt;have allergies and health issues that require a fair amount of funds.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a very tough situation you are in!  It sucks to have the stress of having to work outside the home when that is really not what anyone in your family wants.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d have to say that I don&#39;t think the kids would be better off in school than being with their parents, though.  Unless, perhaps, it was a free school (as in freedom, not as in you don&#39;t have to pay for it), they wanted to be there and you were able to get all your working in while they were there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been all over this situation, but have you brainstormed about other ways of working out the finances?  Anything from major scaling back to opening your home to a foster child (which you get paid for).  I&#39;m not coming up with anything else off the top of my head, but perhaps, if this is help that you&#39;d be interested in, others on the list can come up with some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you come to a resolution that works for you and yours.<br/>

ways, (and that book will show you an unbelievable amount of ways to cut back, <br/>
even if you think you can&#39;t) maybe you could eliminate the house cleaning job.  <br/>
<br/>
I think you also mentioned needing money for medical coverage on the kids.  <br/>
In many states, they have health coverage for children besides medicaid.  In <br/>
our state, they have something called &quot;CHIPS&quot; (children&#39;s health insurance <br/>
prescription &quot;something or other&quot;) and many different levels of it depending on a <br/>
person&#39;s income.  Some which are basically free, others with a small co-pay.  <br/>
The amount of income a person can earn and still be eligible is very generous, <br/>
and they take into consideration how many children you have.  Check with your <br/>
state&#39;s department of health and human resources.  It&#39;s worth a try...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-374391918">I am working part-time as well as taking care of my two-year-old at home.  I don&#39;t have to work for financial reasons but for my own mental health.  I need the feeling of independence.  I have three small businesses right now.  I sell used books on Amazon, I am just starting to teach music to young children, and I trade stocks.  My daughter comes with every trip I make to the post office to mail books, she listens to me prepare for music class, she hangs out while I work on the computer and read my financial publications.  I have arranged to swap partial tuition for a music class in exchange for the mom to watch Katrina during it.  I have tentative plans to do at least one more swap of tuition for child care and teach on the weekends so my husband can take care of her.  Longer term, I will be looking for late-afternoon care for her so I can teach more classes.  <br/>
<br/>
I would suggest looking at the following books for work-at-home suggestions.  Look at them in the bookstore, check them out from the library.  They are books to browse<br/>
<br/>
The Stay-At-Home Mom&#39;s Guide to Making Money from Home by Liz Folger<br/>
The Entrepreneurial Parent by Paul and Sarah Edwards and Lisa Roberts<br/>
101 Best Home-Based Businesses for Women by Priscilla Y. Huff<br/>
<br/>
I teach music and sell books and trade stocks because that&#39;s where my expertise is and I enjoy it.  I&#39;m working about 10 hours a week on the stock picking.  The income from that can be very good but it&#39;s rather erratic.  I spend about three hours a week selling books but could easily be more.  Teaching music is depends on how many classes.  It&#39;s about two hours/week of preparation time for teaching one class.  There is also about one hour/week of general business stuff.  I have a lot bigger time commitment now because I&#39;m just starting so there is lots of initial stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think it&#39;s good for my daugher to see me working.  I come from a long line of entrepreneurs and so does my husband so it seems natural to me to be working and taking care of my daughter.  As she gets older, I will have her work in the business.  She&#39;s already likes to help with packaging the books for shipment.  (Well she can&#39;t really help yet but she likes to pretend.)<br/>

  &gt; I work at a health food store and clean houses and an office part time.<br/>
  This is something we tried and only so much is interchangeable so it was not successful. I wonder if maybe I don&#39;t really understand what my true worry/concern is because in this job the solutions are limited and I can see this so I think I need to sit with this longer and try to understand the emotional impact it has on me. Maybe guilt, maybe not meeting an ideal? Anyway thanks for your thoughts tia.<br/>

  You are quick Tia,<br/>

  I am using alternative services and have limited coverage. Ouch on the <br/>
<br/>
  pocketbook.I have tried the medical system and all they offer are <br/>
<br/>
  antidepressants which have not been helpful. Even my son with low thyroid they <br/>
<br/>
  wanted to do antidepressants because his tests were low but not low enough so it <br/>
<br/>
  couldn&#39;t be thyroid. With the naturopath helping explore we have indeed found <br/>
<br/>
  that the thyroid meds have eliminated the extreme depression for him.<br/>
