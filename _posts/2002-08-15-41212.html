<div id="ygrps-yiv-880153659">Colonists Scalp Native Americans (February 20, 1725)<br/>
by News of the Odd<br/>
<br/>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://historychannel.com/tdih/index.html&quot;">http://historychannel.com/tdih/index.html&quot;</a>&gt;Today in Odd History&lt;/A&gt;, a group of American colonists attacked a Native <br/>
American encampment in New Hampshire, taking 10 scalps, for which the British <br/>
government paid a bounty of £ 100 each.<br/>
<br/>
    <br/>
The colonists, led by Captain John Lovewell, had been authorized to conduct <br/>
revenge attacks for raids by the Indians against British settlements. They <br/>
had had some success, killing and scalping an Indian man and taking a boy <br/>
prisoner in December, 1724. On February 20, 1725, they came across an <br/>
encampment, and hid in the woods until 2 AM. Once they were sure that the <br/>
enemy was asleep, they fired volleys into the camp, killing 9 Indians and <br/>
wounding one more. He tried to flee, but was chased down by a dog and killed. <br/>
The dead were scalped, and in early March, &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imaginemaine.com/directories/Archives/Lovewell.html&quot;">http://www.imaginemaine.com/directories/Archives/Lovewell.html&quot;</a>&gt;Lovewell marched into Boston&lt;/A&gt;, <br/>
wearing a wig constructed from several scalps, and carrying the plunder from <br/>
the raid—blankets, moccasins, snowshoes and rifles.Lovewell’s raids were the <br/>
first recorded instances of Europeans scalping Native Americans. The practice <br/>
is traditionally associated with North American Indian tribes. Episodes such <br/>
as this one, however, have led some people to believe that the Europeans <br/>
actually introduced scalping to America. In 1820, &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://thecowshed.tripod.com/native/cutting.htm&quot;">http://thecowshed.tripod.com/native/cutting.htm&quot;</a>&gt;an Allegheny Seneca <br/>
chieftain named Cornplanter&lt;/A&gt; claimed that the Indians were peaceful until <br/>
Europeans came. There is also some evidence that if they did not invent <br/>
scalping, European settlers did help to spread the practice &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/research/renotes/rn-09txt.htm&quot;">http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/research/renotes/rn-09txt.htm&quot;</a>&gt;westward&lt;/A&gt; as they <br/>
emigrated across the continent. &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/guestcolumnists/garlinghouse/2001/gh05-16-01.htm&quot;">http://www.frontpagemag.com/guestcolumnists/garlinghouse/2001/gh05-16-01.htm&quot;</a>&gt;The archeological evidence&lt;/A&gt;, however, suggests <br/>
that scalping did in fact originate in the Americas, and that it was <br/>
widespread long before European contact. Skulls bearing evidence of scalping <br/>
have been found throughout the Americas, many of them dating to hundreds of <br/>
years before European contact. What the Europeans did introduce was the <br/>
practice of paying bounties for scalps. These bounties led to an increase in <br/>
scalpings by white settlers, male and female; &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/divinerights/NativeTruthII.html&quot;">http://www.geocities.com/divinerights/NativeTruthII.html&quot;</a>&gt;a woman named Hanna Duston&lt;/A&gt; was <br/>
actually known as &quot;The Hatchet Lady&quot; for her scalping activities. It seems <br/>
likely that as scalping by whites became more common, Native Americans may <br/>
also have begun taking more scalps, and that tribes which had not previously <br/>
practiced scalping may have begun to do so in revenge for the scalpings <br/>
carried out against their people. If this is the case, then Native Americans <br/>
and European settlers may actually have taught each other to scalp.<br/>
