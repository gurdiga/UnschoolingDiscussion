<br/>
<br/>
Sacha Baron Cohen (the English comedian who does Ali G and Borat)<br/>
won an essay contest when he was 8, and it was in the London Times.   <br/>
I looked for the text but didn&#39;t find it.  I could read this much in  <br/>
what showed on a documentary video on YouTube.com   I couldn&#39;t pull  <br/>
the address (don&#39;t know why) but if you search for this you can find it:<br/>
Ali G before he was massiv (1/3)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a sarcastic kind of thing about school, and the school he went  <br/>
to was a fancy all-boys&#39; school in London.  (Maybe even then he was  <br/>
being sarcastic right in other people&#39;s faces and they didn&#39;t fully  <br/>
perceive it. &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My first lesson on Monday  morning is English.  This reminds us of  <br/>
the correct way to speak and write English.  This is very important  <br/>
as most of the boys have been watching television and speaking with  <br/>
their parents all weekend.  By the end of one English lesson, things,  <br/>
especially our English, are more or less back to normal.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Our second lesson on Monday is maths.   Maths is my favourite  <br/>
subject.  In maths it is a great comfort every Monday that one plus  <br/>
one still equals two.  All types of things may have happened on the  <br/>
weekend, Russia may have invaded Afghanistan, England may have lost  <br/>
against  the West Indies at cricket and the price of  [something I  <br/>
couldn&#39;t read] has jumped up, but in maths nothing has changed.  One  <br/>
plus one still equals two.  There [was more they didn&#39;t show...]<br/>

I typed in Sacha Cohen and &quot;Russia may have invaded Afghanistan&quot; and  <br/>
that&#39;s the only one that came up.<br/>
<br/>
The missing part is:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;All sorts of things may have happened over the weekend. Russia may  <br/>
&gt; have invaded Afghanistan, England may have lost against the West  <br/>
&gt; Indies at cricket, and the price of Smarties has jumped 5p. But in  <br/>
&gt; our maths lesson nothing has changed. One plus one still equals  <br/>
&gt; two. After Monday morning&#39;s maths lesson, the world does seem a bit  <br/>
&gt; more reliable and less insane than it did on Sunday night.&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And a bit more:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He concluded: &quot;If I had to change something I would make everybody  <br/>
&gt; go to school to learn again. That would make the world a better  <br/>
&gt; place, especially if teachers had to come back to school to learn  <br/>
&gt; again what it was like to be a schoolboy on a Monday morning.&quot;<br/>
