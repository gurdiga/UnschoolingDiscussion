Trust me Bob, if you want to offend me, you&#39;re gonna have to try a lot<br/>
harder than that  &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>

But just to keep the record straight, while Che did read Marxist literature<br/>
and strongly identified with Communist goals, he was never identified as nor<br/>
did he claim to be a Marxist.  In fact, the Marxists of the day called him a<br/>
Trotsky-ite, because he would not tow the party line.  Castro, himself,<br/>
never claimed, nor appeared to have, much understanding of Marxist rhetoric<br/>
until several years after the revolution, when he needed support from the<br/>
Soviets.  I refer you to &quot;Fidel Castro&quot; by Robert E. Quirk.</div>
