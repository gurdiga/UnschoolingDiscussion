<br/>
My son today was upset that he wouldn&#39;t be able to see his friend tomorrow. <br/>
His friend is a 7 year old boy who goes to school.  I explained that Trevor <br/>
went to school and wouldn&#39;t be available to play until after supper.  His <br/>
suggestion was not that he wanted to go to school to play with Trevor.  He <br/>
said &quot;Mom I will make a law to get rid of school so all kids can be <br/>
homeschooled.  That way I can see Trevor whenever I want.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Good for him.  LOL<br/>
