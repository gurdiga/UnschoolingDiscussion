<br/>
========================<br/>
 <br/>
Talk to the copying sibling and persuade her not to do that. It&#39;s horrible  <br/>
for the copied one.<br/>
 <br/>
Talk to the copied one and tell her you will try to cut down on the copying  <br/>
IF and only if she lightens up about it.<br/>
 <br/>
I have personal experience with it.<br/>
 <br/>
It won&#39;t help to buy each identical things.  It MIGHT help for Lisa to  hand <br/>
things down/over to Jackie.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes, let Jackie have the cool thing first, and tell Lisa she  can&#39;t.<br/>
Or ask Lisa to help Jackie shop and choose and co-ordinate outfits for  <br/>
Jackie.  Maybe that will help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-472019038">Sorry, mine are further apart in age (12.5 and 7) and<br/>
they LOVE to look like twins, although it&#39;s not often<br/>
possible due to differences in sizes.  I would suggest<br/>
talking about younger one&#39;s personal style (asking<br/>
what she likes and dislikes in fashion, and why) and<br/>
talking about what a cool chick the older one is and<br/>
how she always looks so cool (no wonder she wants to<br/>
look like you, you&#39;re so cool...)  Really, it&#39;s a<br/>
compliment...maybe you could help her see it like<br/>
that?<br/>

<br/>
My girls are less than 2 year apart and have always like to dress the same.<br/>
In fact,  I thought it was funny because it was my older dd who would try to<br/>
dress like her sister more often than not, when they were little.  At ages 8<br/>
and 10 they still buy the same clothes, not necessarily trying to match each<br/>
other but because they have the same taste, they are the same size, and we<br/>
shop at the same stores.  Not to mention, none of us are much into fashion<br/>
so mostly they are looking for something comfortable in a color they like or<br/>
with a horse on it.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There was a phase a few years ago where the older dd got irritated because<br/>
the younger one copied what she did or the name for a stuffed animal or<br/>
something.  I too tried to explain that it is the utmost compliment if<br/>
someone copies you.  It means they think you had a great idea.  I explained<br/>
that you can look at it like it&#39;s copying or you can be flattered.  I also<br/>
explained that my friends often copy what I do and I what they do.  If one<br/>
of us gets the idea to make soap, the other might try it.  If one of us<br/>
finds a neat knitting pattern, the other might ask for it.  I explained how<br/>
it shouldn&#39;t be a big deal between friends and my kids are friends.  At the<br/>
same time, when it was an issue I did try to help the younger dd find<br/>
original things to do or name her creatures, or what have you.  Between the<br/>
explanations and helping the younger one be more original, that phase ended<br/>
pretty quickly.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I had a sister who was three years older than me and the gap seemed much<br/>
larger than it does for my girls who are 21 months apart.  I am not sure if<br/>
it is the age, the fact that my kids don&#39;t go to school, or something else<br/>
that makes the difference seem so much smaller.  Kids at school are made to<br/>
feel inferior if they play with younger siblings.  Also, I have spent a huge<br/>
amount of time and effort over the years helping them to get along and work<br/>
out their differences.  They are great at doing it themselves now, but it<br/>
took a lot of work over the years.  That alone has improved their<br/>
relationship, I am sure.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-354404188">Out 9 yr. old twins liked to dress the same up to about age 5. We never did the &quot;twins&quot; look. but in our tiny town with only two places that sell kids clothes it was common to find something in their size with just one or two  color or size choices.<br/>
Now, no way..Some is strong color preferences but mostly it is a really strong aversion to the realization (from about age 6) that most people-even close relatives have never bothered to know which twin was which. Note-that they are only fraternal twins and  really only look like sisters in any family. They wear their hair differently but only now that Kara has glasses has their &quot;closest&quot; aunt  addressed them by name. <br/>
Their cousins have no trouble  with it. It is just so rude-of course they don&#39;t care.<br/>
The girls have always been quite wounded by this- now they won&#39;t answer if someone asks them if they are twins- I never could figure out why people get so stunned by twins. Quads or quints maybe.<br/>
They also get annoyed if their  sister wants something that they  see because they also don&#39;t want  the other to have  the same thing- Identical Barbies are grudgingly acceptable but they quickly make them &quot;individualized&quot;<br/>
This year  they  had to get the same snow boots after Xmas and the only ones  left that fit well were the same kind and color. Luckily they could see that and it went quite well.<br/>
So I guess the &quot;answer&quot; is that its pretty common for kids not to want the other to dress the same.-no help eh?  ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-626445202">I agree.  I can&#39;t say that I have experienced this personally, but I reallly  liked the way the &quot;teacher&quot; handled this situation on the Little Bill cartoon.  Andrew was angry that Little Bill was copying him and called him a copy cat.  Teach let him know that it hurt Little Bill&#39;s feelings to be called a name, like copy cat.  And let him know that really, Little Bill mostly just had similar tastes.  And that if there were things that Bill chose just because Andrew liked them, well, that was a compliment and meant that Bill respected and valued Andrew&#39;s opinions.<br/>
<br/>
I would also add to this that just as I try to stay out of the way and let my child choose to play her way, I remind her that anyone else visiting with us (or when I used to babysit) enjoys that same option.  Everyone can play with the toy or wear the veil in their own way.  In other words, if the older child gets the pleasure of choosing what she wants to wear, then so does the younger child, even if it is copying the older child.  I don&#39;t see any problem with offering or suggesting alternatives to the younger child, but really what they wear or call their stuffed animals should be their choice, right?  The older child doesn&#39;t *have* to feel animosity about being copied.  Those feelings are her own.  Though she might appreciate a little help in pondering how else she might choose to feel.   This is just more on the subject of one person enforcing behaviors on another.  Seems much better to suggest alternatives but in the end to stay out of the way and let them work it out.   <br/>
<br/>
Like LIttle Bill, I would hate to think that I coulnd&#39;t have pizza for lunch just because my best friend got it too and he doesn&#39;t like for me to get the same thing.  <br/>
