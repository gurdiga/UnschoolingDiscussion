&gt; often their fears are unfounded (would your son *really* get hurt by<br/>
&gt; climbing up a couple of steps, and then down, with you watching,<br/>
&gt; keeping him safe? Probably not, and yet i know i feel like i&#39;m<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids generally don&#39;t try to climb these store ladders past<br/>
toddler/preschooler age -- we&#39;re at the park/playlands a lot and their store<br/>
behavior is rather &quot;good,&quot; although sometimes I know there&#39;s a temptation.<br/>
They&#39;re generally not super active/adventurous types, although they&#39;ll climb<br/>
up the outside of slides, too. I agree, though, that it&#39;s unlikely to be<br/>
particularly dangerous to them to go up a couple of steps on store ladders.<br/>
<br/>
I see it as a social issue, though, in that I have empathy for the employees<br/>
who are generally low-wage and low-power and who could get in trouble if one<br/>
of their many bosses -- many of whom are low-wage and low-power themselves<br/>
-- sees children climbing on the ladders. So, in those cases, I see my older<br/>
children&#39;s desire to climb on those structures as valid, but ultimately less<br/>
important than the employees&#39; needs to keep their jobs. Climbing on the<br/>
ladder is more a whim, and, although I&#39;m all for helping kids fulfill their<br/>
whims, I don&#39;t want to do it at the expense of others -- and they can and do<br/>
climb in a lot of other places.<br/>
<br/>
Are people&#39;s jobs really at risk from kids on ladders? Maybe not. Are some<br/>
people overreacting? Undoubtedly. But I don&#39;t want to stress out people who<br/>
are already dealing with a stressful-in-its-powerlessness job (see &quot;Nickel<br/>
and Dimed&quot; by Barbara Ehrenreich for an interesting picture of life in<br/>
retail -- I don&#39;t agree with all her conclusions, but the portrait is worth<br/>
a read). It just doesn&#39;t seem kind. Plus, it keeps our shopping trips more<br/>
pleasant when employees aren&#39;t yelling at us. My kids know that the store<br/>
rules are &quot;no customers on the ladders.&quot; My older kids (7 & 9) understand<br/>
why -- &quot;fear of lawsuits&quot; as opposed to &quot;you&#39;ll fall and get hurt.&quot;<br/>

before...that the person in charge of the dept might get in trouble if <br/>
s/he doesnt make everyone follow the &quot;rules&quot;. Its usually not a big <br/>
deal, and now that he is older, he always gets down (if he even tries <br/>
to get up there in the first place.)<br/>
