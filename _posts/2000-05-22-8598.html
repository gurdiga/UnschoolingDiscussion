<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103614526">Hi again all,<br/>
<br/>
Following is another Japanese newspaper&#39;s take on the recently released <br/>
Education Ministry report here in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
It would be funny if it wasn&#39;t so tragic: Ministry officials are <br/>
quibbling over cutting class sizes by 10 students -- as public schools <br/>
nationwide are hemorrhaging their students by the hundreds (and possibly <br/>
thousands) every year.<br/>
<br/>
The ministry&#39;s stance is akin to asking passengers and crew members to <br/>
use their fingers to plug up a small leak in the Titanic.<br/>
<br/>
And the dance band plays on, as the ship goes down....<br/>

<br/>
Ministry seeks smaller class sizes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An Education Ministry panel report released Friday is giving local <br/>
government school boards more flexibility to consider establishing <br/>
smaller-sized classrooms. <br/>
<br/>
The panel, which had been considering the appropriate size of classrooms, <br/>
is reviewing the current legal maximum number of students for each class. <br/>
It is also exploring ways to better distribute teachers at public <br/>
elementary and junior high schools. <br/>
<br/>
The panel also said local governments should split up classes in certain <br/>
subjects so teachers can teach students with similar aptitude. <br/>
<br/>
Ministry officials plan to amend legislation relating to classroom <br/>
population so that smaller-sized classes can begin in fiscal 2001. <br/>
<br/>
The ministry has no intention of reducing the number of teachers, <br/>
although a budget cut is under way at most ministries ahead of <br/>
reorganization plans slated for next year. <br/>
<br/>
After calculating the required number of teachers based on a 40-student <br/>
classroom, the ministry presently grants local governments financial <br/>
subsidies that cover half the personnel cost of teachers. <br/>
<br/>
The ministry said it will keep this cost calculation, so local <br/>
governments will have to bear increasing personnel costs if they hire <br/>
more teachers to create smaller classes, the officials said. <br/>
<br/>
Because the program requires a cost increase for more teachers, local <br/>
governments are not expected to adopt the idea anytime soon. <br/>
<br/>
The panel had considered scrapping the current legal limit of 40 students <br/>
in a class and to establish a new maximum of 30. However, it gave up the <br/>
idea because the panel thought 30 students or more are needed for them to <br/>
learn social rules. <br/>
<br/>
The trial calculation by the ministry showed a 30-student class will <br/>
require 120,000 more teachers and a budget increase of about a 1 trillion <br/>
yen. <br/>
<br/>
The panel also sought to review a long-standing idea that students of the <br/>
classroom always receive lessons together. <br/>
<br/>
The panel said class size should be limited to about 20 students when <br/>
teaching Japanese, arithmetic and science to elementary school students. <br/>
<br/>
The panel also suggests the same number of students be taught in English <br/>
language, mathematics and science classes at junior high schools. <br/>
