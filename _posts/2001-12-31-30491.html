<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814443208">&lt;snip&gt;then the boundaries should be agreed upon by the one that it affects<br/>
and there should not be any fences for teenagers?<br/>
    I don&#39;t think you will *always* agree on boundaries,  younger poeple<br/>
have a morelimited view of things,  the 2 and 3 yr old won&#39;t get a lot of<br/>
say.  As for teenagers,  I can only imagine the agree to disagree<br/>
situations! LOL    I think,  that if boundaries are set and are used more<br/>
like guidelines (as I think lovemary said),  then you still,  as parent,<br/>
have more power to set them.  Howevr,  using information and listening to<br/>
your children repsectfully would underlie your boundary setting.  An example<br/>
from another list cropped up recently......about a teen that liked to wander<br/>
outdoors alone at night.  It is reasonable to inform the child about<br/>
restricting or eliminating that due to safety concerns.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How is this - my 12 yo dd would eat sweets all day if she could.  I was the<br/>
one in charge of how many sweets she ate and she said she felt like I never<br/>
let her eat any.  I could not believe this because it seemed to me that she<br/>
still ate way to many so I asked her how many desserts a day she thought<br/>
would be reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
I understand your concerns in this area,  my oldest (now 10yo)....well,<br/>
all my youngsters seem to have a sweet tooth.  I mostly try to work on this<br/>
by example.  And I think it&#39;s important to share information about how<br/>
sugar/any refined carbohydrate is digested.....what it does in your body,<br/>
especially how it can cause a spike followed by a sharp drop in blood sugar<br/>
(which in turn gives afalse sensation of hunger).  Beyond trying to help<br/>
them be aware of the effects of suger on thier body and explaining....I&#39;d<br/>
let them be in food choices.  And offer lots of choices.<br/>
    This is a real struggle for me, too.  I sometimes want to insist on<br/>
eating breakfast,  but find if I keep my mouth shut and have a nice<br/>
nutritious breakfast prepared,   that goes much further than anything I<br/>
*say*.<br/>
