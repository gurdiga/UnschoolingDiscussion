<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525362067">I&#39;m not sure every homeschooler in Baltimore City has been made aware <br/>
that the homeschool liaison has received notice of layoff (he&#39;s <br/>
retiring) and his last day will be December 5.  <br/>
<br/>
A new focus group, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:charmcityhomeschoolers@...">charmcityhomeschoolers@...</a> has been formed <br/>
to begin to discuss the issues that will inevitably affect Baltimore <br/>
City homeschoolers and strategize on a collective response to same.  <br/>
<br/>
We (the groups moderators) would like to invite Baltimore City <br/>
homeschooling parents an opportunity to work on a plan of action to <br/>
address the school system&#39;s next choice of a liaison and the office <br/>
out of which reviews and administration takes place.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone is welcome to join the group and all your ideas and insights <br/>
would be appreciated.<br/>
