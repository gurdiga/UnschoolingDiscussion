I have a Dream<br/>
by Martin Luther King, Jr.<br/>
Delivered on the steps at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. on<br/>
August<br/>
28, 1963<br/>
<br/>
Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we<br/>
stand<br/>
signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as<br/>
a great<br/>
beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared<br/>
in the<br/>
flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end<br/>
the long<br/>
night of captivity.<br/>
<br/>
But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the<br/>
Negro is<br/>
still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is<br/>
still<br/>
sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of<br/>
discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely<br/>
island<br/>
of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One<br/>
hundred<br/>
years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of<br/>
American<br/>
society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come<br/>
here<br/>
today to dramatize an appalling condition.<br/>
<br/>
In a sense we have come to our nation&#39;s capital to cash a check.<br/>
When the<br/>
architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the<br/>
Constitution<br/>
and the declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory<br/>
note to<br/>
which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that<br/>
all men<br/>
would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the<br/>
pursuit<br/>
of happiness.<br/>
<br/>
It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory<br/>
note<br/>
insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring<br/>
this<br/>
sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check<br/>
which has<br/>
come back marked &quot;insufficient funds.&quot; But we refuse to believe that<br/>
the<br/>
bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are<br/>
insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this<br/>
nation. So we<br/>
have come to cash this check -- a check that will give us upon<br/>
demand the<br/>
riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to<br/>
this<br/>
hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This<br/>
is no<br/>
time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the<br/>
tranquilizing<br/>
drug of gradualism. Now is the time to rise from the dark and<br/>
desolate<br/>
valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is<br/>
the time<br/>
to open the doors of opportunity to all of God&#39;s children. Now is<br/>
the time<br/>
to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the<br/>
solid rock<br/>
of brotherhood.<br/>
<br/>
It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the<br/>
moment and<br/>
to underestimate the determination of the Negro. This sweltering<br/>
summer of<br/>
the Negro&#39;s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an<br/>
invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is<br/>
not an<br/>
end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow<br/>
off steam<br/>
and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation<br/>
returns to<br/>
business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in<br/>
America<br/>
until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of<br/>
revolt<br/>
will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the<br/>
bright day of<br/>
justice emerges.<br/>
<br/>
But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the<br/>
warm<br/>
threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of<br/>
gaining<br/>
our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us<br/>
not seek<br/>
to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of<br/>
bitterness and<br/>
hatred.<br/>
<br/>
We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity<br/>
and<br/>
discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate<br/>
into<br/>
physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic<br/>
heights of<br/>
meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy<br/>
which<br/>
has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to distrust of all<br/>
white<br/>
people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their<br/>
presence here<br/>
today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our<br/>
destiny<br/>
and their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot<br/>
walk<br/>
alone.<br/>
<br/>
And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead.<br/>
We cannot<br/>
turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil<br/>
rights,<br/>
&quot;When will you be satisfied?&quot; We can never be satisfied as long as<br/>
our<br/>
bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the<br/>
motels<br/>
of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied<br/>
as long<br/>
as the Negro&#39;s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger<br/>
one. We<br/>
can never be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote<br/>
and a<br/>
Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no,<br/>
we are<br/>
not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down<br/>
like<br/>
waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.<br/>
<br/>
I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great<br/>
trials and<br/>
tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow cells. Some of<br/>
you<br/>
have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered<br/>
by the<br/>
storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police<br/>
brutality. You<br/>
have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with<br/>
the<br/>
faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.<br/>
<br/>
Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to Georgia, go<br/>
back to<br/>
Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities,<br/>
knowing<br/>
that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not<br/>
wallow in<br/>
the valley of despair.<br/>
<br/>
I say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties<br/>
and<br/>
frustrations of the moment, I still have a dream. It is a dream<br/>
deeply<br/>
rooted in the American dream.<br/>
<br/>
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out<br/>
the true<br/>
meaning of its creed: &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident: that<br/>
all men<br/>
are created equal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of<br/>
former<br/>
slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down<br/>
together<br/>
at a table of brotherhood.<br/>
<br/>
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert<br/>
state,<br/>
sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be<br/>
transformed<br/>
into an oasis of freedom and justice.<br/>
<br/>
I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation<br/>
where<br/>
they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the<br/>
content of<br/>
their character.<br/>
<br/>
I have a dream today.<br/>
<br/>
I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama, whose governor&#39;s<br/>
lips are<br/>
presently dripping with the words of interposition and<br/>
nullification, will<br/>
be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black<br/>
girls will<br/>
be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls and<br/>
walk<br/>
together as sisters and brothers.<br/>
<br/>
I have a dream today.<br/>
<br/>
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every<br/>
hill and<br/>
mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and<br/>
the<br/>
crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord<br/>
shall be<br/>
revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.<br/>
<br/>
This is our hope. This is the faith with which I return to the<br/>
South. With<br/>
this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a<br/>
stone of<br/>
hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling<br/>
discords of<br/>
our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith<br/>
we will<br/>
be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to<br/>
go to<br/>
jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we<br/>
will be<br/>
free one day.<br/>
<br/>
This will be the day when all of God&#39;s children will be able to sing<br/>
with a<br/>
new meaning, &quot;My country, &#39;tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of<br/>
thee I<br/>
sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim&#39;s pride, from<br/>
every<br/>
mountainside, let freedom ring.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let<br/>
freedom<br/>
ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring<br/>
from<br/>
the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the<br/>
heightening<br/>
Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!<br/>
<br/>
Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!<br/>
<br/>
Let freedom ring from the curvaceous peaks of California!<br/>
<br/>
But not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!<br/>
<br/>
Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!<br/>
<br/>
Let freedom ring from every hill and every molehill of Mississippi.<br/>
From<br/>
every mountainside, let freedom ring.<br/>
<br/>
When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and<br/>
every<br/>
hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up<br/>
that<br/>
day when all of God&#39;s children, black men and white men, Jews and<br/>
Gentiles,<br/>
Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in<br/>
the words<br/>
of the old Negro spiritual, &quot;Free at last! free at last! thank God<br/>
Almighty,<br/>
we are free at last!&quot;</div>
