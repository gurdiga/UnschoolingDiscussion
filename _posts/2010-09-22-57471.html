<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317171124">&quot;The perfect balance between fun and learning!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holy crap.<br/>
I do love National Geographic, and when I was teaching I used to get  <br/>
two copies of National Geographic World, cut them up and put them all  <br/>
up whole, like one giant poster, on a big bulletin board in my  <br/>
classroom, and the kids would actually, truly, stand there and read  <br/>
them, for fun.   And I was teaching English.<br/>
<br/>
And I like that they have a younger-kids magazine now.<br/>
<br/>
But holy crap, what a TERRIBLE, horrible advertising line:  &quot;The  <br/>
perfect balance between fun and learning!&quot;<br/>
If there&#39;s a balance, how easy it must be for it to tip over into JUST  <br/>
learning, and not fun.  Or JUST fun, with all the learning on the  <br/>
other side.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Maybe it would be a really cool thing to have, if I had little kids  <br/>
still, but it&#39;s no youtube; it&#39;s not national-geographic online or on  <br/>
an iPad.<br/>
When I was a kid, though, I would have loved to have had something  <br/>
like that--designed to be entertaining and full of color photos.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910488390">Yeh, why cannot it be learning is fun, or fun is all about learning.<br/>
<br/>
The whole world works like that. I used to be a teacher too and taught<br/>
German language, with great difficulty to kids who were allowed to take the<br/>
option of a foreign language only if they had a score a 80% or above. How<br/>
does that have anything to do with language skills beats me till today. I<br/>
taught without any audio-visual aid to  several classes of 40 kids, the only<br/>
audio being my own voice without a mike and the only visual being the black<br/>
board and what I wrote on it with a piece of chalk. My repeated pleas for<br/>
audio-visual aid falling on deaf years of the school management.<br/>
<br/>
And all the 80% and above could not help them learn German, because it was<br/>
not fun learning a language that way. Then after I had quit, some of the<br/>
same kids came home for help and they learnt to speak German and went to<br/>
Germany on scholarship from Goethe Institut.  Some are doing advanced<br/>
courses in Goethe Institut Delhi.<br/>
<br/>
This school advertised (yes private schools advertise in India) &quot;Blending<br/>
tradition with modernity&quot;. It is one of the more well known chain of private<br/>
schools India. They have now opened colleges too. I am glad to say I no<br/>
longer have anything to do with schools.<br/>
<br/>
Then you have &quot;not a school, but a home away from home&quot;.  and here is<br/>
another  one &quot;You give birth but we nurture them&quot;. Holy crap alright....<br/>
<br/>

Do you mean they went to your house and learned it one-on-one?<br/>
That&#39;s cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-3577725">Yes, that is what I meant. For several years I did that. Because these were<br/>
kids who were eager to learn and the school environment was unable to<br/>
nurture this eagerness, both for me as a teacher and them as pupils.<br/>
<br/>
Very satisfactory. I have stopped taking lessons since my son was born. he<br/>
is young and needs a lot of my time. But a I still get a lot of requests.<br/>
Maybe I will start someday.<br/>

<br/>
Yeh, can you beat that. Isn&#39;t that an oxymoron. What else is life?????<br/>
<br/>
We could write a book on these kinda one liners!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Then in my city in India, schools started using the International tag, then<br/>
they started using World School and now it is Global School.<br/>
