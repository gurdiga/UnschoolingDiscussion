<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a distributor for Dorling Kindersley books, which is a fantastic way to <br/>
get great books for your own family for free and make a little money on the <br/>
side.  (I only make a little $ from it, but of course you could make more by <br/>
putting more effort into the marketing and sales.)  Feel free to email me if <br/>
you want info on becoming a distributor or just checking out their excellent <br/>
books, CD-ROMs, activity packs, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I also do medical transcription from home, and anything else people will pay <br/>
me to type at home in my jammies (data entry, architect and engineer specs, <br/>
desktop publishing, etc.).  There&#39;s an enormous demand for skilled medical <br/>
transcriptionists and I frequently have to turn work down because my workload <br/>
could easily become overwhelming.  I know there are college courses and <br/>
certified medical transcriptionist accreditations, but I dove right into the <br/>
field when I was 18 when I found a doc who was willing to train, and here I <br/>
am almost 15 years later with a wonderful career that&#39;s PERFECTLY suited to <br/>
my current life with two Littles.  <br/>
