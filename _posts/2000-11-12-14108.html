&lt;&lt; I think the path to the inner spirit is the road less<br/>
 travelled and though cirumstances make living that way<br/>
 more difficult-it&#39;s definitely what I want my kids to<br/>
 possess when they leave home.  Whether you call that<br/>
 &quot;unschooling&quot; or simply learning to listen to your<br/>
 inner voice, to me it means letting go of control and<br/>
 sometimes structure in order to let children find<br/>
 their own voices within. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Carol B, it sounds like you have a great grip on what is right for your <br/>
family.  You&#39;re right, it doesn&#39;t matter what you call it, as long as it <br/>
works to promote creativity in learning.<br/>
<br/>
Can I ask a question about your 7 year old, who you think might be adhd, if <br/>
you tested him?  what was he like when he was 3?? What are the early warning <br/>
signs.  I have a child that doesn&#39;t sit still. constantly moving is body in <br/>
some way, swirling his legs or lying on the floor at church, can&#39;t sit still <br/>
a the table.  I know, these things can be very very normal for many toddlers. <br/>
 Just checking to see what you saw in your son at that age/<br/>

I wish to appeal to homeschoolers not to treat this as the disease or <br/>
&quot;condition&quot; school does.  A three year old shouldn&#39;t be expected to sit still <br/>
for a whole &quot;mealtime&quot; with the adults just as still as anyone who&#39;s 45 years <br/>
old, nor to sit still through a whole church service he hardly understands a <br/>
word of.  <br/>
<br/>
As to it being very normal for many toddlers, I&#39;d be WAY more worried about a <br/>
three year old who COULD sit still and quiet in either of those situations.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a &quot;problem,&quot; it&#39;s being a normal, thinking, curious kid who wants to <br/>
receive input and stimulation.  Parents can and sometimes do train that out <br/>
of their kids, but that is a huge detriment to homeschooling and especially <br/>
unschooling, to kill the spark that makes them want to know and do and be and <br/>
respond from themselves instead of from a set of rules.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351320312"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I usually read<br/>
 </span></blockquote>aloud from a book and often the kids read aloud, too<br/>
and then we each read a book of our own.  But, this<br/>
time lately, too, has been just filled with bickering<br/>
about who is going to sit where and what blanket they<br/>
want and pretty soon I lose my temper because I&#39;m just<br/>
so tired of hearing all these problems over nothing!<br/>
<br/>
Wow Carol...we&#39;re living parallel lives. Last night it almost killed me to<br/>
get through 2 chapters of a book. The youngest got into a bag of sugar and<br/>
talked non-stop, another was jumping on the couch, and the other two just<br/>
kept plain interrupting and crabbing at the others. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is where I just get up and leave and go do something else.  If they<br/>
won&#39;t sit still or stop bickering etc, then they aren&#39;t interested in the<br/>
book, activity, or whatever.  I just go do something for myself.  If they<br/>
really want the story, they&#39;ll shape up pretty fast.  If not, then no story.<br/>
Lots of this stuff is for attention only (mom&#39;s attention).  When it doesn&#39;t<br/>
work, they usually cut it out.  This doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t do it again<br/>
another day, though.<br/>
