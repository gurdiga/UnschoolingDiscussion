<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296635242">Okay, speaking of book worship, which I freely and unabashedly admit...<br/>
<br/>
I finally got some book shelves up in the living room after our move and <br/>
am in the midst of unpacking my book boxes. Ahhhhh....now it&#39;s finally <br/>
starting to feel like home. I love my books!<br/>
Who was it--Cicero?--who said a room without books is like a body <br/>
without a soul.<br/>

Hi all, when I finally tire of doing all the silly things I fill my life up with, I&#39;m going to build a library. I did this exercise once, from The Artists Way by Julia Cameron, where I wrote down all the things my inner perfect child wanted and she wanted a library, kind of like the one in the My Fair Lady movie. I liked the dresses too... so my library will have lots of rich textures and smells - wood grain, leather, stone, silk, satin, velvet... And glass fronted bookshelves... <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to stock the library with classics and books that I love, especially children&#39;s books, and antique books (is there such a thing as antique books?) <br/>
<br/>
When I grow up (retire?) I&#39;m going to turn into a reader of books. Right now I spend all day reading the screen... and writing. (and renovating houses and landscaping and gardening and growing plants). <br/>
<br/>
wishing you peace and prosperity, <br/>
Beverley Paine<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, actually there are &#39;antique books&#39; - my SIL buys and sells them <br/>
as a hobby. Really really old copies of the Bible, atlases, first <br/>
editions in some cases, all sorts of stuff. And, like other antiques, <br/>
things like provenance, rarity, and condition play a part in the <br/>
value. And, too, sometimes they&#39;re just fun - really old atlases are <br/>
pretty interesting (we&#39;re talking atlases from the 1800s and such).</div>
