<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602137360">This was under another topic, so I&#39;ve brought it out.<br/>
<br/>
First poster:<br/>
I&#39;m sure this topic has been on here a thousand times, but since I&#39;m  <br/>
new here, I<br/>
was wondering what some of you do about kids and cleaning house? I&#39;m  <br/>
pretty<br/>
laid back about it, then when the house starts to look thrashed I  <br/>
become &quot;Sarge<br/>
Mom&quot; and belt out orders. I hate when that happens. Their rooms I  <br/>
don&#39;t really<br/>
worry about - I just shut the door. I&#39;m just looking for creative  <br/>
ideas for the<br/>
rest of the house. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Second:<br/>
What do you mean by thrashed? Kids toys everywhere? General cleaning<br/>
not kept up? It sounds like you clean only in crisis mode, when it&#39;s<br/>
reached a critical point. Perhaps you can try cleaning more regularly<br/>
so it doesn&#39;t get to that point. My kids have always loved doing<br/>
housework such as vacuuming, dusting, wiping banisters, mopping<br/>
floors, and cleaning windows. I&#39;ve always let them have fun doing it<br/>
and don&#39;t criticize their efforts in any way. Over the years their<br/>
skills have improved and housework isn&#39;t a dreaded thing like I see in<br/>
some other families.<br/>
<br/>
What lots of families here do is to think of housework in a different  <br/>
way, instead of as something kids should be made to do, and different  <br/>
from thinking mom&#39;s a martyr who has to do everything.<br/>
<br/>
There are some reports and commentary here:<br/>

feel like I need help cleaning, I ask for help.  My kids are free to <br/>
say no and they know that.  What I meant was that my kids have always <br/>
enjoyed doing things around the house and I believe they feel that way <br/>
because I&#39;ve never made it a power struggle.<br/>

it (my friend Karen calls it &quot;serving without counting the cost,&quot; and I like<br/>
that; I think a<br/>
lot of moms keep a mental balance sheet in their heads: I&#39;ve done X amount<br/>
of work<br/>
and you people OWE me) but even with help from the kids and my dh, who does<br/>
quite<br/>
a lot, I felt like I was pouring more time into housework than I wanted to.<br/>
So I took a poll.<br/>
I asked my hubby and the older kids what bugs them when it isn&#39;t clean or<br/>
tidy. I &#39;polled&#39;<br/>
myself too. ;) I like a clean kitchen, bathrooms, living room floor. Hubby<br/>
likes: no shoes<br/>
under computer desk (I had no idea!), magazines *not* whisked off to<br/>
magazine rack<br/>
before he gets home from work, dishwasher unloaded before dinner (he does<br/>
the dinner dishes).<br/>
Various kids said: &quot;I like my Muse magazines to be put away so the baby<br/>
doesn&#39;t rip off the<br/>
covers.&quot; &quot;I like my bed smooth so I can play on it but it&#39;s too hard for me<br/>
to get it right.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t like crumbs on my chair.&quot; &quot;I wish no one would leave the Sculpey<br/>
out because the<br/>
baby mixes all the colors.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Turned out no one in the house cares about what our closets look like, or<br/>
the laundry room<br/>
where I pile up all the clutter.<br/>
<br/>
When we looked at specifics, it was a pretty short list. Housekeeping books<br/>
are big and fat,<br/>
but the list of what matters to the people who live here is very manageable.<br/>
And I have noticed<br/>
people doing things that *other* people mentioned, voluntarily, because it<br/>
feels good to do<br/>
something nice for mom or dad or sisters or kids. The 12yo unloads the<br/>
dishwasher after<br/>
breakfast. She doesn&#39;t have to. She knows her dad appreciates it. I keep an<br/>
eye out for<br/>
shoes under the computer table. (But shoes are abandoned there less often,<br/>
now that we&#39;re<br/>
paying attention to it.) I leave new magazines on the table by the couch<br/>
instead of putting<br/>
them in the magazine rack. All the kids take more care to put away the<br/>
Sculpey. It&#39;s a pleasure<br/>
to surprise my 7yo by making her bed  all smooth the way she likes it but I<br/>
rarely get the chance:<br/>
her big sisters help her out.<br/>
<br/>
I can stay on top of the kitchen, the bathrooms, and the living room floor.<br/>
That&#39;s not a huge<br/>
workload.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712417096">Melissa - I love the poll idea.  I will do that just to see what everyone else thinks.  I tend to walk around my house with my own mom&#39;s eyes...but she had 2 kids and didn&#39;t homeschool - we have 8 and do, plus even both adults are home all day and in my house growing up everyone worked or went to school (and only 2 kids) out of the home all day.  I need to change the way I, 1. look at the house, and 2. look at myself because of the house.  Thanks everyone for your great ideas.  Shannon<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-611872969">Hi melissa, we are a large house hold as well (7,and  im a melissa too!)<br/>
I really like what you wrote here...it is something I want to ask my family about ASAP...<br/>
<br/>
In our home, things have always moved pretty smoothly...we generally do similarly to <br/>
Emily Troper...we invite alot, and if I see something needs done, that I know a child will <br/>
enjoy doing, I start doing it when the child is present...then the child or many children lol, <br/>
will get going on it, usually. If not, I might ask (or might not), and accept a no Most of the <br/>
time.  If I cannot accept a no, I will explain in advance why I cannot accept a no (like weve <br/>
got to leave before x oclock but the goats need feeding, milking and the cheese checked <br/>
fire stooked (stoked?) and the cats all out etc etc.  They all know Im willing to look at what <br/>
needs done and we can decide together who will do what where and when....   there are <br/>
some jobs that just gotta get done...<br/>
<br/>
Ive been having a bit of difficulty more recently due to dh as he is getting rather sensative <br/>
to &quot;mess&quot; as he ages (he is 50 now).   my oldest girls are excellent support when they are <br/>
home, very intuitive and willing (if dh doesnt get pushing about the &quot;mess&quot;, imagined or <br/>
not) yet they are both down the mountain in town for the week living at their grandma&#39;s <br/>
and home on weekends.<br/>
the older boys (10y and 14y) are both helpful but not in that same intuitive way the girls <br/>
are...mainly because they are more interested in the outside work as they have always <br/>
followed their papi about more than me (he is home most of the time).<br/>
<br/>
we have two home businesses going here--flute making and spinning/weaving/sewing<br/>
and weekends when everybody is homes can be overwhelming sometimes!  flutes <br/>
everyplace, bits of wool fluff, balls of yarn, spools of yarn, cloth...and then all the other <br/>
projects everyone else has going on as well... right now, bow and arrow makings, spinning <br/>
wheel constructions, etc etc...not to mention the food prep and dishes, clothes clean and <br/>
notsoclean...<br/>
<br/>
so thank you so much for this!<br/>
melissa in italy mamma of 7<br/>

Melissa this sounds like a great idea.  I definitely have moments of keeping<br/>
score of what I do, and then feeling resentment towards dh and the kids for<br/>
not &quot;doing their share&quot;.  That&#39;s something I&#39;m paying attention to, and<br/>
shifting when I can.  It has become easier to do with the kids; still not so<br/>
easy to shift with dh - but I&#39;m working on it.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;We have the need to be accepted and to be loved by others, but we cannot<br/>
accept and love ourselves. The more self-love we have, the less we will<br/>
experience self-abuse. Self-abuse comes from self-rejection, and<br/>
self-rejection comes from having an image of what it means to be perfect and<br/>
never measuring up to that ideal. Our image of perfection is the reason we<br/>
reject ourselves the way we are, and why we don&#39;t accept others the way they<br/>
are.&quot; <br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t try to shift gradually and with difficulty.  Just find a switch  <br/>
to flip.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;ve talked to much older women who have been married 50, 60  <br/>
years, they got there by putting up with some of what seemed like  <br/>
nonsense, but when they get older the husbands generally became very  <br/>
solicitous and generous and kind.<br/>
<br/>
Same as with kids, the nicer you are to them, the nicer they&#39;ll  <br/>
ultimately be to you.  And just as with kids, if you see a kid really  <br/>
strident and resentful and angry, it&#39;s probably all been deposited in  <br/>
him little by little over the years.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not a recommendation to get strident and resentful and angry  <br/>
over little things your husband might have done or not done.  It&#39;s a  <br/>
reminder that husbands are often wounded big kids.  And our culture  <br/>
has taken a lot away from men in various little ways and big ways.   <br/>
It&#39;s hard for them to grow up and feel displaced and powerless,  <br/>
socially.   Some posture.  Some go quiet.  Be nice to them.  Be  <br/>
cheery and bring them food.  Thank them for little stuff, and tell  <br/>
them they&#39;re good at something or other, and it will make a big  <br/>
difference.<br/>
