&lt;&lt; So does this mean everything is just luck of the draw from your POV?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no draw.<br/>
There&#39;s just being born and living and dying, with all kinds of exciting <br/>
adventures in there if you&#39;re lucky and curious and active.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; And whether it is or isn&#39;t, is there a purpose for being here, that you <br/>
see?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the question behind all human custom and religion and philosophy for <br/>
the past 6,000 to some-million years.  While it&#39;s interesting to learn about <br/>
how beliefs have evolved through that time and why people believe things and how <br/>
beliefs change, to think they never figured it out but I have would be <br/>
presumptuous and goofy.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; What about children, who have never heard of these <br/>
cosmic/religious/philosophical/belief theories, kids who talk about things <br/>
that they just know and recognize?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A lot of kid talk about things they think they know, but a kid talking about <br/>
something doesn&#39;t make it true.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;Have you ever met a child like that, and if so, how did you react to <br/>
them?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;React&quot; is usually a very quick moment of time.<br/>
&quot;A child like that&quot; could be lots of things, so since I don&#39;t know what you <br/>
mean and I&#39;m not sure you do either, there&#39;s no sense asking for clarification <br/>
since it won&#39;t make it easier for anyone to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Do you automatically discount them and what they seem to believe they know <br/>
if they <br/>
can&#39;t explain how or where it comes from?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t automatically discount anyone or anything.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What benefits would a child get from an adult who doesn&#39;t believe them, <br/>
from your POV?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What is your question?<br/>
Do you believe everything every child says and do you think that&#39;s a benefit <br/>
to a child?<br/>
<br/>
Are you edging up toople should do what&#39;s in front of them to do, and do it <br/>
as honestly and as well as they can while still being comfortable in their <br/>
lives and their families.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Should&quot; or what?<br/>
<br/>
Or they won&#39;t be as good, honest or comfortable as they could have been <br/>
otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
I think people have an inate idea about there being better and worse states, <br/>
and better and worse decisions.  Good usually feels good to the agent and the <br/>
recipient.  Bad causes negativity. Not all &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are cultural.  If <br/>
they were, babies would have nothing to cry about until someone else had <br/>
taught them what to expect.  Food is better than lack of food.  Warmth is better <br/>
than freezing cold.  Sleeping on sand or leaves is better than sleeping on rocks <br/>
or sticks.  Stabbing your neighbor with a stick is generally worse than <br/>
sharing your food with him, and so on.<br/>

   I thought when you wrote &quot;I didn&#39;t figure you knew what you were <br/>

<br/>
   When you say &quot;there&#39;s no sense asking for clarification <br/>
since it won&#39;t make it easier for anyone to unschool.&quot;  that is a <br/>
passive aggressive remark.  You are as much in this thread as anyone <br/>
else is.  Your posts are not making it easier to unschool than <br/>
anyone elses.  It was a comment could have been said to yourself, <br/>
but instead it was to take a quick bite at Rhonda. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, people make choices all the time.<br/>
<br/>
In college I went to dinner promptly at 5:30 every day. One day for no<br/>
particular reason I was late and during that time a girl stopped by because<br/>
she needed a new room and my name was on a list of people without roommates.<br/>
(Mine had moved to a sorority.) I said sure and she moved in and we became<br/>
good friends. She introduced me to the frat she hung out at where her<br/>
boyfriend was. We hung out there regularly and a couple years later I met my<br/>
future husband at that frat.<br/>
<br/>
Was my being late for dinner that day driven by cosmic powers so my husband<br/>
and I could meet a few years later?<br/>
<br/>
Well, why wouldn&#39;t the cosmic powers have just brought my roommate to my<br/>
door earlier so they didn&#39;t have to delay me to dinner?<br/>
<br/>
And if we&#39;d missed each other and The Cosmic Powers wanted me to get<br/>
involved with the frat, wouldn&#39;t they send other event my way?<br/>
<br/>
Frankly I think the foundations of cosmic forces crumble once you start<br/>
thinking them through.<br/>
<br/>
There were choices and circumstances that brought us together at the right<br/>
time and future events happened because of it, but I think the conjunction<br/>
was all just chance. It&#39;s spooky that I was late to dinner the one day my<br/>
roommate and I could have hooked up. But, nonetheless, I don&#39;t believe there<br/>
were any cosmic powers directing it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never met a child like that.<br/>
<br/>
I think 1000&#39;s of people have feelings about times, events, places and no<br/>
one pays any attention when they&#39;re wrong. Chances are that with that many<br/>
people guessing, someone&#39;s going to inadvertently guess something that makes<br/>
sense. And everyone will pay attention.<br/>
<br/>
I think people have been conning others since the beginning of language.<br/>
<br/>
I heard about this scam in college. A guy would write to a 1000 people and<br/>
tell half he predicted a certain stock would rise and tell the other half it<br/>
would fall. Of those half he sent the &quot;right&quot; prediction to, he split those<br/>
in half and sent half rise and half fall predictions on a different stock.<br/>
After 5 predictions he&#39;s got about 30 people convinced he can predict<br/>
stocks.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter is sometimes convinced that she&#39;s right on something she<br/>
remembers when I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s wrong. Sometimes it&#39;s a good thing to<br/>
find out what really happened. Sometimes it makes no difference and it isn&#39;t<br/>
worth the knowledge of knowing she was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If a young child were telling me some &quot;psychic&quot; story about being some place<br/>
or experiencing something, I&#39;d treat it seriously. I&#39;ve heard some<br/>
interesting tales and I&#39;ve nodded and accepted that they were presenting<br/>
what they felt were honest accounts. I haven&#39;t been in a situation where it<br/>
would be necessary to tell a young child I believed she was lying.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid were older and had a firm grasp of reality, it would depend on the<br/>
circumstances and the child how I&#39;d react to my disbelief. Psychic phenomena<br/>
is low on my believability scale so from my point of view the explanations<br/>
of someone telling a &quot;psychic&quot; tale would be that they were confused or<br/>
lying or teasing me.<br/>

Have you seen the charming movie &quot;Serendipity&quot; with Kate Beckinsale? The<br/>
efforts of The Cosmic Powers to get two people together as illustrated<br/>
in that film are Herculean! <br/>
