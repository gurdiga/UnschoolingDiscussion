<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679258978">***I&#39;de much rather &quot;fuck&quot; be avoided that &quot;practice, teach, lesson,<br/>
chore, <br/>
routine, bedtime, command, NO, punish, text book, &quot; ***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the eff word ever gave me a moments unhappiness in my<br/>
childhood.  But I could have lived more joyously if I&#39;d never heard those<br/>
others as a child.<br/>
<br/>
My son is very sensitive to words used by other parents and by some of<br/>
his friends.  One girl is forever asking &quot;are we ALLOWED to do that?&quot;   <br/>
We don&#39;t even use &quot;allowance&quot;, as in money paid weekly to a kid, because<br/>
it implies the power of the big to DIS allow.    Extreme maybe. ( we&#39;re<br/>
weird &lt;g&gt;)  My son gets a pay day, just like the rest of us. <br/>
<br/>
If we move away from words that have a psychological hold over parents<br/>
(the powerful) and children (too often the powerless) we&#39;ll all be better<br/>
off.   <br/>
Applied to unschooling it&#39;s even more important to be aware of the power<br/>
of the words we use to effect the way children view themselves and their<br/>
own intelligence and their own power. <br/>
<br/>
For the sake of not wanting to think about it too deeply if an<br/>
unschooling mom makes no effort to move away from &quot;school&quot; language<br/>
she&#39;ll be doing less than everything in her power to help her unschooling<br/>
children find their OWN power.   <br/>

<br/>
Hmm.<br/>
We still say &quot;allowance.&quot;<br/>
Never much thought about it. <br/>
But we&#39;ve never even HINTED there was such a thing as withholding allowance.  <br/>
They don&#39;t have to earn it in any way. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the part of their dad&#39;s income that they&#39;re allowed to have gratis to <br/>
use as they wish without our agreement.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of their dad&#39;s income is also potentially available to them, but <br/>
they have to negotiate that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t require them to do anything particular with their allowance either.  <br/>
Some families make them put some in savings, or to charity, or make them buy <br/>
their clothes or lunches.  <br/>
<br/>
If my kids are going out for the day I&#39;ll ask if they need money, without <br/>
regard to whether they just got allowance or not.  Usually they say no, they <br/>
don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I used to give Kirby $5 for lunch any time he was going to work for more than <br/>
just a few hours.  He never asks for it any more.  He uses his own money.  <br/>
But if he did ask for it, I&#39;d be happy to give it to him.  If he said &quot;Mom, <br/>
I&#39;ve spent my money and really want to buy a gift for so&#39;n&#39;so&quot; or &quot;I need to <br/>
pay other kids&#39; way to the movies because I owe them,&quot; I would hand him $20 <br/>
or $30 happily, because I figure on that lunch deal, I&#39;m in his debt.  But <br/>
we&#39;re not counting.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s the way it is here.   When there&#39;s money we all have some to<br/>
spend.  Dylan doesn&#39;t have to earn anything.   For a while he regularly<br/>
put some portion into his savings account and still does sometimes but<br/>
it&#39;s up to him.  The things he&#39;s interested in are more expensive now,<br/>
Playstation games, etc. and putting some away isn&#39;t as easy as it was<br/>
when he was younger.    ( his parents feel this too!)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We ask Dylan, too.   And he asks us!   Yesterday he forgot to take water<br/>
to Karate and asked if I could go downstairs and get him a bottle. (<br/>
there&#39;s a kids club right below the dojo)   He asked if I needed<br/>
money.&lt;g&gt;   Such a cool kid.    <br/>

Ah, shucks. &lt;blush&gt;<br/>
I haven&#39;t felt anything like cool this month.  I&#39;ve had some awful virus<br/>
and it&#39;s all I can do to get up and get going.   But I have found it&#39;s<br/>
just as easy to be sick sliding down the big hill at the end of Montana<br/>
street as it is to be sick at home on the sofa.  <br/>
Tomorrow we&#39;re going bird watching, then out to lunch with friends and<br/>
then Dylan has a Tae Kwon Do class and then I have a clay class.   My<br/>
cool kid just drags me into the world in spite of myself.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
