??? He just said that the xrays show arthritis forming.  He is an<br/>
orthopaedic surgeon and is requesting a 2nd opinion and a nerve test<br/>
because he can find no reason for the rest of the pain in my hand.  It is<br/>
very intense in the area he &quot;sees&quot; the arthritis (I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m<br/>
looking at) but the pain extends half way up my forearm and to my knuckles.<br/>
 He says this is not characteristic of arthritis.  All this started when an<br/>
airbag exploded while I was holding the steering wheel.  THANKS FOR ALL THE<br/>
SUGGESTIONS.  ambersand<br/>

Bologna its not characteristic<br/>
my hand can be hurting and i will get a pain in my elbow like my elbow is<br/>
in a vice grip<br/>
with someone hitting the funny bone repeatedly with a hammer head ... yes,<br/>
get another opinion<br/>
you have joints to damage, lining to damage and nerves to damage with<br/>
arthritis ... all of which<br/>
give a different sensation and pain to another area surroung or extending<br/>
from the onset of the<br/>
flare ...<br/>
<br/>
things to look for (but not always will you be able to SEE it until it gets<br/>
worse)<br/>
nodules (bumps) small or large<br/>
heat <br/>
redness<br/>
swelling<br/>
joint damage (bone shape will begin to look different than the other side<br/>
of your body same spot)<br/>
<br/>
starting with the airbag explosion is very characteristic as arthiritis<br/>
will usually show up after some type of trauma<br/>
because thats when your immune system attacks the strongest (arthritis is<br/>
an auto immue disease which means<br/>
the body attacks itself viewing it as the bad guy) , so when it sees trauma<br/>
it attacks and then gets carried away<br/>
<br/>
you may well also have nerve and or soft tissue damage from the blow from<br/>
the airbag adding to it<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps ... Main thing is keep on it ... don&#39;t leave it for later<br/>
because it wont get better in the long run unless dealt with.<br/>
It can seem to disappear for a bit but &quot;as arnold says&quot;  It WILL be BACH :(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-77186402">Thanks Kathy.  I try not to believe &quot;everything&quot; these docs say, but when you don&#39;t know ???  We are going to the library on Monday and I think its time to educate myself on arthritis.  Plus, I&#39;m going to talk to the health food store folks.  I&#39;m visiting family in Ocala now and there is a really nice store I used to go to when we lived here.  ambersand<br/>
