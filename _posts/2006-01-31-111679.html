<div id="ygrps-yiv-896896219">&quot;Well these were interesting points that you made and I think I<br/>
should keep a watchful eye on the situation to be sure that he (or<br/>
the girls) don&#39;t feel like they have to be the adult because there<br/>
is only one for awhile.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think some of those dynamics are totally normal when a two parent<br/>
household becomes one parent for a time. I&#39;ve seen it happen with<br/>
other friends of mine, and it&#39;s really not a problem if the parent<br/>
isn&#39;t expecting them to be mini-adults.<br/>
