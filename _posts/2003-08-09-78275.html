<div id="ygrps-yiv-180609720">**And a Newbery questions, too.  Tim just read the 1952 Newbery winner <br/>
(Ginger<br/>
Pye) and wanted to know what the winning author gets besides a medal.  Like<br/>
money or anything?  I didn&#39;t find the answer at the Newbery site.  We<br/>
wondered if maybe it is just an award that&#39;s a major honor, garners the<br/>
author great publicity for the book, and guarantees bigger sales and hence<br/>
more $$ that way.  Anybody know?**<br/>
<br/>
I know that they give a speech, because I read a book of collected <br/>
Newbery acceptance speeches at my library.<br/>
<br/>
Children&#39;s librarians would know, I betcha.<br/>
