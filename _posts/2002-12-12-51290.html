<div id="ygrps-yiv-422472106">Hi Kathy, My name is Jennifer and I currently live in Arlington.  I am in the process of opening the Hearlight DFW Learning Community in the DFW area.  There are quite a few unschoolers in the area, but they seem to keep pretty quiet since their aren&#39;t any specific unschooling groups here.  I do have a local discussion group if you would like to check it out.  Just visit the website at www.heartlightdfw.com and click on the link at the bottom of the page to reach the yahoo group.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I am married to Kevin and we have a 3 year old daughter named Hunter.  Where exactly are you in DFW?<br/>
<br/>
Speak to you soon.<br/>
<br/>
Jen<br/>
