  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen a situation yet in which the mom blossomed  <br/>
into a calmer, happier more confident person and it didn&#39;t then cause  <br/>
a change in the children or the husband or both.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165693368">Last night at my 9yo DS soccer party, there was a card set out for <br/>
all the boys to sign for the coach.  My DS looked a little nervous <br/>
and came up to me and very quietly  said &quot;I always forget which way <br/>
J&#39;s go, this way or that way?&quot;  I showed him by *drawing* a J in the <br/>
air.  <br/>
 <br/>
He is definitely beginning to notice things he cannot do as well as <br/>
others can.  Writing is the big one right now.  It is just not <br/>
something that interests him at all so he rarely writes.   While we <br/>
do have unschooling friends to play and hangout with, we also have a <br/>
lot of family (the boys have 12 cousins) nearby that we see fairly <br/>
often...all of whom are in public school.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m looking for ways to be more confident in this area around other <br/>
people.  I don&#39;t want my son to feel embarrassed around other kids.  <br/>
I also realize that I see his difficulties as being a reflection of <br/>
ME.  I&#39;m sure people would say, WOW...you homeschool and your kids <br/>
can&#39;t even write!!  I feel fairly confident in all other areas but <br/>
writing and spelling are really hard for me.  I think just because it <br/>
is VERY obvious when someone cannot write or spell simple words <br/>
correctly.  I am beginning to DREAD situations where we will be <br/>
around non unschooling families and I don&#39;t want to feel like that.  <br/>
How do I gain the confidence and help my son be OK with his current <br/>
abilities in situations like the one above?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You could turn this around in your own head. What you&#39;re doing is  <br/>
protecting your son from the kind of damage that is so OFTEN done,  <br/>
especially to young boys, by pushing reading and writing on them when  <br/>
they are developmentally not quite ready.<br/>
<br/>
When it happens that something comes up like the signing of the card,  <br/>
be prepared to do what it takes to protect him from being embarrassed.  <br/>
Do it with confidence that YOU are doing the right thing, because you  <br/>
truly are! It might help if you read some of the literature about the  <br/>
effect of pushing early academics - David Elkind&#39;s &quot;Miseducation&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;The Hurried Child&quot; might be helpful to you.<br/>
<br/>
Be proud of yourself for being the mom who has the insight AND the  <br/>
gumption to protect her son in spite of societal pressures.<br/>
<br/>
As far as helping your son, changing your own attitude will almost  <br/>
certainly rub off on him. Also, be sure that he has an answer for  <br/>
situations in which someone actually says out loud to him, &quot;You write  <br/>
like a baby,&quot; or something like that, if that is a possibility. He can  <br/>
say, &quot;I don&#39;t write well yet, but I can ...... really well.&quot; And, for  <br/>
his own sake, if there are comparisons being made with cousins, be  <br/>
sure he is aware of what he does and knows that his cousins don&#39;t.<br/>

I also realize that I see his difficulties as being a reflection of <br/>
ME.  I&#39;m sure people would say, WOW...you homeschool and your kids <br/>
can&#39;t even write!!  <br/>
=====<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My son went to school from the time he was three until halfway through <br/>
fourth grade, and he can&#39;t write.  He is 11 now, and when he does <br/>
attempt to write, his letters are huge, and most of the words are <br/>
misspelled.  However, with each attempt, he gets a little better.  <br/>
Instead of focussing on writing, I focus on the things he does really <br/>
well.  When we first started unschooling, some family members were <br/>
worried that his writing was not improving.  My response was along the <br/>
lines of &quot;If you are struggling with something, and you find it <br/>
difficult, do you want people to keep cajolling you, or would you <br/>
rather work it out in your own time without being pestered?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I made a big leap when I was able to come to the realization that my <br/>
kids are not me, and I am not my kids.  My self worth and identity has <br/>
to come from me, not from someone else.  After I was able to make that <br/>
mental shift, I was able to understand that my son&#39;s developmental time <br/>
table is his, and not mine.  It did take a while for me to arrive at a <br/>
point where I was comfortable with that idea.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===<br/>
How do I gain the confidence and help my son be OK with his current <br/>
abilities in situations like the one above?  <br/>
===<br/>
<br/>
Confidence is generally something that comes over time through <br/>
experience.  Continue to focus your thoughts on the things he does <br/>
well, rather than dwelling on what he can&#39;t do, yet.  Continue to help <br/>
him when he asks for it.  Although, over time the help you provide in <br/>
public may become more discrete, such as using your finger to write a <br/>
letter in the palm of his hand, rather than up in the air.  <br/>
<br/>
As he has more need of writing, he will use it more, and eventually, he <br/>
will stop coming to you for help.  Believe it or not, one day you will <br/>
miss all this.  You will try to look back, and you will not be able to <br/>
remember the last time he asked you how to spell a word.  <br/>
<br/>
We often celebrate and glorify the first time a child does something, <br/>
but we somehow miss all the lasts.  Now, I am sad, because I can&#39;t <br/>
remember the last time Toby held my hand to cross the street; I can&#39;t <br/>
remember the last time he sat in my lap; and I can&#39;t remember the last <br/>
time he asked me to read something for him.<br/>

Holly can type wonderfully well.  She speaks well.  She reads well.   <br/>
She doesn&#39;t have good handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
Last night she was at an &quot;interview&quot; for Zumiez.  It was after the  <br/>
store closed, and there were 13 applicants, and three employees  <br/>
conducting the proceedings.  There were group activities, relay  <br/>
races, contests, group projects...  And then there was a written  <br/>
thing, that I&#39;m sure the store didn&#39;t even think about.  They had to  <br/>
write down five questions, leaving room for answers, and then answer  <br/>
them in writing.  Holly ended up in tears, and the manager took her  <br/>
off for a little walk.  Holly said something like &quot;I had been excited  <br/>
that it was an interview, in person, and now THIS&quot; and held up the  <br/>
pen and paper.   He talked to her a bit about not worrying so much  <br/>
what people thought, and maybe about other things on the paper (I&#39;m  <br/>
not sure), because she had only finished three out of five, and told  <br/>
her to call him at 10:00 in the morning, and she could go on.  The  <br/>
other twelve kids were being addressed as a group as she left, still  <br/>
a little teary.<br/>
<br/>
Marty, Brett and I were waiting for her at a restaurant nearby,  <br/>
following a party which will be documented on my blog if and when I  <br/>
ever finish the day&#39;s e-mail. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As she told us about the evening, it sounded like she had done really  <br/>
well.  They seem to have been trying to see which kids had leadership  <br/>
and charisma, physical abilities (crab-walking relays) and verbal and  <br/>
persuasive ability (making advertisements and raps/chants and  <br/>
infomercials, in groups).  Holly kind of acted out for us how some of  <br/>
the kids couldn&#39;t even say their own names clearly with confidence.<br/>
<br/>
She was very unhappy about the writing.  It&#39;s possible that the   <br/>
manager thought that because she didn&#39;t write well she also couldn&#39;t  <br/>
read well, because when she did call this morning (at 10:05, not  <br/>
10:00, which is why I was so cranky, though there&#39;s a little more to  <br/>
it than just that) he told her what all she needed to do to finalize  <br/>
the hiring (didn&#39;t surprise me at all that the would offer her a job,  <br/>
and I don&#39;t know how many from the group they might&#39;ve chosen; she&#39;ll  <br/>
find out later, I guess), he said the quiz on the handbook was very  <br/>
important, so she should read it very carefully.  She did.  But the  <br/>
way she repeated that to me, I think he thought she might be  <br/>
generally slow in &quot;reading and writing.&quot;  Had their questions been  <br/>
done with keyboards, Holly would&#39;ve been the first one through and  <br/>
could&#39;ve made a moving gif to illustrate it all! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess he&#39;ll relieved to learn she can read fine, and use a computer  <br/>
wonderfully well.<br/>
<br/>
But yes, the writing slowed her down.  She&#39;s not fast.  Her letters  <br/>
aren&#39;t always &quot;made right.&quot;  She knows all it would take is  <br/>
practice.  Kirby got practice when he taught karate and had to fill  <br/>
in judging forms, and then when he worked phones and drive through at  <br/>
a busy pizza place and others had to read his handwriting.   Marty  <br/>
does miniature block printing that&#39;s  pretty legible.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Margaux has great confindence in her own writing abilities, even when<br/>
she&#39;s wrong about the letters.  Chamille wants it perfect, so when it<br/>
doesn&#39;t come out perfect, she lacks the confidence to manually write.<br/>
<br/>
When we were doing the haunted house production, each day, we had to<br/>
sign in.  The first day, I handed Chamille the pencil and she wavered<br/>
and questioned herself and lost all confidence to write even her own<br/>
name.  So after that, I just signed us both in together.<br/>
<br/>
She rarely manually writes.  She types very fast, faster than me.  The<br/>
letters never come out wrong and she&#39;s able to focus more attention on<br/>
the content of her writing and how she spells things.  She surprised<br/>
herself the other day when she had to manually write out a phone number<br/>
and half the numbers were reversed.  It truly bothered her, and she<br/>
corrected them.  She said something about how if she were typing it,<br/>
that never would&#39;ve happened.<br/>
<br/>
She has really cute handwriting too, just no confidence in her<br/>
handwriting skills, largely because she&#39;s looking for perfection and<br/>
there&#39;s no such thing in handwriting.  In a year, she&#39;s wanting to start<br/>
applying for jobs, so somewhere between now and then, she&#39;ll need to<br/>
have more confidence in her ability to write what she needs to write. <br/>
Sometimes you can take applications home and fill them out, so that will<br/>
help.</div>
