Me too.  My 7 yr old, 8 in Feb.  is not reading.  Can sound out a few 3<br/>
letter<br/>
words, but that&#39;s it.  While all the other kids his age in our group are<br/>
reading chapter books.  Ugh!  I&#39;m just trying to be quite, and not think<br/>
about<br/>
it if he is fine with it.<br/>

John, your son sounds perfectly normal to me. Isn&#39;t 8-12 the average for<br/>
boys to start reading if left to do it naturally?<br/>
<br/>
My 2nd daughter is 8-1/2 and is reading only haltingly. She is absolutely<br/>
determined to read Harry Potter (which we already read aloud...we are really<br/>
behind the times...we&#39;re only on the 2nd book now). She sits there every day<br/>
and slowly but surely reads that book. She&#39;s so proud when she finishes a<br/>
chapter. Must be a pain to be the younger sister of a book devourer. But I<br/>
know she&#39;s going at her natural pace so I try to tell her not to worry about<br/>
it that she isn&#39;t as fast as others her age. At least she won&#39;t develop a<br/>
fear or hatred of reading.<br/>

Hi,<br/>
 I am new to this list and had to jump in here. I am<br/>
SO glad to know that I am not the only one with a late<br/>
reader. My middle son will be 8 in Dec. and is still<br/>
struggling to read. He can read the first couple Bob<br/>
books and that is about it.<br/>
 Today he knows his alphabet and sounds, tomorrow he<br/>
doesn&#39;t. It is so fustrating because he is so advanced<br/>
in just about everything he does except reading.</div>
