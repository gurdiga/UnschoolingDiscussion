&gt; &gt;Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn&#39;t spank our children when they<br/>

<br/>
I may be in the minority among Christians, but I don&#39;t want anyone teaching my kids religious beliefs in school either.  It could never work.  You would have to include everything from every faith to make it fair.  That&#39;s not what they&#39;re there for.  Families must take the responsiblility to raise their own, each according to their personal beliefs.  We teach our own and also allow trusted Sunday school teachers etc at our church to teach them.  Parents have given up on molding and training their kids and just expect the school or the gov&#39;t to  take care of it.  Which is probably why this country is such a mess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039659569">Certainly not blaming TV or music for the actions of children. But, I do<br/>
hold &quot;PARENTS&quot; accountable for training their children in the way they are<br/>
to go (Proverbs 22:6)<br/>
As the saying goes &quot; garbage in, garbage out&quot;<br/>
Yes, we all have the &quot;right&quot; to privacy, but what we do in private is who we<br/>
truely are, and will become..<br/>
Futhermore, don&#39;t take my word, but the word of God (Leviticus 11:44)<br/>
Before knowing Christ as my savior, when I would look in the mirror, I saw a<br/>
good person. But the Bible says that the heart of man is desperately wicked.<br/>
So I guess I not to good after all. Know when I look in the mirror, I see<br/>
the blood of Jesus covering all my sin that I have committed against him (1<br/>
John 1:9)<br/>
These are not my opinions, these are the words of God, and if we do take a<br/>
closer look at the true God of the Bible, we will either praise him for what<br/>
he has done on our account, or we will seek a god that pleases our own<br/>
feelings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-263381352">Well Ann, if you don&#39;t believe in God, I&#39;m sorry to hear that. <br/>
But it does have everything to do with God, in fact everything in life has<br/>
to do with God. <br/>
God has created the whole universe and everything on this planet (Genesis<br/>
1:1, Genesis 1:26)<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in the christian god either, he let me down when as a small<br/>
child I did believe in him, he lets hundreds of children down each day, if<br/>
he was all powerful why does he allow children to die and suffer at the<br/>
hands of abusers?   At the age of five after having a cigarette stubbed out<br/>
in the palm of my hand by a &quot;gentleman&quot; who loved quoting the bible, and<br/>
after being beaten for being stupid and falling off a swing and splitting<br/>
my head open, after having it stitched with no anesthetic, then being sent<br/>
to bed with no food and blood all through my hair.  These were just two of<br/>
the too many incidents which told me that either I was a worthless nothing<br/>
who god cared nothing for or god didn&#39;t exist.  I chose the latter.<br/>
<br/>
My God is Mother Nature in all Her beauty, I am in my church when alone or<br/>
in good company out in a natural area, my hymes are the sounds of birds<br/>
singing, and a creek flowing over rocks.<br/>
<br/>
If you choose to believe in your God, that&#39;s fine with me, but I will not<br/>
believe that I am going to hell because I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
There are good and bad people in all religions, of all colors etc, if there<br/>
was some kind of judgement day I don&#39;t believe that we will be granted<br/>
access to Heaven, Nivarna or whatever because we believed in god, but by<br/>
our actions on this planet.</div>

It has the audacity to infer that all who attend puclic schools are<br/>

What rot!<br/>
<br/>
Part of the reason my children were removed from the Public system<br/>

<br/>
While there is nothing wrong per se with Xtian values they are not mine.<br/>
The school being *public* and by law being required to embrace all<br/>
creeds, races and styles of families, have no right to portray one<br/>

How a person is raised (responsibly, with a sense of integrity and<br/>

Yes the post did go a little far in what has happened, these were not my thoughts but what was e-mailed to me, but it showed what has happened in our school system since prayer was taken out.  I didn&#39;t want this to be taken extreme seriousness that is was.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that our school system should teach a specific faith but that there are many faiths and the basic ideas of them.  I was brought up Christian and was never exposed, mostly because of where I lived, that there were many different faiths besides Christian.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-995580231">I just have to asked, as a buddhist, don&#39;t you pray? It did not say<br/>
anything about a specific religion, it was about taking away the right to<br/>
believe in whatever God or Gods we choose. I am not a religious person,<br/>
but I am spiritual, I believe in many things from many religions, and I<br/>
still think it wrong to take away a persons right to pray. I took my<br/>
children out of public school because they valued money and<br/>
accomplishment more than the person and I do not want my children to feel<br/>
that material things are more valueable than human beings. I don&#39;t think<br/>
anyone who knew me could say I was a religious fanatic or only embraced<br/>
one way of belief, my oldest daughter practices Wicca, my youngest<br/>
daughter is a Luteren, my mother in law is a Catholic and my mother is a<br/>
reincarnationist, I believe that every faith and belief has an element of<br/>
truth in it or there would not be so many people who believed. However I<br/>
agree with the basic principal this is trying to get across, if you take<br/>
the parents and faith away how can you offer a child a balanced<br/>
upbringing, instead of seeing one thing that you disagree with and making<br/>
an issue try to see the entire overview, I have reread it and still do<br/>
not see anywhere that is says anything about Xtian beliefs or morals, am<br/>
I missing something? And I personally have a big problem with child<br/>
pornography and would hope that every parent would. Personally I also<br/>
think thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbor<br/>
as yourself., is a pretty good moral foundation for any religion and if<br/>
you look probably appears in one form or another in any religion you can<br/>
name. And that is MY OPIONION,<br/>

The whole thing with public schools and institutionalised schools it that<br/>
when you try and make it &quot;fair&quot; to everyone no one&#39;s needs get met.  What<br/>
about those who are atheists or agnostics? I also think it is important to<br/>
appreciate our cultural and religious differences how many schools teach<br/>
that appreciation?Those schools that do that I know of a few rare inner city<br/>
schools. Still Unschooling is about learning to respect our children&#39;s<br/>
differences and not coercing them. Some schools may try but most are not<br/>
allowed for fear of insulting someone. Up here they do only Christian and<br/>
once in a rare while a Jewish thing but no other religions or world cultures<br/>
are appreciated. The whole thing about ps schools in America historically it<br/>
was founded by the Christians who wanted to indoctronate people like the<br/>
Native Americans into their way of thinking. So now of course the moral<br/>
majority can yell and all about it but there really is no way to honor<br/>
everyone&#39;s traditions without learning how to be open minded and not<br/>
offended by those differences. Who is teaching that value? That is why I am<br/>
so alone up here and looking for support. Most of the homeschooling groups<br/>
are Christian and NOT unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-566755874">Brynn, I was just about to post something along the lines of &#39;lumping not smacking children in with not having the Bible in schools and child pornography is rather ridiculous,&#39; but you&#39;ve said the whole thing so well I won&#39;t bother.  Oh, sorry, I just did :-)  I don&#39;t think this is a great idea at all.  I think the great idea would be to not leave so much in the hands of &#39;experts,&#39; particularly in the &#39;education&#39; department, isn&#39;t that one of the reasons we&#39;re unschoolers, and on this list?  I&#39;m not sure whether the Bible should be in schools or not, but if it is then all other major religious works should be too.  I&#39;m not sure whether porn should be on the internet or not, and since on the few occasions I&#39;ve landed on such sites, there have been big signs saying &#39;over 18&#39;s only,&#39; etc all over them, I think it&#39;s about as dangerous as the top-shelf magazines and those aren&#39;t banned, so whaddya do?  Child pornography is a whole other ballgame, of course.  Dr Spock was reportedly outraged at being branded permissive, and according to Deborah Jackson in Three in a Bed, there is little in Dr Spock&#39;s babycare manual that could be seen as such.<br/>
<br/>
There is serious bigotry going on here, and I&#39;ve seen folks thrown off other lists for less.  The original post does mention the Bible, and that alone (apart from the rest) gives it a Christian bias.  Keith&#39;s God is not mine, nor many others, and that has been shown.  Institutionalised school is exactly that, intitutionalising the children it processes into whatever culture is in control of the school.  The whole thing has an Ezzo-ish reek to me, the bit about teachers not disciplining children, users of the English language should be ashamed of the use of discipline in this way, I thought a disciple was a follower, in Christian terms, one of the select followers of Jesus, so did Jesus &#39;discipline&#39; them?  No, if you believe the teachings (I don&#39;t believe that he is any more a part of the force of the world known as God than any other human, but I think he existed and taught, and was a charismatic and strong spiritual leader, that&#39;s my slant on it :-) ) he led by example, both in his actions and his words.  I can&#39;t think of a better way of disciplining anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Ya know what, the best idea is if people think about what they&#39;re saying before they post these rants, even if they didn&#39;t write them.  And those who have strong views on any subject can learn to present those views without assuming that everyone else holds those views, or should hold those views.  <br/>

&gt; Certainly not blaming TV or music for the actions of children. But, I do<br/>
&gt; hold &quot;PARENTS&quot; accountable for training their children in the way they are<br/>
&gt; to go (Proverbs 22:6)<br/>
&gt; As the saying goes &quot; garbage in, garbage out&quot;<br/>
&gt; Yes, we all have the &quot;right&quot; to privacy, but what we do in private is who we<br/>
&gt; truely are, and will become..<br/>
&gt; Futhermore, don&#39;t take my word, but the word of God (Leviticus 11:44)<br/>
&gt; Before knowing Christ as my savior, when I would look in the mirror, I saw a<br/>
&gt; good person. But the Bible says that the heart of man is desperately wicked.<br/>
&gt; So I guess I not to good after all. Know when I look in the mirror, I see<br/>
&gt; the blood of Jesus covering all my sin that I have committed against him (1<br/>
&gt; John 1:9)<br/>
&gt; These are not my opinions, these are the words of God, and if we do take a<br/>
&gt; closer look at the true God of the Bible, we will either praise him for what<br/>
&gt; he has done on our account, or we will seek a god that pleases our own<br/>
&gt; feelings.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Keith<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With all due respect Keith....your words and your G-d mean absolutely<br/>
nothing to me.<br/>
I take no gods word for anything.Their existence in the Universe is just<br/>
one more form on the path between the here and now, and Nirvana.<br/>
I won&#39;t go into it further on the list but your words of Biblical<br/>
references only ring true for Xtians.<br/>
While I respect the values of many Xtians I due not recognize your<br/>
doctrines.<br/>
How would you feel if I came on here quoting rom the Diamond or Lotus<br/>
Sutras or the most revered Dhammapada telling you you had to listen and<br/>
take heed of them.<br/>
You&#39;d probably feel insulted or angry and feel that I was<br/>
prosletizing(sp?).<br/>
<br/>
I agree that parents are responsible to a large degree for how their<br/>
children turn out but there are also many external forces that influence<br/>
the final *out come* as well.<br/>
There are also the occaisional *bad seeds) that no matter how good a job<br/>
a parent does, the out come may not be as nice/satisfying as we&#39;d hoped<br/>
for. <br/>

nothing but illusion.......<br/>
That comes from the teachings I believe in.<br/>
<br/>
But you feel free to believe what you want to. That is your right. I<br/>
want you and everyone to have that right.<br/>

Just don&#39;t force your views on me and expect me to accept them on your<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325698861">Perhaps the problem is we seem to have so many differences that we have<br/>
trouble seeing the similarities, I suppose if the definition of praying<br/>
is asking for forgiveness than I do not pray either, I see it as a way to<br/>
communicate with a spirit world far greater than I am. The first and most<br/>
important thing I believe is do no harm, by failing to do harm you<br/>
indirectly do good. I did not protest the removal of prayer, forcing<br/>
someone to pray is as wrong as forbiding them to pray, I protest the<br/>
removal of the right to pray or not as you choose. I think that even<br/>
people who do not believe in the traditional christian God believe in<br/>
something greater than themselves, Atheist believe that there is no God,<br/>
it is still a valid belief, I do not have to agree with it, just<br/>
acknowledge their right to believe it. I want to teach my children to<br/>
care about something greater than themselves, the world, other people, no<br/>
one person should be more important than the whole of humankind. We have<br/>
a common goal, to teach our children without all the hatred and prejudice<br/>
that is rampant in the schools, that does not mean that everyone who<br/>
attends a public school is full of hatred, but they have much more of it<br/>
to deal with than the children who are blessed with parents who can<br/>
school them at home. I just think a little tolerence and understanding is<br/>
in order, many of us have no other support except this list and a few<br/>
others similar to it, I do not and I depend on all of you to keep me<br/>
centered and on track. Because I do not attend a church and practice the<br/>
faith that is popular I am excluded from the homeschool groups locally<br/>
available to me, I personally need the contact and support of other<br/>
people who are trying to do the same thing I am, raise and educate my<br/>
children to be the best they can be and hopefully make a postive<br/>
difference in the world while they are in it. And I respect everyone&#39;s<br/>
right to an opionion, even if it is different than mine.<br/>

&gt; I just have to asked, as a buddhist, don&#39;t you pray? It did not say<br/>
&gt; anything about a specific religion, it was about taking away the right to<br/>
&gt; believe in whatever God or Gods we choose. I am not a religious person,<br/>
&gt; but I am spiritual, I believe in many things from many religions, and I<br/>
&gt; still think it wrong to take away a persons right to pray. I took my<br/>
&gt; children out of public school because they valued money and<br/>
&gt; accomplishment more than the person and I do not want my children to feel<br/>
&gt; that material things are more valueable than human beings. I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; anyone who knew me could say I was a religious fanatic or only embraced<br/>
&gt; one way of belief, my oldest daughter practices Wicca, my youngest<br/>
&gt; daughter is a Luteren, my mother in law is a Catholic and my mother is a<br/>
&gt; reincarnationist, I believe that every faith and belief has an element of<br/>
&gt; truth in it or there would not be so many people who believed. However I<br/>
&gt; agree with the basic principal this is trying to get across, if you take<br/>
&gt; the parents and faith away how can you offer a child a balanced<br/>
&gt; upbringing, instead of seeing one thing that you disagree with and making<br/>
&gt; an issue try to see the entire overview, I have reread it and still do<br/>
&gt; not see anywhere that is says anything about Xtian beliefs or morals, am<br/>
&gt; I missing something? And I personally have a big problem with child<br/>
&gt; pornography and would hope that every parent would. Personally I also<br/>
&gt; think thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbor<br/>

<br/>
Image 1  The Rain of Confusion: After the Fall, God did not banish Satan from<br/>
heaven, but put him to work in His private library.  Unable to control his<br/>
mischievous bent, Satan is here portrayed opening the library window and<br/>
scattering various holy books among the people of the earth to see what bedlam he<br/>
can cause.  Out of the clouds of heaven thus comes the rain of confusion.<br/>
<br/>
Image 2  The Tower of Biblio:  Provided new insight by God Himself, the peoples of<br/>
the earth recognize their confusion and decide to unite together to build a Tower<br/>
of Biblio.  The Tower is planned to reach into the highest reaches of God&#39;s<br/>
library where they can together access the single exalted Book of Love, the<br/>
highest Law, written in a language that all can understand.  But, as the picture<br/>
depicts, even as the Tower is being built, the devil&#39;s librarians on earth, the<br/>
keepers of the holy books, are tearing out the foundations so that the Tower will<br/>
crumble.  Once the Tower falls, the librarians will spread the tale that it is God<br/>
Himself who has sown such great confusion.<br/>
<br/>
Image 3  The Annunciation:  But then the Great Lord, seeing what had been done in<br/>
his Name, spoke:  �What need you towers or knowledge of my books, O my people?<br/>
For I have implanted my law, the Law of Love, in each of your hearts, in each, so<br/>
that each of you shall know Me, and find Me, every one of you, even the children<br/>
among you, each in your own way.� And Satan and his priests trembled, for the<br/>
people praised the Lord, each in her own language and every one in his own song,<br/>
in a harmony of many voices together that had never before been heard on earth or<br/>
in the heavens.<br/>

certainly don&#39;t want religious instruction or prayers brought back in NZ and<br/>

don&#39;t want to have their kids suffer through prayers and Bible study either.<br/>

prayers back into schools would help any of that. And then, would you have a<br/>
federal homeschooling law introduced to make sure that homeschooling parents<br/>
were saying the appropriate prayers each day? Because if you let those<br/>
homeschoolers get away without praying, then heck, they&#39;ll be out there<br/>
selling pornography, and murdering babies, and killing and stealing and .....<br/>
So better get a law controlling those homeschoolers don&#39;t ya know - some of<br/>
them are Buddhists, Muslims, Wiccan and even - gasp - atheists of the<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just think a little tolerence and understanding is<br/>
&gt; in order, many of us have no other support except this list and a few<br/>
&gt; others similar to it, I do not and I depend on all of you to keep me<br/>
&gt; centered and on track. Because I do not attend a church and practice the<br/>
&gt; faith that is popular I am excluded from the homeschool groups locally<br/>
&gt; available to me, I personally need the contact and support of other<br/>
&gt; people who are trying to do the same thing I am, raise and educate my<br/>
&gt; children to be the best they can be and hopefully make a postive<br/>
&gt; difference in the world while they are in it. And I respect everyone&#39;s<br/>
&gt; right to an opionion, even if it is different than mine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;d say the same words about myself, but I&#39;m not sure they&#39;d *mean* the<br/>
same thing &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855460176">I have a great idea: why don&#39;t we just ignore Keith and talk about<br/>
something else?  He obviously doesn&#39;t know his bible history or he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be quoting it so often.  <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s talk about a great Christian (and Jewish and Buddhist and<br/>
Catholic...) ideal: simple living.  Any families out there choosing to<br/>
live a simple life? I&#39;d love to hear your views and stories about why and<br/>
how you&#39;ve chosen a simple life and how does that fit in with<br/>
un-schooling?  For me, simple living has meant learning how to buy things<br/>
cheaply, un-cluttering my house, turning off the TV (except<br/>
 for &quot;Law and Order&quot;), keeping my 12 year old Honda, paying off my credit<br/>
card ea ch month (except December -- still don&#39;t have that most Christian<br/>
of holidays under control :), and homeschooling my child.  Of course, I&#39;m<br/>
still prone to impluse buying, a messy house, watching re-runs of<br/>
&quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Drew Carey&quot;, wanting to own a mini-van, and (on the bad<br/>
days) figuring out which pre-school/day care to send my 4 year old.<br/>

PS Bravo to Betsy Wright&#39;s opinion on teaching religion in school. Its<br/>
very similiar to the argument against teaching the arts in the schools.<br/>
We&#39;ve had a great dabate here in Chicago about integrating the arts into<br/>
school curriculums.  It sounds like such an ideal thing, but after<br/>
actually teaching dance in the ps, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that I<br/>
DON&#39;T want dance taught in the ps.  I don&#39;t want the schools to do for<br/>
dance (and the arts) what they&#39;ve done for science and math and reading<br/>
and...  (Kids who participate in dance now love it BECAUSE its something<br/>
you do outside of school.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-641570546">I would like to comment on this statement,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I&#39;m in New Zealand. But I have to comment. No one took away the<br/>
right to pray did they? They just said it wasn&#39;t to be done in schools as<br/>
a<br/>
shared activity? People can still pray can&#39;t they? Even at school, I&#39;m<br/>
sure<br/>
that good little xtians could go have a quiet pray in the lunch break?  I<br/>
certainly don&#39;t want religious instruction or prayers brought back in NZ<br/>
and<br/>
I&#39;m sure that there are American atheists, Jews, Buddhists, Muslims......<br/>
who<br/>
don&#39;t want to have their kids suffer through prayers and Bible study<br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My nephew was suspended from 3rd grade for saying &quot;God is great, God is<br/>
good and we thank him for our food&quot; in the school cafeteria, it was not<br/>
about public praying for me, it was about the right to practice or not<br/>
practice my religion without being punished for it. I had hoped this list<br/>
would keep me in touch with other homeschooling families and make me feel<br/>
less cut off because of my religious beliefs or lack of them, but so far<br/>
I feel attacked and unwanted, I am seriously questionling if I want to<br/>
participate in a list where everyone is so busy attacking that no one can<br/>
listen and care anymore.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s lots of caring and listening on this list, but occasionally you<br/>
might need to wade through a bit of garbage. It helps to just delete those<br/>
posts and look for the good ones. Opinions expressed by some posters do not<br/>
necessarily constitute the opinions of the majority.<br/>
<br/>
So, Sharon... how many kids ya got? How old? How long have you been<br/>
unschooling? Or homeschooling?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057263914">Okay, Sharon, obviously I was wrong and I apologise. My understanding from<br/>
what I have read is obviously different from your nephew&#39;s reality.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My nephew was suspended from 3rd grade for saying &quot;God is great, God is<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hope you won&#39;t leave the list. I guess I am over sensitive after 13 years<br/>
of homeschooling, and 13 years of being told my evil humanist presence and<br/>
that of my children was not wanted at homeschooling events - even something<br/>
as innocuous as a guided tour of a factory, where there were no socialisation<br/>
opportunities for our family to grab and drag a christian family off to hell.<br/>
Our kids have been specifically excluded from sports days. I guess they think<br/>
we will cheat. Then there was the group that, when asked if they were open to<br/>
non-christians expressed complete bewilderment &#39;But why would a non-christian<br/>
want to homeschool?&#39;. Then, &#39;well you can join in, but not until we have<br/>
drawn up behaviour guidelines and got your family to sign agreement to them -<br/>
we haven&#39;t  written up any before, because we hadn&#39;t needed to as everyone in<br/>
our group is christian, so they all know how to behave properly.&#39;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Like I say, I hope you won&#39;t leave the list, because I do know what it is<br/>
like to be attacked for my beliefs. I know the grief of trying to explain to<br/>
a bereft child why they were allowed to play at their friend&#39;s place, when a<br/>
return invitation was refused on the grounds that our home was not a suitable<br/>
place for the friend to go near. I know what a child&#39;s grief is like after<br/>
his best friend of 4 years is suddenly not allowed to have anything to do<br/>
with him, because mom has been to a new church.<br/>
<br/>
All I am asking is that people don&#39;t make assumptions about my beliefs, nor<br/>
assume that because I am an atheist, I am necessarily a selfish person who<br/>
cares only for their own feelings - and yes, I know that was Keith, not you,<br/>
Sharon.<br/>
<br/>
I apologise for making you feel attacked. I hope you understand that it comes<br/>
from a feeling of my beliefs not being understood, and attacked - yet again.<br/>
