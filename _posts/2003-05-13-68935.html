<h4>Have A Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>13 May 2003, at  1:32pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-86994923">I was talking to my 11 year old daughter about school.  She was the one who just HAD to go back to school.<br/>
She was planning on going back for 6th grade.<br/>
<br/>
She has *totally* changed her mind.  In fact, when i asked about it, she turned her nose up and said &quot;no way, I like having all this freedom to do what *I* want to do&quot;. LOLOLOL.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, she is now interested in designing house plans to sell, and building her own home, much like Heather (peas and carrots farm).  She is also planning her own flower garden and she&#39;ll probably enjoy canning with me this year. I&#39;ve suggested she try visiting Peas and Carrots farm and see what its like there.  She would like to do that, but she wants me to come along.  I don&#39;t mind doing that, but I have to work it out somehow with the other family stuff. <br/>
<br/>
We got to talking about how the schools could be better and we talked about how abolishing Compulsary Attendance laws (not necessarily schools)  would do the most good, by making schools a resource more like libraries.  That way kids could come and go as they need and they could really utilize what the schools have to offer without being forced to be there all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Now she is writing a letter to both the President and the Governor about how kids in schools should have freedom and why.  I just love it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-221733101">My girl and I thought it would be great if schools would offer all <br/>
their cool extracurricular stuff, like chess club, drama, band, etc. <br/>
without the mandatory classes....although, having someone available <br/>
to discuss books or teach a tough concept in math...that&#39;d be good!<br/>
<br/>
imagine what could happen if kids had real work to do, that meant <br/>
something real in their lives, daily contributing to something <br/>
important to them. America would be an entirely different place.<br/>
