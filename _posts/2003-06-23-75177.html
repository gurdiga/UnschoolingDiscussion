Depends on the subject.  It changes.  <br/>

Rhonda responds:<br/>
(In the context of the statement: If rank exist on this list, and one has <br/>
been deemed unworthy of being an authority, then...)<br/>
=&#92;=You don&#39;t post, or you <br/>
post only when you openly acknowledge that you remember you are not an <br/>

<br/>
Sandra writes:<br/>
I don&#39;t post when I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about.<br/>
When I&#39;m not sure I say &quot;I&#39;m not sure&quot; or &quot;I could be wrong&quot; or &quot;I think.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda states:<br/>
Several posters have done the same or used &quot;IMO&quot; or &quot;IMHO&quot; also. Regardless <br/>
of which adage is used, all of them qualify the post.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra writes:<br/>
If I&#39;m citing sources, I name them.<br/>
Those aren&#39;t things pertaining just to this list but to ANY public <br/>
communcations.  People who are used to communicating in public get used to <br/>
qualifying <br/>
their statements and in being prepared to back up what they say somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda responds:<br/>
Those are wonderful skills. But not everyone requires such documentation. If <br/>
I feel the need to do so when communicating, I do. If I don&#39;t and someone <br/>
wants said sources, I would either quote the sources if possible or send them to <br/>
where they coud find them. <br/>
<br/>
Rhonda writes:<br/>
(Once again in the context that if rank exists on this list, with only <br/>
particular members having a voice, then...)<br/>
-=-But what if, I mean just what if, someone out there in Unschooling-dotcom <br/>
land reads the authority figures stance, and not only disagrees, but is <br/>
positive they are in fact far more knowledgable?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sandra writes:<br/>
You show your knowledge by saying sensible things you can back up.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda responds:<br/>
But since &quot;sensible&quot; by definition, requires perception, that could differ <br/>
from individual to individual.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda writes:<br/>
-=-Or would that fall under, they <br/>
aren&#39;t on the ranking list, so they shouldn&#39;t bother posting said knowledge, <br/>
because there may be dissention in the ranks?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sandra writes:<br/>
If it&#39;s knowledge, qualified and backed up, why would there be dissent?<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda responds:<br/>
Dissention could only happen if there is in fact rank on this list. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra writes:<br/>
It it&#39;s just wishful thinking and arguing for the sake of arguing, that&#39;s not <br/>
<br/>
about knowledge.  <br/>
<br/>
Rhonda responds:<br/>
Agreed. Who here is doing that? I&#39;m questioning and arguing for the sake of <br/>
gaining knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda writes:<br/>
-=-  Reprimandining anyone on the list for their interpretations and <br/>
perspectives seems to be a far greater disservice to the list as a whole, <br/>
because it says only certain people are worthy of being heard.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sandra writes:<br/>
It&#39;s not about who said what, it&#39;s about what was said.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda responds:<br/>
It should be...<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda writes:<br/>
(in the context of questioning the statement:   &quot;The whole point is rank <br/>
exists. Others tried to deny it and then claim it has nothing to do with instinct <br/>
or nature.&quot; Sorry I don&#39;t remember who said it.)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So does all existance automatically qualify as natural or instinctive or <br/>
&gt; both? Hence, my cell phone exist, so is it natural? It is composed of <br/>
&gt; materials <br/>
&gt; created by man utilizing natural matter.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra writes:<br/>
I could name many groups, times and cultures without cell phones.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda responds:<br/>
Huh? Was this humor, because I&#39;m not sure if what I wrote was misunderstood, <br/>
or if this was meant to be funny. If I lacked clarity, let me know and I&#39;ll <br/>
try again.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra writes:<br/>
No one successfully brought a single example of a human group without a <br/>
hierarchy.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda responds:<br/>
I never stated that I knew of such a group, only that I believe it is <br/>
possible. Someone here did post a site regarding the research in anarchy and <br/>
libertarianism, I thought, but I could be wrong. Since I often visit those sites <br/>
anyway, I didn&#39;t need to look them up.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda writes:<br/>
&lt;&lt;Depends on ones perspectives. And just because it may not be easily <br/>
understood by some, that the possibility exists that this argument could in <br/>
fact be made that my cell phone is natural, by maintaining it&#39;s existance thru <br/>
natural <br/>
means, that lack of understanding does not disqualify that argument.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra writes:<br/>
If people say your argument isn&#39;t a parallel that means they just don&#39;t <br/>
understand it?<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda responds:<br/>
That&#39;s not what I said, nor intended. I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ll clarify. If a person <br/>
does not understand a concept, that in no way disqualifies the concept itself. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra writes:<br/>
Bad examples are as &quot;qualified&quot; as good arguments?<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda responds:<br/>
The example was simple, but to be bad it would have to have no foundation. <br/>
Otherwise, the questioning party may dislike the example, could possiby even <br/>
come up with a better one, but again that falls back under perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda writes:<br/>
(In the context of a response to....Doing a simple personality test is <br/>
one model that shows it is indeed natural and instinctual.)<br/>
&lt;&lt;So if one does a personality test and finds <br/>
their personailty to in fact be that of one who rejects the idea of <br/>
authority, then according to this argument, it would in fact be &quot;natural&quot; for <br/>
them, <br/>
therefore from their POV, it would be valid to reject such an idea. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra writes:<br/>
Rejecting the idea of authority is kinda like rejecting the idea that the <br/>
earth goes around the sun, or rejecting theideathatice is frozen water.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda responds:<br/>
No it isn&#39;t. I honestly do not understand what is so hard to grasp about the <br/>
concept that individuals perceive things differently. Again, I never said <br/>
authority, rank or  heirarchies do not exist. Rather the possibility for humans to <br/>
&quot;reject&quot; them as being an acceptable continuim, in which we must live, is a <br/>
vaild view. Often humans get so comfortable with the way things are, that they <br/>
begin to believe change is not necessary. If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it. <br/>
It&#39;s when they close their eyes to the possibilities that it may be broke and <br/>
should be fixed, that narrow-mindedness occurs. So it suprises me very much, that <br/>
on a list of free thinkers, there is disreguard for seeing other POV&#39;s. It&#39;s <br/>
not a matter of agreeing or disagreeing, right or wrong, but that alternative <br/>
thinking does exist (just as rank does). Everyones big picture will be <br/>
different. I would be shocked if my big picture mirrored anyone else on this planet. <br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean I should look at anothers big picture and disquailfy it. It <br/>
works for them. Again, take what you need and leave the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra writes:<br/>
If a wolf took a personality test and it showed that he &quot;rejects the idea <br/>
that wolves live in packs,&quot; or rejects the idea that there is alpha male <br/>
behavior <br/>
(and natural behavior toward an alpha male) would that mean he was a superior <br/>
<br/>
kind of wolf?  Or just maybe a delusional kind of wolf?  <br/>
<br/>
Rhonda responds:<br/>
Where does &quot;superiority&quot; come into play? If the wolf rejects the alpha male <br/>
idea, it only makes him a different wolf, not superior or delusional, just <br/>
different. He can choose to stay with the pack, he can choose to move on, <br/>
regardless of what he chooses to do, his rejection of the idea still exists.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that was the frame from which Richard Bach wrote Jonathan Livingston <br/>
Seagull. <br/>
<br/>
I apologize for the length of my post, but in order to be respond, I wanted <br/>
the context of the dialogue to be clear.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who is now going to research Richard Bach, a beautiful soul.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. To anyone I may have quoted and did not refer to by name, please accept <br/>
my sincerest apologies, it was not intentional.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought the same thing when I read the comment about &quot;sensible things&quot;  <br/>
Gosh, defining sensible would be more difficult than defining rank.  Even within <br/>
the confines of an unschooling population, &quot;sensible&quot; will vary widely.     <br/>
Some of us think it is sensible to style our hair and wear make-up every day, <br/>
and some of us think it is sensible to shampoo once a week and never wear <br/>
make-up.  Both of those extremes are perfectly acceptable, neither is &quot;better&quot; or <br/>
&quot;more right&quot;.    To some folks its sensible to pretend to be Kings and Queens.   <br/>
To some that is the most ridiculous thing they can imagine to do with thier <br/>
spare time.   My husband thinks restoring old  bicycles is sensible.  Landon <br/>
thinks collecting bullwhips is sensible.   I have no use for either, but I think <br/>
it is perfectly sensible to collect cake pans.  ( who knows, I MIGHT need to <br/>
bake a guitar cake one day).    Sensible shoes to me are not Birks, they are <br/>
Keds<br/>
<br/>
   And as far as &quot;backing something up&quot; you can find research, documentation <br/>
and resources to support just about anything.   There are far and away many  <br/>
more resources, studies, documentations, etc, supporting public schools, <br/>
spanking, and  conventional parenting methods than there are for unschooling.   Does <br/>
the fact that the supporting evidence exists make it the infallible truth?<br/>

There isn&#39;t really anything remotely controversial in what I just <br/>
wrote. It is a truism and too obvious to have to be said out loud &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Yet - there are people who might not like the implications or maybe <br/>
just don&#39;t like me or maybe just had a bad day and feel like being <br/>
contentious or maybe need some excitement in their lives and an email <br/>
debate suits them -- who knows what reasons people have - i sure don&#39;t <br/>
-- but there are people who could stretch what I said in that first <br/>
statement to mean that all people on the list would assess each other&#39;s <br/>
knowledge the same way and that that is wrong, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The list is lot more useful to a lot more people if people wouldn&#39;t do <br/>
that - wouldn&#39;t take extended extreme versions of what people say and <br/>
argue those nonpositions. It is a lot nicer more useful more fun more <br/>
interesting etc list ---- (sorry got tired of commas) - when people do <br/>
the opposite - look for points of AGREEMENT - try to understand how <br/>
someone else&#39;s post DOES make sense to you, don&#39;t reach for how it <br/>
doesn&#39;t. I&#39;m not saying everyone should pretend to agree all the time - <br/>

always do, their posts no longer inspire or edify, they annoy and <br/>
frustrate. Then the annoyed and frustrated respond with stuff that <br/>
further inflames tempers and things go from bad to worse.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to ask that everybody examine their own part in this <br/>
process and just stop it if they notice that they are contributing to <br/>
it.<br/>

If he rejects the idea of alpha, he CANNOT choose to stay with the pack; it&#39;s <br/>
run on a pack level. Rejecting it, he rejects the pack and would be killed.<br/>
<br/>
He wouldn&#39;t survive long without the pack---he&#39;s a pack animal. <br/>
<br/>
The idea of a wolf rejecting the pack IS delusional. Survival of the fittest. <br/>
