<br/>
Every single time?<br/>
<br/>
Your husband knows more about $5 than kids do, and those toys can last a long <br/>
time.  My kids got a TON of use out of fast-food toys.  Hours and hours of <br/>
playing, sorting, artwork (they loved the Wendy&#39;s camp stuff and art stuff), <br/>
and we still have *all* of it, in boxes, which occasionally come out.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is it acceptable to ask that the TV is off and everyone at the table<br/>
together for dinner?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most people would say absolutely so, and so if you want &quot;absolutely so,&quot; you <br/>
have that.  I would wonder whether the purpose was discipline or table <br/>
manners or what.  Or are you worried about what &quot;they&quot; would think if &quot;they&quot; <br/>
came over and found the kids eating at one table watching a video and the <br/>
parents sitting together being able to talk about adult stuff?  What do the <br/>
kids want to do? (Does it matter to you what the kids would prefer?)<br/>
<br/>
We have very rarely asked our kids specifically to come and sit.  Mostly when <br/>
there was company or someone had made a fancy meal that needed steak knives <br/>
(practicality), but the older they get, the more likely they are to WANT to <br/>
come and sit and eat with us.<br/>
<br/>
In my family when I was a kid, and in other houses I was familiar with, as <br/>
kids got older they found more and more excuses to get out of dinner, adn NOT <br/>
being there was the desirable thing.  I think it&#39;s very cool that my kids are <br/>
the other way, and have no aversion to sitting and hanging out with us.<br/>
<br/>
We have at least two and sometimes three tables set up at any one time (one <br/>
in the library which is often for games but sometimes for meals) and when <br/>
there are extra people, some might eat at the dining table and some in the <br/>
library (one room away--also off the kitchen).  Or if just a table big enough <br/>
for six or seven, the first six or seven who want to sit down might sit there <br/>
and the rest wander off elsewhere.  I&#39;ve never seen hurt feelings yet about <br/>
not getting a place.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow it&#39;s become smooth.<br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] question about saying yes<br/>
Date: Mon, Feb 4, 2002, 4:47 PM<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do folks handle saying yes or no about things that cost money?<br/>
<br/>
When the kids ask me to stop by McDonald&#39;s to buy their lunch is it OK to<br/>
say, &quot;no, because I don&#39;t want to spend $5-6 on lunch for two kids.&quot;?  I<br/>
have certainly said something like that to my dh when he suggests eating<br/>
out and I say that we really shouldn&#39;t spend the money.  (bc right now we<br/>
shouldn&#39;t)<br/>
<br/>
Is it acceptable to ask that the TV is off and everyone at the table<br/>
together for dinner?<br/>
<br/>
Reading this thread has made me realize that I have primarily been giving<br/>
my kids choices about stuff that isn&#39;t so important - the whole &quot;choose<br/>
your battles&quot; thing.  It makes sense to me to let them make real choices,<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
We have a monthly family budget that includes a fast food line item. If the<br/>
money&#39;s there, it&#39;s there, if it&#39;s not, it&#39;s not. Mostly, it&#39;s there. It<br/>
makes it easier because we put the budget together in advance, based on what<br/>
we can actually afford, so there&#39;s no on-the-spot morality to it. If the<br/>
girls began to feel seriously shorted in the fast-food department, we&#39;d<br/>
review the budget with them and figure out where some extra money could come<br/>
from, but so far they&#39;re fine with how it works.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s important to you that the family eat dinner together with the TV<br/>
off, you might ask yourself why. What do you gain from that? Why do you feel<br/>
that that&#39;s more right than watching TV during dinner?<br/>
<br/>
I am not a believer in the magic of family dinners. When I grew up, we had<br/>
such dinners, just as directed by all the parenting experts, and they were<br/>
torture sessions with my brother and I playing court jester to distract my<br/>
step-father from emotionally thrashing our other two siblings. It&#39;s no<br/>
wonder I was a thin child.<br/>
<br/>
The occasional family dinner we have now (very occasional, except when we<br/>
eat out, as the dining room table doubles as our shipping department and is<br/>
often unusable for more than two people at a time) is relaxed and happy and<br/>
nice, but that&#39;s because our family is relaxed and happy and nice, not<br/>
because there is something inherently marvelous about the location and time.<br/>
And conversation and being together happen spontaneously through the days,<br/>
weeks and months here, without being scheduled from 6 to 7 p.m.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I try to be as honest as possible.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;When the kids ask me to stop by McDonald&#39;s to buy their lunch is it OK to <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve told the kids when we just don&#39;t have the money. If you don&#39;t got it, <br/>
you don&#39;t got it. And when my kids ask about the cash they might have seen <br/>
in my wallet, I explain what that money is needed for. I&#39;m honest. I&#39;m also <br/>
honest if we&#39;ve got a little breathing space one month. Those are the times <br/>
I say yes. I think they understand the reasons. But, of course, my kids are <br/>
8 and 12.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Is it acceptable to ask that the TV is off and everyone at the table<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If my kids are in the middle of a program, I don&#39;t insist they eat at the <br/>
table. Sometimes they eat at the coffee table in front of the tv. Sometimes, <br/>
it&#39;s a program they&#39;ve already seen or don&#39;t really care about and they <br/>
delight in turning it off and joining us. Sometimes I bring my food in there <br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>

this moment.  The family snarfing off TV trays every night is enough to make<br/>
me think twice about our nearly-every-night TV-meals.  We usually watch<br/>
&quot;Jeopardy,&quot; though, so I have a schooly justification &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t stop at McDonalds or other fast food type places because I<br/>
don&#39;t wish to support businesses which are run like they are.  I am<br/>
very fortunate that I live in an area with a number of alternative<br/>
quick food places.  My children have learned that we don&#39;t stop there<br/>
any longer and don&#39;t ask.  Of course again, most of the time we are<br/>
out and about there are no fast food places to see. They&#39;d rather<br/>
go to Upper Crust - that&#39;s the usual answer when I ask where to eat <br/>
lunch! (It&#39;s a local pizza place.)  This change occurred for us when<br/>
we moved to a new location so it was just part of the transition of<br/>
moving.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it acceptable to ask that the TV is off and everyone at the table<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Family dinners are big for us. Most nights the kids help me cook or<br/>
at least supervise and ask a lot of questions.  Since we usually have<br/>
dinner within 30 minutes of my husband returning home from his work,<br/>
it&#39;s a good time for us to touch base about our days.  If someone is<br/>
watching a TV show, we work out an accomodation - sometimes the show<br/>
gets taped to watch later, sometimes we hold dinner til the show or<br/>
tape is done, whatever seems to work for that situation.  The TV is<br/>
off though - since it&#39;s far enough from the table that no one would<br/>
be able to watch it or hear it - and I live in CA which has high<br/>
electricity rates.   Everyone in my family eats in the kitchen; nobody<br/>
has the right to eat in other parts of the house.  <br/>
<br/>

&gt; but it&#39;s scary too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me it&#39;s all about family harmony and finding a way so that everyone<br/>
wins.  The children are not considered to be lesser or greater than any<br/>
other member of the family.  <br/>

restaurant on Mission Street has a really cool mural of the town.<br/>

Does yours make square Sicilian style pizza?  They make the regular round<br/>
pizzas too but the square ones are best IMO!  And their pesto is terrific.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When dh is home on the weekends, I try to have a family dinner that night or<br/>
the next day just to touch base on all fronts. Otherwise during the week<br/>
with just me and kids, we may eat together or separately. Tonight I<br/>
announced EMFH (every man for himself) and dd had her pb/j/banana favorite,<br/>
ds finished up the tomato soup, I wandered around with a banana. I was<br/>
reading mail, one was watching TV, one was reading a book. Didn&#39;t feel<br/>
disconnected at all, since we&#39;d spent three hours this afternoon trying to<br/>
find Dogz 3 in stores and getting increasingly grumpy with each other.<br/>
(Never did find it; it&#39;s now on its way from ebay.)<br/>
<br/>
Some time ago I started saying yes as much as possible, and respecting their<br/>
no&#39;s. It&#39;s helped me to remember that my kids and I are soul-equivalents<br/>
(for lack of a better term) and the mere fact of my having 30+ years on them<br/>
is no basis for arbitrary judgement.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe it is from a &quot;family time is a priority&quot; mind set that makes dinner together a good thing.  We do not watch tv during dinner and everyone sits at the table.  I feel this is a good thing and here are my reasons.  Dh is not home all day and this is a good time for us to catch up with him.  In addition to the dinner tradition, I try to spend some time one-on-one with each dd at night before I go to bed.  I spend plenty of time with them during the day but this time is diffenent and special, like dinner time can be.<br/>
<br/>
The TV is never on because it would take away from our interaction with one another.  The *message* being conveyed is that we feel spending time listening to each other and giving each other our full attention is important.  Yes this can be done in many different ways and I&#39;m not implying that anyone without the sit-down-together dinner tradition feels it is less important.  I&#39;m saying this is one way we show it is a priority.<br/>
<br/>
People feel comfort in positive traditions.  Children also like repitition.  Just think about how many times kids can read the same book or watch the same movie over and over again.<br/>
Certainly if this time together is not positive, there would be no reason to do it.<br/>
<br/>
TV can be enjoyed as an activity which we do together, like watching the Super Bowl.  TV is usually not going to be on if we want to talk and have interesting discussions.  This does not mean we are limiting TV.  It means we are setting a priority to giving each other our full attention.  I find it rude when I visit someone and they are distracted by the TV if our purpose in getting together is to talk and listen.  <br/>
<br/>
If for some reason the kids did not want to eat dinner as a family, I would explain why we do and give them the choice.   Believe me, they question things that do not make sense to them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think one of the unexpected side effects of living with my dad has been<br/>
watching lots of sports. Well, I usually wander over to the computer<br/>
pretty quick, but he and Cacie watch. The other day she was watching<br/>
Jeopardy Kids Week and the question was about how many points a field<br/>
goal is worth in football, and none of them knew it, and she was jumping<br/>
up and down shouting &quot;Three, Three! Come on, you guys, didn&#39;t you even<br/>
watch the Super Bowl???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Six months ago, she wouldn&#39;t have known. Six months ago, I don&#39;t think<br/>
she&#39;d ever watched a televised sporting event... now she&#39;s contemplated a<br/>
career as the first woman in the NFL, and she throw a pretty good<br/>

&lt;&lt;TV can be enjoyed as an activity which we do together, like watching the<br/>
Super Bowl. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If someone made me watch the super bowl, that would just be cruelty. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
I love football, but I thought so too this year: I mean, here I am a 49er<br/>
Faithful and the hated RAMS are in the SUPER BOWL! And the Poor Pathetic<br/>
Patriots had NO chance, ask anybody before the game.<br/>
<br/>
Wally coaxed, &quot;Come on, you know you love the Super Bowl commercials. Watch<br/>
those and read during the game!&quot; So I grabbed Pride and Prejudice and sat<br/>
down with him.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine my shock and glee (and my subsequent inattention to Elizabeth and<br/>
Mr. Darcy) when the Patriots proceeded to whup some Ram booty! Imagine my<br/>
joy, second only to that of the player himself, watching the Patriot kicker<br/>
make the winning field goal in the literal last seconds of the game!<br/>
<br/>
Now I don&#39;t watch the Pro Bowl, of course. That would just be SICK.<br/>
<br/>
Pam, who finished Pride and Prejudice later. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Even though my husband works a lot, when he IS home, the kids don&#39;t have <br/>
homework, and they can hang around with him.  And when he&#39;s home on the <br/>
weekends, he can just hang out with kids without them wasting any energy on <br/>
school-related discipline issues.  I think the peace and togetherness is more <br/>
than just time factor.<br/>

For us, it was dog training and then internet bookselling. There are many<br/>
possibilities for being self-employed (where the kids can come to the<br/>
workplace, too) or home-based. Make a list of your skills and hobbies and<br/>
your husband&#39;s skills and hobbies and start thinking about what people might<br/>
pay for your knowledge or service or products.<br/>
<br/>
I know a guy here in our town who desperately wanted his own business so he<br/>
bought an old truck and a half dozen garbage cans and now operates a<br/>
thriving poop-scooping business, where people pay a monthly fee and he comes<br/>
and cleans up after their dogs. In our commute town, such a service is in<br/>
high demand. He said he works about three or four hours a day, including<br/>
driving, five days a week, and supports his family doing it.<br/>
<br/>
The possibilities are literally endless. I started bookselling as a hobby,<br/>
and it turned out I&#39;m amazingly good at it (modest, too &lt;g&gt;). Good enough<br/>
that my husband could quit his job and come home 18 months ago.<br/>
<br/>
There is a little work outside the home, still. I have to go and buy the<br/>
books. :) But that usually involves about 5 or 10 hours a week. Tomorrow, we<br/>
leave for a 5-day book-buying trip, all four of us and the dog going.<br/>
<br/>
That reminds me &lt;g&gt;, I won&#39;t be here from late-late tonight until late-late<br/>
Sunday night, so if anyone writes to me in the meantime, I&#39;m not ignoring<br/>
you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533995095">snip&gt;&gt;&gt;What do you do when you get tantrums in response to reasonable<br/>
requests or irrationality in the face of simple rules of the house&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Rules that I think are reasonable are not always truly reasonable.  The<br/>
most effective thing I can do is to talk, talk, talk, and listen, listen,<br/>
listen.  Tell them my reasons and really listen to their reasons. <br/>
Unfortunately, I don&#39;t always react effectively.  But I&#39;m trying!  The<br/>
&quot;How to Talk&quot; book by Faber & Mazlich was helpful to me.  (I have an<br/>
extra copy and some cassettes that go with it, if you want to borrow it,<br/>
Nanci)  Tantrums are rare, but maybe that has to do with their ages?<br/>
<br/>
I am one of those who didn&#39;t think about parenting until I was pregnant. <br/>
I did NOT have discussions with my fiance about what kind of parents we<br/>
wanted to be or even what our future goals were.  Dh is not in the same<br/>
space that I am in so many ways and usually resorts to authoritarianism<br/>
with the kids when he is stressed.  I am so envious of those of you with<br/>
spouses with shared goals!  But I have to deal with where I am and where<br/>
dh is.<br/>
<br/>
I am really excited about &quot;saying yes&quot;.  I had a talk with my girls about<br/>
it.  Told them that I had been making decisions about what they should<br/>
eat and other stuff bc I was the parent and felt it was my job to keep<br/>
them healthy, etc.  That I am going to let them make decisions but it<br/>
might be hard for me bc it is something new.  That I will answer their<br/>
questions about decisions they want to make.<br/>
<br/>
We just went on a field trip with our local hs group to tour a candy and<br/>
ice cream factory.  I told the girls that I would buy them a treat there<br/>
and suggested that they each bring some of their own money to buy<br/>
something, if they wanted to.  I overheard one of the moms tell her dd<br/>
that she couldn&#39;t have any candy bc she hadn&#39;t eaten lunch yet.  (Sounded<br/>
like the old me).  Another mom was telling her kid to pay attention and<br/>
ask questions so she would learn something bc that&#39;s why they came.  It<br/>
was so great to just let my kids be there.  How could they NOT learn<br/>
something?  I learned that freshly made caramel is much better than old<br/>
hard stuff :-)<br/>

<br/>
&gt;Rules that I think are reasonable are not always truly reasonable.&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As I look back over the &quot;reasonable&quot; things I have asked my kids to do in the past, that they fought me on, it has always meant they were trying to tell me something.  The latest one was my on-going request for dd to make her bed. 10 yo dd had no problem with making her bed and even said how much more she liked her room when it was picked up and the bed was made but 12 yo dd hated it.  So I asked her why it was such a big deal.  She said she could not see the point in making her bed when she was just going to sleep in it again and it did not matter to her.  I told her it really made the house feel good to me when the beds were made so I would be willing to make her bed if she would like to help out in another way.  She decided to empty the dishwasher each morning instead of doing the bed.  I never have to remind her and I would rather make a bed than empty the dishwasher any day. <br/>
<br/>
Could you give us an example of a tantrum situation?<br/>
<br/>
It could have something to do with something feeling overwhelming.  I can look at a job and know exactly where to start, what my steps will be, and even have a visual image of what it will look like when I&#39;m done.  I had trouble understanding my dd when she continually said she did not know what to do.  So what may seem like an easy request to you might not look so easy to them.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing.  One of my kids can&#39;t eat artificial dyes, flavorings or preservatives without going into tantrums over the smallest things.  So there is always a chance it could be environmental.<br/>

following:<br/>
***<br/>

<br/>
Dress Guidelines:<br/>

Wear comfortable walking shoes, shoes must be worn at all times.<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
(I don&#39;t know if the participants will be allowed to stay in the park after<br/>
the educational tour is over.)<br/>
<br/>
I started to ask the poster/list - WHY?  why is it necessary to turn a trip<br/>
to an amusement park into a Teachable Moment?  I thought, perhaps it was<br/>
required in order to bill one&#39;s charter school for one&#39;s day at Disneyland,<br/>
but these folks would have come after me with pitchforks for suggesting they<br/>
use their charters just to get money.  We&#39;d just done that argument &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 Then again, maybe California Adventure does have Educational Value (and of<br/>
course, Disneyland does not, being mostly fairy tales and imagination and<br/>
not *History* ;-)  <br/>
<br/>
I cracked up at the part about California&#39;s agriculture; Disneyland and<br/>
company pave over some of the world&#39;s best citrus land.  When I was little,<br/>
growing up in Orange County, you could see pockets of buildings amid the<br/>
groves.  My best friend and I used to play in the one near her house, hours<br/>
of imaginative games, nature observation, pure pleasure.  Knott&#39;s Berry Farm<br/>
not only was a real, working farm, admission was *free.*  There was an area<br/>
called Old MacDonald&#39;s Farm, where you put quarters in the putput car ride,<br/>
or paid about that for a ride on the mule-powered swing, or put a nickel in<br/>
the slot to make the chicken play the toy piano.  The only schooly thing was<br/>
Independence Hall, where we&#39;d go for field trips to see actors stage the<br/>
Signing of the Declaration.<br/>
<br/>
The kids who are traveling to Anaheim to see Disney&#39;s fake version of<br/>
California could go to their pick of San Diego area Indian reservations&#39;<br/>
pow-wow&#39;s, or climb atop a boulder at Steltzer Park to see real acorn<br/>
grinding holes, and try to figure out why the holes would be on the top of<br/>
such a huge rock, and maybe realize that time has eroded the soil away and<br/>
it used to be more easily accessible, and that a real river used to flow by<br/>
there...They could visit real missions, or drive out to Imperial County to<br/>
see real agriculture, or...<br/>
<br/>
Go to Knott&#39;s Berry Farm to pan for real gold in another really fake<br/>
setting!  <br/>
<br/>
Sigh.  I think I need to go watch TV.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand what you mean, and we are very aware of<br/>
whether a request or rule is a reasonable one or not. <br/>
Our problem right now is with things that affect<br/>
everyone and generally revolve around my more spirited<br/>
and &quot;artistically tempermental&quot; child.  He doesn&#39;t see<br/>
the problem with strewing every room in the house with<br/>
6&quot; think layer of toys and when I ask if we can please<br/>
herd the toys back to his own space so that everyone<br/>
else can walk free of injury and etc. I get: &quot;Not<br/>
right now thanks&quot;  or &quot;No thank you&quot;.  Every time. <br/>
It&#39;s never a good time for him.<br/>
<br/>
We are also struggling with going overboard with<br/>
sweets around here lately.  The boys really need to<br/>
learn some moderation and I am trying to maintain my<br/>
confidence that this will pass.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Tantrums are rare, but maybe that has to do with<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that is partially it.  I also know a lot of<br/>
girls my boys ages whom are more reasonable.  I think<br/>
some boys this age (5-6) are maybe not very good at<br/>
empathy and understanding the needs of others that I<br/>
have seen.  Thomas in particular is an egomaniac and<br/>
doesn&#39;t really GET that other people have needs that<br/>
may conflict with his desires.  On the other hand, my<br/>
other son is VERY sensative to others, and almost<br/>
always reasonable, despite being younger.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That reminds me of something.  This past weekend we<br/>
was visiting some friends near Seattle and we went<br/>
with them to a community event with games for<br/>
families.  There was a mom there with her about 10<br/>
year old son and they were both playing Red Light<br/>
Green Light.  I was sitting on the couch with my older<br/>
boy who was feeling moody in the strange setting and<br/>
wanting to have his back scratched (which almost<br/>
always helps to defuse him and help him to handle<br/>
stress better, so he asks a lot.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyways I observed the mom ask her son several times<br/>
to remove his sweater because he was sweating and<br/>
&quot;looked hot&quot;.  He waved his mom away and was busy<br/>
playing his game.  So she eventually tackled him and<br/>
focibly removed his pullover.  As she pulled it over<br/>
his head and he yelled &quot;Mom!&quot; she said &quot;I&#39;m hot.&quot; <br/>
Huh!?  (shrug)  It was amusing, in a sad sort of way. <br/>
It reminded me of my mom always telling me to put on a<br/>
sweater, or jacket, or socks, or whatever, because SHE<br/>
is always COLD.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My girls were out playing with their friends one day when it was cold and a little drizzly.  The friends were definitely not dressed for the weather.  When the friends said they didn&#39;t want to play anymore because they were cold, my girls suggested they just go get a hat and gloves and come back and play.  Their friends said no because their mom didn&#39;t tell them they had to wear them.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I think<br/>
&gt; some boys this age (5-6) are maybe not very good at<br/>
&gt; empathy and understanding the needs of others that I<br/>
&gt; have seen.  Thomas in particular is an egomaniac and<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t really GET that other people have needs that<br/>
&gt; may conflict with his desires.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It might not be that he has no understanding of the needs of others but<br/>
that he has difficulty understanding his own. <br/>
Unschoolers are really good at believing kids will learn in their own<br/>
time,  potty training, talking, reading, math.  But we don&#39;t always think<br/>
of communication in this way.  Just because a child knows how to talk<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they have a complete understanding of communication.  Just<br/>
like knowing how to count and even add doesn&#39;t mean a person has a<br/>
complete understanding of math.   Full communication skills come to<br/>
different kids at different times.  <br/>
In a loving house, tantrums are almost never done for manipulation or to<br/>
make the parent mad.   They are real moments of distress for the person<br/>
having one and at that moment it&#39;s like you and your child are speaking<br/>
different languages.  <br/>
Whatever brings on a tantrum has brought real confusion to a child. It&#39;s<br/>
not being able to process what you are asking or not being able to<br/>
articulate what they are feeling.  It&#39;s not willful.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; We are also struggling with going overboard with<br/>
sweets around here lately.  The boys really need to<br/>
learn some moderation and I am trying to maintain my<br/>
confidence that this will pass. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are there other options as readily available?<br/>
<br/>
If the only thing they can pick up and eat is sweet and other stuff takes <br/>
preparation, the sweets might go faster.<br/>

I don&#39;t tackle Holly, but sometimes I do say &quot;Holly, it&#39;s making me cold to <br/>
see you walk around barefooted when there&#39;s snow outside.&quot;  We laugh about <br/>
it, but there&#39;s a reality to it, too.  <br/>
