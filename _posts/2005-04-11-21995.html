 </span></blockquote>case of  empty nest syndrome some day! (on the one hand, it&#39;s so great<br/>
that i will be  able so spend so much of their lives with them, as<br/>
opposed to them living in  school most of the time, but then at the<br/>
same time, it will be that much  harder to see them go, having been  so<br/>
close!!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it might be easier  to someday see our children &#39;leave the nest&#39; <br/>
because of the relationship that  results from unschooling.  Maybe it is <br/>
easier when we&#39;ve had 10 to 20 years  of lots of good quality time together, rather <br/>
than the more typical parent-child  relationships that are full of the <br/>
interuptions of daycare, school, and what  not.<br/>

****Hi,<br/>
 <br/>
I now have an empty nest.  It is like any other stage and age in life  - it <br/>
comes on gradually, and you get to adjust.  My five kids are spaced  over 17 <br/>
years .  That has meant that they&#39;ve left gradually (which I think  is easier to <br/>
adjust to than if they all left quickly).  The key for me is  that they were <br/>
ready to go, and in many ways I was ready to have them  leave.  <br/>
 <br/>
It happens in steps.  First they started with jobs/and/or  college.  That <br/>
means they are gone for periods of time.  Of  course before this they were <br/>
involved in their own lives so that we weren&#39;t  spending as much time together - and <br/>
doing things like going on field trips or  park days was no longer a part of <br/>
our relationship.<br/>
 <br/>
As I watch them function in their young adult lives I feel very grateful  for <br/>
two things - one, that we did have SO much time together in their early  <br/>
years, and two, that they have such a secure sense of themselves that they can  <br/>
manage so well out in the &quot;real&quot; world.  <br/>
 <br/>
My situation is somewhat different because there has been a divorce in the  <br/>
mix too, but I am enjoying (usually!!  :-) ) the new &quot;challenges&quot; in my  life <br/>
now that I am focussing on developing more income and my new partner  <br/>
relationship.  <br/>
 <br/>
It is like looking back on the days of nursing.  By the time they  weaned, <br/>
both the child and I were ready for that to happen.   Not to mean that I didn&#39;t <br/>
love nursing them, but we were both ready to move  on.  It is like that -- you <br/>
still get to have a relationship with them, it  just shifts somewhat as they <br/>
become more independent and  self-sufficient.<br/>
 <br/>
Do I look back and remember how wonderful the earlier times were?   <br/>
Certainly!!  But I also watch the intense parenting that young children  need, and it <br/>
makes me tired just to be an observer!!  LOL.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-855437601"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I now have an empty nest.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m wondering if anyone here has had the experience of their child staying<br/>
home way into adulthood. I foresee that with my autistic guy. Connie, I<br/>
loved your beautiful description of the evolution of the relationships with<br/>
your children until they went off on their own. I see that happening with my<br/>
other three, who are 15, 13, and 11. With Andrew, who is 16, I want to<br/>
continue completely LOVING his adult stay with us, if that indeed happens. I<br/>
wonder about the families that may have a child who does not follow the<br/>
&quot;typical&quot; pattern, and what that was like for them. Any experiences with<br/>
this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014639672">Me too, Connie. I am starting to LOVE my own time a lot more, too. I <br/>
never thought the time I spent with my children was a sacrifice - I <br/>
loved it, did it willingly (and still do). But I like my own time a lot <br/>
more now than I ever did. I have more books I want to read, want to <br/>
watch movies I choose, want to eat when and what I feel like eating, <br/>
and so on. I know that some people have a tough time when their kids <br/>
are growing up and moving out and so on - but I remember that when my <br/>
kids were younger I sometimes felt almost a sense of panic when I <br/>
thought about them ever not living with us. But, really it IS like <br/>
weaning - it is okay when the time is right and both parent and child <br/>
are ready. Great analogy, Connie!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138257931">Ah...thank you so much for sharing your thoughts...this sentiment<br/>
comparing leaving home to weaning made a lot of sense to me...I know<br/>
since my kids are so young I shouldnt even be thinking about empty<br/>
nest syndrome, but sometimes I do worry about how much I will miss<br/>
them someday.  This comparison you made has given me a little Aha<br/>
moment! :)  Thank you!<br/>
