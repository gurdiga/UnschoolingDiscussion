<div id="ygrps-yiv-596316268">Actually, that&#39;s not where this particular thread originated, though<br/>
it&#39;s an interesting context to discuss.  <br/>
<br/>
I began with the premise that not having a television is like not<br/>
having any other tool, and that the lack of said tool wasn&#39;t<br/>
inherently in conflict with unschooling.  (It seems, for example, that<br/>
we are the only family with a road grader (and perhaps with the space<br/>
and need for said road grader--we need it to repair our &quot;driveway&quot;<br/>
when it washes out.  I say &quot;driveway&quot; because I&#39;m talking about 3<br/>
miles of private dirt road.  We also occasionally repair or plow the<br/>
county&#39;s dirt road that our drive connects to.)).  <br/>
<br/>
It would be silly to argue that another family (even one whose<br/>
children were deliriously interested in heavy equipment) is not<br/>
unschooling, ir failing in unschooling, or should be demonified for<br/>
not having a road grader.<br/>
<br/>
I am applying that same argument to having (or not having) a television.  <br/>
<br/>
What you bring up is an interesting idea, though (and pardon my<br/>
ignorance here) I&#39;m a little confused as to how the television<br/>
compares to the books, magazines, visits, or conversations.  To wit:<br/>
if I want information on a specific subject--knitting, let&#39;s say--I<br/>
could get a book or magazine specific to my subject, or have a visit<br/>
from a knitter and therein have a conversation.  How do I get this<br/>
information from the television?  (Or, again, are we lumping DVDs and<br/>
recorded video media into &quot;television&quot;?)  <br/>

Here in my area there are quite a few &quot;crafty&quot; shows on PBS and I have <br/>
learned a new thing or two about knitting from watching the woman on <br/>
the program knit.  Yes, I have a few books, a collection of patterns, <br/>
and my friend showed me how to knit (I watched her and followed along <br/>
with my own needles and yarn).  However, she didn&#39;t show me more than <br/>
cast on, knit and purl.  I learned casting off from a book AND from <br/>
watching the woman on that PBS show do it.  I didn&#39;t find TV to be a <br/>
&quot;better&quot; source of info for knitting, but it was a helpful and valuable <br/>
resource for me.<br/>

exactly right, imo.<br/>
<br/>
You say that if somebody doesn&#39;t support their kids&#39; interest in heavy <br/>
equipment, that that is still unschooling. But, if somebody has kids <br/>
who are deliriously interested in heavy equipment and they don&#39;t do <br/>

Each of those is a resource - one of many possible ways to get information.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody ever suggests that we not allow &quot;books, magazines, visits, or conversations&quot;, but a few feel justified in saying that TV should not be allowed.<br/>

last decade.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody has said that if somebody doesn&#39;t have a road grader they aren&#39;t <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
Nobody has even said that if somebody doesn&#39;t have a tv they aren&#39;t <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What they have said is that when parents decide, for their own personal <br/>
reasons, not to support a child&#39;s interests the best they can, then <br/>
that is not unschooling. Not having television is missing out on a <br/>
quite wonderful resource that is usually of interest to children and is <br/>
easily and readily available very inexpensively to almost everyone.<br/>
<br/>
If you can find somewhere that somebody has said not owning a tv means <br/>
you&#39;re not unschooling, then we can continue this. Otherwise I am <br/>
asking that you please let it drop because I really don&#39;t think it is <br/>
helping anybody.<br/>

<br/>
We do get it beamed down from the heavens.  :-)   &lt;kind of&gt;  We couldn&#39;t get<br/>
cable for at least 7 or 8 years because of where we live.  I didn&#39;t really<br/>
care, but my dh wanted it pretty badly.  He loves TV.  Eventually, satellite<br/>
TV became affordable.  We got it.  I would miss it terribly now if we didn&#39;t<br/>
have it.  Several years after we&#39;d had satellite TV for a while, cable<br/>
finally became available.  Dh had been wanting cable high speed internet and<br/>
so we switched to cable TV and high speed internet.  Cable sucked compared<br/>
to Satellite TV.  With satellite TV we got twice at many good channels for a<br/>
cheaper price.  So, we kept the high speed internet but went back to<br/>
satellite TV.  My favorite channels are the Outdoor Life Channel and RFD TV<br/>
which both have a lot of horse shows and horse training shows on them.   I<br/>
get to watch Monty Roberts in action, the Parelli&#39;s, and don&#39;t forget<br/>
Clinton Anderson complete with his lovely Australian accent, among other<br/>
widely known natural horse trainers.  Couldn&#39;t get that accent from a book.!<br/>
&lt;g&gt;    My kids still love PBS, but Animal Planet ranks up there pretty high.<br/>
Dh and I also love history related channels and dh loves movie channels.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My kids have had free access to TV for several years now with no remarks<br/>
from mom as to its value.  Because of this list I&#39;ve been able to get to the<br/>
point where I can watch TV without feeling guilty that I should be being<br/>
more useful.  TV isn&#39;t the central part of our lives, but we all enjoy it<br/>
now when we do watch it.   Watching horse training is great, but turning<br/>
around and applying what you learned to your own horse is even better.<br/>
