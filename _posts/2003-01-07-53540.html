 </span></blockquote>My boys havent asked for it ( fingers crossed)  We did see a special on TV <br/>
about it. 48 hours or 60 mins or something. about underage kids buying mature <br/>
content games.. Kids are supposed to be 16 to buy them, but a 10 year old got <br/>
by with buying GTA in several stores. They didnt even check for ID.   My kids <br/>
watched the show and they thought that the game looked too &quot;scary&quot; and full <br/>
of &quot;bad guys&quot;  ( their words)   They got a little worrisome over any game <br/>
that is labled &quot;teen&#39; ( well, my  7 yo did)  I think he was afraid if he <br/>
played a teen game.. some &quot;bad guy&quot; might be in it hitting people and <br/>
generally being mean.   I explained that not all &quot;teen&quot; games ( well, <br/>
acutally, GTA is &quot;mature&quot;) have that stuff in them,  he can try to play and <br/>
if the doesnt like the game. then just don&#39;t play it.   Our video game <br/>
systems are new.. so, we dont have a lot of games and the kids arent familar <br/>
with a lot of games.. I bought Buffy for Landon ( hes her #1fan..lol)  and <br/>
its coming in the mail soon.  They are all looking forward to playing that.. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401230634">Well, we&#39;ve just starting to experiment with &quot;no restrictions&quot; here and it is working pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
I think its true that if we don&#39;t make it &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; they won&#39;t look at it as something to &quot;use&quot;, except as a genuine interest.<br/>
<br/>
And really....if we are raising our kids in peaceful respectful homes, I don&#39;t think violence will have all that much appeal beyond the initial novelty.<br/>

<br/>
Our oldest daugher actually was the first one to tell us about that game. My <br/>
husband thought it was hysterical and it didn&#39;t take long for him to bring <br/>
one home. Just a rental though. I play no games whatsoever on the tv or <br/>
computer. My husband loves his playstation. Like one big giant kid who never <br/>
had the opportunity to play one! Our 8 year old son likes his gameboy and <br/>
computer games and some on the playstation. Mostly he likes games where you <br/>
have to shoot someone. I must admit that he&#39;s accurate as shit!! Kind of <br/>
scary I guess to some! About 2 years ago him and my husband played one game <br/>
I think about a hitman. My son ended up beating the game twice before my <br/>
husband did! After he wins he loses interest and moves on. Our 7 year old <br/>
daugher likes the sporting games best and loves to wrestle on the <br/>
playstation with her dad. She loves racing and soccer and stuff too.<br/>
<br/>
When my husband brough home the one with the stealing cars and hookers, the <br/>
kids just watched. They think it&#39;s funny. So far, no one but my husband and <br/>
oldest daughter has played. Our son especially loves to watch other people <br/>
play more than he actually plays himself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A lot of people I know here in VA are appalled that I let my kids play GTA3. They are 10, 9 and 7 and it is easily their favourite game. So favourite in fact that they are saving up their own money to<br/>
by a copy as we&#39;ve rented it several times from Blockbuster<br/>
Sure, its a bit gruesome but no more than most games and we all know it isn&#39;t real. I&#39;ve played it myself a few times and I&#39;m really hopeless at driving the car and was cross that the man couldn&#39;t<br/>
create mayhem on a bicycle. (being as I am a bike fanatic).<br/>
I censor nothing and never have done. Mostly the kids censor themsleves in that, if actorts start kissing and wotnot, they all hide their eyes and ask me to tell them when its over. My middle child<br/>
dislikes swearing on films which is bizarre cos I swear like a trooper and always have done.<br/>
If a film is scary I will often tell them in advance and quite often they will choose not to watch. The eldest wont watch anything with vampires or sharks in it.<br/>
<br/>
We watched The Full Monty the other day and while they found it funny, they were all grossed out by the fact that in real life, women pay to see men strip :-)<br/>
My daughter wanted to know why....<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never seen anyone kissing in GTA. The game involves driving around doing the missions. This can involve running people over and shoot outs with the cops.<br/>
The women pedestrians often walk around in bikini&#39;s (don&#39;t they get cold?) but there&#39;s no sex.<br/>
As all the people are pixel people they aren&#39;t even all that accurate.<br/>
The attraction is really steering your car through the city streets, stealing motorcycles and police cars to carry out your missions. At one point you even get a helicopter. It&#39;s a fun game.<br/>
I imagine that people who oppose it have never actually sat down and watched it.<br/>
<br/>
As for kissing. When its films and its real people my kids think its yucky. Especially as they know there&#39;s camera men and stuff standing around filming. My daughter is a bit of a prude when it comes to<br/>
sex.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This reminded me that I didn&#39;t give an important detail in the tale of Kirby <br/>
being out at someone else&#39;s house when he got an emergency call to go to <br/>
work.  And it&#39;s kind of like letting someone play GTA3, in a weird way. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kirby wasn&#39;t in his bed when I went to check and neither his dad nor I  knew <br/>
he was going to sleep elsewhere, but he&#39;s 16 and we trust him.  AND... when <br/>
his dad went to sleep (I was first asleep, which is rare) he had been sitting <br/>
at the dining room table playing Apples to Apples with his sister (11) and a <br/>
teenaged girl (19?) named Katrina.   Holly says they played for three hours.<br/>
<br/>
A kid who will play a game with his sister because she&#39;s really been wanting <br/>
to, and play until after 11:00 when he has a teenaged girl in the room with <br/>
him is REALLY proving to be a mature and trustworthy human being.<br/>
<br/>
And he didn&#39;t whine and try to get out of it when he found he would need to <br/>
go to work on a day off.  <br/>
<br/>
So if in the midst of THAT kind of living I had whined or complained about <br/>
him being somewhere else where I could find him with a single phone call, <br/>
what kind of brat would *I* be being?<br/>
<br/>
And that is part of the gradual progression of his whole attachment parenting <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
My boys don&#39;t have that video game with the car theft, but they&#39;ve both <br/>
played it elsewhere.  For his birthday, Marty is getting Hunter: the <br/>
Reckoning.  I think it&#39;s about killing vampires.  He&#39;ll be fourteen.   <br/>

<br/>
But if you let your children have exposure to Red Riding Hood, are you <br/>
condoning sending children out into dark medieval forests?  Are you condoning <br/>
wolves who lie?   Woodcutters who blast into people&#39;s houses and cut <br/>

Believe me, we&#39;ve had many conversations about right and wrong, specifically<br/>
relating to this game!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a very confusing scenario to be in when your kids really, really want<br/>
something that you don&#39;t agree with.<br/>
Their want doesn&#39;t go away in time if you try and ignore the problem, or<br/>
just &#39;put your foot down&#39; as the parent.<br/>
In fact, putting your foot down just makes them want it more. Then it<br/>
becomes a power struggle between you and your kid.<br/>
There are other violent games that my kids have been playing for years that<br/>
could be considered as condoning violence.<br/>
Games like Warcraft, Age of Empires, heck, I was even having a problem with<br/>
my kids playing Deer Hunter because I am a vegetarian and don&#39;t like the<br/>
idea of killing animals, even in a computer game!<br/>
<br/>
I have relied on my gut feeling to get me through many parenting decisions<br/>
since my kids were born.<br/>
Things like vaccinating or not, alternative medicine, homeschooling,<br/>
unschooling, and the unschooling lifestyle.<br/>
 I came to this decision of letting my son play GTA3 because my gut feeling<br/>
was telling me that in &quot;our&quot; case, my son would be okay if we let  him play<br/>
this game. Everybody must make their own specific decisions on letting go of<br/>
limits and just how far you will go with it. For example, I have definite<br/>
limits (still) on letting my kids watch many rated R movies and in general,<br/>
viewing sexually explicit scenes or material. That&#39;s probably more to do<br/>
with how I was raised than anything else, more to do with my own hangups. I<br/>
suspect that as the kids get older, though, we&#39;ll be letting go of limits on<br/>
rated R movies and other things we still have limits on. Parenting sure is<br/>
hard sometimes!<br/>

<br/>
Maybe just missing parental trust and respect.<br/>
If he says &quot;I would like to play this&quot; and you say &quot;No, not under any <br/>
circumstances,&quot; he will keep thinking about that forbidden thing.   And if <br/>
your reasons have to do with questioning whether it will make him become like <br/>
the characters, he might not think you&#39;re being truly realistic and <br/>
thoughtful.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you keep murder mysteries out of your house lest he become a murderer?  Do <br/>
you keep newspapers and TV news out of the house?  (I kinda do, but that&#39;s <br/>
personal preference.)  Do you ever watch action movies where people have to <br/>
defuse the bomb and have only ten seconds left?  Does it make you want to <br/>
learn to make bombs, or carry guns around?<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t have that game.  They never played the Doom.  They do have a <br/>
James Bond game for Nintendo something-or-other (64).  And they&#39;re nice guys <br/>
who help younger children do things they can&#39;t do.  They don&#39;t own guns.  <br/>
Marty got toy cowboy guns for Christmas, for doing tricks and wearing for a <br/>
cowboy-theme RPG he does.  Kirby has been able to take driver&#39;s ed for a year <br/>
and a half, but he keeps saying &quot;Next session, I&#39;m not in a hurry&quot; because he <br/>
has friends to drive him around, and his karate and work schedule will make <br/>
it hard to take driver&#39;s ed.  So he&#39;s not in a hurry to drive around, even, <br/>
but he has played games that were simulated driving games and he&#39;s sixteen.<br/>
<br/>
I have not seen the things my kids read and do change their desires or <br/>
behaviors in any bad ways.  I have seen what other families do affect their <br/>
kids, when they limit and restrict, and the tension builds up until the kids <br/>
are out like a shot, or they come to my house (or wherever) and are in a <br/>
FRENZY of doing what they can&#39;t do at home, while my kids are calmly wishing <br/>
frenzy-boy would just act calm and normal.<br/>
<br/>
We had one (structured) homeschooler who would come her, JUST BE LOUD, and <br/>
eat ice cream until it was all gone (unless we had really lots).  He was no <br/>
good to my boys as far as gaming or visiting until he had the noise out of <br/>
his system, and the ice cream in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120464208">Didn&#39;t want to go searching for the post but wanted to respond. So wording <br/>
isn&#39;t exact.<br/>
<br/>
Someone made reference to what children could be missing wanting to play <br/>
violent games and also made reference to parents condoning that type of <br/>
behavior by &quot;allowing&quot; the game.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really see it as my kids missing anything in their lives that <br/>
propels them toward playing violent games. I watch them and watch my husband <br/>
and we talk...... a lot. They have fun. It&#39;s not so much about the game <br/>
itself as is the skill to play and what they have to accomplishment. My <br/>
daughter likes the wrestling games. She&#39;s not as coordinated on the <br/>
playstation as her brother. The wrestling is funny to her and half the time, <br/>
she&#39;s throwing good guys and bad guys around and falling off things herself <br/>
just because she finds it humorous. I&#39;m not worried that she&#39;ll turn out to <br/>
be another WWF player. My son is more into precision and just wanting to <br/>
win. He dislikes the wrestling as it&#39;s too easy for him. Laughs like crazy <br/>
though when his dad and sister play. He likes the idea of having to be <br/>
exact, whether it&#39;s shooting something, beating a clock or finding something <br/>
hidden. One of his favorite games is on the computer. Some Lego game where <br/>
you have to follow clues and find hidden things within a certain time.<br/>
<br/>
So no, I&#39;m not worried at all about the games they play or the movies they <br/>
watch.  If I was, my oldest would be pregnant, drunk, drug addicted, a <br/>
murderer, runaway and the list would go on.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it has to do with the way we talk to our children and more importantly <br/>
how they talk to us.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it has to do with knowing my children as I do.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it has to do with trusting my children because they deserve it.<br/>
<br/>
All I know is we have never thought of what we do as condoning awful <br/>
behavior and we have never thought that our children will go out and steal, <br/>
lie, cheat and murder. Not even when someone else suggests it do we have any <br/>
doubts.<br/>

I find some of the non-violent games truly boring. Actually the only one I can think of off-hand is Tetris.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the least violent person you could imagine. I&#39;m vegan, anti-war and went to the war protests in DC. I&#39;ve beena  member of CND since I was 12 and I campaigned outside Greenham Common for the removal<br/>
of the US nuvlear missiles based there.<br/>

But I&#39;ve always enjoyed violent movies (John Wayne yaaaaaay) and violent games.Aliens vs Predator is my favourite.<br/>

would agree that parental trust and respect is lacking.  However, in<br/>
my real life experience, most parents (homeschooling and otherwise) do<br/>
not hand down outright refusals without clearly explaining their<br/>
reasoning.  Their children are not repressed drones who binge on<br/>

says &quot;no&quot; does not mean the child forgets about it.  When a friend of my sons <br/>
comes over to play that is the first thing he does, plays the PS2 and the <br/>
computer.  He has to do that for at least an hour before he is interested in <br/>
playing with the boys.  He is severely restricted at home on the computer and <br/>
PS.  But it doesn&#39;t mean that he forgets about what he wants.  It was the <br/>
same with toy guns.  I thought about restricting them and I never bought them <br/>
for my boys but when they wanted to spend their money on a toy gun I didn&#39;t <br/>
say no.  This same child was not allowed to play with guns.  He would run for <br/>
the guns when he came over.  I think his parents saw that he was still the <br/>
same caring young boy he was before and so they gave in on that one. <br/>
