<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676549195">I have been trying unschooling with my two boys, well<br/>
mostly with the oldest child.  How is age 5, the other<br/>
is 2 about to turn 3.  I have been doing it for a<br/>
couple of months now.  Even before I knew what<br/>
unschooling was, I was basically doing it.  My kids<br/>
have always been well behaved and have listened to me.<br/>
 I stopped doing the kindergarden curriculum with my<br/>
oldest when it became a struggle to get him to do it. <br/>
Today I took them to a ball game with some friends. <br/>
And they behaved awfully.  They wouldn&#39;t listen to me,<br/>
they cried when they didn&#39;t get their way, they fought<br/>
with each other, they whined , and they complained. <br/>
They totally went around as if they could do what ever<br/>
they wanted.  And I think it was because I had been<br/>
letting them do what they wanted.  Well they got the<br/>
game boy and the play station taken away for this and<br/>
I told them that things were going to go back to the<br/>
way they were.  I am not a total ogre, I do tons of<br/>
fun activities with my kids.  But I will not have<br/>
spoiled brats running around my house.  I am going to<br/>
start back with the home schooling on the 5 year old<br/>
also.  And I will be unsubscribing to this list.  It<br/>
sounded like a good idea, but in reality it just<br/>
doesn&#39;t work for me.<br/>

Don&#39;t blame us because you&#39;re not figuring out a good way to deal with little <br/>
boys.  They were probably happily excited.  It was a BALLgame, not church.  <br/>
<br/>
And at five and three, what&#39;s the difference if you&#39;re &quot;unschooling&quot; or not?  <br/>
Most kids aren&#39;t even in school when they turn five.<br/>
<br/>
Those aren&#39;t unschooling problems, they&#39;re parenting problems.  I bet your <br/>
kids were hungry, not &quot;spoiled.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometime when you feel like thinking about how kids deal with privilege, read <br/>
these:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/respect">http://sandradodd.com/respect</a><br/>
<br/>
We had another family here today for six hours.  A mom and two little boys <br/>
(10, 9), until the husband came from work to get them.  The mom has been <br/>
going to meetings and various things, Harry Potter tournaments, where some or <br/>
all my three kids (16, 14, 11) have been, along with other, various kinds of <br/>
homeschoolers.   She&#39;s going to switch from doing any school at home to <br/>
unschooling because she&#39;s so impressed with my kids&#39; knowledge and behavior.  <br/>
We talked for most of those six hours.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And I will be unsubscribing to this list.  It<br/>
sounded like a good idea, but in reality it just<br/>
doesn&#39;t work for me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hard to tell on such a short trial.  I hope some of the ideas stick with you, <br/>
though, and that your boys aren&#39;t always having to &quot;act&quot; to earn privileges <br/>
like playing games.  You cut off your nose to spite your face that way.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aren&#39;t they five and two?  That&#39;s the way many kids that age are <br/>
under certain circumstances... even kids who go to school and have <br/>
no freedom.  I had days like that when my oldest was five, and he <br/>
went to preschool.  What you&#39;re describing has nothing to do with <br/>
unschooling and probably has something to do with overstimulation, <br/>
tiredness, hunger, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They totally went around as if they could do what ever<br/>
&gt; they wanted.  And I think it was because I had been<br/>
&gt; letting them do what they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that when you&#39;re new to unschooling it can seem <br/>
like &quot;letting them do whatever they want,&quot; especially if you&#39;re <br/>
coming from an authoritarian upbringing yourself.  But I don&#39;t see <br/>
it that way at all.  I want my kids to be able to live in the world, <br/>
and I want other people to like them and enjoy having them around.  <br/>
They are free to do what they want, but they are *not* free to step <br/>
on anyone else&#39;s toes or be rude in the process.  I think you&#39;re <br/>
doing your kids a disservice by &quot;letting them do whatever they want&quot; <br/>
without any input or guidance, and I also think that you&#39;re doing <br/>
unschooling a disservice by calling it unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to tell you about the fighting with each other <br/>
part... that&#39;s always been one of my biggest problems, but it has <br/>
more to do with my children&#39;s personalities and our family dynamics <br/>
than anything else.  I can tell you that I do know plenty of other <br/>
families whose children bicker a lot even though they go to school <br/>
(or do school at home).  I can&#39;t see how &quot;home schooling on the 5 <br/>
year old&quot; (do you realize how that sounds?) will solve your problems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-283751345">Hi,<br/>
I strongly urge you to stay with this list. Listen. Read. Take unschooling step by step. One step at a time. Your children are going to cry, laugh, whine, hunger, thirst, be impatient, be loving, be wonderful, be kids. Unschooling doesn&#39;t &quot;make &quot; kids more manageable. It&#39;s not about that at all. School is more about that. That&#39;s one of the reasons it&#39;s not about learning - it&#39;s about creating controlled consumers.<br/>
I&#39;ve raised two kids (they&#39;re 28 & 30) traditionally. I&#39;ve a ten y.o. now and we&#39;re iunschooling. Whew -the difference is amazing! I can&#39;t begin to tell you how close we are, how much fun we have!1 <br/>
I&#39;ll tell you something else - Brianna is well read, articulate and well, most people do not believe she&#39;s only 10!! A big reason is because of how she learns and how we live. We&#39;re relatively new at this and it can be scary - please, seriously - hang in there!<br/>

ball game.  Maybe there would have been something better they were interested <br/>
in. If this is new their communication skills might not be as good.  Maybe <br/>
they didn&#39;t know how to tell you what they wanted. I have always unschooled <br/>
but many say it does take time.  Maybe they were testing you to see if it was <br/>
really true or if it was a conditional, limited thing.  It takes time to get <br/>
it and have it work int eh family.  It takes lots of communication on both <br/>
ends.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you haven&#39;t unsubbed yet, I bet there are lots that others could offer.<br/>

fine, except for that spelling thing.<br/>

Sometimes he would put &quot;the voice&quot; on for the computer to read him what the <br/>

certainly handle the strategy and rules and procedures of the game fine. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  Marty had been playing a big, complicated online role playing game for a year <br/>
  or so.  It all has to do with writing on AOL instant messages and in chat <br/>
  rooms set up as different areas of that &quot;world,&quot; and using online dice, and <br/>
  reporting wins/losses, and making alliances and earning promotions.   Marty <br/>
  used to yell out &quot;How do you spell &#39;either&#39;?&quot; or &quot;How do you spell &#39;their&#39; <br/>

<br/>
Too bad. It sounds like you just had a bad day. I&#39;m not sure how that <br/>
translates into a failure of unschooling. All kids have bad days. <br/>
Maybe they were tired, hungry, over excited, hot, thirsty, etc. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the unschooling, it&#39;s the *situation*.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649169791">Hi Amy. My boys are 6 and 3. We have slowly been adopting more of an unschooling lifestyle<br/>
(never did &quot;school&quot; so that has been the easiest, letting go of other restrictions (tv and<br/>
food) have been more of a challenge for me but getting easier every day). What I have found<br/>
is that unschooling has not led directly to perfectly behaved kids but it has led to me being<br/>
a much more creative mom. <br/>
<br/>
It has been an ongoing process...at first I would run into situations for which I could not find<br/>
an &quot;unschooling&quot; (i.e., solution that was respectful to my boys that did not include<br/>
punishments etc) solution. But then I would think about it more (I started thinking WWJD...<br/>
what would Joyce do ;o) ) and lo and behold I would come up with several other options.<br/>
After the fact of course, but the more I did this, the easier it was to come up with<br/>
solutions when I needed them. <br/>
<br/>
Many times it would have been very easy to say, well, I tried, but it did not work. But I <br/>
am glad that I kept thinking and looking. I have found that my attitude has shifted lately.<br/>
What I used to see as problems I now see as things that I need to find a different approach.<br/>
And I feel confident that I will find one. For example, a friend watched the boys for me <br/>
yesterday morning. She made them cinnamon toast with pepperidge farm cinnamon bread. Jason <br/>
had never had it and loved it. Had several pieces while I was gone and asked for more<br/>
when I got back. He very well could have eaten the whole loaf and if we were home I would<br/>
have let him. I did tell him at one point that we needed to save some bread for them<br/>
and that it was not polite to eat all of someone else&#39;s food. I also told him that we could<br/>
pick up some on the way home. He was not really happy and whined a little. I could easily<br/>
say that letting him eat what he wants is a complete failure and it led to him being <br/>
a greedy ungracious guest in someone&#39;s home. But that really is not the case. All that means<br/>
is that we need to talk a bit more (at home when we are not in the middle of it) about<br/>
how we would not like it if someone came and ate all of our food and to keep that in mind.<br/>
But I trust that he will get it with time and practice. Maybe that is the biggest change<br/>
I have found since adopting unschooling parenting practices (not sure what else to call them)<br/>
I really do trust that my kids will want to do what is right. They are good kids and I do<br/>
not see it as my job to *make* them behave...it is my job to help guide them and trust that<br/>
they will learn what they need to learn...including not only academics but life lessons<br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
I really do hope that you do not scrap everything based on this one incident. You said yourself<br/>
that making him do lessons was not working. Keep reading here and keep looking for better<br/>
ways to handle situations. Post about a specific incident and see if others can come up<br/>
with some ideas. I know that I have been amazed at what solutions I have been able to<br/>
work out with the boys just by being open and looking for solutions other then putting<br/>
my foot down or telling them what to do. There have been times when I have just told them<br/>
that I had no idea what to do but that what we were doing was not working! That in itself<br/>
has given us a breather and some space to work it out. It can be very difficult<br/>
at times, but I have found that it is getting easier. <br/>
<br/>
And it is worth it. It has not created kids who always go along with what I want or kids<br/>
who don&#39;t complain or who always do what I tell them to do. But I am starting to see that <br/>
they see that I am on their side. They still want what they want and I am still not <br/>
*always* able to give it to them. But I think they are also seeing that I will try my <br/>
best to help them get what they want. That I do not want to stand in their way. And that <br/>
has helped our relationship immensely (and I thought that we had a pretty good one to <br/>
start with!).<br/>
