<div id="ygrps-yiv-427866773">I just wanted to Thank Sandra for writing her book, &quot;Sandra Dodd&#39;s Big Book of Unschooling.&quot;  So, thank you, Sandra.  When I woke up this morning, I had no idea that I would read &quot;Seeing your child, rather than a label&quot;, &quot;Giftedness&quot;, Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs, &quot;Piaget&quot;, &quot;Subjects&quot;, and &quot;Reading&quot;.  When I woke up this morning, I did some writing in order to make room for the sunlight of the spirit to enter my mind and body and give me peace.  I actually had a concern on my mind upon awakening.  This is not a normal morning for me to have someone on my mind.  I like peace.  The writing began about a benign woman who doesn&#39;t like me, but what I discovered or uncovered was that I am re-visiting my childhood when I was 10 years old.  My daughter is 10.<br/>
<br/>
My parents put me on a diet when I was 10 years old, and made me get up at 5 a.m. to go jogging.  I was told not to eat certain things or they would make me fat.  The messages I received were &quot;no fat chicks&quot;, &quot;fat girls are ugly&quot;, and &quot;you are a failure in some way if you are fat.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
After leaving my family house, I did much work to learn and let go (a 20 year journey of self forgiveness, acceptance, and freedom).  I am free most all the time...but, lately, I have a problem.  I hear myself talking about when I was 10 and how I grew to be 5&#39;7&quot;, but what I am really doing is trying to let all people know she won&#39;t be chubby forever.  As if there is something wrong with being chubby. So, in effect, I am not accepting my daughter with unconditional love.   Just because I grew to 5&#39;7&quot; between age 10 and 11, I don&#39;t know what is going to happen with my daughter.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is such a neat person.  I really like her.  I guess I didn&#39;t know that I still saw the world through these distorted lenses.  I am shocked that I don&#39;t see her as perfectly human just the way she is.  What I mean by perfectly human is she likes to eat things that taste good, and has no desire to waste time on things that don&#39;t.  Who doesn&#39;t like to eat what tastes good to them?  I can&#39;t even convey to this list how much work I have done to accept those inner children of my own who needed me to reparent them.  Well, here I am, hoping some of you may relate to this.  I will NOT control this child&#39;s food, or choices.  It will do nothing good.  It never did any good for me.<br/>
<br/>
It has been hard for me, though.  I am having to do everything in my power to practice restraint of tongue.  I literally bite my tongue.  I am grateful that I have kept my mouth shut (miracle!!).  Why would I still look at fat as bad?  It is just protection, and my Higher Power (HP) made us that way.  Who am I to question HP&#39;s handiwork?  Do I think I am the HP?  My daughter&#39;s growth is between her and her HP and none of my business.  Ok, I am done.  Have a wonderful day to you all.<br/>
