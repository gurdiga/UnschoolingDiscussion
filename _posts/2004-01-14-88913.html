<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886830172">Got some great deals on cluster packs of computer games at Sam&#39;s Club today. They&#39;re pretty hit and miss, but often big shipments get split around the country so those of you who have Sam&#39;s memberships might be able to find them too.<br/>
<br/>
Super Strategy, includes Majesty, Civilization II, Ages of Empires Gold Edition and Risk II-- $13.82<br/>
<br/>
After School Clubhouse, includes Cluefinders, Zoombinis Island Odyssey and the Oregon Trail-- $18.64<br/>
<br/>
Kids Collection, includes Sim Theme Park, Island Extreme Stunts, Soccer Mania, Sim Safari, Sim Town and Sim Coaster-- $16.87<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d pass it along, cause I&#39;m pretty psyched!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I saw that last collection in the Walmart flyer for $10 I think! Maybe $19.99...that sortta makes more sense...being in Canada and all. I found Oregon trail and Africa Trial bundled at Winners last August marked down to 5 bucks in a summer clearence bin and just picked up some bundled D&k software (Magical adventures of Oz, amazing Animals, & Human body Explorer) for $10.<br/>
  Just had to brag.<br/>
  I AM looking for Castles II and saw online ads for it in a big bundle pack and have yet to find the first Zoombinis.<br/>
