<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;That was my experience with them, but at the time that would have been ok. <br/>
The conversation that made me leave was one of the members leaving her dh to <br/>
see some guy she&#39;d met at that list. She was breaking up her family over it, <br/>
I was ill and couldn&#39;t stay after that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just to satisfy my curiousity, was she from Australia and then she moved to <br/>
the states with this guy??<br/>
