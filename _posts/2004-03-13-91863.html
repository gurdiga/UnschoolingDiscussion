<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947911636">I was born on Kinchelo (spelling?) Air Force Base in Kinross, MI.  Good luck <br/>
in the UP!  You will see a lot of snow, even in September and still in June in <br/>
a &quot;good year&quot;.  I don&#39;t really remember it there but have seen photos of our <br/>
little base house pretty much covered completely in a snow drift.  Have fun!  <br/>
And take up cross country skiing, gives you something to do in the winter.<br/>
