<div id="ygrps-yiv-522926050">Yesterday my 16 year old daughter just got back from an overnight trip with <br/>
her boyfriend and another couple.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I measured my 7 year old son and he&#39;s now up to 4 ft. 2 1/2 in. <br/>
(only 9 inches shorter than his older sister)<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, my 6 year old daughter baked her first pie, pumpkin, all by <br/>
herself and it was her own idea to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday my barely 2 year old daughter just got rid of her crib and is now <br/>
in a regular twin bed with Pooh sheets and comforter.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I sat outside with my husband and cried. I miss my babies.<br/>

I think I wept over every stage. My youngest is now 7 and it all <br/>
feels like it went too fast.<br/>

if I jump in here. I just felt the need to respond because I am going <br/>
through something similar -- we have just decided to not have any <br/>
more children. It is definitely a bittersweet thing, and I have had a <br/>
few tears myself, so I understand. &lt;hug&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439094179">Well, Mary B., count me among the mamas who cried right along with you!<br/>
Watching these babies grow into wonderful &quot;old kids&quot; is full of tears for<br/>
me, while I rejoice in the fact that they are such good people, with solid<br/>
ethics and strong hearts -<br/>
My 19 year old baby is going to China and Japan at Christmas.<br/>
My 16 year old baby just got back from a trip to LA to see her boyfriend.<br/>
My 12 year old baby just saved his money and bought his own dirtbike.<br/>
The list is never-ending and causing me to ponder . . . is there really<br/>
life after our children?!!?<br/>

Sympathy and understanding.  I know that crying.  I know that missing.  <br/>

I guess you do know your family sounds wonderful, but I bet you&#39;d just love <br/>
half an hour of nursing a baby and laughing with a toddler.<br/>

LOL!!!! When the baby weaned herself, my husband had to stop me from trying <br/>
to force nurse her!!! I&#39;d give a lot to have just one of those days back. I <br/>
know there are more wonderful days ahead of me, just so very different. <br/>
There&#39;s something to be said about those little ones!<br/>

Thanks for understanding. It helps. When we were outside and I was crying, <br/>
my husband asked if I was afraid of there being life with just he and I. I <br/>
don&#39;t see that as a problem at all. What I guess I&#39;m kind of worried about <br/>
is if I&#39;ll be as fulfilled not taking care of kids anymore. It&#39;s really what <br/>
I know how to do best. Know what I mean?? I guess we all want to be really <br/>
good at something right?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-726031720">I think I can also relate.  I was involved with another man and work until my little boy was 4 months old.  I took a whole month off of work to re-acquaint myself with my WONDRFUL husband, and the little man, but I still felt like I had missed so very much the first few months.  E. still gets me up at least once during the night, which I enjoy greatly, even though I can&#39;t lift E. in or out of his crib, so hubby gets up too and helps.<br/>
<br/>
I still regret &quot;missing&quot; those months.<br/>
