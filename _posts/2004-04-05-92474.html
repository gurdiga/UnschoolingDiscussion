<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130197311"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;See, his grandpa pays him $10 for every A he gets, so<br/>
 </span></blockquote>he&#39;s invested in grades. I think that&#39;s a huge<br/>
mistake, and am trying to find a way to gently pull<br/>
out of that, but don&#39;t think there is a gentle way.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You could offer him $20 a class not to care! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It just takes a lot of practice, right? Just keep<br/>
 </span></blockquote>going and keep questioning and keep talking? It will<br/>
get better?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, it takes a lot of DOing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We are talking about just this thing over at Unschooling-101. <br/>
<br/>
My opinion is that it DOES take work. It takes being aware for a long time of <br/>
what you&#39;re saying, doing, and implying. It also takes immersing yourself in <br/>
a passion so that you aren&#39;t on *his* back all the time! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It DOES get better. In fact, it gets GLORIOUS! <br/>
<br/>
Keep working. One day that lightbulb will come on, and you won&#39;t be able to <br/>
ever go back!<br/>

idea! so hard for Grandpa to let go of his ways, he<br/>
was the Superintendant of the school I went to!<br/>

can get myself out into the gardens. I get so much<br/>

outside!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92311812">&quot;she will say things like &quot;they need to know what a indirect object<br/>
is or they need to know this higher level math&quot;,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm....<br/>
I have helped my dh run a successful (by our terms) business for the <br/>
last six years that we started on our own, I can paint and draw and <br/>
sculpt and write and heal with herbs and birth children and organize <br/>
large events and speak in public and run workshops and counsel and <br/>
compete in triathlons and garden and run a homeschooling support <br/>
group.<br/>
And I don&#39;t know what an &quot;indirect object&quot; is. But I bet I will by <br/>
the time I go to bed tonight...because I&#39;m just curious enough to <br/>
know why the heck something so obscure would be deemed hugely <br/>
important by someone!!:)<br/>
<br/>
As to higher level math...PHHFFFFTTTT! (picture me with thumbs in <br/>
ears, waving fingers and sticking my tongue out).<br/>
Who needs it? Engineers, mathematicians and maybe some scientists. <br/>
Can&#39;t think of anyone else who needs it.<br/>
I certainly don&#39;t....and my life is happy and successful by my own <br/>
standards...which is all that really matters anyway.<br/>
