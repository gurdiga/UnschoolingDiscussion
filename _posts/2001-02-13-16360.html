<div id="ygrps-yiv-253628496">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I just posted this to my message boards, but no one really goes there, so I <br/>
thought I would send it to the list. I love seeing things like this unfold <br/>
before my eyes and wanted to share.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, Alex (5yo) was coloring the letters on a poster of the<br/>
alphabet. The letters were arranged four to a row. He finished<br/>
the second row and asked, &quot;What do two fours make?&quot; After<br/>
the third row, he asked, &quot;What do three fours make?&quot; He<br/>
continued this to the fifth row. When he finished the sixth<br/>
row, he surprised me by asking a completely different question. He<br/>
asked, &quot;What do three &#39;two fours&#39; make?&quot; I was thinking about<br/>
the people who made the poster and their intent for it: to<br/>
teach kids the alphabet. I am so glad I don&#39;t jump on<br/>
opportunities like this to try to teach what is intended.<br/>
Instead, we have tons of stuff like this and he goes through it<br/>
when he feels like it and does what he wants with it. In fact,<br/>
the book that the poster came in was given to him at<br/>
Christmas and he is just now going through it. If I had sat him<br/>
down at that time and worked with him on the letters, he may<br/>
have thought the book was supposed to teach him letters and<br/>
never given a thought to the math. I&#39;m also glad I give him<br/>
exact answers to his questions, if I can. When he asks, &quot;What<br/>
do two fours make?&quot;, I answer, &quot;Eight.&quot; and not, &quot;Well, let&#39;s<br/>
count it and see.&quot;, or similar distractions to his line of thinking.<br/>
Just think, one good intentioned, probing question could have<br/>
switched him away from exploring and enjoying multiplication.<br/>
As far as the alphabet goes, he did ask what 24 and 2 make<br/>
and then told me there were 26 letters in the alphabet. He<br/>
also noticed the M and the W were the same, only facing<br/>
different directions. <br/>
