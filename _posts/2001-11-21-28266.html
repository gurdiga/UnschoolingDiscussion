<div id="ygrps-yiv-769222224">Hi and welcome....<br/>
Is your husband willing to read anything about educating children?  If so,<br/>
try refering him to John Holt (How CHildren Learn,  How Children Fail,<br/>
etc,),  or perhaps Raymond and Dorothy Moore&#39;s Better Late Than Early.<br/>

<br/>
hello,<br/>
I just signed up for this list.  We have two young boys and this is<br/>
the<br/>
second year we are homeschooling the 6 year old.  Last year we were<br/>
pretty casual. Well for some reason this year I decided to buy a<br/>
boxed<br/>
curriculum. It is going OK.  He really likes the math and I am<br/>
letting<br/>
him go at his own rate.  But it is the reading that is bothering me.<br/>
He is learing to read OK, but it isn&#39;t his favorite.  He is reading<br/>
the<br/>
books that came with the curriculum until the present one.  He says<br/>
he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to read it. So then I said to myself, &quot;I don&#39;t want to<br/>
make him read a book he doesn&#39;t want to read&quot;.  But he isn&#39;t really<br/>
interested in reading other books on his own either.  We go to the<br/>
library a lot and he checks out books on subjects that he is<br/>
interested<br/>
in.  Like right now it is hockey.  But they are all adult books, he<br/>
just looks at the pictures.  Which I think is great, but he has no<br/>
interest in learning to read them.  The main problem is my husband,<br/>
he<br/>
wants me to teach him to read and write!  So has anyone been in my<br/>
situation?  Being more relaxed than your significant other?  I don&#39;t<br/>
want to force my son to read and turn him off of it.  I am just now<br/>
relearning to enjoy reading myself and I want to make sure my son<br/>
loves<br/>
to read.  But I also need to keep my husband satisfied.  If I tell<br/>
him,&quot; Oh he will pick it up in a few years, he will be OK&quot;.  He won&#39;t<br/>
like that.  Well Sorry to make this so long!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Good heavens, I thought if I just ignored this list for awhile,<br/>
things would settle down and a more harmonious atmosphere would<br/>
prevail.  How wrong I was!<br/>
<br/>
Paranoia and hypocrisy seems to abound!  No where in the post this<br/>
paranoia refers to is any reference specific to Sandra.  I&#39;m sure<br/>
that with such a ego it will come as a shock, but everything on this<br/>
list isn&#39;t about Sandra and every post that list members don&#39;t agree<br/>
with that Bridget makes aren&#39;t about Sandra either.<br/>
<br/>
But, the bottomline comes for me when I went back and read the<br/>
archieves for all those digests that I deleted.  To say that I was<br/>
sorely disappointed would be the understatement of the year.  There<br/>
are many on the list that I held in high regard but while I might<br/>
listen to some of the opinions expressed, I will no longer view them<br/>
as coming from a place that I might want to be.  And in this category<br/>
I also include the list owner which is a profound disappointment to<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
If you are wondering what brought this about, it was the post where<br/>
the quote &quot;What benefit there is to her or any of the Arab world, I<br/>
can&#39;t imagine except that perhaps it is the joy of troublemaking.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Am I the only one here that objects to racists and those that let<br/>
racist behavior slide or make, as I am sure will follow, excuses or<br/>
justifications for their racist remarks?<br/>
<br/>
And please do not demean yourselves further by using what seems to be<br/>
the oft expressed, but demonstratively untrue, sentiment that she has<br/>
a good heart, that she is a good person.  This simply is not true.<br/>
This is a woman that supposedly has a college education, taught<br/>
school (thank God not my child) and is or was a journalist.  She<br/>
knew/knows precisely what she said and what it meant!<br/>
<br/>
And, as to the comment by the one woman that she is a charismatic<br/>
speaker which is somehow suppose to make her a good person, so was<br/>
Hitler, another racist!<br/>
<br/>
Goodbye to the list.  I cannot remain where so many are that practice<br/>
looking the other way or worshipping at the alter of a false idol!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Gotta get going now. Just a start of a new thought, what do you all<br/>
&gt;  think?<br/>
&gt;   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree with this. I have found many people who get very defensive when I<br/>
say<br/>
&gt; we homeschool, as if they see an implied criticism of their schooling<br/>
choice<br/>
&gt; (which is usually public school.) Interestingly, it is the folks whose<br/>
kids<br/>
&gt; are in public school, not private or charter, that seem the most<br/>
defensive.<br/>
&gt; Amy<br/>
&gt; Amy Kagey in NW Ohio<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That sounds similar to my experience. I also have run into many public<br/>
school folks who say they could never homeschool, and then proceed to<br/>
complain about how much trouble their school is. How their child is<br/>
miserable, how unfair the teacher or other kids are, how stifling, on<br/>
and on. They say they could never homeschool because (choose one or all<br/>
of the following:) they&#39;re not organized enough, coundn&#39;t work that<br/>
hard, that they don&#39;t know enough, that the kids need socializing, or<br/>
(the saddest &quot;reason&quot; of all) that they couldn&#39;t stand being around<br/>
their kids that much. I do mention that I am not really that organized,<br/>
and that I find unschooling much easier that fighting a system. Mostly<br/>
I just say that the real beauty of homeschooling is that you can work<br/>
it out to fit your own families needs, and do what&#39;s best the way you<br/>
see it. Change things around to use what works and throw out what<br/>
doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s so flexible, and very individual. Sometimes I get in<br/>
a word about a new version of socialization too.<br/>
<br/>
I think many people are afraid of the idea that they alone would be<br/>
responsible for teaching their kids everything. I tell them it dosn&#39;t<br/>
really have to be like that. I am learning with my kids, and they are<br/>
part of the process.<br/>
<br/>
anyway I&#39;m rambling again.<br/>

Subject: Topics From Dateline<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else watch Dateline last night?  Well, here&#39;s some new topics to sink<br/>
your teeth in.<br/>
<br/>
1)  If you prostitute your children&#39;s lives, do you have the right to<br/>
complain when you don&#39;t like parts of their lives making headlines?  By<br/>
that, I don&#39;t mean that you don&#39;t have the right to be unhappy about it.  I<br/>
mean you don&#39;t have the right to whine, snivel, complain and shed some tears<br/>
over it on national television.<br/>
<br/>
2)  For those that run daycares or have foster children:  How long would it<br/>
be before CPS/CWS appeared on your doorstep (remember these are mainly 3 and<br/>
4 year old) if someone called in and said or they saw as a sound bite on the<br/>
nightly news that a) you had removed all the handles from the windows of the<br/>
bedrooms of 8 children, all of which are on the second floor and then hidden<br/>
the handles; b) children standing on top of toys that are as tall or taller<br/>
than the railing on a second floor balcony; c) children running around with<br/>
knives (not butter knives, sharp knives); d) children playing Cirque du<br/>
Soleil from the chandelier; e) children running around unsupervised through<br/>
road construction; f) mom taking a switch away from a small child saying,<br/>
&quot;that&#39;s only for mommy and daddy to use.&quot;?  And a dozen other things but I<br/>
blanked half of them out I was so floored by it all.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Since they made a few references to homeschooling these children, how<br/>
soon before we get some backlash from the media over the grinning fool<br/>
talking about &quot;the Bible says &#39;spare the rod, spoil the child&#39;&quot; as an excuse<br/>
for using a switch on toddlers when asked about discipline.<br/>
<br/>
4) And, speaking of controlling parents and potty training, anyone else<br/>
notice mommy dearest thunk the little boy back on the potty chair when he<br/>
got up to leave it?<br/>

Hi Karin,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think you are making a good decision.  I was vegetarian for<br/>
about five years because it was what my body needed.  My oldest on<br/>
the other hand needs a lot of meat.  Oh, sure she can get lots of<br/>
protein other ways but it just never seems to fill her up like meat<br/>
does.  I think it is a difference in our bodies.<br/>
Anyway, I let her have all the meat she wanted but she had to learn<br/>
to cook it for herself when I couldn&#39;t stand the smell of it.  She<br/>
learned and never once complained about having to cook it.  Of course<br/>
yours are a little younger but I&#39;m sure it will work itself out.<br/>

There is a big difference between saying:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe that there is a psychological factor to all illnesses.<br/>
<br/>
And saying:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Everything that happens first begins as a thought, whether<br/>
&gt; totally conscious or subconscious or some variation therein.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The first I agree with wholeheartedly.  The second I disagree with<br/>
equally strongly.  Not that there can be no psychologically initiated<br/>
disorders - just that there are some that are purely out of our<br/>
control and not started by a thought, conscious or otherwise.<br/>

It probably is.  I think it&#39;s important in these cases to be careful not to<br/>
imply that anybody should be able to do the same with their illness.(I&#39;m<br/>
not saying you&#39;re doing that at all.)  I went to a new age church for a<br/>
while and the minister told a story about when his mother was dying of<br/>
cancer.  This was before I was attending, and I never met his<br/>
mother.  Apparently there were a number of people in the church who had<br/>
criticized both the minister and his mother for *not* being able to heal<br/>
her with thought.  Sheesh!  There&#39;s *so much* involved in any illness.  It<br/>
can be awfully hard to sort out what&#39;s affecting what.<br/>

&gt;When others have a problem with what I&#39;m doing, I might say again<br/>
&gt;nicely that &quot;We are having a fine time and the unschooling (or<br/>
&gt;whatever) is really working for us&quot;. I won&#39;t go on the<br/>
&gt;defensive, because that puts them in control of the situation. Their<br/>
&gt;feelings are real, but they are not about anything you are doing. They<br/>
&gt;are all about what they&#39;ve done, and experienced in<br/>
&gt;their own life. Anything you say or do will always be filtered through<br/>
&gt;their own experiences. That&#39;s why their problem with what you do can<br/>
&gt;only belong to them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Gotta get going now. Just a start of a new thought, what do you all<br/>

<br/>
I quite agree with you.  Good points.  I think I might even go so far next<br/>
time as to respond with something like, &quot;So, I guess school works really<br/>
well for your kids, eh?&quot;<br/>

Consider that I originally wrote that paragraph to read:<br/>
&quot;I personally want to know if my words are coming across meaning<br/>
something I don&#39;t.  When it happened frequently I went back to see if<br/>
I could figure out why.  But I could only do that if I heard what<br/>
others thought I mean in a resectful way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I changed the wording because the same thing had just happened with a<br/>
different person here just before I wrote it and I&#39;d seen it before.<br/>
So I decided it was applicable to many others and I rewrote to be a<br/>
neutral &quot;one&quot;.  If you saw something else, maybe you might want to<br/>
contemplate whether you are reading what I write, or what you THINK I<br/>
write.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I should think that one would want to know if one&#39;s words are<br/>
coming<br/>
&gt; &gt;across as meaning something they don&#39;t.  If it happens frequently<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; &gt;might want to go back and reread one&#39;s own words to see WHY they<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; &gt;unintended effects.  But one can&#39;t do that unless one hears how<br/>
&gt; &gt;others interpreted him/her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *If* it was important to that person that her words be heard in<br/>
exactly the<br/>
&gt; way she intended them by every person on this list, she would have<br/>
listened<br/>
&gt; to you by now and changed her &quot;evil&quot; ways.  Since she hasn&#39;t, I<br/>
assume that<br/>
&gt; your perceptions are not a priority for her.  Every time this issue<br/>
seems<br/>
&gt; to have settled down, up it pops again. You&#39;re flogging a dead<br/>
horse, Bridget.<br/>

I loved your resonse.   I&#39;m going to repeat it to myself over and over so it<br/>
can slide out of my mouth in this situation!<br/>

&gt;nicely that &quot;We are having a fine time and the unschooling (or<br/>
&gt;whatever) is really working for us&quot;. I won&#39;t go on the<br/>
&gt;defensive, because that puts them in control of the situation. Their<br/>
&gt;feelings are real, but they are not about anything you are doing. They<br/>
&gt;are all about what they&#39;ve done, and experienced in<br/>
&gt;their own life. Anything you say or do will always be filtered through<br/>
&gt;their own experiences. That&#39;s why their problem with what you do can<br/>
&gt;only belong to them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Gotta get going now. Just a start of a new thought, what do you all<br/>
&gt;think?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I quite agree with you.  Good points.  I think I might even go so far next<br/>
time as to respond with something like, &quot;So, I guess school works really<br/>
well for your kids, eh?&quot;<br/>
