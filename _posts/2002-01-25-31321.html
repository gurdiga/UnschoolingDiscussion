<div id="ygrps-yiv-906737226">I wanted to ask the list how you are recording things in the preparation for <br/>
college in the future even if your children are young?  Do you plan to think <br/>
about it later, or are you recording things now and planning a head.  My son <br/>
is 12 and has an interest in being a video game designer...I bet all little <br/>
boys want to do that.  But, I actually have called the college he likes that <br/>
has that degree and am going to be taking him there on an overnight &#39;field <br/>
trip&#39; with his 4 year old younger brother.  The drive is about 1-2 hours <br/>
away.  I want to take him to some of the classes and meet some of the <br/>
students and teachers.  I also want to meet with an admissions director who <br/>
has told me they have many homeschoolers.  I think I should plan now on ways <br/>
that he can set himself apart from others and record them or some things that <br/>
are special.  He may never go to college, but I feel I will explore things <br/>
like this with him now so he knows that he can get in if he wants to.<br/>
<br/>
What do all of you think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-539253316">Hi Mary and other Group Members:<br/>
<br/>
I have a 12 year old son who also thinks he will be a game designer. <br/>
I have set up a tour for him at a local company that designs and <br/>
sells video games. There he will be walked through the whole process <br/>
from the artists through to the marketers. He will get an idea of <br/>
what part of the video game design experience he likes. I think it is <br/>
really cool that they have agreed to let him see their set up. <br/>
Perhaps they are scouting for future talent. You can&#39;t start too soon <br/>
in a business like that.<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of something that is happening with my daughter and I <br/>
have been meaning to ask you all about it.  My 7 year old dd has been <br/>
writing books and she asked me last summer if I thought that anyone <br/>
would buy them, as she wants to make her own money. I told her that <br/>
she could always try to sell them, but that she would need to make <br/>
lots of copies or we could do them up on the computer and have them <br/>
bound etc. She told me that she would like to do this (on the <br/>
computer).<br/>
<br/>
She was frustrated with having to do the drawings and so I suggested <br/>
that maybe we could find an artist who would do the pictures. My <br/>
daughter has seemed fine with all of this telling me she just wants <br/>
to sell her books so she can make money. However, my husband tells me <br/>
that he thinks I am going overboard (and being materialistic when he <br/>
proposes I should be fostering our daughter&#39;s artistic nature.)<br/>
<br/>
I have found an artist to do the drawings and I have had my daughter <br/>
explain exactly how she wants the characters in her book to look. The <br/>
artist and I are trading services, as he needs some help with <br/>
marketing himself and I have some experience with that.<br/>
<br/>
I have also told my daughter that if she wanted to, we could find out <br/>
if the local humane society or SPCA will sell her books once they are <br/>
ready for printing. If they will, I want to start a publishing <br/>
company in my daughters name (run under our family&#39;s corporation as <br/>
my husband and I own a consulting business and the kids do work for <br/>
us) and self-publish her book.<br/>
<br/>
The publishing company would eventually be my daughter&#39;s if she wants <br/>
to pursue writing as a career. (she has told us since kindergarten <br/>
that she wants to be an author and she is constantly writing books). <br/>
Her and I have talked about the publishing process and what an author <br/>
has to do: a. get a publisher to buy the book or b. self-publish. She <br/>
just keeps saying, &quot;Do you really think people will buy my book? I <br/>
really want to make money.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Am I just providing the tools for her to learn something or, in your <br/>
opinion, am I going overboard? It is my impression that my daughter <br/>
may be more geared toward &quot;sales&quot; than she is &quot;art&quot;. I encourage them <br/>
both.<br/>
<br/>
E.g., my son above is heavily into drama and I support him by driving <br/>
him to his classes, attending his productions and fund raising for <br/>
the theatre (which was an expectation upon sign-up.) I do not tell <br/>
him where I think he should go with his acting or how long he should <br/>
pursue it etc. If it makes him happy, great! It sounds, even to me, <br/>
that I&#39;m second-guessing myself.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604841713">I don&#39;t think you are going overboard as long as you are not giving <br/>
you daughter unrealistic expectations.  Getting published or <br/>
developing a good following for self-publishing is difficult.  It can <br/>
be done but you have to really WANT to be doing it.  If your dd just <br/>
wants to make money, there may be things she would like better.  If <br/>
wants to WRITE, this is a very good thing.<br/>
<br/>
It all boils down to what she wants.<br/>

I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going overboard at all.  I think it&#39;s wonderful you <br/>
are able to do all this for your daughter.  IMHO you should go as far as <br/>
she&#39;s willing to go.  Just follow her lead and do what you can do to <br/>
help her follow her interests.  If her interest is in sales, I <br/>
personally, don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with that.  Just by <br/>
helping her write these books, I&#39;m sure you have been fostering her <br/>
artistic nature all along.  Isn&#39;t writing an artistic venture?<br/>
<br/>
Also, just because she wants to make money doesn&#39;t automatically mean <br/>
she is or will be materialistic.  IMO, wanting to make money is not a <br/>
bad thing.  A lot of good can be done with money.  It can bring a lot of <br/>
happiness.  It can certainly give her a sense of independence which, I <br/>
think, is a good thing and is one of the reasons why we unschool our two <br/>
boys.<br/>

He can get in if he wants too.  If he has a real desire, he will get <br/>
in.<br/>
It sounds to me like you are pushing your agenda on to your child.  <br/>
Has he requested to do any of this, or are you taking his passion, <br/>
and leading him in a direction you think is best, for him to achieve <br/>
his (your?) goals.  I think you might be leaving him with an <br/>
impression of what is expected.  If you have expectations, then you <br/>
are going in the right direction.  If you want him to lead a life <br/>
that comes from his desires and motivation, I would suggest you <br/>
rethink it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My first reaction to your post is that he&#39;s awfully young to be going out college-scouting. Did he ask you to set this up? Or is this an extension to an interest he expressed and you felt it would be good/helpful to look into it further? Not knowing him, I can&#39;t say, but when I think of my own 11 yr old daughter, going to a college would be wayyyyyy over her comprehension level. Of course, each child is different. He may be much more mature than my 11 yr old. <br/>

I&#39;m of the opinion that colleges won&#39;t care what your child did at any age under 16 or there abouts unless it was some *really special* something like winning a national geography bee and even then, I&#39;m not so sure they&#39;d care. My readings indicate that what colleges care about are SAT&#39;s, GPA&#39;s and references from people they consider &#39;in the know&#39; such as teachers, coaches and the like.<br/>
My oldest is almost 16 and we aren&#39;t recording anything even though she does alot. When the time comes, which is a few years from now, we&#39;ll collect letters of recommendations, turn in the SAT scores and create some sort of overview of what she did as a teen.<br/>

<br/>
Sarah, Cafi Cohen suggests starting to collect letters of recommendation<br/>
earlier--8th grade, I think.  At first I thought I would feel weird asking<br/>
for a letter for college when my son is only 15, but after I thought about<br/>
it, it made sense.  I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d bother with this prior to high<br/>
school level unless, like you said, it is something extraordinary.  I was<br/>
thinking that, for example, my son is very involved in Boy Scouts.  I<br/>
envision his continued involvement, but who knows what could happen in the<br/>
future.  If, for example, his Scout leader retires or moves....and I&#39;d like<br/>
what he&#39;s writing to be fresh in his memory.  A good time to ask for that<br/>
recommendation was when Matt was acting as the Senior Patrol Leader and was<br/>
really doing a lot in the troop.  And, while I think Matt will still be<br/>
involved in the troop after he earns his Eagle rank, I doubt he&#39;ll be<br/>
involved indefinitely and I know his Scout Leader has mixed feelings about<br/>
&quot;losing&quot; kids as they get older.  I&#39;d like him to write about Matt now and<br/>
then if other things come up in the future that would make it better, I can<br/>
always ask for another letter later.  Kids&#39; interests and activities wax and<br/>
wane....I think it&#39;s a good idea to &quot;strike while the iron&#39;s hot&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My kids volunteer at the library regularly and a couple other places on and<br/>
off.  The librarian will remember them for a long time, I&#39;m sure, but some<br/>
of the other &quot;shorter&quot; stint places might not....or management could change.<br/>
<br/>
Now--despite this, I haven&#39;t done it yet!!  :-)  I still think it&#39;s a good<br/>
idea, though.  Ha!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Cafi Cohen....for those of you with teens or thinking ahead to<br/>
the college years, Cafi has a newer book out on the topic.  Her older one<br/>
was more specifically about her own children, but this new one is a little<br/>
broader and, I think, easier-to-read.  I like it.  It&#39;s called<br/>
_Homeschoolers&#39; College Admissions Handbook: Preparing 12- to 18-year-olds<br/>
for success in the college of their choice_.  Prima Publishing.  Published<br/>

Also, dd worked several years with her gymnastics teacher(began at the tender age of 11) and we have a letter each year that documents how she spent her time, how she had grown from year to year and all that stuff. It&#39;s not organized by any stretch... just letters kept in a notebook for later use. What I *don&#39;t* have documented that I feel I should have is her annual academic accomplishments (i.e. she completed Miquan math as a kid by herself, now it&#39;s Harold Jacobs Algebra and so forth). I guess when the time comes, I&#39;ll go through the bookshelves and find a way to compile her accomplishments with that as my base.<br/>
I need to read Cafie Cohen&#39;s site more but I always get sidetracked and never make it to the place I orig. intended to go :-)<br/>

In Real Lives by Grace Lewelllyn, did you read the story about the teenager who had that same interest? You should find that book.. it was really interesting!<br/>

I read the book.  It really got me thinking about the type of college my dd would want to go to.  She would just want to go to a place to get an education not enter a competition.  It irks me to think these colleges want to be paid for their services and still they want us to jump through hoops to see who gets to pay them.  I can understand if I were applying for a job, I would be competing with other qualified applicants and would need to show some credentials but that is a position where the employer is going to pay me.  We will not be jumping through any hoops here. I will do the same type record keeping as I do for our state portfolio review.<br/>

&gt; &gt; trip&#39; with his 4 year old younger brother.***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This implies to me, that going to college, is very important to you,<br/>
&gt; or atleast you think your son can&#39;t become a video game designer<br/>
&gt; without it.  I wonder what your son thinks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually depending on where in the economic cycle one is, it can mean<br/>
that a person can&#39;t get started in that business without a degree.<br/>
Back in the good old days, all one needed was an interest, a willingness<br/>
to work long hours and an ability to learn.  Now that it is more<br/>
established and games cost more money to produce, it isn&#39;t that <br/>
easy.  Sometimes it isn&#39;t what our children think - it&#39;s what<br/>
market forces are.  The video game business is *huge* as in billions<br/>
of dollars a year.  The production of a game is almost as involved<br/>
as a Hollywood movie.  One way to get started is to work as a<br/>
tester.  I know the current game I&#39;m playing could have used more<br/>
testing before release!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The Game Developers Conference is in late March in Santa Clara, CA.<br/>
I don&#39;t know where you are located but it&#39;s a very big conference<br/>
on many different aspects of the gaming business.  My DH will be<br/>
going.<br/>

I don&#39;t think it sounds like you are pushing him.  <br/>
<br/>
I also think that as far as the expectations Joanna speaks of <br/>
here . . . well, society has expectations in general.  My kids know <br/>
that many people expect them to go to college because that is &#39;what&#39;s <br/>
done&#39;.  They know their dad wants them to go to college and has <br/>
careers all picked out for them.  They also know that I don&#39;t care <br/>
whether they get degrees or go to college at all.  They know that the <br/>
decision is theirs. I think it is an important lesson to learn - - <br/>
the one about other people having expectations that you don&#39;t have to <br/>
live up to if you are moving in a different direction.  I can&#39;t say <br/>
at what age mine learned that lesson but they are 14 and 16 now and <br/>
know it way down deep where it will stick.<br/>

&gt; He can get in if he wants too.  If he has a real desire, he will <br/>
get <br/>
&gt; in.<br/>
&gt; It sounds to me like you are pushing your agenda on to your child.  <br/>
&gt; Has he requested to do any of this, or are you taking his passion, <br/>
&gt; and leading him in a direction you think is best, for him to <br/>
achieve <br/>
&gt; his (your?) goals.  I think you might be leaving him with an <br/>
&gt; impression of what is expected.  If you have expectations, then you <br/>
&gt; are going in the right direction.  If you want him to lead a life <br/>
&gt; that comes from his desires and motivation, I would suggest you <br/>
&gt; rethink it.<br/>
