<div id="ygrps-yiv-878636446">So Cassidy (5) is playing with her Japanese hamster world toys (I don&#39;t know<br/>
if there is an English/American name for them.)  She informs me that she<br/>
needs a grandpa hamster.  I tell her that next time we are down that way,<br/>
we&#39;ll go to the (Japanese) Toys-R-Us to get some more hamster stuff and look<br/>
for a gradpa.<br/>
<br/>
She comes over to the computer and says, &quot;Mama, isn&#39;t there someplace called<br/>
Hamster.com if you Google it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Who knew!<br/>
<br/>
Tami, off to see if there is a place called Hamster.com!</div>

<br/>
&quot;Look it up on the internet&quot; is one of Jayn&#39;s mantras also.<br/>
<br/>
We are crazy about those Japanese toys and little figures like &quot;Kid Robot&quot;<br/>
and such. Many of them are quite bizarre, like the ferocious, blood<br/>
spattered teddy bears and the tiny bunnies with cigarettes. We find a lot of<br/>
our little Anime and Manga figurines at Puzzle Zoo stores (in the USA).<br/>
<br/>
From James&#39; interest in collecting small Godzilla figures as well as anime<br/>
dolls and miniature robots, he and Jayn have been slowly developing a<br/>
combination board game/role-playing game which they have called &quot;The Battle<br/>
Between Good and Evil&quot;. They range their figures on a large square of foam<br/>
core that we keep for the purpose. I know that part of the game has to do<br/>
with using a flashlight to cast shadows across the board, but how the rest<br/>
of it works eludes me. Jayn and James will play this game for a couple of<br/>
hours, and as far as I can tell there is never an end or a winner. <br/>
<br/>
BTW James is the &quot;Evil&quot; side and Jayn the &quot;Good&quot; using pretty figurines.<br/>
Every time we go out they are always on the look out for more characters for<br/>
their game.<br/>

candle.  The game board is a forest, and there&#39;s a trail.  Players  <br/>
move their pieces, and one of the dice rolls is the move of a little  <br/>
candle, and if your piece ends up fully lit, it&#39;s captured (or  <br/>
something like that).  As with some other Ravensburger games, I think  <br/>
each player has more than one piece.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know that game?  It could be out of print.  I played it at a  <br/>
friend&#39;s house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400112201">Oh!  Thank You!<br/>
<br/>
Joy of joys...it&#39;s the hamsters on-line!  Cassidy will be so happy!  (It&#39;s<br/>
morning here now, but I&#39;ll show her when she wakes up.)<br/>
<br/>
I really had NO idea what they were called...we can get hamster-themed stuff<br/>
at the 100 yen store, and the words are in English, but they always write it<br/>
&quot;Ham-Star&quot;.  Google doesn&#39;t have much to say about that.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like there is a cartoon...that&#39;s cool!  Maybe we&#39;ll get cable when<br/>
we move.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing to add to the &quot;we don&#39;t want to leave Japan, but if we have<br/>
to move back to the states, this will make it better&quot; list.<br/>
<br/>
Tami, in the land of the really cool McDonalds &quot;Happy-Set&quot; toys!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-701524854">Oh yes... the gift thing.<br/>
<br/>
It never ends.  Really.  We give our neighbors (who are Japanese) Christmas<br/>
gifts.  Since they mostly don&#39;t do Christmas, they don&#39;t all reciprocate.<br/>
However, they NEVER show up to visit with empty hands, which means that in<br/>
order to be proper, we offer something in return.  A bag of tangerines here,<br/>
a dozen cookies there...(you might recall that they don&#39;t bake).  And so it<br/>
goes....<br/>
<br/>
Andrew spear fishes and our neighbor is a chef in a fancy Japanese<br/>
restaurant...his wife is a good friend of mine (who used to be a dolphin<br/>
trainer before her daughter was born), so when we have extra fish, we give<br/>
it to them and they bring it back prepared in the most amazing way.  (This<br/>
friend, BTW is the daughter and granddaughter of Buddhist monks and grew up<br/>
in a real temple.)<br/>
<br/>
When we go to the playgrounds that are not on base, we are always stocked up<br/>
on American candy, because the candy trade thing is a big deal too.  Too bad<br/>
it&#39;s mostly too hot to tote chocolate around...its usually lollipops or<br/>
something else not melty.<br/>

Shadows in the Woods<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s right!  The pieces aren&#39;t taken off, but out of play  <br/>
because they&#39;ve turned to stone (until they&#39;re rescued by another  <br/>
player).<br/>
<br/>
from the instructions) The dwarves hide in the shadows of the trees  <br/>
from the wandering light. The burning tea-light [adult player] moves  <br/>
through the dark forest [mostly randomly] and tries to find the small  <br/>
dwarves in their hiding places. If a dwarf is touched by the light,  <br/>
it is frozen and not allowed to move anymore. The other dwarves try  <br/>
to release it. To achieve this they must wait until the light has  <br/>
gone far enough so that one of them can join it in the shadow. All  <br/>
the dwarves try to unite under one tree while the candle tries to  <br/>
freeze the dwarves. Who will win, the light or the dwarves?<br/>
<br/>
Shadows in the Woods is a cooperative game for players 5 years and  <br/>
up. An adult player for games where children play is required, due to  <br/>
the open flame of the candle. an alternate version included in the  <br/>
rules is intended for players 7 years and up, and is quite a bit more  <br/>
challenging. The alternate version does not require an adult player,  <br/>
but does require adult supervision. (The light doesn&#39;t move.)<br/>

---------------------------------------<br/>
I read that the light moves on the circles of the path to the roll <br/>
of a die. The person moving the candle gets to pick what paths to <br/>
take. Anyway, playing games in the dark with fire just sounds cool!<br/>
<br/>
Also, I LOVE that website for finding new, interesting games...<br/>
