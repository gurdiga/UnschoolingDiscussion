choose this one) earlier in the month.  <br/>
<br/>
If any of you want to write to her it might be really cool for other people <br/>
down the line.  Can&#39;t hurt!<br/>
<br/>
==============================<br/>
<br/>
Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I found your site while checking the traffic to my site (Math Cats -<br/>
<br/>
www.mathcats.com); I noticed that a visitor this evening had arrived at Math<br/>
<br/>
Cats through a link from your &quot;Unschooling and Math&quot; page -<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/math.">http://sandradodd.com/math.</a>  I read the lengthy piece in the right column by<br/>
<br/>
Linda Wyatt and the descriptions in the left column, though I haven&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
followed the links yet.  I was tickled to see the description of Math Cats:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I found a great math site that seems like it was designed for<br/>
<br/>
unschoolers.... www.mathcats.com  You can mess aroung with polygons and<br/>
<br/>
tessalations, explore what you like with no determined path or<br/>
<br/>
drills...great stuff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everything I&#39;ve just read that Linda Wyatt wrote resonates deeply with me,<br/>
<br/>
even though I and my three children were all schooled in the conventional<br/>
<br/>
way.  But the only time I loved math in school was when we learned how to<br/>
<br/>
make some polyhedra out of triangles.  We actually just cut out templates in<br/>
<br/>
school, but I was so intrigued that I went home and figured out how to draw<br/>
<br/>
perfectly even rows of equilateral triangles so that I could make as many<br/>
<br/>
icosahedra and other polyhedra as my heart desired.  And I eventually became<br/>
<br/>
one of those teachers who was rather uncomfortable teaching math; it<br/>
<br/>
certainly wasn&#39;t why I had gone into teaching; I just endured the math<br/>
<br/>
lesson each day, until my wise principal once observed one of my math<br/>
<br/>
lessons and pointed out that if I put as much creativity and enthusiasm into<br/>
<br/>
teaching math as I did into teaching creative writing, my students would<br/>
<br/>
love math as much as they loved writing.  Wow - that was a revelation for<br/>
<br/>
me.  From that point on, I did everything I could to make math class fun,<br/>
<br/>
hands-on, and meaningfully connected to the real world, and yes, my students<br/>
<br/>
did start loving math.  So now I&#39;m trying to do the same thing in the online<br/>
<br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m frankly amazed when kids sometimes write to tell me that their math<br/>
<br/>
skills have improved from visiting Math Cats, because that is certainly not<br/>
<br/>
my priority, though I think it&#39;s pretty cool if it happens along the way.  I<br/>
<br/>
mostly want kids to discover the same joy and beauty in math that I<br/>
<br/>
experienced in my youth when I began turning ordinary pieces of paper into<br/>
<br/>
beautiful geometric ornaments.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So anyhow, I just want to say I&#39;m glad to have discovered your page, and I&#39;m<br/>
<br/>
looking forward to reading the other material on your site.  Also, I would<br/>
<br/>
be very happy to correspond with some of the unschoolers who visit your<br/>
<br/>
site.  I&#39;d like to know more about the unschooling approach to learning.<br/>
<br/>
After visiting your page, I think I&#39;d like to add an &quot;unschooling&quot; idea bank<br/>
<br/>
to the grown-up cats&#39; section of Math Cats, and you can be sure I&#39;ll be<br/>
<br/>
recommending your site!<br/>
