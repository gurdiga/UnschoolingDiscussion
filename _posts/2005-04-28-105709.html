<div id="ygrps-yiv-413178359">***The thing I am really worried about here is the emotional aspect.  I<br/>
don&#39;t mind taking time to explain over and over again until he<br/>
understands. But he gets soooo upset and I feel so bad for him.  And so<br/>
often I (or dh or Charles) end up getting upset.***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just going to throw out a couple of thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
First, I think this is very normal.  There is an age range where a lot of<br/>
people have a hard time asking exactly what they want and where they have<br/>
a hard time applying what they&#39;re hearing to what they already think.   I<br/>
don&#39;t think this is an emotional problem or barrier or anything like<br/>
that.  I think it&#39;s just normal.<br/>
<br/>
Next, it might be part of your normal family style of communication.  You<br/>
mention others get upset too, so maybe this is the way your family<br/>
communicates.  Maybe you&#39;re all easily frustrated when things don&#39;t go<br/>
exactly how you expect and he&#39;s mirroring that or it&#39;s part of his<br/>
genetic make up. <br/>
<br/>
Also, paying attention to how you&#39;re answering his questions might give<br/>
you some clues.  Is he getting a superficial answer when he&#39;s looking for<br/>
something deep and meaningful?  Is he getting more explanation than he<br/>
wants?  Sometime when you&#39;re *not* watching anything ask him what he<br/>
thinks.  Mention you notice he gets frustrated and ask what you can do to<br/>
make that whole question/answer process easier for him.<br/>
<br/>
David and Dylan had a hard time communicating and often over questions<br/>
about movie or book happenings.  <br/>
David would give a simple answer.  &quot;He jumped off the building because he<br/>
didn&#39;t want those guys to catch him.&quot; <br/>
Well, Dylan knew that much.  He wanted to know *why* the guy thought<br/>
jumping was the best choice.  Why couldn&#39;t he try to run past them?  Why<br/>
didn&#39;t he kick them and get away?  What was he so afraid of if they<br/>
caught him?  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe he just doesn&#39;t like what he&#39;s watching.  Maybe he&#39;d like to go do<br/>
something else but doesn&#39;t want to do it by himself.  Could you offer to<br/>
go play a game with him instead?   <br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas that may or may not help you. Dylan was like this at<br/>
about that age and it sorted itself out with a lot of talking and<br/>
understanding and some time.  He&#39;s the one explaining most things to us,<br/>
now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
