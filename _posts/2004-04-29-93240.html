<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407836614">I think your room-mate was wrong to jump in and lay a heavy <br/>
judgement on their fantasy play, whether it was about death or not. <br/>
They&#39;re little and play is how children explore topics they may not <br/>
understand very well. It&#39;s how they deal with serious emotions too.<br/>
Play and art are often the only way they have to deal with these <br/>
serious issues.<br/>
It&#39;s best to calmly respond with non-judgmental comments. Instead of <br/>
re-directing them (they weren&#39;t hurting anything and didn&#39;t need re-<br/>
direction at that time) you could say &quot;oh really?&quot; or &quot;what happened <br/>
to the baby?&quot; You might have gotten clues about real life, from <br/>
their fantasy play.<br/>
They may have seen something on tv, or be affected by the war or any <br/>
number of real life situations, or simply be concerned about death <br/>
and what it all means. But you won&#39;t find out if the play gets <br/>
shamed. Open dialogue won&#39;t happen if they think their play is &quot;bad&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Try to explore the feelings and issues without judgement or re-<br/>
direction next time. I&#39;m very sure that no one will get hurt by <br/>
pretending a baby is dead or hurt, though it IS a serious and sad <br/>
matter in real life.<br/>
<br/>
Her interest in death is something she needs to explore right now. <br/>
How about indulge her interest by getting children&#39;s books on the <br/>
topic, discussing feelings and thoughts about death and maybe even <br/>
having your own Day of the Dead celebration and honor those in your <br/>
family that have died? It&#39;s a real life issue, and real life <br/>
learning happens when there is interest. Society tends to shun <br/>
uncomfortable subjects, but we&#39;re unschoolers!! So dive right in.<br/>
