<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025076601">Last year my dh, James (W6JHC) held an Amateur Radio funshop, with a fairly<br/>
small attendance. Since for this kind of funshop to work well a lot of<br/>
equipment has to be set up, and local hams would again be brought in, James<br/>
wants to get a feel for if there is interest in having another this year.  <br/>
<br/>
He was muttering something about trying to get in contact with the space<br/>
station, and is investigating the number of local repeaters situated nearby<br/>
(last year there just weren&#39;t very many in the area so they didn&#39;t get too<br/>
many contacts).<br/>
<br/>
So any likely takers?<br/>
