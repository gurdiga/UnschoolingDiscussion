<br/>
I think that is true.<br/>
<br/>
I make a living (if you can call it that) playing drums, and it remains a <br/>
lifelong goal to improve at it, and I must say that there is a zen aspect to <br/>
learning and improving in anything -- at least in my experience. However, I&#39;m <br/>
not sure quietness and peace are always the inner signs that learning is <br/>
going on. At least not for me.<br/>
<br/>
That is, usually you think you suck, and are playing horribly, and it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t cross your mind that you are learning. Instead you think you gotta <br/>
go home and practice -- the assumption being that we learn during practice <br/>
(study). Other times you&#39;re bored stiff, but still taking things seriously <br/>
and doing your best not to simply go through the motions; you try to make the <br/>
common, uncommon. Other times -- very rare times -- everything comes together <br/>
and you&#39;re in the zone and playing wonderfully.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid to say that those latter moments are to be indulged in prudently. <br/>
For when you think you&#39;re doin&#39; it, chances are you aren&#39;t! And this is the <br/>
zen. Bummer. And when you&#39;re struggling, and reaching, and ... failing! ... <br/>
that is when the learning is going on and you&#39;re actually making great <br/>
progress. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, we should indeed glory in glorious moments, but then we <br/>
should thank God for them and move on, else we might make glorious moments <br/>
our goal rather than improving. <br/>
<br/>
Learning also means forgetting, but having been transformed in the process. <br/>
Imagine what we&#39;d be like if we remembered and had at hand everything we&#39;ve <br/>
learned. What bores. We&#39;d never be invited to dinner parties!<br/>
<br/>
The idea of learning and progress being a struggle gives America&#39;s political <br/>
and cultural issues (among other things) a new light, for while we obsess <br/>
over whatever it is making the news (kidnappings, corporate scandals, <br/>
POLITICS IN EDUCATION), and we think we&#39;re headed for Hell in a hand basket, <br/>
it&#39;s quite possible that we&#39;re making great strides toward humane <br/>
civilization instead. But don&#39;t quote me on that, I&#39;m no guru or philosopher.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Bob <br/>
