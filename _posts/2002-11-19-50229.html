<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813175832">My five yr.old has asked me this question a couple of times: &quot;Mommy, <br/>
why don&#39;t we do real school anymore?&quot;  When I started hsing we used <br/>
the workbooks and curriculum, but within a few weeks shifted to <br/>
unschooling.  I explained to her that when we go to the zoo or to <br/>
the tidepools at the beach or when we read together...we are still <br/>
learning and that is real school.  I also explain to her that the <br/>
workbooks are still on the shelf if she ever wants to work in them <br/>
and I can help if she needs it.  I feel bad though...but I want her <br/>
to become comfortable with unschooling and not feel like she needs <br/>
worksheets...she hasn&#39;t even been in much traditional school.  My 8 <br/>
yr old on the other hand is now at the opposite corner.  No reading, <br/>
no writing, no math at all!!!  Of course baking cookies is okay :) <br/>
And playing the game with coins where you have to trade them in for <br/>
larger coins until you get to a quarter and then you get to keep the <br/>
quarter!  That is okay too :) And we just got the placemats...they <br/>
love them.  I just let them look through them all and discuss with <br/>
them what they want.  My son is fascinated with maps...any time he <br/>
sees one it stops him dead in his tracks and he is always making his <br/>
own...I find that intriguing.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-454377110">You could tell her it&#39;s a kind of real school called &quot;the open classroom,&quot; <br/>
and since you&#39;re not even limited to one room, or even your one house, it&#39;s <br/>
kind of like the whole world is her school.<br/>
<br/>
And after she gets into the swing of it, you never have to make those kinds <br/>
of definitions anymore! ,g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How about turning it around to him - &quot;Is there something you miss about<br/>
when we did &#39;real school&#39;?&quot;, or something like that, and then you can do<br/>
exactly what he liked about it. And you could explain that when you did<br/>
workbooks and stuff like that, you thought kids had to do workbooks and<br/>
stuff so they&#39;d learn the right things, but now you know that they will<br/>
learn the right things when it&#39;s the right time without anyone making<br/>
them do workbooks... so now you&#39;re just going to be with them and all of<br/>
you will be learning and doing the stuff you like to learn and do. And if<br/>
he&#39;s worried that he won&#39;t learn stuff without workbooks and schooly<br/>
stuff (so young to have that school-mindset :-( ) you could tell him<br/>
stories about kids you know from the internet who did...<br/>
