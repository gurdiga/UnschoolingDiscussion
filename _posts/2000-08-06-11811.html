<div id="ygrps-yiv-413764646">I have found that in teaching special ed kids, they accept math better by <br/>
starting with calculator use and computer programs.  They then can be <br/>
encouraged to &quot;do math&quot; from there.  Most school programs start from the <br/>
other direction, teaching math computation skills first, because they think <br/>
it will hamper the childs learning.  I have found it the opposite.  They are <br/>
more ready to learn computation skills because they see how it can be used to <br/>
speed their work.  You might try that.  Most kids are fascinated with <br/>
calculators anyway.  How many of us have given a toddler a calculator to keep <br/>
them busy while we conduct business with an adult, complete grocery shopping, <br/>
or even, I confess, keep them quiet in church?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136049749">OK, I&#39;ll jump in on the math thing.<br/>
<br/>
My dh was in ps, making fair grades in average math, until he decided he <br/>
wanted to attend a fairly competitive private school. So he taught himself <br/>
algebra in a fairly short period of time.<br/>
<br/>
The following summer, knowing that he wanted to become a scientist, he taught <br/>
himself calculus.<br/>
<br/>
It can be done, if the student is motivated. (I&#39;ll admit, my unbiased ;-) <br/>
opinion is that my dh is brighter than average, but then again, most people <br/>
would never need to go so far as calculus)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-760686328">My son is 11 yrs and got a computer program and it was pre algbra.  He looked <br/>
and me and say&quot;we never covered this in ps.&quot;  Well I told him that it had <br/>
been awhile for me too and I sat down and started playing this game.  All he <br/>
did watch me and then he got on the game and finished two levels.  I was <br/>
quite surprized he picked it up that quick.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-411937097">Thanks for all your responses about helping a child learn math. We do have<br/>
calculators, LOTS of games, and many computer programs that involve math.<br/>
These go mostly unused, however. I&#39;ll suggest &quot;Why don&#39;t we play...&quot; and<br/>
most of the time he says no or &quot;not right now&quot;, or picks another game<br/>
instead that doesn&#39;t involve math. BUT he is very motivated to use math in<br/>
relation to money (how many weeks of allowance to buy something, etc.), so<br/>
I guess I shouldn&#39;t worry, he will pick it up eventually. I think it is<br/>
hard to watch my 7yo struggle to remember something simple, like 3+7, when<br/>
someone tells me about how their 5 yo is adding 3-digit numbers in her head<br/>
(happened yesterday!), and then try to go on to explain how homeschooling<br/>
works for us. I have encountered this expectation from non-homeschoolers<br/>
that homeschooled children should be more advanced academically than their<br/>
public schooled counterparts. I just usually say &quot;everyone learns at his or<br/>
her own pace&quot; and let the subject go. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462366223">I have been reading a book called _Family Math_ by Jean Kerr Stenmark (?)<br/>
and I think it&#39;s great! Tons of math games and activities that actually seem<br/>
fun and educational, but not overtly &quot;mathy&quot;. I also chanced upon a book<br/>
called _MathArts_ by, I believe, Maryann Kohl. Actually, my 3 year old son<br/>
found that one at the library somehow. Same thing as family math, only all<br/>
of the games are art projects. It&#39;s really wonderful, it&#39;s not really<br/>
curriculum, and there are tons of ideas, so you&#39;re certain to find one that<br/>
your son will enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

&gt; My 7 yo has gotten to a point where he has expressed a need for some<br/>
&gt; help learning basic math (for scorekeeping in games and managing<br/>
&gt; money, etc.). He has little confidence in this area. I am not sure<br/>
&gt; how to proceed to help him without turning him off to math concepts,<br/>
&gt; as has happened in the past. He doesn&#39;t like doing math on paper and<br/>
&gt; has a hard time calculating in his head because he says he can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; remember math facts. I thought he might like some program (Math-U-<br/>
&gt; See?) that uses blocks because he is very hands-on and enjoys<br/>
&gt; building with Legos. So, what do you do if a child asks for help in a<br/>
&gt; specific subject? I don&#39;t think it is anti-unschooling to provide<br/>
&gt; help through a special program as long as it has been requested. Any<br/>
&gt; suggestions for math?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course you can provide help and give suggestions : )!!  For learning about<br/>
money I would use real money.  Maybe play pretend store.  Make some<br/>
price tags, price some toys or food etc.  Give it some time, he may not<br/>
pick it up immediately.  My dd when first introduced to money just could<br/>
not understand that 4 quarters make a dollar or that five ones made a five<br/>
dollar bill.  Just play and introduce.  For scorekeeping if you are using <br/>
simple numbers try counting with small objects like legos or colored stones<br/>
or something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-372529695">When this happens to us I just comment that, gosh, we&#39;ve been <br/>
concentrating so much on other things we haven&#39;t worked much on <br/>
that/isn&#39;t it great that we can do that since we homeschool/blah blah <br/>
blah.<br/>
Frankly I figured out the truth of these statements when dd#2 cut 4 <br/>
teeth in 4 weeks and didn&#39;t learn to crawl until she was finished <br/>
with the tooth thing.  Funny how developmental things that seem so <br/>
obvious when you&#39;re around a baby (like fussing before a growth <br/>
spurt, doing 1 new skill at a time, etc.) slip my mind when dealing <br/>
with older children.<br/>
