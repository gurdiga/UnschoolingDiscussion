It could last a long time - the SIMS is very creative and is the equivalent <br/>

Would you feel the same way if they spent hour after hour with dolls, making <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175870866">Allison liked how you described the SIMS as an electronic dollhouse.<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking about how I would feel if they were playing with <br/>
dolls instead of SIMS.  I think the problem would be the same even if <br/>
it were dollhouse.  The problem is we are not doing many of the <br/>
things I have spent a lot of time and energy planning, researching, <br/>
going to the library and checking out.  I know they would enjoy what <br/>
I have gotten but the time just goes by.  The days just go by.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked them if they would set some time aside to do things with <br/>
me.  When I say &quot;tomorrow would you like to plant the lamb&#39;s ear we <br/>
started from seed&quot; and they say &quot;yes&quot; I will ask them when they think <br/>
they might like to do that.  I hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062363230">Pat, <br/>
Why do you think the stuff you have been planning is more valid a thing to<br/>
do than playing the SIMS or anything *they* have chosen to do? It sounds to<br/>
me that the time is being utilized in a pursuit of their choosing and hasn&#39;t<br/>
just &quot;gone by.&quot; Or am I missing something?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The other day Virginia asked me if she was preprogrammed to like <br/>
soccer.  I told her yes, she was just born that way.  She then asked <br/>
me if her friend Sammy was preprogrammed to show her how to play <br/>
soccer.  I told her no, that was opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
They have so so much time in a day.  Why can&#39;t we try to fit in a <br/>
little time for me to show them what I&#39;ve found?  Why is that so <br/>
harmful to their own pursuits?<br/>
<br/>
I agree that I have *not* been taking the right approach to introduce <br/>
them to what I&#39;ve found and I will make changes here but I&#39;m not <br/>
telling them they can&#39;t do anything they want to do.  In fact, they <br/>
do what ever they want when ever they want.  I sure would like a life <br/>
like that!  <br/>
