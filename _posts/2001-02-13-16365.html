I&#39;ve read a HP book to my 5 and 7 yo. They loved the first one so I must
really get around to reading the others. We&#39;re now doing The Hobbit.
<br>I hadn&#39;t heard of the game. Maybe when we move to the US we&#39;ll look
in to it.

Have you heard of/read &quot;Silmarillion&quot; by Tolkien?<br/>
It&#39;s like the prequel to the lord of the rings trilogy<br/>
and hobbit stuff.Kind of a creation account thing of<br/>
that world. It was published after he died, if I<br/>
remember right, and his son put it all together and I<br/>
really liked it, cuz in the back it also has (in<br/>
addition to the maps and stuff) a glossary of all of<br/>
tolkien&#39;s terms. (ex: kalen = green; gaer = sea)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-117226391">We have several of the &#39;earlier&#39; Tolkein stuff, Making <br/>
of Middle-Earth, The Silmarillion, other stuff, all to <br/>
do with the mythology and &#39;history&#39; of the elves and <br/>
Aragorn&#39;s ancestry, if you&#39;re into that kind of thing, <br/>
well I loved it.  Roll on December..<br/>
