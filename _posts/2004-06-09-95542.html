<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159835594">&quot;art: drawing, sculpting.... by the way Ren those creativity links of yours at <br/>
Sandra&#39;s site have been manna for my soul. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow Julie...I&#39;m glad you found them!<br/>
Wily Walnut is probably my favorite, if you haven&#39;t gotten to that one yet....I&#39;ve been emailing him for a few weeks, he&#39;s a really cool guy that is totally interested in learning more about unschooling.<br/>
He lives in England, and his son goes to a village school, with just a few kids in his class, and very open about what they learn.<br/>
<br/>
The creativity links will be linked to my page about the creativity workshop I&#39;ll be teaching. &quot;Awakening the Dragon&quot; is all about re-discovering the creative genius you were meant to be.<br/>
<br/>
If there are any creatives out there, or anyone that has forgotten they are a creative genius, check out a page of links just for you:<br/>

And I haven&#39;t finished putting it up, I&#39;m sorry.  The boys have a new online <br/>
video game so I&#39;ve been third to the computer for a couple of weeks, but you <br/>
should see the improvements in my YARD! &lt;bwg&gt;  This morning I have a day lilie <br/>
blooming (we&#39;ll have over 100 blooms this year on those) and morning glories <br/>
(if anyone wants seeds for next year, I will DEFINITELY have enough to share <br/>
around), and I have a tomato an inch across.  That&#39;s early, and I&#39;m happy.  I <br/>
put the plants in before the freezing was quite done and *duh* didn&#39;t cover them <br/>
at night (what was I not even thinking??) and they barely survived but they <br/>
did.<br/>
<br/>
So, Ren&#39;s stuff....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to announce here when more is in.<br/>

I love that site. Check it out everyone!! Especially the Leonardo da Vinci<br/>
article.<br/>
<br/>
I borrowed a book called Painting from the Source: Awakening your Artist&#39;s<br/>
Soul by Aviva Gold (who also leads workshops in creativity and healing).<br/>
Great book.<br/>
<br/>
One more week till I can go and get my supplies and then  get started. I<br/>
really want to get past my fears of failure and of painting something that<br/>
others won&#39;t find acceptable. Make it all about me and the process.<br/>
