<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423767461">Hi Debbie. I&#39;m half asleep right now as I just woke up from lying down to<br/>
get my daughter asleep and am going back to bed in a second, but I saw your<br/>
post and want to give you this recipe. We have been vegan for several years<br/>
now, before that vegetarian, and this is a recipe for Macaroni and Soy<br/>
cheese that I&#39;ve acquired along the vegan path. I don&#39;t&#39; know if I would<br/>
have thought this recipe as yummy if I were still eating animal cheeses, but<br/>
it is surely a vegan success. Also, I would suggest Rice Dream Organic<br/>
Original Enriched rice milk. It&#39;s what we all drink around here, and don&#39;t<br/>
have your don try it unless it is ice cold from the fridge, it&#39;s much better<br/>
that way.  For baking and hot cocoa we use Soy Dream enriched. There is an<br/>
egg replacer made by En-R-G (pretty sure that&#39;s the spelling) that comes in<br/>
a box a little larger and thinner than a cornstarch box. We use that for<br/>
baking. I also have a recipe for a tofu scramble that is great. Our house is<br/>
not completely refined sugar-free. My husband loves it in his coffee, the<br/>
kids and I  have honey in our tea. There are some recipes that I use<br/>
turbinado sugar for, which I believe is processed to a degree, and I let my<br/>
kids have some &quot;junk&quot;, but they are very aware and limit themselves due to<br/>
past experiences where they&#39;ve not felt well because I let them go all out.<br/>
I will also include a recipe for a cheesy-type spread we use for &quot;grilled<br/>
cheese sandwiches&quot;. Another hit here.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
