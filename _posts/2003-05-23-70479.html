<br/>
Six hundred and six takes it took, and if they had been force to do a<br/>
607th it is probable, if not downright certain, that one of the film<br/>
crew would have snapped and gone mad. On the first 605 occasions<br/>
something small,usually infuriatingly minute, went just slightly awry<br/>
and the whole delicate arrangement was wrecked.<br/>
<br/>
A drop too much oil there, or here maybe one ball-bearing too many<br/>
giving fraction too much impetus to the movement. Whirr, creak, crash,<br/>
the entire, card-house of consequences was a write-off and they had to<br/>
start again.<br/>
<br/>
Honda&#39;s latest television advertisement, a two-minute film called &quot;Cog&quot;, is like a fine-lubricated line of dominoes. It begins with a<br/>
transmission bearing which rolls into a synchro hub which in turn rolls into  a gear wheel cog and plummets off a table on to a camshaft and pulley wheel.  <br/>
<br/>
All the parts are from the new Honda Accord - £16,495 to you, guv&#39;nor,<br/>
or £6 million if you want to pay for the advertising campaign. And what an amazing  ad campaign it is, too.<br/>
<br/>
Back on Cog, things are still moving, in a what-happened-next  manner<br/>
redolent of &quot;there was an old woman who swallowed a fly&quot;. With a ting<br/>
and a ding of metal on metal, a thud of contact and the occasional<br/>
thwock,  plop and extended scraping sound, the viewer watches as<br/>
individual, stripped-down parts of car roll into one another and set off more reactions.<br/>
<br/>
Three valve stems roll down a sloped bonnet. An exhaust box is pushed<br/>
with just enough energy into a rear suspension link which nudges a<br/>
transmission selector arm which releases the brake pedal loaded with a<br/>
small rubber brake grommit. Catapult! Boing! On goes the beautiful<br/>
dance, everything intricately balanced and poised. Nothing must be even a sixteenth of an inch off course or the momentum will be lost.<br/>
<br/>
At one point three tires, amazingly, roll uphill. They do so because<br/>
inside they have been weighted with bolts and screws which have been<br/>
positioned with fingertip care so that the slightest kiss of kinetic<br/>
energy pushes them over, onward and, yes, upward. During the pre-shoot<br/>
set-ups, film assistants had to tiptoe round the set so as not to disturb the  feather-sensitive superstructure of the arranged metalwork.<br/>
<br/>
The slightest tremor of an ill-judged hand could have undone hours of<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
Utter silence, a check that the lighting is just right, and  &quot;action!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Scores of grown men hold their breath as the cameras roll. An oil can is tipped and glugs just enough of its contents on to a shelf that has been weighted with a Honda flywheel. Some valve springs rol into the oil and are slowed to a pace perfect to make them drop into a cylinder head assembly.<br/>
<br/>
If all these technical names are confusing, that is partly the point.<br/>
The advertisement was designed to show motorists all the fiddly little<br/>
bits of engineering that go into the modern Honda. The result, in this<br/>
film at least, is something approaching mechanical perfection <br/>
and a bewitching aesthetic. As car adverts go, it certainly beats the<br/>
&quot;Nicole!  Papa!&quot; school of commercial.<br/>
<br/>
If nothing else, Cog is a welcome departure from the generality of  car advertisements that feature winding-road landcapes, empty highways and clear blue skies. The absence of people from the commercial at least saved  Honda having to make any regional alterations. It will be able to be shown everywhere from Japan to South America, Finland to the Maldives, <br/>
without any more alteration than perhaps a change of the closing<br/>
voiceover, currently delivered by laid-back Garrison Keillor, the American author, who announces: &quot;Isn&#39;t it nice when things just work?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cog looks certain to become an advertising legend and part of its allure is the seemingly effortless way the relay of parts slide and touch and roll with such apparent ease. The reality of the film&#39;s production was slightly different. It was, by most measures of human patience, a nightmare.  Filming was done over four near-sleepless days in a Paris studio, after one month of script approval, two months of concept drawings and a further four months of development and testing. One of the more  surprising things about the ad is that it was not a cheat.<br/>
Although it would have been much easier to fiddle the chain of events by using computer  graphics, the seesaw and shunt of events really did<br/>
happen, and in one, clean take.<br/>
<br/>
The bigshots at Honda&#39;s world headquarters in Japan, when shown Cog for the first time, replied that yes, it was very clever, and how impressive trick photography was these days. When told that it was all real, they were astonished. One of the more striking moments in the film is when a lone windscreen wiper blade helicopters through the air, suspended from a  line of metal twine. &quot;That was the first and last time it worked properly,&quot; recalls Tony Davidson, of the London-based advertising agency Wieden &  Kennedy. &quot;I wanted it to look like ballet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After that, a few yards and several ingenious connections down the<br/>
assembly line, another pair of windscreen wiper blades is squirted by an activated washer jet. Because Honda wipers have automatic sensors that can detect water, they start a crablike crawl across the floor. It is as though they have come to life.<br/>
<br/>
As take 300 led to 400 which led to 500, a certain madness settled on<br/>
the crew. Rob Steiner, the agency producer, started talking about &quot;our<br/>
friends, the parts&quot;, but in the slightly menacing tone of a primary<br/>
school teacher discussing her charges at the end of a trying day. Some<br/>
workers on  the film went whole days without sleep and had to be asked<br/>
to stay away from the more delicate parts of the assembly. Others<br/>
started to have bad dreams about throttle activator shafts and bonnet release cables. When things were going wrong - a tire that kept trundling off to the left, or a rocker  shaft that kept toppling over like a tipsy cyclist -the production lads on  the shoot would start grumbling that &quot;the parts are being very moody today&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Commercial makers are often accustomed to working with human prima<br/>
donnas but no Hollywood starlet, no footballing prodigy or showbiz<br/>
celeb, was ever as troublesome and unpredictable as the con rods and<br/>
pulley wheels  and solenoids that Davidson, Steiner and Co had to work<br/>
with. Towards  the end of the production, Olivier Coulhon, the first<br/>
assistant director, had spent so many hours in the darkened studio that his skin had turned a  luminous green and his eyes had sunk deep into his Gallic cheeks.<br/>
Antoine Bardou-Jacquet, the commercial&#39;s director, kept puffing out his cheeks and whinneying, a note of deranged despair twitching at the<br/>
corners of  his mouth. Asked how long he had been working on the<br/>
commercial, he gave high-pitched giggle and replied: &quot;Five years? Or is it eight?&quot; It felt that long.<br/>
<br/>
Two hand-made pre-production Accords - there were only six in existence in the entire world - were needed for the exercise, one of them being ripped apart and cannibalised to the considerable distress of Honda engineers. By the end of the months-long production, the film had used so many spare parts that two articulated lorries were required to take them away.<br/>
<br/>
The idea for the advert derived partly from the old children&#39;s game<br/>
Mouse Trap, and from the wacky engineering of Caractacus Potts&#39;s<br/>
breakfast-making machine in the Sixties film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.<br/>
The corporate suits at Honda liked the idea immediately, despite the <br/>
high costs of production and the fact that it was more than twice as<br/>
long, and therefore twice as pricey, as normal car ads. The two-minute<br/>
version of the ad ran for the first time last Sunday during the<br/>
Brazilian Grand Prix, and brought pubgoers across the nation to a<br/>
wide-eyed speechlessness after  the Manchester United v Real Madrid game on Tuesday night.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It was a painstaking process, a tough experience,&quot; says  Honda&#39;s<br/>
communications manager Matt Coombe, recalling the making of  Cog. Some<br/>
of the original ideas, such as one stunt involving an airbag, had to be dropped owing to a shortage of new Accord parts or simply because  they were too hard to set up. And on some takes the process would go<br/>
perfectly until agonisingly close to the end. &quot;It was like watching a<br/>
brilliant footballer weaving his way the whole way through a defending<br/>
team&#39;s players, and then shooting wide right at the end,&quot; says Tony<br/>
Davidson.  The crew resorted to placing bets on which part of the<br/>
sequence would go  wrong. Invariably it was the windscreen wipers.<br/>
<br/>
When the final, 606th take eventually succeeded, there was a stunned<br/>
silence around the Paris studio. Then, like shipwrecked mariners finally realising that their ordeal was at an end, the team broke into a careworn  chorus of increasingly defiant cheers and hurrahs.<br/>
<br/>
Champagne bottles popped. The cylinder liner had brushed its  nose<br/>
affectionately against the rocker shaft and the gear wheel cog for the<br/>
last time. The interior grab handles and the suspension spring coils had done their bit. A classic was complete. Cog was in the can.<br/>

ramp.  Its either the 2nd or 3rd tire, it rolls up, tips the one in front of it, <br/>
rolls back down ( as physics rule)  THEN, it rolls back UP a bit..  Not the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-545394527">Just wondering if anyone read this letter in Dear Abby this morning:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/">http://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                      DEAR ABBY: I am an 11th-grade girl, and I need<br/>
                      your advice on what to tell my parents when my<br/>
                      report card comes in June. My GPA has dropped<br/>
                      big-time since the last one, and they have both<br/>
                      been nagging me to study harder.<br/>
<br/>
                      My mom and dad don&#39;t understand what it&#39;s like<br/>
                      for me at school.  Keeping my grades up has<br/>
                      become more difficult because I don&#39;t have the<br/>
                      motivation to immerse myself in the mandatory<br/>
                      curriculum. I have no need whatsoever for those<br/>
                      boring academic requirements.<br/>
<br/>
                      The one thing I&#39;m good at is art -- drawing and<br/>
                      painting -- and I can do that on my<br/>
                      own. Sometimes I wonder why I need high school<br/>
                      at all. I&#39;d love to have a break from it. How<br/>
                      can I clue my parents in to what I&#39;m all about,<br/>
                      Abby? -- FRUSTRATED TEEN IN VERMONT<br/>
<br/>
                      DEAR FRUSTRATED TEEN: I suspect your parents are<br/>
                      going to know what you are all about once they<br/>
                      see your report card. Every student, at one time<br/>
                      or another, has had the same feelings. But the<br/>
                      smart ones accept the reality that in order to<br/>
                      succeed and be independent, they must, at the<br/>
                      very least, have a high school (or equivalent)<br/>
                      diploma. The time to get it is now. So buckle<br/>
                      down in your senior year and lift your grade<br/>
                      point average. Art schools require well-rounded<br/>
                      students.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(my comments now):<br/>
<br/>
I was so disappointed to read the advice she gave this girl.  How I<br/>
wish someone would speak to teenagers like they are people capable of<br/>
independent thought!<br/>
<br/>
I wrote dear abby a letter and I suggested that perhaps this young<br/>
woman give herself the time to figure out what she would really like<br/>
to do, and whether or not high school is going to help her.  i said<br/>
that high school is something you can do later, and that many people<br/>
don&#39;t even have a high school diploma and they still pursue college.  i<br/>
suggested that art is something that calls you, and sooner or later if<br/>
it&#39;s what you&#39;re here to do, you&#39;ll have to do it.  how wonderful if<br/>
we can be helped to follow our dreams when we are young.<br/>
<br/>
i said that if she wants to do art, the best thing to do is develop<br/>
her studio practice, and that there are lots of resources outside of<br/>
high school that can help with this-- manuals on artist materials and<br/>
techniques, community art classes (which don&#39;t worry about grading<br/>
your work), mentorship with an artist you admire, and reading books<br/>
that artists wrote.  i said that there are lots of ways to support<br/>
yourself financially while doing art, and many of them do involve<br/>
taking an outside job and doing art in your free time, so why not deal<br/>
with that reality now, and take advantage of the fact that she can<br/>
probably still live with her parents at this young age?  i saw so much<br/>
of myself in this young woman, and so sad that the knee-jerk reaction<br/>
was: &quot;worry about your grade point average!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-611734341">Well, that was really cool, and it was great to read the article that went <br/>
with it.  Several years ago, WGBH (I think) produced a similar bunch of <br/>
footage; some guy or team of folks had gotten a grant to do this and it <br/>
involved chemical reactions and all sorts of physics and gravity.  It <br/>
looked like it was shot in an old warehouse and the film was called, &quot;The <br/>
Way Things Go.&quot;  My husband had gotten a copy of it (I believe it was <br/>
before our son Liam was born) and we just watched it with our jaws <br/>
slack.  It was so cool.  It&#39;s one of Liam&#39;s favorite things to watch (next <br/>
to Power Rangers, Spongebob, and Star Wars, that is).<br/>
<br/>
I have to confess that when we were watching this piece, Cog, and we <br/>
realized it was an advertisement at the end, we did give each other a <br/>
&quot;look.&quot;  But the truth is that many graphic artists and writers and <br/>
musicians get to earn a healthy income by doing their craft because of <br/>
advertising.  Of course, they have to deal with the wee little minds of <br/>
their clients and marketing folks, but maybe there&#39;s a great deal of <br/>
creativity in that!<br/>
<br/>
Marji, sleepy and rambling incoherently.  Sorry!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671678558">Hello all,<br/>
  I am new, just found you guys yesterday! This is just what I needed! We&#39;ve <br/>
been homeschooling for 12 years. Finding unschooling peers has been difficult <br/>
over the years. We never model after public school, just a little formal <br/>
instruction to get by. I am always saying we would do none if I could!! My oldest <br/>
is 17,dual enrolled at the local community college, it was good for the <br/>
experience of it. She proved to everyone that she was capable of it. Enough of the <br/>
classroom stuff, now she is off to the Bahamas for the summer on a 45 ft <br/>
schooner, kinda of a nanny job! I am jealous! I also have a 13 yr. daughter, 8 yr. <br/>
son and a special needs 5yr. son <br/>
  I wanted to say that someone is capable of becoming an artist, and really <br/>
making it in the world. My husband supports our family very comfortably. He <br/>
never went farther than H.S. but he always tells the story of sleeping in class <br/>
and the teacher telling him,&quot;he will never amount to anything&quot; and some one <br/>
pipes up and says &quot;teacher..he already makes more money than you&quot;! He was <br/>
airbrushing T-shirts in Daytona. He has gone on to be a very succesfull artist! He is <br/>
the biggest unschooling advocate I know!<br/>
   Hugs, Patti, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-94242621">Thanks for the welcome,<br/>
   I have beencomposing a letter to Abby ever since I read that yesterday <br/>
morning! Not that I think I could change her politically correct thinking! I <br/>
would really want to write that child stuck in a situation that looks pretty <br/>
hopeless from her perspective. I always wish I could hand out copies oF The teenage <br/>
Liberation Handbook!! My daughter has alot of friends that are now going to <br/>
the adult High School at the Community College instead of the public high <br/>
school. They needed out and we found other options for them. She wanted to look <br/>
into getting a diploma at the time, she wanted to go into psychology. A year <br/>
later, she has read every library book on the subject and taken the college <br/>
psychology class and the anatomy class, and I don&#39;t hear another word of it. She has <br/>
moved on. I think she isn&#39;t even interested in more free college <br/>
classes...but you never know what will pop up next!  She is extremely self motivated, I <br/>
don&#39;t direct her at all. She volunteers at the local karate school teaching <br/>
classes every day. She has no desire to move out in a few months when she turns <br/>
18, She knows that just being 18 doesn&#39;t make you ready for the world! I tell <br/>
them they are welcome to stay til they are ready to leave! Of course they will <br/>
have to be considerate of house rules even if they are 18. I couldn&#39;t stand to <br/>
worry all night where she was , but she is always being responsible and she is <br/>
always where she says she will be and home when I ask her to be. I think the <br/>
trick is too not lose that connection... the one homeschool affords, to be <br/>
involved and really care. The Mom that can&#39;t wait to get away from her kids will <br/>
not have that kind of connection! My children know without a doubt that I will <br/>
love them and be here(mentally) for them no matter what. <br/>
  Goin&#39; surfing, Hugs Patti<br/>

   This is the reason I was exploring the unschooling list. Max will be <br/>
kindergarten age and I have to keep a log for the co. superintenant. Boy, do I hate <br/>
it. Homeschooling all these years, now I have to try to write it down? Fl. <br/>
law..I get to the end of the week and go &quot;WHat DID we do Mon.??&quot; We have been <br/>
doing it all along, unschooling him. We quit all therapys very <br/>
early...surprise..he&#39;s mastering his skills just fine! I want to feel more relaxed with this <br/>
one, not pressured. I want to rip up every timetable on skills I see!!! Every <br/>
single skill has thrown us all  into whoops and jumping up and down. The writing <br/>
it down is my problem!!<br/>

Nobody.  Those columns take on a persona and invincibility and those writers <br/>
don&#39;t exist to be enlightened, but to reinforce the existing traditions and to <br/>
shame those who want to depart from the well-lit path.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180405932">We need that time at the beach! All that exercise and fresh air. My oldest <br/>
always reads, middle 2 get a really good work out and my youngest Max, with <br/>
Down syndrome runs miles, with nothing to trip on. He really wears himself out <br/>
and then plops and plays in the sand. We always come across something <br/>
interesting, that has washed up! Going to a play ground is not near as relaxing !<br/>

saying she wanted to do art.  I suggested some practical ways to move<br/>
in the direction of doing art for a living, if that is what she wants,<br/>
and I also recommended that she read the Teenage Liberation Handbook.<br/>
I wasn&#39;t expecting that much would come of the letter, but I asked<br/>
&quot;dear abby&quot; to forward it to her if possible! (tho i wasn&#39;t really<br/>
expecting that, either.)  it was good to do something about it to get<br/>
it off my chest!<br/>

<br/>
This is so encouraging to hear, that he supports a family earning a<br/>
living as an artist.  Would you be willing to share any art on-line?<br/>
You can send it to me privately if you prefer... I am just getting up<br/>
a web site to sell my art work.<br/>
