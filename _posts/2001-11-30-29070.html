<br/>
I don&#39;t know the years he lived, or brought his views into light... but <br/>
unschooling methods such as Summerhill was written about circa 1920.<br/>

Ancient Greek and Roman societys had universitys that followed <br/>
unschooling doctrinations. They learned via conversation and nothing else.<br/>

of many.<br/>

I just picked up a book of his three or four months ago and it was my <br/>
first introduction to a philosophy that I had been living for most my <br/>
life. <br/>

I suppose if we had all the literature written then we can put it in a <br/>
chronological order and see for ourselves where the ideas originated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Food for thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128762794">I believe unschooling has been around for millions of years.  It is the <br/>
most natural, human, and best way to learn.  It is only recently that <br/>
institutionalized, formal and structured education has come into <br/>
existence.<br/>
<br/>
What John Holt and A. S. Neil (was that his name?) and others did was <br/>
describe this natural process of learning and living.  They brought it <br/>
back for many of us.<br/>
<br/>
I am one of the people who had to read the books to see the light.  <br/>
Actually, I only had to read one of John Holt&#39;s books to be awakened.  <br/>
But, it was a learned thing.  There are people like Kolleen who know <br/>
instinctively and very naturally that this is just the right way to do <br/>
things.  How cool!!<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t think I&#39;m constantly going to books to see if I&#39;m doing the <br/>
right thing.  I follow my instincts and my intuition.  But John Holt was <br/>
definitely the spark for me.  He got me on the right track.<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank everyone on this list.  I&#39;m learning a lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-266064353">That&#39;s right.  Thanks.  I loan so many of my books out and half the time <br/>
I don&#39;t get them back.  Or, it&#39;s around here somewhere - and I just <br/>
couldn&#39;t find it to check the name.<br/>
