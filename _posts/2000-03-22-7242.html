<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588460803">Hi, all.  I am new to the list and new to the idea of unschooling.  My<br/>
son is just 2-1/2 and my husb. and I just recently realized that<br/>
unschooling is what we want for his &quot;education.&quot;  It was such a<br/>
&quot;lightbulb moment&quot; (as Oprah would say!) when I realized what this would<br/>
<br/>
mean for our son, our home life, our careers, and it just feels so<br/>
right.  I was never interested in homeschooling, i.e. following a school<br/>
<br/>
curriculum at home, but when I started thinking about unschooling I<br/>
realized that was really the alternative to education that I was looking<br/>
<br/>
for, but unable to articulate.  Thank goodness for the internet and for<br/>
all the wonderful resources and communities to help us think about<br/>
parenting in the 21st century!!  (I just had to stick that in there.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I know about Gatto (sp?) and Holt, but I was thinking of<br/>
ordering Linda Dobson&#39;s _Art of Education_ because it sounded<br/>
interesting - the subtitle is something like Reclaiming your Child, your<br/>
<br/>
Community, your Self??  Does anyone have insights about this book?  Do<br/>
you recommend it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any feedback,<br/>
Tiff</div>

Thanks, David, for your thoughtful and encouraging response.&nbsp; I&#39;m
looking forward to reading all of these books.&nbsp; And, of course, I
had already been directed to your book by friends on another parenting
discussion list :)

<p><tt>Linda Dobson&#39;s &quot;Art of Education&quot; is terrific. It will stretch you
in new</tt>

the</tt>
<br><tt>&quot;conditioning&quot; that takes place under the same name in schools.</tt>
<p><tt>I&#39;d also highly recommend Nancy Wallace&#39;s &quot;Child&#39;s Work: Taking
