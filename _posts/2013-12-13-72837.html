<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034922263">During one of the resent discussions about computer and tv time Alex listed a few web sites that her children enjoin playing. 
This was very helpful to me because I&#39;m not a player myself and my DD who is 4.5 is very interested in Reading Eggs but I didn&#39;t know what else I could show her that she would also enjoy. The Internet is so huge I am not even sure how I would google for sites she might like and I also don&#39;t have a lot of time looking through these sites. 
So I was wondering if it was possible to make a list of sites that members of this group found fun and interesting so I could offer these to my children as a starting point. 
Below is the list Alex wrote and my daughter tried the first two already and loved them.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-371076949">There is a great Facebook resource that you will like - the group My<br/>
Unschooler is Interested In...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on my phone so it&#39;s tough to link, but it shouldn&#39;t be too tough<br/>
to search and find on FB.<br/>
<br/>
You can post the interest and get links and ideas back, or better<br/>
still search the group archive for past links etc and get started at<br/>
once.<br/>
