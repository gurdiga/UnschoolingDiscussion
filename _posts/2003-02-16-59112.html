<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426721010"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;The information back that she was getting was fantatic, I could not <br/>
&gt;&gt;understand your reasoning for your response, genitic was ok, but the <br/>
&gt;&gt;modeling just didn&#39;t fit.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps next time you could just make that comment, with that tone and then <br/>
the conversation could progress rather than get quite so sidetracked. :o) I <br/>
personally thought the idea of modeling behaviors and attitudes and <br/>
reactions was a good topic to explore further. As I have said before, I am <br/>
always looking for ways to be more mindful of just what I *am* modeling for <br/>
my children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And if it was modeling behavior for instance after me or my husband, I <br/>
&gt;&gt;don&#39;t think I would have even wanted to share it with the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>group.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then you could have stayed out of the discussion and let others tear the <br/>
*idea* apart further. That&#39;s really what we do here. Someone will throw out <br/>
their own particular situation. We try to offer specific comments or advice. <br/>
But then we also continue to flesh out the underlying  ideology behind it <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
It works pretty well when we all remember to think of each poster as if they <br/>
were a friend chatting with us over tea. :o)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I find your use of words here rather difficult to grasp. Its one thing to<br/>
&gt; tear apart a subject, and another to tear apart ones skills as a parent.<br/>
&gt; If you are the Mary, that Teresa has written about. Than I will shall let<br/>
&gt; this die out right here and now.<br/>
&gt; And as a member of this group, I will respond when I so chose.<br/>
