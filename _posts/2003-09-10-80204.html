<div id="ygrps-yiv-877395711">&lt;&lt; But she needs help. She needs tips, ideas, and anecdotes. You can either<br/>
have your name included or not, as you prefer. She&#39;d love stories and ideas<br/>
from kids and teens, as well. If we can come up with at least 100 useable<br/>
tips and stories within the next month, she&#39;ll come to the conference.<br/>

I know this is a bit late but, one tip is to not limit their time following<br/>
their interests (or even express disdain at their interests).  My 11yo son<br/>
really enjoys his video games, and computer games to a lesser extent.  I<br/>
don&#39;t limit his time and it is amazing how much he is learning and where<br/>
this interest has taken him.  From the obvious reading component (the game<br/>
itself, game guides, magazines etc), to the math and logic skills often<br/>
involved in the game itself, regular discussions on plot and character<br/>
development (if I&#39;m not there he&#39;ll run to find me to tell me things that<br/>
have happened and connections he&#39;s made), learning from the game content<br/>
itself (tons of mythology in many of the games my son enjoys), it just goes<br/>
on and on.  I can add more to the list if you need.<br/>
<br/>
One cool story is from the SC conference.  When Jim Weiss was telling his<br/>
first story, the one about one of the labours of Hercules Joseph told me<br/>
what his favourite of the 12 labours was (as well as some of the others) - I<br/>
didn&#39;t know he knew anything about them!  He continued to tell me the<br/>
differences between the things Jim mentioned in his stories and what he had<br/>
learned from his games (I find the game developers take a lot of effort to<br/>
make game content true and to make all sorts of connections / interplay) and<br/>
what he has read following up on his interest in mythology (directly<br/>
developed from the games).  It was cool that Jim even mentioned how there<br/>
were many different versions of the stories and how he did a lot of research<br/>
to come up with his version.<br/>
<br/>
And related, we were camping a couple weeks ago with my kids and nieces and<br/>
I brought along a book &quot;The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter&quot; that I had just<br/>
bought.  I thought an opportunity may come up and I knew they all liked<br/>
Harry Potter.  After dinner one night I brought it out and started reading<br/>
excerpts (the books is set up as questions and answers).  Well, the<br/>
mythology Joseph knew and told us all related to what we were reading was<br/>
phenomenal!!  He would often finish the sentence I was reading.  And he<br/>
would connect it back to some of the games he enjoys playing.  And he would<br/>
connect the games to each other.  Even though the games themselves weren&#39;t<br/>
related, they were all drawing on the same mythological stories as their<br/>
basis, or maybe just for naming their characters and moves etc.  He was so<br/>
excited and kept explaining stuff to everyone (you have to understand that<br/>
he is typically a boy of FEW words).  We were all so enjoying ourselves I<br/>
brought the book in the tent with us and we continued until everyone else<br/>
had fallen asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, oh!!  One more along these lines.  After we had been unschooling for a<br/>
few months (he would have been 10) and he had been playing video games full<br/>
tilt (no homework and school to get in his way LOL!), I was lying in bed<br/>
with him one night as he was going to sleep and out-of-the-blue he said &quot;I<br/>
have always thought of myself as a video game guy.  But I only seem to like<br/>
one kind of video game, those based back in time with swords and spells and<br/>
battles.  Maybe I&#39;m a guy who likes those old times and I am just using<br/>
video games to learn about it!&quot;  I said &quot;yeah, maybe you&#39;re right&quot;, and then<br/>
laid back and marveled at his insight until I finally fell asleep.<br/>
<br/>
They will earn so much if you allow them the freedom to pursue their<br/>
interests, even if you don&#39;t think they are worthwhile, they are worthwhile<br/>
to the person pursuing them!<br/>
