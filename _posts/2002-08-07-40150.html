<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568811812">The Education Underground -- that&#39;s us, folks.<br/>
<br/>
I was once a ski instructor, among other things, in Aspen, CO. On Aspen<br/>
Mountain was a wonderful, enigmatic character named Ralph Jackson, who ran,<br/>
with tenuous permission of the skiing establishment in town, an enterprise<br/>
he called, The Underground Ski School. His was a different kind of skiing<br/>
from the usual brand of safety-first, correct positions, carefully carved<br/>
turns and balance. He was a flamboyant free spirit in a flowing black<br/>
fur-trimmed overcoat, top hat, baggy pants, cigarette holder and champagne<br/>
glass held high (no poles) -- a kind of chimney sweep circus act on skis --<br/>
who would, with his class in tow, swoop down the trails, often skiing<br/>
backwards, doing spins and one-legged jumps and turns with the other ski<br/>
high in the air. It was an unforgettably sight, an inspiration. Ralph was a<br/>
Harvard grad, and for me, he made being &quot;underground&quot; a thing to be admired.<br/>
We became friends.<br/>
<br/>
...now for my point, if you have another moment...<br/>
<br/>
In Japan, I&#39;m told, homeschoolers sometimes refer to themselves as<br/>
&quot;refusers.&quot; In England, the HS umbrella group is called Education Otherwise<br/>
(Luz and I get their newsletter). In Germany (remember Fascism)<br/>
homeschooling is not allowed -- all the children get government<br/>
indoctrination full time. In Venezuela, the president/dictator, Chavez, has<br/>
recently ordered that all schools, including all privates, teach a socialist<br/>
propaganda course exclusively for two months in the coming school year. As<br/>
we learn about how governments work, we see that there is a constant<br/>
struggle for citizens to be free, and we come to realize that oppressor is<br/>
mostly government and its varied, often diabolical, institutions.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is, and always will be, the enemy of government schooling.<br/>
That&#39;s because our goals are the exact opposite of the state&#39;s. The state<br/>
wants obedient, predictable clerks and soldiers and consumers. It&#39;s schools<br/>
take twelve years out of our lives in order to train us to become dependent<br/>
on it -- that&#39;s how long it takes to break the human spirit sufficiently to<br/>
change persons into &quot;economic units.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, homeschooling, and especially UNschooling, stands as a<br/>
fundamental break in those ranks of believers and supplicants at the trough<br/>
of state largesse. We don&#39;t buy it, even though we keep paying our share of<br/>
taxes that support it. Government indoctrination is not what we want for our<br/>
kids. We want them to be independent thinkers, creative individuals,<br/>
self-starters and questioners of all kinds of authority -- not part of a<br/>
groupthink outer-directed treadmill human resource sink.<br/>
<br/>
That independence for our kids and ourselves comes at a price -- every day.<br/>
It costs us our time in helping our children, and in justifying our practice<br/>
to the many doubters we encounter -- especially nagging family members. It<br/>
costs us money, obviously, since we accept both the expenses for our kids<br/>
and the taxes for the schools we wouldn&#39;t use even if they were free.<br/>
Another cost is the angst that always comes with being a rebel, a renegade,<br/>
an iconoclast, a - yes - revolutionary. Even though the path is uphill all<br/>
the way, by taking it we gain our dignity and self-confidence.<br/>
<br/>
We are a threat to the establishment. We reveal to them, to their shame,<br/>
that they are not necessary, superfluous. Not only that, but that children<br/>
can do better without them. We draw a line in the sand for them. Suddenly,<br/>
these days, the schools are being forced to question their policies,<br/>
methods, qualifications for employees, books, programs, the works. As our<br/>
numbers grow, so does the pressure on them to prove their worth.<br/>
<br/>
The problem for the schools is this: They can&#39;t prove that they are doing<br/>
what they claim. In fact, studies show that they are not only not doing it,<br/>
but are getting worse, more dangerous and coercive, and of less education<br/>
value all the time. Therefore, their only tactic is to try to make us look<br/>
bad. They demand interviews and send out a barrage of news releases that<br/>
(often falsely) tell of homeschooling parents who abuse their kids, even<br/>
kill them. They talk about the homeschooling experience not being<br/>
sufficiently &quot;rounded&quot; or &quot;real worldly&quot; even though it is school that is<br/>
the true limiting and synthetic experience for children and is totally<br/>
isolated (on purpose) from the &quot;real world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All the hoopla by the schools is designed to rally the public in their favor<br/>
and to intimidate homeschoolers and, with the goals of stopping our<br/>
dissenting voices and returning our children -- with the accompanying<br/>
funding -- to their buildings or at least their control. They will spend<br/>
virtually unlimited resources on those goals even while allowing their<br/>
schools to continue to fail their students, thus revealing that the school<br/>
system is nothing more than a huge jobs program that dumbs down the<br/>
population.<br/>
<br/>
We, homeschoolers feel the effect, like runaways, like escapees, like<br/>
naughty children, like risk-takers and &quot;bad influences.&quot; We are constantly<br/>
in the position of possibly needing to defend ourselves from the &quot;logic&quot; of<br/>
the government system. We are told by the establishment that we are<br/>
ill-equipped to educate our kids, not &quot;certified,&quot; not &quot;trained,&quot;  without<br/>
the &quot;resources&quot; that schools (presumably) have. They will, and do, say just<br/>
about anything to make us look inferior to them. They use all the power at<br/>
their disposal, even though they are the failure, not we.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling groups are ports in that storm, we need them for &quot;support&quot; as<br/>
they are for many groups of &quot;victims&quot; today. We are treated like the enemy,<br/>
so we need much mutual nourishment, just as slaves needed the underground<br/>
railroad with its safehouses.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to get paranoid, only to point out that we often feel as though<br/>
we are Davids on Goliath&#39;s turf. (but remember who won that one...)<br/>
<br/>
Knowing that countries like Germany (now our trusted &quot;friend and ally&quot;) can<br/>
eliminate such educational freedom as we take for granted (even though it<br/>
comes with its own restrictions in most states) makes us realize how<br/>
tentative is that freedom, how precious it is, and how far we have to go in<br/>
order to make it totally without limits. Courage, friends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407257058">Forgive me for being so chatty these last couple days, I know it&#39;s rude to <br/>
appear every year or so and just start yapping. But I can&#39;t help it! <br/>
<br/>
Mr. Vare, do yourself a favor and keep an eye out on C-SPAN today to see <br/>
blowhardism in action. As I was reading your great posts today, <br/>
Undersecretary of Education, Gene Hickock, was spewing about as much hot air <br/>
that the ozone can handle, to rally his troops at some sort of dinner or <br/>
lunch. Incredible. According to him, the whole course of history, nay, <br/>
HUMANITY, is at stake, and upon the shoulders of our public school teachers. <br/>
It&#39;s a big task, he readily admits, but the DOE will be there on the front <br/>
lines ensuring our collective salvation. I should remind you that he is a <br/>
&quot;big admirer of the Constitution and Bill of Rights.&quot; Indeed, just as Soviet <br/>
Dictator Andropov claimed to have been a big admirer of John Coltrane. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll retire to Bedlam.<br/>

<br/>
This isn&#39;t true of the majority of homeschoolers, if you include the <br/>
Christian homeschooling movement in the numbers.  If they are the enemy of <br/>
government schooling it is because they think schools should teach much LESS, <br/>
not more, and they believe schools should have corporal punishment and other <br/>
strict discipline.  So they take their kids home to do it right.  They want <br/>
obedient, predictable Christians, and they want the boys to go into politics.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We want them to be independent thinkers, creative individuals,<br/>
self-starters and questioners of all kinds of authority -- not part of a<br/>
groupthink outer-directed treadmill human resource sink.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The first half does not apply to those Christian homeschoolers.<br/>
The second half is more of the same strident anti-school rhetoric.<br/>
<br/>
So was that post just another previously published article?  Was it not <br/>
actually dialog with this list?  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This makes for an effective rallying cry to gather the troops against the<br/>
enemy who seeks to control or destroy us. But it doesn&#39;t line up with<br/>
reality in every state. Unless the people in the states where the state<br/>
isn&#39;t interfering with homeschooling *want* to believe they&#39;re being<br/>
attacked because they&#39;d rather believe some plot by the evil government made<br/>
them buy into the idea of public schooling as the be all and end all of<br/>
education rather than their own foolish selves. If they want to pass off the<br/>
blame that badly, they&#39;ll see boogy men all over the place. (And HSLDA is<br/>
really good at pointing out the boogy men!)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very comforting to be able to say &quot;I knew I wasn&#39;t at fault. It was<br/>
that evil entity that&#39;s out to control or destroy me. That&#39;s why this<br/>
happened.&quot; Hitler used the same tactic very effectively by pointing the<br/>
finger of blame at Jews and homosexuals and gypsies and other outsiders.<br/>
(His tactic was of course more effective by choosing a physical enemy rather<br/>
than a vague enemy.)<br/>
<br/>
Whether the control we see is caused by evil government or the collective<br/>
pull of a basic human nature that needs to control things (in varying<br/>
degrees in all of us) can&#39;t be proved either way. But personally I find it<br/>
more empowering to take responsibility for the choices I&#39;ve made rather than<br/>
blame it on some plot by powerful government forces. To examine why those<br/>
choices made sense at the time. To examine why they don&#39;t make sense any<br/>
more. (Or why they do make sense -- for different reasons -- for other<br/>
people.)<br/>
<br/>
Believing if we could get rid of evil government controlling us we&#39;d all be<br/>
happy and free is sort of like believing if we get rid of alcohol we&#39;ll all<br/>
be happy and free. Yes, that worked really well.<br/>
<br/>
Those of us who know/believe it&#39;s basic human nature to want to control know<br/>
that the &quot;enemy&quot; we fight is ourselves and human nature and we won&#39;t be<br/>
surprised when social control pops up anywhere anytime. It&#39;s human nature<br/>
and can only be battled one person at a time. (And only, of course, if that<br/>
person wants to battle it.)<br/>
<br/>
Painting government workers and those who support them with a broad brush of<br/>
evil may rally the troops against them but it won&#39;t make any inroads into<br/>
that group. It just turns the world into two camps: us good guys and those<br/>
bad guys.<br/>
<br/>
The other real &quot;enemy&quot; is fear of the unknown. I think it a far better (and<br/>
gentler) tactic to help people see that people are exploring and creating<br/>
pathways into the schoolless off-the-career-path territory. That way people<br/>
won&#39;t feel such a great need to huddle in masses (and make rules and<br/>
regulations!) to guard against the unknown.<br/>
