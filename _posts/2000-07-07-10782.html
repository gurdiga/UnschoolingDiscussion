<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291635827"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;On August 18 we will be hosting a homeschooling family from <br/>
&gt;Belgium, Christine [Mom],  Guillaume [Dad], Irene [Grandmother], <br/>
&gt;Kevin, Sophie and Carmen [ages 3 to 8 I think].   I just received an <br/>
&gt;email from Christine asking if I knew of anyone in the towns listed <br/>
&gt;below who would be willing to host their family for a night or two.  If <br/>
&gt;anyone is interested please email me so that I can pass your <br/>
&gt;name and email address on to Christine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Too bad they won&#39;t be in the Northwest.  We are 1.5 hours from Yellowstone, 1 hour from Grand Teton Natl. Park, and closer to lots of other really wonderful wild contry.  Opal digs (we&#39;re in the gem state after all,) Hot Springs, Bear World, Native American Reservations, Museums and Cultural Centers, and on and on.<br/>
