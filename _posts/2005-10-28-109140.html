&gt; now choosing to stay up very late (way past us guessing 3:00 a.m. or<br/>
&gt; so) and is sleeping past noon.  When we wake him for his horseback<br/>
&gt; riding lesson he is angry that he has been woken. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s only five.   He might not have the ability to plan for a horseback <br/>
lesson, so on those night when he has to go to a lesson, figure out how he can get <br/>
eight hours sleep.    But unless he really experiences exhaustion, he might <br/>
not believe you.   Sleepiness isn&#39;t as bad as arguing.   <br/>
<br/>
But as to waking him up, maybe start earlier and give him a warning that you <br/>
need to wake him up again in ten minutes if he falls asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it helps if there are good food smells or happy music.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Now dh and I are<br/>
wondering if we are doing the wrong thing allowing him to choose<br/>
when he is sleeping half the day and so cranky. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re seeing it as only two extreme options:   You control it or he <br/>
chooses.   <br/>
Nowhere in those two do I see principles at work instead of rules.<br/>
<br/>
Sleep has a purpose. <br/>
Commitments are important.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;rule&quot; shouldn&#39;t be he can stay awake as long as he wants to.   That <br/>
doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense, if he has somewhere to be the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
Keep discussing what needs to be done so he can help make GOOD decisions, and <br/>
not make his decisions simply on what feels good to him in that instant.<br/>
