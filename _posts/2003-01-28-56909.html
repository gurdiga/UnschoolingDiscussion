<br/>
Brenda&#39;s right.<br/>
I was repeating phrases without thinking. <br/>
<br/>
What I said was tacky and I would like to withdraw it (which I really can&#39;t, <br/>
but you know, kind of figuratively withdraw it.<br/>
<br/>
When she&#39;s WANTing to play more she will.  And the more she plays the better <br/>
she&#39;ll be, and the more confident she&#39;ll be, and if her lessons are fun <br/>
she&#39;ll like them and when they&#39;re not fun anymore she can do something else!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay, this happens about every time.  But, am I suppose to then give up the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, yes, yes.  When she comes to the piano, slide over, and once she&#39;s<br/>
play, leave.  Make a lame excuse if it makes you feel better -- oh, I better<br/>
go put the laundry in the dryer kind of thing.  But yes!  If you want her to<br/>
play more, be prepared to be evicted.  You can go right back when she&#39;s<br/>
tierd, right?<br/>
<br/>
As far as music to listen to together, go to a mall and peruse their<br/>
classical, jazz and new age sections.  All will have piano music.<br/>
<br/>
Your best bet on classical music is probably those $2.99 cd&#39;s that are all<br/>
in one little area.  Often by companies like Laserlight and Naxos, they<br/>
cover some of the most well-loved music in the world.  At that price, they<br/>
hafta sell lots of cd&#39;s to turn a profit, so it&#39;s generally all good stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, your piano teacher should be able to recommend stuff, too, but ask<br/>
particularly for non-classical things.  Jazz piano is COOL and fun to move<br/>
to, and New Age piano is different, too.  I find new age the easiest to<br/>
improvise; maybe it&#39;ll give your daughter some ideas.  Try George Winston or<br/>
something like that.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have fun with it.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks so much for the information on what kind of music to get and advice!<br/>
<br/>
Guess what my dd did yesterday?  I put the Suzuki cd in and just left it<br/>
playing. (My dh complained, but I said I needed to listen to it).  My dd<br/>
came out of her room and it was on, she didn&#39;t comment at all.  After about<br/>
an hour she asked me to turn it off.  I  asked her why she wanted me to turn<br/>
it off, and she said because she wanted to practice (I know, icky word).  I<br/>
turned it off and she played for a while.  Then she asked me to turn the CD<br/>
back on to a certain song.  I asked if she could tell me about what number<br/>
it would be,  she very casually said it was the first song in Book 2.  I<br/>
found it and she listened several times.  She then went and worked on it!<br/>
Yeah!  And I hadn&#39;t even mentioned that we were going to a lesson next week,<br/>
but I had played piano and listened to the CD.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure not everyday will go like this, but it sure was great!  Thanks for<br/>
the inspiration you all!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, she also started knitting a pair of socks yesterday.  Which is pretty<br/>
cool to me.  I have never knitted socks.  I did show her how to knit at<br/>
about seven years old, when she asked, and then bought her a knitting book.<br/>
She has learned lots from that and gone way beyond me!<br/>
<br/>
thanks again,<br/>
