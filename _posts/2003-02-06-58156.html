<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656187579"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Can you tell me what you did<br/>
&gt; today?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 15 year old son got up around 10, cleaned his room, and took the bus to<br/>
town with his bike.  There, I assume he&#39;ll go &quot;urbing&quot;, which is finding<br/>
places to jump his bike up onto and ride or going over jumps or whatever he<br/>
can find.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Can  you tell me your definition of unschooling?  Do you use any workbook<br/>
 </span></blockquote>at<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; all or is that what unschooling is all about?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the child chooses the workbook while having lots of other choices, yes.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Right now my oldest just wants to read his Garfield comic books or watch<br/>
 </span></blockquote>TV<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or listen to the radio or play on the computer or go sledding.  ANYTHING,<br/>
&gt; but &quot;school&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So get rid of &quot;school&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So I thought, well maybe he&#39;s stressed by the workbooks, so we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; cut some out of our day.  No change in him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course not, if you only cut out *some* of the workbooks.  That&#39;s not<br/>
unschooling.  Until you get rid of &quot;school&quot; and let him get over it, he&#39;ll<br/>
still be doing whatever he can to avoid &quot;school&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Pretend it&#39;s summer vacation.  What would you and your kids be doing?  Go do<br/>
those things.  Watch what catches their interest, and find ways to give them<br/>
access to more of whatever it is, even or even especially if it&#39;s TV, games,<br/>
or comics.  Help them find the connections between their current interests<br/>
and the rest of the universe.  Pay attention to what floats past you in your<br/>
life and send some of it their way.  They&#39;ll find their interests and<br/>
passions, but it rarely ends up looking like school.  I spent about the<br/>
first nine years of what I thought was unschooling watching for behavior<br/>
that looked like school.  I rarely found it and became quite frustrated.  It<br/>
wasn&#39;t until finding this list and paying attention to what the most<br/>
experienced people were saying that I stopped looking for school.  I know<br/>
that&#39;s hurt my son, and now I&#39;m trying to make up for it by &quot;really&quot;<br/>
unschooling.  &lt;g&gt;  Hopefully you&#39;ll see the light earlier than I did.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think he&#39;s just<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; taking this being home thing for granted and needs a dose of what it could<br/>
&gt; be like!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like a dose of school?  You *want* him to take being home for granted, as in<br/>
&quot;this is how we live&quot;.  Get rid of the school stuff and just live your<br/>
lives.  You&#39;ll all be happier, and your kids will end up with exactly the<br/>
right education for each of them.<br/>
