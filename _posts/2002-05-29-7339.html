<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127794620">Because I posted a link to my SCA pages, I went to clean them up, and <br/>
checking links, I came to a couple of cute bits I thought I&#39;d share with some <br/>
bright people!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From Swami Beyondananda&#39;s monthly newsletter, which I just subscribed to this <br/>
morning:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Humorologists report a sharp <br/>
increase in jestive disorders, from mild irregularhilarity to full-<br/>
blown humorrhoids. Well, no need to worry about worry, or stress over <br/>
stress anymore! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This one was linked from a zen humor page, and although the sound is messed <br/>
up on it, after clicking that you want your computer to match by latitude and <br/>
longitude and global positioning correct time, blah blah, this comes on:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Official Zen-Buddhist Nuclear Clock Calibrator and<br/>
Global Positioning System Synchronometer<br/>
Satellite uplink established.<br/>
Time confirmed<br/>
Location confirmed<br/>
Directing audio transmission to<br/>
default output channel.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And the audio, though messed up, said  &quot;The time is now.  The place is here.&quot;</div>
