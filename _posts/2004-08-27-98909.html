<div id="ygrps-yiv-867442983">Thank you all so much for your advice and support! I feel much better <br/>
already! I don&#39;t want to take up a lot of list space with personal <br/>
responses, but I do have a couple comments below:<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  My VERY shy dd (9) (never could have imagined this a couple years ago and<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s still hard to believe a year later) entered her cat in a pet show last<br/>
&gt;fall and stood up in front of a dozen or 20 people and read some notes about<br/>
&gt;her pet.  (same kid who wouldn&#39;t read in front of anyone for several years.)<br/>
&gt;Then she answered questions from the group.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>WOW.  I have seen my son GRADUALLY talking to others more and more. Used to <br/>
be that when anyone said hi or asked him a question, he would just hide his <br/>
face or look at me. I encouraged him to answer, but ultimately answered for <br/>
him. Sometimes people would say to him &quot;Are you being shy?&quot; and I would <br/>
immediately dispel that because I don&#39;t want him thinking of himself as <br/>
&quot;shy.&quot; Lately (last few months) he has started cautiously answering <br/>
people&#39;s questions and having conversations with people we see in our <br/>
homeschool group, etc.<br/>

&gt;not normal or healthy for him to be so dependent on you.&quot;  Blah, blah blah.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly.  And now that I am expecting another baby, they tell me how much <br/>
&quot;trouble&quot; I am going to have because Logan won&#39;t be the center of my <br/>
attention anymore. Ugh.<br/>

&gt;indeed?!  What if she learned instead that she could stay at home<br/>
&gt;and play with mom and her two younger sisters and be happy and safe<br/>
&gt;and that her mom and dad would never force her into a room full of<br/>
&gt;strangers and then walk away, telling her all the while that &quot;it&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;be okay, honey&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks Carmen. You hit the nail right on the head. I hear this from my <br/>
family ALL THE TIME. They think &quot;I don&#39;t live in the real world&quot; if I am <br/>
raising my child to believe he actually can control his own life and destiny.<br/>

&gt;with each child, and there are a bunch of kids who are<br/>
&gt;not allowed to talk to each other.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband and I both had a great chuckle at this comment, Sarah!  It was a <br/>
*duh* moment for me. Of course, you are right. And why should children <br/>
*need* to learn this sort of &quot;interaction?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again everyone!<br/>

You never know. Yes, you&#39;ll be holding the baby a lot, and your son <br/>
will still be able to snuggle with you, talk to you, etc. so he may <br/>
be happy to have a bunch of down time with you! <br/>
<br/>
And regarding starting a sport at a later age, I have a couple <br/>
experiences with that. With tennis, I actually had an advantage over <br/>
my friends who had been playing a long time: I&#39;d watched tennis so <br/>
much on tv that I knew what I should be doing. They&#39;d get so mad when <br/>
I&#39;d hit the ball exactly where they weren&#39;t! Fortunately for our <br/>
friendships, my aim wasn&#39;t great so I&#39;d miss a lot, lol.<br/>
<br/>
I also joined a swim team when I was about 13. I had no problem with <br/>
the swimming, but there were social aspects that were harder to pick <br/>
up. It did not help that most of the kids&#39; moms were at home while <br/>
mine were at work and that most of their families had known each <br/>
other for years. When they needed a ride to a meet, they knew who to <br/>
ask, whereas I was kind of lost. Kids aren&#39;t necessarily good at <br/>
answering questions, so without a parent asking the other parents how <br/>
stuff worked, I was often confused! <br/>
<br/>
I think that could be avoided if your son goes into it knowing <br/>
there&#39;s more to learn about being on a team than just the sport.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just wanted to add that most people come out of a class orientation. Many, many adults <br/>
still believe that they have to take a class to learn something. Many aren&#39;t content with the <br/>
company of their own families.<br/>
<br/>
To be a content person in your own home is a rare gift indeed that can be continued for a <br/>
lifetime. To enjoy one&#39;s own company and to want to be with the people you live with - <br/>
well that&#39;s a dream come true.<br/>
<br/>
I have a ten year old boy (we have five kids) who has no interest in classes. He has only <br/>
recently joined a team sport of his choice. And he just started playing Magic cards at the <br/>
local gamers shop by going with his older brother. This is a child who has never wanted to <br/>
be without me or take anything resembling school (even home school co-op classes).<br/>
<br/>
We spend all day every day together. He said to me just yesterday, &quot;You are the best <br/>
mother in the world.&quot; He hugged me for five long minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm. Real world experience he hates? Or deep security and affection for his mother?<br/>
<br/>
Tough choice...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060665038">Wanted to comment that our kids have all started sports at late ages. I have a son who had <br/>
never played a single team sport until he joined lacrosse as a 15 year old (a high school <br/>
team, no less). He had never played lacrosse and had never even played soccer or hockey <br/>
or any sport resembling it. He was an indoor rock climber. :)<br/>
<br/>
His first year was challenging, but he scored a goal and his second year, he was as good as <br/>
most of the team. It shocked me that he could learn a totally new sport at that age after all <br/>
the other guys had played sports their entire lives. <br/>
<br/>
He did the same thing with piano. He started at age 12 and by 13 was as good as the rest <br/>
of the 13 year olds.<br/>
<br/>
My next son started soccer this year for the first time. Soccer! These kids have been <br/>
playing since age six. Guess what? He&#39;s fine. He&#39;s not the best, but he&#39;s right in there. His <br/>
size, increased coordination as an older kid and the fact that he wants to be there make <br/>
him a solid member of the team.<br/>
<br/>
My 10 year old starts lacrosse last year as a 9 year old having never been on a sports team <br/>
in his life either.<br/>
<br/>
My 14 year old daughter started colorguard (flags) this year having not done anything like <br/>
that in her life. She played soccer as a 9-10 year old and hated it.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few examples to encourage you. As I say to my kids, &quot;Try it! If you enjoy it, you&#39;ll <br/>
catch up in no time.&quot; So far, it&#39;s proved true.<br/>
<br/>
(And their coaches love them because they are so excited to be there, not bored and <br/>
restless and sick of soccer, or lacrosse or whatever.)<br/>
