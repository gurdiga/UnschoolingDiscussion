The Deafening Sound of Silence<br/>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
Ann: What does it mean when a high impact homeschooling bill is <br/>
introduced in a state legislature and no one seems to be talking <br/>
about it? From South Carolina, here&#39;s the bill.<br/>
<br/>
Headline: Proposed Legislation SC (Reimbursement), by Rep. Davenport, <br/>
March 19, 2003<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lpitr.state.sc.us/sess115_2003-2004/bills/3821.htm">http://www.lpitr.state.sc.us/sess115_2003-2004/bills/3821.htm</a><br/>
Currently residing in the House Committee on Education and Public Works<br/>
BILL H. 3821 &quot;If a student is home schooled in the manner provided by <br/>
law, his resident school district annually shall reimburse his <br/>
custodial parent or parents or legal guardian for the cost of his <br/>
home schooling which is defined as one hundred percent of the <br/>
district&#39;s per pupil expenditure determined by the State Department <br/>
of Education based upon the Education Finance Act weightings.&quot; <br/>
SECTION 2. This act takes effect upon approval by the Governor.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ann: If I read this bill correctly, an equal number of SC dollars <br/>
will follow every SC student, whether they are educated in public <br/>
school or at home. That seems controversial to me, yet I can&#39;t find <br/>
any discussions. Why?<br/>
What do SC homeschoolers think about this bill?<br/>
Why would the state want this bill to pass?<br/>
What do South Carolina taxpayers think about this use of tax $$?<br/>
Does the Department of Education support or oppose this bill and what <br/>
are their reasons?<br/>
By accepting state $$, would homeschoolers bring themselves under &quot;No <br/>
Child Left Behind?&quot; Home School Legal Defense Association supports <br/>
this bill without comment - why?<br/>
Juicy carrots such as this bill are often followed by the stick of <br/>
stricter regulations - is the intent to scoop homeschoolers back into <br/>
the public system within five or ten years?<br/>
What about homeschoolers who don&#39;t want the state&#39;s $$? Do they <br/>
become exempt from following regulations?<br/>
Am I the only one with questions?<br/>
Or is this one of those token bills that is meant to die in <br/>
committee, so nobody cares?<br/>
Somebody say something - the silence is giving me a headache.<br/>
<br/>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&quot;The State Should Know&quot; - Or Should It?<br/>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
Ann: Don&#39;t you just love it when folks use a position of authority to <br/>
pontificate about what &quot;the state should know&quot; and expect that <br/>
statement to stand as a fact? Co-director Plank&#39;s opinion that &quot;the <br/>
state should know&quot; is just that: his opinion. From the slant of the <br/>
article, though, I&#39;d guess that the reporter has fallen under the <br/>
spell of authority and taken the opinion as fact.<br/>
<br/>

Headline: Homeschooled kids elude state<br/>
Subhead: MSU report says over 200,000 students not accounted for in data.<br/>
LANSING -- &quot;A Michigan State University report released Tuesday <br/>
suggests there are thousands of children being homeschooled in <br/>
Michigan that state education officials don&#39;t know about. Parents in <br/>
Michigan aren&#39;t required to tell the state they&#39;re teaching their <br/>
children at home. David Plank, co-director of the Education Policy <br/>
Center at Michigan State and one of the authors of the report, said <br/>
the state should at least know who is being homeschooled.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
Secretaries of Education and Homeschooling<br/>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
Ann: A former Secretary of Education is making big news of interest <br/>
to homeschoolers. Now I admit I am a little green - I could really <br/>
use a cool $20M to promote homeschooling as I think it should be <br/>
promoted, a joyful route to family living and personal freedom, <br/>
success, and responsibility. The first thing I&#39;d do is pop off a <br/>
couple of checks to the homeschooling groups in states like Ohio that <br/>
are being targeted by Bennet&#39;s K12. Anyway, here&#39;s the story.<br/>

Headline: Bennett-run startup gets $20M<br/>
&quot;Entrepreneurs in the education sector could take a lesson in <br/>
fundraising from former U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett. <br/>
While private investment in for-profit education startups has plunged <br/>
lately, K12 Inc., an education company led by Bennett, has wrapped up <br/>
a $20 million round of financing. K12 announced Wednesday, April 2, <br/>
it completed the round led by Constellation Ventures of New York with <br/>
participation from several undisclosed private individual and <br/>
institutional investors.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

Ann: Current Secretary Rod Paige is in the news too, following a <br/>
Baptist Press interview. Although it is not at the center of the <br/>
controversy, I&#39;ll quote a sentence that mentions homeschooling.<br/>

Headline: TRANSCRIPT: Interview with the Secretary of Education<br/>
Paige quote: &quot;A child should be free to -- a parent should be free to <br/>
select a school that best meets that child&#39;s needs, whether it&#39;s <br/>
private or whether it&#39;s public or whether it&#39;s a cyber-school or <br/>
whether it&#39;s home schooling or whatever.&quot;<br/>
The interview has generated controversy all over the country. Some of <br/>
that discussion as it relates to homeschooling can be found at the <br/>
NHEN Forums.<br/>

Headline: Legislators Delay Home-Schooling Bill<br/>
&quot;LITTLE ROCK -- Surrounded by dozens of home-schooled children, a <br/>
legislative panel decided to punt Thursday on a measure that would <br/>
have given the Department of Education broad authority over home <br/>
schools. The matter was referred for interim study, meaning it will <br/>
be discussed by the House Education Committee in the months leading <br/>
up to the 2005 legislative session.&quot;<br/>

appear to lower compulsory attendance age for our children. <br/>
...Removing funding for children&#39;s services and requiring them to <br/>
leave their homes at younger and younger ages will not strengthen the <br/>
American populace. It will create a nation of sheep who cannot think <br/>
for themselves but only follow whoever happens to be leading them.&quot;<br/>

grandchildren - can homeschool with the greatest freedom possible? <br/>
