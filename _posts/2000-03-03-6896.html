<div id="ygrps-yiv-162582511">My soon-to-be 3 year old was the same way about not leaving my side or <br/>
letting me out of his sight.  He began on his own to spread his wings a tiny <br/>
bit after the arrival of his baby brother at age two.  Now, he is very <br/>
accepting of me leaving him with Dad for  a WalMart run or a short period of <br/>
time to relax alone (is that possible?).  The real problem is when we leave <br/>
them (which we may only do 2-3 times a year-and this is possibly the <br/>
problem) for a few hours with Grandparents.  He becomes exceptionally moody <br/>
and clingy the next day after the &quot;date night&quot;. I always feel awful!  I <br/>
don&#39;t know if this helped any, but I&#39;ve been there!<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt; I could not agree with you both more.  I have my little ones at home and<br/>
&gt;they are doing just great.  I think it is so vitally important for them to<br/>
&gt;form those bonds and relationships at home well and strongly before they <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;thrust out into the larger culture to fend for themselves in social<br/>
&gt;situaitons. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;I agreee with you all about this and have no intention of putting my 16mo <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;Mommy&#39;s-day-out as people keep insisting I should. I will take her to mom <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;me in the park, but that&#39;s for me to meet moms, not for her to meet <br/>
&gt;toddlers.<br/>
&gt;Having said that, am I the only one who is sometimes overwhelmed by the<br/>
&gt;strength of that bond? I rarely get a break, not even a shower by myself,<br/>
&gt;unless she&#39;s sleeping. She will not stay with her dad and let me walk out <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;the room, although they&#39;re fine together if I can sneak out without letting<br/>
&gt;her see me go. If she sees me leaving for a run,a shower, a nap or whatever<br/>
&gt;she totally loses it. She has always been this way so it&#39;s not a separation<br/>
&gt;anxiety phase. I really appreciate the chance to be home with her, because <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;couldn&#39;t with my older daughter when she was this age, but I would<br/>
&gt;occasionally like to leave her with her dad and not have to sneak out of my<br/>
&gt;own house.<br/>

doing now. I&#39;m a SAHM, nowhere to go, nothing much to do, and it&#39;s still<br/>
cool out so I don&#39;t really need to shower often. But once summer hits,<br/>
we&#39;ll have to figure something out. Maybe I can at least take baths with<br/>
her in the big tub :-) (instead of her itty bitty baby tub). <br/>

Just a thought but I bought one of those hand-held gadget things for our<br/>
shower and placed bubs on the floor of the shower so she could control where<br/>
the water went!! I think the feeling of power as she sprayed Mom and the<br/>
dopey dog and the floor helped get her over her fear!!<br/>

Well, in response to Gayle who takes showers when the kids are in bed,<br/>
that won&#39;t work for me either. She sleeps with us :-) dd does not sleep<br/>
well on her own yet. If I leave her, she&#39;ll wake up, so I&#39;m pretty<br/>
limited in that department too :-)<br/>

affectionately) called Dopey :-) He&#39;s on the big side. Dumb, big and<br/>
lovable. <br/>
<br/>
We have one of those hand held things that goes over the faucet but it<br/>
keeps popping off. But that is a good idea. We could install a real one.<br/>
Except don&#39;t you get a pool on the bathroom floor? I&#39;m trying to teach<br/>
Bridget that &quot;water stays in the tub&quot; but some days I wonder if I should<br/>
simply throw away the soggy floor mats and just let her dump water all<br/>
over the tiles. Of course dh wouldn&#39;t be amused when water started to<br/>
drip in the kitchen below, lol! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well Shannon, I take showers during naptime, or when Daddy is home to watch the kids.  As to taking your DD in the shower, kids always dislike it when they are not used to it.  My littles shower with us all the time and have a lot of fun with it, but she will get used to it if you persist and take it nice and easy and make it fun.  Sometimes I will see the kids safe in the adjoining room to the shower, close the door so they can&#39;t run off, and take a quick one with the bathroom door open so I can hear and see them.  That&#39;s when I&#39;m desperate for a shower and they are up and running and dad&#39;s not home.  Also this is sometimes the case when one wants to go in with me and the other does not.<br/>
