<br/>
Welcome!  I&#39;m new here too (about 2 weeks).  Thanks for the explanation of<br/>
&quot;demon.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now can you tell me what hth means?<br/>

We got a trampoline, 14 ft diameter, this fall.  I was really proud of the 3<br/>
boys (12, 10, and 8 yo)  because they saved all summer until they had enough<br/>
to pay for it (about $150. at WalMart).<br/>
<br/>
We have no guard, and we did set some &quot;rules&quot; for use.  I prefer one on at a<br/>
time, but two can bounce each other if they are using controlled bouncing<br/>
(not letting themselves go everywhere, but staying close to one spot.)  They<br/>
can all three get on at one time, but then only one can be standing up.<br/>
They&#39;ve made up games, like &quot;popcorn&quot;, where the stander jumps and the<br/>
others are bounced by him.  If someone wants to do tricks the other two sit<br/>
on the blue edge (it covers the springs) or get off.  I don&#39;t ask  them to<br/>
get off completely because they prefer taking turns after each person does a<br/>
trick, rather than waiting a longer time for their turns.   I told them they<br/>
could use a timer and agree on a length of time, like 5 or 10 minutes per<br/>
turn.  But they didn&#39;t want to wait that long.<br/>
<br/>
Within a month they were all able to do various drops, twists, and flips.<br/>
All will now do a full forward flip, though 8yos and 10yos land on their<br/>
rumps or knees.  12 yos now lands it on his feet about 90% of the time.   10<br/>
yo is close.<br/>
Here in western VA we&#39;ve already had more snow this season than for the past<br/>
2 -3 together.  Plus rain.  So they haven&#39;t been out much recently.  I think<br/>
when spring comes they will be doing even more.  They are all pretty<br/>
fearless and want to do back flips.  12yos is working on a 180 twist- flip<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
My 20yod was nanny last year for a family that had the protective screen.<br/>
She said it gave her and the mom some peace of mind that the girls there<br/>
wouldn&#39;t fall off.  On the other hand, she said that because the screen was<br/>
up the 8 yo would be wild, bouncing all over w/o control and even up against<br/>
the screen a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll get the screen - I like watching the boys!<br/>

Thanks for the input. My 5dd is trying to save for hers too. She wanted<br/>
to raise chickens to sell eggs, but the darn chickens are eating their<br/>
own eggs(that&#39;s another story), so it is taking her longer than expected.<br/>
We will pay the difference, most likely about 95% of the cost, but I<br/>
admire her for trying. <br/>
As far as the net goes, the ones that I&#39;ve seen are fully transparent. I<br/>
have not seen any that you couldn&#39;t see the children through. I kind of<br/>
like the idea of the net, not just for safety reasons, but because they<br/>
are great to keep balls on the trampoline too. At their friends house,<br/>
they play jumping soccer and stuff, and use the net for the rebound. They<br/>
also play the popcorn game with a bunch of balls on it. The net prevents<br/>
them from having to get down and chase the balls constantly. But it is a<br/>
lot more expensive w/ the net. We will wait and see.<br/>

Around here popcorn is played with a ball.  They throw the ball on the tramp and then bounce and keep the ball from touching them.  There are all kinds of more specific rules, but I&#39;m sure your kids will make up their own!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep, my kids play &quot;popcorn&quot; like that too.. Sometimes they curl up in a ball <br/>
to be bounced by the popper.  They also play &quot;stunt man&quot;  They come up with <br/>
some sort of scenario, for instanance, getting blowed off of a motorcycle by <br/>
an explosion, then they &#39;act&quot; it out.. Its so creative and funny to watch <br/>
too.  <br/>
