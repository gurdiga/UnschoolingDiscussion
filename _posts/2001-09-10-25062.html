&gt; didn&#39;t want to stop working on the &quot;scope&quot; he is making for his BB gun so he<br/>
&gt; stayed home.  The little guys (4, 2, 2) had no option but to go.  Nobody<br/>
&gt; complained, everybody pitched in but on the way home Marsie asked to go down<br/>
&gt; a certain hilly, curvy road.  I actually just wanted to go home and this<br/>
&gt; road takes us a little out of our way......but the little kids loved it and<br/>
&gt; they had really been part of the Stauffer team this am....so down the hills<br/>
&gt; we went, complete with hands in air and squealing.<br/>

the three little children and a goat in the car...this is either inherently <br/>
interesting enough, or a special kind of hell for the mom involved. :)<br/>
