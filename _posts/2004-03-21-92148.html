<div id="ygrps-yiv-457843297">Thanks for the prompt response Kelly, Rue and Pam!  We watch a lot of <br/>
Scooby around here, so the misspell was totally understood as <br/>
proactive!  To answer your question, we live about an hour south of <br/>
St. Louis, MO. I checked out the site Rue suggested.  Looks really <br/>
interesting.  I am hoping to get a few families going out here in the <br/>
boonies so I don&#39;t have to drive so far for the St. Louis group <br/>
activities.  I participate in a St. Louis group and had found a <br/>
family that was in the southern suburbs, but they moved!  So instead, <br/>
I&#39;m shifting my focus.  My girls are old enough to help out too!  And <br/>
as for showing up at functions by yourself, Pam, 90% of the <br/>
activities we&#39;ve done in the past 10 months have been just us.  My <br/>
13yo dd even tried getting her friends together on a Saturday <br/>
afternoon for a matinee recently and 4 of the 6 invited dropped out <br/>
at the last minute.  It ended up being like a DATE!  Oh well, we <br/>
still plan the activities cuz they are so fun!  Just need to take all <br/>
this wonderful info and get moving on it!</div>
