 Why wouldn&#39;t you treat an anonymous person in e-mail with the same<br/>
 consideration and respect as you would your child?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is this a serious question?<br/>
I mean really, do you treat other people with the same patience, love and <br/>
care that you do your own children?<br/>
It&#39;s not disrespectful to say &quot;that isn&#39;t unschooling&quot; on an unschooling <br/>
board.<br/>
It IS disrespectful to come onto a board and whine about the advice being <br/>
given.<br/>
<br/>
Let me give you an example of MY typical week in regards to helping newcomers.<br/>
I run a support group, get between 1-3 families each week calling for <br/>
information, emailing for help and showing up at our support group needing <br/>
their hand held.<br/>
I help them understand FL law, how to meet it, where to get more information, <br/>
I haul supplies, books etc... to our resource day every Wed., print <br/>
brochures, attend local meetings, set up dates at the local health food co-op <br/>
to promote unschooling, plan our mini-conference for this fall and THEN come <br/>
here and to a couple other spots to promote unschooling on the internet.<br/>
Oh, and we have our groups website which I add things to (via LeeAnn), and I <br/>
write about unschooling!!!<br/>
<br/>
Every month or so, some new person comes along, gets some advice that <br/>
apparently upsets them and starts in about how we shouldn&#39;t post this way or <br/>
that way, how the &quot;old timers&quot; (which I don&#39;t consider myself yet) are rude, <br/>
how we should be more gentle....yadayadayada....<br/>
BUT, the thing that got me to let go of all that school CRAP, was the blunt, <br/>
useful information given by the folks here.<br/>
Sure, I had a hard time digesting a lot of it. I questioned and got my <br/>
feathers ruffled, but I NEVER told them they should quite posting a certain <br/>
way or change the board to suit my needs.<br/>
That is the problem.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen the folks here answer question after question after question, <br/>
process the same ideas over and over and over for YEARS (in addition to <br/>
helping local people daily) and never flag in their devotion.<br/>
If someone has a problem asking questions, I say that is a personal issue.<br/>
The only time you&#39;re going to get your ideas jumped on is if you&#39;re defending <br/>
stuff that is not unschooling.<br/>
Questions get answered over and over with nothing short of patience.<br/>
Defense of schoolish crap or disrespect to kids will get dissected readily.<br/>
That&#39;s what this list is FOR!!!<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
