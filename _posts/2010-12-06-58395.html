<div id="ygrps-yiv-644426514">Hello, everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I have a six year old who wants to go to public school. She says she thinks it would be fun. Do you think it&#39;s worth it to let her try? I want her to feel she has the freedom to make her own best choices. I would vastly prefer to unschool her forever, but it&#39;s not about me. Do you think public school might do any lasting harm? I had her in a structured preschool when she was four, and she acted out violently and was very unhappy. <br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Jennifer</div>

Explain to her that it&#39;s like the preschool, but about 1000 times worse. And also, she won&#39;t be allowed to go to the toilet without asking permission. Also explain that the teachers and many of the pupils will treat her very badly. School in real life is about as much like school on television as a real shark is like a cartoon shark out Finding Nemo. If, after you have explained this, she still wants to go, then you should help her to go and help her to make arrangements to make school less oppressive if she wants such measures.<br/>

what school&#39;s like. My daughter wanted to go to kindergarten so she  <br/>
could ride the Big Wheels like she did in preschool ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But better to stick to facts than propaganda and exaggerations. She  <br/>
might choose to go and have a very nice teacher. She might be treated  <br/>
nicely. She might find the experience okay but not worth her time.  <br/>
Which means the parent will have lost a lot of credibility.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029019925">Some kids love school.  They dont mind the structure.  They love having lots of other kids around. It isnt all bad to them.  They dont care if they have to ask to go to the bathroom etc.. Some teachers are nice and sweet etc..<br/>
My daughter is 7 and wants to go.  Many of her friends are in school and her best homeschooled friend is going back next year.  I havnt told her that yet since it is still a while off and their plans may change.  It will be difficult for my daughter.  None of my boys want to go but she has asked about it. <br/>
Not really sure what to do either.  She knows her alphabet but is not reading or writing much at all.  She isnt that motivated to do those things.  She would be in the 2nd grade next year and would be considered behind by school standards.  I guess I would worry that her feelings would be hurt or her self esteem.  At home these things wouldnt matter but at school attention would be drawn to them.</div>

<br/>
If a thousand people said no it wouldn&#39;t, would that be a sure safety for her?<br/>
If a thousand people said yes, it will, then what?<br/>
What if 500 say yes and 500 say no?<br/>
<br/>
Pretty much everyone who&#39;s really thinking is going to need to say &quot;it depends.&quot;   But if by &quot;lasting harm&quot; you mean to her physical body, maybe. If you mean to her emotional state, maybe.  If you mean to her natural learning, yes; it can&#39;t help but do that.<br/>
<br/>
School divides things into educational and non-educational, straight up.  Then it divides the educational things into language, math, science, history, health, physical education, music (if you&#39;re lucky) and art (as though it has no overlap with the other things).  Just learning those terms will do some harm to the purest possibilities of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If she is six and has never been to school, maybe she wants to ride a bus, or have a teacher, or a lunch box, or to be around other kids.  There are other ways to get a bus ride, a luch box, a teacher and other kids.  Dance classes.  Gymnastics.  Martial arts, sports, music or art.<br/>

My daughter was adopted by us at the age of 4, she darker skinned than her friends, she wears glasses, her hair is different etc.. she sees herself as so different than the people she is around much of the time so she very much wants to be the same in as many ways as she can.  We try very hard to provide her with situations and people that can help her feel more sameness but I think think this is her motivation behind going to school.  She wants to go cause she thinks that is one way she can be the same as others.  My fear is it would have the opposite effect than she thinks it would, even more differences would be pointed out and noted.</div>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m kind of changing the subject...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here has a child who would love to ride in a vehicle without a car seat, and maybe without a seat belt, I highly recommend India.   TONS of traffic, few seat belts, safe drivers because they all own their vehicles and bought them with cash.  I think when the banks own cars, they (the banks and their insurance companies) make tons of insurance requirements to protect their cars and assets.    In India, people are careful for real reasons of the protection of life.  In the U.S., people drive carefully (IF they do) more to avoid getting a ticket, it seems.   It was very different.<br/>
<br/>
And back to the subject, yes... VERY often kids think they want school when what they really want is a fun experience like they saw on Arthur or Barney (to name shows Holly saw, and you can plug in the names of more recent kids&#39; shows depicting fun, magical, cartoon sing-along schools), or they want The Magic Schoolbus, or they want a happy school lunch like they saw on a commercial for jello pudding or some such.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth offering all kinds of rides, fun lunches and singalongs in other contexts to see if that will do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
AND...the big one:<br/>
IF school seems more interesting than home, MAKE HOME MORE INTERESTING!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736063252">Public school also has comparisons, favouritisms, unhealthy peer pressures,<br/>
much emphasis on grades and marks and unhealthy competition.<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure you want to put your kids through all this?<br/>
<br/>
Mostly it is just, the peripherals, that &quot;a kid who wants to go to school&quot;<br/>
misses. So find out if you could give her the peripherals by enrolling her<br/>
in other classes. Like picnics, trips, bus ride, groups to play with, group<br/>
activities, perhaps putting up a show etc. You could easily find all these<br/>
things if you explore dance classes, art classes, local homeschooling<br/>
support groups, public libraries or museums which perhaps have weekly<br/>
activities for groups etc.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a language teacher who teaches in small groups at home. Or a animal<br/>
shelter which encourages kids to help out. A theater group for kids is a<br/>
wonderful activity to explore.<br/>

This was written about experiences my sister had, but none of her kids were quite that young.  It&#39;s about the difference between a child going to school when the mother isn&#39;t pressing or desiring it, and otherwise--the difference in the experience.<br/>

That&#39;s true, too.  Even people who think they weren&#39;t damaged by school will start to discover the ill effects once they get into the swing of unschooling.  I used to think school hadn&#39;t hurt me, but over the years I can see it from a different perspective.  I wasn&#39;t hurt in the blatant ways many of my friends and schoolmates were, but I lack the clear advantages and wholeness my never-schooled children have.<br/>

I also feel this. when I watch my children I feel how much I really missed<br/>

of it I used to be this super perfectionist and control freak so I was<br/>
always stressed out in trying to come top of the class. But hey you know I<br/>
topped high school exams. But guess what happened after that, I just went<br/>
sliding down and down all my University years. Simply because I kept<br/>
thinking all the time &quot;what the hell am I doing here&quot;. Pure agony and pain<br/>
those years were. My true nature of being dedicated and strong willed could<br/>
have been put to much better and creative pursuits.....The damages of<br/>
school, conventional parenting, social norms and myths took a toll on me<br/>
which I can only explain in some other space.<br/>
<br/>
I did not survive well, I do not know how many do? Or do they?<br/>
<br/>
So now I decided to put all my dedication, will power and perseverance into<br/>
unschooling my children. Because what can be more creative than this!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479111225">Karl has been interested because of the school bus and being around other<br/>
kids. Our church is very pro-school (most are) and the short time there (2<br/>
hours tops) though not long enough for playing with other kids is in his<br/>
opinion too much time listening to people, even if it&#39;s mostly other kids,<br/>
talking while he is expected to sit and wait for it to be done. He has<br/>
ridden school buses a couple of times and had fun. His latest request is to<br/>
ride buses with other kids instead of the trips we&#39;ve arranged with us<br/>
parents on board. Train rides at amusement parks are similar but I&#39;ll be<br/>
looking more into that kind of thing. He hasn&#39;t said anything recently about<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I really feel the main thing is for me to do more things with him. My<br/>
attention gets on other stuff and I lose track of time. I have been playing<br/>
Minecraft with him. I&#39;m building models for the greenhouse I plan to<br/>
construct in another month or so, which Karl is interested in to some<br/>
degree, decorating for the holidays which he loves, found some great<br/>
snowflake patterns based on Star Wars, planning what we&#39;ll take when we<br/>
travel to Ohio and Pensacola, making concoctions he comes up with for him to<br/>
eat, and he comes with wishes of things to do every day or so.<br/>
<br/>
Making life interesting is a not just a great distraction from school<br/>
though. :) Because when school ends, what is there? Life on a bigger scale.<br/>

I just wanted to say that all of you are wonderful and thank you for your thoughtful replies. What ended up happening is that once I called the school principal and set up an observation day for us, my daughter lost interest before the day even arrived. I think maybe she just wanted to know that she was permitted to go if she wanted to! :-) In general, she has hated all the organized, scheduled activities we&#39;ve tried. I&#39;m the same way, but I don&#39;t want to try to make her be like me. &quot;Hey, you better be a free spirit or suffer the consequences!&quot; :-) Anyway, thanks again.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221015260">I think those who might have had more freedom at home had their parents<br/>
thought of it may get a case of &quot;what&#39;s school for and what&#39;s it all for<br/>
anyway?&quot; I did ok with school because it was a relief from situations in my<br/>
family. I don&#39;t mean I aced the grades. I had a wider very different world<br/>
because of school, like an alternate life. For some kids, that&#39;s what school<br/>
is. There are some good reasons for school, for kids whom school is not<br/>
doing such a number on, unbeknownst to them at the time perhaps. I thought I<br/>
was messing up school not to care about grades and so on. When I discovered<br/>
unschooling I realized that my attitude actually made some sense. I got<br/>
something worthy out of school even if I didn&#39;t enjoy it as much as I would<br/>
have liked to and I only realized some of this well after school was over<br/>
with. I also got more out of university once more freedom of choice came<br/>
into the picture (being of age as well as choice of courses, electives,<br/>
professors, paper topics, majors, etc.). None of college was compulsory even<br/>
if I were to lose money by dropping out. That&#39;s still a choice. (My parents<br/>
didn&#39;t send me. I went on my own though. I realize that isn&#39;t always the<br/>
case.)<br/>
<br/>
What if not schooling were made compulsory by the absence of school? That<br/>
might not be such a good thing for unschooling were parents to tell their<br/>
kids they can&#39;t have the school experience. I would think parents could<br/>
provide some of that experience in some way in the absence of public school<br/>
(hard to imagine that hypothetical really). Of course a big reason school&#39;s<br/>
attractive is because it&#39;s there. Chicken and egg scenario.<br/>
<br/>
Making children&#39;s lives fun is why school often seems attractive. Make<br/>
unschooling fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-385149710">&quot;One of my favorite quotes is from one of Sandra&#39;s videos (she may not even <br/>
remember saying it, but I love it):<br/>
<br/>
&#39;I never knew how much damage school did until I saw some kids who hadn&#39;t <br/>
been.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sort of like when I talk with others about corporal punishment, and they <br/>
say, &quot;well I was spanked, and I&#39;m fine.&quot; Ok... but how much better *could* you <br/>
be if you hadn&#39;t been spanked? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-927361760">***We try very hard to provide her with situations and people that can help her <br/>
feel more sameness but I think think this is her motivation behind going to <br/>
school. She wants to go cause she thinks that is one way she can be the same as <br/>
others. My fear is it would have the opposite effect than she thinks it would, <br/>
even more differences would be pointed out and noted.***<br/>
<br/>
She may struggle with that feeling her whole life whether or not she&#39;s in <br/>
school.  Going to school would make her like all the other kids in the <br/>
neighborhood.  She may or may not find others in school to fit in with.  Some <br/>
kids do and some kids don&#39;t.  I always found friends but my sister didn&#39;t.  Kids <br/>
in general look for kindness in others, as kids in school grow older they still <br/>
look for kindness, but looks become more and more of a gauge for friendship. <br/>
 That has been my experience.  Kids who don&#39;t go to school, kids who unschool <br/>
tend to use a variety of measures to gauge a friendship and are less likely to <br/>
dismiss someone outright based on looks alone.<br/>
<br/>
***She knows her alphabet but is not reading or writing much at all. She isnt <br/>
that motivated to do those things. She would be in the 2nd grade next year and <br/>
would be considered behind by school standards. I guess I would worry that her <br/>
feelings would be hurt or her self esteem. At home these things wouldnt matter <br/>
but at school attention would be drawn to them.***<br/>
<br/>
A seven yr old going into second grade would probably not be considered behind <br/>
if they didn&#39;t know how to read yet, it isn&#39;t until they must do all the testing <br/>
that it becomes a huge problem.  Testing starts in 3rd grade.<br/>
<br/>
Motivation has little to do with the ability to read.  Sometimes it coincides <br/>
with a child&#39;s ability to understand the written word and sometimes it doesn&#39;t. <br/>
 In reality a 7 yr old has very little reason to need to be able to read and <br/>
write.  If she wants to go to school, the school will give her reading readiness <br/>
exercises and call it reading, when in actuality, she&#39;ll be copying and sounding <br/>
out words, probably out of context, and doing worksheets with &quot;sounds like&quot; <br/>
pictures and other such nonsense that has little to do with actual reading. <br/>
 That&#39;s what schools call reading for those early years of school.  For the kids <br/>
that already have figured out how to read, they give them easy readers that <br/>
usually have lame stories that point out highlighted vocabulary words.<br/>
<br/>
The Bob Books are kinda neat though.  There are a few learning to read sort of <br/>
books out there that are kinda fun for a child interested.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439316637">***Public school also has comparisons, favouritisms, unhealthy peer pressures,<br/>
much emphasis on grades and marks and unhealthy competition.***<br/>
<br/>
My least favorite parts of school have to do with that sort of thing, that <br/>
combined with adult shaming and the general lack of respect towards children as <br/>
people.  Not all adults in school do this, some are really kind and sweet and <br/>
really genuinely love and understand kids.  It&#39;s like going to the dentist <br/>
though, if you don&#39;t brush your teeth and you have cavities, you may get a <br/>
shaming lecture from your dentist, and if you brush your teeth and have cavities <br/>
you will be told that you need to get it fixed and keep up the good work of <br/>
taking care of your teeth.  Either way you have a cavity, either way you need to <br/>
be fixed by an expert who tells you so.  Some dentists are more understanding <br/>
and caring than others, but few, and I&#39;ve yet to meet one, really ever admit <br/>
that cavities can sometimes fix themselves and that sometimes it has little to <br/>
do with how one cares for their teeth.  <br/>
<br/>
School can be like that too.  I&#39;ve yet to meet a teacher that stays in the <br/>
system that acknowledges that children don&#39;t always need to be fixed and that <br/>
learning has little to do with teaching, and tools used by teachers don&#39;t always <br/>
work.<br/>

<br/>
Yes true!  I made a mental note as soon as I posted it.  I&#39;ve been reading US <br/>
testing and readiness things lately, and the general direction is toward <br/>
standardized testing at 3rd grade, but even so that isn&#39;t even true for all <br/>
schools in the US, and even less true for other places around the world.<br/>
<br/>
In light of unschooling, kids aren&#39;t in grades, they are individuals learning <br/>
all the time.  While some parents must keep track of grades and other data, <br/>
hopefully they act as buffers for their children.  It&#39;s nice when I can forget <br/>
what &quot;grade&quot; my child would be in.  It&#39;s happened many times over the years! <br/>
 Then I must go back and count it.  I&#39;m intentionally not counting back to see <br/>
what grade Margaux would be in.  I lost track and that&#39;s okay by me!<br/>
<br/>
In the US, the trend to pull kids out of school seems to coincide with 3rd grade <br/>
and the stress from testing.  It&#39;s what I&#39;ve noticed over the years in general <br/>
homeschool forums, but that&#39;s not about unschooling, even if some of those <br/>
families come to unschool their kids.  It&#39;s those little reminders of school and <br/>
living in the absence of school.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s the hold over thinking in my own head from school, when grades are <br/>
mentioned, I immediately go back to my own school experience, which is a US <br/>
experience and even though we didn&#39;t do rigorous testing until jr high school, <br/>
even THAT is a construct of school that isn&#39;t universal!  Those are the bits <br/>
that always remain no matter how far I&#39;ve come in my thoughts that don&#39;t include <br/>
school or school thinking!<br/>
<br/>
It really does frame the way people think about ages and expectations and the <br/>
categories we put people in.  It&#39;s glaringly different for my own children. <br/>
 Especially noticeable in Chamille since she is older, that she really doesn&#39;t <br/>
have that in her thinking.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442957447">Yes on American 3rd grade, and for me that year coincided with a move across<br/>
3 states from a school where I knew the kids to SC where I knew no one and<br/>
we moved way out in the boonies and it was during the years of the gas price<br/>
crunch of the mid 1970s. I hated every minute of it. Too many changes.<br/>
Another big changing year for me was 5th grade since it was a gear-up for<br/>
junior high school (6th grade) ... oh brother. Those were by far the hardest<br/>
years in school for me.<br/>
<br/>
Karl would be in 2nd grade were he in school. You know why I know? And it&#39;s<br/>
not because I spent time counting it up. Because people ask and Karl likes<br/>
to have answers. I have no idea how he came up with it. It might be<br/>
deduction or a guess. I totally am not wanting to miss a moment of this time<br/>
with him. I don&#39;t remember being such a realist at 7 years old. We were<br/>
reading something about the 19th century hydrogen balloons (a chapter book)<br/>
and he said parts of it couldn&#39;t be true such as a balloon not burning up<br/>
over a volcano crater spewing sparks hundreds of feet into the air. But the<br/>
fiction in the story had it that the balloonists just experienced a lot of<br/>
uncomfortable heat. He&#39;s like &quot;oh, no way.&quot;<br/>
