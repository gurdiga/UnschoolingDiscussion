 it scares me when i do it, i begin to wonder what the heck am i doing?  and <br/>
then my cute little 2 year old starts saying &quot;sorry, mum&quot;  to every little <br/>

joining the fam, but that doesnt help me practicality wise.  except that <br/>
maybe i have to lower my expectations (again?)...  whew.  i have a feeling <br/>

Hi Erin<br/>
<br/>
Well, first you&#39;ve one-uped me by having another baby. But I can certainly<br/>
remember PPD.<br/>
<br/>
What is this &quot;just&quot; postpartum? Just, as in &quot;just hormonal induced<br/>
exhaustion mixed with homicidal thoughts&quot;?  Or was that just me?  When I had<br/>
my last two I nearly throttled people who pointed out to me that I have all<br/>
girls. (Gosh...I hadn&#39;t noticed that!)  It really sent me over the edge when<br/>
people would talk in front of my daughters as if they were mistakes of some<br/>
kind. Of course, that&#39;s not what you&#39;re talking about. I was just<br/>
remembering how my irritability spread out to total strangers.<br/>
<br/>
At home I was worse. I think a big problem is people help mothers with the<br/>
first baby and less and less for every one after that. They figure you know<br/>
what you&#39;re doing, you don&#39;t want help, or (worse) they don&#39;t want to really<br/>
help....they just want to hold the baby. I don&#39;t know about you, but when my<br/>
babies were less than 3 months old I was always tired. And when I&#39;m tired I<br/>
have a very hard time being cheerful. This will spill over even to the cute<br/>
little children that you love. I remember apologizing a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I can only offer encouragement. And the well worn phrase: Time will take<br/>
care of it. Don&#39;t forget to take care of yourself, not only the children. I<br/>
actually would forget to eat. If you knew me you&#39;d think this wasn&#39;t<br/>
possible, but that&#39;s how muddled I was. Remember: If the mother&#39;s not happy,<br/>
no one is happy. So take care of the Mom.<br/>
