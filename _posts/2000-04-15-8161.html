<div id="ygrps-yiv-160732327">Hello Friends!<br/>
<br/>
This is an invitation to join a networking list for people who speak at<br/>
conferences, give workshops, or otherwise make presentations to the public<br/>
about homeschooling; and for conference and workshop planners and support<br/>
group contacts to discuss and coordinate promotion of homeschooling through<br/>
conferences, seminars, workshops and other events.<br/>
<br/>
Our goal is to encourage dialogue between those who want to speak and give<br/>
presentations on homeschooling and those who provide the conferences,<br/>
workshops, and other forums to reach homeschoolers. This list includes an<br/>
ever-widening circle of writers, authors, columnists, speakers, conference<br/>
coordinators, support group leaders and contact persons.<br/>
<br/>

There&#39;s been some very interesting discussion already, which you can read<br/>
