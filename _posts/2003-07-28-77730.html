<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930364260">Hi there!  I just joined, but this happens to be one of my areas ;)<br/>
first, I would totally rethread the machine.  If that doesn&#39;t resolve <br/>
it ( I am amazed at how often it does)<br/>
<br/>
I would check upper thread tension - if it isn&#39;t tight enough, it will <br/>
make big loops that get stuck in the bobbin area.<br/>
If that isn&#39;t the problem, remove the bobbin case and take it all apart <br/>
as much as you can ( hard to say without knowing what machine you have) <br/>
  And make sure it isn&#39;t clogged or jammed.<br/>
