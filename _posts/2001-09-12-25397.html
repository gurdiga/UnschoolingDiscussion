watch,actually, I prefer to knit and sew to the TV.  Movies have added a<br/>

things we have watched together and developed our own routine about.  For<br/>

the movie.  <br/>

macrame-ing, knitting, reading, sewing, etc. too.<br/>

the girls:  I would start doing something they like to do without them. <br/>

Anyway, they would usually come join me.  If they didn&#39;t I&#39;d know they<br/>

<br/>
Make sure there a things near the TV that he can do<br/>
while watching TV like draw. Put toys and other stuff<br/>
near the TV.  A kid could watch TV and put a brio<br/>
train together at the same time. My dd had don&#39;t<br/>
interesting craft things, wrote letters, colored,<br/>
drawn done mazes etc while watching TV.<br/>
<br/>
I would watch with him sometimes just to know what<br/>
they are watching and so you can talk about it with<br/>
him. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t wait for the TV binge to be over with before you<br/>
get on with life. I think parents who have said they<br/>
tried to let there kids to self regulate and it didn&#39;t<br/>
work were waiting for the TV binge to stop then when<br/>
the TV binge stopped they would have helped their kids<br/>
do cool stuff. But if there isn&#39;t cool stuff happening<br/>
how is a kid to choose to do the cool stuff over TV/<br/>
in addition to TV.<br/>
<br/>
If there are things you want to do or things you think<br/>
your son would like to do but he is having a hard time<br/>
leaving the programming schedule of the TV show him<br/>
how the VCR works and check out lots of videos from<br/>
the library as well. <br/>
<br/>
Find things you can do while he watches TV that you<br/>
have wanted to learn or haven&#39;t done in a while. <br/>
<br/>
Have few more things to add but my son wants nummies<br/>
;)<br/>

If you really don&#39;t WANT to do anything with your children, don&#39;t offer.  If <br/>
there are things you need to do you they might want to help (in the yard, <br/>
elsewhere in the house) you could make the offer.  If there&#39;s something <br/>
happening (a play, homeschool playgroup, etc.) you could offer that, and <br/>
offer to record what they might miss on TV.  But I wouldn&#39;t just say <br/>
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you rather play Lego?&quot;  Put the Lego in the room where the TV is, <br/>
maybe, if you think Lego&#39;s a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;Do you guys watch with  them a lot? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When they were little, I watched TONS with them.  Not as much now that the <br/>
youngest is 9, but we still do watch lots of videos together.   Mostly here <br/>
it&#39;s videos and not TV.  Sometimes the kids will watch TV together and <br/>
there&#39;s a similar benefit to having a mom there (since the boys are 15 and <br/>
12)--there&#39;s intelligent commentary, someone to answer questions, and they <br/>
often tell me what they thought was best or worst about a show.<br/>

&gt; false?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would it be false? Why would something outside of<br/>
TV be less real than what we see on TV? If you are<br/>
honestly offering an experience then your son will<br/>
take it at full value. Be prepared for him to so no.<br/>
Allow him to make the judgement if it is important<br/>
enough to give up a favorite program. <br/>
Unless the questioner thinks that TV is so fascinating<br/>
that you&#39;d never be able to drag your little one away<br/>
by calls of &quot;cool, come look at this bug&quot; or offers to<br/>
go out in the mesa and look for lizards, or offers to<br/>
go get ice cream at Dairy Cream. <br/>
And TV has its own merits. It&#39;s not the big baddy some<br/>
have been brainwashed to think it is. I can&#39;t give an<br/>
exact example because my mind doesn&#39;t hold that much<br/>
info anymore, and both kids who would know what I&#39;m<br/>
talking about are still sleeping, but just the other<br/>
day I watched a few moments of Pokemon with my<br/>
16-nearly 17yo. The dialog went something like this;<br/>
me-Wow I didn&#39;t know that, son-yeah, and when...  <br/>
Which resulted in a 5 minute conversation on some <br/>
military technical term and the real meaning and how<br/>
it could be used in our everyday lives. I often use<br/>
the example of a friend&#39;s son who picked out which<br/>
paintings were by Picasso out of a coffee table book<br/>
when he&#39;d never seen Picasso paintings before, all<br/>
because he&#39;d watched Toy Story. You know when Mr<br/>
Potato Head puts all his body parts on one side and<br/>
says &quot;Look, I&#39;m Picasso&quot; Who would have thought Toy<br/>
Story was so educational? <br/>

&gt; happening<br/>
&gt; how is a kid to choose to do the cool stuff over TV/<br/>
&gt; in addition to TV.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very true. We all need lots of cool stuff. Providing<br/>
new experiences, new ideas and different environments<br/>
is our biggest job as unschoolers.<br/>

&gt; room <br/>
&gt; Bridget<br/>
 </span></blockquote>......................................................<br/>
<br/>
It is different at our house. <br/>
Our TV is in our main room....as are the crafts. <br/>
Several floor to ceiling book shelves holding a good<br/>
portion of the reference books. And a wall of<br/>
materials to make things with, from paper to a large<br/>
basket of toilet paper tubes. Different types of glue,<br/>
paints, etc. The television-holding-furniture has a<br/>
big shelf filled with board games and puzzles, card<br/>
decks, these all have all of their pieces (or<br/>
substitutes)and get used. Musical instruments live<br/>
here too. (The ones that didn&#39;t migrate to older son&#39;s<br/>
homes) We have several types of looms and other types<br/>
of fiber art materials in this same room.  My large<br/>
5x7 loom is on the large, greenhouse porch, as is<br/>
DS4&#39;s &quot;workroom&quot; where he can do things that produce<br/>
lots of byproducts like sawdust, mud, or ?????liquids.<br/>
Well, mostly. These projects tend to migrate inside,<br/>
too. It is air-conditioned inside. Legos (lots and<br/>
lots) live on the bottom shelf of the supply shelves.<br/>
When I vacuum, anyway!!<br/>
<br/>
There are other rooms, and these have stuff in &#39;em. <br/>
But there is always something &quot;in progress&quot; in the<br/>
main room. The TV is turned on sometimes.  Actually,<br/>
more than I personally prefer, but not as much as it<br/>
could be. Constantly now....monitoring the news. DH<br/>
even made &quot;Mama&#39;s Play Room&quot;, but it has evolved into<br/>
fabric storage, out of season stuff, some (as many as<br/>
I can fit) of my books, mementos from past lives, and<br/>
guest sleeping. As I told DH when he was making it, it<br/>
is too isolated.<br/>
<br/>
I never &quot;hole up&quot;. I want to. But I don&#39;t. I&#39;m the<br/>
Mother around here so I am available.  &#39;course I&#39;d<br/>
better get off &#39;puter or that won&#39;t be true.......... <br/>
<br/>

and yes it often is hard to turn around. <br/>

It&#39;s one of the pitfalls of having an only or widely spaced ages, especially<br/>
if your natural inclination when given some free time is to grab a book or<br/>
get on the computer instead of to grab the crafts or a magnifying glass to<br/>
look for bugs ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s helpful to think more in terms of here&#39;s what I&#39;m planning for<br/>
the day would you like to go along and how does that fit in with your plans?<br/>
rather than as an entertainer to entice him to do things you think are more<br/>
worthwhile. Proactive rather than reactive.<br/>
<br/>
And now that I come to think of it, a lot of the things I find interesting<br/>
and like to learn more about like literature, history, and science were<br/>
sparked by TV not by books (though I did look at the pictures and read the<br/>
captions in Popular Science and National Geographic.) Other than old Nancy<br/>
Drew books, I avoided books with historical settings because they reminded<br/>
me too much of history from textbooks. But I loved movies set in the past.<br/>
:-) Science was Nova (and science fiction books). Literature was Shakespeare<br/>
on TV and Masterpiece Theater. It&#39;s rather unfortunate that there are so<br/>
many choices on cable TV since the good stuff gets buried amidst the noise.<br/>
It was lots easier when I was a kid and there were only 4 choices each hour<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
Well, that was a bit of a tangent!<br/>

<br/>
I personally don&#39;t give a high-ho about gender roles. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If it needs doing you do it. Period.<br/>
<br/>
First priority...children must be fed, healthy as<br/>
possible, strong and aware and capable and adaptable<br/>
as possible.It is my firm conviction that MOTHERS do<br/>
it all.  Some stuff we allocate......but ultimately<br/>
MOTHERS  are in charge of MOTHERING.<br/>
<br/>
I decide what, when, how much, and if....for my<br/>
children until they decide to decide for themselves. I<br/>
decided to unschool. I decided to give birth and the<br/>
manner of doing this. I decided to breast feed and how<br/>
long and the manner of weaning.  I decided what to<br/>
feed my babies and when and how much. I made sure it<br/>
was available. I learned about health and related<br/>
issues and applied (apply) what I learned as best I<br/>
can.  I learned all manner of self defense so that I<br/>
help my children be prepared and strong. I learned and<br/>
learned and am stil learning. <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ll change my mind when I feel like it, too!!<br/>
<br/>
Giving birth is about as organic as you can get.<br/>
Growth, learning, and providing for one&#39;s children is<br/>
organic and changeable too.  But as a MOTHER I decide<br/>
which direction to point. And I decide to always be<br/>
available...&#39;becuase there is no other human on Earth<br/>
to be available for these children. It&#39;s me. If their<br/>
Daddy&#39;s choose to be available that is<br/>
wonderful....but I can&#39;t choose that. It happens or<br/>
not. I CHOOSE AS A MOTHER TO ALWAYS BE A MOTHER. I<br/>
never abdicate to another, not DH, not PS, not TV, not<br/>
an e-list, not my own selfishness, not a tyranical<br/>
grandfather,  not anything.<br/>

time when I too felt like I needed and deserved my own private time and that <br/>
was that, my son needed to understand. I wasn&#39;t going to be the submissive <br/>
wife/housekeeper role.<br/>
For me it really was a backlash of going so long without meeting *any* of my <br/>
own needs. So when I decided I needed &#39;me&#39; time, it went a bit overboard. <br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m not the main caregiver, always available to give care to my son...who <br/>
is? I&#39;ve had to find my own balance. Now I am available to my son whenever he <br/>
needs me, but I also try to do more things for myself. The trick for me is to <br/>
do so in a fashion that suits us both. I&#39;ve recently asked a friend who he <br/>
knows very well if my son can come play for a few hours one day a week. Her <br/>
son loves it, so does mine. There have been days when he didn&#39;t want to go or <br/>
stay and I didn&#39;t push him to, and there have been days when I really missed <br/>
him and asked if he could come home early.<br/>
<br/>
I have refocused on my decision and commitment to be a full time at home <br/>
mother. This to me means being available whenever he needs me. And as far as <br/>
all of my family who keeps insisting that I need to go to school, or work, <br/>
etc....I tell them that I will live a long life. In twenty years I don&#39;t want <br/>
to be saying that I missed my son growing and changing.<br/>

<br/>
If (hypothetical) you are always a mother, 100% of the time, does it not<br/>
follow that your offspring must be a child 100% of the time?  <br/>
Personally, my children start to function as adults some of the time<br/>
around the age of 9.  Rachel is 16 and is a functional, productive and<br/>
adult member of the family.  She has problems that need addressed but<br/>
then so do I.  We address all of our problems as a family not as master<br/>
and slave (in either direction).<br/>

in long term benefits. Once your children are grown, you cannot get that<br/>
time back. I have heard of many women who regretted putting their careers<br/>
before their children, but never heard of a woman who was &quot;just a mom&quot;<br/>
saying they regretted raising their children. I truly understand the<br/>
pressure others can put on you also. My MIL has even told me I don&#39;t love my<br/>
husband because I &quot;make him work so hard&quot; and I don&#39;t go to work. I do work,<br/>
keeping a home for my family and being available for my children.<br/>

&gt; For me it really was a backlash of going so long without meeting *any* of<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; own needs. So when I decided I needed &#39;me&#39; time, it went a bit overboard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I&#39;m not the main caregiver, always available to give care to my<br/>
son...who<br/>
&gt; is? I&#39;ve had to find my own balance. Now I am available to my son whenever<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; needs me, but I also try to do more things for myself. The trick for me is<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; do so in a fashion that suits us both. I&#39;ve recently asked a friend who he<br/>
&gt; knows very well if my son can come play for a few hours one day a week.<br/>
Her<br/>
&gt; son loves it, so does mine. There have been days when he didn&#39;t want to go<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; stay and I didn&#39;t push him to, and there have been days when I really<br/>
missed<br/>
&gt; him and asked if he could come home early.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have refocused on my decision and commitment to be a full time at home<br/>
&gt; mother. This to me means being available whenever he needs me. And as far<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; all of my family who keeps insisting that I need to go to school, or work,<br/>
&gt; etc....I tell them that I will live a long life. In twenty years I don&#39;t<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; to be saying that I missed my son growing and changing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-467989379">&lt;&lt; If (hypothetical) you are always a mother, 100% of the time, does it not<br/>
follow that your offspring must be a child 100% of the time?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Both can be human and compassionate in their own measure 100% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
The child is growing, and the mother is too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085472144">Julie, you&#39;re off the hook for a minute ( you radical! )<br/>
<br/>
Bridget, you are the only one on an unschooling list who has equated the<br/>
mother /child relationship with the master / slave relationship.   I<br/>
cannot begin to fathom this.  <br/>
And why did you add, in parenthesis,  &quot; in either direction&quot; ?  Girl, I<br/>
never liked psychology that much but this is RINGing some bells here.<br/>
