<div id="ygrps-yiv-479743886">My daughter is getting ready to leave on a many-month journey to visit friends and see more of the country. She&#39;ll be traveling by Amtrak and bus and will have a not-too-huge backpack.<br/>
<br/>
When she&#39;s traveled this way in the past she&#39;s encountered so many parents dragging children on journeys and not providing them with anything to do. This time she&#39;s taking along stickers and paper/pens to help them fill their time. She also thought of making finger puppets and giving them away. <br/>
<br/>
Any other suggestions? Remember, she is carrying everything on her back, so space is an obvious limitation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989534340">When our oldest was 3 we went to India for 2 months. She and I made sock puppets on the flight over. All it required, was old socks, magic markers, some yarn and a yarn needle. They were great travelling toys, and I still see a few of them around when we dig out the kid&#39;s rooms. THe girls are now<br/>
almost 14 and 11.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a great idea your daughter has.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895494313">Susan<br/>
Is your daughter and adult? I got the impression she<br/>
is going alone....<br/>
<br/>
I suggest she take the &quot;raw&quot; materials with her in a<br/>
crafts bag (cross shoulder strap) with cloth scissors,<br/>
other scissors, several spools of thread,  about a<br/>
yard of unbleached muslin, some embroidery floss, a<br/>
selection of big eye needles, some buttons, dental<br/>
floss (good for mending back packs, jackets, other<br/>
heavy stuff) these are good for maintaining her own<br/>
things too. Perhaps a potholder size loom, a ball of<br/>
yarn,(and a plastic &quot;child&#39;s&quot; needle...they are good<br/>
for weaving). Baggies (to hold little projects<br/>
separate and to hold stuff she gives away or snacks).<br/>
Small notebooks keep paper together and have less<br/>
&quot;wasted&quot; or unused space so they aren&#39;t as heavy as<br/>
loose paper, tape. Those new gel pens are great. A<br/>
pack of watercolors is fun. And a good, long, book or<br/>
two is often helpful. And an address book with<br/>
everybody&#39;s addresses and phone numbers and e-addys,<br/>
envelopes.<br/>
<br/>
Tic tac toe, dots, hangman, mazes that you draw with a<br/>
child, go a long way.  Word games, rhyming, rhythem<br/>
games, and singing go a long way too...and the<br/>
children can take these with them forever. I&#39;ve found<br/>
that if is start a hand clap game or song that it<br/>
isn&#39;t long before there is a CROWD of kids.....those<br/>
are things that fit in a back pack easily. <br/>
<br/>
And crackers for the kids....often they are grumpy<br/>
cause they are hungry.<br/>
<br/>
Granola (homemade style)goes a loooooong way for food.<br/>
Bottled water is very helpful.  Easier than a canteen<br/>
(what I used to carry). Clean healthy food is<br/>
sometimes unavailable via bus. <br/>
<br/>
I found that the process of making something with<br/>
children or letting them talk while they watch, helps<br/>
them be happy longer. However lots of Mamas are leary<br/>
of strangers giving their children things.  Even<br/>
stickers. Then again, I&#39;ve had strangers LEAVE their<br/>
children with me for hours, days, and once for weeks.<br/>
<br/>
What a sweet girl to think of the children even before<br/>
she goes! How brave you are to let her go......<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and flashlight, cell phone, matches, antibiotic<br/>
ointment, hydrgen pyroxide, bandaides, bunch of clean<br/>
bandanas(usefull for eveything from dressings to<br/>
wrappiing spains, to noses, and for acessories).Light<br/>
weiht poncho and light wieght jacket tied to the<br/>
outside of the pack(changeable weather), sweater,<br/>
good, several pairs of warm socks, some polyprops or<br/>
other long johns rolled up in a corner (changeable<br/>
weather) and a warm vest (to turn the light jacket<br/>
into a warm one with the sweater. Gloves and warm hat<br/>
in a pocket on the outside.  Travelers in the winter<br/>
sometimes are stranded by blizzards in unexpected<br/>
places.  Her blouse and pants or skirt can be whatever<br/>
she likes. If she has only one pair of shoes it should<br/>
be good work or hiking boots, that she can run in,<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Sharon, who knows this is more than you asked for,<br/>
but.....I have more food and other tips, too...In my<br/>
far and distant youth I lived out of a back pack for<br/>
extended periods of time. I carried a sleeping bag,<br/>
too as I don&#39;t like the feel of most of the sleeping<br/>
accomodations that aren&#39;t in private homes. Some<br/>
outfitters sell a silk  sleeping bag that is just a<br/>
shell to keep contaminants off of skin while in a<br/>
hotel bed.  Sounds like a good idea to me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My sister uses string figures, like Cat&#39;s Cradle, to relate to children she <br/>
meets.  All you need is the right length of string and the knowledge of how <br/>
to do them.  I&#39;ve seen books on string figures, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised <br/>
if you could find something on the web.<br/>

Word games and songs?  Your daughters have lots of mental-storage of that <br/>
stuff!!<br/>
Finger games--string games.<br/>
Flowers out of napkins or kleenex (like the Mexican wedding flowers-on-cars). <br/>
 Bag ties would do those.  <br/>

<br/>
Oh, I&#39;m not brave. Believe me, if I could make her stay here, I probably would! She&#39;s 21 and wants to have a lot of independent experience before she&#39;s &quot;too old&quot;. The thought of her ALONE out there makes my stomach clench.<br/>
