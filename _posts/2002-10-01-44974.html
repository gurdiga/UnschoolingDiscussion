<div id="ygrps-yiv-238184047">&lt;&lt;Boston&#39;s are very smart, but then I am kinda partial! &lt;g&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I got bit on the butt when I was young by a Boston Terrier. The same dog <br/>
treed my older sister and bit her on the butt too. Same side!!!! I still <br/>
can&#39;t look at those dogs and not think of Ruffy!!!!! But I don&#39;t hold a <br/>
grudge. Aside from being a vet assistant, I also groomed and have been <br/>
bitten by so many it&#39;s hard to differentiate between nice and not so nice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Good for her! There are some good greyhound rescues. And greyhounds are <br/>
smart, and loyal.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know people who have adopted older greyhounds and they make wonderful <br/>
companions. Not very active though as one would think. They just love to be <br/>
couch potatoes!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are so many breeds out there to chose from and it all depends on where <br/>
you get the dog from too. I strongly recommend that no one buys from a pet <br/>
shop. Just a personal opinion that I feel strongly about. Puppy mills do <br/>
exist and no reputable breeder would ever sell to a store or kennel.<br/>
<br/>
Between my husband and myself we&#39;ve had many mixes, a poodle, an Akita, <br/>
Dobermans, Collies, a Pomeranian and now the Beagle and Bullmastiff. They <br/>
were all unique and fun and interesting in their own way. I would have to <br/>
honestly admit though that the most perfect one of all was one Dobie I had. <br/>
Just more than one could ever imagine as far as companionship and loyalty.<br/>
<br/>
Cute story. Phantom, the dobie was raised with my oldest. I actually had him <br/>
first. Tara grew up with him right by her side every step of the way. He <br/>
adored her and her him. She would sit and read to him from her books. (not <br/>
really reading but she thought she was) When she was two, a very precocious <br/>
two, she asked me when Phantom was going to get hands. She just didn&#39;t get <br/>
he was a dog and not her brother!!!!! We still miss him.<br/>

I hear that Jack Russells are pretty much like Sheltie&#39;s, great dogs if you <br/>
can keep them stimulated. Just dreadful if they get bored!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834782088">Hi Mary,<br/>
This is our first English Mastiff.  He is three years old this month <br/>
and we are in the process of having him flown over to Okinawa in a <br/>
week.  We miss him so much...but had to wait for the heat <br/>
restrictions to pass.  We have not had too many challenges with <br/>
Zade.  He is such a great dog!  What kind of challenges are you <br/>
facing?  Zade is with our breeder right now in Oregon.  She is a <br/>
wonderful person and we did our homework...no backyard breeders!  <br/>
I&#39;ve been around many Mastiffs and never encountered a negative <br/>
disposition.  They of course need socialization as with any dog and <br/>
become very attached to their families.  So many of these large <br/>
breeds are abandoned once people realize how big they get ...very <br/>
sad.  We have 4 years and 4 months left in the military and when we <br/>
are done we plan on doing a few Mastiff rescues.  We would like to <br/>
have a few more, but our current lifestyle isn&#39;t appropriate for <br/>
a &quot;few&quot; more.  I just love Mastiffs...so sweet and gentle..except <br/>
for the tail.  The kids will lie down on the floor with him and lift <br/>
his jowls to see his teeth, they look into his ears and check his <br/>
toes...he doesn&#39;t mind a bit.  We did crate train Zade too for a <br/>
little over a year.  That helped tremendously.  Glad to see another <br/>
Mastiff owner :)<br/>

&gt;Hi Mary,<br/>
&gt;This is our first English Mastiff.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When we were shopping around &#39;if you will&#39; for the breed that would suit us, <br/>
my husband wanted an English Mastiff. I just couldn&#39;t see a dog THAT big <br/>
with all that goes on around here anyway. So we compromised on the Bully. We <br/>
had him shipped in from Oklahoma. He really is a good dog and good with the <br/>
kids although we have to watch with the little one. Ozzy just doesn&#39;t <br/>
realize how big he is. Last month he was 80lbs at 6 months and he&#39;s been <br/>
putting on like 10-15lbs a month. He thinks he&#39;s the same size as our <br/>
Beagle!!! He&#39;s good with everyone and also the Beagle and the cats too. He <br/>
just gets a bit over rambunctious at times and with him being so big, well <br/>
you can imagine. He also is into chewing and the toys we have just don&#39;t <br/>
seem to be big enough. He prefers the desk and the wall, etc.!!!!! We also <br/>
crate train for now. I can&#39;t imagine going to bed and leaving two puppies in <br/>
the house!!! And with his size, there is no place to contain him. Thanks for <br/>
the good info, we have heard both breeds are great dogs, it was just a <br/>
matter of size. (yeah right!!!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991136246">My Zade never understood his size either.  He always thought he was <br/>
a lap dog.  Still does.  If I sit on the floor he will come over and <br/>
sit his rear in my lap...mind you he is towering over me.  Once when <br/>
he was sick he tried for a good 15 minutes to get in my lap...gave <br/>
up and lied down next to me.  He will also back up to the couch and <br/>
sit down on it with all four feet still on the floor! What a site.  <br/>
What&#39;s worse is his expression because he is not allowed on the <br/>
couch and he knows it!  We had to watch him with my youngest one too <br/>
for a while because his tail could pack a punch.  There was one <br/>
incident where my husband had been gone for a long time.  He drove <br/>
up in the driveway (diesel truck)and the kids ran out the door <br/>
screaming for daddy.  Zade was at the window whimpering like crazy, <br/>
so I let him run out too.  Big mistake.  He made a bee line for kid <br/>
#1 and boom...knocked him off his feet...then kid #2, same thing.  <br/>
Then ran happily to dad with two kids crying in the background.  As <br/>
upset as we were with him it really was funny.  That only happened <br/>
once though.  Zade tried to chew on a piece of furniture once and we <br/>
sprayed it with bitter apple spray and he never touched it again, <br/>
but I&#39;ve heard that the spray doesn&#39;t phase some dogs.  Your bully <br/>
sounds wonderful!  <br/>
