***I dearly wish that being able to try out different things, like music,<br/>
horse-riding, ice-skating etc etc wasn&#39;t limited by cash.***<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be!<br/>
When my niece wanted to learn to ride but her folks couldn&#39;t afford it<br/>
she just started showing up at the stables every day.   She offered to<br/>
help, she was put on a schedule as a volunteer and after two or three<br/>
weeks they started giving her lessons.   They figured if she was that<br/>
dedicated she should be able to learn.  <br/>
<br/>
When Dylan took his friend Martin to Karate class Martin was such a<br/>
natural that the instructor asked him to keep coming even though he<br/>
couldn&#39;t pay.   He just thought that kid should be there. <br/>
<br/>
When my friend&#39;s daughter wanted to learn more about geology she walked<br/>
into the geology department at the university and asked if she could sit<br/>
in on the classes.   She&#39;s 14, she stayed the whole year, she did<br/>
wonderfully and her instructor told her she&#39;d be welcome back any time. <br/>
<br/>
My mom took up painting at the age of 80, couldn&#39;t afford lessons, so she<br/>
got together with some other ladies and they checked out books and videos<br/>
from the library.  They get together every Tuesday to paint and my mom<br/>
has produced some pretty nice paintings.<br/>
<br/>
When my nephew Hunter was interested in guitar he&#39;d go to the music<br/>
stores and the (usually) young guys there would be happy to let him mess<br/>
around with the instruments and show him things.   He later took lessons<br/>
from a high school kid who just liked having someone to talk guitar talk<br/>
to.   <br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s a community ice rink just go and after awhile when you notice<br/>
some regulars who are good, ask for tips.   I have found people who love<br/>
a thing are happy to share what they know about it.<br/>
<br/>
 ***My son would love to play the violin we found but until I find<br/>
someone who will teach him for free it just ain&#39;t gonna happen. ***<br/>
<br/>
Just let him fiddle with it. (no pun intended)<br/>
Call high school and college music teachers and ask if they know of a<br/>
student who might be interested in showing your son a few things.  <br/>
Get in touch with your local symphony group and ask if anyone has<br/>
suggestions for you.<br/>
Go to the music stores and ask.<br/>
<br/>
When Dylan wanted to play piano everyone wanted to be paid up front for<br/>
the whole year.   We couldn&#39;t afford that, but we found a high school<br/>
girl who wanted a fraction of the price and let us pay as we went.  It<br/>
wasn&#39;t hard to scrounge up four dollars a week but we never could have<br/>
done the $500. the others wanted.<br/>
<br/>
You might have to get creative but there is a way.  = )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-576433077">This is great Deb,   I have to print it out and show my dh,    he really is struggling with the whole money issue,     trying to see the logic in the unjobbing thing,   he is not sold,        he thinks it all sounds wonderful,  but he doubts the feasability.<br/>

ONE lesson on how to hold the bow and how much pressure, how much to tighten <br/>
the bow, etc., would help.  There are LOTS of books with accompanying CDs.  I <br/>
bet there are videos.  I bet you could hire a high school orchestra student <br/>
for very cheap, just for a few lessons to get him started.<br/>
