 Yep, I&#39;m on some of those, too. I don&#39;t mind the work, so if you all want to<br/>
 petition our fearless leader (not too hard though, remember she&#39;s<br/>
 recuperating ;) I don&#39;t mind.<br/>

 We could ask potential members the Questions Three from Monty Python. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had to go approved status with the gayHomeschoolers list I run...because of <br/>
stupid ads and hit-and-run harassment. They have to send me a couple <br/>
sentences about why they want to join. The list is much smaller, though.<br/>

By the by, my 13 year old son is &#39;Tim the Enchanter&#39; today.  Only problem <br/>
being that he couldn&#39;t figure out how to throw firebolts (well, he figured <br/>
it out, only I wouldn&#39;t let him unless he could guarantee he wouldn&#39;t set <br/>
anything on fire and he couldn&#39;t figure that one.)  (Poor lad.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is this a Halloween costume?  Very cool idea.  I, being unusually uninspired<br/>
and in serious denial regarding Halloween (Chronologic Portal To<br/>
Thanksgiving/MyBirthday/Christmas and Other Hells), have suggested my 12<br/>
y.o. son go as Spiderman -- before the transformation.  T-shirt, jeans,<br/>
jacket, my big ancient SLR camera &#39;round his neck, toy spider glued to his<br/>
face....  I&#39;m thinking I need to rent the movie to get the costume right,<br/>
plus we can&#39;t remember the character&#39;s name before he was Spiderman.<br/>

Someone here will know, no doubt &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Hi, Nancy --<br/>
<br/>
Do you celebrate Christmas or Twelfth Night or both?<br/>

PS  We watched the Simpsons Halloween Marathon at our house so we&#39;ve got<br/>
that Hallowe&#39;en spirit coming out of our ears.  Eek!</div>
