<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271930532">Thanks for the link to the unscooling.com conversation about <br/>
being with our kids. It took me three days to work through it. But <br/>
so worth it. I feel revitalized in my commitment to my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I just rec&#39;d in the mail a copy of Whole Child, Whole Parent <br/>
and have already read the first two chapters. Great book!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the input and support. My time on list is limited by <br/>
my online teaching right now, but I just wanted to pop in and say <br/>
hi and thanks! You gals are a treasure trove of great dialog and <br/>
resources.<br/>
