<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406589506">The be all and end all of lists:   this isn&#39;t it.  <br/>
Neither is any other list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; This list has, to me, appeared to be more of a general parenting <br/>
 list.  The volume of posts is remarkable, but few of them have <br/>
 anything to do with unschooling.  Maybe the name of the group should <br/>
 be changed. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you expect to get all you unschooling information from one place, that <br/>
would be about like expecting your child to learn all of history from one <br/>
book, or all of  math from one book.  <br/>
<br/>
First order of business with unschooling is that you follow your interests.<br/>
<br/>
SO!  If you&#39;re interested in unschooling and this list is insufficient (as it <br/>
should be for anyone finding out about unschooling) you go to <br/>
www.unschooling.com and read the library and whatever of the archives seems <br/>
of interest.   You can go to www.google.com and put in your favorite <br/>
buzzwords.  You can go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a> and follow the <br/>
links.  Just that would take weeks, I think, if you read each other file and <br/>
followed THEIR links.<br/>
<br/>
Since people are being testy and blunt anyway, I wish to say that I don&#39;t <br/>
like it at all when people come and ask to be spoonfed unschooling.  If it <br/>
truly is the first day they&#39;ve ever heard of it, that&#39;s differerent, but if <br/>
they&#39;ve been reading some and then want people to make housecalls (or at <br/>
least to send them everything they need to know by e-mail), that doesn&#39;t seem <br/>
to me to be a good candidate for an unschooling parent.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I could call the library and ask them to pile up whatever they have <br/>
on calligraphy and bring it over to me, and hey, could you stop by the art <br/>
store and get me some pens and ink and paper?  Perhaps for a very steep price <br/>
some cab driver would do that for me, meter running all the time.<br/>
<br/>
But people can come FOR FREE and get more information in one day than we <br/>
could get ten  years ago in a YEAR about unschooling.  And yet they complain <br/>
that it&#39;s just what they expected, not the right color for them, too ithcy, <br/>
too direct, too vague, too general, too particular.  <br/>
<br/>
One source is plagiarism and three sources is research.  That&#39;s an old school <br/>
saying.<br/>
<br/>
I think three sources is kinda weak research!  Ten sources read thoroughly <br/>
and carefully considered in light of all your own experience starts to be <br/>
real knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
So there&#39;s no reason to change the name of this e-mail list.  It&#39;s a function <br/>
and service of www.unschooling.com, which is sponsored by Home Education <br/>
Magazine.  It does its job better than most lists I&#39;ve been on.   And it&#39;s <br/>
not the only unschooling list there, but I&#39;m not willing to go to yahoo, <br/>
search for them and send them to anyone by e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
One of the first things unschoolers with a computer need to find out how to <br/>
do is to go to a website and search.  Maybe the first website can be <br/>
www.google.com .<br/>
<br/>
My rant is ended.<br/>
