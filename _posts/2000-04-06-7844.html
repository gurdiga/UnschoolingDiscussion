<div id="ygrps-yiv-102123061">I took my boys (7 and 3) to the library today and remembered why I usually <br/>
leave them with their dad when I go pick out books&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
ROFL  Much too familiar except my 8 yr only picks out movies, won&#39;t look at the <br/>
books (thanks to his first grade teacher &gt;:/ ) and I have a 3yr and a 18 mo <br/>
old...so multiply your son times two...add high pitch screaming (they&#39;re girls) <br/>
when you pick them up, and climbing into chairs which promptly fall over with <br/>
the youngest in it.  I can emphasize.  Except with the hours my dh works I <br/>
rarely get a chance to visit the library alone.  I just have to grin and bear <br/>
it.  What saves me is keeping my eyes open for other parents in the same <br/>
predicament, so I know it&#39;s not just me or my kids.  LOL<br/>
