&gt; has delved into anthologies of Poe&#39;s poetry since that time. We&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; also read Poe&#39;s bio and discussed some of the conditions and language <br/>
&gt; differences of those times and circumstances in Poe&#39;s life that <br/>
&gt; caused him to write such dark material. We&#39;ve read and re-read the <br/>
&gt; poetry for meaning, style and language. We&#39;ve talked about other <br/>
&gt; styles of poetry and how they compare. Casey&#39;s written her own poetry <br/>
&gt; and once created a hard bound book of her poems which she donated to <br/>
&gt; the library. (I&#39;m not sure what they did with it. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<br/>
I heard on Paul Harvey years and years ago that there&#39;s a possibility <br/>
(someone&#39;s maybe doing an autopsy???) EA Poe was a victim of a rabid animal bite. His <br/>
terminal illness/death had many of symptoms of rabies.<br/>
<br/>
Some more info ...maybe?<br/>
