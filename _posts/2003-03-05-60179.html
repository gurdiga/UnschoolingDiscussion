&lt;&lt; I&#39;m distractable and very very very easily sidetracked. Then I regret <br/>
 it later. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
ME TOO! I think I like you even better now....<br/>
I&#39;ve finally decided that the part of me that is very easily distracted <br/>
another good thing about being a creative, daydreamer kind of gal.<br/>
Instead of berating myself over it, I have accepted and embraced this part of <br/>
myself.<br/>
I even get a good laugh sometimes, because as I clean, I never finish ONE <br/>
whole thing. I&#39;ll pick up a shoe in the living room, it reminds me that the <br/>
entry way is messy, I pick up a bag in the entry way, notice that the desk <br/>
has a bunch of papers, start in on those...sigh.<br/>
It&#39;s like a big circular thing. I always end up back at the beginning <br/>
eventually.<br/>
<br/>
I like our five minute clean ups best. The kids and I tackle the living room, <br/>
kitchen and dining room for exactly five minutes each. I seem to get the most <br/>
done in a short time and feel better the rest of the day.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

There are drugs to keep you from being distracted.<br/>
<br/>
There is a drug to make you think taking that show and putting it away was <br/>
just good enough.  A real accomplishment.<br/>
