Oh.<br/>
Well lots of people have names like &quot;Cook&quot; and &quot;Baker&quot; and &quot;Smith&quot; in most <br/>
European languages, and it doesn&#39;t occur to me to ask them if they are smiths or <br/>
cooks.<br/>
<br/>
I figured it was the name of the company because it was someone&#39;s name.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is CUISINART and CULINAIRE, brands of cookware.  I swear it is <br/>
the Martha in me but I just never thought that CUISINAIRE could be a <br/>
last name. I thought they were cooking implements given a new use or <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
Call me weird :)<br/>
