<div id="ygrps-yiv-717649160">I think the point that was being made was that it&#39;s possible to cause someone <br/>
to want something by not letting them even see or touch one.  A fascination <br/>
or a desire can develop which won&#39;t develop if the item isn&#39;t made powerful <br/>
by its singling out.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are at an age that some kids start hunting or waning guns, and <br/>
neither has any special gun interest at all.  My husband has a rifle that <br/>
belonged to a friend of ours who died in the late 1970&#39;s.  It has never been <br/>
loaded or fired in all those years (nor cleaned, so it better NOT be...).   I <br/>
have friends and relatives who do own guns, and so my kids have occasional <br/>
cause to see a gun.  We had a friend who&#39;s a police officer and another who <br/>
is a sheriff&#39;s deputy.  Both are sweet and pacificist men, and I knew both <br/>
before they trained for law enforcement.<br/>

A video game with a gun in it would not have caused nor prevented any of the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556006546">I agree with Tami that my kids dont NEED to play with<br/>
guns. Although, we do allow them. At first, we didnt<br/>
allow any guns of any sort. Then , everywhere we went<br/>
it seemed there were guns of some kind and my son<br/>
would go nuts to hold, touch, play with them. I saw<br/>
very clearly that taking the guns away only made him<br/>
want them more, so we changed our policy. He had a<br/>
couple toy water guns, and other than that has no<br/>
interest in them. I kept thinking that he&#39;d find a<br/>
real one somewhere and be so interested in it he&#39;d end<br/>
up shooting himself. Now, after much discussion on the<br/>
gun issue, he knows the dangers and what to do if he<br/>
ever finds a gun. He also has his fix with a couple of<br/>
brightly colored water pistols.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good observation.  My grandfather and uncle were gunsmiths but never had one <br/>
in their private homes.  For me a gun was a tool and the idea of having one <br/>
in the house was shocking, &quot;Why would you want one there?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I considered having one when we lived in an isolated area but quickly decided <br/>
that the risk of having one with kids on the house FAR outweighed the risk of <br/>
crime.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t buy toy guns but intentionally give no reaction to the sight of <br/>
seeing the kids play with one or pretend they are doing so.  The result?  <br/>
They&#39;re just another toy and they are barely interested in them.  Usually, if <br/>
you ignore something it goes away.<br/>
<br/>
When my dd was old enough to play alone at other&#39;s homes I role played a bit <br/>
and she knows if someone shows a gun (even if she thinks it might be real) <br/>
she will say, &quot;Oh, I forgot, I was supposed to be home 10 minutes ago.&quot; and <br/>
then leave.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733967007">Hi, I was raised in a home that had a few guns hanging on the wall, but they <br/>
were not functional. They were there for sentimental reasons and were old. My <br/>
Dad did not hunt or own a gun that worked but as a kid he did hunt. I loved <br/>
guns as a kid. Not sure why. I had a cool pop gun and at 5 talked my Mom into <br/>
letting me have a cowboy suit, complete with holster and guns. Her main <br/>
concern was that the pants zipped up the front. ( I remember her talking to <br/>
her friends about whether it would be improper to let me own such a pair of <br/>
pants) My, haven&#39;t times changed. My brothers both had BB guns but by the <br/>
time I was old enough to have one I had lost my gun interest and replaced it <br/>
with an interest in animals. I was upset that anyone would hunt them. ( both <br/>
my brothers lost their interests in guns too) My husband grew up with hunting <br/>
being a big part of his life. His family depended on his Father&#39;s ability to <br/>
hunt in the winter months when he was laid off work. All the boy&#39;s hunted and <br/>
it was certainly a different kind of life than the one I was raised in. It <br/>
was liked they lived in a different time period! When our oldest son became <br/>
fascinated with guns we let him have toy guns. And then when he was 11 he got <br/>
a BB gun. My husband, who seldom has time to hunt now, was looking forward to <br/>
hunting with the oldest someday. He spent a lot time teaching the kids gun <br/>
safety, they all like to target practice with Dad. Then a funny thing <br/>
happened to the oldest boy called Animal Planet. He loves the shows on that <br/>
channel. And now he loves animals and has no desire to hunt them. My husband <br/>
was very disappointed. Second son never had an interest in guns or hunting. <br/>
And the girls do not either. So you never know how things will turn out. I <br/>
personally do not like guns and now the only guns we have in the house are <br/>
black powder which my husband uses to hunt deer, if he has time. So I guess <br/>
you never know how it is going to turn out. <br/>
peace and grace <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962302540">My dad (also being from here and Texas) was the same<br/>
way. He owned a rifle or two and had a really old cool<br/>
looking pistol, was really really into the &quot;old west&quot;<br/>
and &quot;cowboy shows&quot; as my son called them, and my son<br/>
the first time he saw him watching one was shocked cuz<br/>
grampa was such a kind gentle man he would never think<br/>
that he enjoyed watching shows where people got shot.<br/>
The way I resolved that was to explain that things<br/>
were much different back then &quot;cowboy dayz&quot;, and the<br/>
same way cops have to carry guns now, everyone back<br/>
then had thier own guns. It&#39;s funny that you mentioned<br/>
coyotes and rattlers cuz i also explained that to him,<br/>
as did my dad. If you were out in the desert and you<br/>
came upon one you might need to defend yourself. But<br/>
he also understands that that would be in a complete<br/>
life or death defend yourself situation that you would<br/>
shoot any animal, or if you were stranded somewhere<br/>
and needed food. Not hunting for sport. We live near a<br/>
store where we can buy meat from animals that have<br/>
already been killed, there is no reason for us to go<br/>
shoot some more. My dad got rid of his guns when my<br/>
son was born and we lived with them for awhile. He<br/>
also stopped hunting. He looked at it through his<br/>
grandson&#39;s eyes and couldn&#39;t see a way to explain to<br/>
him why he would have a gun in the house or why he<br/>
would go and shoot any of the animals that I was<br/>
teaching him to cherish when our freezer already had<br/>
meat in it. But I agree that it is affected alot by<br/>
where you&#39;re from. My family are very much &quot;hicks&quot; (as<br/>
I affectionately call us), my dad was a &quot;good ol boy&quot;<br/>
and was guns and hunting was just passed down to him<br/>
as a normal part of life, (but he also remembered that<br/>
the first time he saw an animal shot when he was<br/>
little it was very hard for him to accept that it was<br/>
ok to do and said it changed him quite a bit.) and<br/>
wild west shtuff will always be around us. And I&#39;m<br/>
glad. It reminds me of my darling gentle sweet dad who<br/>
passed away less than a year ago. But we don&#39;t LIVE in<br/>
the wild west anymore. <br/>
Cowboyz did alot of other cool things too, besides<br/>
shooting. My son loves to play cowboy and never does<br/>
it involve a gun. <br/>
But like I said to each his own. I agree that people<br/>
who do like them should be allowed to have them, but I<br/>
also believe it should be much more regulated, so not<br/>
just any ol violence crazed person can get a gun out<br/>
of the paper for &quot;target practice&quot; that is basically<br/>
training them in the art of taking another life. Just<br/>
my humble opinion, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-665505225">I do agree that it makes it more desirable by being<br/>
fanatical about not letting them see one, etc. I&#39;ve<br/>
experienced that before with ds with other things. <br/>
I try not to be that way about guns, cuz I don&#39;t want<br/>
to make it more desirable to him, but as it is he<br/>
decides on his own when some kid somewhere wants to<br/>
play like thier shooting each other, he either just<br/>
changes the game, goes elsewhere, or comes and asks me<br/>
what he should do, cuz he doesn&#39;t want to play guns<br/>
and he knows by now (through hearing/seeing my<br/>
distaste for violence myself) that it is something<br/>
that shouldn&#39;t really be FUN. But sometimes he does<br/>
see some violent game (I&#39;m talking fighting now, not<br/>
shooting...) and want to get in on it. My natural<br/>
inclinations is &quot;AAAGGGHH!!! no no no!!!&quot; But thanks<br/>
to a very logical boyfriend who reminds me of that<br/>
whole forbidden fruit thing and how he&#39;ll just want it<br/>
and try to sneak to do it eventually if I be a freak<br/>
about it, then sometimes I&#39;ll indulge him and come to<br/>
find out he never asks again. It&#39;s like he has his own<br/>
distaste for violence when it comes down to it. I&#39;m<br/>
glad for that. <br/>
It&#39;s hard to find a balance, instead of one extreme or<br/>
the other. For example my cousin&#39;s son only almost<br/>
ONLY toy guns. ONLY plays violent, graphicly gory<br/>
games, and everything else seems boring to him. He&#39;s a<br/>
nice kid, other than he only wants to pretend he&#39;s<br/>
shooting you. He&#39;s alot older than Tori and I don&#39;t<br/>
remember him being like that when he was younger, but<br/>
ALL restrictions on anything like that were removed to<br/>
not make it more fascinating and it&#39;s a &quot;phase&quot; he has<br/>
not gotten over yet. But I know kids who have far TOO<br/>
MANY restrictions and are so happy to go over to<br/>
someone else&#39;s house so they can play something &quot;fun&quot;<br/>
without thier parents around. <br/>
ah to be a discerning parent. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-995743915">I don&#39;t mind water guns if they aren&#39;t made to look<br/>
like these automatic REAL guns and therefore when he<br/>
squirts/shoots them it is the same as him using his<br/>
finger to pretend he&#39;s shooting someone for whatever<br/>
reason, except they get wet, too. those brightly<br/>
colored supersoaker things are pretty cool sometimes,<br/>
and he doesn&#39;t really think of them as &quot;guns&quot;, as just<br/>
a way to squirt someone. Cool thing is when he plays<br/>
with them, thanks to my darling boyfriend, again, now<br/>
he likes to pretend he&#39;s a firefighter and the people<br/>
are flames. <br/>
oh yeah, I also wanted to add that I think it&#39;s<br/>
important to teach them not to be all critical of<br/>
other kids who are allowed to play guns. I tell them<br/>
that that is thier mommy&#39;s decision and it&#39;s none of<br/>
our business, and they shouldn&#39;t be embarrassing and<br/>
rude by saying &quot;that&#39;s bad.&quot; or something like that.<br/>
I&#39;d rather them say &quot;*I* don&#39;t want to play that.&quot; or<br/>
&quot;*I&#39;m* not allowed to play that, let&#39;s play something<br/>
else.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899730910">hm. see, i actualy LIKE hearing things like this. i<br/>
guess I must thrive on diversity. It would be just a<br/>
bit tooo wierd if everyone agreed here. <br/>
And also i would like to say everyone has been so<br/>
respectful and non-defensive on this topic, even<br/>
though this could very easily be a very sensitive and<br/>
volatile subject. Thanks for keeping it nice so far.<br/>

&gt; hanging on the wall, but they <br/>
&gt; were not functional. They were there for sentimental<br/>
&gt; reasons and were old. My <br/>
&gt; Dad did not hunt or own a gun that worked but as a<br/>
&gt; kid he did hunt. I loved <br/>
&gt; guns as a kid. Not sure why. I had a cool pop gun<br/>
&gt; and at 5 talked my Mom into <br/>
&gt; letting me have a cowboy suit, complete with holster<br/>
&gt; and guns. Her main <br/>
&gt; concern was that the pants zipped up the front. ( I<br/>
&gt; remember her talking to <br/>
&gt; her friends about whether it would be improper to<br/>
&gt; let me own such a pair of <br/>
&gt; pants) My, haven&#39;t times changed. My brothers both<br/>
&gt; had BB guns but by the <br/>
&gt; time I was old enough to have one I had lost my gun<br/>
&gt; interest and replaced it <br/>
&gt; with an interest in animals. I was upset that anyone<br/>
&gt; would hunt them. ( both <br/>
&gt; my brothers lost their interests in guns too) My<br/>
&gt; husband grew up with hunting <br/>
&gt; being a big part of his life. His family depended on<br/>
&gt; his Father&#39;s ability to <br/>
&gt; hunt in the winter months when he was laid off work.<br/>
&gt; All the boy&#39;s hunted and <br/>
&gt; it was certainly a different kind of life than the<br/>
&gt; one I was raised in. It <br/>
&gt; was liked they lived in a different time period!<br/>
&gt; When our oldest son became <br/>
&gt; fascinated with guns we let him have toy guns. And<br/>
&gt; then when he was 11 he got <br/>
&gt; a BB gun. My husband, who seldom has time to hunt<br/>
&gt; now, was looking forward to <br/>
&gt; hunting with the oldest someday. He spent a lot time<br/>
&gt; teaching the kids gun <br/>
&gt; safety, they all like to target practice with Dad.<br/>
&gt; Then a funny thing <br/>
&gt; happened to the oldest boy called Animal Planet. He<br/>
&gt; loves the shows on that <br/>
&gt; channel. And now he loves animals and has no desire<br/>
&gt; to hunt them. My husband <br/>
&gt; was very disappointed. Second son never had an<br/>
&gt; interest in guns or hunting. <br/>
&gt; And the girls do not either. So you never know how<br/>
&gt; things will turn out. I <br/>
&gt; personally do not like guns and now the only guns we<br/>
&gt; have in the house are <br/>
&gt; black powder which my husband uses to hunt deer, if<br/>
&gt; he has time. So I guess <br/>
&gt; you never know how it is going to turn out. <br/>
&gt; peace and grace <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830186130">Ok, this is a lightweight story for you regarding guns and their uses and <br/>
misuses. <br/>
<br/>
My partners family used to hunt all the time when living in Africa (for food <br/>
- not trophies) and so are very at ease with firearms. Being a squeamish <br/>
little city girl by comparison, they thought they would give me the chance to <br/>
be more comfortable with a gun by target practise.<br/>
<br/>
We set the targets up, split into teams and shot away. My partner&#39;s mother <br/>
complaining loudly that the gun was useless and wouldn&#39;t fire straight. After <br/>
several such moans, we discovered the problem - she had the aiming eye shut <br/>
and the other one open.<br/>
<br/>
Seems an ideal compromise between shooting and killing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432066079">&lt;&lt; At the risk of criticism, I wish to say that I&#39;d rather my kids play with <br/>
 guns than lie.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No criticism here.  I&#39;m assuming that by the word &quot;gun&quot; in this statement you <br/>
mean a toy gun?  I don&#39;t really care much if my kids play with toy guns.  I <br/>
would even buy them one if they couldn&#39;t be gently persuaded to something <br/>
else.  I just give it as little attention as possible which, so far, has had <br/>
the desired effect, they aren&#39;t interested in them.<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt;In such a case, I would recommend for my kids say &quot;I don&#39;t want to be <br/>
around <br/>
 guns, so I&#39;m going home,&quot; or just &quot;I&#39;m going home now.&quot;   Dishonesty, even <br/>
to <br/>
 oneself, is a harm that goes soul deep and can affect those who&#39;ve never had <br/>
 a toy gon or a game with a picture of a gun.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree on the damage that lying causes.  This is the reason that until my dd <br/>
reached a point of reason she simply never went alone to a home that I wasn&#39;t <br/>
certain about.  That means that I knew the parents VERY well, knew they had <br/>
no guns for one thing.  Honesty is ALL situations was taught and modeled.<br/>
<br/>
However, the actions and choice of words for this situation were carefully <br/>
thought out and considered.  I also waited for a time of maturity when my dd <br/>
would be able to separate the honest person she is from a moment of crisis <br/>
that may call for lying.  Yes, I do believe there are rare events which a <br/>
higher calling takes precedence.<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday my dd and I were discussing the &quot;Black Market&quot; and what it <br/>
means.  I explained that it is generally used for illegal activity and greed. <br/>
 I added that it has been used for good but rarely.  From here we discussed <br/>
WWII and the Nazi occupation in Europe and how some folks used the BM to <br/>
obtain goods, food and medication to do good, like aiding Jews in hiding.  <br/>
She was shocked to learn that I was in agreement with this kind of action.<br/>
<br/>
From here we went discussed civil disobedience and lying for a greater good.  <br/>
It was an opportunity for me to restate MY beliefs on this issue.  Deciding <br/>
to take an action like this requires brutal honesty in self-examination <br/>
because the temptation to do this for selfish reasons is strong.<br/>
<br/>
My two reasons for advising her to use this particular statement, worded the <br/>
way it is are:<br/>
1)  To avoid any hesitation on her part.  It can be hard for a kid to take a <br/>
stand and even though she is usually good at this, I don&#39;t want her to wait <br/>
even a few seconds before getting out of there.<br/>
2)  To avoid the other kids from trying to stop her from leaving.  I don&#39;t <br/>
want them to stand in her way or try to persuade her because they are afraid <br/>
shes going to &quot;tell&quot; or get them in trouble somehow.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, I am sure that I want her to &quot;lie&quot; to get out of there and we have <br/>
discussed &quot;why&quot; in detail, more than once.  I would rather she violate her <br/>
own conscience in a moment like this than risk death.  I&#39;ve also told her <br/>
that she can say or do ANYTHING if she is in a dangerous situation, ie; being <br/>
approached by someone whom she feels is threatening.  A few months ago she <br/>
was on the sidewalk and a man pulled up next to her in a car and began to <br/>
talk to her.  She was caught off guard and blurted, &quot;Thats my mom calling!&quot; <br/>
and ran away.  Yes she could have just run but maybe she needed to say that <br/>
to get her feet moving.  I was absolutely FINE with what she did.<br/>

<br/>
I was discussing all this with a close friend last night.  On another list <br/>
we&#39;re on, the past few days have also involved guns and honesty, <br/>
coincidently, and that was about what factors might affect or totally <br/>
preclude an SCA teacher/student relationship.  Monday I had written that <br/>
although I don&#39;t like or have guns, gun ownership wouldn&#39;t be a big factor <br/>
for me with students, but honesty was my big #1.<br/>
<br/>
So in telling him that this list had come to the juncture of guns and honesty <br/>
too, on the the next day, he made this point:<br/>
<br/>
If a child is taught that there are times when lying is acceptable, the <br/>
parents should not be surprised when the children then lie to the parents.  <br/>
Moments of crisis and rare events will happen between teens and parents.<br/>
<br/>
And I didn&#39;t mean toy guns.  I meant that I would rather give my children <br/>
real guns to play with than to teach them to lie.<br/>

I understand and respect the ideology you are working from.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;And I didn&#39;t mean toy guns.  I meant that I would rather give my children <br/>
 real guns to play with than to teach them to lie.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We differ on this.  I would rather risk being lied to later and have her <br/>
survive her childish years to be able to make this choice.  She has never <br/>
been punished for lying, although I have expressed my concerns for her <br/>
character and self-image.  I have not discovered a lie from her for many <br/>
years now.<br/>
<br/>
I trust in her ability to separate actions in a crisis event from her life as <br/>
an honest person.  Honesty is a life long matter of choice, even those <br/>
children who are taught that it&#39;s NEVER okay to lie will come to terms with <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
For me honesty is just a factor of my ethics and values.  Do I allow honesty <br/>
to become the goal, even to the point of violating my morality?  Would I have <br/>
been honest with a Nazi if I was hiding Jews?  I think I would have lied, <br/>
convincinly too, to honor my higher calling.  I would have been comfortable <br/>
in facing God with this lie in my past as well.<br/>
<br/>
As I said I respect your ethics, even understand them but I know I could not <br/>
follow them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628801205">THIS I completely in all wayz without anything<br/>
contrary to say (my boyfriend would be amazed) agree<br/>
here. My kids get in trouble for lying more than<br/>
anything else at all. That includes deception that<br/>
isn&#39;t neccesarily direct lying (sneaking in any way)<br/>
and now they are at the point (dd is still catching<br/>
on) that before I even find out ds will come to me<br/>
crying and say he lied and snuck such and such trying<br/>
to &quot;trick&quot; me. <br/>
I tell them that lying to me (or anyone) is the same<br/>
as punching them in the face, and if they wouldn&#39;t<br/>
want to hurt them like that (physically, punching,<br/>
hitting, etc) then they shouldn&#39;t lie to them. <br/>
It seems to do the trick.<br/>
I would rather hear the worst truth in the world,<br/>
especially someone I love than be lied to.<br/>
That just doubles the problem.<br/>

&gt;thought of using a real gun on anyone! Just my opinion.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Wake up call.  The reserach has already been done and that is why laws have<br/>
&gt; been passed about what toy guns can look like.  Not that it has done much<br/>
&gt; good so far!  AND, since even the cops can&#39;t tell the difference between<br/>
&gt; real guns and play guns in some instances, I seriously doubt that a child<br/>
&gt; can.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At a distance, when someone is pretending a fake gun is real and pointing it<br/>
swiftly at you, in a tense situation, in poor lighting, with fear as a<br/>
factor, if you forgot your glasses and were not close enough to see the<br/>
muscles involved in holding up a real gun vs. a fake one, you can make this<br/>
mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at a real and a fake next to each other in decent lighting up close,<br/>
and definitely by lifting one, it&#39;s very, very easy to tell the difference.<br/>
<br/>
Guns are heavy and bulky with real bulk and feel and look and smell like<br/>
solid, serious weapons. Toy guns are just bits of plastic. I imagine there<br/>
are amazingly well-made fakes out there that until you lifted them you<br/>
couldn&#39;t really tell, but that&#39;s not your run of the mill Toys R Us special.<br/>
<br/>
This is not to say I think carrying around fake guns that look at all real<br/>
is a good idea. In the home, in the yard, no problem. In the car, out and<br/>
about, there is IMHO a risk that at a quick and nervous glance people won&#39;t<br/>
know which is which.<br/>
<br/>
I always find it interesting that people focus on whether there are guns in<br/>
the house when they send their kids &quot;over to play&quot;. I&#39;d be a lot more<br/>
interested to know if there were child abusers, including people who shout<br/>
at or hit their own children (this kind of uproar would terrify mine), or<br/>
large untrained dogs, or many other hazards. By the time my children are old<br/>
enough to &quot;go visiting&quot; alone, guns will be (already are) old and boring to<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday at the state fair, my almost-4 year old was thrown about 5 feet by<br/>
the whack of a cow&#39;s large, heavy and irritated head swinging into her. It<br/>
knocked the wind out of her, bloodied her nose, and scared her to bits.<br/>
After that experience, I&#39;m more worried about accessible cattle and folks<br/>
who don&#39;t necessarily know what they&#39;re doing, like me: I stupidly let her<br/>
stand at the side of the cow pen where she could get hit instead of directly<br/>
in front where the structure of the pen would prevent it. I didn&#39;t know cows<br/>
DID that -- none of us standing there knew it -- but my daughters know what<br/>
guns do. They didn&#39;t know not to stand to the side of a cow, they do know<br/>
not to point a gun at someone.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people think their dogs won&#39;t bite and don&#39;t ever see the warning<br/>
signs until a kid gets half his face bitten off. &quot;He turned on him without<br/>
warning&quot; is a fairy tale. 99.9% of severe dogs bites can be seen coming a<br/>
mile away if you know what you&#39;re looking at. In 12 years of dog training as<br/>
a profession, specializing in aggression problems, I was surprise-bitten by<br/>
one dog. She was just-plain-nuts, and that happens hardly ever.<br/>
<br/>
This is not to say that guns are harmless, or should be taken lightly, but I<br/>
think they get taken too heavily, too. You can&#39;t just say, &quot;be careful of<br/>
guns&quot;, you have to live careful of guns, and raise children who care about<br/>
taking care with anything of potential danger -- guns, dogs, cattle, people<br/>
who scream at children.<br/>

<br/>
Also, people don&#39;t necessarily only &quot;focus&quot; on whether or not there are guns<br/>

their rules for houses re: guns.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, this I don&#39;t doubt. I said *I* could tell the difference between<br/>
run-of-the-mill (i.e, the ones most people are likely to pick up for their<br/>
kids for a couple of bucks at the toy store) fake guns and real ones if I<br/>
were looking at them in person under calm circumstances, and I believe so<br/>
can most police and other people who know something about real guns.<br/>
<br/>
Not the difference between &quot;really good fakes&quot; (I&#39;m thinking of people who<br/>
may collect model guns which are very intricately done, and may even be made<br/>
of real-gun materials so it really WOULD be hard to tell the difference --<br/>
except that I doubt they put gun oil on these to clean them &lt;g&gt; so that&#39;s<br/>

I don&#39;t know if the guns in the picture are really good fakes or real or<br/>
even just regular toys guns, because you just can&#39;t see size or really any<br/>
clear detail, you can&#39;t smell them, you can&#39;t look from different angles,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s likely that MANY people might mistake a toy gun of somewhat real<br/>
appearance for fake if they&#39;d never been around real guns -- the same way<br/>
the media and the police identify the some of the most un-Pit-Bull possible<br/>
dogs as Pit Bulls when the dogs bite someone.<br/>
