<div id="ygrps-yiv-893574348">Thank you for you advice. I am new to unschooling and have not gotten<br/>
completely comfortable with it yet. I hear so much about the emphasis<br/>
on the importance of MATH that I panic when I don&#39;t see Azure doing<br/>
any (I just haven&#39;t noticed that, yes, she is really doing &quot;math&quot; in<br/>
everyday life!) Your words are comforting to me and I will check out<br/>
your website. I am new to this list, but already I know it will be<br/>
very valuable to me. I appreciate any and all advice that I am given -<br/>
thank you. I guess that I am more comfortable with unschooling other<br/>
subjects and just need to treat math the same way. I know that (in my<br/>
head at least) she will learn what she needs to know for college, I<br/>
just get scared and revert to my old home &quot;school&quot; thinking. This list<br/>
is awesome. I am not alone, I now know people who also unschooling and<br/>
they are sucessful in raising educated kids. I have a lot to learn<br/>
about letting go of my old thinking.</div>
