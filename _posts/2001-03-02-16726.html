<div id="ygrps-yiv-910658120">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Janice, and I have been teaching my three kids at home <br/>
since the very beginning of their learning years.  I have tried many <br/>
approaches, and to be honest, I feel I need a little encouragement, <br/>
since I&#39;ve gone off the structured road to a less structured path, <br/>
and I wonder sometimes if I&#39;m on the right track.  I would very much <br/>
like to hear your feelings, suggestions, and practical suggestions <br/>
for keeping three kids in 7th, 6th, and 2nd grade up to par, but <br/>
learning properly, and maintaining my sanity if at all possible.  I <br/>
know I&#39;m burned out at this point, but I don&#39;t have much of a support <br/>
system, and the kids are getting to thee point where they don&#39;t <br/>
listen as well as they used to.  I have CD rom programs, I have big <br/>
all in one type books, and I allow everything to be a lesson in their <br/>
day.  I would very much appreciate your help and understanding, and I <br/>
hope to do the same for you somehow.  Thank you so much, Janice</div>

<br/>
Much better than this list for encouragement would be to go to <br/>
www.unschooling.com and read in the library/essays, and read the recent <br/>
postings in folders.  There&#39;s scads of inspiration there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239623356">Hi Janice,<br/>
    We seem to be a very quiet list this week.  I wonder if everyone is<br/>
having nicer weather?  We had friends over last night, stayed up late and<br/>
this morning are sort of .... not moving very much. &lt;G&gt;  I&#39;m going to try<br/>
and answer some of your thoughts, but don&#39;t be surprised if I ramble a lot.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I feel I need a little encouragement,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Was the structured track the right one?<br/>
<br/>
 I would very much<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; like to hear your feelings, suggestions, and practical suggestions<br/>
&gt; for keeping three kids in 7th, 6th, and 2nd grade up to par,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is really hard for most unschoolers to answer.  First you have to<br/>
define what is *up to par*, whose par?<br/>
<br/>
but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; learning properly,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What would learning improperly look like?  But more importantly, what is<br/>
your working definition of working properly??<br/>
<br/>
**and maintaining my sanity if at all possible. **<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this is part of the equation. I think parenting as an<br/>
occupation is designed to make us all question the concept of sanity. &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 I   know I&#39;m burned out at this point, but I don&#39;t have much of a support<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; system, and the kids are getting to thee point where they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; listen as well as they used to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s where we can help, but first we have to have more specifics. What has<br/>
created your burn out?  What are you burned out from?? Is it standing over<br/>
them making them do *school*? Is it just being the one responsible for the<br/>
family and household, the laundry, the food, the noise, the cleanliness?<br/>
and children are supposed to grow up into adults who think for themselves,<br/>
not listening is a sign of growth, which is good.<br/>
<br/>
 I have CD rom programs, I have big<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; all in one type books, and I allow everything to be a lesson in their<br/>
&gt; day.  I would very much appreciate your help and understanding, and I<br/>
&gt; hope to do the same for you somehow.  Thank you so much, Janice<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of the problem may be looking at life as a series of lessons.  It is,<br/>
but most of those lessons are silent moments of understanding how the world<br/>
works, or what makes mom and dad tick or get ticked.  Not everything in life<br/>
is an academic lesson, nor should it be.  And I don&#39;t feel our children need<br/>
to spend hours a day hunting for academic lessons, I would prefer they just<br/>
live.   Most of the time academics take care of themselves and sometimes we<br/>
approach a topic with intention.<br/>
<br/>
Tell us what life was looking like and what you did to change things... and<br/>
then maybe we can help you understand???<br/>
