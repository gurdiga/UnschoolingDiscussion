<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667409641">Hope this doesn&#39;t get me into trouble! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Dh has been dabbling in the guitar repair biz lately. He&#39;s <br/>
repaired/modified a few of his own as well as one belonging to a <br/>
friends&#39; kid. He does good work and he&#39;s VERY meticulous.<br/>
<br/>
However, he can&#39;t start charging for the service until he gets some <br/>
more experience. So if anyone has an electric guitar in need of <br/>
repair lmk and I&#39;ll pass on the info so he can decide whether or not <br/>
it&#39;s a repair he can handle. All you&#39;d have to pay for is shipping <br/>
(we&#39;re in Utah) and parts.<br/>
<br/>
Any takers??? Beth</div>
