&gt; I think the above is so true and will comfort you if you let it. It<br/>
&gt; is so hard and so sad when &#39;friends&#39; turn on you when you are doing<br/>
&gt; what you believe is right and letting your children do what they want<br/>
&gt; and need to do. You have been a wonderful friend to the mom and<br/>
&gt; especially the daughter!<br/>
&gt; Hold on and keep talking here, so you know you are not the crazy one!<br/>

do value this list enormously.  Have been lurking here on and off for <br/>
awhile.  Am glad to be back.<br/>
