**They celebrate easter, christmas, passover, winter/summer solstices (we<br/>
 have a great outdoor wooded circle...there is a stream that runs through<br/>
the church<br/>
 property and we own a lot of land that we keep mostly in its natural<br/>
state). I loved<br/>
 that a couple of weeks ago my 3 yo had a seder in his RE class and then<br/>
went and<br/>
 joined another class to decorate easter eggs. :o**<br/>
<br/>
This sounds wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll check it out this weekend.<br/>
