<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502493193">Those of you who have watched me struggle with my son&#39;s non-reading and <br/>
then very slow reading, will understand how much the subject line means.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
While we were on our holiday (which actually was the week from hell - more <br/>
later) Lars read his very first whole book.  It was a young adult science <br/>
fiction type book.  Last year he was only reading the captions and sidebars <br/>
in his biking magazines, and this spring he had started to read the <br/>
articles and interviews.  I&#39;m not sure just why he started the book and <br/>
kept on with it, but you can bet I&#39;m happy about it.<br/>

issue at that time, insisting on phonics work.  Big mistake.  I often <br/>
wonder whether he would have taken off with it earlier if I&#39;d left him alone.<br/>
