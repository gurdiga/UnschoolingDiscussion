<div id="ygrps-yiv-378601214">We were watching the news on tv and a discussion ensued that was one of<br/>
those things that dominoed from news to politicians to honesty to is tv bad<br/>
to can parents model behaviors that will counteract the effects of<br/>
television.<br/>
<br/>
Which all led to a discussion of does honesty pay and do people who claim to<br/>
be honest/never lie fall under the &quot;me thinks he doth protest too much.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The general concensus of the kidlets was that politicians generally aren&#39;t<br/>
honest and that they &quot;fudge&quot; on the truth, most of the time without any<br/>
consequences and thus can be a bad influence if they see anything similar at<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
For example, part of the discussion was &quot;are there gray areas when it comes<br/>
to telling the truth or is the truth black and white.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
then the discussion went on to a discussion of whether a person should ever<br/>
advise a child to lie to their parents because the person doesn&#39;t agree with<br/>
what the parents are doing.<br/>
<br/>
Should that person then claim to be an honest person even though they advise<br/>
others to lie.  And wouldn&#39;t that behavior be modeling to their children<br/>
that honesty is only required when it is convenient?  Which brought us back<br/>
to politicians and there being few consequences to their lying which models<br/>
that lying is only bad if you get caught.<br/>
<br/>
A most interesting evening and one of the joys of unschooling.<br/>

She said that she is starting to wonder how much effect spin doctors <br/>
have on our view of the Isreal/Palestine thing.  Locally she knows a <br/>
man who &#39;spin&#39; stuff on a state level and she has become intimately <br/>
familiar with the effects it has.  Now she is questioning everything. <br/>
 I didn&#39;t have the heart to tell her that I figured the spin thing out <br/>
when I was about 15.  I NEVER take any news source as gospel, and I <br/>
believe the only way to get even close to the truth is to be there.  <br/>
Baring that, the best option is to examine lots if different kinds of <br/>
news sources and the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-968532210">Ya know, I think it is something you or Mark wrote a long time ago. The<br/>
kidlets loved it and put it in their scrapbook of favorite sayings but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t say where they got it or who wrote it.  They were looking through<br/>
the scrapbook a couple of days ago because they are going to make somemore<br/>
t-shirts and bumper stickers and pulled it out with a bunch of others.  So I<br/>
think I have borrowed it second hand &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-474235018">We were tossing about an idea IRL a while back.  We want to make <br/>
copycat bumperstickers that say: &quot;DARE to keep kids off school.&quot;<br/>
We think there mught be a copyright problem with it though.<br/>
