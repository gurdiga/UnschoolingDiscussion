Don&#39;t appologize for the off-topicality.  It&#39;s probably the most educational<br/>
assessment of a real courtroom I&#39;ve read in a long time.  It&#39;s also one of<br/>
the most painful things I&#39;ve read lately.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for doing what most citizens seem interested in getting out of,<br/>
and obviously doing it well.  As someone who&#39;s always had an excuse to get<br/>
out of jury duty (I&#39;ve never been living even remotely close to Illinois<br/>
when called!), I appreciate that.<br/>
