<div><font face="Arial" size="2">P.S. I forgot to mention that we don&#39;t have very 
many children in our neighborhood.&nbsp; (that was the topic, afterall)&nbsp; We 
have friends come over and visit..I was lucky to find the only other kid on my 
street..is also homeschooled, so that&#39;s a plus..the meetings for the 
TPA(Teaching Parents Association)&nbsp; are pleasant to attend and mingle with 
the parents &amp; kids...they are usuallly at the park or a library, but 
honestly we don&#39;t go that often.&nbsp; Most of my friends kids are in public 
school, but one family is like an extended family to us, and we visit them 
frequently, as they do us...they are all older than my son, but the relationship 
&amp; interaction he has with them are great.&nbsp; I don&#39;t subscribe to the 
socialization thing.....I think todays society is rather OVER 
SOCIALIZED.....before young minds have strength &amp; belief in themselves, they 
are influenced on who to become by others..always comparing themselves to 
everyone else, when there really is no true COmparison.&nbsp; It&#39;s nice to have 
other kids over, this weekend we have our friend Nick over, and Zain loves 
playing all weekend with his friend.....it isn&#39;t very often he seems deprived of 
other childrens presence, when it begins to feel that way , we just go visit 
someone, or have someone come visit us...but it&#39;s not mandatory, or 
constant.&nbsp; We&#39;re lucky to have the couple of good friends we do have, and 
they are like family, and Zain is well integrated with social situations, 
despite not being around other kids constantly.&nbsp; Everything in moderation, 
I think..and it works, well.&nbsp; As long as the experiences we all share are 
full of Life, Love, Fun &amp; Quality.......that is all we need.</font></div>
