<br/>
I don&#39;t know why you feel she&#39;s an intrusion in your bed. Your marital <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-864605692">Well, I defiantly don&#39;t feel she is an intrusion in our lives, I feel blessed every day I get to be with her. I am a stay at home mom, and I guess I just meant it was easy to get into a routine, and am trying not to neglect either relationship. My husband and I both think that the family bed is very important for bonding, and he likes it because he has to be away from her all day at work, it is kind of our family time. Once we go to bed, we all lay around and talk, sing, sometimes play games, it is ended up being a nice end of the day routine. I very much enjoy that. <br/>
I guess I have just been taken by surprise by her need to be with us more often instead of less! I have been trying to think of ways to work with this somewhat new schedule of no naps as well. With Courtney sleeping with us since we brought her home from the hospital, we were used to taking advantage of the times when we were alone. But we have really been missing her naps!! :o) I know we just need to learn to be creative again. <br/>

&gt;One thing that popped into my head Candy was letting Courtney &#39;fall <br/>
&gt;asleep&#39; in your bed with you guys and then you two sneaking out into the <br/>
&gt;living room, or letting Courtney sleep on the couch for a bit and you two <br/>
&gt;sneak into the bedroom while keeping the tv on in the living room maybe?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or just trade beds for a bit.  Courtney doesn&#39;t want to sleep in her <br/>
bed.  So you guys hang out there for a while.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
