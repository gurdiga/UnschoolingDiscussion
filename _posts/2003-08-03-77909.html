<div id="ygrps-yiv-538537211">Now I can sleep!  My dearest daughter made it all the way to Montana!  She&#39;s <br/>
in Billings now.  Will stay in hotel for the night, then meet Glenn Storrs, <br/>
Ph. D. Director of Science Research & Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology & <br/>
Director of the Cincinnati Museum Center&#39;s Dinosaur Field School in Montana.  He&#39;ll <br/>
be training them first, then taking them to their cabins (7000 feet above sea <br/>
level) then to the dig site on the Northwest flank of the Bighorn Mountains <br/>
of south-central Montana.  At some point during the week they will also be <br/>
going to Yellowstone National Park.<br/>
<br/>
As I hear more from her, I&#39;ll let you all know (though, LOL, I doubt I&#39;ll <br/>
hear from her much; it sounded like she was having just too much fun already--she <br/>
already said it&#39;s the most fun she&#39;s had on ANY trip she&#39;s EVER taken, so I <br/>
take that as &quot;mom, I won&#39;t be calling you, tehe).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for thinking of her/us and for all your prayers for a safe <br/>
trip out.  I know she&#39;ll be fine, but it&#39;s just a mother&#39;s worry.<br/>
