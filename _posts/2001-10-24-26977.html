&lt;&lt; Fifteen hours on a plane? Yikes. I&#39;m assuming, then, that it&#39;s an<br/>
 international flight, and those are really even safer...<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
  No it takes 12 hours (before) from airport to airport to airport to <br/>
airport. It is hell. I have tried non stops and hops neither is great. non <br/>
stops are actually worse. I have also tried many different times of day. My <br/>
dd has been traveling since she was 6 months old. It was actually easier <br/>
then,even when I was stuck in JFK for 6 hours extra.If that happened at 5 I <br/>
would probably have a break down.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote> I have an incredibly sensitive child, and it&#39;s been a real learning<br/>
 experience for me. Five was a hard year for her, as was six... but one<br/>
 thing I realized was that my expectations often had a lot to do with her<br/>
 responses.<br/>
<br/>
    5 is much more of a challenge than I thought it would be. Though some of <br/>
her issues have gotten less intense. Thankfully.<br/>
  <br/>
bit in the face by my parents&#39; previously traumatized<br/>
 dog, for no reason that we can figure - he&#39;s done this before, although<br/>
 not for a long time, he fear-bites and we haven&#39;t figured out the<br/>
 trigger. It was pretty scary, for a good 20 minutes she just sat there in<br/>
 shock with my arms around her, then finally she relaxed enough to lean<br/>
 back onto me, and it took over an hour before she really came around. But<br/>
 two hours after it happened, she called the dog over and patted his head<br/>
 and forgave him - she does love this dog, and he does love him.<br/>
 <br/>
    It is evolved for her to forgive, but I would never let my child play w/ <br/>
a dog who bit. Fear or not. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And yeah, most  people might think they should get rid of this dog, but<br/>
 </span></blockquote> it&#39;s not gonna happen...<br/>
<br/>
   Then when my child came over the dog would have to be put in another room. <br/>
I have seen what dog bites can do. No way.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; Also in <br/>
 &gt; my grocery store I doubt I will see another being subdued. Small <br/>
 &gt; town living.<br/>
 &gt; <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote> :-) The town we actually live in permanently is too small to even have a<br/>
 grocery store, but stuff happens everywhere..<br/>
 <br/>
    Very true.<br/>

&lt;&lt; So, *finally* my reason for posting: how do the rest of you negotiate your <br/>
family lives? Are gender roles a concern at all in your unschooling? Mostly <br/>
moms are on these lists -- any dads or other men on this list who can respond <br/>
from your point of view?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Well, I am a SAHM and my dh is a building contractor. Very typical gender <br/>
stereotype. But I am in no way miss homemaker. DD wants to work w/ daddy when <br/>
she gets older. She goes w/ him now when I go away climbing or even for short <br/>
times when I need to go somewhere. She has been involved in meetings, and she <br/>
has witnessed 2 firings. Last night she was painting and helping dh use the <br/>
finish nailer in our remodel project. Also she wants to race motorcycles. <br/>
Then again she wants to ride like mommy and moans for a pony daily. I believe <br/>
she is right in the middle thanks to us. I was too though. My mother was <br/>
single by the time I was 2 and had many an odd job for a woman esp. in the <br/>
70s. The worst she says was being on the pipecrew. That is underground laying <br/>
of pipe for water works.<br/>
<br/>
   I have noticed dd has many questions about gender typing though. She can <br/>
not understand why they don&#39;t make ScoobyDo (sp?) underwear for her. Some one <br/>
said they do but I can&#39;t find them. She does notice and I explain. I have <br/>
also had to explain how 2 women and 2 men have children together.The other <br/>
night dh had to explain why most men do mot wear skirts but some do. Also why <br/>
men stand to pee is a huge topic. I have tried to explain a woman can too but <br/>
she is skeptical.:o)<br/>
<br/>
   Enough.<br/>
