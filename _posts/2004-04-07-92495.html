<div id="ygrps-yiv-429078770">Libby&#39;s on Unschoooling-101. We IMed a bit last night. I asked her to post @ <br/>
-101 and the message boards about this. I thought I&#39;d bring it here too.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s very interested in how peaceful/gentle parenting works and is ready for <br/>
a change---not just for this child, but the others as well.<br/>

Anyone here who has/is dealing with a child with FAS? We have a four year old <br/>
son who joined our family two years ago and was a little wild cat. He has <br/>
severe ADHD/ODD and is being referred to the FAS clinic at the Marcus <br/>
Institute <br/>
for further evaluation. He was tested by the neuropsychology department at <br/>
Scottish Rite Children&#39;s Hospital last year and is functioning at the <br/>
borderline <br/>
level of intelligence in some areas and moderately intellectually delayed in <br/>
others. He also has dysmorphic features, fine motor skill delays and seizure <br/>
disorder.<br/>
<br/>
We are searching for ways to help him learn to manage himself. He doesn&#39;t <br/>
like large groups, another reason for making the decision to unschool him. He <br/>
currently attends special education pre-k for half day. I only recently <br/>
became a <br/>
stay-at-home parent so he&#39;s now able to come home much earlier than he has <br/>
for <br/>
the past two years. He&#39;ll need to continue to receive some services through <br/>
the public school system (speech, OT) so there will still be times when he <br/>
can&#39;t be totally/only at home.<br/>
<br/>
Our biggest dilemma is dealing with behavior issues. We&#39;ve used timeouts and <br/>
removal of privileges....which I&#39;ve learned is a big no-no in this community. <br/>
This child will hit, drag, yank, snatch at another child to get what he <br/>
wants. <br/>
When he first joined our family he actually drew back his hand to hit Judy <br/>
and I if we verbally corrected him for inappropriate behavior. He had to be <br/>
moved from one daycare center for slapping a teacher several times (sorry, <br/>
but <br/>
after the first time, I&#39;d have been a bit more prepared to catch that little <br/>
hand <br/>
in midair had I been her.....or at least dodged it :)<br/>
<br/>
In any case, we&#39;re open to suggestions as to how to help Devon learn how to <br/>
redirect his behavior. We&#39;re implementing play therapy and look for positive <br/>
results from that. If any of you have dealt with a child like or similar to <br/>
Devon, we&#39;d be most interested in hearing from you.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

Well my dd is 4 1/2. It has only been in the last 5 months that she has<br/>
stopped being obnoxious to other children in similar ways that you describe.<br/>
She also still hits us (Daddy and I) sometimes when she is especially<br/>
frustrated, although I am pleased to say that she has pretty much stopped<br/>
biting when furious. My point is that these behaviors are not necessarily<br/>
exclusively tied to the various learning and physiological issues you have<br/>
described in his history, but are partly to do with emotional maturity.<br/>
My experience, limited as it is, is that little folk *don&#39;t* always, or even<br/>
often, respond to verbal corrections especially if they are in a meltdown.<br/>
What I would do with Jayn, when she did some unpleasant and apparently<br/>
unprovoked action towards another child, was/is:<br/>
First wait and see if the other child was going to protest to Jayn, take<br/>
action on her own behalf like walk away, or if they would work it out<br/>
between them (not if the other was much younger/smaller - but then I would<br/>
be nearer to prevent anything in that situation.) <br/>
Then if either the other child looked like they were about to get upset, or<br/>
it looked like it might escalate, I would step in. (I should give the caveat<br/>
that I step in at once if I see that Jayn is watching me as she does this<br/>
stuff (like toss sand) because it is clear that her agenda is about me, not<br/>
the other kid in that instance.)<br/>
I usually get down on the ground, hug Jayn in one arm, and apologize to the<br/>
other child on Jayn&#39;s behalf, and ask if they are hurt. I then remove Jayn.<br/>
In private with her, I would point out how the other child seemed upset, and<br/>
ask her what led up to it, if she was angry, and what she was trying to<br/>
achieve - although usually I can only get a history somewhat later on.<br/>
I came to the realization that Jayn sometimes acted out unpleasantly because<br/>
she was ready to leave, but hadn&#39;t learnt how to say so, or really<br/>
understood inside herself that she was ready to go. This has changed with<br/>
maturity, and her willingness to play both in groups and with a single other<br/>
child, and not always try to take over the game, has increased tremendously.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it will help you to think of your son simply as &quot;younger&quot; than his<br/>
chronological age and engage with him accordingly, rather than &quot;delayed&quot; or<br/>
any of the other labels. By the same token &quot;implementing play therapy&quot; seems<br/>
to be the kind of clinical language that might actually get in the way and<br/>
make it clear to Devon that you have an agenda that is about your goals for<br/>
his behavior. How about just &quot;playing with him&quot; as the language you use?<br/>
My own current struggle with Jayn is dealing with those baffling moments of<br/>
deliberate rebellion, when she looks me right in the eye, laughs and pours<br/>
the water into the carpet. I am so glad that I made a deliberate conscious<br/>
decision never to spank or punish because there are times when I am tempted<br/>
- entirely out of my own frustration. I think it has gotten harder because<br/>
Jayn has now reached the same age I was when I have memories of constant<br/>
spankings, impotent fury and fear of my mother. I know somehow or other that<br/>
these moments come because I have not seen her need soon enough, or not<br/>
given her the attention she needed for long enough.<br/>
