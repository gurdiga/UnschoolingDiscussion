<div id="ygrps-yiv-690968302">For what it is worth, here is my two cents.<br/>
<br/>
Your son is old enough to start thinking about WHY he does things.  Sit down<br/>
and talk to him, I mean really talk to him, not just lecture ... it may be<br/>
an issue of jealousy or he just may not be getting it with regard to his<br/>
behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes having a quiet conversation where the child is made to THINK and<br/>
not allowed to answer with an &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;just because&quot; can be more<br/>
painful than a &quot;simple&quot; spanking.  Make him connect his behaviors with<br/>
consequences and feelings and be empathetic with his sister&#39;s position in<br/>
this.  Try explaining that he needs to be more mature in his response to the<br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
Also, start taking away previliges and toys.  I personally use all types of<br/>
discipline ... from counting to three to time-outs to restrictions to<br/>
spanking as an absolute last resort.  My kids know that I had better not<br/>
have to get to the spanking part because if I do, there are also other<br/>
punishments that go with it including a lecture from me, from their dad, and<br/>
extreme loss of privileges ... I consider it just that serious ... the older<br/>
they get the less this has been necessary, I haven&#39;t had to reach this level<br/>
with my 11 year old and 8 year old for over a year.  I just had to spank my<br/>
five year old last week ... but it was for continuation of some unsafe<br/>
behaviors with the two year old, behaviors that she had previously been<br/>
disciplined for in other ways.  In addition to the spanking and lecture, she<br/>
went a week without tv (not that we watch that much anyway) and lost pool<br/>
privileges and a few other things as well.  She almost slipped into the old<br/>
problem again yesterday and I reminded her of the consequences and if she<br/>
wanted them to be strung out longer .... it flipped the light switch on and<br/>
so far so good.<br/>
<br/>
The issue for the parent is CONSISTENCY.  Whatever you do, it must be<br/>
consistent!!!<br/>
<br/>
For your son, I would try the conversation about WHY he&#39;s doing what he is<br/>
doing.  There are some siblings that just really grate on each other&#39;s<br/>
nerves, their personalities just don&#39;t mesh well.  You may wind up having to<br/>
make allowances for that.  You son might get irritated when she invades his<br/>
space ... physically and emotionally.  There could be any number of<br/>
non-obvious reasons for his behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Folks like me can tell you what WE do and give lots of advice &lt;wry grin&gt; but<br/>
in truth, sometimes you just have to find out what works for you and your<br/>
family ... down to what works with each child individually.  Wish I had more<br/>
to offer you.  I deal with a similar issue between my five year old daughter<br/>
and two year old daughter.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4yods keeps grabbing things away from 1 1/2yodd, and pushing her, and<br/>
&gt; yelling at her, etc.  I just don&#39;t know what to do anymore.  Nothing<br/>
&gt; seems to work.  Telling him not to, or just holding her and saying<br/>
&gt; something like, &quot;I&#39;m so sad.  I don&#39;t like to see Rachel cry&quot; or<br/>
&gt; anything.  I can&#39;t leave them alone together for half a minute, and<br/>
&gt; even when I&#39;m there, he does this.  She still loves her brother, but<br/>
&gt; she seems to be afraid of him sometimes.  Any suggestions??<br/>
