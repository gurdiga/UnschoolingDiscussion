<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052692440">Who in the world is FlyLady? I must be really out of &quot;it&quot;. The way my <br/>
house looks perhaps I should become more informed about FlyLady.  My <br/>
barn, corral areas and various shelters here are spotless but my <br/>
house? Oh My!! My 81 year old mother has a sign in her kitchen that <br/>
says &quot;My house was clean yesterday. Sorry you missed it!&quot; I need one <br/>
of those signs in every room. Sara</div>
