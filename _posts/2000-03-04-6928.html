<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334274167">tracy, nanci, joshua--<br/>
just thought i would chime in on the youngish parents feeling!  i have aged <br/>
and now all of my agemates have finally begun to have their first and some <br/>
their 2nd child, while we are on number 5.  i am 31, had our eldest at 21.  <br/>
yes, have had a lot to learn along the way, dont we all?  but it gets so much <br/>
easier as you go...  giving me strength for the years ahead where all is <br/>
unknown!<br/>
