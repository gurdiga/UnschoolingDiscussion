 </span></blockquote>Yes.  :-)  This is definitely part of who he is, and rather than try <br/>
to diminish it or, as you say, balance it, find a way to support him <br/>
as he is.  Competitiveness may be off-putting to you, but it&#39;s not <br/>
really about you.  If you can find a way to compete with him *and* <br/>
make it a joyful experience for you and for him, that&#39;s all the <br/>
better!  Seems like your daughter has found a way.  :-)  When he is <br/>
in a situation where he doesn&#39;t win, genuine empathy and quiet, <br/>
respectful listening can go a long way toward helping a bruised <br/>
spirit feel better.<br/>
<br/>
My son could not bear losing a board game to me until only <br/>
recently.  So, I did the best I could to ensure that he did not lose <br/>
when he and I would play something together.  Winning was so <br/>
important to him and meant so little to me.  So, I would sort of <br/>
throw the game, not by cheating, really, but by supporting his <br/>
efforts to win (almost like being on his team).  For me, playing the <br/>
game was more important; for him, winning was more important.  That&#39;s <br/>
just who he is.  I know this, and I love him and try to support him <br/>
in it so each of his moments are as joyful as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Now, when we play games I give it my all, and he, uh, still beats <br/>
me!  Except in arm wrestling, but he&#39;ll be besting me soon in that, I&#39;m sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868701156"> <br/>
I wonder if your husband could back off a bit with the competition.....I think (from what I&#39;ve seen with the neighbor family....5 kids, all very competitive including Dad but not Mom) that the Dad in the family really has the idea that he plays his hardest with the kids so that they&#39;ll &quot;learn&quot; how to be tough, stick it out when they&#39;re losing, etc.  I guess I&#39;ve seen that it&#39;s had the opposite effect on the kids....very low frustration tolerance level for losing anything of any kind.  My kids are naturally not as competitive and really like to play games for the fun value, but usually before we get together with this particular family, we talk about what might be fun and what might turn out to be not so fun, and we just don&#39;t get into the competition with them.  My sense is as kids get older (as Marji noted in her post), they&#39;re just more able to handle all the feelings that go along with losing and winning: feeling inadequate and frustrated,<br/>
 feeling superior, maybe &quot;getting back&quot; at someone for having lost to them earlier, etc.  It begins not to matter as much, if it takes its natural course.  But I think that always bringing the competitive aspect to their attention at this young age might just be adding fuel to the fire....<br/>
Not sure if any of this helps or is applicable to your family, just my .02 on competition!<br/>
Peace, <br/>
Beth in MA<br/>

&gt; me!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like competition, too. I&#39;m able to compete hard and enjoy the  <br/>
results - enjoy that momentary thrill of victory and despair of defeat  <br/>
(the possibility of defeat has to exist or the thrill of victory  <br/>
won&#39;t). But I am mature and able to enjoy that moment and then let it  <br/>
go quickly.<br/>
<br/>
My 17 yo, Rosie, is like this, too. She&#39;s a real competitor - she  <br/>
plays soccer and she WANTS to win. But, she&#39;s a good sport, too. If  <br/>
she loses, she keeps her perspective and can look at the results  <br/>
objectively. She&#39;s very likely to say, &quot;THAT was a great game,&quot; when  <br/>
her team has just lost, for example. The competition is important to  <br/>
her - she enjoys it. Winning is the goal, but it isn&#39;t like THAT is  <br/>
the only source of joy.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not a competitive person, you might not understand the fun  <br/>
and satisfaction of it, but please don&#39;t make it into a personality  <br/>
flaw or a moral failure. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My now-20 year old, Roxana,  could not handle competition very well  <br/>
for most of her life - even now it is maybe just a bit difficult for  <br/>
her. She has a very very strong sense of fair play. Competition isn&#39;t  <br/>
always absolutely fair, and that element of it is very difficult for  <br/>
her. If she was playing on a soccer team and the referee seemed to be  <br/>
making some bad calls against her team, that would infuriate her and  <br/>
lessen the joy of the competition. My 17 yo would brush it off as  <br/>
&quot;part of the game.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t PLAY competitive games with Roxana for quite a few years -  <br/>
just occasionally trying one out and discovering that, yes, she would  <br/>
still get infuriated by it. She handles it fine now - I think she  <br/>
still gets some strong feelings, but keeps them to herself.<br/>
<br/>
So - it isn&#39;t about being competitive, it is more about being nice  <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m bothered by your reaction to your son and husband both being  <br/>
competitive. You worry about it? Is your husband making it worse?<br/>
<br/>
Really - enjoying competition isn&#39;t a negative personality trait at all.<br/>
<br/>
Also, competition usually involves a whole lot of cooperation and  <br/>
collaboration, too. Businesses that compete effectively do so because  <br/>
there is excellent collaboration and cooperation within the company.  <br/>
Teamwork!<br/>
<br/>
Stereotypically and maybe genetically or maybe just culturally, women  <br/>
tend to be less competitive and men more so. Be careful you aren&#39;t  <br/>
falling into a trap of not liking to see some typical masculine traits  <br/>
appearing in your little boy.<br/>
<br/>
Okay - this is an unschooling list -- SUPPORT his interests.<br/>
<br/>
Find ways for him to be competitive, to revel in his competitive  <br/>
nature, to do interesting and exciting things.<br/>
<br/>
We had a Destination Imagination team for about 5 years - this was an  <br/>
absolutely awesome way to both compete AND collaborate. Over the  <br/>
years, the kids learned something SO valuable - they learned that the  <br/>
more they paid attention to their own team having a great time, the  <br/>
more they collaborated happily and harmoniously, the more they  <br/>
supported each other, the more they valued each others&#39; strengths --  <br/>
the better they actually did in the competition.<br/>
<br/>
I love noncompetitive games - I have led cooperative games workshops  <br/>
at homeschooling and unschooling conferences and they are a blast.  <br/>
But, to be honest, there is STILL an element of competition in all  <br/>
games - in cooperative games, the group is working together to achieve  <br/>
some goal - the competition isn&#39;t against each other, but against the  <br/>
obstacles to achieving their common goal.<br/>
<br/>
So - I think these are fun games, for their own sake, but not because  <br/>
I think there is something wrong with competition.<br/>
<br/>
That said, you can help your son develop ethical competitive  <br/>
standards. For example, you can help him realize that winning by  <br/>
cheating isn&#39;t at all satisfying. And you&#39;ll want to help him develop  <br/>
good sportsmanship - appreciation of the other competitors&#39; abilities,  <br/>
kindness to those who aren&#39;t as strong a competitor as he is, etc.<br/>
<br/>
You can help him develop a healthy happy competitive nature if you  <br/>
step back and accept that he has a interest in competition and you,  <br/>
unschooling parent that you are, stand ready support and expand on  <br/>
that interest.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he needs MORE competitive outlet, maybe you&#39;re stifling it.<br/>

<br/>
I like this angle.  I realize now that being competitive is just a part of<br/>
DS&#39;s nature.  And I&#39;m going to support him.  DH is compeitive, and I love<br/>
him and he is a great person.  I can do that with DS.  So instead of<br/>
fighting the competition, I&#39;m going to focus more on the being nice part.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all so much for your support and advice!  It&#39;s so nice to feel<br/>
like there are other&#39;s out there on my side!<br/>

<br/>
My husband doesn&#39;t like cooperative games for the same reason.   <br/>
Kirby, our oldest, was that way about games when he was little.  If  <br/>
it looked like he wasn&#39;t likely to win a board game, he wanted to  <br/>
quit, and let the rest of us finish without him.  It wasn&#39;t fun.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you should avoid public competition (especially of the  <br/>
informal kind) until he&#39;s more in control of his responses.<br/>
<br/>
What about a martial arts class where he could get scores and  <br/>
approval for trying to be the best, and be learning and exercising  <br/>
(and getting some of his energy out) at the same time?  Kirby&#39;s  <br/>
karate involvement helped him to be calmer and more focused in all  <br/>
kinds of situations, and also helped him know *for sure* not to hit  <br/>
people casually or out of frustration.<br/>

My husband was like this with our oldest. I had several talks with <br/>
him about it since it was upsetting our child so much. I asked him <br/>
to just ease up a bit. Let himself be OK with not having to win <br/>
every single time. It wasn&#39;t exactly the same as purposely losing. <br/>
He just stopped going full tilt all the time. <br/>
