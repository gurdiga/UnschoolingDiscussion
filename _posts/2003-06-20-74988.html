<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433231579">I just wanted to vent for a minute and see if I was the only one out <br/>
there who thinks this way.  <br/>
<br/>
Let me give you a little background.  My niece goes to day care <br/>
and is there most of the day.  As soon as my SIL (no  longer <br/>
married to my brother) and my niece get home, my SIL makes <br/>
my niece eat.  It has never been an option of &quot;are you hungry&quot; or <br/>
&quot;do you want to eat now?&quot;  It&#39;s just a rule.  If my niece isn&#39;t hungry <br/>
and doesn&#39;t want to eat much (after all, she did just get home <br/>
and wants to spend some time with mommy), then she doesn&#39;t <br/>
get to eat anything else that night.  If my niece (who&#39;s name is <br/>
Linzie) wants something later in the evening, then my SIL will <br/>
either tell her no or force her to eat cold left over dinner.  Of <br/>
course, what 22 month old will eat cold dinner that&#39;s been sitting <br/>
out?  So, she dosen&#39;t eat it and then goes to bed hungry.  &quot;bed <br/>
time&quot; is another thing, my SIL forces Linzie to go to bed at 8 pm, <br/>
period.  If she doesn&#39;t want to (like when I&#39;m visiting and she&#39;s <br/>
excited to see me), then she just has to scream until she goes to <br/>
sleep.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m coming from a household (with my husband and 2 year old <br/>
daughter) where none of that happens so I just don&#39;t understand <br/>
it.  My daughter eats when she&#39;s hungry and stops when she&#39;s <br/>
full.  I will ask her what she wants to eat at around 6 or so but, if <br/>
she says nothing then I don&#39;t force her to eat.  Usually, once I get <br/>
myself something or my husband gets his dinner, then she will <br/>
have what we are having.  But, not always.  She will ALWAYS <br/>
come up and ask me for what she wants, when she&#39;s hungry.  <br/>
Which may be at 5 pm or may be at 8 pm.  As for bed time, she <br/>
goes to bed when she&#39;s tired.  Most times it&#39;s around 9 or so but <br/>
sometimes it&#39;s as early as 8 and as late as 11pm, it just <br/>
depends on if or when she napped that day.  I have never let her <br/>
cry herself to sleep because I would rather have some &quot;alone <br/>
time.&quot;  Sure, there have been times when I would love to have <br/>
some quiet time before going to bed and I wish she would just <br/>
go to sleep but......I have never put her in her bed/crib and let her <br/>
scream until she went to sleep.  My SIL won&#39;t even consider <br/>
getting Linzie a &quot;big girl&quot; bed because then she would be able to <br/>
climb out and get out of her room (she has told me this, in those <br/>
exact words).<br/>
<br/>
So....last night I had had enough (I may not be welcome there for <br/>
a while).  My SIL put dinner in front of Linzie (beans, weiners and <br/>
peas and carrots).  Linzie ate some of it but only a bite or two and <br/>
then started yelling &quot;bite, bite.&quot;  My SIL was ignoring her, as <br/>
usual, so I asked what she wanted.  My SIL said that Linzie <br/>
wanted tomatoes.  She had eated a couple (the small cherry <br/>
ones) already and wanted some more.  Ok.....so get her some <br/>
more, what&#39;s the problem?  I looked at my SIL and said &quot;so, why <br/>
don&#39;t you give her some more tomatoes, it&#39;s not like she&#39;s asking <br/>
for chips and dip for heaven&#39;s sake, it&#39;s TOMATOES!!&quot;   Her <br/>
response was because she&#39;s already eaten some and she <br/>
needs to eat everything else on her plate and then she can have <br/>
some more.  OMG!  If the poor child wants some damn tomatoes <br/>
and not peas and carrots, get her the damn tomatoes.  Of <br/>
course, then Linzie and my SIL get in a screaming match and <br/>
Linzie has to go to a time out.  All because she wanted to eat <br/>
extra tomatoes at dinner time.  It was really very sad, I think. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I left feeling frustrated and angry and so was Linzie.  To <br/>
top it all off, she had to go to bed hungry and screaming.  I <br/>
couldn&#39;t even stay after that.  I know that sometimes it feels like a <br/>
struggle to get kids to eat &quot;healthy&quot; but, it&#39;s tomates we&#39;re talking <br/>
about not cookies and ice cream.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is the way so many families opperate. It is sad.  I really feel for you <br/>
holding your tongue, sort of.  I have to do this with my SIL as well.  She is <br/>
a clean your plate person with one child and the otehr doesn&#39;t eat much at <br/>
all.  She is built like my son.  Tall and skinny.  My SIL sees it as she is not <br/>
eating enough so she pushes everything on this girl.  If she won&#39;t eat what is <br/>
out for supper than she she gets her to eat anything, candy, cookies etc.  She <br/>
keeps harping on the poor girl until she eats something.  I do hold my tongue <br/>
though.  I know people have their own parenting styles.  I offer my <br/>
suggestions if she asks.<br/>
