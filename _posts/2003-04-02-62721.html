<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172498105">We had a cat in the freezer...and we ate her.....<br/>
mountain lion, very lean.  Legally trophy hunted by a<br/>
local guide (friend of mine) for a rich Texan, who was<br/>
gonna kill her no matter what.  To put her stuffed<br/>
head on his wall. I didn&#39;t want to waste the meat and<br/>
hide and dishonor the animal so I butchered her, stuck<br/>
the meat in the freezer and tanned the hide for a<br/>
friend who made a bed throw, and made the tail into a<br/>
lovely collar and cuff set.<br/>
  Another friend of mine had her dead cat stuffed and<br/>
mounted and it is STILL her pet&lt;g&gt;, she collects<br/>
vintage taxidermy and skulls, my kids LOVE to visit<br/>
her house!  I know this response could be considered<br/>
&#39;catty&#39; but it&#39;s an example of the wide eating (and<br/>
thought) diversity even on this list.   You prolly do<br/>
NOT want to know what is in MY freezer (besides<br/>
cruelly slaughtered and hypothermic edamame)&lt;EVIL<br/>
GRIN&gt;!<br/>
