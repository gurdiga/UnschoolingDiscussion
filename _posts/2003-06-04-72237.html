<div id="ygrps-yiv-874185073">DENNIS: Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no<br/>
       basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power<br/>
       derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical<br/>
       aquatic ceremony. <br/>
ARTHUR:<br/>
       Be quiet!<br/>
DENNIS:<br/>
       Well, but you can&#39;t expect to wield supreme executive power<br/>
       just &#39;cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! <br/>
ARTHUR:<br/>
       Shut up!<br/>
DENNIS:<br/>
       I mean, if I went &#39;round saying I was an emperor just because<br/>
       some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they&#39;d put me<br/>
       away! <br/>
ARTHUR:<br/>
       Shut up, will you? Shut up!<br/>
DENNIS:<br/>
       Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system.<br/>
ARTHUR:<br/>
       Shut up!<br/>
DENNIS:<br/>
       Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help!<br/>
       Help! I&#39;m being repressed! <br/>
<br/>
I love the &quot;moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar&quot; bit!!<br/>
<br/>
HAHAHAHA!  :O))))<br/>

Eric Idle&#39;s funniest role in the movie..and yes, that&#39;s my favorite line, <br/>
too.  Well, and the violence inherant in the system bit.  &quot;I&#39;M BEING REPRESSED&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I was *crying* last nite, it was so funny.  <br/>
<br/>
We need DVD widescreen tho.  The Quest for the Holy Gr   just isn&#39;t the same. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And btw, for unschooling purposes....<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s physics, politics, and religion in that bad boy, and it sure makes <br/>
ripping modern life apart, I mean, learning, fun!  LMAO<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and of course, a bit of history, if you can call it that.   Trojan Rabbit <br/>
and all.  <br/>

I figure if kids have all the pictures and connections they can make from <br/>
things like Monty Python, Animaniacs, Liberty&#39;s Kids, Eddie Izzard, Bill & Ted, <br/>
Black Adder, ANYTHING, that when &quot;the real&quot; story comes along, they&#39;ll already <br/>
have some context, commentary and parody in them to see it in a more lively <br/>
and alive way.<br/>
