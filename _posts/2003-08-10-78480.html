<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915370285">We have had a great day today. We headed out to the bush to get some more<br/>
firewood. jWe found millipedes, geckos of all sizes, all sorts of fungus and<br/>
a lot of the wildflowers are starting to bloom so it was really pretty out<br/>
three. The boys chose to help us too which was great. So now it&#39;s raining<br/>
and we have lots of wood, just going to get a fire started now.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s such a good feeling to have the whole family working together<br/>
peacefully. Jacob kept bringing us drinks when we looked thirsty which was<br/>
really sweet. So much better when they do stuff without any prompting just<br/>
because they love you and they see you doing it for them.<br/>
