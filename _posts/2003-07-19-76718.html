<div id="ygrps-yiv-786367856">**Last week at my neighborhood pool, one of the ladies<br/>
asked why my 3.5 yr. old wasn&#39;t in pre-school.  I of course told her I was<br/>
going to home school and she responded in a loud voice saying - &quot;what, our<br/>
elementary school isn&#39;t good enough for you&quot; - wow!  the assumptions she<br/>
made with out knowing anything about me and my family.  Do these things<br/>
happen to everyone that home schools or do I just put myself in the wrong<br/>
social groups??**<br/>

Hi, Susan --<br/>
<br/>
Nice to meet you!  Lots of people get flak for choosing homeschooling. <br/>
Not everyone is as rude as that lady, though.  It&#39;s hard to know if her<br/>
snotty remark meant &quot;Our local school is great&quot; or, worse, &quot;Our school<br/>
is not so great, but that&#39;s plenty good enough for you.&quot;  (Yuck!)<br/>
<br/>
If she wanted to be clear and un-insulting she could have said &quot;I think<br/>
our local school is great.&quot;  What she said wasn&#39;t that nice.<br/>
