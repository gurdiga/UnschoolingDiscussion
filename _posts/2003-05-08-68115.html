<div id="ygrps-yiv-678697962">Yes, I heard about this incident on the news.  I didn&#39;t see dateline.<br/>
<br/>
Truly, how much is it going to take for parents to wake up and realize that compulsary schooling is what causes all of this?<br/>
<br/>
I am SO glad that both of my older kids have reconsidered the school idea for next year.  My son is having a ball with all his friends over here every day after school.  And my daughter is totally inspired by Heather at &quot;peas and carrots&quot; farm.<br/>

  Last night, did any of you watch Dateline and see those high school <br/>
  senior girls hazing the junior girls after a powder puff game?  Good <br/>
  grief!!!  I couldn&#39;t believe the violence these girls showed.   Our 4yo <br/>
  came into the room and asked why those girls were being so mean and <br/>
  where they were at.  I explained honestly as best I could and he looked <br/>
  at me with sad eyes and spoke with a cracking voice, &quot;I&#39;m going to tell <br/>
  everyone that they should homeschool their kids so they don&#39;t get hurt.&quot; <br/>
  Ugh, his sweetness just chokes me right up.<br/>

Compulsory schooling doesn&#39;t cause fraternity and sorority hazing.<br/>
<br/>
Hazing is self-perpetuating, like domestic abuse is.  If someone is comforted <br/>
in their anguish by the assurance that someday THEY will get to do that to <br/>
others, who will be in a position to say STOP, no more?  As long as there&#39;s <br/>
one sadistic, willing organizer, it doesn&#39;t stop.<br/>

<br/>
I think you&#39;re right that school didn&#39;t cause it, but it is the &quot;enabler&quot; for <br/>
lack of a better term.  Without the school social setting, the <br/>
self-perpetuating process may not hold up.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize this made the national news.  I&#39;ve been reading it in the <br/>
paper and then (unfortunately) saw it on the news last night - I don&#39;t <br/>
usually watch the news, but wasn&#39;t asleep yet.  The shock people are <br/>
expressing here is that it happened at a &#39;good&#39; school in a &#39;good <br/>
neighborhood,&#39; as if that somehow insulated them.  Even it its a &#39;good&#39; <br/>
school, it&#39;s still an institution.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what the answer it, but it is terrifying.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183763578">I watched the hazing this morning, couldn&#39;t believe it.<br/>
My daughter played in the powderpuff in high school<br/>
and I know this never went on.<br/>
There would have been a personal hell to pay if I ever<br/>
saw one of my kids doing what those senior girls did.<br/>
They are very lucky someone didn&#39;t get killed.<br/>
The news said this was off school property.<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine why someone didn&#39;t step in.<br/>
But they sure got it on film. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57535920">I just read/watched the article on the hs hazing.  It reminded me of <br/>
something I heard in church on Sunday.  A classmate of mine ( he&#39;s now 36) is <br/>
in the Navy. His mother announced that he was on his way home from the war.   <br/>
I overheard her telling a former Navy officer that Frank had crossed the <br/>
equator and went through some type of hazing/initiation thing.  He had been <br/>
&quot;promoted&quot; from a tadpole to a shellback.   She was very concerned, said that <br/>
Frank didn&#39;t give her the details, but evidently it was bad.  She was asking <br/>
the other Navy man about it, to tell her what it was, what happens.   He just <br/>
patted her hand and said, &quot;you dont want to know, some things are better left <br/>
unknown&quot;   I could tell that his mother was so worried and disturbed by <br/>
hearing this.   I felt so sorry for her, putting myself in her place if it <br/>
were one of my sons.  I know that military hazing is common, but its so <br/>
senseless.   <br/>
