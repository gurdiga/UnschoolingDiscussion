<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<time>19 Apr 2003, at  3:22pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017039161">FINALLY the sun has come out and it warmed up again.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had some interesting days here.   All the friends are invited here..open door invitation...and they have been here for a couple of days (except at night).<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we got movies (8 mile, Sweet Home Alabama, and Crossroads) and watched movies, and ate food...lots and lots of food.  It was a lot of fun.  I really enjoyed being with the kids.  I&#39;ve got another one calling me &quot;mom&quot; now. LOL.  (By the way 8 Mile is a very interesting movie.  It explains so much of Eminem&#39;s lyrics.)<br/>
<br/>
And then today, they washed the dishes for me (for a small fee, but I was GLAD to pay it with all those dishes!!!).  I really have to invest in paper cups and plates, etc. LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...I took them ALL to the skatepark.  We squeezed 8 kids in the suburban and left.  The kids were aged 7 to 16.<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t do any skating (too many older pros), but they sure had a great time.  They were rolling down the grassy hill, racing, doing gymnastics, and went exploring in the woods.  They were playing in a water pipe and the park ranger had to tell them to stop &lt;smirk&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home they were cranking up the music and waving at people on the highway LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Now they&#39;re outside hanging out, not sure what they&#39;re up to at the moment but I can still hear them. <br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow I&#39;m going to ask that they come over a little later in the day so that we can have family visit and not have a lot of ruckus goin&#39; on.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told the kids over and over again that I want them to hang out here where its safe.  They know I won&#39;t get in their hair.  And I&#39;m collaborating on how we can make this the kind of hang out they&#39;d like to come to...instead of wandering around town bored.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully they&#39;ll give me more ideas after this weekend.  Now, to find parts for a go-kart......<br/>

****************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>
