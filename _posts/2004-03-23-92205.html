<div id="ygrps-yiv-105764720">Thank you guys for the wonderful suggestions.  Pam, I&#39;m going to print yours<br/>
out so I can try some of these ideas as we go.  I&#39;m excited thinking about<br/>
it.  To answer Betsy - He has unschooled for the last (almost) 3 years and<br/>
is just in a slump or really it&#39;s more of a social growth spurt really that<br/>
our lives and schedules haven&#39;t caught up to.  Pam&#39;s post makes me think of<br/>
the problem differently.  I think I had it upside down.  He does crave more<br/>
social interaction but he&#39;s very choosy about what sort.  So I will try to<br/>
engage his friends in some activities they might all enjoy and let you know<br/>
what happens.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007960972">Hi Everyone, <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
When my girls were really little (say 3 and 5) they brought their dollies to<br/>
the library one day and one of them spanked the doll and told her she was<br/>
bad.  I almost died because back before I had children, if I had seen that<br/>
behavior, I would have assumed they were mimicking what they had learned at<br/>
home.  Well, they certainly didn&#39;t get that from me and I was horrified to<br/>
think that someone might think that.  Well, now I don&#39;t worry so much about<br/>
what other people think unless it is a friend and something the girls do<br/>
makes them feel uncomfortable.  That is the case concerning the following<br/>
behaviors that I would like some insight on.<br/>
 <br/>
 My sweet little girls (ages 7 and 9) have a bit of an off sense of humor.<br/>
(ok, a lot of an off sense of humor! LOL!)  For instance, when we first got<br/>
the Sims games, while playing, a Sim accidentally caught on fire while it<br/>
was cooking and it died.  They thought it was a riot that the grim reaper<br/>
came and from that point on they purposely caught their sims on fire.  (made<br/>
sure they had No cooking skill points so the fires would happen.)  They<br/>
thought it was a riot and anything like this just cracks them up.  Of<br/>
course, they shared this information with their friend who is 9 and she<br/>
thought it was hilarious too and she started doing the same thing.  I have<br/>
commented to the girls, as they burn their Sims, that &quot;that is just awful.&quot;<br/>
(image running through my head of children growing up lacking empathy for<br/>
others and other horrible thoughts.)  It does make me feel bad that they<br/>
think it&#39;s fun to torture their computer people but I figure that is my<br/>
issue so after several comments to the effect that I thought it was awful, I<br/>
stopped commenting on it and really let it go.  I know they like to get a<br/>
rise out of me and that is part of the fun of doing these things but I don&#39;t<br/>
think that is their driving force..they just truly think it is funny.<br/>
 <br/>
Along the same lines, they have these beanie babies that they love and play<br/>
with *every* day. (and have for three years)  But they think it is really<br/>
funny to do torturous things to them.  When I am brushing their hair, if I<br/>
snag a not, they punch Pellet (the beanie)  and laugh.  And when they are<br/>
playing with their friend they make their Pellets do things that are against<br/>
societies expectations (like steal or kill) and then they punch them or beat<br/>
them and tell them they are bad.  Both of the girls and their friend think<br/>
this is *so* funny.  It does make me squirm inside sometimes but I just bite<br/>
my tongue and find something else to do other than focus on it because they<br/>
are really sweet girls and I know they would never even cut in line, let<br/>
alone hurt someone.  <br/>
 <br/>
My friend has told me that she feels uncomfortable with this type of play.<br/>
She asked me to help her come to grips with it as she realizes the reason<br/>
she feels uncomfortable are her issues.  I really don&#39;t know what to tell<br/>
her since it really makes me uncomfortable too.  My kids have re-assured me<br/>
that they would never do that to someone in real life and that Pellet isn&#39;t<br/>
real and the Sims aren&#39;t real.  And they would never even do it to the<br/>
stuffed animals that they take comfort in and cuddle.  <br/>
 <br/>
My girls are generally seen by outsiders as quiet, shy girls.  They adore<br/>
animals and we have many pets. They are gentle with all animals and<br/>
children.   They do like getting a rise or a laugh out of  people they are<br/>
comfortable with and that is part of the reason they do what they do.  (Can<br/>
we shock Auntie? Or can we make Suzie laugh?)  I talk to my girls about<br/>
EVERYTHING and we don&#39;t have any hard fast rules at our house.  They do<br/>
respect what I say and if I sat them down and told them that it really made<br/>
my friend uncomfortable, I am sure they would try and stop doing it. (even<br/>
though they might not understand her concern)  BUT, they really have a lot<br/>
of fun doing these things and I hate to be a the poop in the punch bowl when<br/>
they are just having fun and it really isn&#39;t hurting anyone. At the same<br/>
time, I adore my friend and I want her to be comfortable hanging out with<br/>
us.  So, do you have any advice I can share with my friend to help her<br/>
through these feelings or do you feel that I should talk to the girls about<br/>
how it is making my friend uncomfortable? <br/>
