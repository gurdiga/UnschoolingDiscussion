 </span></blockquote>It was a loooong time ago.  Over 20 years.  When I went, Ft. Jackson had all <br/>
women companies, but I trained with men at Ft. Leonard Wood.  There&#39;s a <br/>
platoon of women in Jake&#39;s company, too, but I had heard that they stopped <br/>
doing that for a while.<br/>
<br/>
But Jake has been in ROTC and has rank already.  He&#39;s among 3 or 4 in the <br/>
whole company who have rank.  The way he&#39;s describing what&#39;s happening is so <br/>
very familiar to me.  Although, he is in OSUT, where he stays right there for <br/>
AIT and I wasn&#39;t.  I think, actually, that this is his last day of basic, and <br/>
they&#39;re starting his AIT next week.  So, he doesn&#39;t actually have graduation <br/>
from basic like I did, but he does have one for the whole shebang sometime in <br/>
the spring.  <br/>
<br/>
I get to pick him up next week for Christmas and I&#39;m so happy!  Can&#39;t wait to <br/>
see his shaved little head and see how much of the college boy beer belly he <br/>
burned off!<br/>
