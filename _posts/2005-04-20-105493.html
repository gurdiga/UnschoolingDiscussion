==================<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby had a plan, and Keith said no.<br/>
 <br/>
That was rare and stuck out!  Kirby understood and agreed. I argued in  <br/>
Kirby&#39;s defense (lamely, it seemed) and they both turned on me and said no, it  was <br/>
better.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
This was the deal:<br/>
Encouraged by two friends who have done it, Kirby wanted to deliver pizzas  <br/>
for the next few weeks until he can take a GED, get on at an adult job, and let <br/>
 the released high school kids deliver the pizzas.   Keith said if  Kirby <br/>
owned his own car that would be one thing but Keith didn&#39;t want any of our  cars <br/>
used for pizza delivery.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s all.  The big &#39;no.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Just thought I should share. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Also I had already told Kirby that we had a female friend who had been  <br/>
robbed several times delivering pizzas, but she was small and female and Kirby&#39;s  <br/>
full sized and karate trained, and pizzas aren&#39;t all that expensive and he  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have much money on him anyway.<br/>
 <br/>
Keith told worse pizza robbery stories, besides risk to cars and wear and  <br/>
tear.<br/>
