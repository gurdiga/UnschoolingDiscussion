That&#39;s not necessarily true.  &quot;At-risk&quot; for public pre-school is most often<br/>
determined solely by income level...and that level is actually pretty high.<br/>
Back in the early 60&#39;s I was a headstart kid.  My parents were both employed<br/>
(one as a state trooper and one as a secretary) with 3 kids and we<br/>
qualified.  Any as far as family lives not being enriched, we were the<br/>
Castro County Library Family of the Year....tada....complete with reception<br/>
and picture in the paper because we used their facilities so much.<br/>

All foster kids qualify, in fact, anyone receiving WIC (such as many, many<br/>
military families) or AFDC qualifies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490725124">My son could not get his children into headstart.  Even though he was a<br/>
single parent because he was not on AFDC he was not eligible.   Also his<br/>
children have never been allowed WIC because it is for WOMEN, infants and<br/>
children.  Single men with children get turned away.  In the state of<br/>
Washington while we were there, they allowed me to draw the WIC so Chaelene<br/>
could benefit.  She was on special formula and it was quite expensive.<br/>

that was a slip and not what I meant.<br/>
<br/>
The headstart programs I&#39;m familiar with (a number of them - they ask me to <br/>
talk to the parents about homeschooling at one of them, every year, as part <br/>
of their parent education stuff) seem to have a large number of parents who, <br/>
quite honestly, don&#39;t seem to have much on the ball in terms of parenting. <br/>
What I mean by that is that they are poor, but mostly are bottlefeeding <br/>
babies with formula. They are doing a lot of hand slapping and butt smacking <br/>
when the kids get even a smidgen rambunctious. They OBVIOUSLY want to be good <br/>
parents and love their kids - but many appear pretty ignorant about a lot of <br/>
things most of us would probably take for granted as being good parenting. <br/>
They mostly always seem surprised at the very idea of reading to very young <br/>
children, for example. <br/>
