<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396503736">Hi Jenny<br/>
<br/>
From what you&#39;ve described, it sounds like they&#39;re grazing, which is good. <br/>
If they aren&#39;t sitting down to a stack of pancakes and two scrambled eggs, <br/>
and a glass of juice, at breakfast time, then their tummies probably do feel <br/>
hungry, and so they nibble through the day. Overeating means eating past the <br/>
point of feeling full. I&#39;d observe them without comment. Just watch. Are <br/>
they really eating to excess? Don&#39;t fret about it. No comments. Just <br/>
observe. And make sure their days have other interesting things in them. <br/>
Sandbox play, walking the dogs, coloring, park time. Children&#39;s museum? You <br/>
know, provide lots of variety of activities, so they aren&#39;t always hanging <br/>
out in the house. That&#39;s MY big downfall in the eating arena. Hang out at <br/>
home, get bored, open the fridge. bleh. Not good.<br/>
<br/>
Our two mid-kids eat when and what they want, mostly. We like having a <br/>
family Dinner At the Table once in awhile, and I&#39;ll ask them on those days <br/>
not to snack after such and such a time, because we&#39;re having a sit down <br/>
dinner. Also, they know if they eat it all, and the food budget is <br/>
stretched, they&#39;ll have to wait for their favorites until the next paycheck. <br/>
They&#39;re bigger, though. 12 and 10. Capable of consuming a gallon of milk in <br/>
an afternoon. ;) Maybe if they&#39;d always had this food freedom, they&#39;d be <br/>
less likely to munch it all down, as mid-kids. who knows?<br/>
<br/>
Oh. The sugar thing. My 12 yob has had cavities at every dentist visit. He <br/>
brushes every night (we recently got him an electric toothbrush at the <br/>
dentist&#39;s recommendation)...anyway, the dentist told me, it&#39;s the sweets he <br/>
eats. If he&#39;s going to eat sugary stuff, then brushing very thoroughly, and <br/>
frequently, is in order. So, the Froot Loops? Just make sure they brush, is <br/>
my advice. Or give them water to drink through the day. That&#39;ll rinse the <br/>
teeth. I&#39;m all for kids making choices, but when I have to foot the bill for <br/>
the dental caries...then I get to tell them what to do. LOL<br/>

&gt;Subject: Intro and food concerns<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello, my name is Jenny and this is my first post to this group. I<br/>
&gt;have two girls, ages four and two, and have been reading about<br/>
&gt;unschooling for about three years now. A couple of you may know me<br/>
&gt;from one of the Christian lists.<br/>
&gt;Anyway! I&#39;m wondering if, in my quest for them making choices, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;being too passive. The concerns I have are mostly with my four year<br/>
&gt;old, although my two year does similar things to a lesser extent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;She/they seem to want to eat all day long! For the four year old,<br/>
&gt;breakfast might be two bowls of oatmeal, or maybe something like<br/>
&gt;rice chex, and/or a couple eggs. They both often help themselves<br/>
&gt;to &quot;stick cheese&quot; sometimes several times a day. They also both like<br/>
&gt;to have &quot;snack bowls&quot; of dry cereal throughout the day, usually<br/>
&gt;Froot Loops or maybe Chex or Cheerios.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My oldest does not like fruit much; she might eat some once or twice<br/>
&gt;a week. If I serve peas, corn, or potatoes at dinner, she&#39;ll usually<br/>
&gt;have some.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess now that I&#39;m typing it doesn&#39;t sound too bad. My main<br/>
&gt;concerns are that they are just eating too much or having &quot;bad<br/>
&gt;habits.&quot; They like to eat snack bowls while they watch TV or when I<br/>
&gt;read to them, or even during short car rides, isn&#39;t that something<br/>
&gt;pediatricians say not to allow? They eat *several* times a day;<br/>
&gt;maybe like eight, but I couldn&#39;t even know. It seems like all day I<br/>
&gt;hear &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; or &quot;I want a snack&quot; or see them reaching for more<br/>
&gt;cheese. I&#39;m just afraid that kind of Eating Continually will lead to<br/>
&gt;overeating.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My other concern is them eating things like Froot Loops and candy.<br/>
&gt;The obvious answer would be, Don&#39;t buy those things ... but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;want any one food, really, to be &quot;forbidden&quot; or something &quot;we don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;keep in our house,&quot; so when they&#39;re in the store with me and ask for<br/>
&gt;those chewy, sugary fruit snacks, or whatever, I let them get it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve talked with my four year old about things like listening to<br/>
&gt;your tummy, when it says it&#39;s empty or filled up. We&#39;ve also talked<br/>
&gt;about eating a variety of different foods, which I guess she does to<br/>
&gt;some extent. I have noticed that she *will* announce, &quot;I&#39;m done&quot;<br/>
&gt;herself and leave even things like ice cream or cake and walk away<br/>
&gt;from them. On one hand, I&#39;m glad *she* is the one making that<br/>
&gt;decision, instead of me telling her when she&#39;s had enough. But I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;wondering if she&#39;s eating too much before she stops.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So I can&#39;t tell, even as I&#39;m writing this, if I&#39;m &quot;worrying about<br/>
&gt;nothing&quot; or if I need to guide her a little more in her choices, or<br/>
&gt;something else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
&gt;Jenny </span></blockquote></div>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, there are so many things that go into dental caries that <br/>
it isn&#39;t simply eat sweets/brush teeth. There is a viral aspect to <br/>
it. There&#39;s heredity. There&#39;s what you eat and when. There&#39;s <br/>
brushing/flossing. There&#39;s individual variations in mouth chemistry <br/>
(pH). There&#39;s things like allergies/nasal congestion/post nasal drip <br/>
that lead to open-mouth breathing and bacteria in the mouth/throat. <br/>
Lots of stuff. To make it &quot;brush after sweets&quot; is to oversimplify. <br/>
Eating aged cheeses like cheddar is said to be good if you can&#39;t get <br/>
to a toothbrush because it changes the pH in the mouth. Eating <br/>
raisins is worse than eating a Hershey bar - the sticky sugars and <br/>
sugars that stay in the mouth (regular chewing gum, lifesavers, soda <br/>
pop, etc) are more of a problem than a pack of chocolate candies.</div>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And then there&#39;s all the &quot;What we Just Don&#39;t Know Yet&quot; aspect.<br/>
I&#39;ve never known a dentist yet who was interested in the future of the  <br/>
profession, or in cutting edge research.  They just do what they learned in  dental <br/>
school ten or thirty or forty years ago.   And they tell those  simplified <br/>
lies like if you brush your teeth you won&#39;t have cavities.<br/>
 <br/>
I was getting an infection  around a tooth once, and asked the  assistant <br/>
what I could do dietarily to help, like what foods or vitamins might  be good.  <br/>
She looked at me that still look, with hard blinks, like people  do when you&#39;ve <br/>
just said something that *might * be important but that they  never expected <br/>
to hear in a million years and had never once EVER connected with  the subject <br/>
at hand.  Then she came back to herself, thought (the faraway  <br/>
into-the-mists-of-time look) and said something about vitamin C, and maybe E,  and trailed <br/>
off.  But it shook her a bit to think to maybe possibly  recommend diet and <br/>
other health factors about something like...   in*fec*tion.............<br/>
 <br/>
Her best recommendation before that had been to tie a knot in the dental  <br/>
floss and really make the gums bleed there.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve had infections on the outside of me before, and nobody&#39;s said &quot;really  <br/>
make it bleed there.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Because I try to be as honest with my kids as I can be, I&#39;ve avoided pat  <br/>
answers to &quot;Why?&quot; and the most I&#39;ll say is &quot;A lot of dentists say...&quot;  and  never <br/>
&quot;this *IS* caused by that,&quot; because much medical this-to-that is found  false <br/>
twice in a lifetime anymore.  They&#39;ll change their minds again before  my <br/>
kids are parents about what they just changed their minds about recently, so  I <br/>
don&#39;t press or swear to anything.  I say &quot;Might,&quot; &quot;seems&quot; and &quot;they  say.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Garlic?  Salt water or listerine?  (Ow!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been wondering why if cavities are caused by bacteria dentists don&#39;t prescribe antibiotics?  (But I haven&#39;t wondered hard enough to ask either my dentist or &quot;Jeeves&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
Being told &quot;the right answers&quot; in school sure seems to limit future thought.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I see that you are laughing, but this idea is one step away from a bunch of<br/>
really horrible parenting ideas:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;while you are under my roof, you&#39;ll do as I say/follow my rules&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I paid for that class, so you have to finish the whole course&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I paid for the computer/game system/tv/videos so I can take them away&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Food costs money, clean your plate&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Etc.<br/>
<br/>
Did any of us think bringing up children would be financially unimposing?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes kids with the best dental hygiene in the world still need<br/>
orthodontics. <br/>
Sometimes kids accidentally get hit in the teeth with a baseball.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I pay for your clothes. I&#39;ll choose what you may wear.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s right up there with having an expectation of gratitude as being &quot;owed&quot;<br/>
obedience. <br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of the scene in &quot;Guess Who&#39;s Coming to Dinner&quot; when Sidney<br/>
Poitier&#39;s character says to his father, &quot;You did what you were *supposed* to<br/>
do&quot;.<br/>
