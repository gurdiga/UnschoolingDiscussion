<div id="ygrps-yiv-868022934">Hi, folks.<br><br>This topic is so hot and crazy in the media right now, mainstream media and social media. So please know I&#39;m not coming here to troll or stir the pot. I&#39;d like to ask about vaccinating from an unschooling perspective as it pertains to older children. <br><br>My 9 year old is not fully vaccinated, and he&#39;s really resistant to the idea of getting shots. I&#39;m struggling with this because I myself have mixed feelings about it. I find myself at a loss as to how to reconciling the consensus of epidemiologists with the reality of rare but serious vaccine injuries, as well as the need to make choices for the benefit of the whole of society with the right of people to make individual choices for their own health and well being. Again, from an unschooling perspective, I want to be his ally and advocate, and a good mom and good citizen, too. <br><br>How do you all handle this? <br><br>Thanks for thoughts,<br><br>Teresa<br><br><br><br><br><p><span><br class="ygrps-yiv-868022934yui-cursor"></span></p></div>

 </span></blockquote>Setting aside the controversial issues about vaccines, some of these diseases can affect adults more seriously than when caught as a child.<br/>
<br/>
But, in the meantime, what are the chances your son will get one of these disease before he&#39;s an adult? Virtually nil. <br/>
<br/>
So since most people are vaccinated, you do have the luxury of letting him decide to get vaccinated or not. If he doesn&#39;t vaccinate before he&#39;s an adult, make information available for him so he can make an informed decision then. He&#39;ll need to know what vaccinations he&#39;s had and that immunity can fade. And about the diseases he could also be vaccinated for and what the effects might be if the diseases are caught as an adult.<br/>

I approach this topic as a concerned mother and unschooler who happens to have a scientific background.</div><div><br></div><div>Here is my take on medicine from an unschooling perspective: I would not want to force a medication or procedure on a child (or adult, really) unless there is danger to himself or others AND the child is unable to comprehend the situation AND creative thinking leaves no other alternatives. I cannot say here what the right answer is in this or any other individual situation.</div><div><br></div><div>As Joyce said, you can make information available to your son. Most people will agree that it is important to be informed. But when it comes to vaccines, if you look for information by doing a google search, there is a good chance you and your son will be misinformed. The internet and even some books are filled with folklore, half-truths, and flat out lies about vaccines. There are even whole websites and organizations designed to look official and scientific, but are actually all smoke and mirrors. But it’s hard to tell unless you have a solid understanding of epidemiology and immunology, and you click on all the links and references on these sites.</div><div><br></div><div>In the United States, go straight to the CDC website&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/parents-guide/parents-guide-part4.html">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/parents-guide/parents-guide-part4.html</a>. No organization (including the CDC) is perfect, but it’s the best source of actual data here. Discuss anything you don’t understand or any frightening rumors you hear with a trusted physician or other expert in the field.</div><div><br></div><div>I am not saying this to you specifically, but to everyone as a source for discussion. I think you move away from unschooling when you hold onto beliefs that are not supported by evidence, then impose these beliefs on your children as truths. Don’t believe whatever you read on the internet without checking sources. Don&#39;t believe that you are “educated” on a topic by reading a blog post while ignoring a large body of evidence. Experts can be wrong, but if you are going to say so, please be able to give real evidence as to why you think they are wrong.</div><div><br></div><div>I think if anyone really wants to learn about vaccines, study immunology, virology, epidemiology, anatomy and physiology, public health, etc. If not, see the CDC website and talk to people who are experts in these subjects. Don’t rely on internet lore.</div><div><br></div><div>Janice</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br><div><div>On Feb 13, 2015, at 5:28 AM, Joyce Fetteroll <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jfetteroll@...">jfetteroll@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="ygrps-yiv-1048835821Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1048835821ygrp-mlmsg" style="font-size:13px;font-family:Arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1048835821ygrp-msg" style="line-height:1.22em;"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1048835821ygrp-text" style="line-height:1.22em;font-family:Georgia;"><p style="line-height:1.22em;margin:0px 0px 1em;"><br style="line-height:1.22em;">&gt; On Feb 12, 2015, at 10:23 PM,<span class="ygrps-yiv-1048835821Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:treesock@..." style="line-height:1.22em;font-family:Verdana;">treesock@...</a><span class="ygrps-yiv-1048835821Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>wrote:<br style="line-height:1.22em;">&gt;<span class="ygrps-yiv-1048835821Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br style="line-height:1.22em;">&gt; I want to be his ally and advocate, and a good mom and good citizen, too.<br style="line-height:1.22em;"><br style="line-height:1.22em;">Setting aside the controversial issues about vaccines, some of these diseases can affect adults more seriously than when caught as a child.<br style="line-height:1.22em;"><br style="line-height:1.22em;">But, in the meantime, what are the chances your son will get one of these disease before he&#39;s an adult?

<div id="ygrps-yiv-376027313">=<span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);line-height:18.0555553436279px;">My 9 year old is not fully vaccinated, and he&#39;s really resistant to the idea of getting shots.&nbsp;=<br><br>When Austin was 12 he was scared to get the shot, but interested in getting the vaccines recommended by our doctor. We went from there and found a way to make the shot less scary. Numbing the area with ice worked for him. I made him an ice pack wrapped in a towel and he held it on his arm on the way to the appointment and while we waited. He held my hand, looked away when it was time and was surprised when it was over that he hadn&#39;t felt pain.&nbsp;<br><br>On a side note: Austin needs to get his blood drawn often and I am surprised when I see little kids waiting to get their blood drawn with no numbing of the area done. Ice is great for shots because it can numb down into the muscle where vaccines usually go. Lidocaine cream is great for blood draws as it completely numbs the area. It doesn&#39;t go far enough down to numb for a subcutaneous shot, but for blood draws it works wonderfully.&nbsp;<br><br>Heather</span></div>

People in the medical field have mainstream views of children, so vaccinations are often given without any sensitivity towards the children. Parents are often instructed to hold their children down despite screams. Some parents trick and lie to their children about what will happen in the doctor’s office. Some parents have no empathy for their kids who have just experienced pain. No wonder some parents notice a change in their kids’ behavior after the vaccine, then they blame it on vaccine ingredients instead of looking at how they just treated their child. Thankfully, as unschoolers, we have the compassion and tools to help our children so that it does not have to be a traumatic experience for them. I’d love for the research dollars to go into how to make the whole experience less traumatic for families.</div><div><br></div><div>Janice</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br><div><div>On Feb 16, 2015, at 7:16 AM, Joyce Fetteroll <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jfetteroll@...">jfetteroll@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="ygrps-yiv-725189583Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite"><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div id="ygrps-yiv-725189583ygrp-mlmsg" style="font-size:13px;font-family:Arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;"><div id="ygrps-yiv-725189583ygrp-msg" style="line-height:1.22em;"><div id="ygrps-yiv-725189583ygrp-text" style="line-height:1.22em;font-family:Georgia;"><p style="line-height:1.22em;margin:0px 0px 1em;"><br style="line-height:1.22em;">&gt; On Feb 13, 2015, at 12:44 PM, Janice Ancheta<span class="ygrps-yiv-725189583Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:janice_casamina@..." style="line-height:1.22em;font-family:Verdana;">janice_casamina@...</a><span class="ygrps-yiv-725189583Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>wrote:<br style="line-height:1.22em;">&gt;<span class="ygrps-yiv-725189583Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br style="line-height:1.22em;">&gt; As Joyce said, you can make information available to your son.<br style="line-height:1.22em;"><br style="line-height:1.22em;">Just to be clear, I was picturing a young adult ready to go off into the world needing information.

 </span></blockquote>True. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Much of what doctors believe comes from pharmaceutical reps or reports from pharmaceutical research. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sort of. The internet lore states that doctors believe what pharmaceutical companies and research say. I can’t speak for all doctors, but my classmates and I were trained NOT to believe anything in any one research paper. We are trained to critically examine any paper that comes our way. We know to look at who funded the research. We examine papers for bias and errors. I habitually tear apart research articles. That’s part of how I found unschooling - by tearing apart all of those research articles that try to show the harms of television. Most of us don’t trust pharmaceutical companies any more than we trust the business people and politicians who run our health care system (at least where I live in the U.S.). I am personally very skeptical of those pharmaceutical representatives and any research only performed by people who stand to make money from that research.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Knowing, as we all do, that some things are unknowable<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. Nothing in life is 100%, (except dying and taxes, as the saying goes). There are people who believe that the Earth does not revolve around the Sun. All of that footage of us going to the moon could have been fabricated. There are people who believe that Ebola was invented by Westerners to bring suffering to Africa. There are people who believe that AIDS is caused by the antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV. Can any of us say with 100% certainty whether any of these things are true? Should we believe these statements because we can’t prove the opposite?<br/>
<br/>
I agree this not the place to discuss a super hot topic like vaccines in detail. I respect you, Sandra, for keeping this list on point.<br/>
<br/>
Would it be more helpful to discuss how unschooling parents can model sifting through the large amounts of information and misinformation out there? How can we tell if the “research” supporting such-and-such new diet or miracle pill is actually research or just advertising? Many decisions in life require a risk/benefit analysis. How can we parents model this? Should we avoid walking down the street or traveling by car because of the possibility of getting hurt? Most of us don’t think twice about walking or driving. But some of us avoid things because of possibilities that are much tinier than the possibility of getting hurt by walking or driving. When our children ask us questions, how do we know if we’re answering with heavy personal bias, and how can we become more objective? Do we want to be more objective?<br/>

You&#39;re implying that I based my statement on &quot;internet lore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have known pharmaceutical reps, researchers and doctors,  for a long time.  I was the president of a corporation (non-profit, but still, came to read literature and lawsuits that involved the laws that require board members to look to finances and the maintenance of the company above all, or be guilty of a crime).<br/>
<br/>
What medical students are told to do, and the papers they read as students, can go by the wayside once they&#39;re fully licensed.  They&#39;re not required to study, in all cases, or to learn more.  They can slide in various ways.<br/>
<br/>
Doctors aren&#39;t known to be the most objective people.  They have a lot of time and money invested, and there is pressure from associations of various kinds.  <br/>
<br/>
Doctors are also taught to disregard patients&#39; reports (or at least assume that they could be lying) and so most accounts of problems after vaccinations are dismissed one way or another, directly or indirectly, and NOT collected and taken seriously.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry, I shouldn’t have assumed that you (and others) base statements like these on internet lore. I understand there are many ways people can come up with the impression that doctors’ beliefs come from pharmaceutical companies. But no one can really say this is true without being in the doctor’s head. Maybe I have issue with the phrase “comes from.” I would agree if the phrase were replaced with “can be influenced by.”<br/>
<br/>
I often hear big generalizations about doctors that don’t jive with my experience in training and in practice. People in other fields probably experience this also. It’s kind of like how some unschoolers might feel when outsiders say that unschoolers are permissive and un-parenting because of the examples they’ve seen. Or when people make comments about Sandra and unschoolers in general after reading snippets of what she said. Seeing how outside generalizations can be so inaccurate, I am now going to be careful about making sweeping generalized statements about another group of people, when I am not part of that group of people.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was trying to steer away from the vaccine issue, speaking in more general terms. I was actually thinking of other issues that are more related to unschooling - diets, not letting kids play in the front yard or climb trees, stuff like that, where parents tell children to avoid things because of high perceived risk. I think I am bringing in too many different ideas here at once, which is causing confusion. As I got to thinking about the original poster’s questions, I thought of so many other questions and could have been more precise.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yeah, that&#39;s antagonistic. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I apologize. I don’t mean to be antagonistic. I just realize that there are different ways of thinking, and I wanted to hear other people’s perspectives. I will try to remember to not use the word “we” like this in the future. I have made the assumption in the past that striving for objectivity would help with unschooling. When I wrote this, I was thinking that maybe I’ve been hammered with the importance of objectivity so much that I am unable to see other points of view. This list is great at pointing out when there is another point of view to be seen.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Much of what doctors believe comes from pharmaceutical reps or reports from pharmaceutical research. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sort of. The internet lore states that doctors believe what pharmaceutical companies and research say. I can’t speak for all doctors, but my classmates and I were trained NOT to believe anything in any one research paper. We are trained to critically examine any paper that comes our way.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You&#39;re implying that I based my statement on &quot;internet lore.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have known pharmaceutical reps, researchers and doctors,  for a long time.  I was the president of a corporation (non-profit, but still, came to read literature and lawsuits that involved the laws that require board members to look to finances and the maintenance of the company above all, or be guilty of a crime).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What medical students are told to do, and the papers they read as students, can go by the wayside once they&#39;re fully licensed.  They&#39;re not required to study, in all cases, or to learn more.  They can slide in various ways.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Doctors aren&#39;t known to be the most objective people.  They have a lot of time and money invested, and there is pressure from associations of various kinds.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Doctors are also taught to disregard patients&#39; reports (or at least assume that they could be lying) and so most accounts of problems after vaccinations are dismissed one way or another, directly or indirectly, and NOT collected and taken seriously.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-Would it be more helpful to discuss how unschooling parents can model sifting through the large amounts of information and misinformation out there? How can we tell if the “research” supporting such-and-such new diet or miracle pill is actually research or just advertising? -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When a parent learns, I hope she&#39;s not learning in order to &quot;model&quot; learning, but is actually learning, directly.<br/>

I have good friends and family members who are very vocal against vaccination (and some who are very vocal for vaccination). We (adults) are able to have respectful discussions that lead to mutual understanding even when we disagree. Our kids play together, and vaccines have not come up yet for them. Is it possible to have a gentle discussion with your family member who has mistakenly made a flippant comment in front of your child?</div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, I have seen (mostly online) that vaccine discussions can take a downward spiral into nonsensical or mean accusations quickly. Vaccinating parents are called “sheeple.” Non-vaccinating parents are called “stupid” or “selfish.” Doctors and scientists are called “greedy” or “pawns of Big Pharma.” These types of statements are unhelpful. If people become hostile and unyielding, I am learning that it’s better to just not engage. Just walk away. Enjoy time with my kids instead. Don’t let that negativity into my home. You might choose to do the same if this is the case with your relatives.</div><div><br></div><div>Respectfully,</div><div>Janice</div><div><br></div><br><div><div>On Feb 16, 2015, at 7:47 PM, Sandra Dodd <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Sandra@...">Sandra@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="ygrps-yiv-388036638Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite">-=-I have made the assumption in the past that striving for objectivity would help with unschooling.

<p dir="ltr">I can imagine a child being moved by that argument, but I have trouble picturing a child hearing that, &quot;deciding,&quot; and getting on a bike to hit the Walgreens. What I picture in that scenario is a child approaching the parent, wanting to know if it&#39;s true, feeling afraid or self-righteous, and I would use that as an opportunity to discuss the issues involved in that idea. Why would someone say that? What are the concerns underneath that? </p>
<p dir="ltr">This is an area where are kids are likely to start out biased towards our view as the parent. Whenever my nine yo asserts something that is the product of *my* reasoning, rather than his, I try to offer some of the other perspectives.</p>
