 </span></blockquote>Hello.  Welcome to the wonderful world of unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, technically, I&#39;m not sure we are unschoolers every day.  Some days we <br/>
are pretty structured, some days not.  We use texts, CDs, library books (a <br/>
lot), Internet, and the great outdoors.  We live in Florida and my kids are <br/>
almost-7 and almost 5 1/2 yo.  So the outdoors is big.  <br/>
<br/>
Whatever you call yourself,  I think you were right when you said you have to <br/>
grasp it yourself and figure it out -- figure our what works for you and <br/>
yours.  <br/>
<br/>
There are various on-line lists that have the laws for each state.  NHEN has <br/>
one, HSLDA has one, and there are others.  Our local school board gave us a <br/>
copy and other helpful info.  And there are local hsing support groups that <br/>
are good for this sort of info as well as field trips, etc., if they are your <br/>
cup of tea. (Yet another decision you get to make!)<br/>
<br/>
How old are your kids?  <br/>

&lt;&lt; No matter how much I read on different types of homeschooling, I <br/>
 suppose I&#39;ll just have to grasp it myself to fully understand it, and <br/>
 what my obligations and regulations are....I have to keep records and <br/>
 such?  Anyone that can help, please feel free....although I must warn <br/>
 you, I may drive you crazy until I understand what I am doing  =)<br/>
 <br/>
 Thanks!<br/>

I do not know what your requirements are in Ark., in regards to having to <br/>
keep reports, and a portfolio of what you are doing, etc....  Reading all you <br/>
can get your hands on is a great idea; the more you read, the better it will <br/>
be.  Since you &quot;sound&quot; like you may want to include a bit of structure with <br/>
the Biblical aspect, know that this can occur with unschooling, too.  Some <br/>
people (including myself) consider themselves &quot;Christian Unschoolers&quot;, and <br/>
/or Eclectic Homeschoolers, where you do not necessarily use a pre-pkg <br/>
curriculum, but opt instead to use a &quot;bit of this and that&quot;, inconjunction <br/>
with what topics your children are learning about .  Unschoolers often use <br/>
textbooks, but use them when relevant to the learning already under way, <br/>
instead of using them to initiate the learning, as schools do.  There is no <br/>
one best way to home educate; you will just need to tryout what seems <br/>
comfortable for you and your kids, and adjust as needed,  and there may be <br/>
lots of fine tuning as you go along.  Many people on this list have a lot of <br/>
experience and will be able to give you some good advice!  I found a lot of <br/>
great info just by surfing the web and reading articles-- there are many, <br/>
many ,many!  Congratulations on your decision to homeschool!                    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618505797">Hi Nance,<br/>
<br/>
I have 4 kids, 2 boys, ages 9 and 11, and 2 girls ages 4 and 5.  I have<br/>
decided to homeschool for several reasons.  My oldest son is extremely<br/>
smart, and miserably bored working on his level....I have tried since he was<br/>
in the 2nd grade to get teachers to cooperate with me on moving him up into<br/>
higher levels to challenge him (all to no avail).  My oldest daughter should<br/>
start kindergarten this year, but I do not believe her to be socially ready<br/>
to interact with other kids.....she has a temper, and doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
understand the basic concepts of behavior control   =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.  I will be sure to check out some of your resources.<br/>
Please let me know if you think of anything or run across anything that may<br/>
benefit me  =)<br/>
<br/>
