<div id="ygrps-yiv-357170885">In light of the discussion of sharing your kid&#39;s interests, I had to share <br/>
what happened in our house today.<br/>
<br/>
Lanora, 12, regularly surfs the web and chats online.  I don&#39;t monitor her or <br/>
even ask her to keep me informed on what she is doing.  She eagerly talks <br/>
with me about what she encounters and has even survived opening a web site <br/>
featuring pics of &quot;naked women&quot;.  She closed it and told the person who sent <br/>
the link that they are &quot;gross&quot;.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Her friend&#39;s mom (who is MY friend) learned that I don&#39;t stop her from going <br/>
into chat rooms and almost fainted.  She covered it by stating that Lanora <br/>
and I have a different relationship than she and Sarah.  She completely <br/>
misses the foundation for the difference.<br/>
<br/>
She sees Sarah&#39;s interests as &quot;her thing&quot; and something she doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
be bothered with.  Sarah has learned to keep it to herself along with almost <br/>
every emotion and struggle she has.  She tells me MUCH more than she will <br/>
tell her mom.<br/>
<br/>
Lanora shares with me freely because it&#39;s natural, her interests have always <br/>
been important to me.  My friend doesn&#39;t see, probably doesn&#39;t want to see, <br/>
that an interest on her part would mean openess between she and Sarah now.<br/>
