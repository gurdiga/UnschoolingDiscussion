 </span></blockquote>Looking back, I realize that nobody in my family ever DARED to question our <br/>
unschooling because I was always so boiling over with excitement and <br/>
enthusiasm for what the kids were doing.<br/>
<br/>
I took every question, like the one above, as a chance to brag up whatever <br/>
the kids were into at the time. I didn&#39;t take it as an academic question, <br/>
necessarily, but as just a way for a caring relative to ask me to open a <br/>
window into their beloved grandchild or niece&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
It helps to be nondefensive -- I really WAS so genuinely thrilled and <br/>
facinated by the learning that my little ones were doing that I didn&#39;t have <br/>
to fake it. That&#39;s where having really thought a lot about learning and what <br/>
is important and isn&#39;t and child development and what leads to what -- etc. <br/>
-- comes in handy.<br/>
<br/>
 What I mean is that when my 4 yo spent the day and night and days and nights <br/>
playing with stuffed animals --- that looked like &quot;real&quot; and important <br/>
learning to me and I translated it as that to questioning relatives. &quot;Rosie <br/>
has been spending just hours and hours and hours in dramatic play -- she&#39;s <br/>
really developing her ability to create dialog and develop characters and <br/>
learning all about plot lines.&quot; &lt;BEG&gt;  You know - I never really said that, <br/>
exactly, but I KNEW that was what she was doing - along with a b&#39;zillion <br/>
other &quot;developments&quot; such as practicing conflict resolution skills (by acting <br/>
out with the stuffed animals) and trying on adult situations and roles and <br/>
all kinds of other things.<br/>
<br/>
 I never ever thought of what the kids were doing when they were little as <br/>
&quot;just&quot; playing -- even if all they were doing was sticking their fingers into <br/>
a hole in the couch/sofa/davenport and feeling the stuffing, I saw that as an <br/>
exploration of the tactile properties of upholstery materials. I might notice <br/>
that the same kid who was doing that also liked to run her hands across the <br/>
wall as she walked through a room. I guess I might say to Grandma, &quot;She&#39;s <br/>
really interested right now in how things feel - in their tactile qualities.&quot; <br/>
(I have a friend who is an architect and she says that she touched everything <br/>
- was always interested in how things felt - and that she had a professor in <br/>
her university in Naples, Italy, who said that he was the same way - that his <br/>
parents despaired because he always had dirty hands and was always touching <br/>
everything. So - there. Who the heck knows what something might lead to?)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You may be interested in a list that discusses homeschooling and <br/>
education-related politics - sounds like you are. I&#39;d like to suggest the <br/>
NHEN legislative list for that purpose. <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:NHEN-legislative-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">NHEN-legislative-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>)<br/>
<br/>
I believe that it is accurate to say that this list is not really just a list <br/>
for unschoolers to talk and debate about absolutely anything -- it is a list <br/>
that is actually ABOUT unschooling. Although, yes, our kids can learn from <br/>
anything and everything, this list isn&#39;t about anything and everything - it <br/>
isn&#39;t about abortion  or immigration policies or tax reform or immunizations <br/>
or lots of other things that could EASILY swamp the list and ruin it for any <br/>
good discussion and learning about unschooling. Maybe there is a place for <br/>
such a list -- a list where unschoolers go to talk about anything and <br/>
everything and political debates would be appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
 Some people aren&#39;t actually all that interested in talking about and <br/>
learning about and getting support for unschooling their kids  --- but they <br/>
have other agendas that they&#39;d like to convince us of. This really isn&#39;t the <br/>
place for that. The list is SO big and so active - it is very tempting for <br/>
people to take us as a captive audience and draw us into political <br/>
discussions. And there are people who don&#39;t mind and would enjoy those <br/>
discussions. But that really isn&#39;t fair to the rest of us who just want to be <br/>
on a list to talk about unschooling our kids. <br/>
<br/>
 I love discussion lists and have been on this list from its very early <br/>
beginnings, but I can&#39;t keep up here and a big reason for that is all the <br/>
controversial and hostile debate stuff that is really not relevant. I do like <br/>
the NHEN legislative list -- on that list there is an attempt to shed light - <br/>
even when hostilities do flare up (and they do) -- there are lots of <br/>
interested people there and they go out and investigate the topics and they <br/>
really help each other get to the truth, as much as possible. We aren&#39;t here <br/>
to do that - not when it comes to government school financing or other <br/>
political or off-topic discussions. It means that on this list, where the <br/>
vast majority of us are here to talk about unschooling, a few people post <br/>
their political opinions, a few people are drawn into debating them, hardly <br/>
anybody has any evidence or in-depth information to rebutt what anybody else <br/>
proclaims, and most people are just either yawning and signing off the list <br/>
or wading through the stuff while frustratedly trying to get other topics <br/>
going.<br/>
<br/>
I do my political discussions on a list that was created for that purpose and <br/>
where all the other people on the list are there for that purpose. But I <br/>
refuse to do it here because I know, for a fact, that there are people who <br/>
comehere who are REALLY wanting to learn about unschooling (sometimes <br/>
DESPERATELY wanting to learn about it or get support for it or figure out if <br/>
it might rescue their child in some way) and wading through all the other <br/>
stuff (including the extreme heat and hostility that politics always <br/>
generates) makes it really hard for them to get what they need from this <br/>
list.<br/>

<br/>
I agree, Pam.  I think the best answer to casual critics is a blinding<br/>
smile and vigorous, Tigger-like enthusiasm for unschooling. <br/>
(Eeyore-like outbursts won&#39;t make any friends. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I started unschooling at the preschool age, because my<br/>
confidence has grown over the years.  Now that my son is big enough for<br/>
store clerks to ask us why he is &quot;AWOL&quot; from school, I have no trouble<br/>
facing them down.  When people ask me why he&#39;s not in school at that<br/>
minute I give them a big, fat satisfied smile and tell them &quot;We<br/>
homeschool!&quot;  If I get any follow up about being at the store instead of<br/>
at the kitchen table, I just gush that we have a very flexible schedule.<br/>
<br/>
I try to leave the impression that I&#39;m thrilled with homeschooling<br/>
(unschooling) and that it&#39;s working great for us.  I want people to<br/>
shake their heads when I leave and wonder &quot;what drugs is that lady on?&quot;  &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Life is good,<br/>
Betsy  <br/>
<br/>
P.S.  (While I was having a great time at the Sac. conference, my s-i-l<br/>
was apparently plying my husband with skeptical questions about<br/>
homeschooling.  My smile may be blinding, but it apparently can&#39;t be<br/>
seen from 30 miles away.)  (And I think, based on her behind-the-back<br/>
timing, that my s-i-l has learned to fear my Tigger-like enthusiasm.  Go figure!)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-647452022">My personality probably won&#39;t support this kind of cheerleading.  <br/>
It&#39;s just not in my nature.  I could give her some positive updates <br/>
on things he&#39;s doing though and leave it at that.  Being non-<br/>
defensive ia the best advice.  I don&#39;t have anything to defend so it <br/>
makes sense.  I think she raises old fears and feelings I&#39;ve been <br/>
trying to get past, so I get irritated after talking to her.  But <br/>
irritated is better than angry, which is how I felt after her third <br/>
or fourth &quot;toilet-train him so he can go to pre-school&quot; speech.<br/>
