<div id="ygrps-yiv-551012462">Hi! I am fairly new to the site. My son wants to know about Algebra, <br/>
and I never did Algebra. I tried searching the web, but none of the <br/>
sites I pulled up interested him, and he just ended up getting <br/>
frustrated with it all, and said forget it. Does anyone know of a <br/>
good site for an 11 year old boy who is just curious about what <br/>
Algebra is, and is simple enough for a more kinestetic learner to <br/>
enjoy? Thank you so much! - Angie</div>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about websites, but there&#39;s an awesome book called &quot;The <br/>
Number Devil&quot; that my son really enjoyed reading. It&#39;s about a boy <br/>
who is visited in his dreams by a number devil, who shows him all <br/>
sorts of fun ways that numbers interact. It&#39;s not purely about <br/>
algebra (since that&#39;s a fairly artificial construct separating some <br/>
types of working with numbers from others) but it does include <br/>
sections on stuff like exponents, prime numbers, factorials, the <br/>
Fibonnaci sequence, and other stuff. The number devil has funny names <br/>
for things (like prime numbers are prima donna numbers) and in <br/>
general it&#39;s a fun story that explains concepts in graphic ways. <br/>
Another story book that involves math that he enjoyed is &quot;The man who <br/>
counted.&quot;<br/>

some cut out things to the park the other day and helped the little kids<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681134819">I haven&#39;t used it personally, but there is a board game that is <br/>
suppose to show young children how to do algebra equations, if that <br/>
is what he is wanting. It is called Hands-on Equations and if you do <br/>
a search, it should bring it up.  I have heard of others using it, <br/>
and liking it.  I thought that if my son wanted to learn algebra, I <br/>
would see if he liked it, he also figures things out through <br/>
movement. Peace - Tara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075936798">I HATE A Gebra Named Al.  It&#39;s *very* poorly written and the concepts <br/>
aren&#39;t clearly explained.  With editing it might have been a decent <br/>
but alas...<br/>
<br/>
My favorite algebra book is The Realm of Algebra by Isaac Asimov.  <br/>
It&#39;s out of print now but you may find it in a large city library or <br/>
a university library.  I actually copied the whole thing because I <br/>
could find only one copy in Houston. There&#39;s also a cool toy called <br/>
Math Muggins (I think) that a great algebra teaching tool.<br/>
<br/>
I always hated math and took algebra three times and never understood <br/>
it.  It&#39;s only through unschooling myself that I was able to discover <br/>
how beautiful it is.  Much of my time is spent doing silly math <br/>
things such as the dodecahedrons.  I even took a bunch of interested <br/>
kids over to the tennis court where we drew out the Koenisburg bridge <br/>
problem in chalk and tried to solve it by walking it.  When they <br/>
couldn&#39;t, I drew out the proof.<br/>
