<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621257199">Hey thanks Pam,<br/>
Those were some really cool ideas. The more I play I think wow I <br/>
could really make this more interesting :0) Anyway, I have a friend <br/>
who loves different kinds of dice and I bought two cans from her <br/>
catolog / web site (essential Mothers - I think ?) they are fron <br/>
Germany and are so cute. One has #&#39;s and there is a little booklet <br/>
for it with some ideas. The other one has the alphabet (all sides)on <br/>
it and I&#39;m not quite sure what to play with that game. <br/>
I really love the games because they are fun and Hasbro has come out <br/>
with a multitude of games this year (near me anayway)they must be on <br/>
to the home school community LOL........................<br/>
I would love to hear from more of you about your favorite games that <br/>
you and your children play.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Sonya</div>
