<div id="ygrps-yiv-790449067">Here is an old wives tale that worked for us.<br/>
if you have a baby who&#39;s days and nights are mixed up, change the direction <br/>
that they are sleeping. We flipped our daughter (while asleep) feet where <br/>
head was, and she started getting up in the morning instead of after dinner. <br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to think of... This is a Oriental idea. What wall are you <br/>
sleeping on? If your head goes to the east you sleep in later, west- early <br/>
riser. Do not put the head of the bed on a wall that has entrance to the <br/>
room, bad luck.<br/>
I believe that the direction that your head goes has to do with the the <br/>
spinning of the Earth and Sun coming up in your face. If you know what I <br/>
mean...&#92;<br/>
Words of wisdom? <br/>
everyone is now going on the late wall, LOL<br/>

Hey! this works, our bed heads toward the east, and we, the boys and I , <br/>
sleep late.  Their bed heads that way too.  Only thing is, dh sleeps in same <br/>
bed as I, and he gets up early.<br/>
