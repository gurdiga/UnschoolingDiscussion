<div id="ygrps-yiv-848333729">Hi again all,<br/>
<br/>
Here is a follow-up to a news story I posted sometime back about a local <br/>
mayor in Japan, who had threatened to dismiss public school teachers if <br/>
they did not force their students to sing the Japanese national anthem <br/>
and recognize the national flag.<br/>
<br/>
That mayor is back in the news, with plans to open a *new* school where <br/>
ostensibly he will have no such opposition to worry about -- and all <br/>
under the guise of &quot;more choices in education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Homelearners the world over are talking of &quot;more choices in education&quot; as <br/>
a reason for devoting ourselves to true learning without state <br/>
intervention. In Japan, that same concept is now being used as cover by <br/>
public officials to once again brainwash schoolchildren into believing <br/>
that the (mostly symbolic) Japanese emperor is an all-powerful Shinto god <br/>
who stands in human form....and will stand so forever.<br/>

DEBATE OVER KIMIGAYO LEADS MAYOR TO OPEN NEW SCHOOL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By Masahiko Okamura and Mashio Morita<br/>
Mainichi Shimbun <br/>
<br/>
YASUURA, Hiroshima -- Taking great pains to have the Kimigayo national <br/>
anthem sung at school ceremonies, the town mayor here plans to open a <br/>
private elementary school funded by the municipal government to ensure <br/>
the song is sung, it was revealed on Friday. <br/>
<br/>
Mayor Norihiko Okita of Yasuura, Hiroshima Prefecture, made headlines <br/>
recently when he sent scathing letters to teachers at the town&#39;s <br/>
elementary and junior high schools, urging them to sing Kimigayo during <br/>
graduation and entrance ceremonies. He had also sent similar letters to <br/>
students at the town&#39;s junior high schools. <br/>
<br/>
Okita, 54, said that the hoisting of the Hinomaru national flag and the <br/>
singing of Kimigayo at school ceremonies will be strictly observed in the <br/>
proposed new school, which will conduct education in compliance with <br/>
Ministry of Education guidelines, local sources said. <br/>
<br/>
He also said that the new school will offer the town residents more <br/>
choices in education. <br/>
<br/>
Under the plan, an educational foundation will soon be established by <br/>
several promoters, including a former principal of a prefectural senior <br/>
high school. The foundation will then collect contributions from those <br/>
who endorse the planned school, which is expected to open in April next <br/>
year admitting 30 pupils in the first grade. <br/>
<br/>
The town government is expected to repair an abandoned municipal <br/>
elementary school for its new venture. <br/>
<br/>
Annual operating costs of about 50 million yen will also be subsidized by <br/>
the municipality. Children of town residents will be exempted from paying <br/>
the admission fee of about 50,000 yen and monthly tuition of about 18,000 <br/>
yen, granting them the same conditions as those who attend public schools. <br/>
