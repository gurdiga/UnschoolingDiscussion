Hi Erin,<br/>
<br/>
Here I am again with no practical advice, just encouragement.  Tabitha is<br/>
only re-reading a Harry Potter book that we already read aloud. She&#39;d never<br/>
tackle a new one on her own. And her first book she ever read aloud, very<br/>
slowly and determinedly, was &quot;Go Dog Go&quot;. How&#39;s that for coincidence?<br/>
<br/>
This may have (in our case at least) something to do with her being in her<br/>
sister&#39;s shadow. (I&#39;ll just tie the other topic in here) With Cristina it<br/>
was so natural for her to read. With Tabitha she seems to need help. IMO,<br/>
Tabitha is more &quot;normal&quot;.  I see nothing wrong with teaching phonics to<br/>
someone who really wants to read and isn&#39;t getting it. But the most<br/>
important thing is reading aloud. I like Tabitha to sit next to me so she<br/>
can see what I&#39;m reading. Everyone&#39;s different....maybe Lynde is more<br/>
physical (kinesthetic) or auditory or whatever...rather than visual in her<br/>
learning.<br/>
What&#39;s the name of that book that describes the 7 different ways of<br/>
learning?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about the LD stuff.  Just being a slow reader at age 8 is no<br/>
big deal, even if she is a girl.  Have you ruled out vision problems?<br/>
<br/>
As for living in her sister&#39;s shadow &lt;sigh&gt;...this is the bane of Tabitha&#39;s<br/>
existence. Whatever Tabitha does well, Cristina did it better and did it<br/>
first. I keep looking for some quality that I can encourage, but for all<br/>
their differences, they excel at the same things (art, ballet, drama). What<br/>
can I do?  I&#39;m not going to discourage either of them from doing something<br/>
they love just because the other one does it, too. I just try to cheer them<br/>
both on.<br/>
<br/>
My computer is trying to crash again....Valerie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021927580">I have a question about learning disablities.  We are a big family, 5 <br/>
boys ages 3 to 16, and for a few years now, I have felt that my now 8 yr old <br/>
has some kind of learning disabilities.  He seems to have a really hard time <br/>
reasoning on things, responding in ways that don&#39;t make much sense.  He <br/>
seemed to want to learn to read so we used the &quot;Teach Your Child to Read in <br/>
100 Easy Lessons&quot; book, a phonics style approach, and he knows letter sounds <br/>
but he can&#39;t seem to grasp that they blend together, like F-U-N becoming <br/>
&quot;fun,&quot; even though we tell him the words.<br/>
     I don&#39;t know if this is at all relevant but when he was born, he got <br/>
pneumonia from swallowing meconium and had to be in the hospital for a week <br/>
with oxygen.  I didn&#39;t notice him being slower in anything until maybe age 3 <br/>
when he still didn&#39;t talk much or very clearly but my kids were all late <br/>
talkers, going from hardly talking at all to talking talking in long <br/>
sentences with surprisingly big words.  If it was just the reading, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be concerned but it&#39;s that we can&#39;t carry on much of a conversation <br/>
with him because he doesn&#39;t respond logically.   I can ask him where <br/>
something is and his answer will make sense but on more complex things, he <br/>
doesn&#39;t make sense.  <br/>
     I am wondering if there is some approach that would help.  One of my <br/>
friends said we should just put him in a special ed. class at school but <br/>
we&#39;re committed to learning at home and anyway, my mom works as a special ed. <br/>
aide part time and I&#39;m not impressed with what I&#39;ve heard about their <br/>
approaches.  I don&#39;t want to overreact to this situation and he is a happy <br/>
person, but I&#39;m wondering if someone has experience with this  and could <br/>
recommend ideas, books, whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
     Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t any personal experience.  Just wanted to commend your general <br/>
attitude.  I&#39;m sure that you will find the path that is best for ds.  That is <br/>
evident in your post.  Have confidence in what you are doing.<br/>
<br/>
If it helps any, all kids are &#39;slow learners&#39; in some area.  (My 12 yr old <br/>
only just learned to ride his bike, but he&#39;s been doing complicated math <br/>
problems for some time now, for instance.)  Maybe he&#39;s simply stronger in an <br/>
area that hasn&#39;t yet been discovered.  Of course, if there is a disability, <br/>
you&#39;ll want to help him achieve the most he can.  But, hey, you do the very <br/>
same thing for all of your children, right?<br/>
<br/>
I hope you find answers that contain more actual help.  In the mean time, <br/>
here&#39;s a pat on the back &lt;pat, pat, pat&gt;<br/>

<br/>
     Thanks for all that you said, Eiraul, and especially for mentioning <br/>
this.  He does seem to have more of a physical aptitude...learned to <br/>
rollerblade easily, loves jumping around and doing things that look like <br/>
gymnastics, learned to ride his bike easily.  <br/>
     I have thought about whether it&#39;s just a verbal thing with him but I <br/>
think it&#39;s more than that.  This morning, he and my 3 yr old were playing <br/>
with the Brio trains and he still can&#39;t figure out how to put the tracks <br/>
together to make any kind of a simple setup, even a circle.  I know this <br/>
probably sounds like I&#39;m comparing him in a negative way but I don&#39;t even say <br/>
anything about it...it&#39;s just something I can&#39;t help noticing.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
what approach to take because the conventional one seems to be that I need to <br/>
&quot;work with him&quot; and I don&#39;t want a situation where I&#39;m trying to make him <br/>
learn something and he&#39;s irritated and bored.  So I just let him go his own <br/>
way so far but I&#39;m wondering if with a learning disabled child, I should <br/>
expose him to things a little more directly.  Anyway, thanks again for your <br/>
response!<br/>

needs. And yes, I do think that some special needs children need things<br/>
placed directly in their path along with some gentle encouragment to attempt<br/>
some skills.  There&#39;s a fine line between helping the world open up for our<br/>
children and forcing them to see the world through our eyes.<br/>
<br/>
I have two very different sons.  One who is very spatially oriented and one<br/>
who is not......but the one who is not can make a cirlce with Brio trains. I<br/>
would be watching for ways I could help increase his skills.<br/>

Hi Lucy,<br/>
I can sympathize. My 7 yo dd has an ld called processing speed disorder and<br/>
she is dyslexic and most likely ADD. The best advice I can offer is Do Not<br/>
put your ds in a special ed. class. IMHO, the best place for kids with lds<br/>
is home sweet home. You might want to read The Missing Piece Meets the Big<br/>
O, Driven to Distraction, and Answers to Distraction. A lot of people don&#39;t<br/>
agree with CORE evaluations, but I found that knowing what specific lds my<br/>
dd had helped me learn to work with her better. Good Luck. I hope I was some<br/>
help. I know how frustrating it can be. BTW my dd was also in the NICU for<br/>
aspirating meuconium, unfortunatly I don&#39;t think we can blame that. &lt;Big<br/>
