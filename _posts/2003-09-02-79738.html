you being the BEST possible mother, by handing him that which you wanted most <br/>
as a child.  And by him rejecting that, he&#39;s rejecting you. Maybe?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think my son is suffering.  I have not forced him to do <br/>
anything.  I haven&#39;t even ASKED him to do anything as far as school, <br/>
or as far as the rest of his life, for that matter.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But it seems obvious that you EXPECT something, or your posts wouldn&#39;t be so <br/>
full of hurt and resentment.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; I would have loved it if somebody had offered me the <br/>

Still breathing?  Then it&#39;s not too late!  Go right ahead and study anything <br/>
and everything you want.  If you have internet access, the world is at your <br/>
fingertips.  I learn something new almost every day, by stumbling across <br/>
interesting pieces of information.  Right now, I&#39;m trying to learn the constellations <br/>
(what they look like, and how to find them in the sky) and the stories of how <br/>
they got their names.  I came across a book store going out of business, and <br/>
got a book about astronomy, a couple about plants, one about architecture, one <br/>
about the history of art, one about Native Americans, and one about Ancient <br/>
Egypt.  I&#39;m not &quot;studying&quot; these &quot;subjects&quot;, but I am learning.   Try to find a <br/>
balance between your &quot;responsibilities&quot; and what you need to make you happy.  <br/>
I hope your day gets better.<br/>

Mary, this is such a great post! sometimes we do find too much <br/>
of ourselves in our kidsÂ—we want them to live the life we didn&#39;t, <br/>
instead of living that life right now in front of them (not as a <br/>
model, but as an expression of our own choice to LIVE).<br/>
<br/>
In fact, it might be that we will lose some of that disappointment <br/>
in our kids if our own lives become naturally preoccupying. I <br/>
know in my life, when I&#39;m busy reading, writing, thinking, <br/>
studying, watching movies or TV, listening to books on tape, <br/>
cooking, tending my African violets, going to plays, I&#39;m happier <br/>
person, and I am living the very kind of life I imagine they&#39;d enjoy <br/>
too. And in our case, they really do seem to live this way naturally <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
