<div id="ygrps-yiv-417787697">Well, I just realized (when I never saw my own post appear) that I am not <br/>
getting messages from Yahoo, with the exception of one or two a day. So, <br/>
although I would like to respond to individual posts, it seems until I get <br/>
straightened out with Yahoo, I will read only at the web site. I will try to <br/>
keep up as best as I can. If anyone has any concerns about the list that need <br/>
addressing, please email me privately. Since we have quite a few new members <br/>
over the last week or so, I will post an administrative post on list <br/>
guidelines. <br/>
<br/>
I have a personal experience with Montessori, as Lelia decided a couple of <br/>
years ago to attend one. Her experience and also everything I observed there <br/>
personally indicates that Montessori is not anything like unschooling. The <br/>
activities are very structured and there is very little choice for the young <br/>
people. She looks back on that time as a valuable experience in where she <br/>
learned that she would never choose school again. (she was 10 at the time). <br/>
<br/>
As to the question you posed Ellissa. . . I am lovemary as well, but not life <br/>
is good Mary :) <br/>
<br/>
On Mary&#39;s comments on success. . . I understand what you are saying Mary. I <br/>
was not very clear. I actually believe that defining success is an individual <br/>
responsibility. . . I don&#39;t think I can define it for Lelia and Quinton or my <br/>
husband, but only for myself. So the parent who is trying to define what <br/>
success is for a  young person would not fit in with that. This gets into my <br/>
own personal belief system here, but I also try not to think too much in <br/>
terms of  success or failure, but more along the lines of everything being an <br/>
opportunity. Anyway, thanks for your thoughts on it, and allowing me to get <br/>
clearer about what mine were/are.<br/>

else you wrote, I thought we were. I thought it was worth clarifying for the <br/>
hundreds of others on this list for whom it may not have been so crystal <br/>
clear, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-866304335">Speaking of success, did Marylin Vos Savant&#39;s column about <br/>
homeschooling gewt discussed here?  I don&#39;t remember seeing it.  <br/>
Anyway, what bugged me most about it was the assumption that a woman <br/>
who chooses to raise kids instead of having a career is wasting her <br/>
talents.<br/>
