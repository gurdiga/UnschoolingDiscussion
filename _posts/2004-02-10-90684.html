<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439921174">Talking to the lady who came today  (my other changing assumptions post) got <br/>
me to thinking about a few things I have been thinking on a lot lately and <br/>
can&#39;t quite get in a good place in my head. Please bear with me while I try to <br/>
explain.<br/>
<br/>
It has to do with the ways school teach, life all broken up into subjects, <br/>
history, science, math and so on. To many people these subjects represent <br/>
everything important about school and also the way school teaches them is the <br/>
accepted method, very defined.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is life, our life here that is working pretty darned good. The <br/>
things I find myself thinking are important for life are sooo different. What I <br/>
see my kids doing is having a life, learning the good stuff that is important <br/>
in their individual lives. They are very different people even though they are <br/>
in the same family. If they were in school they would both be learning, let me <br/>
rephrase that since we really don&#39;t know that they are learning anything the <br/>
school thinks is being taught.  They would be hearing basically the same <br/>
information over time, the same subjects presented in very similar ways so they <br/>
(kids) might look and sound more alike if they were in school than they do now <br/>
since they are not and are at home and have not been encouraged for a long time <br/>
to think or act alike.<br/>
<br/>
  I have trouble articulating for myself let alone anyone else how the old <br/>
school model of subjects fits into our life. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think any of <br/>
those things are important but I don&#39;t necessarily think they are more <br/>
important than other things they might learn like how to buy groceries or buy a car <br/>
or teach someone snowboarding. They all have their place in life.<br/>
<br/>
 When you have lived a lifetime thinking that we have to learn American <br/>
History in 10th grade or whatever but then one day you look at American History <br/>
differently and think how can I ever decide what parts are good or important to <br/>
learn and what parts we can let go? When you visit say Williamsburg and you <br/>
read and walk and listen to the reenactors and you realize that there was much, <br/>
much more to this whole story that was ever in any textbook in 10th grade. Then <br/>
I start thinking about all of the subjects in the school model and all the <br/>
things my kids are doing, they are very busy  working on becoming themselves <br/>
which takes a lot more time than kids are usually allowed. Whew!<br/>
<br/>
My dilemma is then just quieting that old voice in my head that now and then <br/>
worries that somehow I am shortchanging my kids by not covering the <br/>
&quot;subjects&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Even rereading this is funny because I know they already know a lot in all <br/>
different subjects but I just can&#39;t box it up nice and pretty so I can check it <br/>
off a list.<br/>
<br/>
I sure hope this is understandable, thanks for reading,<br/>
Laura<br/>

<br/>
I had a huge moment the other day.  <br/>
<br/>
Sarah (14) casually mentioned that she might want to<br/>
go to a fine arts college when she was old enough. <br/>
Until that moment, she had always proclaimed that she<br/>
was going to live on a huge farm and care for rescued<br/>
animals with her best friend, never get married, adopt<br/>
lots of children, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I started looking at fine arts schools, and the<br/>
academic requirements are just as stringent if not<br/>
more so than regular colleges, and I started<br/>
hyperventilating.<br/>
<br/>
I kept thinking, &quot;Sandra says breathe, Sandra says<br/>
breathe&quot; until I calmed back down ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I could do a Scarlett O&#39;Hara and just think<br/>
about it tomorrow.  After making the paradigm shift,<br/>
how do we go back to school-think for preparing<br/>
transcripts and such, and will it be &quot;enough&quot;?  Will I<br/>
be trying to fit a round peg in a square hole?<br/>
<br/>
Obviously I have 4 years at least to figure this out,<br/>
since she is just 14 and goals have a way of changing<br/>
rapidly through the teen years.<br/>

<br/>
I doubt she wants to go to a fine arts school so that she can show off her <br/>
academic achievements.<br/>
<br/>
If a school has a list of what they would LIKE to see in a person who has <br/>
finished thirteen years of public school, that&#39;s about schoolkids.    What would <br/>
they accept seeing in a child who was there after years of having done <br/>
something way cooler than school?<br/>
<br/>
What does your daughter do now that she would continue to pursue in a fine <br/>
arts school?  If &quot;something,&quot; lean toward that.  If &quot;nothing,&quot; what makes her <br/>
think she want that school?  And if &quot;nothing,&quot; then spend some energy finding <br/>
opportunities for her to see, touch, explore, attempt those things she thinks a <br/>
school would teach her.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who went to Denver Arts Institute Whatever, an expensive <br/>
graphic arts thing.  He does some things along those lines, but he works for an <br/>
internet provider.   He does some webpage design, but no more or better than the <br/>
computer geeks he works with who never lifted a pencil.      He&#39;s a nice guy, <br/>
and he enjoyed art school, but it was expensive and gruelling and he doesn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;use it&quot; in the direct-financial-return most people think of when they think <br/>
of a degree being &quot;worthwhile.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So while she might end up going, staying, teaching, maybe instead of worrying <br/>
about solid geometry or British Literature, you could look at what she wants <br/>
from an art school.<br/>
<br/>
And breathe! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-581797269">howdy all!<br/>
 <br/>
i&#39;ve been on the list for a while now -- maybe a month or so -- and this is my first post.<br/>
 <br/>
so i&#39;ll start with my intro . . . i&#39;m an at-home mom to my dd (6y) and 3 dss (4y,2y, and 10 months).  we live in the dc &#39;burbs.<br/>
 <br/>
and the reason for my post . . . in my mind, for the past few days, i have been trying to formulate the exact thoughts laura shared with us into an email of my own.  and i&#39;m so glad laura did it!<br/>
 <br/>
in my case, i have saxon 1st grade math and 2nd year phonics for my dd and i have saxon k math and 1st year phonics for my ds.  now, let me explain why i&#39;m on this list.  since august, we&#39;ve cracked open those workbooks maybe ten times.  and while i agree with the unschooling approach 110%, i guess i&#39;m scared to make the cold-turkey jump.  every once in a while i&#39;ll retreat to my books.<br/>
 <br/>
(by the way, for what it&#39;s worth and for the times i do use them, i love the saxon approach and they work quite effectively for my children, so saxon is not a concern in my case.)<br/>
 <br/>
i&#39;m constantly wrestling with the same concerns and thoughts laura expressed.  and like laura, part of my mental debate is having priorities different from public school and from the &quot;standards of learning&quot; as to what is most important to learn.  as laura put it, &quot;learning the good stuff that is important in their individual lives.&quot;  so i definitely look forward to contributions to this particular thread!<br/>
 <br/>
as for the past month or so that i&#39;ve been lurking . . . y&#39;all are quite awesome, insightful, and wise!<br/>
 <br/>
peace,<br/>

her.  I used to tutor college students and got to know some of the admissions <br/>
guidelines -- if a self-directed, there-cause-she-wants-to-be student comes in, <br/>
they know she&#39;ll work hard and be prepared and fill in the gaps (everyone has <br/>
gaps) as she goes.  Many of the schooled students are so used to being <br/>
spoon-fed that they have a much harder time adjusting to college, no matter what their <br/>
transcripts say.  Admissions officers know this, in my experience.<br/>

<br/>
I was listening to Michael Feldman&#39;s &quot;What Do You Know&quot; last Saturday. He <br/>
picked a woman out of the audience, chatted for a minute, and then asked her why <br/>
she wanted to take part in the contest. Usually there are some very creative, <br/>
fun reasons people give for wanting to participate. She said, &quot;Because I&#39;d <br/>
like to.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
OK. Not the best answer I&#39;d heard, but.....<br/>
<br/>
Then he asks her a few more questions, like: <br/>
Are you a student? <br/>
Yes.<br/>
Where?<br/>
Some-lib-arts-school somewhere.<br/>
What&#39;s your major? <br/>
I don&#39;t have one yet.<br/>
What year are you?<br/>
Sophomore.<br/>
Oh, you have plenty of time to decide, then.<br/>
Yes.<br/>
What are your interests?<br/>
I don&#39;t really have any.<br/>
Well, what do you want to do?<br/>
Maybe social work?<br/>
Oh, so you like sociology? Psychology?<br/>
No.<br/>
Seeing this was going nowhere, he asks: SO, what do you do for kicks?<br/>
She thinks a minute and says: I don&#39;t have kicks.<br/>
No kicks? (you can hear his grin here)<br/>
No, there&#39;s nothing I&#39;m really interested in.<br/>
<br/>
At this point I had to get out of the car. Both because I was at my <br/>
destination, but too----I was afraid to hear the rest!<br/>
<br/>
Just amazing!<br/>

homeschool-to-college talk about the parents keeping a<br/>
journal of activities, books read, classes taken, etc.<br/>
so that they can then prepare a transcript.<br/>
<br/>
Cafi Cohen&#39;s book And What About College?<br/>
<br/>
Alison McKee&#39;s book From Homeschool to College and<br/>
Work<br/>
<br/>
The Unschooling Handbook by Mary Griffith<br/>
<br/>
and a couple more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So is this record keeping superfluous really?  Just an<br/>
academic exercise for the parents to help quell the<br/>
jitters of sailing uncharted waters and to quiet the<br/>
grandparents who are squawking about higher education?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-634803329">&quot;JEOPARDY!,&quot; AMERICA&#39;S FAVORITE QUIZ SHOW�, <br/>
HEADS TO WASHINGTON D.C.<br/>
<br/>
Nation&#39;s Capital To Host &quot;Power Players Week&quot; & <br/>
&quot;Kids Week,&quot; Taping April 3rd & 4th 2004<br/>
<br/>
CULVER CITY, CA (February 2, 2004) � JEOPARDY! producers announced today that the award-winning quiz show will tape two special weeks of programs in Washington D.C. at the DAR Constitution Hall on April 3rd and 4th, 2004. The nation&#39;s capital will play host to Power Players Week (airing nationally in syndication May 10-14) and Kids Week (airing nationally in syndication May 3-7). These highly anticipated shows mark the long-awaited return of JEOPARDY! to the D.C. area, where the show taped its very first remote � the original Power Players back in 1997. JEOPARDY! can be seen locally in Washington D.C. on WJLA-TV/ABC 7 at 7:30pm. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;ABC 7 is proud to host Alex Trebek and JEOPARDY! here in Washington.&quot; said Chris Pike, President and General Manager of WJLA-TV/ABC 7. &quot;With two exciting weeks of shows from the heart of our capital city, it&#39;s a great opportunity for local fans to watch their favorite program live and in person.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Washington D.C. is the quintessential location to showcase 2004 Power Players Week and Kids Week,&quot; said Harry Friedman, Executive Producer of JEOPARDY! &quot;The nation&#39;s capital provides an exciting and dynamic setting to present two weeks of very unique shows � highlighting our nation&#39;s leaders as well as celebrating the young people who are our nation&#39;s future.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Power Players features 15 of the country&#39;s most influential personalities, including political figures, authors, journalists and international newsmakers competing on behalf of their favorite charities. Each Power Player will earn a guaranteed $20,000 for the charity of their choice, while the winner each day will score a $50,000 jackpot for their special cause. (Celebrity contestant names are scheduled to be released in the coming weeks.)<br/>
<br/>
A future Jet Propulsion Lab scientist?... a future Neurological surgeon?... or the future President of the United States? JEOPARDY!&#39;s Kids Week, a traditional favorite among viewers, will feature 15 contestants between the ages of 10 and 12. The winner of each show keeps the money he or she wins, with a minimum guarantee of $10,000. In addition to the cash prizes, each student&#39;s school will be the recipient of the new &quot;Classroom JEOPARDY!&quot; an affordable electronic version of the famous quiz show. &quot;Classroom JEOPARDY!&quot; can be tailored by educators to suit their specific curriculum, while bringing the familiar sights and sounds (buzzers and all!) of JEOPARDY! directly into the classroom.<br/>
<br/>
The JEOPARDY! contestant search team will be in the Washington D.C. area March 20 & 21 auditioning and meeting kids between the ages of 10 and 12 to appear on Kids Week. For more information and details regarding auditions, please visit www.JEOPARDY.com.<br/>

<br/>
Saxon math up to third grade is very very different than Saxon math <br/>
starting with Saxon 5/4 and up through the higher levels.<br/>
<br/>
Saxon math up through 3rd grade is a very very very scripted (tells <br/>
parent what to say) program that has lots of hands-on manipulative <br/>
stuff, activities, and focuses on the real math young children are <br/>
discovering around them. It is a big waste of money - for an attentive <br/>
parent. There isn&#39;t anything in it that any child wouldn&#39;t come up with <br/>
just in the course of daily life - assuming a parent who puts some <br/>
effort into being with their kids and explaining things to them and <br/>
helping them understand things in a way that works for them. Assuming a <br/>
curious and enthusiastic parent who looks it up when the kid wonders <br/>
why we have 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour and who <br/>
thinks about why we have a ones place and a tens place and so on. <br/>
Parents don&#39;t have to KNOW everything. Unschooling parents really ought <br/>
to be willing to wonder and think and investigate though and, when it <br/>
comes to math, they have to be careful not to avoid it or brush it off <br/>
or say how they hate it.<br/>
<br/>
After 3rd grade level, Saxon is a program that emphasizes computational <br/>
skills and provides almost no explanation or context of any kind for <br/>
why the particular technique works as it does or when or why you&#39;d ever <br/>
want to do it. For a long time I had a bunch of Saxon books around here <br/>
and found them useful to quickly look up something I&#39;d forgotten, how <br/>
to find the volume of a cone, for example. Now I&#39;d just google it, so I <br/>
threw the Saxon math books away to clear some space. Saxon books <br/>
provide brief explanations of HOW to perform some computation, an <br/>
example or two or three, and then many many problems to work. There is <br/>
a set of 25 to 35 problems after each new computational skill is <br/>
introduced, but only about 5 of the problems are practicing that new <br/>
skill, the rest are review of skills previously introduced. This way <br/>
students practice everything they&#39;ve learned repeatedly, not just <br/>
practice the new skill and then not see it again.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t really see a place for Saxon math in an unschooler&#39;s life. I <br/>
can see a math book for older kids who have developed an understanding <br/>
of math concepts and wants to learn to &quot;do&quot; math - meaning wants to <br/>
learn all the math computation techniques that are usually in, say, a <br/>
pre-algebra book, but unschoolers in that position would find Saxon far <br/>
too dense - they wouldn&#39;t want to spend that much time reviewing over <br/>
and over and over.<br/>
<br/>
All that reviewing is necessary because the students aren&#39;t learning it <br/>
when it is introduced. It has to be drummed into their heads.<br/>
<br/>
But an interested learner who has the background understanding of why <br/>
things work as they do and who is learning it with a context in mind <br/>
where it would be useful - doesn&#39;t have the need to force things into <br/>
their brain with the Saxon sledgehammer.<br/>
<br/>
I do worry about unschooled kids and math - ONLY because so many of <br/>
their parents are so math phobic that they don&#39;t &quot;naturally&quot; support <br/>
the math learning that would otherwise ordinarily happen in an <br/>
unschooling family. I think unschooling parents have an obligation to <br/>
their children to find a way to get past their own math anxieties and <br/>
phobias.<br/>
<br/>
Throwing a Saxon math book in front of them is a good way to pass ON <br/>
those anxieties and phobias, imo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-256774187">hi pam!<br/>
 <br/>
while your post was definitely insightful, and i am grateful that you took the time to response, there were two major assumptions made in your approach, which may apply to some, but do not apply to me:  <br/>
 <br/>
1.&quot;It is a big waste of money - for an attentive <br/>
parent.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m not offended, nor did i take that personally -- i know you don&#39;t know me.  however, i do need to clarify that i would definitely consider myself an attentive parent who, as an unschooler would, takes care to present the world, and everything in it, to my children as a gigantic place to learn.    in retrospect, my husband and i were unschooling my six-year-old since the day she was born, counting to her in the five languages we know between us, without even knowing we were unschooling.  it&#39;s just our parenting style.<br/>
 <br/>
2.&quot;many of their parents are so math phobic that they don&#39;t &quot;naturally&quot; support the math learning that would otherwise ordinarily happen in an unschooling family&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
i majored in computer science, which by default in my case put me two math courses short from a double-major in math.  after organic chemistry, math is my favorite subject.  so the phobia issue also doesn&#39;t apply to me.  <br/>
 <br/>
but i do still seek advice and wisdom from all of you who have been there, so i&#39;ll also clarify why, in my attempt to analyze myself, i have an ever-present nagging little voice reminding me to hit the books.  i think it&#39;s more of an insurance -- making sure the minimums are met, they know what they&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to know, nothing will get left out, etc., so that we can get on with the business of doing the stuff we really enjoy without mom (ie me) having the anxiety that we&#39;re missing something somewhere.  i think it may be kind of the same philosophy behind &quot;teaching to the test.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
i can guess what some of y&#39;all&#39;s responses will be -- they&#39;ll learn, they don&#39;t need to be measured by society&#39;s standards but rather your own, their natural curiosity will lead them and you, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
i understand and agree wholeheartedly in principle.  in the meantime, though, my confidence is lacking.  sure i know i can look back when my kids are teens and adults and say, &quot;oh, yeah, they learned.&quot;  but when you&#39;re closer to the beginning of your journey as i am, where i don&#39;t really see results (and i&#39;m not talking about standardized tests), i feel like i have no option but to keep blind faith as i have, not listening to the little workbook voice.<br/>
 <br/>
making sense?<br/>

When I was 18 I figured out how to get my 15 year old sister into college <br/>

very short notice in 1971 or 1972, it should be LOADS easier now.<br/>
<br/>
She had to take an ACT test and fill out an application.  Then to stay in, <br/>
she had to do well the first term.<br/>

Last night Holly was sitting on the floor near me messing with her hands and <br/>
said &quot;It&#39;s so easy to count by nines and sixes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I sputtered that I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s easy at all.  She said but MOM, you <br/>
get... and she started on something about eights and sixes and my mind did that <br/>
white-light-freeze-out thing it does when someone says &quot;just think <br/>
mathematically, it&#39;s easy!&quot; and the light must have been coming out of my eyes, because <br/>
she said, &quot;Mom you always think in tens.  You and I see numbers so differently.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m at the beginning too Priscilla and we have workbooks but they mostly sit on a shelf getting dusty. My daughter pulls them down every once in awhile for some fun (for her its in the same category as dot-to-dots and colouring books) but not often. I wouldn&#39;t mind if she never did.<br/>
She&#39;s got a real head for math. Jigsaw puzzles and mazes are a breeze, she sees patterns everywhere, she has this sharp sense of logic and talent for analysing things that astounds me. She&#39;s exploring math in a way most kids never get to, which is, anyway she wants. For most kids math is about numbers and equations from day one, for my daughter its understood that that is only the language used to describe what goes on in real life.  I&#39;m hoping her exploration of math will be as much a creative pursuit as her dancing is. I know you aren&#39;t math phobic but maybe you&#39;ve narrowed your view of it to what can be shown on paper? Really, the next time your child is designing a pattern for a friendship bracelet or using the building blocks to fence in a stuffed animal, take a look at the real math their using. You don&#39;t have to go on blind faith, you just have to start looking for the math that surrounds you everyday and see how big and fun a part it is of your kids&#39; lives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, but you have to just tell the little workbook<br/>
demon voice to shut up.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t unschool everything except math.  It just<br/>
doesn&#39;t work.  Making your child do saxon every day or<br/>
every other day or twice a week or once a month is not<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I had to tell the demon voice of math workbooks to<br/>
shut up several times last week.  Like when my dad<br/>
started asking my 12yo if he had memorized his<br/>
multiplication tables yet.  Like when my 14yo said she<br/>
was thinking about going to college and what did she<br/>
need to do.<br/>
<br/>
When an older child chooses to do a math program on<br/>
their own, and it is self-initiated, then it is<br/>
unschooling, but little kids can and should learn all<br/>
their math through the environment at home. <br/>
Elementary school math, science, reading, history are<br/>
all taught with workbooks because there is no natural<br/>
home environment in a school.  Why settle for<br/>
artificial when you can give your child rich, real<br/>
happy experiences?<br/>
<br/>
Especially with your math background and language<br/>
background, you should not need to feel inadequate to<br/>
provide these.<br/>
<br/>
If you keep reading at unschooling.com and<br/>
sandradodd.com and here, you won&#39;t feel like you are<br/>
going on blind faith, you will feel confident.<br/>
<br/>
Read John Holt&#39;s Learning All The Time.<br/>

Read Nancy Wallace&#39;s Child&#39;s Work.<br/>
<br/>
Read Pam Sorooshian&#39;s math site.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  in retrospect, my husband and i were unschooling my six-year-old since <br/>
the day she was born, counting to her in the five languages we know between us, <br/>
without even knowing we were unschooling.  it&#39;s just our parenting style. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you didn&#39;t understand Pam&#39;s statement, though, there are things about <br/>
unschooling I think you have yet to understand.  If you believe in any dark part <br/>
of you that your daughter can&#39;t learn math without a math course, you shouldn&#39;t <br/>
claim to have been unschooling.  And for anyone, &quot;since the day she was born&quot; <br/>
was not a time you had an option not to put her in compulsory government <br/>
school, and so you probably were and should be proud of having been attentive and <br/>
giving parents, but I wouldn&#39;t claim unschooling before school age personally.<br/>
<br/>
-=-i majored in computer science, which by default in my case put me two math <br/>
courses short from a double-major in math.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
It also puts you in the likely space of believing that math instruction is <br/>
vital.<br/>
<br/>
-=- i have an ever-present nagging little voice reminding me to hit the <br/>
books. -=-<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re trying to help you breathe through that and see the learning outside <br/>
the books.<br/>
<br/>
-=-without mom (ie me) having the anxiety that we&#39;re missing something <br/>
somewhere. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Run through in your mind everyone you know and whether any of them missed <br/>
something somewhere.   No matter what school experience a person has, something <br/>
is missed.  Some have teachers who loved 18th C. literature so they&#39;ve read <br/>
fifteen novels from that time and as many poems.  Some read zip from that <br/>
century.     Neither will suffer longterm emotional or financial harm from that.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who didn&#39;t grow up in New Mexico missed a year of New Mexico history, <br/>
but if they&#39;re curious or if they move here and want to be more conversant, a <br/>
few hours&#39; reading can catch them up on some causes, names and timelines, and <br/>
if any of it strikes their curiosity up they can spend hours to a lifetime <br/>
learning more.<br/>
<br/>
If I move to another state, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll try to figure out where I am and <br/>
why others are there.<br/>
<br/>
-=-i can guess what some of y&#39;all&#39;s responses will be -- they&#39;ll learn, they <br/>
don&#39;t need to be measured by society&#39;s standards but rather your own-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not even your own.  Someday you&#39;ll stop measuring, if you don&#39;t give up in <br/>
fear before then.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally I see a lack in one of my kids.  But way more than occasionally <br/>
I see a stunning maturity or ability or experience I know they would not have <br/>
had if they had been in school.  And I have never yet seen a lack I thought <br/>
couldn&#39;t be overcome with a little practice or inquiry later.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is fifteen and is at the moment in his third of ten driver&#39;s ed <br/>
classroom sessions.  The only slightly schoolish thing he had ever done before was a <br/>
weeklong intense Jr. Police Academy, last summer.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty was afraid he wouldn&#39;t be able to take notes fast enough.  He sat and <br/>
wrote things one night, practicing writing quickly and legibly.  He&#39;s <br/>
blockprinting.  I asked if it would help to hold his notebook this way or that, but he <br/>
said no, he was on it as was.   <br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s a lefty.  He&#39;s good at spatial reasoning and mathish stuff.  Puzzles. <br/>
 He can do any of those little nine-square puzzles in a minute.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
finished one in my life.  We quit buying them for him.  $6 or $8 apiece, and he <br/>
works them in a minute or two.<br/>
<br/>
If Marty had been in school, he and we would have heard the word &quot;dyslexic&quot; <br/>
many times, but Marty never heard it once unless he heard it from friends of <br/>
his or on TV.  It didn&#39;t matter, because we didn&#39;t press him to do anything <br/>
before he just figured out how to do it.  He would have had to figure out his own <br/>
way to do it at school anyway.   <br/>
<br/>
Monday night they gave a pre-test.  He missed four.  Three were because he <br/>
misread a question.  It was asked (in what exact words I don&#39;t know) for them to <br/>
indicate which thing was not needed in the car when driving.  The right <br/>
answer would have been the car&#39;s title.  Marty had two disadvantages. He was <br/>
unaware of testing traditions and set-ups.  He read it as &quot;what do you need when <br/>
you&#39;re driving&quot; and marked all but one answer.<br/>
<br/>
His main problem was not knowing that multiple choice questions generally <br/>
only have one answer (and certainly on a ten-item test).  So he got three points <br/>
off on one item. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He still got his learner&#39;s permit, and he didn&#39;t know what the title of an <br/>
automobile was anyway.  Neither did the other kids, but they knew enough from <br/>
having taken tests for years that the one thing they&#39;d never heard of was &quot;the <br/>
right answer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because he missed it, though, we told him about what automobile titles are <br/>
and why they shouldn&#39;t be carried in the car.  He and Keith had watched a movie <br/>
about racing for titles, and Keith reminded him that&#39;s what they are.  Oh!   <br/>
<br/>
I doubt any of the other kids, who got it right, discussed car titles when <br/>
they got home.  Maybe. <br/>
<br/>
The very small list of things that schools consider &quot;everything&quot; is not worth <br/>
basing a life on.   If I lived my life so that my children would have that <br/>
set of information, they would be missing much more information.  The small set <br/>
they can pick up later.  The larger, no-walls wide-world set of information <br/>
seems to them theirs.  They don&#39;t know what is &quot;too old&quot; or &quot;too young&quot; or &quot;too <br/>
hard&quot; for them.  They learn what they learn.  They ask what they wonder.   If <br/>
later they want to checklist themselves on what they might have missed in <br/>
school, it won&#39;t take long.<br/>
<br/>
-=-sure i know i can look back when my kids are teens and adults and say, <br/>
&quot;oh, yeah, they learned.&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
It will help if you can find other people&#39;s older kids and just hang out with <br/>
them. Don&#39;t quiz them, just look into their eyes.  Listen to them interacting <br/>
with other kids and adults.  Let the differences wash over you. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

to deal with it so you can get on with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
This list is sort of the no-excuses room. ;-) We&#39;ve *all* got barriers of<br/>
one form or another that stand between us and where we want to be. This is a<br/>
place to get advice and discuss what to do about the barriers rather than<br/>
comfort and understanding over the barriers&#39; existence.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In some ways that can be a detriment. For one thing, those who like math are<br/>
drawn to an orderly, linear type of learning. Knowing that what you need to<br/>
know is all laid out in step by step order is very comforting.<br/>
<br/>
For another thing, being aware of all the math you &quot;needed&quot; to go through to<br/>
get where you ended up, it&#39;s hard to imagine it being gotten in anyway but<br/>
through textbooks.<br/>
<br/>
(I was an electrical engineer major, BTW.)<br/>
<br/>

&gt; natural curiosity will lead them and you, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, because that&#39;s not where you&#39;re stuck. You&#39;re stuck holding onto the<br/>
side telling us you&#39;re just human not a fish like the rest of us ;-) so we<br/>
just have to understand where you are and why you aren&#39;t swimming around<br/>
like we are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in the meantime, though, my confidence is lacking.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And the way to get over that isn&#39;t by making your kids do things. It&#39;s by<br/>
doing something yourself: reading here, reading the message boards at<br/>
Unschooling.com, reading Sandra&#39;s website. There are ways to gain that<br/>
confidence. But you need to focus on fixing that problem, not the made up<br/>
problem of your children not providing you with the feedback you need.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you for understanding that I wasn&#39;t making assumptions about you <br/>
and that anything anybody writes on this list can be used as a starting <br/>
point for discussion, without it being personal.<br/>
<br/>
These materials are NOT inexpensive. I still think that those early <br/>
grade Saxon kits are a waste of money and there is a good chance you <br/>
eventually agree, as you see how they learn so much better when they <br/>
learn on their own timetable instead of John Saxon&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve only cracked the books about 10 times, you&#39;re not doing it <br/>
the &quot;Saxon Way,&quot; anyway, you know, since you&#39;re supposed to be doing a <br/>
&quot;Daily Meeting,&quot; etc.<br/>
<br/>
In case people are now wondering what the subjects are in Saxon - that <br/>
I say you will almost certainly &quot;cover&quot; in your daily life with your <br/>
kids ----- here is a description of Saxon Kindergarten:<br/>
oral counting; recognizing and sequencing numbers; identifying ordinal <br/>
position; acting out addition and subtraction stories; counting with <br/>
one-to-one correspondence; sorting; patterning; graphing real objects <br/>
and pictures; identifying and counting pennies, nickels, and dimes; <br/>
identifying one half; identifying shapes; covering and replicating <br/>
geometric designs; measuring using nonstandard units of measure; <br/>
telling time to the hour; and using a calendar.<br/>
<br/>
There is a huge amount of repetition built in even in the lower grade <br/>
levels - so they cover how to count money in kindergarten and then <br/>
again in 1st grade, 2nd grade, and then finally in 3rd grade they get <br/>
to how to make change from a dollar.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about you all, but calendars and money and counting <br/>
numbers, and figuring out who is &quot;first&quot; and &quot;second&quot; (ordinal <br/>
position), and all the above happened very naturally in my kids&#39; lives.<br/>

Aaron&#39;s 6th birthday is at the end of March, and he<br/>
was standing in the kitchen yesterday looking at the<br/>
calendar.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What year is it?&quot; he asked.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is 2004.  Did you mean what month is it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, what month is it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is February.&quot;<br/>

&quot;No, your birthday is in March.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Next day?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, next month.  Want to see how many days?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yeah&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Took the calendar off the wall, and showed him Feb.<br/>
11th, and flipped the page and showed him his<br/>
birthday.<br/>
<br/>
He only wanted to count the days in March, so we<br/>
started counting.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hey!  The numbers we are saying are the same as the<br/>
numbers in each box!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, pointing to each number he said the names, as we<br/>
went along, until he got to thirteen and stumbled a<br/>
bit.  So I just said what the numbers were while he<br/>
pointed until we got to more numbers he recognized.<br/>
<br/>
But by the time we got to 25 he was upset that there<br/>
were still so many days until his birthday. LOL!<br/>

Built a large building with legos, counted one side<br/>

color to use on the other side.<br/>
<br/>

wants to know when Ed, Edd, and Eddy comes on at 2pm,<br/>
and when the KidsWB afternoon shows start at 3pm.<br/>
<br/>
He also knows 1/2 hours, because most shows for kids<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189113435">I&#39;d known about unschooling for years.  A friend had told me about it and I knew his daughter and how I adored her.  <br/>

The first day that I tried to sit Madison down to &quot;do work&quot; and saw the look on his face.  It was pain.  It was anxiety.  It was him saying &quot;So you took me out of school to do this???  Is this love????&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been at this that long.  Really...a very short time.  In the last couple of weeks, the things I&#39;ve witnessed by child-led learning.  Yesterday, he pulled out a set of subtraction flash cards and said to my 5yo &quot;Max, you wanna learn subtraction?  I have an idea for a math game!!!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t give him that idea.  I didn&#39;t even realize the flashcards were buried somewhere in his room.  In the process of finding them, he not only got a little math in, but made up a game for his younger brother!  <br/>
<br/>
My workbook voice got killed when I saw that look on his face...it&#39;s been getting quieter every day as I watch them learning.  Sure, most times, the first thing out of his mouth in the morning is &quot;Can I play the PS2???&quot;.  My little gamer (gee, wonder where he gets it *whistles*).  <br/>
<br/>
Jump in, Priscilla!  The water&#39;s fine.  It&#39;s really amazing the things they&#39;ll want to learn.  <br/>

  Yes, but you have to just tell the little workbook<br/>
  demon voice to shut up.<br/>
<br/>
  You can&#39;t unschool everything except math.  It just<br/>
  doesn&#39;t work.  Making your child do saxon every day or<br/>
  every other day or twice a week or once a month is not<br/>
  unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
  I had to tell the demon voice of math workbooks to<br/>
  shut up several times last week.  Like when my dad<br/>
  started asking my 12yo if he had memorized his<br/>
  multiplication tables yet.  Like when my 14yo said she<br/>
  was thinking about going to college and what did she<br/>
  need to do.<br/>
<br/>
  When an older child chooses to do a math program on<br/>
  their own, and it is self-initiated, then it is<br/>
  unschooling, but little kids can and should learn all<br/>
  their math through the environment at home. <br/>
  Elementary school math, science, reading, history are<br/>
  all taught with workbooks because there is no natural<br/>
  home environment in a school.  Why settle for<br/>
  artificial when you can give your child rich, real<br/>
  happy experiences?<br/>
<br/>
  Especially with your math background and language<br/>
  background, you should not need to feel inadequate to<br/>
  provide these.<br/>
<br/>
  If you keep reading at unschooling.com and<br/>
  sandradodd.com and here, you won&#39;t feel like you are<br/>
  going on blind faith, you will feel confident.<br/>
<br/>
  Read John Holt&#39;s Learning All The Time.<br/>
<br/>
  Read Nancy Wallace&#39;s Child&#39;s Work.<br/>
<br/>
  Read Pam Sorooshian&#39;s math site.<br/>
<br/>
  Read the book Family Math.<br/>
<br/>
  And tell that workbook voice to go away, just like<br/>
  smeagol told gollum in The Two Towers.  &quot;Go away and<br/>
  never come back!&quot;<br/>
