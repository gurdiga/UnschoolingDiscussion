<div><font color="#000080" size="2">Okay, so after I posted the original Harry 
Potter warning, and my response, I did find out from a few people that the 
Onion, the URL listed in the original email, is a satirical e-zine.&nbsp; That&#39;s 
fine... but what primarily concerned me was that this was passed to me from the 
leader of&nbsp;one of my homeschool groups. Since I received it from three 
individuals in one day, I was concerned that it would be passed around to many 
more quickly, and wanted to &quot;nip it in the bud.&quot;</font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">My response&nbsp;was composed so that anyone who 
had received the original would have the other side too.&nbsp; I wasn&#39;t stating 
that the original was true, just that anyone who did read the original should 
beware... of course, had I known then that it was based on a satirical website, 
I wouldn&#39;t have put so much thought into the answer!</font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">The biggest irony here is that whenever I 
receive a &quot;warning&quot; email from anyone, the first thing I do is go onto a website 
to check it out and make sure it&#39;s not a hoax... they sure got me good this 
time! &lt;g&gt;</font></div>

<div><font color="#000080" size="2">Sorry, but at least we&#39;re all a little more 
informed (hopefully)....</font></div>

I guess we were all a little busy shaking our heads over what a doofus the<br/>
author of the anti-Harry Potter letter was. I should add that I did read<br/>
your rebuttal and it was awsome. You articulated much of the admiration and<br/>
love I already have for these books. I really think this series will remain<br/>
as one of the classics of children&#39;s literature----- and (as Walter Concrite<br/>
used to say) we are there!<br/>
