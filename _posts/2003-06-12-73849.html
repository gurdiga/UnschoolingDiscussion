Ah, but Birkenstocks!  Being in the north, they&#39;re not great when there&#39;s <br/>
snow on the ground. But even in the winter, with heavy socks, they are comfy and <br/>
cozy. I usually buy a pair every couple of years, and wear them as much of the <br/>
year as I can. Even after the couple of years, they&#39;re wearable, just a bit <br/>
worn. You can get stuff to protect the cork, or they can be re-soled, but I&#39;m <br/>
lazy and disorganized, so I never do that. I figure, $90, every two years, <br/>
nearly year-round wear...It&#39;s actually pretty cost-effective.<br/>

stuff?<br/>
<br/>
For me, it was elastic waist pants.  I remember clothes shopping with my <br/>
mother as a teenager. She held up a pair of pants with an elastic waist, saying, <br/>
&quot;These look comfortable!&quot;  I suspect I made a cross with my fingers or <br/>
something, as well as giving her a disdainful, horrified look.<br/>
<br/>
A number of years later I discovered, yes, they ARE comfortable, and that&#39;s <br/>
MUCH more important.<br/>
<br/>
My mom asked if she could (and was given permmission to) wear Birkenstocks to <br/>
my wedding. <br/>

style you want. Mine last for years.  Although I have so many that I wear each <br/>
pair less.  And I take care of the cork.  I do wear mine year round.<br/>
