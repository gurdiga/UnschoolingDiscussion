&gt;Okay, let me ask you a hypothetical:<br/>
&gt;If your child chooses to shoot up heroin because he likes it, is it <br/>
&gt;his choice and you will allow it? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The scope of a child&#39;s world will grow as he grows. Therefore, his <br/>
ability to self-impose will take the same steps in relation to his world.<br/>
<br/>
Almost all 5yos will not have access to heroin. So the scope of their <br/>
world will be within the realm of TV, chores, eating.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid is allowed to set their own path in steps during their growth, <br/>
then they will not be the kind of child that needs heroin to feel <br/>
self-worth.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How about if he expresses a desire <br/>
&gt;to be free of the monkey but needs help, will you impose forced rehab <br/>
&gt;when he starts to relapse?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If my child is at the point that an addiction is controlling their life, <br/>
then I would be the last person that can help them.<br/>
<br/>
If my child has self-worth and confidence, he won&#39;t be in that position. <br/>
If he doesn&#39;t and seeks another way to deal with his pain, then I&#39;m the <br/>
one who didn&#39;t give him what he needed to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
I would be there to offer myself to the group counselor if that would <br/>
help us figure out why he has the pain to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I guess my questionis; is there any limit you would feel is okay to <br/>
&gt;impose?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We impose health and safety rules only. And those change with age. The <br/>
scope of their world widens, and so does the self-responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
The safety issues are exposed to him in steps according to his age. For <br/>
example: In the wake of 911, and living in NYC, I didn&#39;t feel it was <br/>
necessary to tell my son what happened. He&#39;s 5 and doesn&#39;t need to have <br/>
his world shaken up with a rare instance.<br/>
<br/>
He only needs to be aware of the saftey issues that fall within the realm <br/>
of his world. Like being aware of not crossing the street alone. Being <br/>
aware to stay close to adult when at a store. Being aware that not ALL <br/>
strangers are nice. So without getting into too much detail, its <br/>
important that he knows that people exist that will take kids from their <br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
As he grows and will spend more time away from me, this scope will <br/>
broaden. But so will his experience in life.<br/>
<br/>
As far as health. There is no negotiation. We live an alternative health <br/>
lifestyle and this is the only part of his life that has absolutes. When <br/>
he&#39;s old enough to take care of himself I trust he will make the best <br/>
decision for his health.<br/>
