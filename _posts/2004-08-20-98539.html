<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847259563">I forgot to mention a few things:<br/>
<br/>
Wyl is almost 5 1/2<br/>
We don&#39;t screen anything for &quot;scary&quot; stuff-he self-regulates that <br/>
wonderfully.<br/>
We don&#39;t watch much t.v./videos at all-adults or family (we have been <br/>
watching the olympics nightly as Wyl is very interested in gymnastics-but not the <br/>
WOMEN&#39;S! lol, but we tape it the night before and watch it the next evening so we <br/>
can fast forward through the &quot;other stuff&quot; and commercials-plus, we can pause <br/>
to look at stuff in detail)... maybe an hour a week family watching? No, more <br/>
like 2 or 3... we just do other stuff... I tend to watch a lot of news <br/>
programs I have taped in the evening after the boys have gone to bed, while I&#39;m <br/>
working on the computer, but other than that, we don&#39;t do much but a 2-3 more <br/>
hours of sci-fi (a week) as adults.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that covers it...<br/>
