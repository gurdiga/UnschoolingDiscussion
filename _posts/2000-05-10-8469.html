 </span></blockquote>You need to:<br/>
<br/>
a) register the domain name of your choice<br/>
<br/>
b) have somewhere to house it<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Registering a domain name is $70 for 2 yrs and is easy to do.<br/>
<br/>
Having a place to house the domain is a bit more complicated.  Some ISPs<br/>
are great about it, others are not.  Some allow you to have as many e-mail<br/>
address on that domain, without charge, and with it so you can set them up,<br/>
others do not.<br/>
<br/>
My ISP, lightlink,  is a great place to house a domain.  It&#39;s $100/yr if<br/>
you already have dial up access elsewhere.  It&#39;s very user friendly, easy<br/>
to manage.  The other local ISP is a pain in the ass, and I&#39;d never use<br/>
them again.<br/>
<br/>
If you decide to do this, I can give you a list of what to ask the ISPs you<br/>
check out, and what the preferred answers would be.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi Stephanie,</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I looked into domain registration very thoroughly 
recently.&nbsp; The basic cost is $70 for the first two years, but a number of 
registration companies find other ways to add to this charge.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The simplest thing is to register through these 
people - <a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://domainsarefree.com/faqs.html">http://domainsarefree.com/faqs.html</a>&nbsp;- 
who don&#39;t have any hidden extras and you don&#39;t even have to pay 
straightaway!&nbsp; You get a bill sent to you.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">That will secure your domain name and they will 
hold it for you until you have decided to what site you want to apply that 
name.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">There are literally hundreds of options on where to 
establish your site - a huge number of them are free.&nbsp; These are called 
&quot;web hosting&quot; sites.&nbsp; Put those two words in any search engine and find a 
web host that suits your needs, style and budget.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">When you have got a site established, then you 
transfer your domain name to it - the web hosts you have chosen will tell you 
how to do this.</font></div>
