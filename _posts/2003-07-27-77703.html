<div id="ygrps-yiv-32354830">The way I see this whole thing about discussion/debate and people who get huffy, is this...<br/>
<br/>
People come here wanting to know something about unschooling, that&#39;s a given. Some are ready to make changes in their lives, whatever has happened in their lives has put them in a place where they&#39;re ready to learn the things that bring about happy unschooling.<br/>
It is not the job of anyone here to GET people ready to accept the &quot;lesson&quot; of unschooling/gentle parenting. Only an individual, in their own unique way and time can get to the place where they&#39;re ready.<br/>
This list isn&#39;t here to get them ready.<br/>
It&#39;s here to help those that ARE ready.<br/>
<br/>
If someone comes here and is in a place in their lives and learning where they aren&#39;t ready, there isn&#39;t ONE thing anyone here can say that will help. NO matter how kindly, how wonderfully phrased or how much Non-violent communication the list members use, it is NOT going to sink in.<br/>
So I don&#39;t think that the majority of folks that come here for information are going to get help if we water the information down for those that aren&#39;t going to &quot;get it&quot; at this point anyway!!<br/>
<br/>
Oom/Chris may have more experiences in life and learn more and someday really be ready to learn about unschooling. Great! But she obviously is NOT ready right now. I wasn&#39;t at certain times in my life either. All of us have our own journey and these things often can&#39;t be rushed (which is unfortunate for any children that are being treated less respectfully) but the list isn&#39;t going to help the highest percentage of people unless it DOES focus on getting information to those that really want it anyway.<br/>

Thanks, Ren, this is a valuable point and I think it&#39;s what I needed to hear.<br/>
