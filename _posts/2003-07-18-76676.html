<div id="ygrps-yiv-870315275">As I said, I&#39;m reading &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; and just wanted to comment on a part <br/>
that I LOVED...and man, did it speak volumes to me.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt is talking about a little 3 year old who spilled her milk, and says <br/>
:  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I walked in at this opint and started with the running &#39;No, No&#39; commentary <br/>
in a whiny voice:  &#39;Ooooh no, Lisey, you should have asked someone to pour you <br/>
a  glass of milk - no, don&#39;t wipe it up, it&#39;s going on the floor;  now stop, <br/>
don&#39;t do it, I&#39;ll do it, it&#39;s bad enough on the table - look, now you&#39;ve got it <br/>
on the floor - you&#39;re making more work for me.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Happily at this point I was struck by a rare beam of sanity and it said to <br/>
me, &#39;Oh, quit being such a bitch, Lisey has just poured her first glass of milk <br/>
all by herself and you&#39;re ruining the whole thing for her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow, it&#39;s so easy to slip into being a bitch and not realize it.  After <br/>
reading that this morning, I caught myself many, many times before I became a bitch <br/>
and we had the nicest day we&#39;ve had in a long time.  Amazing how my having a <br/>
good attitude can affect the whole family so much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-350247394">Oh I loved that part! I just read the book a month ago and that part really struck me, especially as a parent that is new to the concepts of unschooling and thinking of children in these ways. I think that I always instinctually knew that these practices were the best way to treat children but it is so hard to believe yourself when the way that you were raised is the complete opposite of unschooling and also when the world around you is telling you something different. My little 3 year old and I have been having a really battle lately over all sorts of things and I have been trying so hard to just let her find her way , to be patient (this is SO important... when I am rushed she is screaming behind me, the second I slow down she has the opportunity to explore and regain control) so yesterday she spent a good portion of the day having to be patient because we had a couple doctors appts and we had errands to do. It was kind of a boring day for her and she had some moments. I understood<br/>
 and I was there for her an dlistened to her and did not lose my patience with her. So last night we are lying in bed to gether and she says, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, mama.&quot; and I said, &quot;what are you sorry for?&quot; and she said that she was sorry because she had spent the day yelling at me. She said, &quot;you didn&#39;t yell at me, but I REALLY yelled at you.&quot; Oh, it broke my heart, I felt so bad for her but at the same time I was so glad that she was able to understand that I didnt yell at her. And I told her how much I loved her and how sometimes we all lose it a little bit and I was glad she was feeling better. We cuddled and she fell asleep, three fingers in her mouth and one hand rubbing my ear:)                  Kelli<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s kinda wierd, because everytime I read about people like John Holt, or <br/>
Mr. Rogers, or any kindly older man (I mean older than I am or was as a child) <br/>
it reminds me of my dad.  I cannot even remember my dad spanking me more than <br/>
once, and I remember him coming into my room later, sitting down on the bed, <br/>
hugging me and saying sorry.  I can&#39;t even speak of my dad without getting tears <br/>
in my eyes.  It&#39;s like he got the concept of peaceful parenting back when <br/>
everyone else was still beating their kids.  My mom spanked us a little more, but <br/>
I can probably count the times on one hand.  She was a little more &quot;moody&quot; <br/>
than my dad, probably because of abuse she suffered as a child.  But she tried <br/>
so hard.  She was constantly buying neat pens and paper and art projects and <br/>
crafty stuff and doing it with us.  She was awesome in that way.  <br/>
<br/>
But, I did go to school, and I know it left awful scars on my life.  Jr. High <br/>
School was a nightmare.  I went to school with the richest kids in Long <br/>
Beach, who were so cruel to middle class and poor kids.  But there just wasn&#39;t any <br/>
homeschooling then.  I can remember waking up in the morning and many, MANY <br/>
times faking a headache or stomach ache to get out of school. <br/>
