 </span></blockquote>Sandy, I&#39;ll tell this the best I can and as short as I can. The court <br/>
proceedings are all a matter of public record in Washington state. <br/>
<br/>
Cheryl Lindsey Seelhoff is the publisher/editor of a magazine called Gentle <br/>
Spirit. It was pretty popular about 6 years ago with conservative Christian <br/>
homeschoolers and she was a popular speaker at conferences,. Gentle Spirit <br/>
recently came back into publication after a forced hiatus of about 5 years. <br/>
Seems Cheryl&#39;s very abusive husband left her and their 9 kids in some pretty <br/>
dire straights about 5 years ago. When she refused to take him back under <br/>
orders of some of the homeschool &quot;pillars&quot;, they set out to put her out of <br/>
business. And did. They made sure she lost the sole support of herself and <br/>
her 9 children by calling her advertisers, columnists and subscribers and <br/>
telling them some pretty nasty tales. She was followed around online <br/>
and....it&#39;s hard to describe how badly some people will treat someone who was <br/>
highly respected and then disappointed them. It was awful to read the vitriol <br/>
people posted online about this woman. Even before I knew what any of it was <br/>
about, I was just appalled that people would act that way toward another <br/>
human being.<br/>
<br/>
So she filed suit in United States District Court claiming, among other <br/>
things negligence, public disclosure of private facts, defamation, outrage, <br/>
antitrust violations, and violations of the Lanham Act. The defendants named <br/>
in the suit were Mary Pride, Sue Welch of Teaching Home, Gregg Harris <br/>
(HSLDA), Christian Life Workshops, Christian Home Educators of Tacoma,  <br/>
Calvary Chapel of Tacoma, Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, and Christian Home <br/>
Educators of Ohio. Mary Pride, Gregg Harris, Calvary of Costa Mesa, and CHEO <br/>
settled out of court. <br/>
<br/>
Sue Welch decided to let a jury hear the case. Probably not a good move on <br/>
her part, although she had some pretty big names in the conservative <br/>
Christian homeschool community testifying for her, including  Michael Boutot, <br/>
former chair of CHEO, Mary Pride, Gregg Harris, and Robert Green, Editor of <br/>
Quit You Like Men. <br/>
<br/>
The jury found Sue Welch guilty of conspiracy under the Sherman Anti-trust <br/>
Act and that she had damaged Cheryl under the Sherman Anti-trust Act.  I <br/>
think the ones who settled out of court were probably pretty glad they did. <br/>
Whatever the jury gives in an anti-trust suit is automatically tripled, I <br/>
believe, and she had to pay Cheryl&#39;s legal fees as well.<br/>
<br/>
When I heard about this, I was pretty surprised that I&#39;d lived and <br/>
homeschooled in Ohio through the whole thing and didn&#39;t hear a word about it. <br/>
Seems like this would be something a support group wouldn&#39;t keep from its <br/>
membership. Maybe I just don&#39;t travel in the right circles though. Anybody <br/>
else from Ohio hear anything about CHEO&#39;s involvement? I&#39;m sure there must be <br/>
records some where.<br/>
