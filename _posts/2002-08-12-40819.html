&gt; I was wondering... we&#39;ve talked about math a little bit. I&#39;d like to<br/>
&gt; hear how everyone&#39;s kids have done unschooling how far they went with<br/>
&gt; it. <br/>

Your post got into lots of details of how you did math with kids. Almost no<br/>
one uses much of the math they did in school. They use what they need, and<br/>
if they remember it. Why? It wasn&#39;t relevant to their lives then. (the<br/>
didn&#39;t need to know the speed of that train or when it would get to the<br/>
station, and cared less)<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, a homeschooler taking a trip across Nebraska who is hungry and hopes<br/>
to get to a town soon where there might be a restaurant, might take a look<br/>
at the map and find out when s/he might get dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Our kid never studied math at all growing up, but always knew how to figure<br/>
out things, because math is common sense. Frequent use of money helps a lot.<br/>
When our youngest son decided to go to college, he got a SAT practice book<br/>
and took the test.  Scored 1390 - higher than half of the Valedictorians in<br/>
all the high schools in the state. (their scores were published in the<br/>
paper)<br/>
<br/>
How did he do that? I can&#39;t tell you, but he did play lots of games with<br/>
complicated rules, earned his own money, bought his own clothes and his own<br/>
computer with that money. He knew how to find out stuff by knowing how to<br/>
use the library...and its computers (catalog)<br/>
<br/>
This boy, in fact, never looked at any school books as he grew up. He got<br/>
library books by the dozens on subjects that interested him (libraries<br/>
seldom carry school books -- reason: they&#39;re junky), he liked to go on trips<br/>
and was the navigator from an early age. He was completely in charge of his<br/>
own education from the time he came home after ten sessions of Montessori<br/>
and said he didn&#39;t want to go any more. While we surely made some<br/>
suggestions and found out things that were available to kids, such as the<br/>
local crafts center, he like being in charge of his learning.<br/>
<br/>
In June, he graduated from Hunter College in NYC, after living in his own<br/>
apartment for four years, taking the subway to classes etc. He spent the<br/>
four years on the dean&#39;s list and was Magna Cum Laude, a fraction of a point<br/>
from Summa, but not too shabby. Several of the top students were<br/>
homeschoolers, as we&#39;ve come to expect.<br/>
<br/>
In college, with no math &quot;to speak of&quot; he took a review course in freshman<br/>
year. Scored perfect, as usual. So he knows that math is there when he needs<br/>
it, and he also knows that the basics are all totally obvious and easy. (we<br/>
don&#39;t need endless reviews and/or testing or what we learned cold in second<br/>
grade, but that&#39;s one way that schools waste our lives.<br/>
<br/>
I just got off the phone with a woman in CT who called for the first time.<br/>
Her daughter is 13 and enrolled in the local community college. Another girl<br/>
I know entered a cc in CT at age 11 and is now a junior at 14.<br/>
<br/>
The message is: Learning is easy. Get on with it. It doesn&#39;t even need a<br/>
name, like &quot;math.&quot; It&#39;s distance, weight, area. etc. Those don&#39;t threaten<br/>
people until we say they&#39;re MATH. Then, some kids freeze.<br/>
<br/>
For the real list of the uses of math, please go to an article that Luz<br/>
wrote, called &quot;A Few Words About Math&quot;  at www.borntoexplore.org/unschool<br/>
you&#39;ll like it, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
