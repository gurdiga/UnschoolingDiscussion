<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Apparently I&#39;m having a stupid day because I don&#39;t understand this either.  <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; cook for my child every single day of her life, it&#39;s not something that she <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; would ask me to do or not do, it&#39;s how life goes around here. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So even in feeding our children we should  wait to see if they are <br/>
&gt; interested <br/>
&gt; before we cook a meal for them?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Apparently this unschooling lifestyle is so far over my head it is going to <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; be unattainable for me, I simply do not get that even the simplest of <br/>
&gt; life&#39;s <br/>
&gt; existence&#39;s has to be validated by one&#39;s child in order to be valued or <br/>
&gt; right.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, IF she somehow had no interest in supper for example and I had prepared <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the meal with love it&#39;s still wrong because she specifically did not ask me <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to prepare her supper?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What about replacing the toilet paper?  You think that&#39;s crazy right?  <br/>
&gt; EVERYTHING I do, I think of my family and how it will bless them or make <br/>
&gt; their lives happy, EVEN making sure I buy the brand of toilet tissue they <br/>
&gt; like and EVEN making sure it&#39;s replaced because I know they dislike finding <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; out at inopportune times that the roll is empty.  I don&#39;t think about these <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; things, I just do them, no one asks me to make the meals or do the shopping <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; or laundry or any of the things that I do for my children.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know that one child likes a particular scent of snuggle sheets while <br/>
&gt; another really likes her sheets sprayed with linen spray before she goes to <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; bed.  Just because they don&#39;t ask with each load of laundry or each night <br/>
&gt; before they go to bed does it make it wrong that I do it for them?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lord I think I need a chart, maybe they can start indicating daily which <br/>
&gt; things that I should/can do for them that day that won&#39;t be an imposition.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am soooooo confused...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Preparing a special meal out of love is for ME and not them... I&#39;ll keep <br/>
&gt; repeating this to myself hoping it will sink in.  Unless they ASK it is for <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ME not them... mumbling and repeating and trying to understand...<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Glena, this post kind of summed up to me why you seemed to be missing what <br/>
people are trying to tell you. And I really do believe it&#39;s just a matter of <br/>
that one little spark of &quot;getting it&quot; that hasn&#39;t happened yet, rather than <br/>
your not WANTING to get it.<br/>
<br/>
The best way in the world to unschool, that I have seen, is to live your life <br/>
beside your children and to support them in living their own. Someone <br/>
mentioned that it was unlikely that if Tiger Woods had kids that they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t more or less have golf in their blood. They might not be champions, <br/>
or even like it much....but being around someone who had a passion for it, <br/>
being part the culture of tournaments, etc...the child would Get Golf. <br/>
Likewise, lots of children of musicians become musicians, because music is <br/>
just a part of what they live with.<br/>
<br/>
I think to unschool effectively means that we parents have to have lives and <br/>
interests. We have to have a passion for learning stuff, to like to do stuff. <br/>
We CAN&#39;T just do it for the kids. Then it becomes a sacrifice, which IS about <br/>
us. Kids don&#39;t want us to sacrifice ourselves...that&#39;s leads to guilt. <br/>
<br/>
My parents did not homeschool me (although my mom said it was too bad they <br/>
didn&#39;t know about that, because it would have been perfect for me), but in <br/>
their own way, they did kind of unschool us. They had interesting lives, and <br/>
we were always welcome to be there. If they had interesting folks over to <br/>
visit, we were never sent to our rooms -- we were welcomed into the <br/>
conversation. <br/>
<br/>
When we had interests, we were always encouraged and supported in them, and <br/>
never told it was silly or impossible.<br/>
<br/>
So, reading the above... I was a bit baffled. Sure, there&#39;s nothing wrong <br/>
with buying the brand of toilet paper your family likes -- but why are you <br/>
the only one who replaces the roll? (I can&#39;t remember how old your kids are, <br/>
but if there&#39;s a concern about algebra and med school, I assume they&#39;re not <br/>
3). If your child likes her linens sprayed with linen spray, why isn&#39;t it <br/>
next to her bed for HER to do it?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that it isn&#39;t fine for you to have a couple of &quot;Lovey Nurturey&quot; <br/>
things you do for your family, but the impression I get is that these are <br/>
just the tip of the iceberg. I think the first thing you need to do is to Get <br/>
a Life.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean that in a mean, nasty way. I mean that to model to kids that <br/>
there&#39;s a cool world of stuff to learn and experience, we need to DO it. What <br/>
have YOU always wanted to learn or do?  What are YOUR dreams?  Someone here <br/>
mentioned that she&#39;d love to live in Alaska, but it just isn&#39;t in the cards <br/>
for her family right now. But I bet she reads about it, watches <br/>
documentaries, and spend lots of time planning her next trips there. Her kids <br/>
may never care about Alaska, but they&#39;ll see that Mom is a person with her <br/>
own dreams, and see how she gets tastes of Alaska in her life. They&#39;ll learn <br/>
how to apply that to their own lives.<br/>
<br/>
So, I think maybe you DO need to do stuff that&#39;s about YOU, but not having to <br/>
do with your kids. Most of us, particularly early in unschooling, have had <br/>
those panicked moments where we blow it. This is scary stuff!  So we <br/>
apologize and move on. She may never like algebra. If she really wants to get <br/>
to Med School, and it&#39;s a real dream for her, she&#39;ll figure out what she <br/>
needs to get there and do it. <br/>
<br/>
My favorite unschooling book isn&#39;t about unschooling or even parenting at <br/>
all. It&#39;s called Wishcraft: How to Get What You Really Want, by Barbara Sher. <br/>
I believe if we all just raised our kids that way everyone would be happier.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243500742">I thought this was an excellent post.  So often, I feel guilty doing <br/>
things for myself.  Between the kids, house, bills, errands and <br/>
working at home there is always this overwhelming feeling looming.  <br/>
When I do something for myself, I always feel I am justifying it. &quot;Do <br/>
I want to start that book, because that is it for the day, nothing <br/>
else will get done?&quot; sort of feeling.   I do make an effort to do <br/>
things and I say NO when need be.  What a great reminder that it is <br/>
not only okay to sit and read a book but it is part of unschooling <br/>
yourself and your children!  I really needed to hear that!<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think it relates to what Sandra said in a previous post in <br/>
response to if we live a dull life will we hinder our children.  You <br/>
know, at first I thought &quot;Oh GOd, am I doing enough&quot;.  Then I <br/>
reflected and thought yeah!  Me and hubby live a different life from <br/>
most of our friends and make different, thoughtful choices.  We try <br/>
things and I think although we don&#39;t discuss all of it directly with <br/>
our kids, they surround us and &quot;hear&quot; it.  <br/>
<br/>
I never realized that some of the best unschooling I could give my <br/>
kids was to make better choices and live a more profound life <br/>
myself!  Thanks to both of you for some excellent food for thought!!<br/>
