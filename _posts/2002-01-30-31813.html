Childhood Rearing Daniel Greenberg <br/>

Chapter 9 <br/>
<br/>
Ages Four and Up <br/>
<br/>
By age four or thereabouts, human beings have a fully developed <br/>
communication system which, for all intents and purposes, makes them <br/>
mature persons. They are capable of expressing themselves, of <br/>
understanding what&#39;s said to them, and of structuring continuous thought; <br/>
and they are capable of doing things with their environment. You could <br/>
ask whether a person age four and up belongs at all in a book on <br/>
childrearing, because I don&#39;t consider someone over that age to be a <br/>
child. To a certain extent the subject doesn&#39;t belong here, and yet <br/>
society considers people to be children until a much older age than four, <br/>
and so we have to discuss this largely because society forces it on us. I <br/>
want to explain what I mean by a person over four being mature. The key <br/>
element of maturity is judgment. At around four, people have at their <br/>
disposal a fully developed sense of how to go about solving problems and <br/>
how to go about making decisions; they have a sense of what they know and <br/>
what they don&#39;t know, what kind of information they need to solve <br/>
problems, and when they are out of their depth. This is very hard for <br/>
people in our culture to believe about children. For some reason, most <br/>
people think that judgment is developed much later. They aren&#39;t able to <br/>
pinpoint exactly when --some say 13, others 16, others 18, or 21. I do <br/>
not see any significant change that takes place after age four or so. <br/>
When I look at a four or five or six year old making decisions, I see all <br/>
the components of the judgment process that I see in a person aged forty. <br/>
The process is the same, acompletely mature one, weighing the questions <br/>
and the available information and the previous life experience. What does <br/>
change with age is that a person gains knowledge and learning and life <br/>
experience that can be called upon in making judgments. But I think you <br/>
have to remember that this is a very qualitative process which goes on at <br/>
all ages. A person aged fifty can have just as many difficulties solving <br/>
a problem as a person aged five. A person aged fifty confronted with a <br/>
new situation can feel just as helpless as a child. We have phrases for <br/>
this in our language; we talk about older people confronted with <br/>
difficult situations and refer to them as being &quot;like children.&quot; <br/>
Actually, the language reflects society&#39;s prejudices. What we really mean <br/>
is that this is something common to any age when people are confronted <br/>
with new situations, recognize their limitations, and don&#39;t have the <br/>
adequate data at hand. Our prejudice is that we expect a fifty year old, <br/>
confronted with the need to make hard decisions, to go about making these <br/>
decisions in a certain way, and what we don&#39;t recognize adequately about <br/>
four year olds is that they do exactly the same thing. There are <br/>
doubtless a greater number of areas in which four or five or six year <br/>
olds are inexperienced, and so they may need more help. But even that&#39;s <br/>
an argument you have to be very careful about, because there is a kind of <br/>
feedback mechanism here. Four and five and six year olds don&#39;t get into <br/>
all that many situations which they find to be over their heads. As they <br/>
grow older, they get into more and more complex situations, usually <br/>
refraining from going in too deep. It&#39;s something you see at all levels <br/>
of maturity. People always meet with new challenges, but they generally <br/>
recognize their limitations and try not to go in over their heads. So <br/>
when all is said and done, the decision-making processes of a five year <br/>
old and a fifty year old are quite similar. In both cases the people <br/>
involved in the process can be faced with the need for new data, realize <br/>
their limitations, and be stuck. It isn&#39;t just children who are stuck and <br/>
inexperienced; anybody can be, when confronted with a situation that is <br/>
strange to them. Another characteristic, other than judgment, which is <br/>
often used to distinguish five year olds from fifty year olds, is <br/>
learning. We often hear it said that &quot;children still have a lot to <br/>
learn.&quot; On the other hand, we have the opposite attitude toward older <br/>
people, who are held to be virtually incapable of learning; &quot;you can&#39;t <br/>
teach an old horse new tricks.&quot; Actually, the human being is a learning <br/>
animal throughout life, from the moment of birth until the moment of <br/>
death; indeed, when a human being has stopped learning, he is essentially <br/>
dead. As long as there is any brain activity, learning is possible -- <br/>
which is probably true of lower animals as well. So to say that having a <br/>
lot to learn is something that distinguishes younger people from older <br/>
people just isn&#39;t founded on any reasonable view of human nature that I <br/>
can think of. Another distinction that people try to draw between young <br/>
people and older people is that between dependence and independence. <br/>
People tell their young children that they are terribly dependent, and <br/>
you often hear a parent say, &quot;As long as I have to take care of this and <br/>
that, you&#39;re going to have to do what I ask, and when you&#39;re older and <br/>
independent, you can do what you please.&quot; Whereas our picture of adults <br/>
is that they are independent people. Again, I find this to be a very <br/>
misleading distinction. If we think about it, we realize that adults too <br/>
can be very dependent, for example, on their spouses or close friends. <br/>
They depend on other persons for help, or to come through in times of <br/>
crisis. We have ways of expressing this, such as &quot;It&#39;s good to have <br/>
friends you can count on.&quot; What we&#39;re really saying is, that for all our <br/>
independence, a large part of us is still dependent upon friendship. In a <br/>
much deeper sense, modern society is particularly interdependent in a lot <br/>
of ways --economically, socially, ecologically. Even the people who <br/>
advocate a return to nature often find themselves in an ironic dependency <br/>
upon the rest of civilization to bail them out in a pinch. You can think <br/>
of any number of examples. It&#39;s almost impossible to be in a position in <br/>
which you are independent from the rest of society. So I think that <br/>
people like to fool themselves a bit as far as this is concerned, <br/>
especially when they talk to children. When adults talk among themselves, <br/>
they fully realize that they are dependent upon each other and the rest <br/>
of society, but the big stress on independence usually shows when they <br/>
are talking to children. You can even compare the way parents talk to <br/>
their children with the way they talk with each other. It&#39;s rare that a <br/>
husband and wife will invoke their dependence in arguments. It&#39;s just not <br/>
a usual adult frame of reference, even though they may be terribly <br/>
dependent upon each other. But when children and parents argue about <br/>
their differences, time and again, one of the first things that comes <br/>
into the argument is &quot;so long as you&#39;re dependent upon me, you&#39;ve got to <br/>
do it my way.&quot; I think it is interesting to see this double standard <br/>
invoked to keep children in line. The other part of what I want to say is <br/>
that children four, five and six years old -- let alone older children -- <br/>
are a lot more independent than we give them credit for. They are quite <br/>
capable of thinking for themselves and understanding what is going on. In <br/>
every sense, they have minds of their own. To me it is amazing how often <br/>
adults do not consider children to be real people. The weirdest things <br/>
happen. Adults often act in the presence of children as if they were not <br/>
there, like non-entities. Things are often said and done in front of them <br/>
as if they were part of the furniture. For example, there are many <br/>
classic stories of doctors discussing cases in front of children who are <br/>
patients as if the children were not lying there in full view, something <br/>
the same doctors would not dream of doing in front of adults. Another <br/>
category that is often used to distinguish children from adults is play. <br/>
People say, &quot;children prefer to play a lot, and are not serious about <br/>
life.&quot; Whereas adults supposedly do serious things. Indeed, adults are <br/>
careful to label their play, so that when they decide to play, they can <br/>
announce the fact, in order to separate the occasion from the rest of the <br/>
time when they are being very serious. I think that there&#39;s a lot to be <br/>
said on this subject. Perhaps the best place to begin is with the <br/>
observation that, in less inhibited surroundings (i.e., <br/>
non-starched-shirt surroundings), frolic and play is something that <br/>
people engage in at all ages. For example, anthropologists frequently <br/>
comment on the play they observe in so-called &quot;primitive&quot; tribes among <br/>
adults. Of course, this is always called &quot;child-like play&quot; -- another <br/>
instance of our language clearly reflecting our preconceived notions -- <br/>
but the fact remains that mature people like to play. And the main reason <br/>
for this is that play is a creative, natural kind of activity for an <br/>
associative, curious, probing mind. Sad to say, our society reveals <br/>
itself in this area too. We are so hung up on programming adults into <br/>
well-defined, set activities and fixed routines that we tend to squelch <br/>
play in grown-ups. It&#39;s not because of their age, but because of the <br/>
roles they have to assume in Western industrial culture. Often, you hear <br/>
a person say about someone else he has known professionally for years, <br/>
and he has happened to be with on a vacation: &quot;I didn&#39;t realize that this <br/>
person was so much fun, that he had such a light side to him.&quot; We are <br/>
always amazed to observe in others what is really a natural <br/>
characteristic of people of all ages, but is repressed in the daily lives <br/>
of most people in our society. In summary, many of the differences which <br/>
society claims to exist between children and adults don&#39;t really exist. <br/>
People aged four or so and up all have judgment, they all learn, they are <br/>
all both dependent and independent in various ways, they all play, etc. I <br/>
don&#39;t see any grounds for distinguishing in a qualitative manner between <br/>
a person age four, five, or six and a person aged twenty or thirty. At <br/>
about four, a person&#39;s body and mind have reached functional maturity, <br/>
and from then on they accumulate a storehouse of experience and knowledge <br/>
as they proceed along their unique path in life. Which all boils down to <br/>
saying a very simple thing: that as far as we are concerned, as soon as <br/>
children have reached four or so, they have to be treated like you treat <br/>
any other person whom you consider an adult. Now, you have to be careful <br/>
not to draw the wrong implications from this conclusion. Thus, it would <br/>
be catastrophic to deny children what is due them. All people, regardless <br/>
of age, have needs which should not be overlooked. For example, all <br/>
people have the need for affection. It&#39;s not the case that you have to <br/>
give a lot of affection to a four or five year old, but when a person <br/>
turns twenty, you can turn cold. Affection is necessary for human being <br/>
all through life. So are love, warmth, and physical contact. We accept <br/>
these needs in an infant, but we sort of tail off later on in life, <br/>
although they are as vital to an adult as to a child aged four. The <br/>
question we have to address at this point is, &quot;How did this <br/>
differentiation between ages happen in Western culture?&quot; This question <br/>
turns out to be related to another, namely, &quot;Why do we consider <br/>
adolescence to occur at such a late age in Western culture, at puberty?&quot; <br/>
The answer in both cases lies in the nature of Western civilization and <br/>
its industrialized technological society. There are many aspects to the <br/>
answer and I just want to highlight a few of them in order to present the <br/>
gist of the argument. One thing that has happened is that the average <br/>
human life span has increased fantastically so that people live almost <br/>
three times as long as they used to live up to a relatively short time <br/>
ago. The resulting population explosion has led to enormously complex <br/>
problems in simply providing for all these people. One technique for <br/>
managing the situation is reducing job competition by lopping off both <br/>
ends of the manpower spectrum. On the one hand you introduce a retirement <br/>
age to get rid of older workers (although it is inherently ridiculous to <br/>
associate a chronological age with the need to stop working). This has <br/>
endowed us with a society full of people who are in their sixties, <br/>
seventies, and older, who are capable of doing productive work and <br/>
deriving satisfaction from it, but who are forced to retire and face the <br/>
tedium of enforced idleness. That is how we lop off one end of the <br/>
spectrum. Then we say further that a person can&#39;t enter the job market <br/>
until at least fourteen years of age, preferably eighteen or older, with <br/>
the preferred age of entry going up as the population increases. A <br/>
hundred years ago people in large numbers began work at age eight or <br/>
nine. It is often said that the age was pushed upward out of compassion <br/>
for children. While this undoubtedly was a factor, I think the major <br/>
reason children were removed from the job market was to keep them from <br/>
competing with grownups. There just weren&#39;t enough jobs to go around, and <br/>
one way to handle it was to pass child labor laws. The end result of <br/>
getting the old and the young out of the job competition has been to <br/>
introduce monumental problems of old age and of youth in our society <br/>
because of the large numbers of able persons who have been deprived of a <br/>
productive function in their lives. Another aspect of late adolescence <br/>
stems from the fact that an industrialized society, of the kind that we <br/>
have had over the last century, needs highly trained robot-like people to <br/>
fit into certain places in the economy. This takes time and effort. To <br/>
take a human being and turn him into a robot is something that you can&#39;t <br/>
do overnight, and it is very different from training a person to a <br/>
responsible role. In the old days, children started apprenticing <br/>
themselves when they were still quite young; it was fairly common to see <br/>
four and five year olds standing around a smithy or a weaving shop or <br/>
whatever and learning the intricate tricks of the trade. Indeed, even <br/>
toddlers are capable of absorbing minute details of the procedures taking <br/>
place in the home - even intricate ones like how to cook, how to clean, <br/>
etc. It is a mistake (that I have already discussed) to think that little <br/>
children cannot be useful in complex situations. They can be. It is not <br/>
the complexity that we are talking about at all. From the dawn of man <br/>
little children found ways to ease themselves into complex situations <br/>
gradually. Even in the most complex industrial society children aged four <br/>
and up can have a vital role, can find a place of interest where they can <br/>
observe and slowly master all the intricacies. It is the need to turn <br/>
them into robots that takes time. It takes years to do that. There is a <br/>
strong correlation between the degree of technological advancement and <br/>
the length of time it takes. For example, consider science. Today, the <br/>
average Ph.D in science is an uncreative robot drone who still has to go <br/>
out and become a post-doctoral appointee for several years under somebody <br/>
else&#39;s guidance. Usually, he doesn&#39;t begin to do his own work until he is <br/>
in his thirties. That&#39;s the norm in science, a highly advanced field. Why <br/>
is this the case, when a generation or two ago the norm was that people <br/>
in their early twenties were doing creative work? The answer is that in <br/>
earlier times there were fewer scientists. There was a small group, so <br/>
everyone could relax, and there was no pressure to force scientists into <br/>
a mold. Today there is a tremendous amount of competition, and a highly <br/>
routinized set of tasks for scientists to perform. It is necessary <br/>
nowadays to prepare them for this and for that - to prepare so many solid <br/>
state physicists to service industries, and to prepare so many biologists <br/>
to fight disease, etc. Science is a completely different enterprise than <br/>
it used to be, and if you just let everybody do what they want, if you <br/>
would give them the same freedom that they used to enjoy, most of them <br/>
would be doing things that society didn&#39;t particularly want them to do. <br/>
So society puts tremendous pressure on developing scientists to keep them <br/>
in line, and the longer they are kept in line, the less likelihood there <br/>
is that at the end of their long training they will still be independent <br/>
and creative enough to break out of their pre-set mold, and the more <br/>
society will be able to rely on them to stay in a rut the rest of their <br/>
lives. What I have said about science holds in general: the more complex <br/>
the society gets, and the more options that are open, the harder it is to <br/>
mold young people into set patterns, and hence the longer it is necessary <br/>
to keep them as robots, even up to an age that is way beyond what anybody <br/>
considers childhood. The question that I had set out to answer was, &quot;Why <br/>
do we have adolescence in our society through puberty and beyond?&quot; In <br/>
brief, the answer is that over the years society has required more and <br/>
more time to break people in for robot-like roles, and therefore there is <br/>
a delay in the period when the kinds of things associated with <br/>
adolescence take place - the kinds of phenomena discussed in the last <br/>
chapter, having to do with the transition from a state of dependence to a <br/>
state of independence. A science post-doc goes through a period of <br/>
adolescence at age thirty. Most people in our society go through their <br/>
major adolescence in their late teens (rather than between one and four, <br/>
when it would be normal), but they go through it again whenever they make <br/>
a transition from a state of total dependence to a state of <br/>
semi-independence, with all the attendant break-downs and rebellions and <br/>
resentments. I think that in the kind of society that I have been <br/>
advocating there won&#39;t be the phenomenon of teenage adolescence at all. <br/>
Rather, all there will be is the kind of adolescence that I talked about <br/>
earlier, between ages one and four, where the really significant life <br/>
changes take place on the road to personal independence. But this can <br/>
only happen in a society which has no need for the kind of robot-like <br/>
training that now takes place. I want to say a few final words about the <br/>
role of a person age four and up in the family. I&#39;ve assumed that a child <br/>
up to age four is the object of care and attention, as is due to a <br/>
developing member of the family. It seems to me fairly obvious that once <br/>
children have reached the age of four or five they become adults to all <br/>
intents and purposes and can take a full role in the family, a full share <br/>
of the family responsibilities. Now what their share will be depends on <br/>
any given family, but they have every right and expectation to be treated <br/>
just like everybody else. That means, on the one hand, they have got to <br/>
carry their weight and find ways to contribute to doing the family <br/>
chores, and on the other hand they have got to be given all the <br/>
consideration that all the other members of the family are given in <br/>
serious decision making. The part about carrying their weight is not <br/>
really very difficult to conceive, because in rural families and in other <br/>
cultures this takes place all the time. It is fairly common that youths <br/>
age five or six draw the water and feed the animals and milk the cows. <br/>
There is absolutely no reason why they can&#39;t do normal things about the <br/>
house; it doesn&#39;t mean they have to be able to do everything. It doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean they have to be able to cook, for example, - after all, in most <br/>
families not all the adults can cook. Nobody says that all members of a <br/>
family have to be interchangeable parts. But it is clear to me that once <br/>
children have reached the age of judgment, there has to be some way for <br/>
them to carry their weight. The other side of that coin is something that <br/>
is harder to conceive in our society - namely, that the same child has to <br/>
have a full voice in the decision making in the family. That is extremely <br/>
difficult to carry out in our male-dominated patriarchal society where <br/>
usually the only person who really makes decisions in the family is the <br/>
father, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred he doesn&#39;t even consider <br/>
the opinion of his wife, let alone his children. Even in families where <br/>
both spouses share decision making, it is very rare to find the children <br/>
consulted on major decisions. I find this state of affairs to be a <br/>
complete anachronism and I do not see how it can maintain itself much <br/>
longer. Another consequence of this view is that children in principle <br/>
ought to have the same mobility that the adult members of the family <br/>
have. We restrict the mobility of children all the time in our society. <br/>
The idea that children can regulate their time and their mobility like <br/>
adults is one that we are going to have to learn to accept. I think that <br/>
the realization that children are full-fledged members of the family is <br/>
going to come soon after the realization that the woman is a full-fledged <br/>
member of the family. In this respect, women are going to do a lot of the <br/>
work for children. The major thing to break is the adult male dominance <br/>
in the home. To be sure, once you break that, it doesn&#39;t automatically <br/>
follow that children are going to get a full share, but at least it is <br/>
going to be a lot easier for other legitimate contenders to stake their <br/>
claims. I think we will see more and more families in which the adults <br/>
have equal voices in decision making, and we will see many such families <br/>
accommodate themselves in giving the children a full voice in family <br/>
affairs more frequently than families in which the male is supreme. In a <br/>
sense this has been an anomalous chapter in a book on childrearing, with <br/>
the message that from about age four and up you have simply got to treat <br/>
children as adults and stop treating them as &quot;children.&quot; There should be <br/>
no distinction between your fundamental attitude toward a family member <br/>
five years old and toward one thirty five years old.</div>
