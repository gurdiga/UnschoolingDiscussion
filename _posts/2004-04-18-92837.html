&lt;&lt; why is <br/>
<br/>
water wet?&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He might or might not be interested, butthe history of &quot;water&quot; and &quot;wet&quot; and <br/>
&quot;winter all go back to prehistoric times,  maybe six or seven thousand years, <br/>
to the time of whoever it was spoke the language linguists call <br/>
&quot;proto-Indo-European.&quot;   Other languages descended from that also have various words for <br/>
wetness or water which have as their mid-base a sound like<br/>
<br/>
oowaa<br/>
<br/>
Kind of like the chorus of &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;:  OOOwa, ooowah...<br/>
<br/>
Spanish word for water?<br/>
<br/>
Agua. <br/>
Pronunciation?<br/>
awWa<br/>
(kinda &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
So our word &quot;wet&quot; means &quot;watery&quot; in a way.  <br/>
<br/>
And (another mystery solved) the reason in phonics discussions teachers say <br/>
(of vowels) &quot;and sometimes y and w&quot; is that &quot;w&quot; is the sound &quot;oowah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Huh.  I wonder if it&#39;s a picture of water!!<br/>
