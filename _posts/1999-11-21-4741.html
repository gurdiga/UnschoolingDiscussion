<div id="ygrps-yiv-70759947">Lucy, I know I&#39;m behind here, but I know EXACTLY what you mean!  On a<br/>
different issue, I have read the books by Adele Faber and Eileen Mazlish,<br/>
and while they are, in their way, &#39;how-to&#39; books, they do dwell more on<br/>
changing the way we deal with things to reflect the respect and love we feel<br/>
for our children, than changing our children.  While reading such a book may<br/>
not change someone&#39;s idea about how they see their children, for those who<br/>
already know that they are not comfortable with the way their parents dealt<br/>
with things they do present an alternative way of behaving, and as Joel<br/>
says, this would not work (much like dieting!) if it&#39;s not believed in.<br/>
<br/>
My nearest LLL group has been a source of such people, but it&#39;s a long way<br/>
from me, and I haven&#39;t formed &#39;drop-in&#39; relationships with anyone else who<br/>
believes the things I do and makes an effort to do something about them.<br/>
Since September, my children have spent increasing amounts of time with my<br/>
mother, m-i-l and dh, and it&#39;s showing in their behaviour and what they say,<br/>
like labelling themselves as &#39;good&#39; or &#39;naughty.&#39;  I&#39;m considering<br/>
&#39;accidentally&#39; leaving some suitable literature at my mother&#39;s, see if it<br/>
makes a breakthrough!  My role models are Mother Bear from Little Bear, and<br/>
the &#39;factional&#39; mother in the Faber and Mazlish books, and I try to<br/>
introduce others to my path, in hope of having a travelling companion!  Like<br/>
you, Lucy, I keep this list for this reason as well as the intersesting<br/>
debates!  I&#39;m also on a couple of other lists where I follow some and seem<br/>
to lead others, which is just as it should be!  (anyone who&#39;s also on those<br/>
lists, I hope that doesn&#39;t sound pompous!)<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck in finding a real-live role model, and keep heart by knowing<br/>
that we can become those role-models for other mothers, and our own<br/>
children.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I believe that it is so much better to treat children with respect and<br/>
&gt; care, to take the time to talk out a situation with them rather than just<br/>
&gt; using quick penalties/punishments, etc.  However one of the things that I<br/>
&gt; find hardest is that I don&#39;t know where to see that kind of<br/>
&gt; parenting/treatment of children modeled.  I believe in it but I feel like<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s so hard to live up to my ideals because I wasn&#39;t raised that way and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744782008">Tracy,<br/>
    I&#39;ve never read books by Adele Faber or Eileen Mazlish but they sound <br/>
like something I would like and benefit from.  I understand what you mean <br/>
when you say that they won&#39;t change someone who feels very differently but <br/>
they can help a person put into practice the ideals they have.  <br/>
   Family members and old friends who believe differently and treat our kids <br/>
differently can be trying.  I am always torn between getting involved and <br/>
listening quietly while my children handle situations themselves.  My <br/>
instinct is to jump in and say something but sometimes I stop myself because <br/>
my kids are pretty adept at presenting their sides of things (or at least the <br/>
older ones are) and so I think that maybe I&#39;m being overly protective.  But <br/>
it does make it hard.  If I do say something, even though it is tactful, it <br/>
seems like there is this awkward tension.<br/>
   I think being a role model for others would be such a meaningful <br/>
contribution and I guess that&#39;s another reason why I want to feel like I&#39;m <br/>
moving beyond the &quot;how can I really be this way&quot; stage.  But the biggest <br/>
reason is just to feel like I&#39;m giving my kids this solid foundation to draw <br/>
upon through their lives and so that they can be this way with their kids and <br/>
have it come much more naturally (role modeling again).<br/>
   Thanks for your thoughts and for the author recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
