<div id="ygrps-yiv-167282855">If there&#39;s a map of where unschoolers are, would it be people from this list? <br/>
 Some lurk and don&#39;t post.<br/>
People who went to last year&#39;s conference or might go next year?<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to mark a real map at home, even then who would you mark?<br/>
<br/>
And it would need to be a world map, if it&#39;s this list, but would you take <br/>
the pin off if the mom dropped off the list or the kids went to school?<br/>
<br/>
Too much work for my tastes.  Too complicated.    I&#39;m just interested in the <br/>
ideas without regard to where they come from.<br/>
