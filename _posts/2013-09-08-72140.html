<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243"><blockquote><span title="ireply"><html><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474"><div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474yui_3_7_2_61_1378645566324_35">&gt;&gt;&gt;Sigh.....thanks all for taking the time to share your thoughts and ideas. Unfortunately, none of them seem to pertain to me, my kids or our situation at all. I really appreciate that this is a list for bouncing ideas, so bounce away &lt;&lt;&lt;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474yui_3_7_2_61_1378645566324_59">&nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474yui_3_7_2_61_1378645566324_60">I first joined this list about 2 years ago and posted a question, got a lot of feedback and had the exact same reaction. I felt completely misunderstood, felt that people read things into my posts and above all, I felt
 </div></div></div></div></div></html></span></blockquote> they&nbsp;weren&#39;t adressing *my* situation at all. I kept saying &quot;but you don&#39;t understand&quot; - which only added to the confusion and at one point when Sandra wrote that I was making it all about me instead of about the
 principles of peaceful parenting, I got offended and left in a huff...<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474yui_3_7_2_61_1378645566324_77">&nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474yui_3_7_2_61_1378645566324_85">It took me a long time to &quot;get&quot; the idea of concrete questions and situations being used as springboards for discussion of principles that are generally applicable. It took me a long time to understand that it wasn&#39;t *me* that was being &quot;burned at the unschooling stake&quot;&nbsp;but rather that someone was responding to&nbsp;thoughts that came up from what I had written or from the subsequent exchange, and that those ideas being presented&nbsp;could possibly, likely be pertaining to&nbsp;SOMEONE, now or later. It wasn&#39;t about *me* precisely ;-)</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474yui_3_7_2_61_1378645566324_87">&nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474yui_3_7_2_61_1378645566324_88">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The following paragraph is addressed to me, as witnessed by the use of &quot;you,&quot; &nbsp;as
 were most of the others. So I&#39;m confused as to why
 it would be stated that they are not addressed to me...&lt;&lt;&lt;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474yui_3_7_2_61_1378645566324_84">&nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474yui_3_7_2_61_1378645566324_85">I think what&#39;s hard to understand with this list, is that once you&#39;ve posted an idea (a question, a situation...) it&#39;s no longer yours. People will respond to ideas directly or indirectly launched by the OP - extrapolate and talk about it in a general way, the you not always being &quot;you-the-original-poster&quot; but <var id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474yui-ie-cursor"></var>you, we, someone - a parent. This is in any case how I understand it now, and I am getting so much more from the discussion this way.</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474yui_3_7_2_61_1378645566324_112">&nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474yui_3_7_2_61_1378645566324_113">Mette</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474yui_3_7_2_61_1378645566324_64">&nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474yui_3_7_2_61_1378645566324_65">&nbsp;</div><div
