&gt; Never think, for a moment, that you are anything if not successful. You are <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; hell of a woman. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Janis, thank you, but think of it, really.  How far will this &quot;success&quot; go <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; the REAL world (by which I mean at a high school reunion)??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m well thought of by some over-protective parents whose kids can&#39;t cut it <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; in school.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m popular among some homeschoolers who can&#39;t even get it together to use <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; curriculum right.<br/>
&gt; They will just shake their heads at my delusions of reality. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

invited to speak as keynote at conferences in the U.S. and Canada. <br/>
<br/>
I mean...that&#39;s really a big deal.<br/>

It is pretty wonderful to get to go to conferences.  And I&#39;m grateful and I <br/>
enjoy it.  And my 4th grade teacher has followed my progress and SHE <br/>
appreciates it.  SO there.  Maybe she&#39;ll go with me to my next reunion.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Expert&quot; is not a word to be used, I think.  I&#39;m experienced, though.  <br/>

**you have a reputation (some<br/>
 might even say notoriety!) in your field.  You&#39;re an expert -- you know<br/>
 stuff!**<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Kathryn ,  come on Sandra!<br/>
<br/>
Did you know that you&#39;ve even crossed over to another plane?<br/>
<br/>
You are now an adjective!  &lt;g&gt; Someone on my Minnesota list said  &quot;I know<br/>
its not very Sandra Doddish&quot; .   Cool!<br/>
<br/>
Your hard work really does show itself.   Although you might not always know<br/>
how far it is reaching.<br/>
