<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983789657">I have never in my life seen such breast beating and teeth gnashing over two<br/>
little words - fall behind.  I&#39;m sorry I posted to the list.  I was<br/>
attempting to offer comfort to someone who had similar experience to my own.<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry I joined the list.  I was attempting to find support.  I will<br/>
unsub because my time is too limited and my  health too poor to spend so much<br/>
time reading so many emails that are little more than arguing and<br/>
pontificating.  I sincerely hope that the nastiness over what I quite<br/>
innocently posted (I didn&#39;t realize you had to read and re-read your posts<br/>
for any nuances that might offend and send people into a tizzy) will stop<br/>
with my exit.<br/>
<br/>
Sincere best wishes to you all,<br/>
<br/>
Dawn</div>
