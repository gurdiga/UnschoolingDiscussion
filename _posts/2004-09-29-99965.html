I just was IMing with a friend in England yesterday morning and told her I <br/>
had just finished watching all the Black Adder episodes ever, on DVD, and was <br/>
now newly interested in Hugh Laurie, and should really find some Jeeves and <br/>
Wooster.  And yesterday afternoon I was gathering flower seeds and thinking I <br/>
should walk over to Hollywood Video and rent &quot;Peter&#39;s Friends,&quot; a Stephen Fry <br/>
movie (drama).  Now this.   And my friend will be here later this month.  Sheesh.  <br/>
 I could&#39;ve saved a lot of money and time not reading that recommendation, <br/>

good thing to be able to buy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506248358">Rick also did a comedy about being a politician. I can&#39;t remember what it was called but he played a conservative MP called Alan B&#39;Stard.<br/>

You seen Coupling yet? Very funny. Was on BBC America when I lived over there. And Red Dwarf.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, goodie- two more to check out.  Thanks!<br/>
Alan B&#39;Stard sounds just like those two guys. Also, because they had a clip<br/>
of Good Neighbors on  The Young Ones, we checked that one out as well.<br/>
 Always looking for new role models for the children.  I think we&#39;ve finally<br/>
seen all of the Simpsons reruns.<br/>
We&#39;re still wallowing in  Harry Potter, listening to the books on cd in a<br/>
continuous loop. We&#39;re at least thirty minutes drive-time from anything and<br/>
almost an hour from the nearest mall, so we&#39;re in the car A LOT. The kids<br/>
are picking up a lovely cockney (I think) accent from the guys on the night<br/>
bus, Ernie being one of them.<br/>
