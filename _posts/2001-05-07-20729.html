<div id="ygrps-yiv-272932235">Yes, under normal circumstances, breast milk is<br/>
designed for babies, and the female human breast is<br/>
designed to deliver that milk.  But for many reasons<br/>
some babies do not thrive on breast milk.  They may be<br/>
(as my son was) lactose intolerant *and* allergic to<br/>
milk.  Their mother may be eating something to which<br/>
they are allergic.  They may be severely hypoglycemic<br/>
(again, as my son was) and the milk simply doesn&#39;t<br/>
have enough sugars in it to keep them alive.  They may<br/>
be too weak to suck.  Their mothers may be unable, due<br/>
to stress, nutritional problems etc, to provide<br/>
sufficient breastmilk.  They may need a different<br/>
balance of nutrients for a variety of health reasons<br/>
than breast milk can provide.  They may be too<br/>
underdeveloped to process breastmilk.<br/>
<br/>
The majority of babies in the NICU my son was in could<br/>
not use breastmilk for one reason or another.  And<br/>
most babies will refuse the breast once they are<br/>
initiated on a bottle... the bottle provides faster<br/>
service with less work.  <br/>
<br/>
One may accurately say that the female human body was<br/>
designed to breastfeed, and that biologically and<br/>
otherwise *most* babies benefit from breast feeding. <br/>
But it is a sweeping generality to say that *all*<br/>
children benefit from breast feeding in infancy.  Some<br/>
babies would die or fail to thrive from breast<br/>
feeding, so it is not factually the case that all<br/>
children benefit from breast feeding in infancy.<br/>
<br/>
Need a lift back onto the soapbox?<br/>
