Waldorf/Steiner/anthroposophical medicine, it should be junked up front.<br/>

&quot;Anthroposophical physicians do not appear to conduct double-blind  <br/>
controlled experiments [9], so it is almost impossible to evaluate  <br/>
their success rates. &quot;<br/>

Perhaps TV is interfering with the developing organs of clairvoyance  <br/>
or something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-647905254">-=-So I would like to suggest that if ANY of the anti-TV stuff comes  <br/>

Quackery? -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Does that follow?<br/>
I didn&#39;t say anything on that site should be junked.<br/>
<br/>
IF (if) the &quot;scientific&quot; explanations of why young children shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
watch TV came from Steiner or Waldorf, then I think they should be  <br/>
disregarded as being part and parcel of Rudolf&#39;s visit to the fantasy  <br/>
realm.<br/>
<br/>
If that site puts up a page about unschooling and says its quackery,  <br/>
that wouldn&#39;t make me swallow my tail like a snake in a fable.<br/>
<br/>
Each person looks and thinks and makes connections.  I&#39;m connecting  <br/>
&quot;TV will hurt you&quot; with &quot;the heart doesn&#39;t pump blood&quot; and that the  <br/>
brain isn&#39;t the organ of thought.  Perhaps my connection is flawed.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe acupuncture and homeopathy are quackery; I don&#39;t know or care.<br/>
 From the point of view of many professional educators, unschooling is  <br/>
surely quackery.  I don&#39;t care about that either.<br/>
