<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146171943">Last weekend, as we were enjoying our last days at our neighborhood <br/>
pool, I had a chance to talk a little bit more with a woman we <br/>
usually just exchanged brief pleasantries with.  She&#39;s always seemed <br/>
really sweet, loaning goggles or swim noodles from her cabana to the <br/>
kids on occasion, but I had just never talked to her more than saying <br/>
hi, mostly because I&#39;m usually in the middle of some active game in <br/>
the shallow end of the pool.<br/>
<br/>
We started talking, and I think she asked where my children go to <br/>
school.  When I mentioned that we homeschool, she asked me &quot;Have you <br/>
ever heard of John Holt?&quot;  I have to admit, my jaw about dropped to <br/>
the ground then, because I really don&#39;t expect most people I meet to <br/>
be mentioning John Holt&#39;s name.<br/>
<br/>
I asked her if she knew him, and she said that she did.  She was <br/>
working in a local school district several decades ago, and there <br/>
were some firings of teachers, and he was called in to be an expert <br/>
witness regarding educational methods in a trial, and so she got a <br/>
chance to meet him, work with him on the testimony, hear about his <br/>
philosophies, and have books of his signed by him.<br/>
<br/>
She said that he changed her life, and that now, every year, she does <br/>
two things - she rereads How Children Learn and How Children Fail, <br/>
and she watches Harold and Maude.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought that it was really cool that somehow, of all the <br/>
people at the pool, we would connect with her, the one who had <br/>
actually met John Holt, and who would understand what we are doing.  <br/>
A unique coincidence, so I thought I would pass it on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-207069223">WOW! What are the chances of that happening. Most<br/>
people have no clue about homeschooling. Very neat.<br/>
