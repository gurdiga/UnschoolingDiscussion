  ****White Oleander is one of The best books (novels that is) that I&#39;ve<br/>
  ever read.<br/>
  The author&#39;s vocabulary and style are one of a kind! Was excited when<br/>
  the<br/>
  movie came out even though I knew it would be much less than the book.<br/>
  The<br/>
  movie was terrible. Maybe I&#39;d have liked it better (though I don&#39;t think<br/>
  so)<br/>
  had I not read the book. I wasn&#39;t expecting it to match up, but it was<br/>
  ****way**** worse than not matching up.    Lara............. ****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Oh, bummer.  I read the book a few weeks ago and just rented the movie<br/>
  to watch tomorrow night.  Oh well, I&#39;ll watch it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
  I thought the new movie Holes was pretty true to the book, and the kids<br/>
  and I enjoyed both.<br/>
