<div id="ygrps-yiv-608439377">I am quite a good cook. I bake wonderful smelling, heavenly tasting breads, <br/>
cakes, and pies. I fix delicious, mouthwatering meals. No bragging, its the one <br/>
good *suzie homemaker* thing I do. Mostly my house is a cozy, cluttered, <br/>
needs to be dusted, maybe I should vacuum, boy it sure smells good in here, home. <br/>
Darin and the kids like to look through my cookbooks and ask; &quot;Could you make <br/>
this? Would you make that?&quot; and I do. (Darin has been known to ask for recipes <br/>
at restaurants, family reunions, homeschool group potlucks.) Not every day <br/>
mind you. Some days I loathe the sight of the kitchen. Some days it is nicer, <br/>
easier, just because no other reason, to go out to the local national chain <br/>
insert the name here restaurant. <br/>
<br/>
One day, despite my skills, despite the pride I take in placing nutritious, <br/>
sometimes well balanced, lovely tasting food in front of my family, Jack came <br/>
to me with a sad look on his face. He stammered, and hemmed and hawed. He said, <br/>
Mommy, ummm you know? Then stopped. Darin smiled, I smiled. We didn&#39;t know <br/>
what was going to come out of our little guy&#39;s mouth, but we knew it was <br/>
important by the look on his face. I told him to tell me, Darin asked if he was hurt. <br/>
So Jack took a deep breath, looked right at me and said that the meal I fixed <br/>
the night before (which is a family favorite and I fix often) makes him sick, <br/>
and he did not want to eat it any more. I asked how it made him sick, and he <br/>
said it makes him have to go to the bathroom a lot and makes his stomach ache. <br/>
By this time he was crying hard. He felt bad, he didn&#39;t want to hurt my <br/>
feelings, and he really hadn&#39;t wanted to tell me this. Darin looked at me and said; <br/>
&quot;You know, it took a lot out of him to come tell you this.&quot; I hugged Jack and <br/>
told him he didn&#39;t have to eat that meal ever again if he didn&#39;t want to, <br/>
that he could pick something else for me to fix him. <br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, I could have never, ever told my Mom what Jack told me. I <br/>
ate what she fixed and that was the end of it. I wanted guitar lessons when I <br/>
was about seven, by the third or fourth lesson, I hated the teacher and wanted <br/>
to quit. My parents let me, but never again did I ask for something without <br/>
hearing about how I had quit the guitar, how I would never amount to anything if <br/>
I quit everything, how much money was going to be spent and on and on. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how this fits with what everyone is talking about, but I think <br/>
somehow it does. Sometimes, we do have to do things we don&#39;t want to, that is <br/>
life. Like visiting Grandma, who has a smelly house and five too many cats, and <br/>
knits ugly hats and even uglier afghans. But, most of the time we get to <br/>
choose what we do and we choose to do things that make us happy. There is no <br/>
reason in the world we can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t extend that same right to our children. <br/>
They are so small and dependent on us, (even when they are 16, 17, and 18 and <br/>
look like full grown adults, they are still forming and growing and we need to <br/>
remember this) they need to practice making choices, forming opinions, and <br/>
deciding what they like in the safety and comfort of home with their parents. If <br/>
we make it difficult for them, putting up roadblocks of our own opinions, <br/>
views, morals, tastes, then they begin to balk. (this isn&#39;t to say we can&#39;t and <br/>
shouldn&#39;t show and model our values and morals for them, we just can&#39;t expect <br/>
them to accept them without testing the validity of said values and morals for <br/>
themselves.) They resist and rebel. They learn that parents and other adults <br/>
don&#39;t care. So sometimes we have to look at money spent, time gone by, projects <br/>
gathering dust in a corner as evidence that our children are building good <br/>
lives for themselves, that they are discovering who they are and how they fit in <br/>
this world, and THAT is good and worth the money, time, and effort. <br/>

Thanks Nancy!  I&#39;m crying too, but tears of joy ~ what a lucky boy you have <br/>
and what an inspiration you are :&#39;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775707743">This new list description is available on the yahoogroups homepage <br/>
for this group and will be sent to each new list subscriber:<br/>
<br/>
*******<br/>
Although unschooling is often described as a homeschooling style, it <br/>
is, in fact, much more than just another homeschool teaching method. <br/>
Unschooling is both a philosophy of natural learning and the <br/>
lifestyle that results from living according to the principles of <br/>
that philosophy. <br/>
<br/>
The most basic principle of unschooling is that children are born <br/>
with an intrinsic urge to explore -- for a moment or a lifetime -- <br/>
what intrigues them, as they seek to join the adult world in a <br/>
personally satisfying way. Because of that urge, an unschooling child <br/>
is free to choose the what, when, where and how of his/her own <br/>
learning from mud puddles to video games and SpongeBob Squarepants to <br/>
Shakespeare! And an unschooling parent sees his/her role, not as a <br/>
teacher, but as a facilitator and companion in a child&#39;s exploration <br/>
of the world. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a mindful lifestyle which encompasses, at its core, an <br/>
atmosphere of trust, freedom, joy and deep respect for who the child <br/>
is. This cannot be lived on a part-time basis. Unschooling sometimes <br/>
seems so intuitive that people feel they&#39;ve been doing it all along, <br/>
not realizing it has a name. Unschooling sometimes seems so <br/>
counterintuitive that people struggle to understand it, and it can <br/>
take years to fully accept its worth. <br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this list is to move out of our own comfort zones as <br/>
we critically examine our beliefs, ideas, and viewpoints about <br/>
learning, and seek a deeper understanding of unschooling and more <br/>
respectful relationships with our children. <br/>
<br/>
Please read for at least a week or two, before posting, to get a feel <br/>
for the list. New members are on moderation, to avoid spam and other <br/>
disruptions. &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; can be found in the files area <br/>
of this list or, along with other list information, at: <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256085353">UnschoolingDiscussion List Posting Policies<br/>
<br/>
It is our sincere wish to provide a forum for those seeking to deepen <br/>
their understanding of the unschooling philosophy. The primary <br/>
purpose of this list is to encourage the critical examination of <br/>
ideas, beliefs and viewpoints. <br/>
<br/>
Questioning of deeply-held ideas and beliefs can be very <br/>
uncomfortable and sometimes responses to that process can stand in <br/>
the way of people getting what they need out of the list.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, we offer the following guidelines to help our members get <br/>
the most from the list:<br/>
<br/>
1. Read for at least a couple of weeks before posting yourself. Spend <br/>
that time getting a &quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members. This will <br/>
help you decide if this list is worth your time or whether some other <br/>
list might be more useful to you in meeting your needs.<br/>
<br/>
2 Expect your beliefs to be challenged. Welcome this as an <br/>
opportunity to critically examine your own ideas.<br/>
<br/>
3. When differences of opinion arise, stick to discussing ideas, not <br/>
the person with whom you are disagreeing.<br/>
<br/>
4. If you have a belief or practice that you don&#39;t want held up to <br/>
public examination, don&#39;t post it to the list.<br/>
<br/>
5. Before you hit &quot;send,&quot; consider whether your post will contribute<br/>
positively to the unschooling discussion.<br/>
<br/>
6. Avoid using loaded terminology. For instance, &quot;If you have no TV<br/>
restrictions why don&#39;t your kids just watch TV all day?&quot; will get you <br/>
more useful responses than, &quot;I don&#39;t see how your kids learn anything <br/>
if all they ever do is sit around like zombies watching unlimited TV.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
7. It is not useful to inform the list that you believe someone else <br/>
is being rude or discourteous; please trust the rest of the list to <br/>
recognize rudeness for themselves. Saying, &quot;Jane was rude to me,&quot; <br/>
just bogs down the list. It is also a waste of everyone&#39;s time when <br/>
participants attempt to correct or improve other list members&#39; <br/>
manners. It never works and always disrupts the list. Avoid<br/>
statements such as: &quot;Jane, here is my suggestion of how you could <br/>
write more nicely so people wouldn&#39;t think you are being rude.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
8. Our brains automatically supply a &quot;tone&quot; to posts as we read. It <br/>
can be helpful to imagine your best friend speaking the words you are <br/>
reading, in the gentlest, most well-meaning tone you can imagine. It <br/>
is unacceptable to attack the &quot;tone&quot; of the list or to make <br/>
generalizations about it. &quot;I&#39;ve been on many other lists and this one <br/>
is the rudest I&#39;ve seen,&quot; would be unacceptable. Instead, attempt to <br/>
create a positive, helpful tone with your own posts by setting the <br/>
example you hope others will follow.<br/>
<br/>
9. Envision every post and response as a dish at a potluck dinner. <br/>
You won&#39;t love every dish at a potluck any more than you will love <br/>
every poster&#39;s style of help. But a dish/post may be exactly what <br/>
someone else needs. If ou don&#39;t like a certain list member&#39;s <br/>
offerings, skip them and leave them for others.<br/>
<br/>
10. Read and write as clearly as you can. In casual conversation we <br/>
often don&#39;t realize how much we rely on others to fill in the gist of <br/>
our conversation based on what they expect us to say. But here, <br/>
without body language or inflection, all we have to go on are your <br/>
words and they should say what you mean. If you say, for example, <br/>
you &quot;never&quot; do something, it should not mean &quot;almost never.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our goal is to make the list as useful as possible for those seeking <br/>
to deepen their understanding of the unschooling philosophy. To do <br/>
that, all new list members are initially moderated to prevent <br/>
spamming and catch posts that could disrupt the list. People will <br/>
also be moderated if they disrupt the usefulness of the list. <br/>
Potentially disruptive posts will be returned for revision. <br/>
